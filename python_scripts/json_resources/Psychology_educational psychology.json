In general I found all of the books well-\nwritten and thorough. But I also found problems:\n(1) Though they differed in details, the major\ntextbooks were surprisingly similar in overall coverage.\nThis fact, coupled with their large overall size, made it\nhard to tailor any of the books to the particular interests\nor needs of individuals or groups of students. Too often,\nbuying a textbook was like having to buy a huge Sunday\nnewspaper when all you really want is to read one of its\nsections. In a similar way, commercial educational\npsychology textbooks usually told you more than you\never needed or wanted to know about the subject. As a\nformat, the textbook did not allow for individualization.\nDr. Kelvin Seifert\n(2) Educational psychology textbooks were always\nexpensive, and over the years their costs rose faster than inflation, especially in the United States, where most of the\nbooks have been produced. Currently every major text about educational psychology sells for more than USD 100.\nAt best this cost is a stress on students' budgets. At worst it puts educational psychology textbooks beyond the reach\nof many. The problem of the cost is even more obvious when put in worldwide perspective; in some countries the\ncost of one textbook is roughly equivalent to the average annual income of its citizens.\n(3) In the competition to sell copies of educational psychology textbooks, authors and publishers have gradually\nadded features that raise the cost of books without evidence of adding educational value. Educational psychology\npublishers in particular have increased the number of illustrations and photographs, switched to full-color editions,\nincreased the complexity and number of study guides and ancillary publications, and created proprietary websites\nusable fully only by adopters of their particular books. These features have sometimes been attractive. My teaching\nexperience suggests, however, that they also distract students from learning key ideas about educational psychology\nabout as often as they help students to learn.\nBy publishing this textbook online with the Global Textbook Project, I have taken a step toward resolving these\nproblems. Instructors and students can access as much or as little of the textbook as they really need and find\nuseful. The cost of their doing is minimal. Pedagogical features are available, but are kept to a minimum and\nrendered in formats that can be accessed freely and easily by anyone connected to the Internet. In the future,\nrevisions to the book will be relatively easy and prompt to make. These, I believe, are desirable outcomes for\neveryone! --Kelvin Seifert\nEducational Psychology 7 A Global Text This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n1. The changing teaching\nprofession and you\nA teacher named Ashley reflects: She looked around the classroom, enjoying a blessed moment of\nquiet after the students left at the end of the day. \u201cAshley, the teacher, that\u2019s me\u201d, she said proudly to\nthe empty room. \u201cBut why am I doing this?\u201d she asked herself quietly\u2014and realized she wasn\u2019t\nalways sure of the answer. But then she remembered one reason: she was teaching for Nadia, who\nsat at the table to the left, always smiled so well and always (well, usually) tried hard. And another\nreason: she was teaching for Lincoln, tired old Lincoln, who needed her help more than he realized.\nShe remembered twenty other reasons\u2014twenty other students. And one last reason: she was also\nteaching for herself, challenging herself to see if she really could keep up with twenty-two young\npeople at once, and really accomplish something worthwhile with them. She was teaching so she\ncould keep growing as a person, keep connecting with others, keep learning new ideas. That\u2019s why\nshe was teaching.\nThe joys of teaching\nWhy be a teacher? The short answer is easy:\n\u2022 to witness the diversity of growth in young people, and their joy in learning\n\u2022 to encourage lifelong learning\u2014both for yourself and for others\n\u2022 to experience the challenge of devising and doing interesting, exciting activities for the young\nThere is, of course, more than this to be said about the value of teaching. Consider, for instance, the \u201cyoung\npeople\u201d referred to above. In one class they could be six years old; in another they could be sixteen, or even older.\nThey could be rich, poor, or somewhere in between. They could come from any ethnic background. Their first\nlanguage could be English, or something else. There are all sorts of possibilities. But whoever the particular\nstudents are, they will have potential as human beings: talents and personal qualities\u2014possibly not yet realized\u2014\nthat can contribute to society, whether as leaders, experts, or supporters of others. A teacher's job\u2014in fact a\nteacher's privilege\u2014is to help particular \u201cyoung people\u201d to realize their potential.\nAnother teacher reflects: Nathan paused for a deep breath before speaking to me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\nexpected it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got five kids who speak English as a second language. I didn\u2019t expect\nthat. I\u2019ve got two, maybe three, with reading disabilities, and one of them has a part-time aide. I\u2019ve\nhad to learn more about using computers than I ever expected\u2014they\u2019re a lot of curriculum materials\nonline now, and the computers help the kids that need more practice or who finish activities early.\nI\u2019m doing more screening and testing of kids than I expected, and it all takes time away from\nteaching.\nEducational Psychology 8 A Global Text 1. The changing teaching profession and you\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not all surprises. I expected to be able to \u2018light a fire\u2019 under kids about learning to read. And\nthat has actually happened, at least sometimes with some children!\u201d\nAs a teacher, you will be able to do this by laying groundwork for lifelong learning. You will not teach any one\nstudent forever, of course, but you will often work with them long enough to convey a crucial message: that there is\nmuch in life to learn\u2014more in fact than any one teacher or school can provide in a lifetime. The knowledge may be\nabout science, math, or learning to read; the skills may be sports, music, or art\u2014anything. Whatever you teach, its\nimmensity can be a source of curiosity, wonder and excitement. It can be a reason to be optimistic about life in\ngeneral and about your students in particular. Learning, when properly understood, is never-ending, even though it\noften focuses on short-term, immediate concerns. As a teacher, you will have an advantage not shared by every\nmember of society, namely the excuse not only to teach valuable knowledge and skills, but to point students beyond\nwhat they will be able to learn from you. As an old limerick put it (before the days of gender-balanced language),\n\u201cThe world is full of such a plenty of things, I\u2019m sure we should all be as happy as kings.\u201d\nJennifer Fuller, a third teacher reflects: \u201cOK\u201d, suddenly getting businesslike in her tone. \u201cHere\u2019s my\ntypical day teaching tenth grade: I get up at 6:30, have a quick breakfast, get to school by 7:45 if the\ntraffic\u2019s not bad. Then I check my email\u2014usually there\u2019s a little stuff from the principal or some other\nadministrator, maybe one or two from parents concerned because their child is doing poorly in one\nof my classes, maybe one or two from students\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to be sick today, Ms Fuller!\u201d\u2014that sort of\nthing. Now it\u2019s 8:15 and I have two hours before my first class\u2014this term I teach only biology, and I\nonly teach periods 2, 3, and 5. Maybe I have marking to do before class, or maybe I have to get a lab\ndemonstration ready. Or maybe we all have to troupe down to the library for a staff meeting\n(groan\u2026). Whatever I don\u2019t finish in the morning, I have to finish after school. But that\u2019s also when I\nmeet with the Ecology Club (I\u2019m the faculty advisor), so I might have to finish stuff in the evening. I\ntry not to do it then, but a lot of times I have to. But I always quit by 9:00\u2014that\u2019s always when I\nwatch TV for an hour, or just \u201cvegetate \u201d with a book.\u201d\nWhatever you teach, you will be able to feel the satisfaction of designing and orchestrating complex activities\nthat communicate new ideas and skills effectively. The challenge is attractive to many teachers, because that is\nwhere they exercise judgment and \u201cartistry\u201d the most freely and frequently. Your students will depend on your skill\nat planning and managing, though sometimes without realizing how much they do so. Teachers will need you to\nknow how to explain ideas clearly, to present new materials in a sensible sequence and at an appropriate pace, to\npoint out connections between their new learning and their prior experiences. Although these skills really take a\nlifetime to master, they can be practiced successfully even by beginning teachers, and they do improve steadily with\ncontinued teaching over time. Right from the start, though, skill at design and communication of curriculum is one\nof the major \u201cperks\u201d of the job.\nThe very complexity of classroom life virtually guarantees that teaching never needs to get boring. Something\nnew and exciting is bound to occur just when you least expect it. A student shows an insight that you never\nexpected to see\u2014or fails to show one that you were sure he had. An activity goes better than expected\u2014or worse, or\nmerely differently. You understand for the first time why a particular student behaves as she does, and begin\nthinking of how to respond to the student's behavior more helpfully in the future. After teaching a particular\n9 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nlearning objective several times, you realize that you understand it differently than the first time you taught it. And\nso on. The job never stays the same; it evolves continually. As long as you keep teaching, you will have a job with\nnovelty.\nAre there also challenges to teaching?\nHere, too, the simple answer is \u201cyes\u201d. Every joy of teaching has a possible frustration related to it. You may wish\nto make a positive difference in students' lives, but you may also have trouble reaching individuals. A student seems\nnot to learn much, or to be unmotivated, or unfriendly, or whatever. And some teaching problems can be subtle:\nwhen you call attention to the wonderful immensity of an area of knowledge, you might accidentally discourage a\nstudent by implying that the student can never learn \u201cenough\u201d. The complexity of designing and implementing\ninstruction can sometimes seem overwhelming, instead of satisfying. Unexpected events in your classroom can\nbecome chaos rather than an attractive novelty. To paraphrase a popular self-help book, sometimes \u201cbad things\nhappen to good teachers\u201d (Kushner, 1983). But as in the rest of life, the \u201cbad things\u201d of teaching do not negate the\nvalue of the good. If anything, the undesired events make the good, desired ones even more satisfying, and render\nthe work of teaching all the more valuable. As you will see throughout this book, there are resources for maximizing\nthe good, the valuable, and the satisfying. You can bring these resources to your work, along with your growing\nprofessional knowledge and a healthy dose of common sense. In this sense you will not need to \u201cgo it alone\u201d in\nlearning to teach well. You will, however, be personally responsible for becoming and remaining the best teacher\nthat you can possibly be; the only person who can make that happen will be you. Many of the resources for making\nthis happen are described in this book in the chapters ahead.\nTeaching is different from in the past\nIn the past decade or two teaching has changed significantly, so much in fact that schools may not be what some\nof us remember from our own childhood. Changes have affected both the opportunities and the challenges of\nteaching, as well as the attitudes, knowledge, and skills needed to prepare for a teaching career. The changes have\ninfluenced much of the content of this book.\nTo see what we mean, look briefly at four new trends in education, at how they have changed what teachers do,\nand at how you will therefore need to prepare to teach:\n\u2022 increased diversity: there are more differences among students than there used to be. Diversity has\nmade teaching more fulfilling as a career, but also made more challenging in certain respects.\n\u2022 * increased instructional technology: classrooms, schools, and students use computers more often\ntoday than in the past for research, writing, communicating, and keeping records. Technology has created\nnew ways for students to learn (for example, this textbook would not be possible without Internet\ntechnology!). It has also altered how teachers can teach most effectively, and even raised issues about what\nconstitutes \u201ctrue\u201d teaching and learning.\n\u2022 greater accountability in education: both the public and educators themselves pay more attention\nthan in the past to how to assess (or provide evidence for) learning and good quality teaching. The attention\nhas increased the importance of education to the public (a good thing) and improved education for some\nstudents. But it has also created new constraints on what teachers teach and what students learn.\nEducational Psychology 10 A Global Text 1. The changing teaching profession and you\n\u2022 increased professionalism of teachers: Now more than ever, teachers are able to assess the quality of\ntheir own work as well as that of colleagues, and to take steps to improve it when necessary.\nProfessionalism improves teaching, but by creating higher standards of practice it also creates greater\nworries about whether particular teachers and schools are \u201cgood enough\u201d.\nHow do these changes show up in the daily life of classrooms? The answer depends partly on where you teach;\ncircumstances differ among schools, cities, and even whole societies. Some clues about the effects of the trends on\nclassroom life can be found, however, by considering one particular case\u2014the changes happening in North America.\nNew trend #1: diversity in students\nStudents have, of course, always been diverse. Whether in the past or in the present day, students learn at\nunique paces, show unique personalities, and learn in their own ways. In recent decades, though, the forms and\nextent of diversity have increased. Now more than ever, teachers are likely to serve students from diverse language\nbackgrounds, to serve more individuals with special educational needs, and to teach students either younger and\nolder than in the past.\nLanguage diversity\nTake the case of language diversity. In the United States, about 40 million people, or 14 per cent of the\npopulation are Hispanic. About 20 per cent of these speak primarily Spanish, and approximately another 50 per\ncent speak only limited English (United States Census Bureau, 2005). The educators responsible for the children in\nthis group need to accommodate instruction to these students somehow. Part of the solution, of course, is to\narrange specialized second-language teachers and classes. But adjustment must also happen in \u201cregular\u201d\nclassrooms of various grade levels and subjects. Classroom teachers must learn to communicate with students\nwhose English language background is limited, at the same time that the students themselves are learning to use\nEnglish more fluently (Pitt, 2005). Since relatively few teachers are Hispanic or speak fluent Spanish, the\nadjustments can sometimes be a challenge. Teachers must plan lessons and tasks that students actually understand.\nAt the same time teachers must also keep track of the major learning goals of the curriculum. In Chapter 4\n(\u201cStudent Diversity\u201d) and Chapter 10 (\u201cPlanning Instruction\u201d), some strategies for doing so are described. As you\ngain experience teaching, you will no doubt find additional strategies and resources (Gebhard, 2006), especially if\nsecond-language learners become an important part of your classes.\nDiversity of special educational needs\nAnother factor making classroom increasingly diverse has been the inclusion of students with disabilities into\nclassrooms with non-disabled peers. In the United States the trend began in the 1970s, but accelerated with the\npassage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, and again when the Act was amended in 2004\n(United States Government Printing Office, 2005). In Canada similar legislation was passed in individual provinces\nduring the same general time period. The laws guarantee free, appropriate education for children with disabilities\nof any kind\u2014whether the impairment is physical, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral. The laws also recognize that\nsuch students need special supports in order to learn or function effectively in a classroom with non-disabled peers,\nso they provide for special services (for example, teaching assistants) and procedures for making individualized\neducational plans for students with disabilities.\n11 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAs a result of these changes, most American and Canadian teachers are likely to have at least a few students with\nspecial educational needs, even if they are not trained as special education teachers or have had no prior personal\nexperience with people with disabilities. Classroom teachers are also likely to work as part of a professional team\nfocused on helping these students to learn as well as possible and to participate in the life of the school. The trend\ntoward inclusion is definitely new compared to circumstances just a generation or two ago. It raises new challenges\nabout planning instruction (such as how is a teacher to find time to plan for individuals?), and philosophical\nquestions about the very nature of education (such as what in the curriculum is truly important to learn?). These\nquestions will come up again in Chapter 5, where we discuss teaching students with special educational needs.\nLifelong learning\nThe diversity of modern classrooms is not limited to language or disabilities. Another recent change has been\nthe broadening simply of the age range of individuals who count as \u201cstudents\u201d. In many nations of the world, half or\nmost of all three- and four-year-olds attend some form of educational program, either part-time preschool or full-\ntime child care (National Institute for Early Education Research, 2006). In North America some public school\ndivisions have moved toward including nursery or preschool programs as a newer \u201cgrade level\u201d preceding\nkindergarten. Others have expanded the hours of kindergarten (itself considered a \u201cnew\u201d program early in the 20th\ncentury) to span a full-day program.\nThe obvious differences in maturity between preschoolers and older children lead most teachers of the very\nyoung to use flexible, open-ended plans and teaching strategies, and to develop more personal or family-like\nrelationships with their young \u201cstudents\u201d than typical with older students (Bredekamp & Copple, 1997). Just as\nimportant, though, are the educational and philosophical issues that early childhood education has brought to\npublic attention. Some educational critics ask whether preschool and day care programs risk becoming\ninappropriate substitutes for families. Other educators suggest, in contrast, that teachers of older students can learn\nfrom the flexibility and open-ended approach common in early childhood education. For teachers of any grade\nlevel, it is a debate that cannot be avoided completely or permanently. In this book, it reappears in Chapter 3, where\nI discuss students\u2019 development\u2014their major long-term, changes in skills, knowledge, and attitudes.\nThe other end of the age spectrum has also expanded. Many individuals take courses well into adulthood even if\nthey do not attend formal university or college. Adult education, as it is sometimes called, often takes place in\nworkplaces, but it often also happens in public high schools or at local community colleges or universities. Some\nadult students may be completing high school credentials that they missed earlier in their lives, but often the\nstudents have other purposes that are even more focused, such as learning a trade-related skill. The teachers of\nadult students have to adjust their instructional strategies and relationships with students so as to challenge and\nrespect their special strengths and constraints as adults (Bash, 2005). The students\u2019 maturity often means that they\nhave had life experiences that enhance and motivate their learning. But it may also mean that they have significant\npersonal responsibilities\u2014such as parenting or a full-time job\u2014which compete for study time, and that make them\nimpatient with teaching that is irrelevant to their personal goals or needs. These advantages and constraints also\noccur to a lesser extent among \u201cregular\u201d high school students. Even secondary school teachers must ask, how they\ncan make sure that instruction does not waste students\u2019 time, and how they can make it truly efficient, effective, and\nvaluable. Elsewhere in this book (especially in Chapters 9 through 11, about assessment and instruction), we discuss\nthese questions from a number of perspectives.\nEducational Psychology 12 A Global Text 1. The changing teaching profession and you\nNew trend #2: using technology to support learning\nFor most teachers, \u201ctechnology\u201d means using computers and the Internet as resources for teaching and learning.\nThese tools have greatly increased the amount and range of information available to students, even if their benefits\nhave sometimes been exaggerated in media reports (Cuban, 2001). With the Internet, it is now relatively easy to\naccess up-to-date information on practically any subject imaginable, often with pictures, video clips, and audio to\naccompany them. It would seem not only that the Internet and its associated technologies have the potential to\ntransform traditional school-based learning, but also that they have in fact begun to do so.\nFor a variety of reasons, however, technology has not always been integrated into teachers\u2019 practices very\nthoroughly (Haertel & Means, 2003). One reason is practical: in many societies and regions, classrooms contain\nonly one or two computers at most, and many schools have at best only limited access to the Internet. Waiting for a\nturn on the computer or arranging to visit a computer lab or school library limits how much students use the\nInternet, no matter how valuable the Internet may be. In such cases, furthermore, computers tend to function in\nrelatively traditional ways that do not take full advantage of the Internet: as a word processor (a \u201cfancy typewriter\u201d),\nfor example, or as a reference book similar to an encyclopedia.\nEven so, single-computer classrooms create new possibilities and challenges for teachers. A single computer can\nbe used, for example, to present upcoming assignments or supplementary material to students, either one at a time\nor small groups. In functioning in this way, the computer gives students more flexibility about when to finish old\ntasks or to begin new ones. A single computer can also enrich the learning of individual students with special\ninterests or motivation. And it can provide additional review to students who need extra help. These changes are\nnot dramatic, but they lead to important revisions in teachers\u2019 roles: they move teachers away from simply\ndelivering information to students, and toward facilitating students\u2019 own constructions of knowledge.\nA shift from \u201cfull-frontal teaching\u201d to \u201cguide on the side\u201d becomes easier as the amount and use of computer and\nInternet technologies increases. If a school (or better yet, a classroom) has numerous computers with full Internet\naccess, then students\u2019 can in principle direct their own learning more independently than if computers are scarce\ncommodities. With ample technology available, teachers can focus much more on helping individuals in developing\nand carrying out learning plans, as well as on assisting individuals with special learning problems. In these ways a\nstrong shift to computers and the Internet can change a teacher\u2019s role significantly, and make the teacher more\neffective.\nBut technology also brings some challenges, or even creates problems. It costs money to equip classrooms and\nschools fully: often that money is scarce, and may therefore mean depriving students of other valuable resources,\nlike additional staff or additional books and supplies. Other challenges are less tangible. In using the Internet, for\nexample, students need help in sorting out trustworthy information or websites from the \u201cfluff\u201d, websites that are\nunreliable or even damaging (Seiter, 2005). Providing this help can sometimes be challenging even for experienced\nteachers. And some educational activities simply do not lend themselves to computerized learning\u2014sports, for\nexample, driver education, or choral practice. As a new teacher, therefore, you will need not only to assess what\ntechnologies are possible in your particular classroom, but also what will actually be assisted by new technologies.\nThen be prepared for your decisions to affect how you teach\u2014the ways you work with students.\n13 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nNew trend #3: accountability in education\nIn recent years, the public and its leaders have increasingly expected teachers and students to be accountable for\ntheir work, meaning that schools and teachers are held responsible for implementing particular curricula and goals,\nand that students are held responsible for learning particular knowledge. The trend toward accountability has\nincreased the legal requirements for becoming and (sometimes) remaining certified as a teacher. In the United\nStates in particular, preservice teachers need more subject-area and education-related courses than in the past.\nThey must also spend more time practice teaching than in the past, and they must pass one or more examinations\nof knowledge of subject matter and teaching strategies. The specifics of these requirements vary among regions, but\nthe general trend\u2014toward more numerous and \u201chigher\u201d levels of requirements\u2014has occurred broadly throughout\nthe English-speaking world. The changes obviously affect individuals\u2019 experiences of becoming a teacher\u2014\nespecially the speed and cost of doing so.\nPublic accountability has led to increased use of high-stakes testing, which are tests taken by all students in a\ndistrict or region that have important consequences for students' further education (Fuhrman & Elmore, 2004).\nHigh-stakes tests may influence grades that students receive in courses or determine whether students graduate or\ncontinue to the next level of schooling. The tests are often a mixture of essay and structured-response questions\n(such as multiple-choice items), and raise important issues about what teachers should teach, as well as how (and\nwhether) teachers should help students to pass the examinations. It also raises issues about whether high-stakes\ntesting is fair to all students and consistent with other ideals of public education, such as giving students the best\npossible start in life instead of disqualifying them from educational opportunities. Furthermore, since the results of\nhigh-stakes tests are sometimes also used to evaluate the performance of teachers, schools, or school districts,\ninsuring students\u2019 success on them becomes an obvious concern for teachers\u2014one that affects instructional\ndecisions on a daily basis. For this reason we discuss the purpose, nature, and effects of high-stakes tests in detail in\nChapter 12.\nNew trend #4: increased professionalism of teachers\nWhatever your reactions to the first three trends, it is important to realize that they have contributed to a fourth\ntrend, an increase in professionalism of teachers. By most definitions, an occupation (like medicine or law\u2014or in\nthis case teaching) is a profession if its members take personal responsibility for the quality of their work, hold each\nother accountable for its quality, and recognize and require special training in order to practice it.\nBy this definition, teaching has definitely become more professional than in the past (Cochran-Smith & Fries,\n2005). Increased expectations of achievement by students mean that teachers have increased responsibility not\nonly for their students\u2019 academic success, but also for their own development as teachers. Becoming a new teacher\nnow requires more specialized work than in the past, as reflected in the increased requirements for certification and\nlicensing in many societies and regions. The increased requirements are partly a response to the complexities\ncreated by the increasing diversity of students and increasing use of technology in classrooms.\nGreater professionalism has also been encouraged by initiatives from educators themselves to study and\nimprove their own practice. One way to do so, for example, is through action research (sometimes also called\nteacher research), a form of investigation carried out by teachers about their own students or their own teaching.\nEducational Psychology 14 A Global Text 1. The changing teaching profession and you\nAction research studies lead to concrete decisions that improve teaching and learning in particular educational\ncontexts (Mertler, 2006; Stringer, 2004). The studies can take many forms, but here are a few brief examples:\n\u2022 How precisely do individual children learn to read? In an action research study, the teacher might observe\nand track one child\u2019s reading progress carefully for an extended time. From the observations she can get\nclues about how to help not only that particular child to read better, but also other children in her class or\neven in colleagues\u2019 classes.\n\u2022 Does it really matter if a high school social studies teacher uses more, rather than fewer, open-ended\nquestions? As an action of research study, the teacher might videotape his own lessons, and systematically\ncompare students\u2019 responses to his open-ended questions compared to their responses to more closed\nquestions (the ones with more fixed answers). The analysis might suggest when and how much it is indeed\ndesirable to use open-ended questions.\n\u2022 Can an art teacher actually entice students to take more creative risks with their drawings? As an action\nresearch study, the teacher might examine the students\u2019 drawings carefully for signs of visual novelty and\ninnovation, and then see if the signs increase if she encourages novelty and innovation explicitly.\nTable 1: Examples of action research project\nSteps in action research Example 1: students\u2019 use of Example 2: a teacher\u2019s\nProject the Internet helpfulness to ESL students\nPurpose of the research (as \u201cIn doing assignments, how \u201cAm I responding to my ESL\nexpressed by the teacher doing the successful are my students at finding students as fully and helpfully as to\nresearch) high-quality, relevant information?\u201d my English-speaking students, and\nwhy or why not?\u201d\nWho is doing the study?

Although these examples, like\nmany action research studies, resemble \u201cespecially good teaching practice\u201d, they are planned more thoughtfully\nthan usual, carried out and recorded more systematically, and shared with fellow teachers more thoroughly and\nopenly. As such, they yield special benefits to teachers as professionals, though they also take special time and\neffort. For now, the important point is that use of action research simultaneously reflects the increasing\nprofessionalism of teachers, but at the same time creates higher standards for teachers when they teach.\nHow educational psychology can help\nAll things considered, then, times have changed for teachers. But teaching remains an attractive, satisfying, and\nworthwhile profession. The recent trends mean simply that you need to prepare for teaching differently than you\nmight have in the past, and perhaps differently than your own school teachers did a generation ago. Fortunately,\nthere are ways to do this. Many current programs in teacher education provide a balance of experiences in tune\nwith current and emerging needs of teachers. They offer more time for practice teaching in schools, for example,\nand teacher education instructors often make deliberate efforts to connect the concepts and ideas of education and\npsychology to current best practices of education. These and other features of contemporary teacher education will\nmake it easier for you to become the kind of teacher that you not only want to be, but also will need to be.\nThis book\u2014about educational psychology and its relation to teaching and learning\u2014can be one of your supports\nas you get started. To make it as useful as possible, we have written about educational psychology while keeping in\nmind the current state of teaching, as well as your needs as a unique future teacher. The text draws heavily on\nconcepts, research and fundamental theories from educational psychology. But these are selected and framed\naround the problems, challenges, and satisfactions faced by teachers daily, and especially as faced by teachers new\nto the profession. We have selected and emphasized topics in proportion to two factors: (1) their importance as\nreported by teachers and other educational experts, and (2) the ability of educational psychology to comment on\nparticular problems, challenges, and satisfactions helpfully.\nEducational Psychology 16 A Global Text 1. The changing teaching profession and you\nThere is a lot to learn about teaching, and much of it comes from educational psychology. As a career, teaching\nhas distinctive features now that it did not have a generation ago. The new features make it more exciting in some\nways, as well as more challenging than in the past. The changes require learning teaching skills that were less\nimportant in earlier times. But the new skills are quite learnable. Educational psychology, and this text, will get you\nstarted at that task.\nChapter summary\nTeaching in the twenty-first century offers a number of satisfactions\u2014witnessing and assisting the growth of\nyoung people, lifelong learning, the challenge and excitement of designing effective instruction. Four trends have\naffected the way that these satisfactions are experienced by classroom teachers: (1) increased diversity of students,\n(2) the spread of instructional technology in schools and classrooms, (3) increased expectations for accountability\nin education, and (4) the development of increased professionalism among teachers. Each trend presents new\nopportunities to students and teachers, but also raises new issues for teachers. Educational psychology, and this\ntextbook, can help teachers to make constructive use of the new trends as well as deal with the dilemmas that\naccompany them. It offers information, advice, and useful perspectives specifically in three areas of teaching: (1)\nstudents as learners, (2) instruction and assessment, and (3) the psychological and social awareness of teachers.\nOn the Internet\n<www.ets.org/praxis> Try this website of the Educational Testing Service if you are curious to learn more\nabout licensing examinations for teachers, including the PRAXIS II test that is prominent in the United States (see\npp. xxx).

They are both useful for planning instruction.\nThe first one\u2014maintained by a group of educators and calling itself EdChange\u2014focuses on culturally related forms\nof diversity, and the second one\u2014by the Council for Exceptional Children\u2014focuses on children with special\neducational needs.\nKey terms\nAccountability in education Instructional technology\nAction research Lifelong learning\nAssessment Professionalism\nDiversity Teacher research\nHigh-stakes testing\nReferences\nBash, L.

The learning process\nWhen my son Michael was old enough to talk, and being an eager but na\u00efve dad, I decided to bring\nMichael to my educational psychology class to demonstrate to my students \u201chow children learn\u201d. In\none task I poured water from a tall drinking glass to a wide glass pie plate, which according to\nMichael changed the \u201camount\u201d of water\u2014there was less now than it was in the pie plate. I told him\nthat, on the contrary, the amount of water had stayed the same whether it was in the glass or the pie\nplate. He looked at me a bit strangely, but complied with my point of view\u2014agreeing at first that,\nyes, the amount had stayed the same. But by the end of the class session he had reverted to his\noriginal position: there was less water, he said, when it was poured into the pie plate compared to\nbeing poured into the drinking glass. So much for demonstrating \u201clearning\u201d!\n(Kelvin Seifert)\nLearning is generally defined as relatively permanent changes in behavior, skills, knowledge, or attitudes\nresulting from identifiable psychological or social experiences. A key feature is permanence: changes do not count\nas learning if they are temporary. You do not \u201clearn\u201d a phone number if you forget it the minute after you dial the\nnumber; you do not \u201clearn\u201d to eat vegetables if you only do it when forced. The change has to last. Notice, though,\nthat learning can be physical, social, or emotional as well as cognitive. You do not \u201clearn\u201d to sneeze simply by\ncatching cold, but you do learn many skills and behaviors that are physically based, such as riding a bicycle or\nthrowing a ball. You can also learn to like (or dislike) a person, even though this change may not happen\ndeliberately.\nEach year after that first visit to my students, while Michael was still a preschooler, I returned with\nhim to my ed-psych class to do the same \u201clearning demonstrations\u201d. And each year Michael came\nalong happily, but would again fail the task about the drinking glass and the pie plate. He would\ncomply briefly if I \u201csuggested\u201d that the amount of water stayed the same no matter which way it was\npoured, but in the end he would still assert that the amount had changed. He was not learning this\nbit of conventional knowledge, in spite of my repeated efforts.\nBut the year he turned six, things changed. When I told him it was time to visit my ed-psych class\nagain, he readily agreed and asked: \u201cAre you going to ask me about the water in the drinking glass\nand pie plate again?\u201d I said yes, I was indeed planning to do that task again. \u201cThat\u2019s good\u201d, he\nresponded, \u201cbecause I know that the amount stays the same even after you pour it. But do you want\nme to fake it this time? For your students\u2019 sake?\u201d\nTeachers\u2019 perspectives on learning\nFor teachers, learning usually refers to things that happen in schools or classrooms, even though every teacher\ncan of course describe examples of learning that happen outside of these places. Even Michael, at age 6, had begun\nrealizing that what counted as \u201clearning\u201d in his dad\u2019s educator-type mind was something that happened in a\nEducational Psychology 20 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nclassroom, under the supervision of a teacher (me). For me, as for many educators, the term has a more specific\nmeaning than for many people less involved in schools. In particular, teachers\u2019 perspectives on learning often\nemphasize three ideas, and sometimes even take them for granted: (1) curriculum content and academic\nachievement, (2) sequencing and readiness, and (3) the importance of transferring learning to new or future\nsituations.\nViewing learning as dependent on curriculum\nWhen teachers speak of learning, they tend to emphasize whatever is taught in schools deliberately, including\nboth the official curriculum and the various behaviors and routines that make classrooms run smoothly. In practice,\ndefining learning in this way often means that teachers equate learning with the major forms of academic\nachievement\u2014especially language and mathematics\u2014and to a lesser extent musical skill, physical coordination, or\nsocial sensitivity (Gardner, 1999, 2006). The imbalance occurs not because the goals of public education make\nteachers responsible for certain content and activities (like books and reading) and the skills which these activities\nrequire (like answering teachers\u2019 questions and writing essays). It does happen not (thankfully!) because teachers\nare biased, insensitive, or unaware that students often learn a lot outside of school.\nA side effect of thinking of learning as related only to curriculum or academics is that classroom social\ninteractions and behaviors become issues for teachers\u2014become things that they need to manage. In particular,\nhaving dozens of students in one room makes it more likely that I, as a teacher, think of \u201clearning\u201d as something\nthat either takes concentration (to avoid being distracted by others) or that benefits from collaboration (to take\nadvantage of their presence). In the small space of a classroom, no other viewpoint about social interaction makes\nsense. Yet in the wider world outside of school, learning often does happen incidentally, \u201caccidentally\u201d and without\nconscious interference or input from others: I \u201clearn\u201d what a friend\u2019s personality is like, for example, without either\nof us deliberately trying to make this happen. As teachers, we sometimes see incidental learning in classrooms as\nwell, and often welcome it; but our responsibility for curriculum goals more often focuses our efforts on what\nstudents can learn through conscious, deliberate effort. In a classroom, unlike in many other human settings, it is\nalways necessary to ask whether classmates are helping or hindering individual students\u2019 learning.\nFocusing learning on changes in classrooms has several other effects. One, for example, is that it can tempt\nteachers to think that what is taught is equivalent to what is learned\u2014even though most teachers know that doing\nso is a mistake, and that teaching and learning can be quite different. If I assign a reading to my students about the\nRussian Revolution, it would be nice to assume not only that they have read the same words, but also learned the\nsame content. But that assumption is not usually the reality. Some students may have read and learned all of what I\nassigned; others may have read everything but misunderstood the material or remembered only some of it; and still\nothers, unfortunately, may have neither read nor learned much of anything. Chances are that my students would\nconfirm this picture, if asked confidentially. There are ways, of course, to deal helpfully with such diversity of\noutcomes; for suggestions, see especially Chapter 10 \u201cPlanning instruction\u201d and Chapter 11 \u201cTeacher-made\nassessment strategies\u201d. But whatever instructional strategies I adopt, they cannot include assuming that what I\nteach is the same as what students understand or retain of what I teach.\n21 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nViewing learning as dependent on sequencing and readiness\nThe distinction between teaching and learning creates a secondary issue for teachers, that of educational\nreadiness. Traditionally the concept referred to students\u2019 preparedness to cope with or profit from the activities\nand expectations of school. A kindergarten child was \u201cready\u201d to start school, for example, if he or she was in good\nhealth, showed moderately good social skills, could take care of personal physical needs (like eating lunch or going\nto the bathroom unsupervised), could use a pencil to make simple drawings, and so on. Table 3 shows a similar set\nof criteria for determining whether a child is \u201cready\u201d to learn to read (Copple & Bredekamp, 2006). At older ages\n(such as in high school or university), the term readiness is often replaced by a more specific term, prerequisites. To\ntake a course in physics, for example, a student must first have certain prerequisite experiences, such as studying\nadvanced algebra or calculus. To begin work as a public school teacher, a person must first engage in practice\nteaching for a period of time (not to mention also studying educational psychology!).\nTable 2: Reading readiness in students vs in teachers\nSigns of readiness in the child or student Signs of readiness to teach reading\n\u2022 productive (speaking) vocabulary of 5,000- \u2022 teacher answers children\u2019s questions when\n8,000 words possible\n\u2022 child understands and uses complete sentences \u2022 teacher encourages child to find out more\nthrough other means in addition to asking teacher\n\u2022 child\u2019s questions tend to be relevant to the task\nat hand \u2022 teacher asks questions designed to elaborate or\nexpand child\u2019s thinking\n\u2022 child\u2019s correctly using most common\ngrammatical constructions \u2022 teacher highlights letters and sounds in the\nclassroom\n\u2022 child can match some letters to some sounds\n\u2022 teacher provides lots of paper and marking\n\u2022 child can string a few letters together to make a\ntools\nfew simple words\n\u2022 teacher assists child with initial writing of\n\u2022 child can tell and retell stories, poems, and\nletters\nsongs\n\u2022 teacher encourages children to enact stories,\npoems, and songs\nSource: Copple & Bredekamp, 2006.\nNote that this traditional meaning, of readiness as preparedness, focuses attention on students\u2019 adjustment to\nschool and away from the reverse: the possibility that schools and teachers also have a responsibility for adjusting\nto students. But the latter idea is in fact a legitimate, second meaning for readiness: If 5-year-old children\nnormally need to play a lot and keep active, then it is fair to say that their kindergarten teacher needs to be \u201cready\u201d\nfor this behavior by planning for a program that allows a lot of play and physical activity. If she cannot or will not\nEducational Psychology 22 A Global Text 2. The learning process\ndo so (whatever the reason may be), then in a very real sense this failure is not the children\u2019s responsibility. Among\nolder students, the second, teacher-oriented meaning of readiness makes sense as well. If a teacher has a student\nwith a disability (for example, the student is visually impaired), then the teacher has to adjust her approach in\nappropriate ways\u2014not simply expect a visually impaired child to \u201csink or swim\u201d. As you might expect, this sense of\nreadiness is very important for special education, so I discuss it further in Chapter 5 \u201cStudents with special\neducational needs\u201d. But the issue of readiness also figures importantly whenever students are diverse (which is\nmost of the time), so it also comes up in Chapter 4 \u201cStudent diversity\u201d.\nViewing transfer as a crucial outcome of learning\nStill another result of focusing the concept of learning on classrooms is that it raises issues of usefulness or\ntransfer, which is the ability to use knowledge or skill in situations beyond the ones in which they are acquired.\nLearning to read and learning to solve arithmetic problems, for example, are major goals of the elementary school\ncurriculum because those skills are meant to be used not only inside the classroom, but outside as well. We teachers\nintend, that is, for reading and arithmetic skills to \u201ctransfer\u201d, even though we also do our best to make the skills\nenjoyable while they are still being learned. In the world inhabited by teachers, even more than in other worlds,\nmaking learning fun is certainly a good thing to do, but making learning useful as well as fun is even better.\nCombining enjoyment and usefulness, in fact, is a \u201cgold standard\u201d of teaching: we generally seek it for students,\neven though we may not succeed at providing it all of the time.\nMajor theories and models of learning\nSeveral ideas and priorities, then, affect how we teachers think about learning, including the curriculum, the\ndifference between teaching and learning, sequencing, readiness, and transfer. The ideas form a \u201cscreen\u201d through\nwhich to understand and evaluate whatever psychology has to offer education. As it turns out, many theories,\nconcepts, and ideas from educational psychology do make it through the \u201cscreen\u201d of education, meaning that they\nare consistent with the professional priorities of teachers and helpful in solving important problems of classroom\nteaching. In the case of issues about classroom learning, for example, educational psychologists have developed a\nnumber of theories and concepts that are relevant to classrooms, in that they describe at least some of what usually\nhappens there and offer guidance for assisting learning. It is helpful to group the theories according to whether they\nfocus on changes in behavior or in thinking. The distinction is rough and inexact, but a good place to begin. For\nstarters, therefore, consider two perspectives about learning, called behaviorism (learning as changes in overt\nbehavior) and constructivism, (learning as changes in thinking). The second category can be further divided into\npsychological constructivism (changes in thinking resulting from individual experiences), and social\nconstructivism, (changes in thinking due to assistance from others). The rest of this chapter describes key ideas\nfrom each of these viewpoints. As I hope you will see, each describes some aspects of learning not just in general,\nbut as it happens in classrooms in particular. So each perspective suggests things that you might do in your\nclassroom to make students\u2019 learning more productive.\nBehaviorism: changes in what students do\nBehaviorism is a perspective on learning that focuses on changes in individuals\u2019 observable behaviors\u2014\nchanges in what people say or do. At some point we all use this perspective, whether we call it \u201cbehaviorism\u201d or\nsomething else. The first time that I drove a car, for example, I was concerned primarily with whether I could\nactually do the driving, not with whether I could describe or explain how to drive. For another example: when I\n23 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nreached the point in life where I began cooking meals for myself, I was more focused on whether I could actually\nproduce edible food in a kitchen than with whether I could explain my recipes and cooking procedures to others.\nAnd still another example\u2014one often relevant to new teachers: when I began my first year of teaching, I was more\nfocused on doing the job of teaching\u2014on day-to-day survival\u2014than on pausing to reflect on what I was doing.\nNote that in all of these examples, focusing attention on behavior instead of on \u201cthoughts\u201d may have been\ndesirable at that moment, but not necessarily desirable indefinitely or all of the time. Even as a beginner, there are\ntimes when it is more important to be able to describe how to drive or to cook than to actually do these things. And\nthere definitely are many times when reflecting on and thinking about teaching can improve teaching itself. (As a\nteacher-friend once said to me: \u201cDon\u2019t just do something; stand there!\u201d) But neither is focusing on behavior which\nis not necessarily less desirable than focusing on students\u2019 \u201cinner\u201d changes, such as gains in their knowledge or\ntheir personal attitudes. If you are teaching, you will need to attend to all forms of learning in students, whether\ninner or outward.\nIn classrooms, behaviorism is most useful for identifying relationships between specific actions by a student and\nthe immediate precursors and consequences of the actions. It is less useful for understanding changes in students\u2019\nthinking; for this purpose we need a more cognitive (or thinking-oriented) theory, like the ones described later in\nthis chapter. This fact is not really a criticism of behaviorism as a perspective, but just a clarification of its particular\nstrength or source of usefulness, which is to highlight observable relationships among actions, precursors and\nconsequences. Behaviorists use particular terms (or \u201clingo\u201d, some might say) for these relationships. They also rely\nprimarily on two basic images or models of behavioral learning, called respondent (or \u201cclassical\u201d) conditioning and\noperant conditioning. The names are derived partly from the major learning mechanisms highlighted by each type,\nwhich I describe next.\nRespondent conditioning: learning new associations with prior behaviors\nAs originally conceived, respondent conditioning (sometimes also called classical conditioning) begins with\nthe involuntary responses to particular sights, sounds, or other sensations (Lavond, 2003). When I receive an\ninjection from a nurse or doctor, for example, I cringe, tighten my muscles, and even perspire a bit. Whenever a\ncontented, happy baby looks at me, on the other hand, I invariably smile in response. I cannot help myself in either\ncase; both of the responses are automatic. In humans as well as other animals, there is a repertoire or variety of\nsuch specific, involuntary behaviors. At the sound of a sudden loud noise, for example, most of us show a \u201cstartle\u201d\nresponse\u2014we drop what we are doing (sometimes literally!), our heart rate shoots up temporarily, and we look for\nthe source of the sound. Cats, dogs and many other animals (even fish in an aquarium) show similar or equivalent\nresponses.\nInvoluntary stimuli and responses were first studied systematically early in the twentieth-century by the Russian\nscientist Ivan Pavlov (1927). Pavlov\u2019s most well-known work did not involve humans, but dogs, and specifically\ntheir involuntary tendency to salivate when eating. He attached a small tube to the side of dogs\u2019 mouths that\nallowed him to measure how much the dogs salivated when fed (Exhibit 1 shows a photograph of one of Pavlov's\ndogs). But he soon noticed a \u201cproblem\u201d with the procedure: as the dogs gained experience with the experiment, they\noften salivated before they began eating. In fact the most experienced dogs sometimes began salivating before they\neven saw any food, simply when Pavlov himself entered the room! The sight of the experimenter, which had\nEducational Psychology 24 A Global Text 2. The learning process\noriginally been a neutral experience for the dogs, became associated with the dogs\u2019 original salivation response.\nEventually, in fact, the dogs would salivate at the sight of Pavlov even if he did not feed them.\nThis change in the dogs\u2019 involuntary response, and especially its growing independence from the food as\nstimulus, eventually became the focus of Pavlov\u2019s research. Psychologists named the process respondent\nconditioning because it describes changes in responses to stimuli (though some have also called it \u201cclassical\nconditioning\u201d because it was historically the first form of behavioral learning to be studied systematically).\nRespondent conditioning has several elements, each with a special name. To understand these, look at and imagine\na dog (perhaps even mine, named Ginger) prior to any conditioning. At the beginning Ginger salivates (an\nunconditioned response (UR)) only when she actually tastes her dinner (an unconditioned stimulus\n(US)). As time goes by, however, a neutral stimulus\u2014such as the sound of opening a bag containing fresh dog food\n\u2014is continually paired with the eating/tasting experience. Eventually the neutral stimulus becomes able to elicit\nsalivation even before any dog food is offered to Ginger, or even if the bag of food is empty! At this point the neutral\nstimulus is called a conditioned stimulus (UCS) and the original response is renamed as a conditioned\nresponse (CR). Now, after conditioning, Ginger salivates merely at the sound of opening any large bag,\nregardless of its contents. (I might add that Ginger also engages in other conditioned responses, such as looking\nhopeful and following me around the house at dinner time.)\nBefore Conditioning:\n(UCS) Food\u2192 Salivation (UR)\n(UCS) Bell\u2192 No response (UR)\nDuring Conditioning:\nBell + Food\u2192 Salivation\nAfter Conditioning:\n(CS) Bell only\u2192 Salivation (CR)\nExhibit 1: Classical conditioning of Ginger, the dog. Before conditioning, Ginger salivates only to the taste of\nfood and the bell has no effect. After conditioning, she salivates even when the bell is presented by itself.\nRespondent Conditioning and Students\n\u201cOK,\u201d you may be thinking, \u201cRespondent conditioning may happen to animals. But does anything like it happen\nin classrooms?\u201d It might seem like not much would, since teaching is usually about influencing students\u2019 conscious\nwords and thoughts, and not their involuntary behaviors. But remember that schooling is not just about\nencouraging thinking and talking. Teachers, like parents and the public, also seek positive changes in students\u2019\nattitudes and feelings\u2014attitudes like a love for learning, for example, and feelings like self-confidence. It turns out\nthat respondent conditioning describes these kinds of changes relatively well.\n25 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nConsider, for example, a child who responds happily whenever meeting a new person who is warm and friendly,\nbut who also responds cautiously or at least neutrally in any new situation. Suppose further that the \u201cnew, friendly\nperson\u201d in question is you, his teacher. Initially the child\u2019s response to you is like an unconditioned stimulus: you\nsmile (the unconditioned stimulus) and in response he perks up, breathes easier, and smiles (the unconditioned\nresponse). This exchange is not the whole story, however, but merely the setting for an important bit of behavior\nchange: suppose you smile at him while standing in your classroom, a \u201cnew situation\u201d and therefore one to which\nhe normally responds cautiously. Now respondent learning can occur. The initially neutral stimulus (your\nclassroom) becomes associated repeatedly with the original unconditioned stimulus (your smile) and the child\u2019s\nunconditioned response (his smile). Eventually, if all goes well, the classroom becomes a conditioned stimulus in its\nown right: it can elicit the child\u2019s smiles and other \u201chappy behaviors\u201d even without your immediate presence or\nstimulus. Exhibit 2 diagrams the situation graphically. When the change in behavior happens, you might say that\nthe child has \u201clearned\u201d to like being in your classroom. Truly a pleasing outcome for both of you!\nBefore Conditioning:\n(UCS) Seeing Teacher Smile \u2192 Student Smiles (UR)\n(UCS) Seeing Classroom \u2192 No response (UR)\nDuring Conditioning:\nSeeing Teaching Smile + Seeing Classroom \u2192 Student Smiles\nAfter Conditioning:\n(CS) Seeing Classroom \u2192 Student Smiles (CR)\nExhibit 2: Respondent conditioning of student to classroom. Before conditioning, the student smiles only when\nhe sees the teacher smile, and the sight of the classroom has no effect. After conditioning, the student smiles at the\nsight of the classroom even without the teacher present.\nBut less positive or desirable examples of respondent conditioning also can happen. Consider a modification of\nthe example that I just gave. Suppose the child that I just mentioned did not have the good fortune of being placed\nin your classroom. Instead he found himself with a less likeable teacher, whom we could simply call Mr Horrible.\nInstead of smiling a lot and eliciting the child\u2019s unconditioned \u201chappy response\u201d, Mr Horrible often frowns and\nscowls at the child. In this case, therefore, the child\u2019s initial unconditioned response is negative: whenever Mr\nHorrible directs a frown or scowl at the child, the child automatically cringes a little, his eyes widen in fear, and his\nheart beat races. If the child sees Mr Horrible doing most of his frowning and scowling in the classroom, eventually\nthe classroom itself will acquire power as a negative conditioned stimulus. Eventually, that is, the child will not\nneed Mr Horrible to be present in order to feel apprehensive; simply being in the classroom will be enough. Exhibit\n3 diagrams this unfortunate situation. Obviously it is an outcome to be avoided, and in fact does not usually happen\nin such an extreme way. But hopefully it makes the point: any stimulus that is initially neutral, but that gets\nEducational Psychology 26 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nassociated with an unconditioned stimulus and response, can eventually acquire the ability to elicit the response by\nitself.

Before conditioning, the student cringes only\nwhen he sees Mr Horrible smile, and the sight of the classroom has no effect. After conditioning, the student\ncringes at the sight of the classroom even without Mr Horrible present.\nThe changes described in these two examples are important because they can affect students\u2019 attitude about\nschool, and therefore also their motivation to learn. In the positive case, the child becomes more inclined to please\nthe teacher and to attend to what he or she has to offer; in the negative case, the opposite occurs. Since the changes\nin attitude happen \u201cinside\u201d the child, they are best thought of as one way that a child can acquire i intrinsic\nmotivation, meaning a desire or tendency to direct attention and energy in a particular way that originates from\nthe child himself or herself. Intrinsic motivation is sometimes contrasted to extrinsic motivation, a tendency to\ndirect attention and energy that originates from outside of the child. As we will see, classical conditioning can\ninfluence students\u2019 intrinsic motivation in directions that are either positive or negative. As you might suspect,\nthere are other ways to influence motivation as well. Many of these are described in Chapter 6 (\u201cStudent\nmotivation\u201d). First, though, let us look at three other features of classical conditioning that complicate the picture a\nbit, but also render conditioning a bit more accurate, an appropriate description of students\u2019 learning.\nThree key ideas about respondent conditioning\nExtinction: This term does not refer to the fate of dinosaurs, but to the disappearance of a link between the\nconditioned stimulus and the conditioned response. Imagine a third variation on the conditioning \u201cstory\u201d described\nabove. Suppose, as I suggested above, that the child begins by associating your happy behaviors\u2014your smiles\u2014to\nhis being present in the classroom, so that the classroom itself becomes enough to elicit his own smiles. But now\nsuppose there is a sad turn of events: you become sick and must therefore leave the classroom in the middle of the\nschool year. A substitute is called in who is not Mr Horrible, but simply someone who is not very expressive,\nsomeone we can call Ms Neutral. At first the child continues to feel good (that is, to smile) whenever present in the\nclassroom. But because the link between the classroom and your particular smile is no longer repeated or\nassociated, the child\u2019s response gradually extinguishes, or fades until it has disappeared entirely. In a sense the\nchild\u2019s initial learning is \u201cunlearned\u201d.\n27 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nExtinction can also happen with negative examples of classical conditioning. If Mr Horrible leaves mid-year\n(perhaps because no one could stand working with him any longer!), then the child\u2019s negative responses (cringing,\neyes widening, heart beat racing, and so on) will also extinguish eventually. Note, though, that whether the\nconditioned stimulus is positive or negative, extinction does not happen suddenly or immediately, but unfolds over\ntime. This fact can sometimes obscure the process if you are a busy teacher attending to many students.\nGeneralization: When Pavlov studied conditioning in dogs, he noticed that the original conditioned stimulus\nwas not the only neutral stimulus that elicited the conditioned response. If he paired a particular bell with the sight\nof food, for example, so that the bell became a conditioned stimulus for salivation, then it turned out that other\nbells, perhaps with a different pitch or type or sound, also acquired some ability to trigger salivation\u2014though not as\nmuch as the original bell. Psychologists call this process generalization, or the tendency for similar stimuli to elicit a\nconditioned response. The child being conditioned to your smile, for example, might learn to associate your smile\nnot only with being present in your classroom, but also to being present in other, similar classrooms. His\nconditioned smiles may be strongest where he learned them initially (that is, in your own room), but nonetheless\nvisible to a significant extent in other teachers\u2019 classrooms. To the extent that this happens, he has generalized his\nlearning. It is of course good news; it means that we can say that the child is beginning to \u201clearn to like school\u201d in\ngeneral, and not just your particular room. Unfortunately, the opposite can also happen: if a child learns negative\nassociations from Mr Horrible, the child\u2019s fear, caution, and stress might generalize to other classrooms as well. The\nlesson for teachers is therefore clear: we have a responsibility, wherever possible, to make classrooms pleasant\nplaces to be.\nDiscrimination: Generalization among similar stimuli can be reduced if only one of the similar stimuli is\nassociated consistently with the unconditioned response, while the others are not. When this happens,\npsychologists say that discrimination learning has occurred, meaning that the individual has learned to\ndistinguish or respond differently to one stimulus than to another. From an educational point of view,\ndiscrimination learning can be either desirable or not, depending on the particulars of the situation. Imagine again\n(for the fourth time!) the child who learns to associate your classroom with your smiles, so that he eventually\nproduces smiles of his own whenever present in your room. But now imagine yet another variation on his story: the\nchild is old enough to attend middle school, and therefore has several teachers across the day. You\u2014with your\nsmiles\u2014are one, but so are Mr Horrible and Ms Neutral. At first the child may generalize his classically conditioned\nsmiles to the other teachers\u2019 classrooms. But the other teachers do not smile like you do, and this fact causes the\nchild\u2019s smiling to extinguish somewhat in their rooms. Meanwhile, you keep smiling in your room. Eventually the\nchild is smiling only in your room and not in the other rooms. When this happens, we say that discrimination has\noccurred, meaning that the conditioned associations happen only to a single version of the unconditioned stimuli\u2014\nin this case, only to your smiles, and not to the (rather rare) occurrences of smiles in the other classrooms. Judging\nby his behavior, the child is making a distinction between your room and others.\nIn one sense the discrimination in this story is unfortunate in that it prevents the child from acquiring a liking\nfor school that is generalized. But notice that an opposing, more desirable process is happening at the same time:\nthe child is also prevented from acquiring a generalized dislike of school. The fear-producing stimuli from Mr\nHorrible, in particular, become discriminated from the happiness-producing smiles from you, so the child\u2019s learns\nto confine his fearful responses to that particular classroom, and does not generalize them to other \u201cinnocent\u201d\nEducational Psychology 28 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nclassrooms, including your own. This is still not an ideal situation for the student, but maybe it is more desirable\nthan disliking school altogether.\nOperant conditioning: new behaviors because of new consequences\nInstead of focusing on associations between stimuli and responses, operant conditioning focuses on how the\neffects of consequences on behaviors. The operant model of learning begins with the idea that certain consequences\ntend to make certain behaviors happen more frequently. If I compliment a student for a good comment during a\ndiscussion, there is more of a chance that I will hear comments from the student more often in the future (and\nhopefully they will also be good ones!). If a student tells a joke to several classmates and they laugh at it, then the\nstudent is more likely to tell additional jokes in the future and so on.\nAs with respondent conditioning, the original research about this model of learning was not done with people,\nbut with animals. One of the pioneers in the field was a Harvard professor named B. F. Skinner, who published\nnumerous books and articles about the details of the process and who pointed out many parallels between operant\nconditioning in animals and operant conditioning in humans (1938, 1948, 1988). Skinner observed the behavior of\nrather tame laboratory rats (not the unpleasant kind that sometimes live in garbage dumps). He or his assistants\nwould put them in a cage that contained little except a lever and a small tray just big enough to hold a small amount\nof food. (Exhibit 4 shows the basic set-up, which is sometimes nicknamed a \u201cSkinner box\u201d.) At first the rat would\nsniff and \u201cputter around\u201d the cage at random, but sooner or later it would happen upon the lever and eventually\nhappen to press it. Presto! The lever released a small pellet of food, which the rat would promptly eat. Gradually the\nrat would spend more time near the lever and press the lever more frequently, getting food more frequently.\nEventually it would spend most of its time at the lever and eating its fill of food. The rat had \u201cdiscovered\u201d that the\nconsequence of pressing the level was to receive food. Skinner called the changes in the rat\u2019s behavior an example of\noperant conditioning, and gave special names to the different parts of the process. He called the food pellets the\nreinforcement and the lever-pressing the operant (because it \u201coperated\u201d on the rat\u2019s environment). See below.\nOperant \u2192 Reinforcement\nPress lever \u2192 Food pellet\nExhibit 4: Operant conditioning with a laboratory rat\nSkinner and other behavioral psychologists experimented with using various reinforcers and operants. They also\nexperimented with various patterns of reinforcement (or schedules of reinforcement), as well as with various\n29 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ncues or signals to the animal about when reinforcement was available. It turned out that all of these factors\u2014the\noperant, the reinforcement, the schedule, and the cues\u2014affected how easily and thoroughly operant conditioning\noccurred. For example, reinforcement was more effective if it came immediately after the crucial operant behavior,\nrather than being delayed, and reinforcements that happened intermittently (only part of the time) caused learning\nto take longer, but also caused it to last longer.\nOperant conditioning and students\u2019 learning: As with respondent conditioning, it is important to ask\nwhether operant conditioning also describes learning in human beings, and especially in students in classrooms. On\nthis point the answer seems to be clearly \u201cyes\u201d. There are countless classroom examples of consequences affecting\nstudents\u2019 behavior in ways that resemble operant conditioning, although the process certainly does not account for\nall forms of student learning (Alberto & Troutman, 2005). Consider the following examples. In most of them the\noperant behavior tends to become more frequent on repeated occasions:\n\u2022 A seventh-grade boy makes a silly face (the operant) at the girl sitting next to him. Classmates sitting around\nthem giggle in response (the reinforcement).\n\u2022 A kindergarten child raises her hand in response to the teacher\u2019s question about a story (the operant). The\nteacher calls on her and she makes her comment (the reinforcement).\n\u2022 Another kindergarten child blurts out her comment without being called on (the operant). The teacher frowns,\nignores this behavior, but before the teacher calls on a different student, classmates are listening attentively\n(the reinforcement) to the student even though he did not raise his hand as he should have.\n\u2022 A twelfth-grade student\u2014a member of the track team\u2014runs one mile during practice (the operant). He notes\nthe time it takes him as well as his increase in speed since joining the team (the reinforcement).\n\u2022 A child who is usually very restless sits for five minutes doing an assignment (the operant). The teaching\nassistant compliments him for working hard (the reinforcement).\n\u2022 A sixth-grader takes home a book from the classroom library to read overnight (the operant). When she\nreturns the book the next morning, her teacher puts a gold star by her name on a chart posted in the room (the\nreinforcement).\nHopefully these examples are enough to make four points about operant conditioning. First, the process is\nwidespread in classrooms\u2014probably more widespread than respondent conditioning. This fact makes sense, given\nthe nature of public education: to a large extent, teaching is about making certain consequences for students (like\npraise or marks) depend on students\u2019 engaging in certain activities (like reading certain material or doing\nassignments). Second, learning by operant conditioning is not confined to any particular grade, subject area, or\nstyle of teaching, but by nature happens in nearly every imaginable classroom. Third, teachers are not the only\npersons controlling reinforcements. Sometimes they are controlled by the activity itself (as in the track team\nexample), or by classmates (as in the \u201cgiggling\u201d example). A result of all of the above points is the fourth: that\nmultiple examples of operant conditioning often happen at the same time. The skill builder for this chapter (The\ndecline and fall of Jane Gladstone) suggests how this happened to someone completing student teaching.\nEducational Psychology 30 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nBecause operant conditioning happens so widely, its effects on motivation are a bit more complex than the\neffects of respondent conditioning. As in respondent conditioning, operant conditioning can encourage intrinsic\nmotivation to the extent that the reinforcement for an activity can sometimes be the activity itself. When a student\nreads a book for the sheer enjoyment of reading, for example, he is reinforced by the reading itself; then we often\nsay that his reading is \u201cintrinsically motivated\u201d. More often, however, operant conditioning stimulates both\nintrinsic and extrinsic motivation at the same time. The combining of both is noticeable in the examples that I\nlisted above. In each example, it is reasonable to assume that the student felt intrinsically motivated to some partial\nextent, even when reward came from outside the student as well. This was because part of what reinforced their\nbehavior was the behavior itself\u2014whether it was making faces, running a mile, or contributing to a discussion. At\nthe same time, though, note that each student probably was also extrinsically motivated, meaning that another\npart of the reinforcement came from consequences or experiences not inherently part of the activity or behavior\nitself. The boy who made a face was reinforced not only by the pleasure of making a face, for example, but also by\nthe giggles of classmates. The track student was reinforced not only by the pleasure of running itself, but also by\nknowledge of his improved times and speeds. Even the usually restless child sitting still for five minutes may have\nbeen reinforced partly by this brief experience of unusually focused activity, even if he was also reinforced by the\nteacher aide\u2019s compliment. Note that the extrinsic part of the reinforcement may sometimes be more easily\nobserved or noticed than the intrinsic part, which by definition may sometimes only be experienced within the\nindividual and not also displayed outwardly. This latter fact may contribute to an impression that sometimes\noccurs, that operant conditioning is really just \u201cbribery in disguise\u201d, that only the external reinforcements operate\non students\u2019 behavior. It is true that external reinforcement may sometimes alter the nature or strength of internal\n(or intrinsic) reinforcement, but this is not the same as saying that it destroys or replaces intrinsic reinforcement.\nBut more about this issue later! (See especially Chapter 6, \u201cStudent motivation\u201d.)\nComparing operant conditioning and respondent conditioning: Operant conditioning is made more\ncomplicated, but also more realistic, by many of the same concepts as used in respondent conditioning. In most\ncases, however, the additional concepts have slightly different meanings in each model of learning. Since this\ncircumstance can make the terms confusing, let me explain the differences for three major concepts used in both\nmodels\u2014extinction, generalization, and discrimination. Then I will comment on two additional concepts\u2014\nschedules of reinforcement and cues\u2014that are sometimes also used in talking about both forms of conditioning, but\nthat are important primarily for understanding operant conditioning. The explanations and comments are also\nsummarized in Table 2.\nTable 3: Comparison of terms common to operant and respondent conditioning\nTerm As defined in respondent conditioning As defined in operant\nconditioning\nExtinction Disappearance of an association between a Disappearance of the operant\nconditioned stimulus and a conditioned behavior due to lack of\nresponse reinforcement\nGeneralization Ability of stimulus similar to the conditioned Tendency of behaviors similar to\nstimulus to elicit the conditioned response operant to be conditioned along with\n31 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthe original operant\nDiscrimination Learning not to respond to stimuli that are Learning not to emit behaviors that\nsimilar to the originally conditioned stimulus are similar to the originally\nconditioned operant\nSchedule of Reinforcement The pattern or frequency by which a CS is The pattern or frequency by which a\npaired with the UCS during learning reinforcement is a consequence of\nan operant during learning\nCue Not applicable Stimulus prior to the operant that\nsignals the availability or not of\nreinforcement\nIn both respondent and operant conditioning, extinction refers to the disappearance of \u201csomething\u201d. In\noperant conditioning, what disappears is the operant behavior because of a lack of reinforcement. A student who\nstops receiving gold stars or compliments for prolific reading of library books, for example, may extinguish (i.e.\ndecrease or stop) book-reading behavior. In respondent conditioning, on the other hand, what disappears is\nassociation between the conditioned stimulus (the CS) and the conditioned response (CR). If you stop smiling at a\nstudent, then the student may extinguish her association between you and her pleasurable response to your smile,\nor between your classroom and the student\u2019s pleasurable response to your smile.\nIn both forms of conditioning, generalization means that something \u201cextra\u201d gets conditioned if it is somehow\nsimilar to \u201csomething\u201d. In operant conditioning, the extra conditioning is to behaviors similar to the original\noperant. If getting gold stars results in my reading more library books, then I may generalize this behavior to other\nsimilar activities, such as reading the newspaper, even if the activity is not reinforced directly. In respondent\nconditioning, however, the extra conditioning refers to stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus. If I am a\nstudent and I respond happily to my teacher\u2019s smiles, then I may find myself responding happily to other people\n(like my other teachers) to some extent, even if they do not smile at me. Generalization is a lot like the concept of\ntransfer that I discussed early in this chapter, in that it is about extending prior learning to new situations or\ncontexts. From the perspective of operant conditioning, though, what is being extended (or \u201ctransferred\u201d or\ngeneralized) is a behavior, not knowledge or skill.\nIn both forms of conditioning, discrimination means learning not to generalize. In operant conditioning,\nthough, what is not being overgeneralized is the operant behavior. If I am a student who is being complimented\n(reinforced) for contributing to discussions, I must also learn to discriminate when to make verbal contributions\nfrom when not to make verbal contributions\u2014such as when classmates or the teacher are busy with other tasks. In\nrespondent conditioning, what are not being overgeneralized are the conditioned stimuli that elicit the conditioned\nresponse. If I, as a student, learn to associate the mere sight of a smiling teacher with my own happy, contented\nbehavior, then I also have to learn not to associate this same happy response with similar, but slightly different\nsights, such as a teacher looking annoyed.\nEducational Psychology 32 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nIn both forms of conditioning, the schedule of reinforcement refers to the pattern or frequency by which\n\u201csomething\u201d is paired with \u201csomething else\u201d. In operant conditioning, what is being paired is the pattern by which\nreinforcement is linked with the operant. If a teacher praises me for my work, does she do it every time, or only\nsometimes? Frequently or only once in awhile? In respondent conditioning, however, the schedule in question is\nthe pattern by which the conditioned stimulus is paired with the unconditioned stimulus. If I am student with Mr\nHorrible as my teacher, does he scowl every time he is in the classroom, or only sometimes? Frequently or rarely?\nBehavioral psychologists have studied schedules of reinforcement extensively (for example, Ferster, et al., 1997;\nMazur, 2005), and found a number of interesting effects of different schedules. For teachers, however, the most\nimportant finding may be this: partial or intermittent schedules of reinforcement generally cause learning to take\nlonger, but also cause extinction of learning to take longer. This dual principle is important for teachers because so\nmuch of the reinforcement we give is partial or intermittent. Typically, if I am teaching, I can compliment a student\na lot of the time, for example, but there will inevitably be occasions when I cannot do so because I am busy\nelsewhere in the classroom. For teachers concerned both about motivating students and about minimizing\ninappropriate behaviors, this is both good news and bad. The good news is that the benefits of my praising students\u2019\nconstructive behavior will be more lasting, because they will not extinguish their constructive behaviors\nimmediately if I fail to support them every single time they happen. The bad news is that students\u2019 negative\nbehaviors may take longer to extinguish as well, because those too may have developed through partial\nreinforcement. A student who clowns around inappropriately in class, for example, may not be \u201csupported\u201d by\nclassmates\u2019 laughter every time it happens, but only some of the time. Once the inappropriate behavior is learned,\nthough, it will take somewhat longer to disappear even if everyone\u2014both teacher and classmates\u2014make a concerted\neffort to ignore (or extinguish) it.\nFinally, behavioral psychologists have studied the effects of cues. In operant conditioning, a cue is a stimulus\nthat happens just prior to the operant behavior and that signals that performing the behavior may lead to\nreinforcement. Its effect is much like discrimination learning in respondent conditioning, except that what is\n\u201cdiscriminated\u201d in this case is not a conditioned behavior that is reflex-like, but a voluntary action, the operant. In\nthe original conditioning experiments, Skinner\u2019s rats were sometimes cued by the presence or absence of a small\nelectric light in their cage. Reinforcement was associated with pressing a lever when, and only when, the light was\non. In classrooms, cues are sometimes provided by the teacher or simply by the established routines of the class.\nCalling on a student to speak, for example, can be a cue that if the student does say something at that moment, then\nhe or she may be reinforced with praise or acknowledgment. But if that cue does not occur\u2014if the student is not\ncalled on\u2014speaking may not be rewarded. In more everyday, non-behaviorist terms, the cue allows the student to\nlearn when it is acceptable to speak, and when it is not.\nConstructivism: changes in how students think\nBehaviorist models of learning may be helpful in understanding and influencing what students do, but teachers\nusually also want to know what students are thinking, and how to enrich what students are thinking. For this goal\nof teaching, some of the best help comes from constructivism, which is a perspective on learning focused on how\nstudents actively create (or \u201cconstruct\u201d) knowledge out of experiences. Constructivist models of learning differ\nabout how much a learner constructs knowledge independently, compared to how much he or she takes cues from\npeople who may be more of an expert and who help the learner's efforts (Fosnot, 2005; Rockmore, 2005). For\n33 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nconvenience these are called psychological constructivism and social constructivism, even though both\nversions are in a sense explanations about thinking within individuals.\nPsychological constructivism: the independent investigator\nThe main idea of psychological constructivism is that a person learns by mentally organizing and reorganizing\nnew information or experiences. The organization happens partly by relating new experiences to prior knowledge\nthat is already meaningful and well understood. Stated in this general form, individual constructivism is sometimes\nassociated with a well-known educational philosopher of the early twentieth century, John Dewey (1938-1998).\nAlthough Dewey himself did not use the term constructivism in most of his writing, his point of view amounted to a\ntype of constructivism, and he discussed in detail its implications for educators. He argued, for example, that if\nstudents indeed learn primarily by building their own knowledge, then teachers should adjust the curriculum to fit\nstudents\u2019 prior knowledge and interests as fully as possible. He also argued that a curriculum could only be justified\nif it related as fully as possible to the activities and responsibilities that students will probably have later, after\nleaving school. To many educators these days, his ideas may seem merely like good common sense, but they were\nindeed innovative and progressive at the beginning of the twentieth century.\nA more recent example of psychological constructivism is the cognitive theory of Jean Piaget (Piaget, 2001;\nGruber & Voneche, 1995). Piaget described learning as interplay between two mental activities that he called\nassimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is the interpretation of new information in terms of pre-existing\nconcepts, information or ideas. A preschool child who already understands the concept of bird, for example, might\ninitially label any flying object with this term\u2014even butterflies or mosquitoes. Assimilation is therefore a bit like the\nidea of generalization in operant conditioning, or the idea of transfer described at the beginning of this chapter. In\nPiaget\u2019s viewpoint, though, what is being transferred to a new setting is not simply a behavior (Skinner's \u201coperant\u201d\nin operant conditioning), but a mental representation for an object or experience.\nAssimilation operates jointly with accommodation, which is the revision or modification of pre-existing\nconcepts in terms of new information or experience. The preschooler who initially generalizes the concept of bird to\ninclude any flying object, for example, eventually revises the concept to include only particular kinds of flying\nobjects, such as robins and sparrows, and not others, like mosquitoes or airplanes. For Piaget, assimilation and\naccommodation work together to enrich a child\u2019s thinking and to create what Piaget called cognitive\nequilibrium, which is a balance between reliance on prior information and openness to new information. At any\ngiven time, cognitive equilibrium consists of an ever-growing repertoire of mental representations for objects and\nexperiences. Piaget called each mental representation a schema (all of them together\u2014the plural\u2014was called\nschemata). A schema was not merely a concept, but an elaborated mixture of vocabulary, actions, and experience\nrelated to the concept. A child\u2019s schema for bird, for example, includes not only the relevant verbal knowledge (like\nknowing how to define the word \u201cbird\u201d), but also the child\u2019s experiences with birds, pictures of birds, and\nconversations about birds. As assimilation and accommodation about birds and other flying objects operate\ntogether over time, the child does not just revise and add to his vocabulary (such as acquiring a new word,\n\u201cbutterfly\u201d), but also adds and remembers relevant new experiences and actions. From these collective revisions\nand additions the child gradually constructs whole new schemata about birds, butterflies, and other flying objects.\nIn more everyday (but also less precise) terms, Piaget might then say that \u201cthe child has learned more about birds\u201d.\nEducational Psychology 34 A Global Text 2. The learning process\nThe upper part of Exhibit 5 diagrams the relationships among the Piagetian version of psychological\nconstructivist learning. Note that the model of learning in the Exhibit is rather \u201cindividualistic\u201d, in the sense that it\ndoes not say much about how other people involved with the learner might assist in assimilating or accommodating\ninformation. Parents and teachers, it would seem, are left lingering on the sidelines, with few significant\nresponsibilities for helping learners to construct knowledge. But the Piagetian picture does nonetheless imply a role\nfor helpful others: someone, after all, has to tell or model the vocabulary needed to talk about and compare birds\nfrom airplanes and butterflies! Piaget did recognize the importance of helpful others in his writings and theorizing,\ncalling the process of support or assistance social transmission. But he did not emphasize this aspect of\nconstructivism. Piaget was more interested in what children and youth could figure out on their own, so to speak,\nthan in how teachers or parents might be able to help the young to figure out (Salkind, 2004). Partly for this reason,\nhis theory is often considered less about learning and more about development, which is long-term change in a\nperson resulting from multiple experiences. For the same reason, educators have often found Piaget\u2019s ideas\nespecially helpful for thinking about students\u2019 readiness to learn, another one of the lasting educational issues that\nI discussed at the beginning of this chapter. I will therefore return to Piaget later to discuss development and its\nimportance for teaching in more detail.\nLearning According to Piaget:\nAssimilation + Accommodation \u2192 Equilibrium \u2192 Schemata\nLearning According to Vygotsky:\nNovice \u2192Zone of Proximal Development \u2190 Expert\n(ZPD)\nExhibit 5: Constructivist models of learning\nSocial Constructivism: assisted performance\nUnlike Piaget\u2019s rather individually oriented version of constructivism, some psychologists and educators have\nexplicitly focused on the relationships and interactions between a learner and more knowledgeable and experienced\nindividuals. One early expression of this viewpoint came from the American psychologist Jerome Bruner (1960,\n1966, 1996), who became convinced that students could usually learn more than had been traditionally expected as\nlong as they were given appropriate guidance and resources. He called such support instructional scaffolding\u2014\nliterally meaning a temporary framework, like one used in constructing a building, that allows a much stronger\nstructure to be built within it. In a comment that has been quoted widely (and sometimes disputed), he wrote: \u201cWe\n[constructivist educators] begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually\nhonest form to any child at any stage of development.\u201d (1960, p. 33). The reason for such a bold assertion was\nBruner\u2019s belief in scaffolding\u2014his belief in the importance of providing guidance in the right way and at the right\ntime. When scaffolding is provided, students seem more competent and \u201cintelligent,\u201d and they learn more.\nSimilar ideas were proposed independently by the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1978), whose writing\nfocused on how a child\u2019s or novice\u2019s thinking is influenced by relationships with others who are more capable,\n35 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nknowledgeable, or expert than the learner. Vygotsky proposed that when a child (or any novice) is learning a new\nskill or solving a new problem, he or she can perform better if accompanied and helped by an expert than if\nperforming alone\u2014though still not as well as the expert. Someone who has played very little chess, for example, will\nprobably compete against an opponent better if helped by an expert chess player than if competing alone against an\nopponent. Vygotsky called the difference between solo performance and assisted performance the zone of\nproximal development (or ZPD for short)\u2014meaning the place or area (figuratively speaking) of immediate\nchange. From this perspective learning is like assisted performance (Tharp & Gallimore, 1991). Initially during\nlearning, knowledge or skill is found mostly \u201cin\u201d the expert helper. If the expert is skilled and motivated to help,\nthen the expert arranges experiences that allow the novice to practice crucial skills or to construct new knowledge.\nIn this regard the expert is a bit like the coach of an athlete\u2014offering help and suggesting ways of practicing, but\nnever doing the actual athletic work himself or herself. Gradually, by providing continued experiences matched to\nthe novice learner\u2019s emerging competencies, the expert-coach makes it possible for the novice or apprentice to\nappropriate (or make his or her own) the skills or knowledge that originally resided only with the expert. These\nrelationships are diagrammed in the lower part of Exhibit 5.\nIn both the psychological and social versions of constructivist learning, the novice is not really \u201ctaught\u201d so much\nas just allowed to learn. The social version of constructivism, however, highlights the responsibility of the expert for\nmaking learning possible. He or she must not only have knowledge and skill, but also know how to arrange\nexperiences that make it easy and safe for learners to gain knowledge and skill themselves. These requirements\nsound, of course, a lot like the requirements for classroom teaching. In addition to knowing what is to be learned,\nthe expert (i.e. the teacher) also has to break the content into manageable parts, offer the parts in a sensible\nsequence, provide for suitable and successful practice, bring the parts back together again at the end, and somehow\nrelate the entire experience to knowledge and skills already meaningful to the learner. But of course, no one said\nthat teaching is easy!\nImplications of constructivism for teaching\nFortunately there are strategies that teachers can use for giving students this kind of help\u2014in fact they constitute\na major portion of this book, and are a major theme throughout the entire preservice teacher education programs.\nFor now, let me just point briefly to two of them, saving a complete discussion for later. One strategy that teachers\noften find helpful is to organize the content to be learned as systematically as possible, because doing this allows the\nteacher to select and devise learning activities that are more effective. One of the most widely used frameworks for\norganizing content, for example, is a classification scheme proposed by the educator Benjamin Bloom, published\nwith the somewhat imposing title of Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook #1: Cognitive Domain\n(Bloom, et al., 1956; Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). Bloom\u2019s taxonomy, as it is usually called, describes six kinds\nof learning goals that teachers can in principle expect from students, ranging from simple recall of knowledge to\ncomplex evaluation of knowledge. (The levels are defined briefly in Table 2.3 with examples from Goldilocks and\nthe Three Bears.)\nBloom\u2019s taxonomy makes useful distinctions among possible kinds of knowledge needed by students, and\ntherefore potentially helps in selecting activities that truly target students\u2019 \u201czones of proximal development\u201d in the\nsense meant by Vygotsky. A student who knows few terms for the species studied in biology unit (a problem at\nBloom\u2019s knowledge and comprehension levels), for example, may initially need support at remembering and\nEducational Psychology 36 A Global Text 2. The learning process\ndefining the terms before he or she can make useful comparisons among species (Bloom\u2019s analysis level).\nPinpointing the most appropriate learning activities to accomplish this objective remains the job of the teacher-\nexpert (that\u2019s you), but the learning itself has to be accomplished by the student. Put in more social constructivist\nterms, the teacher arranges a zone of proximal development that allows the student to compare species\nsuccessfully, but the student still has to construct or appropriate the comparisons for him or herself.\nTable 4: Bloom\u2019s taxonomy of educational objectives: cognitive domain\nCategory or type of Definition Example\nthinking\n(with apologies to Goldilocks\nand her bear friends!)\nKnowledge Remembering or recalling facts, List three things Goldilocks did in\ninformation, or procedures the three bears\u2019 house.\nComprehension Understanding facts, interpreting Explain why Goldilocks liked the\ninformation little bear\u2019s chair the best.\nApplication Using concepts in new situations, Predict some of the things that\nsolving particular problems Goldilocks might have used if she\nhad entered your house.\nAnalysis Distinguish parts of information, a Select the part of the story where\nconcept, or a procedure Goldilocks seemed most\ncomfortable.\nSynthesis Combining elements or parts into a new Tell how the story would have been\nobject, idea, or procedure different if it had been about three\nfishes.\nEvaluation Assessing and judging the value or Decide whether Goldilocks was a\nideas, objects, or materials in a bad girl, and justify your position.\nparticular situation\nA second strategy may be coupled with the first. As students gain experience as students, they become able to\nthink about how they themselves learn best, and you (as the teacher) can encourage such self-reflection as one of\nyour goals for their learning. These changes allow you to transfer some of your responsibilities for arranging\nlearning to the students themselves. For the biology student mentioned above, for example, you may be able not\nonly to plan activities that support comparing species, but also to devise ways for the student to think about how he\nor she might learn the same information independently. The resulting self-assessment and self-direction of learning\noften goes by the name of metacognition\u2014an ability to think about and regulate one\u2019s own thinking (Israel,\n2005). Metacognition can sometimes be difficult for students to achieve, but it is an important goal for social\nconstructivist learning because it gradually frees learners from dependence on expert teachers to guide their\nlearning. Reflective learners, you might say, become their own expert guides. Like with using Bloom\u2019s taxonomy,\n37 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthough, promoting metacognition and self-directed learning is important enough that I will come back to it later in\nmore detail (especially in Chapter 9, \u201cFacilitating complex thinking\u201d).\nBy assigning a more visible role to expert helpers\u2014and by implication also to teachers\u2014than does the\npsychological constructivism, social constructivism is seemingly more complete as a description of what teachers\nusually do in classrooms, and of what they usually hope students will experience there. As we will see in the next\nchapter, however, there are more uses to a theory than whether it describes the moment-to-moment interactions\nbetween teacher and students. As I explain there, some theories can be helpful for planning instruction rather than\nfor doing it. It turns out that this is the case for psychological constructivism, which offers important ideas about\nthe appropriate sequencing of learning and development. This fact makes the psychological constructivism valuable\nin its own way, even though it (and a few other learning theories as well) seem to \u201comit\u201d mentioning teachers,\nparents, or experts in detail. So do not make up your mind about the relative merits of different learning theories\nyet!\nChapter summary\nAlthough the term learning has many possible meanings, the term as used by teachers emphasizes its\nrelationship to curriculum, to teaching, and to the issues of sequencing, readiness, and transfer. Viewed in this\nlight, the two major psychological perspectives of learning\u2014behaviorist and constructivist\u2014have important ideas to\noffer educators. Within the behaviorist perspective are two major theories or models of learning, called respondent\nconditioning and operant conditioning. Respondent conditioning describes how previously neutral associations can\nacquire the power to elicit significant responses in students. Operant conditioning describes how the consequences\nand cues for a behavior can cause the behavior to become more frequent. In either case, from a teacher\u2019s point of\nview, the learned behaviors or responses can be either desirable or unwanted.\nThe other major psychological perspective\u2014constructivism\u2014describes how individuals build or \u201cconstruct\u201d\nknowledge by engaging actively with their experiences. The psychological version of constructivism emphasizes the\nlearners\u2019 individual responses to experience\u2014their tendency both to assimilate it and to accommodate to it. The\nsocial version of constructivism emphasizes how other, more expert individuals can create opportunities for the\nlearner to construct new knowledge. Social constructivism suggests that a teacher\u2019s role must include deliberate\ninstructional planning, such as facilitated by Bloom\u2019s taxonomy of learning objectives, but also that teachers need to\nencourage metacognition, which is students\u2019 ability to monitor their own learning.\nOn the Internet\n<http://seab.envmed.rochester.edu/jaba> This is the website for the Journal of Applied Behavior\nAnalysis, and as such it is an excellent source of examples of how behaviorist learning principles can be applied to a\nwide variety of behavior-related difficulties.

Student development\nWhen one of our authors (Kelvin Seifert) was growing up, he was provided with piano lessons. Daily\npractice was a staple of childhood--365 days a year, and in a home that was deliberately kept quiet\nto facilitate practice. Music\u2014especially the piano\u2014defined a major part of his emerging self-identity.\nAltogether he studied piano for 13 years, from age 4 to the end of high school, with only occasional\ninterruptions.\nAt any one time, Kelvin witnessed small changes in his skills. He performed a simple piece a bit\nbetter than he had the previous week, or he played more of it from memory. There were direct,\nobvious connections between his skills at one moment and at the moment just before or after. Back\nthen, if you had asked him what accounted for the changes, he would have stated without hesitation\nthat they were because he was \u201clearning\u201d specific piano pieces.\nAcross broader spans of time, however, he noticed changes that were more dramatic. Kelvin learned\nmuch more complex pieces than he had several years earlier, for example. He also played with\nsignificantly more \u201cfinesse\u201d, sensitivity and polish than as a young child. He was even listening to\nclassical music on the radio some of the time! Kelvin's musical talent became transformed over the\nlong term, and in some sense he did not have the \u201csame\u201d talent that he had had as a beginner.\nIf you had asked what accounted for these longer-term changes, he would have had a harder time\nanswering than when asked about the short-term changes. He might have said simply and a bit\nvaguely: \u201cI have been getting better at piano.\u201d If you ask the same question now, however, he would\nsay that his music skills had developed, that their development had been slow and gradual, and\nthat the changes resulted not just from simple practice, but also from becoming more widely skilled\nabout music in general.\nDevelopment refers to long-term personal changes that have multiple sources and multiple effects. It is like\nthe difference between Kelvin's music at age fifteen compared to his music at age five, rather than the difference\nbetween his music one week and his music the next. Some human developments are especially broad and take years\nto unfold fully; a person's ever-evolving ability to \u201cread\u201d other's moods, for example, may take a lifetime to develop\nfully. Other developments are faster and more focused, like a person's increasing skill at solving crossword puzzles.\nThe faster and simpler is the change, the more likely we are to call the change \u201clearning\u201d instead of development.\nThe difference between learning and development is a matter of degree. When a child learns to name the planets of\nthe solar system, for example, the child may not need a lot of time, nor does the learning involve a multitude of\nexperiences. So it is probably better to think of that particular experience\u2014learning to name the planets\u2014as an\nexample of learning rather than of development (Salkind, 2004; Lewis, 1997).\nEducational Psychology 41 A Global Text 3. Student development\nWhy development matters\nStudents\u2019 development matters for teachers, but the way it matters depends partly on how schooling is\norganized. In teaching a single, \u201cself-contained\u201d grade-level, the benefits of knowing about development will be less\nexplicit, but just as real, as if you teach many grade levels. Working exclusively with a single grade (like, say, a third-\ngrade classroom) highlights differences among students that happen in spite of their similar ages, and obscures\nsimilarities that happen because of having similar ages. Under these conditions it is still easy to notice students\u2019\ndiversity, but harder to know how much of it comes from differences in long-term development, compared to\ndifferences in short-term experiences. Knowledge about long term changes is still useful, however, in planning\nappropriate activities and in holding appropriate expectations about students. What changes in students can you\nexpect relatively soon simply from your current program of activities, and which ones may take a year or more to\nshow up? This is a question that developmental psychology can help to answer.\nIf you teach multiple grade levels, as often is true of specialists or teachers in middle school or high school, then\nyour need for developmental knowledge will be more obvious because you will confront wide age differences on a\ndaily basis. As a physical education teacher, for example, you may teach kindergarten children at one time during\nthe day, but sixth-graders at another time, or teach seventh-graders at one time but twelfth-graders at another.\nStudents will differ more obviously because of age, in addition to differing because of other factors like their skills\nor knowledge learned recently. Nonetheless, the instructional challenge will be the same as the one faced by\nteachers of single-grade classes: you will want to know what activities and expectations are appropriate for your\nstudents. To answer this question, you will need to know something not only about how your students are unique,\nbut also about general trends of development during childhood and adolescence.\nNote that developmental trends vary in two important ways. The first, as indicated already, is in their generality.\nSome theories or models of development boldly assert that certain changes happen to virtually every person on the\nplanet, and often at relatively predictable points in life. For example, a theory might assert that virtually every\ntoddler acquires a spoken language, or that every teenager forms a sense of personal identity. Individuals who do\nnot experience these developments would be rare, though not necessarily disabled as a result. Other theories\npropose developmental changes that are more limited, claiming only that the changes happen to some people or\nonly under certain conditions. Developing a female gender role, for example, does not happen to everyone, but only\nto the females in a population, and the details vary according to the family, community, or society in which a child\nlives.\nThe second way that developmental trends vary is in how strictly they are sequenced and hierarchical. In some\nviews of development, changes are thought to happen in a specific order and to build on each other\u2014sort of a\n\u201cstaircase\u201d model of development (Case, 1991, 1996). For example, a developmental psychologist (and many of the\nrest of us) might argue that young people must have tangible, hands-on experience with new materials before they\ncan reason about the materials in the abstract. The order cannot be reversed. In other views of development, change\nhappens, but not with a sequence or end point that is uniform. This sort of change is more like a \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d\nthan a staircase (Levinson, 1990; Lewis, 1997; Harris, 2006). A person who becomes permanently disabled, for\nexample, may experience complex long-term changes in personal values and priorities that are different both in\ntiming and content from most people's developmental pathway.\n42 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn general, educational psychologists have tended to emphasize explanations of development that are relatively\ngeneral, universal and sequential, rather than specific to particular cultures or that are unsequenced and\nkaleidoscopic (see, for example, Woolfolk, 2006, Chapter 3; or Slavin, 2005, Chapters 8 and 9). Such models\n(sometimes called \u201cgrand theories\u201d) have the advantage of concisely integrating many features of development,\nwhile also describing the kind of people children or adolescents usually end up to be. The preference for integrative\nperspectives makes sense given educators\u2019 need to work with and teach large numbers of diverse students both\nefficiently and effectively. But the approach also risks overgeneralizing or oversimplifying the experiences of\nparticular children and youth. It can also confuse what does happen as certain children (like the middle-class ones)\ndevelop with what should happen to children. To understand this point, imagine two children of about the same age\nwho have dramatically very different childhood experiences\u2014for example, one who grows up in poverty and\nanother who grows up financially well-off. In what sense can we say that these two children experience the same\nunderlying developmental changes as they grow up? And how much should they even be expected to do so?\nDevelopmental psychology, and especially the broad theories of developmental psychology, highlight the\n\u201csameness\u201d or common ground between these two children. As such, it serves as counterpoint to knowledge of their\nobvious uniqueness, and places their uniqueness in broader perspective.\nPhysical development during the school years\nAlthough it may be tempting to think that physical development is the concern of physical education teachers\nonly, it is actually a foundation for many academic tasks. In first grade, for example, it is important to know\nwhether children can successfully manipulate a pencil. In later grades, it is important to know how long students\ncan be expected to sit still without discomfort\u2014a real physical challenge. In all grades, it is important to have a\nsense of students\u2019 health needs related to their age or maturity, if only to know who may become ill, and with what\nillness, and to know what physical activities are reasonable and needed.\nTrends in height and weight\nTypical height and weight for well-nourished, healthy students are shown in Table 9. The figure shows averages\nfor several ages from preschool through the end of high school. But the table does not show the diversity among\nchildren. At age 6, for example, when children begin school, the average boy or girl is about 115 centimeters tall, but\nsome are 109 and others are 125 centimeters. Average weight at age 6 is about 20 kilograms, but ranges between\nabout 16 and 24 kilograms\u2014about 20% variation in either direction.\nTable 5: Average height and weight of well-nourished children\nAge Height (cm) Weight (kg)\n2 85 7.0\n6 115 20.0\n10 135 31.0\n14 162 52.0\n18 169 60.5\nEducational Psychology 43 A Global Text 3. Student development\nThere are other points to keep in mind about average height and weight that are not evident from Table 9. The\nfirst is that boys and girls, on average, are quite similar in height and weight during childhood, but diverge in the\nearly teenage years, when they reach puberty. For a time (approximately age 10-14), the average girl is taller, but\nnot much heavier, than the average boy. After that the average boy becomes both taller and heavier than the\naverage girl\u2014though there remain individual exceptions (Malina, et al., 2004). The pre-teen difference can\ntherefore be awkward for some children and youth, at least among those who aspire to looking like older teenagers\nor young adults. For young teens less concerned with \u201cimage\u201d, though, the fact that girls are taller may not be\nespecially important, or even noticed (Friedman, 2000).\nA second point is that as children get older, individual differences in weight diverge more radically than\ndifferences in height. Among 18-year-olds, the heaviest youngsters weigh almost twice as much as the lightest, but\nthe tallest ones are only about 10 per cent taller than the shortest. Nonetheless, both height and weight can be\nsensitive issues for some teenagers. Most modern societies (and the teenagers in them) tend to favor relatively short\nwomen and tall men, as well as a somewhat thin body build, especially for girls and women. Yet neither \u201csocially\ncorrect\u201d height nor thinness is the destiny for many individuals. Being overweight, in particular, has become a\ncommon, serious problem in modern society (Tartamella, et al., 2004) due to the prevalence of diets high in fat and\nlifestyles low in activity. The educational system has unfortunately contributed to the problem as well, by gradually\nrestricting the number of physical education courses and classes in the past two decades.\nThe third point to keep in mind is that average height and weight is related somewhat to racial and ethnic\nbackground. In general, children of Asian background tend to be slightly shorter than children of European and\nNorth American background. The latter in turn tend to be shorter than children from African societies (Eveleth &\nTanner, 1990). Body shape differs slightly as well, though the differences are not always visible until after puberty.\nAsian youth tend to have arms and legs that are a bit short relative to their torsos, and African youth tend to have\nrelatively long arms and legs. The differences are only averages; there are large individual differences as well, and\nthese tend to be more relevant for teachers to know about than broad group differences.\nPuberty and its effects on students\nA universal physical development in students is puberty, which is the set of changes in early adolescence that\nbring about sexual maturity. Along with internal changes in reproductive organs are outward changes such as\ngrowth of breasts in girls and the penis in boys, as well as relatively sudden increases in height and weight. By about\nage 10 or 11, most children experience increased sexual attraction to others (usually heterosexual, though not\nalways) that affects social life both in school and out (McClintock & Herdt, 1996). By the end of high school, more\nthan half of boys and girls report having experienced sexual intercourse at least once\u2014though it is hard to be\ncertain of the proportion because of the sensitivity and privacy of the information. (Center for Disease Control,\n2004b; Rosenbaum, 2006).\nAt about the same time that puberty accentuates gender, role differences also accentuate for at least some\nteenagers. Some girls who excelled at math or science in elementary school may curb their enthusiasm and displays\nof success at these subjects for fear of limiting their popularity or attractiveness as girls (Taylor & Gilligan, 1995;\nSadker, 2004). Some boys who were not especially interested in sports previously may begin dedicating themselves\nto athletics to affirm their masculinity in the eyes of others. Some boys and girls who once worked together\n44 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nsuccessfully on class projects may no longer feel comfortable doing so\u2014or alternatively may now seek to be working\npartners, but for social rather than academic reasons. Such changes do not affect all youngsters equally, nor affect\nany one youngster equally on all occasions. An individual student may act like a young adult on one day, but more\nlike a child the next. When teaching children who are experiencing puberty, , teachers need to respond flexibly and\nsupportively.\nDevelopment of motor skills\nStudents\u2019 fundamental motor skills are already developing when they begin kindergarten, but are not yet\nperfectly coordinated. Five-year-olds generally can walk satisfactorily for most school-related purposes (if they\ncould not, schools would have to be organized very differently!). For some fives, running still looks a bit like a\nhurried walk, but usually it becomes more coordinated within a year or two. Similarly with jumping, throwing, and\ncatching: most children can do these things, though often clumsily, by the time they start school, but improve their\nskills noticeably during the early elementary years (Payne & Isaacs, 2005). Assisting such developments is usually\nthe job either of physical education teachers, where they exist, or else of classroom teachers during designated\nphysical education activities. Whoever is responsible, it is important to notice if a child does not keep more-or-less\nto the usual developmental timetable, and to arrange for special assessment or supports if appropriate. Common\nprocedures for arranging for help are described in Chapter 5 (\u201cSpecial education\u201d).\nEven if physical skills are not a special focus of a classroom teacher,, they can be quite important to students\nthemselves. Whatever their grade level, students who are clumsy are aware of that fact and how it could potentially\nnegatively effect respect from their peers. In the long term, self-consciousness and poor self-esteem can develop for\na child who is clumsy, especially if peers (or teachers and parents) place high value on success in athletics. One\nresearch study found, for example, what teachers and coaches sometimes suspect: that losers in athletic\ncompetitions tend to become less sociable and are more apt to miss subsequent athletic practices than winners\n(Petlichkoff, 1996).\nHealth and illness\nBy world standards, children and youth in economically developed societies tend, on average, to be remarkably\nhealthy. Even so, much depends on precisely how well-off families are and on how much health care is available to\nthem. Children from higher-income families experience far fewer serious or life-threatening illnesses than children\nfromlower-income families. Whatever their income level, parents and teachers often rightly note that children\u2014\nespecially the youngest ones\u2014get far more illnesses than do adults. In 2004, for example, a government survey\nestimated that children get an average of 6-10 colds per year, but adults get only about 2-4 per year (National\nInstitute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, 2004). The difference probably exists because children\u2019s immune\nsystems are not as fully formed as adults\u2019, and because children at school are continually exposed to other children,\nmany of whom may be contagious themselves. An indirect result of children\u2019s frequent illnesses is that teachers\n(along with airline flight attendants, incidentally!) also report more frequent minor illnesses than do adults in\ngeneral\u2014about five colds per year, for example, instead of just 2-4 (Whelen, et al., 2005). The \u201csimple\u201d illnesses are\nnot life threatening, but they are responsible for many lost days of school, both for students and for teachers, as well\nas days when a student may be present physically, but functions below par while simultaneously infecting\nclassmates. In these ways, learning and teaching often suffer because health is suffering.\nEducational Psychology 45 A Global Text 3. Student development\nThe problem is not only the prevalence of illness as such (in winter, even in the United States, approximately\none person gets infected with a minor illness every few seconds), but the fact that illnesses are not distributed\nuniformly among students, schools, or communities. Whether it is a simple cold or something more serious, illness\nis particularly common where living conditions are crowded, where health care is scarce or unaffordable, and where\nindividuals live with frequent stresses of any kind. Often, but not always, these are the circumstances of poverty.\nTable 6 summarizes these effects for a variety of health problems, not just for colds or flu.\nTable 6: Health effects of children's economic level\nHealth program Comparison: poor vs non-poor\nDelayed immunizations 3 times higher\nAsthma Somewhat higher\nLead poisoning 3 times higher\nDeaths in childhood from accidents 2-3 times higher\nDeaths in childhood from disease 3-4 times higher\nHaving a condition that limits school activity 2-3 times higher\nDays sick in bed 40 per cent higher\nSeriously impaired vision 2-3 times higher\nSevere iron-deficiency (anemia) 2 times higher\nSource: Richardson, J> (2005).

Philadelphia: Lippinsott, Williams & Wilkins.\nAs students get older, illnesses become less frequent, but other health risks emerge. The most widespread is the\nconsumption of alcohol and the smoking of cigarettes. As of 2004, about 75 per cent of teenagers reported drinking\nan alcoholic beverage at least occasionally, and 22 per cent reported smoking cigarettes (Center for Disease Control,\n2004a). The good news is that these proportions show a small, but steady decline in the frequencies over the past 10\nyears or so. The bad news is that teenagers also show increases in the abuse of some prescription drugs, such as\ninhalants, that act as stimulants (Johnston, et al., 2006). As with the prevalence of illnesses, the prevalence of drug\nuse is not uniform, with a relatively small fraction of individuals accounting for a disproportionate proportion of\nusage. One survey, for example, found that a teenager was 3-5 times more likely to smoke or to use alcohol, smoke\nmarijuana, or use drugs if he or she has a sibling who has also indulged these habits (Fagan & Najman, 2005).\nSiblings, it seems, are more influential in this case than parents.\nCognitive development: the theory of Jean Piaget\nCognition refers to thinking and memory processes, and cognitive development refers to long-term\nchanges in these processes. One of the most widely known perspectives about cognitive development is the\n46 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ncognitive stage theory of a Swiss psychologist named Jean Piaget. Piaget created and studied an account of how\nchildren and youth gradually become able to think logically and scientifically. Because his theory is especially\npopular among educators, we focus on it in this chapter. We will look at other cognitive perspectives\u2014ones that are\nnot as fully \u201cdevelopmental\u201d, in later chapters, especially Chapter 9 (\u201cFacilitating complex thinking\u201d).\nIn brief comments in Chapter 2 (see \u201cPsychological constructivism\u201d) about how Piaget explained learning, we\ndescribed Piaget as a psychological constructivist: in his view, learning proceeded by the interplay of assimilation\n(adjusting new experiences to fit prior concepts) and accommodation (adjusting concepts to fit new experiences).\nThe to-and-fro of these two processes leads not only to short-term learning, as pointed out in Chapter 1, but also to\nlong-term developmental change. The long-term developments are really the main focus of Piaget\u2019s cognitive\ntheory.\nAfter observing children closely, Piaget proposed that cognition developed through distinct stages from birth\nthrough the end of adolescence. By stages he meant a sequence of thinking patterns with four key features:\n1. They always happen in the same order.\n2. No stage is ever skipped.\n3. Each stage is a significant transformation of the stage before it.\n4. Each later stage incorporated the earlier stages into itself. Basically this is the \u201cstaircase\u201d model of\ndevelopment mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Piaget proposed four major stages of cognitive\ndevelopment, and called them (1) sensorimotor intelligence, (2) preoperational thinking, (3) concrete\noperational thinking, and (4) formal operational thinking. Each stage is correlated with an age period of\nchildhood, but only approximately.\nThe sensorimotor stage: birth to age 2\nIn Piaget\u2019s theory, the sensorimotor stage is first, and is defined as the period when infants \u201cthink\u201d by means\nof their senses and motor actions. As every new parent will attest, infants continually touch, manipulate, look, listen\nto, and even bite and chew objects. According to Piaget, these actions allow them to learn about the world and are\ncrucial to their early cognitive development.\nThe infant\u2019s actions allow the child to represent (or construct simple concepts of) objects and events. A toy\nanimal may be just a confusing array of sensations at first, but by looking, feeling, and manipulating it repeatedly,\nthe child gradually organizes her sensations and actions into a stable concept, toy animal. The representation\nacquires a permanence lacking in the individual experiences of the object, which are constantly changing. Because\nthe representation is stable, the child \u201cknows\u201d, or at least believes, that toy animal exists even if the actual toy\nanimal is temporarily out of sight. Piaget called this sense of stability object permanence, a belief that objects\nexist whether or not they are actually present. It is a major achievement of sensorimotor development, and marks a\nqualitative transformation in how older infants (24 months) think about experience compared to younger infants (6\nmonths).\nDuring much of infancy, of course, a child can only barely talk, so sensorimotor development initially happens\nwithout the support of language. It might therefore seem hard to know what infants are thinking, but Piaget devised\nseveral simple, but clever experiments to get around their lack of language, and that suggest that infants do indeed\nEducational Psychology 47 A Global Text 3. Student development\nrepresent objects even without being able to talk (Piaget, 1952). In one, for example, he simply hid an object (like a\ntoy animal) under a blanket. He found that doing so consistently prompts older infants (18-24 months) to search\nfor the object, but fails to prompt younger infants (less than six months) to do so. (You can try this experiment\nyourself if you happen to have access to young infant.) \u201cSomething\u201d motivates the search by the older infant even\nwithout the benefit of much language, and the \u201csomething\u201d is presumed to be a permanent concept or\nrepresentation of the object.\nThe preoperational stage: age 2 to 7\nIn the preoperational stage, children use their new ability to represent objects in a wide variety of activities,\nbut they do not yet do it in ways that are organized or fully logical. One of the most obvious examples of this kind of\ncognition is dramatic play, the improvised make-believe of preschool children. If you have ever had responsibility\nfor children of this age, you have likely witnessed such play. Ashley holds a plastic banana to her ear and says:\n\u201cHello, Mom? Can you be sure to bring me my baby doll? OK!\u201d Then she hangs up the banana and pours tea for\nJeremy into an invisible cup. Jeremy giggles at the sight of all of this and exclaims: \u201cRinnng! Oh Ashley, the phone\nis ringing again! You better answer it.\u201d And on it goes.\nIn a way, children immersed in make-believe seem \u201cmentally insane\u201d, in that they do not think realistically. But\nthey are not truly insane because they have not really taken leave of their senses. At some level, Ashley and Jeremy\nalways know that the banana is still a banana and not really a telephone; they are merely representing it as a\ntelephone. They are thinking on two levels at once\u2014one imaginative and the other realistic. This dual processing of\nexperience makes dramatic play an early example of metacognition, or reflecting on and monitoring of thinking\nitself. As we explained in Chapter 2, metacognition is a highly desirable skill for success in school, one that teachers\noften encourage (Bredekamp & Copple, 1997; Paley, 2005). Partly for this reason, teachers of young children\n(preschool, kindergarten, and even first or second grade) often make time and space in their classrooms for\ndramatic play, and sometimes even participate in it themselves to help develop the play further.\nThe concrete operational stage: age 7 to 11\nAs children continue into elementary school, they become able to represent ideas and events more flexibly and\nlogically. Their rules of thinking still seem very basic by adult standards and usually operate unconsciously, but they\nallow children to solve problems more systematically than before, and therefore to be successful with many\nacademic tasks. In the concrete operational stage, for example, a child may unconsciously follow the rule: \u201cIf\nnothing is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the same.\u201d This simple principle helps children\nto understand certain arithmetic tasks, such as in adding or subtracting zero from a number, as well as to do certain\nclassroom science experiments, such as ones involving judgments of the amounts of liquids when mixed. Piaget\ncalled this period the concrete operational stage because children mentally \u201coperate\u201d on concrete objects and\nevents. They are not yet able, however, to operate (or think) systematically about representations of objects or\nevents. Manipulating representations is a more abstract skill that develops later, during adolescence.\nConcrete operational thinking differs from preoperational thinking in two ways, each of which renders children\nmore skilled as students. One difference is reversibility, or the ability to think about the steps of a process in any\norder. Imagine a simple science experiment, for example, such as one that explores why objects sink or float by\nhaving a child place an assortment of objects in a basin of water. Both the preoperational and concrete operational\n48 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nchild can recall and describe the steps in this experiment, but only the concrete operational child can recall them in\nany order. This skill is very helpful on any task involving multiple steps\u2014a common feature of tasks in the\nclassroom. In teaching new vocabulary from a story, for another example, a teacher might tell students: \u201cFirst\nmake a list of words in the story that you do not know, then find and write down their definitions, and finally get a\nfriend to test you on your list\u201d. These directions involve repeatedly remembering to move back and forth between a\nsecond step and a first\u2014a task that concrete operational students\u2014and most adults\u2014find easy, but that\npreoperational children often forget to do or find confusing. If the younger children are to do this task reliably, they\nmay need external prompts, such as having the teacher remind them periodically to go back to the story to look for\nmore unknown words.\nThe other new feature of thinking during the concrete operational stage is the child\u2019s ability to decenter, or\nfocus on more than one feature of a problem at a time. There are hints of decentration in preschool children\u2019s\ndramatic play, which requires being aware on two levels at once\u2014knowing that a banana can be both a banana and\na \u201ctelephone\u201d. But the decentration of the concrete operational stage is more deliberate and conscious than\npreschoolers\u2019 make-believe. Now the child can attend to two things at once quite purposely. Suppose you give\nstudents a sheet with an assortment of subtraction problems on it, and ask them to do this: \u201cFind all of the\nproblems that involve two-digit subtraction and that involve borrowing\u2019 from the next column. Circle and solve\nonly those problems.\u201d Following these instructions is quite possible for a concrete operational student (as long as\nthey have been listening!) because the student can attend to the two subtasks simultaneously\u2014finding the two-digit\nproblems and identifying which actually involve borrowing. (Whether the student actually knows how to \u201cborrow\u201d\nhowever, is a separate question.)\nIn real classroom tasks, reversibility and decentration often happen together. A well-known example of joint\npresence is Piaget\u2019s experiments with conservation, the belief that an amount or quantity stays the same even if it\nchanges apparent size or shape (Piaget, 2001; Matthews, 1998). Imagine two identical balls made of clay. Any child,\nwhether preoperational or concrete operational, will agree that the two indeed have the same amount of clay in\nthem simply because they look the same. But if you now squish one ball into a long, thin \u201chot dog\u201d, the\npreoperational child is likely to say that the amount of that ball has changed\u2014either because it is longer or because\nit is thinner, but at any rate because it now looks different. The concrete operational child will not make this\nmistake, thanks to new cognitive skills of reversibility and decentration: for him or her, the amount is the same\nbecause \u201cyou could squish it back into a ball again\u201d (reversibility) and because \u201cit may be longer, but it is also\nthinner\u201d (decentration). Piaget would say the concrete operational child \u201chas conservation of quantity\u201d.\nThe classroom examples described above also involve reversibility and decentration. As already mentioned, the\nvocabulary activity described earlier requires reversibility (going back and forth between identifying words and\nlooking up their meanings); but it can also be construed as an example of decentration (keeping in mind two tasks\nat once\u2014word identification and dictionary search). And as mentioned, the arithmetic activity requires\ndecentration (looking for problems that meet two criteria and also solving them), but it can also be construed as an\nexample of reversibility (going back and forth between subtasks, as with the vocabulary activity). Either way, the\ndevelopment of concrete operational skills support students in doing many basic academic tasks; in a sense they\nmake ordinary schoolwork possible.\nEducational Psychology 49 A Global Text 3. Student development\nThe formal operational stage: age 11 and beyond\nIn the last of the Piagetian stages, the child becomes able to reason not only about tangible objects and events,\nbut also about hypothetical or abstract ones. Hence it has the name formal operational stage\u2014the period when\nthe individual can \u201coperate\u201d on \u201cforms\u201d or representations. With students at this level, the teacher can pose\nhypothetical (or contrary-to-fact) problems: \u201cWhat if the world had never discovered oil?\u201d or \u201cWhat if the first\nEuropean explorers had settled first in California instead of on the East Coast of the United States?\u201d To answer such\nquestions, students must use hypothetical reasoning, meaning that they must manipulate ideas that vary in\nseveral ways at once, and do so entirely in their minds.\nThe hypothetical reasoning that concerned Piaget primarily involved scientific problems. His studies of formal\noperational thinking therefore often look like problems that middle or high school teachers pose in science classes.\nIn one problem, for example, a young person is presented with a simple pendulum, to which different amounts of\nweight can be hung (Inhelder & Piaget, 1958). The experimenter asks: \u201cWhat determines how fast the pendulum\nswings: the length of the string holding it, the weight attached to it, or the distance that it is pulled to the side?\u201d The\nyoung person is not allowed to solve this problem by trial-and-error with the materials themselves, but must reason\na way to the solution mentally. To do so systematically, he or she must imagine varying each factor separately, while\nalso imagining the other factors that are held constant. This kind of thinking requires facility at manipulating\nmental representations of the relevant objects and actions\u2014precisely the skill that defines formal operations.\nAs you might suspect, students with an ability to think hypothetically have an advantage in many kinds of school\nwork: by definition, they require relatively few \u201cprops\u201d to solve problems. In this sense they can in principle be\nmore self-directed than students who rely only on concrete operations\u2014certainly a desirable quality in the opinion\nof most teachers. Note, though, that formal operational thinking is desirable but not sufficient for school success,\nand that it is far from being the only way that students achieve educational success. Formal thinking skills do not\ninsure that a student is motivated or well-behaved, for example, nor does it guarantee other desirable skills, such as\nability at sports, music, or art. The fourth stage in Piaget\u2019s theory is really about a particular kind of formal\nthinking, the kind needed to solve scientific problems and devise scientific experiments. Since many people do not\nnormally deal with such problems in the normal course of their lives, it should be no surprise that research finds\nthat many people never achieve or use formal thinking fully or consistently, or that they use it only in selected areas\nwith which they are very familiar (Case & Okomato, 1996). For teachers, the limitations of Piaget's ideas suggest a\nneed for additional theories about development\u2014ones that focus more directly on the social and interpersonal\nissues of childhood and adolescence. The next sections describe some of these.\nSocial development: relationships,personal motives, and morality\nSocial development refers to the long-term changes in relationships and interactions involving self, peers,\nand family. It includes both positive changes, such as how friendships develop, and negative changes, such as\naggression or bullying. The social developments that are the most obviously relevant to classroom life fall into three\nmain areas: (1) changes in self-concept and in relationships among students and teachers, (2) changes in basic\nneeds or personal motives, and (3) changes in sense of rights and responsibilities. As with cognitive development,\neach of these areas has a broad, well-known theory (and theorist) that provides a framework for thinking about how\nthe area relates to teaching. For development of self-concept and relationships, it is the theory of Erik Erikson;\nfor development of personal motives, it is the theory of Abraham Maslow; and for development of ethical\n50 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nknowledge and beliefs, it is the work of Lawrence Kohlberg and his critic, Carol Gilligan. Their theories are\ndefinitely not the only ones related to social development of students, and their ideas are often debated by other\nresearchers. But their accounts do explain much about social development that is relevant to teaching and\neducation.\nErik Erikson: eight psychosocial crises of development\nLike Piaget, Erik Erikson developed a theory of social development that relies on stages, except that Erikson\nthought of stages as a series of psychological or social (or psychosocial) crises\u2014turning points in a person\u2019s\nrelationships and feelings about himself or herself (Erikson, 1963, 1980). Each crisis consists of a dilemma or\nchoice that carries both advantages and risks, but in which one choice or alternative is normally considered more\ndesirable or \u201chealthy\u201d. How one crisis is resolved affects how later crises are resolved. The resolution also helps to\ncreate an individual\u2019s developing personality. Erikson proposed eight crises that extend from birth through old age;\nthey are summarized in Table 7. Four of the stages occur during the school years, so we give these special attention\nhere, but it is helpful also to know what crises are thought to come both before and after those in the school years.\nTable 7: Eight psychosocial crises according to Erikson\nPsychosocial crisis Approximate age Description\nTrust and mistrust Birth to one year Development of trust between caregiver and child\nAutonomy and shame Age 1-3 Development of control over bodily functions and activities\nInitiative and guilt Age 3-6 Testing limits of self-assertion and purposefulness\nIndustry and inferiority Age 6-12 Development of sense of mastery and competence\nIdentity and role confusion Age 12-19 Development of identity and acknowledge of identity by others\nIntimacy and isolation Age 19-25+ Formation of intimate relationships and commitments\nGenerativity and Age 25-50+ Development of creative or productive activities that\nstagnation contribute to future generations\nIntegrity and despair Age 50+ Acceptance of personal life history and forgiveness of self and\nothers\nCrises of infants and preschoolers: trust, autonomy, and initiative\nAlmost from the day they are born, infants face a crisis (in Erikson\u2019s sense) about trust and mistrust. They\nare happiest if they can eat, sleep, and excrete according to their own physiological schedules, regardless of whether\ntheir schedules are convenient for the caregiver (often the mother). Unfortunately, though, a young infant is in no\nposition to control or influence a mother\u2019s care giving or scheduling needs; so the baby faces a dilemma about how\nmuch to trust or mistrust the mother\u2019s helpfulness. It is as if the baby asks, \u201cIf I demand food (or sleep or a clean\ndiaper) now, will my mother actually be able to help me meet this need?\u201d Hopefully, between the two of them,\nmother and child resolve this choice in favor of the baby's trust: the mother proves herself at least \u201cgood enough\u201d in\nher attentiveness, and the baby risks trusting mother's motivation and skill at care giving.\nEducational Psychology 51 A Global Text 3. Student development\nAlmost as soon as this crisis is resolved, however, a new one develops over the issue of autonomy and shame.\nThe child (who is now a toddler) may now trust his or her caregiver (mother), but the very trust contributes to a\ndesire to assert autonomy by taking care of basic personal needs, such as feeding, toileting, or dressing. Given the\nchild\u2019s lack of experience in these activities, however, self-care is risky at first\u2014the toddler may feed (or toilet or\ndress) clumsily and ineffectively. The child\u2019s caregiver, for her part, risks overprotecting the child and criticizing his\nearly efforts unnecessarily and thus causing the child to feel shame for even trying. Hopefully, as with the earlier\ncrisis of trust, the new crisis gets resolved in favor of autonomy through the combined efforts of the child to exercise\nautonomy and of the caregiver to support the child\u2019s efforts.\nEventually, about the time a child is of preschool age, the autonomy exercised during the previous period\nbecomes more elaborate, extended, and focused on objects and people other than the child and basic physical\nneeds. The child at a day care center may now undertake, for example, to build the \u201cbiggest city in the world\u201d out of\nall available unit blocks\u2014even if other children want some of the blocks for themselves. The child\u2019s projects and\ndesires create a new crisis of initiative and guilt, because the child soon realizes that acting on impulses or\ndesires can sometimes have negative effects on others\u2014more blocks for the child may mean fewer for someone else.\nAs with the crisis over autonomy, caregivers have to support the child\u2019s initiatives where possible, but also not make\nthe child feel guilty just for desiring to have or to do something that affects others' welfare. By limiting behavior\nwhere necessary but not limiting internal feelings, the child can develop a lasting ability to take initiative. Expressed\nin Erikson\u2019s terms, the crisis is then resolved in favor of initiative.\nEven though only the last of these three crises overlaps with the school years, all three relate to issues faced by\nstudents of any age, and even by their teachers. A child or youth who is fundamentally mistrustful, for example, has\na serious problem in coping with school life. If you are a student, it is essential for your long-term survival to believe\nthat teachers and school officials have your best interests at heart, and that they are not imposing assignments or\nmaking rules, for example, \u201cjust for the heck of it.\u201d Even though students are not infants any more, teachers\nfunction like Erikson\u2019s caregiving parents in that they need to prove worthy of students\u2019 trust through their initial\nflexibility and attentiveness.\nParallels from the classroom also exist for the crises of autonomy and of initiative. To learn effectively, students\nneed to make choices and undertake academic initiatives at least some of the time, even though not every choice or\ninitiative may be practical or desirable. Teachers, for their part, need to make true choices and initiatives possible,\nand refrain from criticizing, even accidentally, a choice or intention behind an initiative even if the teacher privately\nbelieves that it is \u201cbound to fail\u201d. Support for choices and initiative should be focused on providing resources and on\nguiding the student\u2019s efforts toward more likely success. In these ways teachers function like parents of toddlers\nand preschoolers in Erikson\u2019s theory of development, regardless of the age of their students.\nThe crisis of childhood: industry and inferiority\nOnce into elementary school, the child is faced for the first time with becoming competent and worthy in the\neyes of the world at large, or more precisely in the eyes of classmates and teachers. To achieve their esteem, he or\nshe must develop skills that require effort that is sustained and somewhat focused. The challenge creates the crisis\nof industry and inferiority. To be respected by teachers, for example, the child must learn to read and to behave\nlike a \u201ctrue student\u201d. To be respected by peers, he or she must learn to cooperate and to be friendly, among other\n52 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthings. There are risks involved in working on these skills and qualities, because there can be no guarantee of\nsuccess with them in advance. If the child does succeed, therefore, he or she experiences the satisfaction of a job\nwell done and of skills well learned\u2014a feeling that Eriks0n called industry. If not, however, the child risks feeling\nlasting inferiority compared to others. Teachers therefore have a direct, explicit role in helping students to resolve\nthis crisis in favor of industry or success. They can set realistic academic goals for students\u2014ones that tend to lead\nto success\u2014and then provide materials and assistance for students to reach their goals. Teachers can also express\ntheir confidence that students can in fact meet their goals if and when the students get discouraged, and avoid\nhinting (even accidentally) that a student is simply a \u201closer\u201d. Paradoxically, these strategies will work best if the\nteacher is also tolerant of less-than-perfect performance by students. Too much emphasis on perfection can\nundermine some students\u2019 confidence\u2014foster Erikson\u2019s inferiority\u2014by making academic goals seem beyond reach.\nThe crisis of adolescence: identity and role confusion\nAs the child develops lasting talents and attitudes as a result of the crisis of industry, he begins to face a new\nquestion: what do all the talents and attitudes add up to be? Who is the \u201cme\u201d embedded in this profile of qualities?\nThese questions are the crisis of identity and role confusion. Defining identity is riskier than it may appear for\na person simply because some talents and attitudes may be poorly developed, and some even may be undesirable in\nthe eyes of others. (If you are poor at math, how do you live with family and friends if they think you should be good\nat this skill?) Still others may be valuable but fail to be noticed by other people. The result is that who a person\nwants to be may not be the same as who he or she is in actual fact, nor the same as who other people want the\nperson to be. In Erikson's terms, role confusion is the result.\nTeachers can minimize role confusion in a number of ways. One is to offer students lots of diverse role models\u2014\nby identifying models in students\u2019 reading materials, for example, or by inviting diverse guests to school. The point\nof these strategies would be to express a key idea: that there are many ways to be respected, successful, and satisfied\nwith life. Another way to support students\u2019 identity development is to be alert to students\u2019 confusions about their\nfutures, and refer them to counselors or other services outside school that can help sort these out. Still another\nstrategy is to tolerate changes in students\u2019 goals and priorities\u2014sudden changes in extra-curricular activities or in\npersonal plans after graduation. Since students are still trying roles out, discouraging experimentation may not be\nin students\u2019 best interests.\nThe crises of adulthood: intimacy, generativity, and integrity\nBeyond the school years, according to Erikson, individuals continue psychosocial development by facing\nadditional crises. Young adults, for example, face a crisis of intimacy and isolation. This crisis is about the risk\nof establishing close relationships with a select number of others. Whether the relationships are heterosexual,\nhomosexual, or not sexual at all, their defining qualities are depth and sustainability. Without them, an individual\nrisks feeling isolated. Assuming that a person resolves this crisis in favor of intimacy, however, he or she then faces\na crisis about generativity and stagnation. This crisis is characteristic of most of adulthood, and not\nsurprisingly therefore is about caring for or making a contribution to society, and especially to its younger\ngeneration. Generativity is about making life productive and creative so that it matters to others. One obvious way\nfor some to achieve this feeling is by raising children, but there are also many other ways to contribute to the\nwelfare of others. The final crisis is about integrity and despair, and is characteristically felt during the final\nyears of life. At the end of life, a person is likely to review the past and to ask whether it has been lived as well as\nEducational Psychology 53 A Global Text 3. Student development\npossible, even if it was clearly not lived perfectly. Since personal history can no longer be altered at the end of life, it\nis important to make peace with what actually happened and to forgive oneself and others for mistakes that may\nhave been made. The alternative is despair, or depression from believing not only that one\u2019s life was lived badly, but\nalso that there is no longer any hope of correcting past mistakes.\nEven though Erikson conceives of these crises as primarily concerns of adulthood, there are precursors of them\nduring the school years. Intimacy, for example, is a concern of many children and youth in that they often desire,\nbut do not always find, lasting relationships with others (Beidel, 2005; Zimbardo & Radl, 1999). Personal isolation\nis a particular risk for students with disabilities, as well as for students whose cultural or racial backgrounds differ\nfrom classmates\u2019 or the teacher\u2019s. Generativity\u2014feeling helpful to others and to the young\u2014is needed not only by\nmany adults, but also by many children and youth; when given the opportunity as part of their school program, they\nfrequently welcome a chance to be of authentic service to others as part of their school programs (Eyler & Giles,\n1999; Kay, 2003). Integrity\u2014taking responsibility for your personal past, \u201cwarts and all\u201d, is often a felt need for\nanyone, young or old, who has lived long enough to have a past on which to look. Even children and youth have a\npast in this sense, though their pasts are of course shorter than persons who are older.\nAbraham Maslow: a hierarchy of motives and needs\nAbraham Maslow's theory frames personal needs or motives as a hierarchy, meaning that basic or \u201clower-level\u201d\nneeds have to be satisfied before higher-level needs become important or motivating (1976, 1987). Compared to the\nstage models of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow\u2019s hierarchy is only loosely \u201cdevelopmental\u201d, in that Maslow was not\nconcerned with tracking universal, irreversible changes across the lifespan. Maslow's stages are universal, but they\nare not irreversible; earlier stages sometimes reappear later in life, in which case they must be satisfied again before\nlater stages can redevelop. Like the theories of Piaget and Erikson, Maslow\u2019s is a rather broad \u201cstory\u201d, one that has\nless to say about the effects of a person\u2019s culture, language, or economic level, than about what we all have in\ncommon.\nIn its original version, Maslow\u2019s theory distinguishes two types of needs, called deficit needs and being\nneeds (or sometimes deficiency needs and growth needs). Table 8 summarizes the two levels and their sublevels.\nDeficit needs are prior to being needs, not in the sense of happening earlier in life, but in that deficit needs must be\nsatisfied before being needs can be addressed. As pointed out, deficit needs can reappear at any age, depending on\ncircumstances. If that happens, they must be satisfied again before a person\u2019s attention can shift back to \u201chigher\u201d\nneeds. Among students, in fact, deficit needs are likely to return chronically to those whose families lack economic\nor social resources or who live with the stresses associated with poverty (Payne, 2005).\nTable 8: Maslow's hierarchy of motives and needs\nPhysiological needs\nDeficit Needs Safety and security needs\nLove and belonging needs\nCognitive needs\n54 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nBeing Needs Aesthetic needs\nSelf-actualization needs\nDeficit needs: getting the basic necessities of life\nDeficit needs are the basic requirements of physical and emotional well-being. First are physiological needs\u2014\nfood, sleep, clothing, and the like. Without these, nothing else matters, and especially nothing very \u201celevated\u201d or\nself-fulfilling. A student who is not getting enough to eat is not going to feel much interest in learning! Once\nphysiological needs are met, however, safety and security needs become important. The person looks for stability\nand protection, and welcomes a bit of structure and limits if they provide these conditions. A child from an abusive\nfamily, for example, may be getting enough to eat, but may worry chronically about personal safety. In school, the\nstudent may appreciate a well-organized classroom with rules that insures personal safety and predictability,\nwhether or not the classroom provides much in the way of real learning.\nAfter physiological and safety needs are met, love and belonging needs emerge. The person turns attention to\nmaking friends, being a friend, and cultivating positive personal relationships in general. In the classroom, a\nstudent motivated at this level may make approval from peers or teachers into a top priority. He or she may be\nprovided for materially and find the classroom and family life safe enough, but still miss a key ingredient in life\u2014\nlove. If such a student (or anyone else) eventually does find love and belonging, however, then his or her motivation\nshifts again, this time to esteem needs. Now the concern is with gaining recognition and respect\u2014and even more\nimportantly, gaining self-respect. A student at this level may be unusually concerned with achievement, for\nexample, though only if the achievement is visible or public enough to earn public recognition.\nBeing needs: becoming the best that you can be\nBeing needs are desires to become fulfilled as a person, or to be the best person that you can possibly be. They\ninclude cognitive needs (a desire for knowledge and understanding), aesthetic needs (an appreciation of beauty and\norder), and most importantly, self-actualization needs (a desire for fulfillment of one\u2019s potential). Being needs\nemerge only after all of a person\u2019s deficit needs have been largely met. Unlike deficit needs, being needs beget more\nbeing needs; they do not disappear once they are met, but create a desire for even more satisfaction of the same\ntype. A thirst for knowledge, for example, leads to further thirst for knowledge, and aesthetic appreciation leads to\nmore aesthetic appreciation. Partly because being needs are lasting and permanent once they appear, Maslow\nsometimes treated them as less hierarchical than deficit needs, and instead grouped cognitive, aesthetic, and self-\nactualization needs into the single category self-actualization needs.\nPeople who are motivated by self-actualization have a variety of positive qualities, which Maslow went to some\nlengths to identify and describe (Maslow, 1976). Self-actualizing individuals, he argued, value deep personal\nrelationships with others, but also value solitude; they have a sense of humor, but do not use it against others; they\naccept themselves as well as others; they are spontaneous, humble, creative, and ethical. In short, the self-\nactualizing person has just about every good quality imaginable! Not surprisingly, therefore, Maslow felt that true\nself-actualization is rare. It is especially unusual among young people, who have not yet lived long enough to satisfy\nearlier, deficit-based needs.\nEducational Psychology 55 A Global Text 3. Student development\nIn a way this last point is discouraging news for teachers, who apparently must spend their lives providing as\nbest they can for individuals\u2014students\u2014still immersed in deficit needs. Teachers, it seems, have little hope of ever\nmeeting a student with fully fledged being needs. Taken less literally, though, Maslow\u2019s hierarchy is still useful for\nthinking about students\u2019 motives. Most teachers would argue that students\u2014young though they are\u2014can display\npositive qualities similar to the ones described in Maslow\u2019s self-actualizing person. However annoying students may\nsometimes be, there are also moments when they show care and respect for others, for example, and moments\nwhen they show spontaneity, humility, or a sound ethical sense. Self-actualization is an appropriate way to think\nabout these moments\u2014the times when students are at their best. At the same time, of course, students sometimes\nalso have deficit needs. Keeping in mind the entire hierarchy outlined by Maslow can therefore deepen teachers'\nunderstanding of the full humanity of students.\nMoral development: forming a sense of rights and responsibilities\nMorality is a system of beliefs about what is right and good compared to what is wrong or bad. Moral\ndevelopment refers to changes in moral beliefs as a person grows older and gains maturity. Moral beliefs are\nrelated to, but not identical with, moral behavior: it is possible to know the right thing to do, but not actually do it.\nIt is also not the same as knowledge of social conventions, which are arbitrary customs needed for the smooth\noperation of society. Social conventions may have a moral element, but they have a primarily practical purpose.\nConventionally, for example, motor vehicles all keep to the same side of the street (to the right in the United States,\nto the left in Great Britain). The convention allows for smooth, accident-free flow of traffic. But following the\nconvention also has a moral element, because an individual who chooses to drive on the wrong side of the street can\ncause injuries or even death. In this sense, choosing the wrong side of the street is wrong morally, though the choice\nis also unconventional.\nWhen it comes to schooling and teaching, moral choices are not restricted to occasional dramatic incidents, but\nare woven into almost every aspect of classroom life. Imagine this simple example. Suppose that you are teaching,\nreading to a small group of second-graders, and the students are taking turns reading a story out loud. Should you\ngive every student the same amount of time to read, even though some might benefit from having additional time?\nOr should you give more time to the students who need extra help, even if doing so bores classmates and deprives\nothers of equal shares of \u201cfloor time\u201d? Which option is more fair, and which is more considerate? Simple dilemmas\nlike this happen every day at all grade levels simply because students are diverse, and because class time and a\nteacher\u2019s energy are finite.\nEmbedded in this rather ordinary example are moral themes about fairness or justice, on the one hand, and\nabout consideration or care on the other. It is important to keep both themes in mind when thinking about how\nstudents develop beliefs about right or wrong. A morality of justice is about human rights\u2014or more specifically,\nabout respect for fairness, impartiality, equality, and individuals\u2019 independence. A morality of care, on the other\nhand, is about human responsibilities\u2014more specifically, about caring for others, showing consideration for\nindividuals\u2019 needs, and interdependence among individuals. Students and teachers need both forms of morality. In\nthe next sections therefore we explain a major example of each type of developmental theory, beginning with the\nmorality of justice.\n56 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nKohlberg\u2019s morality of justice\nOne of the best-known explanations of how morality of justice develops was developed by Lawrence Kohlberg\nand his associates (Kohlberg, Levine, & Hewer, 1983; Power, Higgins, & Kohlberg, 1991). Using a stage model\nsimilar to Piaget\u2019s, Kohlberg proposed six stages of moral development, grouped into three levels. Individuals\nexperience the stages universally and in sequence as they form beliefs about justice. He named the levels simply\npreconventional, conventional, and (you guessed it) postconventional. The levels and stages are summarized in\nTable 5.\nTable 9: Moral stages according to Kohlberg\nMoral stage Definition of what is \u201cgood\u201d\nPreconventional Level:\nStage 1: Obedience and punishment Action that is rewarded and not punished\nStage 2: Market exchange Action that is agreeable to the child and child's partner\nConventional Level:\nStage 3: Peer opinion Action that wins approval from friends or peers\nStage 4: Law and order Action that conforms to community customs or laws\nPostconventional Level:\nStage 5: Social contract Action that follows social accepted ways of making decisions\nStage 6: Universal principles Action that is consistent with self-chosen, general principles\nPreconventional justice: obedience and mutual advantage\nThe preconventional level of moral development coincides approximately with the preschool period of life and\nwith Piaget\u2019s preoperational period of thinking. At this age the child is still relatively self-centered and insensitive to\nthe moral effects of actions on others. The result is a somewhat short-sighted orientation to morality. Initially\n(Kohlberg\u2019s Stage 1), the child adopts an ethics of obedience and punishment\u2014a sort of \u201cmorality of keeping\nout of trouble\u201d. The rightness and wrongness of actions is determined by whether actions are rewarded or punished\nby authorities such as parents or teachers. If helping yourself to a cookie brings affectionate smiles from adults,\nthen taking the cookie is considered morally \u201cgood\u201d. If it brings scolding instead, then it is morally \u201cbad\u201d. The child\ndoes not think about why an action might be praised or scolded; in fact, says Kohlberg, he would be incapable at\nStage 1 of considering the reasons even if adults offered them.\nEventually the child learns not only to respond to positive consequences, but also learns how to produce them by\nexchanging favors with others. The new ability creates Stage 2, an ethics of market exchange. At this stage the\nmorally \u201cgood\u201d action is one that favors not only the child, but another person directly involved. A \u201cbad\u201d action is\none that lacks this reciprocity. If trading the sandwich from your lunch for the cookies in your friend\u2019s lunch is\nEducational Psychology 57 A Global Text 3. Student development\nmutually agreeable, then the trade is morally good; otherwise it is not. This perspective introduces a type of fairness\ninto the child\u2019s thinking for the first time. But it still ignores the larger context of actions\u2014the effects on people not\npresent or directly involved. In Stage 2, for example, it would also be considered morally \u201cgood\u201d to pay a classmate\nto do another student's homework\u2014or even to avoid bullying or to provide sexual favors\u2014provided that both\nparties regard the arrangement as being fair.\nConventional justice: conformity to peers and society\nAs children move into the school years, their lives expand to include a larger number and range of peers and\n(eventually) of the community as a whole. The change leads to conventional morality, which are beliefs based on\nwhat this larger array of people agree on\u2014hence Kohlberg\u2019s use of the term \u201cconventional\u201d. At first, in Stage 3, the\nchild\u2019s reference group are immediate peers, so Stage 3 is sometimes called the ethics of peer opinion. If peers\nbelieve, for example, that it is morally good to behave politely with as many people as possible, then the child is\nlikely to agree with the group and to regard politeness as not merely an arbitrary social convention, but a moral\n\u201cgood\u201d. This approach to moral belief is a bit more stable than the approach in Stage 2, because the child is taking\ninto account the reactions not just of one other person, but of many. But it can still lead astray if the group settles\non beliefs that adults consider morally wrong, like \u201cShop lifting for candy bars is fun and desirable.\u201d\nEventually, as the child becomes a youth and the social world expands even more, he or she acquires even larger\nnumbers of peers and friends. He or she is therefore more likely to encounter disagreements about ethical issues\nand beliefs. Resolving the complexities lead to Stage 4, the ethics of law and order, in which the young person\nincreasingly frames moral beliefs in terms of what the majority of society believes. Now, an action is morally good if\nit is legal or at least customarily approved by most people, including people whom the youth does not know\npersonally. This attitude leads to an even more stable set of principles than in the previous stage, though it is still\nnot immune from ethical mistakes. A community or society may agree, for example, that people of a certain race\nshould be treated with deliberate disrespect, or that a factory owner is entitled to dump waste water into a\ncommonly shared lake or river. To develop ethical principles that reliably avoid mistakes like these require further\nstages of moral development.\nPostconventional justice: social contract and universal principles\nAs a person becomes able to think abstractly (or \u201cformally\u201d, in Piaget\u2019s sense), ethical beliefs shift from\nacceptance of what the community does believe to the process by which community beliefs are formed. The new\nfocus constitutes Stage 5, the ethics of social contract. Now an action, belief, or practice is morally good if it has\nbeen created through fair, democratic processes that respect the rights of the people affected. Consider, for\nexample, the laws in some areas that require motorcyclists to wear helmets. In what sense are the laws about this\nbehavior ethical? Was it created by consulting with and gaining the consent of the relevant people? Were cyclists\nconsulted and did they give consent? Or how about doctors or the cyclists' families? Reasonable, thoughtful\nindividuals disagree about how thoroughly and fairly these consultation processes should be. In focusing on the\nprocesses by which the law was created, however, individuals are thinking according to Stage 5, the ethics of social\ncontract, regardless of the position they take about wearing helmets. In this sense, beliefs on both sides of a debate\nabout an issue can sometimes be morally sound even if they contradict each other.\n58 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nPaying attention to due process certainly seems like it should help to avoid mindless conformity to conventional\nmoral beliefs. As an ethical strategy, though, it too can sometimes fail. The problem is that an ethics of social\ncontract places more faith in democratic process than the process sometimes deserves, and does not pay enough\nattention to the content of what gets decided. In principle (and occasionally in practice), a society could decide\ndemocratically to kill off every member of a racial minority, for example, but would deciding this by due process\nmake it ethical? The realization that ethical means can sometimes serve unethical ends leads some individuals\ntoward Stage 6, the ethics of self-chosen, universal principles. At this final stage, the morally good action is\nbased on personally held principles that apply both to the person\u2019s immediate life as well as to the larger\ncommunity and society. The universal principles may include a belief in democratic due process (Stage 5 ethics),\nbut also other principles, such as a belief in the dignity of all human life or the sacredness of the natural\nenvironment. At Stage 6, the universal principles will guide a person\u2019s beliefs even if the principles mean\ndisagreeing occasionally with what is customary (Stage 4) or even with what is legal (Stage 5).\nGilligan\u2019s morality of care\nAs logical as they sound, Kohlberg\u2019s stages of moral justice are not sufficient for understanding the development\nof moral beliefs. To see why, suppose that you have a student who asks for an extension of the deadline for an\nassignment. The justice orientation of Kohlberg\u2019s theory would prompt you to consider issues of whether granting\nthe request is fair. Would the late student be able to put more effort into the assignment than other students?\nWould the extension place a difficult demand on you, since you would have less time to mark the assignments?\nThese are important considerations related to the rights of students and the teacher. In addition to these, however,\nare considerations having to do with the responsibilities that you and the requesting student have for each other\nand for others. Does the student have a valid personal reason (illness, death in the family, etc.) for the assignment\nbeing late? Will the assignment lose its educational value if the student has to turn it in prematurely? These latter\nquestions have less to do with fairness and rights, and more to do with taking care of and responsibility for\nstudents. They require a framework different from Kohlberg\u2019s to be understood fully.\nOne such framework has been developed by Carol Gilligan, whose ideas center on a morality of care, or\nsystem of beliefs about human responsibilities, care, and consideration for others. Gilligan proposed three moral\npositions that represent different extents or breadth of ethical care. Unlike Kohlberg, Piaget, or Erikson, she does\nnot claim that the positions form a strictly developmental sequence, but only that they can be ranked hierarchically\naccording to their depth or subtlety. In this respect her theory is \u201csemi-developmental\u201d in a way similar to Maslow\u2019s\ntheory of motivation (Brown & Gilligan, 1992; Taylor, Gilligan, & Sullivan, 1995). Table 10 summarizes the three\nmoral positions from Gilligan\u2019s theory\nTable 10: Positions of moral development according to Gilligan\nMoral position Definition of what is morally good\nPosition 1: Survival Action that considers one's personal needs only\norientation\nPosition 2: Conventional Action that considers others' needs or preferences, but not one's own\ncare\nEducational Psychology 59 A Global Text 3. Student development\nPosition 3: Integrated care Action that attempts to coordinate one's own personal needs with those of\nothers\nPosition 1: caring as survival\nThe most basic kind of caring is a survival orientation, in which a person is concerned primarily with his or\nher own welfare. If a teenage girl with this ethical position is wondering whether to get an abortion, for example,\nshe will be concerned entirely with the effects of the abortion on herself. The morally good choice will be whatever\ncreates the least stress for herself and that disrupts her own life the least. Responsibilities to others (the baby, the\nfather, or her family) play little or no part in her thinking.\nAs a moral position, a survival orientation is obviously not satisfactory for classrooms on a widespread scale. If\nevery student only looked out for himself or herself, classroom life might become rather unpleasant! Nonetheless,\nthere are situations in which focusing primarily on yourself is both a sign of good mental health and relevant to\nteachers. For a child who has been bullied at school or sexually abused at home, for example, it is both healthy and\nmorally desirable to speak out about how bullying or abuse has affected the victim. Doing so means essentially\nlooking out for the victim\u2019s own needs at the expense of others\u2019 needs, including the bully\u2019s or abuser\u2019s. Speaking\nout, in this case, requires a survival orientation and is healthy because the child is taking caring of herself.\nPosition 2: conventional caring\nA more subtle moral position is caring for others, in which a person is concerned about others\u2019 happiness and\nwelfare, and about reconciling or integrating others\u2019 needs where they conflict with each other. In considering an\nabortion, for example, the teenager at this position would think primarily about what other people prefer. Do the\nfather, her parents, and/or her doctor want her to keep the child? The morally good choice becomes whatever will\nplease others the best. This position is more demanding than Position 1, ethically and intellectually, because it\nrequires coordinating several persons\u2019 needs and values. But it is often morally insufficient because it ignores one\ncrucial person: the self.\nIn classrooms, students who operate from Position 2 can be very desirable in some ways; they can be eager to\nplease, considerate, and good at fitting in and at working cooperatively with others. Because these qualities are\nusually welcome in a busy classroom, teachers can be tempted to reward students for developing and using them.\nThe problem with rewarding Position 2 ethics, however, is that doing so neglects the student\u2019s development\u2014his or\nher own academic and personal goals or values. Sooner or later, personal goals, values, and identity need attention\nand care, and educators have a responsibility for assisting students to discover and clarify them.\nPosition 3: integrated caring\nThe most developed form of moral caring in Gilligan\u2019s model is integrated caring, the coordination of\npersonal needs and values with those of others. Now the morally good choice takes account of everyone including\nyourself, not everyone except yourself. In considering an abortion, a woman at Position 3 would think not only\nabout the consequences for the father, the unborn child, and her family, but also about the consequences for\nherself. How would bearing a child affect her own needs, values, and plans? This perspective leads to moral beliefs\nthat are more comprehensive, but ironically are also more prone to dilemmas because the widest possible range of\nindividuals are being considered.\n60 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn classrooms, integrated caring is most likely to surface whenever teachers give students wide, sustained\nfreedom to make choices. If students have little flexibility about their actions, there is little room for considering\nanyone\u2019s needs or values, whether their own or others\u2019. If the teacher says simply: \u201cDo the homework on page 50\nand turn it in tomorrow morning\u201d, then the main issue becomes compliance, not moral choice. But suppose instead\nthat she says something like this: \u201cOver the next two months, figure out an inquiry project about the use of water\nresources in our town. Organize it any way you want\u2014talk to people, read widely about it, and share it with the class\nin a way that all of us, including yourself, will find meaningful.\u201d An assignment like this poses moral challenges that\nare not only educational, but also moral, since it requires students to make value judgments. Why? For one thing,\nstudents must decide what aspect of the topic really matters to them. Such a decision is partly a matter of personal\nvalues. For another thing, students have to consider how to make the topic meaningful or important to others in the\nclass. Third, because the time line for completion is relatively far in the future, students may have to weigh personal\npriorities (like spending time with friends or family) against educational priorities (working on the assignment a bit\nmore on the weekend). As you might suspect, some students might have trouble making good choices when given\nthis sort of freedom\u2014and their teachers might therefore be cautious about giving such an assignment. But the\ndifficulties in making choices are part of Gilligan\u2019s point: integrated caring is indeed more demanding than the\ncaring based only on survival or on consideration of others. Not all students may be ready for it.\nUnderstanding \u201cthe typical student\u201d versus understanding students\nIn this chapter, in keeping with the general nature of developmental theory, we have often spoken of students in\na generalized way, referring to \u201cthe\u201d child, student, or youngster, as if a single typical or average individual exists\nand develops through single, predictable pathways. As every teacher knows, however, development is not that\nsimple. A class of 25 or 30 students will contain 25 or 30 individuals each learning and developing along distinct\npathways. Why then study developmental patterns at all? Because underlying their obvious diversity, students\nindeed show important similarities. This chapter has indicated some of the similarities and how they relate to the\njob of teaching. Our references to \u201cthe\u201d student should not be understood, therefore, as supporting simple-minded\nstereotypes; they refer instead to common tendencies of real, live children and youth. Pointing to developmental\nchanges is like pointing to a flock of birds in flight: the flock has a general location, but individual birds also have\ntheir own locations and take individual flight paths. Development and diversity therefore have to be understood\njointly, not separately. There are indeed similarities woven among the differences in students, but also differences\nwoven among students\u2019 commonalities. We recommend therefore that you read this chapter on development\ntogether with the next one, which looks explicitly at student diversity.\nChapter summary\nUnderstanding development, or the long-term changes in growth, behavior, and knowledge, helps teachers to\nhold appropriate expectations for students as well as to keep students\u2019 individual diversity in perspective. From\nkindergarten through the end of high school, students double their height, triple their weight, experience the social\nand hormonal effects of puberty, and improve basic motor skills. Their health is generally good, though illnesses are\naffected significantly by students\u2019 economic and social circumstances.\nCognitively, students develop major new abilities to think logically and abstractly, based on a foundation of\nsensory and motor experiences with the objects and people around them. Jean Piaget has one well-known theory\ndetailing how these changes unfold.\nEducational Psychology 61 A Global Text 3. Student development\nSocially, students face and resolve a number of issues\u2014especially the issue of industry (dedicated, sustained\nwork) during childhood and the issue of identity during adolescence. Erik Erikson has described these crises in\ndetail, as well as social crises that precede and follow the school years. Students are motivated both by basic human\nneeds (food, safety, belonging, esteem) and by needs to enhance themselves psychologically (self-actualization).\nAbraham Maslow has described these motivations and how they relate to each other.\nMorally, students develop both a sense of justice and of care for others, and their thinking in each of these\nrealms undergoes important changes as they mature. Lawrence Kohlberg has described changes in children and\nyouth\u2019s beliefs about justice, and Carol Gilligan has described changes in their beliefs about care.\nOn the Internet\n<www.srcd.org/press> This is part of the website for the Society for Research in Child Development, an\norganization that supports research about children and youth, and that advocates for government policies on their\nbehalf.

Student diversity\nI\u2019ll tell you this: There are some people, and then there are others.\n(Anna Harris)\nAnna Harris was Kelvin Seifert's grandmother as well as a schoolteacher from about 1910 to 1930.\nShe used to make comments, like the one above, that sounded odd but that also contained a grain of\nwisdom. In this case her remark makes a good theme for this chapter\u2014and even for teaching in\ngeneral. Students do differ in a multitude of ways, both individually and because of memberships in\nfamilies, communities or cultural groups. Sometimes the differences can make classroom-style\nteaching more challenging, but other times, as Anna Harris implied, they simply enrich classroom\nlife. To teach students well, we need to understand the important ways that they differ among\nthemselves, and when or how the differences really matter for their education. This chapter offers\nsome of that understanding and suggests how you might use it in order to make learning effective\nand enjoyable for everyone, including yourself.\nFor convenience we will make a major distinction between differences among individuals and\ndifferences among groups of students. As the term implies, individual differences are qualities\nthat are unique; just one person has them at a time. Variation in hair color, for example, is an\nindividual difference; even though some people have nearly the same hair color, no two people are\nexactly the same. Group differences are qualities shared by members of an identifiable group or\ncommunity, but not shared by everyone in society. An example is gender role: for better or for worse,\none portion of society (the males) is perceived differently and expected to behave a bit differently\nthan another portion of society (the females). Notice that distinguishing between individual and\ngroup differences is convenient, but a bit arbitrary. Individuals with similar, but nonetheless unique\nqualities sometimes group themselves together for certain purposes, and groups unusually contain a\nlot of individual diversity within them. If you happen to enjoy playing soccer and have some talent\nfor it (an individual quality), for example, you may end up as a member of a soccer team or club (a\ngroup defined by members\u2019 common desire and ability to play soccer). But though everyone on the\nteam fits a \u201csoccer player\u2019s profile\u201d at some level, individual members will probably vary in level of\nskill and motivation. The group, by its very nature, may obscure these signs of individuality.\nTo begin, then, we look at several differences normally considered to be individually rather than\ngroup based. This discussion will necessarily be incomplete simply because individual differences are\nso numerous and important in teaching that some of them are also discussed in later chapters. Later\nsections of this chapter deal with three important forms of group diversity: gender differences,\ncultural differences, and language differences.\nEducational Psychology 66 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nIndividual styles of learning and thinking\nAll of us, including our students, have preferred ways of learning. Teachers often refer to these differences as\nlearning styles, though this term may imply that students are more consistent across situations than is really the\ncase. One student may like to make diagrams to help remember a reading assignment, whereas another student\nmay prefer to write a sketchy outline instead. Yet in many cases, the students could in principle reverse the\nstrategies and still learn the material: if coaxed (or perhaps required), the diagram-maker could take notes for a\nchange and the note-taker could draw diagrams. Both would still learn, though neither might feel as comfortable as\nwhen using the strategies that they prefer. This reality suggests that a balanced, middle-of-the-road approach may\nbe a teacher\u2019s best response to students\u2019 learning styles. Or put another way, it is good to support students\u2019\npreferred learning strategies where possible and appropriate, but neither necessary nor desirable to do so all of the\ntime (Loo, 2004; Stahl, 2002). Most of all, it is neither necessary nor possible to classify or label students according\nto seemingly fixed learning styles and then allow them to learn only according to those styles. A student may prefer\nto hear new material rather than see it; he may prefer for you to explain something orally, for example, rather than\nto see it demonstrated in a video. But he may nonetheless tolerate or sometimes even prefer to see it demonstrated.\nIn the long run, in fact, he may learn it best by encountering the material in both ways, regardless of his habitual\npreferences.\nThat said, there is evidence that individuals, including students, do differ in how they habitually think. These\ndifferences are more specific than learning styles or preferences, and psychologists sometimes call them cognitive\nstyles, meaning typical ways of perceiving and remembering information, and typical ways of solving problems\nand making decisions (Zhang & Sternberg, 2006). In a style of thinking called field dependence, for example,\nindividuals perceive patterns as a whole rather than focus on the parts of the pattern separately. In a\ncomplementary tendency, called field independence, individuals are more inclined to analyze overall patterns\ninto their parts. Cognitive research from the 1940s to the present has found field dependence/independence\ndifferences to be somewhat stable for any given person across situations, though not completely so (Witkin, Moore,\nGoodenough, & Cox, 1977; Zhang & Sternberg, 2005). Someone who is field dependent (perceives globally or\n\u201cwholistically\u201d) in one situation, tends to a modest extent to perceive things globally or wholistically in other\nsituations. Field dependence and independence can be important in understanding students because the styles\naffect students\u2019 behaviors and preferences in school and classrooms. Field dependent persons tend to work better in\ngroups, it seems, and to prefer \u201copen-ended\u201d fields of study like literature and history. Field independent persons,\non the other hand, tend to work better alone and to prefer highly analytic studies like math and science. The\ndifferences are only a tendency, however, and there are a lot of students who contradict the trends. As with the\nbroader notion of learning styles, the cognitive styles of field dependence and independence are useful for tailoring\ninstruction to particular students, but their guidance is only approximate. They neither can nor should be used to\n\u201clock\u201d students to particular modes of learning or to replace students\u2019 own expressed preferences and choices about\ncurriculum.\nAnother cognitive style is impulsivity as compared to reflectivity. As the names imply, an impulsive cognitive\nstyle is one in which a person reacts quickly, but as a result makes comparatively more errors. A reflective style is\nthe opposite: the person reacts more slowly and therefore makes fewer errors. As you might expect, the reflective\nstyle would seem better suited to many academic demands of school. Research has found that this is indeed the\n67 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ncase for academic skills that clearly benefit from reflection, such as mathematical problem solving or certain\nreading tasks (Evans, 2004). Some classroom or school-related skills, however, may actually develop better if a\nstudent is relatively impulsive. Being a good partner in a cooperative learning group, for example, may depend\npartly on responding spontaneously (i.e. just a bit \u201cimpulsively\u201d) to others\u2019 suggestions; and being an effective\nmember of an athletic team may depend on not taking time to reflect carefully on every move that you or your team\nmates make.\nThere are two major ways to use knowledge of students\u2019 cognitive styles (Pritchard, 2005). The first and the\nmore obvious is to build on students\u2019 existing style strengths and preferences. A student who is field independent\nand reflective, for example, can be encouraged to explore tasks and activities that are relatively analytic and that\nrequire relatively independent work. One who is field dependent and impulsive, on the other hand, can be\nencouraged and supported to try tasks and activities that are more social or spontaneous. But a second, less obvious\nway to use knowledge of cognitive styles is to encourage more balance in cognitive styles for students who need it. A\nstudent who lacks field independence, for example, may need explicit help in organizing and analyzing key\nacademic tasks (like organizing a lab report in a science class). One who is already highly reflective may need\nencouragement to try ideas spontaneously, as in a creative writing lesson.\nMultiple intelligences\nFor nearly a century, educators and psychologists have debated the nature of intelligence, and more specifically\nwhether intelligence is just one broad ability or can take more than one form. Many classical definitions of the\nconcept have tended to define intelligence as a single broad ability that allows a person to solve or complete many\nsorts of tasks, or at least many academic tasks like reading, knowledge of vocabulary, and the solving of logical\nproblems (Garlick, 2002). There is research evidence of such a global ability, and the idea of general intelligence\noften fits with society\u2019s everyday beliefs about intelligence. Partly for these reasons, an entire mini-industry has\ngrown up around publishing tests of intelligence, academic ability, and academic achievement. Since these tests\naffect the work of teachers, I return to discussing them later in this book.\nBut there are also problems with defining intelligence as one general ability. One way of summing up the\nproblems is to say that conceiving of intelligence as something general tends to put it beyond teachers\u2019 influence.\nWhen viewed as a single, all-purpose ability, students either have a lot of intelligence or they do not, and\nstrengthening their intelligence becomes a major challenge, or perhaps even an impossible one (Gottfredson, 2004;\nLubinski, 2004). This conclusion is troubling to some educators, especially in recent years as testing school\nachievements have become more common and as students have become more diverse.\nBut alternate views of intelligence also exist that portray intelligence as having multiple forms, whether the\nforms are subparts of a single broader ability or are multiple \u201cintelligences\u201d in their own right. For various reasons\nsuch this perspective has gained in popularity among teachers in recent years, probably because it reflects many\nteachers\u2019 beliefs that students cannot simply be rated along a single scale of ability, but are fundamentally diverse\n(Kohn, 2004).\nOne of the most prominent of these models is Howard Gardner\u2019s theory of multiple intelligences\n(Gardner, 1983, 2003). Gardner proposes that there are eight different forms of intelligence, each of which\nfunctions independently of the others. (The eight intelligences are summarized in Table 11. Each person has a mix\nEducational Psychology 68 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nof all eight abilities\u2014more of one and less of another\u2014that helps to constitute that person\u2019s individual cognitive\nprofile. Since most tasks\u2014including most tasks in classrooms\u2014require several forms of intelligence and can be\ncompleted in more than one way, it is possible for people with various profiles of talents to succeed on a task\nequally well. In writing an essay, for example, a student with high interpersonal intelligence but rather average\nverbal intelligence might use his or her interpersonal strength to get a lot of help and advice from classmates and\nthe teacher. A student with the opposite profile might work well alone, but without the benefit of help from others.\nBoth students might end up with essays that are good, but good for different reasons.\nTable 11: Multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner\nForm of intelligence Examples of activities using the intelligence\nLinguistic: verbal skill; ability to use language well \u2022 verbal persuasion\n\u2022 writing a term paper skillfully\nMusical: ability to create and understand music \u2022 singing, playing a musical instrument\n\u2022 composing a tune\nLogical: Mathematical: logical skill; ability to reason, \u2022 solving mathematical problems easily and\noften using mathematics accurately\n\u2022 developing and testing hypotheses\nSpatial: ability to imagine and manipulate the \u2022 completing a difficult jigsaw puzzle\narrangement of objects in the environment\n\u2022 assembling a complex appliance (e.g. a bicycle)\nBodily: kinesthetic: sense of balance; coordination in \u2022 dancing\nuse of one's body\n\u2022 gymnastics\nInterpersonal: ability to discern others' nonverbal \u2022 sensing when to be tactful\nfeelings and thoughts\n\u2022 sensing a \u201csubtext\u201d or implied message in a\nperson's statements\nIntrapersonal: sensitivity to one's own thoughts and \u2022 noticing complex of ambivalent feelings in\nfeelings oneself\n\u2022 identifying true motives for an action in oneself\nNaturalist: sensitivity to subtle differences and \u2022 identifying examples of species of plants or\npatterns found in the natural environment animals\n\u2022 noticing relationships among species and\nnatural processes in the environment\n69 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nSource: Gardner, 1983, 2003\nAs evidence for the possibility of multiple intelligences, Gardner cites descriptions of individuals with\nexceptional talent in one form of intelligence (for example, in playing the piano) but who are neither above nor\nbelow average in other areas. He also cites descriptions of individuals with brain damage, some of whom lose one\nparticular form of intelligence (like the ability to talk) but retain other forms. In the opinion of many psychologists,\nhowever, the evidence for multiple intelligences is not strong enough to give up the \u201cclassical\u201d view of general\nintelligence. Part of the problem is that the evidence for multiple intelligences relies primarily on anecdotes\u2014\nexamples or descriptions of particular individuals who illustrate the model\u2014rather than on more widespread\ninformation or data (Eisner, 2004).\nNonetheless, whatever the status of the research evidence, the model itself can be useful as a way for teachers to\nthink about their work. Multiple intelligences suggest the importance of diversifying instruction in order to honor\nand to respond to diversity in students\u2019 talents and abilities. Viewed like this, whether Gardner\u2019s classification\nscheme is actually accurate is probably less important than the fact there is (or may be) more than one way to be\n\u201csmart\u201d. In the end, as with cognitive and learning styles, it may not be important to label students\u2019 talents or\nintellectual strengths. It may be more important simply to provide important learning and knowledge in several\nmodes or styles, ways that draw on more than one possible form of intelligence or skill. A good example of this\nprinciple is your own development in learning to teach. It is well and good to read books about teaching (like this\none, perhaps), but it is even better to read books and talk with classmates and educators about teaching and getting\nactual experience in classrooms. The combination both invites and requires a wide range of your talents and usually\nproves more effective than any single type of activity, whatever your profile of cognitive styles or intellectual\nabilities happens to be.\nGifted and talented students\nThe idea of multiple intelligences leads to new ways of thinking about students who have special gifts and\ntalents. Traditionally, the term gifted referred only to students with unusually high verbal skills. Their skills were\ndemonstrated especially well, for example, on standardized tests of general ability or of school achievement, like\nthose described in Chapter 12 (\u201cStandardized and other formal assessments\u201d). More recently, however, the meaning\nof gifted has broadened to include unusual talents in a range of activities, such as music, creative writing, or the arts\n(G. Davis & Rimm, 2004). To indicate the change, educators often use the dual term gifted and talented.\nQualities of the gifted and talented\nWhat are students who are gifted and talented like? Generally they show some combination of the following\nqualities:\n\u2022 They learn more quickly and independently than most students their own age.\n\u2022 They often have well-developed vocabulary, as well as advanced reading and writing skills.\n\u2022 They are very motivated, especially on tasks that are challenging or difficult.\n\u2022 They hold themselves to higher than usual standards of achievement.\nEducational Psychology 70 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nContrary to a common impression, students who are gifted or talented are not necessarily awkward socially, less\nhealthy, or narrow in their interests\u2014in fact, quite the contrary (Steiner & Carr, 2003). They also come from all\neconomic and cultural groups.\nIronically, in spite of their obvious strengths as learners, such students often languish in school unless teachers\ncan provide them with more than the challenges of the usual curriculum. A kindergarten child who is precociously\nadvanced in reading, for example, may make little further progress at reading if her teachers do not recognize and\ndevelop her skill; her talent may effectively disappear from view as her peers gradually catch up to her initial level.\nWithout accommodation to their unusual level of skill or knowledge, students who are gifted or talented can\nbecome bored by school, and eventually the boredom can even turn into behavior problems.\nPartly for these reasons, students who are gifted or talented have sometimes been regarded as the responsibility\nof special education, along with students with other sorts of disabilities. Often their needs are discussed, for\nexample, in textbooks about special education, alongside discussions of students with intellectual disabilities,\nphysical impairments, or major behavior disorders (Friend, 2008). There is some logic to this way of thinking\nabout their needs; after all, they are quite exceptional, and they do require modifications of the usual school\nprograms in order to reach their full potential. But it is also misleading to ignore obvious differences between\nexceptional giftedness and exceptional disabilities of other kinds. The key difference is in students' potential. By\ndefinition, students with gifts or talents are capable of creative, committed work at levels that often approach\ntalented adults. Other students\u2014including students with disabilities\u2014may reach these levels, but not as soon and\nnot as frequently. Many educators therefore think of the gifted and talented not as examples of students with\ndisabilities, but as examples of diversity. As such they are not so much the responsibility of special education\nspecialists, as the responsibility of all teachers to differentiate their instruction.\nSupporting students who are gifted and talented\nSupporting the gifted and talented usually involves a mixture of acceleration and enrichment of the usual\ncurriculum (Schiever & Maker, 2003). Acceleration involves either a child's skipping a grade, or else the teacher's\nredesigning the curriculum within a particular grade or classroom so that more material is covered faster. Either\nstrategy works, but only up to a point: children who have skipped a grade usually function well in the higher grade,\nboth academically and socially. Unfortunately skipping grades cannot happen repeatedly unless teacher, parents,\nand the students themselves are prepared to live with large age and maturity differences within single classrooms.\nIn itself, too, there is no guarantee that instruction in the new, higher-grade classroom will be any more stimulating\nthan it was in the former, lower-grade classroom. Redesigning the curriculum is also beneficial to the student, but\nimpractical to do on a widespread basis; even if teachers had the time to redesign their programs, many non-gifted\nstudents would be left behind as a result.\nEnrichment involves providing additional or different instruction added on to the usual curriculum goals and\nactivities. Instead of books at more advanced reading levels, for example, a student might read a wider variety of\ntypes of literature at the student's current reading level, or try writing additional types of literature himself. Instead\nof moving ahead to more difficult kinds of math programs, the student might work on unusual logic problems not\nassigned to the rest of the class. Like acceleration, enrichment works well up to a point. Enrichment curricula exist\nto help classroom teachers working with gifted students (and save teachers the time and work of creating\n71 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nenrichment materials themselves). Since enrichment is not part of the normal, officially sanctioned curriculum,\nhowever, there is a risk that it will be perceived as busywork rather than as intellectual stimulation, particularly if\nthe teacher herself is not familiar with the enrichment material or is otherwise unable to involve herself in the\nmaterial fully.\nObviously acceleration and enrichment can sometimes be combined. A student can skip a grade and also be\nintroduced to interesting \u201cextra\u201d material at the new grade level. A teacher can move a student to the next unit of\nstudy faster than she moves the rest of the class, while at the same time offering additional activities not related to\nthe unit of study directly. For a teacher with a student who is gifted or talented, however, the real challenge is not\nsimply to choose between acceleration and enrichment, but to observe the student, get to know him or her as a\nunique individual, and offer activities and supports based on that knowledge. This is essentially the challenge of\ndifferentiating instruction, something needed not just by the gifted and talented, but by students of all sorts. As you\nmight suspect, differentiating instruction poses challenges about managing instruction; we discuss it again in more\ndetail in Chapter 9 (\u201cFacilitating complex thinking\u201d) and Chapter 10 (\u201cInstructional planning\u201d).\nGender differences in the classroom\nGender roles are the patterns of behaviors, attitudes, and expectations associated with a particular sex\u2014with\nbeing either male or female. For clarity, psychologists sometimes distinguish gender differences, which are related\nto social roles, from sex differences, which are related only to physiology and anatomy. Using this terminology,\ngender matters in teaching more than sex (in spite of any jokes told about the latter!).\nAlthough there are many exceptions, boys and girls do differ on average in ways that parallel conventional\ngender stereotypes and that affect how the sexes behave at school and in class. The differences have to do with\nphysical behaviors, styles of social interaction, academic motivations, behaviors, and choices. They have a variety of\nsources\u2014primarily parents, peers, and the media. Teachers are certainly not the primary cause of gender role\ndifferences, but sometimes teachers influence them by their responses to and choices made on behalf of students.\nPhysical differences in gender roles\nPhysically, boys tend to be more active than girls, and by the same token more restless if they have to sit for long\nperiods. They are also more prone than girls to rely on physical aggression if they are frustrated (Espelage &\nSwearer, 2004). Both tendencies are inconsistent with the usual demands of classroom life, of course, and make it a\nlittle more likely that school will be a difficult experience for boys, even for boys who never actually get in trouble\nfor being restless or aggressive.\nDuring the first two or three years of elementary school, gross motor skills develop at almost the same average\nrate for boys and girls. As a group, both sexes can run, jump, throw a ball, and the like with about equal ease,\nthough there are of course wide significant differences among individuals of both sexes. Toward the end of\nelementary school, however, boys pull ahead of girls at these skills even though neither sex has begun yet to\nexperience puberty. The most likely reason is that boys participate more actively in formal and informal sports\nbecause of expectations and support from parents, peers, and society (Braddock, Sokol-Katz, Greene, & Basinger-\nFleischman, 2005; Messner, Duncan, & Cooky, 2003). Puberty eventually adds to this advantage by making boys\ntaller and stronger than girls, on average, and therefore more suited at least for sports that rely on height and\nstrength.\nEducational Psychology 72 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nIn thinking about these differences, keep in mind that they refer to average trends and that there are numerous\nindividual exceptions. Every teacher knows of individual boys who are not athletic, for example, or of particular\ngirls who are especially restless in class. The individual differences mean, among other things, that it is hard to\njustify providing different levels of support or resources to boys than to girls for sports, athletics, or physical\neducation. The differences also suggest, though, that individual students who contradict gender stereotypes about\nphysical abilities may benefit from emotional support or affirmation from teachers, simply because they may be less\nlikely than usual to get such affirmation from elsewhere.\nSocial differences in gender roles\nWhen relaxing socially, boys more often gravitate to large groups. Whether on the playground, in a school\nhallway, or on the street, boys\u2019 social groups tend literally to fill up a lot of space, and often include significant\namounts of roughhousing as well as organized and \u201csemi-organized\u201d competitive games or sports (Maccoby, 2002).\nGirls, for their part, are more likely to seek and maintain one or two close friends and to share more intimate\ninformation and feelings with these individuals. To the extent that these gender differences occur, they can make\ngirls less visible or noticeable than boys, at least in leisure play situations where children or youth choose their\ncompanions freely. As with physical differences, however, keep in mind that differences in social interactions do\nnot occur uniformly for all boys and girls. There are boys with close friends, contradicting the general trend, and\ngirls who play primarily in large groups.\nDifferences in social interaction styles happen in the classroom as well. Boys, on average, are more likely to\nspeak up during a class discussion\u2014sometimes even if not called on, or even if they do not know as much about the\ntopic as others in the class (Sadker, 2002). When working on a project in a small co-ed group, furthermore they\nhave a tendency to ignore girls\u2019 comments and contributions to the group. In this respect co-ed student groups\nparallel interaction patterns in many parts of society, where men also have a tendency to ignore women\u2019s comments\nand contributions (Tannen, 2001).\nAcademic and cognitive differences in gender\nOn average, girls are more motivated than boys to perform well in school, at least during elementary school. By\nthe time girls reach high school, however, some may try to down play their own academic ability in order make\nthemselves more likeable by both sexes (Davies, 2005). Even if this occurs, though, it does not affect their grades:\nfrom kindergarten through twelfth grade, girls earn slightly higher average grades than boys (Freeman, 2004). This\nfact does not lead to similar achievement, however, because as youngsters move into high school, they tend to\nchoose courses or subjects conventionally associated with their gender\u2014math and science for boys, in particular,\nand literature and the arts for girls. By the end of high school, this difference in course selection makes a\nmeasurable difference in boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 academic performance in these subjects.\nBut again, consider my caution about stereotyping: there are individuals of both sexes whose behaviors and\nchoices run counter to the group trends. (I have made this point as well in \u201cPreparing for Licensure: Interpreting\nGender-Related Behavior\u201d by deliberately concealing the gender of a student described.) Differences within each\ngender group generally are far larger than any differences between the groups. A good example is the \u201cdifference\u201d in\ncognitive ability of boys and girls. Many studies have found none at all. A few others have found small differences,\nwith boys slightly better at math and girls slightly better at reading and literature. Still other studies have found the\n73 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ndifferences not only are small, but have been getting smaller in recent years compared to earlier studies.\nCollectively the findings about cognitive abilities are virtually \u201cnon-findings\u201d, and it is worth asking why gender\ndifferences have therefore been studied and discussed so much for so many years (Hyde, 2005). How teachers\ninfluence gender roles?\nTeachers often intend to interact with both sexes equally, and frequently succeed at doing so. Research has\nfound, though, that they do sometimes respond to boys and girls differently, perhaps without realizing it. Three\nkinds of differences have been noticed. The first is the overall amount of attention paid to each sex; the second is\nthe visibility or \u201cpublicity\u201d of conversations; and the third is the type of behavior that prompts teachers to support\nor criticize students.\nAttention paid\nIn general, teachers interact with boys more often than with girls by a margin of 10 to 30 percent, depending on\nthe grade level of the students and the personality of the teacher (Measor & Sykes, 1992). One possible reason for\nthe difference is related to the greater assertiveness of boys that I already noted; if boys are speaking up more\nfrequently in discussions or at other times, then a teacher may be \u201cforced\u201d to pay more attention to them. Another\npossibility is that some teachers may feel that boys are especially prone to getting into mischief, so they may\ninteract with them more frequently to keep them focused on the task at hand (Erden & Wolfgang, 2004). Still\nanother possibility is that boys, compared to girls, may interact in a wider variety of styles and situations, so there\nmay simply be richer opportunities to interact with them. This last possibility is partially supported by another\ngender difference in classroom interaction, the amount of public versus private talk.\nPublic talk versus private talk\nTeachers have a tendency to talk to boys from a greater physical distance than when they talk to girls (Wilkinson\n& Marrett, 1985). The difference may be both a cause and an effect of general gender expectations, expressive\nnurturing is expected more often of girls and women, and a businesslike task orientation is expected more often of\nboys and men, particularly in mixed-sex groups (Basow & Rubenfeld, 2003; Myaskovsky, Unikel, & Dew, 2005).\nWhatever the reason, the effect is to give interactions with boys more \u201cpublicity\u201d. When two people converse with\neach other from across the classroom, many others can overhear them; when they are at each other\u2019s elbows,\nthough, few others can overhear.\nDistributing praise and criticism\nIn spite of most teachers\u2019 desire to be fair to all students, it turns out that they sometimes distribute praise and\ncriticism differently to boys and girls. The differences are summarized in Table 4.2. The tendency is to praise boys\nmore than girls for displaying knowledge correctly, but to criticize girls more than boys for displaying knowledge\nincorrectly (Golombok & Fivush, 1994; Delamont, 1996). Another way of stating this difference is by what teachers\ntend to overlook: with boys, they tend to overlook wrong answers, but with girls, they tend to overlook right\nanswers. The result (which is probably unintended) is a tendency to make boys\u2019 knowledge seem more important\nand boys themselves more competent. A second result is the other side of this coin: a tendency to make girls\u2019\nknowledge less visible and girls themselves less competent.\nTable 12: Gender differences in how teachers praise and criticize students\nType of response from Boys Girls\nEducational Psychology 74 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nteacher\nPraises Correct knowledge \u201cGood\u201d or compliant behavior\nOverlooks or ignores \u201cGood\u201d or compliant behavior; Misbehavior; correct knowledge\nincorrect knowledge\nCriticizes Misbehavior Incorrect knowledge\nSource: Golobuk & Fivush, 1994\nGender differences also occur in the realm of classroom behavior. Teachers tend to praise girls for \u201cgood\u201d\nbehavior, regardless of its relevance to content or to the lesson at hand, and tend to criticize boys for \u201cbad\u201d or\ninappropriate behavior (Golombok & Fivush, 1994). This difference can also be stated in terms of what teachers\noverlook: with girls, they tend to overlook behavior that is not appropriate, but with boys they tend to overlook\nbehavior that is appropriate. The net result in this case is to make girls\u2019 seem more good than they may really be,\nand also to make their \u201cgoodness\u201d seem more important than their academic competence. By the same token, the\nteacher\u2019s patterns of response imply that boys are more \u201cbad\u201d than they may really be.\nAt first glance, the gender differences in interaction can seem discouraging and critical of teachers because they\nimply that teachers as a group are biased about gender. But this conclusion is too simplistic for a couple of reasons.\nOne is that like all differences between groups, interaction patterns are trends, and as such they hide a lot of\nvariation within them. The other is that the trends suggest what often tends in fact to happen, not what can in fact\nhappen if a teacher consciously sets about to avoid interaction patterns like the ones I have described. Fortunately\nfor us all, teaching does not need to be unthinking; we have choices that we can make, even during a busy class!\nDifferences in cultural expectations and styles\nA culture is the system of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that constitute the distinctive way of life of a people.\nAlthough sometimes the term is also used to refer specifically to the artistic, intellectual and other \u201chigh-brow\u201d\naspects of life, I use it here more broadly to refer to everything that characterizes a way of life\u2014baseball games as\nwell as symphony concerts, and McDonald\u2019s as well as expensive restaurants. In this broad sense culture is nearly\nsynonymous with ethnicity, which refers to the common language, history, and future experienced by a group\nwithin society. Culture has elements that are obvious, like unique holidays or customs, but also features that are\nsubtle or easy for outsiders to overlook, like beliefs about the nature of intelligence or about the proper way to tell a\nstory. When a classroom draws students from many cultures or ethnic groups, therefore, the students bring to it\nconsiderable diversity. Teachers need to understand that diversity\u2014understand how students\u2019 habitual attitudes,\nbeliefs, and behaviors differ from each other, and especially how they differ from the teacher\u2019s.\nBut this kind of understanding can get complicated. To organize the topic, therefore, I will discuss aspects of\ncultural diversity according to how directly they relate to language differences compared to differences in other\nsocial and psychological features of culture. The distinction is convenient, but it is also a bit arbitrary because, as\nyou will see, the features of a culture overlap and influence each other.\n75 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nBilingualism: language differences in the classroom\nAlthough monolingual speakers often do not realize it, the majority of children around the world are bilingual,\nmeaning that they understand and use two languages (Meyers-Scotton, 2005). Even in the United States, which is a\nrelatively monolingual society, more than 47 million people speak a language other than English at home, and\nabout 10 million of these people were children or youths in public schools (United States Department of Commerce,\n2003). The large majority of bilingual students (75 per cent) are Hispanic, but the rest represent more than a\nhundred different language groups from around the world. In larger communities throughout the United States, it\nis therefore common for a single classroom to contain students from several language backgrounds at once.\nIn classrooms as in other social settings, bilingualism exists in different forms and degrees. At one extreme are\nstudents who speak both English and another language fluently; at the other extreme are those who speak only\nlimited versions of both languages. In between are students who speak their home (or heritage) language much\nbetter than English, as well as others who have partially lost their heritage language in the process of learning\nEnglish (Tse, 2001). Commonly, too, a student may speak a language satisfactorily, but be challenged by reading or\nwriting it\u2014though even this pattern has individual exceptions. Whatever the case, each bilingual student poses\nunique challenges to teachers.\nBalanced or fluent bilingualism\nThe student who speaks both languages fluently has a definite cognitive advantage. As you might suspect and as\nresearch has confirmed, a fully fluent bilingual student is in a better position than usual to express concepts or\nideas in more than one way, and to be aware of doing so (Jimenez, et al. 1995; Francis, 2006). The question: \u201cWhat\nif a dog were called a cat?\u201d is less likely to confuse even a very young bilingual child. Nor will the follow-up\nquestion: \u201cCould the \u2018cat\u2019 meow?\u201d confuse them. Such skill in reflecting on language is a form of metacognition,\nwhich I discussed in Chapter 2 and defined as using language as an object of thought. Metacognition can be helpful\nfor a variety of academic purposes, such as writing stories and essays, or interpreting complex text materials.\nUnbalanced bilingualism\nUnfortunately, the bilingualism of many students is \u201cunbalanced\u201d in the sense that they are either still learning\nEnglish, or else they have lost some earlier ability to use their original, heritage language\u2014or occasionally a bit of\nboth. The first sort of student\u2014sometimes called an English language learner (ELL) or limited English learner\n(LEL)\u2014has received the greatest attention and concern from educators, since English is the dominant language of\ninstruction and skill and obviously helps prepare a student for life in American society. ELL students essentially\npresent teachers with this dilemma: how to respect the original language and culture of the student while also\nhelping the student to join more fully in the mainstream\u2014i.e. English-speaking\u2014culture? Programs to address this\nquestion have ranged from total immersion in English from a young age (the \u201csink or swim\u201d approach) to phasing\nin English over a period of several years (sometimes called an additive approach to bilingual education). In general,\nevaluations of bilingual programs have favored the more additive approaches (Beykont, 2002). Both languages are\ndeveloped and supported, and students ideally become able to use either language permanently, though often for\ndifferent situations or purposes. A student may end up using English in the classroom or at work, for example, but\ncontinue using Spanish at home or with friends, even though he or she is perfectly capable of speaking English with\nthem.\nEducational Psychology 76 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nLanguage loss\nWhat about the other kind of imbalance, in which a student is acquiring English but losing ability with the\nstudent\u2019s home or heritage language? This sort of bilingualism is quite common in the United States and other\nnations with immigrant populations (Tse, 2001). Imagine this situation: First-generation immigrants arrive, and\nthey soon learn just enough English to manage their work and daily needs, but continue using their original\nlanguage at home with family and friends from their former country. Their children, however, experience strong\nexpectations and pressure to learn and use English, and this circumstance dilutes the children\u2019s experience with the\nheritage language. By the time the children become adults, they are likely to speak and write English better than\ntheir heritage language, and may even be unable or unwilling to use the heritage language with their own children\n(the grandchildren of the original immigrants).\nThis situation might not at first seem like a problem for which we, as teachers, need to take responsibility, since\nthe children immigrants, as students, are acquiring the dominant language of instruction. In fact, however, things\nare not that simple. Research finds that language loss limits students\u2019 ability to learn English as well or as quickly as\nthey otherwise can do. Having a large vocabulary in a first language, for example, has been shown to save time in\nlearning vocabulary in a second language (Hansen, Umeda & McKinney, 2002). But students can only realize the\nsavings if their first language is preserved. Preserving the first language is also important if a student has impaired\nskill in all languages and therefore needs intervention or help from a speech-language specialist. Research has\nfound, in such cases, that the specialist can be more effective if the specialist speaks and uses the first language as\nwell as English (Kohnert, et al., 2005). Generally, though also more indirectly, minimizing language loss helps all\nbilingual students\u2019 education because preservation tends to enrich students\u2019 and parents\u2019 ability to communicate\nwith each other. With two languages to work with, parents can stay \u201cin the loop\u201d better about their children\u2019s\neducations and support the teacher\u2019s work\u2014for example, by assisting more effectively with homework (Ebert,\n2005).\nNote that in the early years of schooling, language loss can be minimized to some extent by the additive or\nparallel-track bilingual programs that I mentioned above. For a few years, though not forever, young students are\nencouraged to use both of their languages. In high school, in addition, some conventional foreign language classes\u2014\nnotably in Spanish\u2014can be adjusted to include and support students who are already native speakers of the\nlanguage alongside students who are learning it for the first time (Tse, 2001). But for heritage languages not\nnormally offered as \u201cforeign\u201d languages in school, of course, this approach will not work. Such languages are\nespecially at risk for being lost.\nCultural differences in language use\nCultures and ethnic groups differ not only in languages, but also in how languages are used. Since some of the\npatterns differ from those typical of modern classrooms, they can create misunderstandings between teachers and\nstudents (Cazden, 2001; Rogers, et al., 2005). Consider these examples: In some cultures, it is considered polite or\neven intelligent not to speak unless you have something truly important to say. \u201cChitchat\u201d, or talk that simply\naffirms a personal tie between people, is considered immature or intrusive (Minami, 2002). In a classroom, this\nhabit can make it easier for a child to learn not to interrupt others, but it can also make the child seem unfriendly.\n77 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u2022 Eye contact varies by culture. In many African American and Latin American communities, it is considered\nappropriate and respectful for a child not to look directly at an adult who is speaking to them (Torres-\nGuzman, 1998). In classrooms, however, teachers often expect a lot of eye contact (as in \u201cI want all eyes on\nme!\u201d) and may be tempted to construe lack of eye contact as a sign of indifference or disrespect.\n\u2022 Social distance varies by culture. In some cultures, it is common to stand relatively close when having a\nconversation; in others, it is more customary to stand relatively far apart (Beaulieu, 2004). Problems may\nhappen when a teacher and a student prefer different social distances. A student who expects a closer\ndistance than does the teacher may seem overly familiar or intrusive, whereas one who expects a longer\ndistance may seem overly formal or hesitant.\n\u2022 Wait time varies by culture. Wait time is the gap between the end of one person\u2019s comment or question and\nthe next person\u2019s reply or answer. In some cultures wait time is relatively long\u2014as long as three or four\nseconds (Tharp & Gallimore, 1989). In others it is a \u201cnegative\u201d gap, meaning that it is acceptable, even\nexpected, for a person to interrupt before the end of the previous comment. In classrooms the wait time is\ncustomarily about one second; after that, the teacher is likely to move on to another question or to another\nstudent. A student who habitually expects a wait time long than one second may seem hesitant, and not be\ngiven many chances to speak. A student who expects a \u201cnegative\u201d wait time, on the other hand, may seem\novereager or even rude.\n\u2022 In most non-Anglo cultures, questions are intended to gain information, and it is assumed that a person\nasking the question truly does not have the information requested (Rogoff, 2003). In most classrooms,\nhowever, teachers regularly ask test questions, which are questions to which the teacher already knows the\nanswer and that simply assess whether a student knows the answer as well (Macbeth, 2003). The question:\n\u201cHow much is 2 + 2?\u201d for example, is a test question. If the student is not aware of this purpose, he or she\nmay become confused, or think that the teacher is surprisingly ignorant! Worse yet, the student may feel\nthat the teacher is trying deliberately to shame the student by revealing the student\u2019s ignorance or\nincompetence to others.\nCultural differences in attitudes and beliefs\nIn addition to differences in language and in practices related to language, cultural groups differ in a variety of\nother attitudes and beliefs. Complete descriptions of the details of the differences have filled entire books of\nencyclopedias (see, for example, Birx, 2005). For teachers, however, the most important ones center on beliefs\nabout identity, or the sense of self, or of \u201cwho you are\u201d. A number of other cultural beliefs and practices can be\nunderstood as resulting from how members of a culture think about personal identity.\nIn white, middle-class American culture, the self is usually thought of as unique and independent\u2014a unitary,\nliving source of decisions, choices, and actions that stands (or should eventually stand) by itself (Greenfield, et al.,\n2003; Rogoff, 2003). This view of the self is well entrenched in schools, as for example when students are expected\nto take responsibility for their own successes or failures and when they are tested and evaluated individually rather\nthan as a group or team. As teachers, furthermore, most of us subscribe to the idea that all students are unique,\neven if we cannot implement this idea fully in teaching because of the constraints of large classes. Whatever the\ncircumstances, teachers tend to believe in an independent self.\nEducational Psychology 78 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nTo a greater or lesser extent, however, the majority of non-white cultures and ethnic groups believe in something\ncloser to an interdependent self, or a belief that it is your relationships and responsibilities, and not uniqueness\nand autonomy, that defines a person (Greenfield, 1994; Greenfield, et al., 2003). In these cultures, the most worthy\nperson is not the one who is unusual or who stands out in a crowd. Such a person might actually be regarded as\nlonely or isolated. The worthy person is instead the one who gets along well with family and friends, and who meets\nobligations to them reliably and skillfully. At some level, of course, we all value interpersonal skill and to this extent\nthink of ourselves as interdependent. The difference between individual and interdependent self is one of emphasis,\nwith many non-white cultures emphasizing interdependence significantly more than white middle-class society in\ngeneral and more than schools in particular.\nThere can be consequences of the difference in how the students respond to school. Here are some of the\npossibilities\u2014though keep in mind that there are also differences among students as individuals, whatever their\ncultural background. I am talking about tendencies, not straightforward predictions.\n\u2022 Preference for activities that are cooperative rather than competitive: Many activities in school are\ncompetitive, even when teachers try to de-emphasize the competition. Once past the first year or second\nyear of school, students often become attentive to who receives the highest marks on an assignment, for\nexample, or who is the best athlete at various sports or whose contributions to class discussion the most\nverbal recognition from the teacher (Johnson & Johnson, 1998). Suppose, in addition, that a teacher\ndeliberately organizes important activities or assignments competitively (as in \u201cLet\u2019s see who finishes the\nmath sheet first.\u201d). Classroom life can then become explicitly competitive, and the competitive atmosphere\ncan interfere with cultivating supportive relationships among students or between students and the teacher\n(Cohen, 2004). For students who give priority to these relationships, competition can seem confusing at\nbest and threatening at worst. What sort of sharing or helping with answers, the student may ask, is truly\nlegitimate? If the teacher answers this question more narrowly than does the student, then what the\nstudent views as cooperative sharing may be seen by the teacher as laziness, \u201cfreeloading\u201d, or even cheating.\n\u2022 Avoidance of standing out publicly: Even when we, as teachers, avoid obvious forms of competition, we\nmay still interact frequently with students one at a time while allowing or inviting many others to observe\nthe conversation. An especially common pattern for such conversations is sometimes called the IRE cycle,\nan abbreviation for the teacher initiating, a student responding, and the teacher then evaluating the\nresponse (Mehan, 1979). What is sometimes taken for granted is how often IRE cycles are witnessed\npublicly, and how much the publicity can be stressful or embarrassing for students who do not value\nstanding out in a group but who do value belonging to the group. The embarrassment can be especially\nacute if they feel unsure about whether they have correct knowledge or skill to display. To keep such\nstudents from \u201cclamming up\u201d completely, therefore, teachers should consider limiting IRE cycles to times\nwhen they are truly productive. IRE conversations may often work best when talking with a student\nprivately, or when confirming knowledge that the student is likely to be able to display competently already,\nor when \u201cchoral\u201d speaking (responding together in unison) is appropriate.\n\u2022 Interpersonal time versus clock time: In order to function, all schools rely on fairly precise units of time as\nmeasured on clocks. Teachers typically allot a fixed number of minutes to one lesson or class, another fixed\n79 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nnumber of minutes for the next, another for recess or lunch time, and so on. In more ways than one,\ntherefore, being on time becomes especially valued in schools, as it is in many parts of society. Punctuality\nis not always conducive, however, to strong personal relationships, which develop best when individuals do\nnot end joint activities unilaterally or arbitrarily, but allow activities to \u201cfinish themselves\u201d, so to speak\u2014to\nfinish naturally. If personal relationships are a broad, important priority for a student, therefore, it may\ntake effort and practice by the student to learn the extent to which schools and teachers expect punctuality.\nPunctuality includes the obvious, like showing up for school when school is actually scheduled to begin. But\nit also includes subtleties, like starting and finishing tasks when the teacher tells students to do so, or\nanswering a question promptly at the time it is asked rather than sometime later when discussion has\nalready moved on.\nAccommodating diversity in practice\nHopefully I have persuaded you\u2014if you did need persuading\u2014that students are indeed diverse. The important\nquestion that follows from this point is what to do about the diversity. I have begun answering that question by\nincluding a number of suggestions in the sections and paragraphs of this chapter. But there is obviously more to be\nsaid about accommodating diversity\u2014about actually working with students\u2019 diversity and turning it into a resource\nrather than a burden or challenge. In the rest of this book therefore I offer more suggestions not only about\nknowing how different one student can be from another, but also about diversifying teaching to acknowledge this\nfact. Differences among students remain a challenge during all phases of teaching, from planning instruction, to\nimplementing lessons and activities, to assessing students\u2019 learning after lessons or activities are all finished. In the\nnext chapter, I illustrate this reality by describing how students with disabilities can be included in classroom life\u2014\none of the more telling examples of accommodating to diversity.\nChapter summary\nStudents differ in a multitude of ways, both individually and as groups. Individually, for example, students have\na preferred learning style as well as preferred cognitive or thinking styles. They also have unique profiles or\nintelligence or competence that affect how and what they learn most successfully.\nIn addition to individual diversity, students tend to differ according to their gender, although there are\nnumerous individual exceptions. Motor abilities as well as motivation and experience with athletics gradually\ndifferentiate boys and girls, especially when they reach and begin high school. Socially, boys tend to adopt\nrelationships that are more active and wide-ranging than do girls. Academically, girls tend to be a bit more\nmotivated to receive slightly higher marks in school. Teachers sometimes contribute to gender role differences\u2014\nperhaps without intending\u2014by paying attention to boys more frequently and more publicly in class, and by\ndistributing praise and criticism in ways differentiated by sex.\nStudents also differ according to cultures, language, and ethnic groups of their families. Many students are\nbilingual, with educational consequences that depend on their fluency in each of their two languages. If they have\nmore difficulty with English, then programs that add their first language together with English have proved to be\nhelpful. If they have more difficulty with their first language, they are risk for language loss, and the consequences\nare also negative even if more hidden from teachers\u2019 views.\nEducational Psychology 80 A Global Text 4. Student diversity\nIn addition to language differences as such, students differ according to culture in how language is used or\npracticed\u2014in taking turns at speaking, in eye contact, social distance, wait time, and the use of questions. Some of\nthese differences in practice stem from cultural differences in attitudes about self-identity, with non-Anglo\nculturally tending to support a more interdependent view of the self than Anglo culture or the schools. Differences\nin attitudes and in use of language have several consequences for teachers. In particular\u2014where appropriate\u2014they\nshould consider using cooperative activities, avoid highlighting individuals\u2019 accomplishments or failures, and be\npatient about students\u2019 learning to be punctual.\nOn the Internet\n<www.nabe.org> This is the website for the National Association of Bilingual Educators, which represents\nboth English Language Learners and their teachers.

Students with special\neducational needs\nThree people on the margins\nThe first person: In 1761 a six-year-old girl was captured from West Africa, given the name Phillis\nWheatley, and sold into slavery in the City of Boston in Colonial America. By the time she was 17,\nPhillis had taught herself to read and write and had developed a special love and talent for poetry. Her\nowner was a wealthy businessman and sought to improve his reputation by publishing an anthology of\nher poems. Unfortunately he encountered stiff resistance from publishers because few people at that\ntime believed Africans to be capable of the thought and imagination needed to write poetry. People\nwho heard of her poetry were skeptical and inclined to think that it was faked. Eventually, to save his\nown reputation, the owner assembled a tribunal of 18 prominent judges\u2014including the governor of\nMassachusetts and John Hancock, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence\u2014to assess the\nyoung woman\u2019s mental capacity. After cross-examining her, the judges finally decided that Ms\nWheatley was, after all, capable of writing poetry (Robinson, 1982).\nThe second person: A century later, a child named Helen Keller lost her sight and hearing as a\nresult of illness during infancy. In spite of this misfortune, though, Helen devised a language of\ngestural signs for communicating with a tutor, and was soon also using Braille to study both French\nand Latin. At ten, she wrote and published a short story. Yet like Ms Wheatley, Ms Keller also faced\nsubstantial, chronic skepticism about her capacities. Prominent educators accused her of plagiarizing\nothers\u2019 writings and merely \u201cparroting\u201d others\u2019 ideas without understanding them (Keller, 1954;\nBogdan, 2006). Eventually, as with Wheatley, a panel was assembled\u2014though this time the members\nwere professional experts about disabilities\u2014to determine whether Ms Keller was in fact capable of\nwriting what she published. The panel decided that she was indeed capable, though only by a slim\nmargin (five judges vs four).\nThe third person: In 1978, Sue Rubin was born with a disability that limited her speech to\ndisordered bursts of sound and occasionally echoing phrases of other people. She was labeled autistic\nbecause of her symptoms, and assumed to be profoundly retarded. With support and encouragement\nfrom her mother and others, however, Sue eventually learned to type on a keyboard without assistance.\nShe learned to communicate effectively when she was about 13 and was able to go to school. Since then\nshe has made many presentations about autism at conferences and recently co-edited a book about\nautism, titled Autism: The Myth of the Person Alone (Bogdan, et al., 2005).\nOne of these individuals experienced racial discrimination and the other two experienced physical disabilities,\nbut notice something important: that all three were defined by society as disabled intellectually. Initially, their\nEducational Psychology 85 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nachievements were dismissed because of widespread assumptions\u2014whether about race or disability\u2014of their\ninherent incompetence. All three had to work harder than usual, not only to acquire literacy itself, but also to prove\nthat their literacy was genuine and worthy of respect.\nSince the time of Phillis Wheatley, North American society has eliminated slavery and made some progress at\nreducing certain forms of racism, though much remains to be done. In 1954, for example, the United States\nSupreme Court ruled that public schools could not be segregated by race, and in doing so recognized, at least\nlegally, the intellectual competence of African-Americans as well as the moral obligation of society to provide all\ncitizens with the best possible education. It has taken longer to recognize legally the rights and competence of\npersons with disabilities, but events and trends beginning in the 1970s have begun to make it happen. This chapter\nbegins by explaining some of these and how they have altered the work of teachers.\nGrowing support for people with disabilities: legislation and its effects\nSince the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people with disabilities\ninto a wide variety of \u201cregular\u201d activities. In the United States, the shift is illustrated clearly in the Federal\nlegislation that was enacted during this time. The legislation partly stimulated the change in attitudes, but at the\nsame time they partly resulted from the change. Three major laws were passed that guaranteed the rights of\npersons with disabilities, and of children and students with disabilities in particular. Although the first two affected\nteachers\u2019 work in the classroom, the third has had the biggest impact on education.\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504\nThis law\u2014the first of its kind\u2014required that individuals with disabilities be accommodated in any program or\nactivity that receives Federal funding (PL 93-112, 1973). Although this law was not intended specifically for\neducation, in practice it has protected students\u2019 rights in some extra-curricular activities (for older students) and in\nsome child care or after-school care programs (for younger students). If those programs receive Federal funding of\nany kind, the programs are not allowed to exclude children or youths with disabilities, and they have to find\nreasonable ways to accommodate the individuals\u2019 disabilities.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ADA).\nThis legislation also prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability, just as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\nAct had done (PL 101-336, 1990). Although the ADA also applies to all people (not just to students), its provisions\nare more specific and \u201cstronger\u201d than those of Section 504. In particular, ADA extends to all employment and jobs,\nnot just those receiving Federal funding. It also specifically requires accommodations to be made in public facilities\nsuch as with buses, restrooms, and telephones. ADA legislation is therefore responsible for some of the \u201cminor\u201d\nrenovations in schools that you may have noticed in recent years, like wheelchair-accessible doors, ramps, and\nrestrooms, and public telephones with volume controls.\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA)\nAs its name implied this legislation was more focused on education than either Section 504 or ADA. It was first\npassed in 1975 and has been amended several times since, including most recently in 2004 (PL 108-446, 2004). In\nits current form, the law guarantees the following rights related to education for anyone with a disability from birth\nto age 21. The first two influence schooling in general, but the last three affect the work of classroom teachers rather\ndirectly:\n86 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u2022 Free, appropriate education: An individual or an individual\u2019s family should not have to pay for education\nsimply because the individual has a disability, and the educational program should be truly educational (i.e.\nnot merely care-taking or \u201cbabysitting\u201d of the person).\n\u2022 Due process: In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the schools or other\nprofessionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements that are fair and accessible to all\nparties\u2014including the person himself or herself or the person\u2019s representative.\n\u2022 Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability: Tests or other evaluations should not assume test-\ntaking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected to have, such as holding a pencil,\nhearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or understanding and speaking orally. Evaluation procedures\nshould be modified to allow for these differences. This provision of the law applies both to evaluations made\nby teachers and to school-wide or \u201chigh-stakes\u201d testing programs.\n\u2022 Education in the \u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d: Education for someone with a disability should provide as\nmany educational opportunities and options for the person as possible, both in the short term and in the\nlong term. In practice this requirement has meant including students in regular classrooms and school\nactivities as much as possible, though often not totally.\n\u2022 An individualized educational program: Given that every disability is unique, instructional planning for a\nperson with a disability should be unique or individualized as well. In practice this provision has led to\nclassroom teachers planning individualized programs jointly with other professionals (like reading\nspecialists, psychologists, or medical personnel) as part of a team.\nConsidered together, these provisions are both a cause and an effect of basic democratic philosophy. The\nlegislation says, in effect, that all individuals should have access to society in general and to education in particular.\nAlthough teachers certainly support this philosophy in broad terms, and many have welcomed the IDEA legislation,\nothers have found the prospect of applying it in classrooms leads to a number of questions and concerns. Some ask,\nfor example, whether a student with a disability will disrupt the class; others, whether the student will interfere\nwith covering the curriculum; still others, whether the student might be teased by classmates. Since these are\nlegitimate concerns, I will return to them at the end of this chapter. First, however, let me clarify exactly how the\nIDEA legislation affects the work of teachers, and then describe in more detail the major disabilities that you are\nlikely to encounter in students.\nResponsibilities of teachers for students with disabilities\nThe IDEA legislation has affected the work of teachers by creating three new expectations. The first expectation\nis to provide alternative methods of assessment for students with disabilities; the second is to arrange a learning\nenvironment that is as normal or as \u201cleast restrictive\u201d as possible; and the third is to participate in creating\nindividual educational plans for students with disabilities.\nAlternative assessments\nIn the context of students with disabilities, assessment refers to gathering information about a student in\norder both to identify the strengths of the student, and to decide what special educational support, if any, the\nstudent needs. In principle, of course, these are tasks that teachers have for all students: assessment is a major\nEducational Psychology 87 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nreason why we give tests and assignments, for example, and why we listen carefully to the quality of students\u2019\ncomments during class discussions. For students with disabilities, however, such traditional or conventional\nstrategies of assessment often seriously underestimate the students\u2019 competence (Koretz & Barton, 2003/2004;\nPullin, 2005). Depending on the disability, a student may have trouble with (a) holding a pencil, (b) hearing a\nquestion clearly, (c) focusing on a picture, (d) marking an answer in time even when he or she knows the answer,\n(e) concentrating on a task in the presence of other people, or (f) answering a question at the pace needed by the\nrest of the class. Traditionally, teachers have assumed that all students either have these skills or can learn them\nwith just modest amounts of coaching, encouragement, and will power. For many other students, for example, it\nmay be enough to say something like: \u201cRemember to listen to the question carefully!\u201d For students with disabilities,\nhowever, a comment like this may not work and may even be insensitive. A student with visual impairment does\nnot need be reminded to \u201clook closely at what I am writing on the board\u201d; doing so will not cause the student to see\nthe chalkboard more clearly\u2014though the reminder might increase the student\u2019s anxiety and self-consciousness.\nThere are a number of strategies for modifying assessments in ways that attempt to be fair and that at the same\ntime recognize how busy teachers usually are. One is to consider supplementing conventional assignments or tests\nwith portfolios, which are collections of a student\u2019s work that demonstrate a student\u2019s development over time, and\nwhich usually include some sort of reflective or evaluative comments from the student, the teacher, or both\n(Carothers & Taylor, 2003; Wesson & King, 1996). Another is to devise a system for observing the student regularly,\neven if briefly, and informally recording notes about the observations for later consideration and assessment. A\nthird strategy is to recruit help from teacher assistants, who are sometimes present to help a student with a\ndisability; an assistant can often conduct a brief test or activity with the student, and later report on and discuss the\nresults with you.\nIf you reflect on these strategies, you may realize that they may sometimes create issues about fairness. If a\nstudent with a disability demonstrates competence one way but other students demonstrate it another, should they\nbe given similar credit? On the other hand, is it fair for one student to get a lower mark because the student lacks an\nability\u2014such as normal hearing\u2014that teachers cannot, in principle, ever teach? These ethical issues are legitimate\nand important, and I therefore return to them in Chapters 11 and 12, which discuss assessment in much more\ndetail.\nLeast restrictive environment\nThe IDEA legislation calls for placing students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment (or\nLRE), defined as the combination of settings that involve the student with regular classrooms and school programs\nas much as possible. The precise combination is determined by the circumstances of a particular school and of the\nstudent. A kindergarten child with a mild cognitive disability, for example, may spend the majority of time in a\nregular kindergarten class, working alongside and playing with non-disabled classmates and relying on a teacher\nassistant for help where needed. An individual with a similar disability in high school, however, might be assigned\nprimarily to classes specially intended for slow learners, but nonetheless participate in some school-wide activities\nalongside non-disabled students. The difference in LREs might reflect teachers\u2019 perceptions of how difficult it is to\nmodify the curriculum in each case; rightly or wrongly, teachers are apt to regard adaptation as more challenging at\n\u201chigher\u201d grade levels. By the same token, a student with a disability that is strictly physical might spend virtually all\n88 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nhis or her time in regular classes throughout the student\u2019s school career; in this case, adjustment of the curriculum\nwould not be an issue.\nFor you, the policy favoring the least restrictive environment means that if you continue teaching long enough,\nyou will very likely encounter a student with a disability in one or more of your classes, or at least have one in a\nschool-related activity for which you are responsible. It also means that the special educational needs of these\nstudents will most often be the \u201cmildest\u201d. Statistically, the most frequent forms of special needs are learning\ndisabilities, which are impairments in specific aspects of learning, and especially of reading. Learning disabilities\naccount for about half of all special educational needs\u2014as much as all other types put together. Somewhat less\ncommon are speech and language disorders, cognitive disabilities, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorders\n(or ADHD). Because of their frequency and of the likelihood that you will meet students for whom these labels have\nbeen considered, I describe them more fully later in this chapter, along with other disability conditions that you will\nencounter much less frequently.\nIndividual educational plan\nThe third way that IDEA legislation and current educational approaches affect teachers is by requiring teachers\nand other professional staff to develop an annual individual educational plan (or IEP) for each student with a\ndisability. The plan is created by a team of individuals who know the student\u2019s strengths and needs; at a minimum\nit includes one or more classroom teachers, a \u201cresource\u201d or special education teacher, and the student\u2019s parents or\nguardians. Sometimes, too, the team includes a school administrator (like a vice-principal) or other professionals\nfrom outside the school (like a psychologist or physician), depending on the nature of the child\u2019s disability. An IEP\ncan take many forms, but it always describes a student\u2019s current social and academic strengths as well as the\nstudent\u2019s social or academic needs. It also specifies educational goals or objectives for the coming year, lists special\nservices to be provided, and describes how progress toward the goals will be assessed at the end of the year. Exhibit\n6 shows a simple, imaginary IEP. (But keep in mind that the actual visual formats of IEP plans vary widely among\nstates, provinces, and school jurisdictions.) This particular plan is for a student named Sean, a boy having\ndifficulties with reading. IEPs, like the one in the figure, originally served mainly students in the younger grades,\nbut more recently they have been extended and modified to serve transition planning for adolescents with\ndisabilities who are approaching the end of their public schooling (West, et al., 1999). For these students, the goals\nof the plan often include activities (like finding employment) to extend beyond schooling. See below.\nEducational Psychology 89 A Global Text 5.

(Note that actual visual formats of IEP plans vary.)\nIf you have a student with an IEP, you can expect two consequences for teaching. The first is that you should\nexpect to make definite, clear plans for the student, and to put the plans in writing. This consequence does not, of\n90 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ncourse, prevent you from taking advantage of unexpected or spontaneous classroom events as well in order to\nenrich the curriculum. But it does mean that an educational program for a student with a disability cannot consist\nonly of the unexpected or spontaneous. The second consequence is that you should not expect to construct an\neducational plan alone, as is commonly done when planning regular classroom programs. When it comes to\nstudents with disabilities, expect instead to plan as part of a team. Working with others ensures that everyone who\nis concerned about the student has a voice. It also makes it possible to improve the quality of IEPs by pooling ideas\nfrom many sources\u2014even if, as you might suspect, it also challenges professionals to communicate clearly and\ncooperate respectfully with team members in order to serve a student as well as possible.\nCategories of disabilities\u2014and their ambiguities\nSo far I have said a lot about why inclusion has come to be important for teachers, but not much about the actual\nnature of students\u2019 disabilities. Part of the reason for delaying was because, to put it simply, disabilities are\ninherently ambiguous. Naming and describing \u201ctypes\u201d of them implies that disabilities are relatively fixed, stable,\nand distinct, like different kinds of fruit or vegetables. As many teachers discover, though, the reality is somewhat\ndifferent. The behavior and qualities of a particular student with a disability can be hard to categorize. The student\nmay be challenged not only by the disability, but also by experiences common to all students, disabled or not. Any\nparticular disability, furthermore, poses problems more in some situations than in others. A student with a reading\ndifficulty may have trouble in a language arts class, for example, but not in a physical education class; a student\nwith a hearing impairment may have more trouble \u201chearing\u201d a topic that he dislikes compared to one that he likes.\nBecause official descriptions of types or categories of disabilities overlook these complexities, they risk stereotyping\nthe real, live people to whom they are applied (Green, et al., 2005). Even the simplifications might not be a serious\nproblem if the resulting stereotypes were complimentary\u2014most of us would not mind being called a \u201cgenius\u201d, for\nexample, even if the description is not always true. Stereotypes about disabilities, however, are usually stigmatizing,\nnot complimentary.\nStill, categories of disabilities do serve useful purposes by giving teachers, parents, and other professionals a\nlanguage or frame of reference for talking about disabilities. They also can help educators when arranging special\nsupport services for students, since a student has to \u201chave\u201d an identifiable, nameable need if professionals are to\nprovide help. Educational authorities have therefore continued to use categories (or \u201clabels\u201d) to classify disabilities\nin spite of expressing continuing concern about whether the practice hurts students\u2019 self-esteem or standing in the\neyes of peers (Biklen & Kliewer, 2006). For classroom teachers, the best strategy may be simply to understand how\ncategories of disabilities are defined, while also keeping their limitations in mind and being ready to explain their\nlimitations (tactfully, of course) to parents or others who use the labels inappropriately.\nThat said, what in fact are the major types of disabilities encountered by teachers? Let us take them one at a\ntime, beginning with the more common ones.\nLearning disabilities\nA learning disability (or LD) is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a specific\naspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student\u2019s academic performance significantly. An LD shows itself as a\nmajor discrepancy between a student\u2019s ability and some feature of achievement: the student may be delayed in\nreading, writing, listening, speaking, or doing mathematics, but not in all of these at once. A learning problem is not\nEducational Psychology 91 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nconsidered a learning disability if it stems from physical, sensory, or motor handicaps, or from generalized\nintellectual impairment (or mental retardation). It is also not an LD if the learning problem really reflects the\nchallenges of learning English as a second language. Genuine LDs are the learning problems left over after these\nother possibilities are accounted for or excluded. Typically, a student with an LD has not been helped by teachers\u2019\nordinary efforts to assist the student when he or she falls behind academically\u2014though what counts as an \u201cordinary\neffort\u201d, of course, differs among teachers, schools, and students. Most importantly, though, an LD relates to a fairly\nspecific area of academic learning. A student may be able to read and compute well enough, for example, but not be\nable to write.\nLDs are by far the most common form of special educational need, accounting for half of all students with\nspecial needs in the United States and anywhere from 5 to 20 per cent of all students, depending on how the\nnumbers are estimated (United States Department of Education, 2005; Ysseldyke & Bielinski, 2002). Students with\nLDs are so common, in fact, that most teachers regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school year,\nregardless of the grade level they teach.\nDefining learning disabilities clearly\nWith so many students defined as having learning disabilities, it is not surprising that the term itself becomes\nambiguous in the truest sense of \u201chaving many meanings\u201d. Specific features of LDs vary considerably. Any of the\nfollowing students, for example, qualify as having a learning disability, assuming that they have no other disease,\ncondition, or circumstance to account for their behavior:\n\u2022 Albert, an eighth-grader, has trouble solving word problems that he reads, but can solve them easily if he\nhears them orally.\n\u2022 Bill, also in eighth grade, has the reverse problem: he can solve word problems only when he can read them,\nnot when he hears them.\n\u2022 Carole, a fifth-grader, constantly makes errors when she reads textual material aloud, either leaving out\nwords, adding words, or substituting her own words for the printed text.\n\u2022 Emily, in seventh grade, has terrible handwriting; her letters vary in size and wobble all over the page,\nmuch like a first- or second-grader.\n\u2022 Denny reads very slowly, even though he is in fourth grade. His comprehension suffers as a result, because\nhe sometimes forgets what he read at the beginning of a sentence by the time he reaches the end.\n\u2022 Garnet\u2019s spelling would have to be called \u201cinventive\u201d, even though he has practiced conventionally correct\nspelling more than other students. Garnet is in sixth grade.\n\u2022 Harmin, a ninth-grader has particular trouble decoding individual words and letters if they are unfamiliar;\nhe reads conceal as \u201cconcol\u201d and alternate as \u201calfoonite\u201d.\n\u2022 Irma, a tenth-grader, adds multiple-digit numbers as if they were single-digit numbers stuck together: 42 +\n59 equals 911 rather than 101, though 23 + 54 correctly equals 77.\nWith so many expressions of LDs, it is not surprising that educators sometimes disagree about their nature and\nabout the kind of help students need as a consequence. Such controversy may be inevitable because LDs by\n92 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ndefinition are learning problems with no obvious origin. There is good news, however, from this state of affairs, in\nthat it opens the way to try a variety of solutions for helping students with learning disabilities.\nAssisting students with learning disabilities\nThere are various ways to assist students with learning disabilities, depending not only on the nature of the\ndisability, of course, but also on the concepts or theory of learning guiding you. Take Irma, the girl mentioned above\nwho adds two-digit numbers as if they were one digit numbers. Stated more formally, Irma adds two-digit numbers\nwithout carrying digits forward from the ones column to the tens column, or from the tens to the hundreds column.\nExhibit 7 shows the effect that her strategy has on one of her homework papers. What is going on here and how\ncould a teacher help Irma?\nDirections: Add the following numbers.\n42 23 11 47 97 41\n+ 59 + 54 + 48 + 23 + 64 + 27\n911 77 59 610 1511 68\nThree out of the six problems are done correctly, even though Irma seems to use an incorrect\nstrategy systematically on all six problems.\nExhibit 7: Irma\u2019s math homework about two-digit addition\nBehaviorism: reinforcement for wrong strategies\nOne possible approach comes from the behaviorist theory discussed in Chapter 2. Irma may persist with the\nsingle-digit strategy because it has been reinforced a lot in the past. Maybe she was rewarded so much for adding\nsingle-digit numbers (3+5, 7+8 etc.) correctly that she generalized this skill to two-digit problems\u2014in fact over\ngeneralized it. This explanation is plausible because she would still get many two-digit problems right, as you can\nconfirm by looking at it. In behaviorist terms, her incorrect strategy would still be reinforced, but now only on a\n\u201cpartial schedule of reinforcement\u201d. As I pointed out in Chapter 2, partial schedules are especially slow to\nextinguish, so Irma persists seemingly indefinitely with treating two-digit problems as if they were single-digit\nproblems.\nFrom the point of view of behaviorism, changing Irma\u2019s behavior is tricky since the desired behavior (borrowing\ncorrectly) rarely happens and therefore cannot be reinforced very often. It might therefore help for the teacher to\nreward behaviors that compete directly with Irma\u2019s inappropriate strategy. The teacher might reduce credit for\nsimply finding the correct answer, for example, and increase credit for a student showing her work\u2014including the\nwork of carrying digits forward correctly. Or the teacher might make a point of discussing Irma\u2019s math work with\nIrma frequently, so as to create more occasions when she can praise Irma for working problems correctly.\nMetacognition and responding reflectively\nPart of Irma\u2019s problem may be that she is thoughtless about doing her math: the minute she sees numbers on a\nworksheet, she stuffs them into the first arithmetic procedure that comes to mind. Her learning style, that is, seems\nEducational Psychology 93 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\ntoo impulsive and not reflective enough, as discussed in Chapter 4. Her style also suggests a failure of\nmetacognition (remember that idea from Chapter 2?), which is her self-monitoring of her own thinking and its\neffectiveness. As a solution, the teacher could encourage Irma to think out loud when she completes two-digit\nproblems\u2014literally get her to \u201ctalk her way through\u201d each problem. If participating in these conversations was\nsometimes impractical, the teacher might also arrange for a skilled classmate to take her place some of the time.\nCooperation between Irma and the classmate might help the classmate as well, or even improve overall social\nrelationships in the classroom.\nConstructivism, mentoring, and the zone of proximal development\nPerhaps Irma has in fact learned how to carry digits forward, but not learned the procedure well enough to use it\nreliably on her own; so she constantly falls back on the earlier, better-learned strategy of single-digit addition. In\nthat case her problem can be seen in the constructivist terms, like those that I discussed in Chapter 2. In essence,\nIrma has lacked appropriate mentoring from someone more expert than herself, someone who can create a \u201czone of\nproximal development\u201d in which she can display and consolidate her skills more successfully. She still needs\nmentoring or \u201cassisted coaching\u201d more than independent practice. The teacher can arrange some of this in much\nthe way she encourages to be more reflective, either by working with Irma herself or by arranging for a classmate or\neven a parent volunteer to do so. In this case, however, whoever serves as mentor should not only listen, but also\nactively offer Irma help. The help has to be just enough to insure that Irma completes two-digit problems correctly\n\u2014neither more nor less. Too much help may prevent Irma from taking responsibility for learning the new strategy,\nbut too little may cause her to take the responsibility prematurely.\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (or ADHD) is a problem with sustaining attention and controlling\nimpulses. As students, almost all of us have these problems at one time or another, but a student with ADHD shows\nthem much more frequently than usual, and often at home as well as at school. In the classroom, the student with\nADHD may fidget and squirm a lot, or have trouble remaining seated, or continually get distracted and off task, or\nhave trouble waiting for a turn, or blurt out answers and comments. The student may shift continually from one\nactivity to another, or have trouble playing quietly, or talk excessively without listening to others. Or the student\nmay misplace things and seem generally disorganized, or be inclined to try risky activities without enough thought\nto the consequences. Although the list of problem behaviors is obviously quite extensive, keep in mind that the\nstudent will not do all of these things. It is just that over time, the student with ADHD is likely to do several of them\nchronically or repeatedly, and in more than one setting (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In the classroom,\nof course, the behaviors may annoy classmates and frustrate teachers.\nDifferences in perceptions: ADHD versus high activity\nIt is important to note that classrooms are places that make heavy demands on not showing ADHD-like\nbehaviors: students are often supposed to sit for long periods, avoid interrupting others, finish tasks after beginning\nthem, and keep their minds (and materials) organized. Ironically, therefore, classroom life may sometimes\naggravate ADHD without the teacher intending for it to do so. A student with only a mild or occasional tendency to\nbe restless, for example, may fit in well outdoors playing soccer, but feel unusually restless indoors during class. It\nalso should not be surprising that teachers sometimes mistake a student who is merely rather active for a student\nwith ADHD, since any tendency to be physically active may contribute to problems with classroom management.\n94 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nThe tendency to \u201cover-diagnose\u201d is more likely for boys than for girls (Maniadaki, et al., 2003), presumably because\ngender role expectations cause teachers to be especially alert to high activity in boys. Over-diagnosis is also\nespecially likely for students who are culturally or linguistically non-Anglo (Chamberlain, 2005), presumably\nbecause cultural and language differences may sometimes lead teachers to misinterpret students\u2019 behavior. To\navoid making such mistakes, it is important to keep in mind that in true ADHD, restlessness, activity, and\ndistractibility are widespread and sustained. A student who shows such problems at school but never at home, for\nexample, may not have ADHD; he may simply not be getting along with his teacher or classmates.\nCauses of ADHD\nMost psychologists and medical specialists agree that true ADHD, as opposed to \u201cmere\u201d intermittent\ndistractibility or high activity, reflects a problem in how the nervous system functions, but they do not know the\nexact nature or causes of the problem (Rutter, 2004, 2005). Research shows that ADHD tends to run in families,\nwith children\u2014especially boys\u2014of parents who had ADHD somewhat more likely than usual to experience the\ncondition themselves. The association does not necessarily mean, though, that ADHD is inborn or genetic. Why? It\nis because it is possible that parents who formerly had ADHD may raise their children more strictly in an effort to\nprevent their own condition in their children; yet their strictness, ironically, may trigger a bit more tendency, rather\nthan less, toward the restless distractibility characteristic of ADHD. On the other hand (or is it \u201con the third\nhand\u201d?), the parents\u2019 strictness may also be a result, as well as a cause of, a child\u2019s restlessness. The bottom line for\nteachers: sorting out causes from effects is confusing, if not impossible, and in any case may not help much to\ndetermine actual teaching strategies to help the students learn more effectively.\nTeaching students with ADHD\nResearch also shows that ADHD can be reduced for many students if they take certain medications, of which the\nmost common is methylphenidate, commonly known by the name Ritalin (Wilens, 2005; Olfson, 2003). This drug\nand others like it act by stimulating the nervous system, which reduces symptoms by helping a student pay better\nattention to the choices he or she makes and to the impact of actions on others. Unfortunately the medications do\nnot work on all students with ADHD, especially after they reach adolescence, and in any case has certain practical\nproblems. Drugs cost money, for one thing, which is a problem for a family without much money to begin with, or\nfor a family lacking medical insurance that pays for medications\u2014a particularly common situation in the United\nStates. For another thing, drugs must be taken regularly in order to be effective, including on weekends. Keeping a\nregular schedule can be difficult if parents\u2019 own schedules are irregular or simply differ from the child\u2019s, for\nexample because of night shifts at work or because parents are separated and share custody of the child.\nIn any case, since teachers are not doctors and medications are not under teachers\u2019 control, it may be more\nimportant simply to provide an environment where a student with ADHD can organize choices and actions easily\nand successfully. Clear rules and procedures, for example, can reduce the \u201cnoise\u201d or chaotic quality in the child\u2019s\nclassroom life significantly. The rules and procedures can be generated jointly with the child; they do not have to be\nimposed arbitrarily, as if the student were incapable of thinking about them reasonably. Sometimes a classmate can\nbe enlisted to model slower, more reflective styles of working, but in ways that do not imply undue criticism of the\nstudent with ADHD. The more reflective student can complete a set of math problems, for example, while\nexplaining what he or she is thinking about while doing the work. Sometimes the teacher can help by making lists of\ntasks or of steps in long tasks. It can help to divide focused work into small, short sessions rather than grouping it\nEducational Psychology 95 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\ninto single, longer sessions. Whatever the strategies that you use, they should be consistent, predictable, and\ngenerated by the student as much as possible. By having these qualities, the strategies can strengthen the student\u2019s\nself-direction and ability to screen out the distractions of classroom life. The goal for teachers, in essence, is to build\nthe student\u2019s metacognitive capacity, while at the same time, of course, treating the student with respect.\nIntellectual disabilities\nAn intellectual disability is a significant limitation in a student\u2019s cognitive functioning and daily adaptive\nbehaviors (Schalock & Luckasson, 2004; American Association on Mental Retardation, 2002). The student may\nhave limited language or impaired speech and may not perform well academically. Compared to students with\nlearning disabilities discussed earlier, students with intellectual disabilities have impairments to learning that are\nbroader and more significant. They score poorly on standardized tests of intelligence (like the ones discussed later,\nin Chapter 12). Everyday tasks that most people take for granted, like getting dressed or eating a meal, may be\npossible, but they may also take more time and effort than usual. Health and safety can sometimes be a concern (for\nexample, knowing whether it is safe to cross a street). For older individuals, finding and keeping a job may require\nhelp from supportive others. The exact combination of challenges varies from one person to another, but it always\n(by definition) involves limitations in both intellectual and daily functioning.\nAs a teacher, you may hear more than one term for describing students with intellectual disabilities. If the\ndisability is mild, teachers sometimes refer to a student with the disability simply as a slow learner, particularly if\nthe student has no formal, special supports for the disability, such as a teaching assistant hired specifically to assist\nthe student. If the disability is more marked, then the student is more likely to be referred to either as having an\nintellectual disability or as having mental retardation. In this chapter I primarily use the term intellectual\ndisability, because it has fewer negative connotations while still describing one key educational aspect of the\ndisability, cognitive impairment. Keep in mind, however, that actual intellectual disabilities are always more than\ncognitive: they also involve challenges about adapting to everyday living.\nLevels of support for individuals with intellectual disabilities\nIntellectual disabilities happen in different degrees or amounts, though most often are relatively mild.\nTraditionally the intensity or \u201camount\u201d of the disability was defined by scores on a standardized test of scholastic\naptitude (or \u201cIQ test\u201d), with lower scores indicating more severe disability. (More about these tests in Chapter 12.)\nBecause of the insensitivity of such tests to individuals\u2019 daily social functioning, however, current trends are toward\ndefining intensities by the amount of support needed by the individual. Table 13 summarizes the most commonly\nused scheme for this purpose, one created by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental\nDisabilities (AAMR, 2002). Levels of support range from intermittent (just occasional or \u201cas needed\u201d for specific\nactivities) to pervasive (continuous in all realms of living).\nTable 13: Levels and areas of support for intellectual disabilities\nLevel of Duration of Frequency of Setting of Amount of\nsupport support support support professional\nassistance\nIntermittent Only as needed Occasional or Usually only one Occasional\n96 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ninfrequent or two (e.g. 1-2 consultation or\nclasses or activities) monitoring by\nprofessional\nLimited As needed, but Regular, but Several settings, Occasional or\nsometimes continuing frequency varies but not usually all regular contact with\nprofessionals\nExtensive Usually continuing Regular, but Several settings, Regular contact\nfrequency varies but not usually all with professionals at\nleast once a week\nPervasive May be lifelong Frequent or Nearly all settings Continuous\ncontinuous contact and\nmonitoring by\nprofessionals\nSource: American Association on Mental Retardation, 2002: Schalock & Luckassen, 2004.\nAs a classroom teacher, the intellectual disabilities that you are most likely to see are the ones requiring the least\nsupport in your classroom. A student requiring only intermittent support may require special help with some\nlearning activities or classroom routines, but not others; he or she might need help with reading or putting on\nwinter clothes, for example, but primarily on occasions when there is pressure to do these things relatively quickly.\nStudents requiring somewhat more support are likely to spend somewhat less time in your classroom and more\ntime receiving special help from other professionals, such as a special education teacher, a speech and language\nspecialist, or an assistant to these professionals. These circumstances have distinct implications for ways of\nteaching these students.\nTeaching students with intellectual disabilities\nThere are many specific techniques that can help in teaching students with mild or moderate intellectual\ndisabilities, but most can be summarized into three more general strategies. The first is to give more time and\npractice than usual; the second is to embed activities into the context of daily life or functioning where possible; and\nthe third is to include the child both in social and in academic activities, rather than just one or the other. Let us\nlook briefly at each of these ideas.\nGiving more time and practice than usual\nIf a student has only a mild intellectual disability, he or she can probably learn important fundamentals of the\nacademic curriculum\u2014basic arithmetic, for example, and basic reading. Because of the disability, though, the\nstudent may need more time or practice than most other students. He or she may be able to read many words by\nsight (day, night, morning, afternoon, etc.), but need longer than other students to recognize and say them. Or the\nstudent may know that 2 + 3 = 5, but need help applying this math fact to real objects; you (or a helper) might need\nto show the student that two pencils plus three pencils make five pencils.\nEducational Psychology 97 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nGiving extra help takes time and perseverance, and can try the patience of the student (and of you, too). To deal\nwith this problem, it may help to reward the student frequently for effort and successes with well-timed praise,\nespecially if it is focused on specific, actual achievements; \u201cYou added that one correctly\u201d, may be more helpful than\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hard worker\u201d, even if both comments are true. Giving appropriate praise is in turn easier if you set\nreasonable, \u201cdo-able\u201d goals by breaking skills or tasks into steps that the student is likely to learn without becoming\noverly discouraged. At the same time, it is important not to insult the student with goals or activities that are too\neasy or by using curriculum materials clearly intended for children who are much younger. Setting expectations too\nlow actually deprives a student with an intellectual disability of rightful opportunities to learn\u2014a serious ethical and\nprofessional mistake (Bogdan, 2006). In many curriculum areas, fortunately, there already existing materials that\nare simplified, yet also appropriate for older students (Snell, et al., 2005). Special education teacher-specialists can\noften help in finding them and in devising effective ways of using them.\nAdaptive and functional skills\nStudents with intellectual disabilities present especially clear examples of a universal dilemma of teaching: since\nthere is not enough time to teach everything, how do we choose what to teach? One basis for selecting activities is to\nrelate learning goals to students\u2019 everyday lives and activities, just as you would with all students. This strategy\naddresses the other defining feature of mental retardation, the student\u2019s difficulties with adapting to and\nfunctioning in everyday living. In teaching addition and subtraction, for example, you can create examples about\nthe purchasing of common familiar objects (e.g. food) and about the need to make or receive change for the\npurchases. Similar considerations apply to learning new reading or oral language vocabulary. Instead of simply\nlearning words in a \u201cbasic reading\u201d series (or reading textbook), try encouraging the student to learn words that are\nespecially useful to the student\u2019s own life. Often the student, not you yourself, is the best person to decide what\nthese words actually are.\nAn adaptive, functional approach can help in nonacademic areas as well. In learning to read or \u201ctell time\u201d on a\nclock, for example, try focusing initially on telling the times important to the student, such as when he or she gets\nup in the morning or when schools starts. As you add additional times that are personally meaningful to the\nstudent, he or she works gradually towards full knowledge of how to read the hands on a clock. Even if the full\nknowledge proves slow to develop, however, the student will at least have learned the most useful clock knowledge\nfirst.\nInclude the student deliberately in group activities\nThe key word here is inclusion: the student should participate in and contribute to the life of the class as much\nas possible. This means that wherever possible, the student attends special events (assemblies, field days) with the\nclass; that if the class plays a group game, then the student with the disability is part of the game; that if classmates\ndo an assignment as a group, then if at all possible the student is assigned to one of the groups. The changes\nresulting from these inclusions are real, but can be positive for everyone. On the one hand, they foster acceptance\nand helpfulness toward the child with the disability; classmates learn that school is partly about providing\nopportunities for everyone, and not just about evaluating or comparing individuals\u2019 skills. On the other hand, the\nchanges caused by inclusion stimulate the student with the disability to learn as much as possible from classmates,\nsocially and academically. Among other benefits, group activities can give the student chances to practice\n\u201cbelonging\u201d skills\u2014how to greet classmates appropriately, or when and how to ask the teacher a question. These are\n98 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nskills, I might add, that are beneficial for everyone to learn, disabled or not. (I discuss group work more thoroughly\nin Chapter 9, \u201cFacilitating complex thinking\u201d)\nBehavioral disorders\nBehavioral disorders are a diverse group of conditions in which a student chronically performs highly\ninappropriate behaviors. A student with this condition might seek attention, for example, by acting out disruptively\nin class. Other students with the condition might behave aggressively, be distractible and overly active, seem\nanxious or withdrawn, or seem disconnected from everyday reality. As with learning disabilities, the sheer range of\nsigns and symptoms defies concise description. But the problematic behaviors do have several general features in\ncommon (Kauffman, 2005; Hallahan & Kauffman, 2006):\n\u2022 they tend to be extreme\n\u2022 they persist for extended periods of time\n\u2022 they tend to be socially unacceptable (e.g. unwanted sexual advances or vandalism against school property)\n\u2022 they affect school work\n\u2022 they have no other obvious explanation (e.g. a health problem or temporary disruption in the family)\nThe variety among behavioral disorders means that estimates of their frequency also tend to vary among states,\ncities, and provinces. It also means that in some cases, a student with a behavioral disorder may be classified as\nhaving a different condition, such as ADHD or a learning disability. In other cases, a behavioral problem shown in\none school setting may seem serious enough to be labeled as a behavioral disorder, even though a similar problem\noccurring in another school may be perceived as serious, but not serious enough to deserve the label. In any case,\navailable statistics suggest that only about one to two per cent of students, or perhaps less, have true behavioral\ndisorders\u2014a figure that is only about one half or one third of the frequency for intellectual disabilities (Kauffman,\n2005). Because of the potentially disruptive effects of behavioral disorders, however, students with this condition\nare of special concern to teachers. Just one student who is highly aggressive or disruptive can interfere with the\nfunctioning of an entire class, and challenge even the best teacher\u2019s management skills and patience.\nStrategies for teaching students with behavioral disorders\nThe most common challenges of teaching students with behavioral disorders have to do with classroom\nmanagement\u2014a topic discussed more thoroughly in Chapter 7 (\u201cClassroom management\u201d). Three important ideas\ndiscussed there, however, also deserve special emphasis here: (1) identifying circumstances that trigger\ninappropriate behaviors, (2) teaching of interpersonal skills explicitly, and (3) disciplining a student fairly.\nIdentifying circumstances that trigger inappropriate behaviors\nDealing with a disruption is more effective if you can identify the specific circumstances or event that triggers it,\nrather than focusing on the personality of the student doing the disrupting. A wide variety of factors can trigger\ninappropriate behavior (Heineman, Dunlap, & Kincaid, 2005):\n\u2022 physiological effects\u2014including illness, fatigue, hunger, or side-effects from medications\n\u2022 physical features of the classroom\u2014such as the classroom being too warm or too cold, the chairs being\nexceptionally uncomfortable for sitting, or seating patterns that interfere with hearing or seeing\nEducational Psychology 99 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\n\u2022 instructional choices or strategies that frustrate learning\u2014including restricting students\u2019 choices unduly,\ngiving instructions that are unclear, choosing activities that are too difficult or too long, or preventing\nstudents from asking questions when they need help\nBy identifying the specific variables often associated with disruptive behaviors, it is easier to devise ways to\nprevent the behaviors, either by avoiding the triggers if this is possible, or by teaching the student alternative but\nquite specific ways of responding to the triggering circumstance.\nTeaching interpersonal skills explicitly\nBecause of their history and behavior, some students with behavior disorders have had little opportunity to learn\nappropriate social skills. Simple courtesies (like remembering to say please or thanks) may not be totally unknown,\nbut may be unpracticed and seem unimportant to the student, as might body language (like eye contact or sitting up\nto listen to a teacher rather than slouching and looking away). These skills can be taught in ways that do not make\nthem part of punishment, make them seem \u201cpreachy\u201d, or put a student to shame in front of classmates. Depending\non the age or grade-level of the class, one way is by reading or assigning books and stories in which the characters\nmodel good social skills. Another is through games that require courteous language to succeed; one that I recall\nfrom my own school days, for example, was called \u201cMother, May I?\u201d (Sullivan & Strang, 2002). Still another is\nthrough programs that link an older student or adult from the community as a partner to the student at risk for\nbehavior problems; a prominent example of such a program in the United States is Big Brothers Big Sisters of\nAmerica, which arranges for older individuals to act as mentors for younger boys and girls (Tierney, Grossman, &\nResch, 1995; Newburn & Shiner, 2006).\nIn addition, strategies based on behaviorist theory have proved effective for many students, especially if the\nstudent needs opportunities simply to practice social skills that he has learned only recently and may still feel\nawkward or self-conscious in using (Algozzine & Ysseldyke, 2006). Several behaviorist techniques were discussed in\nChapter 2, including the use of positive reinforcement, extinction, generalization, and the like. In addition to these,\nteachers can arrange for contingency contracts, which are agreements between the teacher and a student about\nexactly what work the student will do, how it will be rewarded, and what the consequences will be if the agreement\nis not fulfilled (Wilkinson, 2003). An advantage of all such behaviorist techniques is their precision and clarity:\nthere is little room for misunderstanding about just what your expectations are as the teacher. The precision and\nclarity in turn makes it less tempting or necessary for you, as teacher, to become angry about infractions of rules or\na student\u2019s failure to fulfill contracts or agreements, since the consequences tend already to be relatively obvious\nand clear. \u201cKeeping your cool\u201d can be especially helpful when dealing with behavior that is by nature annoying or\ndisrupting.\nFairness in disciplining\nMany strategies for helping a student with a behavior disorder may be spelled out in the student\u2019s individual\neducational plan, such as discussed earlier in this chapter. The plan can (and indeed is supposed to) serve as a\nguide in devising daily activities and approaches with the student. Keep in mind, however, that since an IEP is akin\nto a legal agreement among a teacher, other professionals, a student and the student\u2019s parents, departures from it\nshould be made only cautiously and carefully, if ever. Although such departures may seem unlikely, a student with a\nbehavior disorder may sometimes be exasperating enough to make it tempting to use stronger or more sweeping\n100 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\npunishments than usual (for example, isolating a student for extended times). In case you are tempted in this\ndirection, remember that every IEP also guarantees the student and the student\u2019s parents due process before an\nIEP can be changed. In practice this means consulting with everyone involved in the case\u2014especially parents, other\nspecialists, and the student himself\u2014and reaching an agreement before adopting new strategies that differ\nsignificantly from the past.\nInstead of \u201cincreasing the volume\u201d of punishments, a better approach is to keep careful records of the student\u2019s\nbehavior and of your own responses to it, documenting the reasonableness of your rules or responses to any major\ndisruptions. By having the records, collaboration with parents and other professionals can be more productive and\nfair-minded, and increase others\u2019 confidence in your judgments about what the student needs in order to fit in more\ncomfortably with the class. In the long term, more effective collaboration leads both to better support and to more\nlearning for the student (as well as to better support for you as teacher!).\nPhysical disabilities and sensory impairments\nA few students have serious physical, medical, or sensory challenges that interfere with their learning. Usually,\nthe physical and medical challenges are medical conditions or diseases that require ongoing medical care. The\nsensory challenges are usually a loss either in hearing or in vision, or more rarely in both. Whatever the specific\nproblem, it is serious enough to interfere with activities in regular classroom programs and to qualify the student\nfor special educational services or programs.\nPhysical challenges that are this serious are relatively infrequent compared to some of the other special needs\ndiscussed in this chapter, though they are of course important in the lives of the students and their families, as well\nas important for teachers to accommodate. Only about one per cent of US students have a hearing loss serious\nenough to be served by special programs for such students (United States Department of Education, 2005). Only\nabout half that number have visual impairments that lead them to be served by special programs. For two reasons,\nthough, these figures are a bit misleading. One reason is that many more students have vision or hearing problems\nthat are too mild (such as wearing eyeglasses for \u201cordinary\u201d nearsightedness). Another is that some students with\nserious sensory impairments may also have other disabilities and therefore not be counted in statistics about\nsensory impairments.\nHearing loss\nA child can acquire a hearing loss for a variety of reasons, ranging from disease early in childhood, to difficulties\nduring childbirth, to reactions to toxic drugs. In the classroom, however, the cause of the loss is virtually irrelevant\nbecause it makes little difference in how to accommodate a student\u2019s educational needs. More important than the\ncause of the loss is its extent. Students with only mild or moderate loss of hearing are sometimes called hearing\nimpaired or hard of hearing; only those with nearly complete loss are called deaf. As with other sorts of\ndisabilities, the milder the hearing loss, the more likely you are to encounter the student in a regular classroom, at\nleast for part of the day.\nSigns of hearing loss\nAlthough determining whether a student has a hearing loss may seem straightforward (\u201cJust give a hearing\ntest!\u201d), the assessment is often not clear cut if it takes the student\u2019s daily experiences into account. A serious or\nprofound hearing loss tends to be noticed relatively quickly and therefore often receive special help (or at least\nEducational Psychology 101 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nreceives additional diagnosis) sooner. Mild or moderate hearing loss is much more common, however, and is more\nlikely to be overlooked or mistaken for some other sort of learning problem (Sherer, 2004). Students with a mild\nhearing loss sometimes have somewhat depressed (or lowered) language and literacy skills\u2014though not always, and\nin any case so do some students without any loss. They may also seem not to listen or attend to a speaker because of\ntrouble in locating the source of sounds\u2014but then again, sometimes students without loss also fail to listen, though\nfor entirely different reasons. Students with hearing loss may frequently give incorrect answers to questions\u2014but so\ndo certain other students with normal hearing. In addition, partial hearing loss can be hidden if the student teaches\nhimself or herself to lip read, for example, or is careful in choosing which questions to answer in a class discussion.\nAnd so on. Systematic hearing tests given by medical or hearing specialists can resolve some of these ambiguities.\nBut even they can give a misleading impression, since students\u2019 true ability to manage in class depends on how well\nthey combine cues and information from the entire context of classroom life.\nIn identifying a student who may have a hearing loss, therefore, teachers need to observe the student over an\nextended period of time and in as many situations as possible. In particular, look for a persistent combination of\nsome of the following, but look for them over repeated or numerous occasions (Luckner & Carter, 2001):\n\u2022 delayed language or literacy skills, both written and oral\n\u2022 some ability (usually partial) to read lips\n\u2022 less worldly knowledge than usual because of lack of involvement with oral dialogue and/or delayed literacy\n\u2022 occasionally, tendency to social isolation because of awkwardness in communication\nTeaching students with hearing loss\nIn principle, adjustments in teaching students with hearing loss are relatively easy to make though they do\nrequire deliberate actions or choices by the teacher and by fellow students. Interestingly, many of the strategies\nmake good advice for teaching all students!\n\u2022 Take advantage of the student\u2019s residual hearing. Seat the student close to you if you are doing the talking,\nor close to key classmates if the students are in a work group. Keep competing noise, such as unnecessary\ntalking or whispering, to a minimum (because such noise is especially distracting to someone with a\nhearing loss). Keep instructions concise and to-the-point. Ask the student occasionally whether he or she is\nunderstanding.\n\u2022 Use visual cues liberally. Make charts and diagrams wherever appropriate to illustrate what you are saying.\nLook directly at the student when you are speaking to him or her (to facilitate lip reading). Gesture and\npoint to key words or objects\u2014but within reason, not excessively. Provide handouts or readings to review\nvisually the points that you make orally.\n\u2022 Include the student in the community of the classroom. Recruit one or more classmates to assist in\n\u201ctranslating\u201d oral comments that the student may have missed. If the student uses American Sign Language\n(ASL) at home or elsewhere, then learn a few basic, important signs of ASL yourself (\u201cHello\u201d \u201cthank you\u201d\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d). Teach them to classmates as well.\n102 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nVisual impairment\nStudents with visual impairments have difficulty seeing even with corrective lenses. Most commonly the\ndifficulty has to do with refraction (the ability to focus), but some students may also experience a limited field of\nview (called tunnel vision) or be overly sensitive to light in general. As with hearing loss, labels for visual\nimpairment depend somewhat on the extent and nature of the problem. Legal blindness means that the person has\nsignificant tunnel vision or else visual acuity (sharpness of vision) of 20/200 or less, which means that he or she\nmust be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal eyesight can see at 200 feet. Low vision means that\na person has some vision usable for reading, but often needs a special optical device such as a magnifying lens for\ndoing so. As with hearing loss, the milder the impairment, the more likely that a student with a vision problem will\nspend some or even all the time in a regular class.\nSigns of visual impairment\nStudents with visual impairments often show some of the same signs as students with simple, common\nnearsightedness. The students may rub their eyes a lot, for example, blink more than usual, or hold books very close\nto read them. They may complain of itchiness in their eyes, or of headaches, dizziness, or even nausea after doing a\nlot of close eye work. The difference between the students with visual impairment and those with \u201cordinary\u201d\nnearsightedness is primarily a matter of degree: the ones with impairment show the signs more often and more\nobviously. If the impairment is serious enough or has roots in certain physical conditions or disease, they may also\nhave additional symptoms, such as crossed eyes or swollen eyelids. As with hearing loss, the milder forms ironically\ncan be the most subtle to observe and therefore the most prone to being overlooked at first. For classroom teachers,\nthe best strategy may be to keep track of a student whose physical signs happen in combination with learning\ndifficulties, and for whom the combination persists for many weeks.\nTeaching students with visual impairment\nIn general, advice for teaching students with mild or moderate visual impairment parallels the advice for\nteaching students with hearing loss, though with obvious differences because of the nature of the students\u2019\ndisabilities.\n\u2022 Take advantage of the student\u2019s residual vision. If the student still has some useful vision, place him or her\nwhere he can easily see the most important parts of the classroom\u2014whether that is you, the chalkboard, a\nvideo screen, or particular fellow students. Make sure that the classroom, or at least the student\u2019s part of it,\nis well lit (because good lighting makes reading easier with low vision). Make sure that handouts, books and\nother reading materials have good, sharp contrast (also helpful with a visual impairment).\n\u2022 Use non-visual information liberally. Remember not to expect a student with visual impairment to learn\ninformation that is by nature only visual, such as the layout of the classroom, the appearance of\nphotographs in a textbook or of story lines in a video. Explain these to the student somehow. Use hands-on\nmaterials wherever they will work, such as maps printed in three-dimensional relief or with different\ntextures. If the student knows how to read Braille (an alphabet for the blind using patterns of small bumps\non a page), allow him to do so.\n\u2022 Include the student in the community of the classroom. Make sure that the student is accepted as well as\npossible into the social life of the class. Recruit classmates to help explain visual material when necessary.\nEducational Psychology 103 A Global Text 5. Students with special educational needs\nLearn a bit of basic Braille and encourage classmates to do the same, even if none of you ever become as\nskilled with it as the student himself or herself.\nThe value of including students with special needs\nI have hinted at it already in this chapter, but it is worth saying again: including students with disabilities in\nregular classrooms is valuable for everyone concerned. The students with disabilities themselves tend to experience\na richer educational environment, both socially and academically. Just as with racial segregation, separate\neducation is not equal education, or at least cannot be counted on to be equal. But classmates of students with\ndisabilities also experience a richer educational environment; they potentially meet a wider range of classmates and\nto see a wider range of educational purposes in operation. Teachers also experience these benefits, but their\nprograms often benefit in other ways as well. The most notable additional benefit is that many teaching strategies\nthat are good for students with disabilities also turn out to benefit all students\u2014benefits like careful planning of\nobjectives, attention to individual differences among students, and establishment of a positive social atmosphere in\nthe classroom. Later (in Chapters 9 and 10) we will return to these topics because of their importance for high-\nquality teaching. But at that point we will frame the topics around the needs of all students, whatever their\nindividual qualities.\nChapter summary\nSince the 1970s support for people with disabilities has grown significantly, as reflected in the United States by\nthree key pieces of legislation: the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The support has led to new educational practices, including\nalternative assessments for students with disabilities, placement in the least restrictive environment, and individual\neducational plans.\nThere are many ways of classifying people with disabilities, all of which carry risks of stereotyping and\noversimplifying individuals\u2019 strengths and needs. For the purposes of education, the most frequent category is\nlearning disabilities, which are difficulties with specific aspects of academic work. The high prevalence of learning\ndisabilities makes this category especially ambiguous as a description of particular students. Assistance for students\nwith learning disabilities can be framed in terms of behaviorist reinforcement, metacognitive strategies, or\nconstructivist mentoring.\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem in sustaining attention and controlling impulses.\nIt can often be controlled with medications, but usually it is also important for teachers to provide a structured\nenvironment for the student as well.\nIntellectual disabilities (or mental retardation) are general limitations in cognitive functioning as well as in the\ntasks of daily living. Contemporary experts tend to classify individuals with these disabilities according to the\namount and frequency of support they need from others. Teachers can assist these students by giving more time\nand practice than usual, by including adaptive and functional skills in what they teach, and by making sure that the\nstudent is included in the daily life of the classroom.\nBehavioral disorders are conditions in which students chronically perform highly inappropriate behaviors.\nStudents with these problems present challenges for classroom management, which teachers can meet by\n104 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nidentifying circumstances that trigger inappropriate behaviors, by teaching interpersonal skills explicitly, and by\nmaking sure that punishments or disciplinary actions are fair and have been previously agreed upon.\nPhysical and sensory disabilities are significant limitations in health, hearing, or vision. The signs both of\nhearing loss and of vision loss can be subtle, but can sometimes be observed over a period of time. Teaching\nstudents with either a hearing loss or a vision loss primarily involves making use of the students\u2019 residual sensory\nabilities and insuring that the student is included in and supported by the class as well as possible.\nKey terms\nAlternative assessment Least restrictive environment (LRE)\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 Learning disabilities\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Mental retardation\nBehavioral disorders Portfolio assessment\nContingency contracts Rehabilitation Act of 1973\nHearing loss Sensory impairment\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act Transition planning\nIndividual educational plan (IEP) Visual impairment\nIntellectual disabilities\nOn the Internet\nEach of the following websites represents an organization focused on the needs of people with one particular\ntype of disability.

Student motivation\nNot so long ago, a teacher named Barbara Fuller taught general science to elementary years\nstudents, and one of her units was about insects and spiders. As part of the unit she had students\nsearch for insects and spiders around their own homes or apartments. They brought the creatures to\nschool (safely in jars), answered a number of questions about them in their journals, and eventually\ngave brief oral reports about their findings to the class. The assignment seemed straightforward, but\nBarbara found that students responded to it in very different ways. Looking back, here is how\nBarbara described their responses:\n\u201cI remember Jose couldn\u2019t wait to get started, and couldn\u2019t bear to end the assignment either! Every\nday he brought more bugs or spiders\u2014eventually 25 different kinds. Every day he drew pictures of\nthem in his journal and wrote copious notes about them. At the end he gave the best oral\npresentation I\u2019ve ever seen from a third-grader; he called it \u2018They Have Us Outnumbered!\u2019 I wish I\nhad filmed it, he was so poised and so enthusiastic.\n\u201cThen there was Lindsey\u2014the one who was always wanted to be the best in everything, regardless of\nwhether it interested her. She started off the work rather slowly\u2014just brought in a few bugs and only\none spider. But she kept an eye on what everyone else was bringing, and how much. When she saw\nhow much Jose was doing, though, she picked up her pace, like she was trying to match his level.\nExcept that instead of bringing a diversity of creatures as Jose was doing, she just brought more and\nmore of the same ones\u2014almost twenty dead house flies, as I recall! Her presentation was OK\u2014I\nreally could not give her a bad mark for it\u2014but it wasn\u2019t as creative or insightful as Jose\u2019s. I think she\nwas more concerned about her mark than about the material.\n\u201cAnd there was Tobias\u2014discouraging old Tobias. He did the work, but just barely. I noticed him\nlooking a lot at other students\u2019 insect collections and at their journal entries. He wasn\u2019t cheating, I\nbelieve, just figuring out what the basic level of work was for the assignment\u2014what he needed to do\nsimply to avoid failing it. He brought in fewer bugs than most others, though still a number that was\nacceptable. He also wrote shorter answers in his journal and gave one of the shortest oral reports. It\nwas all acceptable, but not much more than that.\n\u201cAnd Zoey: she was quite a case! I never knew whether to laugh or cry about her. She didn\u2019t exactly\nresist doing the assignment, but she certainly liked to chat with other students. So she was easily\ndistracted, and that cut down on getting her work done, especially about her journal entries. What\nreally saved her\u2014what kept her work at a reasonably high level of quality\u2014were the two girls she\nended up chatting with. The other two were already pretty motivated to do a lot with the assignment\n\u2014create fine looking bug collections, write good journal entries, and make interesting oral\npresentations. So when Zoey attempted chitchat with them, the conversations often ended up\nEducational Psychology 109 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nfocusing on the assignment anyway! She had them to thank for keeping her mind on the work. I don\u2019t\nknow what Zoey would have done without them.\u201d\nAs Barbara Fuller\u2019s recollections suggest, students assign various meanings and attitudes to academic activities\n\u2014personal meanings and attitudes that arouse and direct their energies in different ways. We call these and their\nassociated energizing and directing effects by the term motivation, or sometimes motivation to learn. As you\nwill see, differences in motivation are an important source of diversity in classrooms, comparable in importance to\ndifferences in prior knowledge, ability, or developmental readiness. When it comes to school learning, furthermore,\nstudents\u2019 motivations take on special importance because students\u2019 mere presence in class is (of course) no\nguarantee that students really want to learn. It is only a sign that students live in a society requiring young people to\nattend school. Since modern education is compulsory, teachers cannot take students\u2019 motivation for granted, and\nthey have a responsibility to insure students\u2019 motivation to learn. Somehow or other, teachers must persuade\nstudents to want to do what students have to do anyway. This task\u2014understanding and therefore influencing\nstudents\u2019 motivations to learn\u2014is the focus of this chapter. Fortunately, as you will see, there are ways of\naccomplishing this task that respect students\u2019 choices, desires, and attitudes.\nLike motivation itself, theories of it are full of diversity. For convenience in navigating through the diversity, we\nhave organized the chapter around six major theories or perspectives about motives and their sources. We call the\ntopics (1) motives as behavior change, (2) motives as goals, (3) motives as interests, (4) motives as attributions\nabout success, (5) motives as beliefs about self-efficacy, and (6) motives as self-determination. We end with a\nperspective called expectancy-value theory which integrates ideas from some of the other six theories, and partly as\na result implies some additional suggestions for influencing students\u2019 motivations to learn in positive ways.\nMotives as behavior\nSometimes it is useful to think of motivation not as something \u201cinside\u201d a student driving the student\u2019s behavior,\nbut as equivalent to the student\u2019s outward behaviors. This is the perspective of behaviorism, which we discussed in\nChapter 1 (\u201cStudent learning\u201d) as a way to think about the learning process. In its most thorough-going form,\nbehaviorism focuses almost completely on what can be directly seen or heard about a person\u2019s behavior, and has\nrelatively few comments about what may lie behind (or \u201cunderneath\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d) the behavior. When it comes to\nmotivation, this perspective means minimizing or even ignoring the distinction between the inner drive or energy of\nstudents, and the outward behaviors that express the drive or energy. The two are considered the same, or nearly\nso.\nEquating the inner and the outward might seem to violate common sense. How can a student do something\nwithout some sort of feeling or thought to make the action happen? As we will explain, this very question has led to\nalternative models of motivation that are based on cognitive rather than behaviorist theories of learning. We will\nexplain some of these later in this chapter. Before getting to them, however, we encourage you to consider the\nadvantages of a behaviorist perspective on motivation.\nSometimes the circumstances of teaching limit teachers\u2019 opportunities to distinguish between inner motivation\nand outward behavior. Certainly teachers see plenty of student behaviors\u2014signs of motivation of some sort. But the\nmultiple demands of teaching can limit the time needed to determine what the behaviors mean. If a student asks a\nlot of questions during discussions, for example, is he or she curious about the material itself, or just wanting to\n110 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nlook intelligent in front of classmates and the teacher? In a class with many students and a busy agenda, there may\nnot be a lot of time for a teacher to decide between these possibilities. In other cases, the problem may not be\nlimited time as much as communication difficulties with a student. Consider a student who is still learning English,\nor who belongs to a cultural community that uses patterns of conversation that are unfamiliar to the teacher, or\nwho has a disability that limits the student\u2019s general language skill. In these cases discerning the student\u2019s inner\nmotivations may take more time and effort. It is important to invest the extra time and effort for such students, but\nwhile a teacher is doing so, it is also important for her to guide and influence the students\u2019 behavior in constructive\ndirections. That is where behaviorist approaches to motivation can help.\nOperant conditioning as a way of motivating\nThe most common version of the behavioral perspective on motivation is the theory of operant conditioning\nassociated with B. F. Skinner (1938, 1957), which we discussed in Chapter 1 (\u201cLearning process\u201d). The description in\nthat chapter focused on behavioral learning, but the same operant model can be transformed into an account of\nmotivation. In the operant model, you may recall, a behavior being learned (the \u201coperant\u201d) increases in frequency\nor likelihood because performing it makes a reinforcement available. To understand this model in terms of\nmotivation, think of the likelihood of response as the motivation and the reinforcement as the motivator. Imagine,\nfor example, that a student learns by operant conditioning to answer questions during class discussions: each time\nthe student answers a question (the operant), the teacher praises (reinforces) this behavior. In addition to thinking\nof this situation as behavioral learning, however, you can also think of it in terms of motivation: the likelihood of\nthe student answering questions (the motivation) is increasing because of the teacher\u2019s praise (the motivator).\nMany concepts from operant conditioning, in fact, can be understood in motivational terms. Another one, for\nexample, is the concept of extinction, which we defined in Chapter 1 as the tendency for learned behaviors to\nbecome less likely when reinforcement no longer occurs\u2014a sort of \u201cunlearning\u201d, or at least a decrease in\nperformance of previously learned. The decrease in performance frequency can be thought of as a loss of\nmotivation, and removal of the reinforcement can be thought of as removal of the motivator. Table 14 summarizes\nthis way of reframing operant conditioning in terms of motivation, both for the concepts discussed in Chapter 1 and\nfor other additional concepts.\nTable 14: Operant conditioning as learning and as motivation\nConcept Definition phrased Definition phrased Classroom example\nin terms of learning in terms of motivation\nOperant Behavior that becomes Behavior that suggests Student listens to\nmore likely because of an increase in motivation teacher\u2019s comments during\nreinforcement lecture or discussion\nReinforcement Stimulus that increases Stimulus that motivates Teacher praises student\nlikelihood of a behavior for listening\nPositive reinforcement Stimulus that increases Stimulus that motivates Teacher makes\nlikelihood of a behavior by by its presence; an encouraging remarks\nbeing introduced or added \u201cincentive\u201d about student\u2019s homework\nEducational Psychology 111 A Global Text 6.

But there are\nnonetheless cautions about adopting this view. An obvious one is the ambiguity of students\u2019 specific behaviors;\nwhat looks like a sign of one motive to the teacher may in fact be a sign of some other motive to the student\n(DeGrandpre, 2000). If a student looks at the teacher intently while she is speaking, does it mean the student is\nmotivated to learn, or only that the student is daydreaming? If a student invariably looks away while the teacher is\n112 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nspeaking, does it mean that the student is disrespectful of the teacher, or that student comes from a family or\ncultural group where avoiding eye contact actually shows more respect for a speaker than direct eye contact?\nAnother concern about behaviorist perspectives, including operant conditioning, is that it leads teachers to\nignore students\u2019 choices and preferences, and to \u201cplay God\u201d by making choices on their behalf (Kohn, 1996).\nAccording to this criticism, the distinction between \u201cinner\u201d motives and expressions of motives in outward behavior\ndoes not disappear just because a teacher (or a psychological theory) chooses to treat a motive and the behavioral\nexpression of a motive as equivalent. Students usually do know what they want or desire, and their wants or desires\nmay not always correspond to what a teacher chooses to reinforce or ignore. This, in a new guise, is once again the\nissue of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation that we discussed in Chapter 1. Approaches that are exclusively\nbehavioral, it is argued, are not sensitive enough to students\u2019 intrinsic, self-sustaining motivations.\nAs we pointed out in Chapter 1, there is truth to this allegation if a teacher actually does rely on rewarding\nbehaviors that she alone has chosen, or even if she persists in reinforcing behaviors that students already find\nmotivating without external reinforcement. In those cases reinforcements can backfire: instead of serving as an\nincentive to desired behavior, reinforcement can become a reminder of the teacher\u2019s power and of students\u2019 lack of\ncontrol over their own actions. A classic research study of intrinsic motivation illustrated the problem nicely. In the\nstudy, researchers rewarded university students for two activities\u2014solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines\n\u2014that they already found interesting. Some of the students, however, were paid to do these activities, whereas\nothers were not. Under these conditions, the students who were paid were less likely to engage in the activities\nfollowing the experiment than were the students who were not paid, even though both groups had been equally\ninterested in the activities to begin with (Deci, 1971). The extrinsic reward of payment, it seemed, interfered with\nthe intrinsic reward of working the puzzles.\nLater studies confirmed this effect in numerous situations, though they have also found certain conditions where\nextrinsic rewards do not reduce intrinsic rewards. Extrinsic rewards are not as harmful, for example, if a person is\npaid \u201cby the hour\u201d (i.e. by a flat rate) rather than piecemeal (by the number of items completed) (Cameron & Pierce,\n1994; Eisenberger & Cameron, 1996). They also are less harmful if the task itself is relatively well-defined (like\nworking math problems or playing solitaire) and high-quality performance is expected at all times. So there are still\ntimes and ways when externally determined reinforcements are useful and effective. In general, however, extrinsic\nrewards do seem to undermine intrinsic motivation often enough that they need to be used selectively and\nthoughtfully (Deci, Koestner, & Ryan, 2001). As it happens, help with being selective and thoughtful can be found in\nthe other, more cognitively oriented theories of motivation. These use the goals, interests, and beliefs of students as\nways of explaining differences in students\u2019 motives and in how the motives affect engagement with school. We turn\nto these cognitively oriented theories next, beginning with those focused on students\u2019 goals.\nMotives as goals\nOne way motives vary is by the kind of goals that students set for themselves, and by how the goals support\nstudents\u2019 academic achievement. As you might suspect, some goals encourage academic achievement more than\nothers, but even motives that do not concern academics explicitly tend to affect learning indirectly.\nEducational Psychology 113 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nGoals that contribute to achievement\nWhat kinds of achievement goals do students hold? Imagine three individuals, Maria, Sara, and Lindsay, who\nare taking algebra together. Maria\u2019s main concern is to learn the material as well as possible because she finds it\ninteresting and because she believes it will be useful to her in later courses, perhaps at university. Hers is a mastery\ngoal because she wants primarily to learn or master the material. Sara, however, is concerned less about algebra\nthan about getting top marks on the exams and in the course. Hers is a performance goal because she is focused\nprimarily on looking successful; learning algebra is merely a vehicle for performing well in the eyes of peers and\nteachers. Lindsay, for her part, is primarily concerned about avoiding a poor or failing mark. Hers is a performance-\navoidance goal or failure-avoidance goal because she is not really as concerned about learning algebra, as Maria is,\nor about competitive success, as Sara is; she is simply intending to avoid failure.\nAs you might imagine, mastery, performance, and performance-avoidance goals often are not experienced in\npure form, but in combinations. If you play the clarinet in the school band, you might want to improve your\ntechnique simply because you enjoy playing as well as possible\u2014essentially a mastery orientation. But you might\nalso want to look talented in the eyes of classmates\u2014a performance orientation. Another part of what you may wish,\nat least privately, is to avoid looking like a complete failure at playing the clarinet. One of these motives may\npredominate over the others, but they all may be present.\nMastery goals tend to be associated with enjoyment of learning the material at hand, and in this sense represent\nan outcome that teachers often seek for students. By definition therefore they are a form of intrinsic motivation. As\nsuch mastery goals have been found to be better than performance goals at sustaining students\u2019 interest in a\nsubject. In one review of research about learning goals, for example, students with primarily mastery orientations\ntoward a course they were taking not only tended to express greater interest in the course, but also continued to\nexpress interest well beyond the official end of the course, and to enroll in further courses in the same subject\n(Harackiewicz, et al., 2002; Wolters, 2004).\nPerformance goals, on the other hand, imply extrinsic motivation, and tend to show the mixed effects of this\norientation. A positive effect is that students with a performance orientation do tend to get higher grades than those\nwho express primarily a mastery orientation. The advantage in grades occurs both in the short term (with\nindividual assignments) and in the long term (with overall grade point average when graduating). But there is\nevidence that performance oriented students do not actually learn material as deeply or permanently as students\nwho are more mastery oriented (Midgley, Kaplan, & Middleton, 2001). A possible reason is that measures of\nperformance\u2014such as test scores\u2014often reward relatively shallow memorization of information and therefore guide\nperformance-oriented students away from processing the information thoughtfully or deeply. Another possible\nreason is that a performance orientation, by focusing on gaining recognition as the best among peers, encourages\ncompetition among peers. Giving and receiving help from classmates is thus not in the self-interest of a\nperformance-oriented student, and the resulting isolation limits the student\u2019s learning.\nGoals that affect achievement indirectly\nFailure-avoidant goals\nAs we mentioned, failure-avoidant goals by nature undermine academic achievement. Often they are a negative\nbyproduct of the competitiveness of performance goals (Urdan, 2004). If a teacher (and sometimes also fellow\n114 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nstudents) put too much emphasis on being the best in the class, and if interest in learning the material as such\ntherefore suffers, then some students may decide that success is beyond their reach or may not be desirable in any\ncase. The alternative\u2014simply avoiding failure\u2014may seem wiser as well as more feasible. Once a student adopts this\nattitude, he or she may underachieve more or less deliberately, doing only the minimum work necessary to avoid\nlooking foolish or to avoid serious conflict with the teacher. Avoiding failure in this way is an example of self-\nhandicapping\u2014deliberate actions and choices that the reduce chances of success. Students may self-handicap in a\nnumber of ways; in addition to not working hard, they may procrastinate about completing assignments, for\nexample, or set goals that are unrealistically high.\nSocial goals\nMost students need and value relationships, both with classmates and with teachers, and often (though not\nalways) they get a good deal of positive support from the relationships. But the effects of social relationships are\ncomplex, and at times can work both for and against academic achievement. If a relationship with the teacher is\nimportant and reasonably positive, then the student is likely to try pleasing the teacher by working hard on\nassignments (Dowson & McInerney, 2003). Note, though, that this effect is closer to performance than mastery; the\nstudent is primarily concerned about looking good to someone else. If, on the other hand, a student is especially\nconcerned about relationships with peers, the effects on achievement depend on the student\u2019s motives for the\nrelationship, as well as on peers\u2019 attitudes. Desiring to be close to peers personally may lead a student to ask for\nhelp from, and give help to peers\u2014a behavior that may support higher achievement, at least up to a point. But\ndesiring to impress peers with skills and knowledge may lead to the opposite: as we already mentioned, the\ncompetitive edge of such a performance orientation may keep the student from collaborating, and in this indirect\nway reduce a student\u2019s opportunities to learn. The abilities and achievement motivation of peers themselves can\nalso make a difference, but once again the effects vary depending on the context. Low achievement and motivation\nby peers affects an individual\u2019s academic motivation more in elementary school than in high school, more in\nlearning mathematics than learning to read, and more if their is a wide range of abilities in a classroom than if\nthere is a more narrow range (Burke & Sass, 2006).\nIn spite of these complexities, social relationships are valued so highly by most students that teachers should\ngenerally facilitate them, though also keep an eye on their nature and their consequent effects on achievement. As\nwe explain further, many assignments can be accomplished productively in groups, for example, as long as the\ngroups are formed thoughtfully; in that chapter we discuss some ways of insuring that such groups are successful,\nsuch as by choosing group tasks wisely and recognizing all members\u2019 contributions are fully as possible.\nRelationships can also be supported with activities that involve students or adults from another class or from\noutside the school, as often happens with school or community service projects. These can provide considerable\nsocial satisfaction and can sometimes be connected to current curriculum needs (Butin, 2005). But the majority of\nstudents\u2019 social contacts are likely always to come from students\u2019 own initiatives with each other in simply taking\ntime to talk and interact. The teacher\u2019s job is to encourage these informal contacts, especially when they happen at\ntimes that support rather than interfere with learning.\nEncouraging mastery goals\nEven though a degree of performance orientation may be inevitable in school because of the mere presence of\nclassmates, it does not have to take over students\u2019 academic motivation completely. Teachers can encourage\nEducational Psychology 115 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nmastery goals in various ways, and should in fact do so because a mastery orientation leads to more sustained,\nthoughtful learning, at least in classrooms, where classmates may sometimes debate and disagree with each other\n(Darnon, Butera, & Harackiewicz, 2006).\nHow can teachers do so? One way is to allow students to choose specific tasks or assignments for themselves,\nwhere possible, because their choices are more likely than usual to reflect prior personal interests, and hence be\nmotivated more intrinsically than usual. The limitation of this strategy, of course, is that students may not see some\nof the connections between their prior interests and the curriculum topics at hand. In that case it also helps for the\nteacher to look for and point out the relevance of current topics or skills to students\u2019 personal interests and goals.\nSuppose, for example, that a student enjoys the latest styles of music. This interest may actually have connections\nwith a wide range of school curriculum, such as:\n\u2022 biology (because of the physiology of the ear and of hearing)\n\u2022 physics or general science (because of the nature of musical acoustics)\n\u2022 history (because of changes in musical styles over time)\n\u2022 English (because of relationships of musical lyrics and themes with literary themes)\n\u2022 foreign languages (because of comparisons of music and songs among cultures)\nStill another way to encourage mastery orientation is to focus on students\u2019 individual effort and improvement as\nmuch as possible, rather than on comparing students\u2019 successes to each other. You can encourage this orientation\nby giving students detailed feedback about how they can improve performance, or by arranging for students to\ncollaborate on specific tasks and projects rather than to compete about them, and in general by showing your own\nenthusiasm for the subject at hand.\nMotives as interests\nIn addition to holding different kinds of goals\u2014with consequent differences in academic motivation\u2014students\nshow obvious differences in levels of interest in the topics and tasks of the classroom. Suppose that two high school\nclassmates, Frank and Jason, both are taking chemistry, and specifically learning how to balance chemical\nequations. Frank finds the material boring and has to force himself to study it; as a result he spends only the time\nneeded to learn the basic material and to complete the assignments at a basic level. Jason, on the other hand,\nenjoys the challenges of balancing chemical equations. He thinks of the task as an intriguing puzzle; he not only\nsolves each of them, but also compares the problems to each other as he goes through them.\nFrank\u2019s learning is based on effort compared to Jason\u2019s, whose learning is based more fully on interest. As the\nexample implies, when students learn from interest they tend to devote more attention to the topic than if they\nlearn from effort (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). The finding is not surprising since interest is another aspect of\nintrinsic motivation\u2014energy or drive that comes from within. A distinction between effort and interest is often\nartificial, however, because the two motives often get blended or combined in students\u2019 personal experiences. Most\nof us can remember times when we worked at a skill that we enjoyed and found interesting, but that also required\neffort to learn. The challenge for teachers is therefore to draw on and encourage students\u2019 interest as much as\npossible, and thus keep the required effort within reasonable bounds\u2014neither too hard nor too easy.\n116 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nSituational interest versus personal interest\nStudents\u2019 interests vary in how deeply or permanently they are located within students. Situational interests\nare ones that are triggered temporarily by features of the immediate situation. Unusual sights, sounds, or words can\nstimulate situational interest. A teacher might show an interesting image on the overhead projector, or play a brief\nbit of music, or make a surprising comment in passing. At a more abstract level, unusual or surprising topics of\ndiscussion can also arouse interest when they are first introduced. Personal interests are relatively permanent\npreferences of the student, and are usually expressed in a variety of situations. In the classroom, a student may (or\nmay not) have a personal interest in particular topics, activities, or subject matter. Outside class, though, he or she\nusually has additional personal interests in particular non-academic activities (e.g. sports, music) or even in\nparticular people (a celebrity, a friend who lives nearby). The non-academic personal interests may sometimes\nconflict with academic interest; it may be more interesting to go to the shopping mall with a friend than to study\neven your most favorite subject.\nBenefits of personal interest\nIn general, personal interest in an academic topic or activity tends to correlate with achievement related to the\ntopic or activity. As you might suppose, a student who is truly interested is more likely to focus on the topic or\nactivity more fully, to work at it for longer periods, to use more thoughtful strategies in learning\u2014and to enjoy\ndoing so (Hidi, 2001; Hidi & Renninger, 2006). Small wonder that the student achieves more! Note, though, a\npersistent ambiguity about this benefit: it is often not clear whether personal interest leads to higher achievement,\nor higher achievement leads to stronger interest. Either possibility seems plausible. Research to sort them out,\nhowever, has suggested that at least some of the influence goes in the direction from interest to achievement; when\nelementary students were given books from which to learn about a new topic, for example, they tended to learn\nmore from books which they chose themselves than from books that were simply assigned (Reynolds & Symons,\n2001). So interest seemed to lead to learning. But this conclusion does not rule out its converse, that achievement\nmay stimulate interest as well. As Joe learns more about history, he steadily finds history more interesting; as\nMcKenzie learns more about biology, she gradually wants to learn more of it.\nStimulating situational interests\nIf a student has little prior personal interest in a topic or activity, the teacher is faced with stimulating initial,\nsituational interest, in hopes that the initial interest will gradually become more permanent and personal. There are\na number of strategies for meeting this challenge:\n\u2022 It helps to include surprises in your comments and in classroom activities from time to time: tell students\nfacts that are true but counter-intuitive, for example, or demonstrate a science experiment that turns out\ndifferently than students expect (Guthrie, Wigfield, & Humenick, 2006).\n\u2022 It also helps to relate new material to students\u2019 prior experiences even if their experiences are not related to\nacademics or to school directly. The concepts of gravitation and acceleration, for example, operate every\ntime a ball is hit or thrown in a softball game. If this connection is pointed out to a student who enjoys\nplaying a lot of softball, the concepts can make concepts more interesting.\nEducational Psychology 117 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\n\u2022 It helps to encourage students to respond to new material actively. By having students talk about the\nmaterial together, for example, students can begin making their own connections to prior personal\ninterests, and the social interaction itself helps to link the material to their personal, social interests as well.\nA caution: seductive details\nEven though it is important to stimulate interest in new material somehow, it is also possible to mislead or\ndistract students accidentally by adding inappropriate, but stimulating features to new material (Garner, et al.,\n1992; Harp & Mayer, 1998). Distractions happen a number of ways, such as any of these among others:\n\u2022 deliberately telling jokes in class\n\u2022 using colorful illustrations or pictures\n\u2022 adding interesting bits of information to a written or verbal explanation\nWhen well chosen, all of these moves can indeed arouse students\u2019 interest in a new topic. But if they do not\nreally relate to the topic at hand, they may simply create misunderstandings or prevent students from focusing on\nkey material. As with most other learning processes, however, there are individual differences among students in\ndistractability, students who are struggling, and are more prone to distraction and misunderstanding than students\nwho are already learning more successfully (Sanchez & Wiley, 2006). On balance the best advice is probably\ntherefore to use strategies to arouse situational interest, but to assess students\u2019 responses to them continually and\nas honestly as possible. The key issue is whether students seem to learn because of stimulating strategies that you\nprovide, or in spite of them.\nMotives related to attributions\nAttributions are perceptions about the causes of success and failure. Suppose that you get a low mark on a test\nand are wondering what caused the low mark. You can construct various explanations for\u2014make various\nattributions about\u2014this failure. Maybe you did not study very hard; maybe the test itself was difficult; maybe you\nwere unlucky; maybe you just are not smart enough. Each explanation attributes the failure to a different factor.\nThe explanations that you settle upon may reflect the truth accurately\u2014or then again, they may not. What is\nimportant about attributions is that they reflect personal beliefs about the sources or causes of success and failure.\nAs such, they tend to affect motivation in various ways, depending on the nature of the attribution (Weiner, 2005).\nLocus, stability, and controllability\nAttributions vary in three underlying ways: locus, stability, and controllability. Locus of an attribution is the\nlocation (figuratively speaking) of the source of success or failure. If you attribute a top mark on a test to your\nability, then the locus is internal; if you attribute the mark to the test\u2019s having easy questions, then the locus is\nexternal. The stability of an attribution is its relative permanence. If you attribute the mark to your ability, then\nthe source of success is relatively stable\u2014by definition, ability is a relatively lasting quality. If you attribute a top\nmark to the effort you put in to studying, then the source of success is unstable\u2014effort can vary and has to be\nrenewed on each occasion or else it disappears. The controllability of an attribution is the extent to which the\nindividual can influence it. If you attribute a top mark to your effort at studying, then the source of success is\nrelatively controllable\u2014you can influence effort simply by deciding how much to study. But if you attribute the\n118 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nmark to simple luck, then the source of the success is uncontrollable\u2014there is nothing that can influence random\nchance.\nAs you might suspect, the way that these attributions combine affects students\u2019 academic motivations in major\nways. It usually helps both motivation and achievement if a student attributes academic successes and failures to\nfactors that are internal and controllable, such as effort or a choice to use particular learning strategies (Dweck,\n2000). Attributing successes to factors that are internal but stable or controllable (like ability), on the other hand, is\nboth a blessing and a curse: sometimes it can create optimism about prospects for future success (\u201cI always do\nwell\u201d), but it can also lead to indifference about correcting mistakes (Dweck, 2006), or even create pessimism if a\nstudent happens not to perform at the accustomed level (\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not as smart as I thought\u201d). Worst of all for\nacademic motivation are attributions, whether stable or not, related to external factors. Believing that performance\ndepends simply on luck (\u201cThe teacher was in a bad mood when marking\u201d) or on excessive difficulty of material\nremoves incentive for a student to invest in learning. All in all, then, it seems important for teachers to encourage\ninternal, stable attributions about success.\nInfluencing students\u2019 attributions\nHow can they do so? One way or another, the effective strategies involve framing teachers\u2019 own explanations of\nsuccess and failure around internal, controllable factors. Instead of telling a student: \u201cGood work! You\u2019re smart!\u201d,\ntry saying: \u201cGood work! Your effort really made a difference, didn\u2019t it?\u201d If a student fails, instead of saying,\u201cToo\nbad! This material is just too hard for you,\u201d try saying, \u201cLet\u2019s find a strategy for practicing this more, and then you\ncan try again.\u201d In both cases the first option emphasizes uncontrollable factors (effort, difficulty level), and the\nsecond option emphasizes internal, controllable factors (effort, use of specific strategies).\nSuch attributions will only be convincing, however, if teachers provide appropriate conditions for students to\nlearn\u2014conditions in which students\u2019 efforts really do pay off. There are three conditions that have to be in place in\nparticular. First, academic tasks and materials actually have to be at about the right level of difficulty. If you give\nproblems in advanced calculus to a first-grade student, the student will not only fail them but also be justified in\nattributing the failure to an external factor, task difficulty. If assignments are assessed in ways that produce highly\nvariable, unreliable marks, then students will rightly attribute their performance to an external, unstable source:\nluck. Both circumstances will interfere with motivation.\nSecond, teachers also need to be ready to give help to individuals who need it\u2014even if they believe that an\nassignment is easy enough or clear enough that students should not need individual help. Readiness to help is\nalways essential because it is often hard to know in advance exactly how hard a task will prove to be for particular\nstudents. Without assistance, a task that proves difficult initially may remain difficult indefinitely, and the student\nwill be tempted to make unproductive, though correct, attributions about his or her failure (\u201cI will never\nunderstand this\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough\u201d, or \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how hard I study\u201d).\nThird, teachers need to remember that ability\u2014usually considered a relatively stable factor\u2014often actually\nchanges incrementally over the long term. Recognizing this fact is one of the best ways to bring about actual\nincreases in students\u2019 abilities (Blackwell, Trzniewski, & Dweck, 2007; Schunk, Pintrich, & Meese, 2008). A middle-\nyears student might play the trumpet in the school band at a high level of ability, but this ability actually reflects a\nlot of previous effort and a gradual increase in ability. A second grade student who reads fluently, in this sense may\nEducational Psychology 119 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nhave high current ability to read; but at some point in the distant past that same student could not read as well, and\neven further back he may not have been able to read at all. The increases in ability have happened at least in part\nbecause of effort. While these ideas may seem obvious, they can easily be forgotten in the classroom because effort\nand ability evolve according to very different time frames. Effort and its results appear relatively immediately; a\nstudent expends effort this week, this day, or even at this very moment, and the effort (if not the results) are visible\nright away. But ability may take longer to show itself; a student often develops it only over many weeks, months, or\nyears.\nMotivation as self-efficacy\nIn addition to being influenced by their goals, interests, and attributions, students\u2019 motives are affected by\nspecific beliefs about the student\u2019s personal capacities. In self-efficacy theory the beliefs become a primary,\nexplicit explanation for motivation (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Self-efficacy is the belief that you are capable of\ncarrying out a specific task or of reaching a specific goal. Note that the belief and the action or goal are specific. Self-\nefficacy is a belief that you can write an acceptable term paper, for example, or repair an automobile, or make\nfriends with the new student in class. These are relatively specific beliefs and tasks. Self-efficacy is not about\nwhether you believe that you are intelligent in general, whether you always like working with mechanical things, or\nthink that you are generally a likeable person. These more general judgments are better regarded as various\nmixtures of self-concepts (beliefs about general personal identity) or of self-esteem (evaluations of identity). They\nare important in their own right, and sometimes influence motivation, but only indirectly (Bong & Skaalvik, 2004).\nSelf-efficacy beliefs, furthermore, are not the same as \u201ctrue\u201d or documented skill or ability. They are self-\nconstructed, meaning that they are personally developed perceptions. There can sometimes therefore be\ndiscrepancies between a person\u2019s self-efficacy beliefs and the person\u2019s abilities. You can believe that you can write a\ngood term paper, for example, without actually being able to do so, and vice versa: you can believe yourself\nincapable of writing a paper, but discover that you are in fact able to do so. In this way self-efficacy is like the\neveryday idea of confidence, except that it is defined more precisely. And as with confidence, it is possible to have\neither too much or too little self-efficacy. The optimum level seems to be either at or slightly above true capacity\n(Bandura, 1997). As we indicate below, large discrepancies between self-efficacy and ability can create motivational\nproblems for the individual.\nEffects of self-efficacy on students\u2019 behavior\nSelf-efficacy may sound like a uniformly desirable quality, but research as well as teachers\u2019 experience suggests\nthat its effects are a bit more complicated than they first appear. Self-efficacy has three main effects, each of which\nhas both a \u201cdark\u201d or undesirable side and a positive or desirable side.\nChoice of tasks\nThe first effect is that self-efficacy makes students more willing to choose tasks where they already feel confident\nof succeeding. This effect is almost inevitable, given the definition of the concept of self-efficacy, it has also been\nsupported by research on self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares & Schunk, 2001). For teachers, the effect on choice can be\neither welcome or not, depending on circumstances. If a student believes that he or she can solve mathematical\nproblems, then the student is more likely to attempt the mathematics homework that the teacher assigns.\nUnfortunately the converse is also true. If a student believes that he or she is incapable of math, then the student is\n120 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nless likely to attempt the math homework (perhaps telling himself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of trying?\u201d), regardless of the\nstudent\u2019s actual ability in math.\nSince self-efficacy is self-constructed, furthermore, it is also possible for students to miscalculate or misperceive\ntheir true skill, and the misperceptions themselves can have complex effects on students\u2019 motivations. From a\nteacher\u2019s point of view, all is well even if students overestimate their capacity but actually do succeed at a relevant\ntask anyway, or if they underestimate their capacity, yet discover that they can succeed and raise their self-efficacy\nbeliefs as a result. All may not be well, though, if students do not believe that they can succeed and therefore do not\neven try, or if students overestimate their capacity by a wide margin, but are disappointed unexpectedly by failure\nand lower their self-efficacy beliefs.\nPersistence at tasks\nA second effect of high self-efficacy is to increase a persistence at relevant tasks. If you believe that you can solve\ncrossword puzzles, but encounter one that takes longer than usual, then you are more likely to work longer at the\npuzzle until you (hopefully) really do solve it. This is probably a desirable behavior in many situations, unless the\npersistence happens to interfere with other, more important tasks (what if you should be doing homework instead\nof working on crossword puzzles?). If you happen to have low self-efficacy for crosswords, on the other hand, then\nyou are more likely to give up early on a difficult puzzle. Giving up early may often be undesirable because it\ndeprives you of a chance to improve your skill by persisting. Then again (on the third hand?), the consequent lack of\nsuccess because of giving up may provide a useful incentive to improve your crossword skills. And again,\nmisperceptions of capacity make a difference. Overestimating your capacity by a lot (excessively high self-efficacy)\nmight lead you not to prepare for or focus on a task properly, and thereby impair your performance. So as with\nchoosing tasks, the effects of self-efficacy vary from one individual to another and one situation to another. The\nteacher\u2019s task is therefore two-fold: first, to discern the variations, and second, to encourage the positive self-\nefficacy beliefs. Table 15 offers some additional advice about how to do this.\nTable 15: Ways of encouraging self-efficacy beliefs\nStrategy Example of what the teacher might say\n1. Set goals with students, and get a commitment \u201cBy the end of the month, I want you to know all of\nfrom them to reach the goals. the times table up to 25 x 25.

Point out that increases in knowledge or skill \u201cEvery time I read another one of your essays, I see\nhappen gradually by sustained effort, not because of more good ideas than the last time. They are so much\ninborn ability. more complete than when you started the year.\u201d\nResponse to failure\nHigh self-efficacy for a task not only increases a person\u2019s persistence at the task, but also improves their ability\nto cope with stressful conditions and to recover their motivation following outright failures. Suppose that you have\ntwo assignments\u2014an essay and a science lab report\u2014due on the same day, and this circumstance promises to make\nyour life hectic as you approach the deadline. You will cope better with the stress of multiple assignments if you\nalready believe yourself capable of doing both of the tasks, than if you believe yourself capable of doing just one of\nthem or (especially) of doing neither. You will also recover better in the unfortunate event that you end up with a\npoor grade on one or even both of the tasks.\nThat is the good news. The bad news, at least from a teacher\u2019s point of view, is that the same resilience can\nsometimes also serve non-academic and non-school purposes. How so? Suppose, instead of two school assignments\ndue on the same day, a student has only one school assignment due, but also holds a part-time evening job as a\nserver in a local restaurant. Suppose, further, that the student has high self-efficacy for both of these tasks; he\nbelieves, in other words, that he is capable of completing the assignment as well as continuing to work at the job.\nThe result of such resilient beliefs can easily be a student who devotes less attention to school work than ideal, and\nwho even ends up with a lower grade on the assignment than he or she is capable of.\nLearned helplessness and self-efficacy\nIf a person\u2019s sense of self-efficacy is very low, he or she can develop learned helplessness, a perception of\ncomplete lack of control in mastering a task. The attitude is similar to depression, a pervasive feeling of apathy and\na belief that effort makes no difference and does not lead to success. Learned helplessness was originally studied\nfrom the behaviorist perspective of classical and operant conditioning by the psychologist Martin Seligman (1995).\nThe studies used a somewhat \u201cgloomy\u201d experimental procedure in which an animal, such as a rat or a dog, was\nrepeatedly shocked in a cage in a way that prevented the animal from escaping the shocks. In a later phase of the\nprocedure, conditions were changed so that the animal could avoid the shocks by merely moving from one side of\nthe cage to the other. Yet frequently they did not bother to do so! Seligman called this behavior learned\nhelplessness.\nIn people, learned helplessness leads to characteristic ways of dealing with problems. They tend to attribute the\nsource of a problem to themselves, to generalize the problem to many aspects of life, and to see the problem as\nlasting or permanent. More optimistic individuals, in contrast, are more likely to attribute a problem to outside\nsources, to see it as specific to a particular situation or activity, and to see it as temporary or time-limited. Consider,\nfor example, two students who each fail a test. The one with a lot of learned helplessness is more likely to explain\nthe failure by saying something like: \u201cI\u2019m stupid; I never perform well on any schoolwork, and I never will perform\nwell at it.\u201d The other, more optimistic student is more likely to say something like: \u201cThe teacher made the test too\nhard this time, so the test doesn\u2019t prove anything about how I will do next time or in other subjects.\u201d\n122 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nWhat is noteworthy about these differences in perception is how much the more optimistic of these perspectives\nresembles high self-efficacy and how much learned helplessness seems to contradict or differ from it. As already\nnoted, high self-efficacy is a strong belief in one\u2019s capacity to carry out a specific task successfully. By definition\ntherefore self-efficacy focuses attention on a temporary or time-limited activity (the task), even though the cause of\nsuccessful completion (oneself) is \u201cinternal\u201d. Teachers can minimize learned helplessness in students, therefore, by\nencouraging their self-efficacy beliefs. There are several ways of doing this, as we explain next.\nSources of self-efficacy beliefs\nPsychologists who study self-efficacy have identified four major sources of self-efficacy beliefs (Pajares &\nSchunk, 2001, 2002). In order of importance they are (1) prior experiences of mastering tasks, (2) watching others\u2019\nmastering tasks, (3) messages or \u201cpersuasion\u201d from others, and (4) emotions related to stress and discomfort.\nFortunately the first three can be influenced by teachers directly, and even the fourth can sometimes be influenced\nindirectly by appropriate interpretive comments from the teacher or others.\nPrior experiences of mastery\nNot surprisingly, past successes at a task increase students\u2019 beliefs that they will succeed again in the future. The\nimplication of this basic fact means that teachers need to help students build a history of successes. Whether they\nare math problems, reading assignments, or athletic activities, tasks have to end with success more often than with\nfailure. Note, though, that the successes have to represent mastery that is genuine or competence that is truly\nauthentic. Success at tasks that are trivial or irrelevant do not improve self-efficacy beliefs, nor does praise for\nsuccesses that a student has not really had (Erikson, 1968/1994).\nAs a practical matter, creating a genuine history of success is most convincing if teachers also work to broaden a\nstudent\u2019s vision of \u201cthe past\u201d. Younger students (elementary-age) in particular have relatively short or limited ideas\nof what counts as \u201cpast experience\u201d; they may go back only a few occasions when forming impressions of whether\nthey can succeed again in the future (Eccles, et al., 1998). Older students (secondary school) gradually develop\nlonger views of their personal \u201cpasts\u201d, both because of improvements in memory and because of accumulating a\npersonal history that is truly longer. The challenge for working with any age, however, is to insure that students\nbase self-efficacy beliefs on all relevant experiences from their pasts, not just on selected or recent experiences.\nWatching others\u2019 experiences of mastery\nA second source of efficacy beliefs comes from vicarious experience of mastery, or observing others\u2019 successes\n(Schunk & Zimmerman, 1997). Simply seeing someone else succeed at a task, in other words, can contribute to\nbelieving that you, too, can succeed. The effect is stronger when the observer lacks experience with the task and\ntherefore may be unsure of his or her own ability. It is also stronger when the model is someone respected by the\nobserver, such as a student\u2019s teacher, or a peer with generally comparable ability. Even under these conditions,\nthough, vicarious experience is not as influential as direct experience. The reasons are not hard to imagine.\nSuppose, for example, you witness both your teacher and a respected friend succeed at singing a favorite tune, but\nyou are unsure whether you personally can sing. In that case you may feel encouraged about your own potential,\nbut are likely still to feel somewhat uncertain of your own efficacy. If on the other hand you do not witness others\u2019\nsinging, but you have a history of singing well yourself, it is a different story. In that case you are likely to believe in\nyour efficacy, regardless of how others perform.\nEducational Psychology 123 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nAll of which suggests that to a modest extent, teachers may be able to enhance students\u2019 self-efficacy by\nmodeling success at a task or by pointing out classmates who are successful. These strategies can work because they\nnot only show how to do a task, but also communicate a more fundamental message, the fact that the task can in\nfact be done. If students are learning a difficult arithmetic procedure, for example, you can help by demonstrating\nthe procedure, or by pointing out classmates who are doing it. Note, though, that vicarious mastery is helpful only if\nbacked up with real successes performed by the students themselves. It is also helpful only if the \u201cmodel\nclassmates\u201d are perceived as truly comparable in ability. Overuse of vicarious models, especially in the absence of\nreal success by learners, can cause learners to disqualify a model\u2019s success; students may simply decide that the\nmodel is \u201cout of their league\u201d in skills and is therefore irrelevant to judging their own potential.\nSocial messages and persuasion\nA third source of efficacy beliefs are encouragements, both implied and stated, that persuade a person of his or\nher capacity to do a task. Persuasion does not create high efficacy by itself, but it often increases or supports it when\ncoupled with either direct or vicarious experience, especially when the persuasion comes from more than one\nperson (Goddard, Hoy, & Hoy, 2004).\nFor teachers, this suggests two things. The first, of course, is that encouragement can motivate students,\nespecially when it is focused on achievable, specific tasks. It can be motivating to say things like: \u201cI think you can do\nit\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve seen you do this before, so I know that you can do it again\u201d. But the second implication is that teachers\nshould arrange wherever possible to support their encouragement by designing tasks at hand that are in fact\nachievable by the student. Striking a balance of encouragement and task difficulty may seem straightforward, but\nsometimes it can be challenging because students can sometimes perceive teachers\u2019 comments and tasks quite\ndifferently from how teachers intend. Giving excessive amounts of detailed help, for example, may be intended as\nsupport for a student, but be taken as a lack of confidence in the student\u2019s ability to do the task independently.\nEmotions related to success, stress or discomfort\nThe previous three sources of efficacy beliefs are all rather cognitive or \u201cthinking oriented\u201d, but emotions also\ninfluence expectations of success or failure. Feeling nervous or anxious just before speaking to a large group\n(sometimes even just a class full of students!) can function like a message that says \u201cI\u2019m not going to succeed at\ndoing this\u201d, even if there is in fact good reason to expect success. But positive feelings can also raise beliefs about\nefficacy. When recalling the excitement of succeeding at a previous, unrelated task, people may overestimate their\nchances of success at a new task with which they have no previous experience, and are therefore in no position to\npredict their efficacy.\nFor teachers, the most important implication is that students\u2019 motivation can be affected when they generalize\nfrom past experience which they believe, rightly or wrongly, to be relevant. By simply announcing a test, for\nexample, a teacher can make some students anxious even before the students find out anything about the test\u2014\nwhether it is easy or difficult, or even comparable in any way to other experiences called \u201ctests\u201d in their pasts.\nConversely, it can be misleading to encourage students on the basis of their success at past academic tasks if the\nearlier tasks were not really relevant to requirements of the new tasks at hand. Suppose, for example, that a middle-\nyears student has previously written only brief opinion-based papers, and never written a research-based paper. In\n124 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthat case boosting the student\u2019s confidence by telling him that \u201cit is just like the papers you wrote before\u201d may not\nbe helpful or even honest.\nA caution: motivation as content versus motivation as process\nA caution about self-efficacy theory is its heavy emphasis on just the process of motivation, at the expense of the\ncontent of motivation. The basic self-efficacy model has much to say about how beliefs affect behavior, but\nrelatively little to say about which beliefs and tasks are especially satisfying or lead to the greatest well-being in\nstudents. The answer to this question is important to know, since teachers might then select tasks as much as\npossible that are intrinsically satisfying, and not merely achievable.\nAnother way of posing this concern is by asking: \u201cIs it possible to feel high self-efficacy about a task that you do\nnot enjoy?\u201d It does seem quite possible for such a gap to exist. As a youth, for example, one of us (Kelvin Seifert)\nhad considerable success with solving mathematics problems in high school algebra, and expended considerable\neffort doing algebra assignments as homework. Before long, he had developed high self-efficacy with regard to\nsolving such problems. But Kelvin never really enjoyed solving the algebra problems, and later even turned away\npermanently from math or science as a career (much to the disappointment of his teachers and family). In this case\nself-efficacy theory nicely explained the process of his motivation\u2014Kelvin\u2019s belief in his capacity led to persistence\nat the tasks. But it did not explain the content of his motivation\u2014his growing dislike of the tasks. Accounting for\nsuch a gap requires a different theory of motivation, one that includes not only specific beliefs, but \u201cdeeper\u201d\npersonal needs as well. An example of this approach is self-determination theory, where we turn next.\nMotivation as self-determination\nCommon sense suggests that human motivations originate from some sort of inner \u201cneed\u201d. We all think of\nourselves as having various \u201cneeds\u201d, a need for food, for example, or a need for companionship\u2014that influences our\nchoices and activities. This same idea also forms part of some theoretical accounts of motivation, though the\ntheories differ in the needs that they emphasize or recognize. In Chapter 2, for example, we talked about Maslow\u2019s\nhierarchy of needs as an example of motivations that function like needs that influence long-term personal\ndevelopment. According to Maslow, individuals must satisfy physical survival needs before they seek to satisfy\nneeds of belonging, they satisfy belonging needs before esteem needs, and so on. In theory, too, people have both\ndeficit needs and growth needs, and the deficit needs must be satisfied before growth needs can influence behavior\n(Maslow, 1970). In Maslow\u2019s theory, as in others that use the concept, a need is a relatively lasting condition or\nfeeling that requires relief or satisfaction and that tends to influence action over the long term. Some needs may\ndecrease when satisfied (like hunger), but others may not (like curiosity). Either way, needs differ from the self-\nefficacy beliefs discussed earlier, which are relatively specific and cognitive, and affect particular tasks and\nbehaviors fairly directly.\nA recent theory of motivation based on the idea of needs is self-determination theory, proposed by the\npsychologists Edward Deci and Richard Ryan (2000), among others. The theory proposes that understanding\nmotivation requires taking into account three basic human needs:\n\u2022 autonomy\u2014the need to feel free of external constraints on behavior\n\u2022 competence\u2014the need to feel capable or skilled\nEducational Psychology 125 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\n\u2022 relatedness\u2014the need to feel connected or involved with others\nNote that these needs are all psychological, not physical; hunger and sex, for example, are not on the list. They\nare also about personal growth or development, not about deficits that a person tries to reduce or eliminate. Unlike\nfood (in behaviorism) or safety (in Maslow\u2019s hierarchy), you can never get enough of autonomy, competence, or\nrelatedness. You (and your students) will seek to enhance these continually throughout life.\nThe key idea of self-determination theory is that when persons (such as you or one of your students) feel that\nthese basic needs are reasonably well met, they tend to perceive their actions and choices to be intrinsically\nmotivated or \u201cself-determined\u201d. In that case they can turn their attention to a variety of activities that they find\nattractive or important, but that do not relate directly to their basic needs. Among your students, for example, some\nindividuals might read books that you have suggested, and others might listen attentively when you explain key\nconcepts from the unit that you happen to be teaching. If one or more basic needs are not met well, however, people\nwill tend to feel coerced by outside pressures or external incentives. They may become preoccupied, in fact, with\nsatisfying whatever need has not been met and thus exclude or avoid activities that might otherwise be interesting,\neducational, or important. If the persons are students, their learning will suffer.\nSelf-determination and intrinsic motivation\nIn proposing the importance of needs, then, self-determination theory is asserting the importance of intrinsic\nmotivation, an idea that has come up before in this book (see especially Chapter 1, about learning theory), and that\nwill come again later (see especially Chapter 9, about planning instruction). The self-determination version of\nintrinsic motivation, however, emphasizes a person\u2019s perception of freedom, rather than the presence or absence of\n\u201creal\u201d constraints on action. Self-determination means a person feels free, even if the person is also operating\nwithin certain external constraints. In principle, a student can experience self-determination even if the student\nmust, for example, live within externally imposed rules of appropriate classroom behavior. To achieve a feeling of\nself-determination, however, the student\u2019s basic needs must be met\u2014needs for autonomy, competence, and\nrelatedness. In motivating students, then, the bottom line is that teachers have an interest in helping students to\nmeet their basic needs, and in not letting school rules or the teachers\u2019 own leadership styles interfere with or block\nsatisfaction of students\u2019 basic needs.\n\u201cPure\u201d self-determination may be the ideal for most teachers and students, of course, but the reality is usually\ndifferent. For a variety of reasons, teachers in most classrooms cannot be expected to meet all students\u2019 basic needs\nat all times. One reason is the sheer number of students, which makes it impossible to attend to every student\nperfectly at all times. Another reason is teachers\u2019 responsibility for a curriculum, which can require creating\nexpectations for students\u2019 activities that sometimes conflict with students\u2019 autonomy or makes them feel\n(temporarily) less than fully competent. Still another reason is students\u2019 personal histories, ranging from divorce to\npoverty, which may create needs in some individuals which are beyond the power of teachers to remedy.\nThe result from students\u2019 point of view is usually only a partial perception of self-determination, and therefore a\nsimultaneous mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Self-determination theory recognizes this reality by\nsuggesting that the \u201cintrinsic-ness\u201d of motivation is really a matter of degree, extending from highly extrinsic,\nthrough various mixtures of intrinsic and extrinsic, to highly intrinsic (Koestner & Losier, 2004). At the extrinsic\nend of the scale is learning that is regulated primarily by external rewards and constraints, whereas at the intrinsic\n126 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nend is learning regulated primarily by learners themselves. Table 16 summarizes and gives examples of the various\nlevels and their effects on motivation. By assuming that motivation is often a mix of the intrinsic and extrinsic, the\njob of the teacher becomes more realistic; the job is not to expect purely intrinsic motivation from students all the\ntime, but simply to arrange and encourage motivations that are as intrinsic as possible. To do this, the teacher\nneeds to support students\u2019 basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.\nTable 16: Combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation\nSource of regulation of Description Example\naction\n\u201cPure\u201d extrinsic motivation Person lacks the intention to take Student completes no work even\nany action, regardless of pressures when pressured or when incentives\nor incentives are offered\nVery external to person Actions regulated only by outside Student completes assignment\npressures and incentives, and only if reminded explicitly of the\ncontrols incentive of grades and/or negative\nconsequences of failing\nSomewhat external Specific actions regulated Student completes assignment\ninternally, but without reflection or independently, but only because of\nconnection to personal needs fear of shaming self or because of\nguilt about consequences of not\ncompleting assignment\nSomewhat internal Actions recognized by individual Student generally completes\nas important or as valuable as a school work independently, but only\nmeans to a more valued goal because of its value in gaining\nadmission to college\nVery internal Actions adopted by individual as Student generally completes\nintegral to self-concept and to school work independently, because\nperson\u2019s major personal values being well educated is part of the\nstudent\u2019s concept of himself\n\u201cPure\u201d intrinsic regulation Actions practiced solely because Student enjoys every topic,\nthey are enjoyable and valued for concept, and assignment that every\ntheir own sake teacher ever assigns, and completes\nschool work solely because of his\nenjoyment\nEducational Psychology 127 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nUsing self-determination theory in the classroom\nWhat are some teaching strategies for supporting students\u2019 needs? Educational researchers have studied this\nquestion from a variety of directions, and their resulting recommendations converge and overlap in a number of\nways. For convenience, the recommendations can be grouped according to the basic need that they address,\nbeginning with the need for autonomy.\nSupporting autonomy in learners\nA major part of supporting autonomy is to give students choices wherever possible (Ryan & Lynch, 2003). The\nchoices that encourage the greatest feelings of self-control, obviously, are ones that are about relatively major issues\nor that have relatively significant consequences for students, such as whom to choose as partners for a major group\nproject. But choices also encourage some feeling of self-control even when they are about relatively minor issues,\nsuch as how to organize your desk or what kind of folder to use for storing your papers at school. It is important,\nfurthermore, to offer choices to all students, including students needing explicit directions in order to work\nsuccessfully; avoid reserving choices for only the best students or giving up offering choices altogether to students\nwho fall behind or who need extra help. All students will feel more self-determined and therefore more motivated if\nthey have choices of some sort.\nTeachers can also support students\u2019 autonomy more directly by minimizing external rewards (like grades) and\ncomparisons among students\u2019 performance, and by orienting and responding themselves to students\u2019 expressed\ngoals and interests. In teaching elementary students about climate change, for example, you can support autonomy\nby exploring which aspects of this topic have already come to students\u2019 attention and aroused their concern. The\npoint of the discussion would not be to find out \u201cwho knows the most\u201d about this topic, but to build and enhance\nstudents\u2019 intrinsic motivations as much as possible. In reality, of course, it may not be possible to succeed at this\ngoal fully\u2014some students may simply have no interest in the topic, for example, or you may be constrained by time\nor resources from individualizing certain activities fully. But any degree of attention to students\u2019 individuality, as\nwell as any degree of choice, will support students\u2019 autonomy.\nSupporting the need for competence\nThe most obvious way to make students feel competent is by selecting activities which are challenging but\nnonetheless achievable with reasonable effort and assistance (Elliott, McGregor, & Thrash, 2004). Although few\nteachers would disagree with this idea, there are times when it is hard to put into practice, such as when you first\nmeet a class at the start of a school year and therefore are unfamiliar with their backgrounds and interests. But\nthere are some strategies that are generally effective even if you are not yet in a position to know the students well.\nOne is to emphasize activities that require active response from students. Sometimes this simply means selecting\nprojects, experiments, discussions and the like that require students to do more than simply listen. Other times it\nmeans expecting active responses in all interactions with students, such as by asking questions that call for\n\u201cdivergent\u201d (multiple or elaborated) answers. In a social studies class, for example, try asking \u201cWhat are some ways\nwe could find out more about our community?\u201d instead of \u201cTell me the three best ways to find out about our\ncommunity.\u201d The first question invites more divergent, elaborate answers than the second.\nAnother generally effective way to support competence is to respond and give feedback as immediately as\npossible. Tests and term papers help subsequent learning more if returned, with comments, sooner rather than\n128 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nlater. Discussions teach more if you include your own ideas in them, while still encouraging students\u2019 input. Small\ngroup and independent activities are more effective if you provide a convenient way for students to consult\nauthoritative sources for guidance when needed, whether the source is you personally, a teaching assistant, a\nspecially selected reading, or even a computer program. In addition, you can sometimes devise tasks that create a\nfeeling of competence because they have a \u201cnatural\u201d solution or ending point. Assembling a jigsaw puzzle of the\ncommunity, for example, has this quality, and so does creating a jigsaw puzzle of the community if the students\nneed a greater challenge.\nSupporting the need to relate to others\nThe main way of support students\u2019 need to relate to others is to arrange activities in which students work\ntogether in ways that are mutually supportive, that recognize students\u2019 diversity, and minimize competition among\nindividuals. We will have more to say about this strategy in Chapter 8 (\u201cInstructional strategies\u201d), where we\ndescribe several varieties of cooperative learning, as well as some of their pitfalls to be avoided. For now, simply\nnote that having students work together can happen in many ways. You can, for example, deliberately arrange\nprojects that require a variety of talents; some educators call such activities \u201crich group work\u201d (Cohen, 1994; Cohen,\nBrody, & Sapon-Shevin, 2004). In studying in small groups about medieval society, for example, one student can\ncontribute his drawing skills, another can contribute his writing skills, and still another can contribute his dramatic\nskills. The result can be a multi-faceted presentation\u2014written, visual, and oral. The groups needed for rich group\nwork provide for students\u2019 relationships with each other, whether they contain six individuals or only two.\nThere are other ways to encourage relationships among students. In the jigsaw classroom (Aronson & Patnoe,\n1997), for example, students work together in two phases. In the first phase, groups of \u201cexperts\u201d work together to\nfind information on a specialized topic. In a second phase the expert groups split up and reform into \u201cgeneralist\u201d\ngroups containing one representative from each former expert group. In studying the animals of Africa, for\nexample, each expert group might find information about a different particular category of animal or plant; one\ngroup might focus on mammal, another on bird, a third on reptiles, and so on. In the second phase of the jigsaw,\nthe generalist groups would pool information from the experts to get a more well-rounded view of the topic. The\ngeneralist groups would each have an expert about mammals, for example, but also an expert about birds and about\nreptiles.\nAs a teacher, you can add to these organizational strategies by encouraging the development of your own\nrelationships with class members. Your goal, as teacher, is to demonstrate caring and interest in your students not\njust as students, but as people. The goal also involves behaving as if good relationships between and among class\nmembers are not only possible, but ready to develop and perhaps even already developing. A simple tactic, for\nexample, is to speak of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d as much as possible, rather than speaking of \u201cyou students\u201d. Another tactic is\nto present cooperative activities and assignments without apology, as if they are in the best interests not just of\nstudents, but of \u201cus all\u201d in the classroom, yourself included.\nKeeping self-determination in perspective\nIn certain ways self-determination theory provides a sensible way to think about students\u2019 intrinsic motivation\nand therefore to think about how to get them to manage their own learning. A particular strength of the theory is\nthat it recognizes degrees of self-determination and bases many ideas on this reality. Most people recognize\nEducational Psychology 129 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\ncombinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation guiding particular activities in their own lives. We might enjoy\nteaching, for example, but also do this job partly to receive a paycheck. To its credit, self-determination theory also\nrelies on a list of basic human needs\u2014autonomy, competence, and relatedness\u2014that relate comfortably with some\nof the larger purposes of education.\nAlthough these are positive features for understanding and influencing students\u2019 classroom motivation, some\neducators and psychologists nonetheless have lingering questions about the limitations of self-determination\ntheory. One is whether merely providing choices actually improves students\u2019 learning, or simply improves their\nsatisfaction with learning. There is evidence supporting both possibilities (Flowerday & Schraw, 2003; Deci &\nRyan, 2003), and it is likely that there are teachers whose classroom experience supports both possibilities as well.\nAnother question is whether it is possible to overdo attention to students\u2019 needs\u2014and again there is evidence for\nboth favoring and contradicting this possibility. Too many choices can actually make anyone (not just a student)\nfrustrated and dissatisfied with a choice the person actually does make (Schwartz, 2004). Furthermore,\ndifferentiating activities to students\u2019 competence levels may be impractical if students are functioning at extremely\ndiverse levels within a single class, as sometimes happens. Differentiating may be inappropriate, too, if it holds a\nteacher back from covering key curriculum objectives which students need and which at least some students are\nable to learn. These are serious concerns, though in our opinion not serious enough to give up offering choices to\nstudents or to stop differentiating instruction altogether. In Chapter 7 (\u201cClassroom management and the learning\nenvironment\u201d), therefore, we explain the practical basis for this opinion, by describing workable ways for offering\nchoices and recognizing students\u2019 diversity.\nExpectancy x value: effects on students\u2019 motivation\nAs we have explained in this chapter, motivation is affected by several factors, including reinforcement for\nbehavior, but especially also students\u2019 goals, interests, and sense of self-efficacy and self-determination. The factors\ncombine to create two general sources of motivation: students\u2019 expectation of success and the value that students\nplace on a goal. Viewing motivation in this way is often called the expectancy-value model of motivation (Wigfield &\nEccles, 2002; Wigfield, Tonk, & Eccles, 2004), and sometimes written with a multiplicative formula: expectancy x\nvalue = motivation. The relationship between expectation and value is \u201cmultiplicative\u201d rather than additive because\nin order to be motivated, it is necessary for a person to have at least a modest expectation of success and to assign a\ntask at least some positive value. If you have high expectations of success but do not value a task at all (mentally\nassign it a \u201c0\u201d value), then you will not feel motivated at all. Likewise, if you value a task highly but have no\nexpectation of success about completing it (assign it a \u201c0\u201d expectancy), then you also will not feel motivated at all.\nExpectancies are the result of various factors, but particularly the goals held by a student, and the student\u2019s self-\nefficacy, which we discussed earlier in this chapter. A student with mastery goals and strong self-efficacy for a task,\nfor example, is likely to hold high expectations for success\u2014almost by definition. Values are also the result of\nvarious factors, but especially students\u2019 interests and feelings of self-determination. A student who has a lasting\npersonal interest in a task or topic and is allowed to choose it freely is especially likely to value the task\u2014and\ntherefore to feel motivated.\nIdeally both expectancies and values are high in students on any key learning task. The reality, however, is that\nstudents sometimes do not expect success, nor do they necessarily value it when success is possible. How can a\n130 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nteacher respond to low expectations and low valuing? We have offered a number of suggestions to meet this\nchallenge throughout this chapter. In brief, raising low expectations depends on adjusting task difficulty so that\nsuccess becomes a reasonable prospect: a teacher must make tasks neither too hard nor too easy. Reaching this\ngeneral goal depends in turn on thoughtful, appropriate planning\u2014selecting reasonable objectives, adjusting them\non the basis of experience, finding supportive materials, and providing students with help when needed.\nRaising the value of academic tasks is equally important, but the general strategies for doing so are different\nthan for raising expectations. Increasing value requires linking the task to students\u2019 personal interests and prior\nknowledge, showing the utility of the task to students\u2019 future goals, and showing that the task is valuable to other\npeople whom students\u2019 respect. Some of these strategies were discussed earlier in this chapter, but others (e.g.\nlinking new learning with prior knowledge) are discussed in Chapter 2, which is called \u201cThe learning process\u201d.\nTARGET: a model for integrating ideas about motivation\nA model of motivation that integrates many ideas about motivation, including those in this chapter, has been\ndeveloped by Carole Ames (1990, 1992). The acronym or abbreviated name for the program is TARGET, which\nstands for six elements of effective motivation:\n\u2022 Task\n\u2022 Authority\n\u2022 Recognition\n\u2022 Grouping\n\u2022 Evaluating\n\u2022 Time\nEach of the elements contributes to students' motivation either directly or indirectly.\nTask\nAs explained earlier, students experience tasks in terms of their value, their expectation of success, and their\nauthenticity. The value of a task is assessed by its importance, interest to the student, usefulness or utility, and the\ncost in terms of effort and time to achieve it. Expectation of success is assessed by a student's perception of the\ndifficulty of a task. Generally a middling level of difficulty is optimal for students; too easy, and the task seems\ntrivial (not valuable or meaningful), and too hard, and the task seems unlikely to succeed and in this sense useless.\nAuthenticity refers to how much a task relates to real-life experiences of students; the more it does so, the more it\ncan build on students' interests and goals, and the more meaningful and motivating it becomes.\nAutonomy\nMotivation is enhanced if students feel a degree of autonomy or responsibility for a learning task. Autonomy\nstrengthens self-efficacy and self-determination\u2014two valued and motivating attitudes described earlier in this\nchapter. Where possible, teachers can enhance autonomy by offering students' choices about assignments and by\nencouraging them to take initiative about their own learning.\nRecognition\nTeachers can support students' motivation by recognizing their achievements appropriately. Much depends,\nhowever, on how this is done; as discussed earlier, praise sometimes undermines performance. It is not especially\neffective if praise is very general and lacking in detailed reasons for the praise; or if praise is for qualities which a\nEducational Psychology 131 A Global Text 6. Student motivation\nstudent cannot influence (like intelligence instead of effort); or if praise is offered so widely that it loses meaning or\neven becomes a signal that performance has been substandard. Many of these paradoxical effects are described by\nself-determination and self-efficacy theory (and were explained earlier in this chapter).\nGrouping\nMotivation is affected by how students are grouped together for their work\u2014a topic discussed in more detail in\nChapter 8 (\u201cInstructional Strategies\u201d). There are many ways to group students, but they tend to fall into three types:\ncooperative, competitive, and individualistic (Johnson & Johnson, 1999). In cooperative learning, a set of students\nwork together to achieve a common goal (for example, producing a group presentation for the class); often they\nreceive a final grade, or part of a final grade, in common. In competitive learning, students work individually, and\ntheir grades reflect comparisons among the students (for example, their performances are ranked relative to each\nother, or they are \u201cgraded on a curve\u201d). In individualistic learning, students work by themselves, but their grades\nare unrelated to the performance of classmates. Research that compares these three forms of grouping tends to\nfavor cooperative learning groups, which apparently supports students' need for belonging\u2014an idea important in\nself-determination theory discussed earlier in this chapter.\nEvaluation\nGrouping structures obviously affect how students' efforts are evaluated. A focus on comparing students, as\nhappens with competitive structures, can distract students from thinking about the material to be learned, and to\nfocus instead on how they appear to external authorities; the question shifts from \u201cWhat am I learning?\u201d to \u201cWhat\nwill the teacher think about my performance?\u201d A focus on cooperative learning, on the other hand, can have double-\nedged effects: students are encouraged to help their group mates, but may also be tempted to rely excessively on\nothers' efforts or alternatively to ignore each other's contributions and overspecialize their own contributions. Some\ncompromise between cooperative and individualistic structures seems to create optimal motivation for learning\n(Slavin, 1995).\nTime\nAs every teacher knows, students vary in the amount of time needed to learn almost any material or task.\nAccommodating the differences can be challenging, but also important for maximizing students' motivation. School\ndays are often filled with interruptions and fixed intervals of time devoted to non-academic activities\u2014facts that\nmake it difficult to be flexible about granting individuals different amounts of time to complete academic tasks.\nNonetheless a degree of flexibility is usually possible: larger blocks of time can sometimes be created for important\nactivities (for example, writing an essay), and sometimes enrichment activities can be arranged for some students\nwhile others receive extra attention from the teacher on core or basic tasks. More about such strategies is discussed\nin Chapter 8 (\u201cInstructional Strategies\u201d).\nThe bottom line about motivation: sustaining focus on learning\nSooner or later when you teach, there will be situations appropriate for each perspective about motivation\ndescribed in this chapter. There will be times when focusing exclusively on students\u2019 appropriate behavior (or lack\nthereof) will be both necessary and sufficient evidence of motivation. But there will be other times when it is\nimportant to encourage students\u2019 beliefs that they can accomplish specific tasks, and still other times when\n132 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nproviding for students\u2019 underlying needs for competence or social connection is important. Think of these\nperspectives as alternatives to be used either singly or in combination when the time is right.\nBecause of your own values, attitudes, or beliefs, you may find one perspective more personally compatible than\nanother. Even if you settle on favorite ways of motivating students, though, we encourage you to keep the other, less\nfavored approaches in reserve anyway, and to experiment with them. We believe that an eclectic approach to\nmotivation will enrich your teaching the most, and enrich your students\u2019 motivation and learning as well. If there is\na single lesson from the concepts about motivation outlined in this chapter, it is this: academic motivation has no\nsingle source, and teachers motivate students the best when they assume motivation is complex. The next two\nchapters look at ways of realizing such \u201cbroad-mindedness\u201d in practice, first when you prepare activities and classes\nand later when you actually teach them.\nChapter summary\nMotivation\u2014the energy or drive that gives behavior direction and focus\u2014can be understood in a variety of ways,\neach of which has implications for teaching. One perspective on motivation comes from behaviorism, and equates\nunderlying drives or motives with their outward, visible expression in behavior. Most others, however, come from\ncognitive theories of learning and development. Motives are affected by the kind of goals set by students\u2014whether\nthey are oriented to mastery, performance, failure-avoidance, or social contact. They are also affected by students\u2019\ninterests, both personal and situational. And they are affected by students\u2019 attributions about the causes of success\nand failure\u2014whether they perceive the causes are due to ability, effort, task difficulty, or luck.\nA major current perspective about motivation is based on self-efficacy theory, which focuses on a person\u2019s belief\nthat he or she is capable of carrying out or mastering a task. High self-efficacy affects students\u2019 choice of tasks, their\npersistence at tasks, and their resilience in the face of failure. It helps to prevent learned helplessness, a perception\nof complete lack of control over mastery or success. Teachers can encourage high self-efficacy beliefs by providing\nstudents with experiences of mastery and opportunities to see others\u2019 experiences of mastery, by offering well-\ntimed messages persuading them of their capacity for success, and by interpreting students\u2019 emotional reactions to\nsuccess, failure and stress.\nAn extension of self-efficacy theory is self-determination theory, which is based on the idea that everyone has\nbasic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness to others. According to the theory, students will be\nmotivated more intrinsically if these three needs are met as much as possible. A variety of strategies can assist\nteachers in doing so. As a practical matter, the strategies can encourage motivation that is more intrinsic to\nstudents, but usually not completely intrinsic.\nOn the Internet\n<www.des.emory.edu/mfp/self-efficacy.html> This is a rather extensive site maintained about all\naspects of self-efficacy theory. The site gives access to a number of published articles on the subject as well as to\nextensive \u201clecture\u201d notes by Frank Pajares, who publishes and teaches about self-efficacy theory.\n<www.psych.rochester.edu/SDT/faculty/index.html> This, too, is a rather extensive site, maintained at\nthe University of Rochester by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, two psychologists who have published extensively\nabout self-determination theory.

Classroom management\nand the learning environment\nThis is an excerpt from a professional journal kept by one of us (Kelvin Seifert) when he was teaching\nkindergarten:\n20xx-11-14: Today my student Carol sat in the circle, watching others while we all played Duck,\nDuck, Goose (in this game, one student is outside the circle, tags another student who then chases the\nfirst person around the circle). Carol\u2019s turn had already passed. Apparently she was bored, because\nshe flopped on her back, smiling broadly, rolling around luxuriously on the floor in the path of the\nother runners. Several classmates noticed her, smiled or giggled, began flopping down as well. One\nchaser tripped over a \u201cflopper\u201d.\n\u201cSit up, Carol\u201d, said I, the ever-vigilant teacher. \u201cYou\u2019re in the way.\u201d But no result. I repeated this\ntwice, firmly; then moved to pick her up.\nInstantly Carol ran to the far side of the gym, still smiling broadly. Then her best friend ran off with\nher. Now a whole new game was launched, or really two games: \u201cRun-from-the-teacher\u201d and\n\u201cEnjoy-being-watched-by-everybody\u201d. A lot more exciting, unfortunately, than Duck, Duck, Goose!\nAn excerpt from Kelvin\u2019s same journal several years later, when he was teaching math in high school:\n20xx-3-4: The same four students sat in the back again today, as usual. They seem to look in every\ndirection except at me, even when I\u2019m explaining material that they need to know. The way they\nsmile and whisper to each other, it seems almost like they are \u201cin love\u201d with each other, though I can\u2019t\nbe sure who loves whom the most.\nOthers\u2014students not part of the foursome\u2014seem to react variously. Some seem annoyed, turn the\nother way, avoid talking with the group, and so on. But others seem almost envious\u2014as if they want\nto be part of the \u201cin\u201d group, too, and were impressed with the foursome\u2019s ability to get away with\nbeing inattentive and almost rude. Either way, I think a lot of other students are being distracted.\nTwice during the period today, I happened to notice members of the group passing a note, and then\ngiggling and looking at me. By the end, I had had enough of this sort of thing, so I kept them in\nbriefly after class and asked one of them to read the note. They looked a bit embarrassed and\nhesitant, but eventually one of them opened the note and read it out loud. \u201cChoose one\u201d, it said. \u201cMr\nSeifert looks (1) old ____, (2) stupid____, or (3) clueless____.\u201d\nKelvin's experiences in managing these very different classrooms taught him what every teacher knows or else\nquickly learns: management matters a lot. But his experiences also taught him that management is about more\nthan correcting the misbehaviors of individuals, more than just discipline. Classroom management is also\nEducational Psychology 138 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nabout orchestrating or coordinating entire sets or sequences of learning activities so that everyone, misbehaving or\nnot, learns as easily and productively as possible. Educators sometimes therefore describe good management as the\ncreation of a positive learning environment, because the term calls attention to the totality of activities and\npeople in a classroom, as well as to their goals and expectations about learning (Jones & Jones, 2007). When one of\nus (Kelvin) was teaching, he used both terms almost interchangeably, though in speaking of management he more\noften was referring to individual students\u2019 behavior and learning, and in speaking of the learning environment he\nmore often meant the overall \u201cfeel\u201d of the class as a whole.\nWhy classroom management matters\nManaging the learning environment is both a major responsibility and an on-going concern for all teachers, even\nthose with years of experience (Good & Brophy, 2002). There are several reasons. In the first place, a lot goes on in\nclassrooms simultaneously, even when students seem to be doing only one task in common. Twenty-five students\nmay all seem to be working on a sheet of math problems. But look more closely: several may be stuck on a\nparticular problem, each for different reasons. A few others have worked only the first problem or two and are now\nchatting quietly with each other instead of continuing. Still others have finished and are wondering what to do next.\nAt any one moment each student needs something different\u2014different information, different hints, different kinds\nof encouragement. Such diversity increases even more if the teacher deliberately assigns multiple activities to\ndifferent groups or individuals (for example, if some students do a reading assignment while others do the math\nproblems).\nAnother reason that managing the environment is challenging is because a teacher can not predict everything\nthat will happen in a class. A well-planned lesson may fall flat on its face, or take less time than expected, and you\nfind yourself improvising to fill class time. On the other hand an unplanned moment may become a wonderful,\nsustained exchange among students, and prompt you to drop previous plans and follow the flow of discussion.\nInterruptions happen continually: a fire drill, a drop-in visit from another teacher or the principal, a call on the\nintercom from the office. An activity may indeed turn out well, but also rather differently than you intended; you\ntherefore have to decide how, if at all, to adjust the next day's lesson to allow for this surprise.\nA third reason for the importance of management is that students form opinions and perceptions about your\nteaching that are inconsistent with your own. What you intend as encouragement for a shy student may seem to the\nstudent herself like \u201cforced participation\u201d. An eager, outgoing classmate watching your effort to encourage the shy\nstudent, moreover, may not see you as either encouraging or coercing, but as overlooking or ignoring other students\nwho already want to participate. The variety of perceptions can lead to surprises in students\u2019 responses\u2014most often\nsmall ones, but occasionally major.\nAt the broadest, society-wide level, classroom management challenges teachers because public schooling is not\nvoluntary, and students\u2019 presence in a classroom is therefore not a sign, in and of itself, that they wish to learn.\nInstead, students\u2019 presence is just a sign that an opportunity exists for teachers to motivate students to learn. Some\nstudents, of course, do enjoy learning and being in school, almost regardless of what teachers do! Others do enjoy\nschool, but only because teachers have worked hard to make classroom life pleasant and interesting. Those students\nbecome motivated because you have successfully created a positive learning environment and have sustained it\nthrough skillful management.\n139 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nFortunately it is possible to earn this sort of commitment from many students, and this chapter describes ways\nof doing so. We begin with ways of preventing management problems from happening by increasing students\u2019 focus\non learning. The methods include ideas about arranging classroom space, about establishing procedures, routines,\nand rules, and about communicating the importance of learning to students and parents. After these prevention\noriented discussions, we look at ways of refocusing students when and if their minds or actions stray from the tasks\nat hand. As you probably know from being a student, bringing students back on task can happen in many ways, and\nthe ways vary widely in the energy and persistence required of the teacher. We try to indicate some of these\nvariations, but because of space limitations and because of the richness of classroom life, we cannot describe them\nall.\nPreventing management problems by focusing students on learning\nThe easiest management problems to solve are ones that do not happen in the first place! Even before the school\nyear begins, you can minimize behavior problems by arranging classroom furniture and materials in ways that\nencourage a focus on learning as much as possible. Later, once school begins, you can establish procedures and\nrules that support a focus on learning even more.\nArranging classroom space\nViewed broadly, classrooms may seem to be arranged in similar ways, but there are actually important\nalternative arrangements to consider. Variations exist because of grade level, the subjects taught, the teacher\u2019s\nphilosophy of education, and of course the size of the room and the furniture available. Whatever the arrangement\nthat you choose, it should help students to focus on learning tasks as much as possible and minimize the chances of\ndistractions. Beyond these basic principles, however, the \u201cbest\u201d arrangement depends on what your students need\nand on the kind of teaching that you prefer and feel able to provide (Boyner, 2003; Nations & Boyett, 2002). The\nnext sections describe some of the options. In considering them (and before moving too much furniture around\nyour room!), you might want to try experimenting with spatial arrangements \u201cvirtually\u201d by using one of the\ncomputer programs available on the Internet (see: http://teacher.scholastic.com/tools/class_setup/).\nDisplays and wall space\nAll classrooms have walls, of course, and how you fill them can affect the mood or feeling of a classroom. Ample\ndisplays make a room interesting and can be used to reinforce curriculum goals and display (and hence publicly\nrecognize) students\u2019 work. But too many displays can also make a room seem \u201cbusy\u201d or distracting as well as\nphysically smaller. They can also be more work to maintain. If you are starting a new school year, then, a good\nstrategy is to decorate some of the wall or bulletin board space, but not to fill it all immediately. Leaving some space\nopen leaves flexibility to respond to ideas and curriculum needs that emerge after the year is underway. The same\nadvice applies especially for displays that are high maintenance, such as aquariums, pets, and plants. These can\nserve wonderfully as learning aids, but do not have to be in place on the first day of school. Not only the students,\nbut also you yourself, may already have enough to cope with at that time.\nComputers in the classroom\nIf you are like the majority of teachers, you will have only one computer in your room, or at most just a few, and\ntheir placement may be pre-determined by the location of power and cable outlets. If so, you need to think about\ncomputer placement early in the process of setting up a room. Once the location of computers is set, locations for\nEducational Psychology 140 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\ndesks, high-usage shelves, and other moveable items can be chosen more sensibly\u2014in general, as already\nmentioned, so as to minimize distractions to students and to avoid unnecessary traffic congestion.\nVisibility of and interactions with students\nLearning is facilitated if the furniture and space allow you to see all students and to interact with them from a\ncomfortable distance. Usually this means that the main, central part of the room\u2014where desks and tables are\nusually located\u2014needs to be as open and as spacious as possible. While this idea may seem obvious, enacting it can\nbe challenging in practice if the room itself is small or shaped unusually. In classrooms with young students\n(kindergarten), furthermore, open spaces tend to allow, if not invite, physical movement of children\u2014a feature that\nyou may consider either constructive or annoying, depending on your educational goals and the actual level of\nactivity that occurs.\nSpatial arrangements unique to grade levels or subjects\nThe best room arrangement sometimes depends on the grade level or subject area of the class. If you teach in\nelementary school, for example, you may need to think especially about where students can keep their daily\nbelongings, such as coats and lunches. In some schools, these can be kept outside the classroom\u2014but not\nnecessarily. Some subjects and grade levels, furthermore, lend themselves especially well to small group\ninteraction, in which case you might prefer not to seat students in rows, but instead around small-group tables or\nwork areas. The latter arrangement is sometimes preferred by elementary teachers, but is also useful in high\nschools wherever students need lots of counter space, as in some shops or art courses, or where they need to\ninteract, as in English as a Second Language courses (McCafferty, Jacobs, & Iddings, 2006). The key issue in\ndeciding between tables and rows, however, is not grade level or subject as such, but the amount of small group\ninteraction you want to encourage, compared to the amount of whole-group instruction. As a rule, tables make\nworking with peers easier, and rows make listening to the teacher more likely and group work slightly more\nawkward physically.\nIronically, some teachers also experience challenges about room arrangement because they do not actually have\na classroom of their own, because they must move each day among other teachers\u2019 rooms. \u201cFloating\u201d is especially\nlikely for specialized teachers (e.g. music teachers in elementary schools, who move from class to class) and in\nschools have an overall shortage of classrooms. Floating can sometimes be annoying to the teacher, though it\nactually also has advantages, such as not having to take responsibility for how other teachers\u2019 rooms are arranged.\nIf you find yourself floating, it helps to consider a few key strategies, such as:\n\u2022 consider using a permanent cart to move crucial supplies from room to room\n\u2022 make sure that every one of your rooms has an overhead projector (do not count on using chalkboards or\ncomputers in other teachers\u2019 rooms)\n\u2022 talk to the other teachers about having at least one shelf or corner in each room designated for your\nexclusive use\nEstablishing daily procedures and routines\nProcedures or routines are specific ways of doing common, repeated classroom tasks or activities. Examples\ninclude checking daily attendance, dealing with students who arrive late, or granting permission to leave the\n141 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nclassroom for an errand. Academically related procedures include ways of turning in daily homework (e.g. putting it\non a designated shelf at a particular time), of gaining the teacher\u2019s attention during quiet seat work (e.g. raising\nyour hand and waiting), and of starting a \u201cfree choice\u201d activity after completing a classroom assignment.\nProcedures serve the largely practical purpose of making activities and tasks flow smoothly\u2014a valuable and\nnecessary purpose in classrooms, where the actions of many people have to be coordinated within limited time and\nspace. As such, procedures are more like social conventions than like moral expectations. They are only indirectly\nabout what is ethically right or ethically desirable to do (Turiel, 2006). Most procedures or routines can be\naccomplished in more than one way, with only minor differences in outcomes. There is more than one way, for\nexample, for the procedure of taking attendance: the teacher could call the role, delegate a student to call the role,\nor note students\u2019 presence on a seating chart. Each variation accomplishes essentially the same task, and the choice\nmay be less important than the fact that the class coordinates its actions somehow, by committing to some sort of\nchoice.\nFor teachers, of course, an initial management task is to establish procedures and routines as promptly as\npossible. Because of the conventional quality of procedures, some teachers find that it works well simply to\nannounce and explain key procedures without inviting much discussion from students (\u201cHere is how we will choose\npartners for the group work\u201d). Other teachers prefer to invite input from students when creating procedures (asking\nthe class, \u201cWhat do you feel is the best way for students to get my attention during a quiet reading time?\u201d). Both\napproaches have advantages as well as disadvantages. Simply announcing key procedures saves time and insures\nconsistency in case you teach more than one class (as you would in high school). But it puts more responsibility on\nthe teacher to choose procedures that are truly reasonable and practical. Inviting students\u2019 input, on the other\nhand, can help students to become aware of and committed to procedures, but at the cost of requiring more time to\nsettle on them. It also risks creating confusion if you teach multiple classes, each of which adopts different\nprocedures. Whatever approach you choose, of course, they have to take into account any procedures or rules\nimposed by the school or school district as a whole. A school may have a uniform policy about how to record daily\nattendance, for example, and that policy may determine, either partly or completely, how you take attendance with\nyour particular students.\nEstablishing classroom rules\nUnlike procedures or routines, rules express standards of behavior for which individual students need to take\nresponsibility. Although they are like procedures in that they sometimes help in insuring the efficiency of classroom\ntasks, they are really about encouraging students to be responsible for learning and showing respect for each other.\nExhibit 8 lists a typical set of classroom rules.\nEducational Psychology 142 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\n\u2022 Treat others with courtesy and politeness.\n\u2022 Make sure to bring required materials to class and to activities.\n\u2022 Be on time for class and other activities.\n\u2022 Listen to the teacher and to others when they are speaking.\n\u2022 Follow all school rules.\nExhibit 8: Sample set of classroom rules\nNote three things about the examples in Exhibit 8. One is that the rules are not numerous; the table lists only\nfive. Most educational experts recommend keeping the number of rules to a minimum in order to make them easier\nto remember (Thorson, 2003; Brophy, 2004). A second feature is that they are stated in positive terms (\u201cDo X\u2026\u201d)\nrather than negative terms (\u201cDo not do Y\u2026\u201d), a strategy that emphasizes and clarifies what students should do\nrather than what they should avoid. A third feature is that each rule actually covers a collection of more specific\nbehaviors. The rule \u201cBring all materials to class\u201d, for example, covers bringing pencils, paper, textbooks, homework\npapers, and permission slips\u2014depending on the situation. As a result of their generality, rules often have a degree\nof ambiguity that sometimes requires interpretation. Infractions may occur that are marginal or \u201cin a grey area\u201d,\nrather than clear cut. A student may bring a pen, for example, but the pen may not work properly. You may\ntherefore wonder whether this incident is really a failure to follow the rule, or just an unfortunate (and in this case\nminor) fault of the pen manufacturer.\nAs with classroom procedures, rules can be planned either by the teacher alone, or by the teacher with advice\nfrom students. The arguments for each approach are similar to the arguments for procedures: rules \u201claid on\u201d by the\nteacher may be more efficient and consistent, and in this sense more fair, but rules influenced by the students may\nbe supported more fully by the students. Because rules focus strongly on personal responsibility, however, there is a\nstronger case for involving students in making them than in making classroom procedures (Brookfield, 2006;\nKohn, 2006). In any case the question of who plans classroom rules is not necessarily an either/or choice. It is\npossible in principle to impose certain rules on students (for example, \u201cAlways be polite to each other\u201d) but let the\nstudents determine the consequences for violations of certain rules (for example, \u201cIf a student is discourteous to a\nclassmate, he/she must apologize to the student in writing\u201d). Some mixture of influences is probably inevitable, in\nfact, if only because the class needs to take into account your own moral commitments as the teacher as well as any\nimposed by the school (like \u201cNo smoking in the school\u201d or \u201cAlways walk in the hallways\u201d).\nPacing and structuring lessons and activities\nOne of the best ways to prevent management problems is by pacing and structuring lessons or activities as\nsmoothly and continuously as possible. This goal depends on three major strategies:\n\u2022 selecting tasks or activities at an appropriate level of difficulty for your students\n\u2022 providing a moderate level of structure or clarity to students about what they are supposed to do, especially\nduring transitions between activities\n143 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u2022 keeping alert to the flow and interplay of behaviors for the class as a whole and for individuals within it.\nEach strategy presents special challenges to teachers, but also opportunities for helping students to learn.\nChoosing tasks at an appropriate level of difficulty\nAs experienced teachers know and as research has confirmed, students are most likely to engage with learning\nwhen tasks are of moderate difficulty, neither too easy nor too hard and therefore neither boring nor frustrating\n(Britt, 2005). Finding the right level of difficulty, however, can be a challenge if you have little experience teaching a\nparticular grade level or curriculum, or even if students are simply new to you and their abilities unknown. Whether\nfamiliar or not, members of any class are likely to have diverse skills and readiness\u2013a fact that makes it challenging\nto determine what level of difficulty is appropriate. A common strategy for dealing with these challenges is to begin\nunits, lessons, or projects with tasks that are relatively easy and familiar. Then, introduce more difficult material or\ntasks gradually until students seem challenged, but not overwhelmed. Following this strategy gives the teacher a\nchance to observe and diagnose students\u2019 learning needs before adjusting content, and it gives students a chance to\norient themselves to the teacher\u2019s expectations, teaching style, and topic of study without becoming frustrated\nprematurely. Later in a unit, lesson, or project, students seem better able to deal with more difficult tasks or content\n(Van Merrionboer, 2003). The principle seems to help as well with \u201cauthentic\u201d learning tasks\u2014ones that resemble\nreal-world activities, such as learning to drive an automobile or to cook a meal, and that present a variety of\ncomplex tasks simultaneously. Even in those cases it helps to isolate and focus on the simplest subtasks first (such\nas \u201cput the key in the ignition\u201d) and move to harder tasks only later (such as parallel parking).\nSequencing instruction is only a partial solution to finding the best \u201clevel\u201d of difficulty, however, because it does\nnot deal with enduring individual differences among students. The fundamental challenge to teachers is to\nindividualize or differentiate instruction fully: to tailor it not only to the class as a group, but to the lasting\ndifferences among members of the class. One way to approach this sort of diversity, obviously, is to plan different\ncontent or activities for different students or groups of students. While one group works on Task A, another group\nworks on Task B; one group works on relatively easy math problems, for example, while another works on harder\nones. Differentiating instruction in this way complicates a teacher\u2019s job, but it can be done, and has in fact been\ndone by many teachers (it also makes teaching more interesting!). In the next chapter, we describe some classroom\nmanagement strategies that help with such multi-tasking.\nProviding moderate amounts of structure and detail\nChances are that at some point in your educational career you have wished that a teacher would clarify or\nexplain an assignment more fully, and perhaps give it a clearer structure or organization. Students\u2019 desire for clarity\nis especially common with assignments that are by nature open-ended, such as long essays, large projects, or\ncreative works. Simply being told to \u201cwrite an essay critiquing the novel\u201d, for example, leaves more room for\nuncertainty (and worry) than being given guidelines about what questions the essay should address, what topics or\nparts it should have, and what its length or style should be (Chesebro, 2003). As you might suspect, some students\ndesire clarity more than others, and improve their performance especially much when provided with plenty of\nstructure and clarity. Students with certain kinds of learning difficulties, in particular, often learn effectively and\nstay on task only if provided with somewhat explicit, detailed instructions about the tasks expected of them (Marks,\net al., 2003).\nEducational Psychology 144 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nAs a teacher, the challenge is to accommodate students\u2019 need for clarity without making guidance so specific or\ndetailed that students do little thinking for themselves. As a (ridiculously extreme) example, consider a teacher\ngives \u201cclear\u201d instructions for an essay by announcing not only exactly which articles to read and cite in the essay and\nwhich topics or issues to cover, but even requires specific wording of sentences in their essays. This much specificity\nmay reduce students\u2019 uncertainties and make the teacher\u2019s task of evaluating the essays relatively straightforward\nand easy. But it also reduces or even eliminates the educational value of the assignment\u2014assuming, of course, that\nits purpose is to get students to think for themselves.\nIdeally, then, structure should be moderate rather than extreme. There should be just enough to give students\nsome sense of direction and to stimulate more accomplishment than if they worked with less structure or guidance.\nThis ideal is an application of Vygotsky\u2019s idea of the zone of proximal development that we discussed in Chapter 2: a\nplace (figuratively speaking) where students get more done with help than without it. The ideal amount of guidance\n\u2014the \u201clocation\u201d of the zone of proximal development\u2014varies with the assignment and the student, and it\n(hopefully) decreases over time for all students. One student may need more guidance to do his or her best in math,\nbut less guidance in order to write her or his best essay. Another student may need the reverse. But if all goes well,\nboth students may need less at the end of the year than at the beginning.\nManaging transitions\nTransitions between activities is often full of distractions and \u201clost\u201d time, and is a time when inappropriate\nbehaviors are especially likely to occur. Part of the problem is intrinsic to transitions: students may have to wait\nbefore a new activity actually begins, and therefore get bored at the very moment when the teacher is preoccupied\nwith arranging materials for the new activity. From the point of view of the students, transitions may seem\nessentially like unsupervised group time, when seemingly any behavior is tolerated.\nMinimizing such problems requires two strategies, one of which is easier to implement than the other. The\neasier strategy is for you, as teacher, to organize materials as well as possible ahead of time, so that you minimize\nthe time needed to begin a new activity. The advice sounds simple, and mostly is, but it sometimes takes a bit of\npractice to implement smoothly. When one of us (Kelvin) first began teaching university, for example, particular\npapers or overhead transparencies sometimes got lost in the wrong folder in spite of Kelvin's efforts to keep them\nwhere they were easy to find. The resulting delays about finding them slowed the pace of class and caused\nfrustrations.\nA second, more complex strategy is to teach students ways to manage their own behavior during transitions\n(Marzano & Marzano, 2004). If students talk too loudly at these times, for example, then discuss with them what\nconstitutes appropriate levels or amounts of talk, and discuss the need for them to monitor their own sound level.\nOr if students stop work early in anticipation of ending an activity, then talk about\u2014or even practice\u2014waiting for a\nsignal from yourself to indicate the true ending point for an activity. If certain students continue working beyond\nthe end of an activity. On the other hand, try giving them warning of the impending end in advance, and remind\nthem about to take responsibility for actually finishing work once they hear the advance warning, and so on. The\npoint of these tactics is to encourage responsibility for behavior during transitions, and thereby reduce your own\nneed to monitor students at that crucial time.\n145 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nNone of these ideas, of course, mean that you, as teacher, should give up monitoring students\u2019 behavior entirely.\nChances are that you still will need to notice if and when someone talks too loudly, finishes too early, or continues\ntoo long, and you will still need to give some students appropriate reminders. But the amount of reminding will be\nless to the extent that students can remind and monitor themselves\u2014a welcome trend at any time, but especially\nduring transitions.\nMaintaining the flow of activities\nA lot of classroom management is really about keeping activities flowing smoothly, both during individual\nlessons and across the school day. The trouble is that there is never just \u201cone\u201d event happening at a time, even if\nonly one activity has been formally planned and is supposed to be occurring. Imagine, for example, that everyone is\nsupposed to be attending a single whole-class discussion on a topic; yet individual students will be having different\nexperiences at any one moment. Several students may be listening and contributing comments, for example, but a\nfew others may be planning what they want to say next and ignoring the current speakers, still others may be\nruminating about what a previous speaker said, and still others may be thinking about unrelated matters--the\nrestroom, food, or sex. Things get even more complicated if the teacher deliberately plans multiple activities: in that\ncase some students may interact with the teacher, for example, while others do work in an unsupervised group or\nwork independently in a different part of the room. How is a teacher to keep activities flowing smoothly in the face\nof such variety?\nA common mistake of beginning teachers in multi-faceted settings like these is to pay too much attention to any\none activity, student, or small group, at the expense of noticing and responding to all the others. If you are helping a\nstudent on one side of the room when someone on the other side disturbs classmates with off-task conversation, it\ncan be less effective either to finish with the student you are helping before attending to the disruption, or to\ninterrupt yourself to solve the disruption on the other side of the room. Although one of these responses may be\nnecessary, either one involves disruption somewhere. There is a risk that either the student\u2019s chatting may spread\nto others, or the interrupted student may become bored with waiting for the teacher\u2019s attention and wander off-task\nherself.\nA better solution, though one that at first may seem challenging, is to attend to both events at once\u2014a strategy\nthat was named withitness in a series of now-classic research studies several decades ago (Kounin, 1970).\nWithitness does not mean that you focus on all simultaneous activities with equal care, but only that you remain\naware of multiple activities, behaviors, and events to some degree. At a particular moment, for example, you may be\nfocusing on helping a student, but in some corner of your mind you also notice when chatting begins on the other\nside of the room. You have, as the saying goes, \u201ceyes in the back of your head\u201d. Research has found that experienced\nteachers are much more likely to show withitness than inexperienced teachers, and that these qualities are\nassociated with managing classrooms successfully (Emmer & Stough, 2001).\nSimultaneous awareness\u2014withitness\u2014makes possible responses to the multiple events that are immediate and\nnearly simultaneous\u2014what educators sometimes called overlapping. The teacher\u2019s responses to each event or\nbehavior need not take equal time, nor even be equally noticeable to all students. If you are helping one student\nwith seat work at the precise moment when another student begins chatting off-task, for example, a quick glance to\nthe second student may be enough to bring the second one back to the work at hand, and may scarcely interrupt\nEducational Psychology 146 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nyour conversation with the first student, or be noticed by others who are not even involved. The result is a smoother\nflow to activities overall.\nAs a new teacher, you may find that withitness and overlapping develop more easily in some situations than in\nothers. It may be easier to keep an eye (or ear) on multiple activities during familiar routines, such as taking\nattendance, but harder to do the same during activities that are unfamiliar or complex, such as introducing a new\ntopic or unit that you have never taught before. But skill at broadening your attention does increase with time and\npractice. It helps to keep trying. Merely demonstrating to students that you are \u201cwithit\u201d, in fact, even without\nmaking deliberate overlapping responses, can sometimes deter students from off-task behavior. Someone who is\ntempted to pass notes in class, for example, might not do so because she believes that you will probably notice her\ndoing it anyway, whether or not you are able to notice in fact.\nCommunicating the importance of learning and of positive behavior\nAltogether, the factors we have discussed\u2014arranging space, procedures, and rules, and developing withitness\u2014\nhelp communicate an important message: that in the classroom learning and positive social behavior are priorities.\nIn addition, teachers can convey this message by offering timely feedback to students about performance, by\nkeeping accurate records of the performance, and by deliberately communicating with parents or caregivers about\ntheir children and about class activities.\nCommunicating effectively is so important for all aspects of teaching, in fact, that we discuss it more fully later in\nthis book (see Chapter 8,\u201cThe nature of classroom communication\u201d). Here we focus on only one of its important\naspects: how communication contributes to a smoothly functioning classroom and in this way helps prevent\nbehavior problems.\nGiving timely feedback\nThe term feedback, when used by educators, refers to responses to students about their behavior or\nperformance. Feedback is essential if students are to learn and if they are to develop classroom behavior that is\nsocially skilled and \u201cmature\u201d. But feedback can only be fully effective if offered as soon as possible, when it is still\nrelevant to the task or activity at hand (Reynolds, 1992). A score on a test is more informative immediately after a\ntest than after a six-month delay, when students may have forgotten much of the content of the test. A teacher\u2019s\ncomment to a student about an inappropriate, off-task behavior may not be especially welcome at the moment the\nbehavior occurs, but it can be more influential and informative then; later, both teacher and student will have\ntrouble remembering the details of the off-task behavior, and in this sense may literally \u201cnot know what they are\ntalking about\u201d. The same is true for comments about a positive behavior by a student: hearing a compliment right\naway makes it easier to the comment with the behavior, and allows the compliment to influence the student more\nstrongly. There are of course practical limits to how fast feedback can be given, but the general principle is clear:\nfeedback tends to work better when it is timely.\nThe principle of timely feedback is consistent, incidentally, with a central principle of operant conditioning\ndiscussed in Chapter 2: reinforcement works best when it follows a to-be-learned operant behavior closely (Skinner,\n1957). In this case a teacher\u2019s feedback serves as a form of reinforcement. The analogy is easiest to understand when\nthe feedback takes the form of praise; in operant conditioning terms, the reinforcing praise then functions like a\n\u201creward\u201d. When feedback is negative, it functions as an \u201caversive stimulus\u201d (in operant terms), shutting down the\n147 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nbehavior criticized. At other times, though, criticism can also function as an unintended reinforcement. This\nhappens, for example, if a student experiences criticism as a reduction in isolation and therefore as in increase in\nhis importance in the class\u2014a relatively desirable change. So the inappropriate behavior continues, or even\nincreases, contrary to the teacher's intentions. Exhibit 9 diagrams this sequence of events.\nExample of Unintended Negative Reinforcement in the Classroom:\nStudent is isolated socially \u2192 Student publiclymisbehaves \u2192 Student gains others'\nattention\nReinforcement can happen in class if an undesirable behavior, leads to a less aversive state for a student.\nSocial isolation can be reduced by public misbehavior, which stimulates attention that is reinforcing.\nIronically, the effort to end misbehavior ends up stimulating the misbehavior.\nExhibit 9: Attracting attention as negative reinforcement\nMaintaining accurate records\nAlthough timeliness in responding to students can sometimes happen naturally during class, there are also\nsituations where promptness depends on having organized key information ahead of time. Obvious examples are\nthe scores, marks, and grades returned to students for their work. A short quiz (such as a weekly spelling test) may\nbe possible to return quite soon after the quiz\u2014sometimes you or even the students themselves can mark it during\nclass. More often, though, assignments and tests require longer processing times: you have to read, score, or add\ncomments to each paper individually. Excessive time to evaluate students' work can reduce the usefulness of a\nteacher\u2019s evaluations to students when she finally does return the work (Black, et al., 2004). During the days or\nweeks waiting for a test or assignment to be returned, students are left without information about the quality or\nnature of their performance; at the extreme they may even have to complete another test or do another assignment\nbefore getting information about an earlier one. (Perhaps you yourself have experienced this particular problem!)\nDelays in providing feedback about academic performance can never be eliminated entirely, but they can be\nreduced by keeping accurate, well-organized records of students\u2019 work. A number of computer programs are\navailable to help with this challenge; if your school does not already have one in use, then there are several\ndownloadable either free or at low cost from the Internet (e.g.\n<http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Educational/Teachers_Help/Gradebooks/>). Describing these is beyond\nthe scope of this book. For now we simply emphasize that grading systems benefit students\u2019 learning the most when\nthey provide feedback as quickly and frequently as possible (McMillan, 2001), precisely the reason why accurate,\nwell-organized record-keeping is important to keep.\nAccurate records are helpful not only for scores on tests, quizzes, or assignments, but also for developing\ndescriptive summaries of the nature of students\u2019 academic skills or progress. A common way to develop a\ndescription is the student portfolio, which is a compilation of the student\u2019s work and on-going assessments of it\ncreated by the teacher or in some cases by the student (Moritz & Christie, 2005; White, 2005). To know how a\nstudent\u2019s science project evolved from its beginning, for example, a teacher and student can keep a portfolio of lab\nnotes, logs, preliminary data, and the like. To know how a student\u2019s writing skills developed, they could keep a\nEducational Psychology 148 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nportfolio of early drafts on various writing assignments. As the work accumulates, the student can discuss it with\nthe teacher, and write brief reflections on its strengths thus far or on the steps needed to improve the work further.\nBy providing a way to respond to work as it evolves, and by including students in making the assessments,\nportfolios provide relatively prompt feedback, and in any case provide it sooner than by waiting for the teacher to\nreview work that is complete or final.\nCommunicating with parents and caregivers\nSince parents and caregivers in a sense \u201cdonate\u201d their children to schools (at least figuratively speaking),\nteachers are responsible for keeping them informed and involved to whatever extent is practical. Virtually all\nparents understand and assume that schools are generally intended for learning. Detailed communication can\nenrich parents' understanding, of how learning is addressed with their particular child\u2019s classroom, and show them\nmore precisely what their particular child is doing. The better such understanding in turn encourages parents and\ncaregivers to support their child\u2019s learning more confidently and \u201cintelligently\u201d. In this sense it contributes\nindirectly to a positive learning environment in their child\u2019s class.\nThere are various ways to communicate with parents, each with advantages and limitations. Here are three\ncommon examples:\n\u2022 A regular classroom newsletter: A newsletter establishes a link with parents or caregivers with\ncomparatively little effort on the part of the teacher. At the beginning of the year, for example, a newsletter\ncan tell about special materials that students will need, important dates to remember (like professional\ndevelopment days when there is no school), or about curriculum plans for the next few weeks. But\nnewsletters also have limitations. They can seem impersonal, and they may get lost on the way home and\nnever reach parents or caregivers. They can also be impractical for teachers with multiple classes, as in high\nschool or in specialist subjects (like music or physical education), where each class follows a different\nprogram or curriculum.\n\u2022 Telephone calls: The main advantage of phoning is its immediacy and individuality. Teacher and parent or\ncaregiver can talk about a particular student, behavior, or concern, and do it now. By the same token,\nhowever, phone calls are not an efficient way for informing parents about events or activities that affect\neveryone in common. The individuality of phoning may explain why teachers often use this method when a\nstudent has a problem that is urgent or unusual\u2014as when he has failed a test, missed classes, or\nmisbehaved seriously. Rightly or wrongly, a student\u2019s successes tend not to prompt phone calls to the\nstudent\u2019s home (though in fairness students may be more likely to tell parents about their successes\nthemselves, making it less essential for the teacher to do so).\n\u2022 Parent-teacher conferences: Most schools schedule periodic times\u2014often a day or evening per term\u2014when\nteachers meet briefly with parents or caregivers who wish to meet. Under good conditions, the conferences\nhave the individuality of phone calls, but also the richness of communication possible only in face-to-face\nmeetings. Since conferences are available to all parents, they need not focus on behavior or academic\nproblems, but often simply help to build rapport and understanding between parents or caregivers and the\nteacher. Sometimes too, particularly at younger grade levels, teachers involve students in leading their own\nconferences; the students display and explain their own work using a portfolio or other archive of\n149 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\naccumulated materials (Benson & Barnett, 2005; Stiggins & Chappuis, 2005). In spite of all of these\nadvantages, though, parent-teacher conferences have limitations. Some parents cannot get to conferences\nbecause of work schedules, child care, or transportation problems. Others may feel intimated by any school-\nsponsored event because they speak limited English or because they remember painful experiences from\ntheir own school days.\nEven if you make several efforts to communicate, some parents may remain out of contact. In these cases it is\nimportant to remember that the parents may not be indifferent to their child or to the value of education. Other\npossibilities exist, as some of our comments above imply: parents may have difficulties with child care, for example,\nhave inconvenient work schedules, or feel self-conscious about their own communication skills (Stevens &\nTollafield, 2003). Even so, there are ways to encourage parents who may be shy, hesitant, or busy. One is to think\nabout how they can assist the school even from home\u2014for example, by making materials to be used in class or (if\nthey are comfortable using English) phoning other parents about class events. A second way is to have a specific\ntask for the parents in mind\u2014one with clear structure, such as photocopying materials to be used by students later.\nA third is to remember to encourage, support, and respect the parents\u2019 presence and contributions when they do\nshow up at school functions. Keep in mind that parents are experts about their own particular children, and without\nthem, you would have no students to teach!\nResponding to student misbehavior\nSo far we have focused on preventing behaviors that are inappropriate or annoying. The advice has all been pro-\nactive or forward-looking: plan classroom space thoughtfully, create reasonable procedures and rules, pace lessons\nand activities appropriately, and communicate the importance of learning clearly. Although we consider these ideas\nimportant, it would be na\u00efve to imply they are enough to prevent all behavior problems. For various reasons,\nstudents sometimes still do things that disrupt other students or interrupt the flow of activities. At such moments\nthe challenge is not about long-term planning but about making appropriate, but prompt responses. Misbehaviors\nleft alone can be contagious, a process educators sometimes call the ripple effect (Kounin, 1970). Chatting\nbetween two students, for example, can gradually spread to six students; rudeness by one can eventually become\nrudeness by several; and so on. Because of this tendency, delaying a response to inappropriate behavior can make\nthe job of getting students back on track harder than responding to it as immediately as possible.\nThere are many ways to respond to inappropriate behaviors, of course, and they vary in how much they focus on\nthe immediate behavior compared to longer-term features or patterns of a student\u2019s behavior. There are so many\nways to respond, in fact, that we can describe only a sample of the possibilities here. None are effective all of the\ntime, though all do work at least some of the time. We start with a response that may not seem on the surface like a\nremedy at all\u2014simply ignoring misbehaviors.\nIgnoring misbehaviors\nA lot of misbehaviors are not important or frequent enough to deserve any response at all. They are likely to\ndisappear (or extinguish, in behaviorist terms) simply if left alone. If a student who is usually quiet during class\nhappens to whisper to a neighbor once in awhile, it is probably less disruptive and just as effective to ignore the\ninfraction than to respond to it. Some misbehaviors may not be worth a response even if they are frequent, as long\nas they do not seem to bother others. Suppose, for example, that a certain student has a habit of choosing quiet\nEducational Psychology 150 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nseat-work times to sharpen her pencil. She is continually out of her seat to go to the sharpener. Yet this behavior is\nnot really noticed by others. Is it then really a problem, however unnecessary or ill-timed it may be? In both\nexamples ignoring the behavior may be wise because there is little danger of the behavior disrupting other students\nor of becoming more frequent. Interrupting your activities\u2014or the students\u2019\u2014might cause more disruption than\nsimply ignoring the problem.\nThat said, there can still be problems in deciding whether a particular misbehavior is truly minor, infrequent, or\nunnoticed by others. Unlike in our example above, students may whisper to each other more than \u201crarely\u201d but less\nthan \u201coften\u201d: in that case, when do you decide that the whispering is in fact too frequent and needs a more active\nresponse from you? Or the student who sharpens her pencil, mentioned above, may not bother most others, but she\nmay nonetheless bother a few. In that case how many bothered classmates are \u201ctoo many\u201d? Five, three, just one,\nor\u2026? In these ambiguous cases, you may need more active ways of dealing with an inappropriate behavior, like the\nones described in the next sections.\nGesturing nonverbally\nSometimes it works to communicate using gestures, eye contact, or \u201cbody language\u201d that involve little or no\nspeaking. Nonverbal cues are often appropriate if a misbehavior is just a bit too serious or frequent to ignore, but\nnot serious or frequent enough to merit taking the time deliberately to speak to or talk with the student. If two\nstudents are chatting off-task for a relatively extended time, for example, sometimes a glance in their direction, a\nfrown, or even just moving closer to the students is enough of a reminder to get them back on task. Even if these\nresponses prove not to be enough, they may help to keep the off-task behavior from spreading to other students.\nA risk of relying on nonverbal cues, however, is that some students may not understand their meaning, or may\neven fail to notice them. If the two chatting students mentioned above are engrossed in their talking, for example,\nthey may not see you glance or frown at them. Or they might notice but not interpret your cue as a reminder to get\nback on task. Misinterpretation of nonverbal gestures and cues is more likely with young children, who are still\nlearning the subtleties of adults\u2019 nonverbal \u201clanguage\u201d (Guerrero & Floyd, 2005; Heimann, et al., 2006). It is also\nmore likely with students who speak limited English or whose cultural background differs significantly from your\nown. These students may have learned different nonverbal gestures from your own as part of their participation in\ntheir original culture (Marsh, Elfenbein, & Ambady, 2003).\nNatural and logical consequences\nConsequences are the outcomes or results of an action. When managing a classroom, two kinds of consequences\nare especially effective for influencing students' behavior: natural consequences and logical consequences. As the\nterm implies, natural consequences happen \u201cnaturally\u201d, without deliberate intention by anyone. If a student is\nlate for class, for example, a natural consequence is that he misses information or material that needed to do an\nassignment. Logical consequences are ones that happen because of the responses of or decisions by others, but\nthat also have an obvious or \u201clogical\u201d relationship to the original action. If one student steals another\u2019s lunch, for\nexample, a logical consequence might be for the thief to reimburse the victim for the cost of the lunch. Natural and\nlogical consequences are often woven together and thus hard to distinguish: if one student picks a fight with\nanother student, a natural consequence might be injury not only to the victim, but also to the aggressor (an\n151 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ninherent byproduct of fighting), but a logical consequence might be to lose friends (the response of others to\nfighting). In practice both may occur.\nIn general research has found that both natural and logical consequences can be effective for minimizing\nundesirable behaviors, provided they are applied in appropriate situations (Weinstein, Tomlinson-Clarke, &\nCurran, 2004). Consider a student who runs impulsively down school hallways. The student is likely to have \u201ctraffic\naccidents\u201d, and thus (hopefully) to see that running is not safe and to reduce the frequency of running. Or consider\na student who chronically talks during class instead of working on an assigned task. The student may have to make\nup the assignment later, possibly as homework. Because the behavior and the consequence are connected logically,\nthe student is relatively likely to see the drawback of choosing to talk, and to reduce how much he or she talks on\nsubsequent occasions. In either case, whether natural or logical, the key features that make consequences work are\n(a) that they are appropriate to the misbehavior and (b) that the student understands the connection between the\nconsequences and the original behavior.\nNotice, though, that natural and logical consequences do not always work; if they did, there would be no further\nneed for management strategies! One limitation is that misbehaviors can sometimes be so serious that no natural or\nlogical consequence seems sufficient or appropriate. Suppose, for example, that one student deliberately breaks\nanother student\u2019s eyeglasses. There may be a natural consequence for the victim (he or she will not be able to see\neasily), but not for the student who broke the glasses. There may also be no consequences for the aggressor that are\nboth logical and fully satisfactory: the aggressor student will not be able to repair the broken glasses himself, and\nmay not be able to pay for new glasses either.\nAnother limitation of natural and logical consequences is that their success depends on the motives of the\nmisbehaving student. If the student is seeking attention or acceptance by others, then consequences often work\nwell. Bullying in order to impress others, for example, is more likely to lose friends than to win them\u2014so bullying\nmotivated in this way is self-limiting. If a student is seeking power over others, on the other hand, then the\nconsequences of bullying may not reduce the behavior. Bullying in order to control others\u2019 actions by definition\nactually achieves its own goal, and its \u201cnatural\u201d result (losing friends) would be irrelevant. Of course, a bully might\nalso act from a combination of motives, so that natural and logical consequences limit bullying behavior, but only\npartially.\nA third problem with natural and logical consequences is that they can easily be confused with deliberate\npunishment (Kohn, 2006). The difference is important. Consequences are focused on repairing damage and\nrestoring relationships, and in this sense they focus on the future. Punishments highlight a mistake or wrongdoing\nand in this sense focus on the past. Consequences tend to be more solution focused. Punishments tend to highlight\nthe person who committed the action, and they often shame or humiliate the wrong doer. (Table 17 summarizes\nthese and other differences.)\nTable 17: Differences between consequences and punishments\nFocused on future solutions Focused on past mistakes\nFocused on individual\u2019s actions Focused on character of student or child\nFocused on repairing mistakes Focused on establishing blame\nEducational Psychology 152 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nFocused on restoring positive relationships Focused on isolating wrong-doer\nTend to reduce emotional pain and conflict Tend to impose emotional pain or conflict\nClassroom examples of the differences between consequences and punishment are plentiful. If a student fails to\nlisten to the teacher's instructions, then a consequence is that he or she misses important information, but a\npunishment may be that the teacher criticizes or reprimands the student. If a student speaks rudely to the teacher, a\nconsequence may be that the teacher does not respond to the comment, or simply reminds the student to speak\ncourteously. A punishment may be that the teacher scolds the student in the presence of others , or even imposes a\ndetention (\u201cStay after school for 15 minutes\u201d).\nConflict resolution and problem solving\nWhen a student misbehaves persistently and disruptively, you will need strategies that are more active and\nassertive than the ones discussed so far, and that focus on conflict resolution\u2014the reduction of disagreements\nthat persist over time. Conflict resolution strategies that educators and teachers tend to use usually have two parts\n(Jones, 2004). First, they involve ways of identifying what \u201cthe\u201d problem is precisely. Second, they remind the\nstudent of classroom expectations and rules with simple clarity and assertiveness, but without apology or\nharshness. When used together, the two strategies not only reduce conflicts between a teacher and an individual\nstudent, but also provide a model for other students to follow when they have disagreements of their own. The next\nsections discuss the nature of assertion and clarification for conflict resolution in more detail.\nStep 1: clarifying and focusing: problem ownership\nClassrooms can be emotional places even though their primary purpose is to promote thinking rather than\nexpression of feelings. The emotions can be quite desirable: they can give teachers and students \u201cpassion\u201d for\nlearning and a sense of care among members of the class. But feelings can also cause trouble if students misbehave:\nat those moments negative feelings\u2014annoyance, anger, discomfort\u2014can interfere with understanding exactly what\nis wrong and how to set things right again. Gaining a bit of distance from the negative feelings is exactly what those\nmoments need, especially on the part of the teacher, the person with (presumably) the greatest maturity.\nIn a widely cited approach to conflict resolution called Teacher Effectiveness Training, the educator Thomas\nGordon describes this challenge as an issue of problem ownership, or deciding whose problem a behavior or\nconflict it really is (Gordon, 2003). The \u201cowner\u201d of the problem is the primary person who is troubled or bothered\nby it. The owner can be the student committing the behavior, the teacher, or another student who merely happens\nto see the behavior. Since the owner of a problem needs to take primary responsibility for solving it, identifying\nownership makes a difference in how to deal with the behavior or problem effectively.\nSuppose, for example, that a student named David makes a remark that the teacher finds offensive (like \u201cSean is\nfat\u201d). Is this remark the student's problem or the teacher's? If David made the comment privately to the teacher and\nis unlikely to repeat it, then maybe it is only the teacher's problem. If he is likely to repeat it to other students or to\nSean himself, however, then maybe the problem is really David's. On the other hand, suppose that a different\nstudent, Sarah, complains repeatedly that classmates refuse to let her into group projects. This is less likely to be\n153 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthe teacher\u2019s problem rather than Sarah's: her difficulty may affect her ability to do her own work, but not really\naffect the teacher or classmates directly. As you might suspect, too, a problem may sometimes affect several people\nat once. David, who criticized Sean, may discover that he offended not only the teacher, but also classmates, who\ntherefore avoid working with him. At that point the whole class begins to share in some aspect of \u201cthe\u201d problem: not\nonly is David prevented from working with others comfortably, but also classmates and the teacher begin dealing\nwith bad feelings about David.\nStep 2: active, empathetic listening\nDiagnosing accurately who really has a problem with a behavior\u2014who \u201cowns\u201d it\u2014is helped by a number of\nstrategies. One is active listening\u2014attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting to\nunderstand or empathize as fully as possible, even if you do not agree with what is being said (Cooper & Simonds,\n2003). Active listening involves asking questions in order continually to check your understanding. It also involves\nencouraging the student to elaborate on his or her remarks, and paraphrasing and summarizing what the student\nsays in order to check your perceptions of what is said. It is important not to move too fast toward solving the\nproblem with advice, instructions, or scolding, even if these are responses that you might, as a teacher, feel\nresponsible for making. Responding too soon with solutions can shut down communication prematurely, and leave\nyou with inaccurate impressions of the source or nature of the problem.\nStep 3: assertive discipline and I-messages\nOnce you have listened well to the student\u2019s point of view, it helps to frame your responses and comments in\nterms of how the student\u2019s behavior affects you in particular, especially in your role as the teacher. The comments\nshould have several features:\n\u2022 They should be assertive\u2014neither passive and apologetic, nor unnecessarily hostile and aggressive (Cantor,\n1996). State the problem as matter-of-factly as possible: \u201cJoe, you are talking while I\u2019m explaining\nsomething\u201d, instead of either \u201cJoe, do you think you could be quiet now?\u201d or \u201cJoe, be quiet!\u201d\n\u2022 The comments should emphasize I-messages (Gordon, 1981), which are comments that focus on how the\nproblem behavior is affecting the teacher\u2019s ability to teach, as well as how the behavior makes the teacher\nfeel. They are distinct from you-messages, which focus on evaluating the mistake or problem which the\nstudent has created. An I-message might be, \u201cYour talking is making it hard for me to remember what I\u2019m\ntrying to say.\u201d A you-message might be, \u201cYour talking is rude.\u201d\n\u2022 The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others\u2014a\nstrategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs,\n2003). Instead of simply saying: \u201cWhen you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them\u201d,\nyou can try saying, \u201cHow do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?\u201d\nStep 4: negotiation\nThe first three steps describe ways of interacting that are desirable, but also fairly specific in scope and limited in\nduration. But in themselves, they may not be enough when conflict persists over time and develops a number of\ncomplications or confusing features. A student may persist in being late for class, for example, in spite of efforts by\nthe teacher to modify this behavior. Or two students may repeatedly speak rudely to each other, even though the\nteacher has mediated this conflict in the past. Or a student may fail to complete homework, time after time. Because\nEducational Psychology 154 A Global Text 7. Classroom management and the learning environment\nthese problems develop over time, and because they may involve repeated disagreements, they can eventually\nbecome stressful for the teacher, the student, and any classmates who may be affected. Their persistence can tempt\na teacher simply to dictate a resolution\u2014a decision that can leave everyone feeling defeated, including the teacher.\nOften in these situations it is better to negotiate a solution, which means systematically discussing options and\ncompromising on one if possible. Although negotiation always requires time and effort, it is often less time or effort\nthan continuing to cope with the original problem, and the results can be beneficial to everyone. A number of\nexperts on conflict resolution have suggested strategies for negotiating with students about persistent problems\n(Davidson & Wood, 2004). The suggestions vary in detail, but usually include some combination of the steps we\nhave already discussed above, along with a few others:\n\u2022 Decide as accurately as possible what the problem is. Usually this step involves a lot of the active listening\ndescribed above.\n\u2022 Brainstorm possible solutions, and then consider their effectiveness. Remember to include students in\nthis step; otherwise you end up simply imposing a solution on others, which is not what negotiation is\nsupposed to achieve.\n\u2022 If possible, choose a solution by consensus. Complete agreement on the choice may not be possible, but\nstrive for it as best you can. Remember that taking a vote may be a democratic, acceptable way to settle\ndifferences in some situations, but if feelings are running high, voting does not work as well. In that case\nvoting may simply allow the majority to impose its will on the minority, leaving the underlying conflict\nunresolved.\n\u2022 Pay attention to how well the solution works after it is underway. For many reasons, things may not work\nout the way you or students hope or expect. You may need to renegotiate the solution at a later time.\nKeeping management issues in perspective\nThere are two primary messages from this chapter. One is that management issues are important, complex, and\ndeserving of serious attention. The other is that strategies exist that can reduce, if not eliminate, management\nproblems when and if they occur. We have explained some of those strategies\u2014including some intended to prevent\nproblems and others intended to remedy problems.\nBut there is an underlying assumption about management that this chapter emphasized fully: that good\nclassroom management is not an end in itself, but a means for creating a classroom where learning happens and\nstudents are motivated. Amidst the stresses of handling a problem behavior, there is a risk of losing sight of this\nidea. Telling a student to be quiet is never a goal in itself, for example; it is desirable only because (or when) it\nallows all students to hear the teacher\u2019s instructions or classmates\u2019 spoken comments, or because it allows students\nto concentrate on their work. There may actually be moments when students' keeping quiet is not appropriate, such\nas during a \u201cfree choice\u201d time in an elementary classroom or during a group work task in a middle school\nclassroom. As teachers, we need to keep this perspective firmly in mind. Classroom management should serve\nstudents\u2019 learning, and not the other way around. The next chapter is based on this idea, because it discusses ways\nnot just to set the stage for learning, as this chapter has done, but ways to plan directly for students' learning.\n155 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nChapter summary\nClassroom management is the coordination of lessons and activities to make learning as productive as possible.\nIt is important because classrooms are complex and somewhat unpredictable, because students respond to\nteachers\u2019 actions in diverse ways, and because society requires that students attend school. There are two major\nfeatures of management: preventing problems before they occur and responding to them after they occur. Many\nmanagement problems can be prevented by attending to how classroom space is used, by establishing daily\nprocedures, routines, and rules, by pacing and structuring activities appropriately, and by communicating the\nimportance of learning and of positive behavior to students and parents. There are several ways of dealing with a\nmanagement problem after it occurs, and the choice depends on the nature of the problem. A teacher can simply\nignore a misbehavior, gesture or cue students nonverbally, rely on natural and logical consequences, or engage\nconflict resolution strategies. Whatever tactics the teacher uses, it is important to keep in mind their ultimate\npurpose: to make learning possible and effective.\nOn the Internet\n<www.theteachersguide.com/ClassManagement.htm> This is part of a larger website for teachers\ncontaining resources of all kinds.

The nature of classroom\ncommunication\n\u201cBe sincere; be brief; be seated.\u201d\n(Franklin Delano Roosevelt)\nFranklin Roosevelt was a former president of the United States, and he advised being brief and sincere when\ncommunicating. In advising to be seated, he was being somewhat more indirect; perhaps he was suggesting that\nconversation and dialog would be improved by reducing the power differences between individuals. If so, he was\ngiving good advice, though perhaps it was also a bit misleading in its simplicity. As teachers, we face almost\ncontinual talk at school, supplemented by ample amounts of nonverbal communication\u2014gestures, facial\nexpressions, and other \u201cbody language\u201d. Often the talk involves many people at once, or even an entire class, and\nindividuals have to take turns speaking while also listening to others having their turns, or sometimes ignoring the\nothers if a conversation does not concern them. As the teacher, therefore, you find yourself playing an assortment of\nroles when communicating in classrooms: Master of Ceremonies, referee\u2014and of course source of new knowledge.\nYour challenge is to sort the roles out so that you are playing the right ones in the right combinations at the right\ntimes. As you learn to do this, interestingly, much of your communication with students will indeed acquire the\nqualities recommended by Franklin Roosevelt. Often, you will indeed be more sincere and brief, and you will find\nthat minimizing power differences between you and students is a good idea.\nIn this chapter we look at how you might begin to move toward these goals. We describe briefly several major\nfeatures of classroom communication that distinguish it from communication in other familiar situations. Then we\nexplain several techniques, both verbal and nonverbal, that contribute to effective communication, and describe\nhow these manifest themselves in several common activity settings, which we call structures of participation. As\nyou will see, how an activity is organized\u2014its structure of participation\u2014has a major effect on how students\ncommunicate with each other and with the teacher.\nCommunication in classrooms vs communication elsewhere\nClassroom events are often so complex that just talking with students can become confusing. It helps to think of\nthe challenge as a problem in communication\u2014or as one expert put it, of \u201cwho says what to whom, and with\nwhat effect\u201d (Lasswell, 1964). In classrooms, things often do not happen at an even pace or in a logical order, or\nwith just the teacher and one student interacting while others listen or wait patiently. While such moments do\noccur, events may sometimes instead be more like a kaleidoscope of overlapping interactions, disruptions, and\ndecision\u2014even when activities are generally going well. One student finishes a task while another is still only half-\nway done. A third student looks like she is reading, but she may really be dreaming. You begin to bring her back on\ntask by speaking to her, only to be interrupted by a fourth student with a question about an assignment. While you\nanswer the fourth student, a fifth walks in with a message from the office requiring a response; so the bored (third)\nEducational Psychology 159 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nstudent is overlooked awhile longer. Meanwhile, the first student\u2014the one who finished the current task\u2014now\nbegins telling a joke to a sixth student, just to pass the time. You wonder, \u201cShould I speak now to the bored, quiet\nreader or to the joke-telling student? Or should I move on with the lesson?\u201d While you are wondering this, a\nseventh student raises his hand with a question, and so on.\nOne way to manage situations like these is to understand and become comfortable with the key features of\ncommunication that are characteristic of classrooms. One set of features has to do with the functions or purposes of\ncommunication, especially the balance among talk related to content, to procedures, and to controlling behavior.\nAnother feature has to do with the nature of nonverbal communication\u2014how it supplements and sometimes even\ncontradicts what is said verbally. A third feature has to do with the unwritten expectations held by students and\nteachers about how to participate in particular kinds of class activities\u2014what we will later call the structure of\nparticipation.\nFunctions of talk: content, procedures, and behavior control\nClassrooms are different from many other group situations in that communication serves a unique combination\nof three purposes at once: content, procedures, or behavior control (Wells, 2006). Content talk focuses on what is\nbeing learned; it happens when a teacher or student states or asks about an idea or concept, for example, or when\nsomeone explains or elaborates on some bit of new knowledge (Burns & Myhill, 2004). Usually content talk relates\nin some obvious way to the curriculum or to current learning objectives, as when a teacher tells a high school\nhistory class, \u201cAs the text explains, there were several major causes of the American Civil War.\u201d But content talk can\nalso digress from the current learning objectives; a first-grade student might unexpectedly bring a caterpillar to\nschool and ask about how it transforms into a butterfly.\nProcedural talk, as its name implies, is about administrative rules or routines needed to accomplish tasks in a\nclassroom. It happens, for example, when the teacher says, \u201cWhen you are done with your spelling books, put them\nin the bins at the side of the room\u201d, or when a student asks, \u201cDo you want us to print our names at the top of page?\u201d\nProcedural talk provides information that students need to coordinate their activities in what can be a relatively\ncrowded space\u2014the classroom\u2014and under conditions in which time may be relatively short or tightly scheduled. It\ngenerally keeps activities organized and flowing smoothly. Procedural talk is not primarily about removing or\ncorrecting unwanted behavior, although certain administrative procedures might sometimes annoy a particular\nstudent, or students might sometimes forget to follow a procedure. Instead it is intended to provide the guidance\nthat students need to coordinate with each other and with the teacher.\nControl talk is about preventing or correcting misbehaviors when they occur, particularly when the\nmisbehaviors are not because of ignorance of procedures. It happens, for example, when a teacher says, \u201cJill, you\nwere talking when you should have been listening\u201d, or \u201cJason, you need to work on your math instead of doodling.\u201d\nMost control talk originates with the teacher, but students sometimes engage in it with each other, if not with the\nteacher. One student may look at a nearby classmate who is whispering out of turn and quietly say, \u201cShhh!\u201d in an\nattempt to silence the behavior. Or a student may respond to being teased by a classmate by saying simply, \u201cStop\nit!\u201d Whether originating from the teacher or a student, control talk may not always be fully effective. But its purpose\nis, by definition, to influence or control inappropriate behavior. Since control talk is obviously important for\nmanaging class effectively, we discussed it at length in Chapter 7.\n160 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nWhat can make classroom discourse confusing is that two of its functions\u2014content and procedures\u2014often\nbecome combined with the third, control talk, in the same remark or interaction. A teacher may ask a content-\nrelated question, for example, as a form of control talk. She may, for example, ask, \u201cJeremy, what did you think of\nthe film we just saw?\u201d The question is apparently about content, but the teacher may also be trying to end Jeremy\u2019s\ndaydreaming and to get him back on task\u2014an example of control talk. Or a teacher may state a rule: \u201cWhen one\nperson is talking, others need to be listening.\u201d The rule is procedural in that it helps to coordinate classroom\ndialogue, but it may also control inattentive behavior. Double functions like these can sometimes confuse students\nbecause of their ambiguity, and lead to misunderstandings between certain students and teachers. A student may\nhear only the content or procedural function of a teacher\u2019s comment, and miss an implied request or command to\nchange inappropriate behavior (Collins & Michaels, 2006). But double functions can also help lessons to flow\nsmoothly by minimizing the disruption of attending to a minor behavior problem and by allowing more continuous\nattention to content or procedures.\nVerbal, nonverbal, and unintended communication\nAnother way to understand classroom communication is to distinguish verbal from nonverbal communication,\nand intended both unintended forms of communication. As the name suggests, verbal communication is a\nmessage or information expressed in words, either orally or in writing. Classrooms obviously have lots of verbal\ncommunication; it happens every time a teacher explains a bit of content, asks a question, or writes information or\ninstructions on the chalkboard. Non-verbal communications are gestures or behaviors that convey\ninformation, often simultaneously with spoken words (Guerrero, 2006). It happens, for example, when a teacher\nlooks directly at students to emphasize a point or to assert her authority, or when the teacher raises her eyebrows to\nconvey disapproval or disagreement. Nonverbal behaviors are just as plentiful as verbal communications, and while\nthey usually add to a current verbal message, they sometimes can also contradict it. A teacher can state verbally,\n\u201cThis math lesson will be fun\u201d, and a nonverbal twinkle in the eye can send the confirm message nonverbally. But a\nsimultaneous nonverbal sigh or slouch may send the opposite message\u2014that the lesson will not, in fact be fun, in\nspite of the teacher\u2019s verbal claim.\nWhether verbal or nonverbal, however, classroom communications often convey more meaning than is\nintended. Unintended communications are the excess meanings of utterances; they are the messages received\nby students without the teacher\u2019s awareness or desire. A teacher may say, \u201cThis section of the text won\u2019t be on the\ntest, but read it anyway for background.\u201d But a student may instead hear the message, \u201cDo not read this section of\nthe text.\u201d What is heard is not what the teacher intended to be heard.\nLike many public settings that involve a diversity of people, classrooms tend to rely heavily on explicit, verbal\ncommunication, while at the same time recognizing and allowing nonverbal communications to occur (Neill, 1991).\nThis priority accounts for the characteristically businesslike style of teacher talk\u2014a style that we discuss in detail in\nthe next chapter. A major reason for relying on an explicit, businesslike verbal style is that diversity among\nindividuals increases the chances of their misinterpreting each other. Because of differences in background, the\npartners may differ in how they expect to structure conversation as well as other kinds of dialog.\nMisunderstandings may result\u2014sometimes without the partners being able to pinpoint the cause. Later in this\nchapter we suggest how to minimize these problems.\nEducational Psychology 161 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nEffective verbal communication\nCommunicating effectively requires using all forms of classroom talk in combinations appropriate for particular\nutterances and interactions. In various places earlier in this book, we have suggested ways of doing so, though in\nthose places we usually did not frame the discussion around the term communication as such.\nEffective content talk\nIn Chapter 8, for example, we suggested ways of talking about content so that it is most likely to be understood\nclearly, but in that chapter we described these as instructional strategies. In explaining ideas, for example, whether\nbriefly or as a extended lecture, we pointed out that it helps to offer, in advance, organizing ideas, to relate new\ncontent to prior knowledge, and to organize and elaborate on new information. In the same chapter, we also\nsuggested strategies about content talk intended for students, so that students understand their own thinking as\nwell as possible. We especially highlighted two ways of learning: inquiry learning and cooperative learning. Table\n18summarizes instructional strategies both for students and for teachers, and indicates how they contribute to\neffective verbal communication about content.\nTable 18: Strategies for supporting content talk\nContent talk by teachers\nStrategy Definition How it helps communication\nUsing advance organizers Statements or ideas that give a Orients students\u2019 attention to\nconcise overview of new material new ideas about to be learned;\nassists in understanding and\nremembering new material\nRelating new material to prior Explicit connections of new ideas Facilitates discussion of new\nknowledge to students\u2019 existing knowledge material by making it more\nmeaningful to students\nElaborating and extending new Explanations of new ideas in full, Avoids ambiguities and\ninformation complete terms misunderstandings about new ideas\nor concepts\nOrganizing new information Providing and following a clear Assists in understanding and\nstructure when explaining new remembering new material\nmaterial\nContent talk by students\nInquiry learning Students pursue problems that To formulate and and investigate\nthey help to formulate for a problem, students need to express\nthemselves clearly what they wish to find out.\nCooperative learning Students work in small groups to To work together, students need\n162 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nsolve a common problem or task to explain ideas and questions to\nfellow students clearly.\nTable 19: Major strategies of effective procedural and control talk\nThese strategies are also discussed in Chapter 7 as features of classroom management, rather than of\ncommunication. Note, too, that the difference between procedural and content talk is arbitrary to some extent; in\nmany situations one kind of talk serves the needs of the other kind.\nStrategy for procedural talk Strategy for control talk\nCreating and discussing procedures for daily routines Creating and discussing classroom rules of\nappropriate behavior\nAnnouncing transitions between activities Clarifying problem ownership\nProviding clear instructions and guidance for Listening actively and empathetically\nactivities\nReminding students periodically of procedures for Using I-messages\ncompleting a task\nEffective procedural and control talk\nIn addition to communicating about content, teachers need to communicate procedures and expectations about\nappropriate classroom behavior. In Chapter 7 we described quite a few ways to communicate with students about\nthese matters, though, in that chapter we did not refer to them as methods of communication, but as methods of\nclassroom management, of creating a positive learning environment, and of resolving conflicts in the class. Table 19\nsummarizes several of the major strategies described in that chapter.) By framing communication in these ways, we\ncalled attention to their importance as forms of communication. As we pointed out, procedural talk and control talk\nmatter are used in teaching simply because clear procedures and appropriate classroom behavior are necessary\nstudents are to learn.\nEffective nonverbal communication\nIn spite of their importance, words are not the only way that teachers and students communicate. Gestures and\nbehaviors convey information as well, often supporting a teacher\u2019s words, but sometimes also contradicting them.\nStudents and teachers express themselves nonverbally in all conversations, so freely and automatically in fact that\nthis form of communication can easily be overlooked.\nEye contact\nOne important nonverbal behavior is eye contact, which is the extent and timing of when a speaker looks\ndirectly at the eyes of the listener. In conversations between friends of equal status, for example, most native\nspeakers of English tend to look directly at the speaker when listening, but to avert their gaze when speaking\n(Kleinke, 1986). Re-engaging eye contact, in fact, often signals that a speaker is about to finish a turn and is inviting\na response from the listener.\nEducational Psychology 163 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nBut conversations follow different rules if they involve someone of greater authority talking with someone of\nlesser authority, such as between a teacher and a student. In that case, the person in authority signals greater status\nby gazing directly at the listener almost continuously, whether listening or speaking. This alternate pattern can\nsometimes prove awkward if either party is not expecting it. For students unused to continuous eye contact, it can\nfeel like the teacher is staring excessively, intrusively, or inappropriately; an ironic effect can be for the student to\nfeel more self-conscious rather than more engaged, as intended. For similar reasons, inexperienced or first-time\nteachers can also feel uncomfortable with gazing at students continuously. Nevertheless research about the effects\nof eye contact suggests that it may help anyone, whether a student or teacher, to remember what they are seeing\nand hearing (Mason, Hood, & Macrae, 2004).\nCommunication problems result less from eye contact as such than from differences in expectations about eye\ncontact. If students\u2019 expectations differ very much from the teacher\u2019s, one party may misinterpret the other party\u2019s\nmotivations. Among some non-white ethnic groups, for example, eye contact follows a pattern that reverses the\nconventional white, English-language pattern: they tend to look more intently at a partner when talking, and avert\ngaze when listening (Razack, 1998). The alternative pattern works perfectly well as long as both parties expect it\nand use it. As you might imagine, though, there are problems if the two partners use opposite patterns of eye\ncontact. In that case one person may interpret a direct gaze as an invitation to start talking, when really it is an\ninvitation to stop talking. Eventually the conversational partner may find himself interrupting too much, or simply\ntalking too long at a turn. The converse can also happen: if the first person looks away, the partner may take the\ngesture as inviting the partner to keep listening, when really the first person is inviting the partner to start talking.\nAwkward gaps between comments may result. In either case, if the conversational partners are a teacher and\nstudent, rapport may deteriorate gradually. In the first case, the teacher may even conclude, wrongly, that the\nstudent is socially inept because the student interrupts so much. In the second case, the teacher may conclude\u2014also\nwrongly\u2014that the student is very shy or even lacking in language skill.\nTo avoid such misunderstandings, a teacher needs to note and remember students\u2019 preferred gaze patterns at\ntimes when students are free to look wherever and at whomever they please. Traditional seats-in-a-row desk\narrangements do not work well for this purpose; as you might suppose, and as research confirms, sitting in rows\nmakes students more likely to look either at the teacher or to look at nothing in particular (Rosenfeld, Lambert, &\nBlack, 1985; Razack, 1998). Almost any other seating arrangement, such as sitting in clusters or in a circle,\nencourages freer patterns of eye contact. More comfortable eye contact, in turn, makes for verbal communication\nthat is more comfortable and productive.\nWait time\nAnother important nonverbal behavior is wait time, which is the pause between conversational turns. Wait\ntime marks when a conversational turn begins or ends. If a teacher asks a question, for example, the wait time both\nallows and prompts students to formulate an appropriate response. Studies on classroom interaction generally\nshow that wait times in most classes are remarkably short\u2014less than one second (Good & Brophy, 2002).\nUnfortunately wait times this short can actually interfere with most students\u2019 thinking; in one second, most\nstudents either cannot decide what to say or can only recall a simple, automatic fact (Tobin, 1987). Increasing wait\ntimes to several seconds has several desirable effects: students give longer, more elaborate responses, they express\nmore complex ideas, and a wider range of students participate in discussion. For many teachers, however, learning\n164 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nto increase wait time this much takes conscious effort, and may feel uncomfortable at first. (A trick, if you are trying\nto wait longer, is to count silently to five before calling on anyone.) After a few weeks of practice, discomfort with\nlonger wait times usually subsides, and the academic benefits of waiting become more evident.\nAs with eye contact, preferred wait times vary both among individuals and among groups of students, and the\ndifferences in expected wait times can sometimes lead to awkward conversations. Though there are many\nexceptions, girls tend to prefer longer wait times than boys\u2014perhaps contributing to an impression that girls are\nunnecessarily shy or that boys are self-centered or impulsive. Students from some ethnic and cultural groups tend\nto prefer a much longer wait time than is typically available in a classroom, especially when English is the student\u2019s\nsecond language (Toth, 2004). When a teacher converses with a member of such a group, therefore, what feels to\nthe student like a respectful pause may seem like hesitation or resistance to the teacher. Yet other cultural groups\nactually prefer overlapping comments\u2014a sort of negative wait time. In these situations, one conversational partner\nwill begin at exactly the same instant as the previous speaker, or even before the speaker has finished (Chami-\nSather & Kretschmer, 2005). The negative wait time is meant to signal lively interest in the conversation. A teacher\nwho is used to a one-second gap between comments, however, may regard overlapping comments as rude\ninterruptions, and may also have trouble getting chances to speak.\nEven though longer wait times are often preferable, they do not always work well with certain individuals or\ngroups. For teachers, the most widely useful advice is to match wait time to the students\u2019 preferences as closely as\npossible, regardless of whether these are slower or faster than what the teacher normally prefers. To the extent that\na teacher and students can match each other\u2019s pace, they will communicate more comfortably and fully, and a larger\nproportion of students will participate in discussions and activities. As with eye contact, observing students\u2019\npreferred wait times is easier in situations that give students some degree of freedom about when and how to\nparticipate, such as open-ended discussions or informal conversations throughout the day.\nSocial distance\nWhen two people interact, the physical space or distance between them\u2014their social distance\u2014often indicates\nsomething about how intimate or personal their relationship is (Noller, 2006). Social distance also affects how\npeople describe others and their actions; someone who habitually is more distant physically is apt to be described in\nmore general, abstract terms than someone who often approaches more closely (Fujita, et al., 2006). In white\nAmerican society, a distance of approximately half a meter to a meter is what most people prefer when talking face-\nto-face with a personal friend. The closer end of this range is more common if the individuals turn sideways to each\nother, as when riding on an elevator; but usually the closest distances are reserved for truly intimate friendships,\nsuch as between spouses. If the relationship is more businesslike, individuals are more likely to situate themselves\nin the range of approximately one meter to a three meters. This is a common distance, for example, for a teacher\ntalking with a student or talking with a small group of students. For still more formal interactions, individuals tend\nto allow more than three meters; this distance is typical, for example, when a teacher speaks to an entire class.\nJust as with eye contact and wait time, however, individuals differ in the distances they prefer for these different\nlevels of intimacy, and complications happen if two people expect different distances for the same kind of\nrelationship. A student who prefers a shorter social distance than her partner can seem pushy or overly familiar to\nthe partner. The latter, in turn, can seem aloof or unfriendly\u2014literally \u201cdistant\u201d. The sources of these effects are\nEducational Psychology 165 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\neasy to overlook since by definition the partners never discuss social distance verbally, but they are real. The best\nremedy, again, is for teachers to observe students\u2019 naturally occurring preferences as closely as possible, and to\nrespect them as much as possible: students who need to be closer should be allowed to be closer, at least within\nreasonable limits, and those who need to be more distant should be allowed to be more distant.\nStructures of participation: effects on communication\nMany class activities take on patterns that guide communication in ways that class members learn to expect,\noften without even being reminded. Each pattern is a participation structure, a set of rights and responsibilities\nexpected from students and teacher during an activity. Sometimes the teacher announces or explains the rights and\nresponsibilities explicitly, though often they are just implied by the actions of class members, and individual\nstudents learn them simply by watching others. A lecture, for example, has a particular participation structure:\nstudents are responsible for listening, for raising a hand to speak, and for keeping comments brief and relevant if\ncalled on. The teacher, on the other hand, has the right to talk at length, but also the responsibility to keep the talk\nrelevant and comprehensible.\nIn principle, a host of participation structures are possible, but just a handful account for most class activities\n(Cazden, 2001). Here are some of the most common:\n\u2022 Lecturing\u2014the teacher talks and students listen. Maybe students take notes, but maybe not.\n\u2022 Questions and answers\u2014the teacher asks a series of questions, calling on one student at a time to answer\neach of them. Students raise their hands to be recognized and give answers that are brief and \u201ccorrect\u201d. In\nearlier times this participation structure was sometimes called recitation.\n\u2022 Discussion\u2014the teacher briefly describes a topic or problem and invites students to comment on it.\nStudents say something relevant about the topic, but also are supposed to respond to previous speakers if\npossible.\n\u2022 Group work\u2014the teacher assigns a general task, and a small group of students work out the details of\nimplementing it. The teacher may check on the group\u2019s progress before they finish, but not necessarily.\nEach of these structures influences how communication among teachers and students tends to occur; in fact\neach is itself sort of an implied message about how, when, and with whom to interact. To see how this influence\nworks, look in the next sections at how the participation structures affected classroom communication for one of us\nauthors (Kelvin Seifert) as he taught one particular topic\u2014children\u2019s play\u2014over a twenty-year period. The topic was\npart of a university-level course for future teachers. During this time, Kelvin\u2019s goals about the topic remained the\nsame: to stimulate students\u2019 thinking about the nature and purposes of play. But over time he tried several different\nstructures of participation, and students\u2019 ways of communicating changed as a result.\nLecture\nThe first time Kelvin taught about children\u2019s play, he lectured about it. He used this structure of participation\nnot because he believed on principle that it was the best, but because it was convenient and used widely by his\nfellow university teachers. An excerpt from Kelvin\u2019s lecture notes is shown in Table 20, and gives a sense of what he\ncovered at that time.\n166 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn some ways the lecture proved effective: Kelvin covered the material efficiently (in about 20 minutes), related\nthe topic to other ones in the course, defined and explained all key terms clearly, and did his best to relate the\nmaterial to what he thought were students\u2019 own interests. These were all marks of good lecturing (Christensen,\n2006). Students were mostly quiet during the lecture, but since only about one-third of them took notes, Kelvin had\nto assume that the rest had committed the material to memory while listening. The students quietness bothered\nhim a little, but as a newcomer to university teaching, Kelvin was relieved simply to get through the class without\nembarrassment or active resistance from the students.\nBut there were also some negative signs. In spite of their courtesy, few students lingered after class to talk about\nchildren\u2019s play or to ask questions. Worse yet, few students chose children\u2019s play as a term paper topic, even though\nit might have made a highly interesting and enjoyable one. On the final exam few seemed able to relate concepts\nabout play to their own experiences as teachers or leaders of recreational activities.\nThere was an even more subtle problem. The lecture about play focused overtly on a topic (play) that praised\naction, intrinsic motivation, and self-choice. But by presenting these ideas as a lecture, Kelvin also implied an\nopposite message unintentionally: that learning is something done passively, and that it follows an intellectual path\nset only by the teacher. Even the physical layout of the classroom sent this message\u2014desks faced forward, as if to\nremind students to look only at the person lecturing. These are features of lecturing, as Kelvin later discovered, that\nare widely criticized in educational research (McKeachie & Svinicki, 2005; Benedict & Hoag, 2004). To some\nstudents the lecture format might even have implied that learning is equivalent to daydreaming, since both\nactivities require sitting quietly and showing little expression. An obvious solution might have been to invite\nstudents to comment from time to time during the lecture, relating the topic to experiences and knowledge of their\nown. But during Kelvin\u2019s first year of teaching about play, he did little of this. The lecture medium, ironically,\ncontradicted the lecture message, or at least it assumed that students would think actively about the material\nwithout ever speaking.\nQuestions and answers\nBecause of these problems, Kelvin modified his approach after a few years of teaching to include more asking of\nquestions which students were invited to answer. This turned the lecture on children\u2019s play into something more\nlike a series of explanations of key ideas, interrupted by asking students to express their beliefs, knowledge, or\nexperience about children\u2019s play. Kelvin\u2019s preparation notes changes in appearance as a result (see Table 21).\nAsking questions and inviting brief responses was reassuring because it gave indications of whether students were\nlistening and understanding the material. Questions served both to motivate students to listen and to assess how\nmuch and how well they knew the material. In this regard Kelvin was using a form of communication that was and\ncontinues to be very popular with many teachers (Cazden, 2001).\nBut there were also new challenges and problems. For one thing the topic of children\u2019s play took longer to cover\nthan before, since Kelvin now had to allow time for students to respond to questions. This fact forced him to leave\nout a few points that he used to include. More serious, though, was his impression that students often did not listen\nto each other\u2019s responses; they only listened carefully to Kelvin, the teacher. The interactions often become simply\ntwo-way exchanges between the teacher and one student at a time: Kelvin asked, one student responded, Kelvin\nEducational Psychology 167 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nacknowledged or (sometimes) evaluated. (Mehan, 1979; Richards, 2006). Some of the exchanges could in principle\nhave happened just as easily without any classmates present.\nIn general students still had little control over the course of discussion. Kelvin wondered if he was controlling\nparticipation too much\u2014in fact whether the question-and-answer strategy attempted the impossible task of\ncontrolling students\u2019 very thought processes. By asking most of the questions himself and allowing students only\nbrief responses, was Kelvin trying to insure e that students thought about children\u2019s play in the \u201cright\u201d way, his\nway? To give students more influence in discussion, it seemed that Kelvin would have to become less concerned\nabout precisely what ideas about children\u2019s play he covered.\nClassroom discussion\nAfter several more years of teaching, Kelvin quit lectures altogether, even ones interspersed with questions and\nanswers. He began simply leading general discussions about children\u2019s play. The change again affected his planning\nfor this topic. Instead of outlining detailed content, he now just made concise notes that listed issues about\nchildren\u2019s play that students needed to consider (some of the notes are shown in Table 23). The shift in\nparticipation structure led to several major changes in communication between teacher and students as well as\namong students. Since students spoke more freely than before, it became easier to see whether they cared about the\ntopic. Now, too, more students seemed motivated to think and learn about children\u2019s play; quite a few selected this\ntopic, for example, for their term projects. Needless to say, these changes were all to the good.\nBut there were also changes that limited the effectiveness of classroom communication, even though students\nwere nominally freer to speak than ever. Kelvin found, for example, that certain students spoke more than their\nshare of the time\u2014almost too freely, in fact, in effect preventing more hesitant students from speaking. Sometimes,\ntoo, it seemed as if certain students did not listen to others\u2019 comments, but instead just passed the time waiting for\ntheir turn to speak, their hands propped permanently in the air. Meanwhile there were still others who passed the\ntime apparently hoping not to speak; they were busy doodling or staring out the window. Since the precise focus of\ndiscussion was no longer under Kelvin\u2019s control, furthermore, discussions often did not cover all of the ideas about\nchildren\u2019s play that Kelvin considered important. On one occasion, for example, he meant for students to discuss\nwhether play is always motivated intrinsically, but instead they ended up talking about whether play can really be\nused to teach every possible subject area. In itself the shift in focus was not bad, but it did make Kelvin wonder\nwhether he was covering the material adequately. In having these misgivings, as it happened, he was supported by\nother educators who have studied the effects of class discussions on learning (McKeatchie & Svinciki, 2005).\nGroup work\nBy the time he had taught about children\u2019s play for twenty years, Kelvin had developed enough concerns about\ndiscussion as a communication strategy that he shifted approach again. This time he began using a form of\ncollaborative group work: small teams of students carrying out projects on aspects of children\u2019s play that\ninterested them, making observations of children at play, reporting on their results to the class, and writing a\ncommon report about their work. (Kelvin\u2019s work guidelines given to the groups are shown in Table 22.) Kelvin\nhoped that by giving students a common focus, communication among them would improve. Conversations would\ndeal with the tasks at hand, students would necessarily listen to each other, and no one could afford either to\ndominate talk excessively or to fall silent.\n168 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn some ways these benefits did take place. With a bit of encouragement from Kelvin, students listened to each\nother more of the time than before. They also diversified their tasks and responsibilities within each group, and\nthey seemed to learn from each other in the course of preparing projects. Participation in the unit about children\u2019s\nplay reached an all-time high in Kelvin\u2019s twenty years of teaching at university. Yet even still there were problems.\nSome groups seemed much more productive than others, and observing them closely suggested that differences\nwere related to ease of communication within groups. In some groups, one or two people dominated conversations\nunduly. If they listened to others at all, they seemed immediately to forget that they had done so and proceeded to\nimplement their own ideas. In other groups, members all worked hard, but they did not often share ideas or news\nabout each other\u2019s progress; essentially they worked independently in spite of belonging to the group. Here, too,\nKelvin\u2019s experience corroborated other, more systematic observations of communication within classroom work\ngroups (Slavin, 1995). When all groups were planning at the same time, furthermore, communication broke down\nfor a very practical reason: the volume of sound in the classroom got so high that even simple conversation became\ndifficult, let alone the expression of subtle or complex ideas.\nCommunication styles in the classroom\nTeachers and students have identifiable styles of talking to each other that linguists call a register. A register is\na pattern of vocabulary, grammar, and expressions or comments that people associate with a social role. A familiar\nexample is the \u201cbaby-talk\u201d register often used to speak to an infant. Its features\u2014simple repeated words and\nnonsense syllables, and exaggerated changes in pitch\u2014mark the speaker as an adult and mark the listener as an\ninfant. The classroom language register works the same way; it helps indicate who the teacher is and who the\nstudent is. Teachers and students use the register more in some situations than in others, but its use is common\nenough that most people in our society have no trouble recognizing it when they hear it (Cazden, 2001). In the\nfollowing scene, for example, the speakers are labeled only with letters of the alphabet; yet figuring out who is the\nteacher and who are the students is not difficult:\nA: All right now, I want your eyes up here. All eyes on me, please. B, are you ready to work? We are\ngoing to try a new kind of math problem today. It\u2019s called long division. Does anyone know what\nlong division is? C, what do you think it is?\nC: Division with bigger numbers?\nA: Any other ideas? D?\nE (not D): Division by two digits.\nA: \u2026I only call on people who raise their hands. D, can you help with the answer?\nD: Division with remainders.\nA: Close. Actually you\u2019re both partly right.\nIn this scene Person A must surely be the teacher because he or she uses a lot of procedural and control talk, and\nbecause he or she introduces a new curriculum topic, long division. The other Persons (B, C, D, and E) must be\nstudents because they only respond to questions, and because they individually say relatively little compared to\nPerson A.\nEducational Psychology 169 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nIn general, effective classroom communication depends on understanding how features of the classroom talk\nregister like these operate during actual class times. In the following sections therefore we describe details of\nclassroom talk, and then follow with suggestions about how to use the register as effectively as possible. In both of\nthese sections we assume that the better the communication, the better the learning and thinking displayed by\nstudents. For convenience we divide classroom talk into two parts, teacher talk and student talk.\nHow teachers talk\nAlthough teacher talk varies somewhat with the tasks or purposes at hand, it also has uniformities that occur\nacross a range of situations. Using detailed observations of discourse in science activities, for example, Jay Lemke\nidentified all of the following strategies from observations of teachers\u2019 classroom talk (1990). Each strategy\nsimultaneously influences the course of discussion and focuses students\u2019 attention, and in these ways also helps\nindirectly to insure appropriate classroom behavior:\n\u2022 Nominating, terminating, and interrupting speakers: Teachers often choose who gets to speak. (\u201cJose,\nwhat do you think about X?\u201d). On the other hand, they often bring an end to a student\u2019s turn at speaking or\neven interrupt the student before he or she finishes. (\u201cThanks; we need to move on now.\u201d)\n\u2022 Marking importance or irrelevance: Teachers sometimes indicate that an idea is important (\u201cThat\u2019s a good\nidea, Lyla.\u201d). On the other hand, they sometimes also indicate that an idea is not crucial or important\n(\u201cYour right, but that\u2019s not quite the answer I was looking for.\u201d), or fully relevant (\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the\nbook Wuthering Heights, not the movie that you may have seen.\u201d). Marking importance and relevance\nobviously helps a teacher to reinforce key content. But the strategy can also serve to improve relationships\namong students if the teacher deliberately marks or highlights an idea offered by a quiet or shy student\n(O\u2019Connor & Michaels, 1996; Cohen, et al., 2004). In that case marking importance can build both a\nstudent\u2019s confidence and the student\u2019s status in the eyes of classmates.\n\u2022 Signaling boundaries between activities: Teachers declare when an activity is over and a new one is\nstarting\u2014an example of the procedural talk that we discussed earlier. (\u201cWe need to move on. Put away your\nspelling and find your math books.\u201d) In addition to clarifying procedures, though, signaling boundaries can\nalso insure appropriate classroom behavior. Ending an activity can sometimes help restore order among\nstudents who have become overly energetic, and shifting to a new activity can sometimes restore motivation\nto students who have become bored or tired.\n\u2022 Asking \u201ctest\u201d questions and evaluating students\u2019 responses: Teachers often ask test questions\u2014questions to\nwhich they already know the answer. Then they evaluate the quality or correctness of the students\u2019 answers\n(Teacher: \u201cHow much is 6 x 7 ?\u201d Student: \u201c42.\u201d Teacher: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d). Test questions obviously help\nteachers to assess students\u2019 learning, but they also mark the teacher as the expert in the classroom, and\ntherefore as a person entitled to control the flow of discourse.\nThere are additional features of teacher-talk that are not unique to teachers. These primarily function to make\nteachers\u2019 comments more comprehensible, especially when spoken to a group, but they also help to mark a person\nwho uses them as a teacher (Cazden, 2001; Black, 2004):\n170 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u2022 Exaggerated changes in pitch: When busy teaching, teachers tend to exaggerate changes in the pitch of\ntheir voice\u2014reminiscent of the \u201csing-song\u201d style of adults when directing speech to infants. Exaggerated\npitch changes are especially characteristic of teachers of young students, but they happen at all grade levels.\n\u2022 Careful enunciation: In class teachers tend to speak more slowly, clearly, and carefully than when\nconversing with a friend. The style makes a speaker sound somewhat formal, especially when combined\nwith formal vocabulary and grammar, mentioned next.\n\u2022 Formal vocabulary and grammar: Teachers tend to use vocabulary and grammar that is more formally\npolite and correct, and that uses relatively few slang or casual expressions. (Instead of saying \u201cGet out your\nstuff\u201d, they more likely say, \u201cPlease get out your materials.\u201d) The formality creates a businesslike distance\nbetween teachers and students\u2014hopefully one conducive to getting work done, rather than one that seems\nsimply cold or uncaring. The touch of formality also makes teachers sound a bit more intelligent or\nintellectual than in casual conversation, and in this way reinforces their authority in the classroom.\nHow students talk\nChildren and youth also use a characteristic speech register when they are in a classroom and playing the role of\nstudents in the presence of a teacher. Their register\u2014student talk\u2014differs somewhat from the teacher\u2019s because of\ntheir obvious differences in responsibilities, levels of knowledge, and relationships with each other and with the\nteacher. Student-talk and teacher-talk are similar in that both involve language strategies that guide content and\nprocedures, and that sometimes seek to limit the inappropriate behavior of others. Compared to teachers\u2019, though,\nstudents\u2019 language strategies often pursue these goals a bit more indirectly.\n\u2022 Agenda enforcement: Sometimes students interrupt a discussion to ask about or remind others, and\nespecially the teacher, of an agreed-on agenda. If the teacher tells students to open their text to an incorrect\npage, for example, a student may raise her hand to correct the teacher\u2014or even do so without raising a\nhand. This communication strategy is one of more public, direct ways that students influence activities in\nthe classroom, but its power is limited, since it does not create new activities, but simply returns the class to\nactivities agreed on previously.\n\u2022 Digression attempts: During a discussion or activity, a student asks a question or makes a statement that is\nnot relevant to the task at hand. While the teacher is leading students in a discussion of a story that they\nread, for example, a student raises his hand and asks, \u201cMr X, when does recess begin?\u201d\n\u2022 Side talk: One student talks to another student, either to be sociable (\u201cDid you see that movie last week?\u201d)\nor to get information needed for the current assigned task (\u201cWhat page are we on?\u201d). Sometimes side talk\nalso serves to control or limit fellow students\u2019 behavior, and in this way functions like control-talk by\nteachers (as when a student whispers, \u201cShhh! I\u2019m trying to listen\u201d or \u201cGo ahead and ask her!\u201d). The ability\nof such talk to influence classmates\u2019 behavior is real, but limited, since students generally do not have as\nmuch authority as teachers.\n\u2022 Calling out: A student speaks out of turn without being recognized by the teacher. The student\u2019s comment\nmay or may not be relevant to the ongoing task or topic, and the teacher may or may not acknowledge or\nrespond to it. Whether ignored or not, however, calling out may change the direction of a discussion by\nEducational Psychology 171 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\ninfluencing fellow students\u2019 thinking or behavior, or by triggering procedural and control talk by the\nteacher. (\u201cJason, it\u2019s not your turn; I only call on students who raise their hands.\u201d)\n\u2022 Answering a question with a question: Instead of answering a teacher\u2019s \u201ctest\u201d question directly, the\nstudent responds with a question of her own, either for clarification or as a stalling tactic (\u201cDo you mean\nX?\u201d). Either way, the effect is to shift the discussion or questioning to content or topics that are safer and\nmore familiar.\n\u2022 Silence: The student says nothing in response to a speaker\u2019s comments or to an invitation to speak. The\nspeaker could be either the teacher or a fellow student. The silence makes the speaker less likely to continue\nthe current topic, and more likely to seek a new one.\n\u2022 Eye contact, gaze aversion, and posture: The student looks directly at the teacher while the teacher is\nspeaking, or else deliberately averts gaze. The student may also adopt any variety of postures while sitting\n(sit up straight vs slouching). As we discussed earlier in this chapter, the timing of eye gaze depends partly\non cultural expectations that the student brings to school. But it may also represent a deliberate choice by\nthe student\u2014a message to the teacher and to classmates. The same can be said about sitting posture. In\nclassroom situations, listening is conventionally indicated by looking directly at the teacher, and either\nsitting up straight or leaning slightly forward. Although these behaviors can be faked, they tend to indicate,\nand to be taken as, a show of interest in and acceptance of what a speaker is saying. By engaging in or\navoiding these behaviors, therefore, students can sometimes influence the length and direction of a\ndiscussion or activity.\nUsing classroom talk to stimulate students\u2019 thinking\nThe various features of classroom talk characterize the communication of most teachers and students, at least\nwhen they are in a classroom and \u201cdoing school\u201d. (Communication outside of school is a different matter: then\nteachers as well as students may speak, listen, and behave quite differently!) As you might suppose, the extent and\nbalance among the features varies depending on grade level, curriculum area, and personalities of students or\nteachers. But failing to use a classroom register at all can easily create communication problems. Suppose, for\nexample, that a teacher never asks informal test questions. In that case the teacher will learn much less than\notherwise about her students\u2019 knowledge of the current material. Then also suppose that a student does not\nunderstand teachers\u2019 questions as test questions. That student may easily respond in ways that seem disrespectful\n(Teacher: \u201cHow much is 23 x 42?\u201d Student: \u201cI don\u2019t know; how much do you think it is?\u201d) (Bloome, et al., 2005).\nThe classroom talk register, then, constrains how communication between teachers and students can take place,\nbut it also gives teachers and students a \u201clanguage\u201d for talking about teaching and learning. Given this double-\nedged reality, how can teachers use the classroom talk register to good advantage? How, in particular, can teachers\ncommunicate in ways that stimulate more and better thinking and discussion? In the next, final section of the\nchapter, we offer some suggestions for answering these questions. As you will see, the suggestions often reinforce\neach other. They are more like a network of ideas, not a list of priorities to be considered or followed in sequence.\nProbing for learner understanding\nHow do you know whether a student understands what you are saying? One clue, of course, is by whether the\nstudent is looking at and concentrating on you and your comments. But this clue is not foolproof; we have all had\n172 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nmoments of staring at a speaker while daydreaming, only to realize later that we have not heard anything that the\nspeaker said. It is sometimes important, therefore, to probe more actively how much students are actually\nunderstanding during lessons or other activities.\nStrategies for probing understanding generally involve mixing instruction with conversation (Renshaw, 2004).\nIn explaining a new topic, for example, you can check for understanding by asking preliminary questions\nconnecting the topic to students\u2019 prior experiences and knowledge about the topic. Note that this strategy combines\nqualities of both instruction and conversation, in the sense that it involves combining \u201ctest\u201d questions, to which you\nalready know the answer, with real questions, to which you do not. When introducing a science lesson about density\nto kindergarten children, for example, the teacher might reasonably ask both of the following:\nTeacher: Which of these objects that I have do you expect will sink and which ones will float? (A test\nquestion\u2014the teacher already will know the answer.)\nTeacher: What other things have you seen that float? Or that sink? (A real question\u2014the teacher is\nasking about their experience and does not know the answer.)\nBy asking both kinds of questions, the teacher scaffolds the children\u2019s learning, or creates a zone of proximal\ndevelopment, which we described in Chapter 2 as part of Vygotsky\u2019s theory of learning. Note that this zone has two\nimportant features, both of which contribute to children\u2019s thinking. One is that it stimulates students\u2019 thinking (by\nasking them questions), and the other is that it creates a supportive and caring atmosphere (by honoring their\npersonal experiences with real questions). The resulting mix of warmth and challenge can be especially motivating\n(Goldstein, 1999).\nWhen warmth and challenge are both present in a discussion, it sometimes even becomes possible to do what\nmay at first seem risky: calling on individual students randomly without the students\u2019 volunteering to speak. In a\nstudy of \u201ccold calling\u201d as a technique in university class discussions, the researchers found that students did not\nfind the practice especially stressful or punitive, as the teachers feared they might, and that spontaneous\nparticipation in discussion actually improved as a result (Dallimore, et al., 2006). The benefit was most likely to\nhappen, however, when combined with gestures of respect for students, such as warning individuals ahead of class\nthat they might be called on, or allowing students to formulate ideas in small groups before beginning to call on\nindividuals.\nHelping students to articulate their ideas and thinking\nThe classroom talk register is well designed to help students articulate ideas and thoughts, particularly when\nused in the context of discussion. In addition to the conversational probes, like the ones we described in the\nprevious section, there are other ways to support students in expressing their ideas fully and clearly. One way is for\nthe teacher to check repeatedly on her own understanding of students\u2019 contributions as a discussion unfolds.\nConsider this exchange:\nStudent (during a class discussion): It seems to me that we all need to learn more climate change.\nTeacher: What do you mean by \u201clearn more\u201d? It\u2019s a big topic; what parts of it are you thinking\nabout?\nEducational Psychology 173 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\nStill another strategy for helping students to articulate their ideas is to increase the wait time between when the\nteacher asks a question and when the teacher expects a student to answer. As we pointed out earlier, wait times that\nare longer than average\u2014longer than one second, that is\u2014give students more time to formulate ideas and therefore\nto express themselves more completely and precisely (Good & Brophy, 2002). In addition, longer wait times have\nthe added advantage of indirection: instead of telling a student to say more, the teacher needs only to wait for the\nstudent to say more.\nIn general any communication strategy will help students become more articulate if it both allows and invites\nfurther comment and elaboration on their ideas. Taken together, the invitations closely resemble a description of\nclass discussion, though they can actually be used singly at any time during teaching. Consider these possible\nconversational moves:\n\u2022 The teacher asks the student to explain his initial idea more completely.\n\u2022 The teacher rephrases a comment made by a student.\n\u2022 The teacher compares the student\u2019s idea to another, related idea, and asks the student to comment.\n\u2022 The teacher asks for evidence supporting the student\u2019s idea.\n\u2022 The teacher asks the student how confident he is in his idea.\n\u2022 The teacher asks another student to comment on the first student\u2019s idea.\nPromoting academic risk-taking and problem-solving\nIn Chapter 8 we described major features of problem solving, as well as three techniques that assist in solving\nproblems\u2014problem analysis, working backwards from the beginning, and analogical thinking. While all of the\ntechniques are helpful, they do not work if a student will not take the risk of attempting a solution to a problem in\nthe first place. For various reasons students may sometimes avoid such risks, especially if he or she has sometimes\nfailed at a task in the past, and is therefore concerned about negative evaluations again (Hope & Oliver, 2005).\nWhat can a teacher say or do to counteract such hesitation? There are several strategies, all of which involve\nfocusing attention on the process of doing an activity rather than on its outcome or evaluation.\n\u2022 Where possible, call attention to the intrinsic interest or satisfaction of an activity. Consider, for example,\nan elementary-level activity of writing a Japanese haiku\u2014a poem with exactly seventeen syllables. This\nactivity can be satisfying in itself, regardless of how it is evaluated. Casually reminding individuals of this\nfact can contribute to students\u2019 sense of ease about writing the haiku and encourage them indirectly to do\nbetter work.\n\u2022 Minimize the importance of grades where possible. This strategy supports the one above; by giving\nstudents less to worry about, they become freer to experience the intrinsic satisfactions of an activity. In\nwriting that haiku mentioned above, for example, you can try saying something like: \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much\nabout your grade; just do the best you can and you will come out well enough in the end.\u201d\n\u2022 Make sure students know that they have ample time to complete an activity. If students need to rush\u2014or\nmerely just thinks they do\u2014then they are more likely to choose the safest, most familiar responses possible.\n174 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn writing an amusing story from their early childhood, for example, middle years students may need time\nto consider and choose among story possibilities. Then they may need additional time to experiment with\nways of expressing the story in writing. In this case, to make sure students know that they have such time,\ntry saying something like: \u201cWriting a good story will take time, and you may have to return to it repeatedly.\nSo we will start working on it today, but do not expect to finish today. We\u2019ll be coming back to it several\ntimes in the next couple of weeks.\u201d\n\u2022 Show that you value unusual ideas and elegant solutions to problems. When a student does something out\nof the ordinary, show your enthusiasm for it. A visually appealing drawing, a well-crafted essay, a different\nsolution to a math problem than the one you expected\u2014all of these deserve an explicit compliment.\nExpressing your interest and respect does more than support the specific achievement. It also expresses a\nmore general, underlying message that in your classroom, it is safe and rewarding to find and share the\nunusual and elegant.\nNote that these communication strategies support problem-solving and the related skills of creativity that we\ndiscussed in Chapter 8. In describing creativity in that chapter, in particular, we called attention to the difference\nand importance of divergent (open-ended) thinking. As with problem-solving, though, divergent thinking may\nseem risky to some students unless they are encouraged to do so explicitly. The strategies for boosting academic\nrisk-taking can help to communicate this encouragement\u2014that process matters more than product, that there will\nbe time enough to work, and that you, as teacher, indeed value their efforts.\nPromoting a caring community\nA caring community is one in which all members have a respected place, in which diversity among\nindividuals is expected, and in which individuals assist each other with their work or activities wherever\nappropriate. Classrooms and even entire schools can be caring communities, though moving them in this direction\ntakes work on the part of teachers and other school staff (Noddings, 1992, 2004). The key work in promoting a\ncaring community involves arranging for students to work together on tasks, while at the same time communicating\nthe teacher\u2019s commitment to mutual respect among students and between students and teachers. Many of the\ninstructional strategies discussed earlier in this book, such as cooperative learning and inquiry learning (in Chapter\n8), therefore contribute to community in the classroom.\nMore specifically, you can, as a teacher, encourage community by doing any or all of the following:\n\u2022 Tell students that you value mutual respect, and describe some of the ways that students can show respect\nfor each other and for school staff. Better yet, invite students themselves to describe how they might show\nrespect.\n\u2022 Look for ways to sustain relationships among students and teachers for extended times. These ways may be\neasier to find in elementary school, where a teacher and class normally remain together for an entire year,\nthan in middle and secondary school, where students learn from many teachers and teachers teach many\nstudents. But still there are ways. Participating in extra-curricular activities (like sports teams or drama\nclub), for example, can sometimes provide settings where relationships develop for relatively long periods\nof time\u2014even more than a single school year.\nEducational Psychology 175 A Global Text 8. The nature of classroom communication\n\u2022 Ask for input from students about what they want to learn, how they want to learn it, and what kind of\nevaluation they consider fair. Although using their ideas may feel at first as if you are giving up your\nresponsibility as the teacher, asking for students\u2019 input indicates respect for students. It is likely that many\nof their suggestions need clarification or revision to become workable, especially if the class must also cover\na particular curriculum during a set time. But even just the asking for input shows respect, and can\ncontribute to community in the classroom.\n\u2022 If conflicts arise between students or between a student and teacher, encourage respectful communication\nas explicitly as you can. Some communication strategies about conflict resolution were described in Chapter\n7 and are helpful in this regard: identifying true problem ownership, listening actively, assertive (not\naggressive) I-messages, and negotiation.\n\u2022 Find times and ways for the class to experience itself as a community. This suggestion may look a bit vague\nat first glance, but in practice it is actually quite concrete. Any action builds community if it is carried out by\nthe group as a whole, especially if it is done regularly and repeatedly and if it truly includes every member\nof the class. Such actions become rituals, not in the negative sense of empty or mindless repetitions, but in\nthe positive sense of confirmations by group members of their commitment to each other (Ehrenreich,\n2007). In the elementary grades, an obvious example of a ritual is reciting the Pledge of Allegiance (or its\nequivalent in classrooms outside the United States). But there are many other examples of classroom\nroutines that gradually acquire the (positive) qualities of ritual or community-affirmation, often without\ndeliberate intention or effort. A daily, regular time to work through homework problems together in class,\nfor example, may serve obvious academic purposes. But it may also gradually contribute to a classroom\u2019s\nidentity as a class. With time and familiarity the group homework time may eventually come to represent\n\u201cwho we are\u201d and of \u201cwhat we do here\u201d for that class.\nThe bottom line: messages sent, messages reconstructed\nAs we have explained in this chapter, teachers and students communicate in multiple, overlapping ways.\nCommunications may often be expressed in words\u2014but not necessarily and not completely. They may be organized\ninto lectures, questions, discussions, or group projects. They tend to be expressed in particular language registers\nthat we have called simply teacher talk and student talk. All things considered, communication obviously serves a\nwide range of teaching and learning tasks and activities, from stimulating students\u2019 thinking, to orchestrating\nclassroom routines, to managing inappropriate behaviors. It is an intrinsic part of the parts of teaching that involve\ninteraction among class members.\nNote, though, that teaching consists of more than interaction among class members. There are times when\nteachers prepare lessons or activities, for example, without talking to students or anyone else. There are also times\nwhen they develop their own skills as teachers\u2014for example, by reading and reflecting, or by attending professional\ndevelopment seminars or workshops\u2014which may involve communication, but not in the sense discussed in this\nchapter. It is to these other parts of teaching that we turn in the next chapter.\nTable 20: Year one: Kelvin\u2019s lecture notes\nNature and Purposes of Children\u2019s Play\n176 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n1.

It is helpful to think of classroom\ncommunication as serving a mixture of three purposes at once: content talk, procedural talk, and behavior control\n178 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ntalk. It is also helpful to recognize that classroom communication has elements that are not only verbal, but also\nnonverbal and unintended.\nTo be effective in using verbal communication, teachers need to use appropriate instructional strategies related\nto content, such as using advance organizers, relating new information to prior knowledge, and organizing new\ninformation on behalf of students. It includes strategies that assist students to communicate, such as inquiry\nlearning and cooperative learning. To communicate well about procedures and about the behaviors expected of\nstudents, teachers need a variety of management techniques, such as those discussed in Chapter 7 and summarized\nagain in Table 19. To be effective in using nonverbal communication, teachers need to use appropriate eye contact,\nallow ample wait time between speaking turns, and be aware of the effects of social distance on students.\nStructures of participation influence communication by facilitating particular patterns of speaking and listening,\nwhile at the same time making other patterns less convenient or disapproved. Four common participation\nstructures are lectures, questions-and-answers, classroom discussions, and group work.\nKey terms\nCaring community Procedural talk\nClass discussions Questions-and-answer\nCollaborative group work Register\nCommunication Social distance\nContent talk Student talk register\nControl talk Teacher talk register\nEye contact Unintended communication\nLecture Verbal communication\nNonverbal communication Wait time\nParticipation structures\nOn the Internet\n<http://www.uu.edu/centers/faculty/resources/index.cfm?CatID=13> This URL offers tips for\nenhancing classroom communication.

Facilitating complex\nthinking\nA few years ago one of us (Kelvin) had the privilege of co-teaching with an experienced first grade\nteacher, Carolyn Eaton. As part of a research project, Ms Eaton allowed some of her reading lessons\nto be observed. Here is what Kelvin saw when Ms Eaton was having a conference with Joey. They\nare reading a book \u201ctogether\u201d, except that Ms Eaton wants Joey to do as much reading as possible\nhimself. Joey\u2019s comments are capitalized, and Ms Eaton\u2019s are in lowercase.\nJOEY: FIRST YOU READ\u2014THEN ME. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. I READ AFTER YOU,\nOK?\nMs Eaton: OK. [Ms Eaton begins.] \u201cIn the great green room there was a telephone, a red balloon,\nand a picture of\u2026\u201d Are you going to read, or what?\nYES.\n\u201cIn the great green room there was\u2026\u201d Are you ready yet? Ready to read?\nOK. \u201cIN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM\u2026\u201d\n\u201c\u2026there was\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTHERE WAS A\u2026\u201d [pauses, looking at Ms Eaton rather than at the words]\n\u201c\u2026a telephone\u2026\u201d\nYES, THAT\u2019S IT, A TELEPHONE! \u201cIN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM THERE WAS A TELEPHONE, A\nRED BALLOON\u2026\u201d\n\u201cand a picture of\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAND A PICTURE OF\u201d [pauses, staring at the wall]\u2026A COW JUMPING?\u201d\n\u201ca cow jumping over the moon\u201d.\n\u201cOVER MOON\u201d [smiles from both Joey and Ms Eaton].\nJoey, what does this say? [She points to the word telephone.]\n\u201cTHERE WAS A TELEPHONE\u201d.\nHow about here? [She points to next page, which reads \u201cAnd there were three little bears, sitting on\nchairs\u201d.]\n\u201cTHERE WERE BEARS, THREE BEARS, AND THEY SAT ON CHAIRS\u201d.\nEducational Psychology 183 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nCan you read the whole book?\nSURE!\nOK, then you start this time.\n[Joey looks at first page, alternately at the picture and at the words.]\n\u201cIN THE GREAT GREEN ROOM THERE WAS A TELEPHONE\u201d.\n[Actual text: \u201cIn the great green room, there was a telephone\u201d,]\n\u201cAND THERE WAS A RED BALLOON\u201d,\n[Actual text: \u201c\u2026and a red balloon\u201d,]\n\u201cAND A PICTURE OF THE COW JUMPING OVER THE MOON\u201d.\n[Actual text: \u201c\u2026and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon\u201d.]\n\u201cAND THERE WERE\u2026\u201d THREE BEARS?\u2026 \u201cLITTLE BEARS SITTING ON CHAIRS\u201d.\n[Actual text: \u201cAnd there were three little bears, sitting on chairs,\u2026\u201d]\nCould you read this book with you eyes closed?\nSURE; WANT TO SEE ME DO IT?!\nWell, not right now; maybe another time. Could you read it without the pictures, just looking at the\nwords? That\u2019s how I do best\u2014when I see the words instead of the pictures.\n[Joey pauses to consider this.] MAYBE, BUT NOT QUITE SO WELL.\nLet\u2019s try it. [Ms Eaton proceeds to copy the words on a large sheet for Joey to \u201cread\u201d later.]\nAs Carolyn Eaton\u2019s behavior suggests, there are decisions to make \u201con the fly\u201d, even during the very act of\nteaching. Ms Eaton wonders when to challenge Joey, and when to support him. She also wonders when to pause\nand ask Joey to take stock of what he has read, and when to move him on ahead\u2014when to consolidate a student\u2019s\nlearning, and when to nudge the student forward. These are questions about instructional strategies which\nfacilitate complex learning, either directly or indirectly. In this chapter we review as many strategies as space\nallows, in order to give a sense of the major instructional options and of their effects. We concentrate especially on\ntwo broad categories of instruction, which we call direct instruction and student-centered instruction. As we hope\nthat you will see, each approach to teaching is useful for certain purposes. We begin, though, by looking at the ways\nstudents think, or at least how teachers would like students to think. What does it mean for students to think\ncritically (astutely or logically)? Or to think creatively? Or to be skillful problem solvers? Forms of thinking lead to\nchoices among instructional strategies.\nForms of thinking associated with classroom learning\nAlthough instructional strategies differ in their details, they each encourage particular forms of learning and\nthinking. The forms have distinctive educational purposes, even though they sometimes overlap, in the sense that\none form may contribute to success with another form. Consider three somewhat complex forms of thinking that\nare commonly pursued in classroom learning: (1) critical thinking, (2) creative thinking, and (3) problem-solving.\n184 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nCritical thinking\nCritical thinking requires skill at analyzing the reliability and validity of information, as well as the attitude or\ndisposition to do so. The skill and attitude may be displayed with regard to a particular subject matter or topic, but\nin principle it can occur in any realm of knowledge (Halpern, 2003; Williams, Oliver, & Stockade, 2004). A critical\nthinker does not necessarily have a negative attitude in the everyday sense of constantly criticizing someone or\nsomething. Instead, he or she can be thought of as astute: the critical thinker asks key questions, evaluates the\nevidence for ideas, reasons for problems both logically and objectively, and expresses ideas and conclusions clearly\nand precisely. Last (but not least), the critical thinker can apply these habits of mind in more than one realm of life\nor knowledge.\nWith such a broad definition, it is not surprising that educators have suggested a variety of specific cognitive\nskills as contributing to critical thinking. In one study, for example, the researcher found how critical thinking can\nbe reflected in regard to a published article was stimulated by annotation\u2014writing questions and comments in the\nmargins of the article (Liu, 2006). In this study, students were initially instructed in ways of annotating reading\nmaterials. Later, when the students completed additional readings for assignments, it was found that some students\nin fact used their annotation skills much more than others\u2014some simply underlined passages, for example, with a\nhighlighting pen. When essays written about the readings were later analyzed, the ones written by the annotators\nwere found to be more well reasoned\u2014more critically astute\u2014than the essays written by the other students.\nIn another study, on the other hand, a researcher found that critical thinking can also involve oral discussion of\npersonal issues or dilemmas (Hawkins, 2006). In this study, students were asked to verbally describe a recent,\npersonal incident that disturbed them. Classmates then discussed the incident together in order to identify the\nprecise reasons why the incident was disturbing, as well as the assumptions that the student made in describing the\nincident. The original student\u2014the one who had first told the story\u2014then used the results of the group discussion to\nframe a topic for a research essay. In one story of a troubling incident, a student told of a time when a store clerk\nhas snubbed or rejected the student during a recent shopping errand. Through discussion, classmates decided that\nan assumption underlying the student\u2019s disturbance was her suspicion that she had been a victim of racial profiling\nbased on her skin color. The student then used this idea as the basis for a research essay on the topic of \u201cracial\nprofiling in retail stores\u201d. The oral discussion thus stimulated critical thinking in the student and the classmates,\nbut it also relied on their prior critical thinking skills at the same time.\nNotice that in both of these research studies, as in others like them, what made the thinking \u201ccritical\u201d was\nstudents\u2019 use of metacognition\u2014strategies for thinking about thinking and for monitoring the success and quality\nof one\u2019s own thinking. This concept was discussed in Chapter 2 as a feature of constructivist views about learning.\nThere we pointed out that when students acquire experience in building their own knowledge, they also become\nskilled both at knowing how they learn, and at knowing whether they have learned something well. These are two\ndefining qualities of metacognition, but they are part of critical thinking as well. In fostering critical thinking, a\nteacher is really fostering a student\u2019s ability to construct or control his or her own thinking and to avoid being\ncontrolled by ideas unreflectively.\nHow best to teach critical thinking remains a matter of debate. One issue is whether to infuse critical skills into\nexisting courses or to teach them through separate, free-standing units or courses. The first approach has the\nEducational Psychology 185 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\npotential advantage of integrating critical thinking into students\u2019 entire educations. But it risks diluting students\u2019\nunderstanding and use of critical thinking simply because critical thinking takes on a different form in each\nlearning context. Its details and appearance vary among courses and teachers. The free-standing approach has the\nopposite qualities: it stands a better chance of being understood clearly and coherently, but at the cost of obscuring\nhow it is related to other courses, tasks, and activities. This dilemma is the issue\u2014again\u2014of transfer, discussed in\nChapter 2. Unfortunately, research to compare the different strategies for teaching critical thinking does not settle\nthe matter. The research suggests simply that either infusion or free-standing approaches can work as long as it is\nimplemented thoroughly and teachers are committed to the value of critical thinking (Halpern, 2003).\nA related issue about teaching critical thinking is about deciding who needs to learn critical thinking skills the\nmost. Should it be all students, or only some of them? Teaching all students seems the more democratic alternative\nand thus appropriate for educators. Surveys have found, however, that teachers sometimes favor teaching of critical\nthinking only to high-advantage students\u2014the ones who already achieve well, who come from relatively high-\nincome families, or (for high school students) who take courses intended for university entrance (Warburton &\nTorff, 2005). Presumably the rationale for this bias is that high-advantage students can benefit and/or understand\nand use critical thinking better than other students. Yet, there is little research evidence to support this idea, even if\nit were not ethically questionable. The study by Hawkins (2006) described above, for example, is that critical\nthinking was fostered even with students considered low-advantage.\nCreative thinking\nCreativity is the ability to make or do something new that is also useful or valued by others (Gardner, 1993).\nThe \u201csomething\u201d can be an object (like an essay or painting), a skill (like playing an instrument), or an action (like\nusing a familiar tool in a new way). To be creative, the object, skill, or action cannot simply be bizarre or strange; it\ncannot be new without also being useful or valued, and not simply be the result of accident. If a person types letters\nat random that form a poem by chance, the result may be beautiful, but it would not be creative by the definition\nabove. Viewed this way, creativity includes a wide range of human experience that many people, if not everyone,\nhave had at some time or other (Kaufman & Baer, 2006). The experience is not restricted to a few geniuses, nor\nexclusive to specific fields or activities like art or the composing of music.\nEspecially important for teachers are two facts. The first is that an important form of creativity is creative\nthinking, the generation of ideas that are new as well as useful, productive, and appropriate. The second is that\ncreative thinking can be stimulated by teachers\u2019 efforts. Teachers can, for example, encourage students\u2019 divergent\nthinking\u2014ideas that are open-ended and that lead in many directions (Torrance, 1992; Kim, 2006). Divergent\nthinking is stimulated by open-ended questions\u2014questions with many possible answers, such as the following:\n\u2022 How many uses can you think of for a cup?\n\u2022 Draw a picture that somehow incorporates all of these words: cat, fire engine, and banana.\n\u2022 What is the most unusual use you can think of for a shoe?\nNote that answering these questions creatively depends partly on having already acquired knowledge about the\nobjects to which the questions refer. In this sense divergent thinking depends partly on its converse, convergent\nthinking, which is focused, logical reasoning about ideas and experiences that lead to specific answers. Up to a\n186 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\npoint, then, developing students\u2019 convergent thinking\u2014as schoolwork often does by emphasizing mastery of\ncontent\u2014facilitates students\u2019 divergent thinking indirectly, and hence also their creativity (Sternberg, 2003; Runco,\n2004; Cropley, 2006). But carried to extremes, excessive emphasis on convergent thinking may discourage\ncreativity.\nWhether in school or out, creativity seems to flourish best when the creative activity is its own intrinsic reward,\nand a person is relatively unconcerned with what others think of the results. Whatever the activity\u2014composing a\nsong, writing an essay, organizing a party, or whatever\u2014it is more likely to be creative if the creator focuses on and\nenjoys the activity in itself, and thinks relatively little about how others may evaluate the activity (Brophy, 2004).\nUnfortunately, encouraging students to ignore others' responses can sometimes pose a challenge for teachers. Not\nonly is it the teachers' job to evaluate students\u2019 learning of particular ideas or skills, but also they have to do so\nwithin restricted time limits of a course or a school year. In spite of these constraints, though, creativity still can be\nencouraged in classrooms at least some of the time (Claxton, Edwards, & Scale-Constantinou, 2006). Suppose, for\nexample, that students have to be assessed on their understanding and use of particular vocabulary. Testing their\nunderstanding may limit creative thinking; students will understandably focus their energies on learning \u201cright\u201d\nanswers for the tests. But assessment does not have to happen constantly. There can also be times to encourage\nexperimentation with vocabulary through writing poems, making word games, or in other thought-provoking ways.\nThese activities are all potentially creative. To some extent, therefore, learning content and experimenting or\nplaying with content can both find a place\u2014in fact one of these activities can often support the other. We return to\nthis point later in this chapter, when we discuss student-centered strategies of instruction, such as cooperative\nlearning and play as a learning medium.\nProblem-solving\nSomewhat less open-ended than creative thinking is problem solving, the analysis and solution of tasks or\nsituations that are complex or ambiguous and that pose difficulties or obstacles of some kind (Mayer & Wittrock,\n2006). Problem solving is needed, for example, when a physician analyzes a chest X-ray: a photograph of the chest\nis far from clear and requires skill, experience, and resourcefulness to decide which foggy-looking blobs to ignore,\nand which to interpret as real physical structures (and therefore real medical concerns). Problem solving is also\nneeded when a grocery store manager has to decide how to improve the sales of a product: should she put it on sale\nat a lower price, or increase publicity for it, or both? Will these actions actually increase sales enough to pay for\ntheir costs?\nProblem solving in the classroom\nProblem solving happens in classrooms when teachers present tasks or challenges that are deliberately complex\nand for which finding a solution is not straightforward or obvious. The responses of students to such problems, as\nwell as the strategies for assisting them, show the key features of problem solving. Consider this example, and\nstudents\u2019 responses to it. We have numbered and named the paragraphs to make it easier to comment about them\nindividually:\nScene #1: a problem to be solved\nA teacher gave these instructions: \u201cCan you connect all of the dots below using only four straight\nlines?\u201d She drew the following display on the chalkboard:\nEducational Psychology 187 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nExhibit 10: The teacher gave these\ninstructions: \"Can you connect these dots with\nonly four lines\nThe problem itself and the procedure for solving it seemed very clear: simply experiment with\ndifferent arrangements of four lines. But two volunteers tried doing it at the board, but were\nunsuccessful. Several others worked at it at their seats, but also without success.\nScene #2: coaxing students to re-frame the problem\nWhen no one seemed to be getting it, the teacher asked, \u201cThink about how you\u2019ve set up the problem\nin your mind\u2014about what you believe the problem is about. For instance, have you made any\nassumptions about how long the lines ought to be? Don\u2019t stay stuck on one approach if it\u2019s not\nworking!\u201d\nScene #3: Alicia abandons a fixed response\nAfter the teacher said this, Alicia indeed continued to think about how she saw the problem. \u201cThe\nlines need to be no longer than the distance across the square,\u201d she said to herself. So she tried\nseveral more solutions, but none of them worked either.\nThe teacher walked by Alicia\u2019s desk and saw what Alicia was doing. She repeated her earlier\ncomment: \u201cHave you assumed anything about how long the lines ought to be?\u201d\nAlicia stared at the teacher blankly, but then smiled and said, \u201cHmm! You didn\u2019t actually say that\nthe lines could be no longer than the matrix! Why not make them longer?\u201d So she experimented again\nusing oversized lines and soon discovered a solution:\nExhibit 11: Alicia's solution\n188 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nScene #4: Willem\u2019s and Rachel's alternative strategies\nMeanwhile, Willem worked on the problem. As it happened, Willem loved puzzles of all kinds, and\nhad ample experience with them. He had not, however, seen this particular problem. \u201cIt must be a\ntrick,\u201d he said to himself, because he knew from experience that problems posed in this way often\nwere not what they first appeared to be. He mused to himself: \u201cThink outside the box, they always\ntell you\u2026\u201d And that was just the hint he needed: he drew lines outside the box by making them\nlonger than the matrix and soon came up with this solution:\nExhibit 12: Willem's and\nRachel's solution\nWhen Rachel went to work, she took one look at the problem and knew the answer immediately: she\nhad seen this problem before, though she could not remember where. She had also seen other\ndrawing-related puzzles, and knew that their solution always depended on making the lines longer,\nshorter, or differently angled than first expected. After staring at the dots briefly, she drew a solution\nfaster than Alicia or even Willem. Her solution looked exactly like Willem's.\nThis story illustrates two common features of problem solving: the effect of degree of structure or constraint on\nproblem solving, and the effect of mental obstacles to solving problems. The next sections discuss each of these\nfeatures, and then looks at common techniques for solving problems.\nThe effect of constraints: well-structured versus ill-structured problems\nProblems vary in how much information they provide for solving a problem, as well as in how many rules or\nprocedures are needed for a solution. A well-structured problem provides much of the information needed and\ncan in principle be solved using relatively few clearly understood rules. Classic examples are the word problems\noften taught in math lessons or classes: everything you need to know is contained within the stated problem and the\nsolution procedures are relatively clear and precise. An ill-structured problem has the converse qualities: the\ninformation is not necessarily within the problem, solution procedures are potentially quite numerous, and a\nmultiple solutions are likely (Voss, 2006). Extreme examples are problems like \u201cHow can the world achieve lasting\npeace?\u201d or \u201cHow can teachers insure that students learn?\u201d\nBy these definitions, the nine-dot problem is relatively well-structured\u2014though not completely. Most of the\ninformation needed for a solution is provided in Scene #1: there are nine dots shown and instructions given to draw\nfour lines. But not all necessary information was given: students needed to consider lines that were longer than\nEducational Psychology 189 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nimplied in the original statement of the problem. Students had to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d, as Willem said\u2014in this\ncase, literally.\nWhen a problem is well-structured, so are its solution procedures likely to be as well. A well-defined procedure\nfor solving a particular kind of problem is often called an algorithm; examples are the procedures for multiplying\nor dividing two numbers or the instructions for using a computer (Leiserson, et al., 2001). Algorithms are only\neffective when a problem is very well-structured and there is no question about whether the algorithm is an\nappropriate choice for the problem. In that situation it pretty much guarantees a correct solution. They do not work\nwell, however, with ill-structured problems, where they are ambiguities and questions about how to proceed or even\nabout precisely what the problem is about. In those cases it is more effective to use heuristics, which are general\nstrategies\u2014\u201crules of thumb\u201d, so to speak\u2014that do not always work, but often do, or that provide at least partial\nsolutions. When beginning research for a term paper, for example, a useful heuristic is to scan the library catalogue\nfor titles that look relevant. There is no guarantee that this strategy will yield the books most needed for the paper,\nbut the strategy works enough of the time to make it worth trying.\nIn the nine-dot problem, most students began in Scene #1 with a simple algorithm that can be stated like this:\n\u201cDraw one line, then draw another, and another, and another\u201d. Unfortunately this simple procedure did not\nproduce a solution, so they had to find other strategies for a solution. Three alternatives are described in Scenes #3\n(for Alicia) and 4 (for Willem and Rachel). Of these, Willem\u2019s response resembled a heuristic the most: he knew\nfrom experience that a good general strategy that often worked for such problems was to suspect a deception or\ntrick in how the problem was originally stated. So he set out to question what the teacher had meant by the word\nline, and came up with an acceptable solution as a result.\nCommon obstacles to solving problems\nThe example also illustrates two common problems that sometimes happen during problem solving. One of\nthese is functional fixedness: a tendency to regard the functions of objects and ideas as fixed (German & Barrett,\n2005). Over time, we get so used to one particular purpose for an object that we overlook other uses. We may think\nof a dictionary, for example, as necessarily something to verify spellings and definitions, but it also can function as a\ngift, a doorstop, or a footstool. For students working on the nine-dot matrix described in the last section, the notion\nof \u201cdrawing\u201d a line was also initially fixed; they assumed it to be connecting dots but not extending lines beyond the\ndots. Functional fixedness sometimes is also called response set, the tendency for a person to frame or think\nabout each problem in a series in the same way as the previous problem, even when doing so is not appropriate to\nlater problems. In the example of the nine-dot matrix described above, students often tried one solution after\nanother, but each solution was constrained by a set response not to extend any line beyond the matrix.\nFunctional fixedness and the response set are obstacles in problem representation, the way that a person\nunderstands and organizes information provided in a problem. If information is misunderstood or used\ninappropriately, then mistakes are likely\u2014if indeed the problem can be solved at all. With the nine-dot matrix\nproblem, for example, construing the instruction to draw four lines as meaning \u201cdraw four lines entirely within the\nmatrix\u201d means that the problem simply could not be solved. For another, consider this problem: \u201cThe number of\nwater lilies on a lake doubles each day. Each water lily covers exactly one square foot. If it takes 100 days for the\nlilies to cover the lake exactly, how many days does it take for the lilies to cover exactly half of the lake?\u201d If you\n190 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthink that the size of the lilies affects the solution to this problem, you have not represented the problem correctly.\nInformation about lily size is not relevant to the solution, and only serves to distract from the truly crucial\ninformation, the fact that the lilies double their coverage each day. (The answer, incidentally, is that the lake is half\ncovered in 99 days; can you think why?)\nStrategies to assist problem solving\nJust as there are cognitive obstacles to problem solving, there are also general strategies that help the process be\nsuccessful, regardless of the specific content of a problem (Thagard, 2005). One helpful strategy is problem\nanalysis\u2014identifying the parts of the problem and working on each part separately. Analysis is especially useful\nwhen a problem is ill-structured. Consider this problem, for example: \u201cDevise a plan to improve bicycle\ntransportation in the city.\u201d Solving this problem is easier if you identify its parts or component subproblems, such\nas (1) installing bicycle lanes on busy streets, (2) educating cyclists and motorists to ride safely, (3) fixing potholes\non streets used by cyclists, and (4) revising traffic laws that interfere with cycling. Each separate subproblem is\nmore manageable than the original, general problem. The solution of each subproblem contributes the solution of\nthe whole, though of course is not equivalent to a whole solution.\nAnother helpful strategy is working backward from a final solution to the originally stated problem. This\napproach is especially helpful when a problem is well-structured but also has elements that are distracting or\nmisleading when approached in a forward, normal direction. The water lily problem described above is a good\nexample: starting with the day when all the lake is covered (Day 100), ask what day would it therefore be half\ncovered (by the terms of the problem, it would have to be the day before, or Day 99). Working backward in this case\nencourages reframing the extra information in the problem (i. e. the size of each water lily) as merely distracting,\nnot as crucial to a solution.\nA third helpful strategy is analogical thinking\u2014using knowledge or experiences with similar features or\nstructures to help solve the problem at hand (Bassok, 2003). In devising a plan to improve bicycling in the city, for\nexample, an analogy of cars with bicycles is helpful in thinking of solutions: improving conditions for both vehicles\nrequires many of the same measures (improving the roadways, educating drivers). Even solving simpler, more basic\nproblems is helped by considering analogies. A first grade student can partially decode unfamiliar printed words by\nanalogy to words he or she has learned already. If the child cannot yet read the word screen, for example, he can\nnote that part of this word looks similar to words he may already know, such as seen or green, and from this\nobservation derive a clue about how to read the word screen. Teachers can assist this process, as you might expect,\nby suggesting reasonable, helpful analogies for students to consider.\nBroad instructional strategies that stimulate complex thinking\nBecause the forms of thinking just described\u2014critical thinking, creativity and problem solving\u2014are broad and\nimportant educationally, it is not surprising that educators have identified strategies to encourage their\ndevelopment. Some of the possibilities are shown in Table 24 and group several instructional strategies along two\ndimensions: how much the strategy is student-centered and how much a strategy depends on group interaction. It\nshould be emphasized that the two-way classification in Table 24 is not very precise, but it gives a useful framework\nfor understanding the options available for planning and implementing instruction. The more important of the two\ndimensions in the table is the first one\u2014the extent to which an instructional strategy is either directed by the\nEducational Psychology 191 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nteacher or initiated by students. We take a closer look at this dimension in the next part of this chapter, followed by\ndiscussion of group-oriented teaching strategies.\nTable 24: Major instructional strategies grouped by level of teacher direction and student focus\nDirected by student(s) more\nCooperative learning Self-reflection\nInquiry Independent study\nDiscovery learning Concept maps\nLectures Mastery learning\nEmphasizes\nEmphasizes groups\nindividuals somewhat\nDirect instruction Textbook readings\nsomewhat more\nmore\nMadeline Hunter's Advance organizers\n\u201cEffective Teaching\u201d\nOutlining\nRecalling, relating, and\nelaborating\nDirected by teacher more\nDefinitions of Terms in Table 8.1\nLecture Telling or explaining previously organized information\u2014usually to a group\nAssigned reading Reading, usually individually, of previously organized information\nAdvance organizers Brief overview, either verbally or graphically, of material about to be covered in a\nlecture or text\nOutlining Writing important points of a lecture or reading, usually in a hierarchical format\nTaking notes Writing important points of a lecture or reading, often organized according to the\nlearning needs of an individual student\nConcept maps Graphic depiction of relationships among a set of concepts, terms, or ideas;\nusually organized by the student, but not always\nMadeline Hunter\u2019s A set of strategies that emphasizes clear presentation of goals, the explanation\n\u201cEffective Teaching\u201d and modeling of tasks to students and careful monitoring of students\u2019 progress\ntoward the goals\n192 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nTeacher-directed instruction\nAs the name implies, teacher-directed instruction includes any strategies initiated and guided primarily by the\nteacher. A classic example is exposition or lecturing (simply telling or explaining important information to\nstudents) combined with assigning reading from texts. But teacher-directed instruction also includes strategies that\ninvolve more active response from students, such as encouraging students to elaborate on new knowledge or to\nexplain how new information relates to prior knowledge. Whatever their form, teacher-directed instructional\nmethods normally include the organizing of information on behalf of students, even if teachers also expect students\nto organize it further on their own. Sometimes, therefore, teacher-directed methods are thought of as transmitting\nknowledge from teacher to student as clearly and efficiently as possible, even if they also require mental work on\nthe part of the student.\nLectures and readings\nLectures and readings are traditional staples of educators, particularly with older students (including university\nstudents). At their best, they pre-organize information so that (at least in theory) the student only has to remember\nwhat was said in the lecture or written in the text in order to begin understanding it (Exley & Dennick, 2004). Their\nlimitation is the ambiguity of the responses they require: listening and reading are by nature quiet and stationary,\nand do not in themselves indicate whether a student is comprehending or even attending to the material. Educators\nsometimes complain that \u201cstudents are too passive\u201d during lectures or when reading. But physical quietness is\nintrinsic to these activities, not to the students who do them. A book just sits still, after all, unless a student makes\nan effort to read it, and a lecture may not be heard unless a student makes the effort to listen to it.\nAdvance organizers\nIn spite of these problems, there are strategies for making lectures and readings effective. A teacher can be\nespecially careful about organizing information for students, and she can turn part of the mental work over to\nstudents themselves. An example of the first approach is the use of advance organizers\u2014brief overviews or\nintroductions to new material before the material itself is presented (Ausubel, 1978). Textbook authors (including\nourselves) often try deliberately to insert periodic advance organizers to introduce new sections or chapters in the\ntext. When used in a lecture, advance organizers are usually statements in the form of brief introductory remarks,\nthough sometimes diagrams showing relationships among key ideas can also serve the same purpose (Robinson, et\nal., 2003). Whatever their form, advance organizers partially organize the material on behalf of the students, so that\nthey know where to put it all, so to speak, as they learn them in more detail.\nRecalling and relating prior knowledge\nAnother strategy for improving teacher-directed instruction is to encourage students to relate the new material\nto prior familiar knowledge. When one of us (Kelvin) first learned a foreign language (in his case French), for\nexample, he often noticed similarities between French and English vocabulary. A French word for picture, for\nexample, was image, spelled exactly as it is in English. The French word for splendid was splendide, spelled almost\nthe same as in English, though not quite. Relating the French vocabulary to English vocabulary helped in learning\nand remembering the French.\nAs children and youth become more experienced in their academics, they tend to relate new information to\npreviously learned information more frequently and automatically (Goodwin, 1999; Oakhill, Hartt, & Samols,\nEducational Psychology 193 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\n2005). But teachers can also facilitate students\u2019 use of this strategy. When presenting new concepts or ideas, the\nteacher can relate them to previously learned ideas deliberately\u2014essentially modeling a memory strategy that\nstudents learn to use for themselves. In a science class, for example, she can say, \u201cThis is another example of\u2026,\nwhich we studied before\u201d; in social studies she can say, \u201cRemember what we found out last time about the growth of\nthe railroads? We saw that\u2026\u201d\nIf students are relatively young or are struggling academically, it is especially important to remind them of their\nprior knowledge. Teachers can periodically ask questions like \u201cWhat do you already know about this topic?\u201d or\n\u201cHow will your new knowledge about this topic change what you know already?\u201d Whatever the age of students,\nconnecting new with prior knowledge is easier with help from someone more knowledgeable, such as the teacher.\nWhen learning algorithms for multiplication, for example, students may not at first see how multiplication is\nrelated to addition processes which they probably learned previously (Burns, 2001). But if a teacher takes time to\nexplain the relationship and to give students time to explore it, then the new skill of multiplication may be learned\nmore easily.\nElaborating information\nElaborating new information means asking questions about the new material, inferring ideas and relationships\namong the new concepts. Such strategies are closely related to the strategy of recalling prior knowledge as discussed\nabove: elaboration enriches the new information and connects it to other knowledge. In this sense elaboration\nmakes the new learning more meaningful and less arbitrary.\nA teacher can help students use elaboration by modeling this behavior. The teacher can interrupt his or her\nexplanation of an idea, for example, by asking how it relates to other ideas, or by speculating about where the new\nconcept or idea may lead. He or she can also encourage students to do the same, and even give students questions\nto guide their thinking. When giving examples of a concept, for example, a teacher can hold back from offering all of\nthe examples, and instead ask students to think of additional examples themselves. The same tactic can work with\nassigned readings; if the reading includes examples, the teacher can instruct students to find or make up additional\nexamples of their own.\nOrganizing new information\nThere are many ways to organize new information that are especially well-suited to teacher-directed instruction.\nA common way is simply to ask students to outline information read in a text or heard in a lecture. Outlining\nworks especially well when the information is already organized somewhat hierarchically into a series of main\ntopics, each with supporting subtopics or subpoints. Outlining is basically a form of the more general strategy of\ntaking notes, or writing down key ideas and terms from a reading or lecture. Research studies find that that the\nprecise style or content of notes is less important that the quantity of notes taken: more detail is usually better than\nless (Ward & Tatsukawa, 2003). Written notes insure that a student thinks about the material not only while\nwriting it down, but also when reading the notes later. These benefits are especially helpful when students are\nrelatively inexperienced at school learning in general (as in the earlier grade levels), or relatively inexperienced\nabout a specific topic or content in particular. Not surprisingly, such students may also need more guidance than\nusual about what and how to write notes. It can be helpful for the teacher to provide a note-taking guide, like the\nones shown in Exhibit 11.\n194 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nNotes on Science Experiment Guide to Notes About Tale of Two Cities:\n1.

Exhibit 10 shows concept maps made by\ntwo individuals that graphically depict how a key idea, child development, relates to learning and education. One of\nEducational Psychology 195 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nthe maps was drawn by a classroom teacher and the other by a university professor of psychology (Seifert, 1991).\nThey suggest possible differences in how the two individuals think about children and their development. Not\nsurprisingly, the teacher gave more prominence to practical concerns (for example, classroom learning and child\nabuse), and the professor gave more prominence to theoretical ones (for example, Erik Erikson and Piaget). The\ndifferences suggest that these two people may have something different in mind when they use the same term, child\ndevelopment. The differences have the potential to create misunderstandings between them (Seifert, 1999; Super &\nHarkness, 2003). By the same token, the two maps also suggest what each person might need to learn in order to\nachieve better understanding of the other person\u2019s thinking and ideas.\nExhibit 14: Maps of personal definitions of \u201cchild development\u201d\n196 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nMastery learning\nThis term refers to an instructional approach in which all students learn material to an identically high level,\neven if some students require more time than others to do so (Gentile, 2004). In mastery learning, the teacher\ndirects learning, though sometimes only in the sense of finding, writing, and orchestrating specific modules or units\nfor students to learn. In one typical mastery learning program, the teacher introduces a few new concepts or topics\nthrough a brief lecture or teacher-led demonstration. Then she gives an ungraded assignment or test immediately\nin order to assess how well students have learned the material, and which ones still need help. The students who\nhave already learned the unit are given enrichment activities. Those needing more help are provided individual\ntutoring or additional self-guiding materials that clarify the initial content; they work until they have in fact\nmastered the content (hence the name mastery learning). At that point students take another test or do another\nassignment to show that they have in fact learned the material to the expected high standard. When the system is\nworking well, all students end up with high scores or grades, although usually some take longer to do so than\nothers.\nAs you might suspect, mastery learning poses two challenges. The first is ethical: is it really fair to give\nenrichment only to faster students and remediation only to slower students? This practice could deteriorate into\ncontinually providing the fast with an interesting education, while continually providing the slow only with boring,\nrepetitious material. In using the approach, therefore, it is important to make all materials interesting, whether\nenrichment or remedial. It is also important to make sure that the basic learning goals of each unit are truly\nimportant\u2014even crucial\u2014for everyone to learn, so that even slower individuals spend their time well.\nThe other challenge of mastery learning is more practical: the approach makes strong demands for detailed,\nhighly organized curriculum. If the approach is to work, the teacher must either locate such a curriculum, write one\nherself, or assemble a suitable mixture of published and self-authored materials. However the curriculum is\ncreated, the end result has to be a program filled with small units of study as well as ample enrichment and\nremedial materials. Sometimes providing these practical requirements can be challenging. But not always: some\nsubjects (like mathematics) lend themselves to detailed, sequential organization especially well. In many cases, too,\ncommercial publishers have produced curricula already organized for use in mastery learning programs (Fox,\n2004).\nDirect instruction\nAlthough the term direct instruction is sometimes a synonym for teacher-directed instruction, more often it\nrefers to a version of mastery learning that is highly scripted, meaning that it not only organizes the curriculum into\nsmall modules or units as described above, but also dictates how teachers should teach and sometimes even the\nwords they should speak (Adams & Engelmann, 1996; Magliaro, Lockee, & Burton, 2005). Direct instruction\nprograms are usually based on a mix of ideas from behaviorism and cognitive theories of learning. In keeping with\nbehaviorism, the teacher is supposed to praise students immediately and explicitly when they give a correct answer.\nIn keeping with cognitive theory, she is supposed to state learning objectives in advance of teaching them\n(providing a sort of mini-advance organizer), provide frequent reviews of materials, and check deliberately on how\nwell students are learning. Direct instruction usually also introduces material in small, logical steps, and calls for\nplenty of time for students to practice.\nEducational Psychology 197 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nDirect instruction programs share one of the challenges of other mastery learning approaches: because they hold\nall students to the same high standard of achievement, they must deal with differences in how long students require\nto reach the standard. But direct instruction has an additional challenge, in that they often rely on small-group\ninteraction more heavily than other mastery learning programs, and use self-guiding materials less. This difference\nhas the benefit that direct instruction works especially well with younger students (especially kindergarten through\nthird grade), who may have limited skills at working alone for extended periods. The challenge is that reliance on\nsmall-group interaction can make it impractical to use direct instruction with an entire class or for an entire school\nday. In spite of these limits, however, research has found direct instruction to be very effective in teaching basic\nskills such as early reading and arithmetic (Adams & Engelmann, 1996).\nMadeline Hunter\u2019s effective teaching model\nA number of direct instruction strategies have been combined by Madeline Hunter into a single, relatively\ncomprehensive approach that she calls mastery teaching (not to be confused with the related term mastery\nlearning) or the effective teaching model (M. Hunter, 1982; R. Hunter, 2004). Important features of the model\nare summarized in Table 25. As you can see, the features span all phases of contact with students\u2014before, during,\nand after lessons.\nTable 25: Madeline Hunter's \u201cEffective Teaching Model\u201d\nPrepare students to learn.\n\u2022 Make good use of time at the beginning of a lesson or activity, when attention is best\n\u2022 Direct students' attention to what lies ahead in a lesson\u2014for example, by offering \u201cadvance organizers\u201d\n\u2022 Explain lesson objectives explicitly\nPresent information clearly and explicitly.\n\u2022 Set a basic structure to the lesson and stay with it throughout\n\u2022 Use familiar terms and examples\n\u2022 Be concise\nCheck for understanding and give guided practice.\n\u2022 Ask questions that everyone responds to\u2014for example, \u201cRaise your hand if you think the answer is X\u201d\n\u2022 Invite choral responses\u2014for example, \u201cIs this a correct answer or not?\u201d\n\u2022 Sample individuals' understanding\u2014for example, \u201cBarry, what's your example of X?\u201d\nProvide for independent practice.\n\u2022 Work through the first few exercises or problems together\n\u2022 Keep independent practice periods brief and intersperse with discussions that offer feedback\nSource: R. Hunter, 2004\n198 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nWhat happens even before a lesson begins? Like many forms of teacher-directed instruction, the effective\nteaching model requires curricula and learning goals that are tightly organized and divisible into small parts, ideas,\nor skills. In teaching about photosynthesis, for example, the teacher (or at least her curriculum) needs to identify\nthe basic elements that contribute to this process, and how they relate to each other. With photosynthesis, the\nelements include the sun, plants, animals, chlorophyll, oxygen produced by plants and consumed by animals, and\ncarbon dioxide that produced by animals and consumed by plants. The roles of these elements need to be identified\nand expressed at a level appropriate for the students. With advanced science students, oxygen, chlorophyll, and\ncarbon dioxide may be expressed as part of complex chemical reactions; with first-grade students, though, they may\nbe expressed simply as parts of a process akin to breathing or respiration.\nOnce this analysis of the curriculum has been done, the Hunter's effective teaching model requires making the\nmost of the lesson time by creating an anticipatory set, which is an activity that focuses or orients the attention of\nstudents to the upcoming content. Creating an anticipatory set may consist, for example, of posing one or more\nquestions about students\u2019 everyday knowledge or knowledge of prior lessons. In teaching about differences between\nfruits and vegetables, the teacher could start by asking: \u201cIf you are making a salad strictly of fruit, which of these\nwould be OK to use: apple, tomato, cucumber, or orange?\u201d As the lesson proceeds, information needs to be offered\nin short, logical pieces, using language as familiar as possible to the students. Examples should be plentiful and\nvaried: if the purpose is to define and distinguish fruits and vegetables, for example, then features defining each\ngroup should be presented singularly or at most just a few at a time, with clear-cut examples presented of each\nfeature. Sometimes models or analogies also help to explain examples. A teacher can say: \u201cThink of a fruit as a sort\nof \u2018decoration\u2019 on the plant, because if you pick it, the plant will go on living.\u201d But models can also mislead students\nif they are not used thoughtfully, since they may contain features that differ from the original concepts. In likening\na fruit to a decoration, for example, students may overlook the essential role of fruit in plant reproduction, or think\nthat lettuce qualifies as a fruit, since picking a few lettuce leaves does not usually kill a lettuce plant.\nThroughout a lesson, the teacher repeatedly checks for understanding by asking questions that call for\nactive thinking on the part of students. One way is to require all students to respond somehow, either with an actual\nchoral response (speaking in unison together), another way with a non-verbal signal like raising hands to indicate\nanswers to questions. In teaching about fruits and vegetables, for example, a teacher can ask, \u201cHere\u2019s a list of fruits\nand vegetables. As I point to each one, raise your hand if it\u2019s a fruit, but not if it\u2019s a vegetable.\u201d Or she can ask:\n\u201cHere\u2019s a list of fruits and vegetables. Say together what each on is as I point to it; you say \u2018fruit\u2019 or \u2018vegetable\u2019,\nwhichever applies.\u201d Even though some students may hide their ignorance by letting more knowledgeable\nclassmates do the responding, the general level or quality of response can still give a rough idea of how well\nstudents are understanding. These checks can be supplemented, of course, with questions addressed to individuals,\nor with questions to which individuals must respond briefly in writing. A teacher can ask everyone, \u201cGive me an\nexample of one fruit and one vegetable\u201d, and then call on individuals to answer. She can also say: \u201cI want everyone\nto make a list with two columns, one listing all the fruits you can think of and the other listing all the vegetables you\ncan think of.\u201d\nAs a lesson draws to a close, the teacher arranges for students to have further independent practice. The\npoint of the practice is not to explore new material or ideas, but to consolidate or strengthen the recent learning. At\nthe end of a lesson about long division, for example, the teacher can make a transition to independent practice by\nEducational Psychology 199 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nproviding a set of additional problems similar to the ones she explained during the lesson. After working one or two\nwith students, she can turn the rest of the task over to the students to practice on their own. But note that even\nthough the practice is supposedly \u201cindependent\u201d, students\u2019 understanding still has be checked frequently. A long set\nof practice problems therefore needs to be broken up into small subsets of problems, and written or oral feedback\noffered periodically.\nWhat are the limits of teacher-directed instruction?\nWhatever the grade level, most subjects taught in schools have at least some features, skills, or topics that\nbenefit from direct instruction. Even subjects usually considered \u201ccreative\u201d can benefit from a direct approach at\ntimes: to draw, sing, or write a poem, for example, requires skills that may be easier to learn if presented\nsequentially in small units with frequent feedback from a teacher. Research supports the usefulness of teacher-\ndirected instruction for a variety of educational contexts when it is designed well and implemented as intended\n(Rosenshine & Mesister,1995; Good & Brophy, 2004). Teachers themselves also tend to support the approach in\nprinciple (Demant & Yates, 2003).\nBut there are limits to its usefulness. Some are the practical ones are pointed out above. Teacher-directed\ninstruction, whatever the form, requires well-organized units of instruction in advance of when students are to\nlearn. Such units may not always be available, and it may not be realistic to expect busy teachers to devise their\nown. Other limits of direct instruction have more to do with the very nature of learning. Some critics argue that\norganizing material on behalf of the students encourages students to be passive\u2014an ironic and undesirable result if\ntrue (Kohn, 2000, 2006). According to this criticism, the mere fact that a curriculum or unit of study is constructed\nby a teacher (or other authority) makes some students think that they should not bother seeking information\nactively on their own, but wait for it to arrive of its own accord. In support of this argument, critics point to the fact\nthat direct instruction approaches sometimes contradict their own premises by requiring students to do a bit of\ncognitive organizational work of their own. This happens, for example, when a mastery learning program provides\nenrichment material to faster students to work on independently; in that case the teacher may be involved in the\nenrichment activities only minimally.\nCriticisms like these have led to additional instructional approaches that rely more fully on students to seek and\norganize their own learning. In the next section we discuss some of these options. As you will see, student-centered\nmodels of learning do solve certain problems of teacher-directed instruction, but they also have problems of their\nown.\nStudent-centered models of learning\nStudent-centered models of learning shift some of the responsibility for directing and organizing learning from\nthe teacher to the student. Being student-centered does not mean, however, that a teacher gives up organizational\nand leadership responsibilities completely. It only means a relative shift in the teacher\u2019s role, toward one with more\nemphasis on guiding students\u2019 self-chosen directions. As we explained earlier in this chapter, teacher-directed\nstrategies do not take over responsibility for students\u2019 learning completely; no matter how much a teacher\nstructures or directs learning, the students still have responsibility for working and expending effort to comprehend\nnew material. By the same token, student-centered models of learning do not mean handing over all organizational\n200 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nwork of instruction to students. The teacher is still the most knowledgeable member of the class, and still has both\nthe opportunity and the responsibility to guide learning in directions that are productive.\nAs you might suspect, therefore, teacher-directed and student-centered approaches to instruction may overlap\nin practice. You can see the overlap clearly, for example, in two instructional strategies commonly thought of as\nstudent-centered, independent study and self-reflection. In independent study, as the name implies, a student\nworks alone a good deal of the time, consulting with a teacher only occasionally. Independent study may be\nstudent-centered in the sense that the student may be learning a topic or skill\u2014an exotic foreign language, for\nexample\u2014that is personally interesting. But the opposite may also be true: the student may be learning a topic or\nskill that a teacher or an official school curriculum has directed the student to learn\u2014a basic subject for which the\nstudent is missing a credit, for example. Either way, though, the student will probably need guidance, support, and\nhelp from a teacher. In this sense even independent study always contain elements of teacher-direction.\nSimilarly, self-reflection refers to thinking about beliefs and experiences in order to clarify their personal\nmeaning and importance. In school it can be practiced in a number of ways: for example by keeping diaries or logs\nof learning or reading, or by retelling stories of important experiences or incidents in a student\u2019s life, or by creating\nconcept maps like the ones described earlier in this chapter. Whatever form it takes, self-reflection by definition\nhappens inside a single student\u2019s mind, and in this sense is always directed by the student. Yet most research on\nself-reflection finds that self-reflection only works well when it involves and generates responses and interaction\nwith other students or with a teacher (Seifert, 1999; Kuit, Reay, & Freeman, 2001). To be fully self-reflective,\nstudents need to have access to more than their existing base of knowledge and ideas\u2014more than what they know\nalready. In one study about students\u2019 self-reflections of cultural and racial prejudices (Gay & Kirkland, 2003), for\nexample, the researchers found that students tended to reflect on these problems in relatively shallow ways if they\nworked on their own. It was not particularly effective to write about prejudice in a journal that no one read except\nthemselves, or to describe beliefs in a class discussion in which neither the teacher nor classmates commented or\nchallenged the beliefs. Much more effective in both cases was for the teacher to respond thoughtfully to students\u2019\nreflective comments. In this sense the use of self-reflection, like independent study, required elements of teacher-\ndirection to be successful.\nHow might a teacher emphasize students\u2019 responsibility for directing and organizing their own learning? The\nalternatives are numerous, as they are for teacher-directed strategies, so we can only sample some of them here. We\nconcentrate on ones that are relatively well known and used most widely, and especially on two: inquiry learning\nand cooperative learning.\nInquiry learning\nInquiry learning stands the usual advice about expository (lecture-style) teaching on its head: instead of\npresenting well-organized knowledge to students, the teacher (or sometimes fellow students) pose thoughtful\nquestions intended to stimulate discussion and investigation by students. The approach has been described, used,\nand discussed by educators literally for decades, though sometimes under other names, including inquiry method\n(Postman & Weingartner, 1969), discovery learning (Bruner, 1960/2006), or progressive education (Dewey, 1933;\nMartin, 2003). For convenience, we will stay with the term inquiry learning.\nEducational Psychology 201 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nThe questions that begin a cycle of inquiry learning may be posed either by the teacher or by students\nthemselves. Their content depends not only on the general subject area being studied, but also on the interests\nwhich students themselves have expressed. In elementary-level science, for example, a question might be \u201cWhy do\nleaves fall off trees when winter comes?\u201d In high school social studies classes, it might be \u201cWhy do nations get into\nconflict?\u201d The teacher avoids answering such questions directly, even if asked to do so. Instead she encourages\nstudents to investigate the questions themselves, for example by elaborating on students\u2019 ideas and by asking\nfurther questions based on students\u2019 initial comments. Since students\u2019 comments can not be predicted precisely, the\napproach is by nature flexible. The initial questioning helps students to create and clarify questions which they\nconsider worthy of further investigation. Discussing questions about leaves falling off trees, for example, can\nprompt students to observe trees in the autumn or to locate books and references that discuss or explain the biology\nof tress and leaves.\nBut inquiry is not limited to particular grade levels or topics. If initial questions in a high school social studies\nclass have been about why nations get into conflict, for example, the resulting discussions can lead to investigating\nthe history of past wars and the history of peace-keeping efforts around the world. Whether the topic is high school\nsocial studies or elementary school biology, the specific direction of investigations is influenced heavily by students,\nbut with assistance from the teacher to insure that the students\u2019 initiatives are productive. When all goes well, the\ninquiry and resulting investigations benefit students in two ways. The first is that students (perhaps obviously)\nlearn new knowledge from their investigations. The second is that students practice a constructive, motivating way\nof learning, one applicable to a variety of problems and tasks, both in school and out.\nCooperative learning\nEven though inquiry-oriented discussion and investigation benefits when it involves the teacher, it can also be\nuseful for students to work together somewhat independently, relying on a teacher\u2019s guidance only indirectly.\nWorking with peers is a major feature of cooperative learning (sometimes also called collaborative learning). In\nthis approach, students work on a task in groups and often are rewarded either partially or completely for the\nsuccess of the group as a whole. Aspects of cooperative learning have been part of education for a long time; some\nform of cooperation has always been necessary to participate on school sports teams, for example, or to produce a\nstudent-run school newspaper. What is a bit newer is using cooperative or collaborative activities systematically to\nfacilitate the learning of a range of educational goals central to the academic curriculum (Prince, 2004).\nEven though teachers usually value cooperation in students, circumstances at school can sometimes reduce\nstudents\u2019 incentives to show it. The traditional practice of assessing students individually, for example, can set the\nstage for competition over grades, and cultural and other forms of diversity can sometimes inhibit individuals from\nhelping each other spontaneously. Strategies exist, however, for reducing such barriers so that students truly\nbenefit from each other\u2019s presence, and are more likely to feel like sharing their skills and knowledge. Here, for\nexample, are several key features that make cooperative learning work well (Johnson & Johnson, 1998; Smith, et\nal., 2005):\n\u2022 Students need time and a place to talk and work together. This may sound obvious, but it can be\noverlooked if time in class becomes crowded with other tasks and activities, or with interruptions related to\n202 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nschool (like assemblies) but not to the classroom. It is never enough simply to tell students to work\ntogether, only to leave them wondering how or when they are to do so.\n\u2022 Students need skills at working together. As an adult, you may feel relatively able to work with a variety of\npartners on a group task. The same assumption cannot be made, however, about younger individuals,\nwhether teenagers or children. Some students may get along with a variety of partners, but others may not.\nMany will benefit from advice and coaching about how to focus on the tasks at hand, rather than on the\npersonalities of their partners.\n\u2022 Assessment of activities should hold both the group and the individuals accountable for success. If a final\nmark for a project goes only to the group as a whole, then freeloading is possible: some members may not\ndo their share of the work and may be rewarded more than they deserve. Others may be rewarded less than\nthey deserve. If, on the other hand, a final grade for a group project goes only to each member\u2019s individual\ncontribution to a group project, then overspecialization can occur: individuals have no real incentive to\nwork together, and cooperative may deteriorate into a set of smaller individual projects (Slavin, 1994).\n\u2022 Students need to believe in the value and necessity of cooperation. Collaboration will not occur if students\nprivately assume that their partners have little to contribute to their personal success. Social prejudices\nfrom the wider society\u2014like racial bias or gender sexism, for example\u2014can creep into the operations of\ncooperative groups, causing some members to be ignored unfairly while others are overvalued. Teachers\ncan help reduce these problems in two ways: first by pointing out and explaining that a diversity of talents\nis necessary for success on a group project, and second by pointing out to the group how undervalued\nindividuals are contributing to the overall project (Cohen, Brody, & Sapon-Shevin, 2004).\nAs these comments imply, cooperative learning does not happen automatically, and requires monitoring and\nsupport by the teacher. Some activities may not lend themselves to cooperative work, particularly if every member\nof the group is doing essentially the same task. Giving everyone in a group the same set of arithmetic problems to\nwork on collaboratively, for example, is a formula for cooperative failure: either the most skilled students do the\nwork for others (freeloading) or else members simply divide up the problems among themselves in order to reduce\ntheir overall work (overspecialization). A better choice for a cooperative task is one that clearly requires a diversity\nof skills, what some educators call a rich group work task (Cohen, Brody, & Sapon-Shevin, 2004). Preparing a\npresentation about medieval castles, for example, might require (a) writing skill to create a report, (b) dramatic skill\nto put on a skit and (c) artistic talent to create a poster. Although a few students may have all of these skills, more\nare likely to have only one, and they are therefore likely to need and want their fellow group members\u2019\nparticipation.\nExamples of cooperative and collaborative learning\nAlthough this description may make the requirements for cooperative learning sound somewhat precise, there\nare actually a variety of ways to implement it in practice. Error: Reference source not found summarizes several of\nthem. As you can see, the strategies vary in the number of how many students they involve, the prior organization\nor planning provided by the teacher, and the amount of class time they normally require.\nTable 26: Strategies for encouraging cooperative learning\nEducational Psychology 203 A Global Text 9.

Although you may have personal preferences among possible\ninstructional strategies, the choice will also be guided by the uniqueness of each situation of teaching\u2014with its\nparticular students, grade-level, content, and purposes. If you need to develop students\u2019 problem solving skills, for\nexample, there are strategies that are especially well suited for this purpose; we described some (see, \u201cProblem\nsolving strategies\u201d in this chapter). If you need to organize complex information so that students do not become\nconfused by it, there are effective ways of doing so. If you want the students to take as much initiative as possible in\norganizing their own learning, this too can be done.\nYet having this knowledge is still not enough to teach well. What is still needed are ideas or principles for\ndeciding what to teach. In this chapter we have still not addressed an obvious question: How do I find or devise\ngoals for my teaching and for my students\u2019 learning? And assuming that I can determine the goals, where can I find\nresources that help students to meet them?\nChapter summary\nTeaching involves numerous instructional strategies, which are decisions and actions designed to facilitate\nlearning. The choice of strategies depends partly on the forms of thinking intended for students\u2014whether the goal\nis for students to think critically, for example, or to think creatively, or to solve problems. A fundamental decision in\nchoosing instructional strategies is how much to emphasize teacher-directed instruction, as compared to student-\ncentered models of learning. Teacher-directed strategies of instruction include lectures and readings (expository\nteaching), mastery learning, scripted or direct instruction, and complex teacher-directed approaches such as\nMadeline Hunter\u2019s effective teaching model. Student-centered models of learning include independent study,\nstudent self-reflection, inquiry learning, and various forms of cooperative or collaborative learning. Although for\nEducational Psychology 205 A Global Text 9. Facilitating complex thinking\nsome students, curriculum content and learning goals may lend themselves toward one particular type of\ninstruction, teaching is often a matter of combining different strategies appropriately and creatively.\nOn the Internet\n<www.glossary.plasmalink.com/glossary.html> This web page lists over 900 instructional strategies\u2014\nabout ten times as many as in this chapter!

Planning instruction\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, you could end up someplace else.\u201d\n(Casey Stengel)\nCasey Stengel, a much-admired baseball coach, was talking about baseball when he made this\nremark. But he could easily have been speaking of teaching as well. Almost by definition, education\nhas purposes, goals, and objectives, and a central task of teaching is to know what these are and to\ntransform the most general goals into specific objectives and tasks for students. Otherwise, as Casey\nStengel said, students may end up \u201csomeplace else\u201d that neither they, nor the teacher, nor anyone\nelse intends. A lot of the clarification and specification of goals needs to happen before a cycle of\ninstruction actually begins, but the benefits of planning happen throughout all phases of teaching. If\nstudents know precisely what they are supposed to learn, they can focus their attention and effort\nmore effectively. If the teacher knows precisely what students are supposed to learn, then the teacher\ncan make better use of class time and choose and design assessments of their learning that are more\nfair and valid. In the long run everyone benefits.\nThis chapter is therefore about instructional planning, the systematic selection of educational goals and\nobjectives and their design for use in the classroom. We will divide this idea into four parts, and discuss them one at\na time. First is the problem of selecting general goals to teach; where can a teacher find these, and what do they look\nlike? Second is the problem of transforming goals into specific objectives, or statements concrete enough to guide\ndaily activity in class; what will students actually do or say into order to learn what a teacher wants them to learn?\nThird is the problem of balancing and relating goals and objectives to each other; since we may want students to\nlearn numerous goals, how can we combine or integrate them so that the overall classroom program does not\nbecome fragmented or biased? Fourth is the challenge of relating instructional goals to students\u2019 prior experiences\nand knowledge. We have discussed this challenge before from the perspective of learning theory (in Chapter 2), but\nin this chapter we look at it from the more practical perspective of curriculum planning.\nSelecting general learning goals\nAt the most general or abstract level, the goals of education include important philosophical ideas like\n\u201cdeveloping individuals to their fullest potential\u201d and \u201cpreparing students to be productive members of society\u201d.\nFew teachers would disagree with these ideas in principle, though they might disagree about their wording or about\ntheir relative importance. As a practical matter, however, teachers might have trouble translating such generalities\ninto specific lesson plans or activities for the next day\u2019s class. What does it mean, concretely, to \u201cdevelop an\nindividual to his or her fullest potential\u201d? Does it mean, for example, that a language arts teacher should ask\nstudents to write an essay about their personal interests, or does it mean that the teacher should help students learn\nto write as well as possible on any topic, even ones that are not of immediate interest? What exactly should a\nteacher do, from day to day, to \u201cprepare students to be productive members of society\u201d as well? Answers to\nEducational Psychology 210 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nquestions like these are needed to plan instruction effectively. But the answers are not obvious simply by examining\nstatements of general educational goals.\nNational and state learning standards\nSome (but not all) of the work of transforming such general purposes into more precise teaching goals and even\nmore precise objectives has been performed by broad US organizations that represent educators and other experts\nabout particular subjects or types of teaching (Riley, 2002). The groups have proposed national standards,\nwhich are summaries of what students can reasonably be expected to learn at particular grade levels and in\nparticular subjects areas. In the United States, in addition, all state governments create state standards that serve\nmuch the same purpose: they express what students in the state should (and hopefully can) learn at all grade levels\nand in all subjects. Examples of organizations that provide national standards are listed in Table 27, and examples\nof state standards are listed in Table 28 for one particular state, Ohio, in the area of language arts.\nTable 27: Organizations with statements of US educational standards\nSubject Organization\nEnglish and Language Arts Council of Teachers of English\nAmerican Council on the Teaching of Foreign\nLanguages\nMathematics National Council of Teachers of Mathematics\nPhysical Education and Health National Association for Sport and Physical\nEducation\nAmerican Cancer Society\nScience National Academies of Science\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of\nScience\nSocial Studies National Council for the Social Studies\nCenter for Civic Education\nNational Council on Economic Education\nNational Geographic Society\nNational Center for History in the Schools\nTechnology International Society for Technology in Education\nOther Specialized Standards Statements:\n211 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAmerican Indian Content Standards Center for Educational Technology in Indian\nAmerica\nEthical Standards for School Counselors American School Counselors Association\nInformation Literacy Standards American Association of School Librarians\nBusiness Education National Business Education Association\nParent Education and Involvement Parent-Teacher Association (PTA)\nSource: <http://www.education-world.com/standards>, accessed December 5, 2006. Summaries of all of\nthese standards, as well as access to the relevant web pages of the corresponding organizations, can be found at\nthis website. Because standards are revised continually, and because of the dynamic nature of websites, the\ninformation may differ slightly from the above when you actually access it.\nTable 28: Examples of state curriculum standards about language arts\nGrade-level: Classroom example:\nKindergarten-Grade 3: Read accurately high- Play a game: \u201cHow many words can you see around\nfrequency sight words. the classroom that you can read already?\u201d\nGrade 4-7: Infer word meaning through Have students keep a journal of unfamiliar words\nidentification and analysis of analogies and other word which they encounter and of what they think the words\nrelationships. mean.\nGrade 8-10: Recognize the importance and function Have students write a brief essay explaining the\nof figurative language. meaning of a common figure of speech, and speculating\non why it became common usage.\nGrade 11-12: Verify meanings of words by the Have students analyze an essay that includes\nauthor\u2019s use of definition, restatement, example, unfamiliar terms using clues in the essay to determine\ncomparison, contrast and cause and effect. their meaning.\nSource for standards: Ohio Department of Education, 2003, p. 30-31\nBecause they focus on grade levels and subject areas, general statements of educational standards tend to be a\nbit more specific than the broader philosophical goals we discussed above. As a rule of thumb, too, state standards\ntend to be more comprehensive than national standards, both in coverage of grade levels and of subjects. The\ndifference reflects the broad responsibility of states in the United States for all aspects of public education; national\norganizations, in contrast, usually assume responsibility only for a particular subject area or particular group of\nstudents. Either type of standards provides a first step, however, toward transforming the grandest purposes of\nschooling (like developing the individual or preparing for society) into practical classroom activities. But they\nprovide a first step only. Most statements of standards do not make numerous or detailed suggestions of actual\nEducational Psychology 212 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nactivities or tasks for students, though some might include brief classroom examples\u2014enough to clarify the\nmeaning of a standard, but not enough to plan an actual classroom program for extended periods of time. For these\nlatter purposes, teachers rely on more the detailed documents, the ones often called curriculum frameworks and\ncurriculum guides.\nCurriculum frameworks and curriculum guides\nThe terms curriculum framework and curriculum guide sometimes are used almost interchangeably, but for\nconvenience we will use them to refer to two distinct kinds of documents. The more general of the two is\ncurriculum framework, which is a document that explains how content standards can or should be organized\nfor a particular subject and at various grade levels. Sometimes this information is referred to as the scope and\nsequence for a curriculum. A curriculum framework document is like a standards statement in that it does not\nusually provide a lot of detailed suggestions for daily teaching. It differs from a standards statement, though, in that\nit analyzes each general standard in a curriculum into more specific skills that students need to learn, often a dozen\nor more per standard. The language or terminology of a framework statement also tends to be somewhat more\nconcrete than a standards statement, in the sense that it is more likely to name behaviors of students\u2014things that a\nteacher might see them do or hear them say. Sometimes, but not always, it may suggest ways for assessing whether\nstudents have in fact acquired each skill listed in the document. Table 29 shows a page from a curriculum\nframework published by the California State Board of Education (Curriculum Development and Supplemental\nMaterials Committee, 1999). In this case the framework explains the state standards for learning to read, and the\nexcerpt in Table 29 illustrates how one particular standard, that \u201cstudents speak and write with command of\nEnglish conventions appropriate to this grade level\u201d, is broken into nine more specific skills. Note that the excerpt\nnames observable behaviors of students (what they do or say); we will discuss this feature again, more fully, in the\nnext part of this chapter, because it is helpful in classroom planning. In spite of this feature, though, the framework\ndocument does not lay out detailed activity plans that a teacher could use on a daily basis. (Though even so, it is\nover 300 pages long!)\nTable 29: An excerpt from reading/language arts framework for California public schools\nComments: Written and oral English language\nconventions, third grade\nStudents write and speak with a command of\nMore general standards statement\nstandard English conventions appropriate to this grade\nlevel.\nMore specific or concrete framework statements \u2192 Sentence Structure\n(stated as relatively specific skills or behaviors) 1.1 Understand and be able to use complete and\ncorrect declarative, interrogative, imperative, and\nexclamatory sentences in writing and speaking.\nGrammar\n213 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n1.2 Identify subjects and verbs that are in agreement\nand identify and use pronouns, adjectives, compound\nwords, and articles correctly in writing and speaking.\n1.3 Identify and use past, present, and future verb\ntenses properly in writing and speaking.\n1.4 Identify and use subjects and verbs correctly in\nspeaking and writing simple sentences.\nPunctuation\n1.5 Punctuate dates, city and state, and titles of\nbooks correctly.\n1.6 Use commas in dates, locations, and addresses\nand for items in a series.\nCapitalization\n1.7 Capitalize geographical names, holidays,\nhistorical periods, and special events correctly.\nSpelling\n1.8 Spell correctly one-syllable words that have\nblends, contractions, compounds, orthographic patters,\nand common homophones.\n1.9 Arrange words in alphabetical order.\nTeachers\u2019 need for detailed activity suggestions is more likely to be met by a curriculum guide, a document\ndevoted to graphic descriptions of activities that foster or encourage the specific skills explained in a curriculum\nframework document. The descriptions may mention or list curriculum goals served by an activity, but they are also\nlikely to specify materials that a teacher needs, time requirements, requirements for grouping students, drawings or\ndiagrams of key equipment or materials, and sometimes even suggestions for what to say to students at different\npoints during the activity. In these ways the descriptions may resemble lesson plans.\nSince classroom activities often support more than one specific skill, activities in a curriculum guide may be\norganized differently than they might be in a framework document. Instead of highlighting only one standard at a\ntime, as the framework document might, activities may be grouped more loosely\u2014for example, according to the\ndominant purpose or goal of an activity (\u201cActivities that encourage the practice of math facts\u201d) or according to a\ndominant piece of equipment or material (\u201cTen activities with tin cans\u201d). Table 30 shows a description of a\nEducational Psychology 214 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nkindergarten-level activity about \u201cautumn leaves\u201d that might appear in a curriculum guide. Note that the activity\nmeets several educational objectives at once\u2014tracing shapes, knowledge of leaves and of colors, descriptive\nlanguage skill. Each of these skills may reflect a different curriculum standard.\nTable 30: Sample curriculum guide activity\nCurriculum guides provide graphic descriptions of activities that can be used fairly directly in the classroom.\nAlthough they are relevant to standards and framework statements, they often are not organized around standards\nand objectives as such.\nActivity: Autumn Leaves\nLevel: Kindergarten\nThemes and Curriculum Connections: trees, autumn, color naming, color comparisons, size comparisons,\nfunctions of leaves, growth, the life cycle. See also Standards #xx-yy.\nBest time to do it: Fall (October), or whenever leaves are available\nMaterials needed: (1) small paper (6 x 6 inches); (2) access to leaves; (3) white glue; (4) felt pens or colored\npencils\nWhat to do: Give one piece of the small paper to each child. Invite children to color the sheet so that the entire\nsheet is decorated. Invite children to choose one leaf. Place leaf under the colored (decorated) paper and trace the\nshape of the leaf lightly in pencil. Then invite children to cut out the colored paper in the shape that has been\ntraced of the leaf.\nCautions: (1) Some children may need individual help with tracing or cutting. (2) Try to use leaves that are still\nsomewhat pliable, because some very old leaves (dried out) may crumble when traced.\nThings to talk about: Are some leaves bigger than others? Do they change shape as they grow, or only their\nsize? How do leaves benefit trees? How many different colors can real leaves be?\nFormulating learning objectives\nGiven curriculum frameworks and guides like the ones just described, how do you choose and formulate actual\nlearning objectives? Basically there are two approaches: either start by selecting content or topics that what you\nwant students to know (the cognitive approach) or start with what you want students to do (the behavioral\napproach). In effect the cognitive approach moves from the general to the specific, and the behavioral approach\ndoes the opposite. Each approach has advocates, as well as inherent strengths and problems. In practice, teachers\noften combine or alternate between them in order to give students some of the advantages of each.\nFrom general to specific: selecting content topics\nThe cognitive approach assumes that teachers normally have a number of long-term, general goals for students,\nand it begins with those goals. It also assumes that each student work toward long-term, general goals along\n215 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ndifferent pathways and using different styles of learning. Because of these assumptions, it is necessary to name\nindicators, which are examples of specific behaviors by which students might show success at reaching a general\nlearning goal. But it is neither desirable nor possible for a list of indicators to be complete\u2014only for it to be\nrepresentative (Gronlund, 2004). Consider this example from teaching middle-school biology. For this subject you\nmight have a general goal like the following, with accompanying indicators:\nGoal:\nThe student will understand the nature and purpose of photosynthesis.\nIndicators:\n1. explains the purpose of photosynthesis and steps in the process\n2. diagrams steps in the chemical process\n3. describes how plant photosynthesis affects the animal world\n4. writes a plan for how to test leaves for presence of photosynthesis\n5. makes an oral presentation and explains how the experiment was conducted\nUsing a strictly cognitive approach to planning, therefore, a teacher\u2019s job has two parts. First she must identify,\nfind, or choose a manageable number of general goals\u2014perhaps just a half dozen or so. (Sometimes these can be\ntaken or adapted from a curriculum framework document such as discussed earlier.) Then the teacher must think\nof a handful of specific examples or behavioral indicators for each goal\u2014just a half dozen or so of these as well. The\nbehavioral indicators clarify the meaning of the general goal, but are not meant to be the only way that students\nmight show success at learning. Then, at last, thoughtful planning for individual lessons or activities can begin. This\napproach works especially well for learning goals that are relatively long-term\u2014goals that take many lessons, days,\nor weeks to reach. During such long periods of teaching, it is impossible to specify the exact, detailed behaviors that\nevery student can or should display to prove that he or she has reached a general goal. It is possible, however, to\nspecify general directions toward which all students should focus their learning and to explain the nature of the\ngoals with a sample of well-chosen indicators or examples (Popham, 2002).\nThe cognitive, general-to-specific approach is reasonable on the face of it, and in fact probably describes how\nmany teachers think about their instructional planning. But critics have argued that indicators used as examples\nmay not in fact clarify the general goal enough; students therefore end up unexpectedly\u2014as Casey Stengel said at\nthe start of this chapter\u2014\u201csomeplace else\u201d. Given the general goal of understanding photosynthesis described\nabove, for example, how are we to know whether the five indicators that are listed really allow a teacher to grasp the\nfull meaning of the goal? Put differently, how else might a student show understanding of photosynthesis, and how\nis a teacher to know that a student\u2019s achievement is s a legitimate display of understanding? To some educators,\ngrasping the meaning of goals from indicators is not as obvious as it should be, and in any case is prone to\nmisunderstanding. The solution, they say, is not to start planning with general goals, but with specific behaviors\nthat identify students\u2019 success.\nEducational Psychology 216 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nFrom specific to general: behavioral objectives\nCompared to the cognitive approach, the behavioral approach to instructional planning reverses the steps in\nplanning. Instead of starting with general goal statements accompanied by indicator examples, it starts with the\nidentification of specific behaviors\u2014concrete actions or words\u2014that students should perform or display as a result\nof instruction (Mager, 2005). Collectively, the specific behaviors may describe a more general educational goal, but\nunlike the indicators used in the cognitive approach, they are not a mere sampling of the possible specific outcomes.\nInstead they represent all the intended specific outcomes. Consider this sampling of behavioral objectives:\nObjectives: Learning to use in-line roller blade skates (beginning level)\n1. Student ties boots on correctly.\n2. Student puts on safety gear correctly, including helmet, knee and elbow pads.\n3. Student skates 15 meters on level ground without falling.\n4. Student stops on demand within a three meter distance, without falling.\nThe objectives listed are not merely a representative sample of how students can demonstrate success with\nroller-blading. Instead they are behaviors that every student should acquire in order to meet the goal of using roller\nblades as a beginner. There simply are no other ways to display learning of this goal; getting 100 per cent on a\nwritten test about roller blading, for example, would not qualify as success with this goal, though it might show\nsuccess at some other goal, such as verbal knowledge about roller blading. Even adding other skating behaviors\n(like \u201cStudent skates backwards\u201d or \u201cStudent skates in circles\u201d) might not qualify as success with this particular\ngoal, because it could reasonably be argued that the additional skating behaviors are about skating at an advanced\nlevel, not a beginning level.\nIn the most commonly used version of this approach, originated by Robert Mager (1962, 2005), a good\nbehavioral objective should have three features. First, it should specify a behavior that can in fact be observed. In\npractice this usually means identifying something that a student does or says, not something a student thinks or\nfeels. Compare the following examples; the one on the left names a behavior to be performed, but the one on the\nright names a thinking process that cannot, in principle, be seen:\nBehavioral objective Not behavioral object\nThe student will make a list of animal species that The student will understand the difference between\nlive in the water but breathe air and a separate list of fish and mammals that live in the water.\nspecies that live in the water but do not require air to\nbreathe.\nThe second feature of a good behavioral objective is that it describes conditions of performance of the\nbehavior. What are the special circumstances to be provided when the student performs the objective? Consider\nthese two examples:\nSpecial condition of performance is specified A special condition of performance is not\nspecified\nGiven a list of 50 species, the student will circle those\nthat live in water but breathe air and underline those After three days of instruction, the student will\n217 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthat live in water but do not breathe air. identify species that live in water but breathe air, as well\nas species that live in water but do not breathe air.\nThe objective on the left names a special condition of performance\u2014that the student will be given a particular\nkind of list to work from\u2014which is not part of the instruction itself. The objective on the right appears to name a\ncondition\u2014\u201cthree days of instruction\u201d. But the condition really describes what the teacher will do (she will\ninstruct), not something specific to students\u2019 performance.\nThe third feature of a good behavioral objective is that it specifies a minimum level or degree of acceptable\nperformance. Consider these two examples:\nSpecifies minimum level Does not specify minimum level\nGiven a list of 50 species, the student will circle all of The student will circle names of species that live in\nthose that live in water but breathe air and underline all water but breathe air and underline those that live in\nof those that live in water but do not breathe air. The water but do not breathe air.\nstudent will do so within fifteen minutes.\nThe objective on the left specifies a level of performance\u2014100 per cent accuracy within 15 minutes. The objective\non the right leaves this information out (and incidentally it also omits the condition of performance mentioned on\nthe left).\nBehavioral objectives have obvious advantages because of their clarity and precision. They seem especially well\nsuited for learning that by their nature they can be spelled out explicitly and fully, such as when a student is\nlearning to drive a car, to use safety equipment in a science laboratory, or install and run a particular computer\nprogram. Most of these goals, as it happens, also tend to have relatively short learning cycles, meaning that they can\nbe learned as a result of just one lesson or activity, or of just a short series of them at most. Such goals tend not to\ninclude the larger, more abstract goals of education. In practice, both kinds of goals\u2014 the general and the specific\u2014\nform a large part of education at all grade levels.\nFinding the best in both approaches\nWhen it comes to teaching and learning the large or major goals, then, behavioral objectives can seem unwieldy.\nHow, a teacher might ask, can you spell out all of the behaviors involved in a general goal like becoming a good\ncitizen? How could you name in advance the numerous conditions under which good citizenship might be\ndisplayed, or the minimum acceptable level of good citizenship expected in each condition? Specifying these\nfeatures seems impractical at best, and at times even undesirable ethically or philosophically. (Would we really\nwant any students to become \u201cminimum citizens\u201d?) Because of these considerations, many teachers find it sensible\nto compromise between the cognitive and behavioral approaches. Here are some features that are often part of a\ncompromise:\n\u2022 When planning, think about BOTH long-term, general goals AND short-term, immediate objectives. A\nthorough, balanced look at most school curricula shows that they are concerned with the general as well as\nthe specific. In teaching elementary math, for example, you may want students to learn general problem\nsolving strategies (a general goal), but you may also want them to learn specific math facts (a specific\nobjective). In teaching Shakespeare\u2019s plays in high school, you may want students to be able to compare the\nEducational Psychology 218 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nplays critically (a general goal), but doing so may require that they learn details about the characters and\nplots of the major plays (a specific objective). Since general goals usually take longer to reach than specific\nobjectives, instructional planning has to include both time frames.\n\u2022 Plan for what students do, not what the teacher does. This idea may seem obvious, but it is easy to overlook\nit when devising lesson plans. Consider that example again about teaching Shakespeare. If you want\nstudents to learn the details about Shakespeare\u2019s plays, it is tempting to plan objectives like \u201cSummarize the\nplot of each play to students\u201d, or \u201cWrite and hand out to students an outline of the plays\u201d. Unfortunately\nthese objectives describe only what the teacher does, and makes the assumption (often unwarranted) that\nstudents will remember what the teacher says or puts in writing for them. A better version of the same\nobjective should focus on the actions of students, not of teachers\u2014for example, \u201cStudents will write a\nsummary, from memory, of each of the major plays of Shakespeare\u201d. This version focuses on what students\ndo instead of what the teacher does. (Of course you may still have to devise activities that help students to\nreach the objective, such as providing guided practice in writing summaries of plays.)\n\u2022 To insure diversity of goals and objectives when planning, consider organizing goals and objectives by using\na systematic classification scheme of educational objectives. At the beginning of this section we stated that\nthere is a need, when devising goals and objectives, for both the specific and the general. Actually a more\naccurate statement is that there is a need for goals and objectives that refer to a variety of cognitive\nprocesses and that have varying degrees of specificity or generality. One widely used classification scheme\nthat does so, for example, is one proposed 50 years ago by Benjamin Bloom (1956) and revised recently by\nhis associates (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). We describe this system, called a taxonomy of objectives, in\nthe next section.\nTaxonomies of educational objectives\nWhen educators have proposed taxonomies of educational objectives, they have tended to focus on one of three\nareas or domains of psychological functioning: either students\u2019 cognition (thought), students\u2019 feelings and emotions\n(affect), or students\u2019 physical skills (psychomotor abilities). Of these three areas, they have tended to focus the most\nattention on cognition. The taxonomy originated by Benjamin Bloom, for example, deals entirely with cognitive\noutcomes of instruction.\nBloom\u2019s Taxonomy:\nIn its original form, Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy of educational objectives referred to forms of cognition or thinking,\nwhich were divided into the six levels (Bloom, et al., 1956). Table 31 summarizes the levels, and offers two kinds of\nexamples\u2014simple ones based on the children\u2019s story, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and complex ones more\ntypical of goals and objectives used in classrooms. The levels form a loose hierarchy from simple to complex\nthinking, at least when applied to some subjects and topics. When planning for these subjects it can therefore be\nhelpful not only for insuring diversity among learning objectives, but also for sequencing materials. In learning\nabout geography, for example, it may sometimes make sense to begin with information about specific places or\nsocieties (knowledge and comprehension), and work gradually toward comparisons and assessments among the\nplaces or societies (analysis and synthesis).\nTable 31: Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy of objectives: cognitive domain\n219 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nType or level of learning Simple example Classroom example\nKnowledge: recall of \u201cName three things that \u201cList all of the planets of the solar\ninformation, whether it is simple or Goldilocks did in the house of the system.\u201d\ncomplex in nature three bears.\u201d\n\u201cState five key features of life in\nthe middle ages.\u201d\nComprehension: grasping the \u201cExplain why Goldilocks \u201cConvert the following arithmetic\nmeaning of information, by preferred the little bear\u2019s chair.\u201d word problem to a mathematical\ninterpreting it or translating it from equation.\u201d\none form to another\n\u201cDescribe how plants contribute\nto the welfare of animal life.\u201d\nApplication: using information \u201cPredict some of the things \u201cIllustrate how positive\nin new, concrete situations Goldilocks might have used if she reinforcement might affect the\nhad entered your house.\u201d behavior of a pet dog.\u201d\n\u201cUse examples from the plot to\nillustrate the theme of novel.\u201d\nAnalysis: breaking information \u201cSelect the part of Goldilocks and \u201cCompare the behavior of\ninto its components to understand the Three Bears where you think domestic dogs with the behavior of\nits structure Goldilocks felt most comfortable.\u201d wolves.\u201d\n\u201cDiagram the effects of weather\npatterns on plant metabolism.\u201d\nSynthesis: putting parts of \u201cTell how the story would have \u201cDesign an experiment to test the\ninformation together into a coherent been different if it had been three effects of gravity on root growth.\u201d\nwhole fishes.\u201d\n\u201cWrite an account of how\nhumans would be different if life had\noriginated on Mars instead of\nEarth.\u201d\nEvaluation: judging the value of \u201cJustify this statement: \u201cAppraise the relevance of the\ninformation for a particular purpose Goldilocks was a bad girl.\u201d novel for modern life.\u201d\n\u201cAssess the value of information\nprocessing theory for planning\ninstruction.\u201d\nEducational Psychology 220 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nSuch a sequence does not work well, however, for all possible topics or subjects. To learn certain topics in\nmathematics, for example, students may sometimes need to start with general ideas (like \u201cWhat does it mean to\nmultiply?\u201d) than with specific facts (like \u201cHow much is 4 x 6?\u201d) (Egan, 2005). At other times, though, the reverse\nsequence may be preferable. Whatever the case, a taxonomy of cognitive objectives, like Bloom\u2019s, can help to\nremind teachers to set a variety of objectives and to avoid relying excessively on just one level, such as simple recall\nof factual knowledge (Notar, et al., 2004).\nBloom\u2019s Taxonomy revised\nA few years ago two of Benjamin Bloom\u2019s original colleagues, Linda Anderson and David Krathwohl, revised his\ntaxonomy so as to clarify its terms and to make it more complete (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001; Marzano, 2006).\nThe resulting categories are summarized and compared to the original categories in Table 32. As the chart shows,\nseveral categories of objectives have been renamed and a second dimension added that describes the kind of\nthinking or cognitive processing that may occur. The result is a much richer taxonomy than before, since every level\nof the objectives can now take four different forms. Remembering, for example, can refer to four different kinds of\nmemory: memory for facts, for concepts, for procedures, or for metacognitive knowledge. Table 32 gives examples\nof each of these kinds of memory.\nTable 32: Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy of cognitive objectives\u2014revised\nOriginal term from Revised term A new dimension Example of\nBloom\u2019s Taxonomy emphasizing cognitive added: types of cognitive process\n(1956) processing (2001) knowledge learned remembering\n(2001) combined with\npossible types of\nknowledge\nKnowledge Remembering \u2022 factual knowledge Memory for facts:\nrecalling the names of\nComprehension Understanding\n\u2022 conceptual\neach part of a living cell\nApplication Applying knowledge\nMemory for concepts:\nAnalysis Analyzing \u2022 procedural recalling the functions of\nknowledge each part of a living cell\nEvaluation Evaluating\nMemory for\nSynthesis Creating \u2022 metacognitive\nprocedures: recalling\nknowledge\nhow to view a cell under a\nmicroscope\nMemory for\nmetacognition: recalling\nnot the names of the parts,\nbut a technique for\nremembering the names of\n221 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthe parts of a living cell\nCaption: The revision to Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy distinguishes between cognitive processes (left-hand column in\nthe table) and types of knowledge learned (right-hand column). The original version has terms similar to the\ncognitive processing terms in the revised version. According to the revised version, any type of knowledge (from\nthe right-hand column) can, in principle, occur with any type of cognitive processing (left-hand column).\nTaxonomies of affective objectives and psychomotor objectives\nAlthough taxonomies related to affect, or the feelings and emotions of students, are used less commonly than\ncognitive taxonomies for planning instruction, various educators have constructed them. One of the most widely\nknown was also published by colleagues of Benjamin Bloom and classifies affect according to how committed a\nstudent feels toward what he is learning (Krathwohl, Bloom, & Masia, 1964/1999). Table 33 summarizes the\ncategories and gives brief examples. The lowest level, called receiving, simply involves willingness to experience\nnew knowledge or activities. Higher levels involve embracing or adopting experiences in ways that are increasingly\norganized and that represent increasingly stable forms of commitment.\nTable 33: Taxonomies of objectives: affective domain and psychomotor domain\nAffective domain Psychomotor domain\nReceiving Willingness to attend to Imitation Repeating a simple\nparticular experience action that has been\ndemonstrated\nResponding Willingness to Manipulation Practice of an action\nparticipate actively in an that has been imitated but\nexperience only learned partially\nValuing Perception of Precision Quick, smooth\nexperience as worthwhile execution of an action that\nhas been practiced\nOrganization Coordination of valued Articulation Execution of an action\nexperiences into partially not only with precision, but\ncoherent wholes also with modifications\nappropriate to new\ncircumstances\nCharacterization by a Coordination of valued Naturalization Incorporation of an\nEducational Psychology 222 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nvalue complex experiences and of action into the motor\norganized sets of repertoire, along with\nexperiences into a single experimentation with new\ncomprehensive value motor actions\nhierarchy\nTaxonomies related to abilities and skills that are physical, or psychomotor, have also been used less widely than\naffective taxonomies, with the notable exception of one area of teaching where they are obviously relevant: physical\neducation. As you might expect, taxonomic categories of motor skills extend from simple, brief actions to complex,\nextended action sequences that combine simpler, previously learned skills smoothly and automatically (Harrow,\n1972; Simpson, 1972). One such classification scheme is shown in Table 33. An example of a very basic\npsychomotor skill might be imitating the action of throwing a ball when modeled by someone else; an example of\nthe latter might be performing a 10 minute gymnastics routine which the student has devised for himself or herself.\nNote, though, that many examples of psychomotor skills also exist outside the realm of physical education. In a\nscience course, for example, a student might need to learn to operate laboratory equipment that requires using\ndelicate, fine movements. In art classes, students might learn to draw, and in music they might learn to play an\ninstrument (both are partly motor skills). Most first graders are challenged by the motor skills of learning to write.\nFor students with certain physical disabilities, furthermore, motor skill development is an important priority for the\nstudent\u2019s entire education.\nStudents as a source of instructional goals\nSo far our discussion of instructional planning has described goals and objectives as if they are selected\nprimarily by educators and teachers, and not by students themselves. The assumption may be correct in many\ncases, but there are problems with it. One problem is that choosing goals and objectives for students, rather than by\nstudents, places a major burden on everyone involved in education\u2014curriculum writers, teachers, and students.\nThe curriculum writers have to make sure that they specify standards, goals, and objectives that are truly important\nfor students to learn (what if it really does not matter, for example, whether a science student learns about the\nperiodic table of the elements?). Teachers have to make sure that students actually become motivated to learn the\nspecified goals and objectives, even if the students are not motivated initially. Students have to master pre-set goals\nand objectives even if they might not have chosen them personally. Some critics of education have argued that these\nrequirements can be serious impediments to learning (Kohn, 2004). The problems are widespread and especially\nnoticeable in two forms of teaching. One is with the youngest students, who may especially lack patience with an\neducational agenda set by others (Kohn, 1999; Seitz, 2006). The other is with culturally diverse classrooms, where\nstudents and their families may hold a variety of legitimate, but unconventional expectations about what they\nshould learn (J. Banks & C. Banks, 2005).\nIn response to concerns like these, some educators advocate planning instruction around goals set or expressed\neither by students themselves or by the cultures or communities with which students identify. Their suggestions\n223 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nvary in detail, but can be organized into two broad categories: (1) emergent curriculum and (2) multicultural and\nanti-bias curriculum.\nEmergent curriculum\nAn emergent curriculum is one that explicitly builds on interests expressed by students, rather than goals set\nby curriculum writers, curriculum documents, or teachers. As you might suspect, therefore, instructional planning\nfor an emergent curriculum does not have the same meaning that the term has had in the chapter up to now.\nInstead, since an emergent curriculum by definition unfolds spontaneously and flexibly, students\u2019 interests may be\npredictable, but usually not very far in advance (Peterson, 2002). Suppose, for example, that a first-grade teacher\nplans a unit around Halloween, and that as one of the activities for this unit she reads a book about Halloween. In\nlistening to the book, however, the students turn out to be less interested in its Halloween content than in the fact\nthat one of the illustrations in the book shows a picture of a full moon partially hidden by clouds. They begin asking\nabout the moon: why it is full sometimes but not other times, why it rises in different places each month, and\nwhether the moon really moves behind clouds or whether the clouds actually do the moving. The teacher\nencourages their questions and their interest in moon astronomy. Over the next days or weeks, she arranges further\nactivities and experiences to encourage students\u2019 interest: she sets aside her original plans about Halloween and\nfinds books about the moon and about how the solar system works. She invites a local amateur astronomer to visit\nthe group and talk about his observations of the moon. Several children build models of the moon out of paper\nmach\u00e9. Some find books describing trips of the space shuttles to the moon. Others make a large mural depicting a\nmoonscape. And so on; the original goals about Halloween are not so much rejected, as set aside or forgotten in\nfavor of something more immediately interesting and motivating.\nWhile these activities could in principle happen because of recommendations from a curriculum document, the\nkey point about emergent curriculum is that they happen for a very different reason: these activities happen and the\ngoals emerge because the children want them. A teacher\u2019s challenge is therefore not planning activities that match\npredetermined curriculum goals or objectives, but to respond flexibly and sensitively as students\u2019 interests become\nknown and explicit. Teachers\u2019 responsiveness is facilitated by two practices that are especially prominent when a\nteacher adopts an emergent approach to curriculum. The first is careful, continuous observation of students. The\nteacher watches and listens, and may keep informal written records of students\u2019 comments and activities. The\ninformation allows her to respond more effectively to the interests they express, and at the same time it provides a\ntype of assessment of students\u2019 progress\u2014information about what the students are actually learning.\nA second strategy that facilitates teachers\u2019 success is curriculum webbing, a process of brainstorming\nconnections among initiatives suggested by students and ideas suggested by the teacher. In some cases webs can be\ncreated jointly with students by brainstorming with them about where their current interests may lead. In other\ncases they can be created independently by the teacher\u2019s own reflections. In still others, when a classroom has more\nthan one adult responsible for it, they can be created jointly with fellow teachers or teacher assistants. The latter\napproach works especially well in preschool, kindergartens, or special education classrooms, which often have more\nthan one adult responsible for the class (Vartuli & Rohs, 2006).\nTo some, emergent curriculum may seem like a formula for curriculum and management disasters. But the\napproach has often proved quite successful, particularly in early childhood education and the earliest grade levels of\nEducational Psychology 224 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nelementary school (Seitz, 2006; Wurm, 2005). Something akin to emergent curriculum is quite possible, in\nprinciple, even with older students. In Chapter 8, for example, we described a high school program in which\nstudents began with problems and experiences that were personally relevant, and discussed the problems with\nclassmates to formulate research problems which they then studied more formally and systematically (Hawkins,\n2006). In essence this strategy created an emergent curriculum analogous to the ones described above for young\nchildren. What the high school students studied was not predetermined, but emerged from their own expressed\ninterests.\nMulticultural and anti-bias education\nA culture is an all-encompassing set of values, beliefs, practices and customs of a group or community\u2014its total\nway of life. Cultures may be shared widely, even by much if not all of an entire nation, or they may be shared by\nrelatively few, such as a small community within a large city. Sometimes the term culture is even applied to the way\nof life of an individual family or of a specialized group in society; some might argue, for example, that there is a\nculture of schooling shared by teachers, though not necessarily by all students.\nBecause culture by definition touches on all aspects of living, it is likely to affect students\u2019 perspectives about\nschool, their ways of learning and their motivations to learn. The differences go beyond obvious differences in\nholidays, language, or food preferences. In some cultures, for example, individuals keep good eye contact with\nsomeone to whom they are speaking, and expect the same from others. In other cultures, such behavior is\nconsidered intrusive or overly aggressive, and avoiding eye contact while speaking is considered more respectful. Or\nanother example: in some cultures it is expected that individuals will be punctual (or on time), whereas in others\npunctuality is considered overly compulsive, and a more casual approach to time is the norm. Students regularly\nbring differences like these to school, where they combine with expectations from teachers and other school staff,\nand contribute indirectly to differences in achievement and satisfaction among students.\nTo be fully effective, therefore, instructional planning has to take into account the diversity in students\u2019 cultural\nbackgrounds, whether the differences are observable or subtle. Planning also has to work deliberately to reduce the\nsocial biases and prejudices that sometimes develop about cultural differences. Multicultural education and\nanti-bias education are two terms referring to these purposes. Their meanings often overlap significantly,\ndepending on the context or on who is using the terms. Generally, though, the first term\u2014multicultural education\u2014\nhas somewhat more to do with understanding the differences among cultures. The latter term\u2014anti-bias education\n\u2014has more to do with overcoming social prejudices and biases resulting from cultural differences. For convenience\nin this chapter, we will use the single term multicultural education to refer to both understanding differences and\novercoming prejudices.\nFully effective multicultural education has several features. The most obvious and familiar one is content\nintegration: the curriculum uses examples and information from different cultures to illustrate various concepts\nor ideas already contained in the curriculum (Vavrus, 2002). In studying holidays, for example, an elementary-\nschool teacher includes activities and information about Kwanzaa as well as Christmas, Hanukkah, or other\nholidays happening at about the same time. In studying the US Civil War, another example, a middle-years teacher\nincludes material written from the perspective of African-American slaves and Southern landowners. In teaching\nlanguage arts, students learn basic vocabulary of any non-English languages spoken by some members of the class.\n225 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nBut there is more to multicultural education than integrating content from diverse cultures. Among other\nfeatures, it also requires an equity pedagogy, which is an effort to allow or even encourage, a variety of learning\nstyles\u2014styles at which students may have become skillful because of their cultural backgrounds (Crow, 2005; C.\nBanks & J. Banks, 1995). In elementary language arts, for example, there may be more than one \u201cbest\u201d way to tell a\nstory. Should a student necessarily have to tell it alone and standing in front of the whole class, or might the student\ntell it jointly with a friend or in a smaller group? In learning to write a story, is legitimate variety also possible\nthere? Should a written story necessarily begin with a topic sentence that announces what the story is about, or can\nit save a statement of topic for the ending or even it leave it out altogether in order to stimulate readers to think?\nThe best choice is related in part to the nature and purpose of the story, of course, but partly also to differences in\ncultural expectations about story telling. Choosing a story form also points toward another feature of multicultural\neducation, the knowledge construction process, which is the unstated, unconscious process by which a\ncultural group creates knowledge or information. The popular media, for example, often portray Hispanic-\nAmericans in ways that are stereotypical, either subtly or blatantly (Lester & Ross, 2003). A fully multicultural\ncurriculum finds way to call these images to the attention of students and to engage them in thinking about how\nand why the images oversimplify reality.\nYet there is even more to a fully multicultural education. In addition to content integration, equity pedagogy,\nand knowledge construction, it fosters prejudice reduction, or activities, discussions and readings that identify\nstudents\u2019 negative evaluations of cultural groups (Jacobson, 2003; J. Banks & C. Banks, 2004). The activities and\ndiscussions can of course take a somewhat philosophical approach\u2014examining how students feel in general, what\nexperiences they remember having involving prejudice, and the like. But the activities and discussions can also take\na more indirect and subtle form, as when a teacher periodically speaks in a student\u2019s native language as a public\nsign of respect for the student. Gestures and discussions like these are especially effective if they contribute to the\nfifth element of multicultural education, empowering the school and social structure, in which all teachers\nand staff members find ways to convey respect for cultural differences, including even during extra-curricular and\nsports activities. A sports team or a debate club should not be limited to students from one cultural background and\nexclude those from another\u2014or more subtly, accept everyone but give the more desirable roles only to individuals\nwith particular social backgrounds. To the extent that cultural respect and inclusion are school-wide, teaching and\nlearning both become easier and more successful, and instructional planning in particular becomes more relevant\nto students\u2019 needs.\nEnhancing student learning through a variety of resources\nWhether instructional goals originate from curriculum documents, students\u2019 expressed interests, or a mixture of\nboth, students are more likely to achieve the goals if teachers draw on a wide variety of resources. As a practical\nmatter, this means looking for materials and experiences that supplement\u2014or occasionally even replace\u2014the most\ntraditional forms of information, such as textbooks. Precisely what resources to use depend on factors unique to\neach class, school, or community, but they might include one or more of the following.\nThe Internet as a learning tool\nThe Internet has become a fixture of modern society, and it offers a huge variety of information on virtually any\ntopic, including any school subject and any possible grade level from kindergarten through university. At the time\nof writing this book (2007), about two-thirds of all households in the United States and Canada have at least some\nEducational Psychology 226 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nsort of Internet access, and virtually 100 per cent of public and private schools have some access (Parsad & Jones,\n2006). These circumstances make the Internet a potential major resource for teachers and students\u2014a virtual\nlibrary many times larger than even the largest physical (or \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d) libraries in the world.\nBut the vastness of the Internet is not entirely a blessing. A major problem is that the sheer volume of\ninformation available, which can sometimes make searching for a specific topic, article, or document overwhelming\nand inefficient. The newer search engines (such as Google at <http://www.google.com>) can help with this\nproblem, though they do not solve it completely. When searching the term photosynthesis, for example, Google and\nother similar search engines return over six million web pages that discuss or refer this topic in some way! If a\nteacher is planning a unit about photosynthesis, or if a student is writing an essay about it, which of these web\npages will prove most helpful? Choosing among web pages is a new, somewhat specialized form of computer\nliteracy, one that can be learned partially by trial-and-error online, but that also benefits from assistance by a\nteacher or by more experienced peers (Ragains, 2006).\nAnother problem with the Internet is inequity of access. Even though, as we mentioned above, virtually all\nschools now have access of some sort, the access is distributed quite unevenly across communities and income\ngroups (Skinner, Biscope, & Poland, 2003; Parsad & Jones, 2005). For one thing, the large majority of Web pages\nare posted in English, and this fact naturally poses a challenge for any students who still learning to read or write\nEnglish. For another, schools vary widely in how much Internet service they can provide. In general, well-to-do\nschools and those in cities provide more access than those located in less well-off areas or in rural areas\u2014though\nthere are many exceptions. A richly endowed school might have an Internet connection in every classroom as well\nas multiple connections in a school library or in specialized computer rooms. Students as well as faculty would be\nable to use these facilities, and one or more teachers might have special training in Internet research to help when\nproblems arise. At the other extreme, a school might have only a few Internet connections for the entire school, or\neven just one, located in a central place like the library or the school office. Usage by students would consequently\nbe limited, and teachers would essentially teach themselves how to search the Internet and how to troubleshoot\ntechnical problems when they occur.\nIn spite of these problems, the Internet has considerable potential for enhancing students\u2019 learning, precisely\nbecause of its flexibility and near universality. Some of the best recent successes involve the creation of a learning\ncommons (sometimes also called an information commons or teaching commons), a combination of a website\nand an actual, physical place in a school or library that brings together information, students and teachers so that\nboth (though perhaps especially students) can learn (Haas & Robertson, 2004; Beagle, 2006). A learning commons\nincludes an online library catalogue and online Internet service, but it also offers other services: online information\nand advice about study skills, for example, as well as access to peer tutors and support groups, either online or in\nperson, that can help with difficulties about writing or doing assignments. As you might suspect, using a learning\ncommons effectively sometimes requires reorganizing certain features of teaching and learning, chiefly toward\ngreater explicit collaboration among students and teachers.\n227 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nUsing local experts and field trips\nTwo other ways of enhancing learning include bringing local experts to the classroom and taking the class on\nfield trips outside the classroom. Both of these strategies help to make learning more vivid, as well as more relevant\nto the particular community and lives that students lead.\nLocal experts\nClassroom visits by persons with key experience can often add a lot to many curriculum subjects and topics. In\none tenth grade science class studying environmental issues, for example, the teacher invited the city forester, the\nperson responsible for the health of trees planted in city parks and along city boulevards. The forester had special\nknowledge of the stresses on trees in urban environments, and he was able to explain and give examples of\nparticular problems that had occurred and their solutions. In a second grade class with many Hispanic students, on\nthe other hand, a teacher aide was able to serve as an expert visitor by describing her memories of childhood in a\nSpanish-speaking community in New Mexico. Later she also recruited an older Hispanic friend and relative to the\nclass to describe their experiences growing up in Central America. She also acted as their English-Spanish\ninterpreter. In all of these examples, the experts made the learning more real and immediate. Their presence\ncounteracted the tendency to equate school learning with book-based knowledge\u2014a common hazard when basing\ninstructional planning primarily on curriculum documents.\nField trips\nIn addition to bringing the world to the classroom by inviting visitors, teachers can do the converse, they can\ntake the classroom to the world by leading students on field trips. Such trips are not confined to any particular\ngrade level. In the early grades of elementary school, for example, one common goal of the curriculum is to learn\nabout community helpers\u2014the police, firefighters, store owners, and others who make a community safe and\nlivable. As indicated already, representatives of these groups can visit the class and tell about their work. But the\nclass can also visit the places which these people tell about: a police station, a fire hall, a local retail store, and the\nlike. Such trips offer a more complete picture of the context in which community professionals work than is\npossible simply from hearing and reading about it. The benefits are possible for older students as well. In learning\nabout water-borne diseases as part of a biology class, for example, one middle-school class took a field trip to the\nlocal water-treatment facility, where staff members explained where the town\u2019s water came from and how the water\nwas cleaned to become drinkable at any tap.\nFrom a teacher\u2019s point of view, of course, there are certain risks about arranging classroom visitors or field trips.\nOne is that a visitor may turn out not to communicate well with children or young people\u2014he or she may assume\ntoo much prior knowledge, for example, or veer off the chosen topic. Another problem is that field trips often\nrequire additional funds (for admission fees or to pay for a bus), and require support from additional adults\u2014often\nparents\u2014to supervise students outside of school. Some of these problems are by-passed by arranging \u201cvirtual\u201d field\ntrips and hearing from \u201cvirtual\u201d visitors: using computer software or media to show students places and activities\nwhich they cannot visit in person (Clark, 2006). Generally, though, a computer-based experience cannot compare\nwith a real trip or visitor in vividness, and the benefits of actual, in-person field trips or visitors often therefore\noutweigh the challenges of arranging them.\nEducational Psychology 228 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nService learning\nStill another way to enhance learning is to incorporate service learning, which is activity that combines real\ncommunity service with analysis and reflection on the significance of the service (Johnson & O\u2019Grady, 2006;\nThomsen, 2006). Picking up trash in an urban stream bed, for example, is a community service which students can\nperform. To transform this service into service learning, students also need to note and reflect on the trash that\nthey find; talk and write about the ecological environment of the stream and of the community; and even make\nrecommendations for improving the local environment. To accomplish these objectives, service learning activities\nshould not be sporadic, nor used as a punishment\u2014as when a teacher or principal assigns trash pick-up as an after-\nschool detention activity.\nUnder good conditions, service learning enhances instructional plans both morally and intellectually. Morally, it\nplaces students in the role of creating good for the community, and counteracts students\u2019 perception that being\n\u201cgood\u201d simply means complying with teachers\u2019 or parents\u2019 rules passively. Intellectually, service learning places\nsocial and community issues in a vivid, lived context. The environment, economic inequality, or race relations, for\nexample, are no longer just ideas that people merely talk about, but problems that people actually act upon\n(Dicklitch, 2005).\nAs you might suspect, though, making service learning successful is not automatic. For one thing, service\nlearning lends itself well only to certain curriculum areas (for example, community studies or social studies). For\nanother, some students may initially resist service learning, wondering whether it benefits them personally as\nstudents (Jones, Gilbride-Brown, & Gasiorski, 2005). Also, some service projects may inadvertently be invented\nonly to benefit students, without adequate consultation or advice from community members. Bringing food\nhampers to low-income families may seem like a good idea to middle-class students or instructors, but some\nfamilies may perceive this action less as a benefit than as an act of charity which they therefore resent. But none of\nthese problems are insurmountable. Evaluations generally find that service learning, when done well, increases\nstudents\u2019 sense of moral empowerment as well as their knowledge of social issues (Buchanan, Baldwin, & Rudisill,\n2002). Like many other educational practices, insuring success with service learning requires doing it well.\nCreating bridges among curriculum goals and students\u2019 prior experiences\nTo succeed, then, instructional plans do require a variety of resources, like the ones discussed in the previous\nsection. But they also require more: they need to connect with students\u2019 prior experiences and knowledge.\nSometimes the connections can develop as a result of using the Internet, taking field trips, or engaging in service\nlearning, particularly if students are already familiar with these activities and places. More often than not, though,\nteachers need to find additional ways to connect curriculum with students\u2019 experiences\u2014ways that fit more\nthoroughly and continuously into the daily work of a class. Fortunately, such techniques are readily at hand; they\nsimply require the teacher to develop a habit of looking for opportunities to use them. Among the possibilities are\nfour that deserve special mention: (1) modeling behavior and modeling representations of ideas, (2) activating\nprior knowledge already familiar to students, (3) anticipating preconceptions held by students, and (4) providing\nguided and independent practice, including its most traditional form, homework.\n229 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nModeling\nThe term modeling can mean either a demonstration of a desired behavior or a representation of an important\ntheory, idea, or object. Each of these meanings can link curriculum goals with students\u2019 prior knowledge and\nexperience.\nModeling as a demonstration\nIn the first meaning, modeling refers to performing or demonstrating a desired new behavior or skill, as when\na teacher or classmate demonstrates polite behaviors or the correct solution to a math problem. In this case we say\nthat the teacher or classmate models the desired behavior, either deliberately or in the course of other ongoing\nactivity. Students observe the modeled behavior and (hopefully) imitate it themselves. Research repeatedly shows\nthat modeling desired behaviors is an effective way to learn new behaviors, especially when the model is perceived\nas important (like the teacher), similar to the learner (like a student\u2019s best friend), or has a warm, positive\nrelationship with the learner (like the teacher or the student\u2019s friend) (Bandura, 2002; Gibson, 2004). Modeling in\nthis sense is sometimes also called observational learning. It has many of the same properties as the classic\noperant conditioning discussed in Chapter 2, except that reinforcement during observational learning is witnessed\nin others rather than experienced by the learner directly. Watching others being reinforced is sometimes called\nvicarious reinforcement. The idea is that if, for example, a student observes a classmate who behaves politely with\nthe teacher and then sees that classmate receive praise for the behavior (vicarious reinforcement), the student is\nmore likely to imitate the polite behavior that he saw. As in classic operant conditioning, furthermore, if the student\nobserves that politeness by classmates is ignored (extinction or no reinforcement), then the student is much less\nlikely to imitate the politeness. Worse yet, if the student observes that negative behaviors in others lead to positive\nconsequences (like attention from peers), then the student may imitate the negative behaviors (Rebellon, 2006).\nCursing and swearing, and even bullying or vandalism, can be reinforced vicariously, just as can more desired\nbehaviors.\nModeling\u2014in this first sense of a demonstration\u2014connects instructional goals to students\u2019 experiences by\npresenting real, vivid examples of behaviors or skills in a way that a student can practice directly, rather than\nmerely talk about. There is often little need, when imitating a model, to translate ideas or instructions from verbal\nform into action. For students struggling with language and literacy, in particular, this feature can be a real\nadvantage.\nModeling\u2014as simplified representation\nIn a second meaning of modeling, a model is a simplified representation of a phenomenon that incorporates\nthe important properties of the phenomenon. Models in this sense may sometimes be quite tangible, direct copies\nof reality; when I was in fourth grade growing up in California, for example, we made scale models of the Spanish\nmissions as part of our social studies lessons about California history. But models can also be imaginary, though\nstill based on familiar elements. In a science curriculum, for example, the behavior of gas molecules under pressure\ncan be modeled by imagining the molecules as ping pong balls flying about and colliding in an empty room.\nReducing the space available to the gas by making the room smaller, causes the ping pong balls to collide more\nfrequently and vigorously, and thereby increases the pressure on the walls of the room. Increasing the space has the\nopposite effect. Creating an actual room full of ping pong balls may be impractical, of course, but the model can still\nbe imagined.\nEducational Psychology 230 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nModeling in this second sense is not about altering students\u2019 behavior, but about increasing their understanding\nof a newly learned idea, theory, or phenomenon. The model itself uses objects or events that are already familiar to\nstudents\u2014simple balls and their behavior when colliding\u2014and in this way supports students\u2019 learning of new,\nunfamiliar material. Not every new concept or idea lends itself to such modeling, but many do: students can create\nmodels of unfamiliar animals, for example, or of medieval castles, or of ecological systems. Two-dimensional\nmodels\u2014essentially drawings\u2014can also be helpful: students can illustrate literature or historical events, or make\nmaps of their own neighborhoods. The choice of model depends largely on the specific curriculum goals which the\nteacher needs to accomplish at a particular time.\nActivating prior knowledge\nAnother way to connect curriculum goals to students\u2019 experience is by activating prior knowledge, a term\nthat refers to encouraging students to recall what they know already about new material being learned. Various\nformats for activating prior knowledge are possible. When introducing a unit about how biologists classify animal\nand plant species, for example, a teacher can invite students to discuss how they already classify different kinds of\nplants and animals. Having highlighted this informal knowledge, the teacher can then explore how the same species\nare classified by biological scientists, and compare the scientists\u2019 classification schemes to the students\u2019 own\nschemes. The activation does not have to happen orally, as in this example; a teacher can also ask students to write\ndown as many distinct types of animals and plants that they can think of, and then ask students to diagram or map\ntheir relationships\u2014essentially creating a concept map like the ones we described in Chapter 8 (Gurlitt, et al.,\n2006). Whatever the strategy used, activation helps by making students\u2019 prior knowledge or experience conscious\nand therefore easier to link to new concepts or information.\nAnticipating preconceptions of students\nIronically, activating students\u2019 prior knowledge can be a mixed blessing if some of the prior knowledge is\nmisleading or downright wrong. Misleading or erroneous knowledge is especially common among young students,\nbut it can happen at any grade level. A kindergarten child may think that the sun literally \u201crises\u201d in the morning,\nsince she often hears adults use this expression, or that the earth is flat because it obviously looks flat. But a high\nschool student may mistakenly believe that large objects (a boulder) fall faster than small ones (a pebble), or that a\nheavy object dropped (not thrown) from a moving car window will fall straight down instead of traveling laterally\nalongside the car while it falls.\nBecause misconceptions are quite common among students and even among adults, teachers are more effective\nif they can anticipate preconceptions of students wherever possible. The task is twofold. First the teacher\nmust know or at least guess students\u2019 preconceptions as much as possible in advance, so that she can design\nlearning activities to counteract and revise their thinking. Some preconceptions have been well-documented by\neducational research and therefore can in principle be anticipated easily\u2014though they may still sometimes take a\nteacher by surprise during a busy activity or lesson (Tanner & Allen, 2005; Chiu & Lin, 2005). Exhibit 9.8 lists a few\nof these common preconceptions. Others may be unique to particular students, however, and a teacher may only by\nable to learn of them through experience\u2014by listening carefully to what students say and write and by watching\nwhat they do. A few preconceptions may be so ingrained or tied to other, more deeply held beliefs that students may\nresist giving them up, either consciously or unconsciously. It may be hard, for example, for some students to give up\n231 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthe idea that girls are less talented at math or science than are boys, even though research generally finds this is not\nthe case (Hyde & Linn, 2006).\nTable 34: Several misconceptions about science\nMisconception What to do\nStars and constellations appear in the same place in Ask students to observe carefully the locations of a\nthe sky every night. bright star once a week for several weeks.\nThe world is flat, circular like a pancake.

Clark, 2006; Slotta & Chi, 2006; Owens, 2003.\nThe second task when anticipating preconceptions is to treat students\u2019 existing knowledge and beliefs with\nrespect even when they do include misconceptions or errors. This may seem obvious in principle, but it needs\nremembering when students persist with misconceptions in spite of a teacher\u2019s efforts to teach alternative ideas or\nconcepts. Most of us\u2014including most students\u2014have reasons for holding our beliefs, even when the beliefs do not\nagree with teachers, textbooks, or other authorities, and we appreciate having our beliefs treated with respect.\nStudents are no different from other people in this regard. In a high school biology class, for example, some\nstudents may have personal reasons for not agreeing with the theory of evolution associated with Charles Darwin.\nFor religious reasons they may support explanations of the origins of life that give a more active, interventionist\nrole to God (Brumfiel, 2005). If their beliefs disagree with the teacher\u2019s or the textbook, then the disagreement\nneeds to be acknowledged, but acknowledged respectfully. For some students (and perhaps some teachers),\nexpressing fundamental disagreement respectfully may feel awkward, but it needs to be done nonetheless.\nEducational Psychology 232 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nGuided practice, independent practice, and homework\nSo far, we have focused on bridging the goals or content of a curriculum to events, beliefs, and ideas from\nstudents\u2019 lives. In studying human growth in a health class, for example, a teacher might ask students to bring\nphotos of themselves as a much younger child. In this case a concept from the curriculum\u2014human growth\u2014then is\nrelated to a personal event, being photographed as a youngster, that the student finds meaningful.\nBut teachers can also create bridges between curriculum and students\u2019 experiences in another way, by relating\nthe process of learning in school with the process of learning outside of school. Much of this task involves helping\nstudents to make the transition from supervised learning to self-regulated learning\u2014or put differently, from\npractice that is relatively guided to practice that is relatively independent.\nGuided practice\nWhen students first learn a new skill or a new set of ideas, they are especially likely to encounter problems and\nmake mistakes that interfere with the very process of learning. In figuring out how to use a new software program,\nfor example, a student may unknowingly press a wrong button that prevents further functioning of the program. In\ntranslating sentences from Spanish into English in language class, for another example, a student might\nmisinterpret one particular word or grammatical feature. This one mistake may cause many sentences to be\ntranslated incorrectly, and so on. So students initially need guided practice\u2014opportunities to work somewhat\nindependently, but with a teacher or other expert close at hand prevent or fix difficulties when they occur. In\ngeneral, educational research has found that guided practice helps all learners, but especially those who are\nstruggling (Bryan & Burstein, 2004: Woodward, 2004). A first-grade child has difficulty in decoding printed words,\nfor example, benefits from guidance more than one who can decode easily. But both students benefit in the initial\nstages of learning, since both may make more mistakes then. Guided practice, by its nature, sends a dual message to\nstudents: it is important to learn new material well, but it is also important to become able to use learning without\nassistance, beyond the lesson where it is learned and even beyond the classroom.\nGuided practice is much like the concepts of the zone of proximal development (or ZPD) and instructional\nscaffolding that we discussed in Chapter 2 in connection with Vygotsky\u2019s theory of learning. In essence, during\nguided practice the teacher creates a ZPD or scaffold (or framework) in which the student can accomplish more\nwith partial knowledge or skill than the student could accomplish alone. But whatever its name\u2014guided practice, a\nZPD, or a scaffold\u2014insuring success of guidance depends on several key elements: focusing on the task at hand,\nasking questions that break the task into manageable parts, reframing or restating the task so that it becomes more\nunderstandable, and giving frequent feedback about the student\u2019s progress (Rogoff, 2003). Combining the elements\nappropriately takes sensitivity and improvisational skill\u2014even artfulness\u2014but these very challenges are among the\ntrue joys of teaching.\nIndependent practice\nAs students gain facility with a new skill or new knowledge, they tend to need less guidance and more time to\nconsolidate (or strengthen) their new knowledge with additional practice. Since they are less likely to encounter\nmistakes or problems at this point, they begin to benefit from independent practice\u2014opportunities to review\nand repeat their knowledge at their own pace and with fewer interruptions. At this point, therefore, guided practice\nmay feel less like help than like an interruption, even if it is well-intentioned. A student who already knows how to\n233 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nuse a new computer program, for example, may be frustrated by waiting for the teacher to explain each step of the\nprogram individually. If a student is already skillful at translating Spanish sentences into English in a language\nclass, it can be annoying for the teacher to \u201chelp\u201d by pointing out minor errors that the student is likely to catch for\nherself.\nBy definition, the purpose of independent practice is to provide more self-regulation of learning than what\ncomes from guided practice. It implies a different message for students than what is conveyed by guided practice, a\nmessage that goes beyond the earlier one: that it is now time to take more complete responsibility for own learning.\nWhen all goes well, independent practice is the eventual outcome of the zone of proximal development created\nduring the earlier phase of guided practice described above: the student can now do on his or her own, what\noriginally required assistance from someone else. Or stated differently, independent practice is a way of\nencouraging self-determination about learning, in the sense that we discussed this idea in Chapter 6. In order to\nwork independently, a student must set his or her own direction and monitor his or her own success; by definition,\nno one can do this for the student.\nHomework\nThe chances are that you already have experienced many forms of homework in your own educational career.\nThe widespread practice of assigning review work to do outside of school is a way of supplementing scarce time in\nclass and of providing independent practice for students. Homework has generated controversy throughout most of\nits history in public education, partly because it encroaches on students\u2019 personal and family-oriented time, and\npartly because research finds no consistent benefits of doing homework (Gill & Schlossman, 2004; Kohn, 2004). In\nspite of these criticisms, though, parents and teachers tend to favor homework when it is used for two main\npurposes. One purpose is to review and practice material that has already been introduced and practiced at school;\na sheet of arithmetic problems might be a classic example. When used for this purpose, the amount of homework is\nusually minimal in the earliest grades, if any is assigned at all. One educational expert recommends only ten\nminutes per day in first grade at most, and only gradual increases in amount as students get older (Cooper &\nValentine, 2001).\nThe second purpose for supporting homework is to convey the idea of schoolwork being the \u201cjob\u201d of childhood\nand youth. Just as on an adult job, students must complete homework tasks with minimal supervision and\nsometimes even minimal training. Doing the tasks, furthermore, is a way to get ahead or further along in the work\nplace (for an adult) or at school (for a child). One study in which researchers interviewed children about these ideas,\nin fact, found that children do indeed regard homework as work in the same way that adults think of a job (Cornu &\nXu, 2004). In the children\u2019s minds, homework tasks were not \u201cfun\u201d, in spite of teachers\u2019 frequent efforts to make\nthem fun. Instead they were jobs that needed doing, much like household chores. When it came to homework,\nchildren regarded parents as the teachers\u2019 assistants\u2014people merely carrying out the wishes of the teacher. Like any\njob, the job of doing homework varied in stressfulness; when required at an appropriate amount and level of\ndifficulty, and when children reported having good \u201cbosses\u201d (parents and teachers), the job of homework could\nactually be satisfying in the way that many adults\u2019 jobs can be satisfying when well-done.\nEducational Psychology 234 A Global Text 10. Planning instruction\nPlanning for instruction as well as for learning\nThis chapter started with one premise but ended with another. It started with the idea that teachers need to\nlocate curriculum goals, usually from a state department of education or a publisher of a curriculum document. In\nmuch of the chapter we described what these authorities provide for individual classroom teachers, and how their\ndocuments can be clarified and rendered specific enough for classroom use. In the middle of the chapter, however,\nthe premise shifted. We began noting that instruction cannot be planned simply for students; teachers also need to\nconsider involving students themselves in influencing or even choosing their own goals and ways of reaching the\ngoals. Instructional planning, in other words, should not be just for students, but also by students, at least to some\nextent. In the final parts of the chapter we described a number of ways of achieving a reasonable balance between\nteachers\u2019 and students\u2019 influence on their learning. We suggested considering relatively strong measures, such as an\nemergent or an anti-bias curriculum, but we also considered more moderate ones, like the use of the Internet, of\nlocal experts and field trips, of service learning, and of guided and independent practice. All things considered,\nthen, teachers\u2019 planning is not just about organizing teaching; it is also about facilitating learning. Its dual purpose\nis evident in many features of public education, including the one we discuss in the next two chapters, the\nassessment of learning.\nChapter summary\nIn the United States, broad educational goals for most subject areas are published by many national\nprofessional associations and by all state departments of education. Usually the state departments of education also\npublish curriculum framework or curriculum guides that offer somewhat more specific explanations of educational\ngoals, and how they might be taught.\nTransforming the goals into specific learning objectives, however, remains a responsibility of the teacher. The\nformulation can focus on curriculum topics that can analyzed into specific activities, or it can focus on specific\nbehaviors expected of students and assembled into general types of outcomes. Taxonomies of educational\nobjectives, such as the ones originated by Benjamin Bloom, are a useful tool with either approach to instructional\nplanning.\nIn addition to planning instruction on students\u2019 behalf, many teachers organize instruction so that students\nthemselves can influence the choice of goals. One way to do so is through emergent curriculum; another way is\nthrough multicultural and anti-bias curriculum.\nWhatever planning strategies are used, learning is enhanced by using a wide variety of resources, including the\nInternet, local experts, field trips, and service learning, among others. It is also enhanced if the teacher can build\nbridges between curriculum goals and students\u2019 experiences through judicious use of modeling, activation of prior\nknowledge, anticipation of students\u2019 preconceptions, and an appropriate blend of guided and independent practice.\nKey terms\nAffective objectives\nAnti-bias education\nBloom\u2019s taxonomy\nContent integration\nCurriculum framework\nCurriculum guide\n235 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nEducational goals\nEmergent curriculum\nEquity pedagogy\nGuided practice\nIndependent practice\nIndicators\nInstructional planning\nLearning commons\nLearning objectives\nModeling as demonstration\nModeling as simplified representation\nMulticultural education\nNational standards\nPsychomotor objectives\nScope and sequence\nService learning\nState standards\nTaxonomy of educational objectives\nOn the Internet\n<http://med.fsu.edu/education/FacultyDevelopment/objectives.asp>\n<http://www.adprima.com/objectives.htm>\nThese are two of many websites that explains what behavioral objectives are, and how to write them.

Teacher-made\nassessment strategies\nKym teaches sixth grade students in an urban school where most of the families in the community\nlive below the poverty line. Each year the majority of the students in her school fail the state-wide\ntests. Kym follows school district teaching guides and typically uses direct instruction in her\nLanguage Arts and Social Studies classes. The classroom assessments are designed to mirror those\non the state-wide tests so the students become familiar with the assessment format. When Kym is in a\ngraduate summer course on motivation she reads an article called, \u201cTeaching strategies that honor\nand motivate inner-city African American students\u201d (Teel, Debrin-Parecki, & Covington, 1998) and\nshe decides to change her instruction and assessment in fall in four ways. First, she stresses an\nincremental approach to ability focusing on effort and allows students to revise their work several\ntimes until the criteria are met. Second, she gives students choices in performance assessments (e.g.\noral presentation, art project, creative writing). Third, she encourages responsibility by asking\nstudents to assist in classroom tasks such as setting up video equipment, handing out papers etc.\nFourth, she validates student\u2019 cultural heritage by encouraging them to read biographies and\nhistorical fiction from their own cultural backgrounds. Kym reports that the changes in her students\u2019\neffort and demeanor in class are dramatic: students are more enthusiastic, work harder, and\nproduce better products. At the end of the year twice as many of her students pass the State-wide test\nthan the previous year.\nAfterward. Kym still teaches sixth grade in the same school district and continues to modify the\nstrategies described above. Even though the performance of the students she taught improved the\nschool was closed because, on average, the students\u2019 performance was poor. Kym gained a Ph.D and\nteaches Educational Psychology to preservice and inservice teachers in evening classes.\nKym\u2019s story illustrates several themes related to assessment that we explore in this chapter on teacher-made\nassessment strategies and in the Chapter 12 on standardized testing. First, choosing effective classroom\nassessments is related to instructional practices, beliefs about motivation, and the presence of state-wide\nstandardized testing. Second, some teacher-made classroom assessments enhance student learning and motivation\n\u2014some do not. Third, teachers can improve their teaching through action research. This involves identifying a\nproblem (e.g. low motivation and achievement), learning about alternative approaches (e.g. reading the literature),\nimplementing the new approaches, observing the results (e.g. students\u2019 effort and test results), and continuing to\nmodify the strategies based on their observations.\nBest practices in assessing student learning have undergone dramatic changes in the last 20 years. When\nRosemary was a mathematics teacher in the 1970s, she did not assess students\u2019 learning she tested them on the\nEducational Psychology 240 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nmathematics knowledge and skills she taught during the previous weeks. The tests varied little format and students\nalways did them individually with pencil and paper. Many teachers, including mathematics teachers, now use a\nwide variety of methods to determine what their students have learned and also use this assessment information to\nmodify their instruction. In this chapter the focus is on using classroom assessments to improve student learning\nand we begin with some basic concepts.\nBasic concepts\nAssessment is an integrated process of gaining information about students\u2019 learning and making value\njudgments about their progress (Linn & Miller, 2005). Information about students\u2019 progress can be obtained from\na variety of sources including projects, portfolios, performances, observations, and tests. The information about\nstudents\u2019 learning is often assigned specific numbers or grades and this involves measurement. Measurement\nanswers the question, \u201cHow much?\u201d and is used most commonly when the teacher scores a test or product and\nassigns numbers (e.g. 28 /30 on the biology test; 90/100 on the science project). Evaluation is the process of\nmaking judgments about the assessment information (Airasian, 2005). These judgments may be about individual\nstudents (e.g. should Jacob\u2019s course grade take into account his significant improvement over the grading period?),\nthe assessment method used (e.g. is the multiple choice test a useful way to obtain information about problem\nsolving), or one\u2019s own teaching (e.g. most of the students this year did much better on the essay assignment than\nlast year so my new teaching methods seem effective).\nThe primary focus in this chapter is on assessment for learning, where the priority is designing and using\nassessment strategies to enhance student learning and development. Assessment for learning is often formative\nassessment, i.e. it takes place during the course of instruction by providing information that teachers can use to\nrevise their teaching and students can use to improve their learning (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall & Wiliam,\n2004). Formative assessment includes both informal assessment involving spontaneous unsystematic\nobservations of students\u2019 behaviors (e.g. during a question and answer session or while the students are working on\nan assignment) and formal assessment involving pre-planned, systematic gathering of data. Assessment of\nlearning is formal assessment that involves assessing students in order to certify their competence and fulfill\naccountability mandates and is the primary focus of the next chapter on standardized tests but is also considered in\nthis chapter. Assessment of learning is typically summative, that is, administered after the instruction is\ncompleted (e.g. a final examination in an educational psychology course). Summative assessments provide\ninformation about how well students mastered the material, whether students are ready for the next unit, and what\ngrades should be given (Airasian, 2005).\nAssessment for learning: an overview of the process\nUsing assessment to advance students\u2019 learning not just check on learning requires viewing assessment as a\nprocess that is integral to the all phases of teaching including planning, classroom interactions and instruction,\ncommunication with parents, and self-reflection (Stiggins, 2002). Essential steps in assessment for learning\ninclude:\nStep 1: Having clear instructional goals and communicating them to students\nIn the previous chapter we documented the importance of teachers thinking carefully about the purposes of each\nlesson and unit. This may be hard for beginning teachers. For example, Vanessa, a middle school social studies\n241 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nteacher, might say that the goal of her next unit is: \u201cStudents will learn about the Cvil War.\u201d Clearer goals require\nthat Vanessa decides what it is about the US Civil War she wants her students to learn, e.g. the dates and names of\nbattles, the causes of the US Civil War, the differing perspectives of those living in the North and the South, or the\nday-to-day experiences of soldiers fighting in the war. Vanessa cannot devise appropriate assessments of her\nstudents\u2019 learning about the US Civil War until she is clear about her own purposes.\nFor effective teaching Vanessa also needs to communicate clearly the goals and objectives to her students so they\nknow what is important for them to learn. No matter how thorough a teacher\u2019s planning has been, if students do\nnot know what they are supposed to learn they will not learn as much. Because communication is so important to\nteachers a specific chapter is devoted to this topic (Chapter 8), and so communication is not considered in any\ndetail in this chapter.\nStep 2: Selecting appropriate assessment techniques\nSelecting and administrating assessment techniques that are appropriate for the goals of instruction as well as\nthe developmental level of the students are crucial components of effective assessment for learning. Teachers need\nto know the characteristics of a wide variety of classroom assessment techniques and how these techniques can be\nadapted for various content, skills, and student characteristics. They also should understand the role reliability,\nvalidity, and the absence of bias should play is choosing and using assessment techniques. Much of this chapter\nfocuses on this information.\nStep 3: Using assessment to enhance motivation and confidence\nStudents\u2019 motivation and confidence is influenced by the type of assessment used as well as the feedback given\nabout the assessment results. Consider, Samantha a college student who takes a history class in which the\nprofessor\u2019s lectures and text book focus on really interesting major themes. However, the assessments are all\nmultiple choice tests that ask about facts and Samantha, who initially enjoys the classes and readings, becomes\nangry, loses confidence she can do well, and begins to spend less time on the class material. In contrast, some\ninstructors have observed that that many students in educational psychology classes like the one you are now taking\nwill work harder on assessments that are case studies rather than more traditional exams or essays. The type of\nfeedback provided to students is also important and we elaborate on these ideas later in this chapter.\nStep 4: Adjusting instruction based on information\nAn essential component of assessment for learning is that the teacher uses the information gained from\nassessment to adjust instruction. These adjustments occur in the middle of a lesson when a teacher may decide that\nstudents\u2019 responses to questions indicate sufficient understanding to introduce a new topic, or that her observations\nof students\u2019 behavior indicates that they do not understand the assignment and so need further explanation.\nAdjustments also occur when the teacher reflects on the instruction after the lesson is over and is planning for the\nnext day. We provide examples of adjusting instruction in this chapter and consider teacher reflection in more\ndetail in Appendix C..\nStep 5: Communicating with parents and guardians\nStudents\u2019 learning and development is enhanced when teachers communicate with parents regularly about their\nchildren\u2019s performance. Teachers communicate with parents in a variety of ways including newsletters, telephone\nEducational Psychology 242 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nconversations, email, school district websites and parent-teachers conferences. Effective communication requires\nthat teachers can clearly explain the purpose and characteristics of the assessment as well as the meaning of\nstudents\u2019 performance. This requires a thorough knowledge of the types and purposes of teacher made and\nstandardized assessments (this chapter and Chapter 12) and well as clear communication skills (Chapter 8).\nWe now consider each step in the process of assessment for learning in more detail. In order to be able to select\nand administer appropriate assessment techniques teachers need to know about the variety of techniques that can\nbe used as well as what factors ensure that the assessment techniques are high quality. We begin by considering\nhigh quality assessments.\nSelecting appropriate assessment techniques I: high quality assessments\nFor an assessment to be high quality it needs to have good validity and reliability as well as absence from bias.\nValidity\nValidity is the evaluation of the \u201cadequacy and appropriateness of the interpretations and uses of assessment\nresults\u201d for a given group of individuals (Linn & Miller, 2005, p. 68). For example, is it appropriate to conclude that\nthe results of a mathematics test on fractions given to recent immigrants accurately represents their understanding\nof fractions? Is it appropriate for the teacher to conclude, based on her observations, that a kindergarten student,\nJasmine, has Attention Deficit Disorder because she does not follow the teachers oral instructions? Obviously in\neach situation other interpretations are possible that the immigrant students have poor English skills rather than\nmathematics skills, or that Jasmine may be hearing impaired.\nIt is important to understand that validity refers to the interpretation and uses made of the results of an\nassessment procedure not of the assessment procedure itself. For example, making judgments about the results of\nthe same test on fractions may be valid if the students all understand English well. A teacher concluding from her\nobservations that the kindergarten student has Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) may be appropriate if the student\nhas been screened for hearing and other disorders (although the classification of a disorder like ADD cannot be\nmade by one teacher). Validity involves making an overall judgment of the degree to which the interpretations and\nuses of the assessment results are justified. Validity is a matter of degree (e.g. high, moderate, or low validity)\nrather than all-or none (e.g. totally valid vs invalid) (Linn & Miller, 2005).\nThree sources of evidence are considered when assessing validity\u2014content, construct and predictive. Content\nvalidity evidence is associated with the question: How well does the assessment include the content or tasks it is\nsupposed to? For example, suppose your educational psychology instructor devises a mid-term test and tells you\nthis includes chapters one to seven in the text book. Obviously, all the items in test should be based on the content\nfrom educational psychology, not your methods or cultural foundations classes. Also, the items in the test should\ncover content from all seven chapters and not just chapters three to seven\u2014unless the instructor tells you that these\nchapters have priority.\nTeachers\u2019 have to be clear about their purposes and priorities for instruction before they can begin to gather\nevidence related content validity. Content validation determines the degree that assessment tasks are relevant and\nrepresentative of the tasks judged by the teacher (or test developer) to represent their goals and objectives (Linn &\nMiller, 2005). It is important for teachers to think about content validation when devising assessment tasks and\none way to help do this is to devise a Table of Specifications. An example, based on Pennsylvania\u2019s State standards\n243 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nfor grade 3 geography, is in . In the left hand column is the instructional content for a 20-item test the teacher has\ndecided to construct with two kinds of instructional objectives: identification and uses or locates. The second and\nthird columns identify the number of items for each content area and each instructional objective. Notice that the\nteacher has decided that six items should be devoted to the sub area of geographic representations- more than any\nother sub area. Devising a table of specifications helps teachers determine if some content areas or concepts are\nover-sampled (i.e. there are too many items) and some concepts are under-sampled (i.e. there are too few items).\nTable 35: Example of Table of Specifications: grade 3 basic geography literacy\nContent Instructional objective Total Per cent\nnumber of of items\nIdentifies Uses or\nitems\nlocates\nIdentify geography tools and their uses\nGeographic representations: e.g. maps,\n3 3 6 30%\nglobe, diagrams and photographs\nSpatial information: sketch & thematic\n1 1 2 10%\nmaps\nMental maps 1 1 2 10%\nIdentify and locate places and regions\nPhysical features (e.g. lakes, continents) 1 2 3 15%\nHuman features (countries, states, cities) 3 2 5 25%\nRegions with unifying geographic\n1 1 2 10%\ncharacteristics e.g. river basins\nNumber of items 10 10 20\nPercentage of items 50% 50% 100%\nConstruct validity evidence is more complex than content validity evidence. Often we are interested in making\nbroader judgments about student\u2019s performances than specific skills such as doing fractions. The focus may be on\nconstructs such as mathematical reasoning or reading comprehension. A construct is a characteristic of a person we\nassume exists to help explain behavior. For example, we use the concept of test anxiety to explain why some\nindividuals when taking a test have difficulty concentrating, have physiological reactions such as sweating, and\nperform poorly on tests but not in class assignments. Similarly mathematics reasoning and reading comprehension\nare constructs as we use them to help explain performance on an assessment. Construct validation is the process of\ndetermining the extent to which performance on an assessment can be interpreted in terms of the intended\nconstructs and is not influenced by factors irrelevant to the construct. For example, judgments about recent\nEducational Psychology 244 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nimmigrants\u2019 performance on a mathematical reasoning test administered in English will have low construct validity\nif the results are influenced by English language skills that are irrelevant to mathematical problem solving.\nSimilarly, construct validity of end-of-semester examinations is likely to be poor for those students who are highly\nanxious when taking major tests but not during regular class periods or when doing assignments. Teachers can help\nincrease construct validity by trying to reduce factors that influence performance but are irrelevant to the construct\nbeing assessed. These factors include anxiety, English language skills, and reading speed (Linn & Miller 2005).\nA third form of validity evidence is called criterion-related validity. Selective colleges in the USA use the\nACT or SAT among other criteria to choose who will be admitted because these standardized tests help predict\nfreshman grades, i.e. have high criterion-related validity. Some K-12 schools give students math or reading tests in\nthe fall semester in order to predict which are likely to do well on the annual state tests administered in the spring\nsemester and which students are unlikely to pass the tests and will need additional assistance. If the tests\nadministered in fall do not predict students\u2019 performances accurately then the additional assistance may be given to\nthe wrong students illustrating the importance of criterion-related validity.\nReliability\nReliability refers to the consistency of the measurement (Linn & Miller 2005). Suppose Mr Garcia is teaching a\nunit on food chemistry in his tenth grade class and gives an assessment at the end of the unit using test items from\nthe teachers\u2019 guide. Reliability is related to questions such as: How similar would the scores of the students be if\nthey had taken the assessment on a Friday or Monday? Would the scores have varied if Mr Garcia had selected\ndifferent test items, or if a different teacher had graded the test? An assessment provides information about\nstudents by using a specific measure of performance at one particular time. Unless the results from the assessment\nare reasonably consistent over different occasions, different raters, or different tasks (in the same content domain)\nconfidence in the results will be low and so cannot be useful in improving student learning.\nObviously we cannot expect perfect consistency. Students\u2019 memory, attention, fatigue, effort, and anxiety\nfluctuate and so influence performance. Even trained raters vary somewhat when grading assessment such as\nessays, a science project, or an oral presentation. Also, the wording and design of specific items influence students\u2019\nperformances. However, some assessments are more reliable than others and there are several strategies teachers\ncan use to increase reliability\nFirst, assessments with more tasks or items typically have higher reliability. To understand this, consider two\ntests one with five items and one with 50 items. Chance factors influence the shorter test more then the longer test.\nIf a student does not understand one of the items in the first test the total score is very highly influenced (it would\nbe reduced by 20 per cent). In contrast, if there was one item in the test with 50 items that were confusing, the total\nscore would be influenced much less (by only 2 percent). Obviously this does not mean that assessments should be\ninordinately long, but, on average, enough tasks should be included to reduce the influence of chance variations.\nSecond, clear directions and tasks help increase reliability. If the directions or wording of specific tasks or items are\nunclear, then students have to guess what they mean undermining the accuracy of their results. Third, clear scoring\ncriteria are crucial in ensuring high reliability (Linn & Miller, 2005). Later in this chapter we describe strategies for\ndeveloping scoring criteria for a variety of types of assessment.\n245 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAbsence of bias\nBias occurs in assessment when there are components in the assessment method or administration of the\nassessment that distort the performance of the student because of their personal characteristics such as gender,\nethnicity, or social class (Popham, 2005). Two types of assessment bias are important: offensiveness and unfair\npenalization. An assessment is most likely to be offensive to a subgroup of students when negative stereotypes are\nincluded in the test. For example, the assessment in a health class could include items in which all the doctors were\nmen and all the nurses were women. Or, a series of questions in a social studies class could portray Latinos and\nAsians as immigrants rather than native born Americans. In these examples, some female, Latino or Asian students\nare likely to be offended by the stereotypes and this can distract them from performing well on the assessment.\nUnfair penalization occurs when items disadvantage one group not because they may be offensive but because of\ndifferential background experiences. For example, an item for math assessment that assumes knowledge of a\nparticular sport may disadvantage groups not as familiar with that sport (e.g. American football for recent\nimmigrants). Or an assessment on team work that asks students to model their concept of a team on a symphony\norchestra is likely to be easier for those students who have attended orchestra performances\u2014probably students\nfrom affluent families. Unfair penalization does not occur just because some students do poorly in class. For\nexample, asking questions about a specific sport in a physical education class when information on that sport had\nbeen discussed in class is not unfair penalization as long as the questions do not require knowledge beyond that\ntaught in class that some groups are less likely to have.\nIt can be difficult for new teachers teaching in multi-ethnic classrooms to devise interesting assessments that do\nnot penalize any groups of students. Teachers need to think seriously about the impact of students\u2019 differing\nbackgrounds on the assessment they use in class. Listening carefully to what students say is important as is learning\nabout the backgrounds of the students.\nSelecting appropriate assessment techniques II: types of teacher-made assessments\nOne of the challenges for beginning teachers is to select and use appropriate assessment techniques. In this\nsection we summarize the wide variety of types of assessments that classroom teachers use. First we discuss the\ninformal techniques teachers use during instruction that typically require instantaneous decisions. Then we\nconsider formal assessment techniques that teachers plan before instruction and allow for reflective decisions.\nTeachers\u2019 observation, questioning, and record keeping\nDuring teaching, teachers not only have to communicate the information they planned but also continuously\nmonitor students\u2019 learning and motivation in order to determine whether modifications have to be made (Airasian,\n2005). Beginning teachers find this more difficult than experienced teachers because of the complex cognitive skills\nrequired to improvise and be responsive to students needs while simultaneously keeping in mind the goals and\nplans of the lesson (Borko & Livingston, 1989). The informal assessment strategies teachers most often use during\ninstruction are observation and questioning.\nObservation\nEffective teachers observe their students from the time they enter the classroom. Some teachers greet their\nstudents at the door not only to welcome them but also to observe their mood and motivation. Are Hannah and\nNaomi still not talking to each other? Does Ethan have his materials with him? Gaining information on such\nEducational Psychology 246 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nquestions can help the teacher foster student learning more effectively (e.g. suggesting Ethan goes back to his locker\nto get his materials before the bell rings or avoiding assigning Hannah and Naomi to the same group).\nDuring instruction, teachers observe students\u2019 behavior to gain information about students\u2019 level of interest and\nunderstanding of the material or activity. Observation includes looking at non-verbal behaviors as well as listening\nto what the students are saying. For example, a teacher may observe that a number of students are looking out of\nthe window rather than watching the science demonstration, or a teacher may hear students making comments in\ntheir group indicating they do not understand what they are supposed to be doing. Observations also help teachers\ndecide which student to call on next, whether to speed up or slow down the pace of the lesson, when more examples\nare needed, whether to begin or end an activity, how well students are performing a physical activity, and if there\nare potential behavior problems (Airasian, 2005). Many teachers find that moving around the classroom helps\nthem observe more effectively because they can see more students from a variety of perspectives. However, the fast\npace and complexity of most classrooms makes it difficult for teachers to gain as much information as they want.\nQuestioning\nTeachers ask questions for many instructional reasons including keeping students\u2019 attention on the lesson,\nhighlighting important points and ideas, promoting critical thinking, allowing students\u2019 to learn from each others\nanswers, and providing information about students\u2019 learning. Devising good appropriate questions and using\nstudents\u2019 responses to make effective instantaneous instructional decisions is very difficult. Some strategies to\nimprove questioning include planning and writing down the instructional questions that will be asked, allowing\nsufficient wait time for students to respond, listening carefully to what students say rather than listening for what is\nexpected, varying the types of questions asked, making sure some of the questions are higher level, and asking\nfollow-up questions.\nWhile the informal assessment based on spontaneous observation and questioning is essential for teaching there\nare inherent problems with the validity, reliability and bias in this information (Airasian, 2005; Stiggins 2005). We\nsummarize these issues and some ways to reduce the problems in Table 35.\nTable 36: Validity and reliability of observation and questioning\nProblem Strategies to alleviate problem\nTeachers lack of objectivity Try to make sure you are not only seeing what you want to see. Teachers\nabout overall class typically want to feel good about their instruction so it is easy to look for positive\ninvolvement and student interactions. Occasionally, teachers want to see negative student\nunderstanding reactions to confirm their beliefs about an individual student or class.\nTendency to focus on Remember to concentrate on student learning not just involvement. Most of\nprocess rather than learning teachers\u2019 observations focus on process\u2014student attention, facial expressions\nposture\u2014rather than pupil learning. Students can be active and engaged but not\ndeveloping new skills.\nLimited information and Make sure you observe a variety of students\u2014not just those who are typically\nselective sampling very good or very bad.\n247 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nWalk around the room to observe more students \u201cup close\u201d and view the room\nfrom multiple perspectives.\nCall on a wide variety of students\u2014not just those with their hands up, or those\nwho are skilled as the subject, or those who sit in a particular place in the room.\nKeep records\nFast pace of classrooms If you want to know if you are missing important information ask a peer to visit\ninhibits corroborative your classroom and observe the students\u2019 behaviors. Classrooms are complex and\nevidence fast paced and one teacher cannot see much of what is going on while trying to\nalso teach.\nCultural and individual Be cautious in the conclusions that you draw from your observations and\ndifferences in the meaning of questions. Remember that the meaning and expectations of certain types of\nverbal and non verbal questions, wait time, social distance, and role of \u201csmall talk\u201d varies across\nbehaviors cultures (Chapter 4). Some students are quiet because of their personalities not\nbecause they are uninvolved, nor keeping up with the lesson, nor depressed or\ntired.\nRecord keeping\nKeeping records of observations improves reliability and can be used to enhance understanding of one student, a\ngroup, or the whole class' interactions. Sometimes this requires help from other teachers. For example, Alexis, a\nbeginning science teacher is aware of the research documenting that longer wait time enhances students\u2019 learning\n(e.g. Rowe, 2003) but is unsure of her behaviors so she asks a colleague to observe and record her wait times\nduring one class period. Alexis learns her wait times are very short for all students so she starts practicing silently\ncounting to five whenever she asks students a question.\nTeachers can keep anecdotal records about students without help from peers. These records contain\ndescriptions of incidents of a student\u2019s behavior, the time and place the incident takes place, and a tentative\ninterpretation of the incident. For example, the description of the incident might involve Joseph, a second grade\nstudent, who fell asleep during the mathematics class on a Monday morning. A tentative interpretation could be the\nstudent did not get enough sleep over the weekend, but alternative explanations could be the student is sick or is on\nmedications that make him drowsy. Obviously additional information is needed and the teacher could ask Joseph\nwhy he is so sleepy and also observe him to see if he looks tired and sleepy over the next couple of weeks.\nAnecdotal records often provide important information and are better than relying on one\u2019s memory but they\ntake time to maintain and it is difficult for teachers to be objective. For example, after seeing Joseph fall asleep the\nteacher may now look for any signs of Joseph\u2019s sleepiness\u2014ignoring the days he is not sleepy. Also, it is hard for\nteachers to sample a wide enough range of data for their observations to be highly reliable.\nTeachers also conduct more formal observations especially for students with special needs who have IEP\u2019s. An\nexample of the importance of informal and formal observations in a preschool follows:\nEducational Psychology 248 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nThe class of preschoolers in a suburban neighborhood of a large city has eight special needs students\nand four students\u2014the peer models\u2014who have been selected because of their well developed\nlanguage and social skills. Some of the special needs students have been diagnosed with delayed\nlanguage, some with behavior disorders, and several with autism. The students are sitting on the\nmat with the teacher who has a box with sets of three \u201ccool\u201d things of varying size (e.g. toy pandas)\nand the students are asked to put the things in order by size, big, medium and small. Students who\nare able are also requested to point to each item in turn and say \u201cThis is the big one\u201d, \u201cThis is the\nmedium one\u201d and \u201cThis is the little one\u201d. For some students, only two choices (big and little) are\noffered because that is appropriate for their developmental level. The teacher informally observes\nthat one of the boys is having trouble keeping his legs still so she quietly asks the aid for a weighted\npad that she places on the boy\u2019s legs to help him keep them still. The activity continues and the aide\ncarefully observes students behaviors and records on IEP progress cards whether a child meets\nspecific objectives such as: \u201cWhen given two picture or object choices, Mark will point to the\nappropriate object in 80 per cent of the opportunities.\u201d The teacher and aides keep records of the\nrelevant behavior of the special needs students during the half day they are in preschool. The daily\nrecords are summarized weekly. If there are not enough observations that have been recorded for a\nspecific objective, the teacher and aide focus their observations more on that child, and if necessary,\ntry to create specific situations that relate to that objective. At end of each month the teacher\ncalculates whether the special needs children are meeting their IEP objectives.\nSelected response items\nCommon formal assessment formats used by teachers are multiple choice, matching, and true/false items. In\nselected response items students have to select a response provided by the teacher or test developer rather than\nconstructing a response in their own words or actions. Selected response items do not require that students recall\nthe information but rather recognize the correct answer. Tests with these items are called objective because the\nresults are not influenced by scorers\u2019 judgments or interpretations and so are often machine scored. Eliminating\npotential errors in scoring increases the reliability of tests but teachers who only use objective tests are liable to\nreduce the validity of their assessment because objective tests are not appropriate for all learning goals (Linn &\nMiller, 2005). Effective assessment for learning as well as assessment of learning must be based on aligning the\nassessment technique to the learning goals and outcomes.\nFor example, if the goal is for students to conduct an experiment then they should be asked to do that rather that\nthan being asked about conducting an experiment.\nCommon problems\nSelected response items are easy to score but are hard to devise. Teachers often do not spend enough time\nconstructing items and common problems include:\n1. Unclear wording in the items\n\u2022 True or False: Although George Washington was born into a wealthy family, his father died when he\nwas only 11, he worked as a youth as a surveyor of rural lands, and later stood on the balcony of Federal\nHall in New York when he took his oath of office in 1789.\n249 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n2. Cues that are not related the content being examined.\n\u2022 A common clue is that all the true statements on a true/false test or the corrective alternatives on a\nmultiple choice test are longer than the untrue statements or the incorrect alternatives.\n3. Using negatives (or double negatives) the items.\n\u2022 A poor item. \u201cTrue or False: None of the steps made by the student was unnecessary.\u201d\n\u2022 A better item. True or False: \u201cAll of the steps were necessary.\u201d\nStudents often do not notice the negative terms or find them confusing so avoiding them is generally\nrecommended (Linn & Miller 2005). However, since standardized tests often use negative items, teachers\nsometimes deliberately include some negative items to give students practice in responding to that format.\n4. Taking sentences directly from textbook or lecture notes.\nRemoving the words from their context often makes them ambiguous or can change the meaning. For\nexample, a statement from Chapter 3 taken out of context suggests all children are clumsy. \u201cSimilarly with\njumping, throwing and catching: the large majority of children can do these things, though often a bit\nclumsily.\u201d A fuller quotation makes it clearer that this sentence refers to 5-year-olds: For some fives, running\nstill looks a bit like a hurried walk, but usually it becomes more coordinated within a year or two. Similarly\nwith jumping, throwing and catching: the large majority of children can do these things, though often a bit\nclumsily, by the time they start school, and most improve their skills noticeably during the early elementary\nyears.\u201d If the abbreviated form was used as the stem in a true/false item it would obviously be misleading.\n5. Avoid trivial questions\ne.g. Jean Piaget was born in what year?\na) 1896\nb) 1900\nc) 1880\nd) 1903\nWhile it important to know approximately when Piaget made his seminal contributions to the understanding of\nchild development, the exact year of his birth (1880) is not important.\nStrengths and weaknesses\nAll types of selected response items have a number of strengths and weaknesses. True/False items are\nappropriate for measuring factual knowledge such as vocabulary, formulae, dates, proper names, and technical\nterms. They are very efficient as they use a simple structure that students can easily understand, and take little time\nto complete. They are also easier to construct than multiple choice and matching items. However, students have a\n50 per cent probability of getting the answer correct through guessing so it can be difficult to interpret how much\nstudents know from their test scores. Examples of common problems that arise when devising true/false items are\nin Table 37.\nEducational Psychology 250 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nTable 37: Common errors in selected response items\nType of item Common errors Example\nTrue False The statement is not T F The President of the United States is elected to that\nabsolutely true\u2014typically office.\nbecause it contains a\nThis is usually true but the US Vice President can succeed the\nbroad generalization.\nPresident.\nThe item is opinion T F Education for K-12 students is improved though policies\nnot fact . that support charter schools.\nSome people believe this, some do not.\nTwo ideas are T F George H Bush the 40th president of the US was defeated\nincluded in item by William Jefferson Clinton in 1992.\nThe 1st idea is false; the 2nd is true making it difficult for\nstudents to decide whether to circle T or F.\nIrrelevant cues T F The President of the United States is usually elected to\nthat office.\nTrue items contain the words such as usually generally;\nwhereas false items contain the terms such as always, all, never.\nMatching Columns do not Directions: On the line to the US Civil War Battle write the\ncontain homogeneous year or confederate general in Column B.\ninformation\nColumn A Column B\nFt Sumter General Stonewall Jackson\n2nd Battle of Bull Run General Johnson\nFt Henry 1861\n1862\nColumn B is a mixture of generals and dates.\nToo many items in Lists should be relatively short (4 \u2013 7) in each column. More\neach list than 10 are too confusing.\nResponses are not in In the example with Spanish and English words should be in\nlogical order a logical order (they are alphabetical). If the order is not logical,\nstudent spend too much time searching for the correct answer.\n251 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nMultiple Choice Problem (i.e. the New Zealand\nstem) is not clearly stated\na) Is the worlds\u2019 smallest continent\nproblem\nb) Is home to the kangaroo\nc) Was settled mainly by colonists from Great Britain\nd) Is a dictatorship\nThis is really a series of true-false items.

All the options\n(e.g. a, b, c, d) should be used in approximately equal\nfrequently (not exact as that also provides clues).\nEducational Psychology 252 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nUse of \u201cAll of above\u201d 1. If all of the \u201cabove is used\u201d then the other items must\nbe correct. This means that a student may read the 1st\nresponse, mark it correct and move on. Alternatively, a\nstudent may read the 1st two items and seeing they are\ntrue does nor need to read the other alternatives to know\nto circle \u201call of the above\u201d. The teacher probably does\nnot want either of these options.\nIn matching items, two parallel columns containing terms, phrases, symbols, or numbers are presented and the\nstudent is asked to match the items in the first column with those in the second column. Typically there are more\nitems in the second column to make the task more difficult and to ensure that if a student makes one error they do\nnot have to make another. Matching items most often are used to measure lower level knowledge such as persons\nand their achievements, dates and historical events, terms and definitions, symbols and concepts, plants or animals\nand classifications (Linn & Miller, 2005). An example with Spanish language words and their English equivalents is\nbelow:\nDirections: On the line to the left of the Spanish word in Column A, write the letter of the English word in\nColumn B that has the same meaning.\nColumn A Column B\n___ 1. Casa A. Aunt\n___ 2. Beb\u00e9 B. Baby\n___ 3. Gata C. Brother\n___ 4. Perro D. Cat\n___ 5. Hermano E. Dog\nF. Father\nG. House\nWhile matching items may seem easy to devise it is hard to create homogenous lists. Other problems with\nmatching items and suggested remedies are in Table 37.\nMultiple Choice items are the most commonly used type of objective test items because they have a number of\nadvantages over other objective test items. Most importantly they can be adapted to assess higher levels thinking\nsuch as application as well as lower level factual knowledge. The first example below assesses knowledge of a\nspecific fact whereas the second example assesses application of knowledge.\nWho is best known for their work on the development of the morality of justice?\na) Erikson\nb) Vygotsky\n253 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nc) Maslow\nd) Kohlberg\nWhich one of the following best illustrates the law of diminishing returns\na) A factory doubled its labor force and increased production by 50 per cent\nb) The demand for an electronic product increased faster than the supply of the product\nc) The population of a country increased faster than agricultural self sufficiency\nd) A machine decreased in efficacy as its parts became worn out\n(Adapted from Linn and Miller 2005, p, 193).\nThere are several other advantages of multiple choice items. Students have to recognize the correct answer not\njust know the incorrect answer as they do in true/false items. Also, the opportunity for guessing is reduced because\nfour or five alternatives are usually provided whereas in true/false items students only have to choose between two\nchoices. Also, multiple choice items do not need homogeneous material as matching items do.\nHowever, creating good multiple choice test items is difficult and students (maybe including you) often become\nfrustrated when taking a test with poor multiple choice items. Three steps have to be considered when constructing\na multiple choice item: formulating a clearly stated problem, identifying plausible alternatives, and removing\nirrelevant clues to the answer. Common problems in each of these steps are summarized in Table 38\nConstructed response items\nFormal assessment also includes constructed response items in which students are asked to recall information\nand create an answer\u2014not just recognize if the answer is correct\u2014so guessing is reduced. Constructed response\nitems can be used to assess a wide variety of kinds of knowledge and two major kinds are discussed: completion or\nshort answer (also called short response) and extended response.\nCompletion and short answer\nCompletion and short answer items can be answered in a word, phrase, number, or symbol. These types of items\nare essentially the same only varying in whether the problem is presented as a statement or a question (Linn &\nMiller 2005). For example:\nCompletion: The first traffic light in the US was invented by\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nShort Answer: Who invented the first traffic light in the US?\nThese items are often used in mathematics tests, e.g.\n3 + 10 = \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..?\nIf x = 6, what does x(x-1) =\u2026\u2026\u2026.\nDraw the line of symmetry on the following shape\nA major advantage of these items is they that they are easy to construct. However, apart from their use in\nmathematics they are unsuitable for measuring complex learning outcomes and are often difficult to score.\nCompletion and short answer tests are sometimes called objective tests as the intent is that there is only one correct\nEducational Psychology 254 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nanswer and so there is no variability in scoring but unless the question is phrased very carefully, there are\nfrequently a variety of correct answers. For example, consider the item\nWhere was President Lincoln born?....................\nThe teacher may expect the answer \u201cin a log cabin\u201d but other correct answers are also \u201con Sinking Spring Farm\u201d,\n\u201cin Hardin County\u201d or \u201cin Kentucky\u201d. Common errors in these items are summarized in Table 38.\nTable 38: Common errors in constructed response items\nType of item Common errors Example\nCompletion There is more than one e.g. Where was US President Lincoln born? The answer could\nand short answer possible answer. be in a log cabin, in Kentucky etc.\nToo many blanks are in e.g. In \u2026.. theory, the first stage, \u2026.. . is when infants process\nthe completion item so it is through their \u2026\u2026. and \u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026\ntoo difficult or doesn\u2019t\nmake sense.\nClues are given by e.g. Three states are contiguous to New Hampshire: . \u2026.is to\nlength of blanks in the West, \u2026\u2026is to the East and \u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026. is to the South.\ncompletion items.\nExtended Ambiguous questions e.g. Was the US Civil War avoidable?\nResponse\nStudents could interpret this question in a wide variety of\nways, perhaps even stating \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. One student may\ndiscuss only political causes another moral, political and\neconomic causes. There is no guidance in the question for\nstudents.\nPoor reliability in The teacher does not use a scoring rubric and so is\ngrading inconsistent in how he scores answers especially unexpected\nresponses, irrelevant information, and grammatical errors.\nPerception of student By spring semester the teacher has developed expectations of\ninfluences grading each student\u2019s performance and this influences the grading\n(numbers can be used instead of names).\nThe test consists of three constructed responses and the\nteacher grades the three answers on each students\u2019 paper before\nmoving to the next paper. This means that the grading of\nquestions 2 and 3 are influenced by the answers to question 1\n(teachers should grade all the 1st question then the 2nd etc).\nChoices are given on Testing experts recommend not giving choices in tests\n255 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthe test and some answers because then students are not really taking the same test creating\nare easier than others. equity problems.\nExtended response\nExtended response items are used in many content areas and answers may vary in length from a paragraph to\nseveral pages. Questions that require longer responses are often called essay questions. Extended response items\nhave several advantages and the most important is their adaptability for measuring complex learning outcomes\u2014\nparticularly integration and application. These items also require that students write and therefore provide teachers\na way to assess writing skills. A commonly cited advantage to these items is their ease in construction; however,\ncarefully worded items that are related to learning outcomes and assess complex learning are hard to devise (Linn &\nMiller, 2005). Well-constructed items phrase the question so the task of the student is clear. Often this involves\nproviding hints or planning notes. In the first example below the actual question is clear not only because of the\nwording but because of the format (i.e. it is placed in a box). In the second and third examples planning notes are\nprovided:\nExample 1: Third grade mathematics:\nThe owner of a bookstore gave 14 books to the school. The principal will give an equal number of books to each\nof three classrooms and the remaining books to the school library.

Not only do various\nteachers score the same response differently but also the same teacher may score the identical response differently\non various occasions (Linn & Miller 2005). A variety of steps can be taken to improve the reliability and validity of\nscoring. First, teachers should begin by writing an outline of a model answer. This helps make it clear what students\nare expected to include. Second, a sample of the answers should be read. This assists in determining what the\nstudents can do and if there are any common misconceptions arising from the question. Third, teachers have to\ndecide what to do about irrelevant information that is included (e.g. is it ignored or are students penalized) and how\nto evaluate mechanical errors such as grammar and spelling. Then, a point scoring or a scoring rubric should be\nused.\nIn point scoring components of the answer are assigned points. For example, if students were asked:\nWhat are the nature, symptoms, and risk factors of hyperthermia?\nPoint Scoring Guide:\nDefinition (natures) 2 pts\nSymptoms (1 pt for each) 5 pts\nRisk Factors (1 point for each) 5 pts\nWriting 3 pts\nThis provides some guidance for evaluation and helps consistency but point scoring systems often lead the\nteacher to focus on facts (e.g. naming risk factors) rather than higher level thinking that may undermine the validity\n257 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nof the assessment if the teachers\u2019 purposes include higher level thinking. A better approach is to use a scoring rubric\nthat describes the quality of the answer or performance at each level.\nScoring rubrics\nScoring rubrics can be holistic or analytical. In holistic scoring rubrics, general descriptions of performance are\nmade and a single overall score is obtained. An example from grade 2 language arts in Los Angeles Unified School\nDistrict classifies responses into four levels: not proficient, partially proficient, proficient and advanced is on Table\n39.\nTable 39: Example of holistic scoring rubric: English language arts grade 2\nAssignment. Write about an interesting, fun, or exciting story you have read in class this year. Some of the\nthings you could write about are:\n\uf0a7 What happened in the story (the plot or events)\n\uf0a7 Where the events took place (the setting)\n\uf0a7 People, animals, or things in the story ( the characters)\nIn your writing make sure you use facts and details from the story to describe everything clearly.\nAfter you write about the story, explain what makes the story interesting, fun or exciting.\nScoring rubric\nAdvanced The response demonstrates well-developed reading comprehension skills.\nMajor story elements (plot, setting, or characters) are clearly and accurately described.\nScore 4 Statements about the plot, setting, or characters are arranged in a manner that makes\nsense.\nIdeas or judgments (why the story is interesting, fun, or exciting) are clearly supported\nor explained with facts and details from the story.\nProficient The response demonstrates solid reading comprehension skills.\nMost statements about the plot, setting, or characters are clearly described.\nScore 3 Most statements about the plot, setting, or characters are arranged in a manner that\nmakes sense.\nIdeas or judgments are supported with facts and details from the story.\nPartially The response demonstrates some reading comprehension skills\nProficient\nEducational Psychology 258 A Global Text 11.

For\nexample, six characteristics used for assessing writing developed by the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory\n(NWREL) are:\n\u2022 ideas and content\n\u2022 organization\n\u2022 voice\n\u2022 word choice\n\u2022 sentence fluency\n\u2022 conventions\nDescriptions of high, medium, and low responses for each characteristic are available from:\nhttp://www.nwrel.org/assessment/toolkit98/traits/index.html).\nHolistic rubrics have the advantages that they can be developed more quickly than analytical rubrics. They are\nalso faster to use as there is only one dimension to examine. However, they do not provide students feedback about\nwhich aspects of the response are strong and which aspects need improvement (Linn & Miller, 2005). This means\nthey are less useful for assessment for learning. An important use of rubrics is to use them as teaching tools and\nprovide them to students before the assessment so they know what knowledge and skills are expected.\nTeachers can use scoring rubrics as part of instruction by giving students the rubric during instruction,\nproviding several responses, and analyzing these responses in terms of the rubric. For example, use of accurate\nterminology is one dimension of the science rubric in Table 40. An elementary science teacher could discuss why it\n259 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nis important for scientists to use accurate terminology, give examples of inaccurate and accurate terminology,\nprovide that component of the scoring rubric to students, distribute some examples of student responses (maybe\nfrom former students), and then discuss how these responses would be classified according to the rubric. This\nstrategy of assessment for learning should be more effective if the teacher (a) emphasizes to students why using\naccurate terminology is important when learning science rather than how to get a good grade on the test (we\nprovide more details about this in the section on motivation later in this chapter); (b) provides an exemplary\nresponse so students can see a model; and (c) emphasizes that the goal is student improvement on this skill not\nranking students.\nTable 40: Example of a scoring rubric, Science\n*On the High School Assessment, the application of a concept to a practical problem or real-world situation\nwill be scored when it is required in the response and requested in the item stem.\nLevel of Use of accurate Use of Synthesis of Application\nunderstanding scientific supporting information of information*\nterminology details\n4 There is evidence in The use of accurate Pertinent The response An effective\nthe response that the scientific terminology and complete reflects a application of the\nstudent has a full and enhances the response. supporting complete concept to a\ncomplete details synthesis of practical problem\nunderstanding. demonstrate information. or real-world\nan integration situation reveals\nof ideas. an insight into\nscientific\nprinciples.\n3 There is evidence in The use of accurate The The response The concept\nthe response that the scientific terminology supporting reflects some has been applied\nstudent has a good strengthens the details are synthesis of to a practical\nunderstanding. response. generally information. problem or real-\ncomplete. world situation.\n2 There is evidence in The use of accurate The The response The application\nthe response that the scientific terminology supporting provides little or of the concept to a\nstudent has a basic may be present in the details are no synthesis of practical problem\nunderstanding. response. adequate. information. or real-world\nsituation is\ninadequate.\n1 There is evidence in The use of accurate The The response The\nthe response that the scientific terminology is supporting addresses the application, if\nstudent has some not present in the details are only question. attempted, is\nEducational Psychology 260 A Global Text 11.

The response is completely\nincorrect or irrelevant.\nPerformance assessments\nTypically in performance assessments students complete a specific task while teachers observe the process or\nprocedure (e.g. data collection in an experiment) as well as the product (e.g. completed report) (Popham, 2005;\nStiggens, 2005). The tasks that students complete in performance assessments are not simple\u2014in contrast to\nselected response items\u2014and include the following:\n\u2022 playing a musical instrument\n\u2022 athletic skills\n\u2022 artistic creation\n\u2022 conversing in a foreign language\n\u2022 engaging in a debate about political issues\n\u2022 conducting an experiment in science\n\u2022 repairing a machine\n\u2022 writing a term paper\n\u2022 using interaction skills to play together\nThese examples all involve complex skills but illustrate that the term performance assessment is used in a\nvariety of ways. For example, the teacher may not observe all of the process (e.g. she sees a draft paper but the final\nproduct is written during out-of-school hours) and essay tests are typically classified as performance assessments\n(Airasian, 2000). In addition, in some performance assessments there may be no clear product (e.g. the\nperformance may be group interaction skills).\nTwo related terms, alternative assessment and authentic assessment are sometimes used instead of\nperformance assessment but they have different meanings (Linn & Miller, 2005). Alternative assessment refers to\ntasks that are not pencil-and-paper and while many performance assessments are not pencil-and paper tasks some\nare (e.g. writing a term paper, essay tests). Authentic assessment is used to describe tasks that students do that are\nsimilar to those in the \u201creal world\u201d. Classroom tasks vary in level of authenticity (Popham, 2005). For example, a\nJapanese language class taught in a high school in Chicago conversing in Japanese in Tokyo is highly authentic\u2014\nbut only possible in a study abroad program or trip to Japan. Conversing in Japanese with native Japanese speakers\nin Chicago is also highly authentic, and conversing with the teacher in Japanese during class is moderately\nauthentic. Much less authentic is a matching test on English and Japanese words. In a language arts class, writing a\nletter (to an editor) or a memo to the principal is highly authentic as letters and memos are common work products.\n261 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nHowever, writing a five-paragraph paper is not as authentic as such papers are not used in the world of work.\nHowever, a five paragraph paper is a complex task and would typically be classified as a performance assessment.\nAdvantages and disadvantages\nThere are several advantages of performance assessments (Linn & Miller 2005). First, the focus is on complex\nlearning outcomes that often cannot be measured by other methods. Second, performance assessments typically\nassess process or procedure as well as the product. For example, the teacher can observe if the students are\nrepairing the machine using the appropriate tools and procedures as well as whether the machine functions\nproperly after the repairs. Third, well designed performance assessments communicate the instructional goals and\nmeaningful learning clearly to students. For example, if the topic in a fifth grade art class is one-point perspective\nthe performance assessment could be drawing a city scene that illustrates one point perspective.\n(http://www.sanford-artedventures.com). This assessment is meaningful and clearly communicates the learning\ngoal. This performance assessment is a good instructional activity and has good content validity\u2014common with\nwell designed performance assessments (Linn & Miller 2005).\nOne major disadvantage with performance assessments is that they are typically very time consuming for\nstudents and teachers. This means that fewer assessments can be gathered so if they are not carefully devised fewer\nlearning goals will be assessed\u2014which can reduce content validity. State curriculum guidelines can be helpful in\ndetermining what should be included in a performance assessment. For example, Eric, a dance teacher in a high\nschool in Tennessee learns that the state standards indicate that dance students at the highest level should be able\nto do demonstrate consistency and clarity in performing technical skills by:\n\u2022 performing complex movement combinations to music in a variety of meters and styles\n\u2022 performing combinations and variations in a broad dynamic range\n\u2022 demonstrating improvement in performing movement combinations through self-evaluation\n\u2022 critiquing a live or taped dance production based on given criteria\n(http://www.tennessee.gov/education/ci/standards/music/dance912.shtml)\nEric devises the following performance task for his eleventh grade modern dance class.\nIn groups of 4-6 students will perform a dance at least 5 minutes in length. The dance selected should\nbe multifaceted so that all the dancers can demonstrate technical skills, complex movements, and a\ndynamic range (Items 1-2). Students will videotape their rehearsals and document how they\nimproved through self evaluation (Item 3). Each group will view and critique the final performance\nof one other group in class (Item 4). Eric would need to scaffold most steps in this performance\nassessment. The groups probably would need guidance in selecting a dance that allowed all the\ndancers to demonstrate the appropriate skills; critiquing their own performances constructively;\nworking effectively as a team, and applying criteria to evaluate a dance.\nAnother disadvantage of performance assessments is they are hard to assess reliably which can lead to\ninaccuracy and unfair evaluation. As with any constructed response assessment, scoring rubrics are very important.\nEducational Psychology 262 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nAn example of holistic and analytic scoring rubrics designed to assess a completed product are in Table 39 and\nTable 40. A rubric designed to assess the process of group interactions is in Table 41.\nTable 41: Example of group interaction rubric\nScore Time Participation and Shared involvement\nmanagement performance in roles\n0 Group did not stay Group did not assign or Single individual did the task.\non task and so task was share roles.\nnot completed.\n1 Group was off-task Groups assigned roles Group totally disregarded comments and\nthe majority of the time but members did not use ideas from some members.\nbut task was completed. these roles.\n2 Group stayed on task Groups accepted and Group accepted some ideas but did not\nmost of the time. used some but not all roles. give others adequate consideration.\n3 Group stayed on task Group accepted and used Groups gave equal consideration to all\nthroughout the activity roles and actively ideas.\nand managed time well. participated.\n4 Group defined their Group defined and used Groups made specific efforts to involve\nown approach in a way roles not mentioned to all group members including the reticent\nthat more effectively them.

Ronkonkomo, NY\nLab-Aids. (http://cse.edc.org/products/assessment/middleschool/scorerub.asp))\nThis rubric was devised for middle grade science but could be used in other subject areas when assessing group\nprocess. In some performance assessments several scoring rubrics should be used. In the dance performance\nexample above Eric should have scoring rubrics for the performance skills, the improvement based on self\nevaluation, the team work, and the critique of the other group. Obviously, devising a good performance assessment\nis complex and Linn and Miller (2005) recommend that teachers should:\n\u2022 Create performance assessments that require students to use complex cognitive skills. Sometimes teachers\ndevise assessments that are interesting and that the students enjoy but do not require students to use\nhigher level cognitive skills that lead to significant learning. Focusing on high level skills and learning\noutcomes is particularly important because performance assessments are typically so time consuming.\n263 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u2022 Ensure that the task is clear to the students. Performance assessments typically require multiple steps so\nstudents need to have the necessary prerequisite skills and knowledge as well as clear directions. Careful\nscaffolding is important for successful performance assessments.\n\u2022 Specify expectations of the performance clearly by providing students scoring rubrics during the\ninstruction. This not only helps students understand what it expected but it also guarantees that teachers\nare clear about what they expect. Thinking this through while planning the performance assessment can be\ndifficult for teachers but is crucial as it typically leads to revisions of the actual assessment and directions\nprovided to students.\n\u2022 Reduce the importance of unessential skills in completing the task. What skills are essential depends on the\npurpose of the task. For example, for a science report, is the use of publishing software essential? If the\npurpose of the assessment is for students to demonstrate the process of the scientific method including\nwriting a report, then the format of the report may not be significant. However, if the purpose includes\nintegrating two subject areas, science and technology, then the use of publishing software is important.\nBecause performance assessments take time it is tempting to include multiple skills without carefully\nconsidering if all the skills are essential to the learning goals.\nPortfolios\n\u201cA portfolio is a meaningful collection of student work that tells the story of student achievement or growth\u201d\n(Arter, Spandel, & Culham, 1995, p. 2). Portfolios are a purposeful collection of student work not just folders of all\nthe work a student does. Portfolios are used for a variety of purposes and developing a portfolio system can be\nconfusing and stressful unless the teachers are clear on their purpose. The varied purposes can be illustrated as four\ndimensions (Linn & Miller 2005):\nAssessment for Learning Assessment of learning\nCurrent Accomplishments Progress\nBest Work Showcase Documentation\nFinished Working\nWhen the primary purpose is assessment for learning, the emphasis is on student self-reflection and\nresponsibility for learning. Students not only select samples of their work they wish to include, but also reflect and\ninterpret their own work. Portfolios containing this information can be used to aid communication as students can\npresent and explain their work to their teachers and parents (Stiggins, 2005). Portfolios focusing on assessment of\nlearning contain students\u2019 work samples that certify accomplishments for a classroom grade, graduation, state\nrequirements etc. Typically, students have less choice in the work contained in such portfolios as some consistency\nEducational Psychology 264 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nis needed for this type of assessment. For example, the writing portfolios that fourth and seventh graders are\nrequired to submit in Kentucky must contain a self-reflective statement and an example of three pieces of writing\n(reflective, personal experience or literary, and transactive). Students do choose which of their pieces of writing in\neach type to include in the portfolio.\n(http://www.kde.state.ky.us/KDE/Instructional+Resources/Curriculum+Documents+and+Resources/Student\n+Performance+Standards/).\nPortfolios can be designed to focus on student progress or current accomplishments. For example, audio tapes\nof English language learners speaking could be collected over one year to demonstrate growth in learning. Student\nprogress portfolios may also contain multiple versions of a single piece of work. For example, a writing project may\ncontain notes on the original idea, outline, first draft, comments on the first draft by peers or teacher, second draft,\nand the final finished product (Linn & Miller 2005). If the focus is on current accomplishments, only recent\ncompleted work samples are included.\nPortfolios can focus on documenting student activities or highlighting important accomplishments.\nDocumentation portfolios are inclusive containing all the work samples rather than focusing on one special\nstrength, best work, or progress. In contrast, showcase portfolios focus on best work. The best work is typically\nidentified by students. One aim of such portfolios is that students learn how to identify products that demonstrate\nwhat they know and can do. Students are not expected to identify their best work in isolation but also use the\nfeedback from their teachers and peers.\nA final distinction can be made between a finished portfolio\u2014maybe used to for a job application\u2014versus a\nworking portfolio that typically includes day-to-day work samples. Working portfolios evolve over time and are not\nintended to be used for assessment of learning. The focus in a working portfolio is on developing ideas and skills so\nstudents should be allowed to make mistakes, freely comment on their own work, and respond to teacher feedback\n(Linn & Miller, 2005). Finished portfolios are designed for use with a particular audience and the products selected\nmay be drawn from a working portfolio. For example, in a teacher education program, the working portfolio may\ncontain work samples from all the courses taken. A student may develop one finished portfolio to demonstrate she\nhas mastered the required competencies in the teacher education program and a second finished portfolio for her\njob application.\nAdvantages and disadvantages\nPortfolios used well in classrooms have several advantages. They provide a way of documenting and evaluating\ngrowth in a much more nuanced way than selected response tests can. Also, portfolios can be integrated easily into\ninstruction, i.e. used for assessment for learning. Portfolios also encourage student self-evaluation and reflection, as\nwell as ownership for learning (Popham, 2005). Using classroom assessment to promote student motivation is an\nimportant component of assessment for learning which is considered in the next section.\nHowever, there are some major disadvantages of portfolio use. First, good portfolio assessment takes an\nenormous amount of teacher time and organization. The time is needed to help students understand the purpose\nand structure of the portfolio, decide which work samples to collect, and to self reflect. Some of this time needs to\nbe conducted in one-to-one conferences. Reviewing and evaluating the portfolios out of class time is also\nenormously time consuming. Teachers have to weigh if the time spent is worth the benefits of the portfolio use.\n265 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nSecond, evaluating portfolios reliability and eliminating bias can be even more difficult than in a constructed\nresponse assessment because the products are more varied. The experience of the state-wide use of portfolios for\nassessment in writing and mathematics for fourth and eighth graders in Vermont is sobering. Teachers used the\nsame analytic scoring rubric when evaluating the portfolio. In the first two years of implementation samples from\nschools were collected and scored by an external panel of teachers. In the first year the agreement among raters (i.e.\ninter-rater reliability) was poor for mathematics and reading; in the second year the agreement among raters\nimproved for mathematics but not for reading. However, even with the improvement in mathematics the reliability\nwas too low to use the portfolios for individual student accountability (Koretz, Stecher, Klein & McCaffrey, 1994).\nWhen reliability is low, validity is also compromised because unstable results cannot be interpreted meaningfully.\nIf teachers do use portfolios in their classroom, the series of steps needed for implementation are outlined in\nTable 36. If the school or district has an existing portfolio system these steps may have to be modified.\nTable 42: Steps in implementing a classroom portfolio program\n1. Make sure students own their Talk to your students about your ideas of the portfolio, the different\nportfolios. purposes, and the variety of work samples. If possible, have them help make\ndecisions about the kind of portfolio you implement.\n2. Decide on the purpose. Will the focus be on growth or current accomplishments? Best work\nshowcase or documentation? Good portfolios can have multiple purposes but\nthe teacher and students need to be clear about the purpose.\n3. Decide what work samples to For example, in writing, is every writing assignment included? Are early\ncollect, drafts as well as final products included?\n4. Collect and store work Decide where the work sample will be stored. For example, will each\nsamples, student have a file folder in a file cabinet, or a small plastic tub on a shelf in\nthe classroom?\n5. Select criteria to evaluate If possible, work with students to develop scoring rubrics. This may take\nsamples, considerable time as different rubrics may be needed for the variety of work\nsamples. If you are using existing scoring rubrics, discuss with students\npossible modifications after the rubrics have been used at least once.\n6. Teach and require students Help students learn to evaluate their own work using agreed upon\nconduct self evaluations of their criteria. For younger students, the self evaluations may be simple (strengths,\nown work, weaknesses, and ways to improve); for older students a more analytic\napproach is desirable including using the same scoring rubrics that the\nteachers will use.\n7. Schedule and conduct Teacher-student conferences are time consuming but conferences are\nportfolio conferences , essential for the portfolio process to significantly enhance learning. These\nconferences should aid students\u2019 self evaluation and should take place\nfrequently.\nEducational Psychology 266 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\n8. Involve parents. Parents need to understand the portfolio process. Encourage parents to\nreview the work samples. You may wish to schedule parent, teacher-students\nconferences in which students talk about their work samples.\nSource: Adapted from Popham (2005)\nAssessment that enhances motivation and student confidence\nStudies on testing and learning conducted more than 20 years ago demonstrated that tests promote learning\nand that more frequent tests are more effective than less frequent tests (Dempster & Perkins, 1993). Frequent\nsmaller tests encourage continuous effort rather than last minute cramming and may also reduce test anxiety\nbecause the consequences of errors are reduced. College students report preferring more frequent testing than\ninfrequent testing (Bangert-Downs, Kulik, Kulik, 1991). More recent research indicates that teachers\u2019 assessment\npurpose and beliefs, the type of assessment selected, and the feedback given contributes to the assessment climate\nin the classroom which influences students\u2019 confidence and motivation. The use of self-assessment is also\nimportant in establishing a positive assessment climate.\nTeachers\u2019 purposes and beliefs\nStudent motivation can be enhanced when the purpose of assessment is promoting student learning and this is\nclearly communicated to students by what teachers say and do (Harlen, 2006). This approach to assessment is\nassociated with what the psychologist, Carol Dweck, (2000) calls an incremental view of ability or intelligence. An\nincremental view assumes that ability increases whenever an individual learns more. This means that effort is\nvalued because effort leads to knowing more and therefore having more ability. Individuals with an incremental\nview also ask for help when needed and respond well to constructive feedback as the primary goal is increased\nlearning and mastery. In contrast, a fixed view of ability assumes that some people have more ability than others\nand nothing much can be done to change that. Individuals with a fixed view of ability often view effort in opposition\nto ability (\u201cSmart people don\u2019t have to study\u201d) and so do not try as hard, and are less likely to ask for help as that\nindicates that they are not smart. While there are individual differences in students\u2019 beliefs about their views of\nintelligence, teachers\u2019 beliefs and classroom practices influence students\u2019 perceptions and behaviors.\nTeachers with an incremental view of intelligence communicate to students that the goal of learning is mastering\nthe material and figuring things out. Assessment is used by these teachers to understand what students know so\nthey can decide whether to move to the next topic, re-teach the entire class, or provide remediation for a few\nstudents. Assessment also helps students\u2019 understand their own learning and demonstrate their competence.\nTeachers with these views say things like, \u201cWe are going to practice over and over again. That\u2019s how you get good.\nAnd you\u2019re going to make mistakes. That\u2019s how you learn.\u201d (Patrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, Midgley, 2001, p.\n45).\nIn contrast, teachers with a fixed view of ability are more likely to believe that the goal of learning is doing well\non tests especially outperforming others. These teachers are more likely to say things that imply fixed abilities e.g.\n\u201cThis test will determine what your math abilities are\u201d, or stress the importance of interpersonal competition, \u201cWe\nwill have speech competition and the top person will compete against all the other district schools and last year the\nwinner got a big award and their photo in the paper.\u201d When teachers stress interpersonal competition some\n267 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nstudents may be motivated but there can only a few winners so there are many more students who know they have\nno chance of winning. Another problem with interpersonal competition in assessment is that the focus can become\nwinning rather than understanding the material.\nTeachers who communicate to their students that ability is incremental and that the goal of assessment is\npromoting learning rather that ranking students, or awarding prizes to those who did very well, or catching those\nwho did not pay attention, are likely to enhance students\u2019 motivation.\nChoosing assessments\nThe choice of assessment task also influences students\u2019 motivation and confidence. First, assessments that have\nclear criteria that students understand and can meet rather than assessments that pit students against each other in\ninterpersonal competition enhances motivation (Black, Harrison, Lee, Marshall, Wiliam, 2004). This is consistent\nwith the point we made in the previous section about the importance of focusing on enhancing learning for all\nstudents rather than ranking students. Second, meaningful assessment tasks enhance student motivation. Students\noften want to know why they have to do something and teachers need to provide meaningful answers. For example,\na teacher might say, \u201cYou need to be able to calculate the area of a rectangle because if you want new carpet you\nneed to know how much carpet is needed and how much it would cost.\u201d Well designed performance tasks are often\nmore meaningful to students than selected response tests so students will work harder to prepare for them.\nThird, providing choices of assessment tasks can enhance student sense of autonomy and motivation according\nto self determination theory (see Chapter 6). Kym, the sixth grade teacher whose story began this chapter, reports\nthat giving students choices was very helpful. Another middle school social studies teacher Aaron, gives his students\na choice of performance tasks at the end of the unit on the US Bill of Rights. Students have to demonstrate specified\nkey ideas but can do that by making up a board game, presenting a brief play, composing a rap song etc. Aaron\nreports that students work much harder on this performance assessment which allows them to use their strengths\nthan previously when he did not provide any choices and gave a more traditional assignment. Measurement experts\ncaution that a danger of giving choices is that the assessment tasks are no longer equivalent and so the reliability of\nscoring is reduced so it is particularly important to use well designed scoring rubrics. Fourth, assessment tasks\nshould be challenging but achievable with reasonable effort (Elliott, McGregor & Thrash, 2004). This is often hard\nfor beginning teachers to do, who may give assessment tasks that are too easy or too hard, because they have to\nlearn to match their assessment to the skills of their students.\nProviding feedback\nWhen the goal is assessment for learning, providing constructive feedback that helps students know what they\ndo and do not understand as well as encouraging them to learn from their errors is fundamental. Effective feedback\nshould be given as soon as possible as the longer the delay between students\u2019 work and feedback the longer students\nwill continue to have some misconceptions. Also, delays reduce the relationship between students\u2019 performance and\nthe feedback as students can forget what they were thinking during the assessment. Effective feedback should also\ninform students clearly what they did well and what needs modification. General comments just as \u201cgood work, A\u201d,\nor \u201cneeds improvement\u201d do not help students understand how to improve their learning. Giving feedback to\nstudents using well designed scoring rubrics helps clearly communicate strengths and weaknesses. Obviously\ngrades are often needed but teachers can minimize the focus by placing the grade after the comments or on the last\nEducational Psychology 268 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\npage of a paper. It can also be helpful to allow students to keep their grades private making sure when returning\nassignments that the grade is not prominent (e.g. not using red ink on the top page) and never asking students to\nread their scores aloud in class. Some students choose to share their grades\u2014but that should be their decision not\ntheir teachers.\nWhen grading, teachers often become angry at the mistakes that student make. It is easy for teachers to think\nsomething like: \u201cWith all the effort I put into teaching, this student could not even be bothered to follow the\ndirections or spell check!\u201d Many experienced teachers believe that communicating their anger is not helpful, so\nrather than saying: \u201cHow dare you turn in such shoddy work\u201d, they rephrase it as, \u201cI am disappointed that your\nwork on this assignment does not meet the standards set\u201d (Sutton, 2003). Research evidence also suggests that\ncomments such as \u201cYou are so smart\u201d for a high quality performance can be counterproductive. This is surprising to\nmany teachers but if students are told they are smart when they produce a good product, then if they do poorly on\nthe next assignment the conclusion must be they are \u201cnot smart\u201d (Dweck, 2000). More effective feedback focuses\non positive aspects of the task (not the person), as well as strategies, and effort. The focus of the feedback should\nrelate to the criteria set by the teacher and how improvements can be made.\nWhen the teacher and student are from different racial/ethnic backgrounds providing feedback that enhances\nmotivation and confidence but also includes criticism can be particularly challenging because the students of color\nhave historical reasons to distrust negative comments from a white teacher. Research by Cohen Steele, Ross (1999)\nindicates that \u201cwise\u201d feedback from teachers needs three components: positive comments, criticisms, and an\nassurance that the teacher believes the student can reach higher standards. We describe this research is more detail\nin \u201cDeciding for yourself about the research\u201d found in Appendix #2.\nSelf and peer assessment\nIn order to reach a learning goal, students need to understand the meaning of the goal, the steps necessary to\nachieve a goal, and if they are making satisfactory progress towards that goal (Sadler, 1989). This involves self\nassessment and recent research has demonstrated that well designed self assessment can enhance student learning\nand motivation (Black & Wiliam, 2006). For self assessment to be effective, students need explicit criteria such as\nthose in an analytical scoring rubric. These criteria are either provided by the teacher or developed by the teacher in\ncollaboration with students. Because students seem to find it easier to understand criteria for assessment tasks if\nthey can examine other students\u2019 work along side their own, self assessment often involves peer assessment. An\nexample of a strategy used by teachers involves asking students to use \u201ctraffic lights\u201d to indicate of their confidence\nin their assignment or homework. Red indicates that they were unsure of their success, orange that they were\npartially unsure, and green that they were confident of their success. The students who labeled their own work as\norange and green worked in mixed groups to evaluate their own work while the teacher worked with the students\nwho had chosen red (Black & Wiliam, 2006).\nIf self and peer assessment is used, it is particularly important that the teachers establish a classroom culture for\nassessment that is based on incremental views of ability and learning goals. If the classroom atmosphere focuses on\ninterpersonal competition, students have incentives in self and peer assessment to inflate their own evaluations\n(and perhaps those of their friends) because there are limited rewards for good work.\n269 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAdjusting instruction based on assessment\nUsing assessment information to adjust instruction is fundamental to the concept of assessment for learning.\nTeachers make these adjustments \u201cin the moment\u201d during classroom instruction as well as during reflection and\nplanning periods. Teachers use the information they gain from questioning and observation to adjust their teaching\nduring classroom instruction. If students cannot answer a question, the teacher may need to rephrase the question,\nprobe understanding of prior knowledge, or change the way the current idea is being considered. It is important for\nteachers to learn to identify when only one or two students need individual help because they are struggling with\nthe concept, and when a large proportion of the class is struggling so whole group intervention is needed.\nAfter the class is over, effective teachers spend time analyzing how well the lessons went, what students did and\ndid not seem to understand, and what needs to be done the next day. Evaluation of student work also provides\nimportant information for teachers. If many students are confused about a similar concept the teacher needs to re-\nteach it and consider new ways of helping students understand the topic. If the majority of students complete the\ntasks very quickly and well, the teacher might decide that the assessment was not challenging enough. Sometimes\nteachers become dissatisfied with the kinds of assessments they have assigned when they are grading\u2014perhaps\nbecause they realize there was too much emphasis on lower level learning, that the directions were not clear\nenough, or the scoring rubric needed modification. Teachers who believe that assessment data provides\ninformation about their own teaching and that they can find ways to influence student learning have high teacher\nefficacy or beliefs that they can make a difference in students\u2019 lives. In contrast, teachers who think that student\nperformance is mostly due to fixed student characteristics or the homes they come from (e.g. \u201cno wonder she did so\npoorly considering what her home life is like\u201d) have low teacher efficacy (Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy, & Hoy,\n1998).\nCommunication with parents and guardians\nClear communication with parents about classroom assessment is important\u2014but often difficult for beginning\nteachers. The same skills that are needed to communicate effectively with students are also needed when\ncommunicating with parents and guardians. Teachers need to be able to explain to parents the purpose of the\nassessment, why they selected this assessment technique, and what the criteria for success are. Some teachers send\nhome newsletters monthly or at the beginning of a major assessment task explaining the purpose and nature of the\ntask, any additional support that is needed (e.g. materials, library visits), and due dates. Some parents will not be\nfamiliar with performance assessments or the use of self and peer assessment so teachers need to take time to\nexplain these approaches carefully.\nMany school districts now communicate though websites that have mixtures of public information available to\nall parents in the class (e.g. curriculum and assessment details) as well information restricted to the parents or\nguardians of specific students (e.g. the attendance and grades). Teachers report this is helpful as parents have\naccess to their child\u2019s performance immediately and when necessary, can talk to their child and teacher quickly.\nThe recommendations we provided above on the type of feedback that should be given to students also apply\nwhen talking to parents. That is, the focus should be on students\u2019 performance on the task, what was done well and\nwhat needs work, rather than general comments about how \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d the child is. If possible, comments\nshould focus on strategies that the child uses well or needs to improve (e.g. reading test questions carefully,\nEducational Psychology 270 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\norganization in a large project). When the teacher is white and the student or parents are minority, trust can be an\nissue so using \u201cwise\u201d feedback when talking to parents may help.\nAction research: studying yourself and your students\nAssessment for learning emphasizes devising and conducting assessment data in order to improve teaching and\nlearning and so is related to action research (also called teacher research). In Chapter 1, we described action\nresearch as studies conducted by teachers of their own students or their own work. Action research can lead to\ndecisions that improve a teacher\u2019s own teaching or the teaching of colleagues. Kym, the teacher we described at the\nbeginning of this chapter, conducted action research in her own classroom as she identified a problem of poor\nstudent motivation and achievement, investigated solutions during the course on motivation, tried new approaches,\nand observed the resulting actions.\nCycles of planning, acting and reflecting\nAction research is usually described as a cyclical process with the following stages (Mertler, 2006).\n\u2022 Planning Stage. Planning has three components. First, planning involves identifying and defining a\nproblem. Problems sometimes start with some ill defined unease or feeling that something is wrong and it\ncan take time to identify the problem clearly so that it becomes a researchable question. The next step, is\nreviewing the related literature and this may occur within a class or workshop that the teachers are\nattending. Teachers may also explore the literature on their own or in teacher study groups. The third step\nis developing a research plan. The research plan includes what kind of data will be collected (e.g. student\ntest scores, observation of one or more students, as well as how and when it will be collected (e.g. from files,\nin collaboration with colleagues, in spring or fall semester).\n\u2022 Acting sage. During this stage the teacher is collecting and analyzing data. The data collected and the\nanalyses do not need to be complex because action research, to be effective, has to be manageable.\n\u2022 Developing an action plan. In this stage the teacher develops a plan to make changes and implements these\nchanges. This is the action component of action research and it is important that teachers document their\nactions carefully so that they can communicate them to others.\n\u2022 Communicating and reflection. An important component of all research is communicating information.\nResults can be shared with colleagues in the school or district, in an action research class at the local\ncollege, at conferences, or in journals for teachers. Action research can also involve students as active\nparticipants and if this is the case, communication may include students and parents. Communicating with\nothers helps refine ideas and so typically aids in reflection. During reflection teachers/researchers ask such\nquestions as: \u201cWhat did I learn?\u201d \u201cWhat should I have done differently?\u201d \u201cWhat should I do next?\u201d\nQuestions such as these often lead to a new cycle of action research beginning with planning and then\nmoving to the other steps.\nEthical issues\u2014privacy, voluntary consent\nTeachers are accustomed to collecting students\u2019 test scores, data about performances, and descriptions of\nbehaviors as an essential component of teaching. However, if teachers are conducting action research and they plan\nto collect data that will be shared outside the school community then permission from parents (or guardians) and\n271 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nstudents must be obtained in order to protect the privacy of students and their families. Typically permission is\nobtained by an informed consent form that summarizes the research, describes the data that will be collected,\nindicates that participation is voluntary, and provides a guarantee of confidentiality or anonymity (Hubbard &\nPower, 2005). Many large school districts have procedures for establishing informed consent as well as person in\nthe central office who is responsible for the district guidelines and specific application process. If the action\nresearch is supported in some way by a college of university (e.g. through a class) then informed consent\nprocedures of that institution must be followed.\nOne common area of confusion for teachers is the voluntary nature of student participation in research. If the\ndata being collected are for a research study, students can choose not to participate. This is contrary to much\nregular classroom instruction where teachers tell students they have to do the work or complete the tasks.\nGrading and reporting\nAssigning students grades is an important component of teaching and many school districts issue progress\nreports, interim reports, or mid term grades as well as final semester grades. Traditionally these reports were\nprinted on paper and sent home with students or mailed to students\u2019 homes. Increasingly, school districts are using\nweb-based grade management systems that allow parents to access their child\u2019s grades on each individual\nassessment as well as the progress reports and final grades.\nGrading can be frustrating for teachers as there are many factors to consider. In addition, report cards typically\nsummarize in brief format a variety of assessments and so cannot provide much information about students\u2019\nstrengths and weaknesses. This means that report cards focus more on assessment of learning than assessment for\nlearning. There are a number of decisions that have to be made when assigning students\u2019 grades and schools often\nhave detailed policies that teachers have to follow. In the next section, we consider the major questions associated\nwith grading.\nHow are various assignments and assessments weighted?\nStudents typically complete a variety of assignments during a grading period such as homework, quizzes,\nperformance assessments, etc. Teachers have to decide\u2014preferably before the grading period begins\u2014how each\nassignment will be weighted. For example, a sixth grade math teacher may decide to weight the grades in the\nfollowing manner:\nWeekly quizzes 35 per cent\nHomework 15 per cent\nPerformance Assessment 30 per cent\nClass participation 20 per cent\nDeciding how to weight assignments should be done carefully as it communicates to students and parents what\nteachers believe is important, and also may be used to decide how much effort students will exert (e.g. \u201cIf\nhomework is only worth 5 per cent, it is not worth completing twice a week\u201d).\nShould social skills or effort be included? Elementary school teachers are more likely than middle or high school\nteachers to include some social skills into report cards (Popham, 2005). These may be included as separate criteria\nEducational Psychology 272 A Global Text 11. Teacher-made assessment strategies\nin the report card or weighted into the grade for that subject. For example, the grade for mathematics may include\nan assessment of group cooperation or self regulation during mathematics lessons. Some schools and teachers\nendorse including social skills arguing that developing such skills is important for young students and that students\nneed to learn to work with others and manage their own behaviors in order to be successful. Others believe that\ngrades in subject areas should be based on the cognitive performances\u2014and that if assessments of social skills are\nmade they should be clearly separated from the subject grade on the report card. Obviously, clear criteria such as\nthose contained in analytical scoring rubrics should be used if social skills are graded.\nTeachers often find it difficult to decide whether effort and improvement should be included as a component of\ngrades. One approach is for teachers to ask students to submit drafts of an assignment and make improvements\nbased on the feedback they received. The grade for the assignment may include some combination of the score for\nthe drafts, the final version, and the amount of improvement the students made based on the feedback provided. A\nmore controversial approach is basing grades on effort when students try really hard day after day but still cannot\ncomplete their assignments well. These students could have identified special needs or be recent immigrants that\nhave limited English skills. Some school districts have guidelines for handling such cases. One disadvantage of\nusing improvement as a component of grades is that the most competent students in class may do very well initially\nand have little room for improvement\u2014unless teachers are skilled at providing additional assignments that will\nhelp challenge these students.\nTeachers often use \u201chodgepodge grading\u201d, i.e. a combination of achievement, effort, growth, attitude or class\nconduct, homework, and class participation. A survey of over 8,500 middle and high school students in the US state\nof Virginia supported the hodgepodge practices commonly used by their teachers (Cross & Frary, 1999).\nHow should grades be calculated?\nTwo options are commonly used: absolute grading and relative grading. In absolute grading grades are assigned\nbased on criteria the teacher has devised. If an English teacher has established a level of proficiency needed to\nobtain an A and no student meets that level then no A's will be given. Alternatively if every student meets the\nestablished level then all the students will get A's (Popham, 2005). Absolute grading systems may use letter grades\nor pass/fail.\nIn relative grading the teacher ranks the performances of students from worst to best (or best to worst) and\nthose at the top get high grades, those in the middle moderate grades, and those at the bottom low grades. This is\noften described as \u201cgrading on the curve\u201d and can be useful to compensate for an examination or assignment that\nstudents find much easier or harder than the teacher expected. However, relative grading can be unfair to students\nbecause the comparisons are typically within one class, so an A in one class may not represent the level of\nperformance of an A in another class. Relative grading systems may discourage students from helping each other\nimprove as students are in competition for limited rewards. In fact, Bishop (1999) argues that grading on the curve\ngives students a personal interest in persuading each other not to study as a serious student makes it more difficult\nfor others to get good grades.\nWhat kinds of grade descriptions should be used?\nTraditionally a letter grade system is used (e.g. A, B, C, D, F ) for each subject. The advantages of these grade\ndescriptions are they are convenient, simple, and can be averaged easily. However, they do not indicate what\n273 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nobjectives the student has or has not met nor students\u2019 specific strengths and weaknesses (Linn & Miller 2005).\nElementary schools often use a pass-fail (or satisfactory-unsatisfactory) system and some high schools and colleges\ndo as well. Pass-fail systems in high school and college allow students to explore new areas and take risks on\nsubjects that they may have limited preparation for, or is not part of their major (Linn & Miller 2005). While a pass-\nfail system is easy to use, it offers even less information about students\u2019 level of learning.\nA pass-fail system is also used in classes that are taught under a mastery-learning approach in which students\nare expected to demonstrate mastery on all the objectives in order to receive course credit. Under these conditions,\nit is clear that a pass means that the student has demonstrated mastery of all the objectives.\nSome schools have implemented a checklist of the objectives in subject areas to replace the traditional letter\ngrade system, and students are rated on each objective using descriptors such as Proficient, Partially Proficient, and\nNeeds Improvement. For example, the checklist for students in a fourth grade class in California may include the\nfour types of writing that are required by the English language state content standards\n(http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/enggrade4.asp)\n\u2022 writing narratives\n\u2022 writing responses to literature\n\u2022 writing information reports\n\u2022 writing summaries\nThe advantages of this approach are that it communicates students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses clearly, and it\nreminds the students and parents the objectives of the school. However, if too many objectives are included then\nthe lists can become so long that they are difficult to understand.\nChapter summary\nThe purpose of classroom assessment can be assessment for learning or assessment of learning. Essential steps\nof assessment for learning include communicating instructional goals clearly to students; selecting appropriate high\nquality assessments that match the instructional goals and students\u2019 backgrounds; using assessments that enhance\nstudent motivation and confidence, adjusting instruction based on assessment, and communicating assessment\nresults with parents and guardians. Action research can help teachers understand and improve their teaching.

Standardized and other\nformal assessments\nUnderstanding standardized testing is very important for beginning teachers as K-12 teaching is increasingly\ninfluenced by the administration and results of standardized tests. Teachers also need to be able to help parents and\nstudents understand test results. Consider the following scenarios.\n\u2022 Vanessa, a newly licensed physical education teacher, is applying for a job at a middle school.\nDuring the job interview the principal asks how she would incorporate key sixth grade math\nskills into her PE and health classes as the sixth grade students in the previous year did not\nattain Adequate Yearly Progress in mathematics.\n\u2022 Danielle, a first year science teacher in Ohio, is asked by Mr Volderwell, a recent immigrant\nfrom Turkey and the parent of a tenth grade son Marius, to help him understand test results.\nWhen Marius first arrived at school he took the Test of Cognitive Skills and scored on the eighty-\nfifth percentile whereas on the state Science Graduation test he took later in the school year he\nwas classified as \u201cproficient\u201d .\n\u2022 James, a third year elementary school teacher, attends a class in gifted education over summer\nas standardized tests from the previous year indicated that while overall his class did well in\nreading the top 20 per cent of his students did not learn as much as expected.\n\u2022 Miguel, a 1st grade student, takes two tests in fall and the results indicate that his grade\nequivalent scores are 3.3 for reading and 3.0 for math. William\u2019s parents want him immediately\npromoted into the second grade arguing that the test results indicate that he already can read\nand do math at the 3rd grade level. Greg, a first grade teacher explains to William\u2019s parents\nthat a grade equivalent score of 3.3 does not mean William can do third grade work.\nUnderstanding standardized testing is difficult as there are numerous terms and concepts to master and recent\nchanges in accountability under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) have increased the complexity of the\nconcepts and issues. In this chapter we focus on the information that beginning teachers need to know and start\nwith some basic concepts.\nBasic concepts\nStandardized tests are created by a team\u2014usually test experts from a commercial testing company who consult\nclassroom teachers and university faculty\u2014and are administered in standardized ways. Students not only respond\nto the same questions they also receive the same directions and have the same time limits. Explicit scoring criteria\nare used. Standardized tests are designed to be taken by many students within a state, province, or nation, and\nsometimes across nations. Teachers help administer some standardized tests and test manuals are provided that\nEducational Psychology 277 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\ncontain explicit details about the administration and scoring. For example, teachers may have to remove all the\nposters and charts from the classroom walls, read directions out loud to students using a script, and respond to\nstudent questions in a specific manner.\nCriterion referenced standardized tests measure student performance against a specific standard or criterion.\nFor example, newly hired firefighters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the United States have to meet\nphysical fitness standards by successfully completing a standardized physical fitness test that includes stair\nclimbing, using a ladder, advancing a hose, and simulating a rescue through a doorway (Human Resources\nDivision, nod.). Criterion referenced tests currently used in US schools are often tied to state content standards and\nprovide information about what students can and cannot do. For example, one of the content standards for fourth\ngrade reading in Kentucky is \u201cStudents will identify and describe the characteristics of fiction, nonfiction, poetry or\nplays\u201d (Combined Curriculum Document Reading 4.1, 2006) and so a report on an individual student would\nindicate if the child can accomplish this skill. The report may state that number or percentage of items that were\nsuccessfully completed (e.g. 15 out of 20, i.e. 75 per cent) or include descriptions such as basic, proficient, or\nadvanced which are based on decisions made about the percent of mastery necessary to be classified into these\ncategories.\nNorm referenced standardized tests report students\u2019 performance relative to others. For example, if a student\nscores on the seventy-second percentile in reading it means she outperforms 72 percent of the students who were\nincluded in the test\u2019s norm group. A norm group is a representative sample of students who completed the\nstandardized test while it was being developed. For state tests the norm group is drawn from the state whereas for\nnational tests the sample is drawn from the nation. Information about the norm groups is provided in a technical\ntest manual that is not typically supplied to teachers but should be available from the person in charge of testing in\nthe school district.\nReports from criterion and norm referenced tests provide different information. Imagine a nationalized\nmathematics test designed to basic test skills in second grade. If this test is norm referenced, and Alisha receives a\nreport indicating that she scored in the eighty-fifth percentile this indicates that she scored better than 85 per cent\nof the students in the norm group who took the test previously. If this test is criterion-referenced Alisha\u2019s report\nmay state that she mastered 65 per cent of the problems designed for her grade level. The relative percentage\nreported from the norm-referenced test provides information about Alisha\u2019s performance compared to other\nstudents whereas the criterion referenced test attempts to describe what Alisha or any student can or cannot do\nwith respect to whatever the test is designed to measure. When planning instruction classroom teachers need to\nknow what students can and cannot do so criterion referenced tests are typically more useful (Popham, 2004). The\ncurrent standard-based accountability and NCLB rely predominantly on criterion based tests to assess attainment\nof content-based standards. Consequently the use of standardized norm referenced tests in schools has diminished\nand is largely limited to diagnosis and placement of children with specific cognitive disabilities or exceptional\nabilities (Haertel & Herman, 2005).\nSome recent standardized tests can incorporate both criterion-referenced and norm referenced elements in to\nthe same test (Linn & Miller, 2005). That is, the test results not only provide information on mastery of a content\nstandard but also the percentage of students who attained that level of mastery.\n278 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nStandardized tests can be high stakes i.e. performance on the test has important consequences. These\nconsequences can be for students, e.g. passing a high school graduation test is required in order to obtain a diploma\nor passing PRAXIS II is a prerequisite to gain a teacher license. These consequences can be for schools, e.g. under\nNCLB an increasing percentage of students in every school must reach proficiency in math and reading each year.\nConsequences for schools who fail to achieve these gains include reduced funding and restructuring of the school\nbuilding. Under NCLB, the consequences are designed to be for the schools not individual students (Popham, 2005)\nand their test results may not accurately reflect what they know because students may not try hard when the tests\nhave low stakes for them (Wise & DeMars, 2005).\nUses of standardized tests\nStandardized tests are used for a variety of reasons and the same test is sometimes used for multiple purposes.\nAssessing students\u2019 progress in a wider context\nWell-designed teacher assessments provide crucial information about each student\u2019s achievement in the\nclassroom. However, teachers vary in the types of assessment they use so teacher assessments do not usually\nprovide information on how students\u2019 achievement compares to externally established criteria. Consider two eighth\ngrade students, Brian and Joshua, who received As in their middle school math classes. However, on the\nstandardized norm referenced math test Brian scored in the fiftieth percentile whereas Joshua scored in the\nninetieth percentile. This information is important to Brian and Joshua, their parents, and the school personnel.\nLikewise, two third grade students could both receive Cs on their report card in reading but one may pass 25 per\ncent and the other 65 per cent of the items on the Criterion Referenced State Test.\nThere are many reasons that students\u2019 performance on teacher assessments and standardized assessments may\ndiffer. Students may perform lower on the standardized assessment because their teachers have easy grading\ncriteria, or there is poor alignment between the content they were taught and that on the standardized test, or they\nare unfamiliar with the type of items on the standardized tests, or they have test anxiety, or they were sick on the\nday of the test. Students may perform higher on the standardized test than on classroom assessments because their\nteachers have hard grading criteria, or the student does not work consistently in class (e.g. does not turn in\nhomework) but will focus on a standardized test, or the student is adept at the multiple choice items on the\nstandardized tests but not at the variety of constructed response and performance items the teacher uses. We\nshould always be very cautious about drawing inferences from one kind of assessment.\nIn some states, standardized achievement tests are required for home-schooled students in order to provide\nparents and state officials information about the students\u2019 achievement in a wider context. For example, in New\nYork home-schooled students must take an approved standardized test every other year in grades four through\neight and every year in grades nine through twelve. These tests must be administered in a standardized manner and\nthe results filed with the Superintendent of the local school district. If a student does not take the tests or scores\nbelow the thirty-third percentile the home schooling program may be placed on probation (New York State\nEducation Department, 2005).\nDiagnosing student\u2019s strengths and weaknesses\nStandardized tests, along with interviews, classroom observations, medical examinations, and school records are\nused to help diagnose students\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. Often the standardized tests used for this purpose are\nEducational Psychology 279 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nadministered individually to determine if the child has a disability. For example, if a kindergarten child is having\ntrouble with oral communication, a standardized language development test could be administered to determine if\nthere are difficulties with understanding the meaning of words or sentence structures, noticing sound differences in\nsimilar words, or articulating words correctly (Peirangelo & Guiliani, 2002). It would also be important to\ndetermine if the child was a recent immigrant, had a hearing impairment or mental retardation. The diagnosis of\nlearning disabilities typically involves the administration of at least two types of standardized tests\u2014an aptitude test\nto assess general cognitive functioning and an achievement test to assess knowledge of specific content areas\n(Peirangelo & Guiliani, 2006). We discuss the difference between aptitude and achievement tests later in this\nchapter.\nSelecting students for specific programs\nStandardized tests are often used to select students for specific programs. For example, the SAT (Scholastic\nAssessment Test) and ACT (American College Test) are norm referenced tests used to help determine if high school\nstudents are admitted to selective colleges. Norm referenced standardized tests are also used, among other criteria,\nto determine if students are eligible for special education or gifted and talented programs. Criterion referenced tests\nare used to determine which students are eligible for promotion to the next grade or graduation from high school.\nSchools that place students in ability groups including high school college preparation, academic, or vocational\nprograms may also use norm referenced or criterion referenced standardized tests. When standardized tests are\nused as an essential criteria for placement they are obviously high stakes for students.\nAssisting teachers\u2019 planning\nNorm referenced and criterion referenced standardized tests, among other sources of information about\nstudents, can help teachers make decisions about their instruction. For example, if a social studies teacher learns\nthat most of the students did very well on a norm referenced reading test administered early in the school year he\nmay adapt his instruction and use additional primary sources. A reading teacher after reviewing the poor end-of-\nthe-year criterion referenced standardized reading test results may decide that next year she will modify the\ntechniques she uses. A biology teacher may decide that she needs to spend more time on genetics as her students\nscored poorly on that section of the standardized criterion referenced science test. These are examples of\nassessment for learning which involves data-based decision making. It can be difficult for beginning teachers to\nlearn to use standardized test information appropriately, understanding that test scores are important information\nbut also remembering that there are multiple reasons for students\u2019 performance on a test.\nAccountability\nStandardized tests results are increasingly used to hold teachers and administrators accountable for students\u2019\nlearning. Prior to 2002, many States required public dissemination of students\u2019 progress but under NCLB school\ndistricts in all states are required to send report cards to parents and the public that include results of standardized\ntests for each school. Providing information about students\u2019 standardized tests is not new as newspapers began\nprinting summaries of students\u2019 test results within school districts in the 1970s and 1980s (Popham, 2005).\nHowever, public accountability of schools and teachers has been increasing in the US and many other countries and\nthis increased accountability impacts the public perception and work of all teachers including those teaching in\nsubjects or grade levels not being tested.\n280 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nFor example, Erin, a middle school social studies teacher, said:\n\u201cAs a teacher in a 'non-testing' subject area, I spend substantial instructional time suporting the\nstandardized testing requirements. For example, our school has instituted 'word of the day', which\nencourages teachers to use, define, and incorporate terminology often used in the tests (e.g.\n\"compare\", \"oxymoron\" etc.). I use the terms in my class as often as possible and incorporate them\ninto written assignments. I also often use test questions of similar formats to the standardized tests\nin my own subject assessments (e.g. multiple choice questions with double negatives, short answer\nand extended response questions) as I believe that practice in the test question formats will help\nstudents be more successful in those subjects that are being assessed.\u201d\nAccountability and standardized testing are two components of Standards Based Reform in Education that was\ninitiated in the USA in 1980s. The two other components are academic content standards which are described later\nin this chapter and teacher quality which was discussed in Chapter 1.\nTypes of standardized tests\nAchievement tests\nSummarizing the past: K-12 achievement tests are designed to assess what students have learned in a specific\ncontent area. These tests include those specifically designed by states to access mastery of state academic content\nstandards (see more details below) as well as general tests such as the California Achievement Tests, The\nComprehensive Tests of Basic Skills, Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Metropolitan Achievement Tests, and the Stanford\nAchievement Tests. These general tests are designed to be used across the nation and so will not be as closely\naligned with state content standards as specifically designed tests. Some states and Canadian Provinces use\nspecifically designed tests to assess attainment of content standards and also a general achievement test to provide\nnormative information.\nStandardized achievement tests are designed to be used for students in kindergarten though high school. For\nyoung children questions are presented orally, and students may respond by pointing to pictures, and the subtests\nare often not timed. For example, on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (http://www.riverpub.com/) designed for\nstudents are young as kindergarten the vocabulary test assesses listening vocabulary. The teacher reads a word and\nmay also read a sentence containing the word. Students are then asked to choose one of three pictorial response\noptions.\nAchievement tests are used as one criterion for obtaining a license in a variety of professions including nursing,\nphysical therapy, and social work, accounting, and law. Their use in teacher education is recent and is part of the\nincreased accountability of public education and most States require that teacher education students take\nachievement tests in order to obtain a teaching license. For those seeking middle school and high school licensure\nthese are tests are in the content area of the major or minor (e.g. mathematics, social studies); for those seeking\nlicenses in early childhood and elementary the tests focus on knowledge needed to teach students of specific grade\nlevels. The most commonly used tests, the PRAXIS series, tests I and II, developed by Educational Testing Service,\ninclude three types of tests (www.ets.org):\n\u2022 Subject Assessments, these test on general and subject-specific teaching skills and knowledge. They include\nboth multiple-choice and constructed-response test items.\nEducational Psychology 281 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\n\u2022 Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) Tests assess general pedagogical knowledge at four grade levels:\nEarly Childhood, K-6, 5-9, and 7-12. These tests are based on case studies and include constructed-response\nand multiple-choice items. Much of the content in this textbook is relevant to the PLT tests.\n\u2022 Teaching Foundations Tests assess pedagogy in five areas: multi-subject (elementary), English, Language\nArts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science.\nThese tests include constructed-response and multiple-choice items which tests teacher education students. The\nscores needed in order to pass each test vary and are determined by each state.\nDiagnostic tests\nProfiling skills and abilities: Some standardized tests are designed to diagnose strengths and weaknesses in\nskills, typically reading or mathematics skills. For example, an elementary school child may have difficult in reading\nand one or more diagnostic tests would provide detailed information about three components: (1) word recognition,\nwhich includes phonological awareness (pronunciation), decoding, and spelling; (2) comprehension which includes\nvocabulary as well as reading and listening comprehension, and (3) fluency (Joshi 2003). Diagnostic tests are often\nadministered individually by school psychologists, following standardized procedures. The examiner typically\nrecords not only the results on each question but also observations of the child\u2019s behavior such as distractibility or\nfrustration. The results from the diagnostic standardized tests are used in conjunction with classroom observations,\nschool and medical records, as well as interviews with teachers, parents and students to produce a profile of the\nstudent\u2019s skills and abilities, and where appropriate diagnose a learning disability.\nAptitude tests\nPredicting the future: Aptitude tests, like achievement tests, measure what students have learned, but rather\nthan focusing on specific subject matter learned in school (e.g. math, science, English or social studies), the test\nitems focus on verbal, quantitative, problem solving abilities that are learned in school or in the general culture\n(Linn & Miller, 2005). These tests are typically shorter than achievement tests and can be useful in predicting\ngeneral school achievement. If the purpose of using a test is to predict success in a specific subject (e.g. language\narts) the best prediction is past achievement in language arts and so scores on a language arts achievement test\nwould be useful. However when the predictions are more general (e.g. success in college) aptitude tests are often\nused. According to the test developers, both the ACT and SAT Reasoning tests, used to predict success in college,\nassess general educational development and reasoning, analysis and problem solving as well as questions on\nmathematics, reading and writing (http://www.collegeboard.com; http://www.act.org/). The SAT Subject Tests\nthat focus on mastery of specific subjects like English, history, mathematics, science, and language are used by\nsome colleges as entrance criteria and are more appropriately classified as achievement tests than aptitude tests\neven though they are used to predict the future.\nTests designed to assess general learning ability have traditionally been called Intelligence Tests but are now\noften called learning ability tests, cognitive ability tests, scholastic aptitude tests, or school ability tests. The shift in\nterminology reflects the extensive controversy over the meaning of the term intelligence and that its traditional use\nwas associated with inherited capacity (Linn & Miller 2005). The more current terms emphasize that tests measure\ndeveloped ability in learning not innate capacity. The Cognitive Abilities Test assesses K-12 students' abilities to\n282 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nreason with words, quantitative concepts, and nonverbal (spatial) pictures. The Woodcock Johnson III contains\ncognitive abilities tests as well as achievement tests for ages 2 to 90 years (http://www.riverpub.com).\nHigh-stakes testing by states\nWhile many States had standardized testing programs prior to 2000, the number of state-wide tests has grown\nenormously since then because NCLB required that all states test students in reading and mathematics annually in\ngrades third through eighth and at least once in high school by 2005-6. Twenty-three states expanded their testing\nprograms during 2005-6 and additional tests are being added as testing in science is required by 2007-8. Students\nwith disabilities and English language learners must be included in the testing and provided a variety of\naccommodations so the majority of staff in school districts are involved in testing in some way (Olson, 2005). In\nthis section we focus on these tests and their implications for teachers and students.\nStandards based assessment\nAcademic content standards\nNCLB mandates that states must develop academic content standards that specify what students are expected to\nknow or be able to do at each grade level. These content standards used to be called goals and objectives and it is\nnot clear why the labels have changed (Popham, 2004). Content standards are not easy to develop\u2014if they are too\nbroad and not related to grade level, teachers cannot hope to prepare students to meet the standards.\nAn example, a broad standard in reading is:\n\u201cStudents should be able to construct meaning through experiences with literature, cultural events\nand philosophical discussion\u201d (no grade level indicated). (American Federation of Teachers, 2006, p.\n6).\nStandards that are too narrow can result in a restricted curriculum. An example of a narrow standard might be:\nStudents can define, compare and contrast, and provide a variety of examples of synonyms and\nantonyms.\nA stronger standard is:\n\u201cStudents should apply knowledge of word origins, derivations, synonyms, antonyms, and idioms to\ndetermine the meaning of words (grade 4) (American Federation of Teachers, 2006, p. 6).\nThe American Federation of Teachers conducted a study in 2005-6 and reported that some of the standards in\nreading, math and science were weak in 32 states. States set the strongest standards in science followed by\nmathematics. Standards in reading were particularly problematic and with one-fifth of all reading standards\nredundant across the grade levels, i.e. word-by-word repetition across grade levels at least 50 per cent of the time\n(American Federation of Teachers, 2006).\nEven if the standards are strong, there are often so many of them that it is hard for teachers to address them all\nin a school year. Content standards are developed by curriculum specialists who believe in the importance of their\nsubject area so they tend to develop large numbers of standards for each subject area and grade level. At first\nglance, it may appear that there are only several broad standards, but under each standard there are subcategories\ncalled goals, benchmarks, indicators or objectives (Popham, 2004). For example, Idaho\u2019s first grade mathematics\nEducational Psychology 283 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nstandard, judged to be of high quality (AFT 2000) contains five broad standards, including 10 goals and a total of\n29 objectives (Idaho Department of Education, 2005-6).\nAlignment of standards, testing and classroom curriculum\nThe state tests must be aligned with strong content standards in order to provide useful feedback about student\nlearning. If there is a mismatch between the academic content standards and the content that is assessed then the\ntest results cannot provide information about students\u2019 proficiency on the academic standards. A mismatch not\nonly frustrates the students taking the test, teachers, and administrators it undermines the concept of\naccountability and the \u201ctheory of action\u201d (See box \u201cDeciding for yourself about the research\u201d) that underlies the\nNCLB. Unfortunately, the 2006 Federation of Teachers study indicated that in only 11 states were all the tests\naligned with state standards (American Federation of Teachers, 2006).\nState standards and their alignment with state assessments should be widely available\u2014preferably posted on the\nstates websites so they can be accessed by school personnel and the public. A number of states have been slow to do\nthis.Table 43 summarizes which states had strong content standards, tests that were aligned with state standards,\nand adequate documents on online. Only 11 states were judged to meet all three criteria in 2006.\nTable 43: Strong content standards, alignment, and transparency: evaluation for each state in 2006 (Adapted\nfrom American Federation of Teachers, 2006).\nStandards are Test documents match Testing documents\nstrong standards online\nAlabama +\nAlaska + +\nArizona + +\nArkansas +\nCalifornia + + +\nColorado +\nConnecticut\nDelaware +\nDistrict of Columbia + +\nFlorida + +\nGeorgia + +\nHawaii +\nIdaho + +\nIllinois +\n284 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIndiana + +\nIowa +\nKansas + +\nKentucky + +\nLouisiana + + +\nMaine +\nMaryland +\nMassachusetts + +\nMichigan + +\nMinnesota + +\nMississippi +\nMissouri\nMontana\nNebraska\nNevada + + +\nNew Hampshire + +\nNew Jersey +\nNew Mexico + + +\nNew York + + +\nNorth Carolina +\nNorth Dakota + +\nOhio + + +\nOklahoma + +\nOregon + +\nPennsylvania +\nRhode Island + +\nSouth Carolina\nEducational Psychology 285 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nSouth Dakota + +\nTennessee + + +\nTexas + +\nUtah +\nSampling content\nWhen numerous standards have been developed it is impossible for tests to assess all of the standards every\nyear, so the tests sample the content, i.e. measure some but not all the standards every year. Content standards\ncannot be reliably assessed with only one or two items so the decision to assess one content standard often requires\nnot assessing another. This means if there are too many content standards a significant proportion of them are not\nmeasured each year. In this situation, teachers try to guess which content standards will be assessed that year and\nalign their teaching on those specific standards. Of course if these guesses are incorrect students will have studied\ncontent not on the test and not studied content that is on the test. Some argue that this is a very serious problem\nwith current state testing and Popham (2004) an expert on testing even said: \u201cWhat a muddleheaded way to run a\ntesting program.\u201d (p. 79)\nAdequate Yearly Progress (AYP)\nUnder NCLB three levels of achievement, basic, proficient and advanced, must be specified for each grade level\nin each content area by each state. States were required to set a time table from 2002 that insured an increasing\npercentage of students would reach the proficient levels such that by 2013-14, soevery child is performing at or the\nproficient level. Schools and school districts who meet this timetable are said to meet adequate yearly progress\n(AYP).\nBecause every child must reach proficiency by 2013-14 greater increases are required for those schools that had\nlarger percentages of initially lower performing students.\nExhibit 16 illustrates the progress needed in three hypothetical schools. School A, initially the lowest performing\nschool, has to increase the number of students reaching proficiency by an average of 6 per cent each year, the\nincrease is 3 per cent for School B, and the increase is only 1 per cent for School C. Also, the checkpoint targets in\nthe timetables are determined by the lower performing schools. This is illustrated on the figure by the arrow\u2014it is\nobvious that School A has to make significant improvements by 2007-8 but School C does not have to improve at all\nby 2007-8. This means that schools that are initially lower performing are much more likely to fail to make AYP\nduring the initial implementation years of NCLB.\n286 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nExhibit 15: Adequate Yearly Progress requires greater student improvement in\nschools with lower levels of initial proficiency\nSchools A, B and C all must reach 10 per cent student proficiency by 2013-4. However the school that initially\nhas the lowest level of performance (A) has to increase the percentage of students proficient at a greater rate than\nschools with middle (B) or high (C) levels of initial proficiency rates.\nSubgroups\nFor a school to achieve AYP not only must overall percentages of the students reach proficiency but subgroups\nmust also reach proficiency in a process called desegregation. Prior to NCLB state accountability systems typically\nfocused on overall student performance but this did not provide incentives for schools to focus on the neediest\nstudents, e.g. those children living below the poverty line (Hess & Petrilli, 2006). Under NCLB the percentages for\neach racial/ethnic group in the school (white, African American, Latino, Native American etc.), low income\nstudents, students with limited English proficiency, and students with disabilities are all calculated if there are\nenough students in the subgroup. A school may fail AYP if one group, e.g. English language learners do not make\nadequate progress. This means that it is more difficult for large diverse schools (typically urban schools) that have\nmany subgroups to meet the demands of AYP than smaller schools with homogeneous student body (Novak &\nFuller, 2003). Schools can also fail to make AYP if too few students take the exam. The drafters of the law were\nconcerned that some schools might encourage low-performing students to stay home on the days of testing in order\nto artificially inflate the scores. So on average at least 95 per cent of any subgroup must take the exams each year or\nthe school may fail to make AYP (Hess & Petrilli, 2006).\nSanctions\nSchools failing to meet AYP for consecutive years, experience a series of increasing sanctions. If a school fails to\nmake AYP for two years in row it is labeled \u201cin need of improvement\u201d and school personnel must come up with a\nschool improvement plan that is based on \u201cscientifically based research\u201d. In addition, students must be offered the\nEducational Psychology 287 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\noption of transferring to a better performing public school within the district. If the school fails for three\nconsecutive years, free tutoring must be provided to needy students. A fourth year of failure requires \u201ccorrective\nactions\u201d which may include staffing changes, curriculum reforms or extensions of the school day or year. If the\nschool fails to meet AYP for five consecutive years the district must \u201crestructure\u201d which involves major actions such\nas replacing the majority of the staff, hiring an educational management company, turning the school over to the\nstate.\nGrowth or value added models\nOne concern with how AYP is calculated is that it is based on an absolute level of student performance at one\npoint in time and does not measure how much students improve during each year. To illustrate this, Exhibit 16\nshows six students whose science test scores improved from fourth to fifth grade. The circle represents a student\u2019s\nscore in fourth grade and the tip of the arrow the test score in fifth grade. Note that students 1, 2, and 3 all reach the\nlevel of proficiency (the horizontal dotted line) but students 4, 5 and 6 do not. However, also notice that students 2,\n5 and 6 improved much more than students 1, 3, and 4. The current system of AYP rewards students reaching the\nproficiency level rather than students\u2019 growth. This is a particular problem for low performing schools who may be\ndoing an excellent job of improving achievement (students 5 and 6) but do not make the proficiency level. The US\nDepartment of Education in 2006 allowed some states to include growth measures into their calculations of AYP.\nWhile growth models traditionally tracked the progress of individual students, the term is sometimes used to refer\nto growth of classes or entire schools (Shaul, 2006).\nExhibit 16: An illustration of value added vs proficiency approach to assessment.\nEach arrow represents the mathematics achievement results of one student who was\ntested in the fourth grade (shown by the dot) and also the fifth grade (shown by the tip\nof the arrow).\nSome states include growth information on their report cards. For example, Tennessee (http://www.k-\n12.state.tn.us/rptcrd05/) provides details on which schools meet the AYP but also whether the students\u2019 scores on\ntests represent average growth, above average, or below average growth within the state. Exhibit 17 illustrates in a\n288 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nsimple way the kind of information that is provided. Students in schools A, B, and C all reached proficiency and\nAYP but in Schools D, E, and F did not. However, students in schools A and D had low growth, in schools B and E\naverage growth, in schools C and F high growth. Researchers have found that in some schools students have high\nlevels of achievement but do not grow as much as expected (School A), and also that in some schools, the\nachievement test scores are not high but the students are growing or learning a lot (School F). These are called\n\u201cschool effects\u201d and represent the effect of the school on the learning of the students.\nSchool A School B School C\ntnemeveihcA\nProficiency\nSchool D School E School F\nLow growth Average growth High growth\nExhibit 17: Proficiency and growth information\nGrowth over one year\nSchools can vary on overall school achievement (proficiency) as well as the amount of growth in student\nlearning, For example schools A, B, and C all have high achievement levels but only in School C do students have,\non average, high growth. Schools D, C, and F all have low levels of proficiency but only in school D do students, on\naverage, have low growth.\nGrowth models have intuitive appeal to teachers as they focus on how much a student learned during the school\nyear\u2014not what the student knew at the start of the school year. The current research evidence suggests that\nteachers matter a lot\u2014i.e. students learn much more with some teachers than others. For example, in one study\nlow-achieving fourth grade students in Dallas, Texas were followed for three years and 90 per cent of those who had\neffective teachers passed the seventh grade math test whereas only 42 per cent of those with ineffective teachers\npassed (cited in Bracey, 2004). Unfortunately, the same study reported that low achieving students were more\nlikely to be assigned to ineffective teachers for three years in a row than high achieving students. Some policy\nmakers believe that teachers who are highly effective should receive rewards including higher salaries or bonuses\nand that a primary criterion of effectiveness is assessed by growth models, i.e. how much students learn during a\nyear (Hershberg, 2004). However, using growth data to make decisions about teachers is controversial as there is\nmuch more statistical uncertainty when using growth measures for a small group or students (e.g. one teacher\u2019s\nstudents) than larger groups (e.g. all fourth graders in a school district).\nGrowth models are also used to provide information about the patterns of growth among subgroups of students\nthat may arise from the instructional focus of the teachers. For example, it may be that highest performing students\nin the classroom gain the most and the lowest performing students gain the least. This suggests that the teacher is\nfocusing on the high achieving students and giving less attention to low achieving students. In contrast, it may be\nthe highest performing students gain the least and the low performing students grow the most suggesting the\nteacher focuses on the low performing students and paying little attention to the high performing students. If the\nEducational Psychology 289 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nteacher focuses on the students \u201cin the middle\u201d they may grow the most and the highest and lowest performing\nstudents grow the least. Proponents of the value-added or growth models argue that teachers can use this\ninformation to help them make informed decisions about their teaching (Hershberg, 2004).\nDiffering state standards\nUnder NCLB each state devises their own academic content standards, assessments, and levels of proficiency.\nSome researchers have suggested that the rules of NCLB have encouraged states to set low levels of proficiency so it\nis easier to meet AYP each year (Hoff, 2002). Stringency of state levels of proficiency can be examined by\ncomparing state test scores to scores on a national achievement test called the National Assessment of Educational\nProgress (NAEP). NCLB requires that states administer reading and math NAEP tests to a sample of fourth and\neighth grade students every other year. The NAEP is designed to assess the progress of students at the state-wide or\nnational level not individual schools or students and is widely respected as a well designed test that uses current\nbest practices in testing. A large percentage of each test includes constructed-response questions and questions that\nrequire the use of calculators and other materials (http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard).\nExhibit 18 illustrates that two states, Colorado and Missouri had very different state performance standards for\nthe fourth grade reading/language arts tests in 2003. On the state assessment 67 per cent of the students in\nColorado but only 21 per cent of the students in Missouri were classified as proficient. However, on the NAEP tests\n34 per cent of Colorado students and 28 per cent of Missouri students were classified as proficient (Linn 2005).\nThese differences demonstrate that there is no common meaning in current definitions of \u201cproficient achievement\u201d\nestablished by the states.\nExhibit 18: Relationship between state proficiency levels and\nscores on NAEP (Adapted from Linn 2005)\nImplications for beginning teachers:\nDr Mucci is the principal of a suburban fourth through sixth grade school in Ohio that continues to\nmeet AYP. We asked her what beginning teachers should know about high stakes testing by the\n290 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nstates. \"I want beginning teachers to be familiar with the content standards in Ohio because they\nclearly define what all students should know and be able to do. Not only does teaching revolve\naround the standards, I only approve requests for materials or professional development if these are\nrelated to the standards. I want beginning teachers to understand the concept of data-based decision\nmaking. Every year I meet with all the teachers in each grade level (e.g. fourth grade) to look for\ntrends in the previous year's test results and consider remedies based on these trends. I also meet\nwith each teacher in the content areas that are tested and discuss every student's achievement in his\nor her class so we can develop an instructional plan for every student. All interventions with students\nare research based. Every teacher in the school is responsible for helping to implement these\ninstructional plans, for example the music or art teachers must incorporate some reading and math\ninto their classes. I also ask all teachers to teach test taking skills, by using similar formats to the\nstate tests, enforcing time limits, making sure students learn to distinguish between questions that\nrequired an extended response using complete sentences versus those that only requires one or two\nwords, and ensuring that students answer what is actually being asked. We begin this early in the\nschool year and continue to work on these skills, so by spring, students are familiar with the format,\nand therefore less anxious about the state test. We do everything possible to set each student up for\nsuccess.\"\nThe impact of testing on classroom teachers does not just occur in Dr Mucci\u2019s middle school. A national survey\nof over 4,000 teachers indicated that the majority of teachers reported that the state mandated tests were\ncompatible with their daily instruction and were based on curriculum frameworks that all teachers should follow.\nThe majority of teachers also reported teaching test taking skills and encouraging students to work hard and\nprepare. Elementary school teachers reported greater impact of the high stakes tests: 56 per cent reported the tests\ninfluenced their teaching daily or a few times a week compared to 46 per cent of middle school teacher and 28 per\ncent of high school teachers. Even though the teachers had adapted their instruction because of the standardized\ntests they were skeptical about them with 40 per cent reporting that teachers had found ways to raise test scores\nwithout improving student learning and over 70 per cent reporting that the test scores were not an accurate\nmeasure of what minority students know and can do (Pedulla, Abrams, Madaus, Russell, Ramos, & Miao; 2003).\nInternational testing\nTesting in the Canadian provinces\nCanada has developed a system of testing in the provinces as well as national testing. Each province undertakes\nits own curriculum based assessments. At the elementary school level provinces assess reading and writing\n(language arts) as well as mathematics (also called numeracy). In the middle grades science and social studies is\noften assessed in addition to language arts and mathematics. Summary results of these tests are published but there\nare no specific consequences for poor performance for schools. In addition, these tests are not high stakes for\nstudents. At the secondary school level high stakes curriculum based exit tests are common\n(http://edudata.educ.ubc.ca/Data_Pages/PanCan.htm).\nCanada has developed pan-Canada assessment in mathematics, reading and writing, and science that are\nadministered to a random sample of schools across the country. These assessments are intended to determine\nwhether, on average, students across Canada reach similar levels of performance at about the same age\nEducational Psychology 291 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\n(http://www.cmec.ca/pcap/indexe.stm). They are not intended to provide individual feedback to students are\nsimilar in purpose to the NAEP tests administered in the United States.\nInternational comparisons\nAlong with the increasing globalization has come an interest with international comparisons in educational\nachievement and practices and more than 40 countries participate in two major testing initiatives. The Trends in\nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) have assessed students in fourth and eighth grades four\ntimes through 2007. The Programme for International Assessment (PISA) have assessed 15-year-olds in reading,\nmathematical and science literacy in more than forty countries on three times since 2000. The items on both series\nof tests include multiple choice, short answer and constructed response formats and are translated into more than\n30 languages.\nPolicy makers are often interested in the comparison of average students\u2019 scores across countries. For example,\nin eighth grade science on the 2003 TIMMS students from Canada, United States, Hong Kong, and Australia scored\nsignificantly higher than the international average whereas students from Egypt, Indonesia, and the Philippines\nscored significantly below the international average (TIMMS 2003). On the mathematics test in the 2003 PISA, 15-\nyear-old students from Hong Kong, China and Finland scored higher than students from Canada and New Zealand\nwho in turn scored higher than the students from United States and Spain, who in turn scored higher than the\nstudent from Mexico and Brazil (OECD, 2004).\nBoth series of tests also collect survey data from students, teachers or school principals allowing for information\nabout instructional practices and student characteristics. For example, teachers from the Philippines report\nspending almost twice as much time teaching science to fourth graders than in the United States (Martin, Mullis,\nGonzalez, & Chrostowski, (2004). Student reports from PISA indicate that there is considerable cross-country\nvariation in how much students feel anxiety when doing mathematics. Students in France, Italy, Japan, Korea\nreport feeling the most anxious whereas students in Denmark, Finland and Netherlands and Sweden feel the least\nanxious (OECD 2004).\nUnderstanding test results\nIn order to understand test results from standardized tests it is important to be familiar with a variety of terms\nand concepts that are fundamental to \u201cmeasurement theory\u201d, the academic study of measurement and assessment.\nTwo major areas in measurement theory, reliability and validity, were discussed in the previous chapter; in this\nchapter we focus on concepts and terms associated with test scores.\nThe basics\nFrequency distributions\nA frequency distribution is a listing of the number of students who obtained each score on a test. If 31 students\ntake a test, and the scores range from 11 to 30 then the frequency distribution might look like Table 44. We also\nshow the same set of scores on a histogram or bar graph inExhibit 20. The horizontal (or x axis) represents the\nscore on the test and the vertical axis (y axis) represents the number or frequency of students. Plotting a frequency\ndistribution helps us see what scores are typical and how much variability there are in the scores. We describe more\nprecise ways of determining typical scores and variability next.\n292 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nTable 44: Frequency distribution for 30 scores\nScore on test Frequency Central tendency measures\n17 1\n18 1\n19 0\n20 3\n21 2\n22 6 Mode\n23 3 Median\n24 2 Mean\n25 0\n26 2\n27 6 Mode\n28 2\n29 2\n30 1\nTOTAL 31\nExhibit 19: Tests scores from Table 44represented as a bar graph\nEducational Psychology 293 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nCentral tendency and variability\nThere are three common ways of measuring central tendency or which score(s) are typical. The mean is\ncalculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. In the example in Table 44, the mean is\n24. The median is the \u201cmiddle\u201d score of the distribution\u2014that is half of the scores are above the median and half are\nbelow. The median on the distribution is 23 because 15 scores are above 23 and 15 are below. The mode is the score\nthat occurs most often. In Table 44 there are actually two modes 22 and 27 and so this distribution is described as\nbimodal. Calculating the mean, median and mode are important as each provides different information for\nteachers. The median represents the score of the \u201cmiddle\u201d students, with half scoring above and below, but does not\ntell us about the scores on the test that occurred most often. The mean is important for some statistical calculations\nbut is highly influenced by a few extreme scores (called outliers) but the median is not. To illustrate this, imagine a\ntest out of 20 points taken by 10 students, and most do very well but one student does very poorly. The scores might\nbe 4, 18, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 20, 20. The mean is 17.5 (170/10) but if the lowest score (4) is eliminated the mean is\nnow is 1.5 points higher at 19 (171/9). However, in this example the median remains at 19 whether the lowest score\nis included. When there are some extreme scores the median is often more useful for teachers in indicating the\ncentral tendency of the frequency distribution.\nThe measures of central tendency help us summarize scores that are representative, but they do not tell us\nanything about how variable or how spread out are the scores. Exhibit 20 illustrates sets of scores from two\ndifferent schools on the same test for fourth graders. Note that the mean for each is 40 but in School A the scores\nare much less spread out. A simple way to summarize variability is the range, which is the lowest score subtracted\nfrom the lowest score. In School A with low variability the range is (45\u201435) = 10; in the school B the range is ( 55-\n22 = 33).\nExhibit 20: Fourth grade math scores in two different schools with the\nsame mean but different variability\nHowever, the range is only based on two scores in the distribution, the highest and lowest scores, and so does\nnot represent variability in all the scores. The standard deviation is based on how much, on average, all the\n294 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nscores deviate from the mean. In the example in Exhibit 17 the standard deviations are 7.73 for School A and 2.01\nfor School B. In the exercise below we demonstrate how to calculate the standard deviation.\nCalculating a standard deviation\nExample: The scores from 11 students on a quiz are 4, 7, 6, 3, 10, 7, 3, 7, 5, 5, and 9\n5.

When a standardized test is administered to a very large number of students the distribution of scores\nEducational Psychology 295 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nis typically similar, with many students scoring close to the mean, and fewer scoring much higher or lower than the\nmean. When the distribution of scores looks like the bell shape shown in Exhibit 19 it is called a normal\ndistribution. In the diagram we did not draw in the scores of individual students as we did in Exhibit 20, because\ndistributions typically only fall on a normal curve when there are a large number of students; too many to show\nindividually. A normal distribution is symmetric, and the mean, median and mode are all the same.\nExhibit 22: Bell shaped curve of normal distribution\nNormal curve distributions are very important in education and psychology because of the relationship between\nthe mean, standard deviation, and percentiles. In all normal distributions 34 per cent of the scores fall between the\nmean and one standard deviation of the mean. Intelligence tests often are constructed to have a mean of 100 and\nstandard deviation of 15 and we illustrate that in Exhibit 15.\nExhibit 23: Normal distribution for an IQ test with mean 100 and standard\ndeviation 15\n296 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nIn this example, 34 per cent of the scores are between 100 and 115 and as well, 34 per cent of the scores lie\nbetween 85 and 100. This means that 68 per cent of the scores are between -1 and +1 standard deviations of the\nmean (i.e. 85 and 115). Note than only 14 per cent of the scores are between +1 and +2 standard deviations of the\nmean and only 2 per cent fall above +2 standard deviations of the mean.\nIn a normal distribution a student who scores the mean value is always in the fiftieth percentile because the\nmean and median are the same. A score of +1 standard deviation above the mean (e.g. 115 in the example above) is\nthe 84 per cent tile (50 per cent and 34 per cent of the scores were below 115). In Exhibit 10 we represent the\npercentile equivalents to the normal curve and we also show standard scores. 1\nKinds of test scores\nA standard score expresses performance on a test in terms of standard deviation units above of below the\nmean (Linn & Miller, 2005). There are a variety of standard scores:\nZ-score: One type of standard score is a z-score, in which the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This\nmeans that a z-score tells us directly how many standard deviations the score is above or below the mean. For\nexample, if a student receives a z score of 2 her score is two standard deviations above the mean or the eighty-\nfourth percentile. A student receiving a z score of -1.5 scored one and one half deviations below the mean. Any score\nfrom a normal distribution can be converted to a z score if the mean and standard deviation is known. The formula\nis:\nScore\u2212meanscore\nZ\u2212score=\nStandarddeviation\nSo, if the score is 130 and the mean is 100 and the standard deviation is 15 then the calculation is:\n130\u2212100\nZ= =2\n15\nIf you look at Exhibit 15 you can see that this is correct\u2014a score of 130 is 2 standard deviations above the mean\nand so the z score is 2.\nT-score: A T-score has a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. This means that a T-score of 70 is two\nstandard deviations above the mean and so is equivalent to a z-score of 2.\nStanines: Stanines (pronounced staynines) are often used for reporting students\u2019 scores and are based on a\nstandard nine point scale and with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. They are only reported as whole\nnumbers and Figure 11-10 shows their relation to the normal curve.\nGrade equivalent sores\nA grade equivalent score provides an estimate of test performance based on grade level and months of the school\nyear (Popham, 2005, p. 288). A grade equivalent score of 3.7 means the performance is at that expected of a third\ngrade student in the seventh month of the school year. Grade equivalents provide a continuing range of grade levels\nand so can be considered developmental scores. Grade equivalent scores are popular and seem easy to understand\nhowever they are typically misunderstood. If, James, a fourth grade student, takes a reading test and the grade\nequivalent score is 6.0; this does not mean that James can do sixth grade work. It means that James performed on\n1 Exhibit 11.10 must be re-drawn. Please contact the Associate Editor for the original.\nEducational Psychology 297 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\nthe fourth grade test as a sixth grade student is expected to perform. Testing companies calculate grade equivalents\nby giving one test to several grade levels. For example a test designed for fourth graders would also be given to third\nand fifth graders. The raw scores are plotted and a trend line is established and this is used to establish the grade\nequivalents. Note that in Error: Reference source not found the trend line extends beyond the grades levels actually\ntested so a grade equivalent above 5.0 or below 3.0 is based solely on the estimated trend lines.\nExhibit 24: Using trend lines to estimate grade equivalent\nscores\nGrade equivalent scores also assume that the subject matter that is being tested is emphasized at each grade\nlevel to the same amount and that mastery of the content accumulates at a mostly constant rate (Popham, 2005).\nMany testing experts warn that grade equivalent scores should be interpreted with considerable skepticism and that\nparents often have serious misconceptions about grade equivalent scores. Parents of high achieving students may\nhave an inflated sense of what their child\u2019s levels of achievement.\nIssues with standardized tests\nMany people have very strong views about the role of standardized tests in education. Some believe they provide\nan unbiased way to determine an individual\u2019s cognitive skills as well as the quality of a school or district. Others\nbelieve that scores from standardized tests are capricious, do not represent what students know, and are misleading\nwhen used for accountability purposes. Many educational psychologists and testing experts have nuanced views\nand make distinctions between the information standardized tests can provide about students\u2019 performances and\nhow the tests results are interpreted and used. In this nuanced view, many of the problems associated with\nstandardized tests arise from their high stakes use such as using the performance on one test to determine selection\ninto a program, graduation, or licensure, or judging a school as high vs low performing.\nAre standardized tests biased?\nIn a multicultural society one crucial question is: Are standardized tests biased against certain social class,\nracial, or ethnic groups? This question is much more complicated than it seems because bias has a variety of\n298 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nmeanings. An everyday meaning of bias often involves the fairness of using standardized test results to predict\npotential performance of disadvantaged students who have previously had few educational resources. For example,\nshould Dwayne, a high school student who worked hard but had limited educational opportunities because of the\npoor schools in his neighborhood and few educational resources in his home, be denied graduation from high\nschool because of his score on one test. It was not his fault that he did not have the educational resources and if\ngiven a chance with a change his environment (e.g. by going to college) his performance may blossom. In this view,\ntest scores reflect societal inequalities and can punish students who are less privileged, and are often erroneously\ninterpreted as a reflection of a fixed inherited capacity. Researchers typically consider bias in more technical ways\nand three issues will be discussed: item content and format; accuracy of predictions, and stereotype threat.\nItem content and format. Test items may be harder for some groups than others. An example of social class bias\nin a multiple choice item asked students the meaning of the term field. The students were asked to read the initial\nsentence in italics and then select the response that had the same meaning of field (Popham 2004, p. 24):\nMy dad\u2019s field is computer graphics.\na. The pitcher could field his position\nb. We prepared the field by plowing it\nc. The doctor examined my field of vision\nd. What field will you enter after college?\nChildren of professionals are more likely to understand this meaning of field as doctors, journalists and lawyers\nhave \u201cfields\u201d, whereas cashiers and maintenance workers have jobs so their children are less likely to know this\nmeaning of field. (The correct answer is D).\nTesting companies try to minimize these kinds of content problems by having test developers from a variety of\nbackgrounds review items and by examining statistically if certain groups find some items easier or harder.\nHowever, problems do exist and a recent analyses of the verbal SAT tests indicated that whites tend to scores better\non easy items whereas African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans score better on hard items\n(Freedle, 2002). While these differences are not large, they can influence test scores. Researchers think that the\neasy items involving words that are used in every day conversation may have subtly different meanings in different\nsubcultures whereas the hard words (e.g. vehemence, sycophant) are not used in every conversation and so do not\nhave these variations in meaning. Test formast can also influence test performance. Females typically score better\nat essay questions and when the SAT recently added an essay component, the females overall SAT verbal scores\nimproved relative to males (Hoover, 2006).\nAccuracy of predictions\nStandardized tests are used among other criteria to determine who will be admitted to selective colleges. This\npractice is justified by predictive validity evidence\u2014i.e. that scores on the ACT or SAT are used to predict first year\ncollege grades. Recent studies have demonstrated that the predictions for black and Latino students are less\naccurate than for white students and that predictors for female students are less accurate than male students\n(Young, 2004). However, perhaps surprisingly the test scores tend to slightly over predict success in college for\nblack and Latino students, i.e. these students are likely to attain lower freshman grade point averages than\nEducational Psychology 299 A Global Text 12. Standardized and other formal assessments\npredicted by their test scores. In contrast, test scores tend to slightly under predict success in college for female\nstudents, i.e. these students are likely to attain higher freshman grade point averages than predicted by their test\nscores. Researchers are not sure why there are differences in how accurately the SAT and ACT test predict freshman\ngrades.\nStereotype threat\nGroups that are negatively stereotyped in some area, such as women\u2019s performance in mathematics, are in\ndanger of stereotype threat, i.e. concerns that others will view them through the negative or stereotyped lens\n(Aronson & Steele, 2005). Studies have shown that test performance of stereotyped groups (e.g. African Americans,\nLatinos, women) declines when it is emphasized to those taking the test that (a) the test is high stakes, measures\nintelligence or math and (b) they are reminded of their ethnicity, race or gender (e.g. by asking them before the test\nto complete a brief demographic questionnaire). Even if individuals believe they are competent, stereotype threat\ncan reduce working memory capacity because individuals are trying to suppress the negative stereotypes.\nStereotype threat seems particularly strong for those individuals who desire to perform well. Standardized test\nscores of individuals from stereotyped groups may significantly underestimate actual their competence in low-\nstakes testing situations.\nDo teachers teach to the tests?\nThere is evidence that schools and teachers adjust the curriculum so it reflects what is on the tests and also\nprepares students for the format and types of items on the test. Several surveys of elementary school teachers\nindicated that more time was spent on mathematics and reading and less on social studies and sciences in 2004\nthan 1990 (Jerald, 2006). Principals in high minority enrollment schools in four states reported in 2003 they had\nreduced time spent on the arts. Recent research in cognitive science suggests that reading comprehension in a\nsubject (e.g. science or social studies) requires that students understand a lot of vocabulary and background\nknowledge in that subject (Recht & Leslie, 1988). This means that even if students gain good reading skills they will\nfind learning science and social studies difficult if little time has been spent on these subjects.\nTaking a test with an unfamiliar format can be difficult so teachers help students prepare for specific test\nformats and items (e.g. double negatives in multiple choice items; constructed response). Earlier in this chapter a\nmiddle school teacher, Erin, and Principal Dr Mucci described the test preparation emphasis in their schools. There\nis growing concern that the amount of test preparation that is now occurring in schools is excessive and students\nare not being educated but trained to do tests (Popham, 2004).\nDo students and educators cheat?\nIt is difficult to obtain good data on how widespread cheating is but we know that students taking tests cheat and\nothers, including test administrators, help them cheat (Cizek, 2003; Popham 2006). Steps to prevent cheating by\nstudents include protecting the security of tests, making sure students understand the administration procedures,\npreventing students from bringing in their notes or unapproved electronic devices as well as looking at each others\nanswers. Some teachers and principals have been caught using unethical test preparation practices such as giving\nactual test items to students just before the tests, giving students more time than is allowed, answering students\u2019\nquestions about the test items, and actually changing students\u2019 answers (Popham, 2006). Concerns in Texas about\ncheating led to the creation of an independent task force in August 2006 with 15 staff members from the Texas\n300 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nEducation Agency assigned investigate test improprieties. (Jacobson, 2006). While the pressure on schools and\nteachers to have their student perform well is large these practices are clearly unethical and have lead to school\npersonnel being fired from their jobs (Cizek, 2003).\nChapter summary\nStandardized tests are developed by a team of experts and are administered in standard ways. They are used for\na variety of educational purposes including accountability. Most elementary and middle school teachers are likely to\nbe responsible for helping their students attain state content standards and achieve proficiency on criterion-\nreferenced achievement tests. In order for teachers to interpret test scores and communicate that information to\nstudents and parents they have to understand basic information about measures of central tendency and\nvariability, the normal distribution, and several kinds of test scores. Current evidence suggests that standardized\ntests can be biased against certain groups and that many teachers tailor their curriculum and classroom tests to\nmatch the standardized tests. In addition, some educators have been caught cheating.\nKey terms\nAchievement tests Mean\nAptitude tests Median\nAYP (Annual Yearly Progress) Mode\nCriterion referenced tests Norm referenced tests\nDiagnostic tests Range\nFrequency distribution Standard deviation\nGrade equivalent scores Stanine\nHigh stakes tests Z-score\nOn the Internet\n<http://www.cse.ucla.edu/> The National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student\nTesting (CRESST) at UCLA focuses on research and development that improves assessment and accountability\nsystems.

The cases each deal with a realistic teaching problem or dilemma. They are followed by a few questions that\ncan, in principle, be answered in short (half-page) essay format. (This style parallels the style of the PRAXIS II\nexamination taken by many future teachers in the United States.) The content or topic of the cases parallel major\ntopics of the chapters of Educational Psychology\u2014one case per chapter.\nReaders who are planning to take the PRAXIS II test, especially the version called \u201cPrinciples of Learning and\nTeaching\u201d, will know that the test also includes a number of structured, multiple-choice items. We have not\nincluded any examples of multiple-choice test items here, but they are widely available in various published study\nguides for the PRAXIS II. Perhaps the most authoritative is the one published by the administrators of the PRAXIS\nitself, the Educational Testing Service:\nEducational Testing Service. (2004).

She had been there for several\nweeks, helping with activities and occasionally leading specific activities that she had devised\nherself. She liked the students and felt that she had been developing good relationships with them.\nOne morning Ms Wilson, her supervising teacher, had to leave unexpectedly. \u201cSomething\u2019s come\nup, Jane, and the principal needs me to come to a meeting right away. It could be awhile before I\u2019m\nback, so you\u2019ll need to take care of things. But you know the routines now, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nJane was surprised and a bit worried, but also excited by the challenge. She did indeed know the\nroutines, so she smiled cheerfully as Ms Wilson went out the door. \u201cOK, everyone\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll\nstart with language arts. Turn to where we left off yesterday, page 46.\u201d\n\u201cBut Ms Gladstone\u201d, said Paul, \u201cWe actually left off on page 32.\u201d\n\u201cNo, dummy!\u201d chimed in Katherine, \u201cYou were absent yesterday, and the day before we had an\nassembly. Remember?\u201d Suddenly three or four students were discussing where in fact the class had\nleft off in the book, and therefore where Jane ought to begin. Jane was wondering that herself.\n\u201cPage 46!\u201d she said firmly\u2014actually more firmly than she had intended. But the students agreed,\nand the lesson began. The lesson turned out to be a short story about an athlete who trained hard\nas a runner for a local competition. Students took turns reading selections from the story, and in\nthis way got about half way through it. Then Joe raised his hand.\n\u201cMs Gladstone\u201d, he asked. \u201cDo you think athletes should be arrested for taking steroids?\u201d Jane was\ntaken off guard by this. She had been determined to finish the lesson smoothly. All she could think\nto say was, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a hard question.\u201d\n\u201cMy dad says they should be arrested, and that no one should have any doubts about that.\u201d\nIn seconds the language arts lesson was forgotten and students were arguing about whether\nathletes should take drugs. For the moment Jane was on the sidelines.\n\u201cMy uncle took steroids at university\u201d, said Frank, \u201cand it never hurt him.\u201d\n\u201cGross!\u201d called out Jill from across the room. \u201cI suppose you take them too, then?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d asked Frank, obviously annoyed.\n\u201cShe\u2019s saying your too fat, Frank\u201d, said Joe. \u201cThat\u2019s what steroids do, you know.\u201d\nJane was getting worried. How could she get the discussion back on track? Students were just\ngetting more worked up.\n305 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n\u201cI\u2019ve never taken any drugs!\u201d\n\u201cNot real drugs\u2014steroids\u2014you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d\n\u201cI bet you have, though\u2026\u201d\nOn it went, with some students getting annoyed and others clearly tuning out. What if Ms Wilson\ncame back now?\n\u201cBE QUIET!\u201d Jane shouted, surprised at hearing herself be so loud. Everyone got still instantly,\nstunned and surprised. But not for long.\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d someone mimicked softly from the back of the room. A few snickers. Then someone else\nsaid it, with sarcasm dripping from the words. \u201cBe quiet!\u201d Jane glowered at the class, wondering\nwhat to do next.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 What did Jane do wrong?\n\u27a2 (a) How could the students\u2019 inappropriate behaviors be considered examples of operant\nbehaviors being reinforced?\n\u27a2 (b) In what way did Jane\u2019s \u201cclamping down\u201d on the students reinforce Jane?\n\u27a2 Describe briefly a way for Jane and Ms Wilson to prevent behavior problems from\noccurring when and if Jane has to take over the class unexpectedly.\nEducational Psychology 306 A Global Text Appendix A: Preparing for licensure\nPreparing for licensure : Joey\u2019s individual educational plan\nSee also Chapter 5, Students with special educational needs; Chapter 10, Planning instruction.\nThe following are excerpts from two parts of the Individual Educational Plan (IEP) for a fourth-\ngrade student named Joey who has an intellectual disability.

She had taken the general goal directly from the state\u2019s official\ncurriculum guide for health education: \u201cStudents will identify positive communication skills\u201d, it\nsaid. But the guide said nothing about how to translate this goal into practice.\nShe was thinking that she would use puppets to demonstrate how to communicate in positive ways.\nThe puppets would engage in dialogue, during which they would nod their heads appropriately,\nfocus on the speaker, not interrupt, and keep still while listening. Maybe she would include a few\ncommunication mistakes as well\u2014times when a puppet might interrupt in appropriately, for\nexample\u2014and challenge students to identify those moments.\nHer plan seemed fine as far as it went, but she felt unsure about two things. One concern was how\nto make sure that students got the point of the activity, and did not regard it simply as\nentertainment. How should she introduce the activity? What should she say about it, either\nbeforehand, during, or afterwards? What exactly should she tell students she is expecting from\nthem?\nThe other concern was with the very format of the activity. She did not want students just to know\nabout good communication skills; she wanted them to use them as well. The puppets did not seem\nto help with this latter purpose. How, she wondered, could she get students to take responsibility\nfor practicing good communication? Was there a way to modify or extend the puppet activity that\nwould do this? Or perhaps additional activities that students could do?\nThink of the range of instructional strategies available to Rosemary. Then answer each of the\nfollowing questions.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Choose two strategies that would help her with the first of her concerns\u2014with making sure\nthat students understood the purpose of the puppets lesson.

The general goal of the unit, as expressed in the curriculum\nframework document from the State Department of Education, is for students \u201cto understand the\nnature and purposes of houses and how they are affected by the circumstances of their society\u201d. To\nget started in planning the unit, Mr Cullen brainstormed the conceptual web of ideas and topics\nshown below as \u201cDocument 1\u201d below. He also introduced students to making conceptual webs\nabout houses, one of which is shown below as \u201cDocument 2\u201d.

She wants to try some sort of collaborative group work because\nshe has heard good things about it\u2014especially that it gets students talking to each other in ways\nthat are productive rather than mere chit-chat. Ms Fuller is thinking of trying a group project for\nsocial studies that she is calling \u201cHow many people does it take to raise a child?\u201d Students are\nsupposed to explore how people outside the family contribute to the welfare of infants and\nchildren. If they do collaborate successfully, then students can pool their research, share ideas and\ninterpretations, and present their results to class more effectively.\nMs Fuller has read some very specific literature about how to get started with collaborative group\nwork. One book recommends, for example, that she assign the members of each group rather than\nletting students select their own groups; this procedure is supposed to avoid cliques and ensure\nthat everyone is included. But it also means that some group mates may not be each other\u2019s first\nchoice. Ms Fuller considers this trade-off carefully, and finally decides to go ahead and assign the\ngroup members herself. To minimize possible complaints, she also decides to give each group an\nimmediate task: choose a leader as well as a name for the group.\nScene 2: Collaborate groups that don\u2019t collaborate\nTwo weeks into the term, Ms Fuller begins the collaborative project about community helpers. She\ndescribes the purposes and advantages of group work: students can help each other, cover more\nreading material, and enjoy each other\u2019s company. They will also be challenged to explain what\nthey learn to each other and to justify to each other their ideas for the final report and presentation.\nOnce the work begins, she begins noticing a variety of reactions from groups and the individuals\nwithin them. In one group (Ms Fuller dubs it \u201cGroup 1\u201d), for example, Tom complains to her that\nhe is the only boy in the group. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she says to Tom. \u201cIf you look around, you\u2019ll see that\nmost people are with other people they don\u2019t know terribly well.\u201d Tom looks uncomfortable with\nher response, but continues working.\nIn Group 2, Jasmine takes over almost immediately; everyone seems to agree that she should have\nthis job. Unfortunately Jasmine is not pleased to be in charge: she issues orders reluctantly (\u201cKyla,\nyou look up about nurses\u201d), to which her group happily agree.\nEducational Psychology 314 A Global Text Appendix A: Preparing for licensure\nIn Group 3, Ken and Serge confer about the project, but ignore the girls in the group. The girls soon\nare chatting about activities outside school, doodling in their notebooks, and apparently\ndaydreaming.\nIn Group 4, Ms Fuller can hear voices periodically rising in anger. She can\u2019t make out who is saying\nwhat, but it seems to involve Jennifer, Sean, and possibly Lavar. The other two group members are\nsitting quietly, simply observing the argument and presumably waiting for it to be over.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 If you could speak to Ms Fuller right now (at the end of Scene 2), what advice could you\ngive her to assist in continuing the activity? For this question, take the situation as it has in\nfact evolved so far; avoid giving advice, that is like \u201cYou should never have done X in the\nfirst place.\u201d Focus your advice on developing effective strategies of communication, either\nfor Ms Fuller, for the students, or for both.\n\u27a2 Now imagine that you can, miraculously, turn the clock back to the beginning of Scene 1,\nwhen Ms Fuller was planning the collaborative activity in the first place. What advice could\nyou give her at that initial point in time? Again, focus your advice on developing effective\nstrategies of communication, either for Ms Fuller, for the students, or for both.\n\u27a2 Consider how nonverbal communication among the students might be affecting students\u2019\nexperience in particular. Describe a way in which one or more features of nonverbal\ncommunication might cause a collaborate group to fall apart or become unproductive.\nThen suggest ways that Ms Fuller might be able to help so that members of the group\nremained mutually supportive and productive.\n315 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nPreparing for licensure: Ms Scanton teaches second grade\nSee also Chapter 10 Planning instruction; Appendix C: The reflective practitioner.\nWhen Ms Scanton taught second grade, she kept a journal about her experiences. Sometimes she\nsimply recorded interesting facts or information individuals, but other times she commented and\nreflected on individuals at more length. Here are three of her journal entries.\nDocument 1: Ms Scanton\u2019s observation of Ashley\u2019s writing\nOctober 4: Ashley procrastinated a lot again today during journal-writing time\u2014stared at the\nceiling, at the kids near her, etc. etc. I reminded everyone that they were supposed to write about\n\u201cthis week at school,\u201d but it didn\u2019t seem to sink in with Ashley. After sitting a long time, she drew a\npicture of her family\u2014Mom, Dad, cat.\nI know she especially loves her cat, but I also thought she should follow directions more closely. I\nask her, \u201cIs that all you\u2019ve done?\u201d She frowns. I smile\u2014a sincere one.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d she says cautiously\u2014referring to the writing itself.\n\u201cBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to work at it\u2014to actually write,\u201d say I.\nA pause. Then, \u201cHow do you spell \u2018Mom\u2019?\u201d she asks.\nI tell her to sound it out; ask what is the first sound, etc. /m/\u2026/ah/\u2026/m/\u2026 She says these sounds\nslowly, maybe to please me.\n\u201c/m/,\u201d she repeats, and then write down one letter: M. I have to leave to check on others. From a\ndistance I see her write down K, then erase and switch it to C. Was she sounding out \u201ccat\u201d?\nDocument 2: Later that year: Ms Scanton\u2019s log of Ashley\u2019s misspellings\nAshley, November 21: Ashley is still misspelling so many words in her writing that I\u2019m getting\nexasperated, to put it nicely. Here\u2019s a list of her misspellings from the past two weeks\u2014mostly from\nher journal:\ntechrs (teachers)\nmilmen(mailmen)\npeliec (police)\nfier pepel (fire people)\npepl (people)\nlibrein (librarian)\nlectrisudie(electricity)\nEducational Psychology 316 A Global Text Appendix A: Preparing for licensure\ndoctrs (doctors)\nnrsis (nurses)\nloyors (lawyers)\n* What to do for her? *\nDocument #3: Still later: Ms Scanton journal reflections\nApril 21: Just finished a cool book, GNYS AT WRK, by Glenda Bissex, that made me think about\nAshley and her misspellings. The author described her son\u2019s invented spellings and how they\nbecame more plentiful and complicated at first, but eventually became more \u201cadultlike\u201d or\nconventional. Fascinating! The mom was in no hurry to cure her child of his spelling problems, but\nhe seemed to outgrow them on his own. The chief point seemed to be that invented spellings may\nbe good because they show active efforts by the child to figure out the rules of spelling.\nSo maybe Ashley will outgrow her misspellings too? I do note that her misspellings\u2014her inventions\n\u2014have become more complicated across the year. Here\u2019s from her journal last week:\nTDA W WT T JM NAD W PLY TWLIT TAG\nWith a little help from Ashley, I figured this out as \u201cToday we went to gym and we played toilet\ntag.\u201d\nHere\u2019s from the week before:\nTIZ WK W MAD PTY MAX.\nTranslation: \u201cThis week we made party masks.\u201d\nQuite a difference from the start of the year, when she would only write down a couple of letters\nduring journal-writing time! Maybe I need to support her efforts more and worry about them less.\nBut how to do that and still make sure she really is learning how to spell?\nP.S. If you are interested, the book about invented spellings that Ms Scanton mentioned in\nDocument #3 is listed in the bibliography.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 In these excerpts from her journal, Ms Scanton has observed and reflected on Ashley\u2019s\nlearning to spell. Considered her activities as a whole, how much do they qualify as action\nresearch in the sense described in this chapter? What should be added or changed to make\nher activities a full-fledged example of action research?\n\u27a2 Consider the list of misspellings (or invented spellings) in Document #2. Suggest how, if at\nall, Ms Scanton might address those misspellings with Ashley. In particular, comment on\nwhether she should make time to work with Ashley in the same way that she did in\n317 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nDocument #1. Assuming that she does make time, how she might set priorities about\nwhich word(s) to focus on if she does not have time to deal with them all?\n\u27a2 Suppose that Ms Scanton does not have time to review every misspelled word with Ashley.\nHow else could she address Ashley\u2019s spelling problems? Consider briefly how she might\nuse each of the following: (1) peer tutor, (2) classroom computer, (3) homework. Comment\non how Ms Scanton might collect information about each of these strategies.\nEducational Psychology 318 A Global Text This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAppendix B: Deciding for\nyourself about the research\nIn most of this book, educational research is used to establish ideas and advice about teaching. Except in\nChapter 13 (\u201cThe reflective practitioner\u201d), however, we do not analyze research studies in depth. In this appendix\ntherefore we look at examples or cases of research studies in detail. We describe how they were conducted, reflect\non their significance and meaning, and pose a few questions to consider about each study. There is approximately\none case per chapter, and their topics roughly parallel one or more of the major themes of each chapter. The\nreferences for the books cited are listed at the end of each case study, as well as in the bibliographies of the chapter\nrelated to each case. Looking at the research studies in detail gives a different perspective on the research than\nsimply using the results: \u201cup close\u201d the implications of a study are often not as clear as when seen from a distance.\nEducational Psychology 319 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\nDeciding for yourself about the research\nChapter 1, The changing teaching profession and you: effects of high-stakes testing\non learning educational psychology\nAs indicated in this chapter, the trend toward high-stakes testing has affected even the preparation\nof teachers themselves. Many American states now require new teachers to pass a standardized test\nof subject matter knowledge, and many also require them to pass a test about educational\npsychology\u2014the sort of content that is the focus of this textbook (Cochran-Smith, 2003;\nEducational Testing Service [ETS], 2004). These changes highlight make the issues about testing\nvery vivid\u2014and at times anxiety-provoking\u2014for many new teachers.\nRosemary Sutton studied the effects of high-stakes testing on her own teaching of educational\npsychology as well as on her undergraduate students\u2019 responses to studying this subject (Sutton,\n2004). In her state of Ohio, new teachers must all take a test called the \u201cPRAXIS II: Principles of\nLearning and Teaching\u201d (ETS, 2004). She reported experiencing a number of new instructional\ndilemmas as a result of this test being introduced as a requirement for teacher licensing and\ncertification, and she described how she resolved them. The effects of the dilemmas and of her\nsolutions to them were not uniform, but depended on the particular feature of the course.\nOne negative effect was that Professor Sutton felt more pressure to cover as much of the content of\nthe PRAXIS in her course as possible, so that students could be prepared as well as possible for the\ntest. Doing so, however, meant covering more material and therefore reducing depth of coverage of\ncertain topics. This was a serious problem, she feared, because some parts of the course became\nmore shallow or fragmented. She also had less time for open-ended discussions that truly followed\ninterests expressed by the students.\nOn the other hand, Professor Sutton also reported diversifying her teaching methods\u2014for example\nby using more group work and less lecturing\u2014as a way to make class sessions more interesting and\nmotivating, and therefore insuring that students learned the increased material as well as possible.\nShe also began using more assignments that resembled the PRAXIS test itself. In this case\nimitating the PRAXIS meant giving \u201ccase study quizzes\u201d throughout the semester, which were\nfeatured prominently on the PRAXIS. The quizzes consisted of short anecdotes or stories followed\nby open-ended questions which students answered the space of a few sentences or brief paragraph.\nSince the students knew that the quizzes were a type of preparation for licensing, they tolerated\nthem well, and even welcomed them. She and the students felt as if they were \u201con the same side\u201d,\nworking together to help the students pass their exam. The relationship was therefore more\npositive and less \u201cconflicted\u201d compared to earlier times when Professor Sutton was expected not\nonly to teach the students, but also to evaluate them.\n320 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nWith the introduction of the licensing exam, finally, some students seemed to regard educational\npsychology as more important than in the past\u2014even using university break weeks for additional\nstudy of the textbook! On the other hand, some students seemed to worry about their performance\non the test, and their anxiety may have interfered with learning about educational psychology\nitself. Their worries created a dilemma that Professor never truly resolved: how to get students to\nprepare for the test seriously without arousing undue worry or anxiety in them?\nQuestions\n\u27a2 How well do you feel that Professor Sutton\u2019s dilemmas about high-stakes testing reflect the\ndilemmas that public school teachers might face in preparing their own students for high-\nstakes tests?\n\u27a2 On balance, and taking into account Professor Sutton\u2019s experience, do you think that high-\nstakes tests are desirable?\nReferences\nCochran-Smith, M.

Study guide for Principles of Learning and Teaching, 2nd edition.\nPrinceton, NJ: Author.\nEducational Psychology 321 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\nDeciding for yourself about the research\nChapter 2, The learning process: behaviorist and constructivist teaching compared\nNumerous educators have planned and implemented activities and curriculum units that use either\nbehaviorist or constructivist principles in one way or another. Often the demonstrated activities or\nunits are hard to compare directly simply because behaviorism and constructivism address\ndifferent aspects of learning, and therefore call upon teachers to perform somewhat different roles.\nTo see what I mean, look at these two examples of instructional research. The first is grounded in\nbehaviorism and the second is grounded in constructivism.\nBehaviorism in action: a remedy for stuttering Mark Onslow and his colleagues have\ndescribed a way to help young children overcome stuttering, a problem in which sounds and words\nare repeated or stretched unduly, so that fluent conversation is difficult (2001). Onslow\u2019s research\nstrategy was simple, at least in principle: he trained parents of children who stuttered to praise\ntheir child more strongly is the child spoke fluently (without any stutter), and to correct the child\nquietly, but non-punitively whenever the child did stutter. A fluent sentence therefore produced\npraise, or even a gold star, from parents. A stuttered sentence produced an immediate sentence like\n\u201cI think that was a stutter\u201d, stated factually and quietly. Value judgments and criticisms were not\nallowed.\nOnslow\u2019s program contradicted the conventional advice to parents about stuttering, which was to\nignore it wherever possible. Nonetheless the program produced very positive results. All of the\nstuttering children reduced or even eliminated their stuttering after a few weeks of the differential\nreinforcement by their parents, and the stuttering did not return when they were tested even one\nyear after the program finished.\nConstructivism in action: project-based learning Juliette Goldman, an educator working in\nAustralia, demonstrated how this can be done with health education for middle years students\n(Goldman, 2006). She designed a project for seventh-grade students in which they had to publish a\ntraining manual for fellow-students on the topic of \u201cgood food handling\u201d, advice for restaurant\nworkers about how they can keep for contaminating either themselves or the food that they serve.\nThe writers of the manual worked in groups of three, researching information on a range of topics\nrelated to food handling. Then they used computer self-publishing software to prepare and print\ncopies of their information. They also made oral presentations about their manuals to a school\nassembly to which local food-industry representatives were invited, and they arranged to display\nthe finished manuals at the local public library.\nThe initiative used constructivist principles in a number of ways. For example, it challenged\nlearners to make decisions about what their particular manual should \u201cteach\u201d. The decision-\nmaking required learners constantly to monitor their own knowledge and learning\u2014engage in\n322 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nmetacognition\u2014in order to insure that the content was complete, accurate, and important to learn.\nIt also grouped students into teams, so that they could, to some extent, teach each other whatever\nthey needed to learn, including helping each other to sense whether they actually were learning\nfrom their research.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Obviously these two studies are about different educational problems or issues. What if the\nlearning theories underlying them were switched? Could a stuttering program be built\naround constructivist principles of learning, and a health education program be built\naround behaviorist principles? What would each program look like?\n\u27a2 Be a skeptic for a moment. What do you suspect might be the hardest part of\nimplementing behavioral conditioning for stuttering described by Onslow? And what\nmight be hardest part of implementing the constructivist program about health education?\nReferences\nOnslow, M., Menzies, R., & Packman, A. (2001).

That is why medical\nexperts are quite concerned that obesity in children has increased markedly since the 1950s, to the\npoint of being considered a genuine health \u201cepidemic\u201d (Ogden, et al., 2002). Recent projections\nsuggest that fully one-third of all children born in 2000 will eventually develop diabetes as a side-\neffect of being overweight (Narayan, et al., 2003).\nWhy have these changes happened? One factor is probably the vast increase in individuals\u2019\nconsumption of sugar especially \u201cdisguised\u201d forms like corn syrup (Bawa, 2005). Another is a more\nsedentary, \u201cstay-inside\u201d lifestyle than in the past. The latter has happened, among other reasons,\nbecause of population shifts: cities and towns have increased in population and size, while rural\nareas have decreased in population, causing more people to rely on car travel more than ever\nbefore. The changes have also led residents in many areas of many cities to consider their\nneighborhoods less safe than in the past, causing them to respond with inactivity: either they stay\ninside more or they rely even more on cars to get around.\nEven schools have contributed to the trend toward obesity. \u201cJunk food\u201d drinks and snacks are\nwidely available in many schools through commercial vending machines\u2014each one giving a\nstudent an extra 150 and 300 unneeded calories per day. More insidiously, perhaps, is the effect of\nthe trend toward high-stakes testing: because of them, many schools tend to strengthen courses\nand special programs that prepare students in the \u201cbasic\u201d subjects that they know will be tested,\nand to trim programs (like physical education, but also the arts) that will not be tested.\nThese considerations led a group of physicians at the University of Georgia to organize an after-\nschool program of physical activity for elementary school students (Yin, et al., 2005), and to assess\nwhether the program actually helped prevent weight gain in students. Students volunteered for a\nprogram that had three components: 30 minutes of physical activity, a healthy snack, and\nassistance with the students\u2019 homework. (The researchers explain that assistance with homework\nhad nothing to do with weight loss, but was very important in getting students to attend and\ngetting parents to support the program!) Staff for the program included a mix of regular teachers\nfrom the school (not necessarily physical education specialists) and other individuals hired\nspecifically for the project. Physical activities were chosen in part by the students, and were\ngenerally non-competitive and cooperative in nature.\nInitial results of the program have been very encouraging; students and parents support the\nprogram strongly, and teachers have been successful in making sure that students are actually\n324 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nactive enough during the program sessions. Since the program is still ongoing, however, it will be a\nfew more years before there will be definitive results about weight gain, or lack thereof.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 It is hard to disagree with the purposes of this study\u2014reducing the prevalence of obesity.\nBut does it really show what it claims? Be a deliberate skeptic for a moment and ask\nyourself these questions:\n\u27a2 If the students were volunteers, how typical do you think they are of all students?\n\u27a2 And if the teachers are receiving a large research grant to implement the program, might\nthey be working harder to do a good job than most of us ordinarily work?\n\u27a2 An important ambiguity about the program was the fact that it included both physical\nactivity and homework assistance. Think about this ambiguity.\n\u27a2 If the researchers split up these two elements\u2014offering only one or the other at any one\nschool\u2014how might the split affect the outcomes?\n\u27a2 Would different sorts of students volunteer as a result of the split, and how if at all would\ntheir selection matter?\nReferences\nOgden, C., Flega, K., Carroll, M. & Johnson, C.

A dialect is a version of a language with somewhat unique vocabulary,\ngrammar, and pronunciation. The most prominent dialect of English in North America is African-\nAmerican English, sometimes also called Ebonics. Intellectually and emotionally, Ebonics is just as\nrich and capable of expressiveness as \u201cStandard English,\u201d the dialect usually used, for example, by\nradio and television news broadcasters. It is used by many African Americans in the United States,\nthough not by all and often not in every possible situation.\nBut Ebonics has distinctive features not shared with Standard English. In grammar, for example,\nthe verb to be is used differently than in Standard English. Instead of simply indicating existence or\nnon-existence, to be can also distinguish between a one-time event and an ongoing, continuous\nstate. Consider these two sentences and their meanings:\n(1) He tired. (\u201cHe is tired right now.)\n(2) He be tired. (\u201cHe is often or always tired.\u201d)\nEbonics also has features of language use or communication, just like a \u201cforeign\u201d language, which\nare different from Standard English. One is the use of repetitive, rhythmic phrases for emphasis\u2014\nnot unlike the style of an enthusiastic \u201cpreacher\u201d in church. Another is the use of call-and-\nresponse, in which an individual asks a question or makes a statement to which the group expects\nto respond in unison.\nWhat is interesting and important about the features of language use is that teachers can use them\nto communicate more effectively with students, often even if they themselves have not personally\nlearned to speak African-American dialect. Anita Bohn (2003) illustrated this principle by carefully\nobserving the teaching styles of two teachers who regularly incorporated the dialect into\nconversations with students and who used these conversations as a bridge for students to learn\nStandard English.\nIn one observation, for example, the class was beginning a writing activity and the teacher said,\n\u201cThis morning we are going to practice some sentences, and when we do that I want you to listen.\nCan you say that?\u201d The class responded in chorus, \u201cListen!\u201d The teacher said, \u201cDo what?\u201d The class\nreplied even louder, \u201cListen!\u201d The teacher repeated the work a few times together with the\nstudents: \u201cListen\u2026listen\u2026\u201d Then she began clapping in between words: \u201cListen\u2026 [clap]\u2026listen\u2026\n[clap]\u2026listen\u2026 [clap]\u2026\u201d Suddenly she stopped, leaned forward and asked the class, \u201cHow you\ngonna listen? With your feet?\u201d All responded loudly: \u201cNooo!\u201d After a pause, she asked again, \u201cYou\n326 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ngonna listen with your nose?\u201d All responded again: \u201cNooo!\u201d She asked, \u201cHow?\u201d Everyone\nresponded loudly together, \u201cWith our ears!\u201d\nThe teacher\u2019s approach used both repetitive, rhythmic language and a call-and-response style with\nwhich, as it happened, many of her students were already familiar. By using these features of\nAfrican-American communication, she gained students\u2019 attention effectively, but also used the\nstyle of communication to support an activity embedded in Standard English, writing sentences. In\naddition to being a familiar style of interaction, however, the technique worked for another reason:\nit implied respect for the language and communication skills that students had acquired already.\nSuch respect has been shown to be important for success not only when students are learning two\ndialects, but also when they are learning two languages, such as Spanish and English (Marinez-\nRoldan & Malave, 2004).\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Most teachers agree that part of teachers\u2019 goals should be to encourage students in\nlearning Standard English, both spoken and written. But an issue that we may disagree\nabout, and that is raised by Bohn\u2019s study, is whether teachers should do so by using non-\nstandard dialect in class. You could think about it this way: by \u201cspeaking Ebonics\u201d, is a\nteacher modeling inappropriate English or is he/she providing students with a bridge from\nEbonics to standard English? What do you think about this?\n\u27a2 There is also a related question that is more practical. Is using non-standard dialect really\npractical for every teacher? Presumably using it is easier for those with prior experience\nspeaking the dialect, than for those without experience. But could other teachers learn it\nwell enough to be effective with students? If not, then how else, if at all, could such\nteachers communicate with students effectively?\nReferences\nBohn, A. (2003).

Yet progress at including such students has generally been\nmore rapid and complete in elementary schools\u2014especially at the youngest grade levels\u2014than in\nsecondary schools. The reasons for the difference do not necessarily have to do high school\nteachers\u2019 attitudes about disabilities as compared to elementary teachers\u2019 attitudes. Much of it\nstems from differences in how the two levels of schooling are structured, with secondary schools\nbeing much larger and organized by a complex timetable of classes that tends to sort students\u2014and\neven teachers themselves!\u2014by academic background (Kelly, 2004; Oakes, 2005). One effect of this\norganization is to make it harder for special education and general education teachers to\ncollaborate, and therefore to integrate learning experiences for students with disabilities into high\nschool as a whole.\nYet some teachers and schools manage to collaborate anyway. A research study by Joseph\nStowitschek and his colleagues explored the factors that account for comparative success at\nincluding students with disabilities in secondary school (Stowitschek, Lovitt, & Rodriguez, 2001).\nThe researchers were interested, first, in how much teachers actually do collaborate to design and\ncarry out programs for youth with disabilities, and second, in what specific circumstances or\npractices were associated with collaborating successfully. They chose three contrasting high\nschools to study in detail: a large urban public high school, a rural public high school in a small\ntown, and a private urban high school. For each school they collected information from a wide\nrange of staff\u2014special education teachers, general education teachers, administrators, parents, and\nstudents with disabilities themselves. The information came from surveys, interviews, reviews of\nofficial school documents, and observations of classrooms.\nWhat did they find? Among other things, they found that special education teachers at all of the\nschools strongly supported inclusion of students with disabilities to the fullest possible extent; they\ndid not, that is, seek to strengthen or increase the schools\u2019 reliance on segregated special education\nclasses. They also found significant interest and support from parents of the students with\ndisabilities in the educational programs of their children. These factors suggested that change\ntoward fuller inclusion may continue in the years ahead.\nBut they also found limitations on how much the teachers could collaborate at any of the schools. A\nmajor problem was the teachers\u2019 dependency on informal communication with general education\n328 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nteachers. Instead of regularly announced meetings to discuss inclusion initiatives, teachers had to\n\u201ccatch\u201d each other in the hallway or during lunch hours, for example, in order to have\nconversations about students and ways of including them in class or school activities. At these\nmoments the teachers tended already to be busy. A partial result was that the general education\nteachers ended up with limited knowledge both about the special education program at their\nschool, and about why particular students might be placed successfully in their particular\nclassrooms. All of the students with disabilities had IEPs, but the general teachers had little or no\nknowledge of their contents\u2014or even of their existence. Not surprisingly, under these conditions\nthere were few major collaborative activities, such as the co-teaching of a course by a special\neducation teacher and a general teacher or jointly operated activities or programs.\nYet for each school there were also individual teachers and activities that boosted collaboration in\nthe school, and that could in principle be tried elsewhere as well. The private high school, for\nexample, had an especially effective, vital program for involving parents: there were regular\nadvisory group meetings to assess the current needs of the special education program and to\ndevelop and sustain support for it among the parents. Another especially effective collaboration\ninvolved peer tutoring\u2014using high school students to tutor the students with disabilities on a\nregular basis, often with course credit given as \u201cpayment\u201d to the tutors. Peer tutoring proved a\ngood way to communicate the nature and extent of the special education program to the student\npopulation as a whole. A third effective form of collaboration involved using a teacher as a\n\u201ccommunity coordinator\u201d, someone who developed linkages to agencies and potential employers in\nthe community. The linkages proved especially helpful in students\u2019 transitions to work and life\nafter high school.\nAll in all, there were limitations on inclusion in the secondary schools, but also grounds for\noptimism because of the collaborative successes and the dedication of the teachers. Although\nStowitschek and his colleagues focused on only three schools, their findings suggested three key\npoints: (1) that the motivation for inclusion and collaboration definitely exists among secondary\nteachers, (2) that it is possible to work around the organizational constraints of high schools, and\n(3) that changes in those constraints in the future should further increase levels of inclusion and\ncollaboration.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 If you were a teacher in a high school (as many readers of this book plan to become), how\nwould you prepare your students to receive a student with a disability into one of your\nclasses? Consider actions that you would take both before and after the student actually\narrives.\nEducational Psychology 329 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\n\u27a2 Sometimes teachers at every grade level express concern about receiving students with\ndisabilities into their classes, even if it can be arranged easily. Why do you think that the\nteachers feel this way? Think of three possible objections to inclusion, and then think of\nhow an advocate for inclusion might respond to each of them.\nReferences\nPublic Law 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (July 26, 1990).

Research has found that these experiences\nare effective in a wide variety of situations, such as making decisions about careers, performing\ntasks at work, choosing courses at school, deciding whether to join after-school sports teams, and\nplanning effective instruction as a teacher (Allison, Dwyer, & Makin, 1999; Bandura, 1997;\nGoddard, Hoy, & Hoy, 2004). Because it has proved valid in so many situations, self-efficacy\nseems relatively universal cognitive process\u2014as if it \u201cworks\u201d everywhere, for everyone.\nBut does it? The very fact that self-efficacy is based on experience should make us suspicious of its\nlimits, since there are few experiences that are literally shared by all people in all places or\nsocieties. And the wide diversity among students in most schools should lead to similar skepticism.\nMaybe it is true that self-efficacy promotes motivation for many students, or even for most, but\ndoes it do so for all students? And if it does not, then what are the reasons?\nThese questions prompted a psychologist named Lori Lindley to investigate whether self-efficacy\nhas in fact proved useful and valid for understanding motivation in unusually diverse populations\n(Lindley, 2006). She searched the research literature for studies about self-efficacy in each of the\nfollowing groups:\n(a) women with careers\n(b) ethnic minorities living in the United States\n(c) societies and cultures outside the United States\n(d) self-identified gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals\n(e) people with disabilities\nWhat has research shown about the self-efficacy of members of these groups? Compared to the\n\u201cclassic\u201d research about this concept, is self-efficacy higher, lower, confined to just limited areas of\nactivity, or not even a meaningful idea?\nWhat Lindley found was that self-efficacy beliefs were (like the people she studied) complex and\nvaried. Women, for example, were just as likely to express high self-efficacy and low motivation\nabout using computers, as to express low self-efficacy and high motivation to use them. Among\nethnic minority students (Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and African Americans), some studies\nfound lower self-efficacy about choosing careers than among white students. But other studies\nfound no differences.\nEducational Psychology 331 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\nAmong societies outside the United States, however, high self-efficacy seemed to predict\nmotivation, much as it does in the \u201cclassic\u201d research with white American populations\u2014though\nagain with some differences. Among Italian high school students, for example, self-efficacy beliefs\nabout career choice are strongly associated with the students\u2019 interest in and choice of career (Lent,\net al., 2003). Yet the connection between self-efficacy and motivation was found to have a different\ncharacter for students from Taiwan (Mau, 2000): for them high self-efficacy was associated not\nwith being highly motivated, but with relying heavily on others to assist with making decisions and\nwith being highly rational or logical in making them. Self-efficacy, under these conditions, was not\nso much a belief in yourself as a belief in your community.\nAmong the remaining groups\u2014the gay/lesbian/bisexual individuals and the people with\ndisabilities\u2014research was especially scarce and conclusions were therefore hard to reach. The\npublications that did exist emphasized a belief in the potential value of self-efficacy for these\ngroups, but they did not report research studies describing whether in fact self-efficacy in fact\nmotivated the individuals, or even existed consistently and meaningfully as a concept or belief.\nWhat does the diversity of these findings suggest (beyond Grandmother\u2019s rule that \u201csometimes one\nthing happens, and sometimes another\u201d)? Lindley noted two points, both of which were hinted at\nby some of the studies that she reviewed. The first point is that self-efficacy may be a belief about\npersonal capacity only for some individuals in some situations. For others, efficacy may really be a\nbelief in the group or community, such as your family, classroom, or workplace. Self-efficacy may\nreally be collective self-efficacy\u2014a belief that your group can accomplish its goals. Believing\nprimarily in the group may be quite motivating, but also be quite a different experience from\nbelieving primarily in yourself. In recent years some psychologists and educators have\nacknowledged this possibility and begun studying the dynamics of collective self-efficacy (Bandura,\n1997; Gordon, Hoy, & Hoy, 2004).\nLindley\u2019s second point is that for some groups, the main barriers to success are not beliefs in\npersonal capacity, but real, external obstacles independent of personal beliefs. Imagine, for\nexample, that a person encounters daily, real social prejudice because he or she is non-white,\nhomosexual, or has a disability. For that person, self-confidence may only go part of the way to\ninsuring success, and removing the real social barriers may be needed to go the rest of the way.\nFor teachers, three implications of this research seem clear. First, individual self-efficacy beliefs do\noften motivate students, and teachers should therefore encourage them in these students. Second,\nsome students may see their personal capacity in terms of the capacity of groups to which they\nbelong. Teachers can motivate these students by strengthening the capacity of their groups\u2014\nperhaps using strategies like the ones described in this chapter and the next. Third, some students\nrightly perceive genuine injustices in their world which limit their chances of success; teachers\nshould not deny the importance of these injustices, but recognize them and do what they can to\nreduce them.\n332 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Think about your own belief in your capacity to teach well, as well as your doubts and\nworries about your capacity. You might call this your teaching self-efficacy. What is\nthat belief primarily based on, and what would it take to raise that belief even higher?\n\u27a2 Suppose your students consisted of about equal numbers who believed in individual self-\nefficacy and in collective self-efficacy. Imagine and describe one advantage of having such\na mix in your class, as well as one potential source of conflict that you might have to deal\nwith between the two groups.\nReferences\nAllison, K., Dwyer, J., & Makin, S.

A lot of research suggests, on the contrary, that success in classroom\nmanagement needs to be adjusted to the cultural background and expectations of students.\nEducators sometimes call this approach culturally responsive classroom management.\nSupport for culturally responsive management comes a number of research studies. In one study,\nfor example, David Brown interviewed 13 teachers who taught in classrooms from 1st through 12th\ngrade in urban, inner-city schools in several different cities (Brown, 2004). A few of the teachers\nwere themselves culturally diverse\u2014one was from Sri Lanka, one was African American, two were\nHispanic American\u2014but most were white. Although the interviews were lengthy and detailed, they\ncentered on just three underlying questions:\n(1) How do you interact with students?\n(2) How would you describe your management style?\n(3) What works well for you in communicating with students?\nThe teachers\u2019 views could be summarized in several points. First, the teachers considered it\nimportant to show students that the teachers cared and respected them: this attitude was\nsignificantly more important, they felt, when teaching urban students than when teaching\nsuburban students. The teachers therefore made more effort than usual to be friendly with all\nstudents and to get to know them as individuals. To do so, though, the teachers also had to know\nhow the students themselves preferred to be publicly known or acknowledged. In some classrooms\nwith Hispanic American students, for example, the teachers found it wise not to call on individuals\nduring class, because some of the students preferred to be recognized for their relationships with\nclassmates\u2014for their membership in the class as a group\u2014rather than for their distinctiveness\nfrom the group.\nInterestingly, \u201ccaring\u201d involved more than simple warmth and nurturance. It also meant teachers\u2019\nasserting their authority to make clear demands on students both for high quality work and for\nappropriate classroom behavior. Asserting authority indirectly in order to sound polite (like saying\n\u201cWould you like to sit down now?\u201d) was less effective and was often interpreted by students as a\nsign of a teacher\u2019s indifference. Direct, specific commands (like \u201cTake your seat\u201d) were more\neffective, provided they did not also express hostility.\n334 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nThe teachers\u2019 caring had to be consistent in every way: not only did they have to say friendly things\nto students, but also they had to look friendly with eye contact and smiles. What made such\nconsistency initially challenging for some teachers was recognizing students\u2019 own signs of\nfriendliness for what they were. In some classrooms with African American students, for example,\nstudents engaged in a \u201ccall response\u201d pattern of interaction: as the teacher gave instructions or\nexplained an idea, some students would say or speak their own feelings or mention their own ideas.\nThe pattern was not meant to interrupt the teacher, however, so much as to show involvement in\nthe lesson or activity, and the teacher needed to acknowledge it as such.\nOther educational researchers besides David Brown have found similar results, though some point\nout that actually practicing culturally responsive management can be harder than simply knowing\nwhat it involves (Weinstein, Tomlinson-Clarke, & Curran, 2004). To become skillful with the\nstrategies described by Brown and others, for example, teachers also need to look honestly at their\nown preconceptions about ethnic, cultural and racial differences, so that they do not misconstrue\nculturally ambiguous behaviors of students just because students have a background different from\nthe teacher\u2019s own. Teachers also need to be aware of how much society-wide prejudice on students\u2019\nsense of efficacy, since pervasive prejudice and discrimination can stimulate some students to\nwithdraw in ways that may be mistaken for laziness.\nPerhaps the most challenging aspect of culturally responsive management, however, is for teachers\nto accommodate to students\u2019 cultural differences while also helping them learn how to function\nwell in the somewhat bureaucratic, middle-class oriented \u201cculture\u201d of school. This challenge is full\nof dilemmas. How much, for example, should a teacher sacrifice conventional \u201cpoliteness\u201d\nbehaviors (like using indirect questions) simply because students understand and respect\ndirectness more easily? How much should a teacher encourage students to critique each other\u2019s or\nthe teacher\u2019s ideas even if students\u2019 families give higher priority to cooperation and compliance\nwith authorities? And what if a particular class is itself culturally diverse, containing students from\nmany cultural backgrounds in one room? What should a teacher do then?\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Think about the issue of politeness versus directness mention in the final paragraph above.\nPresumably teachers and students need some sort of mutual accommodation about this\nissue. If you were the teacher, what would the accommodation look like? Obviously it\nmight depend on the particular students and on the precise the behavior at hand. But go\nbeyond this generality. Imagine\u2014and describe\u2014what you might actually say to students to\nshow respect for their preferred styles of talking while still encouraging them to respect or\neven adopt styles of speech that lead to more success in school?\nEducational Psychology 335 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\n\u27a2 Culturally responsive classroom management has sometimes been criticized on the\ngrounds that it encourages teachers to \u201cprofile\u201d or stereotype students according to their\nethnic, racial, or cultural backgrounds. Being culturally responsive, it is said, makes\nteachers overlook the individual differences among students. Others argue that treating\nstudents strictly as individuals makes teachers overlook students\u2019 obvious cultural\nheritages. How might you resolve this issue in your own mind? Again, go beyond the\nobvious: imagine an actual conversation that you might have with your own students about\nthis issue.\nReferences\nBrown, D. (2004).

In explaining why an assignment is late, for example, a student might claim to have been\nsick when the student was not in fact sick. Worse yet, a student might turn in an assignment that\nthe student claims to have written when in fact it was \u201cborrowed\u201d from another student or\n(especially among older students) even from Internet.\nIn situations like these, is there any way to discern when a person actually is lying? Many of the\nsigns would have to be nonverbal, since by definition a liar\u2019s verbal statements may not indicate\nthat falsehood is occurring. A large body of research has studied this question\u2014looking for\nnonverbal signs by which deception might be detected. The research can be summarized like this:\npeople generally believe that they can tell when someone is lying, but they can not in fact do so very\naccurately. In a survey of 75 countries around the world, for example, individuals from every\nnation expressed the belief that liars avoid eye contact (Global Deception Research Team, 2006).\n(This is an unusually strong trend compared to most in educational and psychological research!)\nIndividuals also named additional behaviors: liars shift on the feet, for example, they touch and\nscratch themselves nervously, and their speech is hesitant or flawed. But the most important belief\nis about eye contact: a liar, it is thought, cannot \u201clook you in the eye\u201d.\nUnfortunately these beliefs seem to be simply stereotypes that have little basis in fact. Experiments\nin which one person deliberately lies to another person find little relationship between averting eye\ncontact and lying, as well as little relationship between other nonverbal behaviors and lying\n(DePaulo et al., 2003). A person who is lying is just as likely to look directly at you as someone\ntelling the truth\u2014and on the other hand, also just as likely to look away. In fact gaze aversion can\nindicate a number of things, depending on the context. In another study of eye contact, for\nexample, Anjanie McCarthy and her colleagues observed eye contact when one person asks another\nperson a question. They found that when answering a question to which a person already knew the\nanswer (like \u201cWhat is your birthday?\u201d), the person was likely to look the questioner directly in the\neye (McCarthy, et al., 2006). When answering a question which required some thought, however,\nthe person tended to avert direct gaze. The researchers studied individuals from three societies and\nfound differences in where the individuals look in order to avoid eye contact: people from Canada\nand Trinidad looked up, but people from Japan looked down. All of their answers, remember, were\ntruthful and none were lies.\nIf gaze aversion does not really indicate lying, then why do people believe that it does anyway? The\nresearch team that studied this belief suggested that the belief does not actually reflect our\nexperiences with liars, but instead function as a deterrent to lying behavior (Global Deception\nEducational Psychology 337 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\nResearch Team, 2006). Since nearly everyone disapproves of lying, and since detecting it is often\ndifficult, the next best strategy is to persuade potential liars that they might in fact be detected.\nFurthermore, if we believe that liars should feel ashamed of their behavior, it is reasonable to\nsuppose that they would show signs of shame\u2014i.e. gaze aversion, shifting on their feet, hesitation,\nand the like. The irony is that if we begin to doubt a person\u2019s truthfulness, a truthful person is more\nlikely to feel uncomfortable, so the person is likely to begin averting gaze and showing other signs\nof nervousness anyway. The end result is to reinforce the stereotype of gaze aversion, but not to\nidentify an actual liar.\nFor teachers, the implications of this research are twofold. First, it suggests that we should be very\ncareful before deciding whether or not a particular student is lying on a particular occasion. We\nshould encourage students to be equally careful with each other; it is too easy, it seems, to jump to\nconclusions about this sort of judgment. Second, it implies that a better way to reduce lying by\nstudents is to develop high-quality relationships with them, so that students will not feel a need to\nlie. Obviously, developing high-quality relationships is a big job and it may be easier with some\nstudents than with others. But it appears to be more effective than falsely accusing truthful\nstudents while overlooking actual deceptions.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Classrooms are like any other social setting in that they can only function well if their\nmembers\u2019 are truthful with each other. How could you communicate this message to\nstudents so that they endorse it themselves? One way, of course, is to discuss the problem\nwith students. But another way might be to stage \u201csimulated lying\u201d between students, and\nhave students see how well they can discern true liars. Would a simulation be a good idea,\nor would it be undesirable by giving students practice at lying effectively? Explain your\nviews about this question.\n\u27a2 Recall the study above in which thought-questions caused individuals to avert direct gaze.\nWhy do you suppose that people from Trinidad and Canada averted gaze by looking up,\nwhile people from Japan averted by looking down? What sort of cultural significance does\nthis difference have, if any? In answering this question, think as well about how you could\nfind out if the answer is valid.\nReferences\nGlobal Deception Research Team. (2006). A world of lies.

Instead a more\nguarded comment may be more accurate: there seem to be strategies that are especially good for\ncertain students under certain conditions. Educational psychologists have long studied this idea\nand call it aptitude-treatment interaction (abbreviated ATI) (Cronbach & Snow, 1977; Snow,\n1989). The aptitude in this term is the unique quality, talent, or skill of a student; the treatment is\nthe instructional strategy or approach being used; and the interaction is the combination of the\ntwo.\nThe idea seems intuitively appealing, but it has proved surprisingly difficult to identify particular\nATIs scientifically. Part of the problem is the ambiguity of the term aptitude. Numerous qualities,\ntalents, and skills of students have been identified and studied, including memory for verbal\nmaterial, memory for visual material, memory for sequences of ideas, ability to analyze a problem\ninto its parts, and creativity .\nThe situation is just as ambiguous in defining treatment. Is it a specific teacher-directed strategy\nsuch as the use of advance organizers described in this chapter? Or does treatment mean a broad\napproach such as Madeline Hunter\u2019s effective teaching model that we describe in this chapter, or\nlike student-centered inquiry learning that we also describe? Since both key terms have multiple\npossible meanings, it is not surprising that research studies of their combinations have also yielded\nambiguous results. Sometimes a particular combination of aptitude and treatment help learning,\nbut other times it makes little difference.\nIn spite of these problems with the research as a whole, the specific studies of ATIs have clearly\nbeen helpful to teachers. In one, for example, the researchers investigated human ecology students\u2019\npreferred styles of learning\u2014their aptitudes (Crutsinger, Knight, & Kinley, 2005). Did they prefer,\nfor example, to learn from visual information (pictures, diagrams) or from verbal information (text\nand oral explanations)? Did they prefer to scan new information in sequence, or to skip around in\nit and piece it together at the end? The researchers found that this particular group of students\ntended to prefer new information to be visual and sequential. As a result, they were able to improve\nstudents\u2019 learning by adding to the course more computer-based instruction, which was relatively\nvisual and sequential in its organization.\nIn another study, the researcher who initially was studying cooperative learning groups in\nuniversity students discovered\u2014and wondered why\u2014some of the groups were more productive\nthan others (Peterson, 2004). On closer investigation of the groups he found an ATI-related\nproblem. Students in this particular university course were choosing their own group partners.\n340 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nThey therefore tended to choose their own friends, a practice that inadvertently reduced the talents\nand resources available in some groups. Friends, it seemed, tended to duplicate each other\u2019s styles\nof problem solving and of performing academic tasks, rendering the group as a whole less rich in\ntalents and therefore less productive or successful.\nTo remedy this problem, the instructor undertook to identify students\u2019 strong points in different\naspects of problem solving. He identified which students were inclined to take action, which were\ngood at decision-making, which at identifying problems, and which at brainstorming. Then he\nassigned students to groups so that each group had one person strong in each of these areas. The\nresults were a striking increase in the productivity of all groups. But there was a catch: although the\nstudents were indeed more productive, they did not like being assigned partners as well as\nchoosing their own! Maintaining this particular ATI may therefore prove difficult over the long\nterm\u2014perhaps another reason by ATI research has not always found consistent results.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Think about the fact that results of ATI have been inconsistent, even though it seems\nreasonable given the obvious diversity among students in every classroom. Assuming that\nyou support the idea of ATIs, explain how you would justify it to two kinds of people: (1) a\nfellow teacher in your school, and (2) a professor of educational psychology.\n\u27a2 Given the results of Peterson\u2019s research study, what is the best advice you could give to\nteachers (or to yourself) about how to set up cooperative learning groups? Should students\nchoose their own partners, or should the teacher choose them? Keep in mind the proviso\nmentioned at the end\u2014that the students preferred to choose their own partners, even\nthough it meant learning less.\nReferences\nCronbach, L. & Snow, R. (1977).

Students read stories,\nwatch videos, and talk about respected citizens\u2014doctors, political leaders, celebrities, and the like\n\u2014who happen to be African-American, Hispanic, or of some other non-Caucasian origin. In some\ncases, especially at the early childhood level, students\u2019 interests and concerns are used to guide the\nselection and integration of diversity-related activities (Derman-Sparks, 1994).\nOne way of thinking about such a curriculum is that it tries to make students into \u201cexperts,\u201d even at\nrelatively young ages, about racial and ethnic differences. Instead of thinking about diversity in\nsuperficial terms\u2014as based merely on skin color, for example\u2014students learn to see diversity as\ncomplex and multi-faceted. An African-American child and a White child do not simply differ in\ncolor, for example; they are both similar and different in many ways. Hopefully the greater subtlety\nof their expert knowledge also reduces negative biases felt about race.\nTo test these possibilities, Donna Perkins and Carolyn Mebert interviewed 79 children at six\npreschool and after-school child care centers (2005). Some of the centers emphasized multicultural\neducation, some emphasized multicultural education as well as an emergent curriculum, and some\nemphasized neither. Perkins and Mebert assessed children\u2019s knowledge and attitudes about race in\nseveral ways. For example, they displayed pictures of other children over various races on a felt\nboard, and asked the participating children to arrange the pictures so that children were closer\ntogether if more similar and farther apart if more different. They also asked participating children\nto evaluate simple stories or anecdotes about three pictures, one of a white child, one of an African-\nAmerican child, and one of an Asian-American child. In one of the anecdotes, for example, the\nresearcher asked, \u201cSome children are naughty because they draw with crayons on the walls. Which\nof these children (in the pictures) might do that?\u201d The participating child could then choose any or\nall of the pictured children\u2014or choose none at all.\nWhat did Perkins and Mebert find from this study? Four ideas stood out especially clearly:\n(1) Children indeed showed more \u201cexpertise\u201d about race if they attended a child care center that\nemphasized multicultural education\u2014but only if they center also emphasized emergent\ncurriculum. To be effective, in other words, information about human diversity had to grow out of\nchildren\u2019s personal concerns and interests. It was not enough simply to tell them about human\ndiversity.\n342 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\n(2) Although a multicultural/emergent program was effective in sensitizing children to\ndifferences between races, it was not especially effective for sensitizing them to differences within\nraces. When it came to differences among African-Americans, for example, the\nmulticultural/emergent children were no more subtle or \u201cexpert\u201d in their judgments than any other\nchildren.\n(3) Children in the multicultural programs tended to view all children, regardless of race, in a\nrelatively more positive light, and this tendency increased as they got older (i.e. from age 4 to 6).\n(4) Most important of all, the program orientation did affect the children\u2019s knowledge and\nattitudes, even at (or perhaps because of) their young age.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Why do you suppose that multicultural education worked only in conjunction with an\nemergent curriculum? Imagine that you writing a brief summary of this study for a school\nnewsletter, and that you need to comment on this question. What would you say about it?\n\u27a2 Skeptics might say that the study assessed only what children say about race, not how\nchildren might act in racially related situations. In an interview, in other words, a child\nmight express positive sentiments about every race or ethnic group, but still behave in\nprejudiced ways during play or other activities at school. Is this a legitimate criticism of the\nPerkins and Mebert study? How could you devise another study to test whether there is\ntruth to the criticism?\nReferences\nPerkins, D. & Mebert, C. (2005).

Identifying\nproblems in student work and pointing out areas for improvement can undermine students\u2019\nconfidence and motivation. However, students cannot make significant improvements in their\nwork if they do not get accurate information about their strengths and weaknesses. Cohen, Steele\nand Ross (2002) argue that trust is crucial to this dilemma: students are more likely to respond\nwell to accurate feedback if they trust the teacher and believe that the feedback is not biased.\nHowever, if the student distrusts the teacher feedback that points out weaknesses is likely to lower\nmotivation and confidence.\nThe dilemma of providing trust and accurate feedback that enhances motivation is particularly\nacute when the students come from a group that has been stereotyped as less competent (e.g.\nAfrican American, Latino) and the teacher is white. Several studies suggest that feedback that is\n\u201cwise\u201d can help establish trust and foster motivation even though the feedback includes\ninformation about weaknesses. In one study, 45 African American and 48 White College students\nwere asked by a White experimenter to write a letter of commendation for their favorite teacher\n(Cohen Steele, Ross, 1999). The students were told that the best letters would be published in a\njournal and that the skills needed were similar to those needed to write an effective college paper. A\nphoto of each student was attached to their draft letter. A week later the students returned for the\nsecond session of the study and were given one of three types of feedback:\n(1) Unbuffered criticism: Spelling and grammatical errors were marked as well as some\nshortcomings in the writing (e.g. stylistic concerns). Also two check marks acknowledging good\npoints were included.\n(2) Criticism and positive buffer: In addition to the criticism described for the unbuffered group,\nstudents were told that they did a good job and made a number of good points.\n(3) Wise feedback: Criticism, positive buffer, and assurance. In addition to the criticism and\npositive buffer described above, students were also told that the person critiquing the letter\nbelieved that the student could meet the high standards needed for publication.\nThe researchers assessed how biased the students believed the reviewer was, how motivated\nstudents were to revise the letter, and how much students identified with writing skills. All\nstudents were less motivated and identified less with writing if they received unbuffered criticism.\nHowever, for White students the distinction between criticism with positive buffer vs the wise\nfeedback was not as important as it was for African American students. The group of African\nAmerican students who received wise feedback was more motivated, identified more with writing,\n344 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nand was significantly less likely to believe the reviewer was biased than the groups that received the\nother forms of criticism.\nThis study suggests that the kind of feedback given is important: unbuffered criticism is\nassociated with lower motivation for all students. However, for African American students who\ngrow up amidst negative stereotypes about their competence, feedback that promotes motivation,\nneeds to include three components: some positive comments, criticism that identifies specific\nweaknesses, and comments that make it clear the teacher believes the student can do well.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 This study was conducted using College students\u2014do you think the findings would also\napply to elementary, middle, and high school students?\n\u27a2 This study focused on African American students. Do you think the findings might also\napply to Latino and Native American students who are also often stereotyped as less\ncompetent?\n\u27a2 How important is trust in classroom interactions?\n\u27a2 Have you received the kinds of feedback described here?

Corporate leaders who had orchestrated company turnarounds stressed the\nimportance of setting explicit goals, performance or outputs, use of benchmarks or standards, and\norganizational restructuring. Policy makers needed support from the business leaders for the\nadditional financial resources needed for widespread education reforms they wished so it is not\nsurprising they adopted these business ideas as they devised ways to make teachers and students\nmore accountable.\nAccording to Susan Fuhrman (2004) a \u201ctheory of action\u201d underlies these new accountability\nsystems that contains the following assumptions:\n(a) Schools\u2019 primary focus should be student achievement in the key areas of math, reading and\nscience. Clear content standards developed by each State for each subject area and grade level help\nschools in this focus. If rewards and sanctions are based on the basis of students\u2019 meeting the\ncontent standards in that school then the teachers and administrators will devote energy and\nresources to improving student achievement.\n(b) Standardized tests that are aligned with the content standards can accurately and\nauthentically measure student performance. Well designed tests are reliable and valid and so other\nmeasures such as classroom observations are not needed to determine if teachers and schools are\ndoing a good job.\n(c) Meaningful consequences will not only motivate teachers, students, and administrators but\nalso improve instruction. Positive consequences include bonuses for teachers and administrators\nand negative consequences include denial of graduation or promotion for students, or school take\nover and restructuring. Because these consequences are real, teachers will work harder to teach\nand be more likely to additional professional development to improve their skills. Students will\nalso work harder to learn so teacher-student interactions around content will improve. Frequent\nassessment will provide meaningful feedback on student performance which in turn will promote\nimproved teaching.\n(d) There will be minimal unintended consequences if the systems work as intended. For\nexample, instruction will improve rather then becoming narrowly focused on test taking skills, and\nhigh school graduation tests will promote learning not increase drop out rates.\n346 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nQuestions\nOur questions focus on part of each assumption.\n\u27a2 How much emphasis should schools place on reading, mathematics and science? What\nrole should art, physical education, social studies, and music play in school classrooms?\n\u27a2 Do standardized tests measure students\u2019 performance on content standards adequately?\nShould schools be judged on students\u2019 scores on standardized tests? Is it important that\nclassroom observations of students (by teachers or others) are not included.\n\u27a2 Will students and teachers be motivated by the tests. Stiggins (2004) argued that while\nhigh achieving students may be motivated by tests many students who find the tests\ndifficult will give up and so be less motivated. Do you agree with Stiggins or the\nassumption underlying NCLB?\n\u27a2 Are the unintended consequences minimal? Is classroom instruction improving or\nbecoming narrowly focused on test taking skills and content?\nReferences\nFuhrman, S. H. (2004). Introduction, In S. H. Fuhrman & R. F. Elmore (Eds).

A teacher may be\nconstantly surrounded by students, but chances are that no colleague will be there to witness what\nthe teacher does in class. Conversation about classroom experiences do happen, but they tend to\nhappen outside of class time\u2014perhaps over lunch, or before or after school. This circumstance does\nnot prevent teachers\u2019 from sharing experiences or concerns related to teaching altogether, but\ndelaying conversations probably makes them less frequent or likely. Fewer collegial conversations,\nin turn, can limit teachers by reducing their opportunities to learn from each other\u2014or even to\nrealize many of the instructional options open to them.\nAction research addresses teachers\u2019 isolation because it promotes not only reflection on practice,\nbut also collaboration and sharing (Hayes, 2006). The benefits of sharing may be the most obvious\nwhen an action research project is actually published for a wider audience. Over the past 20 years,\nnumerous teachers and other educators have published studies of their own teaching or their own\nstudents\u2019 learning. There are now entire books compiling such accounts (for example, Samaras &\nFreese, 2006; Tidwell & Fitzgerald, 2006), a comprehensive handbook discussing aspects of\nteachers\u2019 studies of their own teaching (Loughran, et al., 2004), several journals whose purpose is\nlargely or solely to publish examples of action research (one, for example, is called simply Action\nResearch), and a variety of blogs and websites that post action research projects. Collectively these\npublications are a rich source of practical wisdom from which individual teachers can learn and\nthink about their own teaching.\nBut an action research project does not have to published formally in order to promote\ncollaboration or sharing. The benefits can happen locally\u2014even within a single school building\u2014\nwhenever a teacher plans, carries out, and talks about a research initiative. A teacher named Betty\nRagland, for example, described how this happened in her highly unusual teaching situation, a\njuvenile correctional facility (Ragland, 2006). The facility functioned somewhat like a prison for\nyouth convicted of various crimes. As you might suppose, Ms Ragland\u2019s students experienced\nbehavior problems and conflicts more often than usual in schools, to the extent that teachers\nsometimes felt physically vulnerable themselves, as well as isolated from help if serious conflicts\ndeveloped during class. To deal with these stresses, Ms Ragland initiated a self-study of her\npractice in which she wrote and thought about her experiences and her reactions to the\nexperiences. She shared the results, both in writing and through meetings, with fellow teachers. In\nthe course of doing so, she developed a number of insights which colleagues found helpful in\nformulating their own thinking:\n348 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nAs Ms Ragland reflected on her work as a teacher, she realized that teaching in a correctional\nfacility had made her more cautious about her safety even outside of teaching hours. For example,\nshe had become more careful about locking her car door, where she walked at night, and even\nwhere she sat in restaurants (she preferred to sit with her back to the wall).\nMs Ragland found it impossible to describe her work in a fully detached or objective way, and\nfinally decided that being detached was not even desirable. Her feelings and interpretations of\nstudents\u2019 behavior were essential to understanding experiences with them, so she decided that it\nwas better to include these in whatever she wrote about them.\nAs she wrote, talked, and reflected on her experiences, she found herself governed by two\nincompatible perspectives about her work, which she called the educational perspective (try to\nhelp students and turn their lives around) and the correctional perspective (remember that the\nstudents had committed serious crimes and often could not be trusted).\nMore importantly, she discovered, through conversations with fellow staff, that they too felt torn\nbetween these same two perspectives.\nBy talking with each other about the dilemmas in how to interpret students\u2019 needs and\n(mis)behaviors, she and the other staff were able to develop a common perspective about their\npurposes, about appropriate ways of helping students, and about appropriate ways of dealing with\nconflicts when they arose.\nIn the end, a study initiated by one teacher, Ms Ragland, benefited all the teachers. What began as\na self-study eventually became a group study, and teachers\u2019 mutual isolation at work decreased.\nNot many teachers, of course, find themselves teaching in a correctional facility. But many\u2014\nperhaps most\u2014do experience serious dilemmas and stresses either about students\u2019 behavior or\nabout their learning. Depending on circumstances, for example, a teacher may wonder how to\nrespond to students who treat the teacher or other students disrespectfully. Or a teacher may feel\nlost about helping certain students who are struggling or wonder where the teacher\u2019s responsibility\nends if a student persists in not learning even after receiving special help. Such uncertainties may\nnot lead to physical threats, as actually happened to Betty Ragland occasionally, but they can create\na lot of stress nonetheless. But action research can help\u2014systematically studying and reflecting on\nhow to solve them, reading and listening to how others have done the same, and sharing what\nteachers therefore learn. Because of these activities, questions about teaching can be resolved, or at\nleast clarified, and classroom practice can be enhanced. Most important, the benefits can be shared\nnot only with the teacher as researcher, but with a teacher\u2019s colleagues as well.\nQuestions\n\u27a2 Consider the three ways discussed in this chapter that research articles can differ: (1) by\nhow much they seek universal truths, (2) by the response the author expects from the\nEducational Psychology 349 A Global Text Appendix B: Deciding for yourself about the research\nreader, and (3) by the assumptions the author makes about the reader\u2019s prior experiences.\nWhere is Ms Ragland\u2019s action research situated on each of these dimensions of difference?\n\u27a2 Consider the ethical issues about action research discussed at the end of this chapter\u2014\ninsuring privacy of students, gaining informed consent, and insuring freedom to\nparticipate. Given the nature and focus of Ms Ragland\u2019s particular action research, how\nmight she honor these ethical considerations? Does the fact that her students were\n(literally) captives make any difference?\n\u27a2 Suppose that instead of an inside staff member like Ms Ragland studying youthful offenders,\nan outsider unfamiliar with youth correctional facilities wanted to do so. How would outsider\nstatus affect what could be learned about life in a juvenile correctional facility?\nReferences\nLortie, D. (1975). Schoolteacher.

The problem, as we have pointed out more than once, is that classroom events are often ambiguous and\nambivalent, in that they usually serve more than one purpose. A teacher compliments a student\u2019s contribution to a\ndiscussion: at that moment she may be motivating the student, but also focusing classmates\u2019 thinking on key ideas.\nHer comment functions simultaneously as behavioral reinforcement, information, and expression of caring. At that\nmoment complimenting the student may be exactly the right thing to do. Or not: perhaps the praise causes the\nteacher to neglect the contributions of others, or focuses attention on factors that students cannot control, like their\nability instead of their effort. In teaching, it seems, everything cuts more than one way, signifies more than one\nthing. The complications can make it difficult to prepare for teaching in advance, though they also make teaching\nitself interesting and challenging.\nThe complications also mean that teachers need to learn from their own teaching by reflecting (or thinking\nabout the significance of) their experiences. In the classrooms, students are not the only people who need to learn.\nSo do teachers, though what teachers need to learn is less about curriculum and more about students\u2019 behavior and\nmotivation, about how to assess their learning well, and about how to shape the class into a mutually supportive\ncommunity.\nThinking about these matters helps to make a teacher a reflective practitioner (Sch\u00f6n, 1983), a professional who\nlearns both from experience and about experience. Becoming thoughtful helps you in all the areas discussed in this\ntext: it helps in understanding better how students\u2019 learning occurs, what motivates students, how you might\ndifferentiate your instruction more fully, and how you can make assessments of learning more valid and fair.\nLearning to reflect on practice is so important, in fact, that we have referred to and illustrated its value\nthroughout this book. In addition we devote this entire chapter to how you, like other professional teachers, can\ndevelop habits of reflective practice in yourself. In most of this chapter we describe what reflective practice feels like\nas an experience, and offer examples of places, people, and activities that can support your own reflection on\npractice. We finish by discussing how teachers can also learn simply by observing and reflecting on their own\nteaching systematically, and by sharing the results with other teachers and professionals. We call this activity\nteacher research or action research. As you will see, reflective practice not only contributes to teachers\u2019 ability to\nmake wise decisions, but also allows them to serve as effective, principled advocates on behalf of students.\nEducational Psychology 351 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nTypes of resources for professional development and learning\nAt some level reflection on practice is something you must do for yourself, since only you have had your\nparticular teaching experiences, and only you can choose how to interpret and make use of them. But this rather\nindividual activity also benefits from the stimulus and challenge offered by fellow professionals. Others\u2019 ideas may\ndiffer from your own, and they can therefore help in working out your own thoughts and in alerting you to ideas\nthat you may otherwise take for granted. These benefits of reflection can happen in any number of ways, but most\nfall into one of four general categories:\n\u2022 talking and collaborating with colleagues\n\u2022 participating in professional associations\n\u2022 attending professional development workshops and conferences\n\u2022 reading professional literature\nIn the next sections we explore what each of these activities has to offer.\nColleagues as a resource\nPerhaps the simplest way to stimulate reflections about your own teaching is to engage fellow teachers or other\ncolleagues in dialogue (or thoughtful conversation) about teaching and learning: What do you think of this kind of\nexperience? Have you ever had one like it yourself, and what did you make of it? Note that to be helpful in\nstimulating reflection, these conversations need to be largely about educational matters, not about personal ones\n(\u201cWhat movie did you see last night?\u201d). Dialogues with individual colleagues have certain advantages to more\ncomplex or formal professional experiences. Talking with an individual generally allows more participation for both\nof you, since only two people may need to express their views. It also can provide a measure of safety or\nconfidentiality if your conversation partner is a trusted colleague; sometimes, therefore, you can share ideas of\nwhich you are not sure, or that may be controversial.\nA somewhat more complex way of stimulating reflection is group study. Several teachers at a school gather\nregularly to bring themselves up to date on a new curriculum, for example, or to plan activities or policies related to\na school-wide theme (e.g. \u201cthe environment\u201d). Group meetings often result in considerable dialog among the\nmembers about the best ways to teach and to manage classrooms, as well as stories about students\u2019 behavior and\nlearning experiences. For a beginning teacher, group study can be a particularly good way to learn from\nexperienced, veteran teachers.\nSharing of ideas becomes even more intense if teachers collaborate with each other about their work on an\nextended basis. Collaboration can take many forms; in one form it might be \u201cteam teaching\u201d by two or more\nteachers working with one group of students, and in another form it might be two or more teachers consulting\nregularly to coordinate the content of their courses. Collaborations work best when each member of the team brings\nresponsibilities and expertise that are unique, but also related to the other members\u2019 responsibilities. Imagine, for\nexample, a collaboration between Sharon, who is a middle-years classroom teacher, and Pat, who is a resource\nteacher\u2014one whose job is to assist classroom teachers in working with students with educational disabilities or\nspecial needs. If Pat spends time in Sharon\u2019s classroom, then not only will the students benefit, but they both may\nlearn from each other\u2019s presence. Potentially, Pat can learn the details of the middle-years curriculum and learn\n352 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nmore about the full range of students\u2019 skills\u2014not just those of students having difficulties. Sharon can get ideas\nabout how to help individuals who, in a classroom context, seem especially difficult to help. Achieving these\nbenefits, of course, comes at a cost: the two teachers may need to take time not only for the students, but also to talk\nwith each other. Sometimes the time-cost can be reduced somewhat if their school administrators can arrange for a\nbit of extra planning and sharing time. But even if this does not happen, the benefits of collaboration will be very\nreal, and often make the investment of time worthwhile.\nProfessional associations and professional development activities\nAnother way to stimulate reflection about teaching is by joining and participating in professional associations\u2014\norganizations focused on supporting the work of teachers and on upholding high standards of teaching practice.\nTable 45 lists several major professional associations related to education and their Internet addresses. Most of\nthem are composed of local branches or chapters serving the needs of a particular city, state, or region.\nTable 45: A selection of professional associations related to education\n\u2022 American Association for the Mentally Retarded (AAMR) [www.aamr.org]\n\u2022 Association for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, & Dance (AAHPERD) [www.aahperd.org]\n\u2022 Association for Experiential Education (AEE) [www.princeton.edu/~rcurtis/aee.html]\n\u2022 Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC) [www.thearc.org/welcome.html]\n\u2022 ENC Online Resources for Math and Science Education [www.enc.org/stan.htm]\n\u2022 National Association for Bilingual Education (NABE) [www.nabe.org/]\n\u2022 National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) [www.naeyc.org/]\n\u2022 National Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) [[www.nctm.org/]\n\u2022 National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) [www.socialstudies.org/]\n\u2022 National Council for Teachers of English (NCTE) [www.ncte.org]\n\u2022 National Science Teachers Association [www.nsta.org/]\n\u2022 Organization of American Historians (OAH) [www.oah.org]\nTo achieve their purposes, a professional association provides a mixture of publications, meetings, and\nconferences intended for the professional development of educators, including classroom teachers. Typically the\npublications include either a relatively frequent newsletter or a less frequent journal focused on issues of practice or\nresearch. Very large associations often publish more than one newsletter or journal, each of which is focused on a\nparticular topic or type of news (for example, the National Education Association in the United States publishes\neight separate periodicals). Some also publish online journals (there are several listed as part of Table 46 or online\nEducational Psychology 353 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nversions of print journals. Whatever format they take, professionally sponsored publications stimulate thinking by\ndiscussing issues and dilemmas faced by professional educators, and sometimes also by presenting recent\neducational research and the recommendations for teaching that flow from that research. We discuss ways of using\nthese publications further in the next section of this chapter.\nTable 46: A sampling of journals related to professional education\n\u2022 Annotated Bibliography of Education Journals - annotations of over 426 education related journals\nand extensive links to educational organizations and institutions that sponsor them.\n\u2022 CSS Journal - Computers in the Social Studies - dedicated to the encouragement of the use of\ncomputers and related technology in K-12 social studies classrooms.\n\u2022 Education Policy and Analysis - published by the College of Education at Arizona State University\n\u2022 Educational Theory - publishes work in the philosophy of education and other disciplines.\n\u2022 Effective Teaching - electronic journal devoted to the exchange of ideas and information relevant to\ncollege and university teaching in North Carolina.\n\u2022 Harvard Educational Review - quarterly journal that provides an inter-disciplinary forum for\ninnovative thinking and research in education.\n\u2022 Interact - European platform for interactive learning and new media.\n\u2022 Journal of Computing in Higher Education - publishes articles that contribute to our understanding of\nthe issues, problems, and research associated with instructional technology\n\u2022 New jour - electronic journal and newsletter archive.\n\u2022 Revista Iberoamericana de Educacion - Revista de la OEI.\n\u2022 Scholarly Electronic Journals - Trends and Attitudes: A Research Proposal\n\u2022 WORLDSPEAKER online - an international academic journal written by and for international\nscholars, university administrators, and researchers.\nMeetings and conferences sponsored by a professional association also take a variety of forms. Depending on the\nsize of the association and on the importance of the topic, a meeting could be as short as a one half-day workshop or\nas long as a full week with many sessions occurring simultaneously. Sometimes, too, an association might sponsor a\nmore extended course\u2014a series of meetings focused on one topic or problem of concern to teachers, such as\nclassroom management or curriculum planning. In some cases, the course might carry university credit, though not\nalways.\nAs you might expect, the size of a professional association makes a difference in kinds of professional\ndevelopment experiences it can provide. In general, the smaller the association, the more exclusively it focuses on\nlocal news and educational needs, both in its publications and in its meetings or other activities. At a professional\ndevelopment workshop sponsored by a local teachers\u2019 association, for example, you are relatively likely to see\ncolleagues and acquaintances not only from your own school, but from other neighboring schools. Locally\n354 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nsponsored events are also more likely to focus on local issues, such as implementing a new system for assessing\nstudents\u2019 learning within the local schools. In general, too, local events tend to cost less to attend, in both time and\nmoney.\nBy the same token, the larger the association, the more its professional development opportunities are likely to\nfocus on large-scale trends in education, such as the impact of the No Child Left Behind legislation we discussed in\nChapter 1 or the latest trends in using computer technology for teaching. Conferences or other professional\ndevelopment events are more likely to span several days and to be located outside the immediate town or region\nwhether you live and work. You may therefore see fewer of your everyday colleagues and acquaintances, but you\nmay also have a greater incentive to make new acquaintances whose interests or concerns are similar to your own.\nThe event is more likely to feature educators who are well-known nationally or internationally, and to call attention\nto educational trends or issues that are new or unfamiliar.\nWhether large or small, the activities of professional associations can stimulate thinking and reflecting about\nteaching. By meeting and talking with others at a meeting of an association, teachers learn new ideas for teaching,\nbecome aware of emerging trends and issues about education, and confront assumptions that they may have made\nabout their own practices with students. Professional meetings, conferences, and workshops can provide these\nbenefits because they draw on the expertise and experience of a wide range of professionals\u2014usually wider than is\npossible within a single school building. But compared simply to talking with your immediate colleagues, they have\na distinct disadvantage: they take effort and a bit of money to attend, and sometimes they are available at\nconvenient times. Well-balanced professional development should therefore also include activities that are\navailable frequently, but that also draw on a wide range of expertise. Fortunately, an activity with these features is\noften easily at hand: the reading of professional publications about educational research and practice.\nReading and understanding professional articles\nAlthough publications about educational issues and research can take many forms, they tend to serve three\nmajor purposes in some sort of combination. A publication could either (1) provide a framework for understanding\nteaching and learning, (2) offer advice about how to teach, or (3) advocate particular ideas or practices about\neducation. Benefiting from a professional publication depends partly on understanding which of these purposes a\nparticular article or book is emphasizing.\nThree purposes of educational publications\nConsider the first purpose, to provide a framework for understanding teaching and learning (Hittleman and\nSimon, 2005). A \"framework\" in this context means a perspective or general viewpoint for understanding specific\nevents and actions. They are much like the theories described earlier in this book, though not always as formal or\nbroad. A published article might propose, for example, a way of understanding why certain students are\ndisrespectful in spite of teachers\u2019 efforts to prevent such behavior (perhaps they are reinforced by peers for being\ndisrespectful). It might offer evidence supporting this perspective. In doing so, the author provides a sort of \u201ctheory\nof disrespectful behavior\u201d, though he or she may not call it a theory explicitly.\nA second purpose is to offer advice about appropriate teaching practices. An article intended for this purpose,\nfor example, might suggest how to introduce reading instruction to first graders, or how to use fiction to teach high\nschool history, or how to organize a class to include a student with a disability. Often giving such advice overlaps\nEducational Psychology 355 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nwith the first purpose, providing a framework for understanding, since thinking about an educational issue in a\nparticular way may imply certain ways of dealing with it in practice.\nA third purpose of a published article is to advocate ideas and persuade others to take actions benefiting\nstudents and society. It might take a position about important issues in education: Is it a good idea or not to retain\n(or hold back) a student in grade level for another year if the student fails the curriculum the first time? Should\nschools teach about sexuality? Should girls learn science in classrooms separate from boys? In advocating for ideas\nor policies about such matters, the article may express concern about what is good, ethical or desirable in\neducation, not just about what is factually true or practical. The author may seek explicitly to persuade readers of\nthe author\u2019s point of view. These features do not mean, however, that you need to give up thinking for yourself. On\nthe contrary, when reading an advocacy-oriented article, reflection may be especially important.\nWhatever its purpose\u2014understanding, advice, or advocacy\u2014an article or book about a professional issue can\nstimulate thinking about what you know and believe about teaching and learning. It should therefore create, rather\nthan undermine, your individuality as a teacher. Think of professional reading as a dialogue or conversation about\neducation: some of the comments in the conversation will probably be more helpful than others, but each\nparticipant contributes somehow, even if none can give a final answer or everlasting truth. It is the same with\npublications; some may be more helpful than others, but none will be so perfect that you can afford to cease further\nreading or further thinking. If you are about to begin a teaching career, for example, you may be especially\ninterested in anything published about classroom management, but less interested in the problems of\nadministering schools or in the political issues that usually accompany educational systems. Yet some publications\nmay discuss these latter issues anyway, and eventually you may find yourself more concerned about them than at\nthe start of a career. Your job, as a reflective teacher, will be sort out the currently useful articles (or parts of\narticles) from ones you cannot use immediately.\nTo experience educational publications in this way, however, you must think of the authors as your collaborators\nas well as general authorities. As a reader, you need to assume that you are entitled to consider an author\u2019s ideas,\nbut not obligated to accept it without journals related to professional education question. There are several\nstrategies for developing this attitude, but to keep the discussion focused, we will look at just two. We have already\ndiscussed the first strategy, which is to understand the purposes of any particular piece of research which you\nencounter, in order to assess its current usefulness to your daily work and your long-term professional goals. We\nhave already indicated several general purposes of educational research publications, but we will go into more\ndetail about this in the next section. The second strategy for relating to authors as collaborators is to think about\nhow you yourself might contribute to professional knowledge by engaging in research of your own, even as a\nclassroom teacher\u2014an activity often called action research (Mills, 2006; Stringer, 2007). At the end of this chapter\nwe discuss what action research involves, and how you might consider using it.\nAuthors\u2019 assumptions about readers\nAuthors of professional articles and books also make assumptions about their readers, and it helps to be aware of\nthese while you read. The assumptions affect the style, content, and significance of the author\u2019s ideas in ways that\nare both obvious and subtle.\n356 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nOne assumption is about the response which an author expects from you, the reader: does he or she expect you\nactually to do something new, or simply to consider doing something new? Or does the author just want you to be\naware of a new idea? Consider, for example, an article reviewing best practices about inclusion of students with\nspecial needs. The author may imply, or even urge you to take a moral position: you should include these students,\nthe author may seem to say. But in a different article\u2014one recommending particular teaching practices\u2014the author\nmay merely ask you to think about alternatives to your normal ways of teaching. Certain strategies worked under\ncertain teaching conditions, the author says, so simply consider whether they might work for you as well.\nA second, less obvious difference among professional publications is in their un-stated assumptions about prior\nexperiences and attitudes of readers. This assumption may be either helpful or frustrating, depending on you actual\nprior background. A piece intended as a \u201cframework for understanding\u201d may assume, for example, that you are\nfamiliar with basic theories of learning already. If you have read and understood what we outlined in Chapter 2 of\nthis book, the article may turn out to be relatively accessible or understandable to you even if you have relatively\nlittle experience in actual classroom teaching, and even if you have never studied learning theories in detail. The\narticle might seem more accessible than you expect because, for example, it focuses primarily on how teacher's\npraise affects students' learning, an idea with which you may be somewhat familiar already.\nOn the other hand, a professional publication may assume that you have taught school for a number of years\nalready, or that you are at least familiar with classroom life from the point of view not of students, but of a teacher.\nAn author writing about \"withitness\" (discussed in Chapter 7), for example, may make this assumption, since the\nconcept originated by observing teachers managing large group classroom activities. If you yourself are experienced\nat actual teaching, reading about withitness may trigger a lot of questions about just how withit teachers are able to\nbe in practice, and about whether in fact they always need to be withit. You can also ask yourself these questions\neven if you have not yet been a teacher yourself, of course, but they may seem less immediate or urgent.\nA professional article intended to advocate for a particular educational policy or practice may make very\ndifferent assumptions about you as a reader. It may assume, for example, that you do in fact enjoy persuading\nothers of your point of view, even when others initially disagree or react indifferently. This sort of assumption may\nshow up as much in what the writing omits, as in what it includes: if the term cooperative learning activity is used\nwithout explanation, for example, the researcher may be assuming not only that you are the sort of person\u2014\nperhaps a teacher\u2014who knows what that term means already, but also that you already believe in the value of\ncooperative learning and are motivated to explain its value to others.\nIn making these distinctions among published articles, keep in mind a point we made at the outset: that an\nindividual article usually serves more than one purpose at a time and makes more than one assumption about your\nprior knowledge and about how you are supposed to respond to the article. The differences are only about\nemphasis. To illustrate these ideas about the purposes and effects of research, look in the next section at three\nexamples of actual published articles relevant to education. The studies are not a full cross-section of educational\nresearch or publications, but they do suggest some of the variety possible (and necessary) among them. Each\nexample serves a mixture of purposes, but also emphasizes one purpose in particular (perspective-taking, teaching\nrecommendations, or advocacy) described earlier. The authors of each example also make particular assumptions\nabout you, the reader\u2014about the intellectual work which the authors expect you to do and about the motivations\nEducational Psychology 357 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nwhich they assume you have or hope that you will acquire. For each example, we describe the reactions of one of us\n(Kelvin Seifert) as he read the article.\nExample #1: How do children acquire moral commitments?\nIn 1997, Herbert Saltzstein and several colleagues published a research-oriented article about how\nchildren acquire moral beliefs (Saltzstein, et al., 1997). The group of researchers were all graduate students\nand professors of psychology, working mostly at the City University of New York. When Kelvin read of their\naffiliation with psychology, he suspected that they would talk about moral beliefs in general, and not\nnecessarily about moral issues in classrooms, such as cheating or treating classmates with care and respect.\nStill, the article interested Kelvin as a former teacher and current university professor, because he had long\nbeen concerned with fostering qualities like integrity, honesty, cooperation, and loyalty in students. If Kelvin\ncould find out about the mechanism or process by which children acquire mature moral beliefs, he reasoned,\nmaybe he could modify his teaching to take advantage of that knowledge.\nSo Kelvin began reading the article. He discovered some parts were challenging and required careful reflection,\nwhereas others were easier to read. One of the most challenging passages came almost immediately, in the second\nand third paragraphs; these paragraphs, it seemed, required a bit of prior knowledge about theories of moral\ndevelopment. But Kelvin was willing to concentrate more fully on these paragraphs, because he expected that they\nmight clarify the rest of the study. Here are the paragraphs, and some of Kelvin\u2019s thoughts as he read them:\nInitial problem: We began by re-examining the This was one of the difficult paragraphs, perhaps\nphenomenon of heteronomy, Piaget's assertion especially because Kelvin had never read the specific book\n(1932/1965) following Kant (1785/1959) that young by Piaget or by the philosopher Kant. But Kelvin did recall\nchildren equate moral obligation with deference to reading, at various times over the years, about Piaget's\nauthority when justifying their moral judgments. The views on moral development. Piaget believed that at first,\nconcept is important because it is central to the children define morality in terms of what adults think: an\norganismic account of moral development as a series of action is \"good\" if and only if adults (e.g. parents)\ndifferentiations and integrations.... [p. 37] consider it good, and \"bad\" if and only if adults consider it\nbad. This is the idea of \"heteronomy\" to which Saltzstein\nis referring. Children, in this view, take quite awhile to\ndevelop or \"grow\" into truly autonomous moral beliefs.\nAutonomous beliefs form slowly out of earlier beliefs, in\nthe way that a young plant or animal might grow. This is\nthe \"organismic account of moral development\" that\nSaltzstein is talking about.\n...This account has been challenged by Turiel's Here was an idea that was intriguing! Saltzstein and\ndomain theory (Turiel, 1983). According to Turiel and his colleagues were pointing to research (by the person\nhis colleagues, even young children intuitively cited, named Turiel) that suggests that even\ndistinguish moral from conventional rules. [p. 37] preschoolers know the difference between truly moral\n358 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nrules and merely conventional rules. Apparently they\nbelieve, for example, that it would be wrong to steal toys\nor to hit someone, even if adults gave you permission to\ndo so. But apparently they also know that it would be\nOK for traffic lights to use different colors\u2014for red to\nmean \"go\" and green to mean \"stop\"\u2014provided that\neveryone agreed on changing the rule. That is what the\nresearcher named Turiel apparently meant by\ndistinguishing convention from morality.\nThe introduction continued in this challenging style for about two pages, requiring Kelvin to read slowly and\ncarefully in order to understand its points. Kelvin was not discouraged from continuing, though, because he wanted\nto find out more about how, in general, children acquire moral beliefs. Did moral beliefs take time to develop\u2014did\nthey \"grow\" on children slowly after initially being borrowed from parents or other adults? In this case, then maybe\nKelvin owed it to his students to adopt and express desirable moral attitudes myself, so as to provide a good model\nfor their developing beliefs. Or were students\u2019 key moral beliefs already in place when they entered school\u2014almost\nas if \"hard wired\" in their minds, or at least already learned during infancy and the preschool years? In this second\ncase, it might still be desirable for Kelvin to adopt positive moral attitudes, but not for the purpose of modeling\nthem for students. Students already \u201chard wired\u201d for key moral beliefs might not need a model so much as an\nenforcer of desirable moral behaviors. Concerning the issue of cheating, for example, the students might already\nunderstand the undesirable nature and implications of this behavior. As a result they might not need\ndemonstrations of honest integrity from their teacher as much as affirmations from the teacher of the importance\nof honesty and integrity, along with consistent enforcement of appropriate sanctions against cheating when it did\noccur.\nFor Kelvin, therefore, the outcomes of research on moral development\u2014including Saltzstein's that he was\ncurrently reading\u2014posed issues of classroom management, both in university classrooms and in public school\nclassrooms. So Kelvin read on. Saltzstein proposed resolving the issues about the origins of moral development by\ndistinguishing between moral conflicts and moral dilemmas:\nMoral conflicts are conflicts between moral duty or The distinction between conflicts and dilemmas\nright and a non-moral desire. An example might be the looked promising to Kelvin. Moral conflicts looked\nconflict between whether to return a wallet to its fairly simple in cognitive terms, even if they were\nrightful owner or keep the coveted wallet with its extra sometimes difficult emotionally. The \"right\" action was\ncash. In contrast, moral dilemmas are conflicts obvious. Moral dilemmas were more complex\ninvolving two moral rights or duties. For example, [a cognitively as well as emotionally, because two \"goods\"\nperson might feel a dilemma between] whether to steal were being weighed against each other. The moral\na drug to save a spouse's life. [p. 38] alternatives might both be right and wrong at the same\ntime, and their relative \"rightness\" might not be\nimmediately obvious.\nEducational Psychology 359 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nSaltzstein and his colleagues proposed that when young children show awareness of moral rules, they may be\ndoing so in the simpler context of moral conflicts. A young child might believe that you should return a dollar to its\nowner, even if the child has trouble in practice overcoming a selfish impulse to keep the dollar. The same child\nmight have trouble deciding, however, whether it is \"right\" to inform his teacher if a best friend has cheated on a\ntest. In that case two moral principles compete for attention\u2014honesty and loyalty to a friend. To sort out the\nimplications of choosing between these principles, a young child might need to rely on older, wiser minds, such as\nparents or other adults. The minute that he or she does so, the child is showing the moral heteronomy that Piaget\nused to write about and that Saltzstein referred to early in the article.\nUnderstanding these ideas took effort, but once Kelvin began figuring them out, the rest of the article was easier\nto follow. In reading the remaining pages, he noted in passing that the researchers used several techniques common\nin educational research. For example, they interviewed participants, a common way of gathering systematic\ninformation about individuals' thinking. They also imposed controls on their procedures and on the selection of\nparticipants. Procedures were controlled, for example, by posing the same three moral dilemmas and to all\nparticipants, so that individuals' responses could be compared meaningfully. The selection of participants was\ncontrolled by selecting two age groups for deliberate comparison with each other\u2014one that was seven years old and\nthe other that was eleven. Since the researchers wanted to generalize about moral development as much as possible,\nbut they obviously could not interview every child in the world, they sampled participants: they selected a\nmanageable number (sixty-five, to be exact) from the larger student population of one particular school. In a second\npart of the investigation, they also selected a comparable number of children of the same two ages (7 and 11) from\nthe city of Recife, located in Brazil. The Brazilian group's responses were compared deliberately with the American\ngroup's responses, in order to allow for the impact of cultural beliefs on moral development in general. Kelvin\nrecognized this research strategy as an example of using control groups. In research terms, the Brazilian group\n\"controlled for\" the impact of American culture on children's moral beliefs, and vice versa, the American group\ncontrolled for the impact of Brazilian culture on children's moral beliefs. Altogether, these techniques helped insure\nthat the interviews of children's moral beliefs really illustrated what they were supposed to illustrate\u2014that they\nwere reliable and valid, in the senses that we discussed in earlier chapters. As Kelvin noticed Saltzstein's attention\nto good research techniques, he gained confidence in Saltzstein\u2019s observations and in the interpretations that the\nauthors made from them.\nWhat did Saltzstein and his colleagues find out\u2014or more to the point, what did Kelvin Seifert learn from what\nSaltzstein and his colleagues wrote about? There were three ideas that occurred to Kelvin. One was that in everyday\nlife, children probably deal with moral beliefs of all levels of cognitive complexity, and not just \"simple\" moral\nconflicts and \"complex\" moral dilemmas. Saltzstein found that children's solutions to moral dilemmas depended a\nlot on the content of the dilemma. Children advocated strongly for truthfulness in some situations (for example, in\ndeciding whether to tell the teacher about a friend's cheating), but not in other situations (like in deciding whether\nto back up a friend who is being teased and who has lied in an effort to stop the teasing). But it was rare for all\nchildren to support any one moral principle completely; they usually supported a mix.\nAnother idea that Kelvin learned from Saltzstein's research was about how children expressed moral\nheteronomy versus moral autonomy. Age, it seemed, did not affect the beliefs that children stated; younger and\nolder children took similar positions on all dilemmas initially. But age did affect how steadfastly children held to\n360 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ninitial beliefs. Younger children were more easily influenced to switch opinions when an adult \"cross-examined\"\nwith probing questions; older children were more likely to keep to their initial position. Moral heteronomy was\nrevealed not by a child's views as such, but by the kind of dialogue a child has with adults.\nA third idea that Kelvin learned was about children's perceptions of adults' moral beliefs. Saltzstein found that\neven though older children (the 11-year-olds) showed more moral autonomy (were more steadfast) than younger\nchildren, they tended to believe that adults thought about moral issues in ways similar to children who were\nyounger. In the \"teasing\" dilemma mentioned above, for example, the 11-year-olds opted much more often than 7-\nyear-olds for remaining loyal to a friend, even though doing so meant further untruthfulness with peers. Yet the 11-\nyear-olds also more often stated a belief that adults would resolve the same dilemma in a way characteristic of 7-\nyear-olds\u2014that is, by telling the truth to peers and thus betraying loyalty to a friend. This finding puzzled Kelvin.\nWhy should older, and presumably more insightful, children think that adults are more like younger children than\nlike themselves? Saltzstein suggested an interpretation, however, that helped him make sense of the apparent\ninconsistency:\n...Consistent with our past research, children In other words, thought Kelvin, if children learned\nattributed the kinds of moral choices made by younger moral beliefs by imitating (or modeling themselves\nchildren to adults. In our view, this finding tends to after) parents or other adults, then they ought to see\nsupport a constructivist rather than a [social modeling] themselves as resembling adults more and more as they\nview of morality, which would predict that the child's get older. Instead, they see themselves as resembling\njudgments mirror (or develop toward) their adults less, at least during middle childhood. This\nrepresentation of adult judgments. [p. 41] would happen only if they were preoccupied with\n\"constructing\" their own beliefs on the basis of their\nexperiences, and therefore failed to notice that adults\nmight also have constructed beliefs similar to their own.\nRelevance: a framework for understanding moral development\nThe article by Saltzstein offered a way to understand how children develop moral beliefs, and especially to\nunderstand the change from moral heteronomy to moral autonomy. By imposing controls on the procedures\n(uniform interviews) and on the selection of participants (particular ages, particular societies or cultures), the\nresearchers eliminated certain sources of ambiguity or variability in children's responses. By framing their project\nin terms of previous theories of moral development (Piaget\u2019s, Turiel\u2019s), furthermore, they made it easier to interpret\ntheir new results in the general terms of these theories as well. In these ways the investigation aspired to provide a\ngeneral perspective about children's moral development. Providing a framework for understanding, you recall, is\none of the major purposes of many professional publications.\nBut note that the authors paid a price for emphasizing this purpose. By organizing their work around existing\ngeneral theory and research, they had to assume that readers already had some knowledge of that theory and\nresearch. This is not an unreasonable assumption if the readers are expected to be fellow researchers; after all,\nmany of them make a living by \"knowing the literature\" of psychology. But assuming such knowledge can be an\nobstacle if the authors intend to communicate with non-psychologists: in that case, either the authors must make\nEducational Psychology 361 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nmore of an effort to explain the relevant background research, or readers must educate themselves about the\nresearch. The latter activity is not necessarily difficult (the background knowledge for Saltzstein's work, for\nexample, took me only a few paragraphs to explain in writing), but it must be done to make full sense of research\nthat tries to provide a universal framework of psychological knowledge.\nThe reader's role: interested observer of children\nIn conducting and reporting their research, Saltzstein and his colleagues were not presenting themselves as\nschool teachers, nor were they expecting readers necessarily to respond as teachers. As they put it in the first\nparagraph of the article, they sought to offer \"a more contextualized perspective for understanding the development\nof moral judgments\" [p. 37]. Unlike most teachers, they seemed indifferent to recommending how children's moral\njudgements ought to be fostered. Observation of children was their purpose, not intervention. The meaning of the\nterm \"contextualized perspective\" was not obvious to Kelvin when he first read it, but eventually it became clearer:\nthey were talking about the importance of distinguishing among types of moral decisions and moral beliefs. They\ndid sometimes note information relevant to teaching\u2014for example, they pointed out that for cultural reasons,\nteachers in Brazil do not command high respect and therefore compared to American children, Brazilian children\nmay feel less compelled to tell the truth to their teachers. But this comment was not the primary focus of their\nresearch, nor did the authors discuss what (if anything) it might imply about teaching in the United States.\nYet the non-teaching perspective of the article did not keep Kelvin, a long-time school teacher and current\nuniversity teacher, from reflecting on the article in terms of its educational relevance. As we mentioned already,\nKelvin was attracted to the article because of his own concerns about character development in students\u2014how do\nthey acquire moral beliefs and commitments, and how should he help them in doing so? Kelvin did not really expect\nto find an answer to the second of these questions, given the \"observation\" orientation of the authors. He did hope\nto find an answer to the first, although even here he also expected that to make allowances for the fact that research\ninterviews are not usually identical to classroom situations. Children might respond differently when interviewed\nindividually by a researcher, compared to how they might respond to a teacher in class. Or perhaps not. So in\nreflecting on the article, Kelvin had to note the context and purposes of Saltzstein's study, and to remind himself\nthat once a teacher went beyond simply observing children to intervening on their behalf, the teacher might be led\nto different conclusions about children\u2019s moral development. But in spite of these cautions\u2014or maybe because of\nthem\u2014Kelvin found much food for thought in the article related to teaching.\nExample #2: Learning disability as a misleading label\nIn 2006, Ray McDermott, Shelley Goldman, and Herv\u00e9 Varenne published an article that discussed the use\nof disability categories in education. The article attracted Kelvin\u2019s attention because he had been concerned\nfor a long time about the ambiguities of disability categories (see Chapter 5 of this book) as well as about\ntheir potential for stigmatizing individuals. He expected the article to document additional problems with\nlabeling when a student is from a non-white ethnic group. Kelvin\u2019s expectation was fulfilled partially, but he\nwas surprised also to encounter an additional and tougher message in the article. Here is how the study\nbegan:\nSince about 1850\u2026classifying human beings by Kelvin had a mixed reaction to this opening. In one\nmental ability, accurately or not, has been a politically way it seemed to say something familiar\u2014that\n362 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nrewarded activity. Those with power have placed others, classification systems (such as categories for\nusually the downtrodden, into ability and disposition disabilities) may create problems for individuals. But\ngroups that they cannot escape\u2026 People who live the tone of the paragraph sounded more severely\ntogether in a culture must struggle constantly with the critical than Kelvin had expected: it was saying that\nconstraints\u2026of systems of classification and power governed all classifications, implying that\ninterpretation used in the culture. misclassifications may be widespread or even universal.\nKelvin\u2019s initial hunch was therefore that the article would express a radically critical view of disability\nclassifications\u2014particularly as they affect the \u201cdowntrodden\u201d, which presumably included children from\nminority ethnic groups. His expectation proved correct as the authors explained their point of view, which\nthey called a cultural approach to understanding disability. Using learning disabilities (LD) as an example,\nhere is how they explained their position:\nWe are not as interested in LD behavior as in the At this point Kelvin was not sure if he wanted to\npreoccupations\u2014as seen from the level of classroom continue reading the article because it seemed like it\norganization\u2014of all those adults who are professionally might not be relevant to classroom life specifically. It\npoised to discover LD behavior. We are less interested also implied a severe criticism of professional educators\nin the characteristics of LD children than in the cultural \u2014implied that they are too eager to find examples of LD\narrangements that make an LD label relevant. and for this reason may misclassify students. On the\nother hand, Kelvin was already aware that LD are an\nespecially ambiguous category of disability; maybe the\narticle would help to show why. So he kept reading.\nThe authors continued by outlining the history of LD as a category of disability, describing this category as an\noutgrowth of the general intelligence testing movement during the twentieth century. By the 1970s, they argued, the\nconcept of LD offered a way to classify children with academic difficulties without having to call the children\nmentally disabled. Because of this fact, the LD category was needed\u2014literally\u2014by well-off parents who did not want\ntheir children treated or educated as children with mental disabilities. LD as a concept and category came to be\napplied primarily to children from the white middle-class, and mental disability became, by default, the equivalent\ncategory for the non-white and poor.\nTo support this assertion, the authors reported a classroom observation of three non-white boys\u2014Hector,\nRicardo, and Boomer\u2014while they worked together to design an imaginary research station in Antarctica. Citing\nactual transcripts of conversation while the boys worked, the authors concluded that all three boys showed\nintelligence and insight about the assignment, but that the teacher was only aware of the contributions of one of the\nboys. Hector systematically hid his knowledge from the teacher\u2019s view by getting Boomer to speak for their group;\nRicardo participated well in the group work but was rarely acknowledged by the other two boys. Boomer received\nconsiderable praise from the teacher, thanks to his speaking for the group. Yet the teacher was never aware of these\nsubtleties. The authors blamed her oversight not on the teacher herself, but on an educational and cultural system\nthat leads educators to classify or typify students too quickly or easily. Here is how they put it:\nEducational Psychology 363 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nThe American classroom is well organized for the When Kelvin read this conclusion, he did not really\nproduction of display of failure, one child at a time if disagree, but he did feel that it was beside the point for\npossible, but group by group if necessary\u2026Even if the most teachers.

In such a classroom, if there were no LD Kelvin wished, at the end, that the authors had made\ncategories, someone would have to invent them. some of these suggestions.\nRelevance: a critical framework\nIn this study the authors offered a sort of backhanded framework of thinking about categories of disability; or\nmore precisely they offered a framework for understanding what the categories are not. In essence they said that\ndisability categories describe qualities \u201cin\u201d students only in the sense that educators and others happen to think of\ndisability categories in this way. An equally reasonable way to think about disabilities, they argued, is that modern\nsociety is organized so that its citizens have to be classified for many different reasons. Educators are simply\nhelping to implement this society-wide expectation. A frequent result in classrooms is that teachers classify\nstudents too easily and that key evidence of students\u2019 capacity is overlooked.\nIn making this argument, the authors implied an indirect recommendation about how to teach, though the\nrecommendation actually focused on what teachers should not do. Instead of (mis)identifying children with\nlearning difficulties, the authors implied, teachers and other educators should stop concerning themselves with\nclassifying children, and seek to reorganize classrooms and schools so that classification is less important. \u201cChange\nthe school\u201d, they wrote, \u201cand LD becomes less relevant\u201d. This conclusion may be an important reminder, but it is\nnot especially helpful as a recommendation to practicing teachers, who usually need to know about more than what\nto avoid.\nThe readers\u2019 role: concerned advocate for social justice\nIt is not surprising that the article lacked concrete recommendations for teaching, given that the authors seemed\nto speak to readers not as classroom teachers, but as general critics of society who are concerned about fairness or\nsocial justice. Their comments made two assumptions: first, that readers will want to minimize unfair stereotypes of\nstudents, and second, that readers will seek greater fairness in how teachers treat students. For readers who happen\nto be teachers themselves, the first of these assumptions is a reasonable one; most of us would indeed like to\nminimize unfair stereotyping of students. The second is also reasonable, but perhaps not in a way that the authors\nintended. Teachers probably do try their best to treat students fairly and respectfully. Their responsibilities usually\nmean, however, that they can only do this conveniently with their own students; the time available to work toward\n364 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\ngeneral social justice is often limited. (As you might suspect, Kelvin was not fully satisfied after he finished reading\nthis article!)\nExample #3: The impact of bilingualism on reading\nIn 1995, three education professors\u2014Robert Jim\u00e9nez, Georgia Garc\u00eda, and David Pearson\u2014published a\nstudy about the impact of bilingualism on children's ability to read English (1995). The three specialized in\ncurriculum studies, literacy acquisition, and bilingual language development, and were therefore motivated\nby a concern for the academic success of bilingual children and especially by concern for identifying why\nbilingual children sometimes have difficulty learning to read English. Too much research on bilingualism,\nthey argued, was based on what they called a \"deficit\" framework: it focused on what bilingual children\nlacked compared to monolinguals. They sought an alternative framework, one focused on bilingual students'\ncompetence, and especially on their competence to read a second language.\nTo search for this alternative, the researchers mounted a large research program, and the article published in\n1995 was one of the studies resulting from this research. It caught Kelvin\u2019s interest not only because of its topic, but\nbecause of its approach. Instead of surveying dozens of students with a questionnaire, as researchers sometimes do,\nthese investigators relied on just three students studied intensively. Each student became a case study and included\ndetailed, lengthy observations and interviews of that particular student. Each student was chosen deliberately for a\nparticular purpose. One was a highly proficient reader who was also bilingual (Spanish and English); a second was a\nmarginally proficient reader who was bilingual (Spanish and English); and a third was a highly proficient reader\nwho was monolingual in English. To qualify for the study, furthermore, each student had to be comfortable\nreflecting on and talking about their own reading processes, so that the authors could interview them at length on\nthis topic. The researchers asked each student to read six one-page passages in English and (where relevant) in\nSpanish. They invited all three to think aloud about their reading as they went along, commenting on how they\nfigured out particular words or passages. The oral readings and think-aloud commentaries were taped and\ntranscribed, and became the information on which the authors based their conclusions and recommendations.\nUsing these procedures, Jim\u00e9nez, Garc\u00eda, and Pearson discovered important differences among the three girls.\nThe proficient bilingual, Pamela, used her growing knowledge of each language to help in learning vocabulary from\nthe other language. When she encountered the English word \u201cspecies\u201d , for example, she guessed correctly that it\nmeant the same as the similar Spanish word \u201cespecies\u201d; and when she encountered the Spanish \u201cliqu\u00eddo\u201d, she\nguessed correctly that it meant the English \u201cliquid\u201d. Her focus on learning vocabulary was stronger than for the\nproficient monolingual, Michelle, who commented less on specific words than how the overall reading passages\nrelated to her prior general knowledge. The difference presumably stemmed from Michelle's greater familiarity with\nEnglish vocabulary\u2014so much greater, in fact, that Michelle did not need to think about individual words\ndeliberately. Both Michelle and Pamela differed, however, from the less-proficient bilingual reader, Christine. Like\nPamela, Christine focused on vocabulary, but she did not think of her native Spanish as a resource for this task.\nWhen reading a Spanish word, she was sometimes reminded of English equivalents (\"cognates,\" as language\nteachers call them), but she did not use her much greater knowledge of Spanish to assist with her more limited\nEnglish. She did not search for equivalent words deliberately, as Pamela did.\nEducational Psychology 365 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nRelevance: recommendations for teaching english as an additional language\nThe authors of this article focused more directly on particular learning behaviors than did the authors of the two\narticles described earlier. Jimenez and his colleagues emphasized the importance of regarding a child's native\nlanguage as a strength in the process, not a liability, and they then pointed out the importance of facilitating\nvocabulary development. But they did not claim this recommendation to be appropriate for all children or for all\nforms of bilingualism. They only focused on a particular pair of languages (Spanish and English in the USA), and on\nthree combinations of skill level in these two languages. These are common bilingual experiences in the United\nStates, but they are not the only ones, either in the United States or elsewhere in the world.\nFor other bilingual situations, their conclusions might not hold true. For some students (e.g. Chinese-\nAmericans), the native language and the second language are much more different in vocabulary, pronunciation,\nand grammar than Spanish is to English, and therefore may provide less of a resource to a child learning to read. In\nsome settings, relationships between languages are more equal than in the United States. In Canada, for example,\nboth the numbers and the overall social status of English speakers and French speakers are more equal than in the\nUnited States. In both of these situations, if a child fails to learn to read the second language, it may not be for the\nreasons suggested by Robert Jim\u00e9nez, but for other reasons, ranging from difficulties with reading per se to cultural\ndifferences in how a child expects to be taught (Johnson, 2004).\nThe reader's role: both teacher and researcher\nIn the published article describing their research, Jim\u00e9nez, Garc\u00eda, and Pearson assumed that readers have some\nfamiliarity with bilingual students and with issues related to teaching reading. They began their article by\ndescribing previous research studies in these areas\u2014more than a dozen of them, in fact. In the middle they\ndescribed numerous responses of the three bilingual students to the passages they were asked to read. At the end of\nthe article they made specific suggestions for teaching, such as \"focus more on vocabulary development\". When\nKelvin read these various sections, he found that his prior knowledge of and reflections about teaching helped to\nmake sense of them. But he also found that did not need to be an expert in bilingualism order to understand the\nauthors' messages\u2014he had never, in fact, taught English as a Second Language, nor had he ever conducted research\non reading or bilingual language development.\nAction research: hearing from teachers about improving practice\nEach of the professional articles just described offers ideas and recommendations that can stimulate reflection\nabout teaching and learning. But they all suffer from a particular limitation: Although they often relate to teachers\nand classrooms, teachers\u2019 role in influencing in designing and interpreting a study is minimal. In the world of\neducational research, persons other than teachers\u2014typically professors, educational administrators, or other\nprofessional researchers\u2014tend to speak on behalf of teachers. All three of the articles described earlier in this\nchapter had this feature. Persons other than teachers chose the research topics.\nThe information that emerges from this arrangement often still relates to teaching and learning, and may\ncontain useful insights for classroom work. But by definition, it is framed by people whose interests and\nfundamental commitments may not be identical with classroom teachers. As a result, the studies are somewhat\nmore likely to attend to problems posed by academic disciplines or by educational administrators. Two of the\nstudies which we described earlier\u2014the ones about moral development and about labels for disabilities\u2014showed\n366 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nthis quality. Classroom teachers are concerned, of course, about both moral development and categorizing of\nstudents. But if teachers had designed the two projects themselves, they might have re-framed both of them to focus\nmore explicitly on the challenges of classroom teaching. In studying moral beliefs, for example, teachers might have\nfocused more squarely on how to foster moral beliefs in their students. In studying inclusive education, they might\nhave focused more fully on the practical difficulties faced by teachers in assessing students\u2019 learning disabilities\nwith validity.\nThe nature of action research\nIn view of these issues, a particularly important kind of investigation for teachers is action research (sometimes\nalso teacher research), an activity referring to systematic, intentional inquiry by teachers for the purpose of\nimproving their own practice (Stenhouse, 1985; Brydon-Miller, Greenwood, & Maguire, 2003; Russell, T. &\nLoughran, J. 2005). Action research is not to be confused with research about teaching and learning, which are\ninvestigations by professional researchers on topics of teachers, teaching, or learning.\nAction research has several defining characteristics, in addition to being planned and conducted by teachers.\nFirst, it originates in the problems and dilemmas of classroom practice, or in chronic problems with certain\nstudents, materials, or activities. Second, its outcomes offer information focused on particular teachers and\nclassrooms, rather than about teachers in general or students in general. Although this feature might make action\nresearch seem less useful as a source of advice or knowledge that is truly general, supporters argue that focusing on\nspecific learning contexts makes action research more credible or valid as a source of practical information and\nideas. It is, they argue, simply more attuned to the context of real classrooms (St. Clair, 2005). Third, while the\naudience for action research can certainly include professors and educational administrators, the audience tends to\nbe other teachers (Fenstermacher, 1994; Ackerman & MacKenzie, 2007). Action research is therefore in an\nespecially strong position to provide \"insider\" perspectives on educational problems.\nAction research in practice\nAction research makes a number of assumptions as a result of its nature and purposes (Richardson, 1994;\nSchmuck, 2006). To varying degrees, most such studies support some combination of these ideas:\n\u2022 that teaching is itself really a form of research\n\u2022 that action research, like teaching itself, requires substantial reflection\n\u2022 that collaboration among teachers is crucial for making teacher research meaningful, and for the\nimprovement of teaching\n\u2022 that teachers' knowledge of teaching has to be shared publicly, especially when gained systematically\nthrough action research\nTo see how these features look in practice, look at several examples of action research studies.\nExample #1: Focusing on motivating students\nA number of years ago, Patricia Clifford and Sharon Friesen published an account of their effort to develop a\nclassroom program based on students' out-of-school interests and experiences (1993). Clifford and Friesen\nwere co-teachers in a double-sized classroom which deliberately included children from first, second and\nEducational Psychology 367 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nthird grades. Their interest in students\u2019 out-of-school experiences grew out of three more basic questions\nabout teaching, which they phrased like this:\n\u2022 How can curriculum remain open to children's unique experiences and connect with the world they know\noutside the school? Too often, the official school curriculum lacked meaning for children because it seemed\ncut off from the rest of the world. The result was unmotivated students and poor learning.\n\u2022 Why is imaginative experience the best starting place for planning? The teachers felt that imaginative\nexperiences\u2014make-believe play, stories, poems\u2014provided access to children's lives outside school\u2014their\nmake-believe play, or their stories or poems. Perhaps somehow these could be connected to the goals of the\nofficial curriculum.\n\u2022 What happens when teachers break down the barriers between school knowledge and real knowledge? In\ndrawing on children's outside experiences, would children actually become more motivated or not? Would\nthey take over the program, and fail to learn the official curriculum goals?\nTo answer these questions, the teachers kept extensive diaries or journals for one entire school year. These\nbecame the \u201cdata\u201d for the research. In the journals, they described and reflected on their daily teaching\nexperiences. The teachers also talked with each other extensively about classroom events and their significance,\nand the results of the conversations often entered the journals eventually during the research. In their journal,\nfor example, the teachers recorded an experience with students about ways of telling time. In preliminary\ndiscussions the students became interested in how a sundial worked. So the teachers and students went outside,\nwhere they created a human sundial, using the students themselves. The teachers' journal kept a chronicle of\nthese events, and noted the comments and questions which students developed as a result:\n\u2022 If you stood in the same place for a whole day you would see your shadow change places because the earth\nchanges position.\n\u2022 Why is my shadow longer than I am in the evening, but shorter at noon?\n\u2022 Clouds can block the sun's rays so sundials won't work on rainy days.\n\u2022 How did people start to tell time?\nAs the year evolved and observations accumulated and were recorded, the teachers gradually began to\nanswer their own three questions. They found, for example, that connecting the curriculum with children's\ninterests and motives was most effective when they could establish a personal bond with a child. They also\nfound that imaginative expression helped certain children to feel safe to explore ideas. They found that\nblending school-based and personal knowledge caused children to learn much more than before\u2014although\nmuch of the additional knowledge was not part of an official curriculum. With these conclusions in mind, and\nwith numerous examples to support them, Clifford and Friesen published their study so that others could\nshare what they had learned about teaching, learning, and students.\nThe study by Clifford and Friesen is interesting in its own right, but for our purposes think for a moment about\ntheir work as an example of action research. One of its features is that it formed part of the normal course of\nteaching: the authors were simply more systematic about how they observed the students and recorded information\n368 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nabout classroom events. Another feature is that the research required conscious reflection over an extended time:\ntheir journals and conversations contained not only descriptions of events, but also interpretations of the events. A\nthird feature is that the study involved collaboration: it was not just one teacher studying the major questions, but\ntwo. Th fourth feature is that the teachers not only developed their results and conclusions for themselves, but also\nshared them with others. These four qualities make the study by Clifford and Friesen a clear example of teacher\nresearch. Note, though, that sometimes studies conducted by teachers may not show all of these features so clearly;\ninstead they may show some of the key features, but not all of them, as in the next two examples.\nExample #2: Focusing on development\nSince 1981, Vivian Paley has published a series of short books documenting and interpreting her observations\nof young children in classrooms (1981, 1986, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2005). Paley was interested in how young\nchildren develop or change over the long term, and in particular how the development looks from the point of\nview of a classroom teacher. In one of these books, for example, she observed one child in particular, Mollie,\nfrom the time she entered nursery school just after her third birthday until after the child turned four years\nold (Paley, 1986). Her interest was not focused on curriculum, as Clifford and Friesen's had done, but on\nMollie as a growing human being; \"the subject which I most wished to learn,\" she wrote, \"is children\" (p. xiv).\nPaley therefore wrote extended narrative (or story-like) observations about the whole range of activities of\nthis one child, and wove in periodic brief reflections on the observations. Because the observations took\nstory-like form, her books read a bit like novels: themes are sometimes simply suggested by the story line,\nrather than stated explicitly. Using this approach, Paley demonstrated (but occasionally also stated) several\nimportant developmental changes. In Mollie at Three (1988), for example, she describes examples of Mollie's\nlanguage development. At three years, the language was often disconnected from Mollie\u2019s actions\u2014she would\ntalk about one thing, but do another. By four, she was much more likely to tie language to her current\nactivities, and in this sense she more often \"said what she meant\". A result of the change was that Mollie also\nbegan understanding and following classroom rules as the year went on, because the language of rules\nbecame more connected in her mind to the actions to which they referred.\nVivian Paley's book had some of the characteristics of action research\u2014but with differences from Clifford and\nFriesen\u2019s. Like their research, Paley's \u201cdata\u201d was based on her own teaching, while her teaching was influenced in\nturn by her systematic observations. Like Clifford and Friesen\u2019s, Paley\u2019s research involved numerous reflections on\nteaching, and it led to a public sharing of the reflections\u2014in this case in the form of several small books. Unlike\nClifford and Friesen, though, Paley worked independently, without collaboration. Unlike Clifford and Friesen, she\ndeliberately integrated observation and interpretation as they might be integrated in a piece of fiction, so that the\nresulting \"story\" often implied or showed its message without stating it in so may words. In this regard her work\nhad qualities of what some educators call arts-based research, which are studies that take advantage of an artistic\nmedium (in this case, narrative or story-like writing) to heighten readers' understanding and response to research\nfindings (Barone and Eisner, 2006). If you are studying the use of space in the classroom, for example, then\naesthetically organized visual depictions (photos, drawings) of the room may be more helpful and create more\nunderstanding than verbal descriptions. If you are studying children's musical knowledge, on the other hand,\nrecordings of performances by the children may be more helpful and informative than discussions of performances.\nEducational Psychology 369 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nExample #3: Focusing on collaboration\nIn 1996, an example of action research was published that was intended simultaneously for classroom\nteachers and for university researchers, and which focused on the challenges of collaboration among\neducators (Ulichny & Schoener, 1996). A teacher (Wendy Schoener) and a university researcher (Polly\nUlichny) explored how, or even whether, teachers and university researchers could participate as equals in\nthe study of teaching. Wendy (the two used first names throughout when they published their experiences)\nwas a teacher of adults learning English as a Second Language (ESL); Polly was a specialist in multicultural\neducation and wanted to observe a teacher who was successful at reaching the ethnically diverse students\nwho normally study ESL. Polly therefore asked Wendy for permission to study her teaching for an extended\nperiod of time\u2014to visit her class, videotape it, interview her about it, and the like.\nWhat followed is best described as an extended negotiation between teacher and professor for access to Wendy's\nclass, on the one hand, and for mutual respect for each other's work, on the other. In the published article, the\nnegotiations are described separately by each participant, in order to honor the differences in their concerns and\nperspectives. Before, during, and after the observations, it was necessary for Polly and Wendy each to adjust\nexpectations of what the other person could do and was willing to do. As the authors put it, some things were \"easy\nto hear\" from the other and some things were \"hard to hear\". Wendy, as a teacher, found it easier to hear criticisms\nof her teaching if they came from herself, rather than from the higher-status university professor, Polly. Polly, for\nher part, found it easier to hear Wendy's comments if she matched Wendy's self-criticisms and evaluations with\nsome of her own experiences. Polly therefore made sure to tell Wendy about dilemmas and problems she\nexperienced in her own (university) teaching. Because they needed to adjust to hearing and talking with each other,\nthe two educators eventually focused less on Polly's original purpose\u2014studying multicultural teaching\u2014and more\non the problem of how teachers and university researchers might collaborate effectively.\nOverall, this study qualifies as a piece of action research, though it is not fully focused on classroom teaching.\nFor example, the teachers did collaborate and reflect on their experiences, but not all of the reflection was about\nteaching in classrooms. The rest was about the relationship between Wendy and Polly. While the problem selected\nwas originally about classroom teaching\u2014Wendy\u2019s\u2014it did not originate with the classroom teacher (Wendy) or\nconcerns she had about her own classroom; instead it was chosen by the university researcher (Polly) and her\ndesire to study multicultural teaching. The researchers did share what they learned by publishing their observations\nand ideas, but their published report speaks only partly to classroom teachers as such; in addition it speaks to\nacademic researchers and educators of future teachers.\nBy pointing out differences among these examples of action research, we do not mean to imply that one is\n\u201cbetter\u201d than another. The point is simply to show how diverse studies by teachers can be and to appreciate their\ndifferences. Whatever their specific features, classroom studies by teachers hold in common the commitment to\ngiving a voice to teachers as they reflect on problems and challenges intrinsic to classroom life. This goal can be\naccomplished in more than one way: through journals and other record-keeping methods, through oral discussions\nwith colleagues, and through written reflections created either for themselves or for others concerned about\nteaching and learning. Diversity among topics and methods in action research studies should not surprise us, in\nfact, since classrooms are themselves so diverse.\n370 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\nThe challenges of action research\nWell and good, you may say. Action research offers teachers a way to hear each other, to learn from their own\nand other's experience. But there are also a few cautions to keep in mind, both ethical and practical. Look briefly at\neach of these areas.\nEthical cautions about action research\nOne caution is the possibility of conflict of interest between the roles of teaching and conducting action research\n(Hammack, 1997). A teacher\u2019s first priorities should be the welfare of his or her students: first and foremost, you\nwant students to learn, to be motivated, to feel accepted by their peers, and the like. A researcher\u2019s first priorities,\nhowever, are to the field or topic being studied. The two kinds of priorities may often overlap and support each\nother. Vivian Paley\u2019s observations of children in her classes, described earlier, not only supported her children\u2019s\nlearning, but also her studies of the children.\nBut situations can also occur in which action research and teaching are less compatible, and can create ethical\ndilemmas. The problems usually relate to one of three issues: privacy, informed consent, or freedom to participate.\nEach of these becomes an issue only if the results of a research project are made public, either in a journal or book,\nas with the examples we have given in this chapter, or simply by being described or shared outside the classroom.\n(Sharing, you may recall, is one of the defining features of action research.) Look briefly at each of the issues.\nInsuring privacy of the student\nTeachers often learn information about students that the students or their families may not want publicized.\nSuppose, for example, you have a student with an intellectual disability in your class, and you wish to study how the\nstudent learns. Observing the student work on (and possibly struggle with) academic activities may be quite\nconsistent with a teacher\u2019s responsibilities; after all, teachers normally should pay attention to their students\u2019\nacademic efforts. But the student or his family may not want such observations publicized or even shared\ninformally with other parents or teachers. They may feel that doing so would risk stigmatizing the student publicly.\nTo respect the student\u2019s privacy and still study his learning behavior, the teacher (alias the \u201caction researcher\u201d)\ntherefore needs to disguise the student\u2019s identity whenever the research results are made public. In any written or\noral report, or even in any hallway conversation about the project, the teacher/researcher would use a pseudonym\nfor the student, and change other identifying information such as the physical description of the student or even the\nstudent\u2019s gender. There are limits, however, to how much can be disguised without changing essential information.\nThe teacher could not, for example, hide the fact of the intellectual disability without compromising the point of the\nstudy; yet the intellectual disability might be unusual enough that it would effectively identify the student being\nstudied.\nGaining informed consent\nStudents may not understand what is being studied about them, or even realize that they are being studied at all,\nunless the teacher/researcher makes an explicit effort to inform them about the action research and how she will\nuse the results from it. The same is true for the students\u2019 parents; unless the teacher-researcher makes an effort to\ncontact parents, they simply will not know that their child\u2019s activities are being observed or may eventually be made\npublic. Students\u2019 ignorance is especially likely if the students are very young (kindergarten) or have intellectual or\nreading difficulties, as in the example we described above. As an action researcher, therefore, a teacher is obliged to\nEducational Psychology 371 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nexplain the nature of a research project clearly, either in a letter written in simple language or in a face-to-face\nconversation, or both. Parents and students need to give clear indications that they actually understand what class\nactivities or materials will constitute data that could be made public. In most cases, indicating informed consent\nmeans asking students\u2019 parents signing a letter giving permission for the study. Sometimes, in addition, it is a good\nidea to recheck with students or parents periodically as the project unfolds, to make sure that they still support\nparticipation.\nInsuring freedom to participate\nWhen a student fails to participate in an ordinary class activity, most teachers consider it legitimate to insist on the\nstudent\u2019s participation\u2014either by persuading, demanding, or (perhaps) tricking the student to join. Doing so is ethical\nfor teachers in their roles as teachers, because teachers are primarily responsible for insuring that students learn, and\nstudents\u2019 participation presumably facilitates learning. If a teacher designates an activity as part of an action research\nproject, however, and later shares the results with them, the teacher then also becomes partly responsible for how other\nteachers use knowledge of the research study. (Remember: sharing results is intrinsically part of the research process.)\nThe resulting dual commitment means that \u201cforcing\u201d a student to participate in an action research activity can no\nlonger be justified solely as being for the student\u2019s own educational good.\nMuch of the time, a simultaneous commitment to both teachers and students presents no real dilemma: what is\ngood for the action research project may also be good for the students. But not always. Suppose, for example, that a\nteacher wants to do research about students\u2019 beliefs about war and global conflict, and doing so requires that students\nparticipate in numerous extended group discussions on this topic. Even though the group discussions might resemble a\nsocial studies lesson and in this sense be generally acceptable as a class activity, some parents (or students) may object\nbecause they take too much class time away from the normal curriculum topics. Yet the research project necessitates\ngiving it lots of discussion time in class. To respond ethically to this dilemma, therefore, the teacher may need to allow\nstudents to opt out of the discussions if they or their parents choose. She may therefore need to find ways for them to\ncover an alternate set of activities from the curriculum. (One way to do this, for example, is to hold the special group\ndiscussions outside regular class times\u2014though this obviously also increases the amount of work for both the teacher\nand students.)\nPractical issues about action research\nIs action research practical? From one perspective the answer has to be \"Of course not!\u201d Action research is not\npractical because it may take teachers\u2019 time and effort which they could sometimes use in other ways. Keep in mind,\nthough, that a major part of the effort needed for action research involves the same sort of work\u2014observing,\nrecording information, reflecting\u2014that is needed for any teaching that is done well. A better way to assess\npracticality may therefore be to recognize that teaching students always takes a lot of work, and to ask whether the\nadditional thoughtfulness brought on by action research will make the teaching more successful.\nLooked at in this way, action research is indeed practical, though probably not equally so on every occasion. If\nyou choose to learn about the quality of conversational exchanges between yourself and students, for example, you\nwill need some way to record these dialogues, or at least to keep accurate, detailed notes on them. Recording the\ndialogues may be practical and beneficial\u2014or not, depending on your circumstances. On the other hand, if you\nchoose to study how and why certain students remain on the margins of your class socially, this problem too may be\n372 This book is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License\npractical as action research. Or it may not, depending on whether you can find a way to observe and reflect on\nstudents' social interactions, or lack thereof. Much depends on your circumstances\u2014on the attention you can afford\nto give to your research problem while teaching, in relation to the benefits that solutions to the problems will bring\nstudents later. In general any action research project may require certain choices about how to teach, though it\nshould not interfere with basic instructional goals or prevent coverage of an important curriculum. The main point\nto remember is that action research is more than passive observation of students and classrooms; it also includes\neducational interventions, efforts to stimulate students to new thinking and new responses. Those are features of\nregular teaching; the difference is primarily in how systematically and reflectively you do them.\nBenefiting from all kinds of research\nAlthough we authors both feel a degree of sympathy for the nature and purposes of action research, we are not\ntrying to advocate for it at the expense of other forms of educational research or at the expense of simply reading\nand understanding professional publications in general. The challenge for you, as a classroom teacher, is to find the\nvalue in all forms of professional development, whether it be participation in a professional association, reading\ngeneral articles about research, or engaging in your own action research. To the extent that you draw on them all,\nyour ways of learning about teaching will be enriched. You will acquire more ways to understand classroom life,\nwhile at the same time acquiring perspective on that life. You will learn ways to grasp the individuality of particular\nstudents, but also to see what they need in common. You will have more ways to interpret your own experiences as\na professional teacher, but also be able to learn from the professional experience of others. Realizing these benefits\nfully is a challenge, because the very diversity of classrooms renders problems about teaching and learning complex\nand diverse as well. But you will also gain good, professional company in searching for better understanding of your\nwork\u2014company that includes both educational researchers, other professional teachers, and of course your\nstudents.\nChapter summary\nThe complexities of teaching require teachers to continue learning throughout their teaching careers. To\nbecome a lifelong reflective practitioner, teachers can rely on colleagues as a resource, on professional associations\nand their activities, and on professional publications related to educational issues and needs. Understanding the\nlatter, in turn, requires understanding the purposes of the published material\u2014whether it is offering a general\nframework, recommending desirable teaching practices, or advocating for a particular educational policy or need.\nInterpreting published material also requires understanding the assumptions that authors make about readers\u2019\nprior knowledge and beliefs.\nAn important additional strategy for becoming a reflective practitioner is action research\u2014studies of teaching\nand learning designed and carried out by teachers in order to improve their own practice. By nature, action\nresearch studies are highly relevant to classroom practice, but there are also cautions about it to keep in mind, both\nethically and practically.\nKey terms\naction research insuring freedom to participate\nassumptions about readers\u2019 prior knowledge professional associations\ninformed consent purposes of educational research\ninsuring privacy of students reflective practitioner\nEducational Psychology 373 A Global Text Appendix C: The reflective practitioner\nreliability validity\nOn the Internet\n< http:// www.aera.net > This is the official website of the American Educational Research Association (or\nAERA), a major \"umbrella\" professional association supporting educational research of all kinds.
