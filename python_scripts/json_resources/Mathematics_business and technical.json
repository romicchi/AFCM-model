Operations with Real Numbers\nThe chart below shows us how the number sets fit together. In this chapter we will work with rational\nnumbers, but you will be also introduced to irrational numbers. The set of rational numbers together\nwith the set of irrational numbers make up the set of real numbers.\n1  1.1 Algebraic Expressions\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section it is expected that you will be able to:\n\u2022 Use variables and algebraic symbols\n\u2022 Identify expressions and equations\n\u2022 Simplify expressions with exponents\n\u2022 Simplify expressions using the order of operations\n\u2022 Evaluate algebraic expressions\nUse Variables and Algebraic Symbols\nIn algebra, letters of the alphabet are used to represent variables.\nLetters often used for variables are .\nVariables and Constants\nA variable is a letter that represents a number or quantity whose value may change.\nA constant is a number whose value always stays the same.\nTo write algebraically, we need some symbols as well as numbers and variables. There are several\ntypes of symbols we will be using. There are four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, and division. We will summarize them here, along with words we use for the operations\nand the result.\n3 4 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nOperation Notation Say: The result is\u2026\nAddition the sum of and\nSubtraction the difference of and\nMultiplication The product of and\nDivision divided by The quotient of and\nIn algebra, the cross symbol, \u00d7, is not used to show multiplication because that symbol may cause\nconfusion. Does mean (three times ) or (three times )? To make it\nclear, use \u2022 or parentheses for multiplication.When two quantities have the same value, we say they are\nequal and connect them with an equal sign.\nEquality Symbol\nThe symbol is called the equal sign.\nAn inequality is used in algebra to compare two quantities that may have different values. The number\nline can help you understand inequalities. Remember that on the number line the numbers get larger as\nthey go from left to right. So if we know that is greater than , it means that is to the right of on\nthe number line. We use the symbols < and > for inequalities.\nInequality\n< is read is less than\nis to the left of on the number line\n> is read is greater than\nis to the right of on the number line\nThe expressions < > can be read from left-to-right or right-to-left, though in English we\nusually read from left-to-right. In general, 1.1 Algebraic Expressions 5\nWhen we write an inequality symbol with a line under it, such as , it means or . We\nread this is less than or equal to . Also, if we put a slash through an equal sign, it means not equal.\nWe summarize the symbols of equality and inequality in the table below.\nAlgebraic Notation Say\nis equal to\nis not equal to\n< is less than\n> is greater than\nis less than or equal to\nis greater than or equal to\nSymbols < and >\nThe symbols < and > each have a smaller side and a larger side.\nsmaller side < larger side\nlarger side > smaller side\nThe smaller side of the symbol faces the smaller number and the larger faces the larger number.\nGrouping symbols in algebra are much like the commas, colons, and other punctuation marks in written\nlanguage. They indicate which expressions are to be kept together and separate from other expressions.\nThe table below lists three of the most commonly used grouping symbols in algebra.\nCommon Grouping Symbols\nName Symbol\nparentheses\nbrackets\nbraces 6 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nHere are some examples of expressions that include grouping symbols. We will simplify expressions\nlike these later in this section.\nIdentify Expressions and Equations\nWhat is the difference in English between a phrase and a sentence? A phrase expresses a single thought\nthat is incomplete by itself, but a sentence makes a complete statement. \u201cRunning very fast\u201d is a phrase,\nbut \u201cThe football player was running very fast\u201d is a sentence. A sentence has a subject and a verb.\nIn algebra, we have expressions and equations. An expression is like a phrase. Here are some examples\nof expressions and how they relate to word phrases:\nExpression Words Phrase\nthe sum of three and five\nminus one the difference of and one\nthe product of six and seven\ndivided by the quotient of and\nNotice that the phrases do not form a complete sentence because the phrase does not have a verb. An\nequation is two expressions linked with an equal sign. When you read the words the symbols represent\nin an equation, you have a complete sentence in English. The equal sign gives the verb. Here are some\nexamples of equations:\nEquation Sentence\nThe sum of three and five is equal to eight.\nminus one equals fourteen.\nThe product of six and seven is equal to forty-two.\nis equal to fifty-three.\nplus nine is equal to two minus three.\nExpressions and Equations\nAn expression is a number, a variable, or a combination of numbers and variables and operation symbols.\nAn equation is made up of two expressions connected by an equal sign. 1.1 Algebraic Expressions 7\nEXAMPLE 1\nDetermine if each is an expression or an equation:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\nSolution\na.

For example, to simplify\nwe\u2019d first multiply to get and then add the to get . A good habit to develop is to\nwork down the page, writing each step of the process below the previous step. The example just\ndescribed would look like this: 8 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nSuppose we have the expression . We could write this more compactly\nusing exponential notation. Exponential notation is also called power and is used in algebra to\nrepresent a quantity multiplied by itself several times. We write as and\nas . In expressions such as , the is called the base and the is called\nthe exponent. The exponent tells us how many factors of the base we have to multiply.\nWe say is in exponential notation and is in expanded notation.\nExponential Notation (Power)\nFor any expression is a factor multiplied by itself times if is a positive integer.\nThe expression is read to the power.\nFor powers of and , we have special names.\nThe table below lists some examples of expressions written in exponential notation.\nExponential Notation In Words\nto the second power, or squared\nto the third power, or cubed\nto the fourth power\nto the fifth power 1.1 Algebraic Expressions 9\nEXAMPLE 2\nWrite each expression in exponential form:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\nSolution\na.

Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in\ndifferent values.\nFor example, consider the expression:\nImagine the confusion that could result if every problem had several different correct answers. The\nsame expression should give the same result. So mathematicians established some guidelines called the\norder of operations, which outlines the order in which parts of an expression must be simplified.\nOrder of Operations\nWhen simplifying mathematical expressions perform the operations in the following order:\n1. Parentheses and other Grouping Symbols\n\u2022 Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols, working on the\ninnermost parentheses first.\n2. Exponents\n\u2022 Simplify all expressions with exponents.\n3. Multiplication and Division\n\u2022 Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These operations have equal\npriority.\n4. Addition and Subtraction\n\u2022 Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations have equal\npriority.\nStudents often ask, \u201cHow will I remember the order?\u201d Here is a way to help you remember: Take the first\nletter of each key word and substitute the silly phrase.\nPlease Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally. 12 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nPlease Parentheses\nExcuse Exponents\nMy Dear Multiplication and Division\nAunt Sally Addition and Subtraction\nIt\u2019s good that \u2018My Dear\u2019 goes together, as this reminds us that multiplication and division have equal priority.\nWe do not always do multiplication before division or always do division before multiplication. We do them\nin order from left to right.\nSimilarly, \u2018Aunt Sally\u2019 goes together and so reminds us that addition and subtraction also have equal priority\nand we do them in order from left to right.\nEXAMPLE 5\nSimplify the expressions:\na.\nb.\nSolution\na.\nAre there any parentheses?

In this section, we\u2019ll\nevaluate expressions\u2014again following the order of operations.\nTo evaluate an algebraic expression means to find the value of the expression when the variable is\nreplaced by a given number. To evaluate an expression, we substitute the given number for the variable\nin the expression and then simplify the expression using the order of operations.\nEXAMPLE 9\nEvaluate\na.\nb.\nSolution\nRemember means times , so means times . 1.1 Algebraic Expressions 17\na.

Negative numbers are numbers less than .\nThe negative numbers are to the left of zero on the number line. See Figure 1.\nFigure 1 The number line shows the location of positive and negative\nnumbers.\nThe arrows on the ends of the number line indicate that the numbers keep going forever. There is no\nbiggest positive number, and there is no smallest negative number.\nIs zero a positive or a negative number? Numbers larger than zero are positive, and numbers smaller\nthan zero are negative. Zero is neither positive nor negative.\nConsider how numbers are ordered on the number line. Going from left to right, the numbers increase\nin value. Going from right to left, the numbers decrease in value. See Figure 2.\n25 26 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nFigure 2 The numbers on a number line increase in value going from left to\nright and decrease in value going from right to left.\nRemember that we use the notation:\na < b (read \u201ca is less than b\u201d) when a is to the left of b on the number line.\na > b (read \u201ca is greater than b\u201d) when a is to the right of b on the number line.\nNow we need to extend the number line which showed the whole numbers to include negative\nnumbers, too. The numbers marked by points in Figure 3 are called the integers. The integers are the\nnumbers\nFigure 3 All the marked numbers are called integers.\nEXAMPLE 1\nOrder each of the following pairs of numbers, using < or >: a) ___ b) ___ c) ___ d) ___\n.\nSolution\nIt may be helpful to refer to the number line shown.\na) 14 is to the right of 6 on the number line. ___ >\nb) \u22121 is to the left of 9 on the number line. ___\nc) \u22121 is to the right of \u22124 on the number line. ___\nd) 2 is to the right of \u221220 on the number line. ___ > 1.2 Integers 27\nTRY IT 1\nOrder each of the following pairs of numbers, using < or > a) ___ b) ___ c) ___ d) ___\n.\nShow answer\na) > b) < c) > d) >\nYou may have noticed that, on the number line, the negative numbers are a mirror image of the positive\nnumbers, with zero in the middle. Because the numbers 2 and are the same distance from zero, they\nare called opposites. The opposite of 2 is , and the opposite of is 2\nOpposite\nThe opposite of a number is the number that is the same distance from zero on the number line but on the\nopposite side of zero.\n(Figure 4) illustrates the definition.\nThe opposite of 3 is .\nFigure 4\nOpposite Notation\nmeans the opposite of the number a.\nThe notation is read as \u201cthe opposite of a.\u201d\nThe whole numbers and their opposites are called the integers. The integers are the numbers 28 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nIntegers\nThe whole numbers and their opposites are called the integers.\nThe integers are the numbers\nSimplify: Expressions with Absolute Value\nWe saw that numbers such as are opposites because they are the same distance from 0 on\nthe number line. They are both two units from 0. The distance between 0 and any number on the\nnumber line is called the absolute value of that number.\nAbsolute Value\nThe absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line.\nThe absolute value of a number n is written as .\nFor example,\n\u2022 units away from , so .\n\u2022 units away from , so .\nFigure 5 illustrates this idea.\nThe integers units away from .\nFigure 5\nThe absolute value of a number is never negative (because distance cannot be negative). The only\nnumber with absolute value equal to zero is the number zero itself, because the distance from on\nthe number line is zero units. 1.2 Integers 29\nProperty of Absolute Value\nfor all numbers\nAbsolute values are always greater than or equal to zero!\nMathematicians say it more precisely, \u201cabsolute values are always non-negative.\u201d Non-negative means\ngreater than or equal to zero.\nEXAMPLE 2\nSimplify: a) b) c) .\nSolution\nThe absolute value of a number is the distance between the number and zero.

When we use the order of operations,\nfirst we simplify inside the absolute value bars as much as possible, then we take the absolute value of\nthe resulting number. 1.2 Integers 31\nGrouping Symbols\nParentheses ( )\nBrackets [ ]\nBraces { }\nAbsolute value | |\nIn the next example, we simplify the expressions inside absolute value bars first, just like we do with\nparentheses.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSimplify: .\nSolution\nWork inside parentheses first: subtract 2 from 6.\nMultiply 3(4).\nSubtract inside the absolute value bars.\nTake the absolute value.\nSubtract.\nTRY IT 4\nSimplify: .\nShow answer\n16\nAdd Integers\nMost students are comfortable with the addition and subtraction facts for positive numbers. But doing\naddition or subtraction with both positive and negative numbers may be more challenging. 32 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nWe will use two colour counters to model addition and subtraction of negatives so that you can\nvisualize the procedures instead of memorizing the rules.\nWe let one colour (blue) represent positive. The other colour (red) will represent the negatives. If we\nhave one positive counter and one negative counter, the value of the pair is zero. They form a neutral\npair. The value of this neutral pair is zero.\nWe will use the counters to show how to add the four addition facts using the numbers and\n.\nThe first example adds 5 positives and 3 positives\u2014both positives.\nThe second example adds 5 negatives and 3 negatives\u2014both negatives.\nIn each case we got 8\u2014either 8 positives or 8 negatives.\nWhen the signs were the same, the counters were all the same color, and so we added them.\nSo what happens when the signs are different? Let\u2019s add and .\nWhen we use counters to model addition of positive and negative integers, it is easy to see whether\nthere are more positive or more negative counters. So we know whether the sum will be positive or\nnegative. 1.2 Integers 33\nEXAMPLE 5\nAdd: a) b) .\nSolution\na)\n\u22121 + 5\nThere are more positives, so the sum is positive. 4\nb)\n1 + (\u22125)\nThere are more negatives, so the sum is negative. \u22124\nTRY IT 5\nAdd: a) b) .\nShow answer\na) 2 b)\nNow that we have added small positive and negative integers with a model, we can visualize the model\nin our minds to simplify problems with any numbers.\nWhen you need to add numbers such as , you really don\u2019t want to have to count out 37\nblue counters and 53 red counters. With the model in your mind, can you visualize what you would do\nto solve the problem? 34 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nPicture 37 blue counters with 53 red counters lined up underneath. Since there would be more red\n(negative) counters than blue (positive) counters, the sum would be negative. How many more red\ncounters would there be? Because , there are 16 more red counters.\nTherefore, the sum of is .\nLet\u2019s try another one. We\u2019ll add . Again, imagine 74 red counters and 27 more red\ncounters, so we\u2019d have 101 red counters. This means the sum is .\nLet\u2019s look again at the results of adding the different combinations of and .\nAddition of Positive and Negative Integers\nWhen the signs are the same, the counters would be all the same color, so add them.\nWhen the signs are different, some of the counters would make neutral pairs, so subtract to see how many are\nleft.\nVisualize the model as you simplify the expressions in the following examples.\nEXAMPLE 6\nSimplify: a) b) .\nSolution\na. Since the signs are different, we subtract The answer will be negative because\nthere are more negatives than positives.\nb. Since the signs are the same, we add. The answer will be negative because there are only\nnegatives. 1.2 Integers 35\nTRY IT 6\nSimplify: a) b) .\nShow answer\na) b)\nThe techniques used up to now extend to more complicated problems, like the ones we\u2019ve seen before.\nRemember to follow the order of operations!\nEXAMPLE 7\nSimplify: .\nSolution\nSimplify inside the parentheses.\nMultiply.\nAdd left to right.\nTRY IT 7\nSimplify: .\nShow answer\n13\nSubtract Integers\nWe will continue to use counters to model the subtraction. Remember, the blue counters represent\npositive numbers and the red counters represent negative numbers.\nPerhaps when you were younger, you read as take away When you use counters, you\ncan think of subtraction the same way!\nWe will model the four subtraction facts using the numbers and . 36 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nThe first example, we subtract 3 positives from 5 positives and end up with 2 positives.\nIn the second example, we subtract 3 negatives from 5 negatives and end up with 2 negatives.\nEach example used counters of only one color, and the \u201ctake away\u201d model of subtraction was easy to\napply.\nWhat happens when we have to subtract one positive and one negative number? We\u2019ll need to use both\nwhite and red counters as well as some neutral pairs. Adding a neutral pair does not change the value. It\nis like changing quarters to nickels\u2014the value is the same, but it looks different.\n\u2022 To subtract , we restate it as take away 3.\nWe start with 5 negatives. We need to take away 3 positives, but we do not have any positives to take\naway.\nRemember, a neutral pair has value zero. If we add 0 to 5 its value is still 5. We add neutral pairs to the\n5 negatives until we get 3 positives to take away. 1.2 Integers 37\n\u22125 \u2212 3 means \u22125 take away 3.\nWe start with 5 negatives.\nWe now add the neutrals needed to get 3 positives.\nWe remove the 3 positives.\nWe are left with 8 negatives.\nThe difference of \u22125 and 3 is \u22128. \u22125 \u2212 3 = \u22128\nAnd now, the fourth case, . We start with 5 positives. We need to take away 3 negatives, but\nthere are no negatives to take away. So we add neutral pairs until we have 3 negatives to take away. 38 1. Operations with Real Numbers\n5 \u2212 (\u22123) means 5 take away \u22123.\nWe start with 5 positives.\nWe now add the needed neutrals pairs.\nWe remove the 3 negatives.\nWe are left with 8 positives.\nThe difference of 5 and \u22123 is 8. 5 \u2212 (\u22123) = 8\nEXAMPLE 8\nSubtract: a) b) .\nSolution\na)\n\u22123 \u2212 1\nTake 1 positive from the one added neutral pair.\n\u22124\nb)\n3 \u2212 (\u22121)\nTake 1 negative from the one added neutral pair.\n4 1.2 Integers 39\nTRY IT 8\nSubtract: a) b) .\nShow answer\na) b) 10\nHave you noticed that subtraction of signed numbers can be done by adding the opposite? In Example\n8, is the same as and is the same as . You will often see this idea,\nthe subtraction property, written as follows:\nSubtraction Property\nSubtracting a number is the same as adding its opposite.\nLook at these two examples.\n.\nOf course, when you have a subtraction problem that has only positive numbers, like , you just\ndo the subtraction. You already knew how to subtract long ago. But knowing that gives\nthe same answer as helps when you are subtracting negative numbers. Make sure that you\nunderstand how and give the same results!\nLook at what happens when we subtract a negative. 40 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nSubtracting a negative number is like adding a positive!\nYou will often see this written as .\nWhat happens when there are more than three integers? We just use the order of operations as usual.\nEXAMPLE 9\nSimplify: .\nSolution\nSimplify inside the parentheses first.\nSubtract left to right.\nSubtract.\nTRY IT 9\nSimplify: .\nShow answer\n3\nMultiply Integers\nSince multiplication is mathematical shorthand for repeated addition, our model can easily be applied\nto show multiplication of integers. Let\u2019s look at this concrete model to see what patterns we notice. We\nwill use the same examples that we used for addition and subtraction. Here, we will use the model just\nto help us discover the pattern.\nWe remember that means add a, b times. Here, we are using the model just to help us discover the\npattern. 1.2 Integers 41\nThe next two examples are more interesting.\nWhat does it mean to multiply 5 by It means subtract 5, 3 times. Looking at subtraction as \u201ctaking\naway,\u201d it means to take away 5, 3 times. But there is nothing to take away, so we start by adding neutral\npairs on the work space. Then we take away 5 three times. 42 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nIn summary:\nNotice that for multiplication of two signed numbers, when the:\n\u2022 signs are the same, the product is positive.\n\u2022 signs are different, the product is negative.\nWe\u2019ll put this all together in the chart below 1.2 Integers 43\nMultiplication of Signed Numbers\nFor multiplication of two signed numbers:\nSame signs Product Example\nTwo positives Positive\nTwo negatives Positive\nDifferent signs Product Example\nPositive \\cdot negative Negative\nNegative \\cdot positive Negative\nEXAMPLE 10\nMultiply: a) b) c) d) .\nSolution\na)\nMultiply, noting that the signs are different so the product is negative.\nb)\nMultiply, noting that the signs are the same so the product is positive.\nc)\nMultiply, with different signs.\nd)\nMultiply, with same signs.\nTRY IT 10\nMultiply: a) b) c) d) .\nShow answer\na) b) 28 c) d) 60 44 1.

Let\u2019s multiply a positive number and then a negative number by to see what we\nget.\nEach time we multiply a number by , we get its opposite!\nMultiplication by\nMultiplying a number by gives its opposite.\nEXAMPLE 11\nMultiply: a) b) .\nSolution\na)\nMultiply, noting that the signs are different so the product is negative.\nb)\nMultiply, noting that the signs are the same so the product is positive.\nTRY IT 11\nMultiply: a) b) .\nShow answer\na) b) 17 1.2 Integers 45\nDivide Integers\nWhat about division? Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. So, because\n. In words, this expression says that 15 can be divided into three groups of five each because\nadding five three times gives 15. Look at some examples of multiplying integers, to figure out the rules\nfor dividing integers.\nDivision follows the same rules as multiplication!\nFor division of two signed numbers, when the:\n\u2022 signs are the same, the quotient is positive.\n\u2022 signs are different, the quotient is negative.\nAnd remember that we can always check the answer of a division problem by multiplying.\nMultiplication and Division of Signed Numbers\nFor multiplication and division of two signed numbers:\n\u2022 If the signs are the same, the result is positive.\n\u2022 If the signs are different, the result is negative.\nSame signs Result\nTwo positives Positive\nTwo negatives Positive\nIf the signs are the same, the result is positive.\nDifferent signs Result\nPositive and negative Negative\nNegative and positive Negative\nIf the signs are different, the result is negative. 46 1.

We will\ndo two examples side-by-side. Look for a pattern!\nConvert to fractions.\nMultiply.\nConvert to decimals.\nNotice, in the first example, we multiplied two numbers that each had one digit after the decimal point\nand the product had two decimal places. In the second example, we multiplied a number with one\ndecimal place by a number with two decimal places and the product had three decimal places.\nWe multiply the numbers just as we do whole numbers, temporarily ignoring the decimal point. We\nthen count the number of decimal points in the factors and that sum tells us the number of decimal\nplaces in the product.\nThe rules for multiplying positive and negative numbers apply to decimals, too, of course!\nWhen multiplying two numbers,\n\u2022 if their signs are the same the product is positive.\n\u2022 if their signs are different the product is negative.\nWhen we multiply signed decimals, first we determine the sign of the product and then multiply as if\nthe numbers were both positive.

Move the decimal point to the right the same number of places as the number of zeros in the\npower of 10.\n2. Add zeros at the end of the number as needed.\nEXAMPLE 6\nMultiply 5.63 a) by 10 b) by 100 c) by 1,000.\nSolution\nBy looking at the number of zeros in the multiple of ten, we see the number of places we need to move the\ndecimal to the right.\na)\n5.63(10)\nThere is 1 zero in 10, so move the decimal point 1 place to the right.\nb)\n5.63(100)\nThere are 2 zeros in 100, so\nmove the decimal point 2\nplaces to the right.\nc)\n5.63(1,000)\nThere are 3 zeros in 1,000, so move the decimal point 3 places to the right.\nA zero must be added at the end. 86 1.

For example,\nSimilarly, 121 is the square of 11, because is 121.\nSquare of a Number\nIf then m is the square of n.\nComplete the following table to show the squares of the counting numbers 1 through 15.\nThe numbers in the second row are called perfect square numbers. It will be helpful to learn to\nrecognize the perfect square numbers.\nThe squares of the counting numbers are positive numbers. What about the squares of negative\nnumbers? We know that when the signs of two numbers are the same, their product is positive. So the\nsquare of any negative number is also positive.\n129 130 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nDid you notice that these squares are the same as the squares of the positive numbers?\nSometimes we will need to look at the relationship between numbers and their squares in reverse.\nBecause we say 100 is the square of 10. We also say that 10 is a square root of 100. A\nnumber whose square is is called a square root of m.\nSquare Root of a Number\nIf then n is a square root of m.\nNotice also, so is also a square root of 100. Therefore, both 10 and are\nsquare roots of 100.\nSo, every positive number has two square roots\u2014one positive and one negative. What if we only\nwanted the positive square root of a positive number? The radical sign, denotes the positive\nsquare root. The positive square root is called the principal square root. When we use the radical sign\nthat always means we want the principal square root.\nWe also use the radical sign for the square root of zero. Because Notice that zero has\nonly one square root.\nSquare Root Notation\nis read \u201cthe square root of m\u201d\nIf then for\nThe square root of m, is the positive number whose square is m.\nSince 10 is the principal square root of 100, we write You may want to complete the\nfollowing table to help you recognize square roots. 1.6 Roots and Radicals 131\nEXAMPLE 1\nSimplify: a) b)\nSolution\na)\nSince\nb)\nSince\nTRY IT 1\nSimplify: a) b)\nShow answer\na) 6 b) 13\nWe know that every positive number has two square roots and the radical sign indicates the positive\none.

Let\u2019s now extend our work to include higher\npowers and higher roots.\nLet\u2019s review some vocabulary first.\nThe terms \u2018squared\u2019 and \u2018cubed\u2019 come from the formulas for area of a square and volume of a cube.\nIt will be helpful to have a table of the powers of the integers from \u22125 to 5. See (Table 1).\nTable 1\nNotice the signs in the table. All powers of positive numbers are positive, of course. But when we have\na negative number, the even powers are positive and the odd powers are negative. We\u2019ll copy the row\nwith the powers of \u22122 to help you see this.\nWe will now extend the square root definition to higher roots.\nnth Root of a Number\n3\nJust like we use the word \u2018cubed\u2019 for b , we use the term \u2018cube root\u2019 for 134 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nWe can refer to (Table 1) to help find higher roots.\nCould we have an even root of a negative number? We know that the square root of a negative number\nis not a real number. The same is true for any even root. Even roots of negative numbers are not real\nnumbers. Odd roots of negative numbers are real numbers.\nProperties of\nWhen n is an even number and\n\u2022 then is a real number.\n\u2022 then is not a real number.\nWhen n is an odd number, is a real number for all values of a.\nWe will apply these properties in the next two examples.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSimplify: a) b) c)\nSolution\na)\nSince . 4\nb)\nSince 3\nc) 1.6 Roots and Radicals 135\nSince 2\nTRY IT 4\nSimplify: a) b) c)\nShow answer\na) 3 b) 4 c) 3\nIn this example be alert for the negative signs as well as even and odd powers.\nEXAMPLE 5\nSimplify: a) b) c)\nSolution\na)\nSince\nb)\nThink, .

While we\nprobably know that the what is the value of or In some situations a quick\nestimate is meaningful and in others it is convenient to have a decimal approximation.\nTo get a numerical estimate of a square root, we look for perfect square numbers closest to the\nradicand. To find an estimate of we see 11 is between perfect square numbers 9 and 16, closer to\n9. Its square root then will be between 3 and 4, but closer to 3.\nSimilarly, to estimate we see 91 is between perfect cube numbers 64 and 125. The cube root then\nwill be between 4 and 5.\nEXAMPLE 6\nEstimate each root between two consecutive whole numbers: a) b)\nSolution\na) Think of the perfect square numbers closest to 105. Make a small table of these perfect squares and their\nsquares roots. 1.6 Roots and Radicals 137\nLocate 105 between two consecutive\nperfect squares.\nis between their square roots.\nb) Similarly we locate 43 between two perfect cube numbers.\nLocate 43 between two consecutive\nperfect cubes.\nis between their cube roots.\nTRY IT 6\nEstimate each root between two consecutive whole numbers:\na) b)\nShow answer\na)\nb) 138 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nThere are mathematical methods to approximate square roots, but nowadays most people use a\ncalculator to find square roots. To find a square root you will use the key on your calculator. To\nfind a cube root, or any root with higher index, you will use the key.\nWhen you use these keys, you get an approximate value. It is an approximation, accurate to the number\nof digits shown on your calculator\u2019s display. The symbol for an approximation is and it is read\n\u2018approximately\u2019.\nSuppose your calculator has a 10 digit display. You would see that\nHow do we know these values are approximations and not the exact values? Look at what happens\nwhen we square them:\nTheir squares are close to 5, but are not exactly equal to 5. The fourth powers are close to 93, but not\nequal to 93.\nEXAMPLE 7\nRound to two decimal places: a) b) c)\nSolution\na)\nUse the calculator square root key. \u2026\nRound to two decimal places.\nb)\nUse the calculator key. \u2026\nRound to two decimal places.\nc) 1.6 Roots and Radicals 139\nUse the calculator key.\nRound to two decimal places.\nTRY IT 7\nRound to two decimal places:\na) b) c)\nShow answer\na) b)\nc)\nUse Radicals in Applications\nAs you progress through your college or university courses, you\u2019ll encounter formulas that include\nradicals in many disciplines.

What is the\ndifference between these types of numbers?\nWhat type of numbers would we get if we started with all the integers and then included all the\nfractions? The numbers we would have form the set of rational numbers. A rational number is a\nnumber that can be written as a ratio of two integers.\nRational Number\nA rational number is a number of the form , where p and q are integers and .\nA rational number can be written as the ratio of two integers.\nAll signed fractions, such as are rational numbers. Each numerator and each\ndenominator is an integer.\nAre integers rational numbers? To decide if an integer is a rational number, we try to write it as a ratio\nof two integers. Each integer can be written as a ratio of integers in many ways. For example, 3 is\nequivalent to\nAn easy way to write an integer as a ratio of integers is to write it as a fraction with denominator one.\n149 150 1. Operations with Real Numbers\nSince any integer can be written as the ratio of two integers, all integers are rational numbers!\nRemember that the counting numbers and the whole numbers are also integers, and so they, too, are\nrational.\nWhat about decimals? Are they rational? Let\u2019s look at a few to see if we can write each of them as the\nratio of two integers.\nWe\u2019ve already seen that integers are rational numbers. The integer could be written as the decimal\n. So, clearly, some decimals are rational.\nThink about the decimal 7.3. Can we write it as a ratio of two integers? Because 7.3 means , we can\nwrite it as an improper fraction, . So 7.3 is the ratio of the integers 73 and 10. It is a rational number.\nIn general, any decimal that ends after a number of digits (such as 7.3 or is a rational number.\nWe can use the place value of the last digit as the denominator when writing the decimal as a fraction.\nEXAMPLE 1\nWrite as the ratio of two integers: a) b) 7.31\nSolution\na)\nWrite it as a fraction with denominator 1.\nb)\nWrite it as a mixed number. Remember, 7 is the whole number and the decimal part, 0.31, indicates\nhundredths.\nConvert to an improper fraction.\nSo we see that and 7.31 are both rational numbers, since they can be written as the ratio of two integers.\nTRY IT 1\nWrite as the ratio of two integers: a) b) 3.57\nShow answer\na) b)\nLet\u2019s look at the decimal form of the numbers we know are rational. 1.7 The Real Numbers 151\nWe have seen that every integer is a rational number, since for any integer, a.

Operations with Real Numbers\nWe have seen that all counting numbers are whole numbers, all whole numbers are integers, and all\nintegers are rational numbers. The irrational numbers are numbers whose decimal form does not stop\nand does not repeat. When we put together the rational numbers and the irrational numbers, we get the\nset of real numbers.\nReal Number\nA real number is a number that is either rational or irrational.\nAll the numbers we use in algebra are real numbers.

The decimal number 0.4 is equivalent to , a proper fraction, so\n0.4 is located between 0 and 1. On a number line, divide the interval between 0 and 1 into 10 equal parts.\nNow label the parts 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0. We write 0 as 0.0 and 1 and 1.0, so that the\nnumbers are consistently in tenths. Finally, mark 0.4 on the number line. See Figure 4. 1.7 The Real Numbers 159\nFigure 4\nTRY IT 8\nLocate on the number line: 0.6\nShow answer\nEXAMPLE 9\nLocate on the number line.\nSolution\nThe decimal is equivalent to , so it is located between 0 and .

If you think of this as money, you know that ?0.40 (forty cents) is greater\nthan ?0.04 (four cents). So, 160 1. Operations with Real Numbers\n>\nAgain, we can use the number line to order numbers.\n\u2022 a < b \u201ca is less than b\u201d when a is to the left of b on the number line\n\u2022 a > b \u201ca is greater than b\u201d when a is to the right of b on the number line\nWhere are 0.04 and 0.40 located on the number line? See Figure 6.\nFigure 6\nWe see that 0.40 is to the right of 0.04 on the number line. This is another way to demonstrate that 0.40\n> 0.04\nHow does 0.31 compare to 0.308? This doesn\u2019t translate into money to make it easy to compare. But if\nwe convert 0.31 and 0.308 into fractions, we can tell which is larger.\n0.31 0.308\nConvert to fractions.\nWe need a common denominator to compare them.\nBecause 310 > 308, we know that > . Therefore, 0.31 > 0.308\nNotice what we did in converting 0.31 to a fraction\u2014we started with the fraction and ended with\nthe equivalent fraction . Converting back to a decimal gives 0.310. So 0.31 is equivalent to\n0.310. Writing zeros at the end of a decimal does not change its value!\nWe say 0.31 and 0.310 are equivalent decimals.\nEquivalent Decimals\nTwo decimals are equivalent if they convert to equivalent fractions.\nWe use equivalent decimals when we order decimals. 1.7 The Real Numbers 161\nThe steps we take to order decimals are summarized here.\nHOW TO: Order Decimals.\n1.

The purpose in solving an equation is to\nfind the value or values of the variable that make each side of the equation the same \u2013 so that we end up\nwith a true statement. Any value of the variable that makes the equation true is called a solution to the\nequation. It is the answer to the puzzle!\nSolution of an equation\nA solution of an equation is a value of a variable that makes a true statement when substituted into the\nequation.\nHOW TO: Determine whether a number is a solution to an equation\n1. Substitute the number in for the variable in the equation.\n2. Simplify the expressions on both sides of the equation.\n3. Determine whether the resulting equation is true (the left side is equal to the right side).\n\u25e6 If it is true, the number is a solution.\n\u25e6 If it is not true, the number is not a solution.\n169 170 2.

In this chapter we will focus on solving linear equations.\nLinear Equation\nA linear equation is a first degree equation in one variable that can be written as:\n, where a and b are real numbers and\nSolve Equations Using the Subtraction and Addition Properties of Equality\nLet us review all the properties that will help us to solve equations algebraically. The first one is the\nSubtraction Property of Equality. 2.1 Solve Linear Equations 171\nSubtraction Property of Equality\nFor any numbers a, b, and c,\nWhen you subtract the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have equality.\nLet\u2019s see how to use this property to solve an equation. Remember, the goal is to isolate the variable on\none side of the equation. And we check our solutions by substituting the value into the equation to\nmake sure we have a true statement.\nEXAMPLE 2\nSolve:\nSolution\nTo get y by itself, we will undo the addition of 37 by using the Subtraction Property of Equality.\nSubtract 37 from each side to \u2018undo\u2019 the addition.\nSimplify.\nCheck:\nSubstitute\nSince makes a true statement, we have the solution to this equation.\nTRY IT 2\nSolve: .\nShow answer\nWhat happens when an equation has a number subtracted from the variable, as in the equation 172 2. Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities\n? We use another property to solve equations when a number is subtracted from the\nvariable. We want to isolate the variable, so to \u2018undo\u2019 the subtraction we will add the number to both\nsides. We use the Addition Property of Equality.\nAddition Property of Equality\nFor any numbers a, b, and c,\nWhen you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality.\nIn Example 2, 37 was added to the y and so we subtracted 37 to \u2018undo\u2019 the addition. In Example 3, we\nwill need to \u2018undo\u2019 subtraction by using the Addition Property of Equality.\nEXAMPLE 3\nSolve:\nSolution\nAdd 28 to each side to \u2018undo\u2019 the subtraction.\nSimplify.\nCheck:\nSubstitute\nThe solution to is\nTRY IT 3\nSolve:\nShow answer 2.1 Solve Linear Equations 173\nEXAMPLE 4\nSolve:\nSolution\nUse the Addition Property of Equality.\nFind the LCD to add the fractions on the right.\nSimplify.\nCheck:\nSubstitute\nSubtract.\nSimplify.\nThe solution to is\nTRY IT 4\nSolve:\nShow answer\nThe next example will be an equation with decimals. 174 2.

We were able to isolate the variable by adding or subtracting the constant term on the\nside of the equation with the variable. Now we will see how to solve equations that have a variable\nmultiplied by a constant and so will require division to isolate the variable.To solve those kind of\nequations we will use the Division Property of Equality.\nThe Division Property of Equality\nFor any numbers a, b, and c, and ,\nWhen you divide both sides of an equation by any non-zero number, you still have equality. 2.1 Solve Linear Equations 175\nThe goal in solving an equation is to \u2018undo\u2019 the operation on the variable. In the next example, the\nvariable is multiplied by 5, so we will divide both sides by 5 to \u2018undo\u2019 the multiplication.\nEXAMPLE 6\nSolve:\nSolution\nTo isolate , \u201cundo\u201d the multiplication by 5.\nDivide to \u2018undo\u2019 the multiplication.\nSimplify.\nCheck:\nSubstitute for\nSince this is a true statement,\nis the solution to .\nTRY IT 6\nSolve:\nShow answer\nConsider the equation . We want to know what number divided by 4 gives 3. So to \u201cundo\u201d the\ndivision, we will need to multiply by 4. The Multiplication Property of Equality will allow us to do\nthis. This property says that if we start with two equal quantities and multiply both by the same\nnumber, the results are equal. 176 2. Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities\nThe Multiplication Property of Equality\nFor any numbers a, b, and c,\nIf you multiply both sides of an equation by the same number, you still have equality.\nEXAMPLE 7\nSolve:\nSolution\nHere is divided by .

While this would work, most people would find multiplying by the\nreciprocal easier.\nCheck:\nSubstitute .\nTRY IT 8\nSolve:\nShow answer\nNow we have covered all four properties of equality\u2014subtraction, addition, division, and\nmultiplication. We\u2019ll list them all together here for easy reference. 178 2. Solving Linear Equations and Inequalities\nProperties of Equality\nWhen you add, subtract, multiply, or divide the same quantity from both sides of an equation, you still have\nequality.\nNow we will use those properties to solve equations in which the variable terms, or constant terms, or\nboth are on both sides of the equation.\nSolve Equations with Variables and Constants on Both Sides\nOur strategy will involve choosing one side of the equation to be the \u201cvariable side\u201d, and the other side\nof the equation to be the \u201cconstant side.\u201d Then, we will use the Subtraction and Addition Properties of\nEquality to get all the variable terms together on one side of the equation and the constant terms\ntogether on the other side.\nBy doing this, we will transform the equation that began with variables and constants on both sides into\nthe form We already know how to solve equations of this form by using the Division or\nMultiplication Properties of Equality.\nEXAMPLE 9\nSolve:\nSolution\nIn this equation, the variable is found only on the left side. It makes sense to call the left side the \u201cvariable\u201d\nside. Therefore, the right side will be the \u201cconstant\u201d side. We will write the labels above the equation to help\nus remember what goes where. Since the left side is the \u201cvariable\u201d side, the 9 is out of place. It is subtracted\nfrom the , so to \u201cundo\u201d subtraction, add 9 to both sides. Remember, whatever you do to the left, you must\ndo to the right. 2.1 Solve Linear Equations 179\nAdd 9 to both sides.\nSimplify. The variables are now on one side and the constants on\nthe other. We continue from here as we did earlier.\nDivide both sides by 8.\nSimplify.\nCheck.\nLet .\nTRY IT 9\nSolve:\nShow answer\nWhat if there are variables on both sides of the equation? For equations like this, begin as we did\nabove\u2014choose a \u201cvariable\u201d side and a \u201cconstant\u201d side, and then use the subtraction and addition\nproperties of equality to collect all variables on one side and all constants on the other side.\nEXAMPLE 10\nSolve:\nSolution\nThe only constant is on the left and the \u2019s are on both sides. Let\u2019s leave the constant on the left and get the\nvariables to the right. 180 2.

Choose which side will be the \u201cvariable\u201d side\u2014the other side will be the \u201cconstant\u201d side.\n2. Collect the variable terms to the \u201cvariable\u201d side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction\nProperty of Equality.\n3. Collect all the constants to the other side of the equation, using the Addition or Subtraction\nProperty of Equality.\n4. Make the coefficient of the variable equal 1, using the Multiplication or Division Property of\nEquality.\n5. Check the solution by substituting it into the original equation.\nIn Step 1, a helpful approach is to make the \u201cvariable\u201d side the side that has the variable with the larger\ncoefficient. This usually makes the arithmetic easier.\nEXAMPLE 12\nSolve:\nSolution\nIn the first step, choose the variable side by comparing the coefficients of the variables on each side.\nSince > , make the right side the \u201cvariable\u201d side and the left side the \u201cconstant\u201d side. 2.1 Solve Linear Equations 183\nSubtract from both sides to remove the variable term from the left.\nCombine like terms.\nSubtract from both sides to remove the constant from the right.\nSimplify.\nDivide both sides by to make the coefficient of .\nSimplify.\nCheck:\nLet .\nTRY IT 12\nSolve:\nShow answer\nIn the last example, we could have made the left side the \u201cvariable\u201d side, but it would have led to a\nnegative coefficient on the variable term.

To\nbegin, that question is asked in English (or the language of the person asking) and not in math symbols.\nBecause of this, it is an important skill to be able to translate an everyday situation into algebraic\nlanguage.\nWe will start by restating the problem in just one sentence, assign a variable, and then translate the\nsentence into an equation to solve. When assigning a variable, choose a letter that reminds you of what\nyou are looking for. For example, you might use q for the number of quarters if you were solving a\nproblem about coins.\nEXAMPLE 5\nHow to Translate and Solve Applications 2.3 Use a Problem Solving Strategy 211\nThe Alec family recycled newspapers for two months.

It is important to be familiar with formulas and be able to manipulate them easily.\nTo solve a formula for a specific variable means to isolate that variable on one side of the equals sign\nwith a coefficient of 1. All other variables and constants are on the other side of the equals sign. To see\nhow to solve a formula for a specific variable, we will start with the distance, rate and time formula.\nEXAMPLE 1\nSolve the formula for :\na. when and\nb. in general\nSolution\nWe will write the solutions side-by-side to demonstrate that solving a formula in general uses the same steps\nas when we have numbers to substitute.\n229 230 2.

Rate is an equivalent word for \u201cspeed.\u201d The basic idea of rate may\nalready familiar to you. Do you know what distance you travel if you drive at a steady rate of 60 miles\nper hour for 2 hours? (This might happen if you use your car\u2019s cruise control while driving on the\nhighway.) If you said 120 miles, you already know how to use this formula!\nDistance, Rate, and Time\nFor an object moving at a uniform (constant) rate, the distance traveled, the elapsed time, and the rate are\nrelated by the formula:\nWe will use the Strategy for Solving Applications that we used earlier in this chapter.

In this chapter, we will study the rectangular coordinate\nsystem, which is the basis for most graphs. We will look at linear graphs, slopes of lines, equations of\nlines, and linear inequalities.\n273  3.1 Use the Rectangular Coordinate System\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section it is expected that you will be able to:\n\u2022 Plot points in a rectangular coordinate system\n\u2022 Verify solutions to an equation in two variables\n\u2022 Complete a table of solutions to a linear equation\n\u2022 Find solutions to a linear equation in two variables\nPlot Points on a Rectangular Coordinate System\nJust like maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a\nrelationship between two variables in a rectangular coordinate system. The rectangular coordinate\nsystem is also called the xy-plane or the \u2018coordinate plane.\u2019\nThe horizontal number line is called the x-axis. The vertical number line is called the y-axis. The x-axis\nand the y-axis together form the rectangular coordinate system. These axes divide a plane into four\nregions, called quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper\nright and proceeding counterclockwise. See (Figure 1).\n\u2018Quadrant\u2019 has the root \u2018quad,\u2019 which means \u2018four.\u2019\n275 276 3. Equations and their Graphs\nFigure .1\nIn the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by an ordered pair. The first number in\nthe ordered pair is the x-coordinate of the point, and the second number is the y-coordinate of the\npoint.\nOrdered pair\nAn ordered pair, , gives the coordinates of a point in a rectangular coordinate system.\nThe first number is the x-coordinate.\nThe second number is the y-coordinate.\nThe phrase \u2018ordered pair\u2019 means the order is important. What is the ordered pair of the point where the\naxes cross? At that point both coordinates are zero, so its ordered pair is . The point has a\nspecial name. It is called the origin.\nThe origin\nThe point is called the origin. It is the point where the x-axis and y-axis intersect. 3.1 Use the Rectangular Coordinate System 277\nWe use the coordinates to locate a point on the xy-plane. Let\u2019s plot the point as an example. First,\nlocate 1 on the x-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through . Then, locate 3 on the y-axis and\nsketch a horizontal line through . Now, find the point where these two lines meet\u2014that is the\npoint with coordinates .\nFigure .2\nNotice that the vertical line through and the horizontal line through are not part of the\ngraph. We just used them to help us locate the point .\nEXAMPLE 1\nPlot each point in the rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located:\nA B C D E .\nSolution\nThe first number of the coordinate pair is the x-coordinate, and the second number is the y-coordinate.\nA. Since , the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since , the point is above the\nx-axis. The point is in Quadrant II.\nB. Since , the point is to the left of the y-axis. Also, since , the point is below the\nx-axis. The point is in Quadrant III.\nC. Since , the point is to the right of the y-axis.

You may have noticed some patterns as you graphed\nthe points in the previous example. 3.1 Use the Rectangular Coordinate System 279\nFor the point in (Figure 2) in Quadrant IV, what do you notice about the signs of the coordinates? What\nabout the signs of the coordinates of points in the third quadrant? The second quadrant? The first\nquadrant?\nCan you tell just by looking at the coordinates in which quadrant the point is located? In which\nquadrant is located?\nQuadrants\nWe can summarize sign patterns of the quadrants in this way.\nWhat if one coordinate is zero as shown in (Figure 3)? Where is the point located? Where is the\npoint located? 280 3. Equations and their Graphs\nFigure .3\nThe point is on the y-axis and the point is on the x-axis.\nPoints on the axes\nPoints with a y-coordinate equal to 0 are on the x-axis, and have coordinates .\nPoints with an x-coordinate equal to 0 are on the y-axis, and have coordinates .\nEXAMPLE 2\nPlot each point:A B C D E .\nSolution\nA. Since , the point whose coordinates are is on the y-axis.\nB. Since , the point whose coordinates are is on the x-axis.\nC. Since , the point whose coordinates are is on the x-axis.\nD.

To identify the x-coordinate of a point on a graph, read the number on the\nx-axis directly above or below the point. To identify the y-coordinate of a point, read the number on the\ny-axis directly to the left or right of the point. Remember, when you write the ordered pair use the\ncorrect order, . 282 3. Equations and their Graphs\nEXAMPLE 3\nName the ordered pair of each point shown in the rectangular coordinate system.\nSolution\nPoint A is above on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is .\n\u2022 The point is to the left of 3 on the y-axis, so the y-coordinate of the point is 3.\n\u2022 The coordinates of the point are .\nPoint B is below on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is .\n\u2022 The point is to the left of on the y-axis, so the y-coordinate of the point is .\n\u2022 The coordinates of the point are .\nPoint C is above 2 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is 2.\n\u2022 The point is to the right of 4 on the y-axis, so the y-coordinate of the point is 4.\n\u2022 The coordinates of the point are .\nPoint D is below 4 on the x-axis, so the x-coordinate of the point is 4.\n\u2022 The point is to the right of on the y-axis, so the y-coordinate of the point is\n\u2022 The coordinates of the point are .\nPoint E is on the y-axis at .

In almost every\ncase, when you solved the equation you got exactly one solution. The process of solving an equation\nended with a statement like . (Then, you checked the solution by substituting back into the\nequation.)\nHere\u2019s an example of an equation in one variable, and its one solution.\nBut equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two variables may be of the form\n. Equations of this form are called linear equations in two variables. 284 3. Equations and their Graphs\nLinear equation\nAn equation of the form , where and are not both zero, is called a linear equation in\ntwo variables.\nNotice the word line in linear. Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, and .\nThe equation is also a linear equation. But it does not appear to be in the form\n. We can use the Addition Property of Equality and rewrite it in form.\nAdd to both sides.\nSimplify.\nUse the Commutative Property to put it in form.\nBy rewriting as , we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two\nvariables because it is of the form . When an equation is in the form ,\nwe say it is in standard form.\nStandard Form of Linear Equation\nA linear equation is in standard form when it is written .\nMost people prefer to have , , and be integers and when writing a linear equation in\nstandard form, although it is not strictly necessary.\nLinear equations have infinitely many solutions. For every number that is substituted for there is a\ncorresponding value. This pair of values is a solution to the linear equation and is represented by the\nordered pair . When we substitute these values of and into the equation, the result is a true\nstatement, because the value on the left side is equal to the value on the right side. 3.1 Use the Rectangular Coordinate System 285\nSolution of a Linear Equation in Two Variables\nAn ordered pair is a solution of the linear equation , if the equation is a true\nstatement when the x\u2013 and y-values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation.\nEXAMPLE 4\nDetermine which ordered pairs are solutions to the equation .\nA (\\left(0,2\\right)\\) B C\nSolution\nSubstitute the x- and y-values from each ordered pair into the equation and determine if the result is a true\nstatement.\nTRY IT 4\nWhich of the following ordered pairs are solutions to ?\nA B C\nShow answer\nA, C 286 3.

But how do you find the ordered pairs if they are not\ngiven? It\u2019s easier than you might think\u2014you can just pick a value for and then solve the equation for\n. Or, pick a value for and then solve for .\nWe\u2019ll start by looking at the solutions to the equation that we found in (Example 5).

Find three points whose coordinates are solutions to the equation. Organize them in a table.\n2. Plot the points in a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do not,\ncarefully check your work.\n3. Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends\nof the line.\nIt is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you\nonly plot two points and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line but it will not represent the\nsolutions to the equation. It will be the wrong line.\nIf you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is\nwrong and you need to check your work. Look at the difference between part (a) and part (b) in (Figure\n4).\nFigure .4 310 3. Equations and their Graphs\nLet\u2019s do another example.

Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter. What determines whether\na line tilts up or down or if it is steep or flat?\nIn mathematics, the \u2018tilt\u2019 of a line is called the slope of the line. The concept of slope has many\napplications in the real world. The pitch of a roof, grade of a highway, and a ramp for a wheelchair are\nsome examples where you literally see slopes. And when you ride a bicycle, you feel the slope as you\npump uphill or coast downhill.\nIn this section, we will explore the concept of slope.\nThe slope of a line is the ratio of the rise to the run. In mathematics, it is always referred to with the\nletter .\nSlope of a line\nThe slope of a line of a line is .\nThe rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change between two points on the\nline.\n363 364 3. Equations and their Graphs\nPositive and negative slopes\nWe \u2018read\u2019 a line from left to right just like we read words in English. As you read from left to right, the line\nis going up; it has positive slope. The line is going down; it has negative slope.\nUse to Find the Slope of a Line from its Graph\nWe\u2019ll look at some graphs on the -coordinate plane and see how to find their slopes.\nTo find the slope, we must count out the rise and the run. But where do we start?\nWe locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers. We then start with the point on the left\nand sketch a right triangle, so we can count the rise and run.\nEXAMPLE 1\nHow to Use to Find the Slope of a Line from its Graph\nFind the slope of the line shown.\nSolution 3.4 Understand Slope of a Line \u2013 optional 365 366 3.

The run is 3.\nUse the slope formula.\nSubstitute the values of the rise and run.\nSimplify.\nThe slope of the line is .\nSo increases by 3 units as decreases by 2 units.\nWhat if we used the points and to find the slope of the line? 3.4 Understand Slope of a Line \u2013 optional 369\nThe rise would be and the run would be 9. Then , and that simplifies to .\nRemember, it does not matter which points you use\u2014the slope of the line is always the same.\nTRY IT 2\nFind the slope of the line shown.\nShow answer\nIn the last two examples, the lines had y-intercepts with integer values, so it was convenient to use the\ny-intercept as one of the points to find the slope. In the next example, the y-intercept is a fraction.\nInstead of using that point, we\u2019ll look for two other points whose coordinates are integers. This will\nmake the slope calculations easier. 370 3. Equations and their Graphs\nEXAMPLE 3\nFind the slope of the line shown.\nSolution 3.4 Understand Slope of a Line \u2013 optional 371\nLocate two points on the graph whose coordinates are integers. and\nWhich point is on the left?\nStarting at , sketch a right triangle to .\nCount the rise. The rise is 3.\nCount the run. The run is 5.\nUse the slope formula.\nSubstitute the values of the rise and run.\nThe slope of the line is .\nThis means that increases 5 units as increases 3 units.\nWhen we used geoboards to introduce the concept of slope, we said that we would always start with the point\non the left and count the rise and the run to get to the point on the right. That way the run was always positive\nand the rise determined whether the slope was positive or negative.\nWhat would happen if we started with the point on the right?\nLet\u2019s use the points and again, but now we\u2019ll start at . 372 3. Equations and their Graphs\nCount the rise. The rise is .\nCount the run. It goes from right to left, so it is negative.

Their equations had just one\nvariable.\nSo how do we find the slope of the horizontal line ? One approach would be to graph the\nhorizontal line, find two points on it, and count the rise and the run. Let\u2019s see what happens when we\ndo this. 374 3. Equations and their Graphs\nWhat is the rise? The rise is .\nCount the run. The run is .\nWhat is the slope?\nThe slope of the horizontal line is .\nAll horizontal lines have slope 0. When the y-coordinates are the same, the rise is 0.\nSlope of a horizontal line\nThe slope of a horizontal line, , is 0.\nThe floor of your room is horizontal. Its slope is 0. If you carefully placed a ball on the floor, it would\nnot roll away.\nNow, we\u2019ll consider a vertical line, the line. 3.4 Understand Slope of a Line \u2013 optional 375\nWhat is the rise? The rise is .\nCount the run. The run is .\nWhat is the slope?\nBut we can\u2019t divide by 0. Division by 0 is not defined. So we say that the slope of the vertical line\nis undefined.\nThe slope of any vertical line is undefined.

We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the\nrun, but as we\u2019ll see, there is a way to find the slope without graphing. Before we get to it, we need to\nintroduce some algebraic notation.\nWe have seen that an ordered pair gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with\nslopes, we use two points. How can the same symbol be used to represent two different points?\nMathematicians use subscripts to distinguish the points.\nThe use of subscripts in math is very much like the use of last name initials in elementary school.\nMaybe you remember Laura C. and Laura M. in your third grade class?\nWe will use to identify the first point and to identify the second point.\nIf we had more than two points, we could use , , and so on. 3.4 Understand Slope of a Line \u2013 optional 377\nLet\u2019s see how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the\nslope of the line between the points and .\nSince we have two points, we will use subscript notation, .\nOn the graph, we counted the rise of 3 and the run of 5.\nNotice that the rise of 3 can be found by subtracting the y-coordinates 6 and 3.\nAnd the run of 5 can be found by subtracting the x-coordinates 7 and 2.\nWe know . So .\nWe rewrite the rise and run by putting in the coordinates .\nBut 6 is , the y-coordinate of the second point and 3 is , the y-coordinate of the first point.\nSo we can rewrite the slope using subscript notation.\nAlso, 7 is , the x-coordinate of the second point and 2 is , the x-coordinate of the first point.\nSo, again, we rewrite the slope using subscript notation.\nWe\u2019ve shown that is really another version of . We can use this formula to\nfind the slope of a line when we have two points on the line. 378 3.

We will use this method\nwhen we know one point and the slope of the line. We will start by plotting the point and then use the\ndefinition of slope to draw the graph of the line.\nEXAMPLE 7\nHow To Graph a Line Given a Point and The Slope\nGraph the line passing through the point whose slope is .\nSolution 382 3.

See (Figure).\nMethods to graph lines 416 3. Equations and their Graphs\nChoose the Most Convenient Method to Graph a Line\nNow that we have seen several methods we can use to graph lines, how do we know which method to\nuse for a given equation?\nWhile we could plot points, use the slope\u2013intercept form, or find the intercepts for any equation, if we\nrecognize the most convenient way to graph a certain type of equation, our work will be easier.\nGenerally, plotting points is not the most efficient way to graph a line. We saw better methods in\nsections 4.3, 4.4, and earlier in this section. Let\u2019s look for some patterns to help determine the most\nconvenient method to graph a line.\nHere are six equations we graphed in this chapter, and the method we used to graph each of them.\nEquations #1 and #2 each have just one variable. Remember, in equations of this form the value of that\none variable is constant; it does not depend on the value of the other variable. Equations of this form\nhave graphs that are vertical or horizontal lines.\nIn equations #3 and #4, both and are on the same side of the equation. These two equations are of\nthe form . We substituted to find the x-intercept and to find the\ny-intercept, and then found a third point by choosing another value for or .\nEquations #5 and #6 are written in slope\u2013intercept form. After identifying the slope and y-intercept\nfrom the equation we used them to graph the line.\nThis leads to the following strategy.\nStrategy for choosing the most convenient method to graph a line\nConsider the form of the equation.\n\u2022 If it only has one variable, it is a vertical or horizontal line.\n\u25e6 is a vertical line passing through the x-axis at .\n\u25e6 is a horizontal line passing through the y-axis at .\n\u2022 If is isolated on one side of the equation, in the form , graph by using the slope\nand y-intercept. 3.5 Use the Slope\u2013Intercept Form of an Equation of a Line -optional 417\n\u25e6 Identify the slope and y-intercept and then graph.\n\u2022 If the equation is of the form , find the intercepts.\n\u25e6 Find the x\u2013 and y-intercepts, a third point, and then graph.\nEXAMPLE 9\nDetermine the most convenient method to graph each line.\na) b) c) d) .\nSolution\na)\nThis equation has only one variable, .

Equations and their Graphs\nUsually when a linear equation models a real-world situation, different letters are used for the variables,\ninstead of x and y. The variable names remind us of what quantities are being measured.\nEXAMPLE 10\nThe equation is used to convert temperatures, , on the Celsius scale to temperatures, ,\non the Fahrenheit scale.\na) Find the Fahrenheit temperature for a Celsius temperature of 0.\nb) Find the Fahrenheit temperature for a Celsius temperature of 20.\nc) Interpret the slope and F-intercept of the equation.\nd) Graph the equation.\nSolution\na)\nFind the Fahrenheit temperature for a Celsius temperature of 0.\nFind when .\nSimplify.\nb)\nFind the Fahrenheit temperature for a Celsius temperature of 20.\nFind when .\nSimplify.\nSimplify.\nc) Interpret the slope and F-intercept of the equation.\nEven though this equation uses and , it is still in slope\u2013intercept form.\nThe slope, , means that the temperature Fahrenheit (F) increases 9 degrees when the temperature Celsius (C)\nincreases 5 degrees.\nThe F-intercept means that when the temperature is 0\u00b0 on the Celsius scale, it is 32\u00b0 on the Fahrenheit scale.\nd) Graph the equation.\nWe\u2019ll need to use a larger scale than our usual. Start at the F-intercept then count out the rise of 9 and\nthe run of 5 to get a second point.

Equations and their Graphs\nd)\nThe cost of running some types business has two components\u2014a fixed cost and a variable cost. The\nfixed cost is always the same regardless of how many units are produced. This is the cost of rent,\ninsurance, equipment, advertising, and other items that must be paid regularly. The variable cost\ndepends on the number of units produced. It is for the material and labor needed to produce each item.\nEXAMPLE 11\nStella has a home business selling gourmet pizzas.

The C-intercept means that when the number of miles driven is 0, the\nweekly cost is $60\n4. ?\nUse Slopes to Identify Parallel Lines\nThe slope of a line indicates how steep the line is and whether it rises or falls as we read it from left to\nright. Two lines that have the same slope are called parallel lines. Parallel lines never intersect. 3.5 Use the Slope\u2013Intercept Form of an Equation of a Line -optional 423\nWe say this more formally in terms of the rectangular coordinate system. Two lines that have the same\nslope and different y-intercepts are called parallel lines. See (Figure).\nVerify that both lines have the same slope, , and different y-intercepts.\nWhat about vertical lines? The slope of a vertical line is undefined, so vertical lines don\u2019t fit in the\ndefinition above. We say that vertical lines that have different x-intercepts are parallel. See (Figure).\nVertical lines with different x-intercepts are parallel. 424 3. Equations and their Graphs\nParallel lines\nParallel lines are lines in the same plane that do not intersect.\n\u2022 Parallel lines have the same slope and different y-intercepts.\n\u2022 If and are the slopes of two parallel lines then .\n\u2022 Parallel vertical lines have different x-intercepts.\nLet\u2019s graph the equations and on the same grid.

What is the y-intercept of each line?\nThe slopes of the lines are the same and the y-intercept of each line is different.

Now we will work with systems of\nlinear equations, two or more linear equations grouped together, witch is known as a system of linear\nequations.\nSystem of Linear Equations\nWhen two or more linear equations are grouped together, they form a system of linear equations.\nWe will focus our work here on systems of two linear equations in two unknowns. Later, you may solve\nlarger systems of equations.\nAn example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the two\nequations are grouped together to form a system of equations.\nA linear equation in two variables, like 2x + y = 7, has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a\nline. Remember, every point on the line is a solution to the equation and every solution to the equation\nis a point on the line.\nTo solve a system of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions\n443 444 4. Systems of Equations\nto both equations. In other words, we are looking for the ordered pairs (x, y) that make both equations\ntrue. These are called the solutions to a system of equations.\nSolutions of a System of Equations\nSolutions of a system of equations are the values of the variables that make all the equations true. A solution\nof a system of two linear equations is represented by an ordered pair (x, y).\nTo determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of\nthe variables into each equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the\nsystem.\nLet\u2019s consider the system below:\nIs the ordered pair a solution?\nThe ordered pair (2, \u22121) made both equations true. Therefore (2, \u22121) is a solution to this system.\nLet\u2019s try another ordered pair. Is the ordered pair (3, 2) a solution?\nThe ordered pair (3, 2) made one equation true, but it made the other equation false. Since it is not a\nsolution to both equations, it is not a solution to this system. 4.1 Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing 445\nEXAMPLE 1\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:\na) b)\nSolution\na)\n(\u22122, \u22121) does not make both equations true.

Systems of Equations\nIn this chapter we will use three methods to solve a system of linear equations. The first method we\u2019ll\nuse is graphing.\nThe graph of a linear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a\nsystem of two equations, we will graph two lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to\neach equation. And, by finding what the lines have in common, we\u2019ll find the solution to the system.\nMost linear equations in one variable have one solution, but we saw that some equations, called\ncontradictions, have no solutions and for other equations, called identities, all numbers are solutions.\nSimilarly, when we solve a system of two linear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the\nsame plane, there are three possible cases, as shown in (Figure 1):\nFigure 1\nFor the first example of solving a system of linear equations in this section and in the next two sections,\nwe will solve the same system of two linear equations. But we\u2019ll use a different method in each section.\nAfter seeing the third method, you\u2019ll decide which method was the most convenient way to solve this\nsystem.\nEXAMPLE 2\nHow to Solve a System of Linear Equations by Graphing\nSolve the system by graphing:\nSolution 4.1 Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing 447 448 4.

We say the\ntwo lines are coincident. Coincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.\nCoincident Lines\nCoincident lines have the same slope and same y-intercept.\nDetermine the Number of Solutions of a Linear System\nThere will be times when we will want to know how many solutions there will be to a system of linear\nequations, but we might not actually have to find the solution. It will be helpful to determine this\nwithout graphing.\nWe have seen that two lines in the same plane must either intersect or are parallel. The systems of\nequations in Example 2 through Example 6 all had two intersecting lines. Each system had one\nsolution.\nA system with parallel lines, like Example 7, has no solution. What happened in Example 8? The\nequations have coincident lines, and so the system had infinitely many solutions.\nWe\u2019ll organize these results in (Table 1) below:\nTable 1 462 4. Systems of Equations\nParallel lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. So, if we write both equations in a system\nof linear equations in slope\u2013intercept form, we can see how many solutions there will be without\ngraphing! Look at the system we solved in Example 7.\nThe two lines have the same slope but different y-intercepts. They are parallel lines.\n(Table 2) shows how to determine the number of solutions of a linear system by looking at the slopes\nand intercepts.\nTable 2\nLet\u2019s take one more look at our equations in (Example 7) that gave us parallel lines.\nWhen both lines were in slope-intercept form we had:\nDo you recognize that it is impossible to have a single ordered pair that is a solution to both of\nthose equations?\nWe call a system of equations like this an inconsistent system. It has no solution.\nA system of equations that has at least one solution is called a consistent system.\nConsistent and Inconsistent Systems\nA consistent system of equations is a system of equations with at least one solution.\nAn inconsistent system of equations is a system of equations with no solution. 4.1 Solve Systems of Equations by Graphing 463\nWe also categorize the equations in a system of equations by calling the equations independent or\ndependent. If two equations are independent equations, they each have their own set of solutions.\nIntersecting lines and parallel lines are independent.\nIf two equations are dependent, all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other\nequation. When we graph two dependent equations, we get coincident lines.\nIndependent and Dependent Equations\nTwo equations are independent if they have different solutions.\nTwo equations are dependent if all the solutions of one equation are also solutions of the other equation.\nLet\u2019s sum this up by looking at the graphs of the three types of systems. See (Figure 3) and (Table 3).\nFigure 3\nTable 3\nEXAMPLE 9\nWithout graphing, determine the number of solutions and then classify the system of equations:\nSolution 464 4.

However, there are many cases where solving a system by graphing is inconvenient or\nimprecise.

Graphing works well\nwhen the variable coefficients are small and the solution has integer values. Substitution works well\nwhen we can easily solve one equation for one of the variables and not have too many fractions in the\nresulting expression.\nThe third method of solving systems of linear equations is called the Elimination Method. When we\nsolved a system by substitution, we started with two equations and two variables and reduced it to one\nequation with one variable. This is what we\u2019ll do with the elimination method, too, but we\u2019ll have a\ndifferent way to get there.\nSolve a System of Equations by Elimination\nThe Elimination Method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of\nEquality says that when you add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality.\nWe will extend the Addition Property of Equality to say that when you add equal quantities to both\nsides of an equation, the results are equal.\nFor any expressions a, b, c, and d,\nTo solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we\ndecide which variable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients\nof one variable be opposites, so that we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable.\nNotice how that works when we add these two equations together:\n497 498 4. Systems of Equations\nThe y\u2019s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable.\nLet\u2019s try another one:\nThis time we don\u2019t see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations.\nBut if we multiply the first equation by \u22122, we will make the coefficients of x opposites. We must\nmultiply every term on both sides of the equation by \u22122.\nNow we see that the coefficients of the x terms are opposites, so x will be eliminated when we add\nthese two equations.\nAdd the equations yourself\u2014the result should be \u22123y = \u22126. And that looks easy to solve, doesn\u2019t it?\nHere is what it would look like.\nWe\u2019ll do one more:\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that we can get the coefficients of one variable to be opposites by multiplying one of\nthe equations by a constant, unless we use fractions. So instead, we\u2019ll have to multiply both equations\nby a constant.\nWe can make the coefficients of x be opposites if we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by\n\u22124, so we get 12x and \u221212x. 4.3 Solve Systems of Equations by Elimination 499\nThis gives us these two new equations:\nWhen we add these equations,\nthe x\u2019s are eliminated and we just have \u221229y = 58.\nOnce we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of\nthe original equations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to\nmake sure it is a solution to both of the original equations.\nNow we\u2019ll see how to use elimination to solve the same system of equations we solved by graphing and\nby substitution.\nEXAMPLE 1\nHow to Solve a System of Equations by Elimination\nSolve the system by elimination.\nSolution 500 4.

Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable.\n4. Solve for the remaining variable.\n5. Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations. Then solve for the other\nvariable. 4.3 Solve Systems of Equations by Elimination 501\n6. Write the solution as an ordered pair.\n7. Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations.\nFirst we\u2019ll do an example where we can eliminate one variable right away.\nEXAMPLE 2\nSolve the system by elimination.\nSolution\nBoth equations are in standard form.\nThe coefficients of y are already opposites.\nAdd the two equations to eliminate y.\nThe resulting equation has only 1 variable, x.\nSolve for x, the remaining variable.\nSubstitute x = 11 into one of the original equations.\nSolve for the other variable, y.\nWrite the solution as an ordered pair.

The ordered pair is (\u22124, \u22125).\nCheck that the ordered pair is a solution to\nboth original equations.\nThe solution is (\u22124, \u22125). 504 4. Systems of Equations\nTRY IT 3\nSolve the system by elimination.\nShow answer\nNow we\u2019ll do an example where we need to multiply both equations by constants in order to make the\ncoefficients of one variable opposites.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSolve the system by elimination.\nSolution\nIn this example, we cannot multiply just one equation by any constant to get opposite\ncoefficients. So we will strategically multiply both equations by a constant to get the\nopposites. 4.3 Solve Systems of Equations by Elimination 505\nBoth equations are in standard form.

A system of two linear inequalities is shown below.\nTo solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both\ninequalities. We solve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a\ngraph. We will find the region on the plane that contains all ordered pairs that make both\ninequalities true.\n547 548 4. Systems of Equations\nSolutions of a System of Linear Inequalities\nSolutions of a system of linear inequalities are the values of the variables that make all the inequalities true.\nThe solution of a system of linear inequalities is shown as a shaded region in the x-y\ncoordinate system that includes all the points whose ordered pairs make the inequalities\ntrue.\nTo determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, we substitute the values of\nthe variables into each inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the\nsystem.\nEXAMPLE 1\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system.\na) (\u22122, 4) b) (3,1)\nSolution\na) Is the ordered pair (\u22122, 4) a solution?\nThe ordered pair (\u22122, 4) made both inequalities true. Therefore (\u22122, 4) is a solution to this system.\nb) Is the ordered pair (3,1) a solution?\nThe ordered pair (3,1) made one inequality true, but the other one false. Therefore (3,1) is not a solution to\nthis system. 4.5 Graphing Systems of Linear Inequalities 549\nTRY IT 1\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system.\na) b)\nShow answer\na) no b) yes\nSolve a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing\nThe solution to a single linear inequality is the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all\nthe points that make the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region\nthat contains the solutions to both inequalities. To find this region, we will graph each inequality\nseparately and then locate the region where they are both true.

Many real life problems can be represented and solved using right angle\ntrigonometry.\nSine, Cosine, and Tangent Ratios\nWe know that any right triangle has three sides and a right angle. The side opposite to the right angle is\ncalled the hypotenuse. The other two angles in a right triangle are acute angles (with a measure less\nthan 90 degrees). One of those angles we call reference angle and we use \u03b8 (theta) to represent it.\nThe hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle. The other two sides are called opposite\nside and adjacent side. The names of those sides depends on which of the two acute angles is being\nused as a reference angle.\nFigure 1.\n599 600 5.

Metric system used by most\ncountries and imperial system used by the United States. Even though since 1970, Canada tried to\nswitch to the metric system, the imperial system of measurements is still used in Canada. We will look\nat the imperial system first.\nThe imperial system of measurement uses units of inch, foot, yard, and mile to measure length and\npound and ton to measure weight. For capacity, the units used are cup, pint, quart, and gallons. Both the\nimperial system and the metric system measure time in seconds, minutes, and hours.\nThe equivalencies of measurements are shown in the table below. The table also shows, in parentheses,\nthe common abbreviations for each measurement.\nImperial System of Measurement\n631 632 6. Health Option\nIn many medical applications, we need to convert between units of measurement, such as feet and\ninches, minutes and seconds, pounds and ounces, etc. We will use the identity property of\nmultiplication to do these conversions. We\u2019ll restate the identity property of multiplication here for easy\nreference.\nIdentity Property of Multiplication\nFor any real number :\n1 is the multiplicative identity.\nTo use the identity property of multiplication, we write 1 in a form that will help us convert the units.\nFor example, suppose we want to change inches to feet. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so\nwe will write 1 as the fraction . When we multiply by this fraction we do not change the\nvalue, but just change the units.\nBut also equals 1. How do we decide whether to multiply by or ? We\nchoose the fraction that will make the units we want to convert from divide out. Treat the unit words\nlike factors and \u201cdivide out\u201d common units like we do common factors. If we want to convert\ninches to feet, which multiplication will eliminate the inches?\nThe inches divide out and leave only feet. The second form does not have any units that will divide out\nand so will not help us.\nEXAMPLE 1\nMaryAnne is 66 inches tall. Convert her height into feet.\nSolution 6.1 Measurement; Health Applications 633\nTRY IT 1\nLexie is 30 inches tall. Convert her height to feet.\nShow answer\n2.5 feet\nHOW TO: Make unit conversions\n1. Multiply the measurement to be converted by 1; write 1 as a fraction relating the units given and\nthe units needed.\n2. Multiply.\n3. Simplify the fraction.\n4. Simplify. 634 6. Health Option\nEXAMPLE 2\nEli\u2019s six months son is 102.4 ounces. Convert his weight to pounds.\nSolution\nTo convert ounces into pounds we will multiply by conversion factors of 1.\n102.4 ounces\nWrite 1 as\nDivide out the common units.\nSimplify the fraction.\nSimplify.\nEli\u2019s six months son weights 6.4 pounds.\nTRY IT 2\nOne year old girl weights 11 pounds. Convert her weight to ounces.\nShow answer\n176 ounces.\nWhen we use the identity property of multiplication to convert units, we need to make sure the units we\nwant to change from will divide out. Usually this means we want the conversion fraction to have those\nunits in the denominator. Sometimes, to convert from one unit to another, we may need to use several\nother units in between, so we will need to multiply several fractions.\nEXAMPLE 3\nHow many ounces are in 1 gallon?\nSolution\nWe will convert gallons to ounces by multiplying by several conversion factors. Refer to the table on Imperial\nSystems of Measurement. 6.1 Measurement; Health Applications 635\n1 gallon\nMultiply the measurement to be converted by\n1.\nUse conversion factors to get to the right unit.\nSimplify.\nMultiply.\nSimplify.\nThere are 128 ounces in a gallon.\nTRY IT 3\nHow many teaspoons are in 1 cup?\nShow answer\n48 teaspoons\nMake Unit Conversions in the Metric System\nIn the metric system, units are related by powers of 10. The roots words of their names reflect this\nrelation. For example, the basic unit for measuring length is a metre. One kilometre is 1,000 metres; the\nprefix kilo means thousand. One centimetre is of a metre, just like one cent is of one dollar.\nThe equivalencies of measurements in the metric system are shown in the table below. The common\nabbreviations for each measurement are given in parentheses. 636 6. Health Option\nMetric System of Measurement\nLength Mass Capacity\n1 kilometre (km) = 1,000 m 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 g 1 kilolitre (kL) = 1,000 L\n1 hectometre (hm) = 100 m 1 hectogram (hg) = 100 g 1 hectolitre (hL) = 100 L\n1 dekametre (dam) = 10 m 1 dekagram (dag) = 10 g 1 dekalitre (daL) = 10 L\n1 metre (m) = 1 m 1 gram (g) = 1 g 1 litre (L) = 1 L\n1 decimetre (dm) = 0.1 m 1 decigram (dg) = 0.1 g 1 decilitre (dL) = 0.1 L\n1 centimetre (cm) = 0.01 m 1 centigram (cg) = 0.01 g 1 centilitre (cL) = 0.01 L\n1 millimetre (mm) = 0.001 m 1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 g 1 millilitre (mL) = 0.001 L\n1 microgram ( mcg) = 0.000001 g\n1 metre = 100 centimetres 1 gram = 100 centigrams 1 litre = 100 centilitre s\n1 metre = 1,000 millimetres 1 gram = 1,000 milligrams 1 litre = 1,000 millilitre s\nTo make conversions in the metric system, we will use the same technique we did in the Imperial\nsystem. Using the identity property of multiplication, we will multiply by a conversion factor of one to\nget to the correct units.\nEXAMPLE 4\nSamadia took 800mg of Ibuprofen for her inflammation. How many grams of Ibuprofen did she take?\nSolution\nWe will convert milligrams to grams using the identity property of multiplication.\n800 milligrams\nMultiply the measurement to be converted by 1. 800 milligrams \u00d7 1\nWrite 1 as a fraction relating kilometres and metres.\nSimplify.\nMultiply. 0.8 grams\nSamadia took 0.8 grams of Ibuprofen. 6.1 Measurement; Health Applications 637\nTRY IT 4\nKlaudia took 0.125 grams of Ibuprofen for his headache.

How many kilograms did the baby weigh?\nShow answer\n2.8 kilograms\nAs you become familiar with the metric system you may see a pattern. Since the system is based on\nmultiples of ten, the calculations involve multiplying by multiples of ten. We have learned how to\nsimplify these calculations by just moving the decimal. 638 6. Health Option\nTo multiply by 10, 100, or 1,000, we move the decimal to the right one, two, or three places,\nrespectively. To multiply by 0.1, 0.01, or 0.001, we move the decimal to the left one, two, or three\nplaces, respectively.\nWe can apply this pattern when we make measurement conversions in the metric system. In Example 8,\nwe changed 3,200 grams to kilograms by multiplying by (or 0.001). This is the same as moving\nthe decimal three places to the left.\nFigure.1\nEXAMPLE 6\nThe volume of blood coursing throughout an adult human body is about 5 litres.

Examples of rates are\nkilometres in hours, words in minutes, and dollars per ounces.\nRate\nA rate compares two quantities of different units. A rate is usually written as a fraction.\nWhen writing a fraction as a rate, we put the first given amount with its units in the numerator and the\nsecond amount with its units in the denominator. When rates are simplified, the units remain in the\nnumerator and denominator. 652 6. Health Option\nEXAMPLE 3\nA healthy heart has a rate around 72 beats per 60 seconds. Write this rate as a fraction.\nSolution\nWrite as a fraction, 72 beats in the numerator and 60 seconds in the\ndenominator.\nSo beats in seconds is equivalent to .\nTRY IT 3\nWrite the rate as a fraction: heartbeats in seconds.\nShow answer\nFind Unit Rate\nIn the last example, we calculated that a healthy heart beats at a rate of .

Data Analysis I\nData is collected daily from a variety of sources for the purpose of providing information. Once you\nhave collected data, what will you do with it? Data can be described and presented in many different\nformats. For example, suppose you are interested in buying a house in a particular area. You may have\nno clue about the house prices, so you might ask your real estate agent to give you a sample data set of\nprices. Looking at all the prices in the sample often is overwhelming. A better way might be to look at\nthe median price and the variation of prices. The median and variation are just two ways that you will\nlearn to describe data. Your agent might also provide you with a graph of the data.\nIn this chapter, you will study numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data. You will\nlearn how to calculate, and even more importantly, how to interpret these measurements and graphs. A\ntable can be used to collect and organize data which can then be more easily analyzed to determine\npatterns or trends. Frequency distributions and stem-and-leaf plots provide a tabular view that can be\nmore revealing than a basic table. A graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution\nof a sample or a population. A graph can be a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of\nnumbers because we can see where data clusters and where there are only a few data values.\nNewspapers and the Internet use graphs to show trends and to enable readers to compare facts and\nfigures quickly. Statisticians often graph data first to get a picture of the data. Then, more formal tools\nmay be applied. Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the bar\ngraph, the histogram, the frequency polygon (a type of broken line graph), the pie chart, and the box\nplot.\nIn this chapter, we will look at ways to collect, present and describe data. We will also consider how\ndata can be presented in misleading ways.\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of the chapter the student should be able to:\n\u2022 Present and analyze data using frequency distributions, stem-and-leaf plots, pictographs, bar\ngraphs, line graphs, and pie charts.\n\u2022 Describe and calculate the central measures of tendency: mean, median and mode\n\u2022 Design a statistical experiment, collect the data and analyze the results.\n683  7.1 Measures of Central Tendency\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section it is expected that you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate three measures of central tendency: the mean, median and mode\n\u2022 Describe what the mean, median and mode tell us about a data set\nWhen we discuss the mountains of the world we often hear mention of the world\u2019s highest peak, Mount\nEverest. Aside from the highest, there are other criteria which can be used to compare mountains.\nPerhaps we might want to determine the average height of the mountains within a specified mountain\nrange. We may wish to determine who has made the most number of summit attempts of a particular\nmountain and what that number of attempts was. These kinds of questions can be answered with\nstatistics.\n685 686 7. Data Analysis I\nMeasures of Central Tendency\nIn our daily lives we encounter data and statistics on a regular basis. The data can be analysed to\nascertain patterns and trends or to determine measures of central tendency. Three statistics that measure\nthe center point of a set of data are mean, median and mode. Each of these measures of central\ntendency serves a different purpose and provides a different perspective.\nConsider a college level biology class of 44 students that receives feedback on their midterm exam.\nThe instructor shares the following results with the class: the average score was 68%, the most\ncommon score was 48%, and the score that ranked right in the middle of the class was 75%. The three\nvalues each represent a different measure of central tendency for the exam scores. What can we\nconclude about how the class performed? An examination of each of the three measures will help\nanswer this question.\nMean\nIn the college biology class the average score on the midterm exam was 68%. The average score is also\nreferred to as the mean. The average score of 68% on the biology exam is the sum of all exam scores\ndivided by the number of scores (44 students).\nMean\nThe mean is the sum of all data items divided by the number of data items. This can be expressed as :\nThe symbol \u2211 is called the summation symbol and indicates that all data items are to be summed. The\nmean or average of a set of data is calculated by adding all of the values and dividing by the number of\nvalues.\nConsider a runner who is training for a 10 km race. Her coach requires that she run an average distance\nof 15 km a day. Over a two week period the runner logged the following distances (in km) on her daily\nruns.\nSu M T W Th F Sa Su M T W Th F Sa\n15 16 14 22 15 10 30 0 15 20 20 24 5 32\nDid the runner meet the coach\u2019s requirement? To determine the answer we need to calculate the\naverage or mean.\nTo determine the average daily distance the calculation would be: 7.1 Measures of Central Tendency 687\nOn average the runner covered 17km/day which exceeds the coach\u2019s required 15km/day.\nEXAMPLE 1\nFifteen students wrote a math test and received the following grades: 89, 45, 78, 76, 73, 98, 73, 92, 88, 73,\n100, 51, 64, 80, 95.\nSolution\nTo determine the mean:\nAdd the grades and divide by the number of grades (15)\n(89+45+78+76+73+98+73+92+88+73+100+51+64+80+95)/15 = 1175/15 = 78.33\u2026\nThe average grade, rounded to the nearest whole number, was 78.\nTRY IT 1\nFind the mean of the data set: 5.7, 3.4, 7.8, 9.2, 3.8, 1.6\nShow answer\nData is often compiled in the form of tables and it is more efficient to calculate the mean using\naggregates of each value.\nEXAMPLE 2\nA class of 46 students were asked to rate their instructor on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest.

In the biology class with 44 students the score that ranked right in the\nmiddle of the class was 75%. This means that half of the exam scores were lower than 75% and half of\nthe exam scores were higher than 75%.\nMedian\nThe median is the data item in the middle of each set of ranked, or ordered, data. The median separates the\nupper half and the lower half of a data set. It is the \u201cmiddle\u201d value of the data set when it is arranged from 7.1 Measures of Central Tendency 689\nhighest to lowest values or from lowest values to highest values. If there are two middle values, the median is\nthe average of these two values.\nTo find the median of a group of data items:\n1. Arrange the data items in order, from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest.\n2. If the number of data items is odd, the median is the data item in the middle of the list.\n3. If the number of data items is even, the median is the mean of the two middle data items.\nReturning to the runner who logged the following distances over two weeks:\nSu M T W Th F Sa Su M T W Th F Sa\n15 16 14 22 15 10 30 0 15 20 20 24 5 32\nThe median would be determined by ranking the distances from smallest to largest:\nThe number of data items is even (14 items), therefore the median is the average of the two middle\nitems. The two middle values are 15km and 16km. The average of these is (15 + 16)/ 2 = 15.5km so\nthe median distance is 15.5 km. This indicates that for the runner half of the distances run would be less\nthan 15.5 km and half would be greater than 15.5 km.\nIf the number of data items is odd, the median is the data item that lies exactly in the middle of the\nranked data items; it separates the data items into two halves.\nEXAMPLE 3\nFifteen students wrote a math test and received the following grades: 89, 45, 78, 76, 73, 98, 73, 92, 88, 73,\n100, 51, 64, 80, 95. What was the median grade?\nSolution\nTo determine the median:\n1. Order the data set from highest to lowest values: 100, 98, 95, 92, 89, 88, 80, 78, 76,\n73, 73, 73, 64, 51, 45\n2. Determine the middle value: 100, 98, 95, 92, 89, 88, 80, 78, 76, 73, 73, 73, 64, 51, 45 690 7. Data Analysis I\nNote that there is an odd number of values (15) so there is exactly one middle value. The median value is the\n8th value since 15 values/2 = the 7.5th or 8th value. Counting from highest to lowest or from lowest to\nhighest values, the 8th value is 78.\nIn example 1 the mean was calculated as 78.3\u2026 In this case the mean and median are quite close. It is\nimportant to note that the mean and median may not always be so close.\nTRY IT 3\nFind the median of the data set: 5.7, 3.4, 7.8, 9.2, 3.8, 1.6\nShow answer\nWhen data is presented in the form of a table the median can be determined using a few different\nmethods.\nEXAMPLE 4\nA class of 46 students were asked to rate their instructor on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible\nrating. The table provides the number of students assigning a score of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nNumber of\nStudents\nScore Total Number of Scores\nAssigning this\nScore\n1 2 2 scores of 1\n2 5 2+5= 7 scores of 1 or 2\n3 15 7+15= 22 scores of 1, 2 or 3\n4 11 22+11= 33 scores of 1, 2, 3, or 4\n5 13 33+13= 46 scores of 1, 2, 3 ,4 or 5\nSolution\nTo determine the median, divide the number of student scores by 2: 46/2=23 This indicates that there will\nbe 23 scores in the top half and 23 scores in the bottom half, therefore the middle score will be the average of\nthe 23rd and 24th scores. Working from the low score of 1 to the high score of 5, the first 22 scores were\neither 1, 2, or 3. The 23rd score is 4 and the 24th score is 4, therefore the median score is 4.\nNote: An alternate method for determining the median would be to list every score from low to high and then 7.1 Measures of Central Tendency 691\ncount until the middle score is reached: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4 \u21d1 4, 4,\n4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5\nThe 23rd and 24th scores are 4 and 4 so the median is the average of these (4+4)/2 = 4\nTRY IT 4\nA coffee outlet sells coffee in 4 different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. The table provides a\nsummary of one morning\u2019s sales. Determine which of the four sizes, small, medium, large or extra large\nwould be the median size purchased.\nSize Number of Purchasers\nsmall (12 oz) 29\nmedium (15 oz.) 47\nlarge (20 oz.) 52\nextra large (24 oz.) 11\nShow answer\n. Therefore since 69 purchasers were in the bottom half and 69 were in the top\nhalf, the median purchaser was a medium cup sup of 15 oz..\nMode\nFor the college biology class the most common score was 48%. This grade represents the mode for the\nset of exam scores, as the mode is the data value that occurs most often. Although a mode of 48% may\nseem to indicate a poor overall result, this is not necessarily the case. A score of 48% could possibly\nhave occurred only twice for the entire class if all other grades each occurred only once.\nMode\nThe mode is the most frequently occurring data value. A data set can have more than one mode. If there are\ntwo values that each occur the same number of times then the data set is bimodal. 692 7. Data Analysis I\nEXAMPLE 5\nFifteen students wrote a math test and received the following grades: 89, 45, 78, 76, 73, 98, 73, 92, 88, 73,\n100, 51, 64, 80, 95.\nSolution\nTo determine the mode: Count the number of times each data value occurs. In this example the value that\noccurs three times, 73, is the mode.\nTRY IT 5\nOver a two week period a runner logged the following distances (in km) on her daily runs. Determine the\nmode (the distance that she ran most often).\nSu M T W Th F Sa Su M T W Th F Sa\n15 16 14 22 15 10 30 0 15 20 20 24 5 32\nShow answer\nThe mode is 15 km\nWhen data is presented in tabular form the mode is often apparent.\nEXAMPLE 6\nA class of 46 students were asked to rate their instructor on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. The\ntable provides the number of students assigning a score of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\nScores Number of Students assigning this Score\n1 2\n2 5\n3 15\n4 11\n5 13\nSolution 7.1 Measures of Central Tendency 693\nThe mode is the value that occurs 15 times, which is 3.\nIt is possible to have more than one mode in a set of data. If two different data values occur most often\nthe data is considered to be bimodal. In example 2, if the students assigning scores of 1 changed their\nscores to 5, then the score of 3 and the score of 5 would both occur 15 times. In this case the data set\nwould be bimodal.\nIf each value in a set of data occurs the same number of times then there is said to be no mode. In Try It\n1 the data set is 5.7, 3.4, 7.8, 9.2, 3.8, 1.6. There is no mode for this set of data.\nTRY IT 6\nA coffee outlet sells coffee in 4 different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. The table provides a\nsummary of one morning\u2019s sales. Determine which of the four sizes, small, medium, large or extra large\nwould be the mode.\nNumber of\nSize\nPurchasers\nsmall (12 oz.) 29\nmedium (15 oz.) 47\nlarge (20 oz.) 52\nextra large (24 oz.) 11\nShow answer\nSince 52 of the purchasers chose the large size of 20 oz. the 20 oz cup size is the mode.\nMean, Median or Mode?\nThe three measures of central tendency can yield very different results for one data set, as evidenced by\nexamples one and two above. When choosing which measure to use, consideration must be given to the\npurpose.\nIn example 1 the average grade and median are both 78 but the mode is 73. Although the mean is often\nused for grade comparisons, the median is also useful as it serves as an indicator of the midpoint of\nthe grade distribution (distribution will be covered in a later section of this text). Although the mode is\nused less often with grades, it does indicate to students that although a grade of 73 was below the\naverage, it was the most common grade. 694 7. Data Analysis I\nEXAMPLE 7\nConsider again the example 6 involving the instructor evaluation. In a class of 46 students, the mean\nevaluation score was 3.6, the median was 4 and the mode was 3. Which measure is most useful: mean,\nmedian or mode? Why?\nSolution\nThe difference in these values may seem slight, yet each provides a different perspective. The mean and the\nmedian are probably most useful.\nThe mean score of 3.6 does not truly reflect any of the possible choices since only scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5\nare possible but it does indicate that on average students are more happy (than not) with the instructor. The\nmedian score of 4 indicates that half of the students awarded the instructor a score of 4 or 5 so the median\nalso provides an encouraging result. The mode indicates that out of the entire class a ranking of 3 was given\nmost often (15 times) by one third of the students but it doesn\u2019t yield any information about the other two\nthirds of the evaluations.\nTRY IT 7\nReferring back to the coffee outlet, discuss with a classmate: which measure is most useful to the owner of\nthe coffee outlet? mean, median or mode?

Since the mean was\nonly 55% we can conclude that some scores were quite low (less than 55%). 7.2 Graphs and Tables\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section it is expected that you will be able to:\n\u2022 Extract information from a table, a bar graph, a line graph or a pie graph\n\u2022 Create a stem and leaf graph from a set of data\n\u2022 Create a frequency distribution table from a set of data\n\u2022 Create a line graph, a bar graph and a pie graph (with or without technology)\n\u2022 Compare a bar graph to a histogram\nWe have seen how data can be represented numerically with measures such as the mean, median and\nmode. Data can be organized and displayed in visual formats that allow the user to more easily extract\ninformation. When we represent data graphically we can determine data clusters, make comparisons, or\ndetermine trends.\n697 698 7. Data Analysis I\nDisplaying Data with Tables or Graphs\nWe will consider some graphical alternatives for displaying the information presented in the following\nparagraph:\nAccording to Venture Kamloops, the six largest employers in Kamloops, British Columbia, along with the\nnumber of employees in parentheses are: Interior Health Authority (3398), School Distric#73 (1924),\nThompson Rivers University (1092), Highland Valley Copper Mine (1351), the City of Kamloops (761) and\nBc Lottery Corporation (440) http://venturekamloops.com/pdf/DBIK-Community-Facts-Residential-\nApril-2017.pdf\nTables\nTransferring the data to a table, as in Table 1, provides greater clarity. The reader can quickly\ndetermine the names of the employers and their corresponding number of employees. It is\neasier to determine the employer with the greatest and least number of employees.\nTable 1\nNumber of\nEmployer\nEmployees\nInterior Health Authority 3398\nSchool District #73 1924\nThompson Rivers University 1092\nHighland Valley Copper\n1351\nMine\nCity of Kamloops 761\nBC Lottery Corporation 440 7.2 Graphs and Tables 699\nGraphs\nWhen the data is represented visually the reader can quickly retrieve information and make\ncomparisons. Technology can be used to easily create a wide variety of graphs. The data from\nthe table was entered into a spreadsheet and three graphs were generated. The results are\ndisplayed below as a bar graph (Fig. 1a), a pie graph (Fig. 1b), and a waterfall graph (Fig. 1c).\nBar Graph\nFig. 1a 700 7. Data Analysis I\nCircle or Pie Graph\nFig. 1b\nWaterfall\nFig. 1c\nConsider each of the three graphs in Figures 1a, 1b and 1c (bar, pie and waterfall) to answer the\nfollowing questions. Beside each answer indicate which of the three graph(s) provides the answer.\n1. Which of the six employers has the most number of employees?\n2. How many employees work for the largest employer? 7.2 Graphs and Tables 701\n3. Which of the six employers has the least number of employees?\n4. How many employees work for the smallest employer?\n5. Where does TRU place in the ranking of number of employees?\n6. Which graph is the easiest to extract data from?\nThe answers to the six questions would be:\n1. Interior Health has the most number of employees. This information is found in all three\ngraphs.\n2. Interior Health employs 3398 people. This information can only be determined using the pie\ngraph\n3. BC Lottery has the least number of employees. This information is found in all three graphs.\n4. BC Lottery employs 440 people. This information can only be determined using the pie\ngraph\n5. TRU ranks fourth in the number of employees. This can be stated with certainty by using the\nbar graph or pie graph. The reader may not be so certain with the waterfall graph.\n6. This depend on which information is required.\nNote that there is not necessarily one form of graph that is better than the others. It is important to\nrecognize that the way in which the information is presented will impact its use. By making one\nchange, such as including the numerical values for the bar or waterfall graphs, the user would be able to\nobtain more exact information.\nWhen choosing and creating a table or graph it is important to know what kind of information is\nrequired. A decision can then be made as to how best to depict this. Since technology provides easily\naccessible tools for creating tables and charts, this section will focus on the features of different tables\nand graphs rather than on the manual construction of the graphs.\nWe will now take a closer look at line graphs, bar graphs, and circle graphs as well as stem-and-leaf\nplots and frequency tables.\nStem-and-Leaf Graph\nOne simple graph, the stem-and-leaf graph or stemplot, is a good choice when the data sets are small.\nThis graph indicates data clusters and can be used to determine the measures of central tendency.\nA stem-and-leaf graph divides each observation of data into a stem and a leaf. The leaf consists of one\nfinal significant digit. For example, 23 has a stem of 2 and a leaf 3. The number 432 has a stem of 43\nand a leaf of 2. Likewise, the number 5,432 has a stem 543 and a leaf of two. The decimal 9.3 has a\nstem of nine and a leaf of three.\nTo create the plot, write the stems in a vertical line from smallest to largest. Draw a vertical line to the\nright of the stems. Then write the leaves in increasing order next to their corresponding stem. 702 7. Data Analysis I\nEXAMPLE 1\nFor Susan\u2019s spring pre-calculus class, scores for the first exam were as follows (ranked from lowest to\nhighest):\n33; 42; 49; 49; 53; 55; 55; 61; 63; 67; 68; 68; 69; 69; 72; 73; 74; 78; 80; 83; 88; 88; 88; 90; 92; 94; 94; 94; 94;\n96; 100\na) Create a stem-and-leaf graph for the data.\nb) Describe where the data clusters.\nc) What percentage of the students obtained a score of 90 or better?\nd) What is the mean, median and mode?\nSolution\na) To create the graph, rank the data from lowest to highest.\nCreate the column for the stems. This will be the first digit in a two digit number and the first two digits in a\nthree digit number. The stems will start at 3 and end at 10.\nFor each data value, add each leaf to its corresponding stem. For the value 33. the stem is 3 and the leaf is 3.\nFor the value 68 the stem is 6 and the leaf is 8. Since 68 occurs twice in the data set, for the stem of 6 there\nwill be two leaves of 8.\nStem Leaf\n3 3\n4 2 9 9\n5 3 5 5\n6 1 3 7 8 8 9 9\n7 2 3 4 8\n8 0 3 8 8 8\n9 0 2 4 4 4 4 6\n10 0\nb) There appears to be two clusters of data. The stemplot shows that most scores fell in either the 60s or the\n90\u2019s.\nc) Eight out of the 31 scores or approximately 26% were in the 90s or 100.\nd) The mean is 73.5. Since there are 31 students, the median is the 16th score, which is 73. The mode is 94 as\nit occurs 4 times. 7.2 Graphs and Tables 703\nTRY IT 1\nFor the Park City basketball team, scores for the last 30 games were as follows (from lowest to highest):\n32; 32; 33; 34; 38; 40; 42; 42; 43; 44; 46; 47; 47; 48; 48; 48; 49; 50; 50; 51; 52; 52; 52; 53; 54; 56; 57; 57; 60;\n61\na) Construct a stem-and-leaf graph for the data.\nb) In what percent of the games did the team score less than 40 points?\nc) Use the graph to determine the mean, median and mode.\nShow answer\na)\nStem Leaf\n3 2 2 3 4 8\n4 0 2 2 3 4 6 7 7 8 8 8 9\n5 0 0 1 2 2 2 3 4 6 7 7\n6 0 1\nb) 16.7%\nc) Mean is 47.3; Median is 48; Bimodal 48 and 52\nThe stem-and-leaf graph presents a quick way to graph data and it gives an exact picture of the data. It\nalso provides an opportunity to recognize outliers. An outlier is an observation of data that does not fit\nthe rest of the data. It is sometimes called an extreme value. When you graph an outlier, it will appear\nnot to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to mistakes (for example, writing down 50\ninstead of 500) while others may indicate that something unusual is happening.\nEXAMPLE 2\nA restaurant was scouting for a new location. It wants to be within walking distance to theatres or performing\narts facilities. It gathered data for the distances (in kilometres) between a potential new location and several\ntheatres or arts facilities:\n1.1; 1.5; 2.3; 2.5; 2.7; 3.2; 3.3; 3.3; 3.5; 3.8; 4.0; 4.2; 4.5; 4.5; 4.7; 4.8; 5.5; 5.6; 6.5; 6.7; 12.3\na) Create a stemp-and-leaf graph for the data. Note: The leaves are the digits to the right of the decimal.\nb) Do the data seem to have any concentration of values? What does this indicate to the restaurant about this\npotential location?\nc) Do there appear to be any outliers?\nd) Determine the median and the mean. 704 7. Data Analysis I\ne) Eliminate the outlier and recalculate the mean. What impact does the outlier have on the mean?\nSolution\na)\nStem Leaf\n1 1 5\n2 3 5 7\n3 2 3 3 5 8\n4 0 2 5 5 7 8\n5 5 6\n6 5 7\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12 3\nb) Values appear to concentrate between three and five kilometres. This potential location might not be best\nas many of the theatres and arts facilities are not within walking distance.\nc) The value 12.3 km appears to be an outlier.\nd) The median is the 11th data value or 4.0 km The mean is 4.3 km.\ne) The mean will be 3.91 km. The outlier results in a much larger mean (4.3 km rather than 3.91 km).\nTRY IT 2\nThe following data show the distances (in kilometres) to a college from the homes of the members of the\ncounselling department:\n0.5; 0.7; 1.1; 1.2; 1.2; 1.3; 1.3; 1.5; 1.5; 1.7; 1.7; 1.8; 1.9; 2.0; 2.2; 2.5; 2.6; 2.8; 2.8; 2.8; 3.5; 3.8; 4.4; 4.8;\n4.9; 5.2; 5.5; 5.7; 5.8; 8.0\na) Create a stem-and-leaf graph using the data.\nb) Determine the mean, median, mode and any outliers.\nShow answer\na) 7.2 Graphs and Tables 705\nStem Leaf\n0 5 7\n1 1 2 2 3 3 5 5 7 7 8 9\n2 0 2 5 6 8 8 8\n3 5 8\n4 4 8 9\n5 2 5 7 8\n6\n7\n8 0\nb) Mean is 2.89 km; Median Mode 2.8 km Outlier 8.0 km\nFrequency Distributions\nFrequency is the number of occurrences of an event over a period of time. The frequency of a full\nmoon is generally once a month. The frequency of one\u2019s birthday is once a year. A frequency\ndistribution table illustrates the frequency or number of times that a specific outcome or data value\noccurs. Tally marks can be used to keep track of the number of occurences. Once the tally is complete\nthe frequency distribution table can be created.\nConsider a marketing survey where sixty-five females were asked their shoe size. The responses ranged\nfrom size 5 to size 11. A tally of the results is illustrated:\nThe tally is then easily converted to a frequency distribution table . 706 7. Data Analysis I\nShoe Size Number of Females\n5 4\n6 11\n7 17\n8 13\n9 10\n10 7\n11 3\nFrequency Distribution\nA frequency distribution can show the absolute frequency and the relative frequency. The absolute\nfrequency is the number of occurences of a data value. The relative frequency is the ratio of the number of\noccurrences of a data value to the total number of data values.\nEXAMPLE 3.1\na) Create a frequency distribution table to show the absolute frequency and the relative frequency for the shoe\nsize tally of 65 females:\nb) Which shoe size was the most common? What percentage of the females wear this size?\nc) Which shoe size was the least common? What percentage of the females wear this size?\nSolution\na) The frequency table will require 3 columns and 8 rows: 7.2 Graphs and Tables 707\nShoe Size Absolute Frequency Relative Frequency\n5 4 6%\n6 11 17%\n7 17 26%\n8 13 20%\n9 10 15%\n10 7 11%\n11 3 5%\nThe absolute frequency is the number of females with a specific shoe size.\nThe relative frequency is the ratio of the number of females with a specific shoe size to the total number of\nfemales. Since there are 65 females in the survey, the relative frequency for shoe size 5 is 4/65 = 0.0615 =\n6% Note: the relative frequencies have been converted from decimals to percentages and rounded to the\nnearest whole number.\nb) Size 7 is the most common with 26%\nc) Size 11 is the least common with 5%\nTRY IT 3\nThe tally of the birth months for a class of 145 students is shown in the following table.\na) Create a frequency distribution table that shows both the absolute and the relative frequencies. The\nabsolute frequency is the number of birthdays. The relative frequency is the ratio of the number of\nbirthdays to the total number of students. Note: Round the relative frequencies to the nearest whole number.\nb) Which month is the most common? What percentage of the students had a birthday during this month?\nc) Which month is the least common? What percentage of the students had a birthday during this month? 708 7.

The bar graph, line graph and pie (circle) graph provide\nquick visual representations of the data and allow the user to make comparisons and extract\ninformation. As stated earlier in this section, technology assists us with creating the graphs but it is the\ncreater\u2019s responsibility to determine the specifics. When creating a graph, consider the following:\n\u2022 What information must be conveyed? Ranking, high and low values, trends?\n\u2022 What type of graph will best suit this? Bar, pie, line, waterfall\u2026\n\u2022 Select an appropriate title and labels for the axis. Without a title and labels the graph is\nvirtually meaningless.\n\u2022 What should the scale for each axis be? Should there be increments of 1, 10, 100, 1000\u2026.?\n\u2022 How much detail or colour is useful or required? Consider whether to include numerical\nvalues (or not). Don\u2019t go overboard with colour variations and information at the expense of\nneatness and conciseness.\nConsider the bar graphs in Figures 2 and 3:\nFig. 2 710 7. Data Analysis I\nFig. 3\nAlthough the data values are identical for both bar graphs, it might not appear from figure 3 that\nInterior Health dominates as the top employer in Kamloops. This illustrates that the choice of scale is\ncritical. In Figure 3 the graph is also missing the labels on the vertical and horizontal axes.\nConsider the pie graphs in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Which is more informative?\nFig. 4 7.2 Graphs and Tables 711\nFig. 5\nWhen creating a graph be sure to include the title and any relevant information. The circle graph in\nFigure 5 is lacking a title which makes the graph meaningless. The addition of a title \u201cTop Six\nEmployers in Kamloops\u201d would enable the user to determine rankings but not the actual number of\nemployees. The addition of employee numbers as in Figure 4 would add further clarity to Figure 5.\nNote that although the colour in Figure 4 may make it more visually appealing, it is the title, labels and\nnumerical values that are most informative.\nBar Graphs\nA bar graph presents data using vertical or horizontal rectangular bars. Bar graphs are useful for\nmaking comparisons or for showing trends over time. One axis shows the categories and the other axis\nshows the values. The bar graph in Figure 6 indicates that there was a rising trend in the number of\nUSDA (United States Department of Agriculture) certified domestic organic operations from 2005 to\n2015. The reader can also make comparisons. In Figure 6 we can see that the number of certified\ndomestic organic operations more than doubled between the years 2005 and 2015. 712 7. Data Analysis I\nFig. 6 \u201cUSDA Certified Organic Operations graphic\u201d is licensed under CC BY 2.0\nEXAMPLE 4\nA retailer tracked the sale of a particular shoe style. The information in the bar graph illustrates the colour\npreference for one week of sales.\na) What was the most preferred colour? How many females preferred this colour?\nb) What was the least preferred colour? How many females preferred this colour?\nc) How many more females preferred grey over blue? 7.2 Graphs and Tables 713\nSolution\na) Black was the most preferred colour. 17 females preferred black.\nb) Red was the least preferred colour. 3 females preferred red.\nc) Three more preferred grey over blue.\nTRY IT 4\na) Refer to the tally in TRY IT 3. Create a vertical bar graph for the distribution of birth months. Be sure to\ninclude a title, axis labels and select a reasonable scale for the values. 714 7. Data Analysis I\nb) In which three months were there the most number of birthdays?\nc) In which three months were there the least number of birthdays?\nd) How many more birthdays were there in September as compared to April?\ne) What is the trend in the number of birthdays over the course of the year?\nShow answer\na)\nb) October, November and March\nc) June, July and December\nd) 5 more in Sept. than in April\ne) the no. increases in the spring and fall and decreases in the summer and winter months.\nSome data sets are better represented as occuring in natural pairs. With shoe sizes or colours perhaps\nwe might want to compare male and female responses. Bar graphs can be created to illustrate more than\none category. 7.2 Graphs and Tables 715\nEXAMPLE 5\nThe Hornets hockey team entered the league in 2010. Each season consists of 80 games. Their win/loss\nrecord is provided in the table below.\nYear # of Wins # of Losses\n2010 33 47\n2011 31 49\n2012 36 44\n2013 41 39\n2014 44 36\n2015 52 28\n2016 57 23\n2017 56 24\n2018 59 21\n2019 61 19\nA bar graph provides a visual comparison of wins and losses each year.\na) In which year were there the most losses? the most wins?\nb) In which year were the number of wins and losses almost identical?\nc) In which year did the number of wins exceed the number of losses (for the first time)?\nd) Use the graph to estimate how many more wins than losses there were in 2016.\ne) What was the trend in wins and losses from 2010 to 2019? 716 7. Data Analysis I\nSolution\na) The team had its highest number of losses in its second year of operations 2011 and its highest number of\nwins in 2019.\nb) 2013\nc) 2013\nd) 57 \u2013 22 = 35 (note that the table indicates that it is actually 34)\ne) Over the ten years, the number of wins has been increasing and the number of losses has been decreasing.\nThe number of wins surpassed the number of loses for the first time in 2013.\nBar graphs can also be arranged in a stacked format. Refer to Figure 7. This type of bar graph\nillustrates the relationship between the parts and the whole. Although beyond the scope of this text it is\nworth illustrating.\nFig. 7\nTRY IT 5\nThe average high temperature (to the nearest degree Celsius) and the average monthly rainfall (in mm) for\nPhoenix Arizona are provided in the table below (Source: https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/arizona/\nunited-states/3172#) . 7.2 Graphs and Tables 717\nMonth Temperature (Celsius) Rainfall (mm)\nJanuary 20 8\nFebruary 22 19\nMarch 25 12\nApril 30 16\nMay 35 21\nJune 40 25\nJuly 41 29\nAugust 40 28\nSeptember 38 25\nOctober 31 18\nNovember 24 12\nDecember 19 7\na) Create one bar graph illustrating both the average daily temperature and average rainfall for Phoenix.\nb) In which month was there the most rainfall? The least rainfall?\nc) In which month was the average temperature the highest? the lowest?\nd) What pattern is there as you compare the temperature trend with the rainfall trend?\ne) Which is the better month to be in Phoenix? October or April? Why?\nShow answer 718 7. Data Analysis I\na)\nb) Most rainfall in July; least rainfall in December\nc) Highest avg. temperature in July; lowest avg. temperature in December\nd) As avg. temperature increases/decreases so does the rainfall\ne) Both are very similar. In April it is not quite as warm and a little less rain so perhaps that might be\npreferred.\nLine Graphs\nLine graphs can be used to show data changes over time. The horizontal or x-axis represents time and\nthe vertical or y-axis represents the data points which are plotted and joined by line segments. Trends\nand rates of change can be determined by considering the slope of the line. It is also possible to have\nmore than one line on a graph.\nLine graphs are useful for illustrating trends over time but accuracy can be lost. In Figure 8 the\nescalating increase in housing prices is evident but it is difficult to determine average house prices in a\nspecific year.\nFig. 8 Average Price of Detached Homes in Vancouver BC (in $1000\u2019s) 7.2 Graphs and Tables 719\nEXAMPLE 6\nConsider the Hornets hockey team from Example 5. To construct a line graph, draw a horizontal axis to\nrepresent the years 2010 through 2019. The vertical axis will represent both the number of wins and the\nnumber of losses.\nSolution 720 7. Data Analysis I\nSeveral observations can be made from the line graph in Example 6. The number of wins increased\nevery year except for 2010 to 2011 and 2016 to 2017. The number of wins first surpassed the number\nof losses in 2013 and continued to do so every year after that. The gap between the number of wins\nversus the number of losses was the highest in 2019. The lowest number of wins was in 2011 and the\nhighest was in 2019. One might also make a prediction that based on the upward trend in wins that in\n2020 the Hornets could have their best year ever. This is known as extrapolating from the data.\nTRY IT 6\nUse the data from Try It 5 to create a line graph representing the temperature and rainfall from January to\nDecember. Be sure to title and label the axes of your graph.\nShow answer 7.2 Graphs and Tables 721\nHistograms\nA different type of graph that also uses bars is the histogram. Histograms are used to illustrate the\ndistribution of one specific data item such as height or temperature. In a histogram the data will be\nquantitative, as with income or heights. With a histogram the numerical data values are divided into\n\u201cbins\u201d or intervals. A bin could represent one data value or a range of data values. In the next example\neach bin represents one shoe size.\nReconsider example 3 with shoe sizes (qualitative) and example 4 with shoe colours (qualitative). Bar\ncharts were created for both of these. A histogram could be created for the shoe sizes but not shoe\ncolour. Refer to Figure 9. This histogram illustrates the frequency or occurrence of shoe sizes ranging\nfrom size 5 to size 11 where every bar (bin) represents one shoe size. The most frequent size is 7 and\nthe other sizes are dispersed outward from size 7. 722 7. Data Analysis I\nFig. 9\nNote that with a histogram there are no spaces between the bars and the bars range from low to high (or\nhigh to low). With a histogram the data values appear on the horizontal axis and the frequency (number\nof occurrences) appears on the vertical axis. In a histogram the data can be distinct quantities (as with\nshoe sizes) or it may be grouped into intervals. As an example consider a histogram representing\nhourly wages. The hourly wage could be distinct values: $15, $16, $17 or it could be intervals:\n$15-$16, $17-$18, $19-20.\nConsider Figure 10 below. Every bar represents an interval that is half a unit: 0-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-1.5 and\nso on. From the histogram we can easily determine which interval occurs the most often and which\noccurs least often. We can also determine how the data values are clustered.

Bar graphs provide a visual comparison of different categories (e.g.\ncomparing the total number of wins for several different hockey teams) but they can be\ndifficult to read accurately. Line graphs are useful for depicting trends over time but are\ninappropriate for comparing distinct categories (e.g. comparing the total number of wins for\nhockey teams). Pie graphs are useful for representing portions of a whole (e.g. voter\npreferences in an election) but they can be difficult to read accurately. 7.3 Collecting Data\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section it is expected that you will be able to:\n\u2022 State whether data is quantitative or qualitative\n\u2022 Describe the random sampling methods: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, cluster\nsampling and convenience sampling\n\u2022 Discuss potential problems that might arise when sampling from a population\nPopulations and Samples\nIn statistics, we generally want to study a population. You can think of a population as a collection of\npersons, things, or objects under study. It is often not feasible or possible to study the entire population.\nInstead we can select a sample. The idea of sampling is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger\npopulation and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the\nresult of sampling from a population.\nBecause it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very practical\ntechnique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make\n731 732 7. Data Analysis I\nsense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would\nbe the students\u2019 grade point averages. In elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000\u20132,000 people are\ntaken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country.\nTypes of Data\nMost data can be categorized as qualitative or quantitative.\nQualitative data are the result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population using our senses\nsuch as sight or touch. Hair color, blood type, ethnic group, the car model that a person drives, and the\nstreet a person lives on are examples of qualitative data. Qualitative data are generally described by\nwords or letters. For instance, hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red.\nBlood type might be AB+, O-, or B+.\nQuantitative data are always numbers. Quantitative data are the result of counting or measuring\nattributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate, weight, number of people living in your town,\nand number of students who take statistics are examples of quantitative data. Researchers often prefer\nto use quantitative data over qualitative data because it lends itself more easily to mathematical\nanalysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color or median blood type.\nEXAMPLE 1\nConsider a high school math class and a sample of five student\u2019s backpacks. Determine whether the data is\nquantitative or qualitative.\n1. One data set is the number of books students carry in their backpacks.Two students carry three books, one\nstudent carries four books, one student carries two books, and one student carries one book.\n2. For the sample of five backpacks you weigh the backpacks and contents. The weights (in kilograms) of\ntheir backpacks are 3.2, 5, 4.8, 5.1, 2.3.\n3. For the sample of five students you record the colour of the backpacks. The books are red, blue or black.\nSolution:\n1. This is quantitative data.\n2. This is quantitative data.\n3. This is qualitative data.\nTRY IT 1\nDetermine the correct data type (quantitative or qualitative). 7.3 Collecting Data 733\na. the number of pairs of shoes you own\nb. the colour of vehicle you drive\nc. the distance it is from your home to the nearest grocery store\nd. the number of classes you take per school year.\ne. the model of calculator you use\nf. weights of sumo wrestlers\ng. total number of correct answers on a quiz\nh. IQ scores\nShow answer\nItems a, c, d, f, g and h are quantitative; items b and e are qualitative.\nIt is often possible to assign both qualitative and quantitative measures to one set of data.\nEXAMPLE 2\nYou go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (350 ml tomato, 400 ml lentil, and 250 ml chicken\nnoodle), four different kinds of vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and carrots), and two containers pf\nice cream (pistachio ice cream and vanilla ice cream).\nName the data sets that are qualitative.\nSolution\nThe types of soups, vegetables and desserts are qualitative data because they are categorical. They are not\nmeasured or counted.\nTRY IT 2\nYou go to the supermarket and purchase three cans of soup (350 ml tomato, 400 ml lentil, and 250 ml chicken\nnoodle), four different kinds of vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and carrots), and two containers pf\nice cream (pistachio ice cream and vanilla ice cream).\nName the data sets that are quantitative.\nShow answer\nThe three cans of soup, four kinds of vegetables and two ice creams are quantitative data because you count\nthem. The weights of the soups are quantitative because you measure weights as precisely as possible. 734 7. Data Analysis I\nSampling\nGathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible.\nInstead, we use a sample of the population. A sample should have the same characteristics as the\npopulation it is representing. There are several different methods of random sampling. This section will\ndescribe four of the most common methods. In each form of random sampling, each member of a\npopulation initially has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.\nSimple Random Sampling\nThe easiest method to describe is called a simple random sample. Any group of \u2018n\u2019 individuals is\nequally likely to be chosen as any other group of \u2018n\u2019 individuals if the simple random sampling\ntechnique is used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.\nFor example, suppose Lisa wants to form a four-person study group (herself and three other people)\nfrom her pre-calculus class, which has 31 members not including Lisa. To choose a simple random\nsample of size three from the other members of her class, Lisa could put all 31 names in a hat, shake\nthe hat, close her eyes, and pick out three names. An alternative is for Lisa to alphabetically list the last\nnames of the members of her class and number each with a two-digit number 01, 02, 03, 04, 05,\n06,\u202631. Lisa can use a table of random numbers (found in many statistics books) a\ncalculator, or a computer to generate random numbers.\nEXAMPLE 3\nHow can Lisa determine three group mates from a numbered list of 31 students?\nSolution\nLisa can generate random numbers from a calculator.\nThe calculator generates the first seven random numbers as follows: 0.943 0.230 0.046 0.514 0.405 0.733\n0.983 Lisa reads two-digit groups until she has chosen three class members. Each random number may only\ncontribute one class member.\nThe first random number 0.943 is read as the numbers 94 and 43. Neither of these corresponds to the\nstudents\u2019 assigned numbers (01 to 31).\nThe random number 0.230 is read as 23 and 30. Although both of these numbers corresponds to a student,\nonly the first number, 23, will be used. The first student will be number 23.\nThe random number 0.046 is read as 04 and 46 which corresponds to student 04. The second student will be\nstudent number 4.\nThe third student will correspond to the number 14 which is read from the random number 0.514 (since there\nis no student numbered 51).\nThe three names that correspond to the two-digit numbers 23, 04 and 14 will form Lisa\u2019s group. If she needed\nto, Lisa could have generated more random numbers. 7.3 Collecting Data 735\nTRY IT 3\nA fitness studio plans to purchase new equipment and wants to conduct a survey of its membership. There\nare over 700 members and the studio wishes to survey only a portion of this membership. Upon purchasing a\nmembership, every member has been assigned a 3 digit membership number. Decribe how the studio can\nuse the membership numbers to select a simple random sample of 80 members.\nShow answer\nA random number generator is used to generate a list of three digit numbers. Each random number that is\ngenerated will be compared with the membership numbers. If the number has been assignd to a member then\nthat member will be one of the survey group. If the random number has not been assigned then the next\nrandom number is considered until 80 members have been selected.\nSystematic Sampling\nSystematic sampling is where the first sample member from a larger population is selected according\nto a random starting point. Additional sample members are then selected based on a fixed interval. The\ninterval is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. If the population\nconsists of 500 members and the desired sample size is 50, then the interval would be 500/50 = 10.\nEvery tenth member of the population would be part of the sample.\nEXAMPLE 4\nA high school counsellor is conducting a survey of the graduating class which consists of 1243 students.\nDescribe how the counsellor can select a systematic sample of 50 students.\nSolution\nThe counsellor can interview 50 students. The interval is calculated as 1243 students/50 = 24.86 which\nrounds up to 25. This determines the interval increment as 25 so every 25th student will be in the sample.\nTo obtain the sample, the counsellor accesses the alphabetical list of graduates and generates a random\nnumber. Suppose the number is 03. The counsellor will interview the 3rd student on the list followed by every\n25th student on the list: This will yield a sample of student 3, 28, 53, 78, and so on until 50 names have been\nchosen.\nTRY IT 4\nA fitness studio plans to purchase new equipment and wants to conduct a survey of its membership. There\nare over 700 members and the studio wishes to survey only a portion of this membership. Upon purchasing a 736 7. Data Analysis I\nmembership, every member has been assigned a 4 digit membership number. Decribe how the studio can\nuse the membership numbers to select a systematic sample of 80 members.\nShow answer\nSince 80 members are needed for the survey, the total number of members will be divided by 80. Assume\nthere are 724 members, then 724/80 = 9.05 which rounds to an increment of 9. This determines the increment\nfor the intervals. A list of 3-digit random numbers is generated to determine the first member in the survey\ngroup and every 9th member will be included in the survey group. If the first member has a number 546,\nthen every 9th member counting from 546 will be chosen. When the end of the membership list is reached the\nincrements will continue counting from the beginning of the list unil 80 members are selected.\nCluster Sampling\nTo choose a cluster sample, divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some\nof the clusters. Every member from each of the selected clusters will be in the cluster sample. This type\nof sampling works best in populations that can be grouped into distinct groups. In a 50 floor apartment\nbuilding, each floor could represent a cluster. In a hockey league, each team could be a cluster.\nEXAMPLE 5\nA textbook publisher plans to conduct a survey of the faculty at a college campus. There are 23 departments\nat the college. Describe how the publisher can use the departments to select four cluster samples.\nSolution\nLet each department represents one cluster. The publisher numbers the departments from one to twenty-three\nand randomly selects 4 numbers which determine the four departments. Only these four departments will\nform the cluster sample and all faculty within the four departments (clusters) will be surveyed.\nTRY IT 5\nA textbook publisher plans to conduct a survey of the students at a college campus. There are 45 program\nareas ranging from 18 to 40 students in each program. Decribe how the publisher can use the program areas\nto select a cluster sample of at least 100 students.\nShow answer\nThe publisher numbers the program areas from one to forty-five and generates random numbers. The first\nrandom number is used to determine the first program area (cluster). Additional random numbers are assigned\nto clusters until there are at least 100 students for the survey. Only the students in the selected programs\n(clusters) will be surveyed.\nCluster sampling can reduce the need for resources and may be more efficient. Disadvantages are that it 7.3 Collecting Data 737\ncan introduce biases or it may not represent the total population. In example 5, perhaps the textbook\npublisher is seeking feedback on its textbooks. If one or more of the chosen clusters does not use\ntextbooks then the results may not be reliable.\nConvenience Sampling\nA type of sampling that is non-random is called convenience sampling. Convenience sampling involves\nusing results that are readily available or convenient.\nEXAMPLE 6\nA computer software developer seeks to determine which of its new video games are the most popular among\nfemales. Describe how the developer can select a convenience sample.\nSolution\nThe developer can conduct a marketing study by going to a local electronic gaming store and ask all female\nshoppers as they enter the store if they will participate in a 3 minute survey on video games.\nTRY IT 6\nA fitness studio plans to purchase new equipment and wants to conduct a survey of its membership. There\nare over 700 members and the studio wishes to survey 100 of its members. Decribe how the studio can select\na convenience sample of 80 members.\nShow answer\nThe studio owner prepares a survey and distributes it to all members who visit the studio over a 3-day period.\nThis form of sampling may be appealing due to its convenience but the results can be misleading. This\ntype of surveying may be good in some cases but it can also be highly biased (favor certain outcomes)\nin others.\nEXAMPLE 7\nA study is done to determine the average tuition that undergraduate students pay per semester. Each student in\nthe following samples is asked how much tuition he or she paid for the Fall semester. What is the type of\nsampling in each case? (simple random, systematic, cluster, or convenience)\na. A random number generator is used to select a student from the alphabetically numbered email\nlisting of all undergraduate students in the Fall semester. Starting with that student, every 50th 738 7.

Common problems to be aware of include: 7.3 Collecting Data 739\n1. Nonrepresentative samples: A sample must be representative of the population under study.\nA sample that is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not\nrepresentative of the population give results that are inaccurate and not valid. An example of\na biased sample would be a survey on violence in sports where only the female students in a\ncoed high school are surveyed.\n2. Self-selected samples: Surveys where responses are voluntary, such as call-in surveys, are\noften unreliable.\n3. Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are better,\nif possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to\ndraw conclusions. Examples would include crash testing of cars or medical testing for rare\nconditions.\n4. Undue influence: collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the response.\nAn example would be conducting a taste test of two sodas where one is refrigerated and the\nother is served at room temperature.\n5. Non-response or refusal of a subject to participate: The collected responses may no longer be\nrepresentative of the population. Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions may\nanswer surveys, which can affect the results. As an example, reviewers on Internet travel\nsites may not be representative of the entire population.\n6. Misleading use of data: Be aware of improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of\ncontext.\nKey Concepts\nWhen conducting a survey we can choose from several sampling methods:\n\u2022 Simple random sampling is where a member of the population is equally as likely to be\nchosen as any other member from the population.\n\u2022 Systematic sampling is where the first sample member from a larger population is selected\naccording to a random starting point. Additional sample members are then selected based on\na fixed interval.\n\u2022 Cluster sampling is where the population is divided into clusters (groups) and\nthen a specific number of clusters is randomly selected. Every member from\neach of the selected clusters will be in the cluster sample.\n\u2022 Convenience sampling is where the selection is made from a part of the population that is\neasy to access. 740 7.

A study is done to determine the food outlet preferences for all students living on campus in\nthe fall semester. Each student in the sample will be asked the same set of 10 questions.\nFour different sampling techniques are described below. What is the type of sampling in each\ncase? (simple random, systematic, cluster, or convenience).\na. There are 8 different student residences on campus. Two residences are randomly\nselected and every student living in those two residences is surveyed.\nb. The surnames of all students living on campus are arranged alphabetically and\nnumbered from 1 to n (where n is the number of students living on campus). A 7.3 Collecting Data 741\nrandom number generator is used to determine a number between 1 and 50. This\nnumber is matched to a student with the same number. Starting with that student,\nevery 50th student is chosen until the required number of students is chosen for the\nsample.\nc. One of the food outlets is chosen by drawing one outlet name. Over a four hour\nperiod one day, four helpers stop all students entering that food outlet and if they\nlive on campus they are administered the survey.\nd. A computer is used to generate random numbers that have the same format as the\nstudents\u2019 ID numbers. Random numbers are generated until 100 random numbers\nare matched by student number to a student living on campus. These 100 students\nare contacted and arrangements are made for the interviewer to meet with the\nstudent.\n5.

Determine the sampling technique: simple random sampling, systematic sampling,\ncluster or convenience. Select the sample to be surveyed.\n\u25e6 Cluster sampling will be used. There are 12 sections of upgrading math during the\nwinter semester at College ABC. Each of these represents a cluster. The clusters\nwill be numbered 3-14 and three clusters will be selected by rolling three die. The\ntotal of the three die will be matched with the corresponding cluster.Upon\ncompletion of this step the three selected clusters are cluster numbers 5, 9 and 14.\n4. Collect the data using an appropriate instrument (interview, paper questionnaire,\ninternet,\u2026). Record the responses in a frequency table.\n\u25e6 Permission to visit these three classes will be obtained by contacting the instructors\nvia email. Each cluster will be visited on a test day when attendance tends to be\nmost reliable. All students in each cluster will be asked to complete a three\nquestion paper survey. Three frequency tables will be created to organize the\nresults. In total 86 students will be surveyed.a) Which of the following support(s)\ndo you access while you are enrolled in upgrading math at College ABC?

Data Analysis I\nBar Graphs\nThe following three graphs were created using the Chart feature in Excel.\nBar Graph#1 depicts the number of students on the horizontal axis and the type of\nsupport on the vertical axis. It is clear from the graph that the support that has been\nused by the most number of students is the internet and by the least number of\nstudents is a tutor.\nBar Graph#1\nBar Graph#2 depicts the total number of students using the support as compared\nagainst the number of students preferring the support. Forty-three students in total\nhave used the math lab whereas twenty-seven of these would choose the math lab\nfirst for support. Although fifty-two students have accessed the internet for support,\nonly twenty-four would choose this type of support first. The support that is most\npreferred is the math lab; least preferred is the tutor. 7.4 Survey Creation 747\nBar Graph#2\nBar Graph#3 depicts the amount of hours per day, on average, that students spend\nstudying math.\nBar Graph#3\nPie Graphs\nGraph#4 depicts which type of math support is most preferred by the students.

As an example, consider Company ABC where the average (mean) salary is $55,000/year.\nAn employee earning $38,000/year might feel unjustly treated or at the very least the employee might\nexplore the reasons for the substantial difference. If in the process the employee learns that the median\nsalary at his workplace is $26,000/year the employee would learn that relative to everyone else this\nemployee\u2019s salary is in the upper half of the employee group.\nTo provide additional comparison the employee could consider other measures of position or location.\nTwo such measures are percentiles and quartiles.\nPercentiles\nPercentiles are useful for comparing values. If a data item is in the 75th percentile then three-quarters\nof the values are less than this value. This is not to be confused with a score of 75%, which is\nsomething very different. A student could score 35% on an exam but be in the 75th percentile. This\nmeans that relative to the rest of the class the student had a score that was higher than 75% of the\nstudents.\nPercentiles\nth\nPercentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. A data item is said to be in the k percentile of a data set if\nk% of the data items are less than the item.\nth\nThe notation P can be used to represent the k percentile. A data set can be divided into one hundred\nk\nth\nequal parts by ninety-nine percentiles P , P , P , \u2026 P . The 60 percentile would be denoted P .\n1 2 3 99 60\nIf an item is in the 60th percentile, then 60 percent of the data items are less than this item.\nConsider a set of math exam scores. A student scoring in the 60th percentile achieved a score equal to\nor higher than 60 percent of the other students. This does not mean that the student scored 60% on the\nexam. Perhaps the student\u2019s score was 78%, which would mean that 60 percent of the other students in\nthe class had exam scores less than (or equal to) 78%.\nIt is important to note that since percentiles divide a data set into one hundred equal parts, percentiles\nare best used with large data sets. Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. For a\nspecified percentile P if you were to say that k percent of the data values are less (and not the same or\nk\nless) than a specified data value, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is\nnot significant.\nRefer again to the employee earning $38,000/year at Company ABC. If the employee learns that their\nsalary is in the 90th percentile then 90 percent of the other employees at Company ABC have a salary\nless than (or possibly equal to) this salary. In relation to the other employees this salary ranks among\nthe upper portion of the employee group.\nPercentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles on\nentrance exams. Rather than set one value as an acceptance score, a university may set a percentile 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 753\ntarget. Perhaps all students scoring in the the 80th percentile or above will receive an acceptance letter.\nEvery year there is likely to be a different acceptance score. Students will be accepted based on their\nscore relative to all other applicants.\nDetermining Percentiles\nth\nTo determine the k percentile that is represented by a particular data item x, the following formula can be\nused.\nStep 1: If necessary order the data values from smallest to largest.\nStep 2: Determine the total number of data values, n. This will be the denominator in the formula.\nStep 3: Count the number of data values that are less than the value x. This will be the value in the numerator\nof the formula.\nStep 4: Calculate the percentile, k, that is associated with a score of x using the formula.\nEXAMPLE 1\nA class set of exam scores for 48 students are ranked from lowest to highest. Determine the percentiles\nassociated with the scores of a) 39% b) 60% c) 94%.\n39 54 59 65 75 79 84 92\n42 54 60 67 76 80 86 92\n43 55 60 69 76 80 88 94\n48 57 60 69 77 82 88 95\n51 57 63 72 77 83 89 96\n51 59 65 72 78 83 91 97\nSolution\na) For a score of 39%:\nStep 1: The data values are already ordered from smallest to largest.\nStep 2: Determine the number of data values. Since there are 48 students n = 48.\nStep 3: We count 0 data values that are less than 39 754 8 Data Analysis 2\nStep 4: Calculate the percentile, k, that is associated with a score of x using the formula\nk = (0/48)*100% = 0%.\nThis means that the student who scored 39% is in the 0 percentile. A score of 39% is not higher than any other score.\nb) For a score of 60%:\nThere are 13 scores lower than 60% so k = (13/48)*100% = 27%. A score of 60% is in the 27th percentile which\nmeans that 27% (or just over one-fourth) of the test scores are less than 60%.\nc) For a score of 94%:\nThere are 44 scores less than 94% so k = (44/48)*100% = 92%. A score of 94% is in the 92nd percentile which means\nthat 92% of the test scores are less than 94%.\nTRY IT 1\nA set of assignment scores for a class of 32 students are provided in the table below. Determine the\npercentiles associated with the scores of a) 61% b) 79% c) 98%.\n72 65 85 52 61 49 65 82\n55 99 58 79 98 79 58 93\n88 48 97 74 65 85 71 75\n99 39 60 96 80 70 54 77\nShow answer\na) 61% is 28th percentile b) 79% is 59th percentile c) 98% is 91st percentile\nQuartiles\nQuartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q , is\n1\nth th\nthe same as the 25 percentile, and the third quartile, Q , is the same as the 75 percentile. The median\n3\nis a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same as or smaller than the\nmedian, and half the values are the same as or larger than the median. The median can be called both\nth\nthe second quartile Q and the 50 percentile.\n2\nQuartiles\nQuartiles divide the data set into four equal parts. 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 755\nth th\nThe first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25 percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the same as the 75\nth\npercentile. The median can be called both the second quartile, Q2 , and the 50 percentile.\nAs with the median, the quartiles may or may not be part of the data set.\nAs indicated in Figure 1 each quartile divides a data set into four equal parts so that one-fourth of the\ndata set is located in each part.\nFig. 1\nDetermining Quartiles\nWe will consider two methods for determining quartiles. As with percentiles, the data values must first\nbe ordered from smallest to largest. The first method involves dividing the data set into four equal\nparts. The second method involves the use of formulas.\nDetermining Quartiles: Method 1\nStep 1: Order the data from smallest to largest.\nStep 2: Determine the number of data values n.\nStep 3: Determine the median (Q2) of the data set. This will divide the data set into two equal parts.\nStep 4: Determine Q1. This will divide the first half of the data set into two equal parts.\nStep 5: Determine Q3. This will divide the second half of the data set into two equal parts.\nNote: The median and the quartiles may not be actual observations from the data set.\nMethod 1\nConsider the following data set: 756 8 Data Analysis 2\n15 4 20 8 3 12 14 11 7 2 6 23 16\nStep 1: To determine the quartiles, order the data values from smallest to largest:\n2 3 4 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 16 20 23\nStep 2: The number of data values is 13.\nStep 3: Determine the median, which measures the \u201ccentre\u201d of the data. It is the number that separates\nordered data into halves. Half the observations are the same number or smaller than the median, and\nhalf the observations are the same number or larger.\nSince there are 13 observations, the median will be in the seventhh position. The median, and therefore\nthe 2nd quartile Q , is eleven. The median is often referred to as the \u201cmiddle observation,\u201d but it is\n2\nimportant to note that it does not actually have to be one of the observed values.\nStep 4: The first quartile, Q , is the middle value of the lower half of the data.\n1\nTo determine the first quartile, Q , consider the lower half of the data observations:\n1\n2 3 4 6 7 8\nSince there are six observations, the middle observation will be the average of the third and fourth data\nvalues or (4 + 6)/2 = 5 therefore Q is 5\n1\nStep 5: The third quartile, Q , is the middle value of the upper half of the data.\n3\nTo determine the third quartile, Q , consider the upper half of the data observations:\n3\n12 14 15 16 20 23\nSince there are six observations, the middle observation will be the average of 15 and 16 , or 15.5\ntherefore Q is 15.5.\n3\nFigure 2 illustrates the three quartiles, which divide the data set into four equal parts. 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 757\nFig. 2\nThe number 4.5 is the first quartile, Q . One-fourth of the entire set of observations lie below 4.5 and\n1\nthree-fourths of the data observations lie above 4.5.\nThe third quartile, Q , is 15.5. Three-fourths (75%) of the ordered data set lie below 15.5. One-fourth\n3\n(25%) of the ordered data set lie above 15.5.\nIt is important to note that a quartile may not be a data observation. Sometimes there may be a need to\naverage or weight the data values when determining the quartiles.\nA second method for determining quartiles is to use a formula to determine the position\nof each quartile. This is especially useful when there is a large number of data items.\nDetermining Quartiles: Method 2\nQuartile Formula\nThe following formulas, where n is the number of data values, can be used to determine the position of the\nthree quartiles.\nIt is important to note that these results indicate the positions of the quartiles, not the actual data obervations.\nIf, for example, the calculation gives Q1=3, this indicates that the first quartile will be the data obervation in\nthe 3rd position. If Q3 = 32, this indicates that the third quartile will be the data observation in the 32nd\nposition.\nStep 1: Order the data from smallest to largest.\nStep 2: Determine n.\nStep 3: Use the formula to determine the position for the median (Q2) of the data set. Count from left to right\nto determine the corresponding data value. If the position is a fraction then two data values will need to be\nweighted to determine the median value.\nStep 4: Use the formula to determine the position for the first quartile Q1 of the data set. Count from left to\nright to determine the corresponding data value. If the position is a fraction then two data values will need to\nbe weighted to determine the value of Q1. 758 8 Data Analysis 2\nStep 5: Use the formula to determine the position for the third quartile Q3 of the data set. Count from left to\nright to determine the corresponding data value. If the position is a fraction then two data values will need to\nbe weighted to determine the value of Q3.\nMethod 2:\nConsider the following data set:\n15 4 20 8 3 12 14 11 7 2 6 23 16\nStep 1: To determine the quartiles, order the data values from smallest to largest:\n2 3 4 6 7 8 11 12 14 15 16 20 23\nStep 2: The number of data values is 13.\nStep 3: Use the formula to determine the position for the median (Q ) of the data set.\n2\nCount from left to right to determine the corresponding data value in the 7th position. The\ncorresponding value is 11.\nStep 4: Use the formula to determine the position for the first quartile (Q ) of the data set.\n1\nSince 3.5 is a fraction, the first quartile will be the average of the two data values that are in the 3rd and\n4th positions. Count from left to right to determine the corresponding data values. The data value 4 is in\nthe 3rd position and the data value 6 is in the 4th position so these will be averaged (4 + 6)/2 = 5. The\nfirst quartile will be 5.\nStep 5: Use the formula to determine the position for the third quartile (Q ) of the data set.\n3 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 759\nSince 10.5 is a fraction, the third quartile will be the average of the two data values that are in the 10th\nand 11th positions. Count from left to right to determine the corresponding data values. The data value\n15 is in the 10th position and the data value 16 is in the 11th position so these will be averaged (15 +\n16)/2 = 15.5. The third quartile will be 15.5.\nFigure 3 illustrates the three quartiles, which divide the data set into four equal parts.\nFig. 3\nEXAMPLE 2\nA shoe store wanted to determine the popularity of different shoe sizes for women\u2019s tennis shoes. It\nplanned to place its next order using this information. In a five day period it sold nine pairs of women\u2019s\ntennis shoes in the following sizes: 7, 8, 11, 10, 7, 6, 9, 10, 7\nSolution\nMethod 1:\nTo determine the quartiles:\n1. Order the shoe sizes from smallest to largest: 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11\n2. Count the number of values: n = 9\n3. Determine Q2, the median, which is the middle observation. Since there are nine data\nobservations (shoe sizes) the median, or second quartile, will be the 5th data value. The 5th data\nvalue is 8. 760 8 Data Analysis 2\n4. Determine the first quartile Q1. It will be the middle observation of the lower half of data values. This will be\nthe average of the 2nd and 3rd data values so (7 +7)/2 = 7.\n5. Determine the third quartile Q3. This will be the middle observation of the upper half. This will be the average of\nthe 7th and 8th data values so (10+10)/2 = 10\nMethod 2:\nThe formulas can be used to determine the quartiles.\n1. Order the shoe sizes from smallest to largest: 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11 .\n2. Determine the number of data values, n. n = 9\n3. Use the formula to determine the median. The median , or second quartile, can be\ndetermined as follows:\nth\nCounting from left to right, the 5 data value is 8. The median, or 2nd quartile Q2, is 8.\n4 & 5. The first and third quartiles can be determined as follows: 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 761\nth\nThe first quartile is the 2.5th data value. To determine the 2.5 data value we must take the average of the\n2nd and 3rd data values. The 2nd data value is 7 and the 3rd data value is 7 so (7+7)/2 = 7.\nThe first quartile, Q1 = 7\nThe third quartile is the 7.5th data value. This will be the average of the 7th and 8th data values. The 7th data\nvalue is 10 and the 8th data value is also 10 so (10+10)/2 = 10.\nThe third quartile, Q3 = 10\nWe can see that Q2 = 8 splits the data set into two halves. Q1= 7 is the middle value of the lower half of the data\nset and Q3 = 10 is the middle value of the upper half of the data set.\nIn Example 2 the number of data items was odd. When n is odd the median or Q will be one of the\n2\ndata observations. When n is odd the formula for finding quartiles is straight forward.\nTRY IT 2\nDetermine the quartiles for the following temperature data that was recorded over a 3-week period in May:\nShow answer\nQ2 = 21; Q1 = 18; Q3 = 25 762 8 Data Analysis 2\nIt is important to note that a quartile may not be a data observation. When the number of data values n\nis even the median or Q will not be one of the actual data observations. As a result, when n is even an\n2\nadjustment must be made to the value of n that is to be used in the formula to determine the first and\nthird quartiles.\nMethod 1:\nConsider the following data set:\n1; 11.5; 6; 7.2; 4; 8; 9; 10; 6.8; 8.3; 2; 2; 10; 1\nStep 1: To determine the quartiles, order the data values from smallest to largest:\n1 1 2 2 4 6 6.8 7.2 8 8.3 9 10 10 11.5\nStep 2: The number of data values is 14\nStep 3: Determine the median, which measures the \u201ccentre\u201d of the data. It is the number that separates\nordered data into halves. Half the observations are the same number or smaller than the median, and\nhalf the observations are the same number or larger.\nSince there are 14 observations, the median lies between the seventh observation, 6.8, and the eighth\nobservation, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two. Median = (6.8 +\n7.2)/2 = 7\nThe median, and therefore the 2nd quartile Q , is seven. It is important to note that the median is not\n2\nactually one of the observed data values.\nStep 4: The first quartile, Q , is the middle value of the lower half of the data.\n1\nTo determine the first quartile, Q , consider the lower half of the data observations:\n1\n1 1 2 2 4 6 6.8.\nth\nSince there are seven observations, the middle observation will be the 4th item. The middle or 4 item\nof these data observations is 2.\nStep 5: The third quartile, Q , is the middle value of the upper half of the data.\n3\nTo determine the third quartile, Q , consider the upper half of the data observations:\n3\n7.2 8 8.3 9 10 10 11.5.\nSince there are seven observations, the middle observation will be the 4th item in the upper half. The\nmiddle item of these data observations is 9. 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 763\nFigure 4 illustrates the three quartiles, which divide the data set into four equal parts.\nFig. 4\nThe number 2 is the first quartile, Q . One-fourth of the entire set of observations lie below 2 and\n1\nthree-fourths of the data observations lie above 2.\nThe third quartile, Q , is 9. Three-fourths (75%) of the ordered data set lie below 9. One-fourth (25%)\n3\nof the ordered data set lie above 9.\nMethod 2:\nConsider the following data set:\n1; 11.5; 6; 7.2; 4; 8; 9; 10; 6.8; 8.3; 2; 2; 10; 1\nStep 1: To determine the quartiles, order the data values from smallest to largest:\n1 1 2 2 4 6 6.8 7.2 8 8.3 9 10 10 11.5\nStep 2: The number of data values is 14 so n is an even number.\nStep 3: Use the formula to determine the position of Q , the median. The position will be (14 + 1)/2 =\n2\n7.5. This means that the median, or Q , will be in the 7.5th observation or halfway between the 7th and\n2\n8th position. The observation 6.8 is in the 7th position and the observation 7.2 is in the 8th position\ntherefore the average of these (6.8 + 7.2)/ 2 is the median or Q .\n2\nNote that the median is not an actual observation in the data set. If we use the formula to find Q and\n1\nQ 3 then we must adjust \u201cn\u201d to include this additional item so in effect \u201cn\u201d will be 15. This is done only\nwhen determining the positions of Q1 and Q3 (and not for determining the position of Q2)\nStep 4: Use the formula to determine the position of Q , the first quartile. Remember than n will now\n1\nbe 15, not 14. The position will be (15 + 1)/4 = 4 th. This means that Q will be in the 4th\n1\nposition. Counting from the left, the data value 2 is in the 4th position so Q = 2.\n1\nStep 5: Use the formula to determine the position of Q , the third quartile. Remember than n will now\n3\nbe 15, not 14. The position will be 3(15 + 1)/4 = 12th. This means that Q will be in the 12th position.\n3\nRefer to Figure 5. Counting from the left, we include the median value of 7, to determine that the data\nvalue in the 12th position. This value is 9 so Q will be 9.\n3 764 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 5\nIt is also important to recognize that the median of 7 is not an actual data value in this set. It was\nincluded in Figure 5 to illustrate that its position must be counted when determing the position of the\nthird quartile. It is not actually part of the data set. The actual data set is illustrated in Figure 6 (and\nFigure 4).\nFig. 6\nConsider Figure 7 where the data set that has an even number of data values: 1 2 4\n5\nFig. 7\nIn this data set Q = 1.5, Q = 3, and Q = 4.5 This illustrates that quartile values need not be actual\n1 2 3\nvalues in the data set. The second quartile Q is 3 which is the average of the data values 2 and 4.\n2\nSimilarily the first quartile of 1.5 is the average of two data values 1 and 2 and the third quartile of 4.5\nis the average of the two data values 4 and 5. Determining the quartile values can become complex as it\nmay require different weightings of the data values but this is beyond the scope of this textbook.\nExample 3 illustrates two techniques for determining quartiles when the number of data observations is\neven. 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 765\nEXAMPLE 3\nConsider again the shoe store and a different week. Over a five day period it sold ten pairs of tennis\nshoes in the following sizes:\n6, 8, 11, 10, 7, 6, 9, 10, 8, 9\nNote that there is an even number of data values n = 10\nSolution\nMethod 1:\nTo determine the quartiles:\n1. Rank the sizes from smallest to largest: 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11 and divide the\ndata set into four equal quarters.\n2. n = 10\n3. Start with the median which is the middle observation. The median, or second quartile, will lie\nbetween the 5th and 6th data values. The 5th data value is 8 and the 6th data value is 9 so the average\nof 8 and 9, or 8.5, is the median.\n4. Determine the first quartile Q1. It will be the middle observation of the lower half of data values.\nThis is the 3rd data value or the observation of 7.\n5. Determine the third quartile Q3. This will be the middle observation of the upper half. This will be the\ndata observation of 10.\nNote that each quartile divides the data values such that there are an equal number of data values in each\nof the four sections.\nMethod 2:\nAn alternative is to use the formulas to determine the quartiles.\nTo determine the quartiles:\n1. Rank the sizes from smallest to largest: 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11\n2. n = 10\n3. Determine the position of the median using the formula. 766 8 Data Analysis 2\nThe 5.5th data value will be the average of the 5th and 6th data values. The 5th data value is 8 and the\n6th data value is 9 so\n(8 + 9) /2 = 8.5 The median or Q2 is 8.5.\nNote: Q2 is not one of the actual data values. In this example Q2 is the 5.5th data value or 8.5. It is the data value\nthat lies between the 5th and 6th data values but it is not one of the original data values.\n4 & 5. Determine the first quartile Q1 and the third quartile Q3.\nSince the number of data values n is even the median or Q2 is not one of the actual data values so when we use the\nformula to determine Q1 and Q3 we must increase the value of n by 1. In effect the number of data values has\nincreased by one and therefore the value of n in the formula must be increased by 1. This is done only when\ndetermining the positions of Q1 and Q3 (and not for determining the position of Q2)\nIn this example, when determining Q1 and Q3 the original value of n = 10 will now be increased by 1. The new\nnumber for n to be used in the formula will be n = 11. Using the formula, the first and third quartile positions can be\ndetermined as follows:\nUsing the results from the formula we count to get the 3rd and 9th data values. When determining these\nvalues be sure to include and count the position occupied by the new median value of 8.5. The 3rd\ndata value is 7 and the 9th data value is 10.\nNote that Method 1 and Method 2 yield the same results.\nWe have seen that either of Method 1 or Method 2 will produce the same quartile values although the\nformula method can be less intuitive when n is even. 8.1 Percentiles and Quartiles 767\nTRY IT 3\nUse either technique to determine the quartiles for the following temperature data that was recorded over the\nmonth of April:\nShow answer\nQ2 = 18.5 Q1 = 15; Q3 = 22\nEXAMPLE 4\nConsider the data set: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15. Determine the three quartiles using\neither technique.\nMethod 1:\nStep 1: Order the data values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15\nStep 2: n = 16\nStep 3: The median will be the average of 9 and 10, so 9.5. This is not one of the observed values.\nStep 4: Q1 is the value that splits the lower half, which will be the average of 6 and 7, so 6.5.\nStep 5: Q3 is the value that splits the upper half, which will be the average of 12 and 13, so 12.5.\nMethod 2:\nStep 1: Order the data values 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 14, 15\nStep 2: n = 16\nStep 3: Use the formula (16 + 1) /2 = 8.5. The median will be in the 8.5th position. This is the average of the\n8th value of 9 and the 9th value of 10 so the median is 9.5\nStep 4 and 5: Since n is even, we will use a value of 17, not 16, in the formulas to determine Q1 and Q3.\nQ1 will be (17 + 1)/4 = 4.5 th. This means that Q1 will be in the 4.5th position or the average of the 4th and\n5th data values. The 4th value is 6 and the 5th value is 7 so Q1= 6.5.\nQ3 will be 3(17 + 1)/4 = 13.5 th. This means that Q3 will be in the 13.5th position or the average of the 13th 768 8 Data Analysis 2\nand 14th data values. Including the median\u2019s position when we count, the 13th value is 12 and the 14th value\nis 13 so Q3 = (12 + 13)/2 = 12.5.\nNote that these identical results were obtained without using the formulas. It is also important to recognize\nthat the median of 9.5 is not an actual data value in this set. It serves only to divide the data set into two equal\nhalves and it is not actually part of the data set.\nTRY IT 4\nAn athlete was training for a race and logged the following distances (in km) over a 36 day period.

They indicate where the data clusters.\nConsider student A\u2019s scores on five tests: 32% 95% 89% 74% 55% The mean, or average, is (32\n+ 95 + 89 + 74 + 55)/5 = 69% and the median is 74%.\n773 774 8 Data Analysis 2\nConsider student B\u2019s scores on the same five tests: 68% 69% 72% 74% 62% The mean, or\naverage, is (68 + 69 + 72 + 74 + 62)/5 = 69% and the median is 69%.\nBoth student\u2019s have the same test average of 69% but there is a substantial difference in the spread or\ndispersion of their scores. Student A\u2019s test scores range from a low score of 32% to a high score of\n95% so the spread in marks is 63 percentage points. Student B\u2019s test scores range from a low score of\n62% to a high score of 74% so the spread in marks is 12 percentage points.\nWhen we analyze data it is important to consider how dispersed or spread out the data values are. In\nthis section we will consider two measures of dispersion.\nRange\nRange is one measure of dispersion. A measure of dispersion is used to describe the spread of data.\nRange\nThe range indicates the total spread in data values. It is the difference between the highest and lowest data\nvalues.\nRange = highest data value \u2013 lowest data value\nEXAMPLE 1\nThe table shows the daily high temperature (\u00b0C) over a three week period.\nDetermine the highest temperature, lowest temperature, and the range in daily high temperatures over the\nthree weeks.\nSolution\nThe highest temperature was 29\u00ba, the lowest temperature was 16\u00b0, and the range in temperatures was 29 \u2013 16\n= 13\u00ba. 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 775\nTRY IT 1\nThe table shows the test score for a group of fourteen students.\nDetermine the highest test score, the lowest test score, and the range in test scores for the group of 14\nstudents.\nShow answer\nThe highest score was 89%, the lowest score was 56%, and the range in scores was 33%.\nAn advantage of using the range as a measure of dispersion is that it involves a simple calculation. A\ndisadvantage is that the range only provides a measure between the highest and lowest values so it\ndisregards all other data values. If the highest or lowest data value is an outlier then the range will not\nprovide a true measure of the spread in the typical values.\nEXAMPLE 2\nA student wrote five tests and earned the following five scores:\n92% 95% 89% 94% 35%\n1. Determine the mean, median and the range for these five scores.\n2. Which of the five scores is an outlier?\n3. Remove the outlier and recalculate the mean, median and the range for the four remaining scores.\n4. Comparing the results for the five scores versus four scores, which of the three measures was\nleast impacted by the outlier?\n5. Comparing the results for the five scores versus four scores, which of the three measures was\nmost impacted by the outlier?\nSolution\n1. The student\u2019s mean score: (92 + 95 + 89 + 94 + 35) / 5 = 81%\nThe median score is 92%.\nThe range in marks is 95% \u2013 35% = 60%.\n2. The score of 35% is an outlier.\n3. The student\u2019s mean score: (92 + 95 + 89 + 94) / 4 = 92.5%\nThe median score is 93%.\nThe range in marks is 95% \u2013 89% = 6%. 776 8 Data Analysis 2\n4. The median was least impacted by the removal of the outlier.\n5. The range was most impacted by the outlier.\nTRY IT 2\nThe following seven values are salaries at a local computer company.\n$62,000 $95, 000 $120,000 $101, 000 $99,000 $98,000 $110,000\n1. Determine the mean, median and the range for these seven salaries.\n2. Which of the seven salaries is an outlier?\n3. Remove the outlier and recalculate the mean, median and the range for the six remaining salaries.\n4. Comparing the results for the seven versus six salaries, which of the three measures was least\nimpacted by the outlier?\n5. Comparing the results for the seven versus six salaries, which of the three measures was most\nimpacted by the outlier?\nShow answer\n1. mean salary $97,857; median salary $99,000; range in salaries $58,000\n2. $62,000\n3. mean salary $103, 833; median salary $100,000; range in salaries $25,000\n4. the median\n5. the range\nRefer back to Example 2 and the measures that were calculated for five test scores.The student\u2019s mean\nscore is 81% and the range in marks is 60%. The range of 60% does not capture the fact that if the\noutlier is removed then there is a spread of only 6% for the four remaining data values. The range\ndepends on only the highest and lowest data values. The existence of an outlier can result in a\nmisleading representation of the spread in data values.\nAn alternative measure of dispersion is called the standard deviation. It depends on all data values\nrather than on only the highest and lowest data values.\nStandard Deviation\nStandard deviation measures the dispersion of the data values around the mean. Unlike the range,\nits value depends on every data value in the data set. The standard deviation is found by determining\nhow much each data value differs from the mean. 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 777\nWhat does the standard deviation actually tell us? Consider two sets of test scores:\nSet A: 76% 74% 86% 84% 85%\nSet B: 53% 95% 62% 99% 96%\nRefer to Figure 1. For both sets the mean is 81%. If we plot the scores (indicated by the *) on a scale of\n0% to 100% we see that the scores in Set A are much less spread out around the mean. The scores\nfrom Set B are much more dispersed.\nFig. 1\nIf we compare the standard deviations for the two data sets we should find that although the mean is the\nsame, the standard deviation for Set B will be greater since the data is more widely spread out from the\nmean.\nPopulation versus Sample Standard Deviation\nWhen working with standard deviation it is important to distinguish whether you are working with the\nentire population or a sample of the population. Statisticians generally survey a sample of the\npopulation because it is often impossible to survey the entire population. As an example, assume your\nuniversity wants to determine food preferences for its entire student body. The population would be all\nstudents enrolled in the university. Rather than attempt to survey every student, the university will\nsurvey only a sample.\nThe symbolic representation of standard deviation is different for a population versus a sample. If you\nare working with an entire population, the symbol for standard deviation is the Greek letter sigma, \u03c3.\nThe symbol for the standard deviation of a sample is s. Similarly, the calculation of standard deviation\nis different for a population versus a sample. Unless otherwise indicated in this chapter, we will\nassume that we are working with a sample, rather than an entire population. 778 8 Data Analysis 2\nStandard Deviation Formula\nStandard Deviation Formula for a Population\n2\nThe Greek letter sigma \u2211 is the summation symbol. It indicates that all of the values (x \u2013 \u03bc) must be added.\nStandard Deviation Formula for a Sample\nCalculating the Standard Deviation\nWhen calculating the standard deviation with the aid of a scientific calculator it is helpful to record the\nsteps using a table.\nCalculating Standard Deviation\nWe will use the formula for finding the standard deviation of a sample: 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 779\nTo determine the standard deviation for a sample we will use the following steps :\n1. Find the mean\n2\n2. Create a table with three columns: data value, data value \u2013 mean, (data value \u2013 mean)\n3. Fill in the data value column with all values from the sample\n4. Subtract the mean from each data value: (data value \u2013 mean)\n2\n5. Square the results from step 4: (data value \u2013 mean)\n6. Sum the results in column 3 (from step 5)\n7. Divide the sum (from step 6) by (n \u2013 1)\n8. Find the square root of the result in step 7\nEXAMPLE 3\na) Determine the standard deviation for the sample set A test scores: 76% 74% 86% 84% 85%\nb) Determine the standard deviation for the sample set B test scores: 53% 95% 62% 99%\n96%\nc) Compare the means and standard deviations for Set A and Set B. Which set is more spread out (dispersed)?\nSolution\na) 780 8 Data Analysis 2\nThe standard deviation for Set A is 5.57 (rounded to 2 decimal places)\nb) 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 781\nThe standard deviation for Set B is 21.74 (rounded to 2 decimal places).\nc)\nIn comparing the two data sets A and B:\n\u2022 The means are the same value of 81.\n\u2022 The standard deviation for Set A is s = 5.57 and for Set B it is s = 21.74. The much larger\nstandard deviation for Set B indicates that there is a much greater spread in the data values around\nthe mean of 81%.\nNote that the sum of the middle column (data value \u2013 mean) is 0. This will always be the case. That is\nwhy we must square the values before we add them, as is done in column 3.\nTRY IT 3\nThe average high temperatures (in \u00baC) for one week in April for two different cities in Canada were as\nfollows:\nCity A: 15 19 22 26 21 19 18\nCity B: 6 9 15 18 20 19 21 782 8 Data Analysis 2\na) Calculate the mean high temperature (if necessary round to 2 decimal places) for each city. Which of the\ntwo cities appears to have a wider spread in temperatures around their means?\nb) Calculate the standard deviation for each temperature set (if necessary round to 2 decimal places) to see if\nyour observation is correct.\nShow answer\nThe mean for City A is 20 \u02daC and the mean for City B was 15.43\u02daC.\nThe standard deviation for City A is 3.46 and for City B is 5.80. City B\u2019s temperatures are more widely\nspread out from the mean temperature.\nWe have seen that two measures of spread or dispersion are the range and the standard deviation.\nAlthough the range is a much simpler calculation, it only takes into consideration the highest and\nlowest data values. The existence of an outlier can result in a range that is not truly indicative of the\nspread in data values. The standard deviation is a more complex calculation but takes into consideration\nall data values. It is important to note that technology is often used to calculate the standard deviation\nwhich eliminates the need for tedious calculations.\nEXAMPLE 4\nIn Example 1 the range for the following set of temperature was determined to be 13 \u00baC.\na) Determine the mean and the standard deviation.\nb) Explain why the values for the range and standard deviation are different.\nSolution\na) The mean (average) is 22.29 \u02daC and the standard deviation is 3.86.\nb) The reason for the difference in values is that the range only tells us the difference between the highest and\nlowest temperature whereas the standard deviation tells us how widespread the temperatures are in relation to\nthe mean temperature of 22.29 \u02daC\nTRY IT 4\nRefer back to TRY IT 1 and the test scores for a group of 14 students. The range was determined to be 33. 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 783\nDetermine the mean (rounded to the nearest whole number) and the standard deviation (rounded to the\nnearest 2 decimal places) for this set of test scores.\nShow answer\nThe mean is 72 and the standard deviation is 8.19.\nHistograms and the Dispersion of Data Values\nWe have seen that for two data sets with the same mean, when the standard deviation is larger the data\nvalues are more spread out. A histogram can be used to illustrate the spread of data values.\nConsider a dance competition where teams comprised of seven dancers compete for the prize money in\nseveral different dance categories. There were four teams entered in the elite category. The dancers\nmust be between the ages of 18-24 years old. The age breakdown for the members of the four teams in\nthe elite category is:\nTeam Unity: all seven dancers are age 21\nTeam Harmony: 2 dancers are 20, 3 dancers are 21 and 2 dancers are 22\nTeam Mix: 1 dancer is 19, 2 dancers are 20, 1 dancer is 21, 2 dancers are 22 and 1 dancer is 23\nTeam Extend: 3 dancers are 18, 1 dancer is 21, and 3 dancers are 24\nThe mean age for all four teams is 21 but the standard deviations for each of the four teams are\ndifferent. Team Unity has a standard deviation of 0, Team Harmony has a standard deviation of 0.82,\nTeam Mix has a standard deviation of 1.412 and Team Extend has a standard deviation of 3.\nThe histograms for each of the teams appears in Figures 2a through Figures 2d below. 784 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 2a. Team Unity with s = 0\nIn Figure 2a Team Unity has a standard deviation of 0 since all ages are the same. None of the ages\nspread out from the mean of 21.\nFig. 2b. Team Harmony with s = 0.82\nIn Figure 2b Team Harmony has a standard deviation of 0.82 years. The histogram illustrates that the\nages are closely clustered around the mean of 21. 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 785\nFig. 2c Team Mix with s = 1.41\nIn Figure 2c Team Mix has a standard deviation of 1.41. The histogram illustrates that the data (age)\nspread is greater than for Team Unity and Team Harmony.\nFig. 2d. Team Extend with s = 3\nIn Figure 2d Team Extend has a standard deviation of 3. The histogram clearly illustrates that the ages\nfor this team are the most spread out from the mean of 21.\nEXAMPLE 5\nTen participants in a group fitness class were asked to rank the class on a scale from 1 to 5. Determine the\nmean and standard deviation for the evaluation scores as depicted in the histogram below. 786 8 Data Analysis 2\nSolution 8.2 Measures of Dispersion 787\nThe mean score is 3 and the standard deviation is 1.49\nTRY IT 5\nThe hourly wages for ten employees at a small coffee shop are illustrated in the histogram. Determine the\nmean and standard deviation for the employee hourly wages.\nShow answer\nThe mean is $17.80 and the standard deviation is $1.32\nWe have seen that standard deviation provides us with a measure of the spread of data values in relation\nto the mean. We have learned how to calculate the standard deviation for a data set but we have not\nexplored the significance or meaning of these calculated values. In the next section we will explore the\nsignificance of the calculated values as we consider the relationship between the standard deviation and\nthe distribution of the data values.\nKey Concepts\n\u2022 Two measures of dispersion or spread in data values are:\n\u25e6 Range = highest data value \u2013 lowest data value\n\u25e6 Standard deviation. Unlike the range, its value depends on every data value in the 788 8 Data Analysis 2\ndata set. It is found by determining how much each data value differs from the\nmean.\nGlossary\nhistogram\nrepresents the frequency distribution (number of occurrences) of each data value. The data values are grouped\ninto intervals or \u201cbins\u201d.\noutlier\nA data observation that is deemed to be unusual based on the pattern of the other data values.\nrange\nindicates the total spread in data values. It is the difference between the highest and lowest data values.\nsigma\nis the uppercase Greek letter written \u2211.

Beads are dropped from the top and, when the device is level, bounce either left or right as they\nhit the pegs. Eventually they are collected into bins at the bottom, where the height of bead columns\naccumulated in the bins approximate a normal distribution. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nBean_machine#/)\nIn this section we will explore the normal distribution and the dispersion of data values around the\nmean. We have seen that the standard deviation provides a measure of the dispersion of the data\nvalues around the mean. If the standard deviation is zero then all data vales will equal the mean. The\ngeneral idea seems to be that as the standard deviation increases the data will be more widely dispersed\naround the mean. We have also seen that data can be distributed in a variety of ways. Consider the\nhistograms in Figures 1, 2 & 3. These histograms represent the evaluation scores (on a scale of 1 to 5)\nfor three instructors. In all three cases a group of 10 students provided feedback for each of the\ninstructors.\nFig. 1 Instructor A 8.3 The Normal Curve 795\nFig. 2 Instructor B\nFig. 3 Instructor C\nReferring to Figure 1, Instructor A received each possible score two times. Figure 1 represents a\nuniform distribution since every data value occurs with the same frequency.\nReferring to Figure 2, Instructor B received a mix of scores. Figure 2 represents a skewed distribution\nwhere one tail of the distribution is stretched out more than the other. 796 8 Data Analysis 2\nReferring to Figure 3, Instructor C also received a mix of scores. Figure 3 represents a symmetrical\ndistribution. Data values occur most often in the centre of the distribution and spread out equally on\neither side.\nThe histogram in Figure 3 is symmetric but because it represents a very small sample size it appears to\nbe a series of rectangles stacked side by side. As the sample size increases a symmetrical distribution\nwill become less boxy as illustrated in Figures 4 & 5.\nFig. 4\nFig. 5\nEventually if we consider the entire population the distribution will approach what is called the normal\ndistribution as in Figure 6. This distribution is also called the bell curve.\nFig. 6\nThe normal distribution models many aspects of real life, including height, blood pressure and IQ\nscores. 8.3 The Normal Curve 797\nNormal Distribution\nThe normal distribution is also called the bell curve.\nIn a normal distribution the data values are symmetrical around a vertical line drawn through its centre which\nis also where the mean is located. Half of the data values lie on either side of the mean.\nIn a normal distribution the mean, median and mode will all be equal.\nNormal Distribution and Standard Deviation\nThe normal distribution will have symmetry in relation to the mean but it could be flat or high,\ndepending on the standard deviation. In Figure 7 the means are identical but the distribution in A has a\nsmaller standard deviation. 798 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 7\nThe standard deviation plays an important role in the normal distribution, as described by the\n68-95-99.7 Rule.\n68-95-99.7 Rule\nAccording to the 68-95-99.7 Rule:\n\u2022 Approximately 68% (68.26%) of the data items lie within one standard deviation of the mean.\n\u2022 Approximately 95% (95.44%) of the data items lie within two standard deviations of the mean.\n\u2022 Approximately 99.7% of the data items lie within three standard deviations of the mean.\nFigure 8 depicts the 68-95-99.7 Rule. 8.3 The Normal Curve 799\nFig. 8 68-95-99.7 Rule https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki\nIn simple language what does this rule tell us? Refer to Figure 8 and consider the percentage of data\nitems that lie within one standard deviation (\u03c3) of the mean. This is the region that lies between -1\u03c3\nand 1\u03c3. If 34.1% lie on either side of the mean, then 34.1% + 34.1% = 68.2% or approximately 68% .\nFor a population with a normal distribution, just over two-thirds of the data (68%) will lie within one\nstandard deviation of the mean.\nConsider the percentage of data items that lie within two standard deviations of the mean. This is the\nregion that lies between -2\u03c3 and 2\u03c3. Between -2\u03c3 and 0, we find 13.6% + 34.1% or 47.7% of the data\nvalues. So between -2\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 we will have 47.7% + 47.7% = 95.4% or approximately 95% . For a\npopulation with a normal distribution, approximately 95% of the data values will lie within two\nstandard deviations of the mean.\nConsider the percentage of data items that lie within three standard deviations of the mean. This is\nthe region that lies between -3\u03c3 and 3\u03c3. Between -3\u03c3 and 0, we find 2.1% + 13.6% + 34.1% or 49.8%\nof the data values. So between -3\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 we will have 49.8% + 49.8% = 99.6%. (Note: The values in\nFigure 8 are all rounded to the nearest tenth. The number is actually closer to 49.86% x 2 = 99.72%).\nFor a population with a normal distribution, approximately 99.7% of the data values will lie within\nthree standard deviations of the mean. Another way of stating this, since 99.7% of the data will lie\nwithin three standard deviations of the mean, then only 0.3 % of the data will not lie within three\nstandard deviations.\nUsing the 68-95-99.7 Rule\nWhen working with a population that has a normal distribution the 68-95-99.7 Rule can be used to\ndetermine the percentage of the population that will be within one, two or three standard deviations of\nthe mean. 800 8 Data Analysis 2\nEXAMPLE 1\nA certain segment of the economy has a normally distributed salary, with a mean salary of $45,000 and a\nstandard deviation of $4000.\na) Determine the salary that is one standard deviation above the mean.\nb) Determine the salary that is three standard deviations below the mean.\nc) Determine the salary range for the employees that lie within one standard deviation of the mean.

What\npercent of the employees lie in this salary range?\ne) What percent of the employees earn a salary less than $33,000?\nSolution\na) $45,000 + $4000 = $49,000\nb) $45,000 \u2013 (3 x $4000) = $33,000\nc) $45,000 \u00b1 $4000 = $41,000 to $49,000. According to the 68-95-99.7 Rule, sixty-eight percent of the\nemployees for this segment of the economy lie within this salary range.\nd) $45,000 \u00b1 (2 x $4000) = $37,000 to $53,000. According to the 68-95-99.7 Rule, ninety-five percent of\nthe employees for this segment of the economy lie within this salary range.\ne) A salary of $33,000 is 3 standard deviations below the mean. According to the 68-95-99.7 Rule, 100% \u2013\n99.7% or 0.3% of the employees lie above or below three standard deviations from the mean.

The mean score on the\nexam was 67% with a standard deviation of 8.\na) Determine the number of students who received a score of 67% or greater.\nb) Determine the number of students who received a score within one standard deviation of the mean. What\nwas the range in scores for these students?\nc) Determine the number of students who received a score ranging between 51% to 83%.\nd) What possible scores did the top 0.15% of the students receive? How many students were in this group?\nSolution\na) Since 67% was the mean or average score, half of the students 0.5 x 150 = 75 students received a score\nof 67% or greater.\nb) According to the Rule, one standard deviation on either side of the mean represents 34% + 34% = 68% of\nthe students so\n0.68 x 150 students = 102 students scored within one standard deviation of the mean.\nWe know that the mean score was 67% and one standard deviation of 8 on either side:\n67 \u2013 8 = 59% and 67 + 8 = 75% therefore the 102 students within one standard deviation scored from 59%\nto 75% on the exam.\nc) If we consider the mean of 67% and two standard deviations on either side: 802 8 Data Analysis 2\n67 \u2013 (2\u00d78) = 51% and 67 + (2\u00d78) = 83% This indicates that students who scored from 51% to 83% were\ntwo standard deviations on either side of the mean.\nAccording to the Rule, two standard deviations on either side represents 95% of the students therefore 0.95 x\n150 = 142.5 or between 142 to 143 students scored between 51% and 83% on the exam.\nd) According to the Rule, 99.7% of the exam scores lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean, so 0.15%\nof the students scored higher than 3 standard deviations above the mean score. The mean score was 67% so:\n67% + 3 standard deviations of 8 = 67% + (3 x 8) = 67% + 24% = 91%\nTherefore the top 0.15% of the students received exam scores greater than 91%\nThe number of students receiving this score would be 0.15% x 150 students = 0.0015 x 150 = 0.225 students.\nThis indicates that at most one student received a score greater than 91%.\nTRY IT 2\nA local run club hosted a recreational race.

What\nwere the possible times for these runners?\nc) Determine the number of runners who recorded a time between 90 and 150 minutes. (Hint: Consider that\none standard deviation is 15 minutes)\nd) What possible times did the slowest 2.5% of the runners record? How many runners were in this group?\nShow answer\na) 0.5 x 148 = 74 runners\nb) 0.68 x 148 = 100.6 runners (100 to 101) runners; 120 min. \u00b1 15 min. = 105 to 135 min.\nc) mean \u00b1 2 std. deviations = 120 \u00b1 30 min. = 90 to 150 minutes so this is 95% of the runners. 0.95 x 148 =\n140.6 (140 to 141 runners)\nd) 5% of the runners had times either two standard deviations above or below the mean so 2.5 % had times\nabove the mean (the slowest times). 120 min + (2 x 15min) = 150 min. or greater\nFor 2.5% of 148 = 3.7 so 3 to 4 runners. 8.3 The Normal Curve 803\nWhen working with a population that is normally distributed, it can be helpful to sketch the normal\ncurve and calculate values that are one, two and three standard deviations on either side of the mean.\nEXAMPLE 3\nThe average salary for a certain occupation in the trades is determined to be $46,000 (rounded to the nearest\nthousand) and the standard deviation is $3000. The salaries are normally distributed as indicated in the figure:\nUse the 68-95-99.7 rule to determine the percentage of workers in this trade who earn:\na) less than $46,000\nb) between $43,000 and $49,000\nc) between $37,000 and $55,000\nd) less than $55,000\ne) between $40,000 and $49,000\nSolution:\nNote that there is more than one approach for these.\na) Since $46,000 is the mean, 50% of the workers will earn less than $46,000.\nb) $43000 is one standard deviation less than the mean and $49,000 is one standard deviation more than the\nmean. Using the Rule, 68% of the workers will earn between $43000 and $46000.\nc) $37000 is three standard deviations less than the mean and $55,000 is three standard deviations more than\nthe mean. Using the Rule, 99.7% of the workers will earn between $37000 and $55000.\nd) From the Rule, 99.7% of the data values lie between 3 standard deviations or $37000 to $55000. The\nremaining 100% \u2013 99.7% = 0.3% of the data values lie equally at either end of the distribution. This means 804 8 Data Analysis 2\nthat 0.3% /2 or 0.15% of the data values are greater than $55000 and 0.15% are less than $37,000. So 99.7%\n+ 0.15% = 99.85% of the workers will earn less than $55000.\ne) One approach is to work the two halves of the distribution separately and then add the results.\nStart with the data values that lie between $40000 and the mean of $46000. The salary of $40000 is is two\nstandard deviations below the mean. If 95% of the values are \u00b1 2 standard deviations from the mean then half\nthis amount 95%/2 = 47.5% of the values are between $40000 and $46000.\nNow consider $49000 which is one standard deviation greater than the mean. If 68% of the values are \u00b1 1\nstandard deviation from the mean then half this amount 68%/2 = 34% of the values are between $46000 and\n$49000.\nNow add the two percentages 47.5% + 34% = 81.5%.

We will shift gears\nand explore how to determine where a specific data value lies in relation to all other values. As an\nexample, a student who has written a college entrance exam may want to know where they placed in\ncomparison to all other students. This section will explore how to determine this.\nConsider the normal curve which is an idealized representation of a normally distributed population.\nThe normal curve, also called a bell-shaped curve, is represented in Figure 1. The area under the\ncurve represents 100% (or 1.00) of the data (or population) and the mean score is 0.\n811 812 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 1\nWe have seen that the standard deviation plays an important role in the normal distribution.\nRefer to Figure 2 for the visual representation of the 68 \u2013 95 \u2013 99.7 Rule. For a normally distributed set\nof data:\n\u2022 Approximately 68% (68.26%) of the data items fall within one standard deviation of the\nmean.\n\u2022 Approximately 95% (95.44%) of the data items fall within two standard deviations of the\nmean.\n\u2022 Approximately 99.7% of the data items fall within three standard deviations of the mean.\nFig. 2\nZ\u2013Scores\nWhen a data set is normally distributed we can use a standardized score, called the z-score, to\ndetermine the number of standard deviations that a data value is from the mean.\nReconsider an example from the previous section. Acertain segment of the economy has a normally\ndistributed salary, with a mean salary of $45,000 and a standard deviation of $4000. Refer to Figure 3. 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 813\nFig. 3\nWith this information we are able to determine that a salary of $49,000 lies exactly one standard\ndeviation above the mean since $45,000 + $4000 = $49, 000. In turn, using the 68-95-99.7 Rule we\ncan determine that a salary of $49,000 is higher than 84% of the other salaries for this segment of the\neconomy. The calculation would be 50% + (68%/2) = 84%. This calculation was possible since\n$49,000 was exactly one standard deviation away from the mean.\nConsider a salary which does not lie exactly one, two or three standard deviations from the mean, such\nas $38,500. The calculation does not appear so straightforward but as it turns out we can use a z-score\nfor situations such as this. A z-score converts a data value and standardizes it so that we are able to\ndetermine how many standard deviations a specific data value will lie above or below the mean.\nZ-scores can be used in situations with a normal distribution. Consider a chemistry class with a set of\ntest scores that is normally distributed. The average score is 76% and one student receives a score of\n55%. Converting the 55% to a z-score will provide the student with a sense of where their score lies\nwith respect to the rest of the class. We can also use z-scores to determine the percent of the data values\nthat will lie between any two data values. Perhaps we wish to determine the percentage of students\nwhose test scores lie between 70% to 85%. This can also be done using z-scores.\nWe have seen that when calculating standard deviation we must consider whether we are working with\nthe entire population or a sample of the population. We must do the same when calculating a z-score.\nFormulas for Finding Z-Scores\nThe z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data value is from the mean value.\nThe formula for z is: 814 8 Data Analysis 2\nFor a population we calculate the z-score using the population mean \u03bc and standard deviation \u03c3. The data\nvalue is represented by x.\nFor a representative sample of the population we calculate the z-score using the sample mean and standard\ndeviation.:\nA z-score is similar to a percentile in that it is a measure of position. As a rule, z-scores above 2.0 (or\nbelow \u20132.0) are considered \u201cunusual\u201d values. According to the 68-95-99.7 Rule, in a normal population\nsuch scores would occur less than 5% of the time. Z-scores between -2.0 and 2.0 are considered\n\u201cordinary\u201d values and these represent 95% of the values.\nEXAMPLE 1\nIQ scores are normally distributed. The mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15.\na) If Frank has an IQ of 127, find his z-score. b) Intrepret the meaning of this z-score. c) Using the 68-95-99.7\nRule, how does Frank\u2019s IQ compare to the rest of the population?\nSolution\na) We will use the z-score for a population:\nFrank\u2019s z-score is 1.8.\nb) For this z-score, the mean of 100 has been \u201cstandardized\u201d to a value of 0 and the score of 127 has been\nstandardized to a value of 1.8. This means that Frank\u2019s IQ score is 1.8 (almost 2 standard deviations) higher\nthan the average. 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 815\nc) Considering the 68-95-99.7 Rule, Frank\u2019s score lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean. His score is\ncertainly better than at least 84% of the population but does not rank in the top 2.5% of the population.\nTRY IT 1\nConsider a chemistry class and a set of test scores with an average of 76% and a standard deviation of 7%. A\nstudent receives a test score of 55%. a) Determine the student\u2019s z-score. b) Intrepret the meaning of this z-\nscore. c) Using the 68-95-99.7 Rule, how does the student\u2019s test score compare to the rest of the class?\nShow answer\na) z-score = -3 b) This z-score is exactly 3 standard deviations less than the mean score of 76%. c) This\nstudent scored better than only 0.15% of the class (or 99.85% of the class scored higher than this student).\nIn Example 1 we were able to determine that Frank\u2019s score is better than at least 84% of the population\nbut it does not rank in the top 2.5% of the population. This is a fairly broad conclusion. As it turns out\nwe can be more specific if we use z-score tables.\nZ-Score Tables\nA z-score table allows us to determine, for a normal distribution, the percentage of data values that lie\nbelow (to the left) of a specific z\u2013score. This in turn will enable us to determine the percentage of\nvalues that lie between or to the right of a given z-score.\nWe will use two different z-tables, one for positive z-scores and one for negative z-scores. These tables\nare available online (or refer to the Tables at the end of this chapter).\nA portion of a positive z-score table is shown in Figure 4. We use the positive z-table when we have z-\nscores that are greater than 0 or lie to the right of the mean. The number in the z-table represents the\narea under the bell curve to the left of the z-score. The number is stated as a decimal fraction which can\nthen be converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100. If for example the number in the table is\n0.62552, then this would be interpreted as 62.552%. 816 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 4\nConsider a data value X that is found to have a standardized z-score of 1.42. A data value with a z-\nscore of 1.42 will lie between 1 and 2 standard deviations above the mean (refer to Fig. 5). We can use\na z-zcore table to determine the proportion of data vales that are less than (or geater than) this score.\nFig. 5\nThis z-score value of 1.42 is positive so we refer to the positive z-score table in Figure 4. In the table\ngo down the first column until you reach +1.4. The first column provides the z-score values to the\nnearest tenth (or one decimal place). To incorporate the digit that is in the second decimal place we\nmust move through the body of the table until the heading of the column matches the digit in the\nhundredths place. In this example we move across the row for +1.4 until we reach the column headed\nwith a 0.02. The corresponding number in the table is 0.92220 so for a z-score of 1.42 we can state that\nthe area to the left of this score is 0.92220. Alternatively, 92.220% of all data values are less than this 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 817\ndata value X. We are also able to conclude that 7.8% of the data values lie above this z-score value\nsince 100% \u2013 92.2% = 7.8%\nUsing only the z-score of 1.42 we were able to conclude that the data value X will lie between 1 and 2\nstandard deviations above the mean. By using the z-score table we are able to be more specific in\nstating that approximately 92% of the data values are less than X.\nEXAMPLE 2\nConsider a z-score of 0.18. a) Determine the area under the curve for a z-score of 0.18. b) Interpret what this\nz-score tells us.\nSolution\na) This value is positive so we refer to the positive z-score table (a partial table is provided in Figure 4). In the\ntable go down the first column until you reach +0.1. Then move across the row until you reach the column\nheaded with a 0.08. This represents a z-score of 0.18. For a z-score of 0.18 the number in the table is\n0.57142.\nb) For a data value with a z-score of 0.18, approximately 57.1% of the data values will be below this and\n42.9% will be above this data value.\nTRY IT 2\nConsider a z-score of 0.90. a) Determine the area under the curve for a z-score of 0.90. b) Interpret what this\nz-score tells us.\nShow answer\na) area is 0.81594 b) Approximately 81.6% of data values are less than this value (or 18.4% are greater).\nIf the z-score is negative we use a negative z-table, a portion of which is illustrated in Figure 6. This\ntable provides z-scores that are less than 0 or lie to the left of the mean. The number in the z-table\nrepresents the area under the bell curve to the left of the z-score. 818 8 Data Analysis 2\nFig. 6\nConsider an observation that has a z-score of -1.17. Refer to the negative z-score table in Figure 6. In\nthe table go down the first column until you reach -1.1. Then move across the row until you reach the\ncolumn headed with a 0.07. For a z-score of -1.17 the number in the table is 0.12100 or 12.1%. This\nrepresents the portion of the data values that lie to the left of the z-score (refer to Figure 7). This means\nthat 12.1% of the data values are less than this data value. Alternatively 87.9% (100% \u2013 12.1%) of the\ndata values are greater than this data observation.\nFig. 7 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 819\nZ-Scores and the 68-95-99.7 Rule\nWith a normal distribution half of the data values lie below the mean and half lie above the mean. If we\ncalculate the z-score for a mean of 0 we will find that the z-score will also be 0. From the z-table we\ncan determine that for a z-score of 0 the number is 0.5. This indicates that 50% of the data values lie\nbelow the mean and therefore 50% of the data values lie above the mean.\nFig. 8\nRefer to the normal distribution that is illustrated in Figure 8. For standard deviations of 1, 2 or 3 we\ncan use the 68-95-99.7 Rule to determine areas under the curve. We can also use z-score tables to do\nthis.\nEXAMPLE 3\na) A data value X is found to lie -1 standard deviation from the mean. Use the 68-95-99.7 Rule to determine\nthe percentage of data values that are lower than this data value.\nb) For a data value X with a z-score of -1, determine the percentage of data values that are lower than X.\nSolution\na) Refer to Figure 8. If 68% of the data values lie between -1 and 1 standard deviations, then 100% \u2013 68% =\n32% lie on either side of -1 or 1 standard deviations from the mean. Dividing 32% in half we get 16%.\nTherefore 16% of all data values are lower than the data value X. (Note: There are other approaches to this\ncalculation).\nb) Refer to the negative z-score table in Figure 6. For a z-score of -1 the area will be 0.15866 or 15.866%.\nRounded to the nearest whole number we determine that 16% of the data values are lower than this data\nvalue.\nNote: The z-score table will provide more accurate results than the 68-95-99.7 Rule since the values in the\n68-95-99.7 Rule are rounded off approximations. 820 8 Data Analysis 2\nTRY IT 3\na) A data value X is found to lie 3 standard deviations from the mean. Use the 68-95-99.7 Rule to determine\nthe percentage of data values that are greater than this data value.\nb) For a data value X with a z-score of 3, determine the percentage of data values that are greater than X.\nShow answer\na) Refer to Figure 8. If 99.7% of the data values lie between -3 and 3 standard deviations, then 100% \u2013 99.7%\n= 0.3% lie on either side of -3 or 3 standard deviations from the mean. Dividing 0.3% in half we get 0.15%.\nTherefore 0.15% of all data values are greater than the data value X.\nb) Refer to a positive z-score table. For a z-score of 3 the area to the left will be 0.99865 or 99.865% so the\narea to the right (greater) will be 100% \u2013 99.865% = 0.135% Rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places we\ndetermine that 0.14% of the data values are greater than this data value. Note that this slightly different than\nthe answer obtained from using the 68-95-99.7 Rule due to rounding.\nAreas Between Z-Scores\nWe can use z-score tables to determine the area between two z-scores. As an example, we can use the\ntable to determine the area between the mean and a z-score of 1. A z-score of 1 lies one standard\ndeviation to the right of the mean (as in Figure 9). Refer to the positive z-table in Figure 4. For a z-\nzcore of 1 the value in the table is 0.84134. This indicates that approximately 84% of the data values lie\nto the left of this z-score.\nFig. 9\nFrom the z-score table we determine that for the z-score of 0 the area to the left is 0.5000. The area\nbetween the mean and one standard deviation would be as follows:\n0.84134 \u2013 0.500 = 0.3413 or 34.13%\nFigure 10 illustrates the area between the mean and one standard deviation. 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 821\nFig. 10\nNote that this is consistent with the 68-95-99.7 Rule. It states that approximately 68% of the data will\nlie within one standard deviation on either side of the mean. Half this amount, or 34%, will lie between\nthe mean and a standard deviation of one.\nThe 68-95-99.7 Rule is useful when data values lie exactly 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations from the\nmean. Z-score tables are useful for data values that have z-scores that are not exactly 1, 2 or 3 standard\ndeviations from the mean.\nEXAMPLE 4\nGiven a normal distribution, use the z-score tables to find the area for each of the following z-scores (rounded\nto the nearest tenth of a percent):\na) to the left of z = 1.72\nb) to the left of z = -0.45\nc) to the right of z = -0.45\nd) between -0.45 and the mean\nSolution 822 8 Data Analysis 2 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 823\nTRY IT 4\nGiven a normal distribution, find the area for each of the following z-scores (rounded to the nearest tenth of a\npercent):\na) to the left of z = 0.85\nb) to the right of z = 0.85\nc) between the mean and z = 0.85\nShow answer\na) 0.8023 = 80.2%\nb) 0.1977 = 19.8%\nc) 0.8023 \u2013 0.5 = 0.3023 = 30.2%\nEXAMPLE 5\nGiven a normal distribution, find the area for each of the following z-scores (rounded to the nearest tenth of a\npercent):\na) between z = -0.65 and z = 0.65\nb) between z = -0.65 and z = 2.8\nc) between z = 1.44 and z = 2.8\nSolution 824 8 Data Analysis 2 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 825\nTRY IT 5\nGiven a normal distribution, find the area for each of the following z-scores (rounded to the nearest tenth of a\npercent):\na) between z = 0 and z = -0.73\nb) between z = -0.73 and z = 1.95\nc) between z = -2.12 and z = -0.73\nShow answer\na) 0.2673 = 26.7%\nb) 0.7417 = 74.17%\nc) 0.2157 = 21.6%\nApplications Using Z-Scores\nWith populations or samples that are normally distributed, z-scores can be used to determine how data\nvalues compare (are positioned) with respect to other data values. 826 8 Data Analysis 2\nEXAMPLE 6\nFrank has an IQ of 127, or a z score of 1.8. What percent of the population have IQ scores less than 127 and\nwhat percent have IQ scores higher than 127?\nSolution\nRefer back to Example 1 where the 68-95-99.7 Rule was used to analyze Frank\u2019s IQ score. From the Rule we\nwere able to conclude that Frank\u2019s IQ was better than at least 84% of the other scores and that his score did\nnot rank in the top 2.5%. Comparing the two methods, the z-score provides us with a much more accurate\nanalysis.\nTRY IT 6\nConsider a chemistry class and a set of test scores with an average of 76% and a standard deviation of 7%. A\nstudent receives a test score of 55% which yields a z-score of -3 (refer to TRY IT 1). a) Use a z-score table to\ndetermine what percent of the class had test scores less than 55% and what percent had test scores greater\nthan 55%. b) How does this compare with the answer to TRY IT 1?\nShow answer\na) From the table the area to the left of a z-score of -3 is 0.00135 therefore 0.135% of the class had test scores\nless than 55% and 99.865% of the class scored higher than 55%. b) Using the Rule in TRY IT1 the results 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 827\nwere slightly different due to rounding: 0.15% of the students scored less than 55% and 99.85% scored\nhigher than 55%.\nFor applications involving populations or samples that are normally distributed, we can calculate z-\nscores if we know the mean and the standard deviation.\nEXAMPLE 7\nThe waiting-in-line time at a certain grocery store is normally distributed with a mean\nof 3.5 minutes and a standard deviation of 1.4 minutes.\na) What percent of the customers wait in line less than one minute?\nb) What percent of the customers wait in line more than 5 minutes?\nSolution 828 8 Data Analysis 2\nTRY IT 7\nThe waiting-in-line time to be seated at a popular retaurant during primetime hours is normally distributed\nwith a mean of 24 minutes and a standard deviation of 11 minutes.\na) What percent of the customers wait in line less than twenty minutes?\nb) What percent of the customers wait in line more than forty-five minutes?\nShow answer\na) 36% of customers wait less than 20 minutes b) 3% of customers wait more than 45 minutes\nEXAMPLE 8\nAll first year psychology students wrote an exam that had 92 questions. Each question was worth 1 point for\na total possible 92 points. The marks were normally distributed with a mean of score of 58 points and a\nstandard deviation of 11 points. 8.4 Z-Scores and the Normal Curve 829\na) Determine the z-score for a mark of 45 points. What percent of the scores were less than 45 points?\nb) Determine the z-score for a mark of 84 points. What percent of the scores were greater than 84 points?\nc) What percent of the scores were between 76 and 88 points?\nSolution:\na) z = -1.1818 and area to the left is 0.11900 so 11.9% of the scores would be less than 45 points\nb) z = 2.3636 and the area to the left is 0.99086 so the area to the right is 1- 0.99534 = 0.00914. Therefore\n0.9% (almost 1%) would score higher than 84 points\nc) for 76 points z = 1.64 and the area to the left is 0.9495. For 88 points z = 2.73 and the area to the left is\n0.99683. The difference is 0.99683 \u2013 0.9495 = 0.04733. This means that 4.7% of the students would score\nbetween 76 and 88 points.\nTRY IT 8\nAn entrance exam was given to a cohort of students. The mean score was 1000 points with a standard\ndeviation of 150 points.\na) What percent of the students scored less than 820 points?\nb) What percent of the students scored more than 1330 points?\nc) What percent of the students scored between 950 and 1100 points?\nShow answer\na) 11.5% scored less than 820 points b) 1.4% scored more than 1330 points\nc) 37.8% scored between 950 and 1100 points\nKey Concepts\n\u2022 For a population we calculate the z-score for a data value x using the population mean \u03bc and\nstandard deviation \u03c3.\n\u2022 For a representative sample of the population we calculate the z-score for a data value x\nusing the sample mean and standard deviation. : 830 8 Data Analysis 2\n\u2022 A z-score table allows us to determine, for a normal distribution, the percentage of data\nvalues that lie below (to the left) of a specific z\u2013score. This in turn will enable us to\ndetermine the percentage of values that lie between or to the right of a given z-score.\n\u2022 When a z-score is negative (lies to the left of the mean) we use a negative z-score table.\nWhen a z-score is positive (lies to the right of the mean) we use a positive z-score table.\nGlossary\nZ-score\nis a standardized score that has been converted from a data value.

Although this provides instant access to funds it does not\nprovide any return or earnings on this money. For that reason, most people hold their money in\naccounts or investments that provide some form of return or earning power.\n837 838 9 Financial Mathematics\nInterest is the price paid for the use of money. If you borrow money from another person or a lending\ninstitution, eventually you must pay back this amount plus the interest owing. When you deposit\nmoney in a bank, you are lending them money and after some time they will pay you interest on the\nmoney you lent them.\nThe amount of interest you will owe or receive is determined by the principal, the interest rate, and\nthe time (the length of the loan). The amount of money that you lend or borrow is called the principal.\nThe length of the loan can range between a few days to several years. The interest rate is stated as an\nannual percentage. It may be simple interest or compound interest. With simple interest the interest is\ncalculated only once during the entire time period of the loan or deposit. Simple interest is calculated\nsolely on the principal investment or loan. With compound interest the interest is calculated more than\nonce during the time period of the loan. It will be calculated on the principal as well as the accumulated\ninterest This section will focus on simple interest and in the next section we will consider compound\ninterest.\nSimple Interest\nSimple interest is calculated by finding the product of the principal (P), the rate (r), and the time (t).\nSimple Interest\nThe simple interest formula is I = Prt where\nI = interest earned r = annual interest rate ( stated as a decimal)\nP = principal t = time (in years)\nInterest rates are quoted for periods of one year and when used in a formula must be converted to a\ndecimal fraction. The time must be expressed in the same unit of time as the interest rate so time must\nbe stated in years or portions of a year. If you deposit money in a savings account earning 3% interest\nthen the annual interest rate is 3% per year.\nEXAMPLE 1\nJo borrows $2000 at an interest rate of 5% per year. How much interest will Jo owe after one year?\nSolution\nIdentify the P, r, and t.

How much interest will Terri owe on the loan at the end of\none year?\nShow answer\nTerri will owe $152 after one year.\nNote that the time t is expressed in terms of years. When the time period is not exactly one year, the\nvalue for t will be the fraction of the year during which interest is earned.\nIf the investment is made for 3 months, then t = 3 months/12 months = 0.25 years.\nIf the investment is made for 35 days then t = 35 days/365 days = 7/73 years.\nEXAMPLE 2\na) If an investment is made for a period of 145 days, what portion of the year does this represent?\nb) If an investment is made for a period of 48 weeks, what portion of the year does this represent?\nc) If an investment is made for a period of 10 months, what portion of the year does this represent?\nSolution: 840 9 Financial Mathematics\na) 145 \u00f7 365= 29/73 years\nb) 48 \u00f7 52 = 12/13 years\nc) 10 \u00f7 12 = 5/6 years\nTRY IT 2\na) If an investment is made for a period of 220 days, what portion of the year does this represent?\nb) If an investment is made for a period of 32 weeks, what portion of the year does this represent?\nc) If an investment is made for a period of 2 months, what portion of the year does this represent?\nShow answer\na) 220 \u00f7 365= 44/73 year\nb) 32 \u00f7 52 = 8/13 year\nc) 2 \u00f7 12 = 1/6 year\nEXAMPLE 3\nDetermine the interest that will be earned on a deposit of $1350 at 2.8% over:\na) 7 months\nb) 25 days\nSolution:\na)\nInterest of $22.05 over 7 months\nb) 9.1 Simple Interest 841\nInterest of $2.59 over 25 days.

It is\nthe amount to be paid on the due date of a loan or the amount to be paid to an investor at the end of the\nperiod for which an investment has been made.\nMaturity Value\nThe Maturity Value (MV) of a loan is the sum of the principal P plus the interest I.\nMV = P + I\nIn Example 1, Jo borrowed $2000 at an interest rate of 5%. At the end of one year Jo owed $100 in\ninterest.\nThe maturity value of the loan is MV = P + I where P = $2000 and I = $100. 9.1 Simple Interest 843\nMV = $2000 + $100 = $2100\nThe maturity value of the loan is $2100. At the end of the year Jo will be expected to pay back $2100.\nEXAMPLE 5\nLinda lends Ed $500. Ed says he will pay her back in 60 days at 9% simple interest. How much interest\nshould Linda receive? How much must Ed pay Linda altogether?\nSolution\nReplace P, r and t with their values\nMultiply\nRound to the nearest cent\nMV = P + I = $500 + $7.40 = $507.40\nLinda should receive $7.40 in interest. At the end of 60 days Ed will owe Linda $507.40.\nTRY IT 5\nIn order to purchase equipment, a barbershop takes out a short term loan of $3000 at a rate of 4.35%.

For an\ninvestment of $100 earning 10% simple interest, the interest earned after one year will be $10 since\n10% of $100 = $10. An investment will grow more quickly if the interest is calculated more often than\n853 854 9 Financial Mathematics\nonce a year. Interest will not only be calculated on the principal amount but also on the previously\nearned interest. This process is referred to compounding.\nFigure 1 illustrates the process of compounding or earning interest on interest. Consider an investment\nof $100 that earns 10%/year with interest being compounded semiannually. With semiannual\ncompounding the interest on the investment will be calculated twice during the year.\nFig. 1\nUsing the simple interest formula I = Prt, at the end of six months (half a year) interest will be\ncalculated as follows:\nI = $100 x 10% x 1/2 year = $5.\nAdding this $5 to the principal of $100 you will have $105 at the end of the first six months. At the end\nof the year interest will be calculated again on the $105:\nI = $105 x 10% x 1/2 year = $5.25.\nAdding this $5.25 to $105 you will have $110.25 at the end of the year. In this case you would be\nearning interest not only on the original principal of $100, but also on the previously earned interest of\n$5. When interest is earned on interest, we say the interest is compounded. The total amount of\nprincipal and accumulated interest at the end of a loan or investment is called the compound amount.\nConsider a $100 investment that earns 10%/year compounded annually. The table in Figure 2 shows\nhow the value of the $100 investment will grow over a 6-year period. 9.2 Compound Interest 855\nAmount at the\nEarned\nYear beginning of the Year End Total\nInterest\nyear\n1 $100 $10 $110\n2 $110 $11 $121\n3 $121 $12.10 $133.10\n4 $133.10 $13.31 $146.41\n5 $146.41 $14.64 $161.05\n6 $161.05 $16.11 $177.16\nFig. 2\nAt the beginning of Year 1, $100 is invested, so the interest earned in the first year will be:\nI = Prt = $100 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 1 = $10. This is added to the original $100 to result in $110 at the end of Year\n1.\nAt the beginning of Year 2 the process will repeat but the principal P is now $110.\nI = Prt = $110 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d71 = $11 in interest so at the end of Year 2 there will be:\n$110 + $11 = $121 in the account.\nNotice that the compound amount at the end of the six year period is $177.16. The investment has\nearned an accumulated $77.16 in interest. If the investment had earned simple interest as opposed to\ncompound interest it would have only earned:\nI = Prt = 100 \u00d7 0.10 \u00d7 6 = $60 in interest.\nThe above method of calculating the compound amount is very time consuming. Fortunately, there is a\nmathematical formula that we can use when working with compound interest.\nCompound Interest Formula\nThe compound interest formula is: 856 9 Financial Mathematics\nwhere, A = total compound amount(includes principal and interest)\nP = principal\nr = annual interest rate\nn = number of times in one year that interest is calculated\nt = time (in years)\nSince A includes both the principal and interest, to find the interest amount I calculate:\nEXAMPLE 1\nFind the compound amount and the interest earned on $100 compounded annually at 10% for 6 years.\nSolution\nP = $100\nr = 10% = 0.1\nReplace the variables with their\nn = 1 (since the interest is calculated values\nonce a year)\nt = 6 years\nand\nRaise\nThe interest earned is $77.16\nThe compound amount is $177.16\nTRY IT 1\nKyle won $10,000 in a lottery and deposited the full amount in a 3 year investment at 3.8% compounded\nannually. Find the compound amount and the interest earned over the three years.\nShow answer\nCompound Amount = $11,183.87; Interest = $1183.87 9.2 Compound Interest 857\nInterest can be compounded using a variety of compounding periods. The compounding period is the\nspan of time between when interest is calculated and when it will be calculated again. If there is one\nmonth between every interest calculation then the compounding period is monthly. With monthly\ncompounding there will be 12 compounding period in one year since there are twelve months in a year\n. The variable n in the compound interest formula reflects the number of times in one year that interest\nis calculated.\nCompounding Periods\nIf interest is compounded:\nannually (once per year) \u21d2 n = 1\nsemi-annually (twice a year) \u21d2 n = 2\nquarterly (four times per year) \u21d2 n = 4\nmonthly (twelve times per year) \u21d2 n = 12\nweekly (fifty-two times per year) \u21d2 n = 52\ndaily (three hundred sixty-five times per year) \u21d2 n = 365\nEXAMPLE 2\nFind the compound amount and the interest earned on $500 compounded semiannually at 6% for 3 years.\nSolution\n(since the interest is calculated semiannually or 2 times a year)\nThe compound amount is $597.03 and the interest earned is $597.03 \u2013 $500 = $97.03 858 9 Financial Mathematics\nTRY IT 2\nKam won $10,000 in a lottery and deposited the full amount in a 3 year investment at 3.8% compounded\nmonthly.

Say for example that you want to know how much principal you needed to invest now in order\nto have $2000 in two years. The amount you need to invest now is called the present value of $2000. It\nis the amount of money that if invested now will accumulate to $2000 in two years. Assuming that your\ninvestment earns interest, the amount required now will be less than the future amount. Assuming\nannual compounding at an interest rate of 5% you will need to invest $1814.06 now to have $2000 in\ntwo years. Refer to Figure 3 below.\nFig. 3 9.2 Compound Interest 861\nIn Figure 3 we can see that at the beginning of the year $1814.06 is invested.\nAt the end of the first year the interest earned on $1814.06 is 5% \u00d7 1814.06 = $90.70.\nAt the end of the first year there will be $1904.76 in the account. In the second year the interest earned\non $1904.76 is $1904.76 \u00d7 0.05 = $95.24.\nAt th eend of the second year there will be $2000.00 in the account. The $2000 that is needed in two\nyears is said to have a present value of $1814.06.\nThe present value can be calculated by solving the compound interest formula for P.\nFormula for Present Value\nThe present value formula is:\nwhere P = present value\nA = desired future amount\nr = interest rate (as a decimal fraction)\nn = number of times interest is calculated in one year\nt = times (in years)\nEXAMPLE 6\nA house painting company is planning to expand its operations in three years time.

When we require a loan we seek the lowest possible interest rate but when we invest we\nwant the highest rate of return. As we search for the best offer it is important to recognize that the\nadvertised interest rate is not necessarily the true interest rate.\nAn advertised rate of 10% with annual compounding works out to be equivalent to a rate of 10%\nannually. We refer to this stated rate of 10% as the nominal interest rate. An advertised rate of 10%\n869 870 9 Financial Mathematics\nwith daily compounding works out to be equivalent to a rate of 10.52% since interest is calculated on\nthe interest 365 times in one year. We refer to the 10.52% as the effective interest rate.\nThe stated interest rate is referred to as the nominal interest rate, as it describes the named or\nnumerical value. It is the rate that is usually stated in advertisements. The actual interest rate, or\neffective interest rate, reflects the real rate of return as it takes the compounding periods into account.\nWith simple interest calculations (where there is no compounding), the stated annual interest rate\nindicates the true rate of return. If $1000 is borrowed at 6% for one year, then the interest owined will\nbe I = Prt = $1000 \u00d7 0.06/yr \u00d7 1yr = $60.\nWith compound interest calculations, the stated annual interest rate does not indicate the true interest\ncost. If $1000 is invested at 6% for one year compounded semiannually, then the interest owed will be\n$60.90 rather than $60.\nOne way to determine the effective interest rate is to divide the total compound interest for the first\nyear by the principal amount. If in the first year $60.90 is the interest charged on a principal of $1000\nthen the effective interest rate is $60.90/$1000 = 0.0609 = 6.09%. Although the nominal interest rate\nis 6%, the effective rate is 6.09%.\nIt is also possible to use a formula to calculate the effective interest rate.\nEffective Interest Rate Formula\nThe effective interest rate formula is:\nwhere f = effective interest rate\nr = nominal interest rate (annual interest rate)\nn = number of times in one year that interest is calculated\nEXAMPLE 1\nUse the formula to determine the effective interest rate for 6% compounded annually.\nSolution 9.3 Interest Rates 871\nf = ?\nr = 6% = 0.06\nn = 1\nReplace the variables with their\nvalues\nAdd\nThe effective interest rate is 6%.

During our working lives we contribute to\na retirement fund so that upon retirement we receive a financial payment at regular intervals. Financial\ntransactions that involve a series of equal payments at equal intervals are called annuities. Other\nexamples of annuities include payments on a loan, rental payments, and insurance premiums.\nThe term of the annuity is the time from the beginning of the first payment interval to the end of the\nlast payment interval. A payment interval is the time between successive payments. If, for example,\n879 880 9 Financial Mathematics\na vehicle is purchased with monthly payments on a four-year loan then the term of the loan is 4 years\nand the payment interval is monthly.\nIn some cases, as with salaries or a senior\u2019s pension, the payments are made at the end of a payment\ninterval. This is referred to as an ordinary annuity. When payments are required at the beginning of a\npayment interval, as with many loans and mortgages, this is referred to as an annuity due.\nIt is important to note that the term of the annuity does not necessarily coincide with the first and last\npayment. Consider a one year loan where 12 equal payments are made on the first of each month. This\nis an example of an annuity due. The term of the annuity is one year and the payment interval is\none month. Refer to Figure 1. There are twelve payments, each occurring on the first day of the month.\nThe first payment is made on Jan. 1 and the last payment is made on Dec. 1. Note that the final\npayment on Dec. 1 does not occur on the last day of the term of the annuity which is Dec. 31.\nFig. 1\nConsider a one year loan where 12 equal payments are made on the last day of each month. This is an\nexample of an ordinary annuity. The term of the annuity is one year and the payment interval is one\nmonth. Refer to Figure 2. There are twelve payments, each occurring on the last day of the month. The\nfirst payment is made on Jan. 31 and the last payment is made on Dec. 31. Note that the first payment\non Jan. 31 does not occur on the first day of the term of the annuity which is Jan. 1. 9.4 Annuities 881\nFig. 2\nIn this section we will only be concerned with ordinary simple annuities. As with all ordinary\nannuities the payments are made at the end of each payment interval. It is also the case that the\ncompounding interval equals the payment interval. This means that if the payment interval is\nmonthly then interest will also be compounded monthly.\nFuture Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nConsider an investment that is in the form of an ordinary simple annuity. This means that a deposit is\nmade at the end of regular intervals and interest is compounded at each of these intervals. The value of\nthe annuity can grow substantially. The final amount of the annuity is called the future value of the\nannuity. It is the total of all annuity payments and the accumulated compound interest as illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nFig. 3\nTo see how the annuity process works, consider the table in Figure 4 below. This table depicts an\nordinary 6-month annuity commencing on Jan. 1 and ending on June 30. The monthly payments are\n$1000 and the annual interest rate is 6% compounded monthly. 882 9 Financial Mathematics\nBalance at\nBalance on the first Interest earned Deposit at end of\nMonth end of the\nday of the month during the interval the month\nmonth\nJan $0 $0 $1000 $1000\nFebruary $1000 $5.00 $1000 $2005\nMarch $2005 $10.025 = $10.03 $1000 $3015.03\nApril $3015.03 $15.075 = $15.08 $1000 $4030.11\nMay $4030.11 $20.15 $1000 $5050.26\nJune $5050.26 $25.25 $1000 $6075.51\nFig. 4\nSince this is an ordinary annuity the payments are made at the end of the month. Interest is calculated\nas simple interest I = Prt where r = 0.06 and t = 1/12 year and P = the balance at the beginning of\nthe month.\nThe first payment of $1000 is deposited at the end of January and therefore no interest is earned for the\nmonth of January. At the beginning of February there is $1000 in the account. Interest for the month of\nFebruary is I = $1000(0.06)(1/12) = $5. At the end of February there will be a deposit of $1000 so the\nbalance at the end of February is $1000 + $5 + $1000 = $2005.\nAt the beginning of March there is $2005 in the account. Interest for the month of March will be I =\n$2005(0.06)(1/12) = $10.025 or $10.03 (rounded off). At the end of March $1000 is deposited so the\nbalance at the end of March is $2005 + $$10.03 + $1000 = $3015.03.\nAt the beginning of April there is $3015.03 in the account. Interest for the month of April will be I =\n$3015.03(0.06)(1/12) = $15.075 or $15.08 (rounded off). At the end of April $1000 is deposited so the\nbalance at the end of April is $3015.03 + $$15.08 + $1000 = $4030.11.\nThe process is continued for the remaining two months. At the end of June, the balance will be\n$6075.51. This is the future value of the annuity, which is the total of all annuity payments and the\naccumulated compound interest.\nNotice that with an ordinary annuity the interest calculation is based on the balance at the beginning\nof the interval. Since the first payment does not occur until the end of the first payment interval there\nwill not be any interest in the first payment interval. Although the term of the annuity is six\nmonths there will only be five intervals where interest is calculated.\nWith an annuity due the payment would be made at the beginning of each payment interval so for a six\nmonth term there would be six interest calculations. Since many loans are set up as an annuity due it is\nadvantageous to the lending institution (but not to the loan recipient).\nThe calculation of the future value of an annuity can be very time consuming. Fortunately there is a\nformula for this. 9.4 Annuities 883\nOrdinary Annuity Formula\nThe ordinary annuity formula is:\nA = amount of annuity (Future Value)\nP = periodic payment amount\nwhere r = annual interest rate\nn = number of compounding periods per year\nt = time (in years)\nIt is important to note that there are variations on how the ordinary annuity formula is written. This is\ndue to the way in which the variables are defined. The formula that is provided in this section defines r\nas the annual interest rate, n as the number of compounding periods per year, and t as the time in\nyears (term of the annuity in years).\nEXAMPLE 1\nAssume that the formula will be used to calculate the future value of a two year ordinary annuity that offers\nan annual interest rate of 6%, monthly payments of $1000, and monthly compounding.\nDefine each of the variables but do not calculate the future value.\nSolution\nA = amount of annuity (Future Value) = unknown\nP = periodic payment amount = $1000\nwhere r = annual interest rate = 6% = 0.06\nn = number of compounding periods per year = 12\nt = time (in years) = 2 years\nNote that the term of the annuity is 2 years. The interest calculation involves monthly compounding so n = 12\nsince there are 12 compounding periods in a year. 884 9 Financial Mathematics\nTRY IT 1\nAssume that the formula will be used to calculate the future value of a 1 year ordinary annuity that offers an\nannual interest rate of 3%, semiannual payments of $500, and semiannual compounding.\nDefine each of the variables but do not calculate the future value.\nShow answer\nAmount (A) = unknown\nPayment (P) = $500\nAnnual interest rate (r) = 3% = 0.03\nNumber of compounding period (n) = 2\nTime (t) = 1 year\nEXAMPLE 2\nAssume that the formula will be used to calculate the future value of a 6 month ordinary annuity that offers\nan annual interest rate of 4.8%, weekly payments of $100, and weekly compounding.\nDefine each of the variables but do not calculate the future value.\nSolution\nA = amount of annuity (Future Value) = unknown\nP = periodic payment amount = $100\nr = annual interest rate = 4.8% = 0.048\nn = number of compounding periods per year = 52\nt = time (in years) = 0.5 years\nNote that although the term of the annuity is 1/2 year, the interest calculation involves weekly compounding\nso n = 52 since there are 52 compounding periods in a year.\nTRY IT 2\nAssume that the formula will be used to calculate the future value of a 9 month ordinary annuity that offers\nan annual interest rate of 5.5%, monthly payments of $200, and monthly compounding.\nDefine each of the variables but do not calculate the future value.\nShow answer\nA = unknown\nP = $200 9.4 Annuities 885\nr = 5.5%\nn = 12\nt = 0.75 years\nWe will now use the formula to calculate the future value of a six month ordinary annuity that offers\nan annual interest rate of 6%, monthly payments, and monthly compounding.\nEXAMPLE 3\nUse the annuity formula to find the annuity amount in 6 months if $1000 is deposited monthly at 6%\ncompounded monthly.

Perhaps an individual or business wishes to purchase a larger\nticket item such as an appliance or a piece of equipment in one year\u2019s time. Rather than taking out a\nloan they could choose to deposit a specific amount every month so as to accumulate the required funds\nby the end of the one year. The amount that needs to be deposited is represented by the payment in the\nannuity formula. The formula must be solved for the payment (P).\nPeriodic Payment Formula\nThe periodic payment formula is:\nP = periodic payment amount\nA = annuity amount\nr = annual interest rate\nn = number of times interest is calculated in a year\nt = time (in years)\nEXAMPLE 8\nA home bakery wants to purchase a new oven in one year\u2019s time.

In the case where this is a sum of money the amount that will be\npaid by the borrower will include the original amount plus interest.\nSome loans require full payment on the maturity date of the loan. The maturity date is when all\nprincipal and/or interest must be repaid to the the lender. Consider a one year loan of $1000 at a simple\n899 900 9 Financial Mathematics\ninterest rate of 5%. At the end of one year (the maturity date) the borrower will pay back the original\n$1000 plus the interest of $50 for a total of $1050.\nFor major purchases such as vehicles or furniture there is a different type of loan, called the\ninstallment loan. The average consumer cannot afford to pay $25000 or more for a new vehicle and\nthey may not want to wait three or four years until they have saved enough money to do so. The\nqualifying consumer has the option of paying for the item with an installment loan.\nInstallment loans do not require full repayment of the loan on a specific date. With an installment loan\nthe borrower is required to make regular (installment) payments until the loan is paid off. Each\ninstallment payment will include an interest charge. An installment loan can vary in length from a few\nyears to perhaps twenty years or more (in the case of real estate).\nConsider an installment loan for a $4000 television. The purchaser takes out a $4000 loan with a four-\nyear term at an interest rate of 4.5%. The monthly installment payments will be $91.21. Although the\ntelevision has a purchase price of $4000, the total cost to the purchaser will be more than $4000. The\ntotal of the installment payments will be:\nTotal Installment Payments = Number of Installment Payments x Payment Amount =\n4 years x 12 payments/year x $91.21/mth = $4378.08\nThe $4000 television ends up costing $4378.08 because the consumer is charged interest. Each\npayment includes an interest component that adds to the overall cost of the item. The total of the\ninterest charges is referred to as the finance charge on the loan.\nFinance Charge\nThe finance charge is the sum of the interest charges on a loan. These interest charges are embedded in the\ninstallment payments. To calculate the finance charge:\nFinance Charge = Total Installment Payments \u2013 Loan Amount\n= (Number of Installment Payments x Payment Amount) \u2013 Loan Amount\nFor the $4000 television the finance charge will be calculated as follows:\nFinance charge = Total Installment Payments \u2013 Loan Amount =\n(4 years x 12 payments/year x $91.21/payment) \u2013 $4000 = $4378.08 \u2013 $4000 = $378.08\nOver the 4-year term of the loan the purchaser will have paid the $4000 loan amount plus an additional\n$378.08 in interest (the finance charge).\nSometimes the borrower will make an initial payment at the time of purchase. This is called a down\npayment. When a down payment is made the remaining amount is the amount financed or the loan\namount. 9.5 Loans and Mortgages 901\nAmount Financed\nThe amount financed or loan amount is the purchase price of the item less any down payment:\nAmount Financed = Purchase Price \u2013 Down Payment\nConsider the $4000 television. Assume the purchaser makes a down payment of $1500.\nThe amount financed is: Purchase Price \u2013 Down Payment = $4000 \u2013 $1500 = $2500.\nIn this case the purchaser borrows $2500 rather than $4000. The amount financed is therefore $2500.\nAssuming the same 4-year term and an interest rate of 4.5%, the installment payments on the $2500\nwill be reduced to $57.01 per month. In this case the finance charge will be calculated as follows:\nFinance charge = Total Installment Payments \u2013 Loan Amount =\n(4 years x 12 payments/year x $57.01/payment) \u2013 $2500 = $2736.48 \u2013 $2500 = $236.48\nWith the down payment of $2500 the total finance charges will be reduced to $236.48 from $378.08.\nThe total cost of the television to the purchaser will be:\nPurchase Price + Finance Charge\n= $4000 + $236.48 = $4236.48\nAlternatively we can calculate:\nTotal Installment Payment + Down Payment\n= $2736.48 + $1500 = $4236.48\nAs one can see, the finance charges are a hidden but added cost. This cost will become more\npronounced with more expensive purchases such as with real estate.\nInstallment Loan Terminology\nTotal Installment Payments = Number of payments x Payment Amount\nFinance Charge = Total Installment Payments \u2013 Loan Amount\nAmount Financed or Loan Amount = Purchase Price of Item \u2013 Down payment 902 9 Financial Mathematics\nEXAMPLE 1\nPaul purchased a home entertainment system at a total cost of $6000.

A portion of each\npayment will be applied to the interest charge and a portion will be applied to the principal amount of\nthe loan. Although each payment is equal, the amount that applies to the interest versus the prinipal will\nchange with each payment period. We can get a better sense of the impact that a loan payment has by\nexamining the amortization schedule for a loan.\nConsider the amortization table for the installment loan in Example 5. Recall that the loan amount is\n$5000 at 6% for 5 years and annual payments are $1186.98. Note then that for each year the sum of the\ninterest and principal is equivalent to the payment of $1186.98. Refer to Figure 1 for the amortization\nschedule of this loan.\nFig. 1\nTo calculate the interest (I) we use the simple interest formula I = Prt . The principal (P) will be the\nbeginning balance for each year. The time in years is the portion of the year for which interest is being\ncalculated. In this example the time (t) is one year and the interest rate is 6%.\nIn Year 1 the interest on the loan of $5000 will be:\nI = Prt = $5000 x 0.06 x 1yr = $300.\nThe periodic payment amount is $1186.98 and the portion that will go towards interest is $300.\nThe portion that will go towards paying down the principal will be:\nperiodic payment amount \u2013 interest =\n$1186.98 \u2013 $300 = $886.98.\nAlthough the payment was $1186.98, only $886.98 will be applied to the outstanding loan amount. At\nthe end of year 1 the remaining balance on the loan will be:\nbeginnining balance \u2013 portion applied to the principal\n= $5000 \u2013 $886.98 = $4113.02\nIn Year 2 the beginning balance on the loan is $4113.02. The interest on the loan will be:\nI = Prt = $4113.02 x 0.06 x 1yr = $246.78.\nNote that interest is calculated on the remaining balance of the loan, not on the original\n$5000. For the periodic payment of $1186.98, the portion that will go towards interest is\n$246.78.\nThe portion that will go towards paying down the principal will be:\nperiodic payment amount \u2013 interest\n= $1186.98 \u2013 $246.78 = $940.20.\nAt the end of year 2 the remaining balance on the loan will be:\nbeginnining balance \u2013 portion applied to the principal\n= $4113.02 \u2013 $940.20 = $3172.82\nIn Year 3 the beginning balance on the loan is $3172.82. The interest on the loan will be: 910 9 Financial Mathematics\nI = Prt = $3172.82 x 0.06 x 1yr = $190.37\nThe portion that will go towards paying down the principal will be:\nperiodic payment amount \u2013 interest\n= $1186.98 \u2013 $190.37 = $996.61\nAt the end of year 3 the remaining balance on the loan will be:\nbeginnining balance \u2013 portion applied to the principal\n= $3172.82 \u2013 $996.61 = $2176.21\nThe cycle repeats for five years until the loan is paid off. If we add the interest charges in the table they\nwill total to $934.91. This is the same as the finance charge (ignoring the 1\u00a2 difference due to\nrounding) that was calculated in Example 5.\nThe amortization table illustrates that in the early periods of the loan a larger portion of the payment\ngoes towards interest and a smaller portion contributes to paying down the principal (loan) amount.\nOver time a larger portion of the payment will be applied towards paying down the balance on the loan.\nFor large purchases it can take several payment periods before the payment contributes substantailly to\nthe principal balance of the loan. A down payment is beneficial as it will reduce the total finance\ncharge.\nMortgages\nA long term loan that is used for the purchase of a house is called a mortgage. It is called a mortgage\nbecause the lending agency requires that the house be used as collateral for the loan. This means that if\nthe mortgage holder is unable to make the payments the lender can take possession of the house.\nMortgages generally tend to be for longer time periods than an installment loan and the terms of the\nmortgage will often change over the course of the mortgage. Take for example the purchase of a house\nwith a twenty year mortgage. The purchaser might sign a mortgage agreement for a five year term. The\nmortgage agreement will include the interest rate, the frequency of payments and additional rules\nwhich may allow the mortgage holder to make lump sum payments or change the payment amount. At\nthe end of the five year term a new agreement will be required and the conditions of the mortgage\nusually change.\nAlthough it is possible to do the calculations manually, that is beyond the scope of this book. We will\nuse technology to calculate the periodic payments and interest charges and to generate an amortization\nschedule.\nExample 8 will illustrate that amortizing a mortgage is similar to amortizing other loans except that the\nmortgage amortization generally involves many more payment periods.\nEXAMPLE 8\nA $400,000 home is purchased with a 20% down payment on a 20-year mortgage at a fixed interest rate of\n3.4%. 9.5 Loans and Mortgages 911\na) Determine the down payment.\nb) Use an online mortgage calculator to determine the monthly payment and the total interest paid.\nc) Generate an annual amortization schedule.\nd) Determine the total payments for one year\ne) Use the table to determine how much of the first year\u2019s payments will go towards interest and how much\nwill go towards the principal.\nf) Use the table to determine how much of the final year\u2019s payments will go towards interest and how much\nwill go towards the principal.\nSolution:\na) The down payment will be 20% x $400,000 = $80,000.\nb) The monthly payment will be $1839.47 and the total interest will be $121, 472.75.\nc)\nd) In one year the total payments will be 12 x $1839.47 = $22,073.64. 912 9 Financial Mathematics\ne) Of the first year\u2019s payments, almost half, $10,703.92, will go towards interest. $11,369.72 will go towards\npaying down the principal.\nf) Of the final year\u2019s payments, $401.22 will go towards interest. $21, 672.42 will go towards the principal.\nTRY IT 8\nA 20-year mortgage is obtained to purchase a $550,000 home with a 15% down payment at a fixed interest\nrate of 4.6%.\na) Determine the down payment.\nb) Use an online mortgage calculator to determine the monthly payment and the total interest paid.\nc) Generate an annual amortization schedule.\nd) Determine the total payments for one year\ne) Use the table to determine how much of the first year\u2019s payments will go towards interest and how much\nwill go towards the principal.\nf) Use the table to determine how much of the final year\u2019s payments will go towards interest and how much\nwill go towards the principal.\nShow answer\na) The down payment will be $82,500\nb) the monthly payment will be $2982.93 and the total interest will be $248,403.36\nd) In the first year the total payments will be $35,795.16.\ne) In the first year $21,199.84, will go to interest. $14,595.32 will go towards paying down the principal.\nf) In the final year $876.17 will go to interest. $34,918.99 will go towards paying down the principal.\nEXAMPLE 9\nA young couple have received an inheritance and they now have enough money for a down payment on their\nfirst home.
