Group members respond to\nthose signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.\nStrong emotional leadership depends on having high levels of emotional intelligence (EI).\nKey Terms\nEmotional Leadership: Emotional leadership is a process that leaders use to influence their followers in a common goal.\nemotional intelligence: the ability, capacity, or skill to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of oneself, of others, and of groups\nLeadership is a process of motivating people and mobilizing resources to accomplish common goals. Leaders direct the path to achieve\nthe goal and lead the group to accomplish objectives along the way. The leader may or may not have formal authority. According to the\ntrait theory of leadership, some traits play a vital role in creating leaders, such as intelligence, adjustment, extroversion, conscientiousness,\nopenness to experience, and general self-efficacy. One key aspect of contemporary leadership theory points to emotional leadership as a\npossible approach to accomplishing organizational aims.\nDefining Emotional Leadership\nAs leadership is all about influencing people to achieve a common goal, an \"emotional\" approach can be a very important step of the\nprocess. A leader's mood or emotions have an effect on the group in three major ways:\nLeaders can influence followers through the mechanism of \"emotional contagion.\" Those in an optimistic mood can effect their group in a\npositive way by instilling a positive outlook. For example, a charismatic leader can inspire feelings of confidence in a group's ability to\nachieve challenging goals.\nGroup affective tone refers to the collective mood of individuals. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have more positive feelings\ntoward each other than groups with leaders who convey the opposite. The perceived efficacy of group processes such as coordination,\ncollaborative effort, and task strategy can also effect the emotions of followers.\nPublic expressions of mood affect how group members think and act in relation to other group members. For example, demonstrating\npositive emotions such as happiness or satisfaction can signal that leaders acknowledge solid progress toward goals. Those signals\ninfluence how followers think about their work, which can benefit their work together.\nEmotional Intelligence\nStrong emotional leadership depends on having high levels of emotional intelligence (EI). EI is the ability to identify, assess, and control\nthe emotions of oneself, of others, and of groups. The two most prominent approaches to understanding EI are the ability and trait EI\nmodels.\nThe EI ability model views emotions as useful sources of information that help a person make sense of and navigate the social\nenvironment. The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to\nconnect those emotions to how they think. There are four key emotional skills\u2014perceiving, using, understanding, and managing:\nPerceiving emotions \u2013 The ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts\u2014including one's own\nemotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional\ninformation possible.\nUsing emotions \u2013 The ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem-solving.\nEmotionally intelligent people can capitalize fully upon their changing moods according to the task at hand.\nUnderstanding emotions \u2013 The ability to comprehend emotional language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions.\nFor example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, as well as the ability\nto recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.\nManaging emotions \u2013 The ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. The emotionally intelligent person can harness\nemotions\u2014even negative ones\u2014and manage them to achieve intended goals.\nBecause the EI ability model focuses on behaviors that can be learned, it is used as the basis of leadership development activities.\nThe EI trait model focuses not on skills but on personality characteristics and behavioral dispositions such as empathy, consideration, and\nself-awareness. Trait EI refers to individuals' self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. It is measured by looking at degrees of emotional\nwell-being, self-control, emotionalism, and sociability. EI traits can be challenging to assess accurately because they rely on self-reporting,\nrather than observations of actual behaviors. Personality traits are generally believed to be resistant to significant change, so the EI trait\nmodel is used to help people better manage their emotional abilities within the constraints of existing behavioral tendencies.\nPresident Barack Obama: Many observers identify\nPresident Obama as a good example of an emotional\nleader.\nInteractive Leadership\nInteractive leadership involves leaders' engaging followers to increase their understanding of tasks and goals.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the importance of interactive leadership in generating motivation and commitment to shared objectives\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nInteractive leaders engage followers in understanding goals and tasks to contribute more effectively to achieving them.\nReaching out to employees and helping them understand different aspects of the organization serve to engage them in the\norganization's goals.\nInteractive leaders demonstrate their willingness to engage others in a variety of ways, including group decision making, building trust\nthrough openness and transparency, and being visible and accessible to followers.\nKey Terms\nInteractive Leadership: Style of leading that engages employees in understanding tasks and goals so they can be effective contributors\nto achieving them.\nEffective leadership requires communicating and engaging with followers. The interactive style of leadership makes it a priority to inform\nfollowers about important matters related to their goals and tasks and to clarify understanding. Interactive leaders are proactive in\nseeking information and opinions from followers. Reaching out to employees in this way helps build their commitment to achieving team\nand organizational goals.\nInteractive leaders take the opportunity to meet with followers to explain their vision and persuade them of its value. This encounter\nfacilitates behavior change; the better people understand what is expected of them, the more they can modify how they act. While\ninteractive leaders may make use of technology to share information, they also seek the richer exchanges that face-to-face\ncommunication allows.\nExamples of Interactive Leadership\nInteractive leaders engage followers in a variety of ways. When making group decisions they may solicit information, perceptions, and\neven recommendations from team members. To underscore a commitment to openness and to build trust, an interactive leader freely\nshares information rather than keeping it as a basis of power over others.\nInteractive leaders value individual contributions and maintain relationships that foster mutual respect. They also make themselves visible\nand accessible to followers; some maintain an \"open-door\" policy to signal that they are open to dialogue and hearing from others. In this\nway, interactive leaders are role models who exhibit the quality of reciprocal interactions they seek with others.\nInteractive leadership in action: An interactive\nleader shares information and answers questions to\nclarify goals and tasks.\nMoral Leadership\nEthical or moral leadership demonstrates responsibility for doing what is right.\nLearning Objectives\nApply ethical standards to leadership perspectives, explaining the relevance of integrity and responsibility to leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nEthical or moral leadership involves leading in a manner that respects the rights and dignity of others.\nThe duties of leaders also include the responsibility to ensure standards of moral and ethical conduct.\nAn effective leader influences a subordinate's attitude and values. Therefore, a moral leader will stimulate a moral influence.\nThe best leaders make known their values and ethics and reflect them in their leadership styles and actions.\nKey Terms\nmoral: Of or relating to principles of right and wrong in behavior, especially for teaching right behavior.\nMoral or ethical leadership involves the commitment to doing what is right according to societal and cultural beliefs and values about\nacceptable behavior. Ethical leaders distinguish themselves by making decisions in the service of long-term benefits that may be\ninconvenient, unpopular, and even unprofitable in the short-term. Moral leaders have a clear understanding of their own values and hold\nthemselves accountable for them. Leaders who are ethical demonstrate a level of integrity that emphasizes their trustworthiness, and this\ntrust enables followers to accept the leader's vision.\nMoral leadership means making decisions that respect the rights and dignity of others. Moral leaders consider the viewpoints and needs\nof all who have an interest in a decision's outcomes, rather than simply the most powerful. In this way, moral leaders use their own power\nto convince others of the rightness of their choices.\nNelson Mandela, a respected\nmoral leader: Nelson Mandela,\nthe President of South Africa\nfrom 1994 to 1999, is an\nexample of moral leadership.\nMandela fought to end\napartheid and establish equality\nin his country.\nMoral leadership is important for protecting an organization 's reputation. The ethics leaders exhibit reflects on their organizations, as well\non themselves. Acting ethically preserves an organization's legitimacy as it uses societal resources to achieve its aims.\nMoral leadership goes beyond doing what is legal. Laws establish clear boundaries of what is acceptable, but ethics often involves more\nambiguous questions. These dilemmas are where the judgment of a leader comes into play. The personal character of leaders influences\ntheir ability and willingness to act on moral principles. Moral leaders gain the respect of followers, who are then more likely to identify\nwith their leaders and the goals they set.\nMoral leaders also play an important role in communicating an organization's values. They do this as role models of ethical behavior and\nin how they speak about the moral dimension of their decisions and actions. In this way, moral leaders take responsibility for the moral\nclimate in their organizations and help others understand, share, and act in accordance with those values.\nServant Leadership\nServant leadership involves feeling responsible for the world and actively contributing to the well-being of people and communities.\nLearning Objectives\nDefine servant leadership using the behaviors and characteristics described by Larry C. Spears\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nServant leadership is apparent in leaders who feel a responsibility for the well-being of others and their communities.\nA servant leader looks at what people need, helps them solve problems, and promotes the personal development of others.\nLarry C. Spears identified ten characteristics central to servant leaders: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion,\nconceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the personal growth of people, and building communities.\nKey Terms\nServant Leadership: An approach to leading in which leaders take responsibility for contributing to the well-being of people and\ncommunity.\nLarry C. Spears: Served as president and CEO of the Robert K. Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership.\nServant leadership involves taking responsibility for actively contributing to the well-being of people and communities. It begins with a\nfeeling of wanting to work for the benefit of others. A servant leader regards people's needs and identifies ways to help them to solve\nproblems and promote personal development. Servant leaders focus on the well-being of others and on helping them improve their\ncircumstances.\nCharacteristics of Servant Leadership\nLarry C. Spears identified ten characteristics that are central to servant leadership:\nListening: A servant leader solicits information and engages in dialogue with followers to better understand their needs.\nEmpathy: Servant leaders identify with and show concern for the needs of followers. In this way they model respect.\nHealing: A servant leader is sensitive to and supports the emotional health of others.\nAwareness: Servant leaders exhibits self-knowledge of their own values, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses.\nPersuasion: Servant leaders do not take advantage of their power and status by coercing compliance; they try to influence others through\nreason.\nConceptualization: A servant leader thinks beyond day-to-day realities to identify future possibilities.\nForesight: A servant leader understands intellectually as well as through intuition how the past, present, and future are connected and\nuses that knowledge to identify likely outcomes.\nStewardship: Servant leaders are mindful that they hold an organization 's resource in trust for the greater good.\nCommitment to the growth of people: A servant leader is responsible for nurturing others and for their learning and development.\nBuilding community: A servant leader builds a sense of unity and cohesion among individuals so they can work together for common\ngoals.\nShared Leadership\nShared leadership means that leadership responsibilities are distributed within a team and that members influence each other.\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe shared leadership and the conditions needed for its success\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nShared leadership occurs when two or more individuals in a group share responsibility for directing it toward its goals.\nShared leadership requires team members be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate\nthe direction of the group.\nThe team must overall be disposed to accept and rely on feedback from other team members.\nKey Terms\nShared Leadership: Style of leading in which responsibilities are distributed within a team or organization, and people within that team or\norganization lead each other.\nUnlike traditional notions of leadership that focus on the actions of an individual, shared leadership refers to responsibilities shared by\nmembers of a group. Rather than having a single designated leader, two or more members of a team with shared leadership influence the\nothers and help drive the team's performance toward its goals.\nWhile by definition a team's members share responsibility for group outcomes, shared leadership means they also hold each other\naccountable for setting the team's goals and maintaining its direction. Shared leadership can involve all team members simultaneously or\ndistribute leadership responsibilities sequentially over the group's duration. Leadership roles may be assigned based on expertise and\nexperience.\nRequirements of Shared Leadership\nResearch reveals that for shared leadership to merge and succeed, two conditions must be met:\nTeam members must be willing to extend their feedback to the team in a way that aims to influence and motivate the direction of the\ngroup.\nTeam members as a group must be disposed to accept and rely on the feedback of each other.\nThree aspects of how a group interacts can facilitate shared leadership: shared purpose, social support, and voice. Shared purpose means\nteam members have a similar understanding of the team's objective and collective goals. Social support means that team members\ncontribute to each other's emotional and psychological well-being by offering encouragement and assistance. Voice refers to the degree\nto which team members believe they have input into how the team carries out its activities. Taken together, these group dynamics can\nfoster a sense of trust and willingness to collaborate in support of team leadership.\nShared leadership also benefits from coaching from a respected person outside of the group. An external coach can provide guidance\nand advice to the team and also help individuals develop their leadership skills. Through active encouragement and positive\nreinforcement of team members who demonstrate leadership, coaching can foster independence and a sense of individual self-efficacy.\nCoaching can also nurture collective commitment to the team and its objectives, increasing the possibility that team members will\ndemonstrate personal initiative.\nTeam members sharing responsibility: Team members consult\neach other in a group that employs shared leadership.\nE-Leadership\nLeaders of virtual teams face challenges communicating and building relationships.\nLearning Objectives\nDiscuss the growing importance and technological potential of integrating leadership across chronological and geographical boundaries\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nE- leadership works across time, space, and organizational boundaries, usually strengthened by communication technology.\nCommunication is more difficult on virtual teams, and virtual leaders must emphasize the importance of effective communication to\nachieving the team's goals.\nA virtual team leader must be particularly attentive to the development of group norms and the emergence of trust, both of which are\nmade difficult by the geographic separation of team members.\nKey Terms\nE-leadership: Form of leading across time, space, and organizational boundaries, usually supported by networks of communication as\nwell as technology.\nVirtual teams are those whose members work across distances of time, space and organizational boundaries. Their interactions are made\npossible by information and communication technology. Such teams are formed to benefit from different sources of knowledge, to lower\ncosts, or to create flexibility and responsiveness in staffing. By their nature, virtual teams have particular leadership needs.\nLeaders of virtual teams face communication challenges. They do not have the benefit of many opportunities for rich, face-to-face\ninteractions. The absence of in-person interaction has at least two consequences. It can take more effort to gather and disseminate\ninformation needed to support a group's performance. It also makes it more difficult for a leader to develop relationships. The lack of\nsocial interaction can inhibit trust and group cohesion. The geographic distribution of virtual team members may also involve linguistic or\ncultural differences that can create barriers to effective communication. To address these communication challenges, e-leaders must\ncommunicate more frequently, provide more complete information, and use multiple means of communication technology effectively.\nThe virtual team leader must also encourage awareness of how group norms are developing. Without regular personal interactions,\nmembers may not be aware of how their behavior is perceived by others and how that behavior can affect the team's performance. The\nvirtual leader must make and share observations about how team members work together and encourage them to be attentive to the\nprocess by which they collaborate, rather than focus solely on tasks. Drawing explicit attention to group norms and reinforcing them by\nbeing a role model, the virtual leader can help build trust between team members and make them a more effective team.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
