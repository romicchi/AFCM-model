The\nBig Five personality traits are openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.\nThese five factors are assumed to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits. They were defined and described by several\ndifferent researchers during multiple periods of research.\nEmployees are sometimes tested on the Big Five personality traits in collaborative situations to determine what strong personality traits\nthey can add to a group dynamic.\nBusinesses need to understand their people as well as their operations and processes. Understanding the personality components that\ndrive the employee behavior is a very useful informational data point for management.\nKey Terms\nneuroticism: The tendency to easily experience unpleasant emotions such as anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability.\nThe concept of the \"Big Five\" personality traits is taken from psychology and includes five broad domains that describe personality. These\nfive personality traits are used to understand the relationship between personality and various behaviors.\nThese five factors are assumed to represent the basic structure behind all personality traits. These five factors were defined and described\nby several different researchers during multiple periods of research. However, as a result of their broad definitions, the Big Five personality\ntraits are not nearly as powerful in predicting and explaining actual behavior as are the more numerous lower-level, specific traits.\nThe Five Traits\nThe traits are:\nOpenness - Openness to experience describes a person's degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and preference for novelty and variety.\nSome disagreement remains about how to interpret this factor, which is sometimes called intellect.\nConscientiousness - Conscientiousness is a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement. Conscientiousness\nalso refers to planning, organization, and dependability.\nExtraversion - Extraversion describes energy, positive emotions, assertiveness, sociability, talkativeness, and the tendency to seek\nstimulation in the company of others.\nAgreeableness - Agreeableness is the tendency to be compassionate and cooperative towards others rather than suspicious and\nantagonistic.\nNeuroticism - Neuroticism describes vulnerability to unpleasant emotions like anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability. Neuroticism\nalso refers to an individual's level of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to as emotional stability.\nApplicability to Organizational Behavior\nWhen scored for individual feedback, these traits are frequently presented as percentile scores. For example, a conscientiousness rating in\nthe 80th percentile indicates a relatively strong sense of responsibility and orderliness, whereas an extraversion rating in the 5th percentile\nindicates an exceptional need for solitude and quiet.\nQuestionnaires for the Big Five personality\ntraits: The Big Five personality traits are\ntypically examined through surveys and\nquestionnaires.\nEmployees are sometimes tested on the Big Five personality traits in collaborative situations to determine what strong personality traits\nthey can add to the group dynamic. Personality tests can also be part of the behavioral interview process when a company is hiring to\ndetermine an individual's ability to act on certain personality characteristics.\nUnderstanding its people is as important to a company as understanding its operations and processes. Understanding what personality\ncomponents drive the behavior of subordinates is a highly useful informational data point for management that can be used to determine\nwhat type of assignments should be set, how motivation should be pursued, what team dynamics may arise, and how to best approach\nconflict and/or praise when applicable.\nThe Myers-Briggs Personality Types\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a commonly used personality test exploring 16 personality types.\nLearning Objectives\nSummarize the Myers-Briggs (MBTI) personality assessment perspective and the four personality types it measures\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a questionnaire that measures the psychological preferences that influence how\npeople perceive the world and make decisions. The MBTI sorts psychological differences into four opposite pairs, resulting in 16 possible\npersonality types.\nNone of these types are good or bad; however, Briggs and Myers theorized that societies as a whole naturally prefer one overall type.\nThe four type preferences are Extraversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judgment vs. Perception. One\npossible classification of a personality type could be ESTJ: extraversion (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), judgment (J).\nMyers-Briggs tests are frequently used in the areas of career counseling, team building, group dynamics, professional development,\nmarketing, leadership training, executive coaching, life coaching, personal development, marriage counseling, and workers' compensation\nclaims.\nKey Terms\nForced-choice: A type of question used in psychological tests that only allows the individual to choose between one of two possible\nanswers to each question.\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment is a questionnaire designed to measure the psychological preferences that shape how\npeople perceive the world and make decisions. The original developers of the personality inventory were Katharine Cook Briggs and her\ndaughter, Isabel Briggs Myers. They began work on a questionnaire during World War II to help women who were entering the industrial\nworkforce as part of the war effort to understand their own personality preferences and use that knowledge to identify the jobs that\nwould be best for them. That initial questionnaire grew into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which was first published in 1962. The MBTI\nfocuses on normal populations and emphasizes the value of naturally occurring differences between people.\nMBTI personality types: The dimensions\nof the MBTI are seen here, along with\ntemperament descriptions associated with\neach personality trait.\nMBTI Defined\nThe MBTI sorts psychological differences into four opposite pairs, or dichotomies, resulting in 16 possible psychological personality types.\nNone of these types are good or bad; however, Briggs and Myers theorized that societies as a whole naturally prefer one overall type. In\nthe same way that writing with the left hand is hard work for a right-handed person, people find that using their opposite psychological\npreferences is difficult, even if they can become proficient by practicing and developing those different ways of thinking and behaving.\nThe 16 Personality Types\nThe 16 personality types are typically referred to by an abbreviation of four letters\u2014the initial letters of each of their four type\npreferences. The four type preferences are: Extraversion vs. Introversion, Sensing vs. Intuition, Thinking vs. Feeling, and Judgment vs.\nPerception.\nOne possible classification of a personality type is ESTJ: extraversion (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), judgment (J). Another example is INFP:\nintroversion (I), intuition (N), feeling (F), perception (P); and so on for all 16 possible type combinations. In this situation, extroversion\nmeans \"outward turning\" and introversion means \"inward turning.\" People who prefer judgment over perception are not necessarily more\njudgmental or less perceptive; they simply prefer one over the other. The most common combination from the Myers-Briggs test is ISFJ or\nIntrovert, Sensing, Feeling, and Judgment.\nThe current North American English version of the Myers-Briggs test includes 93 forced-choice questions. Forced-choice means that the\nindividual has to choose only one of two possible answers to each question. Myers-Briggs tests are frequently used in the areas of career\ncounseling, team building, group dynamics, professional development, marketing, leadership training, executive coaching, life coaching,\npersonal development, marriage counseling, and workers' compensation claims.\nRelevance to Management\nOne of the most common contexts for using the MBTI is team-building and employee personality identification. Managers are tasked with\ncreating work groups and teams with a variety of human resources, which is a complicated social process of intuitively estimating who\nwould complement who in group dynamics. The MBTI test is an excellent tool to measure and more accurately predict how individuals will\ninteract in a group and what types of skills they may bring to the table.\nOne particularly good example is in the IE relationship. Understanding which employees in a team are naturally introverted is a useful way\nto ensure that a manager doesn't miss out on these employees' opinions just because they are naturally quiet. The manager could meet\nwith them privately and informally\u2014over coffee, for instance\u2014and get their opinions. Similarly, knowing which members tend to be\nintuitive thinkers (NT) and which tend to understand emotions and be observant (SF) can lead the manager to give them very different\ntasks, though the two might work well together in a group setting since they balance each other. Management can use this tool to\nminimize conflict and optimize performance.\nOther Important Trait Theories\nThe disposition theory, three fundamental traits, and HEXACO model of personality structure are applicable to the work place.\nLearning Objectives\nExamine various perspectives on personality and how to measure it in the context of organizational behavior\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nSome important personality trait theories are: Gordon Allport's dispositions, Hans Eysenck's three fundamental traits and Michael Aston\nand Kibeom Lee's six-dimensional HEXACO model of personality structure.\nGordon Allport's disposition theory includes cardinal traits, central traits, and secondary traits. Cardinal traits dominate an individual's\nbehavior, central traits are common to all individuals, and secondary traits are peripheral.\nHans Eysenck rejected the idea that there are \"tiers\" of personality traits, theorizing instead that there are just three traits that describe\nhuman personality: extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism.\nThe HEXACO model of personality identifies six factors of personality: Honesty, Emotionality, Extroversion, Agreeableness,\nConscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.\nKey Terms\ntrait: An identifying characteristic, habit, or trend.\nextroversion: Concern with or an orientation toward others or what is outside oneself; behavior expressing such an orientation.\nDisposition: A tendency or inclination to respond a certain way under given circumstances.\nThe \"Big Five\" describes five important personality traits, and the Myers-Briggs Test identifies a number of different personality types, but\nthere are other important traits that have been studied by psychologists. Some of these traits include Gordon Allport's dispositions, Hans\nEysenck's three fundamental traits, and Michael Aston and Kibeom Lee's six dimensional HEXACO model of personality structure. All of\nthese theories discuss important personality traits that have been studied and identified.\nAllport's Disposition Theory\nGordon Allport's disposition theory includes cardinal traits, central traits, and secondary traits.\nGordon Allport:\nAmerican\npsychologist\nGordon Allport\nwrote an\ninfluential work\non prejudice, The\nNature of\nPrejudice,\npublished in\n1979.\nCardinal trait: A trait that dominates and shapes a person's behavior. These are the ruling passions/obsessions, such as the desire for\nmoney, fame, love, etc.\nCentral trait: A general characteristic that every person has to some degree. These are the basic building blocks that shape most of our\nbehavior, although they are not as overwhelming as cardinal traits. An example of a central trait would be honesty.\nSecondary trait: a characteristic seen only in certain circumstances (such as particular likes or dislikes that only very close friend might\nknow). They must be included to provide a complete picture of human complexity.\nEysenck's Extroversion and Neuroticism Theory\nHans Eysenck rejected the idea that there are \"tiers\" of personality traits, theorizing instead that there are just three traits that describe\nhuman personality. These traits are extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. Extroversion and neuroticism provide a two-dimensional\nspace to describe individual differences in behavior. Eysenck described these as analogous to latitude and longitude describing a point on\nthe Earth. An individual could rate high on both neuroticism and extroversion, low on both traits, or somewhere in between. Where an\nindividual falls on the spectrum determines her/his overall personality traits.\nThe third dimension, psychoticism, was added to the model in the late 1970s as a result of collaborations between Eysenck and his wife,\nSybil B. G. Eysenck.\nAston and Lee's HEXACO Model of Personality\nAston and Lee's six-dimensional HEXACO model of personality structure is based on a lexical hypothesis that analyzes the adjectives used\nin different to describe personality, beginning with English. Subsequent research was conducted in other languages, including Croatian,\nDutch, Filipino, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Polish, and Turkish. Comparisons of the results revealed six emergent\nfactors. The six factors are generally named Honesty-Humility (H), Emotionality (E), Extroversion (X), Agreeableness (A), Conscientiousness\n(C), and Openness to Experience (O). After the adjectives that describe each of these six factors were collected using self-reports, they\nwere distilled to four traits that describe each factor.\nHonesty-Humility (H): Sincerity, Fairness, Greed Avoidance, Modesty\nEmotionality (E): Fearfulness, Anxiety, Dependence, Sentimentality\nExtroversion (X): Social Self-Esteem, Social Boldness, Sociability, Liveliness\nAgreeableness (A): Forgivingness, Gentleness, Flexibility, Patience\nConscientiousnes (C): Organization, Diligence, Perfectionism, Prudence\nOpenness to Experience (O): Aesthetic Appreciation, Inquisitiveness, Creativity, Unconventionality\nThese three personality trait theories, among others, are used to describe and define personalities today in psychology and in\norganizational behavior.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
