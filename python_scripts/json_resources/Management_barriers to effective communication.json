Home Subjects\nBoundless Management\nCommunication\nBarriers to Effective Communication\nChoosing the Type of Communication\nThe medium, or channel, of business communication influences its effectiveness.\nLearning Objectives\nClassify the advantages of using the varying communication channels\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nBeing able to determine the most appropriate channel of communication is critical to effectively communicating.\nCommunication channels vary from richer to leaner depending on their degree of interaction.\nOral communication tends to be richer than most written communication.\nKey Terms\noral: Spoken rather than written.\nIn communications, a channel is the means of passing information from a sender to a recipient. Determining the most appropriate\nchannel, or medium, is critical to the effectiveness of communication. Channels include oral means such as telephone calls and\npresentations, and written modes such as reports, memos, and email.\nCommunications differ along a scale from richer to leaner. Rich media are more interactive than lean media and provide opportunities for\nimmediate two-way communication. For instance, a face-to-face conversation is a rich medium because the receiver can ask questions\nand respond to the message as they process it. The main channels are grouped below from richest to leanest:\nRichest channels: face-to-face meeting; in-person oral presentation\nRich channels: online meeting; videoconference\nLean channels: teleconference; phone call; voice message; video\nLeanest channels: blog; report; brochure; newsletter; flier; email\nOral communications tend to be richer channels because information can be conveyed through speech as well as nonverbally through\ntone of voice and body language. Oral forms of communication can range from a casual conversation with a colleague to a formal\npresentation in front of many employees. Richer media are well suited to complex messages, as well as disturbing messages, since they\ncan provide opportunities to clarify meaning, reiterate information, and display emotions.\nBill Gates speaking at a school: A speaker giving a large\npresentation is an example of oral communication.\nWhile written communication does not have the advantage of immediacy and interaction, it can be the most effective means of conveying\nlarge amounts of information. Written communication is an effective channel when context, supporting data, and detailed explanations\nare necessary to inform or persuade others. One drawback to written communications is that they can be misunderstood or\nmisinterpreted by an audience that does not have subsequent opportunities to ask clarifying questions or otherwise respond.\nHere are some examples of different communication channels and their advantages:\nWeb-based communication, such as video conferencing, allows people in different locations to hold interactive meetings.\nEmails provide an instantaneous medium of written communication.\nReports document the activities of any department.\nPresentations usually involve audiovisual material, like copies of reports, or material prepared in Microsoft PowerPoint or Adobe Flash.\nTelephone meetings allow for long-distance interaction.\nMessage boards allow people to instantly post information to a centralized location.\nFace-to-face meetings are personal and should be succeeded by a written follow-up.\nQuality of Written and Oral Expression\nThe quality of written and oral communication depends on the effective use of language and communication channels.\nLearning Objectives\nDescribe the central importance and value in having high-quality written and oral communication abilities in a professional environment\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nThe quality of written and oral expression determines how effective communication will be in achieving its objectives.\nIn both written and oral communication, the use of language is the primary determinant of quality of expression.\nOral communication can also employ visual aids and nonverbal elements, such as body language, to convey meaning.\nKey Terms\neffective: Having the power to produce the required or desired effect.\nThe quality of written and oral expression determines how effective communication will be in achieving its objectives. Whether to inform,\nprovoke, or persuade, communication's primary purpose is to assign and convey meaning in order to create shared understanding. We\ncan assess the quality of expression by considering such factors as content and use of communication medium.\nIn both written and oral communication, the use of language is the primary determinant of quality of expression. This includes grammar,\nword choice and vocabulary, sentence structure, and organization. Another important factor is how well thought out the message is. A\ncommon adage states, \"Good writing is good thinking.\" In other words, it is difficult to express yourself well without first knowing what\nyou want to say. Communication that is easier for the audience to understand and follow is more likely to achieve its aim than is\nexpression that is confused, poorly organized, or vague.\nIn addition to word use, communicators can employ visual and nonverbal elements to convey meaning. Pictures, charts, or tables can\nprovide value when expressing complex ideas by synthesizing and focusing on the most important points. Body language, eye contact,\nand tone of voice can play significant roles in face-to-face communication, and may even have a greater impact on the listener than the\nwords actually spoken.\nThe communication medium is the channel through which information flows from sender to recipient. Channels include email, telephone,\nwritten reports, and oral presentations. One's skill level in using the chosen medium is an aspect of quality of expression. For instance,\nwithout training or experience using web conferencing it may be difficult to connect with the audience in ways that effectively convey\nmeaning and understanding.\nNonverbal Communication\nNonverbal elements supplement the use of words to convey meaning during communication.\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize the importance of the nonverbal factors involved in communication\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nNonverbal communication refers to meaning conveyed in the absence of words.\nVoluntary nonverbal communication refers to intentional movement, gestures, and poses.\nInvoluntary nonverbal communication gives cues about what one is really thinking or feeling.\nRegardless of what is said verbally, it is important to be aware of the nonverbal messages communicated through body language.\nKey Terms\nnonverbal: Not using words; of communication such as gestures, facial expressions, and body language.\nbody language: Nonverbal communication by means of facial expressions, eye behavior, gestures, posture, and the like; often thought to\nbe involuntary.\nNonverbal communication refers to meaning conveyed in the absence of words. Information conveyed nonverbally can be perceived\nthrough any of the five senses: sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. There are two types of nonverbal communication\u2014voluntary and\ninvoluntary.\nVoluntary Nonverbal Communication\nVoluntary nonverbal communication refers to intentional movements, gestures, and poses. These include smiling, hand movement, eye\ncontact, or imitation, and are generally intended to reinforce or clarify meaning being communicated verbally. These actions are made\nwillingly and usually with conscious awareness.\nNonverbal communication: A\npolice officer using nonverbal\ncommunication to indicate an\naction that needs to be performed.\nInvoluntary Nonverbal Communication\nInvoluntary nonverbal communication gives cues about what one is really thinking or feeling but may not be expressing in words.\nThere are many elements of involuntary body language that we use and experience commonly without being aware we are doing so. For\nexample, many people will raise their eyebrows as one approaches them face-to-face as an indication of recognition, esteem, or surprise.\nIf a person walking down the street encounters a stranger, then the chances are that neither person will raise their eyebrows. If they\nrecognize each other, however, even if they do not greet each other, then eyebrows will likely raise and lower. However, if a person is\nknown but not highly regarded by another person, the second person may not raise his or her eyebrows.\nInvoluntary nonverbal facial\nexpression: Facial expressions of\nsurprise, an involuntary nonverbal\nexpression.\nInvoluntary nonverbal communication can betray one's true beliefs, feelings, or motives. When angry or upset, often someone's body\nlanguage can communicate more intensity than their words alone. Similarly, when we perceive someone as being physically\nuncomfortable during a conversation, they are sending a message that may not be consistent with what they are saying.\nEffective communication relies on being aware of nonverbal aspects of interactions with others. It is equally important to be aware of\none's own nonverbal behaviors and be sensitive to how they may be perceived. For instance, maintaining eye contact when\ncommunicating indicates interest. Staring out the window or around the room is often perceived as boredom or disrespect. Another\nsimple nonverbal technique to facilitate good communication is the act of mirroring. Mirroring involves mimicking others' gestures and\nideas. This is especially helpful for making outsiders feel comfortable sharing ideas or for minimizing status differences.\nDifferences in Status\nSocial status can influence how an individual's communication is perceived.\nLearning Objectives\nDiscuss the potential communication barriers created by differences in status, rank or organizational hierarchy within an organization\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nSocial status refers to the relative rank or standing that an individual has in the eyes of others; it is shaped by one's background,\neducation, reputation, perceived power, and position in an organization 's hierarchy.\nAchieved status can include what an individual acquires during his or her lifetime as a result of accumulated knowledge, inherent ability,\nskill, and perseverance.\nCredibility and legitimacy can be gained by demonstrating competence, reliability, and identification with shared interests.\nKey Terms\nSocial Status: The honor or prestige attached to one's position in society.\nAmong the many organizational and individual factors that can influence the effectiveness of business communication, social status is one\nof the most challenging to address. Social status refers to the relative rank or standing that an individual has in the eyes of others. Position\nin the organization's hierarchy, background, education, reputation, and power all contribute to those perceptions of prestige.\nThere are two elements of social status\u2014those attributes we are born with and those we achieve. Ascribed status is determined at birth\nand includes characteristics such as sex, age, race, ethnic group, and family background. Achieved status is what an individual acquires as\na result of the exercise of knowledge, ability, talent, skill, and/or perseverance. Employment and occupation are primary factors in social\nstatus, and one's role in an organization is especially relevant within the boundaries of that organization.\nImplications of Social Status on Communication\nPeople often have difficulty navigating status differences when trying to inform or persuade others. To many, social status is an indicator\nof credibility and legitimacy, and this effects how seriously others take what one communicates. Key elements that are involved in an\naudience's evaluation include title, reputation, and the extent to which people can identify with the communicator's motives and\nobjectives. Status differences can create a bias against those with the perceived lower status. For example, a junior or lower-level\nemployee asked to make a presentation to a group of more senior upper-level managers may have difficulty keeping their attention at\nfirst even if his information and presentation skills are solid. Outsider status can also be a challenge in communication. This is commonly\nexperienced by salespeople, vendors, and even potential employees.\nRank affects communication: In the military and other\norganizations, the status of members affects communication.\nIn such situations, those with perceived lower status need to build good will by demonstrating competence and reliability and identifying\nwith common interests.\nNoise as a Barrier to Communication\nThe efficacy of communication is impacted by how much noise there is in the communication channel.\nLearning Objectives\nEvaluate the risk of distractions and noise reducing communication effectiveness\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nCommunication involves a sender transmitting a message to a recipient, who then decodes and interprets that message. This means there\nare multiple points in the communication process where misinterpretation and distraction are possible.\nThere are certain barriers to effective communication that every organization faces. These potential interruptions of the flow of\ninformation are referred to as \" noise \".\nCommunicative problems (i.e., noise) can be categorized into three groups: technical, semantic, or efficacy-related.\nExamples of noise include environmental noise, physiological-impairment noise, semantic noise, syntactical noise, organizational noise,\ncultural noise, and psychological noise.\nKey Terms\nsemantic: Related to meaning.\nnoise: Various sounds, usually unwanted.\nSyntactical: Related to the set of rules that govern how words are combined into meaningful phrases and sentences.\nThe Communicative Process\nMathematicians Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver defined communication as comprising the following five general components:\nAn information source (i.e., sender). This produces a message; in an oral conversation, the information source is simply the speaker.\nA transmitter. This encodes the message into signals.\nA channel. Signals are adapted to this channel for transmission.\nA receiver. This \"decodes\" (i.e., reconstructs) the message from the received signals.\nA destination. This is where the message arrives; in an oral conversation, the destination is simply the listener.\nShannon-Weaver model of communication: This diagram shows the\nfive steps of the communicative process identified by Shannon and\nWeaver.\nDistractions\u2014i.e., noise\u2014can disrupt the flow of information between any of these five stages. That is to say, issues in communication\npertaining to distraction could affect the sender, the message itself, the channel it is being sent through, or the recipient of that message.\nCommunicative Interference\nEvery organization faces certain barriers to communication. Shannon and Weaver argue there are three particular layers of\ncommunication problems:\nTechnical: How accurately can the message be transmitted?\nSemantic: How precisely can the meaning be conveyed?\nEfficacy-related: How effectively does the received meaning affect behavior?\nThese layers relate to a variety of types of noise that can interfere with communication.\nEnvironmental Noise\nEnvironmental noise is noise that physically disrupts communication, such as very loud speakers at a party or the sounds from a\nconstruction site next to a classroom.\nPhysiological-Impairment Noise\nPhysical conditions such as deafness or blindness can impede effective communication and interfere with messages being clearly and\naccurately received.\nSemantic Noise\nSemantic noise refers to when a speaker and a listener have different interpretations of the meanings of certain words. For example, the\nword \"weed\" can be interpreted as an undesirable plant in a yard or as a euphemism for marijuana.\nSyntactical Noise\nCommunication can be disrupted by mistakes in grammar, such as an abrupt change in verb tense during a sentence.\nOrganizational Noise\nPoorly structured messages can also be a barrier. For example, a receiver who is given unclear, badly worded directions may be unable to\nfigure out how to reach their destination.\nCultural Noise\nMaking stereotypical assumptions, such as unwittingly offending a non-Christian person by wishing them a \"Merry Christmas,\" can also\ndetract from communication. Because of this, it is important that each side of a conversation understands the culture of the other party.\nPsychological Noise\nCertain attitudes can also make communication difficult. For instance, significant anger or sadness may cause someone to lose focus on\nthe present moment.\nBy acknowledging and adjusting to noise, a communicator can make it more likely that their message will be received as intended.\nGender and Diversity\nDiversity, while an important part of a strong workforce, can contribute to misconceptions that may impede communication.\nLearning Objectives\nRecognize how diversity and gender may complicate communication in an organization\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nDifferences in gender, race, religion, cultural background, age, and sexual orientation can be barriers to effective communication.\nGender communication issues can strongly affect team interactions. Gender communication issues can range from differences in\ncommunication styles and perceptions to sexual harassment.\nCultural issues can affect team interactions through differences in communication conventions.\nIntercultural competence \u2014the ability to communicate effectively and appropriately with individuals of another culture \u2014requires\nregional expertise, empathy, and linguistic proficiency.\nAddressing gender and diversity from a communicative standpoint requires a high degree of empathy and understanding. A good\ncommunicator must be able to see things from the perspective of the intended recipient.\nKey Terms\nDiversity: The quality of being different.\nselective perception: The tendency to not notice and more quickly forget stimuli that cause emotional discomfort and contradict our\nprior beliefs.\nIntercultural Competence: The ability to communicate effectively and appropriately with people of other cultures.\nDiversity and Barriers\nBarriers to effective communication can distort a message and its intention, which may result in failure of the communication process or\ndamage to a relationship. These barriers include filtering, selective perception, information overload, emotions, language, silence,\ncommunication apprehension, gender differences, and political correctness.\nBy definition, diversity brings a wider range of views, and having a wide range of views is essential to an organization 's success. In\naddition, as teams are becoming increasingly global, diversity can help an organization or team understand its place in its surroundings.\nBut a diverse team environment can also cause challenges. Some individuals' views may challenge those of the larger team. Preconceived\nnotions about differences in other people\u2014such as racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, etc.\u2014disrupt work processes and can prevent\nteams from achieving their goals. Because of this, diverse teams must keep several important considerations in mind at all times to ensure\neffective communication.\nCommunicating in Diverse Teams\nThe main benefit of a diverse background is that it fosters a creative environment. The main pitfall is that differences between team\nmembers can lead to destructive conflict, most often due to communicative failures. As a result, companies must equip their employees\nwith the tools to prevent potential conflicts before they ever arise.\nThe most effective way to ensure proper communicative efficiency in diverse teams is to improve intercultural competence. Intercultural\ncompetence is simply the ability to communicate with different groups and cultures effectively and appropriately\u2014\"effectively\" meaning\nthat shared goals are being accomplished, and \"appropriately\" meaning doing so without violating the values, norms, relationships, or\nexpectations of others.\nIntercultural competence is a widely studied area of organizational communications and behavior. One model outlines the three following\ncomponents as being at the core of a culture-savvy individual: regional expertise, language proficiency, and cross-cultural competence.\nIntercultural competence: This figure underlines three useful perspectives\nto keep in mind when working with diverse teams. People should work to\nunderstand relevant languages, regions, and cultural predispositions to\navoid communicative misinterpretations.\nOther Issues in Diversity\nOf course, intercultural considerations are only some of the issues that arise in diverse teams. Further differences such as sexual\norientation, gender, political views, age, and special needs are also highly relevant and are critical to consider for communicative success.\nThe greatest takeaway here should be the power of empathy. The ability to recognize someone else's perspective (and therefore how they\nmay interpret what you say) is absolutely central to avoiding issues in communication between different groups. In any communicative\nsetting, whether you are speaking or writing or listening or reading, keep in mind the possible interpretations of individuals whose\nperspectives and predispositions may differ from yours.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
