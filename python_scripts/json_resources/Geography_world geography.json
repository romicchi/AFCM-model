If a geographer is trying to understand why people\nsettled in a given area, they might look back at historical data\nabout when people came to a region in an attempt to understand\nwhy. They might also look at primary source documents - first\nhand accounts from people who lived during the time to get a\nsense of why people came there. If movement to this region was\nrecent, they might even interview living people to get clues.\nWhat has been outlined in this section is by no means a full list\nthat shows you every tool a geographer can use. It focused on\nsome of the most common ones, and you\u2019ll et practice with these\nand many more throughout the book.\n20 Section 4\nWhat is Geographic Inquiry?\nQUESTIONS TO GUIDE INQUIRY So far you have learned about what geography is, why you are going study it, and\nwhat tools geographers use. One of the most important things to remember is\n1. What is geography?\nthat just like people in every field, geographers ask questions. Geographers go\n2. Why do we study geography?\nthrough an inquiry process every time they ask themselves a question on\n3. What tools do geographers use?\nsomething that interests us, whether we are aware of it or not. The first step is\nasking the right question. From there, you go out and find the right information.\n4. What is geographic inquiry?\nYou evaluate, sometimes without knowing it,\n5. Why do we need to\nwhether the information is \u201cgood\u201d or not, before\nthink globally?\nfinally coming up with your conclusion. These\nare all steps in a good inquiry process.\nGeographic inquiry is no different. For the\npurposes of this book the following process will\nbe used:\n21 Ask a geographic question also use a map that is more zoomed in so you can see more\nspecifically how streets connect a parking lot to the concert site.\nTo begin any inquiry, you need to have a question in mind. If you\nAll of this information helps you as you begin the next stage of\nare having a hard time beating a boss in a video game, you might\ngeographic inquiry.\nask \u201cHow do I get past the level 12 boss?\u201d This is certainly a\nquestion you can research, but it probably is not a question a\ngeographer would use. Geographers are going to ask questions\nabout where things happen, what happened, and why it\nhappened. Two geographers headed to a rock concert (music,\nnot stones) might wonder why it costs $15 an hour to park their\ncar in the lot right next to the venue, the place where the concert\nhappens. This is one of those times where economics also\ncomes into play. If they drove several streets over, there might be\ncheaper parking lots. In this case, they may think the answer to\nthis question is \u201cconvenience.\u201d The closer you are to your\ndestination, the more expensive it is to park there. To be certain\nhowever, they are going to have to do a few more things.\nAcquire Geographic Information\nOrganize Geographic Information\nThe second step once you have your question is to go out and\nThe date of the concert is approaching and the geographers\u2019\ngather some information.

What\u2019s worth moving to and from?\n4. What factors push or pull people?\nPeople move. You\u2019ve already learned about push\/pull factors. Sometimes people\nand families move because of jobs and opportunities elsewhere. This kind of\nmovement could be across a town, a state, a region, a country, or in between\ncountries.\nMovement of people can take place in a variety of ways. You\u2019ve already read a\nlittle bit about historical methods of bringing people from place to place. Early\nmigrations took place on foot. European migrations began on ships. Today\npeople move in many ways. They can still travel on foot and on ship, though cars,\nbusses, trains, and planes have all made the speed at which people can travel\nmuch faster.\n36 Take a moment to look at the map below.\nLet\u2019s pretend you live at\npoint 1 on the map and\nyou and your family are\nmoving to point 2.\nBased just off of this\nmap, trace your finger\nover the route you might\ntake to get there.\nDo you draw a direct\nline connecting the two\npoints?

Mestizos are people with a mix of both indigenous and European ancestry.\nToday, mestizos make up a large portion of the population of South America.\nAnother factor influencing the cultural landscape of South America was the\nimportation of enslaved Africans. Most of these Africans were brought to Brazil,\nand it is their cultural practices, mixed with native and European beliefs that\ncreated a unique cultural landscape that can be seen in cultural traits such as\nmusic, dance and foods. Religion remains the backbone of many South American\ncultures. While Catholicism, the official religion of both Spain and Portugal at the\ntime of colonization, dominates the continent, there are other spiritual beliefs that\nhave had an influence on other social activities.\nThe Day of the Dead Festival, or Dia de los Muertos, is a Mexican festival\ncelebrating the reunion of dead relatives with their families. This festival occurs\neach year on November 1st (All Saints Day) and 2nd (All Souls Day). The origins of\nthe festival come from the ancient native peoples who believed that the souls of\n64 the dead return each year to visit with their living relatives, and\nto eat, drink and be merry. With the arrival of the Spanish,\ncertain Christian beliefs were brought into the festival. Today\u2019s\npractice calls for all of the deceased children to be remembered\non November 1st, All Saints Day with toys and colorful balloons\nadorning their graves. The next day, All Souls Day, adults who\nhave died are honored with displays of their favorite food and\ndrinks, as well as ornaments and personal belongings. Flowers\nand candles are placed on the graves and are supposed to\nguide the spirits home to their loved ones. Other parts of the\ncelebration today include; the pan de muerto (a coffee cake\ndecorated with candy bones), skull-shaped candies, paper\nmache\u2019 skeletons and skulls. Today, these symbols and other\nitems fill shops and candy counters in October. During this time,\nhomes are often decorated in the same manner as the graves.

The gaucho culture still exists today, especially in Argentina\nand Uruguay.\n65 As the growth of industries, railroads and the expansion of trade\nbegan to bring new wealth to the upper classes, a new middle\nclass began to form in the newly developing cities. But a vast\nmajority of Latin Americans, especially those living in the rural\nareas, saw little to no progress being made in the condition of\ntheir lives. The gap between the rich and the poor grew and led to\nunrest among farmers and workers. By this time, many of the\nnations of Latin America were controlled by military dictators, and\nit was these governments that resisted demands for reform. In\nmany cases, the military was used to put down these uprisings.\nThis trend continued well into the next century.\nIn 1959, a revolution in Cuba was led by Fidel Castro.

Parts of the city sank below what\nremained of Lake Texcoco. This caused a serious threat to the\ncity as it posed a flood risk during the rainy season. The course of\naction to prevent this was to sink wells into Lake Texcoco itself\nand remove enough water from the aquifer that fed it to make the\nlevel of the lake itself drop below the level of the city once again.\nLake Texcoco has been drained in one way or another since the\n1600\u2019s. It now occupies only a small area surrounded by salt\nmarshes just east of Mexico City. With the depletion of the\nground-water, the land that the city is built on has become\nrelatively unstable. Large fissures, or cracks, will open up from\ntime to time. This, along with the fact that much of Mexico City\ntoday is built on top of the original Lake Texcoco lake bed, means\nthat the cities buildings are at a constant risk. As the area is prone\nto earthquakes, the ground is not very solid and stable. The\ninstability magnifies the ground shaking effect of the earthquakes\ncausing greater damage than may have otherwise occurred.\n69 Central America - Building the Francisco by nearly 8,000 miles, and allow ships to avoid the\nInteractive 3.17 Panama\nPanama Canal dangerous conditions around Cape Horn.\nPrior to 1914, a trip from New York The next question became where to construct this new canal.\nto San Francisco required one to France began work on a canal in Panama in the 1870s.

This policy of racial\nsegregation forced whites and nonwhites to live apart from each other. It offered\nfew economic resources and less political power to the nonwhite ethnic groups.\nSouth Africa was a multiracial society made up of many different ethnic groups.\nMost ethnic groups fit into four classifications blacks, whites, colored and Asian.\nApartheid then separated all these into white and nonwhite.\n107 How did South Africa become a multiracial society?

How does the population of a place impact\nfor all countries, and will continue to be so over the coming decades.\nhow and where you live?\nWith this in mind, how has population growth impacted South Asia? To answer\nthis question, first take a look at the two\nmaps on this page.\nThese maps show the population density of\ntwo areas - Iowa and Bangladesh.

The first is that the United States\nis much larger than Bangladesh. You probably noticed that by\nusing the mathematical formula provided, the United State\u2019s\npopulation density is much lower than that of Bangladesh. The\nsecond thing to note about this activity is that people cannot live\neverywhere in the United States. High mountains, large deserts,\nextreme temperatures and other natural barriers to settlement\nexist. Because of this, when studying population it is also\nnecessary to study the population distribution of an area.\nThe average population density for the planet overall is around 48\npeople for every squared kilometer. You can arrive at this average\nfor the planet overall by using the same formula you used to\ncalculate Iowa and the United States. The problem becomes,\nwhen studying the world overall, that the formula assumes that\nthose people are evenly spaced out around the planet, when in\nfact, they are not.\nTake a look at the Population Density map of Bangladesh once\nagain.

This\nmakes several other population related issues big problems for\nthe citizens there. Many people there have an inadequate diet\nand suffer from food shortages. This problem is worse in\nchildren. Almost two-thirds of the child population under five are\nconsidered under-nourished.\nBecause the population is impoverished, there is a shortage of\naffordable housing in the region. This has lead to a rise in slums\nwhere many people end up having to live due to the lack of other\nchoices.\nThe air quality in the region, due partially to industrial and vehicle\npollution has become a major concern for the people living in\nBangladesh. This has led to increased risks of being born with or\ndeveloping asthma, and led to other respiratory and neurological\nproblems.

You have already learned that it is sometimes\ndifficult to classify a region as a region. All classifications are labels which mean\n1.

How do the five themes of geography help\ngeographers study the world?\nIt is even more difficult to classify Asia as a region on its own due to the physical\nand human diversity of the region. Russia is part of Northern Asia, but the sheer\nsize of that country also places it in Eastern Europe. India is part of Southern Asia.\nThat region can be partially categorized by the mountain ranges that run through\nit.\nThe Asian continent cannot be easily labeled by climate, or physical\ncharacteristics. It contains both the highest and lowest points in the world.\nDepending on the location, the land could range from rugged and inhospitable to\nfertile and suitable for farming.\n203 It is also difficult to label the region based on human\ncharacteristics. The region contains multiple forms of\ngovernment, multiple religious practices, and many distinctly\ndifferent cultural characteristics. Over time many of these have\nblended (particularly religion and certain cultural characteristics\nwhich you\u2019ll learn more about in a later section) but the people\nliving in Asia are all distinctly different from one another.\nImage source: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boundaries_between_continents#\/media\/\nFile:Europe_Asia_transcontinental.png\nIt is generally considered that there is an imaginary border\nbetween Europe and Asia which separates one continent into\nImage source: https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/08\/Eurasian_mass.jpg\ntwo.

The people living in Eastern Asia are no different.\nIn this section you will learn about how people live in the Gobi Desert regions of\nChina and Mongolia. You will also learn about the Three Gorges Dam and some of\nthe environmental risks and benefits that this massive project has created.\n206 The Gobi Desert - From Deforestation to Reforestation Every year the Gobi Desert expands, and this expansion\nthreatens farmland in China and Mongolia. This has far-reaching\neffects far beyond these two countries. The main cause of this\nproblem is similar to problems found in other large desert regions\nin the world, including the Sahara. Overgrazing, deforestation,\nand farming practices all contribute to the spread of this desert.\nThe problem doesn\u2019t just affect China. The spread of the Gobi\nDesert and the deforestation of the country has led to what is\nknown as \u201cYellow Dust Storms\u201d as far away as the Korean\nPeninsula.
