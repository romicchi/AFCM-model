Tylor (Primitive Culture, 1871):\nCulture \u201cis that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom,\nand any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\u201d\nBook on Archive.org (Tylor, 1871)\n1.1.1 What Does It Entail?\n\u2022 \u201cCulture\u201d encompasses objects and symbols, the meaning given to those objects and\nsymbols, and the norms, values, and beliefs that pervade social life.\n\u2022 Values reflect an individual\u2019s or society\u2019s sense of right and wrong or what \u201cought\u201d to be.\n\u2022 Humans also have biological drives\u2014hunger, thirst, need for sleep\u2014whose unfulfillment\ncan result in death.\n\u2022 Because of our biology and genetics, we have a particular form and we have certain\nabilities. These set essential limits on the variety of activities that humans can express\nculture, but there is still enormous diversity in this expression.\n1 2 \u2022 PART 1\n\u2022 Culture refers to the way we understand ourselves as individuals and as members of\nsociety, including stories, religion, media, rituals, and even language itself.\n\u2022 Social Darwinism was the belief that the closer a cultural group was to the normative\nWestern European standards of behavior and appearance, the more evolved they were.\n\u2022 Culture is the non-biological or social aspects of human life.\n\u2022 Culture refers to the way we understand ourselves as individuals and as members of\nsociety, including stories, religion, media, rituals, and even language itself.\n\u2022 Social Darwinism hinged on the belief that the closer cultural groups were to the normative\nWestern European standards of behavior and appearance, the more evolved they were.\nLanguage is a defining aspect of culture. Our beliefs about language\u2014as in, the language we\nspeak, not language in general\u2014both define and reflect our beliefs about our identity as part of a\ngroup. The way we speak reflects and reinforces our cultural beliefs, and our identity as members\nof a social group. To make this a little bit less abstract, let\u2019s look into three new terms: linguistic\ncommunity, speech community, and language ideologies.\n1.1.1 Adapted from Cultural Universals (LibreTexts, 2019)\n1.2 Fundamental Properties of Language\nFirst, watch this brief 8-minute introduction to language and the field of linguistics.\nWatch the video: Fundamental Properties of Language (Catherine Anderson, 2018)\nThis video is supplemental to Catherine Anderson\u2019s work, Essentials of Linguistics.\nVideo transcript:\nBecause everybody speaks a language, just about everybody has opinions about language .\nBut there are lots of things that are commonly believed about language that just aren\u2019t\ntrue . You might have heard someone say that a given language has no grammar . I\u2019ve heard\npeople try to argue that Chinese has no grammar, that English has no grammar, that the\nlanguages spoken by Canada\u2019s indigenous peoples have no grammar, or that Swiss German\nhas no grammar . When people say this they might mean a few different things . Sometimes\nthey just mean that there\u2019s not much variation in the forms of words and that\u2019s true of\nChinese but then the grammar of Chinese has lots of complexity in its sound system .\nSometimes people who argue that a language has no grammar are actually trying to claim\nthat that language is inferior in some way . The truth is that all languages have grammar . All LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 3\nlanguages have a sound system . A system for forming words, a way of organizing words into\nsentences, a systematic way of assigning meanings . Even languages that don\u2019t have writing\nsystems or dictionaries or published books of rules still have speakers who understand each\nother . That means they have a shared system\u2014a shared mental grammar .\nWhen we\u2019re investigating mental grammar, it doesn\u2019t matter whether a language has a\nprestigious literature, or is spoken by powerful people . Using linguists\u2019 techniques for making\nscientific observations about language, we can study the phonetics, phonology, morphology,\nsyntax, and semantics of any language .\nAnother opinion that you might have heard about language is that some languages are\nbetter than others . Maybe you\u2019ve heard someone say, \u201cI don\u2019t speak real Italian, just a\ndialect\u201d\u2014implying that their dialect is not as good as so called \u201creal Italian .\u201d Or maybe you\u2019ve\nheard someone say that Quebec French is just sloppy\u2014it\u2019s not as good as the French they\nspeak in France . Or maybe you\u2019ve heard someone say that nobody in Newfoundland can\nspeak proper English or nobody in Texas speaks proper English or maybe even nobody in\nNorth America speaks proper English, and the only good English is the Queen\u2019s English that\nthey speak in England .\nThe truth is that all languages are equally valid . Just as we said that all languages have\ngrammar, it\u2019s also the case that there\u2019s no way to say that one grammar is better or worse\nthan another grammar . Remember that linguistics takes a scientific approach to language and\nscientists don\u2019t rate or rank the things they study . Ichthyologists don\u2019t rank fish to say which\nspecies is more correct at being a fish, astronomers don\u2019t argue over which galaxy is more\nposh . In the same way, linguists don\u2019t assign value to any language or variety or dialect .\nIt is the case though that plenty of people do attribute value to particular dialects or\nvarieties and sociolinguistic research tells us that there can be negative or positive social\nconsequences for people who speak certain varieties . When people say that British English is\nbetter than American English, for example, they\u2019re making a social judgment based on politics,\nhistory, economics, or snobbery, but there\u2019s no linguistic basis for making that value judgment .\nOne of the common misconceptions about language arose when scholars first started\ndoing linguistics . At first they focused on the languages that they knew, which were mostly\nthe languages that were spoken in Europe . The grammars of those languages had a lot in\ncommon because they all evolved from a common ancestor, which we now call Proto-Indo-\nEuropean . When linguists started learning about the languages spoken in other parts of the\nworld, they thought at first that these languages were so unfamiliar, so unusual, so weird\nthat the scholars speculated that those languages had nothing at all in common with the\nlanguages of Europe . Linguists have now studied enough languages to know that, in spite\nof the many differences between languages, there are some universal properties that are\ncommon to all human languages . 4 \u2022 PART 1\nThe field of Linguistic Typology studies the properties that languages have in common\neven across languages that they aren\u2019t related to . Some of these universal properties\nare at the level of phonology . For example, all languages have consonants and vowels .\nSome of these universals are at the level of morphology and syntax . All languages make a\ndistinction between nouns and verbs, and in nearly all languages the subject of a sentence\ncomes before the verb and before the object of the sentence . We\u2019ll discover more of these\nuniversals as we proceed through the chapters .\nA very common belief that people have about language is something you might have heard\nfrom your grandparents or your teachers . Have you heard them say, \u201cKids these days are\nruining English; they should learn to speak properly\u201d? Or, if you grew up speaking Mandarin\nmaybe you heard the same thing, \u201cThose teenagers are ruining Mandarin; they should\nlearn to speak properly .\u201d For as long as there has been language there have been people\ncomplaining that young people are ruining it and trying to force them to speak in a more\nold-fashioned way . Some countries, like France and Germany, even have official institutes\nthat make prescriptive rules about what words and sentence structures are allowed in the\nlanguage and which ones aren\u2019t allowed .\nThe truth is that every language changes over time . Languages are spoken by humans, and\nas humans grow and change and as our society changes, our language changes along with it .\nSome language change is as simple as in the vocabulary of a language . We need to introduce\nnew words to talk about new concepts and new inventions . For example, the verb Google didn\u2019t\nexist when I was an undergraduate student, and now googling is something I do every day .\nLanguage also changes in the way we pronounce things and in the way we use words and\nform sentences . In a later chapter, we\u2019ll talk about some of the things that are changing in\nCanadian English .\nAnother common belief about language is the idea that you can\u2019t learn a language unless\nsomeone teaches you the rules\u2014either in a language class or with a textbook or a software\npackage . This might be partially true for learning a language as an adult . It might be hard to\ndo it on your own without a teacher, but think about yourself as a kid . Whatever language\nyou grew up speaking, whether it\u2019s English, or French, or Mandarin, or Arabic, or Tamil,\nor Serbian, you didn\u2019t have to wait until kindergarten to start speaking, you learned the\nlanguage from infancy by interacting with the people around you who spoke that language .\nSome of those people around you might have taught you particular words for things, but\nthey probably weren\u2019t teaching you, \u201cmake the \/f\/ sound by putting your top teeth on your\nbottom lip\u201d or \u201cmake sure you put the subject of the sentence before the verb,\u201d and by the\ntime you started school you were perfectly fluent in your language . In some parts of the\nworld people never go to school and never have any formal instruction, but they still speak\ntheir languages fluently . LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 5\nThat\u2019s because almost everything we know about our language\u2014our mental grammar\u2014is\nunconscious knowledge that\u2019s acquired implicitly as children . Much of your knowledge\nof your mental grammar is not accessible to your conscious awareness . This is kind of a\nstrange idea; how can you know something if you\u2019re not conscious of knowing it? Many\nthings that we know are indeed conscious knowledge . For example, if I asked you, you\ncould explain to me how to get to your house, or what the capital of Canada is, or what the\ndifference is between a cow and a horse . But our mind also has lots of knowledge that\u2019s\nnot fully conscious . You probably can\u2019t explain very clearly how to control your muscles to\nclimb stairs, or how to recognize the face of someone you know, or how to form complex\nsentences in your native language, and yet you can do all of these things easily and fluently\nand unconsciously . A lot of our job when we study linguistics is to make explicit the things\nthat you already know implicitly . This is exactly what makes linguistics challenging at first, but\nit\u2019s also what makes it fun .\nNext, watch this 5-minute video about grammar from TED-Ed.\nWatch the video: Does Grammar Matter? (Andreea S. Calude, 2016)\nVideo transcript:\nYou\u2019re telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part when suddenly he\ninterrupts . \u201cThe alien and I,\u201d not \u201cMe and the alien .\u201d Most of us would probably be annoyed,\nbut aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence\nactually grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it, why does it even matter?\nFrom the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns for how words are put\ntogether to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing . Different languages have\ndifferent patterns . In English, the subject normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then\nthe object, while in Japanese and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb .\nSome scholars have tried to identify patterns common to all languages, but apart from some\nbasic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called linguistic universals have\nbeen found . And while any language needs consistent patterns to function, the study of\nthese patterns opens up an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism\nand descriptivism . Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language should follow\nconsistent rules, while descriptivists see variation and adaptation as a natural and necessary\npart of language .\nFor much of history, the vast majority of language was spoken . But as people became more\ninterconnected and writing gained importance, written language was standardized to allow 6 \u2022 PART 1\nbroader communication and ensure that people in different parts of a realm could understand\neach other . In many languages, this standard form came to be considered the only proper\none, despite being derived from just one of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people\nin power . Language purists worked to establish and propagate this standard by detailing\na set of rules that reflected the established grammar of their times . And rules for written\ngrammar were applied to spoken language, as well . Speech patterns that deviated from the\nwritten rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people\nwho had grown up speaking in these ways were forced to adopt the standardized form .\nMore recently, however, linguists have understood that speech is a separate phenomenon\nfrom writing with its own regularities and patterns . Most of us learn to speak at such an early\nage that we don\u2019t even remember it . We form our spoken repertoire through unconscious\nhabits, not memorized rules . And because speech also uses mood and intonation for\nmeaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers and listeners .\nThis could mean avoiding complex clauses that are hard to parse in real time, making\nchanges to avoid awkward pronunciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster .\nThe linguistic approach that tries to understand and map such differences without dictating\ncorrect ones is known as descriptivism . Rather than deciding how language should be used,\nit describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations they come up with in the\nprocess .\nBut while the debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism continues, the two are\nnot mutually exclusive . At its best, prescriptivism is useful for informing people about the\nmost common established patterns at a given point in time . This is important, not only for\nformal contexts, but it also makes communication easier between non-native speakers from\ndifferent backgrounds . Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds\nwork and the instinctive ways in which we structure our view of the world .\nUltimately, grammar is best thought of as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being\nnegotiated and reinvented by the entire group of language users . Like language itself, it\u2019s\na wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions of speakers and listeners,\nwriters and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far .\n1.2.1 Linguistic Community\n\u201ca group of people who share a single language variety and the rules for using it in\neveryday communication, and who focus their identity around that language\u201d\n(Ottenheimer and Pine, The Anthropology of Language, 2018)\nA linguistic community is therefore united by more than just a language; there is also a sense of\nidentity\u2014typically that of a national identity, but not only. For example, Spanish speakers do not LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 7\nconstitute a linguistic community. Rather, Spanish speakers from Spain, as opposed to Mexican\nSpanish speakers, are distinct linguistic communities.\n1.2.2 Speech Communities\n\u201cA speech community is a group of people who share a set of linguistic norms and expectations\nregarding the use of language. It is a concept mostly associated with sociolinguistics and\nanthropological linguistics.\nExactly how to define speech community is debated in the literature. Definitions of speech\ncommunity tend to involve varying degrees of emphasis on the following:\n\u2022 Shared community membership\n\u2022 Shared linguistic communication\nA typical speech community can be a small town, but sociolinguists such as William Labov claim\nthat a large metropolitan area, for example New York City, can also be considered one single\nspeech community.\nEarly definitions have tended to see speech communities as bounded and localized groups of\npeople who live together and come to share the same linguistic norms because they belong to\nthe same local community. It has also been assumed that within a community a homogeneous\nset of norms should exist. These assumptions have been challenged by later scholarship\nthat has demonstrated that individuals generally participate in various speech communities\nsimultaneously and at different times in their lives. Each speech community has different norms\nthat they tend to share only partially. Communities may be de-localized and unbounded rather\nthan local, and they often comprise different sub-communities with differing speech norms.\nWith the recognition of the fact that speakers actively use language to construct and manipulate\nsocial identities by signaling membership in particular speech communities, the idea of the\nbounded speech community with homogeneous speech norms has become largely abandoned\nfor a model based on the speech community as a fluid community of practice.\nA speech community comes to share a specific set of norms for language use through living\nand interacting together, and speech communities may therefore emerge among all groups\nthat interact frequently and share certain norms and ideologies. Such groups can be villages,\ncountries, political or professional communities, communities with shared interests, hobbies, or\nlifestyles, or even just groups of friends. Speech communities may share both particular sets of\nvocabulary and grammatical conventions, as well as speech styles and genres, and also norms for\nhow and when to speak in particular ways.\u201d\n1.2.2 Adapted from \u201cSpeech Community\u201d (Wikipedia contributors, 2019) 8 \u2022 PART 1\n1.2.3 Language Ideology\nLanguage ideology is a marker of struggles between social groups with different interests,\nrevealed in what people say and how they say it. It is primarily studied in the field of linguistic\nanthropology. The study of language ideology allows evidence that the way we talk will always\nbe embedded in a social world of power differences. They mark the struggles between social\ngroups that do not contain the same interests or beliefs. This is revealed in what people say\nand how they say it. Language ideologies are very active and effective. We can tell this by the\nway people monitor their speech to make sure it is appropriate with a particular language\nideology. Language ideologies are very important to many fields of study; some examples are\nanthropology, sociology, and linguistics. Language ideology has become a very good way for us\nto understand how human groups are organized, despite differences in beliefs and ways of life.\nFor example, many different languages are spoken within one society, proving that the theory\nof linguistics regarding human societies as monolingual would be of very limited help. Instead\nof using language ideology we see speakers of different languages or dialects may possibly share\ncertain beliefs or practice, or even a conflict involving a language.\nAn ethnographic example of this is the language of African Americans. After studying the\nlanguage ideology, research revealed that perhaps the key element of their language is the\nimportance of indirectness. The reason that indirectness was vital for the African Americans was\nbecause they were living under the conditions of slavery and legal segregation for a majority of\nAmerica\u2019s history. Living under the conditions of this extreme inequality, African Americans had\nto follow a set of unwritten political rules, telling them how they were supposed to communicate\nwith whites. For example, only speaking when you are given permission to speak, or without\ncontradicting or arguing over what whites said to them. Having to follow these rules publicly\nconfirmed the status of African Americans in the racial hierarchy. African Americans spoke\ndifferently to each other and when not in the presence of whites than they did while they were\nin the presence of whites. This shows how they change their language based on the audience\naround them; they are monitoring their speech to make it appropriate to whoever they are\ntalking to. \u201cThe most highly valued instances of this counter-language were ambiguous speech\nperformances that were usually puzzling or unintelligible to outsiders but easily understood by\nthe African Americans who were present.\u201d\n1.2.3 Adapted from Cultural Anthropology (Wikibooks contributors, 2018) LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 9\n1.3 Icebergs of Culture\n1.3.1 Military Culture Iceberg\nWatch the video: Military Culture Iceberg (Center For Deployment Psychology, 2014)\nVideo transcript:\nAbove the waterline are aspects of a culture that are explicit, visible, and easily taught . The\nsurface culture is where behaviors, customs and courtesies, and traditions are more easily\nseen . For the military culture this area includes things such as: the uniform and rank, the\nsalute, the playing of the national anthem before commanders calls and movies, the POWs\nceremony, the honoring of heroes, and the change-of-command ceremony .\nAt the water line is a transition zone where the observer has to be more alert in the area where\nimplicit understanding becomes talked about and where ethos is codified and decreed . At this\nlevel of military culture are found the service creed, the core values, and the oath of office .\nSome of what identifies service members and veterans as belonging to the military culture\nare not readily apparent and exist below the waterline . Below the surface is the hidden\nculture\u2014the more enduring and powerful characteristics of military culture: the beliefs,\nhabits, values, assumptions, understandings, and judgments that affect the culture\u2019s\nworldview . These intangible values and guiding ideals that are mostly acquired while in\nuniform and are often kept for life are referred to as the Military or Warrior Ethos . These are\noften things a member knows but cannot easily articulate . The hidden aspects of a culture\nare not taught directly .\n1.3.2 Iceberg Assignment\nUsing the example of the iceberg of military culture, design your own iceberg for a culture\nof your choice. Be aware that it doesn\u2019t have to be an international culture; you can pick a\nsubculture or a minority culture within the U.S. or within the country\/nation you are most\nfamiliar with.\nThis may not be that easy to do. You will have to take a step back and think critically about things\nyou never think about, because you are living them everyday; they\u2019re your second nature. Culture\noften feels like nature (to borrow the words of Guy Deutscher): it feels like common sense, and\nwe usually only become aware of it when we experience a culture shock, i.e., when we encounter\npeople who don\u2019t act, or think, or believe, the same way that we do. Usually, our response to\nsuch encounters (especially when they happen within our own culture) is that of irritation or 10 \u2022 PART 1\nsurprise. We get frustrated with people. (Who on earth takes off their shoes before walking inside\nmy home? Socks and bare feet are disgusting! . . . Who says \u201cover yonder\u201d? What does that even\nmean? . . . Why is this guy avoiding my gaze? That\u2019s kind of shady.\u201d) The root of such irritation or\nflabbergasted-ness is often to be found below the waterline, in the invisible culture.\nYou need to be very familiar with the culture you design an iceberg for, so pick a culture you are\npart of or intimately familiar with for this assignment.\n1.4 Linguistic Relativity\nOne of the most important ideas in the course, and that will orient all of our inquiries, is that\nlanguage and worldviews mutually influence each other. We will get more in-depth into the\nlarger academic context that made the birth of such a notion possible in Module #3. For now,\nlet\u2019s get familiar with the theory itself.\nIn this context, we will assume that worldview refers to the perspective on the world of an\nindividual in a given culture. You can think of a worldview as the lens (as in the \u201cglasses\u201d)\nthat filters the way individuals in a given culture see the world, colored by the culture those\nindividuals belong to (the \u201clens\u201d metaphor is not mine, but that of Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher).\n1.5 Culture, Human Language, and Three Ways\nto Approach Language Study\nAt the beginning of the chapter, Tylor\u2019s 19th-century definition of culture was shared.\nCulture \u201cis that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, law, morals, custom,\nand any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\u201d\n(from Primitive Culture, 1871)\nBook on Archive.org (Tylor, 1871)\nHowever, over time, anthropologists have taken to refining Tylor\u2019s definition of culture, viewed\nas problematic for different reasons.\n\u2022 First, it approaches culture as a list of characteristics, which might end up being too\nspecific and exclusive, because potentially not applicable to all cultures. The more\nspecifics, the more exclusive, when what anthropologists are interested in is finding a\nworking definition of culture to be used as a universal framework to analyze and interpret\nall cultures. In other words, that definition needs to (inductively) include the universals of\ncultures (what structures do all individual cultures have in common?) in order to define\nculture (in the singular). LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 11\n\u2022 Second, Tylor\u2019s definition reflects an understanding of culture and civilization as\ncharacteristics that a group of people acquire as they become more civilized. This\nunderstanding is in keeping with the beliefs of the time. The \u201cacquired\u201d in the definition\n(\u201ccapabilities and habits acquired\u201d) hints at both the fact that culture is not, well, nature\u2014\ni.e., it is not innate\u2014but also that it is something that one has, like a type of capital (there\nare the haves and the have-nots). The process of acquiring culture is part of progress\ntowards civilization, according to that view. This view of culture is linear, with less and\nmore advanced stages of culture and civilization.\nTylor, echoing the French idea of civilization progressing from a barbaric state to \u201cscience,\nsecularism, and rational thought\u201d (Beldo 2010), believed that all human culture passed through\nstages of development with the pinnacle being that of 19th century England. He believed, as\nmany others of this time period did, that all other cultures were inherently inferior. Franz Boas, a\nGerman American anthropologist, challenged Tylor\u2019s approach. He drew on the German concept\nof kultur, local and personal behaviors and traditions, to develop his ideas about culture. Boas\nthought that cultures did not follow a linear progression as espoused by cultural evolutionists\nlike Tylor, but developed in different directions based on historical events. Boas took years to\ndevelop a working definition of culture, but it is one that influences anthropologists to this day:\nculture is an integrated system of symbols, ideas and values that should be studied as a working\nsystem, an organic whole (Kuper 1999:56).\nA general definition of culture that can be applied to all cultures is patterns of behavior that\nare common within a particular population of people. One way to think about culture is to\nbreak down the concept into two distinct categories: the Big C and the little c. The Big C is an\noverarching general concept that can be applied to all culture groups; it is the anthropological\nperspective. The little c is the particulars of a specific culture group.\nIt is easiest to think of the Big C as elements that comprise culture (not a specific group).\nBig C Culture is:\n\u2022 An integrated system of mental elements (beliefs, values, worldview, attitudes, norms), the\nbehaviors motivated by those mental elements, and the material items created by those\nbehaviors;\n\u2022 A system shared by the members of the society;\n\u2022 100 percent learned, not innate;\n\u2022 Based on symbolic systems, the most important of which is language;\n\u2022 Humankind\u2019s most important adaptive mechanism; and\n\u2022 Dynamic, constantly changing. 12 \u2022 PART 1\nLittle c, as mentioned above, is the particulars of any given culture group, for instance, the\nmarriage or subsistence pattern of a group of people. Traditions, a concept many people associate\nwith culture, would fall into the little c.\nIn this course, while we need to understand the current working definition of Culture, we will\nlook into the little c of culture, to see how it intersects and shapes\/is shaped by language.\n1.5 Adapted from Cultural Anthropology (Wikibooks contributors, 2018)\nAdapted from Perspectives, Language (Linda Light, 2017)\n1.6 Human Language Compared with the\nCommunication Systems of Other Species\nHuman language is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the communication systems\nof all other species of animals. Linguists have long tried to create a working definition that\ndistinguishes it from non-human communication systems. Linguist Charles Hockett\u2019s solution\nwas to create a hierarchical list of what he called design features, or descriptive characteristics,\nof the communication systems of all species, including that of humans. Those features of human\nlanguage not shared with any other species illustrate exactly how it differs from all other species.\n1.6.1 Hockett\u2019s Design Features\nThe communication systems of all species share the following features:\n1. A mode of communication by which messages are transmitted through a system of\nsigns, using one or more sensory systems to transmit and interpret, such as vocal-\nauditory, visual, tactile, or kinesic;\n2. Semanticity: the signs carry meaning for the users, and\n3. Pragmatic function: all signs serve a useful purpose in the life of the users, from\nsurvival functions to influencing others\u2019 behavior.\n(We will skip features 4 to 6!)\nOnly true human language also has the following characteristics:\n7. Discreteness: every human language is made up of a small number of meaningless\ndiscrete sounds. That is, the sounds can be isolated from each other, for purposes of\nstudy by linguists, or to be represented in a writing system.\n8. Duality of patterning (two levels of combination): at the first level of patterning,\nthese meaningless discrete sounds, called phonemes, are combined to form words and LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \u2022 13\nparts of words that carry meaning, or morphemes. In the second level of patterning,\nmorphemes are recombined to form an infinite possible number of longer messages\nsuch as phrases and sentences according to a set of rules called syntax. It is this level of\ncombination that is entirely lacking in the communication abilities of all other animals\nand makes human language an open system while all other animal systems are closed.\n9. Displacement: the ability to communicate about things that are outside of the here and now\nmade possible by the features of discreteness and duality of patterning. While other species\nare limited to communicating about their immediate time and place, we can talk about any\ntime in the future or past, about any place in the universe, or even fictional places.\n10. Productivity\/creativity: the ability to produce and understand messages that have\nnever been expressed before or to express new ideas. People do not speak according\nto prepared scripts, as if they were in a movie or a play; they create their utterances\nspontaneously, according to the rules of their language. It also makes possible the\ncreation of new words and even the ability to lie.\nA number of great apes, including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans, have been\ntaught human sign languages with all of the human design features. In each case, the apes have\nbeen able to communicate as humans do to an extent, but their linguistic abilities are reduced by\nthe limited cognitive abilities that accompany their smaller brains.\n1.6 Adapted from Perspectives, Language (Linda Light, 2017)\nA THREEFOLD APPROACH TO LANGUAGE\n\u25c6 The study of the mechanics of language .\nThe Linguistic \u2022 e .g ., final \u2013s with 3rd person verbs in English .

Define and contrast verbal and non-verbal communication\n2. Define and contrast the following terms: phonology and phonetic; lexicon; semantics;\ngrammar; syntax; phoneme and morpheme\n3. Explain and illustrate the ways in which sounds, word choice, and words order create and\nconvey meaning in different languages\n4. Explain why the definitions above are good working tools for us to understand language\nmore in-depth, by providing examples of linguistic misunderstandings\n5. Understand the meanings of silence and gestures in select cultures\nReflection Questions\n1. How important is non-verbal communication in communication?\n2. What examples do you have of non-verbal communication?\n3. Do you use a lot of gestures when talking? Do you think gestures are universally\nunderstandable?\n4. Do you have a preference for spoken or written communication? Why or why not?\n5. How are they different, if at all?\n2.1 Theory of Non-Verbal Communication: Important Concepts\nWe use body language, eye contact, gestures, posture, and facial expressions to communicate\nwith one another. Although the majority of nonverbal communication studies first researched\nby Ray Birdwhistell focus on face-to-face encounters between two or more people, advances\nin technology are creating new forms of nonverbal communication. Handwriting styles and\nemoticons can be included in this new category. Emoticons, which are often used in text\nmessaging, serve to more clearly express a point or add context to what is being communicated\nsince one\u2019s tone of voice and facial expressions cannot be seen at the time of viewing.\nNonverbal communication can be an incredibly effective way of sending and receiving messages\nfrom person to person, especially in a foreign country. For example, you can communicate\nhunger through making a gesture pointing to your stomach or your mouth, a universal sign.\nOften people will use this rudimentary sign language to speak to others when they need\nsomething. Another subtle yet common form of nonverbal communication is facial expressions.\n14 CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 15\nIt\u2019s easy to portray being happy or sad or confused. However, there are other social expressions in\nforeign countries that become important to pay attention to. For example, when giving a speech\nat a table in Sweden, it\u2019s expected to make direct eye contact with others, contrary to Japan,\nwhere eye contact is seen as rude and disrespectful, especially in public areas.\nNonverbal communication can also lead to things that people did not mean to communicate.\nFor example, a person from American culture sees kissing as a sign of affection but in some\nSpanish-speaking countries, kissing is a way to greet someone. There are also certain ways to kiss\nsomeone in those countries depending on what your relationship is to that person. If two people\nfrom these places meet and one of them comes in for a kiss because they think they are greeting\nthem properly, the other person might become confused as to why the other person is trying to\nkiss them. Sometimes nonverbal communication can bring to light the many cultural differences\nthat there are around the world.\nClothing has been known to be a form of communication or expression, as well. For example,\nthe chief of a Native tribe will dress more extravagantly than other members of the tribe, such\nas with a piece like a feathered headdress. Great hunters wear animal skins to show off a kill\nin some hunter-gatherer communities. Another cultural piece of clothing would be a wedding\ndress. It is meant to be worn on the day that two people get married and is typically never to be\nworn again. Oftentimes, couples spend thousands on said dress because it is a special occasion\nto show the love of the couple to the people they care about. Sometimes the physical\u2014what\na person wears, how they move, or how they express emotions\u2014can mean more than words,\nproviding little clues into cultures.\n2.1.1 Proxemics\nProxemics, coined by anthropologist Edward T. Hall PUBLIC SPACE\nin 1966, is the amount of space that people feel\nnecessary to put between themselves and others\nSOCIAL SPACE\nas they interact. The category of proxemics is\nmost commonly sub-grouped into a physical\nPERSONAL\nterritory and personal territory, although SPACE\nINTIMATE\nproxemics can also be identified in several\nSPACE\nother forms, such as eye contact, facial\n1.5 ft\n(0.45 m)\nexpression, smells, body warmth, gender,\n4 ft\n(1.2 m)\nand the number of people involved. The\n12 ft\nFIGURE 2.1. A diagram representation of personal space (3.6 m)\nlimits, according to Edward T. Hall\u2019s interpersonal distances of\nman, showing radius in feet and meters. (By WebHamster - Own\n25 ft\nwork, CC BY-SA 3.0) (7.6 m) 16 \u2022 PART 2\narea of the personal territory is further sub-grouped as public space (ranging from 12\u201325 feet\nbetween people), social space (ranging from 4\u201310 feet between people), personal space (2\u20134 feet\nof separation), and finally intimate space (a foot or less of separation). The physical distance\nbetween them is related to their social distance. For example, people who know each other very\nwell often communicate in the intimate space, which is about 1.5 feet away from each other,\nwhereas acquaintances will usually communicate about 12 feet from each other.\nProxemics can vary by culture, gender, social setting, and individual preference. For example,\nin U.S. grocery stores it is considered polite to leave the person in front of you in line plenty of\npersonal space. In China, however, due in large part to its denser population, it is common to\nleave less than a two-foot gap between you and the person in front of you in line.\n2.1.2 Chronemics\nChronemics is a field of study examining the utilization of time in nonverbal communication.\nPerceptions of time can play significant roles in various forms of nonverbal communication.\nFor example, a slight pause before finishing an announcement can help to build a sense of\nanticipation in one\u2019s audience. Aside from the transmission of mood, time can also figure\ninto communication in terms of attention span and the expression or reinforcement of power\nrelationships. A culture\u2019s perception of time not only influences the way they communicate\nbut also the way they organize and execute their daily lives. Cultures are divided into two main\ngroups based on the way that members of that culture generally perceive time: monochronic\ncultures and polychronic cultures.\nMonochronic cultures are societies made up of people that appreciate doing one task at a time\nwithout interruption or tardiness. People in these cultures tend to believe that time is linear. The\ncontemporary United States is a monochronic culture. People in the U.S. tend to keep very rigid\nschedules and usually value punctuality, brevity, and adherence to plans made in advance. In the\nU.S., time is viewed as a resource, as is illustrated by the common expression \u201ctime is money.\u201d\nPeople living in monochronic cultures tend to focus on the completion of one task at a time and\nusually view interruption and distraction as things to be avoided. Monochronic cultures like the\nU.S. look down upon being late. When there is a schedule and it is not followed, there are often\nconsequences and social respect is sometimes lost.\nPolychronic cultures tend to see time as fluid and malleable. Characteristics of polychronic\ncultures include interrupted meetings, flexible schedules, and higher values placed on people\nand relationships over punctuality and deadlines. Examples of polychronic cultures are those\nfound in modern Mexico and Egypt. People of these cultures tend to keep open schedules, often\naltering plans without notice and \u201cdouble-booking\u201d themselves. In monochronic cultures such\nas the United States, Germany, and Great Britain, these behaviors are thought to be inefficient\nand improper. People of polychronic cultures are more susceptible to distractions and open to CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 17\ninterruption but are better at focusing on many tasks at once. Polychrons prefer to keep their\ntime unstructured, changing from one activity to another as the mood takes them. Although\npolychrons can meet deadlines, they need to do so in their own way. A polychron does not want\ndetailed plans imposed upon him, nor does he want to make his own detailed plans. Polychrons\nprefer to work as they see fit without a strict schedule, following their internal mental processes\nfrom one minute to the next.\n2.1.3 Kinesics\nKinesics is defined as a study of how \u201cbody movements and gestures serve as a means of\nnonverbal communication.\u201d In short, different movements of your body convey particular ideas\nand kinesics is how nonverbal communication is interpreted, which will greatly vary across\ncultures. Through body movements, it is possible to send signals, such as leaning forward when\nsomeone is talking to show you are engaged and listening. Being aware of kinesics can be an aid\nin relationships, job interviews, or when meeting new people.\nThis term was first used in 1952 by Ray Birdwhistell, an anthropologist who studied this certain\nmovement. He argued that all movements of the body meant something. He said that nothing\nwas done by accident, and every movement was used to say how the person was feeling.\n2.1.4 Posture\nPosture varies from person to person and can be interpreted as nonverbal communication.\nPosture is the position in which someone holds their body when standing or sitting. It is also\nmeant to show a way of dealing with or considering something. Much can be interpreted from a\nperson\u2019s posture such as their view of themselves, their mood, etc. Such behavior can be intended\nto impress or mislead another individual in a particular attitude or mood. Posture is used to\ndetermine a participant\u2019s degree of attention or involvement, the difference in status between\ncommunicators, and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator.\n2.1.5 Gesture\nA gesture is a form of non-verbal communication. It is a distinguished physical movement that\nis an expression of inner thoughts and emotions. Gestures can range from full-body expressions\nsuch as dancing or hugging, to smaller gestures in the hands or arms such as a slap across the\nface, or facial gestures such as scrunching of the face to convey discomfort or disgust. Gestures\nvary widely across cultures, just as vastly as spoken language. In the United States, for example,\na commonly accepted gesture of anger is holding up your middle finger, but this emotion can\nbe expressed via a hand flick under the chin in Spain and Latin America or a thumbs up in Iran\nand Iraq. 18 \u2022 PART 2\n2.1.6 Haptics\nHaptics is used to refer to the sense of touch and touching capabilities. Haptics can be broken\ndown and organized into three different fields.\nHaptic communication is the way that people communicate based solely through touch. This\nsense is important for humans because it provides information about objects that we touch, and\nit is also a part of nonverbal communication. Touch can send a very strong message (positive,\nnegative, sexual, or platonic). Haptic communication is a key to physical intimacy. According to\nresearch conducted by Jones and Yarbrough (1985) there are 7 different types of touch: positive\ntouches, playful touches, control touches, ritualistic touches, hybrid touches, task-related\ntouches, and accidental touches.\nHaptic technology is a technology that interfaces with the user through the sense of touch. An\nexample of this might be all of the touch-screen cell phones that have become very popular in\nthe U.S.\nHaptic perception is used when we recognize an object by touching it. It involves the\ncombination of the senses in the skin, the position of the hand, and conformation. This is used in\nmany everyday actions. An example of this would be using your hand to dig around in your bag\nlooking for a particular object, like a cell phone or a pen. This haptic is particularly useful for the\nblind who may rely entirely upon touch in order to identify an object since they cannot see it.\nAn ethnographic representation of haptics in different cultures depends on what is socially\nacceptable. For example, in the United States it is usually a form of positive touching when you\npat someone\u2019s head, but in the Thai culture, it is rude to touch someone\u2019s head.\n2.1.7 Eye Contact\nEye contact is one of the most important forms of nonverbal communication between people.\nEye contact signals vary from culture to culture and vary among certain religions as well. For\nexample, in America, someone who is unable to maintain eye contact is seen as unconfident, shy,\nor submissive. In some Arab countries, a person who is unable to maintain eye contact is seen as\ndisrespectful.\nSome cultures, such as South Asia, might view extended eye contact as challenging, rude, and\naggressive. In the Islamic faith, Muslims often lower their gaze and do not look at the opposite\ngender\u2019s eyes after the initial greeting. This is because lustful glances to those of the opposite\ngender are prohibited. What is considered harmless flirting in some western cultures may be\nseen as a form of adultery in Islam. In English-speaking cultures, a certain amount of eye contact\nis required in daily social situations, but too much eye contact can have misdirected meaning,\noften misinterpreted. CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 19\n2.1.8 Sign Languages\nSign language is a formal language using a system of hand gestures and movements, typically\nreplacing vocalization. Sign language is the dominant language for the deaf community. Like\nany other language, it has its own unique structure and linguistic components. Also similar to\nhow most languages are learned, sign language is learned through visualization, practice, and\npatience. However, understanding that 90% of the deaf community have hearing parents, sign\nlanguage is mostly learned in schools because for those 90%, sign language is not their mother\ntongue. However, spoken languages are faster than sign language, which means that it takes a\nlonger time. There are many types of sign language around the world, including:\n\u2022 American Sign Language, used primarily in North America, English-speaking parts of\nCanada and Mexico, and small countries\n\u2022 French Sign Language, used in France, Switzerland, Mali, Rwanda, Congo, Togo, Vietnam\n\u2022 Ethiopian Sign Language, used in Ethiopia\n\u2022 Spanish Sign Language, used in many parts of Spain\n\u2022 Arabic Sign Language, used across the Middle East\nSign language is actually one of the quickest ways for children to learn how to communicate as\nwell. Picking up on motions and symbols is a much easier thing for children to do than make\nsounds. By learning sign language first, some children have an easier time learning to verbally\nspeak. The children will have an image or sign already in their mind to match the word.\nAmerican Sign Language\nAmerican Sign Language is an intricate language that\nuses signs made with the hands and other movements\nsuch as facial expressions and postures of the body. Sign\nlanguage is the fourth most commonly used language in\nthe United States.\nASL originated when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, an\napprentice lawyer, and Laurent Clerc, a prominent deaf\nman who was fluent in French Sign Language, founded\nthe American School for the Deaf. This was the first\nof its kind in the U.S., and in 1817 the school would\nwitness seven students become the first class to graduate.\nASL was not recognized as a legitimate language until\nthe 1960s. Prior to this, it was considered a broken,\nFIGURE 2.2. ASL fingerspelling alphabet.\nlimited form of the English language. (By Spaynton - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0) 20 \u2022 PART 2\n2.1 Adapted from Cultural Anthropology, Human Nonverbal Communication\n(Wikibooks contributors, 2018)\n2.2 Theory of Verbal Communication: Important Concepts\n\u201cConsciousness can\u2019t evolve any faster than language.\u201d\n\u2014Terence McKenna\nImagine for a moment that you have no language with which to communicate. It\u2019s hard to\nimagine, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s probably even harder to imagine that with all of the advancements we have\nat our disposal today, there are people in our world who actually do not have, or cannot use,\nlanguage to communicate.\n2.2.1 Sign Language\nNearly 25 years ago, the Nicaraguan government started bringing deaf children together from all\nover the country in an attempt to educate them. These children had spent their lives in remote\nplaces and had no contact with other deaf people. They had never learned a language and could\nnot understand their teachers or each other. Likewise, their teachers could not understand\nthem. Shortly after bringing these students together, the teachers noticed that the students\ncommunicated with each other in what appeared to be an organized fashion: they had literally\nbrought together the individual gestures they used at home and composed them into a new\nlanguage. Although the teachers still did not understand what the kids were saying, they were\nastonished at what they were witnessing\u2014the birth of a new language in the late 20th century!\nThis was an unprecedented discovery.\nIn 1986, American linguist Judy Kegl went to Nicaragua to find out what she could learn from\nthese children without language. She contends that our brains are open to language until the age\nof 12 or 13, and then language becomes difficult to learn. She quickly discovered approximately\n300 people in Nicaragua who did not have language and says, \u201cThey are invaluable to\nresearch\u2014among the only people on Earth who can provide clues to the beginnings of human\ncommunication.\u201d To access the full transcript, view the following link:\nSupplemental reading: CBS News: Birth of a Language\nAdrien Perez, one of the early deaf students who formed this new language (referred to as\nNicaraguan Sign Language), says that without verbal communication, \u201cYou can\u2019t express your\nfeelings. Your thoughts may be there but you can\u2019t get them out. And you can\u2019t get new thoughts in.\u201d CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 21\nAs one of the few people on earth who has experienced life with and without verbal communication,\nhis comments speak to the heart of communication: it is the essence of who we are and how we\nunderstand our world. We use it to form our identities, initiate and maintain relationships, express\nour needs and wants, construct and shape world-views, and achieve personal goals (Pelley).\n2.2.2 Defining Verbal Communication\nWhen people ponder the word communication, they often think about the act of talking. We rely\non verbal communication to exchange messages with one another and develop as individuals.\nThe term verbal communication often evokes the idea of spoken communication, but written\ncommunication is also part of verbal communication. Reading this book, you are decoding\nthe authors\u2019 written verbal communication in order to learn more about communication. Let\u2019s\nexplore the various components of our definition of verbal communication and examine how it\nfunctions in our lives.\nVerbal Communication Nonverbal Communication\nOral Spoken language Laughing, crying, coughing, etc.\nNon oral Written language\/sign language Gestures, body language, etc.\nVerbal communication is about language, both written and spoken. In general, verbal\ncommunication refers to our use of words, whereas nonverbal communication refers to\ncommunication that occurs through means other than words, such as body language, gestures,\nand silence. Both verbal and nonverbal communication can be spoken and written. Many people\nmistakenly assume that verbal communication refers only to spoken communication. However,\nyou will learn that this is not the case. Let\u2019s say you tell a friend a joke, and he or she laughs in\nresponse. Is the laughter verbal or nonverbal communication? Why? As laughter is not a word,\nwe would consider this vocal act as a form of nonverbal communication. For simplification,\nthe table above highlights the kinds of communication that fall into the various categories. You\ncan find many definitions of verbal communication in our literature, but for this text, we define\nverbal communication as an agreed-upon and rule-governed system of symbols used to share\nmeaning. Let\u2019s examine each component of this definition in detail.\nA System of Symbols\nSymbols are arbitrary representations of thoughts, ideas, emotions, objects, or actions used to\nencode and decode meaning (Nelson & Kessler Shaw). Symbols stand for, or represent, something\nelse. For example, there is nothing inherent about calling a cat a cat.\nRather, English speakers have agreed that these symbols (words), whose components (letters) are\nused in a particular order each time, stand for both the actual object, as well as our interpretation 22 \u2022 PART 2\nSender\u2019s Idea FIGURE 2.3. Ogden & Richard\u2019s Triangle of Meaning (1923):\nthe actual thing, a cat, at one point of the triangle; the\nsymbol, i.e., the sound or letter combination \u201cCAT,\u201d at another\npoint; and the mental representation of a cat in the sender\u2019s\nmind at the third point.\nof that object. This idea is illustrated by C. K. Ogden\nand I. A. Richard\u2019s triangle of meaning. The word\nActual Object \u201ccat\u201d is not the actual cat. Nor does it have any direct\nconnection to an actual cat. Instead, it is a symbolic\nSymbol\n\u201cCAT\u201d representation of our idea of a cat, as indicated by\nthe line going from the word \u201ccat\u201d to the speaker\u2019s\nidea of \u201ccat\u201d to the actual object.\nSymbols have three distinct qualities: they are arbitrary, ambiguous, and abstract. Notice that the\npicture of the cat on the left side of the triangle more closely represents a real cat than the word\n\u201ccat.\u201d However, we do not use pictures as language, or verbal communication. Instead, we use words\nto represent our ideas. This example demonstrates our agreement that the word \u201ccat\u201d represents\nor stands for a real cat AND our idea of a cat. The symbols we use are arbitrary and have no direct\nrelationship to the objects or ideas they represent. We generally consider communication successful\nwhen we reach agreement on the meanings of the symbols we use (Duck).\nSymbols Are Abstract, Ambiguous, Arbitrary\nNot only are symbols arbitrary, they are ambiguous\u2014that is, they have several possible meanings.\nImagine your friend tells you she has an apple on her desk. Is she referring to a piece of fruit or\nher computer? If a friend says that a person he met is cool, does he mean that person is cold or\nawesome? The meanings of symbols change over time due to changes in social norms, values,\nFIGURE 2.4. The words abstract, ambiguous, and\narbitrary with definitions (found in the text below)\npointing to \u201cSymbols are.\u201d (By Spaynton - Own work,\nCC BY-SA 4.0) CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 23\nand advances in technology. You might be asking, \u201cIf symbols can have multiple meanings then\nhow do we communicate and understand one another?\u201d We are able to communicate because\nthere are a finite number of possible meanings for our symbols, a range of meanings which the\nmembers of a given language system agree upon. Without an agreed-upon system of symbols, we\ncould share relatively little meaning with one another.\nA simple example of ambiguity can be represented by one of your classmates asking a simple\nquestion to the teacher during a lecture where she is showing PowerPoint slides: \u201cCan you go to\nthe last slide, please?\u201d The teacher is halfway through the presentation. Is the student asking if\nthe teacher can go back to the previous slide? Or does the student really want the lecture to be\nover with and is insisting that the teacher jump to the final slide of the presentation? Chances\nare the student missed a point on the previous slide and would like to see it again to quickly\ntake notes. However, suspense may have overtaken the student and they may have a desire to\nsee the final slide. Even a simple word like \u201clast\u201d can be ambiguous and open to more than one\ninterpretation.\nThe verbal symbols we use are also abstract, meaning that words are not material or physical. A\ncertain level of abstraction is inherent in the fact that symbols can only represent objects and ideas.\nThis abstraction allows us to use a phrase like \u201cthe public\u201d in a broad way to mean all the people\nin the United States rather than having to distinguish among all the diverse groups that make\nup the U.S. population. Similarly, in J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter book series, wizards and witches\ncall the non-magical population on earth \u201cmuggles\u201d rather than having to define all the separate\ncultures of muggles. Abstraction is helpful when you want to communicate complex concepts in a\nsimple way. However, the more abstract the language, the greater potential there is for confusion.\nRule-Governed\nVerbal communication is rule-governed. We must follow agreed-upon rules to make sense of the\nsymbols we share. Let\u2019s take another look at our example of the word cat. What would happen\nif there were no rules for using the symbols (letters) that make up this word? If placing these\nsymbols in a proper order was not important, then cta, tac, tca, act, or atc could all mean cat.\nEven worse, what if you could use any three letters to refer to cat? Or still worse, what if there\nwere no rules and anything could represent cat? Clearly, it\u2019s important that we have rules to\ngovern our verbal communication. There are four general rules for verbal communication,\ninvolving the sounds, meaning, arrangement, and use of symbols.\n\u2022 Phonology is the study of speech sounds. The pronunciation of the word cat comes from\nthe rules governing how letters sound, especially in relation to one another. The context in\nwhich words are spoken may provide answers for how they should be pronounced. When\nwe don\u2019t follow phonological rules, confusion results. One way to understand and apply\nphonological rules is to use syntactic and pragmatic rules to clarify phonological rules. 24 \u2022 PART 2\n\u2022 Semantic rules help us understand the difference in meaning between the word cat and\nthe word dog. Instead of each of these words meaning any four-legged domestic pet, we\nuse each word to specify what four-legged domestic pet we are talking about. You\u2019ve\nprobably used these words to say things like, \u201cI\u2019m a cat person\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m a dog person.\u201d\nEach of these statements provides insight into what the sender is trying to communicate.\nWe attach meanings to words; meanings are not inherent in words themselves. As you\u2019ve\nbeen reading, words (symbols) are arbitrary and attain meaning only when people give\nthem meaning. While we can always look to a dictionary to find a standardized definition\nof a word, or its denotative meaning, meanings do not always follow standard, agreed-\nupon definitions when used in various contexts. For example, think of the word \u201csick.\u201d\nThe denotative definition of the word is ill or unwell. However, connotative meanings,\nthe meanings we assign based on our experiences and beliefs, are quite varied. Sick can\nhave a connotative meaning that describes something as good or awesome as opposed\nto its literal meaning of illness, which usually has a negative association. The denotative\nand connotative definitions of \u201csick\u201d are in total contrast of one another, which can cause\nconfusion. Think about an instance where a student is asked by their parent about a friend\nat school. The student replies that the friend is \u201csick.\u201d The parent then asks about the\nnew teacher at school and the student describes the teacher as \u201csick\u201d as well. The parent\nmust now ask for clarification as they do not know if the teacher is in bad health, or is an\nexcellent teacher, and if the friend of their child is ill or awesome.\n\u2022 Syntactics is the study of language structure and symbolic arrangement. Syntactics focuses\non the rules we use to combine words into meaningful sentences and statements. We\nspeak and write according to agreed-upon syntactic rules to keep meaning coherent\nand understandable. Think about this sentence: \u201cThe pink and purple elephant flapped\nits wings and flew out the window.\u201d While the content of this sentence is fictitious and\nunreal, you can understand and visualize it because it follows syntactic rules for language\nstructure.\n\u2022 Pragmatics is the study of how people actually use verbal communication. For example, as a\nstudent you probably speak more formally to your professors than to your peers. It\u2019s likely\nthat you make different word choices when you speak to your parents than you do when\nyou speak to your friends. Think of the words \u201cbowel movements,\u201d \u201cpoop,\u201d \u201ccrap,\u201d and\n\u201cshit.\u201d While all of these words have essentially the same denotative meaning, people make\nchoices based on context and audience regarding which word they feel comfortable using.\nThese differences illustrate the pragmatics of our verbal communication. Even though\nyou use agreed-upon symbolic systems and follow phonological, syntactic, and semantic\nrules, you apply these rules differently in different contexts. Each communication context\nhas different rules for \u201cappropriate\u201d communication. We are trained from a young age to\ncommunicate \u201cappropriately\u201d in different social contexts. CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 25\nIt is only through an agreed-upon and rule-governed system of symbols that we can exchange\nverbal communication in an effective manner. Without agreement, rules, and symbols, verbal\ncommunication would not work. The reality is, after we learn language in school, we don\u2019t spend\nmuch time consciously thinking about all of these rules, we simply use them. However, rules\nkeep our verbal communication structured in ways that make it useful for us to communicate\nmore effectively.\n2.2 Adapted from Survey of Communication Study (Laura K. Hahn & Scott T. Paynton, 2019)\n2.2.3 Mental Grammar and Phonology\nYou can either watch the video at the following link, or read the script below.\nWatch the video: Mental Grammar (Anderson, 2018)\nVideo transcript:\nWe know now that linguistics is the scientific study of human language . It\u2019s also important\nto know that linguistics is one member of the broad field that\u2019s known as cognitive science .\nThe cognitive sciences are interested in what goes on in the mind, and in linguistics we\u2019re\nspecifically interested in how our language knowledge is represented and organized in the\nhuman mind .\nThink about this: you and I both speak English . I\u2019m speaking English right here on this\nvideo, and you\u2019re listening and understanding me . Right now, I\u2019ve got some idea in my\nmind that I want to express . I\u2019m squeezing air out of my lungs, I\u2019m vibrating my vocal folds,\nI\u2019m manipulating parts of my mouth to produce sounds . Those sounds are captured by a\nmicrophone and now they\u2019re playing on your computer . In response to the sound coming\nfrom your computer speaker or your headphones, your eardrums are vibrating and sending\nsignals to your brain with the result that the idea in your mind is something similar to the\nidea that was in my mind when I made this video . There must be something that your mind\nand my mind have in common to allow that to happen, some shared system that allows us to\nunderstand each other, to understand each other\u2019s ideas when we speak .\nIn linguistics, we call that system the mental grammar and our primary goal is to find out what\nthat shared system is like . All speakers of all languages have a mental grammar, that shared\nsystem that lets speakers of a language understand each other . In essentials of linguistics, 26 \u2022 PART 2\nwe devote most of our attention to the mental grammar of English, but we\u2019ll also use our\nscientific tools and techniques to examine some parts of the grammars of other languages .\nWe\u2019ll start by looking at sound systems, how speakers make particular sounds and how\nlisteners hear these sounds . If you\u2019ve ever tried to learn a second language, you know\nthat the sounds in the second language are not always the same as in your first language .\nLinguists call the study of speech sounds phonetics . Then we\u2019ll look at how the mental\ngrammar of each language organizes sounds the mind . This is called phonology . We\u2019ll\nexamine the strategies that languages use to form meaningful words . This is called\nmorphology . Then we take a close look at the different ways that languages combine\nwords to form phrases and sentences . The term for that is syntax . We also look at how the\nmeanings of words and sentences are organized in the mind, which linguists call semantics .\nThese five things are the core pieces of the mental grammar of any language . They\u2019re the\nthings all speakers know about their language . All languages have phonetics, phonology,\nmorphology, syntax, and semantics in their grammars . And these five areas are also the core\nsubfields of theoretical linguistics . Just as there are other kinds of language knowledge we\nhave there are other branches of the field of linguistics, and we\u2019ll take a peek at some of\nthose other branches along the way .\nWe will study each of these aspects of linguistics study more in depth over the next few\ncheckpoints.\n2.2.4 Sounds and Language, Language and Sounds\nPhonology\nPhonology is the use of sounds to encode messages within a spoken human language. Babies\nare born with the capacity to speak any language because they can make sounds and hear\ndifferences in sounds that adults would not be able to do. This is what parents hear as baby talk.\nThe infant is trying out all of the different sounds they can produce. As the infant begins to\nlearn the language from their parents, they begin to narrow the range of sounds they produce\nto ones common to the language they are learning, and by the age of 5, they no longer have the\nvocal range they had previously. For example, a common sound that is used in Indian language\nis \/dh\/. To any native Indian there is a huge difference between \/dh\/ and \/d\/, but for people like\nme who cannot speak Hindi, not only can we not hear the difference, but it is very difficult to\neven attempt to produce this sound. Another large variation between languages for phonology\nis where in your mouth you speak from. In English, we speak mostly from the front or middle of\nour mouths, but it is very common in African languages to speak from the glottal, which is the\ndeepest part of one\u2019s throat. CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 27\nThe Biological Basis of Language\nThe human anatomy that allowed the development of language emerged six to seven million\nyears ago when the first human ancestors became bipedal\u2014habitually walking on two feet. Most\nother mammals are quadrupedal\u2014they move about on four feet. This evolutionary development\nfreed up the forelimbs of human ancestors for other activities, such as carrying items and\ndoing more and more complex things with their hands. It also started a chain of anatomical\nadaptations. One adaptation was a change in the way the skull was placed on the spine. The skull\nof quadrupedal animals is attached to the spine at the back of the skull because the head is thrust\nforward. With the new upright bipedal position of pre-humans, the attachment to the spine\nmoved toward the center of the base of the skull. This skeletal change in turn brought about\nchanges in the shape and position of the mouth and throat anatomy.\nHumans have all the same organs in the mouth and throat that the other great apes have, but the\nlarynx, or voice box (you may know it as the Adam\u2019s apple), is in a lower position in the throat\nin humans. This creates a longer pharynx, or throat cavity, which functions as a resonating and\namplifying chamber for the speech sounds emitted by the larynx. The rounding of the shape of\nthe tongue and palate, or the roof of the mouth, enables humans to make a greater variety of\nsounds than any great ape is capable of making (see Figure 2.5).\nSpeech is produced by exhaling air from the lungs, which passes through the larynx. The voice\nis created by the vibration of the vocal folds in the larynx when they are pulled tightly together,\nleaving a narrow slit for the air to pass through under pressure. The narrower the slit, the higher\nthe pitch of the sound produced. The sound waves in the exhaled air pass through the pharynx\nthen out through the mouth and\/or the nose. The different positions and movements of the\narticulators\u2014the tongue, the lips, the jaw\u2014\nNasal Cavity\nproduce the different speech sounds.\nPalate\n(Roof of Mouth)\nAlong with the changes in mouth Velum\nand throat anatomy that made speech\nAlveolar\npossible came a gradual enlargement and\nRidge\ncompartmentalization of the brain of\nhuman ancestors over millions of years. The\nmodern human brain is among the largest, Oral\nCavity\nin proportion to body size, of all animals.\nThis development was crucial to language Lips\nTeeth Voice\nFIGURE 2.5. Human articulatory anatomy. Human vocal Tongue Box\ntract. Areas where constriction occurs in the vocal (Tongue Tip &\ntract to create the various phonetic gestures. Tongue Blade) 28 \u2022 PART 2\nability because a tremendous amount of brain power is required to process, store, produce, and\ncomprehend the complex system of any human language and its associated culture. In addition,\ntwo areas in the left brain are specifically dedicated to the processing of language; no other\nspecies has them. They are Broca\u2019s area in the left frontal lobe near the temple, and Wernicke\u2019s\narea, in the temporal lobe just behind the left ear.\nParalanguage\nParalanguage refers to those characteristics of speech beyond the actual words spoken. These\ninclude the features that are inherent to all speech: pitch, loudness, and tempo or duration of\nthe sounds. Varying pitch can convey any number of messages: a question, sarcasm, defiance,\nsurprise, confidence or lack of it, impatience, and many other often subtle connotations. An\nutterance that is shouted at close range usually conveys an emotional element, such as anger or\nurgency. A word or syllable that is held for an undue amount of time can intensify the impact of\nthat word. For example, compare \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u201d versus \u201cIt\u2019s beauuuuu-tiful!\u201d Often the latter type\nof expression is further emphasized by extra loudness of the syllable, and perhaps higher pitch;\nall can serve to make a part of the utterance more important. Other paralinguistic features that\noften accompany speech might be a chuckle, a sigh or sob, deliberate throat clearing, and many\nother non-verbal sounds like \u201chm,\u201d \u201coh,\u201d \u201cah,\u201d and \u201cum.\u201d\nMost non-verbal behaviors are unconsciously performed and not noticed unless someone\nviolates the cultural standards for them. In fact, a deliberate violation itself can convey meaning.\nOther non-verbal behaviors are done consciously like the U.S. gestures that indicate approval,\nsuch as thumbs up, or making a circle with your thumb and forefinger\u2014\u201cOK.\u201d Other examples\nare waving at someone or putting a forefinger to your lips to quiet another person. Many of these\ndeliberate gestures have different meanings (or no meaning at all) in other cultures. For example,\nthe gestures of approval in U.S. culture mentioned above may be obscene or negative gestures in\nanother culture.\nTry this: As an experiment in the power of non-verbal communication, try violating one of the\ncultural rules for proxemics or eye contact with a person you know. Choosing your \u201cguinea pigs\u201d\ncarefully (they might get mad at you!), try standing or sitting a little closer or farther away from\nthem than you usually would for a period of time, until they notice (and they will notice). Or,\nyou could choose to give them a bit too much eye contact, or too little, while you are conversing\nwith them. Note how they react to your behavior and how long it takes them to notice.\nPhonemes\nA phoneme is the smallest phonetic unit in a language that is capable of conveying a distinction\nin meaning. For example, in English we can tell that pail and tail are different words, so \/p\/ and\n\/t\/ are phonemes. Two words differing in only one sound, like pail and tail, are called a minimal CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 29\npair. The International Phonetic Association created the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA),\na collection of standardized representations of the sounds of spoken language.\nWhen a native speaker does not recognize different sounds as being distinct they are called\nallophones. For example, in the English language we consider the p in pin and the p in spin\nto have the same phoneme, which makes them allophones. In Chinese, however, these two\nsimilar phonemes are treated separately and both have a separate symbol in their alphabet. The\nminimum bits of meaning that native speakers recognize are known as phonemes. It is any small\nset of units, usually about 20 to 60 in number, and different for each language, considered to\nbe the basic distinctive units of speech sound by which morphemes, words, and sentences are\nrepresented.\nA phoneme is defined as the minimal unit of sound that can make a difference in meaning if\nsubstituted for another sound in a word that is otherwise identical. The phoneme itself does not\ncarry meaning. For example, in English if the sound we associate with the letter \u201cp\u201d is substituted\nfor the sound of the letter \u201cb\u201d in the word bit, the word\u2019s meaning is changed because now it\nis pit, a different word with an entirely different meaning. The human articulatory anatomy\nis capable of producing many hundreds of sounds, but no language has more than about 100\nphonemes. English has about 36 or 37 phonemes, including about eleven vowels, depending on\ndialect. Hawaiian has only five vowels and about eight consonants. No two languages have the\nsame exact set of phonemes.\nLinguists use a written system called the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to represent\nthe sounds of a language. Unlike the letters of our alphabet that spell English words, each IPA\nsymbol always represents only one sound no matter the language. For example, the letter \u201ca\u201d in\nEnglish can represent the different vowel sounds in such words as cat, make, papa, law, etc., but\nthe IPA symbol \/a\/ always and only represents the vowel sound of papa or pop.\n2.2.4 Adapted from Cultural Anthropology, Communication and Language\n(Wikibooks contributors, 2018)\nAdapted from Perspectives, Language (Linda Light, 2017)\n2.2.5 Morphology, Syntax, and Semantics\nThe study of the structures of language is called descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguists\ndiscover and describe the phonemes of a language, research called phonology. They study the\nlexicon (the vocabulary) of a language and how the morphemes are used to create new words,\nor morphology. They analyze the rules by which speakers create phrases and sentences, or the\nstudy of syntax. And they look at how these features all combine to convey meaning in certain\nsocial contexts, fields of study called semantics and pragmatics. 30 \u2022 PART 2\nMorphology\nThe definition of morphology is the study of the structure\nof words formed together, or more simply put, the study\nof morphemes. Morphemes are the smallest utterances\nwith meaning. Not all morphemes are words. Many\nlanguages use affixes, which carry specific grammatical\nmeanings and are therefore morphemes, but are not\nwords. For example, English-speakers do not think\nof the suffix -ing as a word, but it is a morpheme. The\ncreation of morphemes rather than words also allowed\nanthropologists to more easily translate languages. For\nFIGURE 2.6. A junior Moran with head-\nexample, in the English language, the prefix un- means\ndress and markings. It would be difficult\n\u201cthe opposite, not, or lacking,\u201d which can distinguish the to translate this tribe\u2019s language without\nthe use of morphemes.\nwords \u201cunheard\u201d and \u201cheard\u201d apart from each other.\nMorphology is very helpful in translating different languages, such as the language Bangla. For\nexample, some words do not have a literal translation from Bangla to English because a word in\nBangla may mean more than one word in English. Two professors from Bangladesh discovered\nan algorithm that could translate Bangla words, as they are generally very complex. They first\nsearch for the whole word. If this does not come up with results, they then search the first\nmorpheme they find; in one example, it was \u201cMa\u201d of \u201cManushtir.\u201d \u201cMa\u201d was a correct morpheme,\nhowever \u201cnushtir\u201d was not. The researchers then attempted \u201cMan,\u201d however \u201cushtir\u201d was not\na correct morpheme. They next tried \u201cManush\u201d and \u201ctir,\u201d discovering that this was correct\ncombination of morphemes.\nThe Units That Carry Meaning: Morphemes\nMorphemes are \u201cthe smallest grammatical unit of language\u201d that has semantic meaning. In\nspoken language, morphemes are composed of phonemes (the smallest unit of spoken language),\nbut in written language morphemes are composed of graphemes (the smallest unit of written\nlanguage). A morpheme can stand alone, meaning it forms a word by itself, or be a bound\nmorpheme, where it has to attach to another bound morpheme or a standalone morpheme in\norder to form a word. Prefixes and suffixes are the simplest form of bound morphemes. For\nexample, the word \u201cbookkeeper\u201d has three morphemes: \u201cbook,\u201d \u201ckeep,\u201d and \u201c-er.\u201d This example\nillustrates the key difference between a word and a morpheme; although a morpheme can be\na standalone word, it can also need to be associated with other units in order to make sense.\nMeaning that one would not go around saying \u201c-er\u201d interdependently, it must be bound to one\nor more other morphemes. CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 31\nA morpheme is a minimal unit of meaning in a language; a morpheme cannot be broken down\ninto any smaller units that still relate to the original meaning. It may be a word that can stand\nalone, called an unbound morpheme (dog, happy, go, educate). Or it could be any part of a\nword that carries meaning that cannot stand alone but must be attached to another morpheme,\nbound morphemes. They may be placed at the beginning of the root word, such as un- (\u201cnot,\u201d\nas in unhappy), or re- (\u201cagain,\u201d as in rearrange). Or, they may follow the root, as in -ly (makes\nan adjective into an adverb: quickly from quick), -s (for plural, possessive, or a verb ending) in\nEnglish. Some languages, like Chinese, have very few if any bound morphemes. Others, like\nSwahili have so many that nouns and verbs cannot stand alone as separate words; they must have\none or more other bound morphemes attached to them.\nSemantics\nSemantics is the study of meaning. Some anthropologists have seen linguistics as basic to a\nscience of man because it provides a link between the biological and sociocultural levels. Modern\nlinguistics is diffusing widely in anthropology itself among younger scholars, producing work\nof competence that ranges from historical and descriptive studies to problems of semantic and\nsocial variation. In the 1960s, Chomsky prompted a formal analysis of semantics and argued that\ngrammars needed to represent all of a speaker\u2019s linguistic knowledge, including the meaning\nof words. Most semanticists focused attention on how words are linked to each other within a\nlanguage through five different relations:\n1. Synonymy\u2014same meaning (ex: old and aged)\n2. Homophony\u2014same sound, different meaning (ex: would and wood)\n3. Antonymy\u2014opposite meaning (ex: tall and short)\n4. Denotation\u2014what words refer to in the \u201creal\u201d world (ex: having the word pig refer to the\nactual animal, instead of pig meaning dirty, smelly, messy, or sloppy)\n5. Connotation\u2014additional meanings that derive from the typical contexts in which they\nare used in everyday speech (ex: calling a person a pig, not meaning the animal but\nmeaning that they are dirty, smelly, messy, or sloppy)\nFormal semanticists only focused on the first four, but we have now discovered that our ability\nto use the same words in different ways (and different words in the same way) goes beyond the\nlimits of formal semantics. Included in the study of semantics are metaphors, which are a form\nof figurative or nonliteral language that links together expressions from unrelated semantic\ndomains. A semantic domain is a set of linguistic expressions with interrelated meanings;\nfor example, the words pig and chicken are in the same semantic domain. But when you use\na metaphor to call a police officer a pig, you are combining two semantic domains to create\nmeaning that the police officer is fat, greedy, dirty, etc. 32 \u2022 PART 2\nConveying Meaning in Language: Semantics and Pragmatics\nThe whole purpose of language is to communicate meaning about the world around us so\nthe study of meaning is of great interest to linguists and anthropologists alike. The field of\nsemantics focuses on the study of the meanings of words and other morphemes as well as how\nthe meanings of phrases and sentences derive from them. Recently linguists have been enjoying\nexamining the multitude of meanings and uses of the word \u201clike\u201d among American youth,\nmade famous through the film Valley Girl in 1983. Although it started as a feature of California\nEnglish, it has spread all across the country, and even to many young second-language speakers\nof English. It\u2019s, like, totally awesome dude!\nThe study of pragmatics looks at the social and cultural aspects of meaning and how the context\nof an interaction affects it. One aspect of pragmatics is the speech act. Any time we speak we are\nperforming an act, but what we are actually trying to accomplish with that utterance may not\nbe interpretable through the dictionary meanings of the words themselves. For example, if you\nare at the dinner table and say, \u201cCan you pass the salt?\u201d you are probably not asking if the other\nperson is capable of giving you the salt. Often the more polite an utterance, the less direct it will\nbe syntactically. For example, rather than using the imperative syntactic form and saying \u201cGive\nme a cup of coffee,\u201d it is considered more polite to use the question form and say \u201cWould you\nplease give me a cup of coffee?\u201d\nThe Structure of Phrases and Sentences: Syntax\nRules of syntax tell the speaker how to put morphemes together grammatically and meaningfully.\nThere are two main types of syntactic rules: rules that govern word order, and rules that direct\nthe use of certain morphemes that perform a grammatical function. For example, the order\nof words in the English sentence \u201cThe cat chased the dog\u201d cannot be changed around or its\nmeaning would change: \u201cThe dog chased the cat\u201d (something entirely different) or \u201cDog cat the\nchased the\u201d (something meaningless). English relies on word order much more than many other\nlanguages do because it has so few morphemes that can do the same type of work.\nFor example, in our sentence above, the phrase \u201cthe cat\u201d must go first in the sentence, because\nthat is how English indicates the subject of the sentence, the one that does the action of the verb.\nThe phrase \u201cthe dog\u201d must go after the verb, indicating that it is the dog that received the action\nof the verb, or is its object. Other syntactic rules tell us that we must put \u201cthe\u201d before its noun,\nand \u201c-ed\u201d at the end of the verb to indicate past tense. In Russian, the same sentence has fewer\nrestrictions on word order because it has bound morphemes that are attached to the nouns to\nindicate which one is the subject and which is the object of the verb. So the sentence koshka\n[chased] sobaku, which means \u201cthe cat chased the dog,\u201d has the same meaning no matter how\nwe order the words, because the -a on the end of koshka means the cat is the subject, and the -u\non the end of sobaku means the dog is the object. If we switched the endings and said koshku CONVEYING MEANING \u2022 33\nFIGURE 2.7. The study of the\narrangement and order of words,\nfor example if the subject or the\nobject comes first in a sentence.\n[chased] sobaka, now it means the dog did the chasing, even though we haven\u2019t changed the\norder of the words. Notice, too, that Russian does not have a word for \u201cthe.\u201d\nSyntax is the study of rules and principles for constructing sentences in natural languages. Syntax\nstudies the patterns of forming sentences and phrases as well. It comes from ancient Greek\n(\u201csyn-\u201d means together and \u201ctaxis\u201d means arrangement.) Outside of linguistics, syntax is also\nused to refer to the rules of mathematical systems, such as logic, artificial formal languages, and\ncomputer programming language. There are many theoretical approaches to the study of syntax.\nNoam Chomsky, a linguist, sees syntax as a branch of biology, since they view syntax as the study\nof linguistic knowledge as the human mind sees it. Other linguists take a Platonistic view, in that\nthey regard syntax to be the study of an abstract formal system.\nMajor Approaches to Syntax\nGenerative grammar: Noam Chomsky pioneered the generative approach to syntax. The\nhypothesis is that syntax is a structure of the human mind. The goal is to make a complete 34 \u2022 PART 2\nmodel of this inner language, and the model could be used to describe all human language and\nto predict if any utterance would sound correct to a native speaker of the language. It focuses\nmostly on the form of the sentence rather than the communicative function of it. The majority of\ngenerative theories assume that syntax is based on the constituent structure of sentences.\nCategorial grammar: An approach that attributes the syntactic structure to the properties of the\nsyntactic categories, rather than to the rules of grammar.\nDependency grammar: Structure is determined by the relations between a word and its\ndependents rather than being based on constituent structure.\n2.2.5 Adapted from Cultural Anthropology, Communication and Language\n(Wikibooks contributors, 2018) PART 3 The Ethnolinguistic Perspective\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this module, students will be able to:\n1. Define the concept of linguistic relativity\n2. Differentiate linguistic relativity and linguistic determinism\n3. Define the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (against more pop-culture takes on it) and situate it\nin a broader theoretical context\/history\n4. Provide examples of linguistic relativity through examples related to time, space,\nmetaphors, etc.\nIn this part, we will look at language(s) and worldviews at the intersection of language &\nthoughts and language & cognition (i.e., the mental system with which we process the world\naround us, and with which we learn to function and make sense of it). Our main question, which\nwe will not entirely answer but which we will examine in depth, is a chicken and egg one: does\nthought determine language, or does language inform thought?\nWe will talk about the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis; look at examples that support the notion of\nlinguistic relativity (pronouns, kinship terms, grammatical tenses, and what they tell us about\nculture and worldview); and then we will more specifically look into how metaphors are a\nstructural component of worldview, if not cognition itself; and we will wrap up with memes.\n(Can we analyze memes through an ethnolinguistic, relativist lens? We will try!)\n3.1 Linguistic Relativity: The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis\nIn the 1920s, Benjamin Whorf was a graduate student studying with linguist Edward Sapir at\nYale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Sapir, considered the father of American linguistic\nanthropology, was responsible for documenting and recording the languages and cultures\nof many Native American tribes, which were disappearing at an alarming rate. This was due\nprimarily to the deliberate efforts of the United States government to force Native Americans\nto assimilate into the Euro-American culture. Sapir and his predecessors were well aware of\nthe close relationship between culture and language because each culture is reflected in and\ninfluences its language. Anthropologists need to learn the language of the culture they are\nstudying in order to understand the world view of its speakers. Whorf believed that the reverse\nis also true, that a language affects culture as well, by actually influencing how its speakers\nthink. His hypothesis proposes that the words and the structures of a language influence how\nits speakers think about the world, how they behave, and ultimately the culture itself. (See our\n35 36 \u2022 PART 3\ndefinition of culture in Part 1 of this document.) Simply stated, Whorf believed that human\nbeings see the world the way they do because the specific languages they speak influence them to\ndo so.\nHe developed this idea through both his work with Sapir and his work as a chemical engineer for\nthe Hartford Insurance Company investigating the causes of fires. One of his cases while working\nfor the insurance company was a fire at a business where there were a number of gasoline drums.\nThose that contained gasoline were surrounded by signs warning employees to be cautious\naround them and to avoid smoking near them. The workers were always careful around those\ndrums. On the other hand, empty gasoline drums were stored in another area, but employees\nwere more careless there. Someone tossed a cigarette or lighted match into one of the \u201cempty\u201d\ndrums, it went up in flames, and started a fire that burned the business to the ground. Whorf\ntheorized that the meaning of the word empty implied to the worker that \u201cnothing\u201d was there to\nbe cautious about so the worker behaved accordingly. Unfortunately, an \u201cempty\u201d gasoline drum\nmay still contain fumes, which are more flammable than the liquid itself.\nWhorf\u2019s studies at Yale involved working with Native American languages, including Hopi. The\nHopi language is quite different from English, in many ways. For example, let\u2019s look at how the\nHopi language deals with time. Western languages (and cultures) view time as a flowing river\nin which we are being carried continuously away from a past, through the present, and into a\nfuture. Our verb systems reflect that concept with specific tenses for past, present, and future. We\nthink of this concept of time as universal, that all humans see it the same way. A Hopi speaker\nhas very different ideas and the structure of their language both reflects and shapes the way they\nthink about time. The Hopi language has no present, past, or future tense. Instead, it divides the\nworld into what Whorf called the manifested and unmanifest domains. The manifested domain\ndeals with the physical universe, including the present, the immediate past and future; the verb\nsystem uses the same basic structure for all of them. The unmanifest domain involves the remote\npast and the future, as well as the world of desires, thought, and life forces. The set of verb\nforms dealing with this domain are consistent for all of these areas, and are different from the\nmanifested ones. Also, there are no words for hours, minutes, or days of the week. Native Hopi\nspeakers often had great difficulty adapting to life in the English speaking world when it came\nto being \u201con time\u201d for work or other events. It is simply not how they had been conditioned to\nbehave with respect to time in their Hopi world, which followed the phases of the moon and the\nmovements of the sun.\nIn a book about the Abenaki who lived in Vermont in the mid-1800s, Trudy Ann Parker\ndescribed their concept of time, which very much resembled that of the Hopi and many of the\nother Native American tribes. \u201cThey called one full day a sleep, and a year was called a winter.\nEach month was referred to as a moon and always began with a new moon. An Indian day wasn\u2019t\ndivided into minutes or hours. It had four time periods\u2014sunrise, noon, sunset, and midnight.\nEach season was determined by the budding or leafing of plants, the spawning of fish, or the THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 37\nrutting time for animals. Most Indians thought the white race had been running around like\nscared rabbits ever since the invention of the clock.\u201d\nThe lexicon, or vocabulary, of a language is an inventory of the items a culture talks about and\nhas categorized in order to make sense of the world and deal with it effectively. For example,\nmodern life is dictated for many by the need to travel by some kind of vehicle\u2014cars, trucks,\nSUVs, trains, buses, etc. We therefore have thousands of words to talk about them, including\ntypes of vehicles, models, brands, or parts.\nThe most important aspects of each culture are similarly reflected in the lexicon of its language.\nAmong the societies living in the islands of Oceania in the Pacific, fish have great economic and\ncultural importance. This is reflected in the rich vocabulary that describes all aspects of the fish\nand the environments that islanders depend on for survival. For example, in Palau there are\nabout 1,000 fish species and Palauan fishermen knew, long before biologists existed, details about\nthe anatomy, behavior, growth patterns, and habitat of most of them\u2014in many cases far more\nthan modern biologists know even today. Much of fish behavior is related to the tides and the\nphases of the moon. Throughout Oceania, the names given to certain days of the lunar months\nreflect the likelihood of successful fishing. For example, in the Caroline Islands, the name for the\nnight before the new moon is otolol, which means \u201cto swarm.\u201d The name indicates that the best\nfishing days cluster around the new moon. In Hawai`i and Tahiti two sets of days have names\ncontaining the particle `ole or `ore; one occurs in the first quarter of the moon and the other in\nthe third quarter. The same name is given to the prevailing wind during those phases. The words\nmean \u201cnothing,\u201d because those days were considered bad for fishing as well as planting.\nParts of Whorf\u2019s hypothesis, known as linguistic relativity, were controversial from the\nbeginning, and still are among some linguists. Yet Whorf\u2019s ideas now form the basis for an entire\nsub-field of cultural anthropology: cognitive or psychological anthropology. A number of studies\nhave been done that support Whorf\u2019s ideas. Linguist George Lakoff\u2019s work looks at the pervasive\nexistence of metaphors in everyday speech that can be said to predispose a speaker\u2019s world view\nand attitudes on a variety of human experiences. A metaphor is an expression in which one\nkind of thing is understood and experienced in terms of another entirely unrelated thing; the\nmetaphors in a language can reveal aspects of the culture of its speakers. Take, for example, the\nconcept of an argument. In logic and philosophy, an argument is a discussion involving differing\npoints of view, or a debate. But the conceptual metaphor in American culture can be stated as\nARGUMENT IS WAR. This metaphor is reflected in many expressions of the everyday language\nof American speakers: I won the argument. He shot down every point I made. They attacked\nevery argument we made. Your point is right on target. I had a fight with my boyfriend last night.\nIn other words, we use words appropriate for discussing war when we talk about arguments,\nwhich are certainly not real war. But we actually think of arguments as a verbal battle that often\ninvolve anger, and even violence, which then structures how we argue. 38 \u2022 PART 3\nTo illustrate that this concept of argument is not universal, Lakoff suggests imagining a culture\nwhere an argument is not something to be won or lost, with no strategies for attacking or\ndefending, but rather as a dance where the dancers\u2019 goal is to perform in an artful, pleasing way.\nNo anger or violence would occur or even be relevant to speakers of this language, because the\nmetaphor for that culture would be ARGUMENT IS DANCE.\n3.1 Adapted from Perspectives, Language (Linda Light, 2017)\nYou can either watch the video, How Language Shapes the Way We Think, by linguist Lera\nBoroditsky, or read the script below.\nWatch the video: How Language Shapes the Way We Think (Boroditsky, 2018)\nThere are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world\u2014and they all have different sounds,\nvocabularies, and structures. But do they shape the way we think? Cognitive scientist Lera\nBoroditsky shares examples of language\u2014from an Aboriginal community in Australia that\nuses cardinal directions instead of left and right to the multiple words for blue in Russian\u2014that\nsuggest the answer is a resounding yes. \u201cThe beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us\njust how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is,\u201d Boroditsky says. \u201cHuman minds have\ninvented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.\u201d\nVideo transcript:\nSo, I\u2019ll be speaking to you using language  .  .  . because I can . This is one these magical\nabilities that we humans have . We can transmit really complicated thoughts to one another .\nSo what I\u2019m doing right now is, I\u2019m making sounds with my mouth as I\u2019m exhaling . I\u2019m\nmaking tones and hisses and puffs, and those are creating air vibrations in the air . Those air\nvibrations are traveling to you, they\u2019re hitting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those\nvibrations from your eardrums and transforms them into thoughts . I hope .\n[Laughter]\nI hope that\u2019s happening . So because of this ability, we humans are able to transmit our ideas\nacross vast reaches of space and time . We\u2019re able to transmit knowledge across minds . I can\nput a bizarre new idea in your mind right now . I could say, \u201cImagine a jellyfish waltzing in a\nlibrary while thinking about quantum mechanics .\u201d\n[Laughter] THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 39\nNow, if everything has gone relatively well in your life so far, you probably haven\u2019t had that\nthought before .\n[Laughter]\nBut now I\u2019ve just made you think it, through language .\nNow of course, there isn\u2019t just one language in the world, there are about 7,000 languages\nspoken around the world . And all the languages differ from one another in all kinds of ways .\nSome languages have different sounds, they have different vocabularies, and they also have\ndifferent structures\u2014very importantly, different structures . That begs the question: Does the\nlanguage we speak shape the way we think? Now, this is an ancient question . People have\nbeen speculating about this question forever . Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said, \u201cTo\nhave a second language is to have a second soul\u201d\u2014strong statement that language crafts\nreality . But on the other hand, Shakespeare has Juliet say, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name? A rose by any\nother name would smell as sweet .\u201d Well, that suggests that maybe language doesn\u2019t craft\nreality .\nThese arguments have gone back and forth for thousands of years . But until recently, there\nhasn\u2019t been any data to help us decide either way . Recently, in my lab and other labs around\nthe world, we\u2019ve started doing research, and now we have actual scientific data to weigh in\non this question .\nSo let me tell you about some of my favorite examples . I\u2019ll start with an example from an\nAboriginal community in Australia that I had a chance to work with . These are the Kuuk\nThaayorre people . They live in Pormpuraaw at the very west edge of Cape York . What\u2019s\ncool about Kuuk Thaayorre is, in Kuuk Thaayorre, they don\u2019t use words like \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright,\u201d\nand instead, everything is in cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west . And when I\nsay everything, I really mean everything . You would say something like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s an ant\non your southwest leg .\u201d Or, \u201cMove your cup to the north-northeast a little bit .\u201d In fact, the\nway that you say \u201chello\u201d in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say, \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d And the\nanswer should be, \u201cNorth-northeast in the far distance . How about you?\u201d\nSo imagine as you\u2019re walking around your day, every person you greet, you have to report\nyour heading direction .\n[Laughter]\nBut that would actually get you oriented pretty fast, right? Because you literally couldn\u2019t\nget past \u201chello,\u201d if you didn\u2019t know which way you were going . In fact, people who speak\nlanguages like this stay oriented really well . They stay oriented better than we used to think\nhumans could . We used to think that humans were worse than other creatures because of\nsome biological excuse: \u201cOh, we don\u2019t have magnets in our beaks or in our scales .\u201d No; if 40 \u2022 PART 3\nyour language and your culture trains you to do it, actually, you can do it . There are humans\naround the world who stay oriented really well .\nAnd just to get us in agreement about how different this is from the way we do it, I want you\nall to close your eyes for a second and point southeast .\n[Laughter]\nKeep your eyes closed . Point . OK, so you can open your eyes . I see you guys pointing there,\nthere, there, there, there  .  .  . I don\u2019t know which way it is myself\u2014\n[Laughter]\nYou have not been a lot of help .\n[Laughter]\nSo let\u2019s just say the accuracy in this room was not very high . This is a big difference in\ncognitive ability across languages, right? Where one group\u2014very distinguished group like\nyou guys\u2014doesn\u2019t know which way is which, but in another group, I could ask a five-year-old\nand they would know .\n[Laughter]\nThere are also really big differences in how people think about time . So here I have pictures\nof my grandfather at different ages . And if I ask an English speaker to organize time, they\nmight lay it out this way, from left to right . This has to do with writing direction . If you were a\nspeaker of Hebrew or Arabic, you might do it going in the opposite direction, from right to\nleft .\nBut how would the Kuuk Thaayorre, this Aboriginal group I just told you about, do it? They\ndon\u2019t use words like \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright .\u201d Let me give you hint . When we sat people facing\nsouth, they organized time from left to right . When we sat them facing north, they organized\ntime from right to left . When we sat them facing east, time came towards the body . What\u2019s\nthe pattern? East to west, right? So for them, time doesn\u2019t actually get locked on the body at\nall, it gets locked on the landscape . So for me, if I\u2019m facing this way, then time goes this way,\nand if I\u2019m facing this way, then time goes this way . I\u2019m facing this way, time goes this way\u2014\nvery egocentric of me to have the direction of time chase me around every time I turn my\nbody . For the Kuuk Thaayorre, time is locked on the landscape . It\u2019s a dramatically different\nway of thinking about time .\nHere\u2019s another really smart human trait . Suppose I ask you how many penguins are there .\nWell, I bet I know how you\u2019d solve that problem if you solved it . You went, \u201cOne, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, eight .\u201d You counted them . You named each one with a number, and the\nlast number you said was the number of penguins . This is a little trick that you\u2019re taught to THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 41\nuse as kids . You learn the number list and you learn how to apply it . A little linguistic trick .\nWell, some languages don\u2019t do this, because some languages don\u2019t have exact number\nwords . They\u2019re languages that don\u2019t have a word like \u201cseven\u201d or a word like \u201ceight .\u201d In fact,\npeople who speak these languages don\u2019t count, and they have trouble keeping track of\nexact quantities . So, for example, if I ask you to match this number of penguins to the same\nnumber of ducks, you would be able to do that by counting . But folks who don\u2019t have that\nlinguistic trait can\u2019t do that .\nLanguages also differ in how they divide up the color spectrum\u2014the visual world . Some\nlanguages have lots of words for colors, some have only a couple words, \u201clight\u201d and \u201cdark .\u201d\nAnd languages differ in where they put boundaries between colors . So, for example, in\nEnglish, there\u2019s a word for blue that covers all of the colors that you can see on the screen,\nbut in Russian, there isn\u2019t a single word . Instead, Russian speakers have to differentiate\nbetween light blue, goluboy, and dark blue, siniy . So Russians have this lifetime of\nexperience of, in language, distinguishing these two colors . When we test people\u2019s ability\nto perceptually discriminate these colors, what we find is that Russian speakers are faster\nacross this linguistic boundary . They\u2019re faster to be able to tell the difference between a light\nand a dark blue . And when you look at people\u2019s brains as they\u2019re looking at colors\u2014say you\nhave colors shifting slowly from light to dark blue\u2014the brains of people who use different\nwords for light and dark blue will give a surprised reaction as the colors shift from light\nto dark, as if, \u201cOoh, something has categorically changed,\u201d whereas the brains of English\nspeakers, for example, that don\u2019t make this categorical distinction, don\u2019t give that surprise,\nbecause nothing is categorically changing .\nLanguages have all kinds of structural quirks . This is one of my favorites . Lots of languages\nhave grammatical gender; so every noun gets assigned a gender, often masculine or\nfeminine . And these genders differ across languages . So, for example, the sun is feminine\nin German but masculine in Spanish, and the moon, the reverse . Could this actually have\nany consequence for how people think? Do German speakers think of the sun as somehow\nmore female-like, and the moon somehow more male-like? Actually, it turns out that\u2019s the\ncase . So if you ask German and Spanish speakers to, say, describe a bridge, like the one\nhere\u2014\u201cbridge\u201d happens to be grammatically feminine in German, grammatically masculine\nin Spanish\u2014German speakers are more likely to say bridges are \u201cbeautiful,\u201d \u201celegant,\u201d and\nstereotypically feminine words . Whereas Spanish speakers will be more likely to say they\u2019re\n\u201cstrong\u201d or \u201clong,\u201d these masculine words .\n[Laughter]\nLanguages also differ in how they describe events, right? You take an event like this, an\naccident . In English, it\u2019s fine to say, \u201cHe broke the vase .\u201d In a language like Spanish, you\nmight be more likely to say, \u201cThe vase broke,\u201d or \u201cThe vase broke itself .\u201d If it\u2019s an accident, 42 \u2022 PART 3\nyou wouldn\u2019t say that someone did it . In English, quite weirdly, we can even say things like,\n\u201cI broke my arm .\u201d Now, in lots of languages, you couldn\u2019t use that construction unless you\nare a lunatic and you went out looking to break your arm\u2014[laughter] and you succeeded . If it\nwas an accident, you would use a different construction .\nNow, this has consequences . So, people who speak different languages will pay attention\nto different things, depending on what their language usually requires them to do . So we\nshow the same accident to English speakers and Spanish speakers, English speakers\nwill remember who did it, because English requires you to say, \u201cHe did it; he broke the\nvase .\u201d Whereas Spanish speakers might be less likely to remember who did it if it\u2019s an\naccident, but they\u2019re more likely to remember that it was an accident . They\u2019re more likely\nto remember the intention . So, two people watch the same event, witness the same crime,\nbut end up remembering different things about that event . This has implications, of course,\nfor eyewitness testimony . It also has implications for blame and punishment . So if you take\nEnglish speakers and I just show you someone breaking a vase, and I say, \u201cHe broke the\nvase,\u201d as opposed to \u201cThe vase broke,\u201d even though you can witness it yourself, you can\nwatch the video, you can watch the crime against the vase, you will punish someone more,\nyou will blame someone more if I just said, \u201cHe broke it,\u201d as opposed to, \u201cIt broke .\u201d The\nlanguage guides our reasoning about events .\nNow, I\u2019ve given you a few examples of how language can profoundly shape the way we\nthink, and it does so in a variety of ways . So language can have big effects, like we saw with\nspace and time, where people can lay out space and time in completely different coordinate\nframes from each other . Language can also have really deep effects\u2014that\u2019s what we saw\nwith the case of number . Having count words in your language, having number words, opens\nup the whole world of mathematics . Of course, if you don\u2019t count, you can\u2019t do algebra,\nyou can\u2019t do any of the things that would be required to build a room like this or make this\nbroadcast, right? This little trick of number words gives you a stepping stone into a whole\ncognitive realm .\nLanguage can also have really early effects, what we saw in the case of color . These are\nreally simple, basic, perceptual decisions . We make thousands of them all the time, and yet,\nlanguage is getting in there and fussing even with these tiny little perceptual decisions that\nwe make . Language can have really broad effects . So the case of grammatical gender may\nbe a little silly, but at the same time, grammatical gender applies to all nouns . That means\nlanguage can shape how you\u2019re thinking about anything that can be named by a noun .\nThat\u2019s a lot of stuff .\nAnd finally, I gave you an example of how language can shape things that have personal\nweight to us\u2014ideas like blame and punishment or eyewitness memory . These are important\nthings in our daily lives . THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 43\nNow, the beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how\nflexible the human mind is . Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but\n7,000\u2014there are 7,000 languages spoken around the world . And we can create many\nmore\u2014languages, of course, are living things, things that we can hone and change to suit\nour needs . The tragic thing is that we\u2019re losing so much of this linguistic diversity all the\ntime . We\u2019re losing about one language a week, and by some estimates, half of the world\u2019s\nlanguages will be gone in the next hundred years . And the even worse news is that right\nnow, almost everything we know about the human mind and human brain is based on\nstudies of usually American English-speaking undergraduates at universities . That excludes\nalmost all humans . Right? So what we know about the human mind is actually incredibly\nnarrow and biased, and our science has to do better .\nI want to leave you with this final thought . I\u2019ve told you about how speakers of different\nlanguages think differently, but of course, that\u2019s not about how people elsewhere think . It\u2019s\nabout how you think . It\u2019s how the language that you speak shapes the way that you think .\nAnd that gives you the opportunity to ask, \u201cWhy do I think the way that I do?\u201d \u201cHow could I\nthink differently?\u201d And also, \u201cWhat thoughts do I wish to create?\u201d\nThank you very much .\n[Applause]\nRead the following text on what lexical differences between language can tell us about those\nlanguages\u2019 cultures.\n3.2 Lexical Differences Among Languages\n3.2.1 Some Reasons Languages Differ Lexically\nSo far we have endowed our Lexies with an amazing capacity, one that to date has only been\nfound among human beings. Over the generations, they can now invent a very large store of\nlabels for individuals and categories of things in the world (even categories of things not in the\nworld). And, equally important, they can pass on this store of labels to their children.\nNow let\u2019s imagine various tribes of Lexies in different parts of the world with no contact with\neach other. Each tribe will experience a different environment, containing its own potentially\nunique set of animals and plants and its own climate and geology. Each tribe will invent words\nfor the things in its environment that matter to it, and we will naturally expect to find words for\ndifferent things in each tribe. Modern languages also differ from each other in this way. Amharic\nhas a word for hippopotamus because hippopotamuses are found in Ethiopia, but Inuktitut does\nnot because hippopotamuses are not found (normally) in northern Canada. 44 \u2022 PART 3\nWe can also expect the cultures of the different tribes of Lexies to differ. This will result in several\ndifferences in their store of words. First, certain naturally occurring things will become more\nimportant. A tribe that makes pots out of clay will want a word for clay; another tribe may not\nbother. Second, as culture develops, there will be more and more cultural artifacts, that is, objects\nproduced by the members of the culture. Naturally the tribe will want words for these as well,\nand if they are not producing them, they will not have such words. Finally, culture results in\nabstractions, concepts that do not represent (physical) things in the world at all: political units,\nsocial relationships, rituals, laws, and unseen forces. These will vary a great deal in their details\nfrom tribe to tribe, and we can expect these differences to be reflected in the words that each\ntribe comes up with.\nCulture and Nouns\nModern languages also differ from each other in these ways. Amharic has the word agelgil\nmeaning a leather-covered basket that Ethiopians used traditionally to carry prepared food when\nthey traveled. Other languages don\u2019t have a word for this concept. English now has the word nerd\nto refer to a particular kind of person who is fascinated with technology and lacking in social\nskills. This is a relatively new concept, specific to certain cultures, and there is probably no word\nfor it in most languages.\n3.2.2 Differences Within and Among Languages\nEXERCISE: Languages such as English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese have many\nspecialized terms for computers and their use, whereas many other languages, such as\nTzeltal and Inuktitut, do not. Does this represent some kind of fundamental limitation of these\nlanguages?\nFinally, we can also expect the store of words to vary among the individuals within each tribe.\nAs culture progresses, experts emerge, people who specialize in agriculture or pottery or music\nor religion. Each of these groups will invent words that are not known to everyone in the tribe.\nModern languages also have this property. A carpenter knows what a hasp is; I have no idea. I\nknow what a morpheme is because I\u2019m a linguist, but I don\u2019t expect most English speakers to\nknow this.\nThis brings up an important distinction, that between the words that a language has and the\nwords that an individual speaker of the language knows. Because some speakers of languages such\nas Mandarin Chinese, English, Spanish, and Japanese have traveled all over the world and studied\nthe physical environments as well as the cultures they have found, these languages have words\nfor concepts such as hippopotamus and polygamy, concepts that are not part of the everyday\nlife of speakers of these languages. Thus it is almost certainly true that Mandarin Chinese,\nEnglish, Spanish, and Japanese have more words than Amharic, Tzeltal, Lingala, and Inuktitut. THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 45\nBut this fact is of little interest to linguists and other language scientists, who, if you remember,\nare concerned with what individual people know about their language (and sometimes other\nlanguages) and how they use this knowledge. There is no evidence that individual speakers of\nEnglish or Japanese know any more words than individual speakers of Amharic or Tzeltal.\nWhere New Words Come From\nFurthermore, if a language is lacking a word for a particular concept, it is a simple matter for the\nspeakers of the language to add a new word when they become familiar with the concept. One\nway for this to happen is through semantic extension of an existing word; we saw this earlier\nwith mouse in English. Another way is to create a new word out of combinations of old words\nor pieces of old words; we will see how this works in in Chapter 5 and Chapter 8. A third, very\ncommon, way is to simply borrow the word from another language. Thus English speakers\nborrowed the word algebra from Arabic; Japanese speakers borrowed their word for \u201cbread,\u201d pan,\nfrom Portuguese; Amharic speakers borrowed their word for \u201cautomobile,\u201d mekina, from Italian;\nand Lingala speakers borrowed their word for \u201cchair,\u201d kiti, from Swahili.\n3.2.3 Lexical Domains: Personal Pronouns\nWhat are the differences between the personal pronouns you and you guys? (There are at least\ntwo differences.)\nMore interesting than isolated differences in the words that are available in different languages is\nhow the concepts within a particular domain are conveyed in different languages. We\u2019ll consider\ntwo examples here, personal pronouns and nouns for kinship relations; we\u2019ll look at others later\non when we discuss words for relations.\nA complete set of personal pronouns in my dialect of English includes the following: I, me, you,\nshe, her, he, him, it, we, us, you guys, they, them. Note that I\u2019m writing you guys as two words, but\nin most important ways it behaves like one word. For our present purposes, we can ignore the\nfollowing group: me, her, him, us, them; we\u2019re not really ready to discuss how they differ from\nthe others. Among the ones that are left, let\u2019s consider how they differ from each other. We have\nalready seen how they differ with respect to person: I and we are first person; you and you guys\nare second person; she, he, it, and they are third person. We can view person as a dimension, a\nkind of scale along which concepts can vary. Each concept that varies along the dimension has a\nvalue for that dimension. The person dimension has only three possible values, first, second, and\nthird, and each personal pronoun has one of these values.\nPerson is not just a conceptual dimension; it is a semantic dimension because the different\nvalues are reflected in different linguistic forms. That is, like words, semantic dimensions have\nboth form and meaning. When we speak of \u201cperson,\u201d we may be talking about form, for example, 46 \u2022 PART 3\nthe difference between the word forms I and you, about meaning, for example, the difference\nbetween Speaker and Hearer, or about the association between form and meaning.\nBut person alone is not enough to account for all of the differences among the pronouns.\nIt does not distinguish I from we, for example. These two words differ on another semantic\ndimension, number. I is singular: it refers to an individual. We is plural: it refers to more than\none individual. What values are possible on the number dimension? Of course languages have\nwords for all of the different numbers, but within the personal pronouns, there seem to be\nonly the following possibilities: singular, dual (two individuals), trial (three individuals), and\nplural (unspecified multiple individuals). Of these trial is very rare, and, among our set of nine\nlanguages, dual is used only in Inuktitut. Thus Inuktitut has three first person pronouns, uvanga\n\u201cI,\u201d uvaguk \u201cwe (two people),\u201d uvagut \u201cwe (more than two people).\u201d\nGiven the two dimensions of person and number, we can divide up the English personal\npronouns as shown in the table below. The third person pronouns fall into the singular group of\nthree, she, he, and it, and the single plural pronoun they. The second person is more complicated.\nIn relatively formal speech and writing, we use you for both singular and plural, but informally,\nat least in my dialect, we may also use you guys for the plural. (Note that other English dialects\nhave other second person plural pronouns, you all\/y\u2019all, yunz, etc.) Thus we need to include both\nyou and you guys in the plural column.\nSingular Plural\n1 person I we\n2 person you you, you guys\n3 person she, he, it they\nClearly, we need more dimensions to distinguish the words since two of the cells in our table\ncontain more than one word. Among the third person singular pronouns, the remaining\ndifference has to do with gender, whether the referent is being viewed as male, female, or neither.\nInstead of male and female, I will use the conventional linguistic terms masculine and feminine\nto emphasize that we are dealing with linguistic categories rather than biological categories\nin the world, and for the third value I will use neuter. Thus, there are three possible values on\nthe gender dimension for English, and three seems to be all that is needed for other languages,\nthough some languages have a dimension similar to gender that has many more values.\nThat leaves the distinction between you and you guys in the plural. As we have already seen, this\nis related to formality, another semantic dimension and a very complicated one. I will have little\nto say about it here, except that it is related to the larger context (not just the utterance context)\nand to the relationship between the Speaker and Hearer. For example, language is likely to be\nrelatively formal in the context of a public speech or when people talk to their employers. For THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 47\nnow, let\u2019s assume that the formality dimension has only two values, informal and formal. The\ntable below shows the breakdown of the English personal pronouns along the four dimensions of\nperson, number, gender, and formality.\nSingular Plural\n1 person I we\n2 person you formal informal\nyou you guys\n3 person feminine masculine neuter they\nshe he it\nGaps in Pronoun Systems\nNotice that there seem to be gaps in the English system. There is a word for third person singular\nfeminine, but no word for second person singular feminine, and formality is only relevant\nfor second person plural. Because there is no masculine or feminine you in English, we can\nsay that you is unspecified for the gender dimension. As we will see many times in the book,\nlanguages tend to be systematic\u2014if they make a distinction somewhere, they tend to make that\ndistinction elsewhere\u2014but they are not always so. English personal pronouns are systematic in\none important way: the distinction between first, second, and third person is maintained in both\nsingular and plural. But they are not in other ways, as we have just seen.\nYou will probably not be surprised to learn that there is nothing special about the English\nsystem; other languages organize things somewhat differently, though it seems that person and\nnumber are relevant for all languages. Here is the set of Amharic personal pronouns.\nSingular Plural\n1 person in\u00e9 innya\n2 person plain respect innante\nfeminine masculine irswo\nan\u010di ante\n3 person plain respect innessu\nfeminine masculine issaccew\nisswa issu\nNotice that Amharic fills some of the apparent gaps that English has; for example, there is both\na masculine and a feminine second person singular pronoun, while English only makes the\ngender distinction in third person. But Amharic is unsystematic in some ways too; while gender 48 \u2022 PART 3\nis relevant for singular pronouns, it is not for plural pronouns, and, as in English, it doesn\u2019t enter\ninto first person at all. Notice also that there is a new dimension, respect, that is relevant for\nAmharic pronouns, at least in second and third person singular. Respect is similar to formality,\nbut it relates specifically to the attitude that the Speaker wants to convey toward the referent,\nthat is, the Hearer in the case of second person and another person in the case of third person.\nIn Amharic, there are two values for this dimension, plain and respectful. Finally, notice that\nwhile English has three values for gender, Amharic has only two, masculine and feminine. This\nmeans that one or the other of these must make do to refer to things that are neither male nor\nfemale. Many languages have only two genders, and each of these languages has its own way of\ndetermining which gender is appropriate for things that don\u2019t have \u201cnatural\u201d gender.\nWe have seen only two examples of personal pronoun systems. Other languages have quite\ndifferent systems, some making use of dimensions that are not relevant for English or\nAmharic, some ignoring dimensions that matter for English and Amharic. For example, in\nmany languages, including Tzeltal and Inuktitut, gender plays no role at all in the personal\npronoun systems: there is no distinction like that between he and she. It is not clear why\npronoun systems vary the way they do. For example, it would be wrong to assume that Tzeltal\npronouns lack gender because Tzeltal speakers are less conscious of gender in the world or that\nchildren learning Tzeltal become less sensitive to gender differences than children learning\nEnglish or Amharic or Spanish. At least there is no evidence for these kinds of relationships.\nThe relationship between language and thought has been most often studied in the context of\ngrammar, and since we are looking at personal pronouns, we are getting pretty close to grammar,\nbut we will save this topic for later.\n3.2.4 Lexical Domains: Kinship Terms\nWhat do the meanings of the words father and uncle have in common? What sort of dimension\nwould you need to distinguish the meanings of these words?\nNow let\u2019s look at the words we use to refer to kinship relations. We won\u2019t consider all of the\nwords in a given language, just some of the basic ones. Let\u2019s start by taking two similar words and\ntrying to figure out what dimension distinguishes their meanings, say brother and sister. This is\neasy since we\u2019ve already been discussing this dimension; it\u2019s gender.\nBut gender won\u2019t help us with the distinction between daughter and mother since both are\nfemale. For these words we have to consider their relationship to the person who provides the\nreference point for the relationship, what cultural anthropologists (the experts on this topic)\ncall ego. In both cases, there is a direct relationship (what anthropologists call lineal), but in\none case the relationship goes in one direction (back into the past); in the other, it goes in the\nopposite direction (forward into the future). Let\u2019s call this dimension \u201cvertical separation from THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 49\nego.\u201d We can use positive and negative numbers to represent values on this dimension. In the\ncase of mother, the separation is \u20131 (one generation back); in the case of daughter, it is +1 (one\ngeneration forward).\nBut these two dimensions won\u2019t suffice to distinguish all basic English kinship terms. What about\nmother and aunt? Both are female, and both are separated by \u20131 from ego. What distinguishes\nthese two relations is the closeness of the relationship to ego. For mother, the person is in a lineal\nrelation to ego. For aunt, we need to go back another generation, to ego\u2019s grandparents, to find\na common ancestor. We will call this dimension \u201chorizontal distance from ego\u201d and represent it\nagain with a number (but no sign). For mother, we will say the distance is 0; for aunt (and cousin\nand niece), it is 1. Here is a list of some English kinship terms with their values on the three\ndimensions. If a cell is left blank, the dimension is unspecified for that term.\nVertical Horizontal Gender\nmother \u20131 0 feminine\ndaughter +1 0 feminine\nsister 0 1 feminine\naunt \u20131 1 feminine\nparent \u20131 0\ngrandchild +2 0\nniece +1 1 feminine\ncousin 0 2\nNot All Languages Have \u201cAunts\u201d and \u201cUncles\u201d\nNow let\u2019s look at some of the terms that Lingala speakers use for kinship terms. Some of these\nare just like English, but others require different dimensions than are required for English.\nLingala speakers use different words for siblings that are older or younger than ego and for aunts\nand uncles that are older or younger than their parents, but they don\u2019t normally distinguish\nsiblings or aunts and uncles by gender. We\u2019ll refer to this as the \u201crelative age\u201d dimension. Lingala\nspeakers also distinguish maternal and paternal aunts and uncles; we\u2019ll call this the \u201cparent path\u201d\ndimension. Finally, Lingala speakers use the same words for grandparents and grandchildren;\nthat is, at least some of the time they are concerned only with vertical distance, not vertical\ndirection (earlier or later). The table below shows values on the kinship dimensions for some\nLingala kinship terms. 50 \u2022 PART 3\nVertical Horizontal Gender Parent Path Age\nmama \u20131 0 feminine maternal\n\u201cmother\u201d\ntata \u20131 0 masculine paternal\n\u201cfather\u201d\nnkoko 2 (+\/\u2013) 0\n\u201cgrandparent\/\ngrandchild\u201d\nnkulutu 0 1 older\n\u201colder sibling\u201d\nleki 0 1 younger\n\u201cyounger sibling\u201d\nmama-nkulutu \u20131 1 maternal older\n\u201colder sibling\nof mother\u201d\ntata-leki \u20131 1 paternal younger\n\u201cyounger sibling\nof father\u201d\nDifferences in kinship terms are more likely to be related to culture than differences in personal\npronouns. That is, when a single term (such as Lingala nkulutu \u201colder sibling\u201d) groups different\nrelatives together, we might expect that in the culture where the language is spoken, those\nrelatives are treated similarly by ego. (I don\u2019t know whether this is the case for Lingala speakers,\nhowever.) Words refer to categories, after all, and categories are a way in which people group\nthe things in the world. Children growing up in a particular culture are learning the cultural\nconcepts and the words simultaneously. Their experience with the culture should help them\nlearn the words referring to cultural concepts, and their exposure to the words should help them\nlearn the concepts. But little is actually known about how this sort of interaction works. In the\nnext section we\u2019ll consider the learning of the meanings of apparently simpler nouns, those\nreferring to physical objects. Even here we\u2019ll discover that there is considerable disagreement on\nhow babies manage to master the words.\n3.2 Adapted from Lexical Differences Among Languages (Gasser, 2015) THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 51\nWatch this brief video on the translation challenges associated with the pronoun \u201cyou.\u201d\nWatch the video: One of the Most Difficult Words to Translate . . . (Krystian Aparta, 2016)\nVideo transcript:\nWhich is the hardest word to translate in this sentence?\nDo you know where the pep rally is?\n\u201cKnow\u201d is easy to translate . \u201cPep rally\u201d doesn\u2019t have a direct analog in a lot of languages and\ncultures, but can be approximated . But the hardest word there is actually one of the smallest:\n\u201cyou .\u201d As simple as it seems, it\u2019s often impossible to accurately translate \u201cyou\u201d without\nknowing a lot more about the situation where it\u2019s being said . To start with, how familiar are\nyou with the person you\u2019re talking to? Many cultures have different levels of formality . A\nclose friend, someone much older or much younger, a stranger, a boss . These all may be\nslightly different \u201cyou\u2019s .\u201d\nIn many languages, the pronoun reflects these differences through what\u2019s known as the\nT\u2013V distinction . In French, for example, you would say \u201ctu\u201d when talking to your friend at\nschool, but \u201cvous\u201d when addressing your teacher . Even English once had something similar .\nRemember the old-timey \u201cthou?\u201d Ironically, it was actually the informal pronoun for people\nyou\u2019re close with, while \u201cyou\u201d was the formal and polite version . That distinction was lost\nwhen the English decided to just be polite all the time .\nBut the difficulty in translating \u201cyou\u201d doesn\u2019t end there . In languages like Hausa or Korana,\nthe \u201cyou\u201d form depends on the listener\u2019s gender . In many more, it depends on whether\nthey are one or many, such as with German \u201cdu\u201d or \u201cihr .\u201d Even in English, some dialects use\nwords like \u201cy\u2019all\u201d or \u201cyouse\u201d the same way . Some plural forms, like the French \u201cvous\u201d and\nRussian \u201c\u0412\u044b\u201d are also used for a single person to show that the addressee is that much\nmore important, much like the royal \u201cwe .\u201d And a few languages even have a specific form for\naddressing exactly two people, like Slovenian \u201cvidva .\u201d\nIf that wasn\u2019t complicated enough, formality, number, and gender can all come into play at\nthe same time . In Spanish, \u201ct\u00fa\u201d is unisex informal singular, \u201custed\u201d is unisex formal singular,\n\u201cvosotros\u201d is masculine informal plural, \u201cvosotras\u201d is feminine informal plural, and \u201custedes\u201d\nis the unisex formal plural . Phew! After all that, it may come as a relief that some languages\noften leave out the second person pronoun . In languages like Romanian and Portuguese, the\npronoun can be dropped from sentences because it\u2019s clearly implied by the way the verbs\nare conjugated . And in languages like Korean, Thai, and Chinese, pronouns can be dropped\nwithout any grammatical hints . Speakers often would rather have the listener guess the\npronoun from context than use the wrong one and risk being seen as rude . 52 \u2022 PART 3\nSo if you\u2019re ever working as a translator and come across this sentence without any\ncontext: \u201cYou and you, no, not you, you, your job is to translate \u2018you\u2019 for yourselves\u201d  .  .  .

Circle = female, triangle = male. Relatives\nmarked with the same non-gray color are called by the same kinship term (ignoring sex-\ndifferentiation in the sibling\/cousin generation, except where this becomes structurally\nrelevant under the Crow and Omaha systems).\nNote that in some versions of the Crow and Omaha systems, the relatives shown as \u201ccousin\u201d\nin the Crow and Omaha boxes of the chart are actually referred to as either \u201cson\/daughter\u201d\nor \u201cnephew\/niece\u201d (different terms are used by male ego vs. female ego). Also, in some\nlanguages with an Iroquois type of system, the relatives shown as \u201ccousin\u201d on the chart are\nreferred to by the same terms used for \u201csister-in-law\u201d\/\u201dbrother-in-law\u201d (since such cross-\ncousins\u2014including remote classificatory cross-cousins\u2014are preferred marriage partners).\nSimilarly, the term for father\u2019s sister can be the same as that for mother-in-law, and the term for\nmother\u2019s brother the same as father-in-law.\nThe terms used for ego\u2019s generation (i.e., the sibling\/cousin generation) are usually considered\ncritical for classifying a language\u2019s kinship terms (some languages show discrepancies\nbetween ego\u2019s generation patterns and first-ascending generation patterns). In anthropological\nterminology, the basic first-ascending generation patterns are actually called \u201cgenerational\u201d\n(shown in Hawaiian box), \u201clineal\u201d (shown in Eskimo box), \u201cbifurcate collateral\u201d (shown in\nSudanese box), and \u201cbifurcate merging\u201d (shown in the Iroquois, Crow, and Omaha boxes).\n3.3 Are You Familiar with Memes?\nThis week\u2019s discussion board will be a fun, practical activity\nrequiring you to connect the concepts we have been\nlearning to an Internet phenomenon.\nEXERCISE:\nA.

(Let\u2019sTalkLanguage, 2015)\nVideo transcript:\nThe chicken or the egg? Which one came first? This question has puzzled humanity for a\nlong time . Linguists ask themselves a similar question . Do we think before we speak, or do\nwe need language to shape our thoughts?\nTwo famous linguists have worked on what is called linguistic relativity . Edward Sapir and\nBenjamin Whorf have separately worked on this problem and came to the conclusion\nthat the structure of one\u2019s language affects the way in which we perceive the world . Our\nworldviews shape the linguistic structures of our respective languages, influencing thoughts\nand modeling linguistic behavior .\nWhether linguistic relativity exists or not has been and still is heavily disputed amongst\nlinguists . At the beginning of the 20th century in the early stages of linguistic relativity, Sapir\nand Whorf looked for clues to find out whether language determines thought or thoughts\ndetermine language . Around 1960 when the Universalist Theory of Language became\npopular, the relativity theory was heavily criticized since Universalists believed linguistic\nstructures to be innate and all cognitive processes to be universal in human beings and\ntherefore not influenceable by language .\nWhorf\u2019s most famous argument in favor of linguistic relativity was what he believed to\nbe a major difference in the concept of time in Hopi languages compared to English . He\nclaimed that Hopi speakers do not have the same temporal units, and therefore their culture\nwas fundamentally different in its respect to ours . Of course this theory was disputed by\nUniversalists . Their studies demonstrated that Hopi had different concepts of time than what THE ETHNOLINGUISTIC PERSPECTIVE \u2022 55\nWhorf had believed them to be and claimed that Whorf did not understand Hopi languages\nwell enough .\nOther relativists however countered, arguing that universalist misinterpreted Whorf\u2019s work\nand tried to force Hopi grammar into models that were not fit for the structure of the Hopi\nlanguage . In the 60s, a study was set up to discredit the relativistic approach . At that time\nit was believed there was no specific rule which determined between how many different\ncolors a language would differentiate . Rather, differences were attributed to the culture in\nwhich languages were spoken .\nBerlin and Kay examined the color terminology of different languages and found Universalist\ntrends even though languages have different color terms certain hues are seen as more\nfocal than others . Also, the choices of colors are not arbitrary . Instead there appears to\nbe a hierarchy of colors . A language which recognizes the color blue also recognizes the\ncolors black, white, red, green, and yellow, but not necessarily brown or pink . If speakers\ndon\u2019t recognize the colors green or yellow, the only colors that speakers of this language\ncategorize are either black and white only or black, white, and red . These observations were\nseen as a powerful argument for the Universalist theory .\nIn the view of John Lucy, a relativist, is the word of Berlin and Kay had methodological\nshortcomings and was biased by the Western point of view . He conducted a different kind\nof experiment . He compared Mayan Yucatec and English grammars . He showed speakers of\neach language single objects and afterwards two different objects: one with the same shape\nbut different material and the other one in the same material but differently shaped .\nWhich one of the two objects is more similar to the first one? English speakers tended to\nchoose the object with the same shape, whereas Yucatec speakers or the material of the\nobject as a more decisive factor . But why was there such a difference? Mayan Yucatec uses\nso-called classifiers, a specific linguistic device to categorize different nouns by shape . In his\nexperiment, however, the questions were asked in a way that such classifiers did not apply .\nThe objects were shapeless to the Yucatec speakers .\nRecently, relativist studies have focused on bi- and multilinguals\u2014people who speak two\nor more languages\u2014to test the possibility of language shaping thought . But why bilinguals\nin particular? If different language has changed the way we think and perceive the world,\nbilinguals who speak two languages might think differently when language A is activated\ncompared to when language B is active .\nIf we go back to the prior example of shape versus interior, how would a person who is\nbrought up speaking both English and Mayan Yucatec answer the question, \u201cWhich object\nis more similar to the first one?\u201d Linguists have found differences in the language use of 56 \u2022 PART 3\nmonolinguals and bilinguals when describing colors, motion, time or space, but why is that?\nAren\u2019t bilinguals supposed to speak either language like a native speaker?\nIt is not that easy . One theory claims that language systems which are storing our minds are\nnot entirely separated from each other . They overlap . Instead of the two languages being\nindependent from each other, they are interconnected and share certain features . This\nphenomenon is called merging . If two or more language systems merge, it is possible that\ncertain features in one language are dropped in favor of features of the other language .\nMerging of language systems has, for example, been found in semantics of Russian English\nspeakers as well as in French speakers . Also, definitions of certain words and phrases can\nbe broadened or limited . This is what linguists call boundary shifting, which will be shown\nwith the following example:\nA particular study on color perception in 2010 examined the change in the perception\nof the color blue in Greek speakers . English has one concept for blue . Greek has two:\none describing light blue and the other one describing a dark blue . Two groups of Greek\nspeakers were formed . Participants in the first group had lived in an English-speaking\ncountry for a much longer time than participants in the second group . The question was,\nwould their perception of color differ from each other?\nIt did!\nGreeks who had had a longer exposure to the English language learned to separate when\nit came to distinguishing the two types of blue they knew from their first language . So had\nEnglish influenced their view of the world so that they did not see colors in the way they had\nbefore?\nDo we think before we speak? Or do we need language to shape our thoughts? Is language\nin its structure already innate and does not influence our thoughts, or is it true that even\nthough we are able to understand how others think we are not able to actually think in that\nway because our languages are different? What is your opinion? Do we think before we\nspeak, or do we need language to shape our thoughts? PART 4 Language, Worldviews, and\nIntercultural Communication\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this module, students will be able to:\n1. Identify and illustrate the specificities and challenges of intercultural communication\n2. Analyze instances of cultural misunderstandings from an intercultural perspective\n3. Define high- and low-context cultures\n4. Explain how different understandings of politeness can shape intercultural\ncommunication and foster cultural misunderstandings\nIf you were to ask Russel Arent, author of Bridging the Cultural Gap, he would tell you that,\n\u201cIntercultural communication is the sending and receiving of messages across languages and\ncultures. It is also a negotiated understanding of meaning in human experiences across social\nsystems and societies.\u201d This provides not only a concise definition but it also describes the\nimportance that understanding has in intercultural interactions.\nIn this TedTalkX, Pellegrino Riccardi, a man who spent 27 years traveling the world to\nexperience different cultures, refers to culture as, \u201cA system of behavior that helps us act in an\naccepted or familiar way.\u201d\nCross cultural communication | Pellegrino Riccardi | TEDxBergen\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YMyofREc5Jk\nIntercultural communication is often used interchangeably with cross-cultural communication.\n4.1 Intercultural Communication: A Dialectical Approach\nIntercultural communication is complicated, messy, and at times contradictory. Therefore, it is\nnot always easy to conceptualize or study. Taking a dialectical approach allows us to capture the\ndynamism of intercultural communication. A dialectic is a relationship between two opposing\nconcepts that constantly push and pull one another (Intercultural Communication 73). To put it\nanother way, thinking dialectically helps us realize that our experiences often occur in between\ntwo different phenomena. This perspective is especially useful for interpersonal and intercultural\ncommunication, because when we think dialectically, we think relationally. This means we\n57 58 \u2022 PART 4\nFIGURE 4.1. Dialectics of Intercultural\nCommunication. (Adapted from Martin, Judith\nCultural Individual\nN., and Thomas K. Nakayama. \u201cThinking\nDialectically about Culture and Communication.\u201d\nCommunication Theory, vol. 9, no. 1, 1999,\npp. 1-25.)\nPersonal Contextual\nlook at the relationship between aspects of\nintercultural communication rather than\nviewing them in isolation. Intercultural\nDifferences Similarities\ncommunication occurs as a dynamic in-\nbetweenness that, while connected to the\nindividuals in an encounter, goes beyond the\nStatic Dynamic\nindividuals, creating something unique.\nHolding a dialectical perspective may\nbe challenging for some Westerners, History\/Past Present\/Future\nas it asks us to hold two contradictory\nideas simultaneously, which goes against\nmuch of what we are taught in our Privilege Disadvantage\nformal education. Thinking dialectically\nhelps us see the complexity in culture and identity because it doesn\u2019t allow for dichotomies.\nDichotomies are dualistic ways of thinking that highlight opposites, reducing the ability to\nsee gradations that exist in between concepts. Dichotomies such as good\/evil, wrong\/right,\nobjective\/subjective, male\/female, in-group\/out-group, black\/white, and so on, form the basis\nof much of our thoughts on ethics, culture, and general philosophy, but this isn\u2019t the only\nway of thinking (\u201cThinking Dialectically\u201d 14). Many Eastern cultures acknowledge that the\nworld isn\u2019t dualistic. Rather, they accept as part of their reality that things that seem opposite\nare actually interdependent and complement each other. I argue that a dialectical approach is\nuseful in studying intercultural communication because it gets us out of our comfortable and\nfamiliar ways of thinking. Since so much of understanding culture and identity is understanding\nourselves, having an unfamiliar lens through which to view culture can offer us insights that our\nfamiliar lenses will not. Specifically, we can better understand intercultural communication by\nexamining six dialectics (see Figure 4.1, Dialectics of Intercultural Communication).\nFor the purpose of this course, we will focus on the first four dichotomies.\nThe cultural-individual dialectic captures the interplay between patterned behaviors learned\nfrom a cultural group and individual behaviors that may be variations on or counter to those of the\nlarger culture. This dialectic is useful because it helps us account for exceptions to cultural norms.\nFor example, earlier we learned that the United States is said to be a low-context culture, which\nmeans that we value verbal communication as our primary, meaning-rich form of communication.\nConversely, Japan is said to be a high-context culture, which means they often look for nonverbal LANGUAGE, WORLDVIEWS, AND INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION \u2022 59\nclues like tone, silence, or what is not said for meaning. However, you can find people in the\nUnited States who intentionally put much meaning into how they say things, perhaps because\nthey are not as comfortable speaking directly what\u2019s on their mind. We often do this in situations\nwhere we may hurt someone\u2019s feelings or damage a relationship. Does that mean we come from a\nhigh-context culture? Does the Japanese man who speaks more than is socially acceptable come\nfrom a low-context culture? The answer to both questions is no. Neither the behaviors of a small\npercentage of individuals nor occasional situational choices constitute a cultural pattern.\nThe personal-contextual dialectic highlights the connection between our personal patterns of\nand preferences for communicating and how various contexts influence the personal. In some\ncases, our communication patterns and preferences will stay the same across many contexts. In\nother cases, a context shift may lead us to alter our communication and adapt. For example, an\nAmerican businesswoman may prefer to communicate with her employees in an informal and\nlaid-back manner. When she is promoted to manage a department in her company\u2019s office in\nMalaysia, she may again prefer to communicate with her new Malaysian employees the same\nway she did with those in the United States. In the United States, we know that there are some\naccepted norms that communication in work contexts is more formal than in personal contexts.\nHowever, we also know that individual managers often adapt these expectations to suit their own\npersonal tastes. This type of managerial discretion would likely not go over as well in Malaysia\nwhere there is a greater emphasis put on power distance (Hofstede 26). So while the American\nmanager may not know to adapt to the new context unless she has a high degree of intercultural\ncommunication competence, Malaysian managers would realize that this is an instance where\nthe context likely influences communication more than personal preferences.\nThe differences-similarities dialectic allows us to examine how we are simultaneously similar\nto and different from others. As was noted earlier, it\u2019s easy to fall into a view of intercultural\ncommunication as \u201cother oriented\u201d and set up dichotomies between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d When we\noverfocus on differences, we can end up polarizing groups that actually have things in common.\nWhen we overfocus on similarities, we essentialize, or reduce\/overlook important variations\nwithin a group. This tendency is evident in most of the popular, and some of the academic,\nconversations regarding \u201cgender differences.\u201d The book Men Are from Mars, Women Are from\nVenus makes it seem like men and women aren\u2019t even species that hail from the same planet.\nThe media is quick to include a blurb from a research study indicating again how men and\nwomen are \u201cwired\u201d to communicate differently. However, the overwhelming majority of current\nresearch on gender and communication finds that while there are differences between how men\nand women communicate, there are far more similarities (Allen 55). Even the language we use\nto describe the genders sets up dichotomies. That\u2019s why I suggest that my students use the term\nother gender instead of the commonly used opposite sex. I have a mom, a sister, and plenty of\nfemale friends, and I don\u2019t feel like any of them are the opposite of me. Perhaps a better title for a\nbook would be Women and Men Are Both from Earth. 60 \u2022 PART 4\nThe static-dynamic dialectic suggests that culture and communication change over time yet\noften appear to be and are experienced as stable. Although it is true that our cultural beliefs and\npractices are rooted in the past, we have already discussed how cultural categories that most\nof us assume to be stable, like race and gender, have changed dramatically in just the past fifty\nyears. Some cultural values remain relatively consistent over time, which allows us to make some\ngeneralizations about a culture. For example, cultures have different orientations to time. The\nChinese have a longer-term orientation to time than do Europeans (Lustig and Koester 128-29).\nThis is evidenced in something that dates back as far as astrology. The Chinese zodiac is done\nannually (The Year of the Monkey, etc.), while European astrology was organized by month\n(Taurus, etc.). While this cultural orientation to time has been around for generations, as China\nbecomes more Westernized in terms of technology, business, and commerce, it could also adopt\nsome views on time that are more short term.\n4.1 Adapted from \u201cIntercultural Communication\u201d (A Primer on Communication Studies, 2012)\n4.2 Important Concepts for Understanding\nIntercultural Communication\nIf you decide to take a class on intercultural communication you will learn a great deal about\nthe similarities and differences across cultural groups. Since this chapter is meant to give you\nan overview or taste of this exciting field of study, we will discuss four important concepts for\nunderstanding communication practices among cultures.\n4.2.1 High and Low Context\nThink about someone you are very close to\u2014a best friend, romantic partner, or sibling. Have\nthere been times when you began a sentence and the other person knew exactly what you were\ngoing to say before you said it? For example, in a situation between two sisters, one sister might\nexclaim, \u201cGet off!\u201d (which is short for \u201cget off my wavelength\u201d). This phenomenon of being\non someone\u2019s wavelength is similar to what Hall describes as high context. In high-context\ncommunication, the meaning is in the people, or more specifically, the relationship between the\npeople as opposed to just the words. Low-context communication occurs when we have to rely\non the translation of the words to decipher a person\u2019s meaning. The American legal system, for\nexample, relies on low-context communication.\nWhile some cultures are low or high context, in general terms, there can also be individual or\ncontextual differences within cultures. In the example above between the two sisters, they are\nusing high-context communication; however, America is considered a low-context culture. LANGUAGE, WORLDVIEWS, AND INTERCULTURAL COMMUNICATION \u2022 61\nCountries such as Germany and Sweden are also low context while Japan and China are high\ncontext.\n4.2 and 4.2.1 Adapted from Understanding Intercultural Communication\n(Department of Communication, Indiana State University, 2016)\n4.2.2 Speech Styles\nOther variations in communication can be described using Gudykunst and Ting-Toomey\u2019s\nfour communication styles. Thinking about these descriptors as a continuum rather than polar\nopposites is helpful because it allows us to imagine more communicative options for speakers.\nThey are not fixed into one style or another but instead, people can make choices about where to\nbe on the continuum according to the context in which they find themselves.\nThis first continuum has to do with the explicitness of one\u2019s talk, or how much of one\u2019s thoughts\nare communicated directly through words and how much is indirect. Direct speech is very\nexplicit while indirect speech is more obscure. If I say, \u201cClose the window,\u201d my meaning is quite\nclear. However, if I were to ask, \u201cIs anyone else cold in here?\u201d or, \u201cGeez, this room is cold,\u201d I\nmight be signaling indirectly that I want someone to close the window. As the United States is\ntypically a direct culture, these latter statements might generate comments like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t\nyou just ask someone to shut the window?\u201d or \u201cShut it yourself.\u201d Why might someone make a\nchoice to use a direct or indirect form of communication? What are some of the advantages or\ndisadvantages of each style? Think about the context for a moment. If you as a student were in a\nmeeting with the President of your university and you were to tell her to \u201cShut the window,\u201d what\ndo you think would happen? Can you even imagine saying that? An indirect approach in this\ncontext may appear more polite, appropriate, and effective.\nRemember the fairy tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears? As Goldilocks tasted the porridge,\nshe exclaimed, \u201cThis one is too hot, this one is too cold, but this one is just right.\u201d This next\ncontinuum of communication styles, succinct\/exact vs. elaborate, can be thought of this way as\nwell. The elaborate style uses more words, phrases, or metaphors to express an idea than the other\ntwo styles. It may be described as descriptive, poetic, or too wordy depending on your view.\nCommenting on a flower garden, an American (Exact\/Succinct) speaker may say, \u201cWow, look\nat all the color variations. That\u2019s beautiful.\u201d An Egyptian (Elaborate) speaker may go into much\nmore detail about the specific varieties and colors of the blossoms: \u201cThis garden invokes so many\nmemories for me. The deep purple irises remind me of my maternal grandmother as those are\nher favorite flowers. Those pink roses are similar to the ones I sent to my first love.\u201d The succinct\nstyle in contrast values simplicity and silence. As many mothers usually tell their children, \u201cIf 62 \u2022 PART 4\nyou can\u2019t say anything nice, then don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Cultures such as Buddhism and the\nAmish value this form. The exact style is the one for Goldilocks as it falls between the other two\nand would be, in her words, \u201cjust right.\u201d It is not overly descriptive or too vague to be of use.\nRemember when we were talking about the French and Spanish languages and the fact that\nthey have a formal and informal \u201cyou\u201d depending on the relationship between the speaker and\nthe audience? This example also helps explain the third communication style: the personal and\ncontextual. The contextual style is one where there are structural linguistic devices used to mark\nthe relationship between the speaker and the listener. If this sounds a bit unfamiliar, that is because\nthe English language has no such linguistic distinctions; it is an example of the personal style\nthat enhances the sense of \u201cI.\u201d While the English language does allow us to show respect for our\naudience such as the choice to eliminate slang or the use of titles such as Sir, Madame, President,\nCongressperson, or Professor, they do not inherently change the structure of the language.\nThe final continuum, instrumental\/affective, refers to who holds the responsibility for effectively\nconveying a message: the speaker or the audience? The instrumental style is goal- or sender-\norientated, meaning it is the burden of the speaker to make themselves understood. The affective\nstyle is more receiver-orientated, thus places more responsibility on the listener. Here, the listener\nshould pay attention to verbal, nonverbal, and relationship clues in an attempt to understand\nthe message. Asian cultures such as China and Japan and many Native American tribes are\naffective cultures. The United States is more instrumental. Think about sitting in your college\nclassroom listening to your professor lecture. If you do not understand the material where\ndoes the responsibility reside? Usually it is given to the professor as in statements such as \u201cMy\nmath professor isn\u2019t very well organized,\u201d or \u201cBy the end of the Econ. lecture all that was on the\nboard were lines, circles, and a bunch of numbers. I didn\u2019t know what was important and what\nwasn\u2019t.\u201d These statements suggest that it is up to the professor to communicate the material to\nthe students. As the authors were raised in the American educational system they too were used\nto this perspective and often look at their teaching methods when students fail to understand\nthe material. A professor was teaching in China and when her students encountered particular\ndifficulty with a certain concept she would often ask the students, \u201cWhat do you need\u2014more\nexamples? Shall we review again? Are the terms confusing?\u201d Her students, raised in a more\naffective environment responded, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not you. It is our job as your students to try harder.\nWe did not study enough and will read the chapter again so we will understand.\u201d The students\naccepted the responsibility as listeners to work to understand the speaker.\n4.2.2 Adapted from Survey of Communication Study (Laura K.
