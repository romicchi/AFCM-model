Linguists don\u2019t spend time prescribing how\npeople should or shouldn\u2019t use their language!\nOne of the challenges of observing how humans use language is that a lot of what we do with language happens\nin our minds. Of course, it\u2019s relatively simple to observe the words that we speak or write, but it\u2019s much harder to\nobserve the processes that unfold in someone\u2019s mind when they\u2019re listening to someone speaking, understanding\nthem, and thinking up a reply. Part of learning to do linguistics is learning some of the techniques linguists have\nfor drawing conclusions about these mental processes.\nIn Chapter 1 we also discuss the fundamental attributes of human language and discover the five core\ncomponents that make up the grammar of every human language.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 differentiate between prescriptive and descriptive ways of thinking about language,\n\u2022 identify five components of mental grammar,\n\u2022 recognize common misconceptions about language.\n5  1.1 Linguistics is Science\nThis unit introduces the idea of thinking scientifically about language by making empirical observations rather than\njudgments of correctness.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

First, when we say that linguistics is a\nscience, that doesn\u2019t mean you need a lab coat and safety goggles to do linguistics. Instead, what it means is that\nthe way we ask questions to learn about language uses a scientific approach.\nThe scientific way of thinking about language involves making systematic, empirical observations. There\u2019s\nanother important word: empirical means that we observe data to find the evidence for our theories.\nAll scientists make empirical observations: botanists observe how plants grow and reproduce. Chemists observe\nhow substances interact with other. Linguists observe how people use their language.\nA crucial thing to keep in mind is that the observations we make about language use are NOT value judgments.\nLots of people in the world \u2014 like your high school English teacher, various newspaper columnists, maybe your\ngrandparents, and maybe even some of your friends \u2014 make judgments about how people use language. But\nlinguists don\u2019t.\nA short-hand way of saying this is that linguists have a descriptive approach to language, not a prescriptive\napproach.\nWe describe what people do with their language, but we don\u2019t prescribe how they should or shouldn\u2019t do it.\nThis descriptive approach is consistent with a scientific way of thinking. Think about an entomologist who\nstudies beetles. Imagine that scientist observes that a species of beetle eats leaves. She\u2019s not going to judge that\nthe beetles are eating wrong, and tell them that they\u2019d be more successful in life if only they eat the same thing\nas ants. No \u2014 she observes what the beetle eats and tries to figure out why: she develops a theory of why the\nbeetle eats this plant and not that one.\nIn the same way, linguists observe what people say and how they say it, and come up with theories of why\npeople say certain things or make certain sounds but not others.\nIn our simple definition of linguistics, there\u2019s another important word we need to focus on: linguistics is the\nscience of human language.\nThere are plenty of species that communicate with each other in an impressive variety of ways, but in linguistics,\nour job is to focus on the unique system that humans use.\nIt turns out that humans have some important differences to all other species that make our language unique.\nFirst, what we call the articulatory system: our lungs, larynx & vocal folds, and the shape of our tongue, teeth, 1.1 LINGUISTICS IS SCIENCE 9\nlips, nose, all enable us to produce speech. No other species can do this in the way we can, not even our closest\ngenetic relatives the chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans.\nSecond, our auditory system is special: our ears are sensitive to exactly the frequencies that are most\ncommon in human speech. There are other species that have similar patterns of auditory sensitivity, but human\nnewborns pay special attention to human speech, even more so than synthetic speech that is matched for acoustic\ncharacteristics.\nAnd most important of all, our neural system is special: no other species has a brain as complex and densely\nconnected as ours with so many connections dedicated to producing and understanding language.\nHumans\u2019 language ability is different from all other species\u2019 communication systems, and linguistics is the\nscience that studies this unique ability. 1.2 Mental Grammar\nLinguistics is part of the broad field of cognitive science, which studies the human mind. Linguistics focus specifically on the\nmental grammar: the system that all speakers of a language have in their minds, which allows them to understand each other.\nThe mental grammar of every language includes phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.\n10 1.2 MENTAL GRAMMAR 11\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

It\u2019s also important to know that linguistics\nis one member of the broad field that is known as cognitive science.\nThe cognitive sciences are interested in what goes in the mind. And in linguistics, we\u2019re specifically interested in\nhow our language knowledge is represented and organized in the human mind.\nThink about this: you and I both speak English. I\u2019m speaking English right here on this video and you\u2019re listening\nand understanding me. Right now I\u2019ve got some idea in my mind that I want to express. I\u2019m squeezing the air out of\nmy lungs; I\u2019m vibrating my vocal folds, and I\u2019m manipulating parts of my mouth to produce sounds. Those sounds\nare captured by a microphone and now they\u2019re playing on your computer. In response to the sound coming from\nyour computer speaker or your headphones, your eardrums are vibrating and sending signals to your brain, with\nthe result that the idea in your mind is something similar to the idea that was in my head when I made this video.\nThere must be something that your mind and my mind have in common to allow that to happen: some shared\nsystem that allows us to understand each other\u2019s ideas when we speak. In linguistics, we call that system\nthe mental grammar and our primary goal is to find out what that shared system is like.\nAll speakers of all languages have a mental grammar: the shared system that lets speakers of a language\nunderstand each other. In Essentials of Linguistics we devote most of our attention to the mental grammar of\nEnglish, but we\u2019ll also use our scientific tools and techniques to examine some parts of the grammars of other\nlanguages.\nWe\u2019ll start by looking at sound systems: how speakers make particular sounds and how listeners hear these\nsounds. If you\u2019ve ever tried to learn a second language you know that the sounds in the second language are not\nalways the same as in your first language. Linguists call the study of speech sounds phonetics. 12 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nThen we\u2019ll look at how the mental grammar of each language organizes sounds in the mind; this is called\nphonology.\nWe will examine the strategies that languages use to form meaningful words; this is called morphology.\nThen we take a close look at the different ways that languages combine words to form phrases and sentences.\nThe term for that is syntax.\nWe also look at how the meanings of words and sentences are organized in the mind, which linguists call\nsemantics.\nThese five things are the core pieces of the mental grammar of any language: they\u2019re the things all speakers\nknow about a language. All languages have phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics in their\ngrammars.\nThese five areas are also the core subfields of theoretical linguistics. Just as there are other kinds of language\nknowledge we have, there are other branches of the field of linguistics, and we\u2019ll take a peek at some of those\nother branches along the way. 1.3 Creativity and Generativity\nThe foremost property of mental grammar is that it is generative: it allows each speaker to create new words and sentences\nthat have never been spoken before. The mental grammar generates these new words and sentences according to systematic\nprinciples that every speaker knows unconsciously.\n13 14 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=26\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nProbably the most fundamental property of human language is creativity. When we say that human languages\nare creative, we don\u2019t just mean that you can use them to write beautiful poems and great works of literature.\nWhen we say that human language is creative, we mean a couple of different things:\nFirst, every language can express any possible concept.\nThat notion might surprise you at first. I often see magazine articles or blog posts that talk about supposedly\nuntranslatable words that exist in other languages but that don\u2019t exist in English. A quick search online leads me\nto these gems:\nKKuummmmeerrssppeecckk is the German word for excess weight gained from emotional overeating.\nIn Inuktitut, iikkttssuuaarrppookk is that feeling of anticipation when you\u2019re waiting for someone to show up at your house\nand you keep going outside to see if they\u2019re there yet.\nAnd in Tagalog, ggiiggiill is the word for the urge to squeeze something that is irresistibly cute.\nSo if you believe that kind of article, it might seem like some concepts are restricted to certain languages. But\nthink about it: Just because English doesn\u2019t have one single word that means \u201cthe urge to squeeze something cute\u201d\ndoesn\u2019t mean that English-speakers can\u2019t understand the concept of wanting to squeeze something cute. As soon\nas I described it using the English phrase \u201cthe urge to squeeze something cute\u201d you understood the concept! It\njust takes more than one word to express it! The same is true of every language: all of the world\u2019s languages can\nexpress all concepts.\nThe other side of the creativity of language is even more interesting. Every language can generate an infinite\nnumber of possible new words and sentences.\nEvery language has a finite set of words in it. A language\u2019s vocabulary might be quite large, but it\u2019s still finite.\nAnd every language has a small and finite set of principles for combining those words. 1.3 CREATIVITY AND GENERATIVITY 15\nBut every language can use that finite vocabulary and that finite set of principles to generate an infinite number\nof sentences, new sentences every single day.\nLikewise, every language has a finite set of sounds and a finite set of principles for combining those sounds.\nEvery language can use those finite resources to generate an infinite number of possible new words in that\nlanguage.\nBecause human languages are all capable of generating new words and generating new sentences, we say that\nhuman grammar is generative.\nRemember that when we use the word \u201cgrammar\u201d in linguistics, we\u2019re talking not about the prescriptive rules\nthat your Grade 6 teacher tried to make you follow, but about mental grammar, the things in our minds that all\nspeakers of a language have in common that allow us to understand each other. Mental grammar is generative.\nThe final, and possibly the most important thing to know about the creativity of language is that it is governed\nby systematic principles. Every fluent speaker of a language uses systematic principles to combine sounds to\nform words and to combine words to form sentences. In Essentials of Linguistics, we\u2019ll use the tools of systematic\nobservation to discover what these systematic principles are. 1.4 Fundamental Properties of Language\nThis unit addresses some of the common myths that people believe about languages, and responds to these misconceptions\nwith fundamental truths about human language:\n\u2022 All languages have a grammar.\n\u2022 All languages & grammars are equally valid, in linguistic terms.\n\u2022 All languages have some universal properties in common.\n\u2022 Every language changes over time.\n\u2022 Most of our knowledge of the mental grammar of our language is unconscious.\n16 1.4 FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF LANGUAGE 17\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

But there are lots of\nthings that are commonly believed about language that just aren\u2019t true.\nYou might have heard someone say that a given language has no grammar. I\u2019ve heard people try to argue that\nChinese has no grammar, that English has no grammar, that the languages spoken by Indigenous people who live\nin what is currently Canada have no grammar, even that Swiss German has no grammar.\nWhen people say this, they might mean a few different things. Sometimes they just mean that there\u2019s not much\nvariation in the forms of words, which is true of Chinese, but the grammar of Chinese has lots of complexity in its\nsound system.\nBut sometimes people who argue that a language has no grammar are actually trying to claim that that language\nis inferior in some way.\nThe truth is that all languages have grammar. All languages have a sound system, a system for forming words,\na way of organizing words into sentences, a systematic way of assigning meanings. Even languages that don\u2019t have\nwriting systems or dictionaries or published books of rules still have speakers who understand each other; that\nmeans they have a shared system, a shared mental grammar.\nWhen we\u2019re investigating mental grammar, it doesn\u2019t matter whether a language has a prestigious literature or\nis spoken by powerful people. Using linguists\u2019 techniques for making scientific observations about language, we\ncan study the phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics of any language.\nAnother opinion that you might have heard about language is that some languages are better than\nothers. Maybe you\u2019ve heard someone say, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t speak real Italian, just a dialect,\u201d implying that the dialect\nis not as good as so-called real Italian. Or maybe you\u2019ve heard someone say that Qu\u00e9bec French is just sloppy;\nit\u2019s not as good as the French they speak in France. Or maybe you\u2019ve heard someone say that nobody in\nNewfoundland can speak proper English, or nobody in Texas speaks proper English, or maybe even nobody in\nNorth America speaks proper English and the only good English is the Queen\u2019s English that they speak in England.\nThe truth is that all languages are equally valid. Just as we said that all languages have grammar, it\u2019s also\nthe case that there\u2019s no way to say that one grammar is better or worse than another grammar. Remember\nthat linguistics takes a scientific approach to language, and scientists don\u2019t rate or rank the things they study.\nIchthyologists don\u2019t rank fish to say which species is more correct at being a fish, and astronomers don\u2019t argue\nover which galaxy is more posh. In the same way, linguists don\u2019t assign a value to any language or variety or dialect.\nIt is the case, though, that plenty of people do attribute value to particular dialects or varieties, and\nsociolinguistic research tells us that there can be negative or positive social consequences for people who speak\ncertain varieties. When people say that British English is better than American English, for example, they\u2019re making\na social judgment, based on politics, history, economics, or snobbery. But there is no linguistic basis for making\nthat value judgment.\nOne of the common misconceptions about language arose when scholars first started doing linguistics. At first,\nthey focused on the languages that they knew, which were mostly the languages that were spoken in Europe. The\ngrammars of those languages had a lot in common because they all evolved from a common ancestor, which we\nnow call Proto-Indo-European. When linguists started learning about the languages spoken in other parts of the\nworld, they thought at first that these languages were so unfamiliar, so unusual, so weird, that they speculated\nthat these languages had nothing at all in common with the languages of Europe.\nLinguists have now studied enough languages to know that in spite of the many differences between languages,\nthere are some universal properties that are common to all human languages. The field of linguistic\ntypology studies the properties that languages have in common even across languages that they aren\u2019t related\nto. Some of these universal properties are at the level of phonology, for example, all languages have consonants\nand vowels. Some of these universals are at the level of morphology and syntax. All languages make a distinction 1.4 FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF LANGUAGE 19\nbetween nouns and verbs. In nearly all languages, the subject of a sentence comes before the verb and before\nthe object of the sentence. We\u2019ll discover more of these universals as we proceed through the chapters.\nA very common belief that people have about language is something you might have heard from your\ngrandparents or your teachers. Have you heard them say, \u201cKids these days are ruining English! They should learn\nto speak properly!\u201d Or if you grew up speaking Mandarin, maybe you heard the same thing, \u201cThose teenagers are\nruining Mandarin! They should learn to speak properly!\u201d For as long as there has been language, there have been\npeople complaining that young people are ruining it, and trying to force them to speak in a more old-fashioned\nway. Some countries like France and Germany even have official institutes that make prescriptive rules about what\nwords and sentence structures are allowed in the language and which ones aren\u2019t allowed.\nThe truth is that every language changes over time. Languages are spoken by humans, and as humans grow\nand change, and as our society changes, our language changes along with it. Some language change is as simple as\nin the vocabulary of a language: we need to introduce new words to talk about new concepts and new inventions.\nFor example, the verb google didn\u2019t exist when I was an undergraduate student, but now googling is something I do\nevery day. Language also changes in they we pronounce things and in the way we use words and form sentences.\nIn a later chapter, we\u2019ll talk about some of the things that are changing in Canadian English.\nAnother common belief about language is the idea that you can\u2019t learn a language unless someone teaches\nyou the rules, either in a language class or with a textbook or a software package. This might be partially true for\nlearning a language as an adult: it might be hard to do it on your own without a teacher. But think about yourself\nas a kid. Whatever language you grew up speaking, whether it\u2019s English or French or Mandarin or Arabic or Tamil\nor Serbian, you didn\u2019t have to wait until kindergarten to start speaking. You learned the language from infancy by\ninteracting with the people around you who spoke that language. Some of those people around you might have\ntaught you particular words for things, but they probably weren\u2019t teaching you, \u201cmake the [f] sound by putting\nyour top teeth on your bottom lip\u201d or \u201cmake sure you put the subject of the sentence before the verb\u201d. And by the\ntime you started school you were perfectly fluent in your language. In some parts of the world, people never go to\nschool and never have any formal instruction, but they still speak their languages fluently.\nThat\u2019s because almost everything we know about our language \u2014 our mental grammar \u2014 is unconscious\nknowledge that\u2019s acquired implicitly as children. Much of your knowledge of your mental grammar is not\naccessible to your conscious awareness. This is kind of a strange idea: how can you know something if you\u2019re\nnot conscious of knowing it? Many things that we know are indeed conscious knowledge. For example, if I asked\nyou, you could explain to me how to get to your house, or what the capital of Canada is, or what the difference\nis between a cow and a horse. But our mind also has lots of knowledge that is not fully conscious. You probably\ncan\u2019t explain very clearly how to control your muscles to climb stairs, or how to recognize the face of someone\nyou know, or how to form complex sentences in your native language, and yet you can do all of these things easily\nand fluently, and unconsciously. A lot of our job when we study Linguistics is to make explicit the things that you\nalready know implicitly. This is exactly what makes linguistics challenging at first, but it\u2019s also what makes it fun! 1.5 Language Change in Progress\nThis unit looks at some changes that have happened in English and some that are happening right now:\n\u2022 Changes to the vocabulary of English.\n\u2022 A change in the sound system that happened through the 20th century.\n\u2022 Some changes in the morphosyntax that are in progress in 2020.\n20 1.5 LANGUAGE CHANGE IN PROGRESS 21\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In this unit, we\u2019ll look more closely at some of the\nchanges that are happening in English right now.\nEvery part of a language\u2019s grammar can change, but some of these changes are faster than others, and some\nare more noticeable. The lexicon is the vocabulary of a language \u2014 what words are in the language. New words\nenter English all the time as new technologies and concepts emerge, and dictionary editors like to publish lists of\nthe new words they\u2019ve added. This list shows a handful of words that were added to the Oxford English Dictionary\nin 2020: beardo, awesomesauce, mentionitis, self-isolate, PPE (for personal protective equipment), and, thirsty? Surely\nthe word thirsty was in the Dictionary before 2020!? Yes, it was, with the meaning of \u201cwanting something to drink\u201d,\nbut a new meaning was added in 2020 \u2014 if you don\u2019t know that new meaning you might want to look it up.\nA kind of language change that happens more gradually is in the sound system. Here are two English words, and\nI want you to think about whether both these words sound the same to you. For me, these two words sound the\nsame \u2014 they\u2019re both [wa\u026an]. But for some English-speakers, the second word, the one that\u2019s spelled with a \u201cwh\u201d,\nhas a voiceless sound at the beginning, so it\u2019s pronounced [\u028da\u026an]. When I say, \u201csome English speakers\u201d, who do I\nmean?\nJack Chambers, a linguist at the University of Toronto, conducted a large-scale study of Canadian English and\nhow it has changed over time. One part of his study asked people to say words that started with a \u201cwh\u201d: words like\nwhere, whine, whale, wheel. Then he analyzed his findings according to how old his participants were. In this graph,\nI\u2019ve plotted people\u2019s decade of birth along the x-axis. So when Chambers was doing his research, people who had\nbeen born before 1920 were in their 80s. You can see that for this age group, more than half of them have the\nvoiceless [\u028d] at the beginning of these wh-words. So for this group, whine sounds different from wine. For the next\nyounger group, the pattern is about the same, but for each successively younger group, the proportion of people\nwho pronounce a wh-word with a voiceless [\u028d] drops off. So for the people who were in their late teens and early\ntwenties when Chambers interviewed them, only about 10% pronounced whine differently from wine. By looking\nat this snapshot across different age groups, we can get a picture of how Canadian English has changed over time.\nLanguages might also change in their morphology and syntax, though these changes tend to happen very slowly\nindeed. Let\u2019s look at a couple of changes that are in progress right now. The first one I want to look at has to do\nwith the word because. Suppose I start a sentence like this, \u201cAlex took an umbrella because\u2026\u201d and I ask you to\nfinish it. You might finish it by appending another whole sentence, \u201cbecause it was raining\u201d. Or you might choose a\nprepositional phrase that starts with of, \u201cbecause of the rain\u201d. Both of these options have been available in English\nsyntax for centuries. But a new option is emerging. If you\u2019re young, or if you spend a lot of time online, you might\nfinish this sentence just, \u201cbecause thunderstorm\u201d, with just a plain old noun phrase. This change seems to have\nstarted on Craigslist in 2011, with an ad for a car that was \u201ccompletely stripped inside because race car\u201d, and now\nforms the title of the book Because Internet, in which linguist Gretchen McCulloch documents the ways that the\ninternet has changed how we use language.\nThe last change I want to talk about is also happening in the morphosyntax of English, in the pronoun system.\nBut first we need to look at a change that happened hundreds of years ago. In the 16th century, English used to\nhave two ways of saying \u201cyou\u201d. If you were talking to a group of people, you\u2019d say you just like we do now. But if\nyou were talking to just one person, you\u2019d address them as thou or thee, as in, \u201cWhat classes art thou taking this\nterm?\u201d or \u201cI really like thy new haircut\u201d. By the 17th century, thou and thee had all but disappeared and were only\nreserved for conversations with people you\u2019re very close to. So the word you was used for both singular and plural.\nIn modern English, we don\u2019t have thou or thee at all unless we\u2019re trying to be funny or old-fashioned. But it can\nbe pretty useful to have a way of distinguishing between singular and plural, so some varieties of spoken English\nhave other plural forms, like y\u2019all or you guys or youse. Maybe your variety of English has one of these.\nSo that change in the pronoun system happened hundreds of years ago without incident. These days a different\nchange is happening, this time to the third person pronoun they. For centuries, they has been used as a plural 1.5 LANGUAGE CHANGE IN PROGRESS 23\npronoun, to refer to a group of people, as in, \u201cThe children said they played soccer all afternoon\u201d. And it\u2019s also very\ncommon to use they when we don\u2019t know how many people are involved. You might hear someone say, \u201cWhoever\nwas in here, he or she or they made a big mess\u201d but it would sound very formal and stuffy. The same is true if\nyou\u2019re talking about one person whose identity you don\u2019t know, or if it just isn\u2019t relevant \u2014 maybe I\u2019m telling one\nof my colleagues, \u201cOne of my students told me they were locked out of their email\u201d. There\u2019s only one student, but\ntheir identity isn\u2019t relevant to the story, so I just refer to them as they. This so-called singular they has also been\nin English for centuries \u2014 you can see that it\u2019s documented as far back as the fifteenth century, in contexts that\nare really clearly singular: each of them, a man, a person. The change that\u2019s in progress right now is to use they\nfor a single person whose identity we do know, either because they\u2019re non-binary and use they/them pronouns\nor because we\u2019re choosing not to specify their gender. When I poll students, that is, people in their 20s, I usually\nfind that about half of them have this specific-singular-they in their mental grammar, and about half don\u2019t. So it\u2019s a\nchange that\u2019s unfolding right now.\nAs always, when language changes, some prescriptivists get quite uptight about it. The Chicago Manual of Style\ntells people \u201cit is still considered ungrammatical\u201d, and the AP Stylebook tells you it\u2019s \u201cacceptable in limited cases\u201d\nbut they\u2019d really prefer if you didn\u2019t use it. And then there are the extremely crabby folks like this author who\nclaimed it hurt her ears and burned her eyes, poor thing! But no matter how much the prescriptivists yell, specific-\nsingular-they is getting used more and more widely. In 2015 the American Dialect Society voted it the Word of the\nYear; the Globe & Mail added it to its style guide in 2017, and it was the Merriam-Webster Dictionary\u2019s Word of\nthe Year in 2019. And linguists are paying attention to how this part of English grammar is changing. Bronwyn\nBjorkman found that English-speakers with a conservative grammar didn\u2019t use they in this way, but those with\nan \u201cinnovative\u201d grammar did. Lauren Ackerman has proposed that the more trans and non-binary friends you\nhave, the likelier your grammar is to have specific-singular-they. Kirby Conrod found in their dissertation that older\npeople were less likely to use it and younger people were more likely, and Lex Konnelly just published a paper\ntracking the three stages of grammatical change that are unfolding.\nI said earlier that this change is happening no matter how much it bothers the prescriptivists. No one can stop\nlanguage from changing. But can we make it happen faster? After all, grammar is people \u2014 if everyone woke up\ntomorrow and started calling a dog a \u201cblimlimlim\u201d, the dictionaries couldn\u2019t stop us! There is good research that\nshows that misgendering people does real harm. One way to make it less likely that non-binary people will be\nmisgendered is for the language to change to include specific-singular-they. And the way that language changes is\nfor people to change how they use it. If you already have specific-singular-they in your grammar, use it as much\nas you can! And if you\u2019d like to change your own mental grammar, Kirby Conrod gives some good advice \u2014 slow\ndown, listen to people who use it in their own language, and practice! The more you use it, the more natural it will\nfeel. Practice Time\nExercise 1. Generate a sentence of English that you have never, ever uttered or heard before. Have a friend do\nthe same thing. Exchange sentences with your friend. Were you able to understand each other\u2019s sentences? How\ncould you understand them, even though you had never heard them before?\nExercise 2. Pretend you\u2019re working for a start-up. Your company has developed a very cool new product, and\nthey turn to you, the linguist, to come up with a name for this new product. It has to be a unique name that doesn\u2019t\nalready exist. What will you name your company\u2019s cool new product?\nNow, look at this list of product names generated by other students. Which of them are good product names\nand which aren\u2019t? What makes something a good name?\nmentocular swoodiei torrix baizan\njibberdab keerild euquinu tuitionary\nkzen zirka hbiufk fluxon\nExercise 3. Think of a word that has only recently entered English, so it\u2019s not yet in mainstream dictionaries.\nObserve some examples of the word being used in context, either in your regular conversations or by searching\nonline. Based on your observations of the word in context, write a dictionary definition of the word.\nExercise 4. Think about all the languages that you speak, or about a variety of language that you\u2019ve heard\nspoken by someone you know. Make two scientific observations about that language or a variety. Your\nobservations might be about the sounds of the language, about the words, about how the sentences are\norganized, or about how people use different elements of the language. Remember that scientific observations\nare descriptive, not prescriptive.\n24 Summary\nWe\u2019ve now seen that the field of linguistics approaches the study of language from a scientific point of view.\nAs linguists, we seek to make systematic, descriptive observations about human language behaviour. From\nthese empirical observations, linguists have learned that every speaker of every human language has a mental\ngrammar. And the mental grammar of every language includes systematic principles for how sounds (or hand\nsigns, in a signed language) are made, for how these sounds or signs are organized into words, for how words\nand smaller pieces of words are combined to form phrases and sentences, and for how we assign meaning to\nwords and sentences. When we speak our language, we use our mental grammar to generate new phrases and\nsentences, and the people who listen to us use their mental grammar to understand us.\n25  CHAPTER 2: PRODUCING SPEECH\nSOUNDS\nIn this chapter, we learn how humans produce speech sounds and how linguists classify speech sounds. Sounds\nare classified according to how they\u2019re produced and what they sound like. We also begin to learn a notation\nsystem for representing speech sounds, since the English writing system is not very accurate or consistent in how\nit represents sounds.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the parts of the body that humans use to produce speech sounds\n\u2022 Classify speech sounds according to their articulatory and acoustic properties.\n\u2022 Use the symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to represent speech sounds.\n27  2.1 How Humans Produce Speech\nPhonetics studies human speech. Speech is produced by bringing air from the lungs to the larynx (respiration), where the\nvocal folds may be held open to allow the air to pass through or may vibrate to make a sound (phonation). The airflow from\nthe lungs is then shaped by the articulators in the mouth and nose (articulation).\n29 30 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

When we study speech sounds we can consider them\nfrom two angles. Acoustic phonetics, in addition to being part of linguistics, is also a branch of physics. It\u2019s\nconcerned with the physical, acoustic properties of the sound waves that we produce. We\u2019ll talk some about the\nacoustics of speech sounds, but we\u2019re primarily interested in articulatory phonetics, that is, how we humans use\nour bodies to produce speech sounds. Producing speech needs three mechanisms.\nThe first is a source of energy. Anything that makes a sound needs a source of energy. For human speech\nsounds, the air flowing from our lungs provides energy.\nThe second is a source of the sound: air flowing from the lungs arrives at the larynx. Put your hand on the front\nof your throat and gently feel the bony part under your skin. That\u2019s the front of your larynx. It\u2019s not actually made\nof bone; it\u2019s cartilage and muscle. This picture shows what the larynx looks like from the front. 2.1 HOW HUMANS PRODUCE SPEECH 31\nThis next picture is a view down a person\u2019s throat.\nBy Olek Remesz (wiki-pl: Orem, commons: Orem) [CC BY-SA\n2.5-2.0-1.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/\n2.5-2.0-1.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\nBy OpenStax College [CC BY 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)], via Wikimedia Commons 32 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nWhat you see here is that the opening of the larynx can be covered by two triangle-shaped pieces of skin. These\nare often called \u201cvocal cords\u201d but they\u2019re not really like cords or strings. A better name for them is vocal folds.\nThe opening between the vocal folds is called the glottis.\nWe can control our vocal folds to make a sound. I want you to try this out so take a moment and close your\ndoor or make sure there\u2019s no one around that you might disturb.\nFirst I want you to say the word \u201cuh-oh\u201d. Now say it again, but stop half-way through, \u201cUh-\u201d. When you do that,\nyou\u2019ve closed your vocal folds by bringing them together. This stops the air flowing through your vocal tract. That\nlittle silence in the middle of \u201cuh-oh\u201d is called a glottal stop because the air is stopped completely when the vocal\nfolds close off the glottis.\nNow I want you to open your mouth and breathe out quietly, \u201chaaaaaaah\u201d. When you do this, your vocal folds\nare open and the air is passing freely through the glottis.\nNow breathe out again and say \u201caaah\u201d, as if the doctor is looking down your throat. To make that \u201caaaah\u201d sound,\nyou\u2019re holding your vocal folds close together and vibrating them rapidly.\nWhen we speak, we make some sounds with vocal folds open, and some with vocal folds vibrating. Put your\nhand on the front of your larynx again and make a long \u201cSSSSS\u201d sound. Now switch and make a \u201cZZZZZ\u201d sound.\nYou can feel your larynx vibrate on \u201cZZZZZ\u201d but not on \u201cSSSSS\u201d. That\u2019s because [s] is a voiceless sound, made with\nthe vocal folds held open, and [z] is a voiced sound, where we vibrate the vocal folds. Do it again and feel the\ndifference between voiced and voiceless.\nNow take your hand off your larynx and plug your ears and make the two sounds again with your ears plugged.\nYou can hear the difference between voiceless and voiced sounds inside your head.\nI said at the beginning that there are three crucial mechanisms involved in producing speech, and so far we\u2019ve\nlooked at only two:\n\u2022 Energy comes from the air supplied by the lungs.\n\u2022 The vocal folds produce sound at the larynx.\n\u2022 The sound is then filtered, or shaped, by the articulators.\nThe oral cavity is the space in your mouth. The nasal cavity, obviously, is the space inside and behind your\nnose. And of course, we use our tongues, lips, teeth and jaws to articulate speech as well. In the next unit, we\u2019ll\nlook in more detail at how we use our articulators.\nSo to sum up, the three mechanisms that we use to produce speech are:\n\u2022 respiration at the lungs,\n\u2022 phonation at the larynx, and\n\u2022 articulation in the mouth. 2.2 Articulators\nSpeaking involves controlling parts of the mouth and nose to shape the air that comes from the lungs. This unit introduces\nthe names and locations of the articulators that are used to produce the sounds of English: the tongue, lips and teeth, the\nalveolar ridge, the palate, the velum, and the nasal cavity.\n33 34 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

That airflow is then shaped by the articulators. 2.2 ARTICULATORS 35\nThis image is called a sagittal section. It depicts the inside of your\nhead as if we sliced right between your eyes and down the middle\nof your nose and mouth. This angle gives us a good view of the parts\nof the vocal tract that are involved in filtering airflow to produce\nspeech sounds.\nLet\u2019s start at the front of your mouth, with your lips. If you make\nthe sound \u201caaaaa\u201d then round your lips, the sound of the vowel\nchanges. We can also use our lips to block the flow of air completely,\nlike in the consonants [b] and [p].\nWe also use our teeth to shape airflow. They don\u2019t do much on\ntheir own, but we can place the tip of the tongue between the teeth,\nfor sounds like [\u03b8] and [\u00f0]. Or we can bring the top teeth down\nagainst the bottom lip for [f] and [v].\nIf you put your finger in your mouth and tap the roof of your\nmouth, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s bony. That is the hard palate. English\ndoesn\u2019t have very many palatal sounds, but we do raise the tongue\ntowards the palate for the glide [j].\nNow from where you have your finger on the roof of your mouth,\nslide it forward towards your top teeth. Before you get to the teeth,\nyou\u2019ll find a ridge, which is called the alveolar ridge. If you use the\nCreated by User:ish shwar (original .png deleted),\ntip of the tongue to block airflow at the alveolar ridge, you get the\n.svg by Rohieb [GFDL (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/\nfdl.html), CC-BY-SA-3.0 sounds [t] and [d]. We also produce [l] and [n] at the alveolar ridge,\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and some people also produce the sounds [s] and [z] with the\nvia Wikimedia Commons tongue at the alveolar ridge (though there are other ways of making\nthe [s] sound.)\nWhen we block airflow in the mouth but allow air to circulate\nthrough the nasal cavity, we get the nasal sounds [m] [n] and [\u014b].\nSome languages also have nasal vowels. Make an \u201caaaaa\u201d vowel again, then make it nasal. [aaaaa] [\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3]\nThe articulator that you move to allow air into the nasal cavity is called the velum. You might also know it as\nthe soft palate. For sounds made in the mouth, the velum rests against the back of the throat. But we can pull the\nvelum away from the back of the throat and allow air into the nose. We can also block airflow by moving the body\nof the tongue up against the velum, to make the sounds [k] and [\u0261].\nFarther back than the velum are the uvula and the pharynx, but English doesn\u2019t use these articulators in its set\nof speech sounds.\nEvery different configuration of the articulators leads to a different acoustic output. 2.3 Describing Speech Sounds: the IPA\nThis unit introduces the International Phonetic Alphabet, a system for accurately transcribing speech sounds. The IPA is\nuseful because it is unambiguous: each symbol always represents the same sound, and each sound is always represented by\nthe same symbol.\n36 2.3 DESCRIBING SPEECH SOUNDS: THE IPA 37\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You might have already noticed\nthat there\u2019s a challenge to talking about speech sounds \u2014 English spelling is notoriously messy.\nTake a look at these words:\nsay, weigh, they, rain, flame, lei, caf\u00e9, toupee, ballet\nAll of them contain the same vowel sound, [e], but the sound is spelled with nine different combinations of\nletters. Some of them are more common ways than others of spelling the sound [e], but even if we take away the\nones that English borrowed from other languages, that still leaves five different ways of spelling one sound. One of\nthe problems is that English has only five letter characters that represent vowels, but more than a dozen different\nvowel sounds. But it\u2019s not just the vowels that are the problem.\nEnglish has the opposite problem as well. Take a look at these words:\ncough, tough, bough, through, though\nHere we\u2019ve got a sequence of four letters that appear in the same order in the same position in each word, but\nthat sequence of letters is pronounced in five different ways in English. Not only can a single sound be represented\nby very many different spellings, but even a single spelling is not consistent with the sounds that it represents.\nEven one letter can be pronounced in a whole lot of different ways. Look at:\ncake, century, ocean, and cello\nThe letter \u201cc\u201d represents four quite different sounds. Clearly, English spelling is a mess. There are a lot of reasons\nfor why that might be.\nThe area where English first evolved was first inhabited by people who spoke early forms of Germanic and Celtic\ndialects. But then Normans invaded and brought all kinds of French and Latin words with their spellings. When 38 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nthe technology to print books was invented, there was influence from Dutch. So even the earliest form of English\nwas influenced by many different languages.\nModern English also borrows words from lots of languages. When we borrow words like cappuccino or\nchampagne, we adapt the pronunciation to fit into English but we often retain the spelling from the original\nlanguage.\nAnother factor is that the English spelling system was standardized hundreds of years ago when it became\npossible to print books. A lot of our standard spellings became consistent when the Authorized Version of the\nBible was published in the year 1611. Spelling hasn\u2019t actually changed much since 1611, but English pronunciation\nsure has, so the way we produce the sounds of English has diverged from how we write the language.\nFurthermore, English is spoken all over the world, with many different regional varieties. British English sounds\nquite different from Canadian English, which is different from Australian English, and Indian English is quite\ndifferent again, even though all of these varieties are spelled in nearly the same way.\nThere\u2019s even variation within each speaker of English, depending on the context: the way you speak is going to\nbe different depending on if you\u2019re hanging out with your friends or interviewing for a job or talking on the phone\nto your grandmother.\nThe important thing to remember for our purposes is that everyone who knows a language can speak and\nunderstand it, and children learn to speak and understand spoken language automatically. So in linguistics, we\nsay that speaking and listening are the primary linguistic skills. Not all languages have writing systems, and\nnot everyone who speaks a language can read or write it, so those skills are secondary.\nSo here\u2019s the problem: as linguists, we\u2019re primarily interested in speech and listening, but our English writing\nsystem is notoriously bad at representing speech sounds accurately. We need some way to be able to refer\nto particular speech sounds, not to English letters. Fortunately, linguists have developed a useful tool for doing\nexactly that. It\u2019s called the International Phonetic Alphabet, or IPA. The first version of the IPA was created over\n100 years ago, in 1888, and it\u2019s been revised many times over the years. The last revision was fairly recent, in\n2015. The most useful thing about the IPA is that, unlike English spelling, there\u2019s no ambiguity about which sound\na given symbol refers to. Each symbol represents only one sound, and each sound maps onto only one symbol.\nLinguists use the IPA to transcribe speech sounds from all languages.\nWhen we use this phonetic alphabet, we\u2019re not writing in the normal sense, we\u2019re putting down a visual\nrepresentation of sounds, so we call it phonetic transcription. That phonetic transcription gives us a written\nrecord of the sounds of spoken language. Here are just a few transcriptions of simple words so you can begin to\nsee how the IPA works.\nsnake [snek]\nsugar[\u0283\u028a\u0261\u0259\u0279]\ncake[kek]\ncell[s\u025bl]\nsell [s\u025bl]\nNotice that some of the IPA symbols look like English letters, and some of them are probably unfamiliar to you.\nSince some of the IPA symbols look a lot like letters, how can you know if you\u2019re looking at a spelled word or at\na phonetic transcription? The notation gives us a clue: the transcriptions all have square brackets around them.\nWhenever we transcribe speech sounds, we use square brackets to indicate that we\u2019re not using ordinary spelling.\nYou can learn the IPA symbols for representing the sounds of Canadian English in the next unit. For now, I\nwant you to notice the one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols. Look at those first two words:\nsnake and sugar. In English spelling, they both begin with the letter \u201cs\u201d. But in speaking, they begin with two quite\ndifferent sounds. This IPA symbol [s] always represents the [s] sound, never any other sound, even if those other\nsounds might be spelled with the letter \u201cs\u201d. The word sugar is spelled with the letter \u201cs\u201d but it doesn\u2019t begin with\nthe [s] sound so we use a different symbol to transcribe it.\nSo, one IPA symbol always makes the same sound. 2.3 DESCRIBING SPEECH SOUNDS: THE IPA 39\nLikewise, one sound is always represented by the same IPA symbol.\nLook at the word cake. It\u2019s spelled with \u201cc\u201d at the beginning and \u201ck-e\u201d at the end, but both those spellings make\nthe sound [k] so in its transcription, it begins and ends with the symbol for the [k] sound. Likewise, look at those\ntwo different words cell and sell. They\u2019re spelled differently, and we know that they have different meanings, but\nthey\u2019re both pronounced the same way, so they\u2019re transcribed using the same IPA symbols.\nThe reason the IPA is so useful is that it\u2019s unambiguous: each symbol always represents exactly one sound, and\neach sound is always represented by exactly one symbol. In the next unit, you\u2019ll start to learn the individual IPA\nsymbols that correspond to the sounds of Canadian English. 2.4 IPA symbols and speech sounds\nThe following tables give you some sample words so you can start to learn which IPA symbols correspond to\nwhich speech sounds. In these tables, the portion of the English word that makes the relevant sound is indicated\nin boldface type, but remember that English spelling is not always consistent, and your pronunciation of a word\nmight be a little different from someone else\u2019s. These examples are drawn from the pronunciation of mainstream\nCanadian English. To hear an audio-recording of the sound for each IPA symbol, consult the consonant, vowel, and\ndiphthong charts available here.\nThe sounds are categorized here according to how they\u2019re produced. You\u2019ll learn more about these categories\nin units 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.\nSTOPS\n[p] peach, apple, cap\n[b] bill, above, rib\n[t] tall, internal, light\n[d] dill, adore, kid\n[k] cave, ticket, luck\n[\u0261] give, baggage, dig\nFRICATIVES\n[f] phone, raffle, leaf\n[v] video, lively, love\n[\u03b8] thin, author, bath\n[\u00f0] there, leather, breathe\n[s] celery, passing, bus\n[z] zebra, deposit, shoes\n[\u0283] shell, ocean, rush\n[\u0292] genre, measure, rouge\n[h] hill, ahead\n40 2.4 IPA SYMBOLS AND SPEECH SOUNDS 41\nAFFRICATES\n[t\u0283] chip, achieve, ditch\n[d\u0292] jump, adjoin, bridge\nNASALS\n[m] mill, hammer, broom\n[n] nickel, sunny, spoon\n[\u014b] singer, wrong\nAPPROXIMANTS\n[l] lamb, silly, fall\n[\u0279] robot, furry, star\n[j] yellow, royal\n[w] winter, flower\nFLAP\n[\u027e] butter, pedal (only between vowels when the second syllable is unstressed)\nFRONT VOWELS\n[i] see, neat, piece\n[\u026a] pin, bit, lick\nsay, place, rain\n[e]\n(in spoken Canadian English, [e] becomes [e\u026a])\n[\u025b] ten, said, bread\n[\u00e6] mad, cat, fan\n[a] far, start\nBACK VOWELS\n[u] pool, blue\n[\u028a] look, good, bush\nthrow, hole, toe\n[o]\n(in spoken Canadian English, [o] becomes [o\u028a])\n[\u028c] bus, mud, lunch\n[\u0254] store, more, corn\n[\u0251] dog, ball, father 42 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nCENTRAL VOWELS\nbelieve, cinnamon, surround\n[\u0259]\n(in an unstressed syllable)\nroses, wanted\n[\u0268]\n(in an unstressed syllable that is a suffix)\nweather, editor\n[\u025a]\n(in an unstressed syllable with an r-quality)\nbird, fur\n[\u025d]\n(in a stressed syllable with an r-quality)\nDIPHTHONGS\n[a\u026a] fly, lie, smile\n[a\u028a] now, frown, loud\n[\u0254\u026a] boy, spoil, noise\n[ju] cue, few 2.5 Sonority, Consonants, and Vowels\nSonority has to do with how much acoustic energy a given speech sound has.

The process starts with respiration\nas air flows up from the lungs. Phonation occurs at the larynx, where the vocal folds may or may not vibrate\nto produce voicing, and then we use our mouth, jaw, lips, teeth and tongue to shape the sound, which is called\narticulation.\nIn phonetics, we classify sounds according to how they\u2019re produced, and also according to the acoustic\nproperties of the sounds. The primary acoustic property that we\u2019re interested in is called sonority. Sonority has\nto do with the amount of acoustic energy that a sound has. A simple example of this is that a loud sound is\nmore sonorous and a quiet sound is less sonorous. But sonority is not just about loudness. Sounds that are made\nwith lots of airflow from the lungs, and with vocal folds vibrating, are sonorous sounds. Sounds that have less\nairflow or don\u2019t have voicing from the vocal folds have less sonority. Those two pieces of information, sonority and\narticulation, allow us to group sounds into three broad categories\nWe produce vowels with the vocal tract quite open and usually with our vocal folds vibrating so vowels have a\nlot of acoustic energy: they\u2019re sonorous. Vowel sounds can go on for a long time: if you\u2019re singing, when you hold\nthe note, you hold it on the vowels. Make some vowel sounds and notice how you can hold them for a long time:\n\u201caaaaa iiiii uuuuu\u201d.\nThe sounds that we call consonants are ones where we use our articulators to obstruct the vocal tract, either\npartially or completely. Because the vocal tract is somewhat obstructed, less air flows from the lungs, so these\nsounds have less energy, they\u2019re less sonorous, and they\u2019re usually shorter than vowels. Consonant sounds can\nbe voiced or voiceless.\nThere\u2019s also an intermediate category called glides that have some of the properties of vowels and some of the\nconsonants. The vocal tract is unobstructed for glides, like for vowels, but they are shorter and less sonorous than\nvowels. We\u2019ll learn more about glides when we take a closer look at vowels.\nThis acoustic notion of sonority plays a role in every language of the world because spoken words are organized\naround the property of sonority. Every single spoken word is made up of one or more syllables. You probably\nknow that a syllable is like a beat in the rhythm of the word, so you know that ball has one syllable, basket has two\nsyllables, and bicycle has three.\nBut what is a syllable, in phonetic terms? A syllable is a peak of sonority that is surrounded by less sonorous\nsounds. What that means is that a syllable is made up of a vowel, or some other very sonorous sound, with some\nsounds before it and after it that are less sonorous, usually glides and consonants. The most sonorous sound, the\npeak of sonority, is called the nucleus of a syllable. 2.5 SONORITY, CONSONANTS, AND VOWELS 45\nLooking back at those words, we can see that the word ball contains the sonorous vowel sound [\u0251], with two\nless-sonorous consonants, [b] and [l] on each side of it. Likewise, basket has two vowel sounds [\u00e6] and [\u026a], with\nthe consonants [b] before the first syllable, [sk] between the two vowels, and [t] after the second vowel. Can you\nfigure out what the vowel and consonant sounds are in the word bicycle? Remember that written letters don\u2019t\nnecessarily map directly onto speech sounds! 2.6 Classifying Consonants\nConsonants are classified according to how they are produced. The articulatory description for each consonant includes\nthree pieces of information, the voicing, the place of articulation, and the manner of articulation.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=48\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nLet\u2019s look more closely at the class of sounds we call consonants. Remember that consonants have some\nconstriction in the vocal tract that obstructs the airflow, either partially or completely. We can classify consonants\naccording to three pieces of information.\nThe first piece of information we need to know about a consonant is its voicing \u2014 is it voiced or voiceless? In\nthe video about how humans produce speech, we felt the difference between voiced and voiceless sounds: for\nvoiced consonants like [z] and [v], the vocal folds vibrate. For voiceless sounds like [s] and [f], the vocal folds are\nheld apart to let air pass through.\nThe second thing we need to know about consonants is where the obstruction in the vocal tract occurs; we call\nthat the place of articulation.\nIf we obstruct our vocal tract at the lips, like for the sounds [b] and [p], the place of articulation is bilabial.\nThe consonants [f] and [v] are made with the top teeth on the bottom lip, so these are called\nlabiodental sounds.\nMove your tongue to the ridge above and behind your top teeth and make a [t] or [d]; these are\nalveolar sounds. Many people also make the sound [s] with the tongue at the alveolar ridge. Even though there is\nquite a bit of variation in how people make the sound [s], it still gets classified as an alveolar sound.\nIf you\u2019re making a [s] and move the tongue farther back, not quite to the soft palate, the sound turns into a [\u0283],\nwhich is called post-alveolar, meaning it\u2019s a little bit behind the alveolar ridge. You also sometimes see [\u0283] and [\u0292]\ncalled \u201calveo-palatal\u201d or \u201cpalato-alveolar\u201d sounds because the place of articulation is between the alveolar ridge\nand the palate.\nThe only true palatal sound that English has is [j].\nAnd if you bring the back of your tongue up against the back of the soft palate, the velum, you produce the\nvelar sounds [k] and [\u0261].\nSome languages also have uvular and pharyngeal sounds made even farther back in the throat, but English\ndoesn\u2019t have sounds at those places of articulation.\nAnd of course English has a glottal fricative made right at the larynx, the sound [h].\nIn addition to knowing where the vocal tract is obstructed, to classify consonants we also need to know how the\nvocal tract is obstructed. This is called the manner of articulation.\nIf we obstruct the airflow completely, the sound is called a stop. When the airflow is stopped, pressure builds\nup in the vocal tract and then is released in an burst of air when we release the obstruction. So the other name 48 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nfor stops is plosives. English has two bilabial stops, [p] and [b], two alveolar stops, [t] and [d], and two velar stops\n[k] and [\u0261].\nIt\u2019s also possible to obstruct the airflow in the mouth but allow air to flow through the nasal cavity. English has\nthree nasal sounds at those same three places of articulation: the bilabial nasal [m], the alveolar nasal [n], and\nthe velar nasal [\u014b]. Because airflow is blocked in the mouth for these, they are sometimes called nasal stops, in\ncontrast to the plosives which are oral stops.\nInstead of blocking airflow completely, it\u2019s possible to hold the articulators close together and allow air to\nflow turbulently through the small space. Sounds with this kind of turbulence are called fricatives. English has\nlabiodental fricatives [f] and [v], dental fricatives made with the tongue between the teeth, [\u03b8] and [\u00f0], alveolar\nfricatives [s] and [z], post-alveolar fricatives [\u0283] and [\u0292], and the glottal fricative [h]. Other languages also have\nfricatives at other places of articulation.\nIf you bring your articulators close together but let the air flow smoothly, the resulting sound is called an\napproximant. The glides [j] and [w] are classified as approximants when they behave like consonants. The palatal\napproximant [j] is made with the tongue towards the palate, and the [w] sound has two places of articulation: the\nback of the tongue is raised towards the velum and the lips are rounded, so it is called a labial-velar approximant.\nThe North American English [\u0279] sound is an alveolar approximant with the tongue approaching the alveolar\nridge. And if we keep the tongue at the alveolar ridge but allow air to flow along the sides of the tongue, we get\nthe alveolar lateral approximant [l], where the word lateral means \u201con the side\u201d. The sounds [\u0279] and [l] are also\nsometimes called \u201cliquids\u201d\nIf you look at the official IPA chart for consonants, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s organized in a very useful way. The places\nof articulation are listed along the top, and they start at the front of the mouth, at the lips, and move gradually\nbackwards to the glottis. And down the left-hand side are listed the manners of articulation. The top of the chart\nhas the manners with the greatest obstruction of the vocal tract, the stops or plosives, and moves gradually down\nto get to the approximants, which have the least obstruction and therefore greatest airflow.\nIn Essentials of Linguistics, we concentrate on the sounds of Canadian English, so we don\u2019t pay as much attention\nto sounds with retroflex, uvular, or pharyngeal places of articulation. You\u2019ll learn more about these if you go on in\nlinguistics. And you probably noticed that there are some other manners of articulation that we haven\u2019t yet talked\nabout.\nA trill involves bringing the articulators together and vibrating them rapidly. North American English doesn\u2019t\nhave any trills, but Scottish English often has a trilled [r]. You also hear trills in Spanish, French and Italian.\nA flap (or tap) is a very short sound that is a bit like a stop because it has a complete obstruction of the vocal\ntract, but the obstruction is so short that air pressure doesn\u2019t build up. Most people aren\u2019t aware of the flap but\nit\u2019s actually quite common in Canadian English. You can hear it in the middle of these words metal and medal.\nNotice that even though they\u2019re spelled with \u201ct\u201d and \u201cd\u201d, they sound exactly the same when we pronounce them in\nordinary speech. If you\u2019re trying hard to be extra clear, you might say [m\u025bt\u0259l] or [m\u025bd\u0259l], but ordinarily, that \u201ct\u201d or\n\u201cd\u201d in the middle of the word just becomes an alveolar flap, where the tongue taps very briefly at the alveolar ridge\nbut doesn\u2019t allow air pressure to build up. You can also hear a flap in the middle of words like middle, water, bottle,\nkidding, needle. The symbol for the alveolar flap [\u027e] looks a bit like the letter \u201cr\u201d but it represents that flap sound.\nWhen we\u2019re talking about English sounds, we also need to mention affricates. If you start to say the word\ncheese, you\u2019ll notice that your tongue is in the position to make a [t] sound. But instead of releasing that alveolar\nstop completely, like you would in the word tease, you release it only partially and turn it into a fricative, [t\u0283]. Same\nthing for the word jam: you start off the sound with the stop [d], and then release the stop but still keep the\narticulators close together to make a fricative [d\u0292]. Affricates aren\u2019t listed on the IPA chart because they\u2019re a double\narticulation, a combination of a stop followed by a fricative. English has only the two affricates, [t\u0283] and [d\u0292], but\nGerman has a bilabial affricate [pf] and many Slavic languages have the affricates [ts] and [dz].\nTo sum up, all consonants involve some obstruction in the vocal tract. We classify consonants according to\nthree pieces of information: 2.6 CLASSIFYING CONSONANTS 49\n\u2022 the voicing: is it voiced or voiceless,\n\u2022 the place of articulation: where is the vocal tract obstructed, and\n\u2022 the manner of articulation: how is the vocal tract obstructed.\nThese three pieces of information make up the articulatory description for each speech sound, so we can talk\nabout the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] or the voiced velar stop [\u0261], and so on. 2.7 Classifying Vowels\nVowels are made without an obstruction in the vocal tract, so they are quite sonorous. The body of the tongue moves in\nthe mouth to shape each vowel, and for some vowels, the lips are rounded as well. Linguists classify vowels according to four\npieces of information: tongue height, tongue backness, lip rounding, and tenseness.\n50 2.7 CLASSIFYING VOWELS 51\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=51\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nRemember that the difference between consonants and vowels is that consonants have some obstruction in\nthe vocal tract, whereas, for vowels, the vocal tract is open and unobstructed, which makes vowel sounds quite\nsonorous. We can move the body of the tongue up and down in the mouth and move it closer to the back or\nfront of the mouth. We can also round our lips to make the vocal tract even longer.\nTake a look at the IPA chart for vowels. Instead of a nice rectangle, it\u2019s shaped like a trapezoid. That\u2019s because\nthe chart is meant to correspond in a very direct way with the shape of the mouth and the position of the tongue\nin the mouth. We classify vowels according to four pieces of information:\nThe high/mid/low distinction has to do with how high the tongue is in the mouth. Say this list of words:\nbeet, bit, bait, bet, bat\nNow do the same thing, but leave off the \u201cb\u201d and the \u201ct\u201d and just say the vowels. You can feel that your tongue\nis at the front of your mouth and is moving from high in the mouth for [i] to fairly low in the mouth for [\u00e6].\nWe can do the same thing at the back of the mouth. Say the words boot, boat.\nNow do it again with just the vowels, [u] [o]. Your lips are rounded for both of them, but the tongue is higher for\n[u] than it is for [o]. The lowest vowel at the back of the mouth is [\u0251]. We don\u2019t round our lips for [\u0251], and we often\ndrop the jaw to move the tongue low and back.\nWe also classify vowels according to whether the lips are rounded or unrounded. In Canadian English, there are\nonly four vowels that have lip rounding, and they\u2019re all made with the tongue at the back of the mouth:\n[u] as in boot\n[\u028a] as in book\n[o] as in boat\nand [\u0254] as in bore 52 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nThe final piece of information that we use to classify vowels is a little trickier to explain. English makes a\ndistinction between tense and lax vowels, which is a distinction that a lot of other languages don\u2019t have. Tense\nvowels are made with greater tension in the muscles of the vocal tract than lax vowels. To feel this difference, say\nthe two words sheep and ship. And now make just the vowel sounds, [i], [\u026a]. The [i] sound in sheep and the [\u026a] sound\nin ship are both produced with the tongue high and front, and without lips rounded. But for [i], the muscles are\nmore tense than for [\u026a]. The same is true for the vowels in late and let, [e] and [\u025b]. And also for the vowels in food\nand foot, [u] and [\u028a]\nIt can be hard to feel the physical difference between tense and lax vowels, but the distinction is actually an\nimportant one in the mental grammar of English. When we observe single-syllable words, we see a clear pattern\nin one-syllable words that don\u2019t end with a consonant. There are lots of monosyllabic words with tense vowels as\ntheir nucleus, like\nday, they, weigh\nfree, brie, she, tea\ndo, blue, through, screw\nno, toe, blow\nBut there are no monosyllabic words without a final consonant that have a lax vowel as their nucleus. And if\nwe were to try to make up a new English word, we couldn\u2019t do so. We couldn\u2019t create a new invention and name it\na [v\u025b] or a [fl\u026a] or a [m\u028a]. These words just can\u2019t exist in English. So the tense/lax distinction is an example of one\nof those bits of unconscious knowledge we have about our language \u2014 even though we\u2019re not consciously aware\nof which vowels are tense and which ones are lax, our mental grammar still includes this powerful principle that\ngoverns how we use our language.\nHere\u2019s one more useful hint about tense and lax vowels. When you\u2019re looking at the IPA chart\n, notice that the symbols for the tense vowels are the ones that\nlook like English letters, while the symbols for the lax vowels are a little more unfamiliar. That can help you\nremember which is which!\nSo far, all the vowels we\u2019ve been talking about are simple vowels, where the shape of the articulation stays\nfairly constant throughout the vowel. In the next unit, we\u2019ll talk about vowels whose shape changes. For simple\nvowels, linguists pay attention to four pieces of information:\n\u2022 tongue height,\n\u2022 tongue backness,\n\u2022 lip rounding, and\n\u2022 tenseness. 2.8 Diphthongs\nDiphthongs are complex vowel sounds in which the tongue moves from one position to another to make a vowel that\nchanges from one sound to another.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=53\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nThe last unit talked about simple vowels, where the tongue position stays pretty constant throughout the duration\nof the vowel. In addition to simple vowels, many languages include diphthongs, where we move our articulators\nwhile producing the vowel. This gives the sound a different a different shape at the end from how it begins. The\nword diphthong comes from the Greek word for \u201ctwo sounds\u201d.\nThere are three major diphthongs in English that have quite a noticeable change in the quality of the vowel\nsound.\nSay these English words out loud: fly, tie, ride, smile. Now make the vowel sound [a\u026a] again but hold it at the\nbeginning [aaa]. The first part of the sound is the low front [a], but then the tongue moves up quickly at the end of\nthe sound, ending it [\u026a]. So the [a\u026a] sound is a diphthong, and it gets transcribed with two consecutive symbols:[a\u026a].\nIn the words now, loud, brown, the tongue again starts low and front [a], and then it moves high and to the back\nof the mouth, and the lips get rounded too! The second part of this diphthongs is but the high back rounded [\u028a].\nThe [a\u028a] diphthong is transcribed like this: [a\u028a].\nThe third major diphthong in English occurs in words like toy, boil, coin. It starts with the tongue at the back of\nthe mouth and lips rounded [\u0254], then moves to the front with lips unrounded. It is transcribed like this: [\u0254\u026a].\nSome linguists also consider the vowel sound in cue and few to be a diphthong. In this case, the vowel sound\nstarts with the glide [j] and then moves into the vowel [u].\nIn addition to these major English diphthongs, speakers of Canadian English also have a tendency to turn the\nmid-tense vowels into diphthongs.\nFor example, let\u2019s look at the pair of vowels [e] and [\u025b] from the words gate and get. They\u2019re both mid, front,\nunrounded vowels, but [e] is tense \u2013 it\u2019s made with greater tension in the muscles of the vocal tract than [\u025b].\nCanadian English speakers pronounce the lax vowel in get as a simple vowel [\u0261\u025bt], but for the tense vowel, we\ntend to move the tongue up at the end: [\u0261e\u026at]. We do it so systematically that it\u2019s very hard for us to hear it, but it\u2019s\nalways there.\nWe do the analogous thing for the mid-back vowel [o] like in show and toe: at the end of the [o] vowel, the\ntongue moves up a little bit so we produce the vowel as [o\u028a]. Notice that the lips are rounded for both parts of this\ndiphthong.\nTo sum up, a diphthong is a vowel sound that involves movement of the tongue from one position to\nanother. Nearly all dialects of English include the three major diphthongs [a\u026a] , [a\u028a] , and [\u0254\u026a]. These ones are\ncalled the major diphthongs because they involve large movements of the tongue. 2.8 DIPHTHONGS 55\nIn Canadian English, speakers also regularly produce diphthongs for the tense vowels, [e\u026a] and [o\u028a], but not all\nEnglish dialects do this. Some linguists consider these ones to be minor diphthongs. 2.9 Various Accents of English\nAdapted from\nhttp://www.oercommons.org/courses/how-language-works-the-cognitive-science-of-linguistics/view\n\u00a9 2006. Indiana University and Michael Gasser.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation\nLicense, Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nURL: www.indiana.edu/~hlw/PhonProcess/accents.html\nEdition 3.0; 2006-12-31\nIn this section, we look at various English accents and how they differ from one another. Remember that an\naccent is the set of pronunciation conventions of some speech community. Where we draw the boundaries\nbetween accents is pretty arbitrary; if we call General American a single accent, for example, we\u2019ll have to deal\nwith the range of variation that exists among speakers within that large community. And any boundaries we\ndraw will be wrong in another sense because the group of people who have one pronunciation convention may\nnot coincide neatly with the group of people who have the other set of conventions that belong to the accent\nwe\u2019re considering. For example, the group of speakers who pronounce the words pin and pen the same includes\nspeakers of Southern US accent but also some speakers of General American, which is a very different accent\nfrom Southern US English in many other ways. The point is that conventions of pronunciation tend to cluster\ntogether; this is what allows us to talk about \u201caccents\u201d at all.\nAnother point to keep in mind is that in most countries there is a standard, prestige accent alongside a number\nof accents associated with particular regions, social classes, or ethnic groups. Each of these non-standard accents\ncan be described in its \u201cbroad\u201d form, the form that is most different from the standard in the country where\nit is spoken, but what many people are speaking much of the time is something in between a particular non-\nstandard accent and the relevant standard. In this section, we concentrate mostly on broad variants of non-\nstandard accents because they illustrate the range of possible differences best.\nWhen comparing two dialects or accents, one possibility is to see one of them as deviating from the other.\nA biased view of non-standard dialects often starts this way: the speakers of these dialects are seen as just\nmaking mistakes with the standard when what they say is non-standard. But of course, this is not what is actually\nhappening. Speakers of non-standard dialects learned the conventions of these dialects by hearing other speakers\nspeak them, just as the speakers of standard dialects learned the conventions of their dialects. They are no more\nspeaking the standard wrong than the speakers of the standard dialect are speaking their dialect wrong.\n56 2.9 VARIOUS ACCENTS OF ENGLISH 57\nOVERVIEW OF ENGLISH ACCENTS\nBefore looking at examples of differences between accents, it might help to have a sense of what the major\naccents are and where they\u2019re spoken.\nTHE BRITISH ISLES\nThere is no \u201cBritish\u201d accent. England, Scotland, Ireland, and possibly Wales all have their own unofficial standard\naccents, and the standards of Scotland and Ireland, in particular, are as different from that of England as American\naccents are. The standard, or prestige, accent of England is usually referred to as Received Pronunciation (RP).\nThis is what the royal family, all recent Prime Ministers, and most BBC announcers speak. It is probably what most\nAmericans think of as an \u201cEnglish\u201d accent, though it is spoken as a native accent by no more than about 10% of\nthe English population. It differs most noticeably from General American in the pronunciation of a few vowels and\nin the way [\u0279] is treated following vowels. For example, in RP there would be no [\u0279] sounds at all in the phrase the\nnorthern fourth of the park.\nWithin England, there are many identifiable regional accents, probably more than in the United States in fact.\nAmong these, London accent (sometimes called \u201cCockney\u201d) stands out because it is familiar to many Americans\nthrough film and drama characters such as Eliza Dolittle in Pygmalion/My Fair Lady and because it has a number of\nvery characteristic features. Many of the vowels in this accent differ considerably from RP and General American.\nOther very striking features are the loss of initial [h] (\u201c\u2018e \u2018as an \u2018ard \u2018eart\u201d = \u201che has a hard heart\u201c) and the frequent\nglottal stops in place of other stops in other accents (\u201ci\u0294\u2019ll ta\u0294e a lo\u0294 o\u2019 time to se\u0294le\u201d = \u201cit\u2019ll take a lot of time to\nsettle\u201d). Perhaps the other major accent boundary in England separates the accents of the north from those of\nthe south. Americans may be familiar with the English of Northern England through the speech of the Beatles\nor the characters in films such The Full Monty. These accents can be identified fairly easily because they make\nno distinction between the vowels [\u028c] and [\u028a]; both are pronounced like [\u028a], so that the words look and luck are\nhomophones.\nScottish and Irish English share one feature with northern England English; the tense vowels [i], [u], [e] and [o]\nare not pronounced as diphthongs, as they are in RP and General American. In addition, these accents are like\nGeneral American, and unlike most accents of England, in how they treat [\u0279] after vowels.\nTHE WESTERN HEMISPHERE\nThe unofficial standard accent of the United States is usually called General American (GA) or Mainstream US\nEnglish (MUSE). This is the accent of much of the Midwest and the West and the most frequent accent for US\nnewscasters, though, interestingly, many of the more recent US Presidents have spoken regional varieties rather\nthan GA. As the prestige accent, it has been encroaching on some regional accents, for example, in the northeast,\nbut at the same time, changes within GA are creating what amount to new accents. One striking example of this\nis Northern Cities accent, spoken in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Rochester, and distinct from\nGA in the pronunciation of lax vowels. So for example, the word socks in the name of the Chicago White Sox is\npronounced [saks] in the Northern Cities accent, as compared to [s\u0251ks] in Canadian English.\nThe Southern US accent is spoken by people mainly in the southeastern part of the country. Like the London\naccent, this accent has strikingly different vowels from other English accents. African-American Vernacular English\n(AAVE) is a dialect associated with an ethnic group rather than a region, though of course, you don\u2019t have to be\nAfrican-American to have learned it. The accent associated with this dialect is similar in many ways to Southern US\naccent, while the phonology, morphology and syntax of this variety have their own characteristic properties.\nPeople from the northeastern US are often easy to identify by their accents; the accent of New York City stands 58 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nout within this region, again mostly for its vowels. Some other US cities, especially Pittsburgh, are known for\nparticular pronunciation conventions. In Pittsburgh, for example, [a] may be used where GA has [a\u028a], so downtown\nmay be [dantan].\nStandard Canadian English (except in the province of Newfoundland) is very similar to General American, and it\ndoesn\u2019t vary much from place to place. One characteristic of Canadian English is the pronunciation of [a\u026a] and [a\u028a]\nin certain contexts, which we\u2019ll learn about in Section 4.6.\nEnglish is the native language of much of the Caribbean, with some features common to the region and\nothers specific to particular islands. As with other accents, there are characteristic vowels in these accents, and in\naddition, a tendency in the Caribbean, as there is in some US accents, to make no distinction between [t] and [\u03b8]\nor between [d] and [\u00f0]. Jamaican English in particular also has quite striking intonation patterns.\nTHE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\nEnglish is the native language of most Australians and New Zealanders and a sizable minority of South Africans.\nWhile the standard English accents of these countries tend to approach RP, the broad accents of most English\nspeakers in all three countries have tense vowels similar to those in the London accent. The lax front vowels of\nAustralian and New Zealand English differ from those in other accents.\nNON-NATIVE ACCENTS\nEnglish is spoken as a second language by millions of people, especially in regions that were once colonized by\nBritain in South Asia and Africa. In some of these regions, there are particular English pronunciation conventions\nthat derive from the phonology of the local languages. For example, in the English of South Asians (Indians,\nPakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Nepalese, Bhutanese, and Maldivians), the alveolar consonants [t], [d], [n],\nand [l] tend to be replaced by retroflex consonants, which are common in the languages of this region. These non-\nnative conventions are one of the ways that English is becoming even more of an international language. 2.10 Classifying Signs\nWe sometimes think that the word phonetics refers exclusively to language sounds, but signed languages like ASL also\nhave phonetics. This unit looks at how signs can be classified according to how they\u2019re produced, the same way we classify\nconsonants and vowels according to how they\u2019re produced.\n59 60 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=548\nCHECK YOURSELF\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nIn this chapter we\u2019ve talked about how the sounds of spoken languages are organized: we classify consonants\naccording to their place & manner of articulation and their voicing, and we classify vowels according to their\ntongue position and whether the lips are rounded. That\u2019s a pretty tidy system for the segments of spoken\nlanguages, which are produced with the mouth (and the articulators and the larynx and the lungs), and perceived\nwith the ears. We haven\u2019t talked yet about signed languages, which are produced with the hands and arms and\n(usually) perceived with the eyes. It turns out that, just like consonants and vowels, the signs in signed languages\ncan be classified according to how they\u2019re produced, along five parameters. Before we talk about the signs\nthemselves, let\u2019s talk a bit more about signed languages in general.\nIt might be that when you hear the phrase \u201csign language\u201d, you think of American Sign Language, or ASL, which\nis the signed language used most widely in North America. But ASL is just one of many signed languages in the\nworld. There\u2019s BSL, or British Sign Language, and LSQ, Langue des signes qu\u00e9becoise, Auslan, and many others.\nThese languages are not mutually intelligible \u2014 in other words, users of BSL don\u2019t necessarily understand ASL\nand vice versa. But all sign languages share some properties with each other, and they also share properties with\nspoken languages, which we\u2019ll examine later in this book.\nYou should know that not everyone who uses a sign language is deaf \u2014 some hearing children acquire sign\nnatively if their parents or other people in their household sign. And many hearing people choose to learn a signed\nlanguage in addition to their spoken language, the same way people might choose to learn Spanish or Korean.\nThe other piece of the story is that not everyone who\u2019s deaf uses a sign language, because of stigma or because\nof language deprivation. When the word deaf is spelled with a lower-case \u2018d\u2019, it\u2019s the medical term for people who\nhave little or no hearing. The word Deaf with an upper-case \u2018D\u2019 is used by people who participate in Deaf culture.\nDeaf culture includes using signed languages, and usually does not perceive deafness as an impairment.\nThis idea that deafness is not a defect can be quite radical in our ableist society where disability is often\nstigmatized. Oralism is the name for the attitude that says that speech is better than sign. Many parents, teachers,\nand even doctors believe that it\u2019s more important for deaf people to learn to speak than to sign. This stigmatizing\nattitude toward signed languages means that it\u2019s quite common for children who are born deaf not to have access\nto any language during those vital first few years of life. The evidence shows that deaf children who are exposed\nto sign from an early age have better outcomes than deaf children who only have access to speech, relying on\nhearing aids and cochlear implants.\nThe stigma towards signed languages is based on faulty assumptions, from attitudes that believe that signed\nlanguages aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d or full languages. But the tools of linguistics reveal that signed languages are just as 2.10 CLASSIFYING SIGNS 61\ncomplex as spoken languages; they have phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. Furthermore,\nneural imaging has revealed that users of sign languages recruit the same areas of the brain for producing and\nunderstanding language as users of spoken languages do.\nSo since we\u2019ve paid attention to how linguists classify the sounds of spoken languages, let\u2019s look at how the\nsigns of signed languages can be classified. First, I need to point out that when we talk about classifying signs,\nwe\u2019re looking at a different level of representation from speech sounds: individual signs correspond to words, not\nto segments like consonants or vowels. But like consonants and vowels, each individual sign includes multiple\nparameters. The five parameters that make up a sign are location, movement, handshape, orientation, and non-\nmanual markers. Each of these parameters can vary independently of the others. Let\u2019s look at them more closely.\nLocation has to do with where the signer articulates the sign, relative to their body. In ASL, or American Sign\nLanguage, almost all signs are articulated above the waist. The two ASL signs for ONION and APPLE differ in their\nlocation: the sign for ONION is articulated next to the eyes, while the sign for APPLE is at the mouth.\nThe movement parameter refers to how the hands and fingers move, and what path they take. Compare the\nASL signs for CAN and SHOES. In both signs, the hands are in the same shape and the same location, but their\nmovement differs. In the sign for CAN, the fists move downward parallel to each other, while in the sign for SHOES,\nthe signer brings the two fists together at the edges.\nThe position of the hands and fingers is called handshape. When I say the position of the hands and fingers,\nI don\u2019t mean where on the body \u2014 that\u2019s location \u2014 but how is the signer configuring them. Let\u2019s look back at\nthe sign for APPLE, which is articulated with a knuckle twisting beside the mouth. Now look at the sign for CANDY.\nInstead of a knuckle, the index finger is pointing at the side of the mouth. The location and movement are the\nsame as for APPLE, but the handshape is different.\nThe orientation of the hands is also important for ASL signs, that is, the direction that the hands are facing.\nCompare the two ASL signs for BALANCE and MAYBE. They\u2019re very similar, but the orientation of the hands is\ndifferent in the two signs.\nThe final parameter that can differ between signs is non-manual markers, that is, the parts of the body that\naren\u2019t the hands. Look here at the sign for LATE, and then look at the sign for NOT YET. What the hands do is\npretty similar in these signs, but for NOT YET, the tongue protrudes. If you made the handsign without the tongue\nmovement, you wouldn\u2019t have the sign for NOT YET \u2014 the non-manual marker is a crucial part of the sign.\nThese are just a very few examples from ASL, but they illustrate that signed languages are just as complex and\njust as systematic as spoken languages. Later in the book, we\u2019ll talk about the morphology and syntax of signed\nlanguages too! Practice Time\nExercise 1.

As accurately as you can, describe the difference between the two\npronunciations using the new vocabulary you\u2019ve learned in Chapter 2.\n(This exercise is adapted from Linguistics 001: Introduction to Linguistics by Mark Liberman. Used with\npermission.) Summary\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ve learned that speaking and listening are the primary linguistic skills, and you\u2019ve started to\nlearn to think about words in terms of their sounds and not their letters. You know the names of the parts of\nthe body that humans use to produce speech, and you know how to classify consonants and vowels according to\nhow they\u2019re produced. In the next Chapter, you\u2019ll get more practice at using the International Phonetic Alphabet\nto transcribe the sounds of Canadian English.\n64 CHAPTER 3: TRANSCRIBING SPEECH\nSOUNDS\nNow that you know how humans use their articulators to produce speech, and how linguists classify speech\nsounds, you\u2019re ready to learn how to use the International Phonetic Alphabet to transcribe speech sounds. In this\nchapter, we learn some of the principles for doing a phonetic transcription of the sounds of Canadian English.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 distinguish between broad and narrow transcription,\n\u2022 use the IPA to transcribe words and sentences of Canadian English,\n\u2022 recognize some of the predictable processes that affect speech sounds and narrow transcription.\n65  3.1 Broad and Narrow Transcription\nLearning to use the IPA to transcribe speech can be very challenging, for many reasons. One reason we\u2019ve already\ntalked about is the challenge of ignoring what we know about how a word is spelled to pay attention to how the\nword is spoken. Another challenge is simply remembering which symbols correspond to which sounds. The tables\nin Units 2.4 and 3.2 may seem quite daunting, but the more you practice, the better you\u2019ll get at remembering the\nIPA symbols.\nA challenge that many beginner linguists face is deciding exactly how much detail to include in their IPA\ntranscriptions. For example, if you know that Canadian English speakers tend to diphthongize the mid-tense\nvowels [e] and [o] in words like say and show, should you transcribe them as the diphthongs [e\u026a] and [o\u028a]? And\nthe segment [p] in the word apple doesn\u2019t sound quite like the [p] in pear; how should one indicate that? Does the\nword manager really begin with the same syllable that the word human ends with?\nPart of learning to transcribe involves making a decision about exactly how much detail to include in your\ntranscription. If your transcription includes enough information to identify the place and manner of articulation\nof consonants, the voicing of stops and fricatives, and the tongue and lip position for vowels, this is usually\nenough information for someone reading your transcription to be able to recognize the words you\u2019ve transcribed.\nA transcription at this level is called a broad transcription.\nBut it\u2019s possible to include a great deal more detail in your transcription, to more accurately represent the\nparticulars of accent and dialect and the variations in certain segments. A transcription that includes a lot of\nphonetic detail is called a narrow transcription. The rest of this chapter discusses the most salient details that\nwould be included in a narrow transcription of the most widespread variety of Canadian English.\n67 3.2 IPA for Canadian English\nFULL INTERNATIONAL PHONETIC ALPHABET\nYou can see the official version of the full IPA chart on the website of the International Phonetic Association here.\nIn Essentials of Linguistics, we concentrate on the IPA symbols for transcribing the speech sounds of Canadian\nEnglish.\nCANADIAN ENGLISH CONSONANTS\nFigure 1 shows the IPA symbols for the consonants in Canadian English:\nRemember that this table lists the manner of articulation from top to bottom in order of how obstructed the\nvocal tract is: the greatest obstruction is for stop consonants, and the least obstruction is for approximants. And\nfrom left to right, the table depicts a place of articulation, starting at the front of the mouth with the bilabial sounds\nand moving all the way back to the glottis. When there are two symbols given in one cell, the one on the left is\nvoiceless and the one on the right is voiced.\nThere are three speech sounds that are part of Canadian English that don\u2019t fit neatly into this table. Remember\n68 3.2 IPA FOR CANADIAN ENGLISH 69\nthat affricates have a two-part manner of articulation: they begin with a complete obstruction of the vocal tract,\nbut that obstruction is released only partially. You can think of an affricate like a stop combined with a fricative,\nand the symbols that we use to transcribe them reflect that. Because they have a two-part manner of articulation,\nthe affricates [t\u0283] and [d\u0292] don\u2019t fit into the consonant chart. The other sound that doesn\u2019t fit on the chart is the\napproximant [w]. It has two places of articulation: the lips are rounded, and the body of the tongue moves towards\nthe velum. So the IPA\u2019s name for the segment [w] is a labial-velar approximant.\nCANADIAN ENGLISH VOWELS\nFigure 2 shows the IPA symbols for the vowels of Canadian English:\nRemember that the vowel trapezoid is meant to correspond to the position of the tongue in the mouth. 3.3 Stress and Suprasegmental Information\nIn addition to segmental information about speech sounds, many languages make use of prosody or suprasegmental\ninformation. Suprasegmental information includes the pitch, loudness, and length of sounds, and these factors contribute to\nthe rhythm and stress patterns of spoken language.\n70 3.3 STRESS AND SUPRASEGMENTAL INFORMATION 71\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

But when we speak, we also include sounds that are above or beyond the level of the segments.\nThis sound information is called prosody, or suprasegmental information, and it makes up the rhythm, timing,\nmeter, and stress of the words and sentences that we speak. The primary pieces of suprasegmental information\nare the pitch of sounds, the loudness, and the length.\nThe pitch of a sound is how high or low it is. We produce high pitched sounds when our vocal folds have a high-\nfrequency vibration, and when our vocal folds vibrate more slowly, the resulting sound is lower in pitch.\nSome languages use pitch information to signal changes in word meaning. If a language uses pitch this way, the\npitch information is called tone. These example words are from Yoruba, a language spoken in Nigeria. If you look\njust at the segmental level, these words all seem to be transcribed the same. But speakers of Yoruba vary their\npitch when they speak these words so that the meaning of the word changes depending on whether the second\nsyllable has a high tone, a mid-tone, or a low tone. Probably the best-known tone language is Mandarin, which\nhas five different tones. Looking at these five words, you can see that they contain the same segments, but it\u2019s the\ntones that distinguish their meaning.\nLanguages also use pitch in another way, not to change word meaning, but to signal information at the level\nof the discourse, or to signal a speaker\u2019s emotion or attitude. When pitch is used this way, it\u2019s called intonation\nrather than tone. English uses pitch for intonation \u2014 let\u2019s look at some examples.\nSam got an A in Calculus.\nSam got an A in Calculus!\nSam got an A in Calculus?\nSam? got an A? in Calculus? 72 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nAll of these sentences contain the same words (and the same segments) but if we vary the intonation, we convey\nsomething different about the speaker\u2019s attitude towards the sentence\u2019s meaning. Notice that we sometimes use\npunctuation in our writing to give some clues about a sentence\u2019s prosody.\nAnother component of suprasegmental information is the length of sounds. Some sounds are longer than\nothers. Listen carefully to these two words in English. beat, bead. The vowel sound in both words is the high front\ntense vowel [i]. But in bead, the vowel is a little longer. This is a predictable process in English \u2014 vowels get longer\nwhen there\u2019s a voiced sound in the coda of the syllable. The diacritic to indicate that a segment is long looks a bit\nlike a colon [i\u02d0].\nSo a sound can change in length as the result of a predictable articulatory process, or, like intonation, length\ncan signal discourse-level information about an utterance. Consider the difference between, That test was\neasy, and, That test was eeeeeeeeeeeeeaaasyyyyyyyy. Some languages use length contrastively, that is, to change\nthe meaning of a word. In these words in Yapese, a language of the Western Pacific region, you can see that\nmaking a vowel long leads to a completely different word with a new meaning. In these words from Italian,\nconsonant length can change the meaning of a word, so fato means fate, but fatto means fact.\nIn English, pitch, loudness and length also contribute to the stress pattern in words. English words that are\nlonger than one syllable usually alternate between stressed and unstressed syllables. Stressed syllables are more\nprominent than unstressed syllable, and what makes them prominent is that they\u2019re louder, longer, and higher in\npitch than unstressed syllables. Here are some examples.\nThe words happy, music, sweater have primary stress on the first syllable, while the words beside, around, descend\nare stressed on the second syllable. If you\u2019re having a hard time hearing the stress difference, try humming the\nwords to hear the difference in pitch. Stress on the first syllable sounds like this [humming] and stress on the\nsecond syllable sounds like this [humming].\nBeing able to identify stressed syllables is important when we\u2019re learning to do phonetic transcription, because\nin English, stressed syllables usually get pronounced with a full vowel, while the vowel in unstressed syllables\ngets reduced. What does it mean to be reduced? That short mid-central vowel that has the name schwa and the\nsymbol [\u0259] like an upside-down \u201ce\u201d is the most neutral vowel in English. So the \u201cuh\u201d sound in the first syllable of\nbanana gets transcribed with a schwa because it\u2019s unstressed, but the \u201cuh\u201d in bunny gets a full vowel because it\u2019s in\na stressed syllable. We\u2019ll see later in this chapter that stress makes a difference to alveolar stops and to aspirated\nconsonants as well!\nTo sum up, suprasegmental information, also known as prosody, is that sound information that\u2019s above the level\nof the segment. It consists of pitch, loudness, and length. Many languages use prosody to provide discourse-level\ninformation, and some languages also use prosody to change word meanings. 3.4 Syllable Structure\nCATHERINE ANDERSON\nSpoken words are made up of syllables, but syllables also have internal structure. This unit looks at how the mental grammar\norganizes consonants and vowels inside syllables.\n73 74 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=459\nCHECK YOURSELF\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=459\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nIn a previous unit we saw that a syllable is a peak of sonority surrounded by less sonorous sounds. We know that\nsonority is acoustic energy, and now that we understand how speech is produced, we know that the most\nsonorous sounds, the ones that have the most acoustic energy, are the sounds that are produced with the vocal\ntract unobstructed. The most sonorous sounds are vowels. Consonants, on the other hand, have an obstruction\nin the vocal tract so they\u2019re less sonorous. So we might also think of a syllable as a vowel surrounded by some\nconsonants. That\u2019s a good beginning definition, but it\u2019s a little more complex than that, as we\u2019ll see in this unit\nand the next.\nOur mental grammar doesn\u2019t just organize words into syllables, but it also\nstructures what\u2019s inside a syllable. Let\u2019s take a look. The name for the most\nsonorous part of a syllable is the nucleus. In a typical syllable, the nucleus will be\na vowel, produced with an unobstructed vocal tract. The segments that come\nbefore the nucleus are called the onset, and if there are any segments after the\nnucleus they\u2019re called the coda. The nucleus and coda together form a unit that\nwe call the rhyme, and linguists like to use the Greek letter sigma (\u03c3) to label the\nentire syllable.\nLet\u2019s look at how this works in some English words. When we say a word is \u201cmonosyllabic\u201d that just means that\nit has one syllable. We\u2019ll start with a nice simple word like big [b\u026a\u0261]. The nucleus is the most sonorous part, so in\nthis word, the vowel [\u026a] is the nucleus. The consonant that comes after the vowel nucleus [\u0261] is the coda, and the\nconsonant that comes before [b] is the onset. The only part of a syllable that always has to be there is the nucleus.\nSome syllables have an onset but no coda, like the word day [de\u026a], and some syllables have a coda but not onset, 3.4 SYLLABLE STRUCTURE 75\nlike the word eat [it]. And the occasional syllable has neither an onset nor a coda, just a nucleus, like the word I\n[a\u026a]!\nWhat about a single-syllable word that has more consonants in it? Let\u2019s look at screens. Again, the vowel [i] is\nthe nucleus of this syllable, and the consonants [nz] that come after the nucleus form the coda. There are three\nconsonants [sk\u0279] before the nucleus, and they form the onset. When there\u2019s a group of consonants in the onset or\ncoda we call them a cluster.\nMonosyllabic words are pretty straightforward. How does it work with words that have more than one syllable,\nlike raptor? It\u2019s got two syllables, so it has two nuclei [\u00e6] [\u0259]. The consonant at the beginning of the word [\u0279] is the\nonset of the first syllable, and the consonant at the end of the word [\u0279] is obviously the coda of the second syllable.\nWhat about these two consonants in the middle? In the word raptor, the [p] is the coda of the first syllable and [t]\nis the onset of the second syllable, but there are other logical possibilities. We could just as easily say that the first\nsyllable has a coda cluster [pt], or that the second syllable has an onset cluster [pt]. How does the mental grammar\norganize consonants in the middle of a multi-syllabic word?\nWell, it\u2019s not random, and the mental grammar doesn\u2019t just try to distribute consonants evenly. There\u2019s a\nsystematic principle that operates in the mental grammar, which is that onsets are greedy. To see what that\nmeans, let\u2019s look at a word that has a bunch of consonants in the middle, like emblem. There are three consonants\n[mbl] in the middle of this word, so there are four logical possibilities for how they could be organized. It could be\nthat all the consonants go in the onset of the second syllable. It could be that they all go in the coda of the first\nsyllable, or they could be divided up between the coda of the first and the onset of the second, with a couple of\npossible permutations. What does the mental grammar do with these consonants?\nThe principle that onsets are greedy means that an onset will take as many consonants as it can. So this first\noption here has the greediest onset: it has the greatest number of consonants in an onset position. But it looks\npretty weird, doesn\u2019t it, to have a syllable start with [mbl]? A greedy onset takes as many consonants as it can\nwithin the grammar of that language. It\u2019s a principle of English grammar that words don\u2019t begin with a cluster like\n[mbl], and neither do syllables. Of these four options, the one that has the greediest onset that is possible within\nEnglish is this one: the [m] is the coda of the first syllable, and the consonant cluster [bl] is the onset of the second\nsyllable.\nLet\u2019s look at one more example to illustrate this idea that onsets are greedy. Consider the word ugly. The two\nvowels [\u028c] [i] form the two nuclei of the syllables; there\u2019s no onset for the first syllable, and no coda for the second\nsyllable. So there are three logical possibilities for these middle consonants [\u0261l] \u2014 they could both be the coda;\nthey could both be the onset; or they could split the difference. Which does the mental grammar do? The onset is\ngreedy, so it wants to take as many consonants as it can. We know that [\u0261l] is a possible onset in English, because\nthere are lots of words that start with [\u0261l], like glue, glass, glamour. So because [\u0261l] is a possible, grammatical onset\ncluster in English, the onset of the second syllable takes all of it, and leaves no consonants in the coda of the first\nsyllable.\nLet\u2019s sum up. Syllables are units within words, and they also have an inner structure of their own. Every syllable\nhas a nucleus, which is the most sonorous part of the syllable: a vowel or another sonorous sound. If there are\nconsonants, which are less sonorous, they make up the onset and coda of the syllable. And in the middle of a\nword, onsets are greedy: they\u2019ll take as many consonants as they can, within the constraints of the grammar of\nthe language. 3.5 Syllabic Consonants\nWe defined a syllable as a peak of sonority surrounded by less sonorous sounds. In most cases, the peak of sonority, that\nis, the nucleus of a syllable, is a vowel because vowels are the most sonorous sounds. But in some conditions, a sonorous\nconsonant, a nasal or a liquid, can be the nucleus of a syllable. In those cases, the consonant is transcribed with a special\ndiacritic to indicate its syllabic status.\n76 3.5 SYLLABIC CONSONANTS 77\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

We said that a syllable has a nucleus:\nthe peak of sonority, which is surrounded by less sonorous sounds. We already know that vowels are the most\nsonorous sounds, so most syllables have a vowel as the nucleus. We know that glides are also fairly sonorous,\nbut they\u2019re too short to serve as the nucleus of a syllable. Thinking about all the consonant sounds we know,\nsome of them are more sonorous than others. Stops are not very sonorous because they have so little airflow\nbecause the vocal tract is completely obstructed. And fricatives also aren\u2019t very sonorous because of the\nobstruction in the vocal tract. But nasal consonants are quite sonorous because the airflow resonates through\nthe nasal cavity even when the oral cavity is stopped. And the liquids, [l] and [\u0279\u0279], are also quite sonorous because\nair is allowed to flow around the tongue.\nThese sonorous consonants can sometimes serve as the nucleus of a syllable in their own right. In other words,\nthere are some syllables that don\u2019t have a vowel at all, just a sonorous consonant. Let\u2019s look at some examples.\nIn the word rhythm, the second syllable is unstressed, and it\u2019s pretty short. Most of the time, in ordinary rapid\nspeech, that second syllable doesn\u2019t have a vowel in it at all. Our articulators go right from the [\u00f0] sound at the\nend of the first syllable into the [m] sound. The [m] itself becomes the nucleus of the syllable. It is said to be a\nsyllabic consonant, and we use a special notation to transcribe it: [\u0279\u026a\u00f0m\u0329]. Look at that little vertical line below the\n[m] symbol \u2014 that\u2019s called a diacritic. Diacritics are special additional notations we add to IPA symbols to give\nextra information about the sounds. That vertical line is the diacritic for a syllabic consonant.\nHere\u2019s an example of a liquid consonant becoming syllabic. When we speak the word funnel, we don\u2019t produce a\nvowel in the second, unstressed syllable. Instead, we pronounce the [l] as a syllabic [l\u0329], so that it is the nucleus of\nthe syllable. The notation is the same, with the diacritic for the syllabic [l\u0329]: [f\u028cnl\u0329]. 3.6 Aspirated Stops in English\nNot all stops are pronounced the same way. Native speakers of English produce the voiceless stops [p, t, k] as aspirated in\nsome environments, but unaspirated in other environments. This unit deals with the systematic, predictable environments in\nEnglish where aspiration occurs on voiceless stops.\n78 3.6 ASPIRATED STOPS IN ENGLISH 79\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

When we make a narrow transcription, we\u2019re including as much detail as possible about how\nspeakers produce sounds, which often means including diacritics. To give an accurate narrow transcription of\nCanadian English, we would have to include a property that is part of nearly every variety of English \u2013 aspiration\non voiceless stops.\nTo illustrate what aspiration is, I\u2019m going to ask you to say a silly sentence: The spy wanted to buy a blueberry pie.\nNow say it again, and hold your hand in front of your mouth. The spy wanted to buy a blueberry pie.\nDid you feel any differences between the words spy, buy and pie? For native speakers of English, the word pie\nis produced with a little puff of air as the [p] is released. That puff of air is called aspiration. English speakers\nsystematically produce aspiration on voiceless stops at the beginning of a stressed syllable, but not on voiced\nstops. To understand why we have to think about voicing and about the manner of articulation.\nRemember that voiced sounds are produced by vibrating the vocal folds, whereas voiceless sounds have the\nvocal folds held open so air can pass freely between them. Remember also that producing a stop involves closing\noff the vocal tract completely for a moment, then releasing the obstruction and allowing air to flow freely again.\nThink about the voiced stop at the beginning of the word buy. The lips are closed \u2013 that\u2019s the stop closure \u2013 and\nthe vocal folds start vibrating for the voiced [b]. Then the lips open and the stop is released, and the vocal folds\nkeep vibrating for the diphthong [a\u026a].\nBut in the word pie, things work differently. The lips are closed for the bilabial stop. But because [p] is a voiceless\nstop, the vocal folds are not vibrating. We open the lips to release the stop, but 30 or 40 milliseconds pass before\nwe start vibrating the vocal folds. That 30-40 milliseconds between when the stop closure is released and the\nvoicing begins is called the voice onset time or VOT. In English, voiceless stops in certain positions have a VOT 80 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nof 30-40 milliseconds, so we say that they\u2019re aspirated. But voiced stops have a much shorter VOT, of about 0-10\nmilliseconds. In other words, the vocal folds start vibrating at almost exactly the same time as the stop closure\nis released, so voiced stops in English are unaspirated. The diacritic to indicate aspiration on a stop is a little\nh h h\nsuperscript h, like so: [p , t , k ].\nBut to make matters even more complicated, it\u2019s not all voiceless stops that get aspirated in English \u2013 only\nvoiceless stops at the beginning of a stressed syllable. In words like appear and attack, the voiceless stop isn\u2019t the\nh h\nfirst sound in the word, but it comes at the beginning of a stressed syllable so it gets aspirated. [\u0259p i\u0279] [\u0259t \u00e6k]\nBut in the words apple and nickel, the voiceless stop comes after a stressed syllable and before an unstressed\nsyllable, so it doesn\u2019t get aspirated. [\u00e6p\u0259l] [n\u026ak\u0259l]\nWe don\u2019t aspirate voiceless stops at the ends of words, like in brick. [b\u0279\u026ak]\nAnd we don\u2019t aspirate voiceless stops following an [s], even if they\u2019re at the beginning of a stressed syllable:\nAspiration of voiceless stops is something that native speakers do so regularly and so automatically that it\u2019s\nvery hard for us to perceive it because it\u2019s just always there. To convince you, I\u2019m going to record someone saying\nthis sentence and show you the waveforms. This program is known as a waveform editor. And here\u2019s Kendrick\u2019s\nvoice saying that sentence.\nThe spy wanted to buy a blueberry pie.\nHere\u2019s the waveform: this is a visual representation of the sound waves that Kendrick just produced. See that I\ncan select certain parts of the sentence and play them back. spy, buy, pie\nLook first at buy \u2013 you can see that there\u2019s very a brief silence: that\u2019s where Kendrick\u2019s lips were closed for the\nbilabial stop. Then when he releases his lips the waveform gets nice and big for the sonorous vowel [a\u026a].\nLook over here at pie. You see the same silence where the lips are closed, and the same big waveform for the\nvowel [a\u026a] but before the vowel, there\u2019s this noisy burst of turbulence \u2013 that\u2019s the aspiration.\nAnd now look at spy. We see the turbulence at the beginning for the fricative [s], followed by the silence while\nthe lips are closed and the nice sonorous vowel. But there\u2019s no burst of noise following the release of the lips\nbecause the [p] in spy was not aspirated. In fact, if I select just the -py portion of spy, what does it sound like? To a\nnative speaker of English, this part sounds like buy, because the [p] is unaspirated.\nWhen you\u2019re transcribing words with the voiceless stops [p t k], your challenge will be to figure out if the stops\nare aspirated or unaspirated, so you can indicate the aspiration in your narrow transcription. In most varieties of\nEnglish, aspiration happens in these predictable environments.\n\u2022 Voiceless stops are aspirated at the beginning of a word, and at the beginning of a stressed syllable.\n\u2022 Voiceless stops are unaspirated at the beginning of an unstressed syllable. They\u2019re also unaspirated in\nany other position, like at the end of a syllable or the end of a word.\n\u2022 And even if a syllable is stressed, a voiceless stop is unaspirated if it follows [s].\n\u2022 In English, voiced stops are never aspirated. They\u2019re always unaspirated.\nOne thing that I want you to remember is that this pattern of aspiration is particular to the grammar of English, but\nstops behave differently in other languages. In French and Spanish, for example, voiceless stops are almost always\nunaspirated. And some languages, like Thai, actually have a three-way distinction between voiced, unaspirated\nvoiceless, and aspirated voiceless stops. 3.7 Articulatory Processes: Assimilation\nWhen we speak, we don\u2019t articulate individual segments separate from each other. Our articulators are always moving from\nthe sound they just made to the sound that\u2019s coming up. This means that each speech segment is influenced by the sounds\nthat are near it. When a sound changes some of its properties to be more similar to the nearby sounds, this is known as\nassimilation.\n81 82 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

But we know\nof course that we don\u2019t articulate individual segments when we speak \u2013 we don\u2019t produce the word book as [b] \u2013\n[\u028a] \u2013 [k]. When we\u2019re speaking, our articulators are always moving \u2013 they\u2019re moving away from from the position\nfor the sound they just made, and preparing to make the sound that\u2019s coming up.\nYou can feel this really easily by saying a couple of words. I want you to prepare to say this word, but don\u2019t\nactually say it: just put your mouth in the position to say the word key. Pay attention to how you\u2019re holding your\nmouth. What do you notice? Now get ready to say this word, but don\u2019t actually say it, just freeze in the position:\nh\ncool. What position are your articulators in? Both key and cool start with the voiceless velar stop [k ], so if we\narticulated speech segments individually, we\u2019d expect our mouths to be in the same position for both words. But\nthe vowels in each word are quite different: [i] in key is high and front, and [u] in cool is high, back and rounded.\nSo when we produce that [k] sound, our mouths are already preparing for the next vowel. This is called\ncoarticulation: the articulation of every speech sound is shaped by the sounds that come before and after\nit. When we\u2019re doing detailed, narrow phonetic transcription, we can include details about coarticulation and\nother articulatory processes.\nProbably the most common articulatory process is assimilation. You can guess from its name that it involves\nsounds becoming more similar to each other. Sounds often become more similar to what\u2019s coming up in the\nword. Here\u2019s an example; say the words cat and can. They both have the vowel as the nucleus, but for can, when\nwe produce that [\u00e6] we\u2019re already anticipating the upcoming nasal so we\u2019ve already got the velum lowered to\nallow air into the nasal cavity. So the vowel gets nasalized too \u2014 it gets assimilated to the following nasal. We\ntranscribe a nasal vowel with the diacritic for nasalization, like this:[\u00e6\u0303]. Because this nasalization is in anticipation\nof an upcoming nasal consonant, we call this process anticipatory assimilation: the vowel is becoming more 3.7 ARTICULATORY PROCESSES: ASSIMILATION 83\nsimilar to the sound that follows it. In some books, you might see this called regressive assimilation, since the\nnasal property of the [n] is moving backwards or regressing onto the vowel.\nAssimilation can go in the other direction too: sometimes the properties of one speech segment persevere\ninto the next segment. Say these two words out loud: bleed, please. The two [l] sounds in these two words are a\nlittle different from each other. For bleed, the vocal folds are vibrating for the voiced [b] and they keep vibrating\nto produce the voiced [l]. We know that [l] is usually voiced so there\u2019s nothing remarkable about that. But for\nh\nplease, the vocal folds are held apart for the voiceless [p ]. We start making the [l] before the vocal folds start to\nvibrate, so the [l] becomes voiceless in this context. We say that the [l] following a voiceless stop is devoiced, and\nit gets transcribed with the diacritic for voicelessness, like this: [l\u0325]. In this case, the voiceless property of the [p]\nis persevering; it\u2019s sticking around to have an influence on the [l], so we call it perseveratory assimilation. You\nmight also see this called progressive assimilation because the voicelessness of the first sound progresses, or\nmoves forward, onto the following sound. One thing to note about the diacritic for voicelessness: it only gets used\nwhen a sound that is ordinarily voiced becomes voiceless in one of these articulatory processes. An [l] is usually\nvoiced, so if it gets devoiced it gets the diacritic. But a sound like [h] or [s] is already voiceless, so it wouldn\u2019t make\nany sense to transcribe it with the diacritic.\nSo assimilation can be anticipatory, where a speech sound is influenced in anticipation of the sound that\u2019s\nabout to be spoken after it, or perseveratory, where a sound is influenced by properties persevering, or lingering,\nfrom the sound that was just spoken. 3.8 Other Articulatory Processes\nIn regular, everyday speech, some predictable articulatory processes occur. In predictable contexts, vowels are reduced or\ndeleted. In other contexts, sounds might be inserted or might switch position. Learning to do narrow transcription involves\nknowing where these predictable articulatory processes occur.\n84 3.8 OTHER ARTICULATORY PROCESSES 85\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

There are other articulatory processes that shape the words that we say. Some of\nthese processes occur simply as a result of speaking quickly and naturally. Some of them make speech more clear\nfor a listener. Some of them happen over time within a dialect, as speakers start unconsciously changing the way\nthey produce sounds.\nWhile we were learning to do IPA transcription we talked about vowel reduction. It\u2019s a very common process in\nrapid, natural speech. In English, the vowel in an unstressed syllable often gets reduced to the mid-central vowel\nschwa [\u0259]. This happens in lots of words. For example, we don\u2019t usually pronounce this word electric as [il\u025bkt\u0279\u026ak].\nInstead, because the first syllable is unstressed, the vowel gets reduced, and we say [\u0259l\u025bkt\u0279\u026ak]. Likewise, this word\ntoday doesn\u2019t get pronounced as [tude\u026a]. The vowel in the first, unstressed syllable gets reduced and we say [t\u0259de\u026a].\nIn fact, sometimes an unstressed vowel gets reduced so much that it disappears altogether! This process is\ncalled, obviously, deletion. In some varieties of English, reduced vowels are systematically deleted in certain\npredictable environments, like in police or garage. Deletion can also occur within consonant clusters. It\u2019s pretty\ncommon for speakers to delete the first [\u0279] in surprise or the [d] in Wednesday. Deletion also happens when we\nborrow words from other languages. For example, take the Greek word pteron, which means \u201cwing\u201d. When we\nborrow this word and incorporate it into helicopter, we pronounce both the [p] and the [t]. But when it comes at\nthe beginning of a borrowed word, like pterodactyl, we just delete the [p] altogether, since English doesn\u2019t allow\ntwo stops in a syllable onset.\nSometimes when we\u2019re speaking, extra segments find their way into our words, as a result of coarticulation. Can\nh\nyou guess what word I\u2019m saying? [p \u0279\u026ants] Was it prince or prints? Only one of them is spelled with a \u201ct\u201d, but\nwe pronounce them both the same way. In prince, an alveolar stop appears between the alveolar nasal and the 86 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nalveolar fricative. The articulatory process that inserts an extra sound is called epenthesis. In English, this tends\nto happen between nasals and stops or between nasals and fricatives. Another example is in the word something,\nwhere we often epenthesize a little bilabial stop [p] between the bilabial nasal [m] and the voiceless fricative [\u03b8]. Or\nwhen George W. Bush famously pronounced the word nuclear as [nukj\u0259l\u025a], he was epenthesizing a [j] between\nthe [k] and [l].\nSome articulatory processes result from speech errors. Some of these errors are characteristic of children\u2019s\nspeech, and some of them just occur in everyday rapid speech. Children\u2019s speech often includes the process\nof metathesis, exchanging the position of speech segments. When my niece was little, she used to pronounce\nthe word hospital as [h\u0251st\u026ab\u0259l], exchanging the positions of the two stops. Metathesis can also happen when we\nborrow words from another language. When English speakers want to buy a burrito from the restaurant chain\ncalled Chipotle, we often metathesize the [t] and [l] and say, [t\u0283\u0259polti], because the \u201ctl\u201d sequence is rare in English.\nMany of these articulatory processes are frequent and systematic in natural speech. In the next chapter, we\u2019ll\nsee that they play an important role in our mental grammar. 3.9 Transcribing Casual Speech\nAdapted from:\nhttp://www.oercommons.org/courses/how-language-works-the-cognitive-science-of-linguistics/view\n\u00a9 2006.

What\u2019s appropriate in one context may not be in another. This applies to\npronunciation, as well as to vocabulary and grammar.\nThe dimension we will be concerned with here is sometimes referred to in terms of how \u201ccareful\u201d the speech\nis. The \u201ccare\u201d referred is care on the part of the Speaker. To what extent does the Speaker make an effort to\naccurately produce each of the segments and suprasegmental features of the words? To make sense of this idea,\nwe will have to assume that each word in a dialect has a \u201ccareful\u201d pronunciation, that is, how the word would sound\nif produced in isolation or with some emphasis within a sentence and in a relatively formal setting. In general,\nas the word gets less emphasis and the setting gets more casual, we find a tendency for Speakers to deviate\nfrom the careful pronunciation. These deviations are Speaker-oriented; that is, they can all be seen as making\nthe pronunciation easier in one way or another; they are simplifications. Simplification is possible because in the\ncasual situations where it is most common, the Hearer knows the Speaker well and is better able to predict what\nthe Speaker is saying than a stranger would be. In this unit, we will look at some examples of the simplifications\nthat occur in casual English. We will see that they can often be described in terms of the articulatory processes\nthat we talked about in Units 3.5 and 3.6.\n87 88 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nSYLLABLE STRESS AND VOWELS\nBefore we look at the simplifications that happen in English as speech becomes more casual, we need to look at\nsome basic features of English phonology.\nFirst, in English, as in many languages in which stress plays a major role, there are significant differences\nbetween stressed and unstressed syllables. Stressed syllables permit all of the possible vowel segments, whereas\nthe vowels in unstressed syllables are most commonly produced as [\u0259], [\u0268], or [\u026a]. We can observe these differences\nmost clearly when we look at how the pronunciation of a syllable changes when it becomes stressed or\nunstressed. Consider the second syllables in the following related pairs of words:\nmelody, melodic\nrepeat, repetition\nIn melodic the second syllable is stressed, and the vowel is pronounced [\u0251]. In melody it is unstressed, and the\nvowel is pronounced [\u0259]. In the second pair, the second syllable of repeat is stressed and the vowel is [i], but when\nthe second syllable is unstressed, as in repetition, the vowel is [\u0259].\nSYLLABLE STRESS AND ALVEOLAR STOPS\nWhen a word contains a [t] or [d] in the onset of an unstressed syllable, very often the tongue makes only brief\ncontact with the alveolar ridge, so that instead of a plosive, only a very brief flap [\u027e] is produced. In the following\npairs of words, compare the second consonant.\nmetal, metallic\nmedal, medallion\nIn both metal and medal, the first syllable is stressed and the second is unstressed. Both words are pronounced\nas [m\u025b\u027el\u0329]. But in metallic and medallion, the second syllable is stressed. In the onset of a stressed syllable, the\nh\nsegments are pronounced as [t ] and [d], respectively.\nSIMPLIFICATIONS WITHIN WORDS\nWhen a verb that ends in a vowel takes an affix that begins with a vowel, like in trying, or showing, the vowel in the\nsecond syllable might disappear in casual speech. Likewise, if the past-tense affix -ed or the plural -s is added to a\nword that ends in a cluster of consonants, then some of those consonants might disappear. Some examples are\ngiven below:\ncareful speech casual speech\n[t\u0279a\u026a\u014b] or [t\u0279a\u026an]\ntrying [t\u0279aj\u026a\u014b]\nor [t\u0283\u0279a\u026a\u014b]\nshowing [\u0283ow\u026a\u014b] [\u0283o\u028a\u014b] or [\u0283o\u028an]\nasked [\u00e6skt] [\u00e6st]\nthanked [\u03b8\u00e6\u014bkt] [\u03b8\u00e6\u014bt]\nfifths [f\u026af\u03b8s] [f\u026a\u03b8s]\nIf a word contains the same consonant twice, with only an unstressed vowel in between, the vowel and second\nconsonant are often deleted, as in these examples: 3.9 TRANSCRIBING CASUAL SPEECH 89\ncareful speech casual speech\nprobably [p\u0279\u0251b\u0259bli] [p\u0279\u0251bli]\nnecessary [n\u025bs\u0259s\u025bri] [n\u025bs\u025bri]\nmirror [mi\u0279\u0259\u0279] [mi\u0279]\nSIMPLIFICATIONS ACROSS WORD BOUNDARIES\nOther possible simplifications may occur across the boundaries between words. Consider what happens when an\nalveolar consonant ends up before a [j], as in two places in the following sentence.\nWrittee yyour name on thiss yyellow sheet.\nSpeaking carefully, most people would pronounce the two parts shown in bold as [tj] and[sj]. But when we speed\nup and allow ourselves to simplify, these may become [t\u0283] and [\u0283]. This is an example of assimilation (for more\nexamples, see Unit 3.5). The alveolar and palatal consonants combine to yield single consonants that are at the\npostalveolar place of articulation, in between the original places.\nSIMPLIFICATIONS OF FREQUENT PHRASES\nIf a set of words occur together very frequently, then they can be easily predicted by the hearer, so they are good\ncandidates for simplification by the speaker.\ncareful speech casual speech\nwould have [w\u028ad\u0259]\ngoing to [g\u028an\u0259]\ngot to [g\u0251\u027e\u0259]\nwant to [w\u0251n\u0259]\nhave to [h\u00e6ft\u0259]\nsupposed to [spost\u0259]\nI\u2019m going to [\u00e6\u014bg\u028an\u0259] or [\u00e6m\u028an\u0259]\nWhat did you think?

Many of these\nprocesses are general processes in the language. In some cases, however, the simplifications are conventions\nassociated with particular words and must be learned separately. 3.10 Transcribing Vowels in Canadian English\nThis section clarifies details of the low and mid-vowels, and looks at some of the ways that Canadian English differs from\nAmerican English.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

US textbooks often classify this symbol that looks like a lower-\ncase [a] as a low back vowel, but you probably noticed in an earlier section that this book puts [a] in the low front\nposition and lists this character, known as the script [\u0251], in the low back position. What\u2019s the difference between\nthem? To figure this out, let\u2019s look at a pair of words.\nHow do you pronounce these two words?\nI\u2019m a fairly typical speaker of middle-class, middle-aged Canadian English, and for me, these two words are\nhomophones: they sound exactly the same, whether I\u2019m saying, \u201cI caught the ball\u201d or \u201cI slept on a cot\u201c. Caught/cot.\nSo my dialect has what Linguistics calls the \u201ccaught/cot merger\u201d\u201d. This is pretty typical of Canadian English, but not\nof many other varieties of English.\nIn many varieties of US English, the past tense of the verb catch is pronounced with the low-back [\u0251] like mine,\nbut the noun uses the low front [a], [k\u02b0at]. I like to think of this low front vowel as the Chicago White Sox vowel,\nbecause it\u2019s very typical of Chicago English, where the south-side baseball team is known as the [saks].\nAnd in many of the varieties of English spoken in the UK, the past tense of catch has a mid-back rounded vowel,\n[k\u02b0\u0254t], while the noun version has the low back vowel [k\u02b0\u0251t].\nSince this book concentrates on Canadian English, I\u2019m going to suggest the following convention. When\ntranscribing Canadian English, use the low back vowel that we represent with the script a [\u0251] for the simple vowel\nin words like father, box, and log.\nThe low-front [a] doesn\u2019t usually appear in Canadian English as a simple vowel. It shows up in the major\ndiphthongs, [a\u026a] like in fly, and [a\u028a] as in brown, and it turns up before an [\u0279] as in car or farther.\nAnd this mid-back rounded vowel also doesn\u2019t show up as a simple vowel in Canadian English. It appears in the\ndiphthong [\u0254\u026a] like in coin, and before [\u0279] like fork or short.\nNote that this convention that I\u2019m suggesting does over-simplify the variation that exists in the real world, but\nthat\u2019s ok at this introductory level.\nWith the low vowels taken care of, let\u2019s talk about the mid and central vowels. Think about these two words,\nfunny and phonetics. They start with almost the same syllable, don\u2019t they? But there\u2019s one important difference. In\nfunny, the stress is on the first syllable, while in phonetics, the second syllable is stressed. This has consequences\nfor the vowel in the nucleus of each syllable.\nRemember that we talked about syllable stress in an earlier section. Stressed syllables are more prominent than\nunstressed syllables. They\u2019re louder, longer, and higher in pitch. So stressed syllables get pronounced with full 92 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nvowels. In the word funny, the first syllable has this mid-back unrounded vowel that we represent with the wedge\nsymbol [\u028c]. But when a syllable is unstressed, it gets reduced \u2014 it\u2019s shorter and quieter. That means that speakers\npronounce the vowel with the mid-central reduced vowel that has the funny name schwa [\u0259] and looks like an\nupside-down e.\nYou can hear this stress difference between the \u201cuh\u201d sound in bun and the first syllable of banana, and between\nthe first syllables of apple and apply. So being able to recognize stress is important in producing an accurate\ntranscription.\nSpeaking of unstressed syllables, in an earlier section we talked about what happens when a syllable is so\nreduced that the vowel nucleus disappears entirely and the sonorant consonant from the coda becomes a vowel.\nThis is another oversimplification, but at this intro level let\u2019s treat a syllable with a reduced nucleus as equivalent\nto one that has a syllabic consonant as its nucleus. So we\u2019ll consider these transcriptions on the left as equivalent\nto the ones on the right.\nMany words in English end with an unstressed -er syllable, so [\u0279] is maybe the sonorant that becomes syllabic\nthe most frequently. It just so happens that the IPA also has a way of transcribing a vowel that takes on a rhotic,\nor r-like quality. So in addition to considering the schwa-r transcription as equivalent to the syllabic-r, we\u2019ll also\nconsider the rhotic-schwa transcription to be equivalent. Again, this is an oversimplification, but it makes sense\nfor when you\u2019re first learning to do IPA transcription.\nNow, you already know that schwa is a reduced vowel that only appears in unstressed syllables, so what about\nwhen a word has that \u201cer\u201d sound in a stressed syllable, like in bird? We\u2019ll use a different symbol to represent the\nstressed one: this is the mid-central, unreduced vowel. Notice that looks a lot like the symbol for the mid-front [\u025b]\nvowel, but it faces the opposite direction!\nThe only place this vowel shows up in Canadian English is when it\u2019s rhotic, that is, in a stressed syllable with an\n[\u0279] in the coda. You can hear the difference if you compare the word bird with the second, unstressed syllable in\namber.\nThere\u2019s one more central vowel we need to pay attention to, and that\u2019s the high central vowel that looks like a\nlittle crossed-out lower-case letter i. Again, it has a very predictable distribution in Canadian English. We\u2019ll use it\nonly in unstressed syllables where the syllable is a suffix. For example, the final syllable in heated and excited is a\npast-tense suffix, and the final syllable in horses and quizzes is a plural suffix, so we\u2019ll transcribe them all with this\nhigh central vowel.\nThat\u2019s a lot of details! But paying attention to these subtle differences will develop your phonetic listening skills,\nand your transcription skills. Practice Time\nThe following sentences are all the first lines of books.

You\u2019re starting to see that there can be variability\nin how a given segment is pronounced, even if it gets represented with a single IPA symbol. Articulatory processes\nplay a sizeable role in how speech sounds vary, and suprasegmental information contributes to variability as well.\nIn the next chapter, we\u2019ll see how the mind responds to the variability that our articulators produce.\n94 CHAPTER 4: SPEECH SOUNDS IN\nTHE MIND\nWhile the previous two chapters concentrated on how speech sounds are produced in the mouth, this chapter\nfocuses on how speech sounds are organized in the mind. While two different languages might contain the same\nspeech sounds, the mental grammar of each language could treat those sounds very differently. The challenge\nto studying mental grammar is that we can\u2019t observe the mind directly, so in this chapter, we\u2019ll learn how we can\nobserve language behaviour to draw conclusions about mental grammar.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 analyze language data to determine if segments contrast phonemically,\n\u2022 identify the phonetic environments that lead to allophonic variation in a language,\n\u2022 group speech sounds into natural classes according to the properties they have in common.\n95  4.1 Phonemes and Contrast\nWithin a given language, some sounds might have slight phonetic differences from each other but still be treated as the\nsame sound by the mental grammar of that language. A phoneme is a mental category of sounds that includes some variation\nwithin the category. The mental grammar ignores that variation and treats all members of a phoneme category as the same\nsound.\n97 98 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=84\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nIn the last couple of chapters, we\u2019ve seen lots of ways that sounds can differ from each other: they can vary in\nvoicing, in place and manner of articulation, in pitch or length. Within the mental grammar of each language, some\nof these variations and meaningful and some are not. Each language organizes these meaningful variations in\ndifferent ways. Let\u2019s look at some examples.\nh\nIn the English word please, I could pronounce it with an ordinary voiced [l]: [p liz] it would be a little unnatural\nh\nbut it\u2019s possible. Or, because of perseveratory assimilation, I could devoice that [l] and pronounce it [p l\u0325iz]. We\u2019ve\ngot two slightly different sounds here: both are alveolar lateral approximants, but one is voiced and one is\nh h\nvoiceless. But if I pronounce the word [p liz] or [p l\u0325iz], it means the same thing. The voicing difference in this\nenvironment is not meaningful in English and most people never notice if the [l] is voiced or not.\nIn the words van and fan, each word begins with a labio-dental fricative. In van, the fricative is voiced and in fan\nit\u2019s voiceless. In this case, the difference in voicing is meaningful: it leads to an entirely different word, and all fluent\nspeakers notice this difference! Within the mental grammar of English speakers, the difference between voiced\nand voiceless sounds is meaningful in some environments but not in others.\nHere\u2019s another example. I could pronounce the word free with the ordinary high front tense vowel [i]. Or I could\nmake the vowel extra long, freeeee. (Notice that we indicate a long sound with this diacritic [i\u02d0] that looks a bit like\na colon.) But this difference is not meaningful: In English, both [fri] and [fri\u02d0] are the same word. In Italian, a length\ndifference is meaningful. The word fato means \u201cfate\u201d. But if I take that alveolar stop and make it long, the word\nfatto means a \u201cfact\u201d. The difference in the length of the stop makes [fat\u0254] and [fat\u02d0\u0254] two different words. (N.B.,\nIn the video there\u2019s an error in how these two words are transcribed; it should be with the [a] vowel, not the [\u00e6]\nvowel.) 4.1 PHONEMES AND CONTRAST 99\nSo here\u2019s the pattern that we\u2019re observing. Sounds can vary; they can be different from each other. Some\nvariation is meaningful within the grammar of a given language, and some variation is not.\nUntil now, we\u2019ve been concentrating on phonetics: how sounds are made and what they sound like. We\u2019re now\nstarting to think about phonology, which looks at how sounds are organized within the mental grammar of each\nlanguage: which phonetic differences are meaningful, which are predictable, which ones are possible and which\nones are impossible within each language. The core principle in phonology is the idea of contrast. Say we have\ntwo sounds that are different from each other. If the difference between those two sounds leads to a difference\nin meaning in a given language, then we say that those two sounds contrast in that language.\nSo for example, the difference between fan and van is a phonetic difference in voicing. That phonetic difference\nleads to a substantial difference in meaning in English, so we say that /f/ and /v/ are contrastive in English. And if\ntwo sounds are contrastive in a given language, then those two sounds are considered two different phonemes in\nthat language.\nSo here\u2019s a new term in linguistics. What is a phoneme? A phoneme is something that exists in your mind.\nIt\u2019s a mental category, into which your mind groups sounds that are phonetically similar and gives them all the\nsame label. That mental category contains memories of every time you\u2019ve heard a given sound and labelled it as\na member of that category. You could think of a phoneme like a shopping bag in your mind. Every time you hear\nthe segment [f], your mental grammar categorizes it by putting it in bag labelled /f/. /v/ contrasts with /f/ \u2014 it\u2019s a\ndifferent phoneme, so every time you hear that [v], your mind puts it in a different bag, one labelled /v/.\nIf we look inside that shopping bag, inside the mental category, we might find some phonetic variation. But if\nthe variation is not meaningful, not contrastive, our mental grammar does not treat those different segments as\ndifferent phonemes. In English, we have a phonemic category for /l/, so whenever we hear the segment [l] we store\nit in our memory as that phoneme. But voiceless [l\u0325] is not contrastive: it doesn\u2019t change the meaning of a word, so\nwhen we hear voiceless [l\u0325] we also put it in the same category in our mind. And when we hear a syllabic [l\u0329], that\u2019s\nnot contrastive either, so we put that in the same category. All of those [l]s are a little different from each other,\nphonetically, but those phonetic differences are not contrastive because they don\u2019t lead to a change in meaning,\nso all of those [l]s are members of a single phoneme category in English.\nNow, as a linguist, I can tell you that voiceless [f] and voiced [v] are two different phonemes in English, while\nvoiceless [l\u0325] and voiced [l] are both different members of the same phoneme category in English. But as part of\nyour developing skills in linguistics, you want to be able to figure these things out for yourself. Our question now\nis, how can we tell if two phonetically different sounds are phonemically contrastive? What evidence would we\nneed? Remember that mental grammar is in the mind \u2014 we can\u2019t observe it directly. So what evidence would we\nwant to observe in the language that will allow us to draw conclusions about the mental grammar?\nIf we observe that a difference between two sounds \u2014 a phonetic difference \u2014 also leads to a difference in\nmeaning, then we can conclude that the phonetic difference is also a phonemic difference in that language. So our\nquestion really is, how do we find differences in meaning?\nWhat we do is look for a minimal pair. We want to find two words that are identical in every way except for\nthe two segments that we\u2019re considering. So the two words are minimally different: the only phonetic difference\nbetween them is the difference that we\u2019re interested in. If we can find such a pair, where the minimal phonetic\ndifference leads to a difference in meaning, it\u2019s contrastive, then we can conclude that the phonetic difference\nbetween them is a phonemic difference.\nWe\u2019ve already seen one example of a minimal pair: fan and van are identical in every way except for the first\nsegment. The phonetic difference between [f] and [v] is contrastive; it changes the meaning of the word, so we\nconclude that /f/ and /v/ are two different phonemes. Can you think of other minimal pairs that give evidence for\nthe phonemic contrast between /f/ and /v/? Take a minute, pause the video, and try to think of some.\nHere are some more minimal pairs that I thought of for /f/ and /v/: vine and fine, veal and feel. Minimal pairs don\u2019t\nhave to have the segments that we\u2019re considering at the beginning of the word. Here are some pairs that contrast\nat the end of the word: have and half, serve and surf. Or the contrast can occur in the middle of the word, like in 100 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nreviews and refuse. What\u2019s important is that the two words are minimally different: they are the same in all their\nsegments except for the two that we\u2019re considering. And it\u2019s also important to notice that the minimal difference\nis in the IPA transcription of the word, not in its spelling.\nSo we\u2019ve got plenty of evidence from all these minimal pairs in English that the phonetic difference between /f/\nand /v/ leads to a meaning difference in English, so we can conclude that, in English, /f/ and /v/ are two different\nphonemes. 4.2 Allophones and Predictable Variation\nWithin a phoneme category, speech sounds vary, usually in predictable ways. The variants within a phoneme category\nare called allophones. Allophones usually appear in complementary distribution, that is, a given allophone of one phoneme\nappears in one predictable environment, but the other allophones of that phoneme never appear in that environment.\n101 102 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Remember that a phoneme is something that exists\nin your mind: it\u2019s like a shopping bag in which your mind stores memories of examples of phonetically similar\nsounds that are all members of one category. Not all the sounds that you store in one phoneme category have to\nbe identical; in fact, your mental category has room for a lot of variation. Any variants that are not contrastive,\nthat don\u2019t lead to a meaning change, are members of that same phoneme category and are called allophones.\nWe\u2019ve already seen some examples of allophones of English phonemes as we\u2019ve been learning to transcribe\nsounds. We know that the alveolar lateral approximant [l] has a voiceless variant [l\u0325] and a syllabic variant [l\u0329], but\nour minds categorize all of them as members of the same phoneme. This shopping-bag metaphor is going to get\na little unwieldy, so let\u2019s look at another notation that we can use to represent this phoneme category.\nWe say that /l/ is the label for the phoneme category itself, it\u2019s the most general form of the phoneme. Notice\nthat instead of using square brackets, for the symbol that represents the whole category we use slashes. In any\ngiven word, the phoneme /l/ might get spoken as any one of its allophones, each of which gets represented in\nsquare brackets. But where does each allophone appear? Which allophones do we use in which words? One of the\nbig things that phonology is concerned with is the distribution of allophones: that is, what phonetic environments\neach allophone appears in. The distribution of allophones is a key part of the mental grammar of each language\n\u2014 it\u2019s something that all speakers know unconsciously.\nSome allophones appear in free variation, which means that it\u2019s pretty much random which variant appears\nin any environment. But most allophones are entirely predictable: linguists say that allophonic variation is\nphonetically conditioned because it depends on what other sounds are nearby within the word.\nLet\u2019s start by looking at free variation because it\u2019s the simpler case. Take our phoneme /l/, as in the words\nlucky and lunch. Most of the time you pronounce these words with a plain old ordinary voiced alveolar lateral 4.2 ALLOPHONES AND PREDICTABLE VARIATION 103\napproximant. But sometimes you might be speaking extra clearly \u2014 maybe you\u2019re trying to talk to a relative\nwho\u2019s hard of hearing, or maybe you\u2019re concentrating on teaching some speech sounds to a language learner. So\ninstead of making the /l/ sound at the alveolar ridge, you stick your tongue right out between your teeth and say\nlucky or lunch. Now you\u2019re making a dental [l\u032a], not an alveolar [l], but it\u2019s still a member of the phoneme category\nfor /l/ \u2014 it doesn\u2019t change the meaning of the word so this phonetic difference is not contrastive. It\u2019s just free\nvariation within the category.\nBut most allophonic variation is predictable: different allophones show up in different environments. Let\u2019s look\nat a few words. If we look at this set of words: plow, clap, clear, play, we can see that whenever /l/ follows a [p] or\n[k], it is devoiced. But now look at this other set of words (blue, gleam, leaf, fall, silly), when /l/ appears in any other\nenvironment, like following a voiced stop, or at the beginning of a word, at the end of a word, or in the middle of\na word, it\u2019s the ordinary [l]. If we looked at a whole lot more words and recorded a lot of English speakers, we\u2019d\nfind that whenever /l/ is in a consonant cluster following a voiceless aspirated stop, it also becomes voiceless, but\nwhen /l/ is in other environments, it stays voiced. We never find voiceless [l\u0325] in other environments, and we almost\nnever find voiced [l] following a voiceless stop. That pattern is called complementary distribution.\nThat\u2019s an important phrase, and it\u2019s going to come up a lot in the next few units. It means that there\u2019s no overlap\nin where we find the allophones: We see voiceless [l\u0325] following voiceless stops, but never anywhere else, and we\nnever see voiced [l] in that environment. Likewise, we see voiced [l] in lots of different environments, but we never\nsee voiceless [l\u0325] in any of those places. When we see complementary distribution, that\u2019s good evidence that the\ntwo segments we\u2019re considering are allophones of one phoneme. Can you think of any other examples of English\nphonetic segments that are in complementary distribution? Think about what happens when you\u2019re transcribing\nvoiceless stops.\nSo let\u2019s sum up. If we have two phonetic segments that are related but different from each other, and we\nfind some minimal pairs to show that this phonetic difference is contrastive, then we conclude that those two\nsegments are two different phonemes.\nAnd if we have two phonetic segments that are related but different, and they\u2019re not contrastive, then we look\nto see what the distribution of these segments is, that is, what environments we see them in. If they\u2019re not\ncontrastive and they\u2019re in complementary distribution, then we conclude that they\u2019re allophones of the same\nphoneme. 4.3 Phonetic Segments and Features\nEach speech sound can be analyzed in terms of its phonetic features, the parts of the sound that can each be independently\ncontrolled by the articulators. We can represent the features of each sound using a feature matrix, or we can use a feature\nmatrix to represent a class of sounds that have features in common.\n104 4.3 PHONETIC SEGMENTS AND FEATURES 105\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Segments are the\nindividual speech sounds, each of which gets transcribed with an individual symbol in the IPA. We\u2019ve seen that\nany given segment can influence the segments that come before and after it, through coarticulation and other\narticulatory processes. And we\u2019ve also seen that segments can be grouped together into syllables, which we look\nat in more detail in another unit. Within the grammar of any language, two different segments might contrast with\neach other or might not.\nSo we\u2019ve been talking as if segments are the smallest unit in speech, but in fact, each speech segment is made up\nof smaller components called features. Each feature is an element of a sound that we can control independently.\nTo see how features work, let\u2019s look at a couple of examples. We can describe the segment [b], for example, as\nbeing made up of this set of features. First, [b] is a consonant (meaning it has some obstruction in the vocal tract),\nso it gets the feature consonant indicated with a plus sign to show that the consonant feature is present. Looking\nat the next feature, sonorant, notice that it\u2019s indicated with a minus sign, meaning that [b] is not a sonorant. The\nfeature sonorant, of course, has to do with sonority. We know that stops have very low sonority because the vocal\ntract is completely closed for stops, so stops are all coded as [-sonorant]. The next feature, syllabic, tells us whether\na given segment is the nucleus of a syllable or not. Remember that the most common segments that serve as the\nnucleus of a syllable are vowels, but stops certainly cannot be the nucleus, so [b] gets labelled as [-syllabic]. These\nfirst three features, consonant, sonorant, and syllabic allow us to group all speech segments into the major classes\nof consonants, vowels, and glides. We\u2019ll see how in a couple of minutes.\nThis next set of features has to do with the manner of articulation. The feature continuant tells us how long\na sound goes on. Stops are very short sounds; they last for only a brief moment, so [b] gets a minus sign for 106 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ncontinuant. We also know that [b] is not made by passing air through the nasal cavity, so it also gets a minus sign\nfor the feature nasal. And [b] is a voiced sound, made with vocal folds vibrating, so it is [+voice].\nThe last feature we list for [b] is [LABIAL] because it\u2019s made with the lips. (Stay tuned for an explanation of why\nsome features are listed in lower-case and some in upper-case.)\nThis whole list of features is called a feature matrix; it\u2019s the list of the individual features that describe the\nsegment [b], in quite a lot of detail! Because features are at the phonetic level of representation, we use square\nbrackets when we list them. You often see a feature matrix listed with a large pair of square brackets, like this, but\nwe\u2019ll just use individual square brackets on each feature.\nNow I want you to notice something. If we take this whole feature matrix and change the value of just one\nfeature, changing the feature voice from plus to minus, now we\u2019re describing a different segment, [p]: [p] has\nevery feature in common with [b] except for voicing. Likewise, if we take the feature matrix for [b] and change the\nvalue of the feature continuant from minus to plus, now we\u2019re describing the segment [v], which has all the same\nfeatures as [b] except that it can continue for a long time because it\u2019s a fricative. Or if we take the feature matrix\nfor [b] and change the feature nasal from minus to plus, this has the effect of also changing the sonorant feature\nto plus as well, because circulating air through the nasal cavity adds sonority. Now, this feature matrix describes\nthe properties of the segment [m].\nSo each feature is something that we can control independently of the others with our articulators. And\nchanging just one feature is enough to change the properties of a segment. That change might lead to a phonemic\ncontrast within the mental grammar of a language, or it might just result in an allophone of the same phoneme.\nIt turns out that segments that have a lot of features in common tend to behave the same way within the mental\ngrammar of a language. And we can use these features to group segments into natural classes that capture some\nof these similarities in their behaviour.\nLet\u2019s look again at the feature matrix for [b]. If we take away the feature that describes its place of articulation,\nwe end up with a smaller list of features. This smaller list describes not just a single segment, but a class of\nsegments: all the voiced stops. By not mentioning the place feature, we\u2019ve allowed this matrix to include segments\nfrom any place of articulation, as long as they share all these other features. These three segments have all these\nfeatures in common: they\u2019re a natural class. If we remove another feature, the voicing feature, the natural class\ngets bigger: now we\u2019ve got a feature matrix that describes all the stops in English, including those that are [+voice]\nand those that are [-voice]. So you can see that this system of features is very powerful for describing classes of\nsegments that have things in common. We\u2019ll learn more about natural classes in the next unit. 4.4 Natural Classes\nIt\u2019s possible to describe an individual speech segment in terms of its phonetic features. It\u2019s also possible to group sounds that\nshare features into natural classes. Natural classes of sounds tend to behave similarly because they have features in common.\nWe can distinguish obstruents, sonorants, glides, and vowels using the major class features, and distinguish in more detail\nwithin these major classes using features for place and manner of articulation.\n107 108 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

We\nalso learned how to use the notation of a feature matrix to describe the features that the members of a natural\nclass have in common. Remember that the more features we list, the smaller the natural class gets, and the fewer\nfeatures we list, the larger the class we\u2019re describing.\nThe two largest natural classes can be described with just one feature! All segments that have an obstruction in\nthe vocal tract are [+consonant], and the vowels, which have no obstruction in the vocal tract, are [-consonant].\nNotice that the feature consonant is binary, meaning it has exactly two values: plus or minus. This means that we\ndon\u2019t need a separate feature to label the sounds that are vowels: using the binary feature notation we can just\nsay that consonants are [+consonant] and all vowels are [-consonant].\nNow, why did I say that most consonants are [+consonant]? Could there be consonants that aren\u2019t totally\nconsonants? Think back to when we first started learning to categorize sounds. Remember we said the glides /j/\nand /w/ have very little obstruction in the vocal tract. So even though /j/ and /w/ often behave like consonants, they\nget labelled as [-consonant] in the feature system. This is how we indicate that also they share some properties\nwith vowels, namely, the property of having the vocal tract unobstructed.\nThe next feature that groups segments into the major classes has to do with sonority, or acoustic energy.\nBecause of the relatively open vocal tract, all vowels are [+sonorant]. But not all consonants are [-sonorant].\nApproximants also have a relatively open vocal tract, so all glides and liquids are also [+sonorant]. And when air\ncirculates through the nasal cavity, that also creates a lot of acoustic energy so all the nasal consonants are also\n[+sonorant]. All other sounds, that is, stops, fricatives, affricates, and so on, are minus sonorant because they have 4.4 NATURAL CLASSES 109\nlower sonority. Informally, we call the non-sonorant class of sounds obstruents, but we don\u2019t need a separate\nfeature label for obstruents because of how the binary feature system works: we just identify them as [-sonorant].\nThe third major feature groups sounds according to whether they can be the nucleus of a syllable or not. There\u2019s\na lot of overlap between sounds that are [+sonorant] and [+syllabic], but the two classes aren\u2019t totally identical.\nI\u2019m sure you can already guess that all vowels have the feature [+syllabic]. By default, all consonants are [-syllabic],\nbut remember that some consonants can sometimes serve as the nucleus of a syllable \u2014 do you remember which\nones? The liquids and nasals become [+syllabic] only when they\u2019re the nucleus of a syllable.\nThese three features are called the major class features because they allow us to group segments into these\nbroad categories. At one end of the spectrum, we have the vowels, with no obstruction in the vocal tract, so they\u2019re\nsonorant, and they can serve as the nucleus of a syllable. At the other end, we have the obstruents: these are\nthe consonants that have low sonority and can\u2019t be the nucleus of a syllable. And then in between, we have the\nsonorant consonants, which are usually [-syllabic] but can become [+syllabic], so if we don\u2019t list that feature, we\nindicate that it can be either plus or minus. And then there are the glides, which are almost like vowels except\nthey\u2019re [-syllabic]. There are a few details to notice here: the nasals and liquids are consonants that are sonorant,\nand that can become syllabic. The glides are sonorants, but they don\u2019t serve as the nucleus of a syllable, and they\ndon\u2019t even count as consonants!\nThe next set of features we should consider are those that describe manners of articulation. The continuant\nfeature has to do with whether air is allowed to flow in the oral cavity (that is, in the mouth). So the main job the\ncontinuant feature does is to distinguish between the stops, which are [-continuant] because airflow is blocked,\nand all other sounds. Notice that the nasals count as [-continuant] along with the plosive stops because they\ninvolve a complete closure in the mouth.\nSpeaking of nasals, the feature [+nasal] labels nasal sounds. /m n \u014b/ are obviously [+nasal], and in English, all\nother sounds are [-nasal] by default. But sometimes assimilation leads a vowel to take on a nasal feature. In the\nword pants, for example, the [\u00e6] vowel becomes nasalized in anticipation of the following nasal sound, which we\nwould label as a change from [-nasal] to [+nasal].\nThe voice feature is pretty obvious: if the vocal folds are vibrating, then a segment is [+voice]. So all the voiced\nconsonants are [+voice] and the voiceless consonants are [-voice]. In English, the vocal folds vibrate for vowels, so\nthe vowels are also [+voice].\nNow let\u2019s look at the features that describe which articulators are active in producing a sound. Notice that the\nnotation for the place features is different: these ones are not binary features so there\u2019s no plus or minus, and\nthey\u2019re written in all capital letters to distinguish them from the binary features. The idea is that there\u2019s no known\nlanguage that makes meaningful phonological distinctions on the basis of what a sound\u2019s place of articulation is\nNOT, so we don\u2019t need a minus-value for these features. The feature [LABIAL] identifies any sound that involves\nthe lips. [CORONAL] classifies sounds that are produced using the tip of the tongue, and [DORSAL] classifies\nsounds that are produced with the body and back of the tongue.\nLet\u2019s start by looking at labial sounds. If a sound doesn\u2019t involve the lips at all, then we don\u2019t even list [LABIAL] in\nits feature matrix. But if it does involve the lips, then we specify whether the lips are [+round], like the rounded\nvowels and the glide [w], or [-round], like for the bilabial and labio-dental consonants.\nWe label sounds that are made with the tip of the tongue with the feature [CORONAL], and then we can classify\nthem further according to where the tip is. The word anterior is just a fancy word for \u201cfront\u201d. The dental and\nalveolar sounds are made with the tip of the tongue towards the front of the mouth and are [+anterior]. Post-\nalveolar sounds have the tip of the tongue pointing farther back so they\u2019re [-anterior]. There\u2019s another distinction\nfor the coronal sounds. We use the label [+strident] for the sounds that are acoustically noisy and sound like\nhissing, that is, [s z \u0283 \u0292 t\u0283 d\u0292]. The other coronals are [-strident]. You\u2019ll see why this distinction matters in one of the\nexercises at the end of this chapter.\nSounds that are made not with the tip of the tongue but with the tongue body have the feature [DORSAL]. Only\na few consonants in English have the feature [DORSAL]: the velar sounds [k \u0261 \u014b] and the glides [j w]. And because 110 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nthe body of the tongue is the primary articulator that we use to make different vowel sounds, all vowels have the\nfeature [DORSAL].\nOnce we\u2019ve identified a sound as a dorsal sound, then we use binary features to specify the position of the\ntongue body. We specify vowel height with the features [\u00b1high] and [\u00b1low]. All high sounds are [-low], and all low\nsounds are [-high], but there are also vowels that are both [-low] and [-high]: the mid vowels! We identify the front\nor back position of the tongue with [\u00b1back], but we don\u2019t need to include a [\u00b1front] feature because these central\nvowels pattern with the natural class of back vowels.\nThere\u2019s one other feature we need for categorizing the vowels of English, and that\u2019s the tense/lax distinction.\nWe label the tense vowels as [+tense] and the lax vowels as [-tense].\nThere\u2019s a full chart of features for the segments of English presented below, but don\u2019t be intimidated by it. A\nfeature matrix is just a more organized way of presenting the information that you already learned about phonetic\nsegments. If you start to think of segments in terms of natural classes and what features the natural class has,\nyou\u2019ll start to get the hang of it.\np b t d k \u0261 f v s z \u03b8 \u00f0 \u0283 \u0292 m n \u014b l \u0279 j w\nMajor Class Features\n[consonant] + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + \u2013 \u2013\n[sonorant] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + + + + + +\n[syllabic] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nManner Features\n[nasal] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[continuant] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + + + + + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + + +\n[lateral] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[voice] \u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 + \u2013 + + + + + + + +\nPlace Features\nLABIAL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n[round] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 +\nCORONAL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n[anterior] + + + + + + \u2013 \u2013 + + +\n[strident] \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nDORSAL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n[high] + + + + +\n[back] + + + \u2013 + 4.4 NATURAL CLASSES 111\ni \u026a e \u025b \u00e6 a u \u028a o \u028c \u0254 \u0251\nMajor Class Features\n[consonant] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[sonorant] + + + + + + + + + + + +\n[syllabic] + + + + + + + + + + + +\nManner Features\n[continuant] + + + + + + + + + + + +\n[voice] + + + + + + + + + + + +\nPlace Features\nLABIAL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n[round] + + + +\nDORSAL \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713\n[high] + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n[low] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 +\n[back] \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + + + + + +\n[tense] + \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 + + \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 + 4.5 Phonological Derivations\nUsing the notation of feature matrices, we can create \u201cformulas\u201d that represent the relationship between the phonemic\nand phonetic levels of representation in our mental grammar.

YOU CAN VIEW IT ONLINE HERE:\nHTTPS://ECAMPUSONTARIO.PRESSBOOKS.PUB/ESSENTIALSOFLINGUISTICS/?P=96\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nEarlier in this chapter, we talked about the difference between phonemic and phonetic representations.\nRemember that when we talk about a phonemic representation, we\u2019re referring to how a sound or a word\nis represented in our mind. At the phonemic level, the mind stores segmental information, but not details\nabout allophonic variation. But the phonetic representation is how we actually speak words, and because of\ncoarticulation and various articulatory processes, when we speak a given phoneme, it gets produced as the\nparticular allophone that\u2019s conditioned by the surrounding environment. For example, the word clean is\nh\nrepresented phonemically like this /klin/ in our minds but when we speak, these particular phonetic details [k l\u0325in]\nare part of what we say. We speak in allophones but we hear in phonemes.\nThe systematic, predictable relationship between the phonemic and phonetic representations is part of the\nmental grammar of every fluent speaker of a language. Phonologists have developed a notation for depicting this\nrelationship, which is sometimes known as a derivation or a rule. Remember of course that when we talk about\nrules in linguistics, we don\u2019t mean those prescriptive rules that your high school English teacher wanted you to\nfollow. We mean the principles that our mental grammar uses to link the underlying phonemic representation to\nthe surface form. Our mental grammar keeps track of every predictable phonetic change that happens to a given\nnatural class of sounds in a given phonetic environment.\nLet\u2019s think about that now familiar process of liquid devoicing. We\u2019ve seen lots of English examples like clean\nh\nwhere the voiced [l] becomes voiceless following the voiceless [k ] because of perseveratory assimilation. In fact,\nwe\u2019ve seen enough data from English to observe that this doesn\u2019t just happen to one segment; it happens to the\nnatural class of liquids in the environment of another natural class: voiceless stops.\nThe way that we write a derivation takes a particular form that looks like this. This notation is read as \u201cA\nbecomes B in the environment between X and Y\u201d. The left side represents the phonetic change that happens: a\nparticular phoneme or natural class of phonemes becomes a given allophone or undergoes a change to one or\nmore features. The right-hand side shows the phonetic environment that the change occurs in.\nSo how would we use this notation to represent the predictable process of liquid devoicing? Let\u2019s start by\ndescribing the pattern in words. The change happens to the liquids [l] and [\u0279]. What happens to them is that they\ngo from voiced to voiceless. And where it happens is following voiceless stops. So now let\u2019s describe the pattern\nusing a feature matrix.\nWe start with the feature matrix for the liquids. They\u2019re consonants that are sonorant but not nasal and by 114 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ndefault, they\u2019re [+voice]. The change that happens is that their voice feature goes from plus to minus. The other\nfeatures stay the same so we don\u2019t list them in the feature matrix that describes the change.\nNow we have to say where this change happens. The big slash just means \u201cin the environment\u201d and we know\nthat this change happens following something, so we put the horizontal line that indicates the location of the\nchange following the feature matrix that represents the environment and then we fill in the details of the particular\nenvironment. Voiceless stops are consonants that are [-continuant] and [-voice].\nWe could say that [l] becomes voiceless [l] in the environment following [p] or [k] and [\u0279] becomes voiceless [\u0279] in\nthe environment following [p] or [t] or [k] but using feature matrices captures the broader generalization that this\nallophonic variation happens to an entire natural class in the environment of another natural class. 4.6 Phonological Derivations in Everyday Speech\nPhonological derivations might seem quite abstract and mathematical, but they represent processes that happen\nautomatically in everyone\u2019s mental grammar. This unit looks at a couple of the most common phonological processes in\nEnglish that can be represented with derivations.\n115 116 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In this unit we\u2019ll look at some of the processes that\nwe use really frequently when we speak English, and how they can be represented with a phonological rule.\nLet\u2019s start by talking about plurals in English. When we were learning to transcribe, we noticed that the common\nEnglish plural suffix, which is usually spelled with the letter \u201cs\u201d, gets transcribed in three different ways. This is\nsometimes called the \u201ccats, dogs, horses\u201d phenomenon because cats ends with a voiceless fricative [s], dogs ends\nwith the voiced fricative [z], and horses with a whole syllable [\u0268z]. Here are some other words with each of these\ndifferent plural forms.\ncups, peacocks, myths, cliffs all take the voiceless [s]\nbees, fans, pencils, leaves all take the voiced [z]\nand edges, mazes, dishes, beaches take the [\u0268z] form\nWe don\u2019t have to look too hard to figure out that words that end in a voiceless consonant take the voiceless\nplurals [s] while the voiced [z] is for words that end in a voiced segment. But why is there this third form of the\nplural. Why does that high central vowel get epenthesized, and where does it happen? Look down this list of\nwords and you\u2019ll see that they all end in fricatives, [s], [z], [\u0283] or [\u0292]. But it\u2019s not all fricatives, as we can see from\nmyths, cliffs, leaves. Looking at the feature chart, we see that it\u2019s a particular class of CORONAL fricatives \u2014 the\nones that are [+strident]. We can describe this process in words by saying that the English plural suffix [z] gets an\nextra vowel [\u0268] following a strident consonant. How can we represent that with a rule?\nWell, we start by thinking about the change that happens. In this case, a vowel is getting epenthesized. We\u2019ve\nbeen describing phonetic changes as something becoming something else, but epenthesis is really a case of\nnothing become something. So we represent it this way: this zero with the diagonal line through it means 4.6 PHONOLOGICAL DERIVATIONS IN EVERYDAY SPEECH 117\n\u201cnothing\u201d, and the something that gets inserted is the high central vowel [\u0268]. And what\u2019s the environment where\nit happens? Following a strident consonant, but not just any time there\u2019s a strident. Our mental grammar doesn\u2019t\ngo around sticking extra vowels into every word with a strident in it. It happens specifically when we\u2019re sticking a\n[z] at the end of a word. Notice that this correctly predicts that we\u2019ll also get that extra vowel when we add the\nsimple present suffix to a verb, so breathes just gets [z] for simple present in she breathes but reaches, where the\nverb reach ends with the affricate [t\u0283] gets the epenthesized vowel: reaches.\nSo the idea we\u2019re working with here is that every single fluent speaker of English, every time they speak the\nplural form of a word that ends with [s] [z] [\u0283] [\u0292] [t\u0283] or [d\u0292], their mental grammar automatically applies this rule,\nand it happens so regularly and so rapidly that most of us aren\u2019t even aware of it.\nNow let\u2019s look at that common process of flapping. When we were learning to do phonetic transcription, we\nlearned that a word that\u2019s spelled with a \u201cd\u201d or a \u201ct\u201d in a particular environment usually gets pronounced with a\nflap [\u027e] instead of a stop, for people who speak varieties of Canadian and US English, and also for most speakers of\nAustralian English. Here are some examples:\nwater, ladder, total, model, bottom, modem\nLooking at this set of words, we can see a pretty clear pattern, which we can describe in words this way: [t] and\n[d] become the flap [\u027e] between vowels in the onset of an unstressed syllable. (It\u2019s actually a little more complex\nthan that, but linguists are still arguing about what the exact environment is, so this is close enough for our\npurposes.) We can describe this process with a phonological derivation something like this:\nThe class of sounds that the change happens to is the alveolar stops [d] and [t]. So these are consonants that\nare [-sonorant], which excludes the nasals and liquids, and [-continuant], which excludes fricatives. And they\u2019re\nthe ones made at the tip of the tongue, that is, the coronals. These sounds become the flap, in the environment\nbetween vowels, when the second vowel is unstressed. So that\u2019s a lot of fancy notation to describe a process that\nyour mental grammar does rapidly, unconsciously, hundreds of times a day.\nSo we\u2019ve looked at a couple of examples of phonological derivations that represent allophonic and allomorphic\nvariation in our everyday speech. (Glance ahead a couple chapters to learn what \u201callomorphic\u201d means!) Linguists\nuse this formal notation to represent them, but remember that these are unconscious processes in our mental\ngrammar that operate hundreds of times a day without us even noticing. 4.7 Phonological Derivations in Canadian English and\nCanadian French\nPhonological derivations might seem quite abstract and mathematical, but they represent processes that happen\nautomatically in everyone\u2019s mental grammar.

I want to look now at some processes that are characteristic of particularly Canadian\nvarieties of English and French.\nTake a look at these pairs of words and say them to yourself.\nI\u2019m a native speaker of Canadian English; I grew up in Ontario and have lived more than forty years in this\nprovince, so my variety of English is probably fairly typical of the English spoken by white, middle-class, middle-\naged Ontarians. I\u2019m going to say these words for you and you listen carefully.\neyes ice\nfried fright\nrider writer\nfly flight\nrouse house\nloud lout\ngouge couch\nbowed bout\nThe first four pairs of words have the diphthong /\u0251\u026a/, and last four pairs have the diphthong /\u0251\u028a/. But did you\nnotice anything different between the words on the left and the words on the right? In my variety of English, the\nright-hand words have a higher vowel in the diphthong than the left-hand ones. This is regular, predictable, and\nin lots of places in the USA, is instantly recognizable as Canadian. If you\u2019re talking to someone in the US and all of\na sudden they interrupt you and ask, \u201cAre you Canadian?\u201d it\u2019s probably because you just said the word house or\nabout. This process is so strongly associated with a Canadian accent that it\u2019s called \u201cCanadian Raising\u201d, even though\nit occurs in several US varieties of English too.\nBy looking at this list of words, can you figure out what environment predicts where the raised diphthongs will\noccur? Here\u2019s a hint \u2014 it has to do with what follows the diphthong. The low back [\u0251] vowel gets raised to mid-back\n[\u028c] before a voiceless consonant. So using our notation of phonological derivations, we can say that the mental\ngrammar of the average speaker of Canadian English includes this rule.\nA low back vowel becomes [-low], that is, it gets raised to a mid-vowel, in the environment where it\u2019s before\nanother vowel \u2014 this is what makes sure our rule doesn\u2019t apply to all vowels, just to diphthongs, and where the\ndiphthong is followed by a voiceless consonant.\nIn Canadian English it also seems to be the case that the low back vowel becomes the low front vowel in\ndiphthongs elsewhere, but this doesn\u2019t get a cute name like Canadian Raising.\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot about Canadian English, but not much yet about Canadian French, which differs in some\nsystematic ways from the variety of French spoken in France. Here\u2019s some data from Canadian French. Here are\nsome pairs of French words that vary between tense and lax vowels: tout / touche, petit / petite, and truquer / truc.\nYou already know these first two pairs of vowels: [u \u028a] high back rounded tense and lax, [i \u026a] high front unrounded\ntense and lax. This last pair [y \u028f] are high, front, rounded vowels, in tense and lax versions.\nNow this isn\u2019t quite enough data for us to be able to see the whole pattern, so I\u2019m going to give you more words\nto look at. All the words in the left-hand column have tense vowels, and the right-hand words have lax vowels.\nLook at this pair of words, lunettes (glasses) and lune (moon). If we just look at the surrounding consonants, it looks\nlike both the tense and lax vowels can appear in the same environment \u2014 they both have an [l] before them and\nan [n] afterwards. Let\u2019s look more closely at the syllable structure of these two words. One word has two syllables\nand the other has just one. We know that the vowels go in the nucleus of each syllable, the first consonants of each\nword go in the onset of the first syllable, and the final consonant goes in the coda. But what about this [n] in the\nmiddle of lunettes? Remembering that onsets are greedy, it must be that [n] is in the onset of the second syllable 4.7 PHONOLOGICAL DERIVATIONS IN CANADIAN ENGLISH AND CANADIAN FRENCH 121\nin lunettes, even though it\u2019s in the coda of lune. Now we can see that it\u2019s the syllable structure of these words that\npredicts the environment for the tense and lax vowels.\nThese high vowels [u i y] are tense when they\u2019re in a syllable with nothing in the coda, but they become lax [\u028a \u026a \u028f]\nwhen there\u2019s a consonant in the coda. The other way of describing these two environments is as open and closed\nsyllables: An open syllable is one without a coda, and a closed syllable is one that has a coda.\nSo this process, which is one of the ones that characterizes Canadian French as distinct from European French,\nlives in the mental grammar of Canadian French speakers as something like this rule: high tense vowels become\n[-tense] (that is, they become lax), in a predictable environment. How can we describe this environment? We know\nit has something to do with the syllable structure so we use this Greek sigma \u03c3 to indicate the syllable boundary.\nThe position where this happens is in the nucleus, before the syllable boundary, and for a closed syllable there\nmust be a consonant before the end of the syllable, that is, in coda position.\nSo we\u2019ve looked at a handful of examples of phonological derivations that represent allophonic variation in our\neveryday speech. And we\u2019ve seen that these processes can lead to variation across dialects: two varieties that have\nsimilar phoneme inventories might still sound different to each other because of different processes of allophonic\nvariation!

In Modern English, as you know, the fricatives [f, v, \u03b8, \u00f0, s, z] are six different phonemes. But in Old\nEnglish, these six segments were categorized as only three different phonemes, each with a voiced and a voiceless\nallophone, [f, v], [\u03b8, \u00f0], [s, z].

Summary\nYou\u2019ve now seen that the mental grammar of every language organizes speech sounds differently. A pair of sounds\nthat contrast with each other in one language might be allophones of the same phoneme in another language.\nEven without knowing another language, you can now use the tools that linguists use to analyze phonological\ndata from a language: you can look for minimal pairs to find evidence of phonemic contrast, or you can analyze\nenvironments and identify complementary distribution to find evidence of allophonic variation.\nMany processes of allophonic variation in the world\u2019s languages apply not just to pairs of segments, but to\nnatural classes of sounds. The notation of feature matrices helps to identify the natural classes that undergo\nallophonic variation, and the natural classes of environments that lead to (or \u201ccondition\u201d) this variation.\n124 CHAPTER 5: LEARNING SOUNDS\nThis chapter illustrates how the phonological component of mental grammar develops in a language learner,\nwhether in an infant learning their first language, or an adult learning a second, third, or later language. The\nchapter also explores what it means for a speaker to have an accent.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 identify the stages in babies\u2019 development of phoneme categories in their L1,\n\u2022 predict whether a phonemic contrast will be easy or hard for an L2 learner to learn, depending on their\nL1,\n\u2022 understand the consequences of accent stigma for speakers and listeners,\n125  5.1 How Babies Learn the Phoneme Categories of Their\nLanguage\nIf phoneme categories are organized differently in the mental grammar of each language, how does a language learner learn\nwhat the relevant categories are for their particular language? Using an experimental technique called habituation, researchers\nhave shown that babies set up the phoneme categories for their native language between six and twelve months of age.\n127 128 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

So, for example, we know that in English,\nh\naspirated [p ] and unaspirated [p] are both allophones of a single phoneme. But in Thai, these two segments\ncontrast with each other and are two different phonemes. The phonetic difference is the same, but how that\ndifference is organized in the mental grammar is different in the two languages. This has effects when adults are\ntrying to learn a second language.\nNow, it\u2019s a stereotype that people who are native speakers of Japanese often have difficulty when they\u2019re\nlearning some sounds of English, particularly in learning the difference between English /\u0279/ and /l/. These two\nsounds are contrastive in English, and we have lots of minimal pairs that provide evidence for that contrast,\nlike rake and lake, fall and far, cram and clam. But neither of these segments is part of the Japanese phoneme\ninventory. Japanese has one phoneme, the retroflex flap [\u027d], that is phonetically a little bit similar to English /l/\nand a little bit similar to English /\u0279/. So given that English /\u0279/ and /l/ are both phonetically different to the Japanese\n/\u027d/, and are phonetically different from each other, why is this phonemic contrast hard for Japanese learners to\nmaster?\nTo answer this question, we have to look at babies.\nBabies learn the phonology of their native language very early. When they are just born, we know that babies can\nrecognize all kinds of phonetic differences. You might be wondering how we can tell what sounds a baby can\nrecognize \u2014 we can\u2019t just ask them, \u201cAre these two sounds the same or different?\u201d But we can use a habituation\ntechnique to observe whether they notice a difference or not. Babies can\u2019t do much, but one thing they\u2019re very\ngood at is sucking. Using an instrument called a pressure transducer, which is connected to a pacifier, we can\nmeasure how powerfully they suck. When a baby is interested in something, like a sound that she\u2019s hearing, she\nstarts to suck harder. If you keep playing that same sound, eventually she\u2019ll get bored and her sucking strength will\ndecrease. When her sucking strength drops off, we say that the baby has habituated to the sound. But if you play\na new sound, she gets interested again and starts sucking powerfully again. So we can observe if a baby notices\nthe difference between two sounds by observing whether her sucking strength increases when you switch from\none sound to the other. For newborn infants, we observe habituation with sucking strength, and for babies who\nare a little older, we can observe habituation just by where they look: they\u2019ll look toward a source of sound when\nthey\u2019re interested in it, then look away when they get habituated. If they notice a change in the sound, they\u2019ll look\nback toward the sound.\nUsing this technique, linguists and psychologists have learned that babies are very good at noticing phonetic\ndifferences, and they can tell the difference between all kinds of different sounds from many different languages.\nBut this ability changes within the first year of life. A researcher named Janet Werker at the University of British\nColumbia looked at children and adults\u2019 ability to notice the phonetic difference between three different pairs of 130 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nsyllables: the English contrast /ba/ and /da/, the Hindi contrast between a retroflex stop /\u0288a/ and a dental stop\n/t\u032aa/, and a Salish contrast between glottalized velar /k\u02bci/ and uvular /q\u02bci/ stops. Each of these pairs differs in place\nof articulation, and within each language, each pair is contrastive. Werker played a series of syllables and asked\nEnglish-speaking adults to press a button when the syllables switched from one segment to the other. As you\nmight expect, the English-speaking adults were perfect at the English contrast but did extremely poorly on the\nHindi and Salish contrasts.\nThen Werker tested babies\u2019 ability to notice these three phonetic differences, using the head-turn paradigm.\nThese babies were growing up in monolingual English-speaking homes. At age six months, the English-learning\nbabies were about 80-90% successful at noticing the differences in English, in Hindi and in Salish. But by age ten\nmonths, their success rate had dropped to about 50-60%, and by the time they were one year old, they were only\nabout 10-20% successful at hearing the phonetic differences in Hindi and Salish. So these kids are only one year\nold, they\u2019ve been hearing English spoken for only one year, and they\u2019re not even really speaking it themselves yet,\nbut already their performance on this task is matching that of English-speaking adults. The difference between\nretroflex [\u0288a] and dental [t\u032aa] is not contrastive in English, so the mental grammar of the English-learning baby\nhas already categorized both those sounds as just unusual-sounding allophones of English alveolar /ta/. Likewise,\nthe difference between a velar and a uvular stop, which is contrastive in Salish, is not meaningful in English, so\nthe baby\u2019s mind has already learned to treat a uvular stop as an allophone of the velar stop, not as a separate\nphoneme.\nSo if we go back to our question of why it\u2019s so hard for adults to learn the phonemic contrast in a new language,\nlike the Japanese learners who have difficulty with English /l/ and /\u0279/, the answer is because, by the time they\u2019re one\nyear old, the mental grammar of Japanese-learning babies has already formed a single phoneme category that\ncontains English /l/ and /\u0279/ as allophones of that one phoneme. To recognize the contrast in English, a Japanese\nlearner has to develop two separate phoneme categories. 5.2 How Adults Learn Phoneme Categories in a New\nLanguage\nJust because babies have learned the phoneme categories of their L1 by the time they\u2019re one year old doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s\nimpossible to learn phoneme categories in a new language when you\u2019re older. Some phoneme contrasts in an L2 will be easy\nto learn and other will be harder, depending on your L1. This unit explains why.\n131 132 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is part of the reason that it can be challenging to learn a new language as an\nadult. A psycholinguist by the name of Catherine Best has proposed a theory to predict which phoneme contrasts\nwill be hard for second-language learners to learn, and which will be easy. For simplicity, let\u2019s use the term L1 for 5.2 HOW ADULTS LEARN PHONEME CATEGORIES IN A NEW LANGUAGE 133\nyour native language, the language you learn from infancy. And an L2 is any language you learn later than that, as\nan older child, a teenager, or an adult. Best\u2019s theory of L2 learning centres around the concepts of phonemes and\nallophones.\nBest predicts that there are two kinds of phoneme contrasts that are easy to learn in an L2. If the L2 has a\nphoneme contrast that maps onto a phoneme contrast in the learner\u2019s L1, then that contrast should be easy to\nlearn in the L2. She also predicts that if the L2 has a phoneme contrast that\u2019s completely new, with two segments\nthat don\u2019t exist at all in the learner\u2019s L1, then this contrast should be easy as well because the learner can set up\ntwo new phoneme categories from scratch.\nThe kind of phoneme contrast that\u2019s hard to learn is when two contrasting phonemes in the L2 map onto a single\nphoneme category in the learner\u2019s L1. In this case, the learner will have spent a lifetime treating the phonetic\ndifference as allophonic variation, and not a meaningful contrast, so it\u2019s a challenge to learn to pay attention to\nthe difference as meaningful.\nCatherine Best and her colleagues have tested this theory by investigating how English-speaking adults learn\nphonemic contrasts in Zulu. Zulu is a language that has about 27 million speakers, most of them in South\nAfrica. First, researchers asked the English-speakers to tell the difference between voiced and voiceless lateral\nfricatives in Zulu. English doesn\u2019t have lateral fricatives, but English does have lots of pairs of fricatives that\ncontrast in their voicing, so the theory predicts that it should be easy for English listeners to map the voicing\ndifference between the Zulu fricatives onto those English voicing contrasts and recognize this phonetic difference.\nAnd that prediction was upheld: The English listeners were about 95% correct.\nThen they asked the English speakers to tell the difference between three Zulu clicks: a dental, an alveolar,\nand a palato-alveolar click. English doesn\u2019t have any clicks at all, so the English listeners should be able to simply\npay attention to the phonetic differences between these segments, without any interference from their English\nphonology. The English listeners were about 80% correct at these sounds.\nLast, they asked the English listeners to tell the difference between two different kinds of bilabial stops in Zulu:\nthe plosive stop is similar to the English /b/ sound. The other is an implosive /\u0253/, which is made by obstructing\nairflow at the lips, but when the stop is released, air flows into the mouth instead of out of the mouth. The English\nadults were only about 65% correct at hearing this difference, not a whole lot better than chance. This is consistent\nwith Best\u2019s proposal that because the English listeners have only one phoneme category for voiced bilabial stops,\ntheir mental grammar simply treats the implosive as an allophone of that phoneme. So it\u2019s very hard to hear the\nphonetic difference between the two sounds in the L2 because the mental grammar of the L1 considers them\nboth members of the same phoneme category. 5.3 Adults Learning L2 Phonotactics\nIn addition to the phonemic contrasts in an L2, the phonetic inventory and the phonotactic constraints of an L2 can also be\nchallenging for adult language learners, because of the influence of their L1 grammar.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=588\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe saw in the previous section that it can be challenging for an adult to learn the phonemic contrasts in a\nsecond (or third or fourth) language, because the grammar of your L1 shapes your perception in a language that\nlearn later. The phonemic contrasts aren\u2019t the only thing that make language learning challenging for adults. The\nphonetic inventory and phonotactic constraints are parts of the mental grammar that also pose a challenge.\nThe phonetic inventory is simply the set of segments that are present in the grammar. You\u2019ve become pretty\ngood at transcribing English, which (depending on your variety) has around 25 consonants and 14 vowels.\nCompared to many other languages, that\u2019s a lot of vowels, so the vowels can be particularly tricky for English\nlearners. In contrast, Hawaiian, the Indigenous language spoken in the Hawaiian islands, has only eight\nconsonants and five vowels. And on the other end of the spectrum is Adyghe, one of the Circassian languages\nspoken in Russia and Turkey. Adyghe has only three vowels, but (depending on the dialect), between 50 and 50\nconsonants, including 18 different stops, ten affricates, and 24 fricatives!\nIf the language you\u2019re learning includes segments you haven\u2019t yet learned to produce, you\u2019re likely to make a\nsubstitution with a segment you do have in your language. If you have a name that isn\u2019t English, you\u2019ve probably\nhad the experience of English-speakers making substitutions in your name. For example, the Hebrew name Baruch\n[ba\u027e\u028ax] ends with a velar fricative [x], but English speakers often pronounce it with a velar stop instead [ba\u0279uk].\nLikewise, the Tamil name Kavitha [kavit\u032aa] has a dental stop in the onset of the last syllable, which English speakers\noften turn into a flap [k\u0259vi\u027e\u028c] or into a dental fricative [k\u0259vi\u03b8\u028c].\nThe other challenge for learning an L2 is the phonotactics. Phonotactic constraints are restrictions in the mental\ngrammar on what sounds can appear in what positions, and what syllable structures are possible. For example,\nthe velar nasal [\u014b] is part of the phonetic inventory of English, but it never appears in the onset of a word, only\nin coda position, like in lung, tank, and singer. Vietnamese also has the velar nasal in its phonetic inventory, but it\nallows this segment in onset position, like in the very common surname Nguyen and the word nghe, which means\nlisten.\nPhonotactics also constrain the possible syllable structures in a grammar. In Chapter 3 we saw that English can\nhave a whole lot of consonants in coda position, and can also have a lot of consonants in syllable onsets. So a word\nlike strengths has three consonants in the onset and four in the coda! English also allows much simpler syllables,\nlike nice, or odd, and even syllables with nothing in the onset or coda, like eye.\nBut some languages have much tighter phonotactic constraints on their syllable structure. When you\u2019re\nspeaking an L2, you often adapt the shape of the words to fit the phonotactics of the grammar of your L1. Likewise,\nwhen a language borrows words from another language, the loanword gets adapted.\nA famous example comes from Hawaiian. Remember we saw above that Hawaiian has only eight consonants\nand five vowels in its phonetic inventory. And there are only two possible syllable structures: either a syllable can\nhave one consonant in its onset, or no consonant. There are no coda consonants in Hawaiian, and no consonant 136 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nclusters. So when Hawaiian borrows the English word Christmas, there\u2019s a lot of adaptation to do. Those five\nconsonants in English can fit into two syllables: two in the onset of the first syllable and one in the coda, then one\neach in the onset and coda of the second syllable.\nBut in Hawaiian, the only position a consonant can go is in the onset, and then only one at a time. So this\nloanword in Hawaiian has five syllables. [k\u0279\u026a] becomes [kali] (with the [l] substituting for English [\u0279]). Then the [s]\nfrom the coda of the first syllable gets a substitution and its own syllable, and the two consonants from the\nsecond syllable in English get their own syllables each in Hawaiian. So the Hawaiian adaptation of the English word\nChristmas is [kalikimaka].\nLoanwords are a common place to observe articulatory processes. For example, when English speakers are\ntalking about skiing in Gdansk, they usually epenthesize an extra schwa between the first two consonants, because\n[gd] isn\u2019t a possible onset in English. Or when English borrows the German name Pfeiffer, the stop at the beginning\ngets deleted because [pf] isn\u2019t a possible onset.\nAll of these adaptations are a normal part of learning an L2, and they result from the fact that our mind applies\nthe grammatical structures and constraints of our L1 grammar to our L2. 5.4 Attitudes about Accents\nWhen you learn an L2 as an adult, it\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll sound like a native speaker, so it\u2019s likely that L1 speakers will notice\nyour accent.

Well, actually, everybody has an accent. It\u2019s\njust that if someone\u2019s accent is pretty similar to your own accent, you don\u2019t really notice it. You only notice accents\nthat are different from your own accent.\nSo a better way of asking this question would be why do L2 speakers have accents that are different from L1\nspeakers? We saw in the last unit that the mental grammar of an L2 speaker is influenced by their experience of\ntheir native language, their L1. So the accent of an L1 Mandarin speaker in English is going to be different from the\naccent of an L1 Dutch speaker.\nNow the thing about having an accent that is noticeably different is that people will notice it because it\u2019s\ndifferent. When I moved to Chicago in 1998 after having lived in Ontario for 25 years, people said to me, \u201cYou\nsound weird. Are you Canadian?\u201d My vowels were different from Chicago vowels, and people in Chicago noticed\nthat difference. I didn\u2019t really experience any negative consequences of sounding like a Canadian while living in the\nUS, but if you have an accent that\u2019s different from the people you spend time with, you might have experienced\nstigma. If an accent is stigmatized that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad or inferior in some way \u2014 remember that linguistics\ndoesn\u2019t rate or rank languages or accents. But if it\u2019s stigmatized, that means people have negative attitudes and\nexpectations about that accent. In places where the majority of people speak English, there\u2019s often a stigma\ntowards people who aren\u2019t native speakers, who learned English as adults. But there are also some varieties\nof L1 English whose speakers experience stigma, such as African-American English, the varieties spoken in the\nsoutheastern United States, and in Canada, Newfoundland English.\nFor people whose accent is different from the mainstream, there can be many negative consequences. You\u2019re\nless likely to get a job interview, and your boss might not recognize your skills. It\u2019s harder to find a landlord who\u2019s\nwilling to rent you an apartment. If you have to go to court, what you say won\u2019t be taken as seriously, and the\ncourt reporter is likelier to make mistakes in transcribing your testimony. Kids whose accents aren\u2019t mainstream\nare disproportionately labelled with learning disabilities and streamed out of academic classrooms into special ed.\nAnd probably Alexa, Siri, and Google won\u2019t understand your requests!\nWhy do these things happen? Well, in the case of Alexa, it\u2019s because the training data doesn\u2019t include enough\nvariation in dialects and accents. But the rest of these situations arise from people\u2019s expectations, and their\nexpectations come from their experiences and their attitudes. Now, for issues of stigma, it\u2019s hard to observe\npeople\u2019s attitudes directly, because by and large it\u2019s not socially acceptable to express negative attitudes towards\nminority groups. So instead, researchers use a technique called a matched-guise study to try to draw conclusions\nabout attitudes.\nA matched-guise study works like this. The researchers present participants with some kind of stimulus. In the\noriginal 1950 experiment using this technique, the stimulus was yearbook pictures from a local university. They\nhold the stimulus constant, and change the guise that it appears in. So in 1950, the guise was the name that 5.4 ATTITUDES ABOUT ACCENTS 139\nlabelled the yearbook picture. One group saw the pictures with so-called American names, and another group saw\nthe pictures with Italian or Irish names. Then the researchers asked their participants to rate the people in the\npictures as to their Beauty, Intelligence, Ambition, and Entertainingness.\nThe core idea in a matched-guise study is that if you find a difference in your participants\u2019 ratings, that difference\ncan\u2019t be because of the stimulus, because you\u2019ve held the stimulus constant. Any difference in ratings must be\nbecause of the guise \u2014 the way you labelled your stimuli. I\u2019ll leave you to guess how the ratings in that 1950 study\ndiffered with the different guises.\nMolly Babel and Jamie Russell, two linguists at the University of British Columbia, conducted a matched-guise\nstudy with UBC students as listeners. They recorded the voices of several people who were native speakers\nof English, who had grown up in Canada. These recordings were the stimulus. Then when they played these\nrecordings to the listeners, they presented them either as audio-only, with a picture of the face of a White\nCanadian person, or with a picture of a Chinese Canadian person. For any given voice, the listeners rated the talker\nas having a stronger accent when they saw a Chinese Canadian face than when they saw a White Canadian face,\nand they were also less accurate at writing down the sentences the talker said. Apparently the faces influenced\nhow well the listeners understood the talkers.\nDr. Babel interprets their results as a mismatch of expectations. In Richmond, BC, where they conducted their\nstudy, more than 40% of the population speaks either Cantonese or Mandarin. If you live in Richmond, you have a\ngreater chance of encountering L1 Chinese speakers in your daily life than L1 English speakers. So when you see\na face that appears Chinese, you have an expectation, based on your daily experience, that that person\u2019s accent is\ngoing to be Chinese. If the person\u2019s accent turns out to be that of a native speaker of English, the mismatch with\nyour expectations makes it harder to understand what they say.\nSo we\u2019ve seen that people\u2019s expectations, their experiences and their attitudes can lead to stigma for speakers\nwith accents that are different from the mainstream. And that stigma can have serious, real-life consequences on\npeople\u2019s employment and housing and education. But there can be consequences for listeners too!\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time understanding someone whose accent is different from yours, that could have\nserious consequences, for example if you\u2019re getting medical advice or trying to learn something new. It\u2019s pretty\ncommon for L1 English speakers to argue that L2 speakers should try to \u201creduce\u201d their accents, but as linguists\nwe know that that\u2019s hard to do after childhood, because your L2 grammar is shaped by your L1 experience.\nFortunately, linguistics research also tells us that even though it\u2019s hard to change how you speak an L2, it\u2019s\nrelatively easy to change how you hear someone speaking an L2.\nJust as our experience and our expectations can lead to stigma, our experience also influences our perception.\nThe more experience we have listening to someone, the better we understand what they say: this is called\nperceptual adaptation. Perceptual adaptation was first shown for a single talker: the longer listeners had to\nlisten to an unfamiliar talker, the more they understood of what the talker said. Extensions of that research have\nalso shown that experience listening to several speakers with a particular accent makes it easier to understand\na new speaker with that same accent. And it turns out that listening to a whole variety of different unfamiliar\naccents then makes it easier to understand a new talker with a completely different accent. In short, the more\nexperience we have listening to someone, the more familiarity we have with their voice or their accent, and the\nmore familiarity we have, the better we\u2019ll understand what they\u2019re saying.\nSo if you are listening to someone whose accent is different from yours the best way to understand them is to\nlisten more. And if you\u2019re talking to someone and they\u2019re finding your accent unfamiliar, you can say to them, just\nlisten more! Practice Time\nExercise 1. Look back at Exercise 3 in Chapter 4. Given what you concluded about the phonology of Japanese in\nthat exercise, predict whether it would likely be easy or difficult for an L1 speaker of Japanese to learn the English\ncontrast between words like sip/ship, sign/shine, class/clash. Explain how you arrived at your conclusion.\nExercise 2. Look again at Exercise 2 in Chapter 4. In that exercise, you concluded that German has a phoneme\n[\u0283] that contrasts with another phoneme that has two allophones, [x] and [\u00e7] (a voiceless velar fricative and\nvoiceless palatal fricative, respectively). Given what you know about English phonology, how easy or difficult will it\nbe for an L1 speaker of English to learn this contrast in German? Explain how you arrived at your conclusion.\n140 Summary\nYou\u2019ve now learned that infants acquire the phonemic categories of their native language very young, even before\nthey can reliably produce sounds or words! This is one of the reasons that it can be challenging to learn another\nlanguage when we\u2019re older, because our mind has already set up phoneme categories for our native language\nand has learned to efficiently categorize speech sounds into these native categories. Learning a new language\ncan involve dividing up existing categories into new ones, shifting the boundaries of our L1 categories, or creating\nentirely new categories for our L2.\n141  CHAPTER 6: WORD FORMS\nIn this chapter, we look more closely at words and at the meaningful pieces that combine to create words \u2014\nmorphemes. When you\u2019ve finished this chapter, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\u2022 identify whether a word is monomorphemic or polymorphemic,\n\u2022 identify the morphemes that make up a polymorphemic word,\n\u2022 distinguish between inflectional morphemes and derivational morphemes.\n143  6.1 Words and Morphemes\nWhat\u2019s a word? It seems almost silly to ask such a simple question, but if you think about it, the question doesn\u2019t\nhave an obvious answer. A famous linguist named Ferdinand de Saussure said that a word is like a coin because\nit has two sides to it that can never be separated. One side of this metaphorical coin is the form of a word: the\nsounds (or letters) that combine to make the spoken or written word. The other side of the coin is the meaning of\nthe word: the image or concept we have in our mind when we use the word. So a word is something that links a\ngiven form with a given meaning.\nLinguists have also noticed that words behave in a way that other elements of mental grammar don\u2019t because\nwords are free. What does it mean for a word to be free? One observation that leads us to say that words are free\nis that they can appear in isolation, on their own. In ordinary conversation, we don\u2019t often utter just a single word,\nbut there are plenty of contexts in which a single word is indeed an entire utterance. Here are some examples:\nWhat are you doing? Cooking.\nWhat are you cooking? Soup.\nHow does it taste? Delicious.\nCan I have some? No.\nEach of those single words is perfectly grammatical standing in isolation as the answer to a question.\nAnother reason we say that words are free is that they\u2019re moveable: they can occupy a whole variety of different\npositions in a sentence. Look at these examples:\nPenny is making soup.\nSoup is delicious.\nI love to eat soup when it\u2019s cold outside.\nThe word soup can appear as the last word in a sentence, as the first word, or in the middle of a sentence. It\u2019s\nfree to be moved around.\nThe other important observation we can make about words is that they\u2019re inseparable: We can\u2019t break them up\nby putting other pieces inside them. For example, in the sentence,\nPenny cooked some carrots.\nThe word carrot has a bit of information added to the end of it to show that there\u2019s more than one carrot. But\nthat bit of information can\u2019t go just anywhere: it can\u2019t interrupt the word carrot:\n*Penny cooked some car-s-rot.\nThis might seem like a trivial observation \u2013 of course, you can\u2019t break words up into bits! \u2013 but if we look at a\nword that\u2019s a little more complex than carrots we see that it\u2019s an important insight. What about:\nPenny bought two vegetable peelers.\nThat\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s totally impossible to say:\n*Penny bought two vegetables peeler.\neven though she probably uses the peeler to peel multiple vegetables. It\u2019s not that a plural -s can\u2019t go on the\nend of the word vegetable; it\u2019s that the word vegetable peeler is a single word (even though we spell it with a space\nbetween the two parts of it). And because it\u2019s a single word, it\u2019s inseparable, so we can\u2019t add anything else into the\nmiddle of it.\n145 146 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nSo we\u2019ve seen that a word is a free form that has a meaning. But you\u2019ve probably already noticed that there\nare other forms that have meaning and some of them seem to be smaller than whole words. A morpheme is\nthe smallest form that has meaning. Some morphemes are free: they can appear in isolation. (This means\nthat some words are also morphemes.) But some morphemes can only ever appear when they\u2019re attached to\nsomething else; these are called bound morphemes.\nLet\u2019s go back to that simple sentence,\nPenny cooked some carrots.\nIt\u2019s quite straightforward to say that this sentence has four words in it. We can make the observations we just\ndiscussed above to check for isolation, moveability, and inseparability to provide evidence that each of Penny,\ncooked, some, and carrots is a word. But there are more than four units of meaning in the sentence.\nPenny cook-ed some carrot-s.\nThe word cooked is made up of the word cook plus another small form that tells us that the cooking happened\nin the past. And the word carrots is made up of carrot plus a bit that tells us that there\u2019s more than one carrot.\nThat little bit that\u2019s spelled \u2013ed (and pronounced a few different ways depending on the environment) has\na consistent meaning in English: past tense. We can easily think of several other examples where that form\nhas that meaning, like walked, baked, cleaned, kicked, kissed. This \u2013ed unit appears consistently in this form and\nconsistently has this meaning, but it never appears in isolation: it\u2019s always attached at the end of a word. It\u2019s a\nbound morpheme. For example, if someone tells you, \u201cI need you to walk the dog,\u201d it\u2019s not grammatical to answer\n\u201c-ed\u201d to indicate that you already walked the dog.\nLikewise, the bit that\u2019s spelled \u2013s or \u2013es (and pronounced a few different ways) has a consistent meaning in\nmany different words, like carrots, bananas, books, skates, cars, dishes, and many others. Like \u2013ed, it is not free: it\ncan\u2019t appear in isolation. It\u2019s a bound morpheme too.\nIf a word is made up of just one morpheme, like banana, swim, hungry, then we say that it\u2019s morphologically\nsimple, or monomorphemic.\nBut many words have more than one morpheme in them: they\u2019re morphologically complex or\npolymorphemic. In English, polymorphemic words are usually made up of a root plus one or more affixes. The\nroot morpheme is the single morpheme that determines the core meaning of the word. In most cases in English,\nthe root is a morpheme that could be free. The affixes are bound morphemes. English has affixes that attach\nto the end of a root; these are called suffixes, like in books, teaching, happier, hopeful, singer. And English also has\naffixes that attach to the beginning of a word, called prefixes, like in unzip, reheat, disagree, impossible.\nSome languages have bound morphemes that go into the middle of a word; these are called infixes. Here are\nsome examples from Tagalog (a language with about 24 million speakers, most of them in the Philippines).\n[takbuh] run [tumakbuh] ran\n[lakad] walk [lumakad] walked\n[bili] buy [bumili] bought\n[kain] eat [kumain] ate\nIt might seem like the existence of infixes is a problem for our claim above that words are inseparable. But\nlanguages that allow infixation do so in a systematic way \u2014 the infix can\u2019t be dropped just anywhere in the word.\nIn Tagalog, the position of the infix depends on the organization of the syllables in the word. 6.2 Allomorphs\nThe previous unit showed us that a morpheme is the smallest unit that pairs a consistent form with a consistent\nmeaning. But when we say that the form of a morpheme is consistent, there\u2019s still some room for variability in\nthe form. Think back to what you know about phonology and remember that a given phoneme can show up\nas different allophones depending on the surrounding environment. Morphemes work the same way: a given\nmorpheme might have more than one allomorph. Allomorphs are forms that are related to each other but slightly\ndifferent, depending on the surrounding environment.\nA simple example is the English word a. It means something like \u201cone of something, but not any particular one\u201d,\nlike in these examples:\na book\na skirt\na friend\na phone call\nBut if the word following a begins with a vowel and not a consonant, then the word a changes its form:\nan apple\nan ice cream cone\nan iguana\nan idea\nThe two forms a and an are slightly different in their form, but they clearly both have the same meaning. And\neach one shows up in a different predictable environment: a before words that start with consonants and an\nbefore words that begin with vowels.\nAnother example of allomorphy in English is in the plural morpheme. In written English, the form of the plural\nmorpheme is spelled -s, as in:\ncarrots\nbooks\nhats\nfriends\napples\niguanas\nBut it\u2019s spelled \u2013es in words like:\nchurches\nbushes\nquizzes\nAnd in fact, even in the cases where it\u2019s spelled -s, it\u2019s pronounced as [s] for words that end in a voiceless\nsegment (carrots, books, cliffs) and as [z] for words that end in voiced sounds (worms, dogs, birds). So it\u2019s got two\nwritten forms (-s and -es) and three spoken forms ([s], [z], [\u0268z]), but a consistent meaning of \u201cmore than one\u201d. Each\nform is an allomorph of the plural morpheme. Can you figure out what the relevant environment is that predicts\nwhich allomorph appears where?\n147 6.3 Inflectional Morphology\nBound morphemes can do one of two different jobs. Inflectional morphology conveys grammatical information, such as\nnumber, tense, agreement or case. English has relatively few inflectional morphemes, but many other languages have much\nricher systems of inflectional morphology.\n148 6.3 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY 149\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=117\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe saw in our last units that words can be made up of morphemes, which are the smallest linguistic unit that links\nform with meaning. Morphemes can do a couple of quite different jobs in a word.\nInflectional morphemes are morphemes that add grammatical information to a word. When a word is\ninflected, it still retains its core meaning, and its category stays the same. We\u2019ve actually already talked about\nseveral different inflectional morphemes:\nThe number on a noun is inflectional morphology. For most English nouns the inflectional morpheme for the\nplural is an \u2013s or \u2013es (e.g., books, cars, dishes) that gets added to the singular form of the noun, but there are\nalso a few words with irregular plural morphemes. Some languages also have a special morpheme for the dual\nnumber, to indicate exactly two of something. Here\u2019s an example from Manam, one of the many languages spoken\nin Papua New Guinea. You can see that there\u2019s a morpheme on the noun woman that indicates dual, for exactly\ntwo women, and a different morpheme for plural, that is, more than two women.\nManam (Papua New Guinea)\n/\u00e1ine \u014bara/ that woman singular\n/\u00e1ine \u014baradiaru/ those two women dual\n/\u00e1ine \u014baradi/ those women plural\nThe tense on a verb is also inflectional morphology. For many English verbs, the past tense is spelled with an\n\u2013ed, (walked, cooked, climbed) but there are also many English verbs where the tense inflection is indicated with a\nchange in the vowel of the verb (sang, wrote, ate). English does not have a bound morpheme that indicates future\ntense, but many languages do. 150 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nAnother kind of inflectional morphology is agreement on verbs. If you\u2019ve learned French or Spanish or Italian,\nyou know that the suffix at the end of a verb changes depending on who the subject of the verb is. That\u2019s\nagreement inflection. Here are some examples from French. You can see that there\u2019s a different morpheme on\nthe end of each verb depending on who\u2019s doing the singing.\nFrench\n1st je chante I sing\n2d tu chantes you sing\n3d elle chante she sings\n1st nous chantons we sing\n2d vous chantez you (pl.) sing\n3d elles chantent they sing\nAnd in some languages, the morphology on a noun changes depending on the noun\u2019s role in a sentence; this is\ncalled case inflection. Take a look at these two sentences in German: The first one, Der Junge sieht Sofia, means\nthat, \u201cThe boy sees Sofia\u201d. Look at the form of the phrase, the boy, \u201cder Junge\u201d. Now, look at this other sentence,\nSofia sieht den Jungen, which means that \u201cSofia sees the boy\u201d. In the first sentence, the boy is doing the seeing, but\nin the second, the boy is getting seen, and the word for boy, Junge has a different morpheme on it to indicate its\ndifferent role in the sentence. That\u2019s an example of case morphology, which is another kind of inflection.\nGerman\nDer Junge sieht Sofia. The boy sees Sofia.\nSofia sieht den Jungen Sofia sees the boy. 6.4 Derivational Morphology\nThe other job that morphemes do is derivation, the process that creates new words. In English, one of the most common\nways to derive a new word is by adding a derivational affix to a base. The newly-derived word can then serve as a base for\nanother affix.\n151 152 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=119\nCHECK YOURSELF\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=119\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nThe last unit talked about inflection, which is one of the jobs that morphology can do. The other big job that\nmorphemes have is a derivation. The derivation is the process of creating a new word. The new, derived word\nis related to the original word, but it has some new component of meaning to it, and often it belongs to a new\ncategory.\nOne of the most common ways that English derives new words is by affixing a derivational morpheme to a base.\nFor example, if we start with a verb that describes an action, like teach and we add the morpheme \u2013er, we derive\na morphologically complex noun, teacher, that refers to the person who does the action of teaching. That same -er\nmorpheme does the same job in singer, dancer, baker, and writer.\nVerb Suffix Noun\nteach -er teacher\nsing -er singer\ndance -er dancer\nbake -er baker\nwrite -er writer\nIf we start with an adjective like happy and add the suffix \u2013ness, we derive the noun that refers to the state of being\nthat adjective, happiness. 6.4 DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY 153\nVerb Suffix Noun\nteach -er teacher\nsing -er singer\ndance -er dancer\nbake -er baker\nwrite -er writer\nAdding the suffix \u2013ful to a noun derives an adjective, like hopeful.\nNoun Suffix Adjective\nhope -ful hopeful\njoy -ful joyful\ncare -ful careful\ndread -ful dreadful\nAdding the suffix\u2013ize to an adjective like final derives a verb like finalize.\nAdjective Suffix Verb\nfinal -ize finalize\nmodern -ize modernize\nsocial -ize socialize\npublic -ize publicize\nNotice that each of the morphologically complex derived words is related in meaning to the base, but it has a new\nmeaning of its own. English also derives new words by prefixing, and while adding a derivational prefix does lead\nto a new word with a new meaning, it often doesn\u2019t lead to a category change.\nPrefix Verb Verb\nre- write rewrite\nre- read reread\nre- examine reexamine\nre- assess reassess\nEach instance of derivation creates a new word, and that new word could then serve as the base for another\ninstance of derivation, so it\u2019s possible to have words that are quite complex morphologically.\nFor example, say you have a machine that you use to compute things; you might call it a computer (compute\n+ -er).Then if people start using that machine to perform a task, you could say that they\u2019re going to computerize\n(computer + -ize) that task. Perhaps the computerization (computerize + -ation) of that task makes it much more\nefficient. You can see how many words have many steps in their derivations.\nAn interesting thing to note is that once a base has been inflected, then it can no longer go through any\nderivations. We can inflect the word computer so that we can talk about plural computers, but then we can\u2019t do\nderivation on the plural form (*computers-ize). Likewise, we can add tense inflection to the verb computerize and\ntalk about how yesterday we computerized something, but then we can\u2019t take that inflected form and use it as the\nbase for a new derivation (*computerized-ation). Inflection always occurs as the last step in word formation. 6.5 Inflectional Morphology in Some Indigenous\nLanguages\nTalking about morphology when your primary language is English is sometimes a little disappointing because\nEnglish does not have very much inflectional morphology. Many other languages do much more interesting jobs\nwith inflectional morphology. Many of the Indigenous Languages spoken by the First Peoples of what is currently\nCanada have rich morphological systems that communicate a great deal of information.\nNUMBER IN INUKTITUT\nInuktitut is one of the dialects spoken by the Inuit people who live in the Arctic region. There is a good deal of\ndialect variation across the Inuit languages. Inuktitut is the variety that is the official language of the territory of\nNunavut, and has about 40,000 speakers.\nAll languages make a distinction between singular and plural nouns, but some languages, like Inuktitut, also use\ninflectional morphology to indicate dual number when there are exactly two of something, as in the following\nexamples:\nmatu door\nmatuuk doors (two)\nmatuit doors (three or more)\nnuvuja cloud\nnuvujaak clouds (two)\nnuvujait clouds (three or more)\nqarasaujaq computer\nqarasaujaak computers (two)\nqarasaujait computers (three or more)\nSUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT IN INUKTITUT\nThe three-way distinction between singular, dual, and plural in Inuktitut applies not only to nouns but also to verbs\nthat agree with their noun subjects:\nnirijunga I eat\nnirijuguk the two of us eat\nnirijugut we (three or more) eat\n154 6.5 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY IN SOME INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES 155\nnirijutit you (one of you) eat\nnirijusik you two eat\nnirijusi you (three or more) eat\nnirijuq he or she eats\nnirijuuk the two of them eat\nnirijut they (three or more) eat\nANIMACY IN CREE\nThe Cree languages are the Indigenous languages that have the greatest number of speakers, about 80,000\naccording to Statistics Canada\u2019s 2016 Census.\nYou might know a language that categorizes nouns according to their gender, like French, which makes a\ndistinction between masculine and feminine nouns, adjectives, and determiners. Of course, grammatical gender\nhas a quite arbitrary relationship to concepts of social and biological gender. Other languages categorize nouns\nalong different criteria. Cree distinguishes words along a dimension called animacy. The animacy distinction is\napproximately related to whether something is alive or not, but the categories for animate vs. inanimate things\nare somewhat arbitrary, just the like the categories for masculine vs. feminine things in languages that mark\ngrammatical gender. The animacy of a noun affects which demonstrative determiners may be used with it, the\nform of the plural morphology, and the morphology of the verb that agrees with it.\nIn Plains Cree (N\u00eahiyaw\u00eawin), the noun atim (dog) is animate, while astotin (hat) is inanimate. The sentences\nbelow shows how the noun\u2019s animacy affects the other words in the sentence.\nanimate inanimate\nsingular atimdog astotinhat\nplural atimwakdogs astotinahats\nsingular demonstrative awa atimthis dog \u00f4ma astotinthis hat\nplural demonstrative \u00f4ki atimwakthese dogs \u00f4hi astotinathese hats\nsingular transitive verb niw\u00e2pam\u00e2w atim.I see a dog. niw\u00e2paht\u00ean astotinI see a hat.\nplural transitive verb niw\u00e2pam\u00e2wak atimwak.I see dogs. niw\u00e2paht\u00ean astotinaI see hats.\nPRONOUNS\nAll languages make at least a three-way distinction among pronouns \u2014 the first person (I/me in English) is the\nperson talking; second person (you) is the person being addressed, and third person (she, he, they, it, etc.) is\nanybody or anything else. Some languages make even more distinctions in pronouns.\nIn Ojibwe (Anishnaabemowin), which has about 20,000 speakers, there are two pronouns for the first-person\nplural. The pronoun niinwi refers to the speaker plus other people but not the person being addressed (that is, \u201cwe\nbut not you\u201d). This is known as the exclusive we. The pronoun for inclusive we (\u201call of us including you\u201d) is kiinwi.\nThe distinction between inclusive and exclusive we is sometimes referred to as clusivity.\nCree also makes an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first-person plural. The inclusive form is niyan\u00e2n and\nthe exclusive form is kiy\u00e2naw. 156 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nSUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT IN CREE\nIn the third person, Cree makes a distinction between proximate and obviative third person. You might think\nof this distinction as something similar to the near/far distinction between this and that in English, where this is\nused for something that is closer to the speaker and that is for something farther away. But, like in English, the\nproximate/obviative distinction is not just about physical distance; it can also allude to distance in time, or within a\nconversation, to someone that has been mentioned recently (proximate) versus someone that is being mentioned\nfor the first time (obviative). The distinction is marked on the verbal morphology, as illustrated below:\nRegina w\u00eekiwak. kiskinwaham\u00e2kosiwak.\nproximate\nThey live in Regina. They are in school.\nRegina w\u00eekiyiwa. kiskinwaham\u00e2kosiyiwa.\nobviative\nTheir friend/someone else lives in Regina. Their friend/someone else is in school.\nThese few examples illustrate that the rich morphological systems of these languages can communicate a great\ndeal of information efficiently. 6.6 Creating New Words\nLanguages are constantly adding new words. Some of those new words are formed by affixation, and some by processes\nthat are less productive, but more entertaining!\n157 158 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

And in fact, one of the fastest ways that\nlanguages change, and the easiest way to observe, is by new words entering the language.\nThere are all kinds of different ways that new words can make their way into a language. It\u2019s possible to coin a\nnew word, that is, to create a completely new form that hasn\u2019t existed before. So I made up this form vrang; I don\u2019t\nknow what it means because I just made it up. But that was pretty hard to do \u2014 any new form I tried to make up\nturned out to have some obscure definition. So brand new coinages are possible, but they don\u2019t actually happen\nvery often.\nOne way that English gets a lot of new words is by borrowing them from other languages. For example, the\nWelsh word hiraeth means longing or yearning. It\u2019s become common enough for English-speakers to use this\nWelsh word that in 2020, the Oxford English Dictionary added it. You can probably think of many other common\nEnglish words that started out as borrowings from other languages and became deeply embedded in the English\nlexicon, like anime, from Japanese, limousine from French, and boomerang from Australian Indigenous languages.\nOf course, one of the most obvious ways to derive a new words is with an affix. You might recognize the\nsuffix \u2013ology, which usually means \u201cthe study of\u201d. So mythology involves studying myths, criminology is the\nstudy of criminality, and epidemiology is the study of epidemics. The Oxford English Dictionary recently added\ngarbageology, the study of a society or community by investigating what people consider to be garbage.\nIn English, affixation is one of the most productive ways to derive new words: No matter what the word is, you\ncan almost always add an affix to derive a new, related word from it. Some other new affixed words that have\nfound their way into the dictionary are enoughness, farmette (a small farm), and unfathom.\nAnother extremely productive way of deriving new words in English is by compounding, that is, by taking two 6.6 CREATING NEW WORDS 159\nexisting words, both of which are free morphemes, and sticking them together. For example, the year 2020 saw\nthe words plant-based, jerkweed, and delete key added to the dictionary. You can learn more about compounds in\nChapter 7.\nSo we can say that productivity is a property of morphological processes in the grammar of a language. A given\nprocess is productive if it\u2019s one that the language uses a lot, and uses to generate new forms. For example, in\nEnglish the plural morpheme spelled \u2013s is extremely common, and we see it on words like socks, cars, bananas,\nstars, and thousands of others. In contrast, a plural affix \u2013en is very rare in English: we see it on the plural forms\nchildren, oxen, and the very old-fashioned word brethren, but pretty much nowhere else. And if we coin a new word,\nlike vrang, and then decide we have more than one vrang, the plural we use is going to be vrangs, not vrangen.\nIf you look through the lists of new words that get added to dictionaries each year, you\u2019ll see that besides\naffixation and compounding, there are other morphological processes that occur in English. Here are some of\nthem.\nOne thing that English does a lot is take a word from one syntactic category and just move it to another category\nwith a new meaning. For example, the old meaning of ghost is the noun meaning, and then there\u2019s the newer verb\nmeaning, where if you ghost someone you just stop replying to their messages and kind of disappear from their\nlife. Not very nice! Likewise, catfish and sundown have newer, verb meanings that are different from their original\ncompound noun meanings.\nAcronyms pretty frequently make their way into English and some of them stick around, especially in typed\nform online, like a link that\u2019s not-safe-for-work, the classic LOL, and of course, \u201ctoo long ,didn\u2019t read\u201d.\nClipping happens when we take a long word and just clip part of it off. Usually the meaning doesn\u2019t change,\nbut often the clipped form becomes much more frequent then the long form. Does anyone even know that fax is\nshortened from facsimile? And certainly no-one talks about electronic mail anymore.\nA few years ago clipping had a brief moment in the way some young people talked, so you might have an outfit\nthat\u2019s totes adorbs, or a relaish that\u2019s not serious, just cazh. This trend seems to have lost its popularity, the way\nlanguage fads often do.\nThe word-formation process that I\u2019ve left for last is my favourite because I find a lot of them so funny. That\u2019s the\nblend, or portmanteau, the process whereby two words are kind of jammed together, but not in a compound.\nInstead some parts of the two words overlap with each other, like when spoon and fork combine to make spork.\nThe best blends, the ones that stick around in the language and become permanent, seem to share a syllable\nlike the second syllable in both hungry and angry, or at least share some segments and the rhythmic pattern,\nlike athleisure. And then there are some that just seem to be trying too hard, peanutritious, Christmasketball, and\n(shudder) covidpreneur. I\u2019m no prescriptivist, but I hope these words die a quick death.\nAll these words are examples of the generativity of grammar. Languages are constantly adding new words,\nusing the productive morphological processes that are part of the grammar. Pay attention to the new words you\ndiscover as you read and listen, and see if you can figure out how they\u2019re formed. Summary\nIn this chapter, we saw that many words are made up of meaningful pieces called morphemes. In English, the\nmost common bound morphemes are suffixes and prefixes, which can be affixed to words to derive new words, or\ncan convey grammatical information via inflection. Although English has a very productive system of derivational\nmorphology, its inflectional morphology is quite sparse. We looked at some Indigenous languages to examine the\nkinds of grammatical information that can be represented with inflectional morphemes.\n160 Practice Time\nExercise 1. For each of the following words, identify the affix(es) in the word. For each affix, say whether it is\nderivational or inflectional. For inflectional affixes, say what grammatical information the affix indicates.\npurity\nnewest\nmisunderstand\nCanadian\nunlikely\nweaken\nnieces\nexpectantly\nExercise 2. The regular English plural morpheme has several allomorphs, including two different spellings (-s\nand -es) and three different pronunciations [s, z, \u0268z]. Say the following words aloud to yourself and determine\nwhich allomorph appears on each word. The form of the allomorph depends on the final sound in the base. What\nis the natural class of sounds that predicts the appearance of each allomorph?\nbooks chips buses fans\ntomatoes wishes cuffs farms\ncars judges shirts rainbows\nquizzes myths gloves flies\ngrapes caves peas toys\nclocks beaches dances\n161  CHAPTER 7: COMBINING WORDS\nIn this chapter, we start observing how words behave so that we can group them into categories. Syntactic\ncategories, which you might think of as \u201cparts of speech\u201d, group words that behave similarly into similar categories.\nOnce we\u2019ve figured out what category a word belongs to, we can predict how it will interact with other words from\nother categories, for example in compound words (Unit 7.2), and in phrases and sentences (Unit 8.4).\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 categorize words into the three open class categories: nouns, verbs and adjectives,\n\u2022 identify whether a compound word has a head, and which part of the compound it is,\n\u2022 categorize function words into closed-class categories.\n163  7.1 Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives: Open Class Categories\nIn Linguistics, we observe how parts of language behave. When we find a set of words that all behave similarly,\nwe can group them into a category, specifically, into a syntactic category. You might have learned about some of\nthese categories as \u201cparts of speech\u201d. This unit gives an overview of the behaviour of the biggest categories.\nYou\u2019ve probably learned that nouns are words that describe a person, place or thing. But when we\u2019re studying\nmorphology and syntax, we categorize words according to their behaviour, not according to their meaning.There\nare two elements to a word\u2019s behaviour:\n\u2022 What inflectional morphemes does the word take?\n\u2022 What is the word\u2019s syntactic distribution? In other words, what position does it occupy in a sentence?\nWhat behaviour can we observe that allows us to categorize words as nouns? Looking at the inflectional\nmorphology, we observe that most nouns in English have a singular and a plural form:\nsingular plural\ntree trees\nbook books\nsong songs\nidea ideas\ngoal goals\nEnglish uses a plural morpheme on a noun to indicate that there is more than one of something. But there is\na subcategory of nouns that don\u2019t have plural forms. Mass nouns like rice, water, money, oxygen refer to things\nthat aren\u2019t really countable, so the nouns don\u2019t get pluralized. Nouns that refer to abstract things (such as justice,\nbeauty, happiness) behave like mass nouns too. If they don\u2019t have plural forms, why do we group them into the\nlarger category of nouns? It\u2019s because their syntactic distribution behaves like that of count nouns. Most English\nnouns, singular, plural, or mass, can appear in a phrase following the word the:\nthe tree, the trees\nthe book, the books\nthe song, the songs\nthe idea, the ideas\nthe goal, the goals\nthe rice\nthe money\nthe beauty (e.g., the beauty of the scenery)\nthe happiness (e.g., the happiness of the children)\n165 166 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nIn their syntactic distribution, pronouns (I, me, you, we, us, they, them, he, him, she, her, it) do the job that noun\nphrases do. A pronoun rarely appears with the, but it can replace an entire noun phrase:\nThe woman read the book.\n*The she read the book.\nShe read it.\nIn Essentials of Linguistics, we\u2019ll group pronouns into the larger category of nouns, remembering that they\u2019re a\nspecial case.\nVerbs behave differently to nouns. Morphologically, verbs have a past tense form and a progressive form. For a\nfew verbs, the past tense form is spelled or pronounced the same as the bare form.\nbare form past tense form progressive form\nsing sang singing\nthink thought thinking\nstay stayed staying\nbake baked baking\nremember remembered remembering\nread [\u0279id] read [\u0279\u025bd] reading\nset set setting\nAdjectives appear in a couple of predictable positions. One is between the word the and a noun:\nthe red car\nthe clever students\nthe unusual song\nthe delicious meal\nThe other is following any of the forms of the verb be:\nThat car is red.\nThe students are clever.\nThe song is unusual.\nThe meal was delicious.\nMany adjectives can be intensified with the words very or more:\nvery clever\nmore unusual\nvery delicious\nAnd some adjectives (but not all) have comparative and superlative forms:\nred \u2013 redder \u2013 reddest\nsmart \u2013 smarter \u2013 smartest\ntall \u2013 taller \u2013 tallest\ntasty \u2013 tastier \u2013 tastiest\nThe behaviour of adverbs is a little more difficult to observe. Unlike adjectives, adverbs don\u2019t have comparative\nor superlative forms, but like adjectives, they can be intensified with very or more:\nvery quickly\nvery cleverly\nmore importantly\nThe above examples illustrate that many adverbs are derived by affixing -ly to an adjective, but there are also 7.1 NOUNS, VERBS AND ADJECTIVES: OPEN CLASS CATEGORIES 167\nmany adverbs that are not derived this way, and there are also some common English words that have the -ly\naffix that aren\u2019t adverbs but adjectives, like friendly, lonely, lovely, so the affix is not a reliable clue. The syntactic\ndistribution of adverbs is also a little slippery. Adverbs can precede or follow verbs (or verb phrases; see Unit 8.5)\nto provide information about the verb:\nThe children sang beautifully.\nThe students complained loudly about the pop quiz.\nThey had just arrived when the fire alarm rang.\nSamira tripped and nearly broke her wrist.\nThe visitors will arrive tomorrow.\nAnd adverbs can precede adjectives or other adverbs to provide information about the adjective/adverb:\nThis meal is surprisingly tasty.\nAn extremely expensive car drove by.\nThe children finished their homework remarkably quickly.\nBecause their behaviour is more variable than that of words in the other open-class categories, adverbs can be\na challenge to identify. In the rest of this book, we\u2019ll label adverbs as \u201cA\u201d, the same label that we use for adjectives.\nThe three syntactic categories of nouns, verbs and adjectives, are called open-class categories. The categories\nare considered open because when new words get added to the language, they are almost always in one of these\nthree categories \u2014 the categories are open to new members. These categories are sometimes also called lexical\ncategories or content words because these categories are the ones that do most of the lexical semantic work\nin a sentence: they convey most of the meaning of a sentence. The semantic content of the words from other\ncategories (like the, of, in, that, etc.) is not as obvious as the semantics of the words from lexical categories. 7.2 Compound Words\nOne very productive way that new words are derived in English is by compounding, that is, combining two free morphemes\nto create a new word. Endocentric compounds have a head that determines the meaning and the category of the compound,\nand in English, the head is the second part of the compound.\n168 7.2 COMPOUND WORDS 169\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Affixation is quite productive, meaning\nthat our mental grammar uses the process for many different words, even for new words that come into the\nlanguage. You\u2019ve probably generated new words yourself sometimes by adding affixes to existing words.\nAnother extremely productive derivational process in English is compounding. Compounding is different from\naffixation. In affixation, a bound morpheme is affixed to a base. Compounding derives a new word by joining two\nmorphemes that would each usually be free morphemes.\nFor example, if I take the free morpheme green, an adjective, and combine it with the free morpheme house, a\nnoun, I get the new word greenhouse. We can tell that this is a new word because its meaning is different from\nwhat we would get if we just combined the two words to make a phrase. We could walk down the street describing\nhouses: This is a brown house and this one here is a tall house and here is a red house and here is a greenhouse.\nBut a greenhouse is something different from a house that\u2019s green! It\u2019s a new word, derived by compounding. 170 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nCredit: Joe Shlabotnik on Flickr; Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0) 7.2 COMPOUND WORDS 171\nImage \u201cGreenhouse at Wilson Farm, East Lexington MA\u201c by John Phelan is licensed under CC BY 3.0.\nAnother way that words derived by compounding differ from words derived by affixation is that a compound word\ndoesn\u2019t really have a base or root that determines the meaning of the word. Instead, both pieces of a compound\nmake a sizeable contribution to the meaning. For example, yoga pants are pants that you wear to do yoga, and\nemerald green is the particular colour of green that emeralds are. So it doesn\u2019t make sense to say that compounds\nhave a root.\nOn the other hand, there is one part of a compound that has a special role, which we can see if we think about\nthe categories of the words that make up a compound. If you look at these examples,\ndry clean\nstir fry\noutrun\npower wash\nEach compound is made up of a different category of the word on the left plus a verb on the right. But in each\ncase, the compound word is a verb. Even if both parts of a compound contribute to the meaning of the compound,\nit\u2019s the head of a compound that determines its category. We say that English is a head-final language because in\nEnglish the second part of the compound determines the category of the compound. Some languages are head-\ninitial, with the head as the first element in a compound.\nIn many compounds, the head determines the category and also constrains the meaning of the compound. So 172 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ndog food is a kind of food, not a kind of dog, and yoga pants are a kind of pants, not a variety of yoga. Compounds\nlike this, where the meaning relationship between the head and the whole compound is obvious, are called\nendocentric. But in some compounds, the meaning relationship is not so transparent. For example, a redhead is\na person, not a kind of head; a nest egg is money that you\u2019ve saved, not a kind of egg; a workout is not a particular\nkind of out, and facebook is not a book at all! Compounds where the meaning of the head does not predict the\nmeaning of the compound are said to be exocentric. 7.3 Closed Class Categories (Function Words)\nIn Unit 7.1 we saw that linguists group words into syntactic categories according to how they behave. Content\nwords convey a lot of the meaning of a sentence. But not many sentences would be complete if they contained\nonly nouns, verbs, or adjectives. There are also several smaller categories of words called closed-class categories\nbecause the language does not usually add new words to these categories. These categories don\u2019t have many\nmembers, maybe only a few dozen, in contrast with the many thousands of words in the open-class categories.\nThey\u2019re the function words or non-lexical categories that do a lot of grammatical work in a sentence but don\u2019t\nnecessarily have obvious semantic content.\nThe category of determiners doesn\u2019t have many members but its members occur very frequently in English.\nThe two little words the and a are the most recognizable members. Determiners most often appear before a noun,\nas in:\na student\nan orange\nthe snake\nthe ideas\nAny word that can appear in the same position as the counts as a determiner, like demonstratives:\nthose students\nthese oranges\nthat snake\nthis idea\nQuantifiers and numerals also behave like determiners:\nmany students\ntwelve oranges\nmost snakes\nseveral ideas\nAnd the words that you might have encountered as \u201cpossessive adjectives\u201d or \u201cpossessive pronouns\u201d behave\nlike determiners as well:\nmy sister\nyour idea\ntheir car\nThe category of prepositions seems to have slightly more obvious semantic content than most other closed\nclasses. Prepositions often represent relationships in space and time. They also have consistent syntactic\ndistribution, usually appearing with a noun phrase immediately following them:\non the table\nin the basket\naround the block\nthrough the centuries\nnear campus\n173 174 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nafter class\nA very small category of words that does an important job are the conjunctions. There are only three\nconjunctions, and, or, but. The job that conjunctions do is to conjoin two words or phrases that belong to the same\ncategory:\noranges and lemons\nbrushed her teeth and went to bed\nstrong and fast\nsoup or salad\nsinging or dancing\nhated her roommate but loved her roommate\u2019s sister\nsmall but mighty\nYou might have learned that words like because and although are a type of conjunction, but they don\u2019t behave\nlike and, or, but. Their behaviour is more similar to a category of words we label as complementizers.\nComplementizers are function words that introduce a clause, which is a sentence embedded inside a larger\nsentence:\nSam told us that she loved baseball.\nShe hoped that the Blue Jays would win the World Series.\nLeilani wondered whether it would rain that afternoon.\nShe asked her roommate if she had heard the forecast.\nThe roommate checked the forecast because she wanted to go for a run.\nShe decided to go running although a storm was forecast.\nMel washed the dishes while the cupcakes were in the oven. 7.4 Auxiliaries\nAuxiliaries are what you might have called \u201chelping verbs\u201d when you first learned about grammar: they help a\nlexical verb by providing grammatical information about a verb\u2019s tense or aspect, or other subtle elements of\nmeaning. There are nine modal auxiliaries, which never change their form because they are never inflected.\nKieran can sing really well.\nLaura could climb that rock wall.\nWe shall decide by drawing straws.\nYou should take a nap.\nThe guests will arrive soon.\nMalik would like to read that book.\nYou may leave after you\u2019ve finished the test.\nThe road might be slippery.\nDrivers must obey all traffic laws.\nThe verbs have, be, and do sometimes behave like auxiliaries and sometimes like ordinary lexical verbs. Unlike\nthe modal auxiliaries, have, be and do get inflected (had, has, having, am, is, are, was, were, been, being, did, done,\ndoing), so even when they are auxiliaries, they are non-modal. Their inflection is not a clue to whether they are\nauxiliaries or not, so we have to look at their behaviour in the context of a sentence.\nIf a sentence includes a lexical verb or main verb, then have, be or do in that sentence is likely to be an auxiliary,\nhelping the lexical verb. In the following examples, the auxiliary verbs are underlined and the lexical verbs (also\nknown as main verbs) are bolded:\nArlene is writing a novel.\nBeulah has arrived in Saskatoon.\nCarmen is planning her vacation.\nDoris did not buy any vegetables.\nEvlien has been thinking about switching programs.\nIn addition to their auxiliary functions, have, be and do also have some lexical meaning of their own. If there\u2019s\nno other verb in the clause, then have, be, or do is probably the main verb of a clause. In these examples the lexical\nverbs are bolded:\nFoster is proud of his sister.\nGreen vegetables are important for good health.\nHarold has an idea for an app.\nIra did his homework before supper.\nJavier had a big party.\nIf have, be or do serves as the lexical verb, then it might also have some auxiliaries helping out:\nFoster has been proud of his sister.\nGreen vegetables might be important for good health.\nHarold did have an idea for an app.\nIra could have been doing his homework before supper.\n175 176 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nJavier is having a big party.\nNotice that not every sentence has an auxiliary, but every sentence does have a lexical verb. 7.5 Neurolinguistics: Syntactic Category Differences in\nthe Brain\nIn linguistics, we group words into categories according to how they behave in their morphology and in sentences. This unit\nshows that different categories of words also lead to different responses in the brain.\n177 178 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=138\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe\u2019ve seen that we can group words into categories according to how they behave. We know that words within a\nparticular syntactic category behave similarly to the other words in that category. They\u2019re similar in their\ninflectional morphology, and in their syntactic distribution, that is, what positions they can occupy in a sentence.\nThat\u2019s some linguistic evidence that syntactic categories are real. There\u2019s also neurolinguistic evidence that our\nbrains respond differently to words from different categories.\nLorraine Tyler and her colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow to\ndifferent regions of the brain. The idea behind fMRI is that brain activity consumes oxygen, and when a particular\narea of the brain is active, then more blood flows there to bring it more oxygen. The researchers asked people to\ndo an easy task. They showed them lists of three words and asked them to decide if the third word, the one in all\ncaps, was related to the first two. So in this example, sparrows, thrushes, and wrens are all kinds of birds, so the\nparticipants would respond Yes. In this next example, hammer, wrench, banana, the first two are tools but the third\none is a fruit, so it\u2019s not related to the first two, so the participants would answer No.\nSome of the words in this task were nouns, like the lists we just saw, and some were verbs, like these ones:\neating, grazing, dining. All of those words are related to eating, so the participant would decide Yes. This is a pretty\nsimple task, but what the researchers found in the fMRI was that there were several areas of the brain that showed\ngreater blood flow for verbs than for nouns! Apparently, the brain was reacting differently to words from these\ntwo different syntactic categories, even though the task was the same for both categories.\nWe also see differences between nouns and verbs in the brains of people with aphasia. Aphasia is the name\nfor any kind of language disorder that results from an injury to the brain, such as a stroke or a tumour. There are\ndifferent kinds of aphasia that have different kinds of symptoms. Louise Zingeser and Rita Sloan Berndt found a\ndissociation between nouns and verbs in the speech of two different groups of people with aphasia. 7.5 NEUROLINGUISTICS: SYNTACTIC CATEGORY DIFFERENCES IN THE BRAIN 179\nThe researchers asked their participants to do a few simple tasks. One was a picture naming tasks, where the\nresearcher would show a line drawing and ask the participant to say what it was, like a fish or a car. In another\ntask, they asked participants to describe how they would go about a particular action, such as making a birthday\ncake or attending a concert. And in the last task, they gave participants a picture book that depicted a well-known\nfairy tale but didn\u2019t have any words in it and asked them to tell the story. So from all these tasks, they had a good\ncollection of each person\u2019s speech. For each person, they calculated the ratio of nouns to verbs.\nIt turns out that in people without any brain injury, the ratio of nouns to verbs is pretty close to one. That means\nthere are about the same number of nouns as there are verbs in the average person\u2019s speech for these tasks. But\nfor people with agrammatic aphasia, verbs are very difficult to produce. These people had more than twice as\nmany nouns as verbs. And for people with anomic aphasia, nouns are quite difficult. This group of people had\nfewer nouns than verbs.\nAphasia researchers call this kind of pattern a dissociation. We say that nouns are verbs are dissociated from\neach other because it\u2019s possible to have verb production impaired while noun production is ok, or vice versa. This\ndissociation is consistent with the idea that verbs and nouns are processed differently in the brain.\nSo what does all this mean? We\u2019ve seen that, in typical brains, a simple task with verbs involves greater brain\nactivity than the same task with nouns. And in people with brain injuries, some people have an impairment of\nverbs but not nouns, while others have an impairment of nouns but not verbs.\nAll this suggests that our brains treat words differently depending on what category they\u2019re in. Or in other words,\ndifferent syntactic categories exist not just in language, but also in the brain! Practice Time\nExercise 1. In the following paragraph, identify all the nouns, verbs, and adjectives:\n\u201cThe main door of the school is on the side away from the town. The drive leading to it is long, cutting straight\nacross between the tennis courts after it leaves the big wooden gates, then curving round the extreme edge of the\ngardens until, after a long, straight stretch up the slope, it ends in the courtyard by the front door. It takes about\nfive minutes\u2019 fast walking to get from the gates to the grateful seclusion of the court during which you become\nthoroughly self-conscious as you notice the eyes watching you from the windows. Once you reach the corner of\nthe house you are safe.\u201d\nExercise 2. In the following sentences, give the category of all the words from closed-class categories:\n\u201cAll the rooms on the ground floor open off the T-shaped front hall. When you come in from the courtyard the\ndoors of Mlle Tourain\u2019s study are directly opposite you; on your right are the kitchens and laundry-rooms and\nbetween them and the study, occupying the whole corner, is the dining-room. On your left, behind the big dark\nstaircase which curves up to the first floor, is the girls\u2019 living-room, and in front of it on the south-east corner, the\nmain classroom.\u201d\nExercise 3. In the following sentences, identify all the modal auxiliaries, non-modal auxiliaries, and the main\nverb uses of have and be:\n\u201cSome day they are going to get it mended but at present they are too busy, for Mlle Tourain is correcting proofs\nfor the second volume of her work on the history of Swiss independence, which will appear next autumn, and she,\nMary Ellerton, has no time for anything, since she dismissed the housekeeper and has her job as well as that of\nassistant principal.\u201d\nExercise 4. Compound words in English are variable in their spelling: some are spelled with no space between\nthe elements of the compound (redhead, greenhouse), some are spelled with a space (ice cream, ski boots), and\nsome are spelled with a hyphen between the elements (gluten-free, long-term). Identify all the compounds in the\nfollowing sentences:\n\u201cAm\u00e9lie Tourain leaned forward a little and switched on her desk light.\u201d\n\u201cThe third occasion on which she said something funny the headmistress had glanced at her over Doris\nAnderson\u2019s note-book, then at Mlle Devaux, and after that things went much easier with the grammar teacher.\u201d\n\u201cMlle Tourain was sitting back in her chair now, and had begun to tap the rubber end of her pencil against the\nbrass ink-pot.\u201d\n\u201cShe had spoken with an undercurrent of passion running through her words, as she was speaking now.\u201d\nAll of the texts for the exercises above are taken from Swiss Sonata by Gwethalyn Graham, which is in the Public\nDomain in Canada.\n180 Summary\nIn this chapter, you\u2019ve learned how to categorize words according to their behaviour, which categories are open to\nnew members, and which categories are not. You\u2019ve also learned that compounding is a very productive means of\nderiving new words in English by combining two words. While most compounds are endocentric and have a head\nthat determines the meaning and category of the word, for exocentric compounds, the meaning of the compound\ndrifts over time, leaving the compound without a head.\n181  CHAPTER 8: FORMING SENTENCES\nThis long chapter looks at how our mind combines words to generate sentences. The model of the mental\ngrammar that we propose is quite simple: Words and features are stored in the mental lexicon, and the operation\nMERGE combines these words and features into organized, but simple structures. In this chapter, we learn how to\nobserve the behaviour of sentences to draw conclusions about how these structures are organized in our minds,\nand how to use the notation called tree diagrams to illustrate that organization.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 use the evidence of constituency tests to identify the phrases within a sentence,\n\u2022 draw tree diagrams to represent declarative sentences in English,\n\u2022 draw tree diagrams to represent questions in English.\n183  8.1 Tree Diagrams\nThis unit introduces the basic vocabulary for tree diagrams.

Before we do that, we need\nto be familiar with a particular kind of notation called a tree diagram. We\u2019ll see that, within each sentence, words\nare grouped into phrases. Phrases can be grouped together to form other phrases, and to form sentences. We\nuse tree diagrams to depict this organization. They\u2019re called tree diagrams because they have lots of branches:\neach of these little lines that join things in the diagram is a branch. Within a tree diagram, we can talk about the\nrelationships between different parts of the tree.\nEvery place where branches join together is called a node. Each node corresponds to a set of words that act\ntogether as a unit called a constituent, which we\u2019ll talk about later in this chapter.\nEach branch connects one node to another. The higher node is called the parent and the lower one is the child.\nA parent can have more than one child, but each child has only one parent. And, as you might expect, if two child\nnodes have the same parent, then we say that they\u2019re siblings to each other. (Just so you know, most linguistics\ntextbooks call these nodes \u201cmother, daughter and sister\u201d nodes, but we\u2019re using non-gendered terms in this book.)\nIf a node has no children, we call it a terminal node.\nHaving this vocabulary for tree diagrams will allow us to talk about the syntactic relationships between the parts\nof sentences in our mental grammar. 8.2 X-bar Phrase Structure\nX-bar theory makes the simple proposal that every phrase in every sentence in every language is organized the same way.\nEvery phrase has a head, and each phrase might contain other phrases in the complement or specifier position.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=150\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe\u2019re starting to look at how our minds organize sentences. We\u2019ll see that within each sentence, our mental\ngrammar groups words together into phrases and phrases into sentences. We saw in the last unit how we can use\ntree diagrams to show these relationships between words, phrases and sentences.\nThe theory of syntax that we\u2019re working within this class is called X-bar theory. X-bar theory makes the claim\nthat every single phrase in every single sentence in the mental grammar of every single human language, has\nthe same core organization. Here\u2019s a tree diagram that shows us that basic organization. Let\u2019s look at it more\nclosely. According to x-bar theory, every phrase has a head. The head is the terminal node of the phrase. It\u2019s\nthe node that has no daughters. Whatever category the head is determines the category of the phrase. So if the\nhead is a Noun, then our phrase is a Noun Phrase, abbreviated NP. If the head is a verb (V) then the phrase is a\nverb phrase (VP). And likewise, if the head is a preposition (P), then the phrase is a preposition phrase (PP), and\nAdjective Phrases (AP) have Adjectives as their heads.\nSo the bottom-most level of this structure is called the head level, and the top level is called the phrase level.\nWhat about the middle level of the structure? Syntacticians love to give funny names to parts of the mental\ngrammar, and this middle level of a phrase structure is called the bar level; that\u2019s where the theory gets its name:\nX-bar theory.\nSo if every phrase in every sentence in every language has this structure, then it must be the case that\nevery phrase has a head. But you\u2019ll notice in this diagram that these other two pieces, the specifier and the\ncomplement, which we haven\u2019t talked about yet, are in parentheses. That\u2019s to show that they\u2019re optional \u2014 they\nmight not necessarily be in every phrase. If they\u2019re optional, that means that it should be possible to have a phrase\nthat consists of just a single head \u2014 and if we observe some grammaticality judgments, we can think of phrases\nand even whole sentences that seem to contain a head and nothing else. We could have a noun phrase that\nconsists of a single noun \u2014 Coffee? or Spiderman! We could have verb phrase that has nothing in it but a verb, like\nStop! or Run! Or an adjective phrase might consist of only a single adjective, like Nice\u2026 or Excellent!\nBut X-bar theory proposes that phrases can have more in them than just ahead. A phrase might optionally have\nanother phrase inside it in a position that is sister to the head and daughter to the bar level. If there\u2019s a phrase in\nthat position, it\u2019s called the complement. The most common kinds of head-complement relationship we see are a\nverb taking an object or a preposition taking an object. Let\u2019s look at some examples. Here we\u2019ve got a verb phrase,\nwith the verb drank as its head. That head has the noun phrase coffee as its sister. The NP coffee is sister to the\nverb head and daughter of the V-bar node so it is a complement of the verb.\nHere\u2019s another example that has the same structure, but a different category. The head of this phrase is the 8.2 X-BAR PHRASE STRUCTURE 189\npreposition near, so the phrase is a preposition phrase. The complement of the preposition is the noun phrase\ncampus and the whole phrase is near campus. Try to think of some other examples of verbs and prepositions that\ntake noun phrases as their complements.\nThe other common place we see a head-complement relationship is between a determiner and a noun. In\nphrases like my sister, those shoes, and the weather, the determiner is a head that takes an NP complement.\nX-bar theory also proposes that phrase can have a specifier. A specifier is a phrase that is sister to the bar-level\nand daughter to the phrase level. The most common job for specifiers is as the subjects of sentences, so we\u2019ll look\nat those in another unit. 8.3 Constituents\nWe\u2019ve started to use tree diagrams to represent how phrases are organized in our mental grammar. And we\u2019re\nusing the tree diagram notation to represent every single phrase as having X-bar structure. But so far I\u2019ve just\nasked you to believe me about X-bar structure: I\u2019ve told you that this is what the theory claims, but we haven\u2019t\nyet talked about any evidence that our mental grammar really is organized into phrases that have X-bar structure.\nThis unit shows some of the linguistic evidence that phrases have some reality in the mental grammar.\nWhen we draw a tree diagram, we\u2019re making a claim about how a sentence or phrase is organized in our mind.\nEvery time we draw two or more branches coming together at a node, we\u2019re making the claim that the node\ncorresponds to a unit. In other words, all the daughters of that node behave together as a unit. Some of these\nnodes are at the phrase level, and some of them are at the bar-level. The more generic term for a group of words\nthat act together to form a unit is a constituent.\nSo what\u2019s our evidence that constituents exist in our minds? Within a given sentence, how can we tell if a given\nstring of words acts as a unit? Here again is where we rely on observing our grammaticality judgments, using a few\nsimple tools.\nREPLACEMENT TEST\nHere\u2019s a simple sentence:\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nLet\u2019s consider the string of words their friends. Because you\u2019ve already started to practice drawing trees, you\nprobably have an instinct that this is a noun phrase. But if you\u2019re going to claim that it\u2019s a constituent, it would be\nnice to have some evidence for that claim. One piece of evidence is that we can replace this set of words. Take the\npronoun them and replace the string of words we\u2019re investigating:\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nThe students saw them after class.\nThen we ask ourselves whether the resulting sentence is grammatical. Replacing their friends with them does\nindeed leave us with a grammatical sentence, which is one piece of evidence that their friends is a constituent.\nLet\u2019s test another chunk of this sentence. Let\u2019s try the string of words after class. If we replace that set of words\nwith the word then:\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nThe students saw their friends then.\nAnd when we observe our grammaticality judgment, it turns out that this replacement is also grammatical.\nThat\u2019s some evidence that words after class behave together as a constituent in this sentence.\nWe can do the same thing with the string the students. Replace that string with the pronoun they:\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nThey saw their friends after class.\nAnd observe our grammaticality judgment, and we find evidence that the students is a constituent as well.\nWhat happens if we try to replace a string of words that isn\u2019t a constituent?\n190 8.3 CONSTITUENTS 191\nThe students saw their friends after class.\n*The they friends after class.\n*The did friends after class.\n*The then friends after class.\n*The them friends after class.\nWe can try lots of replacements, but when we ask ourselves whether the result is grammatical, the answer is No.\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything that can replace the string of words students saw their. The fact that nothing\ncan replace that string of words suggests that students saw their is not a constituent in this sentence.\nAt this point, you\u2019re probably wondering how you know what you can use as a replacement. Here are some\nhandy tips:\n\u2022 Noun Phrases can be replaced with Pronouns (it, them, they).\n\u2022 Verb Phrases can be replaced with do or do so (or did, does, doing).\n\u2022 Some Preposition Phrases (but not all) can be replaced with then or there.\n\u2022 Adjective Phrases can be replaced with something that you know to be an adjective, such as happy.\nLet\u2019s see how this replacement tool works for a verb phrase. We\u2019ll go back to our sentence and look for the verb,\nsaw. Let\u2019s test this set of words: saw their friends. Since saw is the past tense of see, we\u2019ll try replacing it with did, the\npast tense of do, and observe our grammaticality judgment.\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nThe students did after class.\nThis replacement is grammatical, so that provides us with some evidence that the set of words saw their friends is\nindeed a constituent.\nYou can use this evidence as you\u2019re drawing trees. If you can\u2019t quite figure out which groups of words go\ntogether into certain phrases, you can try replacing different chunks of the sentence. The parts that allow\nthemselves to be replaced, that is, the parts that can be replaced and still leave a grammatical sentence are\nconstituents, and those parts will be joined under one node.\nYou can also use this evidence when you\u2019re trying to figure out what category a certain phrase is: If you can\nreplace it with a pronoun, then you\u2019ve got a noun phrase and you can look for the noun as the head. If you can\nreplace it with do or do so, then you\u2019ve got a verb phrase which will have a verb as its head. Then and there are\na little less reliable because they sometimes replace PPs or APs, but you\u2019ll be able to tell the difference between\nprepositions and adjectives because prepositions usually have complements and adjectives don\u2019t.\nMOVEMENT TEST\nReplacement is not the only tool we have for checking if a set of words is a constituent. Some constituents can be\nmoved to somewhere else in the sentence without changing its meaning or its grammaticality. Preposition Phrases\nare especially good at being moved. Look at this sentence:\nNimra bought a top from that strange little shop.\nLet\u2019s start by targeting the last string of words by moving it to the beginning. Move the string of words then ask\nyourself whether the resulting sentence is grammatical.\nNimra bought a top from that strange little shop.\nFrom that strange little shop Nimra bought a top.\nYes, it is. Standing here in isolation, the sentence might sound a little unnatural, but we can imagine a context\nwhere it would be fine, such as, \u201cAt the department store, she bought socks, at the pharmacy she bought some 192 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ntoothpaste, and at that strange little shop, she bought a top.\u201d On the other hand, if we target a smaller string of\nwords:\nNimra bought a top from that strange little shop.\n*From that strange, Nimra bought a top little shop.\nIf we try to move that string to the beginning of the sentence, the result is a total disaster. The fact that the\nresulting sentence is totally ungrammatical gives us evidence that the string of words from that strange is not a\nconstituent in this sentence.\nCLEFT TEST\nThere\u2019s a version of the movement tool that can be useful for other kinds of phrases. It\u2019s called Clefting. A cleft is\na kind of sentence that has the form:\nIt was ____ that \u2026\nTo use the cleft test, we take the string of words that we\u2019re investigating and put it after the words It was, then\nleave the remaining parts of the sentence to follow the word that. Let\u2019s try it for the phrases we\u2019ve already shown\nto be constituents.\nNimra bought a top from that strange little shop.\nIt was from that strange little shop that Nimra bought a top.\nThe students saw their friends after class.\nIt was their friends that the students saw after class.\nIt was after class that the students saw their friends.\nAnd let\u2019s try the cleft test on another new sentence.\nRhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious cookies.\nIt was these delicious cookies that Rhea\u2019s sister baked.\nIt was Rhea\u2019s sister that baked these delicious cookies.\nThe cleft test shows us that the string of words these delicious cookies are a constituent, and that the words Rhea\u2019s\nsister are a constituent. But look what happens if we apply the cleft test to another string of words:\nRhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious cookies.\n*It was sister baked that Rhea\u2019s these delicious cookies.\nRhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious cookies.\n*It was these delicious that Rhea\u2019s sister baked cookies.\nRhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious cookies.\n*It was cookies that Rhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious.\nAll of these applications of the cleft test result in totally ungrammatical sentences, which gives us evidence that\nthose underlined strings of words are not constituents in this sentence.\nANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\nIf a string of words is a constituent, it\u2019s usually grammatical for it to stand alone as the answer to a question based\non the sentence.\nRhea\u2019s sister baked these delicious cookies.\nWhat did Rhea\u2019s sister bake? These delicious cookies.\nWho baked these delicious cookies? Rhea\u2019s sister.\nThe answer-to-questions test can also help us identify a verb phrase using do-replacement:\nWho baked these delicious cookies? Rhea\u2019s sister did.\nNotice that in the answer, \u201cRhea\u2019s sister did\u201d, the word did automatically replaces the verb phrase baked these\ndelicious cookies. 8.3 CONSTITUENTS 193\nAgain, if a string of words is not a constituent, then it is unlikely to be grammatical as the answer to a question.\nIn fact, it\u2019s difficult to even form the right kind of question:\nWhat did Rhea\u2019s sister bake cookies? *these delicious\nWho of Rhea\u2019s these delicious cookies? *sister baked\nRemember that tree diagrams are a notation that linguists use to depict how phrases and sentences are\norganized in our mental grammar. We can\u2019t observe mental grammar, so observing how words behave is how we\nmake inferences about the mental grammar. These four tests are tools that we have for observing how words\nbehave in sentences. If we discover a string of words that passes these tests, then we know that the phrase is a\nconstituent, and therefore there should be one node that is the mother to that entire string of words in our tree\ndiagram.\nNot every constituent will pass every test, but if you\u2019ve found that it passes two of the four tests, then you can\nbe confident that the string is actually a constituent. When you\u2019re drawing trees, use these tests as a check every\ntime you draw a mother node. 8.4 Sentences are Phrases\nIf every phrase in every language is organized into an X-bar structure, then sentences must also have X-bar structure. This\nunit shows that every sentence has a Tense node (T) and every sentence is a TP.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Our idea is that we draw words,\nmorphemes, and morphosyntactic features from the mental lexicon, and then the operation MERGE organizes all\nthese things and into an x-bar structure. And the theory makes the quite powerful claim that every phrase in every\nsentence is organized in an x-bar structure, with a head, a bar-level and a phrase level.\nSo it\u2019s fairly easy to understand that verb phrases have verb heads, and preposition phrases have preposition\nheads. But what kind of phrases are sentences? If we look carefully, we can observe that every sentence includes\none and only one tense feature, which occupies a head position that we label as T, for Tense. And of course, where\nthere is a head there are also the bar level and the phrase level. So a sentence is a T-phrase.\nLet\u2019s see how this works in a fairly simple sentence. \u201cAlex should try yoga.\u201d We already know how to depict verb\nphrases. The verb try is a transitive verb, and the NP yoga is its complement. The modal auxiliary should occupies\nthe T head position. A T head always takes a VP as its complement. So every sentence that we see from here on\nwill have a T head with a VP complement.\nWhenever there\u2019s a head, there\u2019s also a bar-level and a phrase level. And the last phrase we have left in the\nsentence is the noun phrase Alex. It\u2019s the subject of the sentence. We said that specifiers are kind of special, and\nthe subject is the most special of all. The Specifier of TP is the position for the phrase, usually a noun phrase, that\u2019s\nthe subject of the sentence. Subjects go in SpecTP.\nTo sum that all up, every sentence is a T-phrase. The T-head of the T-phrase takes a VP as its complement. And\nthe specifier of TP is a noun phrase, and the name for the noun phrase that occupies that position is the subject\nof the sentence.\nWhat kinds of things can occupy the T-head position? The example that we just saw had a modal auxiliary in the\nT-head position. But not all sentences have modals in them. If the sentence does not have a modal auxiliary, then\nthe T-head position will be occupied by a morphosyntactic tense feature. And when we\u2019re looking at English, there\nare only two tense features, [-past] and [+past].\nLet\u2019s see how this works in another simple sentence, very similar to the last one: Alex loves yoga. Remember that\nthe theory claims that when we draw a verb in its tensed form from the mental lexicon, we also bring along the\ntense feature as well. Loves is in the present tense, so it has the [-past] feature.\nThe structure of this sentence is the same as the previous one we looked at. The only difference is that, instead\nof a modal auxiliary in the T position, we have that morphosyntactic tense feature. We put this feature in brackets\nto indicate that it\u2019s present in our mental grammar but it doesn\u2019t actually get pronounced when we say the\nsentence out loud. You could think of it as present in the underlying form, but not in the surface form. The job of 196 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nthis feature in the T-head position is to make sure that its complement has the correct form. Since this feature is\n[-past], it wants to make sure that the verb in its VP complement is in the [-past] (that is, the present-tense) form.\nIf there were some non-tensed form of the verb there, like Alex loving yoga or Alex love yoga, the sentence would\nbe ungrammatical. 8.5 English Verb Forms\nEvery English verb has five different forms, but only two of the forms have a tense feature. The tensed forms are\nindicated with a morphosyntactic feature, either [+past] or [-past]. The form that a verb in the V-head position\ntakes depends on what tense feature is in the T-head position, among other things.\nbare (non-tensed) eat walk sing take\n[-past] (tensed) eats walks sings takes\n[+past] (tensed) ate walked sang took\npast participle (non-tensed) eaten walked sung taken\npresent participle (non-tensed) eating walking singing taking\nBut there are some quirks of English that can make things confusing:\nIS IT BARE OR [-PAST]?\nFor just about every verb, the [-past] form is recognizable in the 3rd-person-singular form (she eats/walks/sings/\ntakes). The 1st & 2nd-person forms (I eat/walk/sing/take and You eat/walk/sing/take) look just like the bare form (eat/\nwalk/sing/take).\nIf you\u2019re looking at a verb and can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in the bare form or the [-past] form, give it a 3rd-person subject and\nthen look for the \u2013s morpheme:\nI want to visit Saskatoon. (bare or [-past]? Can\u2019t tell: they\u2019re ambiguous)\nShe wants to visit Saskatoon. (wants is [-past], visit is bare)\nIS IT [+PAST] OR PAST PARTICIPLE?\nFor many English verbs, the [+past] form (She bought a donut) and the past participle form (She has bought a donut)\nare the same.\nIf you\u2019re looking at a verb and can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in the [+past] form or the past participle form, try replacing it with\nthe verb eat:\nShe bought a donut after she had walked the dog. ( [+past] or past participle? Can\u2019t tell: they\u2019re\nambiguous)\nShe ate a donut after she had eaten the dog. (Silly, but grammatical)\nThe form ate is [+past], while eaten is past participle, so we can conclude that, in that sentence, bought is [+past]\nwhile walked is the past participle)\n197 198 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nWHAT ABOUT AUXILIARIES?\nThe modal auxiliaries never change their form: they occupy the T-head position in their own right.\nThe non-modal auxiliaries, like main verbs, change their form depending on what tense feature is in the T-head\nposition, among other things.\nbare (non-tensed) be have do\n[-past] (tensed) am/are/is has does\n[+past] (tensed) was/were had did\npast participle (non-tensed) been had done\npresent participle (non-tensed) being having doing 8.6 Subcategories\nWe saw in Chapter 7 that we can group words into categories according to their behaviour. In this unit, we see that we can\ndivide up the category of Verbs into subcategories according to what kind of complement a verb takes.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If we change the verb bake to the verb eat, our sentence is still\ngrammatical, Jamie might eat cupcakes. And that makes sense of what we know about how categories work \u2014 we\ngroup verbs together into the verb category because they behave the same way.\nBut what about these sentences?\nJamie might arrive cupcakes.\nJamie might hope cupcakes.\nAre these grammatical? My mental grammar doesn\u2019t generate these, and I bet yours doesn\u2019t either. And their\nungrammaticality isn\u2019t just a matter of them not making semantic sense, either. Since the verb arrive often has\nsomething to do with a location, we could try changing cupcakes to Toronto, but the sentence is still ungrammatical:\nthe grammar of English does not generate the sentence, Jamie might arrive Toronto. But why aren\u2019t these sentences\ngrammatical? There\u2019s no doubt that arrive and hope are verbs, and they seem to fit into the same x-bar structure\nthat was grammatical for lots of other sentences. Why doesn\u2019t our mental grammar generate the sentence Jamie\nmight hope cupcakes?\nIt\u2019s something to do with the verbs themselves. Some heads are picky about the kinds of complements they\u2019re\nwilling to take. And this is especially true for verbs. Within the large category of verbs, we can group verbs further\ninto subcategories according to the kinds of complements they take. For each head, the mental lexicon stores not\njust syntactic category information, but also subcategory information. The subcategory information tells us what\nkinds of complements each head will accept. So let\u2019s look at a few verb subcategories.\nTransitive Verbs have one complement, a noun phrase, so they have this basic structure. The verb baked is\ntransitive when it has an NP or DP complement like cupcakes. Here are some other transitive structures: drank\ncoffee, likes Linguistics, needs money, speaks Mandarin.\nWhen there is a noun phrase in the complement of a verb, we call it the direct object. And the direct object NP\nor DP doesn\u2019t have to be a single word. It could be a fairly complex phrase itself. As long as it\u2019s a noun phrase and\nit\u2019s the complement of a verb head, we call it the direct object, and the verb is a transitive verb.\nIntransitive verbs have no complement at all. These are verbs that describe an action or state that involves just\na single participant, like sneezed or arrived or dances or slept.\nThere\u2019s a small set of verbs that are called ditransitives. They\u2019re a little special because they have two\ncomplements, but for them to count as ditransitives, they have a special kind of behaviour, called the dative\nalternation. The best example of a ditransitive verb is the verb give. Take a look at this structure and notice that 8.6 SUBCATEGORIES 201\nthe V-head gave has two sisters \u2014 two complements \u2014 the NP cupcakes and the PP to Sarah. But this verb give has\nanother possible grammatical structure that means exactly the same thing. In this alternate structure, the verb\nhas two NP complements. The NP Sarah, which was the complement to the preposition in the other structure, is\nnow the first complement, and cupcakes has become the second complement.\nThe fact that our mental grammar generates both these structures for this verb and its complements is called\nan alternation. There are other alternations in our mental lexicon, but this particular one is called the dative\nalternation, which comes from the Latin word for give. Most of the verbs that allow the dative alternation are verbs\nthat have a meaning that\u2019s related to giving. Send is another example:\nShe sent a letter to her grandmother. // She sent her grandmother a letter.\nOr to hand someone something:\nShe handed a coffee to her friend. // She handed her friend a coffee.\nThe last subcategory of verbs to talk about is another small one, but it\u2019s an interesting subcategory. Some verbs\ntake complements that are entire sentences. Each of these verbs, hope, doubt, wonder, ask, has a complement that\ncould stand alone as a sentence:\nAnn hopes that the Leafs will win.\nBev doubts that the Leafs can win.\nCarla wondered if she should cancel her season\u2019s tickets.\nDivya asked whether Eva liked hockey.\nEach of these sentences, or clauses, is embedded inside the larger sentence. And each one is introduced by a\nword from the category of complementizers. The words that, if, and whether are called complementizers because\nthey introduce complement clauses. Let\u2019s look at the structure of one of these sentences.\nFirst, the embedded clause, which could stand as a sentence in its own right \u2014 it has a tense feature in the T-\nhead position. The complement to the T-head is, as always, a VP. In this clause, the verb is intransitive so it has\nno complements, and the entire phrase is made up of the word win. This clause has a subject, a DP in the SpecTP\nposition, the Leafs.\nSo this whole TP could be a sentence in its own right, but we know that in this case, it\u2019s embedded inside a\nlarger sentence \u2014 it\u2019s the complement to the verb hopes. And often when a clause is in complement position,\nit gets introduced by a complementizer, which is a head of its own that we label as C. Notice that because the\ncomplementizer that is a C-head, there is also a C-bar and CP level as well.\nNow from here on it\u2019s quite simple. This whole CP is simply the complement of the verb hopes, so it\u2019s sister to the\nV-head and they\u2019re both daughters of V-bar. And then this matrix clause has its own T-head, T-bar and TP levels,\nand the subject NP in SpecTP is Ann.\nOK, let\u2019s recap. We\u2019ve seen now that in addition to category information, the mental lexicon includes\nsubcategory information for some heads. Verbs belonging to different subcategories are choosy about the form\ntheir complement takes. This means that it would be possible for a given sentence to be ungrammatical even if it\nhas an x-bar structure if the complement is the wrong kind for that subcategory of head. And we\u2019ve looked at four\ndifferent verb subcategories:\n\u2022 transitive verbs have one NP or DP as their complement\n\u2022 intransitive verbs have no complements\n\u2022 ditransitive verbs have two complements that can alternate position in the dative alternation\n\u2022 and there is a set of verbs that take clauses as their complements 8.7 Grammatical Roles\nWe use grammatical role labels to identify the syntactic position of Noun Phrases or Determiner Phrases within\neach clause. It\u2019s vital to remember that grammatical role labels are defined strictly according to syntactic positions,\nnot according to the meaning of a noun phrase or its semantic relationship to the verb. We\u2019ll come back to this\nidea in the next chapter.\nThe subject is the NP or DP that appears in the Specifier of TP. The underlined phrases in the following\nsentences are all subjects of their respective clauses.\nZora kicked the soccer ball.\nYasmin guessed that Xavier would probably be late.\nThat tall woman nearly knocked me over.\nThe view from the top floor is quite impressive.\nUnderstanding Calculus takes a lot of work.\nThe town where I was born recently elected a new mayor.\nThe direct object is an NP or DP that is the complement to a Verb head. Each of the following underlined\nphrases is a direct object.\nZora kicked the soccer ball.\nXavier\u2019s lateness annoyed Yasmin.\nWilliam convinced Veronica that class was cancelled.\nUrsula asked the fellow who works at Tim Horton\u2019s what time the store closed.\nStefanie bought a gift certificate for $100 for her mother.\nIf we refer to an NP or DP simply as the object, by default we mean the direct object, not the indirect object (see\nbelow).\nIf a Verb head takes a complement that is some category other than an NP or DP, then that complement phrase\ndoes not count as a direct object. The phrases following the verbs in these sentences are NOT direct objects, even\nthough they are complements to V-head, because they are not NPs/DPs.\nYasmin guessed Xavier would be late.\nRana seemed unhappy.\nThe parcel was on the porch.\nWe can identify two additional grammatical roles for NPs/DPs, according to the syntactic positions they occupy.\nAn indirect object only appears with a ditransitive verb. It is the NP or DP that alternates between being the\ncomplement of a P-head and the complement of a V-head, for a verb that allows the dative alternation. The\nunderlined phrases below are all indirect objects:\nStefanie bought a gift certificate for her mother.\nStefanie bought her mother a gift certificate.\nQuinn texted directions to the party to her friends.\nQuinn texted her friends directions to the party.\nPreeti sent a bouquet of flowers to her aunt.\nPreeti sent her aunt a bouquet of flowers.\n202 8.7 GRAMMATICAL ROLES 203\nIf a verb does not allow the dative alternation, then it does not have an indirect object.\nIf an NP or DP appears as the complement to a preposition, but does not an alternate position to become the\ncomplement of a verb in the dative alternation, then it is not an indirect object, but an oblique. Oblique is the\ncatch-all label for all other positions that NPs or DPs can occupy in a sentence. The underlined phrases below are\nall obliques:\nOscar bought a bicycle from that store on Locke Street.\nNorma left her business card on the table.\nMassimo watched a documentary about antibiotics.\nThese four labels: subject, direct object, indirect object, and oblique, describe Noun Phrases or Determiner\nPhrases only in terms of what position they occupy in a clause. Look at the following two sentences:\nA famous food critic reviewed this restaurant.\nThis restaurant was reviewed by a famous food critic.\nEven though the person who does the reviewing is the same person (the famous food critic) in both sentences,\nthe DP a famous food critic is not the subject of both sentences, only of the first. The subject of the second sentence\nis the DP this restaurant. Grammatical role labels describe the syntactic position of noun phrases. 8.8 Adjuncts\nWe know that each phrase contains a head, and might contain other phrases in the complement or specifier position.\nThis unit introduces a new position in the phrase, the adjunct position. The adjunct position often contains phrases that\ncommunicate optional information, like where, when or why an event happens.\n204 8.8 ADJUNCTS 205\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

An x-bar structure has a head, a bar-level and a phrase level. It might,\noptionally, have a complement phrase as the sister to the head and daughter to the bar-level. It might, optionally,\nhave a specifier as sister to the bar level and daughter to the phrase level.\nBut as you\u2019ve been drawing trees and thinking about how sentences are organized in your mental grammar,\nyou might have encountered some kinds of sentences that don\u2019t seem to fit into an x-bar structure. The X-bar\nstructures that we\u2019ve looked at so far have left out one element. The additional level of structure that we need is\ncalled an adjunct, and here\u2019s what it looks like. What structural relationships do you notice? The adjunct is sister\nto the bar-level, but here\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen before: it\u2019s also daughter to a bar-level. This is an instance\nof recursion. A recursive structure is a structure that contains another structure inside it that has the same type\nas itself. Some linguists argue that recursion is a fundamental property of all human languages and that it\u2019s one of\nthe things that makes human languages different from all other species\u2019 communication systems. Try to think of\nsome other examples of recursive structures that we\u2019ve already seen.\nSo if adjunction is recursive, you\u2019ve probably already figured out that it can happen over and over again within\na single phrase. Every time we add an adjunct as sister to the bar level, we add another bar-level as its mother,\nto which we could add another adjunct as its sister, which adds another bar level as its mother, and so on. So\nan x-bar phrase can have 0 or 1 complements, and it can have either 0 or 1 specifies, but because adjuncts are\nrecursive, it could theoretically have an infinite number of adjuncts.\nWe\u2019ve got a pretty clear idea of what complements do: they complete the meaning of a head. And the specifier\nposition is a special position for subjects. So why do we need adjuncts? Well, like complements and specifiers, 206 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nadjuncts are optional: a phrase might have one or more, or it might have no adjuncts. Adjuncts often add extra\ninformation that\u2019s not totally necessary for the meaning of the sentence, the kind of information that\u2019s often\ncontained in APs or PPs, like where an event happened or how it happened. Because adjuncts are optional, they\ncan often be moved or even removed altogether without changing the grammaticality of the sentence. And many\nadjuncts can appear on either side of their x-bar sister, whereas in English, complements pretty much always come\nafter their sisters and specifiers come before. Let\u2019s look at some examples of adjunct phrases.\nIn this sentence, Sam bought shoes yesterday, the phrase yesterday is giving us extra information about when the\nbuying happened, so it\u2019s adjoined within the verb phrase headed by bought.\nIn this next one, Sam bought new shoes yesterday, the adjective new is giving us extra information about the\nnoun, shoes, so it\u2019s adjoined within the noun phrase that has shoes as its head. Notice that this AP is still in adjunct\nposition: it\u2019s sister to N\u2019 and daughter to N\u2019, but it happens to come before its sister instead of after.\nAnd look at all the adjuncts in this one: Ted snored loudly for several hours at night. We know that the verb snore\nis an intransitive verb: it doesn\u2019t take anything as its complement, so the head has no sister. But then there are\nthree separate adjunct phrases, each of which gives us extra information about the snoring: the AP loudly is sister\nto V\u2019 and daughter to another V\u2019 node.The PP for several hours is sister to V\u2019 and daughter of another V\u2019 node. And\nthe PP at night is sister to V\u2019 and daughter to another V\u2019 node. I\u2019ve drawn these phrases with triangles; that\u2019s just a\nshorthand that indicates that we\u2019re not depicting the full inner structure of these phrases.\nOne piece of evidence that these phrases are adjuncts and not specifiers is that we can rearrange them in the\nsentence without changing the meaning or the grammaticality of the sentence.\nTed snored loudly for several hours at night.\nTed loudly snored at night for several hours\nTed snored for several hours at night, loudly.\nIf any of these phrases were complements, we wouldn\u2019t be able to move them around, because a complement\nis always sister to the head, so it has to be right beside the head. But because adjunction is recursive, an adjunct\nalways introduces another bar-level that can accommodate another adjunct.\nSo from now on, when you\u2019re drawing trees, you don\u2019t just have to decide whether each phrase goes in a\ncomplement or specifier position, but you also have to consider whether it might be an adjunct. 8.9 Move\nThe operation MERGE takes words, morphemes and features from the mental lexicon and combines them into grammatical\nx-bar structures. But in some sentences, a further operation is required to make the sentence pronounceable. This unit shows\nthat a head that is generated in one position by MERGE can be moved to an adjacent head position by the operation MOVE.\n207 208 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Which tree diagram correctly represents the question, \u201cWill the Habs win the Stanley Cup?\u201d 210 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nAnswers\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe\u2019ve developed a model of the mental grammar that says that we draw words, morphemes, and\nmorphosyntactic features from our mental lexicon, and then the operation MERGE combines all these items into\na grammatical x-bar structure. In this unit, we\u2019re going to look at another operation of the mental grammar, called\nMOVE, which takes a part of a sentence and moves it somewhere else in the sentence. But why would we want to\ndo that? Let\u2019s look at some examples to figure it out.\nLet\u2019s take our now-familiar sentence, Ann hopes that the Leafs will win. Hope is one of those verbs that takes a\nwhole clause as its complement, and that clause is introduced by the complementizer that in C-head position. But\nwhat if Ann isn\u2019t hoping, what if she\u2019s asking whether there\u2019s any possibility of her hopes being realized? If\nshe\u2019s asking instead of hoping, the complementizer that doesn\u2019t work as well here. It\u2019s grammatical if we use\nthe complementizer if. I\u2019m going to suggest that the reason the complementizer that doesn\u2019t fit very well in this\nposition is because the verb head ask doesn\u2019t just subcategorize for a complement clause \u2014 it\u2019s even pickier than\nthat! The verb ask subcategorizes for a question clause. And the difference between a regular complement clause\nand a question clause is that a question clause has a [+Q] feature in the C-head position.\nSo we\u2019re seeing another instance of a morphosyntactic feature occupying a head position. The strange thing\nabout features is that they don\u2019t get pronounced. We know that morphemes and words link up a form (either\nspoken or written) with a meaning. But features have meaning and don\u2019t have any form of their own. The tense\nfeature does its job by making sure that its complement has the right form. And one way that the [+Q] feature\ndoes its job is by making sure that the thing in the C-head has the right form. So if is ok when the C-head has a\n[+Q] feature in it, but that is not so good.\nThere\u2019s another way that the [+Q] feature can make itself noticed, though. In English, if we want to ask a\nquestion, we don\u2019t do it like this: If the Leafs will win? How do we form that question when it\u2019s not embedded inside\nanother clause? Of course, it\u2019s Will the Leafs win? How did that modal will get from its position between the subject\nand the main verb up to the beginning of the sentence? Here\u2019s where the operation MOVE comes in.\nThe theory claims that the operation MERGE generates this structure for the question. This looks just like the\ndeclarative sentence, The Leafs will win, except that it has a [+Q] feature in the C-head position. That [+Q] feature\nneeds people to know that it\u2019s there; it\u2019s not like the null complementizer that doesn\u2019t mind being silent: it changes\nthe meaning of the sentence so it wants to be pronounced. For questions that are main clauses themselves, it\u2019s not\ngrammatical in English to just stick a question complementizer into the C-head position. So instead, the operation\nMOVE comes along, picks up the modal from the T-head position, and moves it up to the C-head position.\nBut when the modal moves from T up to C, the T position doesn\u2019t disappear from the tree. Instead, the thing\nthat moved leaves behind a little footprint or shadow of where it used to be. In the theoretical literature, it\u2019s called\na \u201cdeleted copy\u201d or a \u201ctrace\u201d \u2014 the idea is that it\u2019s still there in the T-head position in our mind, even though we\npronounce it up in the C-head position. 8.9 MOVE 211\nNotice that now we\u2019ve got two levels of representation in our syntax. MERGE generates the underlying form\nof a sentence, what we\u2019ll call the Deep Structure. And then MOVE comes along and, well, moves things, to give\nus the Surface Structure. A lot of the sentences that we\u2019ve been looking at so far have the same deep structure\nand surface structure, but when we look at questions, we can see that a sentence can have some systematic\ndifferences in how it\u2019s represented at the two levels.\nOne thing I want to point out is that when we observe sentences, and when we make grammaticality judgments\nto observe whether a sentence is grammatical or not, what we\u2019re observing is always the surface structure. The\nSurface Structure is the form of the sentence that we speak: it\u2019s the form that\u2019s out there in the world. We can\u2019t\never observe the Deep Structure; that\u2019s the form of the sentence that exists in our minds. But some of the things\nthat we observe about Surface Structures allow us to conclude that the Deep Structure does exist in our mind and\nthat it\u2019s related in a systematic and predictable way to the Surface Structure. We can represent the relationship\nbetween Deep and Surface Structure using a tree diagram.\nJust to make this idea about levels of representation clearer, let\u2019s look again at these sentences. The idea is that\nwhen these two sentences, one a question and one a declarative sentence, are generated by MERGE, they have\nalmost the exam same Deep Structure. The only difference between their Deep Structures is that the question\nsentence has a [+Q] feature in C and the declarative doesn\u2019t. The declarative sentence is pretty much ok, so it\ndoesn\u2019t need the MOVE operation to do anything, so its Surface Structure is the same as its Deep Structure. But the\nquestion sentence needs to get its [+Q] feature expressed, so MOVE comes along and forms a Surface Structure\nthat\u2019s different from its Deep Structure. So the two sentences that were almost the same in their Deep Structures\nhave one crucial difference between them in their Surface Structures.\nWe saw that when a sentence has a modal in the T-head position, that modal can move up to the C-head\nposition to support a [+Q] feature. What happens when we want to form a question from a sentence that doesn\u2019t\nhave a modal in the T-head position? What about a sentence like this one? Samira phoned.\nWe know that the T-head node has a tense feature in it. In a declarative sentence, that tense feature makes sure\nthat the V-head in its complement has the right feature \u2014 in this case, the past tense form phoned. But we certainly\ndon\u2019t form a question from this sentence by asking, \u201cPhoned Samira?\u201d What happens in this kind of sentence is that\nwe bring the auxiliary do into the T-head position. Because in this case the tense feature is [+past], do becomes its\npast-tense form did. Now that the past tense feature is on the auxiliary, it won\u2019t be on the lexical verb, so the verb\nphoned in V-head just takes its bare form phone. And then to get the [+Q] feature supported, MOVE takes did from\nthe T-head position and moves it up to the C-head position, leading to the Surface Structure, \u201cDid Samira phone?\u201d\nYour challenge now is to think about how our mental grammar forms yes-no questions for sentences that have\nnon-modal auxiliaries in them. What do the Deep Structure and Surface Structure look like for each one? Try to\nfigure it out! 8.10 Wh-Movement\nThe last unit showed that the MOVE operation can move a head from its Deep Structure position to another position at\nSurface Structure. In this unit, we see that MOVE can take a wh-phrase from its Deep Structure position and move it to SpecCP\nat Surface Structure.\n212 8.10 WH-MOVEMENT 213\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The idea is that we draw\nwords, morphemes and features from our mental lexicon, and the operation MERGE combines them using X-bar\nprinciples. The structure that MERGE generates is called a Deep Structure; it\u2019s the underlying form of a sentence\nthat we hold in our minds, but it\u2019s not always exactly like the form that we speak out loud. For some sentences, a\nsecond operation, MOVE, takes some elements from the Deep Structure and moves them to another position in\nthe Surface Structure.\nThe MOVE operation that we\u2019ve seen so far takes a head and moves it to another head position, leaving a trace\nbehind. For obvious reasons, this kind of movement operation is called head movement, and the primary job that\nhead movement does is to form yes-no questions. For this question, Has Faiza eaten lunch yet?, there\u2019s only a small\nset of possible answers that are grammatical: yes, no, I don\u2019t know, maybe.\nBut of course, yes-no questions aren\u2019t the only kinds of questions we ask in English. Take a look at these\nquestions:\nWhat is Ramesh cooking?\nWho is he cooking for?\nWhen is Leela arriving?\nWhere did he buy the ingredients?\nWhy is he making samosas?\nHow do they taste?\nThese questions don\u2019t take Yes or No as their answers, they take phrases.\nWhat is Ramesh cooking? Samosas.\nWho is he cooking for? Leela.\nWhen is Leela arriving? In an hour.\nWhere did he buy the ingredients? At the store.\nWhy is he making samosas? Because Leela loves them.\nHow do they taste? Delicious!\nWe call these wh-questions because most of the English words that we use in these questions are spelled with\n\u201cwh\u201d. Notice that how counts as a wh-word even though it doesn\u2019t have the letter \u201cw\u201d in it.\nWhat we\u2019re observing here is the Surface Structures of these wh-questions. What might their Deep Structures\nbe? To figure that out, let\u2019s think about what the corresponding declarative sentence would be: imagine the\nsituation where we\u2019re answering each question with a full sentence.\nRamesh is cooking samosas.\nHe is cooking for Leela.\nHe bought the ingredients at the store.\nOur theory claims that in the Deep Structure of a wh-question, the wh-phrase is generated in the position that\nit would occupy if it were the answer to the question. In other words, the Deep Structure of the sentence, What\nis Ramesh cooking is really, Ramesh is cooking what. That wh-word what is a pronoun that stands in for the Noun\nPhrase that refers to what he really is cooking. In the situation where we\u2019re asking this question, we don\u2019t know\nthat the answer to the question is samosas, so we need a question word that lets us refer to the samosas without\nknowing their identity. The wh-word what does that job and the idea is that the structural relationship between\nthe verb cooking and the pronoun what is the same as the structural relationship between cooking and samosas.\nLet\u2019s see how it looks in a tree diagram. Here\u2019s the declarative sentence, Ramesh is cooking samosas. The samosas\nare the direct object: they\u2019re the NP in the complement of the verb cooking. And in this declarative sentence, the 216 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nSurface Structure and the Deep Structure are the same. But if we didn\u2019t know what Ramesh was cooking, and we\nwanted to ask the question, MERGE generates a slightly different Deep Structure, like this.\nNotice that the C-head contains a [+Q] feature because we\u2019re going to be asking a question, and a [+wh] feature\nbecause the question is going to be a wh-question. Also notice that this wh-phrase, what, has a wh-feature on it\ntoo.\nSo do we form the surface structure by moving what up into the C-head position? There are two reasons that\u2019s\nnot going to work. The first is obvious: we know, from observing our own grammaticality judgments, that, What\nRamesh is cooking is not the surface form of our sentence! And the second reason is for the sake of the theory: C\nis a head position, so it would mess up the consistency of our theory if we allowed a phrase to move into a head\nposition. Besides, we\u2019re going to need that C head position for something else very soon.\nThe landing site for wh-movement is a position we haven\u2019t yet used, it\u2019s the specifier of CP, sister to C-bar and\ndaughter to CP. The idea is that moving a wh-phrase into the specifier of CP supports the wh-feature in C.\nNow, of course, this still isn\u2019t the right Surface Structure for this sentence. What still needs to happen? We still\nhave this [+Q] feature in C-head that needs to get supported as well, so in this wh-question, in addition to the\nwh-movement of the wh-phrase up to the Specifier of CP, we also have head-movement of the auxiliary from V to\nT to C. And that leads to the grammatical Surface Structure, what is Ramesh cooking?\nSo we\u2019ve now seen two different ways that the MOVE operation works. For head movement, it\u2019s a head that\nmoves, and it moves to another head position. For wh-movement, it\u2019s a whole phrase that moves, and it ends up\nin the Specifier of CP. So when you\u2019re depicting movement, always check that you\u2019ve got the right kind of node\nmoving to the right position.\nNow it\u2019s time for you to practice. Look back at these other wh-questions we generated. These are the Surface\nStructures of these questions. Try drawing trees to represent the Deep Structures of these sentences, and then\ndraw the movement operations that generate the Surface Structure. 8.11 Do-Support\nFORMING YES-NO QUESTIONS\nWhen we form a question that includes a modal auxiliary, the modal moves from the T-head position to the C-\nhead position:\nCould you could read this for me?\nWhen a sentence contains no auxiliary, only a lexical verb, it appears that the lexical verb cannot move out of its\nV-head position. So we\u2019ve proposed that the auxiliary do enters at the T-head position and then moves up to the\nC-head position:\nDDiidd you did see her tattoo?\n*Saw you saw her tattoo?\nOne piece of evidence that do enters the sentence at the T-head position and moves to C-head, rather than just\nentering at the C-head position, is that it bears the tense feature of the sentence: if the tense is [+past], then we\nobserve the form did, but if the tense feature is [-past], we observe the form do or does. Another piece of evidence\nis that whatever verb follows the inserted do is in its bare form, not its [-past] or [+past] forms:\nDDiidd she talk to Darren?\n*Did she talks to Darren?\n*Did she talked to Darren?\nDDooeess she speak Italian?\n*Does she speaks Italian?\n*Does she spoke Italian?\nBoth of these observations suggest that the inserted do gets its tense morphology from the tense feature (either\n[+past] or [-past]) in the T-head.\nNEGATION\nEnglish also uses do-support to form negated sentences, which follow the same pattern: sentences with modals\ndon\u2019t need do, but sentences with lexical verbs and no auxiliaries do need do:\nI could not believe that rumour.\n*I ddiidd not could believe that rumour.\n*She speaks not Italian.\nShe ddooeess not speak Italian.\nIf we accept that not is in a fixed position between T-head and its VP-complement, then the distribution of do\nmakes sense. Just like in questions, the evidence suggests that lexical verbs cannot move out of their V-head\nposition up to the T-head position.\n217 218 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nNON-MODAL AUXILIARIES\nThis pattern of how do behaves in questions and negative sentences gives us a clue about how the other non-\nmodal auxiliaries, have and be, behave.\nNotice that the verb be can always move up to C-head in questions, both when it\u2019s a genuine auxiliary:\nAre you are going to the concert?\nWas she was joking about that?\nAnd when it\u2019s the only verb in the sentence:\nAre you are serious?\nIs this is the place?\nLikewise, be appears before not both when it\u2019s an auxiliary and when it\u2019s the only verb:\nYou are not are going to the concert.\nShe was not was joking about that.\nYou are not are serious.\nThis is not is the place.\nBut have seems to have two different patterns of behaviour. When it is a genuine auxiliary, it behaves like be. It\ncan move up to C-head in questions:\nHave they have moved to Texas already?\nHad she had already heard the news?\nAnd appears before not in negated sentences:\nThey have not have moved to Texas already.\nShe had not had already heard the news.\nBut when have is the only verb in the sentence, it behaves like a lexical verb. It can\u2019t move up to C-head and can\u2019t\nappear before not.\n*Has she has five sisters?\n*Have you have a headache?\n*She has not has five sisters.\n*You have not have a headache.\nInstead, when have is behaving like a lexical verb, it needs do-support.\nDoes she have five sisters?\nDo you have a headache?\nShe does not have five sisters.\nYou do not have a headache.\nTHE DEEP STRUCTURES\nFrom all of this evidence, we can conclude that MERGE treats these three kinds of heads differently:\nModals are generated in T-head, from where they can move to C-head if necessary to support a [+Q] feature.\nBe is generated in V-head, but moves up to T-head (to the left of not) and from there up to C-head if necessary\nHave is generated in V-head, and can move up to T-head and from there up to C- head only if it is an auxiliary\n(that is, only if it has a VP complement). But if it is the only verb in the sentence (and has no VP complement), then\nit behaves like a lexical verb.\nLexical verbs in English are generated in V-head and cannot move to T-head or C-head. 8.12 Psycholinguistics: Traces in the Mind\nWe\u2019ve claimed that when the operation MOVE moves a head or a phrase into a new Surface Structure position, it leaves\na silent copy of itself (a trace) behind in the Deep Structure position. This unit presents psycholinguistic evidence that these\ntraces do form part of our mental representation of sentences.\n219 220 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

For this\nwh-question, Who did Lucy invite to wedding, the Deep Structure looks like this. This wh-pronoun who refers to\nwhoever it is that Lucy invited, and it is generated in this position in the complement of the Verb head, which is\nexactly where the noun phrase complement would be if we know who it was that Lucy invited. The preposition\nphrase gives us more information about the event of inviting, and it\u2019s adjoined at the V-bar level. Because this is a\nwh-question, there\u2019s both a [+Q] feature and a wh-feature in the C-head position. 8.12 PSYCHOLINGUISTICS: TRACES IN THE MIND 221\nThen the operation MOVE does its work.The wh-phrase moves up to the Specifier of CP, where it can support the\nwh-feature in C. Then do comes into the T-head in its past-tense form, did, then moves up to the C-head position.\nOne element of this theory that we\u2019ve been taking for granted so far has to do with the trace that\u2019s left behind\nwhen something moves. When we speak a sentence, we pronounce words in their Surface Structure positions, but\nwe don\u2019t pronounce anything in the Deep Structure position. But when we draw the tree, we show the deleted\ncopy in that Deep Structure position, to suggest that, in the underlying representation, in our mental grammar,\nthere\u2019s something unspoken occupying that position.\nThere is some linguistic evidence for the existence of traces in our mental grammar. We\u2019re claiming that there\u2019s\na trace in this position in the complement of invite. Notice that it\u2019s not possible for any other phrase to occupy that\nposition: if we try to put another noun phrase in the complement position, we can observe that each attempt is\nungrammatical.\nThere\u2019s also some psycholinguistic evidence for the existence of traces. The evidence comes from what\u2019s called\na visual world experiment. In this kind of experiment, a person\u2019s eye-movements are measured using a device\ncalled an eye-tracker. The eye-tracker records where their eyes move while they listen to a spoken paragraph and\nlook at a visual scene. The spoken paragraph goes like this:\nThis story is about a boy and a girl. One day they were at school. The girl was pretty, so the boy kissed the girl. They\nwere both embarrassed after the kiss.\nThe idea behind a visual world experiment is that you look at what\u2019s being mentioned. So when you hear the boy,\nyour eyes move to the picture of the boy, and when you hear the girl, your eyes move to the picture of a girl.\nAt the end of this paragraph, one group of listeners heard a wh-question, Who did the boy kiss that day at school?\nA different group of listeners heard the same paragraph, but followed by a yes-no question, Did the boy kiss the girl\nthat day at school?\nThese two sentences are similar in their structure, but they have a crucial difference. In the complement of the\nverb position, the yes-no question has an overt noun phrase, the girl. In that same position of the wh-question,\nthere\u2019s a trace, a deleted, unpronounced copy of the moved wh-word.\nThe researchers focused on this exact position in the spoken question: they observed where the participants\u2019\neyes moved after the verb kiss. They compared how often the participants looked at the girl vs. how often they\nlooked at the boy. In the yes-no question, when they heard the verb kiss, people looked at the boy 11% more often\nthan to the girl, maybe because the boy is the one doing the kissing. But in the wh-question, when they heard the\nverb kiss, people looked to the girl 21% more than to the boy.\nIn both scenarios, the boy kissed the girl. But people\u2019s eye movements differed in the two conditions. We\nknow from previous studies that eye movements are quite closely synchronized to what\u2019s being mentioned in\nthe discourse. In this study, people\u2019s eyes move to the girl not just when the sentence refers to her overtly, but\nalso when the deep structure contains a trace that refers to her. The evidence from this eye-tracking experiment\nsuggests that traces don\u2019t just exist in tree diagrams, but also in our minds. Practice Time\nExercise 1.

The operation MERGE does exactly one thing, namely, it combines\nwords and features to create x-bar structures. X-bar theory claims that every phrase in every sentence in every\nlanguage of the world is an x-bar phrase. There are only two kinds of things in x-bar phrases, heads and other\nphrases. Inside a given phrase, another phrase can occupy the position of complement, specifier, or adjunct. The\nstructure that MERGE generates is the Deep Structure of a sentence, which exists in our mind. The operation\nMOVE takes the Deep Structure and moves some words or phrases to a new position in the Surface Structure of\nthe sentence, which is the form of the sentence that we speak and observe. When MOVE operates, it always moves\nheads to other head positions, and phrases to other phrase positions. When wh-phrases move, their Surface\nStructure position is always SpecCP. And the very useful notation of tree diagrams allows us to illustrate how Deep\nStructures and Surface Structures are represented in our minds.\n223  CHAPTER 9: SENTENCE STRUCTURE\nAND MEANING\nThis chapter considers the connections between syntax and semantics, in other words, between how a sentence\u2019s\nstructure is organized in the mind, and what it means. The notion of compositionality is introduced, that is, the\nidea that a sentence\u2019s meaning arises not just from the meanings of the words, but also from the way those words\nare combined. We also see that, even though syntax and semantics are intimately connected, there are some\ncomponents of semantics that are independent of the syntax, and that this independence is reflected both in how\nsentences behave and in our brain responses.\nWhen you\u2019ve completed this chapter, you will be able to:\n\u2022 recognize the difference between structural ambiguity and lexical ambiguity,\n\u2022 determine whether a sentence is in the active or passive voice,\n\u2022 identify the thematic roles of noun phrases.\n225  9.1 Ambiguity\nIn Chapter 8, as we learned to draw tree diagrams to illustrate how sentences are represented in the human\nmind, we thought about Deep Structure as the place where meaning is assigned and calculated. For example, in\na question sentence like, \u201cWhat are the kids eating for lunch?\u201d, we claim that the word what is related to the verb\neating in the same way that eggs and eating are related in the declarative sentence, \u201cThe kids are eating eggs for\nlunch.\u201d The relationship between eating/eggs and between eating/what arises at Deep Structure, where eggs and\nwhat are both in the complement of the verb. In our theory, a sentence\u2019s meaning is correlated directly with the\nsentence\u2019s syntax.\nThis idea is a core one in linguistics: the meaning of some combination or words (that is, of a compound, a\nphrase or a sentence) arises not just from the meanings of the words themselves, but also from the way those\nwords are combined. This idea is known as compositionality: meaning is composed from word meanings plus\nmorphosyntactic structures.\nIf structure gives rise to meaning, then it follows that different ways of combining words will lead to different\nmeanings. When a word, phrase, or sentence has more than one meaning, it is ambiguous. The word ambiguous\nis another of those words that has a specific meaning in linguistics: it doesn\u2019t just mean that a sentence\u2019s meaning\nis vague or unclear. Ambiguous means that there are two or more distinct meanings available.\nIn some sentences, ambiguity arises from the possibility of more than one grammatical syntactic representation\nfor the sentence. Think about this example:\nHilary saw the pirate with the telescope.\nThere are at least two potential locations that the PP with the telescope could be adjoined. If the PP is adjoined to\nthe N-bar headed by pirate, then it\u2019s part of the DP. (Notice that the whole DP the pirate with the telescope could be\nreplaced by the pronoun her or him.) In this scenario, the pirate is holding a telescope, and Hilary sees that pirate.\n227 228 CATHERINE ANDERSON 9.1 AMBIGUITY 229\nBut if the PP is adjoined to the V-bar headed by saw, then the DP the pirate is its own constituent, and with\nthe telescope gives information about how the pirate-seeing event happened. In this scenario, Hilary is using the\ntelescope to see the pirate. 230 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nThis single string of words has two distinct meanings, which arise from two different grammatical ways of\ncombining the words in the sentence. This is known as structural ambiguity or syntactic ambiguity. 9.1 AMBIGUITY 231\nStructural ambiguity can sometimes lead to some funny interpretations. This often happens in news headlines,\nwhere function words get omitted. For example, in December 2017, several news outlets reported, \u201cLindsay Lohan\nbitten by snake on holiday in Thailand\u201d, which led a few commentators to express surprise that snakes take\nholidays.\nAnother source of ambiguity in English comes not from the syntactic possibilities for combining words, but from\nthe words themselves. If a word has more than one distinct meaning, then using that word in a sentence can lead\nto lexical ambiguity. In this sentence:\nHeike recognized it by its unusual bark.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Heike recognizes a tree by the look of the bark on its trunk, or if she recognizes a dog by\nthe sound of its barking. In many cases, the word bark would be disambiguated by the surrounding context, but\nin the absence of contextual information, the sentence is ambiguous. 9.2 Events, Participants, and Thematic Roles\nUnlike grammatical roles, which label the syntactic position of noun phrases in a sentence, thematic role labels capture\nsemantic similarities across the participants in events.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

We\u2019re now turning our attention to what\nsentences mean. Sentences usually describe events or states in the world. And events usually have participants:\nthe people or things that play a role in the event. Usually, noun phrases are used to refer to the participants in an\nevent. It turns out that, even across events that are quite different from each other, some participants share some\nelements of meaning.\nTake a look at the underlined phrases in each of these sentences.\nMina tore the wrapping paper.\nSam ran a marathon.\nThe students studied for their exam.\nNeeraja waited for the bus.\nCarlos ate the rice.\nWe can see that the grammatical role of each of these is a subject: They\u2019re all in the specifier of TP. Semantically,\nthe events that each sentence describes are quite different: tearing is different from running which is different\nfrom studying or waiting or eating. But even across these different events, the participants described by the\nunderlined noun phrases all share some semantic similarities: all of them choose to take part in the event, all of\nthem are causing the event to happen. Let\u2019s look at another few sentences.\nMina tore the wrapping paper.\nA nail tore her skirt.\nThe fabric tore.\nAll of these sentences have the same verb and they all describe a tearing event. And all the underlined phrases\nhave the grammatical role of subject, but they don\u2019t share the same semantic properties. In the first sentence,\nMina is the one who causes the tearing event to happen: you can imagine her gleefully tearing the paper open\nto see what\u2019s inside. In the second sentence, the nail is sort of responsible for the tearing, but it certainly doesn\u2019t\nchoose to make it happen. And in the third sentence, the fabric is the thing that the tearing happens to, not the\nparticipant that makes the tearing happen. So even though all three of these NPs are subjects, they don\u2019t all share\nsemantic properties.\nRemember that we use grammatical roles to label the syntactic position of a noun phrase in a sentence. We\u2019re\nnow going to introduce a new kind of label, called thematic roles. We can use thematic roles to identify common\nsemantic properties of the participants in events. An important thing to notice about thematic roles is that they\nare independent of grammatical roles. In this pair of sentences, 234 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nKavitha cooked this lovely meal.\nThis lovely meal was cooked by Kavitha.\nthe grammatical role for Kavitha is different: Kavitha is the subject of one sentence but an oblique in the other.\nBut semantically, Kavitha\u2019s role in the cooking event is the same in both sentences. We say that Kavitha\u2019s thematic\nrole is the agent.\nThe kinds of participants that we label as agents tend to have three properties: usually, they are volitional,\nmeaning they choose to participate in the event. They\u2019re sentient, that is, they\u2019re aware of the event, and often\nthey\u2019re the ones that bring the event about or cause it to take place. Let\u2019s look back at that tearing event.\nMina tore the paper.\nThe paper tore.\nAgain in these sentences, the paper has two different grammatical roles: it\u2019s the direct object in the first sentence\nbut the subject of the second, but semantically its role as a participant in the tearing event is the same in both: it\u2019s\nthe thing that the tearing happens to. Its thematic role is called a theme, or in some books, you\u2019ll see it called a\npatient. Theme participants typically undergo events, that is, events happen to them. They\u2019re affected by events,\nand often they change state or position as a result of an event.\nTake a minute and try to think of some sentences that describe events that have agent and theme participants.\nThey\u2019re probably the two most common thematic role labels, and in fact, one theory of semantics says that every\nparticipant is either an Agent or a Theme, just to a greater or lesser degree. But it can also be useful to have labels\nfor some other kinds of participants, and the grammars of many languages encode other semantic properties\nbesides those two.\nSome languages make a morphological distinction between an animate agent and an inanimate cause. In a\nsentence like, The hurricane destroyed the houses, the hurricane is clearly responsible for the destroying event, but\nit\u2019s not sentient or volitional \u2014 the hurricane isn\u2019t choosing to bring about the destroying. Likewise, in The movie\nfrightened the children, the movie isn\u2019t really a typical agent. We label these inanimate participants with the label\ncause. A cause participant shares the agentive property of causing an event to happen, but it\u2019s not aware of the\nevent and doesn\u2019t choose to cause it, because the cause is inanimate.\nIn this sentence, The knife cut the bread, would you say that the knife is a cause participant? Certainly, the knife is\ninanimate, and it\u2019s not aware of the cutting event, but it\u2019s also not really causing the cutting to happen, is it? There\u2019s\nsome unnamed agent who must be using the knife to cut the bread. We could label the knife as an instrument.\nAn instrument is the participant that an agent uses to make an event happen.\nMany languages have special morphology to indicate the location of an event, like in these sentences:\nThe Habs won the game at the Forum.\nThe kids ran through the sprinkler on the lawn.\nThe parade travelled around the neighbourhood.\nThe noun phrases the forum, the lawn and the neighbourhood all have the thematic role of location.\nSo we\u2019ve got labels like cause, instrument, and location to describe some of the roles that inanimate\nparticipants typically have in events. I want to return to animate participants to look at one more important role.\nLet\u2019s look at the human participants in these sentences:\nPhoebe tripped on the curb.\nSun-Jin won the lottery.\nThe movie frightened Farah.\nIf Phoebe tripped on the curb, it doesn\u2019t seem quite right to label Phoebe as an agent \u2014 presumably, she didn\u2019t\nchoose to trip on the curb, even if she is aware of it, and she isn\u2019t really the cause of the tripping event; the curb\nis. And no matter how badly you might want to win the lottery, you can\u2019t really cause it to happen, so Sun-Jin isn\u2019t a\ngreat example of an agent either. Likewise, if we say that the movie frightened Farah, Farah isn\u2019t exactly a theme;\nyes, the frightening is happening to her, but she\u2019s not necessarily changed by it, and she is aware of the event.\nLet\u2019s label these participants with the thematic role of the experiencer. Experiencers are like the middle ground 9.2 EVENTS, PARTICIPANTS, AND THEMATIC ROLES 235\nbetween agents and themes. They are animate and sentient, so they\u2019re aware of events happening, but they don\u2019t\nnecessarily choose or cause events to happen; events happen to them. Because experiencers have this in-between\nstatus, they can show up either as subjects or as objects, like in these examples:\nThe children were scared of the clowns.\nThe clowns frightened the children.\nAnd we could say that Phoebe and Sun-Jin are experiencers of their tripping and winning events: they don\u2019t\ncause the events to happen, but they are aware of the events happening.\nTo sum up, thematic role labels capture the semantic properties of participants in events, independent of the\nsyntactic position of the noun phrase. Just because something has the grammatical role of a subject doesn\u2019t mean\nit will necessarily have the thematic role of agent and vice versa. There\u2019s a fair amount of argument in the literature\nabout exactly how many thematic role labels are necessary to capture the relevant patterns of behaviour in the\nlanguages of the world, with proposals ranging from two to about fifteen thematic roles. We\u2019ll settle on the middle\nground and use six thematic role labels:\n\u2022 Agent\n\u2022 Theme\n\u2022 Cause\n\u2022 Instrument\n\u2022 Location\n\u2022 Experiencer 9.3 Thematic Roles and Passive Sentences\nEven though the subject of a sentence is often the agent, that\u2019s not always the case. In a passive sentence, the phrase that\nusually occupies the object position gets promoted to the subject position, while the subject phrase might become an oblique\nor might disappear altogether.\n236 9.3 THEMATIC ROLES AND PASSIVE SENTENCES 237\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

And it often happens that\nthe agent role shows up in subject position and the theme role in object position. These sentences illustrate that\ncommon pattern: the subjects are all agents and the objects are all themes.\nIlona broke an icicle.\nZainab introduced the guest speaker.\nThe manager fired the receptionist.\nIt\u2019s a common tendency across languages for the agent to occupy the subject position, but of course not all\nagents are subjects, and not all subjects are agents. These next sentences describe pretty much the same events\nas the last three, but the noun phrases in subject position are not agents.\nThe icicle broke.\nThe guest speaker was introduced by Zainab.\nThe receptionist got fired.\nSo while the usual pattern is for agents to be mapped onto subject position and themes onto object position,\nmost languages also have a way of reversing that usual mapping. In English, the strategy we have involves both\nmorphology and syntax and is called a passive structure. A passive sentence reverses the usual mapping between\nthematic roles and grammatical roles.\nIn this first sentence, The police arrested the burglar, the police are the agent and they\u2019re in subject position, and\nthe burglar is the theme in direct object position.\nIn the second sentence, The burglar was arrested by the police, the semantic relationship of the police and the\nburglar to the arresting event is the same: the police are still the agent and the burglar is still the theme. But 238 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ntheir grammatical roles are different. We can use this passive structure to reverse the usual pattern and focus our\nattention more on the theme than on the agent.\nThe reversal that happens in a passive sentence works the same even if the thematic roles aren\u2019t the classic\nagent and theme. Take a look at this pair of sentences,\nThe exhibit impressed the audience.\nThe audience was impressed by the exhibit.\nIn the first sentence, which is an active sentence, the usual mapping plays out not with an agent and theme,\nbut with a cause participant in subject position and an experiencer in the object position. When we use a passive\nstructure in the second sentence, the thematic roles of the participants don\u2019t change, but their grammatical roles\ndo.\nSo how can you tell if a sentence is in the passive voice? It\u2019s easy: a passive sentence will always have some form\nof the verb be, followed by a past participle. All of these examples are passives.\nThe burglar was arrested.\nThe children were invited to the party.\nThis flight is expected to arrive on time.\nThe candidate is being prepared for the debate.\nI am appalled by your behaviour.\nBut if you have the verb be plus a present participle, or if you have the verb have plus a past participle, then\nthose aren\u2019t passives. All of these sentences are in the active voice:\nThe report is calling for changes.\nThe burglar was planning a heist.\nThe children were behaving poorly.\nThe hosts have invited several guests.\nThe dog had eaten all the Halloween candy.\nA passive structure is a morphosyntactic strategy that English uses to reverse the usual mapping of thematic\nroles onto grammatical roles. Some languages accomplish this reversal with morphology on the verb or with\nmorphology on the noun, but it\u2019s pretty common for a language to have a strategy in the morphology or syntax\nthat has this effect in the semantics of a sentence. 9.4 Neurolinguistics: Using EEG to Investigate Syntax\nand Semantics\nBy considering the difference between grammatical roles and thematic roles, we saw that the syntax and the semantics of\nsentences are represented differently from each other in our minds. We also have evidence from neural imaging that syntactic\nknowledge and semantic knowledge are processed differently in the brain.\n239 240 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

For example, we saw that a given string of words can have two different\nmeanings if it has two different grammatical syntactic structures. And yet, we also observed that syntax is\nindependent of syntax. A noun phrase that has the semantic thematic role of Agent often occupies the syntactic\nposition of Subject, but not all Agents are Subjects, and not all Subjects are Agents!\nThe division of labour between thematic roles and grammatical roles is some evidence that syntax and\nsemantics are represented differently in our minds. There\u2019s also evidence from neural imaging to show that\nour brains process semantic information differently from syntactic information. This evidence comes from\nelectroencephalography or EEG. Electroencephalography uses electrodes to measure electrical activity on a\nperson\u2019s scalp from which scientists can draw conclusions about the person\u2019s neural activity. The particular EEG\ntechnique that gets used in neurolinguistics is ERPs or event-related potentials, which measure the timing of the\nneural response to a particular event, like a sound or a word.\nWhen we\u2019re observing ERPs, we always do so by comparing responses to different kinds of events, and the usual\ncomparison is between events that are expected and events that are unexpected. For example, a sentence like,\n\u201cShe takes her coffee with cream and \u2026\u201d sets up a very strong expectation in your mind of what the next word\nwill be. If the next word that arrives in the sentence matches your mind\u2019s expectation, then the electrical response\nat your scalp will look something like this: the baseline condition. But if the next word that shows up violates\nyour mind\u2019s expectation, then compare your brain\u2019s response: We observe a spike in negative voltage about 400\nmilliseconds after that unexpected word appears.\nThis response is called an N400. The N in N400 stands for a negative voltage, and the 400 indicates that\nthis spike in negative voltage shows up, on average, about 400 milliseconds after the event. The N400 was first\nobserved in 1980 by Kutas & Hillyard and has been replicated hundreds of times since then. It\u2019s clear from all\nthese studies that the particular kind of event that leads to an N400 response is a word that is unexpected in the\nsemantic context.\nThe N400 is the brain\u2019s response to an unexpected or surprising event, but not every kind of surprise will\nproduce an N400. In other words, we have expectations about things besides the meanings of sentences. Think\nabout a simple sentence like, \u201cThe bread was\u2026\u201d If that sentence finishes with \u201ceaten\u201d, that fits our mind\u2019s\nexpectation, and this is the baseline brain response. Now, what expectation do you have for this sentence, \u201cThe\nice cream was in the..\u201d? You probably expect a noun to come next, to follow the preposition and determiner. But\nif what comes next is not a noun but a verb participle, this violates your mind\u2019s expectation. Notice that the word\neaten is semantically consistent with ice cream, but is not consistent with the syntax of the sentence: determiners\nare followed by nouns, not verbs. So the brain\u2019s response is a positive voltage about 600 milliseconds after that\nunexpected word: a P600.\nWhen we\u2019re using language in real time \u2014 either reading or listening \u2014 our mind sets up expectations about\nwhat\u2019s going to happen next. If what happens next violates our semantic expectations, the brain\u2019s response is an\nN400. And if what happens next violates our syntactic expectations, the brain\u2019s response is a P600.\nThese two different brain responses give us further evidence that syntax is independent of semantics in our\nbrains! 9.5 Neurolinguistics and Second Language Learning\nJust like EEG can give us insights into the mental grammar of native speakers of a language, it can also reveal things about\nhow L2 learners develop a mental grammar for the language they\u2019re learning. The results suggest that L2 learners can achieve\nnative-like responses in syntax and semantics, with enough study and practice.\n242 9.5 NEUROLINGUISTICS AND SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING 243\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Linguists refer to your native\nlanguage, your first language, as your L1. But many people in the world speak more than one language, and many\nof those people learned a second or third language in a different way from their L1. Any language that you learned\nafter childhood, whether you learned it in school, using software, by travelling or immigrating somewhere, is called\nan L2 (even if it\u2019s really your third or fourth language).\nLearning an L2 is different from learning an L1 for a couple of different reasons. One is that, obviously, the\nlanguage learner is not a child, so their cognitive processes might be different from those of a child. L1 learning\nhappens by being immersed in a language environment, and most of the learning is unconscious, without overt\nteaching. L2 learning often happens with a lot of conscious effort: studying and memorizing and practicing.\nBut of course, the biggest difference between L1 learning and L2 learning is that when you start learning an L2,\nyou already know at least one other language. The mental grammar of your L1 can influence the mental grammar\nthat you\u2019re developing for your L2: this is called transfer. Transfer can be helpful in L2 learning or it can pose a\nchallenge. If your L1 includes a structure that\u2019s similar to a structure in the L2, then you might experience positive\ntransfer, which facilitates learning the L2: you can transfer what you know from L1 and apply it to the L2. But if\nthe structures that you\u2019re learning in L2 are different from those in your L1, then you might experience negative\ntransfer: the knowledge from your L1 could make it more difficult to learn the new structures in the L2. And of\ncourse, you might experience both positive and negative transfer from your L1 to different parts of the grammar\nof your L2.\nOne theory of second language acquisition predicts that we would observe differences between native speakers\nand beginner L2 learners, but as the L2 learners become more proficient, their mental processes should become 244 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nmore and more native-like \u2014 that is the mental grammar of a fluent L2 speaker should look very similar to the\nmental grammar of an L1 speaker of that language. We can use the tools of psycholinguistics and neuroscience to\nlearn about the mental grammars of L2 learners. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the evidence.\nSeveral studies have compared N400 effects in L1 and L2 speakers of a language. Remember that the N400 is\nan electrophysiological response that our brains show when a word is semantically unexpected in a given context.\nThe brains of native speakers of English show a negative voltage about 400 milliseconds after a semantically\nunexpected word (socks), compared to an expected word. But what do the brains of non-native speakers show?\nWhat do we see in L2 learners?\nA 2001 paper by Anja Hahne compared L1 speakers of German with L1 speakers of Russian who had moved to\nGermany in their 20s and had been living there and studying German for an average of six years. The experiment\nused fairly simple German sentences like these ones:\nDie T\u00fcr wurde geschlossen / The door was being closed.\nDer Ozean wurde geschlossen / The ocean was being closed.\nObviously, the word closed is a reasonable way for the first sentence to end but is a pretty unexpected way for\nthe second sentence to end. So it\u2019s not surprising that the native speakers of German showed an N400 in response\nto sentence 2 compared to sentence 1. The L2 speakers, the ones who had started learning German in their\n20s, also showed an N400 to sentence 2. Hahne concluded that words that are semantically unexpected cause\n\u201cessentially similar semantic integration problems in native participants and second-language learners\u201d (Hahne,\n2001: 263). In other words, the evidence from the N400 suggests that the lexical semantic component of an L2\nlearner\u2019s mental grammar is not too different from that of an L1 grammar.\nNow, we know that there\u2019s a whole lot more to mental grammar than just the meanings of words. What can ERPs\ntells us about morphology and syntax? Remember that native speakers\u2019 brains often show a P600 response to\nsentences that are syntactically unexpected. For many years, studies that looked at the P600 in L2 learners seemed\nto suggest that adult language learners never really approached native-like proficiency in their L2 morphosyntax:\nthe P600 response to syntactic violations was significantly delayed or not there at all in these late learners. But\nsome more recent research has suggested that maybe those earlier studies just didn\u2019t give the learners enough\ntime to learn their L2 \u2014 of course, their mental grammar wasn\u2019t native-like if they hadn\u2019t been learning the\nlanguage for very long.\nA 2013 study by Harriet Bowden and her colleagues looked at L1 English speakers who started learning\nL2 Spanish in university. They compared learners who had completed first-year Spanish to learners who had\ncompleted more than three years of university Spanish and had spent a year abroad. And they included a\ncontrol group of L1 speakers of Spanish. The researchers presented Spanish sentences that violated syntactic\nexpectations about word order like these ones. Sentence 1, \u201cI have to run many miles this week\u201d has the expected\nword order, while sentence 2, \u201cI have to miles many run this week\u201d is unexpected in its word order: the quantifier\nmany comes after the noun miles, and that whole complement phrase comes before the verb run. Sentence 2 is\nungrammatical in Spanish.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the native speakers of Spanish showed a P600 in response to the ungrammatical sentence.\nBut so did the advanced L2 learners: their ERP response was the same as that of the L1 Spanish speakers. It was\nonly the beginning learners, the ones who had had only a year of Spanish, who showed an atypical P600: it was\na smaller response and more diffuse. The researchers concluded that \u201cUniversity foreign-language learners who\ntake L2 classes through much of college and also study abroad for one or two semesters \u2026show evidence of\nnative-like brain processing of syntax\u201d (Bowden et al., 2013: 2508).\nSo this study suggests that one year of studying a language maybe isn\u2019t enough to achieve native-like fluency,\nand three years of study including a year of immersion allows a learner to approach native proficiency, but\nthe researchers also wondered whether the kind of language-learning makes a difference to learners. If you\u2019re\nlearning a language in university, you probably spend three or four hours a week in the classroom, and maybe\ntwo or three more hours each week studying. But that\u2019s not the only way to learn a language. 9.5 NEUROLINGUISTICS AND SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNING 245\nA study in Montreal looked at university students who were L1 speakers of Korean and Chinese who were\nenrolled in a nine-week intensive English L2 course. These learners were studying, practising, using English at\nleast 8-10 hours a day, five days a week, for nine weeks. The researchers tested the learners on sentences with\nmorphosyntactic violations in the tense features on the verb, like these ones:\n1a. The teacher did not start the lesson / 1b. The teacher did not started the lesson.\n2a. The teacher had not started the lesson / 2b. The teacher had not start the lesson.\nNotice that in 1b and 2b, the verb has unexpected morphology on it. A native speaker of English would show\na P600 response to 1b and 2b in comparison to 1a and 2a. In this study, the researchers measured learners\u2019 ERP\nresponses at the beginning of the course and after the nine weeks, and they also asked the learners to judge\nwhether the sentences were grammatical. At the beginning of the course, none of the learners showed P600s in\nresponse to the syntactically unexpected sentences, and they also weren\u2019t very successful at deciding whether\nsentences were grammatical or ungrammatical. After the nine-week course, all of the learners showed P600\nresponses to the syntactically unexpected sentences, and the learners who scored highest on the grammatical\njudgments showed the largest P600s. This study suggests that even short-term, intensive L2 learning can help a\nlearner develop a mental grammar that approaches that of a native L1 speaker.\nAnd the results of all of these studies tell us that L2 language learners can achieve fluency that compares to that\nof a native speaker; it just takes lots of training to get there! 9.6 Children Learning Syntax\nVery young children are learning the grammar of their language very rapidly. Before they are able to produce much language\n(spoken or signed), comprehension experiments show us that babies already have some knowledge of syntactic categories\nand constituents.\n246 9.6 CHILDREN LEARNING SYNTAX 247\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

What about syntax? What do babies and young children know about the\nsyntax components of their grammar? And how can we tell?\nMaybe we should start by thinking about what young children know about words. On average, children start\nto speak their first word around age one, and they start to combine two or more words some time after that,\nby about age one and a half. But if you\u2019ve ever spent any time with young children, you know that they can\nunderstand a great deal more than they can say! Their comprehension is often much more advanced than their\nability to produce spoken or signed words. But comprehension is much harder to observe. How can we tell what\nbabies and toddlers understand about language?\nOne simple technique is called preferential looking. In this kind of experiment, researchers use a large screen\nor television. The baby or toddler sits strapped into a booster seat, facing the screen. The screen is split so that two\ndifferent pictures appear, one on each side of the screen. While the pictures or are on the screen, a recorded voice\nspeaks a sentence, maybe something like, \u201cLook! Can you find the foot?\u201d The idea is that if the baby understands\nthe word foot, they\u2019re going to look at the picture of the foot, not the picture of the banana. The researchers keep\ntrack of the direction of the baby\u2019s head-turn, or they use eye-tracking to measure the baby\u2019s eye movements. This\nkind of experiment has shown that babies pretty reliably look at the named object by about ten months, and even\nas young as six months, they\u2019re looking at the named object more often than chance would predict. So at the age\nof six months, babies are already beginning to link up word forms with their meanings. What that means is that\nwe can use this same preferential looking technique to figure out what kids know about syntax.\nInstead of a picture of a single item, we could use the split screen to display two similar scenes. I\u2019ve just put a\nsimple picture here, but researchers often use short videos. The two scenes involve the same participants, but in 248 CATHERINE ANDERSON\ndifferent configurations. In the images here, the one on the left shows the adult chasing the kid, while on the right\nthe kid is chasing the adult. The recorded sentence that plays, \u201cLook! The kid is chasing the woman!\u201d matches only\none of the scenes. So if children look towards the matching scene, does that mean they know something about\nsyntax? Or are they just paying attention to the word meanings?\nDo you remember the idea of compositionality? It says that syntax matters for sentence meanings \u2014 the\nmeaning of a sentence comes not just from adding together the meanings of the words, but also from the way\nthose words are combined, that is, from the syntax.\nAs adults, we know that the sentence, \u201cthe kid is chasing the woman\u201d can only mean this one, the one on the\nright. But if kids were understanding the sentence just by paying attention to the meanings of the words, well both\nscenes would be plausible: after all, both scenes show a kid, both scenes show a chasing event, and both scenes\nshow a woman. It turns out, though, that children as young as 15 months, just a little over one year, look more\noften towards the correct image or video. That suggests that they\u2019re not just adding together the meanings of the\nwords in the sentence, but that they\u2019re also sensitive to the way those words are combined, to the syntax, because\nthat\u2019s what distinguishes the kid chasing the woman from the woman chasing the kid.\nSo kids who are just a little older than one are already sensitive to syntactic constituent structure and its relation\nto meaning. What else do young children know about syntax? Some experiments with young children don\u2019t involve\nscreens, but actual toy items. In this experiment, researchers introduced 14-month-old children to novel, made-up\nwords, that the children would not already be familiar with. The experimenter presented small toys to the child\nand said, \u201cThese are bblliicckkeettss. This one is a blicket and this one is a blicket.\u201d So the child had a couple examples of\nwhat a blicket is. Then the experimenter presented two new toys, one of which was from the same category as the\nearlier ones \u2014 in this case, the category of animals \u2014 but was a different colour, and the other of which was the\nsame colour, but from a different category. When the experimenter said, \u201cCan you give me the blicket?\u201c, if the child\nreaches for the new toy of the same category, that tells us they\u2019ve figured that blicket means animal. But if they\nreach for the same colour, they\u2019ve concluded that blicket means pink thing. The 14-month-olds reached for the new\nanimal of a different colour more often than they reached for the toy that matched in colour. But the pattern was\nreversed for children who heard a different syntactic frame. If the toys had been introduced with the new word\nin an adjective position, \u201cThese are blickish. This one is blickish and this one is blickish,\u201d then when the experimenter\nasked, \u201cCan you give me the blickish one?\u201c, the children were much more likely to choose the one that matched in\ncolour.\nThese results indicate that when one-year-olds hear a new word in a noun position, they conclude that it has a\nnoun-like meaning, and refers to a thing or a category of things. But if it\u2019s in adjective position, then its meaning\nis probably something more like an attribute or property. In short, one-year-olds seem to be sensitive to the\ndifferences between syntactic categories.\nThere\u2019s so much learning happening in that second year. Kids are learning new words very rapidly, and learning\nhow words pattern in the morphological and syntactic behaviour. In fact, by the time they turn two, kids are\nsensitive to verb subcategories too!\nIn this split-screen experiment, when experimenters presented the novel verb mooping in a transitive frame, like\n\u201cThe lady is mooping my brother,\u201d then two-year-olds looked more often to the scene where one participant is doing\nsomething to the other, like pushing. But when the novel verb appeared in an intransitive frame, like \u201cThe lady and\nmy brother are mooping,\u201d then the children looked more often to the scene where the two participants are doing\nthe same activity together, like waving. This suggests that, by age two, children are sensitive not only to syntactic\ncategories, but also to subcategories!\nSo to go back to the question we started with, \u201cWhat do kids know about syntax?\u201d It turns out the answer is that,\neven before children start combining words to make phrases in their own speech or signing, they already know\nquite a lot about how words combine in the grammar. Practice Time\nExercise 1. Groucho Marx has famously joked, \u201cOne morning I shot an elephant in my pyjamas. How he got in my\npyjamas I don\u2019t know.\u201d Draw the two tree diagrams that correspond to the two separate meanings of the sentence,\n\u201cI shot an elephant in my pyjamas.\u201d\nExercise 2. The following sentences are taken from The Venturesome Voyages of Captain Voss, by John Claus\nVoss, which is in the Public Domain in Canada. For each sentence, identify the thematic role of each NP.\nBecause I had found, from the day I first met Dempster on Cocos Island till he died, that he was a straightforward\nand reliable man, I have decided to place confidence in you. I now ask, can you and will you procure for me a\nvessel and fit her out properly, sail with me to Cocos Island and assist me to put the treasure on board and take it\nto Victoria?\nThe wind freshened considerably and hauled round to the west, at the same time throwing up a lively choppy\nsea, which made the little vessel jump about worse than a bucking horse.\nAll three ships under full sail passed Cape Flattery towards evening, shaping their courses toward the south-\nwest with a fresh easterly breeze.\nExercise 3. The following paragraph is taken from Swiss Sonata by Gwethalyn Graham, which is in the Public\nDomain in Canada. The verb component of several clauses has been underlined. For each underlined set of verbs,\nsay whether it is passive or active.\nHer eyes reached Miss Ellerton, the games mistress, who, after a few impatient glances in Mlle Tourain\u2019s\ndirection, had got up from her chair and wandered over to the french windows where she was standing now,\nholding the curtain back with one hand and looking over the lovely grey town where dusk already lurked here\nand there. Some of the light which yet remained in the outer world was caught in her hair and outlined her small\nfeatures so that the others, sitting patiently in their chairs, were aged by their contrasting dullness. Am\u00e9lie Tourain\nleaned forward a little and switched on her desk light, then remained motionless looking at the girl by the window.\nAn unaccountable conviction that Miss Ellerton was in some way connected with the turmoil in her mind had\ncomplete possession of her.\nExercise 3. Think about your experience of learning an L2. What parts of your L1 grammar led to a positive\ntransfer to your L2? What parts of your L1 created a negative transfer to your L2? Consider phonetics and\nphonology as well as morphology and syntax.\n249 Summary\nThe crucial idea in this chapter is the idea of compositionality: the syntactic structures that our mind uses to\ncombine words play a vital role in the meaning of sentences. If a sentence has more than one grammatical tree\nstructure, then it will be ambiguous. We also learned in this chapter that there are components of semantics that\nare not dependent on syntax. Linguists use thematic role labels to capture the semantic properties of participants\nin events, independent of the grammatical roles of the NPs. And while most languages have a typical mapping\nbetween the grammatical role of subject and the thematic role of agent, this is not the only possible mapping,\nand languages all have ways of overriding that mapping. Evidence from neurolinguistics suggests that syntax and\nsemantics are processed differently in the brain, both in native speakers and in L2 learners.\n250 CHAPTER 10: MORE ABOUT\nMEANING\nThis chapter looks at the ways that meanings are represented in our minds. One way that our mind represents\nword meanings is by collecting up memories of all the thing in the world that a word can refer to, that is the\ndenotations or extensions of a word. But beyond just a set of exemplars, our minds also have mental definitions\nthat allow us to decide whether a given thing the world could be referred to by a certain word. These mental\ndefinitions are called intensions, and this chapter explores how they might be represented in our minds, and how\npsycholinguistic experiments can give us evidence for how intensions are represented. This chapter also looks at\nsome of the ways that we calculate meanings that depend on context.\nBy the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\u2022 identify the components of word meaning: intension, extension, denotation, and connotation,\n\u2022 discuss how meanings of certain categories of words might be represented in the mind,\n\u2022 predict whether a given pair of words will prime each other in a behavioural experiment,\n\u2022 recognize whether a given expression is deictic or not.\n251  10.1 Elements of Word Meaning: Intensions and\nExtensions\nOne way to define the meaning of a word is to point to examples in the world of things the word refers to; these examples\nare the word\u2019s denotation, or extension. Another component of a word\u2019s meaning is the list of attributes in our mind that\ndescribe the things the word can refer to; this list is the intension of a word.\n253 254 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If someone asked you, \u201cWhat\u2019s 10.1 ELEMENTS OF WORD MEANING: INTENSIONS AND EXTENSIONS 255\nthe meaning of the word pencil?\u201d you\u2019d probably be able to describe it \u2014 it\u2019s something you write with, it has\ngraphite in it, it makes a mark on paper that can be erased, it\u2019s long and thin and doesn\u2019t weigh much. Or you might\njust hold up a pencil and say, \u201cThis is a pencil\u201d. Pointing to an example of something or describing the properties\nof something, are two pretty different ways of representing a word meaning, but both of them are useful.\nOne part of how our minds represent word meanings is by using words to refer to things in the world. The\ndenotation of a word or a phrase is the set of things in the world that the word refers to. So one denotation for\nthe word pencil is this pencil right here. All of these things are denotations for the word pencil. Another word for\ndenotation is extension.\nIf we look at the phrase, the Prime Minister of Canada, the denotation or extension of that phrase right now in\n2017 is Justin Trudeau. So does it make sense to say that Trudeau is the meaning of that phrase the Prime Minister\nof Canada? Well, only partly: in a couple of years, that phrase might refer to someone else, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nthat its entire meaning would have changed. And in fact, several other phrases, like, the eldest son of former Prime\nMinister Pierre Trudeau, and the husband of Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, and the curly-haired leader of the Liberal Party\nall have Justin Trudeau as their current extension, but that doesn\u2019t mean that all those phrases mean the same\nthing, does it? Along the same lines, the phrase the President of Canada doesn\u2019t refer to anything at all in the\nworld, because Canada doesn\u2019t have a president, so the phrase has no denotation, but it still has meaning. Clearly,\ndenotation or extension is an important element of word meaning, but it\u2019s not the entire meaning.\nWe could say that each of these images is one extension for the word bird, but in addition to these particular\nexamples from the bird category, we also have in our minds some list of attributes that a thing needs to have for\nus to label it as a bird. That mental definition is called our intension. So think for a moment: what is your intension\nfor the word bird? Probably something like a creature with feathers, wings, claws, a beak, it lays eggs, it can fly. If\nyou see something in the world that you want to label, your mental grammar uses the intension to decide whether\nthat thing in the word is an extension of the label, to decide if it\u2019s a member of the category. The next unit will look\nmore closely at how our intensions might be organized in our minds.\nOne other important element to the meaning of a word is its connotation: the mental associations we have\nwith the word, some of which arise from the kinds of other words it tends to co-occur with. A word\u2019s connotations\nwill vary from person to person and across cultures, but when we share a mental grammar, we often share many\nconnotations for words. Look at these example sentences:\nDennis is cheap and stingy.\nDennis is frugal and thrifty.\nBoth sentences are talking about someone who doesn\u2019t like to spend much money, but they have quite different\nconnotations. Calling Dennis cheap and stingy suggests that you think it\u2019s kind of rude or unfriendly that he doesn\u2019t\nspend much money. But calling him frugal and thrifty suggests that it\u2019s honourable or virtuous not to spend very\nmuch. Try to think of some other pairs of words that have similar meanings but different connotations.\nTo sum up, our mental definition of a word is an intension, and the particular things in the world that a word can\nrefer to are the extension or denotation of a word. Most words also have connotations as part of their meaning;\nthese are the feelings or associations that arise from how and where we use the word. 10.2 Intensions in the Mind\nThis unit considers two possible ways that intensions might be organized in our minds. It\u2019s possible that some intensions\nare organized around sets of binary features (similar to phonetic features!) that divide up the world into clear categories.\nBut binary features don\u2019t leave room for exceptions. It\u2019s also possible that our mind organizes word meanings around fuzzy\ncategories, which have both prototypical members and peripheral members.\n256 10.2 INTENSIONS IN THE MIND 257\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In this unit, we\u2019ll\nthink about how those intensions might be organized in the mind.\nOne theory suggests that intensions might be organized in our minds as sets of binary features. So the\nintension for the word bird might be made up of features like [+living], [-mammal], [+wings], [+eggs], [+flying]. The\nintension for the word fish would have some features that are the same as the intension for bird, like [+living], [-\nmammal], [+eggs]. But the intension for fish would have [-wings] and [-flying]; instead, it would have [+swimming].\nSome of these features could be shared across intensions for words that refer to quite different things in the\nworld, so the intension for the word airplane, for example, probably includes [+wings] and [+flying], but [-alive].\nThe nice thing about using feature composition (also known as componential analysis) to represent intensions\nis that it can capture some of these similarities and differences across categories of things in the world using\nthe simple, efficient mechanism of binary features. It may well be that our intensions for words describing the\nnatural world are made up of some binary features. But can you think of any problems with this way of organizing\nmeanings? Think about a penguin. A penguin is a member of the category of things that can be labelled with the\nword bird, and it shares some of the features of the intension for the word bird: it\u2019s a living thing, it has wings, it\nlays eggs. But a penguin can\u2019t fly. In fact, a penguin has the feature that\u2019s associated with our intension for fish: it\ncan swim. So it\u2019s definitely a bird, but it definitely doesn\u2019t have all the features associated with the intension for\nbird. If our intensions were organized in our minds just as binary features, then we wouldn\u2019t be able to represent\nthe meaning of the word penguin in our mind, but clearly, we do have an intension for the word penguin. So how\nmight penguins be represented in our minds?\nAnother theory of intensions suggests that we have fuzzy categories in our minds. These categories contain 258 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nexemplars, which are basically our memories of every time we\u2019ve encountered an extension of the word. Some\nmembers of the category are prototypical exemplars: they have all the typical attributes of members of that\ncategory, so they\u2019re near the center of the category. For most North Americans, a robin is about as prototypical\nas it gets as an exemplar of the category bird. Some exemplars are more peripheral: they have fewer of the\ndefining attributes and they might have some attributes that aren\u2019t typical. So a penguin, for example, is more\nperipheral because it doesn\u2019t fly, and an ostrich is peripheral because it\u2019s so darn big. Because the category has\nfuzzy boundaries, we might even have some exemplars in our mind that aren\u2019t really members of the category at\nall, but share some attributes with category members, like bats: they\u2019re small and they fly, but they\u2019re not actually\nbirds. In the next unit, we\u2019ll talk about some of the evidence we have that our intensions might be organized in\nfuzzy categories with prototypes. 10.3 Psycholinguistics of Word Meanings\nBehavioural psycholinguistic experiments can give us some insights into how word meanings are represented in the mind.\nThe results of these experiments suggest that prototypes and fuzzy categories do play a part in our mental representations of\nword meanings, and that related word meanings are connected to each other in our minds.\n259 260 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Our minds construct categories of things based on our experience in the world: each time we\nencounter an extension of a word, we count it as an exemplar in that fuzzy category. There is some evidence from\npsychology and psycholinguistics that our mind really does represent a difference between prototypical category\nmembers and peripheral members. For lots of categories, we have some instincts about what kinds of exemplars\nare prototypical and what kinds are peripheral. When we give somebody the name of a category and ask them to\nname an exemplar, people from a given language community are remarkably alike in the first things they name\nas exemplars. If your mental grammar for English is like mine, then perhaps your prototypical bird is a robin, your\nprototypical fruit is an apple, and your prototypical tool is a hammer.\nIn a behavioural study of word recognition, participants saw a word appear on a screen and had to say the\nword out loud. This is called a rapid naming task. Some of the words referred to prototypical exemplars of\ntheir particular category and some of them referred to peripheral exemplars. The prototypical and peripheral\nexemplars were all mixed up in the experiment, but when the researchers measured how fast people had been\nable to name the word that they saw, the found that people were faster to name the prototypes than the\nperipheral exemplars.\nThe same researchers used these words in a lexical decision task. In this kind of task, a word appears briefly on\na screen, and the person\u2019s job is just to decide whether it\u2019s a word or not, and say Yes or No. So if the word pants\nappears on the screen, you would say \u201cYes\u201d, because it\u2019s a real word in English. But if pfonc appears, you say \u201cno\u201d,\nbecause that\u2019s not a word of English. What the researchers found in the lexical decision experiment was, again,\nthat people are fast to make a decision about a word if it refers to a prototypical category member, and slower to\nmake the decision if the word refers to a peripheral member. 10.3 PSYCHOLINGUISTICS OF WORD MEANINGS 261\nThese findings indicate that the process of recognizing a word is easier and faster if that word refers to a\nprototype. We can interpret these findings to mean that our intensions for categories are made up of exemplars\nand that prototypical exemplars have a privileged position in our intensions.\nSo that\u2019s a couple of examples of psycholinguistic tasks we can use to observe how words are processed in\nour minds: a simple naming task, and a lexical decision task. There\u2019s an additional task that we can combine with\neach of these, to allow us to investigate relationships between different words. That task is called priming. A\nprimed lexical decision task works like this: First, a word appears on the screen for a very short length of time:\nthat word is called the prime. The prime disappears, and then a second word appears on the screen. This word is\nthe target, and the participant makes a lexical decision about the target. The prime word can have an influence\non how quickly people make their lexical decision about the target word.\nFor example, in one condition, the prime might be doctor and the target nurse. In another condition, the prime\ncould be apple and the target nurse. As you might expect, people are faster to make their lexical decision to\nnurse when it\u2019s primed by doctor than when it\u2019s primed by apple. When we observe this faster lexical decision, we\ninterpret that to mean that these two words are connected to each other in our minds.\nOver the years, psychologists and psycholinguists have conducted thousands of experiments on priming, and\nthe results of these experiments show us how words are related to each other in our minds. The scientific\nliterature has shown priming between words that are members of the same category, for words that are\nsynonyms, antonyms, and even for words that describe things that share attributes. For example, an orange and\na baseball aren\u2019t members of the same category, but they\u2019re both spheres, so they can prime each other.\nLooking at all these and many other priming effects, we can conclude that those semantic relationships play an\nimportant role in how the meanings of a word are organized in our minds. 10.4 Deixis: Meaning that depends on context\nEvery language includes deictic expressions: words or phrases that change what they refer to every time they\u2019re spoken. The\nmeaning of these phrases depends crucially on who speaks them, and when and where.\n262 10.4 DEIXIS: MEANING THAT DEPENDS ON CONTEXT 263\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/essentialsoflinguistics/?p=514\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWe saw in a previous unit that many words have extensions that can change over time while their intensions 264 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nstay fairly constant. For example, the extension of the phrase the Prime Minister changes every few years, after\nelections. But there are some words whose extensions change all the time, depending on who says the words and\nwhat context they\u2019re in.\nThink about two kids who are fighting over a ball. One kid says, \u201cIt\u2019s mine!\u201d and the other says, \u201cIt\u2019s mine!\u201d Both\nof them are uttering the same words, but they each have a different extension for the meaning of the word mine.\nWhen the tall kid says mine, they mean that the ball belongs to the tall kid. And when the kid with pigtails says\nmine, they mean that the ball belongs to the kid with pigtails.\nThis phenomenon, where a word\u2019s referent changes depending on who says the word, is called deixis, and\nwords or phrases that allow deixis are called deictic expressions.\nIn every language, first-person and second-person pronouns are deictic. Whoever says the word I or me or\nmyself, they\u2019re using the word to refer to themself. And when we utter the word you, we mean the person or people\nwe\u2019re talking to, whoever those people may be. And the first- and second-person possessives are deictic too.\nWhat about third-person pronouns? Is the pronoun she deictic? Let\u2019s look at an example. Suppose Sam says,\n\u201cThe prof said she would give us all A\u2019s.\u201d The pronoun she is ambiguous \u2014 it could refer to any feminine person,\nso it\u2019s possible that Sam means that the prof said that the TA or some other prof would give all A\u2019s, but the likeliest\ninterpretation is that she refers to the prof. Now what happens if Tai says, \u201cThe prof said she would give us all A\u2019s\u201d?\nThe word she is still ambiguous, but in exactly the same ways \u2014 it could still refer to the prof, or it could refer\nto some other feminine person. The potential referent for the word she does not depend on who is uttering the\nsentence, so it\u2019s not a deictic expression.\nSo first- and second-person pronouns and possessives are deictic in every language. But that\u2019s not the only\nplace that deixis happens in language. Lots of languages also have spatial deixis, whose referent depends on the\nlocation of the person who utters them.\nImagine this conversation between Sam and Tai, who live in different cities: Sam lives in Hamilton and Tai lives\nin Toronto. They\u2019ve been talking about getting together on the weekend. Sam says, \u201cAre you coming here this\nweekend?\u201d and Tai replies, \u201cNo, I thought you were coming here!\u201d Both of them utter the word here, but each one\nis referring to a different place \u2014 for Sam, the word here refers to Hamilton, but for Tai, here means Toronto. The\nreferent for the word here depends on the location of the person who says it.\nEnglish has some pairs of deictic expressions that depend on location. Here indicates some relative proximity\nto the speaker, while there means something that is farther away from the speaker. The linguistics labels for\nthis near/far distinction are proximal and distal. The English demonstrative determiners also make a distinction\nbetween proximal and distal: this and these refer to things that are closer to the speaker, and that and those refer\nto things that are farther away. English even has verbs that express this distinction: come and bring refer to moving\ntowards the speaker, while go and take mean moving away from the speaker.\nMany languages make a three-way distinction in spatial deixis. In Spanish, for example, este corresponds roughly\nto English this, while ese and aquel both get translated as that. But aquel is definitely far away, while ese is farther\naway than este but not as far as aquel. This intermediate spatial distinction is labelled medial. Plenty of other\nlanguages, like Arabic and Korean, also have a three-way distinction. In fact, English used to have a proximal-\nmedial-distal distinction as well, with the word yon expressing the distal, but yon has pretty much vanished from\nmodern English.\nLanguages also have ways of expressing temporal deixis. Suppose you go to your prof\u2019s office to ask some\nquestions and you find a note on the door that says, \u201cWorking from home today. I\u2019ll be in the office tomorrow.\u201d\nYou have no way of knowing what day they\u2019re working from home and what day they\u2019ll be in the office unless\nyou know what day the note was written, because today means whatever day they posted the note and tomorrow\nmeans whatever day comes after that day. Yesterday obviously works the same way: its referent is relative to when\nit gets uttered, and the same is true for now and then, soon and later. English also has expressions like three weeks\nago and next year that are deictic too.\nIn fact, even the tense morphology on verbs is deictic. Suppose you get a letter from your aunt in the mail and 10.4 DEIXIS: MEANING THAT DEPENDS ON CONTEXT 265\nit hasn\u2019t got a date on it. It\u2019s a little beat up and it looks like maybe it got lost in the system for a while. The letter\nhas some news about the family and includes the sentence, \u201cAlex will spend the summer planting trees.\u201d Now,\nbecause this sentence has a future tense verb in it, you know that the tree-planting was set to happen some time\nafter the letter was written, but without knowing when the letter was written, you can\u2019t know whether Alex has\nalready planted trees or is still planning to do it in the future or is planting trees right this minute. The time that\nthe future tense refers to depends on when the verb was spoken, or in this case, written.\nTo sum up, every language has deictic words, phrases or expressions that refer to something different\ndepending on who speaks or writes them, and in what context. The most common kinds of deictic expressions are\npersonal, depending on the identity of the speaker, spatial, which depend on where the speaker is when they say\nthe phrase, and temporal, which depend on the time the speaker says the phrase. 10.5 Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle\nBRONWYN BJORKMAN\nIn talking about the meaning of phrases and sentences, so far we\u2019ve focused on the literal meaning of words and\nmorphemes\u2014their denotations\u2014and how those literal meanings compose with one another in predictable ways. The study\nof these types of meaning is the domain of semantics. But there are other aspects of meaning that can\u2019t be studied or\nunderstood in these terms, things we communicate not with the literal meanings of our words and how they\u2019re arranged, but\ninstead by the way we choose to say them, or the social context of our communication. These types of meanings are the domain\nof pragmatics, the study of meaning in its social or communicative context.\nProbably all of us have had the experience of having our words misinterpreted, or taken \u201cout of context\u201d. This\noften happens even if someone definitely understood our literal words \u2014 they may simply have misread our\nintentions or goals. This type of misunderstanding is precisely the kind of thing we might investigate in pragmatics\n\u2014 both what we intend to communicate, and how someone else might interpret our communications.\nIn this unit we focus on one particular type of pragmatic reasoning, the the calculation of conversational\nimplicatures on the basis of what are known as Gricean Maxims\u2014these maxims were proposed by the\nphilosopher H.P. Grice in a (1975) paper that proposed that in conversation we adopt a Cooperative Principle\nwhen interpreting what people say.\nTERMINOLOGY: ENTAILMENT, PRESUPPOSITION, AND IMPLICATURE\nBefore discussing the Cooperative Principle and the individual maxims, let\u2019s introduce some terminology that\nwill help us talk about the logical relationships between sentences\u2014the different ways in which we can draw\nconclusions.\nConsider the following pair of sentences:\n\u2022 Jennice and Alice have both read War and Peace.\n\u2022 Jennice has read War and Peace.\n266 10.5 PRAGMATICS AND THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE 267\nIf the first of these sentences is true, the second one also has to be true! Put another way, if the second sentence\nis false, then the first sentence is also definitely false. This is the relationship of entailment.\nEntailment\nFor two propositions (i.e. things that can be true or false) P and Q, P entails Q if whenever P is true, Q must\nalso be true.\nEntailment is technically a semantic relationship rather than a pragmatic one, but it\u2019s useful to have it in mind to\ncontrast two other relationships with: presupposition and implicature.\nConsider next the following two sentences:\n\u2022 Nadim\u2019s brother is visiting.\n\u2022 Nadim has a brother.\nThis might seem to be another case of entailment, but it works a little bit differently. If the first sentence is true,\nthe second one also has to be true. But if the second one is false\u2014if Nadim doesn\u2019t have a brother\u2014then it\u2019s not\njust that the first sentence is false, it seems like we can\u2019t even really interpret the first sentence. Here we say that\nthe first sentence presupposes the second one.\nHere\u2019s another pair of sentences where the first sentence presupposes the second one:\n\u2022 Lou stopped smoking.\n\u2022 Lou used to smoke.\nIf someone asks you Have you stopped smoking in the last year? and you never smoked, you couldn\u2019t answer \u201cyes\u201d\nor \u201cno\u201d\u2014instead you might say \u201cHey, wait a minute! I never smoked!\u201d This temptation to say something like Hey\nwait a minute! is a sign of a presupposition that isn\u2019t satisfied.\nPresupposition\nFor two propositions P and Q, P presupposes Q if Q has to be true for P\u2019s truth or falsity to be evaluated.\nFinally this brings us to implicature, which is the relationship most relevant for our discussion of Gricean maxims.\nConsider a final pair of sentences:\n\u2022 Marie has two cats.\n\u2022 Marie has exactly two cats.\nIf someone said to you \u201cI have two pet cats.\u201d, in most contexts you would assume that they didn\u2019t have 10 cats\u2014if\nit turned out that they did have 10 cats, you\u2019d feel that they\u2019d misled you somehow. But there\u2019s nothing about the\nfirst sentence in the pair above that logically entails that Marie doesn\u2019t have more than two cats.\nGrice (1975) introduced the term implicature for the relationship between the first and second sentences in\nthis pair.\nImplicature\nFor two propositions P and Q, P implicates Q if a listener would infer Q on the basis of someone saying P,\ndespite P not entailing or presupposing Q.\nImplicatures, unlike presuppositions or entailments, are cancellable\u2014that is, you can negate them without\ncontradicting yourself or saying something infelicitous.\n\u2022 Marie has two cats, but (in fact) she has ten cats. (implicature \u2192 cancellable)\n\u2022 #Lou stopped smoking, but they didn\u2019t used to smoke. (presupposition \u2192 not cancellable)\n\u2022 #Nadim\u2019s brother is visiting, but Nadim doesn\u2019t have a brother. (presupposition \u2192 not cancellable)\n\u2022 #Jennice and Alice have both read War and Peace, but Jennice hasn\u2019t read War and Peace. (entailment \u2192 268 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nnot cancellable)\nGrice distinguished two types of implicatures:\n\u2022 Conventional implicatures: triggered by specific words\n\u2022 Conversational implicatures: calculated based on the Cooperative Principle / specific maxims\nWe will be mostly concerned with conversational implicatures. Just for illustration, though, an example of a\nword that triggers a conventional implicature in English is the coordinator but. Consider the contrast between the\nfollowing two sentences:\n\u2022 Ruowen likes chocolate ice cream and Helen likes vanilla ice cream.\n\u2022 Ruowen likes chocolate ice cream but Helen likes vanilla ice cream.\nLogically speaking, both and and but mean the same thing\u2014both of these sentences are true only if it\u2019s true that\nRuowen likes chocolate ice cream AND true that Helen likes vanilla ice cream.\nGrice observed that the coordinator but implies that there\u2019s a contrast between the two clauses, though, or that\nit\u2019s somehow surprising to assert the second one. This is the conventional implicature of using but instead of and.\nGRICEAN MAXIMS AND THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE\nWhat are we trying to do when we have a conversation with someone? There probably isn\u2019t any one thing that\nwe\u2019re always trying to do, but often part of what we\u2019re trying to do is exchange information.\nSome of the things we communicate are not part of the logical or literal meaning of our words. For example,\nconsider the following exchange (adapted from Grice 1975):\n\u2022 A: How does your friend like working at the bank?\n\u2022 B: Oh, pretty well. They like their colleagues, and they haven\u2019t been sent to prison yet.\nWhat does B mean by saying their friend hasn\u2019t been sent to prison yet? They could mean a number of things:\nmaybe B is given to telling jokes, or maybe they mean that their friend isn\u2019t usually trustworthy, or maybe they\nmean that if you didn\u2019t like working at a bank you\u2019d steal money.\nThe actual meaning conveyed will depend on the context: what A and B both know, their relationship to one\nanother and to B\u2019s friend, and other factors. Whatever B means, though, it\u2019s clear that by saying \u201cthey haven\u2019t been\nsent to prison yet\u201d, B is conveying something more than just the literal meaning of their words! Many many people\nhaven\u2019t been to prison! Why is B bringing it up?\nThe meaning conveyed by a utterance based on these kinds of considerations is its conversational\nimplicature: implicatures that arise from the structure of discourse or conversation, based on our understanding\nof how communication works.\nConversational implicatures arise in the context of a general Cooperative Principle for communication. The\nidea of this principle is that we assume, when we speak to people, that we are working towards a common goal (or\ncommon goals), and we can interpret what people say in light of that. So in the mini dialogue above, A can assume\nthat there was some reason that B mentioned that their friend hadn\u2019t been sent to prison yet\u2014they didn\u2019t simply\nadd a true but irrelevant statement to the conversation for no reason!\nUnder the general heading of the Cooperative Principle, there are four more specific maxims that Grice\nproposed:\n1. Maxim of Quantity 10.5 PRAGMATICS AND THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE 269\n2. Maxim of Quality\n3. Maxim of Relation\n4. Maxim of Manner\nIn the following sections we will review how each of these maxims works when it is successful, before turning\nto two ways in which someone can fail to follow the maxims in conversation: either by violating a maxim or by\nflouting one.\nIf we violate a maxim, then we simply fail to follow it. At best, violating a maxim results in being a confusing or\nuncooperative conversationalist. At worst, violating a maxim involves lying or being intentionally misleading.\nIf we flout a maxim, by contrast, we blatantly fail to follow it\u2014we aim to communicate something precisely by\nmaking it very obvious that we have chosen not to follow the cooperative principle, and trusting that our audience\nwill draw the intended conclusions.\nMAXIM OF QUANTITY\nThe maxim of quantity states:\n\u2022 Make your contribution as informative as is required.\n\u2022 Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.\nTo follow this maxim, we make the strongest claim that\u2019s both compatible with the facts and relevant in context.\nFor example, consider the following conversation:\n\u2022 A: Does Elspeth have any siblings?\n\u2022 B: Yes, she has a sister.\nWhen hearing B\u2019s response, A assumes that B is fully answering the question\u2014that is, that B is being as informative\nas possible. So A would naturally assume that Elspeth has exactly one sister, and doesn\u2019t have any brothers.\nIf it turned out that Elspeth has two sisters and a brother, A would feel that B had misled them\u2014this would be\nan example of violating the maxim of quantity.\nChanging the context can change how we calculate this implicature, though. Suppose that A needs to borrow a\ncar in order to run an errand, and the following conversation ensues:\n\u2022 A: Does Elspeth have a car I could borrow?\n\u2022 B: Yes, she has a car.\nIn this context A will conclude that Elspeth has at least one car. Even if it turns out that Elspeth has two cars, A\nwon\u2019t feel like B misled them\u2014because the second sub-maxim above says that you shouldn\u2019t be more informative\nthan a conversation requires, and in the relevant context all A needs to know is whether there\u2019s a car they can\nborrow.\nFlouting the maxim of quantity can be done in a few different ways! Grice gives the example of a reference\nletter for a job as a Philosophy professor that says, in its entirety:\n1\n\u2022 \u201cDear Sir, Mr. X\u2019s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular.\nYours, etc.\u201d (p. 52)\n1\n1. 270 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nThis letter is ostentatiously much shorter than a reference letter would usually be, and so gives rise to the\nimplicature that there is nothing else that the writer can say about Mr. X that would be positive.\nA possibly more subtle example of flouting the maxim of quantity might be something like the following:\n\u2022 Student: When is Assignment 2 due?\n\u2022 Professor: You can find that information in the syllabus, which is posted on the course website.\nIn this exchange, the professor hasn\u2019t actually provided an answer to the student\u2019s question\u2014in that sense it is\nan uncooperative response. The professor intends to communicate that the student should be able to answer\ntheir own question on the basis of information available to them. (The professor\u2019s response probably also involves\nflouting the maxim of relevance, since they have not directly answered the question asked.)\nMAXIM OF QUALITY\nThe maxim of quality states:\n\u2022 Do not say what you believe to be false.\n\u2022 Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.\nIn some ways the first of these points is the most basic maxim for the Cooperative Principle: communicating in\ngood faith seems to require that we are\u2014or at least try to be\u2014truthful.\nThe second point\u2014don\u2019t say that for which you lack adequate evidence\u2014is a bit harder to judge, and what\ncounts as \u201cadequate evidence\u201d varies a great deal from context to context.\nViolating the maxim of quality involves lying\u2014intentionally saying things that are untrue\u2014or else saying things\nthat you don\u2019t have enough evidence for.\nIf your housemate asks you what day garbage is being collected this week, and you can\u2019t really remember\nbut you think it might be Tuesday or Wednesday, you would be violating the maxim of quality if you confidently\nreplied: \u201cGarbage pickup is definitely Wednesday this week.\u201d\nFlouting the maxim of quality usually involves irony or sarcasm. For example, consider the following mini-\ndialogue between a child on a road-trip and their parent:\n\u2022 Child, asking for the 20th time: Are we there yet?\n\u2022 Parent, fed up with answering: Nope, we\u2019re just going to keep driving in this car for the rest of our\nlives.\nIn this case the parent doesn\u2019t intend their child to take their words literally; they\u2019re flouting the maxim of quality\nto convey an implicature that the question was unwelcome.\nMetaphors or idioms are also cases of flouting the maxim of quality! If I say a scarf is as light as a feather, this is\nnot literally true\u2014but I don\u2019t intend for it to be taken as true!\nMAXIM OF RELEVANCE\nThe maxim of relevance states:\n\u2022 Be relevant.\nThe idea behind this maxim is that when we converse, we shouldn\u2019t introduce irrelevant topics\u2014we try to stick to\nthe topic of conversation, and we assume that our contributions will be interpreted in that light. 10.5 PRAGMATICS AND THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE 271\nConsider the following exchange:\n\u2022 A: Are you visiting family this weekend?\n\u2022 B: I have a term paper due on Monday.\nA natural interpretation of this exchange is that B is saying that they do not plan to visit family this weekend, and\nthat the reason is that they have to work instead.\nBut this interpretation is an implicature, because if we think only about the literal meaning of B\u2019s words, this\ninterpretation is a bit mysterious\u2014B doesn\u2019t actually directly answer A\u2019s question, but introduces new topic that\ndoesn\u2019t have anything to do with travel or families.\nIf we assume that B does intend to be relevant, though, we can explain the implicature: for the term paper to be\nrelevant to the question about travel, it must be that working on the paper controls whether B is able to travel to\nvisit family.\nIndeed, suppose we know that B finds it easier to write term papers at home for some reason. In that case\nwe might interpret their statement above as meaning that they do plan to visit family. This illustrates the type of\ncontext dependency that\u2019s typical of conversational implicatures!\nViolating the maxim of relevance means making irrelevant contributions. You might do this because you\u2019re\nabsent-minded, or because you aren\u2019t actually paying attention to what the other person is talking about, but you\ncan also violate the maxim of relevance more subtly. Consider a slightly different dialogue:\n\u2022 C: Are you free to hang out this weekend?\n\u2022 D: I have a term paper due on Monday.\nImagine this dialogue uttered in a context where D does actually have time to hang out, but for whatever reason\ndoesn\u2019t want to spend time with C. Assuming D does have a term paper due on Monday (and therefore is\nnot violating the maxim of Quality), their response would violate relevance: they\u2019re saying something true but\nirrelevant, in the hopes that C will draw the (incorrect) implicature that D doesn\u2019t have time to hang out because\nof the time needed to work on the term paper.\nFlouting the maxim of relevance involves saying something obviously irrelevant, often to communicate that you\nwant to change the topic of conversation.\nFor example, if a conversation starts getting awkward and you interject by saying: \u201cHow about that hockey game\nlast night?\u201d (when nobody had been talking about sports, never mind about hockey), then you would be flouting\nthe maxim of relevance in the hopes that your audience would understand that you were trying to convey: \u201cCan\nwe please talk about something, anything, else?\u201d\nMAXIM OF MANNER\nThe maxim of manner states:\n\u2022 Avoid obscurity of expression. (That is, don\u2019t use words or phrases that are hard to understand.)\n\u2022 Avoid ambiguity.\n\u2022 Be brief.\n\u2022 Be orderly.\nThis relates not to the content of what you say, but the way you express yourself.\nIt is easiest to discuss each of these sub-maxims in turn, because they have slightly different effect in\nconversation. 272 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nAvoid obscurity of expression\nTo follow this maxim, we try to use words and expressions that our audience understands. For example, the\nterminology you would use when explaining a topic in a university class is different from the terminology you\u2019d\nuse if talking about the same thing to a Grade 1 class!\nViolating this sub-maxim involves using words and phrases your audience doesn\u2019t know. We often do this\naccidentally\u2014for example, your linguistics professor might accidentally use a grammatical term that they haven\u2019t\ndefined in class\u2014but if you use a word that you suspect your audience will misinterpret, with the goal of\nmisleading your audience, that would also be a violation of this sub-maxim.\nFlouting this sub-maxim would involve intentionally using words that you don\u2019t expect your audience to\nunderstand\u2014in most contexts, this would be with the goal of conveying something like: \u201cI\u2019m smarter / know more\nthan you do\u201d, which is pretentious and rude.\nAvoid ambiguity\nTo follow this sub-maxim, we try to avoid saying things that can reasonably be interpreted in more than one way.\nIt\u2019s very easy to violate this sub-maxim accidentally, because often you don\u2019t see the ambiguity in something\nyou say until it\u2019s pointed out to you! But again, you can be intentionally ambiguous in the hopes of misleading\npeople\u2014this is an uncooperative way of talking.\nFlouting this sub-maxim often happens in certain kinds of jokes, as in the following:\n\u2022 A man walks into a bar. Ouch!\nThis joke turns on two things: 1. being familiar with the common joke set up: \u201cSomeone walks into a bar.\u201d and 2.\nintentionally using the other meaning of the ambiguous word bar.\nBe brief\nTo follow this sub-maxim, we avoid going on at great length when a shorter statement would do.\nViolating this sub-maxim involves saying or writing something much longer than is needed.\nFlouting this maxim is more subtle. One example is avoiding a single word and instead using a long paraphrase,\nas in:\n\u2022 What did you have for dinner last night?\n\u2022 Well, we combined all the ingredients listed in a recipe for risotto milanese, in the indicated order, and\nthe result was edible.\nBy using this long paraphrase, instead of saying \u201cWe made risotto milanese.\u201d, the second speaker\u2019s response gives\nrise to the implicature that the recipe didn\u2019t turn out as intended, or wasn\u2019t very good.\nBe orderly\nTo follow this sub-maxim, we list or relate things in an order that makes sense. For example, when telling a story,\nwe usually start at the beginning and then relate events in the order they happened in.\nViolating this sub-maxim can be very confusing, as you\u2019ll know if you\u2019ve ever had to interrupt someone for\nclarification about the order of events in a story they\u2019re telling!\nFlouting this sub-maxim is not something we would do very often. A possible example might be intentionally 10.5 PRAGMATICS AND THE COOPERATIVE PRINCIPLE 273\nrelating events out of order when writing a fictional story, to convey something about the mood or the narrator\u2019s\nstate of mind.\nREFERENCES\nGrice, H.

Discuss,\nbriefly, what features make something a prototypical vehicle. What features do the peripheral members have (or\nnot have) that make them less prototypical?\n274 Summary\nIn this chapter, we examined the different ways that the meanings of words might be represented in the mind.\nEvidence from psycholinguistics tells us that prototypes play a role in the organization of our intensions, since\nwords that refer to prototypical things are accessed more quickly than words that refer to peripheral things.\nThrough our experience of encountering various extensions in the world (that is, various exemplars that belong\nto categories), our minds build up intensions for word meanings. These intensions allow us to categorize new\nexemplars that we encounter.\n275  CHAPTER 11: INDIGENOUS\nLANGUAGES\nAs unit 11.1 shows, Canada\u2019s settler government has, for decades, engaged in deliberate strategies to eliminate\nthe languages spoken by Indigenous peoples. Indigenous people have been working for years to try to preserve\ntheir languages by increasing the number of people who can speak them, and since the 2015 report of the\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission, the federal government has more openly acknowledged the importance of\nthese efforts. People with Linguistics training can play a valuable role in language preservation and revitalization\nefforts, by helping to document the language and by contributing to the development of teaching materials for\nthe languages.\nBy the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll be able to:\n\u2022 understand the role that the settler government played in endangering Indigenous languages,\n\u2022 understand the importance of language to Indigenous people\u2019s identity, and\n\u2022 consider the skills that linguists have to offer to Indigenous people\u2019s work to preserve and revitalize their\nlanguages.\n277  11.1 Indigenous Languages and the Legacy of Residential\nSchools\nMany of the Indigenous languages spoken in what is currently Canada are quite endangered, because of deliberate\nstrategies by the settler government. For over 100 years, children from Indigenous communities were forced to attend\nresidential schools where they were severely punished for speaking their home languages. The consequence was that fewer\nand fewer Indigenous people were able to maintain fluency in their languages.\n279 280 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=223\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nA lot of our attention so far has focused on English, which is convenient because it\u2019s a language that we all know,\nbut we can learn a lot about mental grammar by looking at other languages. Canada has an incredibly rich\nand diverse history of languages that were spoken by Aboriginal peoples long before European settlers arrived.\nLinguists estimate that there were more than two hundred different Indigenous languages spoken in this region,\nand these languages were quite different from each other \u2014 they formed about 15 different language families.\nAt the time of the 2016 census in Canada, there were still about two hundred and thirteen thousand people\nspeaking about 64 different Indigenous languages from 12 different language families. Some of these languages,\nlike Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibwe, are quite healthy, with thousands of speakers. But many more Indigenous\nlanguages are critically endangered \u2014 they have only a few hundred or a few dozen speakers who are quite\nelderly. When those speakers die, the language could die with them.\nWhy have so many of the Aboriginal languages been lost? It\u2019s tempting to attribute it to economic and cultural 11.1 INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES AND THE LEGACY OF RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS 281\npressures \u2014 TV shows and books and music are all in English, and everyone wants to speak English to get a job\n\u2014 but it\u2019s not as simple as that. From the time that European settlers first arrived in this region, they engaged in\ndeliberate strategies to try to eliminate First Nations people and their culture and language. The settlers engaged\nin war with the Indigenous people and brought new germs that caused devastating epidemics. The Europeans\ntook over fertile land to grow their own crops and forced Indigenous people to live in small, confined reserves that\ncould not sustain the crops to feed their people.\nAnd these strategies aren\u2019t just from hundreds of years ago: between the 1960s and the late 1980s, the\nCanadian government seized thousands of Aboriginal children from their homes and placed them forcibly in\nfoster homes and adoptive homes largely with white families, which meant that the children did not learn their\nparents\u2019 language. This forced adoption is sometimes called the \u201csixties scoop\u201d, and it continued the tradition of\nthe residential schools.\nThe residential school system existed in Canada for more than 100 years, and the last residential school closed\nin 1996, not very long ago. Aboriginal children were taken from their families and forced to live in quite appalling\nconditions in schools that were run by the government and by the churches. The person who initiated the system\nwas Sir John A Macdonald, Canada\u2019s first prime minister. He was quite clear that the whole purpose of taking\nchildren from their families was to make sure that they grew up without knowledge of their history, language, and\nculture. Here\u2019s his attitude about children who grow up in their families and communities:\n\u201cWhen the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages,\nand though he may learn to read and write, his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply\na savage who can read and write.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s what his plan was:\n\u201cIndian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence, and the only way to do\nthat would be to put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of\nthought of white men.\u201d\nHe was completely open about his goals: he wanted Aboriginal children to stop thinking and speaking in the\nways they learned in their families and communities, and to start thinking and speaking like white men.\nIn 2015, Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its report, after years of consulting with survivors\nof residential schools. The executive summary begins this way:\n\u201cThese residential schools were created for the purpose of separating Aboriginal children from their families,\nin order to minimize and weaken family ties and cultural linkages, and to indoctrinate children into a new\nculture\u2014the culture of the legally dominant Euro-Christian Canadian society.\u201d\nThe TRC\u2019s Calls to Action acknowledge the crucial role that Indigenous languages will play in achieving\nreconciliation between Aboriginal people and the larger Canadian population. Here are just some of the Calls to\nAction.\n\u2022 We call on the federal government to draft new Aboriginal education legislation including protecting the\nright to Aboriginal languages [and] the teaching of Aboriginal languages as credit courses.\n\u2022 We call upon the federal government to enact an Aboriginal Languages Act that incorporates the\nfollowing principles:\n\u2022 Aboriginal languages are a fundamental and valued element of Canadian culture and society, and there\nis an urgency to preserve them.\n\u2022 The federal government has a responsibility to provide sufficient funds for Aboriginal-language\nrevitalization and preservation.\n\u2022 The preservation, revitalization, and strengthening of Aboriginal languages and cultures are best\nmanaged by Aboriginal people and communities. 282 CATHERINE ANDERSON\n\u2022 Funding for Aboriginal language initiatives must reflect the diversity of Aboriginal languages.\n\u2022 We call upon post-secondary institutions to create university and college degree and diploma programs\nin Aboriginal languages.\nSo there is a need for language preservation, revitalization and teaching. What can linguists do to help with these\nefforts? Of course the most important thing is to work with Aboriginal communities, to listen to the community\nmembers and find out from them what they think would be most valuable.\nSome linguists have helped to document Indigenous languages, recording and transcribing speech and stories\nfrom native speakers. This is especially crucial when the speakers are elderly and the language is critically\nendangered. Documenting a language also involves doing phonological, morphological and syntactic analysis to\nbe able to write grammar books and dictionaries for the language. Some linguists have also helped to develop\nwriting systems for languages that didn\u2019t have any written form. If a language has been documented, then linguists\ncan help to create educational resources and curriculum material that language teachers can use, and can help to\ntrain language teachers. 11.2 Preserving Mohawk\nThe next several units are excerpts from a conversation with David Kanatawakhon-Maracle, a Mohawk instructor at Western\nUniversity. In this unit, Dr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle talks about how, for a language to survive, it must be widely spoken.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=225\n283 284 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nI\u2019ve been a language teacher for years, you know, and trying to teach and there\u2019s always been this segment of\npeople out there who \u201creally support what you\u2019re doing\u201d and stuff like that and I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of just\nignoring them because their support is verbal; they\u2019re not in my classes; they\u2019re not learning the language. Real\nsupport for an Aboriginal language is getting out there and learning that language and learning to speak it, you\nknow, so, to help bring that language back into its own. I don\u2019t expect any community to work towards, you know,\nsole monolingualism \u2014 that\u2019s that\u2019s just not doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 however, bilingualism is a fairly normal way to\nbe with a large percentage of the world\u2019s population. And, and, for, you know, my grandparents, my grandfather\nwas bilingual, you know, and my great-grandparents were bilingual and they could use English when they needed\nto and they used Mohawk when they needed to and, or by choice or whatever.\nI speak Mohawk and English so the thing is I can also, you know, use both languages. I \u2026 the difference I guess\nis that I also read and write Mohawk as well. So I\u2019m a speaker and I\u2019m literate which is the sort of thing that we\nwould want to teach students especially at the university level because there\u2019s a lot of stuff written in Aboriginal\nlanguages that are presently not available in English or, you know or probably doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be\navailable in English if they\u2019re speakers of the language.\nPeople have always said you know, \u201cOh yeah, we know that the language should be in the home.\u201d No! The\nlanguage should be in the street! If the language is surviving \u2014 if the language is truly an important part of being\n\u2014 it\u2019s in the street; it\u2019s in the stores; it\u2019s outside of the home. When you keep the language in the home it dies,\nbecause the speakers of the language eventually leave that home and then they go into the street where they\u2019re\nspeaking English all the time and they meet somebody else who is also speaking English and eventually \u2026 the next\ngeneration is being raised by two English-speaking people and of course then the language is, is gone.\n[CA: Would you say that that attitude that says \u201coh the language is for at home,\u201d is that, is that another\nlegacy of colonialism where it was shameful to speak an Aboriginal language?]\nYeah well let\u2019s keep it.\n[CA: Yeah, it\u2019s private, but not outside the house.]\nYeah and the real problem is that when when the language is only spoken in the home especially in\ncontemporary society where people are, spending more and more time at home in front of some sort of technical\ndevice \u2014 in times past they were out going from home to home and all people were speaking the language and\nvisiting and the language is very much alive \u2014 but once it becomes ensconced within the home and people get to\nthe point where, sure they can talk to their parents, but they can\u2019t really understand their neighbours. 11.3 Learning Mohawk\nSome Mohawk people have learned to speak Mohawk by growing up among fluent speakers. Many others are trying to learn\nto speak Mohawk in school or in university. Having some knowledge of linguistics can make learning a second language easier\nin some ways.\n285 286 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=227\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nOne of the things about language is \u2014 I understand Mohawk and I speak Mohawk because I\u2019ve heard hundreds of\npeople speaking it.\n[CA: Right. So that\u2019s how you learned it, was growing up in the community where it was spoken?]\nYeah I basically grew up with Mohawk and English and as I got to be a teenager I spent a lot more time with\nthe older folks because they were more inclined to be speakers. Also, I find old people a lot more entertaining\nthan younger adults, you know, they no longer have the sort of worries that, and the stress, that younger people\nhave. And the stories, I mean, the really funny thing is that I find with older people, with the old folks, they\u2019re\nnot very trusting, you know you basically have to visit them a lot before you kind of crack that shell and you get\naccess to, to what they what they know. And I suppose to a certain degree that\u2019s self-serving but at the same\ntime these people have got, they\u2019ve got tradition to pass on; their responsibility is to be passing on this stuff and if\nthey\u2019ve decided that well nobody wants to hear that you know and so they stop telling it then it, it dies with them.\nSo I found that spending a lot of time with the older folks you hear a lot of stories.\nAnd the funny thing too about, one of the things that I found with the language is they were a lot more fun\nin Mohawk than they were in English. They get cranky and grumpy and unhappy when they speak English and I\ndon\u2019t know why because, it just, I had an uncle used to visit and, well, boy I mean this he had a complaint about\neverything he had a gripe about everything and stuff and it always seemed to be so grating in English but when\nhe was speaking Mohawk we spent a lot more time laughing. Because that was the language of his childhood and\nthat was how he grew up and he\u2019s, you know, he would tell stories from that time where it\u2019s often you know were,\nwere a lot more amusing or a lot more interesting than what he was having to deal with presently in English.\nI\u2019ve had students that have come in that have taken a number of years in the immersion program at Six Nations.\nThey seem to have a sense of the language but they\u2019re not speakers. The course that I teach right now is a fairly\nheavy grammar-based course because I find that if I mean you can you can learn all the vocabulary you want, but\nif you have no sense of the grammar of the language, how are you going to utilize that vocabulary? What are you\ngonna do with it? And the thing is that the students that have come in that have some language, they know a\nlot of vocabulary\u2026 can\u2019t do a thing with it! They know how to say expressions; they know dialogues; they know\na whole lot of things that I find is, okay, great, so you at least know the pronunciation, which is a good place to\nstart. Anglophones can\u2019t get past what they see written. \u201cWell, but that\u2019s a \u2018t\u2019 it\u2019s written as a \u2018t\u2019.\u201d I says yeah, it\u2019s\npronounced [d].\n[CA: And here\u2019s where, actually, thinking of my students the having a bit of Introduction to Linguistics\nwould help to say, well, look, this is a, this is an allophone and it\u2019s voiced in these circumstances and\nvoiceless here, someone who has Intro Linguistics might get that.]\nYup. I had students who will comment on the fact that they\u2019ve taken a linguistics course and it has helped their\npronunciation it does make them more aware of it. [\u2026] 11.4 Mohawk Culture and Language\nIn this unit, Dr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle mentions some of the elements of Mohawk culture that are embedded in the\ngrammar of the language, and we discuss the idea that living languages are always changing.\n287 288 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=229\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nWhat I also do too is that I include culture with the language. I\u2019ll be teaching them a particular word or phrase or\nexpression but then I\u2019ll tell them where it comes from \u2014 why it is this way \u2014 why we say it that way \u2014 why we\ndon\u2019t say this word. I mean, the word nyaweh in Mohawk gets interpreted as \u2018thank you\u2019 in English but that\u2019s kind of\nthe beginning and the end of it. We don\u2019t, the reality is, if you follow older tradition, which is the way I was raised,\nyou don\u2019t say nyaweh for every little thing; you don\u2019t use it the way it\u2019s used in English. In English it\u2019s just thank\nyou thank you thank you \u2014 it becomes meaningless; it becomes a grunt, quite literally, in the English language,\nbecause people just use it so freely that it starts to lose its meaning. In Mohawk, nyaweh is used, or should only be\nused, between yourself and the Creator even when you say nyaweh, you know you see something beautiful, you\nsee a sunset, a beautiful flower, nice majestic scenery or whatever, stuff like that, then you say nyaweh because\nnow that nyaweh is directed towards the Creator and it\u2019s showing appreciation for what you\u2019re dealing with. When\nwe sit at the table and we eat, the first one that gets up says nyaweh, not for the food, you know, but for, for the\nopportunity to sit with other people and share food. We\u2019re getting into the habit of using it much the same way\nit\u2019s used in English \u2014 you\u2019ll hear young, young speakers, more contemporary ones that are using or learning the\nlanguage, they\u2019ll use nyaweh the same way they do and I said, No! (laughter).\n[CA: Well I wonder, is there, is there a tension there that, so, on the one hand, you want to honour the traditions and\nthe things you\u2019ve learned from the Elders and from the older people and, on the other hand for a language to stay alive\nit has to change, right? Is that, so, if people are changing the language some, it\u2019s because it\u2019s still a living language\u2026]\nI don\u2019t know \u2014 there are certain things that we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to change, that we don\u2019t particularly want\nto update because then it starts to erode our uniqueness. If you\u2019re going to speak Mohawk the way you speak\nEnglish, why don\u2019t you just speak English? You can update certain things but other things you can\u2019t. Like negating\na future situation \u2014 in English, you can say, \u201cOh, it will not snow today!\u201d How presumptive you are! (laughter)\nBecause, just because the sky is blue, but there\u2019s a cloud and you know the clouds \u2014 if there\u2019s one cloud there\u2019s\nanother cloud and another cloud and another cloud and by the end of the day we could see snow, which is all\nwithin the realm of the \u201cwill\u201d because the \u201cwill\u201d is in the in future. We cannot negate the future.\n[CA: So that\u2019s, so that\u2019s a cultural attitude that shows up in the grammar of Mohawk? That you don\u2019t\nuse negation with the future?]\nYou can construct a negative future. Nobody does. Fluent speakers don\u2019t. I mean, why would you? You know,\nbecause it interferes\u2026 We have other ways of kind of getting around it right but \u2026 most people just wouldn\u2019t. You\njust would not say, \u201cit will not snow.\u201d We can create what amounts to it, a negative sort of thing and we use it with\nthe non-definite, which is like saying \u201cit would not\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s a possibility that it won\u2019t\u201d It would not\u2026 but the thing\nis that you cannot directly say, \u201cit *will* not\u201d so we go to a very fuzzy sort of a non-definite situation and we negate\nthat. Cheating in a way but at the same time, it is an important cultural part of the language. I mean, the fact that\nyou have a culture that that doesn\u2019t negate the future \u2014 they deal with the future in a different sort of way \u2014 so\nthose sorts of things, I think they have to be kept in language because they are the sort of things that add to the\nuniqueness of a particular language. 11.4 MOHAWK CULTURE AND LANGUAGE 289\nWord order in Mohawk. English has a set word order: subject-verb-object. Mohawk\u2026 Mohawk\u2019s word order is,\nis quite literally whatever comes out of your mouth. What joins it all together are pronominal prefixes and that\nworks. But because the pronunciation of Mohawk, the pronunciation of a word in Mohawk is set; however, due\nto the situation in which that word may occur within, within a statement or sentence, the accent on that word\nmay shift. So okay fine, so if I say kahiat\u00f3nhsera for \u201cbook\u201d then the accent is on t\u00f3n. Kahiat\u00f3nhsera, okay fine,\nbut if I say kahiatonhser\u00e1ke, \u201con the book\u201d that accent shifted to the penultimate syllable. So accent shifts on a\nword depending upon where that word occurs. English is a language blessed with one or two syllable words which\nactually puts English speakers in an odd situation since most of them seem to have a hard time pronouncing a\nword that has more than one, more than two syllables, (laughter) which makes my name really hard for them, \u201cOh,\nKanatawakhon, oh, I can\u2019t say that!\u201d It\u2019s worse if they see it written.\nBut the thing is, in Mohawk, word organization, word position is dependent on emphasis, so if I want to say, \u201cThe\nboy is walking on the road,\u201d what am I saying?\n\u201cThe BOY is walking on the road?\u201d \u201craks\u00e1:\u2019a ire ohah\u00e1ke\u201c.\nor am I saying,\n\u201cThe boy is WALKING on the road\u201d? \u201cire raks\u00e1:\u2019a ohah\u00e1ke\u201c.\nOr am I saying,\n\u201cThe boy is walking on the ROAD\u201d? \u201cohah\u00e1ke ire raks\u00e1:\u2019a\u201c.\nSo I shift my words around, there\u2019s actually six arrangements of that, the three words and it\u2019s all depending\non, on emphasis. Also dependent upon if you\u2019re answering a question. Because, \u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d \u201cA COAT I\nbought.\u201d Because the question what is asking, is asking for information which is then placed first which puts it in an\nemphasized position. That\u2019s a very important part of the uniqueness of a language. So there are three very unique\nthings with the language that we don\u2019t want to, we can\u2019t lose by modernizing it or contemporizing it. The language\nis set.\nThe culture that goes with the language \u2026 if you stop using a stone axe then eventually the word for stone\naxe is going to disappear unless for some reason \u2026 And then some vocabulary we\u2019ve created in the past that\nwe\u2019ve carried through into the future like oh\u00e1hsera, \u201ca light\u201d now is used primarily in reference to artificial lighting\nbut originally it referred to something that looked very much like this bone oh\u00e1hsa with the \u2013ra suffix so then\noh\u00e1hsera just kind of gives the impression or gives the appearance of this particular bone and if you look at that\nbone and you look like a candle \u2014 yeah \u2014 so the thing is so we called the candles oh\u00e1hsera, then lamps showed\nup. Well, more or less the same shape, oh\u00e1hsera. Then lights, lamps, you know, living room lamps and stuff showed\nup, okay, oh\u00e1hsera. Nowadays oh\u00e1hsera refers to anything that throws artificial light, you know, ceiling lights, wall\nlights, the whole bit. So that is a word that has followed through time because even though we had your basic\napplication but the shape kept changing.\n[CA: That\u2019s a natural semantic drift that happens in most languages\u2026]\nYeah. 11.5 Creating Materials for Teaching Mohawk\nDr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle has developed his Mohawk textbooks and exercises over his many years of teaching Mohawk,\nbut when he started teaching, there were very few books or materials available. In this unit, we talk about the kind of linguistics\nwork that can be helpful in creating textbooks and other teaching materials.\n290 11.5 CREATING MATERIALS FOR TEACHING MOHAWK 291\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=231\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nOver the years I\u2019ve been teaching Mohawk since \u201991 \u2026 \u201990-91 and I wanted to, I initially taught the course here,\ngot the opportunity to teach the course because I wanted to see if the text material that I had developed for a\nlanguage course would actually work. So I had developed a textbook and we used it the first year in that language\ncourse \u2014 mmmyeah, it did \u2014 as I modified it and I did things to it. That one sitting there that\u2019s the most recent\nwithin the last five years. There is an audio that goes with that on a USB stick. That\u2019s just the teaching text; there\u2019s\nanother one that\u2019s called Supplements and it\u2019s divided into ten, ten supplement areas, where you\u2019ve got everything\nabout numbers, everything about locations, everything about\u2026 And it\u2019s equally as thick as that\u2026\nAnd then the band council back home, they finally got the opportunity to offer the Mohawk language in the\npublic school there, so they wanted me to come home and teach it because I was quite literally the youngest\nspeaker there and we didn\u2019t have a lot of old folks in the community to draw on. So I said okay fine, I\u2019ll, well I went\nback home and of course they said, \u201cOkay there\u2019s, here\u2019s the Eastern school, here\u2019s the Central School, here\u2019s the\nWestern school and then here\u2019s the main school one, Grades 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and then 4 to 8 and I drove to\neach one every day for a half an hour, about a half an hour of language in each one, sometimes 40 minutes. So\nmy first year of teaching was Kindergarten to Grade One \u2014 Kindergarten to Grade 8, you know of course having\nto deal with an attitude all the way through, worst at the 7/8 level because they started to be a lot more like their\nparents, and a lot more annoying. And then your little guys you know, just soaked it all up and were a lot of fun.\nBut then, the band council says well here\u2019s, here\u2019s your job, here\u2019s where you\u2019re teaching, and here\u2019s a hundred\ndollars a week. (laughter) No materials whatsoever, so I bought, I had to buy any materials that I needed for\nflashcards, for doing things within the class to help the kids learn and that sort of thing but one thing that there\nwasn\u2019t was a textbook. There was, there was no available materials that they were using and that was pretty much\neverywhere, so you pretty much had to develop your own material so I started doing more and I got thinking well\nthe language is a lot more than just words. And there are a lot of words that seem to be very much the same.\nI taught for five years and about the fourth year came across this book published by G\u00fcnther Michelson called A\nThousand Words of Mohawk and it was all about the roots. And I bought a copy of this thing and I started looking\nat it, \u201cOh, wow, this makes so much sense.\u201d So then I started, well maybe that is the better way to teach the\nlanguage course.\n[CA: So he had done the linguistics research to assemble the roots?]\nYeah, he was a linguist himself and of course, a lot of the linguistic work done on Iroquoian languages at the\ntime was for the most part unreadable. (laughter) I didn\u2019t have the education to deal with all that sort of weird and\nwonderful vocabulary. If I got a book, I had some linguistic stuff on the language, but as long as it provided enough\nexamples that I could, then I could figure out what they were talking about \u2026 but \u2026 I really needed to have the\nexamples. So I started doing his stuff and then gradually working this into, to doing the class, classroom stuff.\n[CA: So it sounds like there could be a valuable role here for people who may not have, who may not\nknow languages, Indigenous languages but know some linguistics to work with speakers of the language\nto create materials?] 292 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nOh yeah, I think, if they, and if they\u2019re going to be working with speakers they really do have to be somebody who\nhas a sense of the grammar of the language. One of the things I learned how to do by trial and error was, learned\nhow to ask the right question. Because speakers will tell you what comes to their mind. So we say, well what\u2019s the\nword for \u201ctree\u201d? \u201cOh, kerhit\u00e1ke\u201c. Okay, eventually I learned that means \u201con the tree\u201d. Kerhit\u00e1kon, eventually I learned\nthat was \u201cin the tree\u201d, and then, you know, they would give me all of these, tkerhitoke, \u201cThere\u2019s a tree standing\nthere,\u201d and eventually I figured out that, k\u00e9rhite was the word for \u201ctree\u201d. Oh, yeah, yeah, you\u2019re telling us k\u00e9rhite,\nyeah, that\u2019s \u201ctree\u201d. (laughter)\nBut the thing is that, and when you\u2019re asking them something, you know, a question like, you know, \u201cI trust him.\u201d\nYou trust him for money? You trust him for what he says? You trust him for what he\u2019s doing? You trust them to get\nthe job done? What? Because those are all different, you know?\nAnd, and the business of using pronominals \u2014 we have a subjective, objective and transitive, and they would\nmix them. Now this is a problem that was happening in the, in the language programs in the schools, is because\nthe fluent speakers were suddenly, oh Aunt Maisie there, she\u2019s a fluent speaker. Yeah, she\u2019s 85 but she can teach\nthese kids \u2014 what a horrible thing to do to an old woman (laughter) \u2014 but anyway, she could use the money, so.\nBut the thing is that she had, as a fluent speaker she had no sense of the grammar of the language.\n[CA: Right, didn\u2019t have the metalinguistic awareness.]\nConstantly mixing categories, constantly mixing, you know, mixing things up. \u201cHow come you said,\nwahahn\u00ed:no yesterday and today you said rohahn\u00ed:no for \u2018he bought\u2019?\u201d They both kind of mean that, wahahn\u00ed:no,\n\u201che just bought it\u201d, rohahn\u00ed:no, he bought it, but quite a while ago\u201d.\n[CA: Yeah, that\u2019s something that my students in, in first-year linguistics struggle with making this, this\nunconscious implicit knowledge about how their language works and making that explicit. It\u2019s a real\nchallenge. Whatever, I mean, we mostly do it in English but whatever your native language is, it\u2019s hard to\nbecome conscious\u2026]\nYeah, so learning \u2013 learning to ask the right question, you know and, even when, when doing a sentence, you\nreally have to pay attention to, to how they\u2019re organizing the sentence, how they\u2019re putting it together, and even\nthough when they would say things, I would, \u201cyeah, yeah, I know\u201d. I have a sense of what they were saying, but\n(laughter), it just, sometimes it was so confusing, sometimes very frustrating, sometimes you would ask three or\nfour different speakers the same thing and they would all tell you something different. Is it because there are four\nways to say the same thing or is it not really the same thing but simply refers to similar situations?\nNow, I mean, that, that textbook there is all about the grammar of the language \u2014 what you use where, how\nyou organize it, what you say when, and stuff.\n[CA: And it\u2019s over your years of experience that you\u2019ve assembled\u2026]\nYeah. Over the years I\u2019ve written five different language learning textbooks complete with, with exercises, drills\nand all the sort of stuff. That also has a book of exercises and drills to go with it. The difference is that is on, on\naudio, so it\u2019s \u2026 you can, you\u2019ll find the exact same textbook on screen which you can highlight the audio and get a\npronunciation. 11.6 Speaking Mohawk and Reconciliation\nIn this unit, Dr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle shares his view that language will play a vital role in reconciliation efforts, and talks\nabout some of the challenges of maintaining a language when English is so dominant in Canadian society.\n293 294 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=233\nVIDEO SCRIPT\n[CA: I mean I was thinking about your students, like, are, are they going to speak Mohawk to their kids\nwhen they have kids, do you think?]\nI think it\u2019s really up to, up to the student, I mean, they may have thought you know learning the language is\ndifficult. Finding a compatible partner who also speaks the language is going to be the real test. And some of them\nhave, have found partners who, and they have raised kids, they\u2019re raising kids together.\n[CA: So are there kids who are growing up who are learning to speak it as they\u2019re growing up?]\nYeah.\n[CA: That\u2019s starting to happen more?]\nYeah.\nPeople don\u2019t realize that learning language is a lifelong\u2026 I, every now and then I\u2019ll run across vocabulary \u2014 oh\nyeah, wow this word \u2014 and then just \u2026 learning new vocabulary, words I hadn\u2019t heard before or words that I\u2019d\nheard but I didn\u2019t have time to figure out the context and so, always in a state of language learning you know even\nafter you\u2019re a speaker.\nWe need language. I don\u2019t know how we function without language. And nowadays with Native people you\nknow, so much of this, this reconciliation thing going on and that sort of thing. Years ago in my home community, a\nlot of farmers that lived around the territory also spoke Mohawk. Very minimal in a way and stuff like that because\nthey hired a lot of people from the territory to work on their farms. So they learned Mohawk. They learned it to\na degree \u2014 you could go into stores in Deseronto and shopkeepers would, you know, would deal with, with the\npeople in Mohawk. Now, it was Mohawk that would be related to the whole buying and selling and this sort of\nthing that but they did that. Now, to me, that\u2019s an aspect of reconciliation. That\u2019s where two groups have reconciled\nwith each other \u2014 okay you\u2019re there, you speak your language but I will learn to speak with you mostly because I\nwant your money \u2014 and \u2026 we, you know, we\u2019ll speak your language because we need your goods. I mean there\u2019s\nalways a give and take on any, any two groups that have reconciled with each other but I think at the same time,\ntoo, when people take time to learn your language, they do have a certain respect.\n[CA: That\u2019s what I was thinking \u2014 it certainly shows respect, that I value interacting with you enough to\ndo it in your language.]\nYeah, and the ones that want to interact more, learn more of the language. 11.7 The Future of Indigenous Languages in Canada\nIn this unit, Dr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle speaks eloquently about how vital each Indigenous language is to the identity of each\nFirst Nation, and about the long-term effects of colonization by the English and the French.\n295 296 CATHERINE ANDERSON\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/\nessentialsoflinguistics/?p=235\nVIDEO SCRIPT\nCanada is a bilingual country \u2026 and I think if Canada learns to extend itself, we\u2019ll start including more and more\nAboriginal languages. I think Canada is, would be better to tout itself as a multilingual country. Because I think\nwhen doing that, even if they, if their definition of multilingualism is, is the two founding languages and then the\nIndigenous languages, you\u2019re still looking at you know like fifty-five languages. And then because the difference, I\nthink too, Native people have to be included in all that because we were here when English and French showed\nup. Okay, English and French showed up and they created the present-day institutions and stuff like that, okay\nfine. Everybody else who has come to this country basically has read the brochure and understood that English\nor French are the languages, therefore come to this country understanding that, okay I\u2019m going to have to learn\nEnglish or French because that\u2019s how the company is organized, country is organized. Or if maybe I\u2019ll go learn an\nIndigenous language as well. But the Indigenous languages have to be at the table.\n[CA: The English and French arrived and didn\u2019t say oh well we\u2019re gonna have to learn the language that\npeople speak \u2014 they said we\u2019re here, now you\u2019re gonna speak our language.]\nYeah, but you know initially they did learn our languages to deal with us because they didn\u2019t have much choice.\nWe had what they didn\u2019t have and when we got to a point where we no longer had what they wanted, and of\ncourse, they wanted the land which meant pushing us off anyway, so the respect for the languages and stuff, kind\nof went out the door. Then it became well everybody here speaks English only. \u2026 I find that we need we need to\nhave the languages. I think that gives us a greater sense of who we are \u2014 the language!\nAnd, and the thing is that for, for Native people in this country we have spent so many years under the colonial\nthumb and so many years being convinced that our own languages and our traditions and everything that\u2019s about\nus is inferior or not as good as \u2026 And the thing that I\u2019ve found is that if you\u2019re a Native person you can work your\nbutt off to become as much like you know the non-native Canadian; at the end of the day your skin is still brown\nand that\u2019s not going to change. If I focus on speaking Mohawk then in the process of learning my language I\u2019m\nalso learning Mohawk culture and what it is to be a Mohawk person and that\u2019s, I think is something that is very\nimportant. We\u2019ve gotten into the habit of being Indians or Natives or Aboriginals or Indigenous. Nowadays the\nword\u2019s \u2018Indigenous\u2019. I think I keep telling my students, I said you know, I said, when I was born I was born an Indian\nbut then I became a Native and then I became Aboriginal and then I became First Nations and now I\u2019m Indigenous,\nyay! You know, Indigenous is the word of the 21st century and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll find another one, but the word I\nwould really like them to find and stick to is Mohawk, Oneida, Ojibwe, Chippewa. Know us by our nationalities,\nknow us by our distinct cultures, know us by what makes us unique in the world. Practice Time\nExercise 1. Listen again to the interview with David Kanatawakhon-Maracle in Unit 11.4. At 6:38 of the interview,\nhe describes the trouble that English speakers often have pronouncing his name, Kanatawakhon. Try to transcribe\nthis name in IPA, giving as detailed a narrow transcription as you can.\nExercise 2. Imagine you are working as a linguistic consultant with a community who is working to document\ntheir language. What kind of questions would you ask the fluent speakers, to elicit language data?\nExercise 2. Imagine you are working as a linguistic consultant on some audio-recordings of speech from fluent\nspeakers of an Indigenous language. What information would you try to obtain from these audio-recordings? What\nlinguistics skills would you use? Where would you start?\n297 Summary\nThis Chapter included several excerpts of an interview with a fluent Mohawk speaker, David Kanatawakhon-\nMaracle. In the interview, Dr. Kanatawakhon-Maracle talked about how important language is to the identity of\nan Indigenous person. Although most of the Indigenous languages spoken in what is currently Canada are quite\nendangered, it will be possible to preserve some of them. Teaching the languages to young people is a vital part of\nthe preservation effort, and having useful, accurate teaching materials is important for effective teaching. People\nwith training in Linguistics can make valuable contributions to supporting communities in documenting languages\nand creating teaching materials.\n298 BACK MATTER TEST\n299  Testing Keys\nCHAPTER 1 THINKING LIKE A LINGUIST\n1.1 LINGUISTICS IS SCIENCE\n1.

CHAPTER 12: DIGITAL SOCIAL\nLANGUAGE\n317  Digital Social Language - overview\nHow texting and online interactions are enriching the way we communicate.\nTIMOTHY MILLS\nPeople adapt their language to the setting they use it in \u2013 from deaf people signing to parents spelling out the\nwords they don\u2019t want their two-year-old to catch. But one of the most prominent ways that setting has shaped\nlanguage recently is our digital interactions. The most prominent linguists investigating this have been David\nCrystal, author of Internet Linguistics (2011) and Gretchen McCulloch, author of Because Internet (2019).\nIn her book, McCulloch identifies one of the most fascinating things for linguists about digital social language.\nWhile much of it is written (text messages, online chats and forums, comments on Youtube videos, etc), it is not\nwriting like we\u2019ve had in the past. Historically, there was formal and informal speech, and there was formal writing.\nToday, an increasing proportion of human writing is not formal (newspaper and magazine articles, scholarly\npapers, textbooks) \u2013 it is informal (text messages to friends, Twitter commentary on anything, and so on).\nSo this form of language has two things that linguists crave above all else: it is natural (relatively spontaneous\nand un-edited) and it is recorded.\nAnd of course, it is new, meaning we have whole new questions we can ask, and a whole new world of data to\nhelp us learn about the underlying, age-old phenomenon of language itself. What are emoji in language? Where\ndid all the periods go? What\u2019s with the weird capitalizations people are using?\n319  References\nArunachalam, S., & Waxman, S. R. (2010).
