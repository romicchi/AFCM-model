This drawer likely holds forks, spoons, and knives, and possibly\nother items such as a meat thermometer and a can opener. The drawer in this case represents a tool used to group a\ncollection of objects. The members of the group are the individual items in the drawer, such as a fork or a spoon.\nThe members of a set can be anything, such as people, numbers, or letters of the alphabet. In statistical studies, asetis\na well-defined collection of objects used to identify an entire population of interest. For example, in a research study\nexamining the effects of a new medication, there can be two sets of people: one set that is given the medication and a\ndifferent set that is given a placebo (control group). In this chapter, we will discuss sets and Venn diagrams, which are\ngraphical ways to show relationships between different groups. 6 1 \u2022 Sets\n1.1 Basic Set Concepts\nFigure1.2A spoon, fork, and knife are elements of the set of flatware. (credit: modification of work \u201cCupofjoy\u201d Wikimedia\nCC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Represent sets in a variety of ways.\n2. Represent well-defined sets and the empty set with proper set notation.\n3. Compute the cardinal value of a set.\n4. Differentiate between finite and infinite sets.\n5. Differentiate between equal and equivalent sets.\nSets and Ways to Represent Them\nThink back to your kitchen organization. If the drawer is theset, then the forks and knives areelementsin the set. Sets\ncan be described in a number of different ways: by roster, by set-builder notation, by interval notation, by graphing on a\nnumber line, and by Venn diagrams. Sets are typically designated with capital letters. The simplest way to represent a set\nwith only a few members is theroster(orlisting)method, in which the elements in a set are listed, enclosed by curly\nbraces and separated by commas. For example, if represents our set of flatware, we can represent by using the\nfollowing set notation with the roster method:\nEXAMPLE1.1\nWriting a Set Using the Roster or Listing Method\nWrite a set consisting of your three favorite sports and label it with a capital .\nSolution\nThere are multiple possible answers depending on what your three favorite sports are, but any answer must list three\ndifferent sports separated by commas, such as the following:\nYOUR TURN1.1\n1. Write a set consisting of four small hand tools that might be in a toolbox and label it with a capital .\nAll the sets we have considered so far have beenwell-defined sets. A well-defined set clearly communicates whether an\nelement is a member of the set or not. The members of a well-defined set are fixed and do not change over time.\nConsider the following question. What are your top 10 songs of 2021? You could create a list of your top 10 favorite\nsongs from 2021, but the list your friend creates will not necessarily contain the same 10 songs. So, the set of your top\n10 songs of 2021 is not a well-defined set. On the other hand, the set of the letters in your name is a well-defined set\nbecause it does not vary (unless of course you change your name). The NFL wide receiver, Chad Johnson, famously\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 Basic Set Concepts 7\nchanged his name to Chad Ochocinco to match his jersey number of 85.\nEXAMPLE1.2\nIdentifying Well-Defined Sets\nFor each of the following collections, determine if it represents a well-defined set.\n1. The group of all past vice presidents of the United States.\n2. A group of old cats.\nSolution\n1. The group of all past vice presidents of the United States is a well-defined set, because you can clearly identify if any\nindividual was or was not a member of that group. For example, Britney Spears is not a member of this set, but Joe\nBiden is a member of this set.\n2. A group of old cats is not a well-defined set because the word old is ambiguous. Some people might consider a\nseven-year-old cat to be old, while others might think a cat is not old until it is 13 years old. Because people can\ndisagree on what is and what is not a member of this group, the set is not well-defined.\nYOUR TURN1.2\nFor each of the following collections, determine if it represents a well-defined set.\n1. A collection of medium-sized potatoes.\n2. The original members of the Black Eyed Peas musical group.\nOn January 20, 2021, Kamala Harris was sworn in as the first woman vice president of the United States of America. If we\nwere to consider the set of all women vice presidents of the United States of America prior to January 20, 2021, this set\nwould be known as anempty set; the number of people in this set is 0, since there were no women vice presidents\nbefore Harris. The empty set, also called the null set, is written symbolically using a pair of braces, , or a zero with a\nslash through it, .\nThe set containing the number ,is a set with one element in it. It is not the same as the empty set, ,which\ndoes not have any elements in it. Symbolically: .\nEXAMPLE1.3\nRepresenting the Empty Set Symbolically\nRepresent each of the following sets symbolically.\n1. The set of prime numbers less than 2.\n2. The set of birds that are also mammals.\nSolution\n1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is only divisible by one and itself. Since there are no prime\nnumbers less than 2, this set is empty, and we can represent it symbolically as follows: These two different\nsymbols for the empty set can be used interchangeably.\n2. The set of birds and the set of mammals do not intersect, so the set of birds that are also mammals is empty, and\nwe can represent it symbolically as\nYOUR TURN1.3\n1. Represent the set of all numbers divisible by 0 symbolically. 8 1 \u2022 Sets\nWHO KNEW?\nThe Number Zero\nWe use the number zero to represent the concept of nothing every day. The machine language of computers is\nbinary, consisting only of zeros and ones, and even way before that, the number zero was a powerful invention that\nallowed our understanding of mathematics and science to develop. The historical record shows the Babylonians first\nused zeros around 300 B.C., while the Mayans developed and began using zero separately around 350 A.D. What is\nconsidered the first formal use of zero in arithmetic operations was developed by the Indian mathematician\nBrahmagupta around 650 A.D.\nBrahmagupta, Mathematician and Astronomer(https://openstax.org/r/brahmagupta.html)\nAnother interesting feature of the number zero is that although it is an even number, it is the only number that is\nneither negative nor positive.\nFor larger sets that have a natural ordering, sometimes an ellipsis is used to indicate that the pattern continues. It is\ncommon practice to list the first three elements of a set to establish a pattern, write the ellipsis, and then provide the last\nelement. Consider the set of all lowercase letters of the English alphabet, . This set can be written symbolically as\n.\nThe sets we have been discussing so far arefinite sets. They all have a limited or fixed number of elements. We also use\nan ellipsis forinfinite sets, which have an unlimited number of elements, to indicate that the pattern continues. For\nexample, in set theory, the set ofnatural numbers, which is the set of all positive counting numbers, is represented as\n\u2115 .\nNotice that for this set, there is no element following the ellipsis. This is because there is no largest natural number; you\ncan always add one more to get to the next natural number. Because the set of natural numbers grows without bound, it\nis an infinite set.\nEXAMPLE1.4\nWriting a Finite Set Using the Roster Method and an Ellipsis\nWrite the set of even natural numbers including and between 2 and 100, and label it with a capital . Include an ellipsis.\nSolution\nWrite the label, , followed by an equal sign and then a bracket. Write the first three even numbers separated by\ncommas, beginning with the number two to establish a pattern. Next, write the ellipsis followed by a comma and the last\nnumber in the list, 100. Finally, write the closing bracket to complete the set.\nWrite the label, , followed by an equal sign and then a bracket.\nWrite the first three even numbers separated by commas, beginning with the number 2 to establish a pattern.\nNext, write the ellipsis followed by a comma and the last number in the list, 100.\nFinally, write the closing bracket to complete the set.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 Basic Set Concepts 9\nYOUR TURN1.4\n1. Use an ellipsis to write the set of single digit numbers greater than or equal to zero and label it with a capital .\nOur number system is made up of several different infinite sets of numbers. The set ofintegers,\u2124 is another infinite\nset of numbers. It includes all the positive and negative counting numbers and the number zero. There is no largest or\nsmallest integer.\nEXAMPLE1.5\nWriting an Infinite Set Using the Roster Method and Ellipses\nWrite the set of integers using the roster method, and label it with a\u2124.\nSolution\nStep 1:As always, we write the label and then the opening bracket. Because the negative counting numbers are infinite,\nto represent that the pattern continues without bound to the left, we must use an ellipsis as the first element in our list.\nStep 2:We place a comma and follow it with at least three consecutive integers separated by commas to establish a\npattern.\nStep 3:Add an ellipsis to the end of the list to show that the set of integers continues without bound to the right.\nComplete the list with a closing bracket. The set of integers may be represented as follows:\n\u2124\nYOUR TURN1.5\n1. Write the set of odd numbers greater than 0 and label it with a capital .\nA shorthand way to write sets is with the use ofset builder notation, which is a verbal description or formula for the\nset. For example, the set of all lowercase letters of the English alphabet, , written in set builder notation is:\nThis is read as, \u201cSet is the set of all elements such that is a lowercase letter of the English alphabet.\u201d\nEXAMPLE1.6\nWriting a Set Using Set Builder Notation\nUsing set builder notation, write the set of all types of balls. Explain what the notation means.\nSolution\nThe verbal description of the set is, \u201cSet is the set of all elements such that is a ball.\u201d This set can be written in set\nbuilder notation as follows:\nYOUR TURN1.6\n1. Using set builder notation, write the set of all types of cars.\nEXAMPLE1.7\nWriting Sets Using Various Methods\nConsider the set of letters in the word \u201chappy.\u201d Determine the best way to represent this set, and then write the set using 10 1 \u2022 Sets\neither the roster method or set builder notation, whichever is more appropriate.\nSolution\nBecause the letters in the word \u201chappy\u201d consist of a small finite set, the best way to represent this set is with the roster\nmethod. Choose a label to represent the set, such as .\n.\nNotice that the letter \u201cp\u201d is only represented one time. This occurs because when representing members of a set, each\nunique element is only listed once no matter how many times it occurs. Duplicate elements are never repeated when\nrepresenting members of a set.\nYOUR TURN1.7\n1. Use the roster method or set builder notation to represent the collection of all musical instruments.\nComputing the Cardinal Value of a Set\nAlmost all the sets most people work with outside of pure mathematics are finite sets. For these sets, thecardinal value\norcardinalityof the set is the number of elements in the set. For finite set , the cardinality is denoted symbolically as\n. For example, a set that contains four elements has a cardinality of 4.\nHow do we measure the cardinality of infinite sets? The \u2018smallest\u2019 infinite set is the set of natural numbers, or counting\nnumbers,\u2115 . This set has a cardinality of (pronounced \"aleph-null\"). All sets that have the same\ncardinality as the set of natural numbers arecountably infinite. This concept, as well as notation using aleph, was\nintroduced by mathematician Georg Cantor who once said, \u201cA set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.\u201d\nEXAMPLE1.8\nComputing the Cardinal Value of a Set\nWrite the cardinal value of each of the following sets in symbolic form.\n1.\n2. The empty set.\nSolution\n1. There are 5 distinct elements in set : a fork, a spoon, a knife, a meat thermometer, and a can opener. Therefore,\nthe cardinal value of set is 5 and written symbolically as\n2. Because the empty set does not have any elements in it, the cardinality of the empty set is zero. Symbolically we\nwrite this as:\nYOUR TURN1.8\nWrite the cardinal value of each of the following sets in symbolic form.\n1. Set is the set of prime numbers less than 2.\n2. Set is the set of lowercase letters of the English alphabet, .\nNow that we have learned to represent finite and infinite sets using both the roster method and set builder notation, we\nshould also be able to determine if a set is finite or infinite based on its verbal or symbolic description. One way to\ndetermine if a set is finite or not is to determine the cardinality of the set. If the cardinality of a set is a natural number,\nthen the set is finite.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 Basic Set Concepts 11\nEXAMPLE1.9\nDifferentiating Between Finite and Infinite Sets\nClassify each of the following sets as infinite or finite.\n1.\n2. is the set of lowercase letters of the English Alphabet, .\n3. \u211a\nSolution\n1. . Since 5 is a natural number, the set is finite.\n2. . Since 26 is a natural number, the set is finite.\n3. Set\u211a is the set of rational numbers or fractions. Because the set of integers is a subset of the set of rational\nnumbers, and the set of integers is infinite, the set of rational numbers is also infinite. There is no smallest or\nlargest rational number.\nYOUR TURN1.9\nClassify each of the following sets as infinite or finite.\n1.\n2.\nEqual versus Equivalent Sets\nWhen speaking or writing we tend to use equal and equivalent interchangeably, but there is an important distinction\nbetween their meanings. Consider a new Ford Escape Hybrid and a new Toyota Rav4 Hybrid. Both cars are hybrid electric\nsport utility vehicles; in that sense, they areequivalent. They will both get you from place to place in a relatively fuel-\nefficient way. In this example we are comparing the single member set {Toyota Rav4 Hybrid} to the single member set\n{Ford Escape Hybrid}. Since these two sets have the same number of elements, they are also equivalent mathematically,\nmeaning they have the same cardinality. But they are not equal, because the two cars have different looks and features,\nand probably even handle differently. Each manufacturer will emphasize the features unique to their vehicle to persuade\nyou to buy it; if the SUVs were truly equal, there would be no reason to choose one over the other.\nNow consider two Honda CR-Vs that are made with exactly the same parts, on the same assembly line within a few\nminutes of each other\u2014these SUVs areequal. They are identical to each other, containing the same elements without\nregard to order, and the only differentiator when making a purchasing decision would be varied pricing at different\ndealerships. The set {Honda CR-V} is equal to the set {Honda CR-V}. Symbolically, we represent equal sets as and\nequivalent sets as .\nNow, let us consider a Toyota dealership that has 10 RAV4s on the lot, 8 Prii, 7 Highlanders, and 12 Camrys. There is a\none-to-one relationship between the set of vehicles on the lot and the set consisting of the number of each type of\nvehicle on the lot. Therefore, these two sets are equivalent, but not equal. The set {RAV4, Prius, Highlander, Camry} is\nequivalent to the set {10, 8, 7, 12} because they have the same number of elements.\nVIDEO\nEqual and Equivalent Sets(https://openstax.org/r/Equal_and_Equivalent_Sets)\nIf two sets are equal, they are also equivalent, because equal sets also have the same cardinality.\nEXAMPLE1.10\nDifferentiating Between Equivalent and Equal Sets\nDetermine if the following pairs of sets are equal, equivalent, or neither. 12 1 \u2022 Sets\n1. and\n2.

The set of prime numbers consists of the set of counting numbers greater than one that can only be divided evenly\nby one and itself. The set of prime numbers less than 2 is an empty set, since there are no prime numbers less than\n2. Therefore, these two sets are equal (and equivalent).\n3. The set of vowels in the word happiness is and the set of consonants in the word happiness is\nThe cardinal value of these sets two sets is and respectively.\nBecause the cardinality of the two sets differs, they are not equivalent.

Besides being an accomplished mathematician, he also played the violin. Cantor\nreceived his doctoral degree in Mathematics at the age of 22.\nIn 1870, at the age of 25 he established the uniqueness theorem for trigonometric series. His most significant work\nhappened between 1874 and 1884, when he established the existence of transcendental numbers (also called\nirrational numbers) and proved that the set of real numbers are uncountably infinite\u2014despite the objections of his\nformer professor Leopold Kronecker.\nCantor published his final treatise on set theory in 1897 at the age of 52, and was awarded the Sylvester Medial from\nthe Royal Society of London in 1904 for his contributions to the field. At the heart of Cantor\u2019s work was his goal to\nsolve the continuum problem, which later influenced the works of David Hilbert and Ernst Zermelo.\nReferences:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 Basic Set Concepts 13\nWikipedia contributors. \u201cCantor.\u201d Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 23 Mar. 2021.

In this section, we will explore the way we can\nselect a group of members from the whole set.\nEvery set is also a subset of itself,\nRecall the set of flatware in our kitchen drawer fromSection 1.1,\n. Suppose you are preparing to eat dinner, so you pull a fork and\na knife from the drawer to set the table. The set is a subset of set , because every member or\nelement of set is also a member of set . More specifically, set is aproper subsetof set , because there are other\nmembers of set not in set . This is written as . The only subset of a set that is not a proper subset of the set\nwould be the set itself.\nThe empty set or null set, , is a proper subset of every set, except itself.\nGraphically, sets are often represented as circles. In the following graphic, set is represented as a circle completely\nenclosed inside the circle representing set , showing that set is a proper subset of set .

Now, the work begins. Luckily for you, the assembly guide includes step-by-step instructions\nwith images that show you how to put together your product. If you are really lucky, the manufacturer may even provide\na URL or QR code connecting you to an online video that demonstrates the complete assembly process. We can likely all\nagree that assembly instructions are much easier to follow when they include images or videos, rather than just written\ndirections. The same goes for the relationships between sets.\nInterpreting Venn Diagrams\nVenn diagramsare the graphical tools or pictures that we use to visualize and understand relationships between sets.\nVenn diagrams are named after the mathematician John Venn, who first popularized their use in the 1880s. When we use\na Venn diagram to visualize the relationships between sets, the entire set of data under consideration is drawn as a\nrectangle, and subsets of this set are drawn as circles completely contained within the rectangle. The entire set of data\nunder consideration is known as theuniversal set.\nConsider the statement: All trees are plants. This statement expresses the relationship between the set of all plants and\nthe set of all trees. Because every tree is a plant, the set of trees is a subset of the set of plants. To represent this\nrelationship using a Venn diagram, the set of plants will be our universal set and the set of trees will be the subset. Recall\nthat this relationship is expressed symbolically as: To create a Venn diagram, first we draw a rectangle\nand label the universal set \u201c \u201d Then we draw a circle within the universal set and label it with the word \u201cTrees.\u201d\nFigure1.7\nThis section will introduce how to interpret and construct Venn diagrams. In future sections, as we expand our\nknowledge of relationships between sets, we will also develop our knowledge and use of Venn diagrams to explore how\nmultiple sets can be combined to form new sets.\nEXAMPLE1.18\nInterpreting the Relationship between Sets in a Venn Diagram\nWrite the relationship between the sets in the following Venn diagram, in words and symbolically.\nFigure1.8\nSolution\nThe set of terriers is a subset of the universal set of dogs.

Lions and tigers are both different types of cats, but no lions are tigers, and no tigers are lions.\nBecause the set of all lions and the set of all tigers do not have any members in common, we call these two setsdisjoint\nsets, or non-overlapping sets.\nTwo sets and are disjoint sets if they do not share any elements in common. That is, if is a member of set , then\nis not a member of set . If is a member of set , then is not a member of set . To represent the relationship\nbetween the set of all cats and the sets of lions and tigers using a Venn diagram, we draw the universal set of cats as a\nrectangle and then draw a circle for the set of lions and a separate circle for the set of tigers within the rectangle,\nensuring that the two circles representing the set of lions and the set of tigers do not touch or overlap in any way.\nFigure1.9\nEXAMPLE1.19\nDescribing the Relationship between Sets\nDescribe the relationship between the sets in the following Venn diagram.\nFigure1.10\nSolution\nThe set of triangles and the set of squares are two disjoint subsets of the universal set of two-dimensional figures.

Draw a circle within the rectangle to represent a subset of the universal set and label it with the set name.\nIf there are multiple disjoint subsets of the universal set, their separate circles should not touch or overlap.\nEXAMPLE1.20\nDrawing a Venn Diagram to Represent the Relationship Between Two Sets\nDraw a Venn diagram to represent the relationship between each of the sets.\n1. All rectangles are parallelograms.\n2. All women are people.\nSolution\n1. The set of rectangles is a subset of the set of parallelograms.\nFirst, draw a rectangle to represent the universal set and label it with , then draw a circle\ncompletely within the rectangle, and label it with the name of the set it represents, .\nFigure1.11\nIn this example, both letters and names are used to represent the sets involved, but this is not necessary. You may use\neither letters or names alone, as long as the relationship is clearly depicted in the diagram, as shown below.\nFigure1.12\nor 24 1 \u2022 Sets\nFigure1.13\n2.

Draw a Venn diagram to represent this relationship.\nSolution\nStep 1:The set of bicycles and the set of cars are both subsets of the set of things with wheels. The universal set is the\nset of things with wheels, so we first draw a rectangle and label it with .\nStep 2:Because the set of bicycles and the set of cars do not share any elements in common, these two sets are disjoint\nand must be drawn as two circles that do not touch or overlap with the universal set.\nFigure1.15\nYOUR TURN1.21\n1.

Draw conclusions from Venn diagrams with two sets.\nThe movieYours, Mine, and Ourswas originally released in 1968 and starred Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. This movie,\nwhich is loosely based on a true story, is about the marriage of Helen, a widow with eight children, and Frank, a widower\nwith ten children, who then have an additional child together. The movie is a comedy that plays on the interpersonal and\norganizational struggles of feeding, bathing, and clothing twenty people in one household.\nIf we consider the set of Helen's children and the set of Frank's children, then the child they had together is the\nintersection of these two sets, and the collection of all their children combined is the union of these two sets. In this\nsection, we will explore the operations of union and intersection as it relates to two sets.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.4 \u2022 Set Operations with Two Sets 29\nThe Intersection of Two Sets\nThe members that the two sets share in common are included in theintersection of two sets. To be in the intersection\nof two sets, an element must be in both the first set and the second set. In this way, the intersection of two sets is a\nlogical AND statement. Symbolically, intersection is written as: . intersection is written in set builder\nnotation as: .\nLet us look at Helen's and Frank's children from the movieYours, Mine, and Ours.Helen's children consist of the set\nand Frank's children are included in the set\n. intersection is the set\nof children they had together. , because Joseph is in both set and set .\nEXAMPLE1.23\nFinding the Intersection of Set and Set\nSet and Find intersection\nSolution\nThe intersection of sets and include the elements that set and have in common: 3, 5, and 7.\nYOUR TURN1.23\n1.

If the two sets intersect, then intersection is a subset of both set and set .

To keep this example simple, let us focus on the road test and the written test. If\nyou pass the written test but fail the road test, you will not receive your license. If you fail the written test, you will not be\nallowed to take the road test and you will not receive a license to drive. To receive a driver's license, you must pass the\nwritten test AND the road test. For an \u201cAND\u201d statement to be true, both conditions that make up the statement must be\ntrue. Similarly, the intersection of two sets and is the set of elements that are in both set and set . To be a\nmember of intersection , an element must be in set and also must be in set . The intersection of two sets\ncorresponds to a logical \"AND\" statement.\nThe union of two sets is a logical inclusive \"OR\" statement. Say you are at a birthday party and the host offers Leah, 34 1 \u2022 Sets\nLenny, Maya, and you some cake or ice cream for dessert. Leah asks for cake, Lenny accepts both cake and ice cream,\nMaya turns down both, and you choose only ice cream. Leah, Lenny, and you are all having dessert. The \u201cOR\u201d statement\nis true if at least one of the components is true. Maya is the only one who did not have cake or ice cream; therefore, she\ndid not have dessert and the \u201cOR\u201d statement is false.

Leonhard Euler's works were published\nover 100 years prior to Venn's, and Euler may have been influenced by the works of Gottfried Leibniz.\nSo, why does John Venn get all the credit for these graphical depictions? Venn was the first to formalize the use of\nthese diagrams in his bookSymbolic Logic,published in 1881. Further, he made significant improvements in their\ndesign, including shading to highlight the region of interest. The mathematician C.L. Dodgson, also known as Lewis\nCarroll, built upon Venn\u2019s work by adding an enclosing universal set.\nInvention is not necessarily coming up with an initial idea. It is about seeing the potential of an idea and applying it to\na new situation.\nReferences:\nMargaret E.

In this section, we will extend our\nknowledge of set relationships by including a third set.\nA Venn diagram with two intersecting sets breaks up the universal set into four regions; simply adding one additional set\nwill increase the number of regions to eight, doubling the complexity of the problem.\nVenn Diagrams with Three Sets\nBelow is a Venn diagram with two intersecting sets, which breaks the universal set up into four distinct regions.\nFigure1.29\nNext, we see aVenn diagram with three intersecting sets, which breaks up the universal set into eight distinct\nregions.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.5 \u2022 Set Operations with Three Sets 41\nFigure1.30\nTECH CHECK\nShading Venn Diagrams\nVenn Diagram is an Android application that allows you to visualize how the sets are related in a Venn diagram by\nentering expressions and displaying the resulting Venn diagram of the set shaded in gray.\nFigure1.31Google Play Store image of Venn Diagram app. (credit: screenshot from Google Play)\nThe Venn Diagram application uses some notation that differs from the notation covered in this text.\na.

The set difference operation, , is available in the Venn Diagram app, although this operation is not covered in\nthe text.\nIt is recommended that you explore this application to expand your knowledge of Venn diagrams prior to continuing\nwith the next example.\nIn the next example, we will explore the three main blood factors, A, B and Rh. The following background information\nabout blood types will help explain the relationships between the sets of blood factors. If an individual has blood factor A\nor B, those will be included in their blood type. The Rh factor is indicated with a or a . For example, if a person has all\nthree blood factors, then their blood type would be . In the Venn diagram, they would be in the intersection of all\nthree sets, If a person did not have any of these three blood factors, then their blood type would be\nand they would be in the set which is the region outside all three circles.\nEXAMPLE1.35\nInterpreting a Venn Diagram with Three Sets\nUse the Venn diagram below, which shows the blood types of 100 people who donated blood at a local clinic, to answer\nthe following questions.\nFigure1.32\n1.

Start with the intersection of the three sets, then address the regions that involve the intersection of\ntwo sets. Next, complete the regions that involve a single set, and finally address the region in the universal set that does\nnot intersect with any of the three sets. This method can be extended to any number of sets. The key is to start with the\nregion involving the most overlap, working your way from the center out.\nEXAMPLE1.36\nCreating a Venn Diagram with Three Sets\nA teacher surveyed her class of 43 students to find out how they prepared for their last test. She found that 24 students\nmade flash cards, 14 studied their notes, and 27 completed the review assignment. Of the entire class of 43 students, 12\ncompleted the review and made flash cards, nine completed the review and studied their notes, and seven made flash\ncards and studied their notes, while only five students completed all three of these tasks. The remaining students did not\ndo any of these tasks. Create a Venn diagram with subsets labeled: \u201cNotes,\u201d \u201cFlash Cards,\u201d and \u201cReview\u201d to represent how\nthe students prepared for the test.\nSolution\nStep 1:First, draw a Venn diagram with three intersecting circles to represent the three intersecting sets: Notes, Flash\nCards, and Review. Label the universal set with the cardinality of the class.\nFigure1.33\nStep 2:Next, in the region where all three sets intersect, enter the number of students who completed all three tasks. 44 1 \u2022 Sets\nFigure1.34\nStep 3:Next, calculate the value and label the three sections where just two sets overlap.\na. Review and flash card overlap. A total of 12 students completed the review and made flash cards, but five of these\ntwelve students did all three tasks, so we need to subtract: . This is the value for the region where the\nflash card set intersects with the review set.\nb. Review and notes overlap. A total of 9 students completed the review and studied their notes, but again, five of\nthese nine students completed all three tasks. So, we subtract: . This is the value for the region where the\nreview set intersects with the notes set.\nc. Flash card and notes overlap. A total of 7 students made flash cards and studied their notes; subtracting the five\nstudents that did all three tasks from this number leaves 2 students who only studied their notes and made flash\ncards. Add these values to the Venn diagram.\nFigure1.35\nStep 4:Now, repeat this process to find the number of students who only completed one of these three tasks.\na. A total of 24 students completed flash cards, but we have already accounted for of these. Thus,\nstudents who just made flash cards.\nb. A total of 14 students studied their notes, but we have already accounted for of these. Thus,\nstudents only studied their notes.\nc. A total of 27 students completed the review assignment, but we have already accounted for of these,\nwhich means students only completed the review assignment.\nd. Add these values to the Venn diagram.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.5 \u2022 Set Operations with Three Sets 45\nFigure1.36\nStep 5:Finally, compute how many students did not do any of these three tasks. To do this, we add together each value\nthat we have already calculated for the separate and intersecting sections of our three sets:\n. Because there 43 students in the class, and , this means only one student\ndid not complete any of these tasks to prepare for the test. Record this value somewhere in the rectangle, but outside of\nall the circles, to complete the Venn diagram.\nFigure1.37\nYOUR TURN1.36\n1. A group of 50 people attending a conference who preordered their lunch were able to select their choice of soup,\nsalad, or sandwich. A total of 17 people selected soup, 29 people selected salad and 35 people selected a\nsandwich. Of these orders, 11 attendees selected soup and salad, 10 attendees selected soup and a sandwich,\nand 18 selected a salad and a sandwich, while eight people selected a soup, a salad, and a sandwich. Create a\nVenn diagram with subsets labeled \u201cSoup,\u201d \u201cSalad,\u201d and \u201cSandwich,\u201d and label the cardinality of each section of\nthe Venn diagram as indicated by the data.\nApplying Set Operations to Three Sets\nSet operations are applied between two sets at a time. Parentheses indicate which operation should be performed first.\nAs with numbers, the inner most parentheses are applied first. Next, find the complement of any sets, then perform any\nunion or intersections that remain. 46 1 \u2022 Sets\nEXAMPLE1.37\nApplying Set Operations to Three Sets\nPerform the set operations as indicated on the following sets: ,\nand\n1.

The following\nequivalences hold true for sets:\n\u2022 and These are the associative property for set intersection\nand set union.\n\u2022 and These are the commutative property for set intersection and set union.\n\u2022 and These are the distributive property for sets\nover union and intersection, respectively.\nProving Equality of Sets Using Venn Diagrams\nTo prove set equality using Venn diagrams, the strategy is to draw a Venn diagram to represent each side of the equality,\nthen look at the resulting diagrams to see if the regions under consideration are identical.\nAugustus De Morgan was an English mathematician known for his contributions to set theory and logic. De Morgan\u2019s law\nfor set complement over union states that . In the next example, we will use Venn diagrams to prove\nDe Morgan\u2019s law for set complement over union is true. But before we begin, let us confirm De Morgan\u2019s law works for a\nspecific example. While showing something is true for one specific example is not a proof, it will provide us with some\nreason to believe that it may be true for all cases.\nLet and We will use these sets in the equation\nTo begin, find the value of the set defined by each side of the equation.\nStep 1: is the collection of all unique elements in set or set or both.

The main goal of arguments made by\nlawyers is to convince a judge and jury that their arguments are valid and well-supported by the facts of the case, so the\ncase should be ruled in their favor. Think about Thurgood Marshall arguing for desegregation in front of the U.S.\nSupreme Court during theBrown v. Board of Education of Topekalawsuit in 1954, or Ruth Bader Ginsburg arguing for\nequality in social security benefits for both men and women under the law during the mid-1970s. Both these great minds\nwere known for the preparation and thoroughness of their logical legal arguments, which resulted in victories that\nadvanced the causes they fought for. Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg would later become well respected\njustices on the U.S. Supreme Court themselves.\nIn this chapter, we will explore how to construct well-reasoned logical arguments using varying structures. Your ability to\nform and comprehend logical arguments is a valuable tool in many areas of life, whether you're planning a dinner date,\nnegotiating the purchase of a new car, or persuading your boss that you deserve a raise. 60 2 \u2022 Logic\n2.1 Statements and Quantifiers\nFigure2.2Construction of a logical argument, like that of a house, requires you to begin with the right parts. (credit:\nmodification of work \u201cBarn Raising\u201d by Robert Stinnett/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Identify logical statements.\n2. Represent statements in symbolic form.\n3. Negate statements in words.\n4. Negate statements symbolically.\n5. Translate negations between words and symbols.\n6. Express statements with quantifiers of all, some, and none.\n7. Negate statements containing quantifiers of all, some, and none.\nHave you ever built a club house, tree house, or fort with your friends? If so, you and your friends likely started by\ngathering some tools and supplies to work with, such as hammers, saws, screwdrivers, wood, nails, and screws.\nHopefully, at least one member of your group had some knowledge of how to use the tools correctly and helped to\ndirect the construction project. After all, if your house isn't built on a strong foundation, it will be weak and could\npossibly fall apart during the next big storm. This same foundation is important in logic.\nIn this section, we will begin with the parts that make up all logical arguments. The building block of any logical\nargument is alogical statement, or simply a statement. A logical statement has the form of a complete sentence, and it\nmust make a claim that can be identified as being true or false.\nWhen making arguments, sometimes people make false claims. When evaluating the strength or validity of a logical\nargument, you must also consider thetruth values, or the identification of true or false, of all the statements used to\nsupport the argument. While a false statement is still considered a logical statement, a strong logical argument starts\nwith true statements.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 Statements and Quantifiers 61\nIdentifying Logical Statements\nFigure2.3Not all roses are red. (credit: \u201cassorted pink yellow white red roses macro\u201d by ProFlowers/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nAn example of logical statement with a false truth value is, \u201cAll roses are red.\u201d It is a logical statement because it has the\nform of a complete sentence and makes a claim that can be determined to be either true or false. It is a false statement\nbecause not all roses are red: some roses are red, but there are also roses that are pink, yellow, and white. Requests,\nquestions, or directives may be complete sentences, but they are not logical statements because they cannot be\ndetermined to be true or false. For example, suppose someone said to you, \u201cPlease, sit down over there.\u201d This request\ndoes not make a claim and it cannot be identified as true or false; therefore, it is not a logical statement.\nEXAMPLE2.1\nIdentifying Logical Statements\nDetermine whether each of the following sentences represents a logical statement. If it is a logical statement, determine\nwhether it is true or false.\n1. Tiger Woods won the Master\u2019s golf championship at least five times.\n2. Please, sit down over there.\n3. All cats dislike dogs.\nSolution\n1. This is a logical statement because it is a complete sentence that makes a claim that can be identified as being true\nor false. As of 2021, this statement is true: Tiger Woods won the Master\u2019s in 1997, 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2019.\n2. This is not a logical statement because, although it is a complete sentence, this request does not make a claim that\ncan be identified as being either true or false.\n3. This is a logical statement because it is a complete sentence that makes a claim that can be identified as being true\nor false. This statement is false because some cats do like some dogs.\nYOUR TURN2.1\nDetermine whether each of the following sentences represents a logical statement. If it is a logical statement,\ndetermine whether it is true or false.\n1. The Buffalo Bills defeated the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXV.\n2. Michael Jackson\u2019s albumThrillerwas released in 1982.\n3. Would you like some coffee or tea?\nRepresenting Statements in Symbolic Form\nWhen analyzing logical arguments that are made of multiple logical statements,symbolic formis used to reduce the\namount of writing involved. Symbolic form also helps visualize the relationship between the statements in a more 62 2 \u2022 Logic\nconcise way in order to determine the strength or validity of an argument. Each logical statement is represented\nsymbolically as a single lowercase letter, usually starting with the letter .\nTo begin, you will practice how to write a single logical statement in symbolic form. This skill will become more useful as\nyou work with compound statements in later sections.\nEXAMPLE2.2\nRepresenting Statements Using Symbolic Form\nWrite each of the following logical statements in symbolic form.\n1. Barry Bonds holds the Major League Baseball record for total career home runs.\n2. Some mammals live in the ocean.\n3. Ruth Bader Ginsburg served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1993 to 2020.\nSolution\n1. : Barry Bonds holds the Major League Baseball record for total career home runs. The statement is labeled with a\nOnce the statement is labeled, use as a replacement for the full written statement to write and analyze the\nargument symbolically.\n2. : Some mammals live in the ocean. The letter is used to distinguish this statement from the statement in question\n1, but any lower-case letter may be used.\n3. : Ruth Bader Ginsburg served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1993 to 2020. When multiple statements are present\nin later sections, you will want to be sure to use a different letter for each separate logical statement.\nYOUR TURN2.2\nWrite each of the following logical statements in symbolic form.\n1. The movieGandhiwon the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1982.\n2. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world.\n3. All oranges are citrus fruits.\nWHO KNEW?\nMathematics is not the only language to use symbols to represent thoughts or ideas. The Chinese and Japanese\nlanguages use symbols known as Hanzi and Kanji, respectively, to represent words and phrases. At one point, the\nAmerican musician Prince famously changed his name to a symbol representing love.\nBBC Prince Symbol Article(https://openstax.org/r/magazine-36107590)\nNegating Statements\nConsider the false statement introduced earlier, \u201cAll roses are red.\u201d If someone said to you, \u201cAll roses are red,\u201d you might\nrespond with, \u201cSome roses are not red.\u201d You could then strengthen your argument by providing additional statements,\nsuch as, \u201cThere are also white roses, yellow roses, and pink roses, to name a few.\u201d\nThenegation of a logical statementhas the opposite truth value of the original statement. If the original statement is\nfalse, its negation is true, and if the original statement is true, its negation is false. Most logical statements can be\nnegated by simply adding or removing the wordnot. For example, consider the statement, \u201cEmma Stone has green\neyes.\u201d The negation of this statement would be, \u201cEmma Stone does not have green eyes.\u201d The table below gives some\nother examples.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 Statements and Quantifiers 63\nLogical Statement Negation\nGordon Ramsey is a chef. Gordon Ramsey is not a chef.\nTony the Tiger does not have spots. Tony the Tiger has spots.\nTable2.1\nThe way you phrase your argument can impact its success. If someone presents you with a false statement, the ability to\nrebut that statement with its negation will provide you with the tools necessary to emphasize the correctness of your\nposition.\nEXAMPLE2.3\nNegating Logical Statements\nWrite the negation of each logical statement in words.\n1. Michael Phelps was an Olympic swimmer.\n2. Tom is a cat.\n3. Jerry is not a mouse.\nSolution\n1. Add the wordnotto negate the affirmative statement: \u201cMichael Phelps was not an Olympic swimmer.\u201d\n2. Add the wordnotto negate the affirmative statement: \u201cTom is not a cat.\u201d\n3. Remove the wordnotto negate the negative statement: \u201cJerry is a mouse.\u201d\nYOUR TURN2.3\nWrite the negation of each logical statement in words.\n1. Ted Cruz was not born in Texas.\n2. Adele has a beautiful singing voice.\n3. Leaves convert carbon dioxide to oxygen during the process of photosynthesis.\nNegating Logical Statements Symbolically\nThe symbol for negation, or not, in logic is the tilde, ~. So, not is represented as . To negate a statement symbolically,\nremove or add a tilde. The negation of not (not ) is . Symbolically, this equation is\nEXAMPLE2.4\nNegating Logical Statements Symbolically\nWrite the negation of each logical statement symbolically.\n1. : Michael Phelps was an Olympic swimmer.\n2. : Tom is not a cat.\n3. : Jerry is not a mouse.\nSolution\n1. To negate an affirmative logical statement symbolically, add a tilde: .\n2. Because the symbol for this statement is , its negation is .\n3. The symbol for this statement is , so to negate it we simply remove the ~, because The answer is .\nYOUR TURN2.4\nWrite the negation of each logical statement symbolically. 64 2 \u2022 Logic\n1. : Ted Cruz was not born in Texas.\n2. : Adele has a beautiful voice.\n3. : Leaves convert carbon dioxide to oxygen during the process of photosynthesis.\nTranslating Negations Between Words and Symbols\nIn order to analyze logical arguments, it is important to be able to translate between the symbolic and written forms of\nlogical statements.\nEXAMPLE2.5\nTranslating Negations Between Words and Symbols\nGiven the statements:\n: Elmo is a red Muppet.\n: Ketchup is not a vegetable.\n1. Write the symbolic form of the statement, \u201cElmo is not a red Muppet.\u201d\n2. Translate the statement into words.\nSolution\n1. \u201cElmo is not a red muppet\u201d is the negation of \u201cElmo is a red muppet,\u201d which is represented as . Thus, we would\nwrite \u201cElmo is not a red muppet\u201d symbolically as .\n2. Because is the symbol representing the statement, \u201cKetchup is not a vegetable,\u201d is equivalent to the statement,\n\u201cKetchup is a vegetable.\u201d\nYOUR TURN2.5\nGiven the statements:\n: Woody and Buzz Lightyear are best friends.\n: Wonder Woman is not stronger than Captain Marvel.\n1. Write the symbolic form of the statement, \"Wonder Woman is stronger than Captain Marvel.\"\n2. Translate the statement into words.\nExpressing Statements with Quantifiers of All, Some, or None\nAquantifieris a term that expresses a numerical relationship between two sets or categories. For example, all squares\nare also rectangles, but only some rectangles are squares, and no squares are circles. In this example,all, some,and\nnoneare quantifiers. In a logical argument, the logical statements made to support the argument are calledpremises,\nand the judgment made based on the premises is called theconclusion. Logical arguments that begin with specific\npremises and attempt to draw more general conclusions are calledinductive arguments.\nConsider, for example, a parent walking with their three-year-old child. The child sees a cardinal fly by and points it out.\nAs they continue on their walk, the child notices a robin land on top of a tree and a duck flying across to land on a pond.\nThe child recognizes that cardinals, robins, and ducks are all birds, then excitedly declares, \"All birds fly!\" The child has\njust made an inductive argument. They noticed that three different specific types of birds all fly, then synthesized this\ninformation to draw the more general conclusion that all birds can fly. In this case, the child's conclusion is false.\nThe specific premises of the child's argument can be paraphrased by the following statements:\n\u2022 Premise: Cardinals are birds that fly.\n\u2022 Premise: Robins are birds that fly.\n\u2022 Premise: Ducks are birds that fly.\nThe general conclusion is: \u201cAll birds fly!\u201d\nAll inductive arguments should include at least three specific premises to establish a pattern that supports the general\nconclusion. To counter the conclusion of an inductive argument, it is necessary to provide a counter example. The parent\ncan tell the child about penguins or emus to explain why that conclusion is false.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 Statements and Quantifiers 65\nOn the other hand, it is usually impossible to prove that an inductive argument is true. So, inductive arguments are\nconsidered either strong or weak. Deciding whether an inductive argument is strong or weak is highly subjective and\noften determined by the background knowledge of the person making the judgment. Most hypotheses put forth by\nscientists using what is called the \u201cscientific method\u201d to conduct experiments are based on inductive reasoning.\nIn the following example, we will use quantifiers to express the conclusion of a few inductive arguments.\nEXAMPLE2.6\nDrawing General Conclusions to Inductive Arguments Using Quantifiers\nFor each series of premises, draw a logical conclusion to the argument that includes one of the following quantifiers: all,\nsome, or none.\n1. Squares and rectangles have four sides. A square is a parallelogram, and a rectangle is a parallelogram. What\nconclusion can be drawn from these premises?\n2. and Of these, 1 and 2, 6 and 7, and 23 and 24 are consecutive integers; 3, 13,\nand 47 are odd numbers. What conclusion can be drawn from these premises?\n3. Sea urchins live in the ocean, and they do not breathe air. Sharks live in the ocean, and they do not breathe air. Eels\nlive in the ocean, and they do not breath air. What conclusion can be drawn from these premises?\nSolution\n1. The conclusion you would likely come to here is \u201cSome four-sided figures are parallelograms.\u201d However, it would be\nincorrect to say that all four-sided figures are parallelograms because there are some four-sided figures, such as\ntrapezoids, that are not parallelograms. This is a false conclusion.\n2. From these premises, you may draw the conclusion \u201cAll sums of two consecutive counting numbers result in an odd\nnumber.\u201d Most inductive arguments cannot be proven true, but several mathematical properties can be. If we let\nrepresent our first counting number, then would be the next counting number and .\nBecause is divisible by two, it is an even number, and if you add one to any even number the result is always an\nodd number. Thus, the conclusion is true!\n3. Based on the premises provided, with no additional knowledge about whales or dolphins, you might conclude \u201cNo\ncreatures that live in the ocean breathe air.\u201d Even though this conclusion is false, it still follows from the known\npremises and thus is a logical conclusion based on the evidence presented. Alternatively, you could conclude \u201cSome\ncreatures that live in the ocean do not breathe air.\u201d The quantifier you choose to write your conclusion with may vary\nfrom another person\u2019s based on how persuasive the argument is. There may be multiple acceptable answers.\nYOUR TURN2.6\nFor each series of premises, draw a logical conclusion to the argument that includes one of the following quantifiers:\nall, some, or none.\n1. , , and . Of these, 1 and 2 are consecutive integers, 5 and 6 are consecutive\nintegers, and 14 and 15 are consecutive integers. Also, their sums, 3, 11, and 29 are all prime numbers. Prime\nnumbers are positive integers greater than one that are only divisible by one and the number itself. What\nconclusion can you draw from these premises?\n2. A robin is a bird that lays blue eggs. A chicken is a bird that typically lays white and brown eggs. An ostrich is a\nbird that lays exceptionally large eggs. If a bird lays eggs, then they do not give live birth to their young. What\nconclusion can you draw from these premises?\n3. All parallelograms have four sides. All rectangles are parallelograms. All squares are rectangles. What\nadditional conclusion can you make about squares from these premises?\nIt is not possible to prove definitively that an inductive argument is true or false in most cases.\nNegating Statements Containing Quantifiers\nRecall that the negation of a statement will have the opposite truth value of the original statement. There are four basic\nforms that logical statements with quantifiers take on.\n\u2022 All are . 66 2 \u2022 Logic\n\u2022 Some are .\n\u2022 No are .\n\u2022 Some are not .\nThe negation of logical statements that use the quantifiersall,some, ornoneis a little more complicated than just\nadding or removing the wordnot.\nFor example, consider the logical statement, \u201cAll oranges are citrus fruits.\u201d This statement expresses as a subset\nrelationship. The set of oranges is a subset of the set of citrus fruit. This means that there are no oranges that are\noutside the set of citrus fruit. The negation of this statement would have to break the subset relationship. To do this, you\ncould say, \u201cAt least one orange is not a citrus fruit.\u201d Or, more concisely, \u201cSome oranges are not citrus fruit.\u201d It is tempting\nto say \"No oranges are citrus fruit,\" but that would be incorrect. Such a statement would go beyond breaking the subset\nrelationship, to stating that the two sets have nothing in common. The negation of \" is a subset of \" would be to state\nthat \" is not a subset of ,\" as depicted by the Venn diagram inFigure 2.4.\nFigure2.4\nThe statement, \u201cAll oranges are citrus fruit,\u201d is true, so its negation, \u201cSome oranges are not citrus fruit,\u201d is false.\nNow, consider the statement, \u201cNo apples are oranges.\u201d This statement indicates that the set of apples is disjointed from\nthe set of oranges. The negation must state that the two are not disjoint sets, or that the two sets have a least one\nmember in common. Their intersection is not empty. The negation of the statement, \u201c intersection is the empty set,\u201d\nis the statement that \" intersection is not empty,\" as depicted in the Venn diagram inFigure 2.5.\nFigure2.5\nThe negation of the true statement \u201cNo apples are oranges,\u201d is the false statement, \u201cSome apples are oranges.\u201d\nTable 2.2summarizes the four different forms of logical statements involving quantifiers and the forms of their\nassociated negations, as well as the meanings of the relationships between the two categories or sets and .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 Statements and Quantifiers 67\nLogical Statements with Quantifiers Negation of Logical Statements w/Quantifiers\nForm: All are .

The statement \u201cAll leopards have spots\u201d is and has the form \u201cAll are .\u201d According toTable 2.2, the negation will\nhave the form \u201cSome are not .\u201d The negation of is the statement, \u201cSome leopards do not have spots.\u201d\n2. The statement \u201cSome apples are red\u201d has the form \u201cSome are .\u201d This indicates that the categories and\noverlap or intersect. According toTable 2.2, the negation will have the form, \u201cNo are ,\u201d indicating that and\ndo not intersect. This results in the opposite truth value of the original statement, so the negation of \u201cSome apples\nare red\u201d is the statement: \u201cNo apples are red.\u201d\n3. Because is the statement: \u201cNo lemons are sweet,\u201d is asserting that the set of lemons does not intersect with the\nset of sweet things. The negation of , , must make the opposite claim. It must indicate that the set of lemons\nintersects with the set of sweet things. This means at least one lemon must be sweet. The statement, \u201cSome lemons\nare sweet\u201d is . The negation of the statement, \u201cNo are ,\u201d is the statement, \u201cSome are ,\u201d as indicated in\nTable 2.2. 68 2 \u2022 Logic\nYOUR TURN2.7\nGiven the statements:\n: Some apples are not sweet.\n: No triangles are squares.\n: Some vegetables are green.

A compound statement can be used to explain\nperformance on both tests at once. (credit: modification of work \u201cDrivers License -Teen driver\u201d by State Farm/Flickr, CC BY\n2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Translate compound statements into symbolic form.\n2. Translate compound statements in symbolic form with parentheses into words.\n3. Apply the dominance of connectives.\nSuppose your friend is trying to get a license to drive. In most places, they will need to pass some form of written test\nproving their knowledge of the laws and rules for driving safely. After passing the written test, your friend must also pass\na road test to demonstrate that they can perform the physical task of driving safely within the rules of the law.\nConsider the statement: \"My friend passed the written test, but they did not pass the road test.\" This is an example of a\ncompound statement, a statement formed by using aconnectiveto join two independent clauses or logical\nstatements. The statement, \u201cMy friend passed the written test,\u201d is an independent clause because it is a complete\nthought or idea that can stand on its own. The second independent clause in this compound statement is, \u201cMy friend did\nnot pass the road test.\u201d The word \"but\" is the connective used to join these two statements together, forming a\ncompound statement. So, did your friend acquire their driving license?.\nThis section introduces common logical connectives and their symbols, and allows you to practice translating compound\nstatements between words and symbols. It also explores the order of operations, or dominance of connectives, when a\nsingle compound statement uses multiple connectives.\nCommon Logical Connectives\nUnderstanding the following logical connectives, along with their properties, symbols, and names, will be key to applying\nthe topics presented in this chapter. The chapter will discuss each connective introduced here in more detail.\nThe joining of two logical statements with the word \"and\" or \"but\" forms a compound statement called aconjunction. In\nlogic, for a conjunction to be true, all the independent logical statements that make it up must be true. The symbol for a\nconjunction is . Consider the compound statement, \u201cDerek Jeter played professional baseball for the New York Yankees,\nand he was a shortstop.\u201d If represents the statement, \u201cDerrick Jeter played professional baseball for the New York\nYankees,\u201d and if represents the statement, \u201cDerrick Jeter was a short stop,\u201d then the conjunction will be written\nsymbolically as\nThe joining of two logical statements with the word \u201cor\u201d forms a compound statement called adisjunction. Unless\notherwise specified, a disjunction is an inclusiveorstatement, which means the compound statement formed by joining\ntwo independent clauses with the wordorwill be true if a least one of the clauses is true. Consider the compound\nstatement, \"The office manager ordered cake for for an employee\u2019s birthday or they ordered ice cream.\u201d This is a\ndisjunction because it combines the independent clause, \u201cThe office manager ordered cake for an employee\u2019s birthday,\u201d\nwith the independent clause, \u201cThe office manager ordered ice cream,\u201d using the connective,or. This disjunction is true if\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Compound Statements 71\nthe office manager ordered only cake, only ice cream, or they ordered both cake and ice cream. Inclusiveormeans you\ncan have one, or the other, or both!\nJoining two logical statements with the wordimplies, or using the phrase \u201ciffirst statement, thensecond statement,\u201dis\ncalled aconditionalorimplication. The clause associated with the \"if\" statement is also called thehypothesisor\nantecedent, while the clause following the \"then\" statement or the wordimpliesis called theconclusionorconsequent.\nThe conditional statement is like a one-way contract or promise. The only time the conditional statement is false, is if the\nhypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. Consider the following conditional statement, \u201cIf Pedro does his\nhomework, then he can play video games.\u201d The hypothesis/antecedent is the statement following the wordif, which is\n\u201cPedro does/did his homework.\u201d The conclusion/consequent is the statement following the wordthen, which is \u201cPedro\ncan play his video games.\u201d\nJoining two logical statements with the connective phrase \u201cif and only if\u201d is called abiconditional. The connective phrase\n\"if and only if\" is represented by the symbol, In the biconditional statement, is called the hypothesis or\nantecedent and is called the conclusion or consequent. For a biconditional statement to be true, the truth values of\nand must match. They must both be true, or both be false.\nThe table below lists the most common connectives used in logic, along with their symbolic forms, and the common\nnames used to describe each connective.\nConnective Symbol Name\nand conjunction\nbut\nor disjunction, inclusive or\nnot ~ negation\nif , then implies conditional, implication\nif and only if biconditional\nTable2.3\nThese connectives, along with their names, symbols, and properties, will be used throughout this chapter and\nshould be memorized.\nEXAMPLE2.8\nAssociate Connectives with Symbols and Names\nFor each of the following connectives, write its name and associated symbol.\n1. or\n2. implies\n3. but\nSolution\n1. A compound statement formed with the connective wordoris called a disjunction, and it is represented by the\nsymbol.\n2. A compound statement formed with the connective wordimpliesor phrase \u201cif \u2026, then\u201dis called a conditional\nstatement or implication and is represented by the symbol.\n3. A compound statement formed with the connective wordsbutorandis called a conjunction, and it is represented\nby the symbol. 72 2 \u2022 Logic\nYOUR TURN2.8\nFor each connective write its name and associated symbol.\n1. not\n2. and\n3. if and only if\nTranslating Compound Statements to Symbolic Form\nTo translate a compound statement into symbolic form, we take the following steps.\n1. Identify and label all independent affirmative logical statements with a lower case letter, such as , , or .\n2. Identify and label any negative logical statements with a lowercase letter preceded by the negation symbol, such as\n, , or .\n3. Replace the connective words with the symbols that represent them, such as\nConsider the previous example of your friend trying to get their driver\u2019s license. Your friend passed the written test, but\nthey did not pass the road test. Let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend passed the written test.\u201d And, let represent\nthe statement, \u201cMy friend did not pass the road test.\u201d Because the connectivebutis logically equivalent to the wordand,\nthe symbol forbutis the same as the symbol forand; replacebutwith the symbol The compound statement is\nsymbolically written as: . My friend passed the written test, but they did not pass the road test.\nWhen translating English statements into symbolic form, do not assume that every connective \u201cand\u201d means you are\ndealing with a compound statement. The statement, \u201cThe stripes on the U.S. flag are red and white,\u201d is a simple\nstatement. The word \u201cwhite\u201d doesn\u2019t express a complete thought, so it is not an independent clause and does not\nget its own symbol. This statement should be represented by a single letter, such as : The stripes on the U.S. flag\nare red and white.\nEXAMPLE2.9\nTranslating Compound Statements into Symbolic Form\nLet represent the statement, \u201cIt is a warm sunny day,\u201d and let represent the statement, \u201cthe family will go to the\nbeach.\u201d Write the symbolic form of each of the following compound statements.\n1. If it is a warm sunny day, then the family will go to the beach.\n2. The family will go to the beach, and it is a warm sunny day.\n3. The family will not go to the beach if and only if it is not a warm sunny day.\n4. The family not go to the beach, or it is a warm sunny day.\nSolution\n1.

Today we will go skiing, but last night it did not snow.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Compound Statements 73\n2. Today we will go skiing if and only if it snowed last night.\n3. Last night is snowed or today we will not go skiing.\n4. If it snowed last night, then today we will go skiing.\nTranslating Compound Statements in Symbolic Form with Parentheses into Words\nWhen parentheses are written in a logical argument, they group a compound statement together just like when\ncalculating numerical or algebraic expressions. Any statement in parentheses should be treated as a single component\nof the expression. If multiple parentheses are present, work with the inner most parentheses first.\nConsider your friend\u2019s struggles to get their license to drive. Let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend passed the written\ntest,\u201d let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend passed the road test,\u201d and let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend\nreceived a driver\u2019s license.\u201d The statement can be translated into words as follows: the statement is\ngrouped together to form the hypothesis of the conditional statement and is the conclusion. The conditional statement\nhas the form \u201cif then \u201d Therefore, the written form of this statement is: \u201cIf my friend passed the written test and\nthey passed the road test, then my friend received a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\nSometimes a compound statement within parentheses may need to be negated as a group. To accomplish this, add the\nphrase, \u201cit is not the case that\u201d before the translation of the phrase in parentheses. For example, using , , and of your\nfriend obtaining a license, let\u2019s translate the statement into words.\nIn this case, the hypothesis of the conditional statement is and the conclusion is To negate the hypothesis,\nadd the phrase \u201cit is not the case\u201d before translating what is in parentheses. The translation of the hypothesis is the\nsentence, \u201cIt is not the case that my friend passed the written test and they passed the road test,\u201d and the translation of\nthe conclusion is, \u201cMy friend did not receive a driver\u2019s license.\u201d So, a translation of the complete conditional statement,\nis: \u201cIf it is not the case that my friend passed the written test and the road test, then my friend did not\nreceive a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\nIt is acceptable to interchange proper names with pronouns and remove repeated phrases to make the written\nstatement more readable, as long the meaning of the logical statement is not changed.\nVIDEO\nLogic Part 1B: Compound Statements, Connectives and Symbols(https://openstax.org/r/Compound_Statements)\nEXAMPLE2.10\nTranslating Compound Statements in Symbolic Form with Parentheses into Words\nLet represent the statement, \u201cMy child finished their homework,\u201d let represent the statement, \u201cMy child cleaned her\nroom,\u201d let represent the statement, \u201cMy child played video games,\u201d and let represent the statement, \u201cMy child\nstreamed a movie.\u201d Translate each of the following symbolic statements into words.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. Replace ~ with \u201cIt is not the case,\u201d and with \u201cand.\u201d One possible translation is: \u201cIt is not the case that my child\nfinished their homework and cleaned their room.\u201d\n2. The hypothesis of the conditional statement is, \u201cMy child finished their homework and cleaned their room.\u201d The\nconclusion of the conditional statement is, \u201cMy child played video games or streamed a movie.\u201d One possible\ntranslation of the entire statement is: \u201cIf my child finished their homework and cleaned their room, then they played\nvideo games or streamed a movie.\u201d\n3. The hypothesis of the biconditional statement is and is written in words as: \u201cIt is not the case that my child\nplayed video games or streamed a movie.\u201d The conclusion of the biconditional statement is , which\ntranslates to: \u201cIt is not the case that my child finished their homework and cleaned their room.\u201d Because the\nbiconditional, translates toif and only if, one possible translation of the statement is: \u201cIt is not the case that my\nchild played video games or streamed a movie if and only if it is not the case that my child finished their homework\nand cleaned their room.\u201d 74 2 \u2022 Logic\nYOUR TURN2.10\nLet represent the statement, \u201cMy roommates ordered pizza,\u201d let represent the statement, \u201cI ordered wings,\u201d and\nlet be the statement, \u201cOur friends came over to watch the game.\u201d Translate the following statements into words.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nThe Dominance of Connectives\nThe order of operations for working with algebraic and arithmetic expressions provides a set of rules that allow\nconsistent results. For example, if you were presented with the problem , and you were not familiar with the\norder of operation, you might assume that you calculate the problem from left to right. If you did so, you would add 1\nand 3 to get 4, and then multiply this answer by 2 to get 8, resulting in an incorrect answer. Try inputting this expression\ninto a scientific calculator. If you do, the calculator should return a value of 7, not 8.\nScientific Calculator(https://openstax.org/r/Scientific_Calculator)\nThe order of operations for algebraic and arithmetic operations states that all multiplication must be applied prior to any\naddition. Parentheses are used to indicate which operation\u2014addition or multiplication\u2014should be done first. Adding\nparentheses can change and/or clarify the order. The parentheses in the expression indicate that 3 should be\nmultiplied by 2 to get 6, and then 1 should be added to 6 to get 7:\nAs with algebraic expressions, there is a set of rules that must be applied to compound logical statements in order to\nevaluate them with consistent results. This set of rules is called thedominance of connectives. When evaluating\ncompound logical statements, connectives are evaluated from least dominant to most dominant as follows:\n1. Parentheses are the least dominant connective. So, any expression inside parentheses must be evaluated first. Add\nas many parentheses as needed to any statement to specify the order to evaluate each connective.\n2. Next, we evaluate negations.\n3. Then, we evaluate conjunctions and disjunctions from left to right, because they have equal dominance.\n4. After evaluating all conjunctions and disjunctions, we evaluate conditionals.\n5. Lastly, we evaluate the most dominant connective, the biconditional. If a statement includes multiple connectives of\nequal dominance, then we will evaluate them from left to right.\nSeeFigure 2.7for a visual breakdown of the dominance of connectives.\nFigure2.7\nLet\u2019s revisit your friend\u2019s struggles to get their driver\u2019s license. Let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend passed the\nwritten test,\u201d let represent the statement, \u201cMy friend passed the road test,\u201d and let represent the statement, \u201cMy\nfriend received a driver\u2019s license.\u201d Let's use the dominance of connectives to determine how the compound statement\nshould be evaluated.\nStep 1:There are no parentheses, which is least dominant of all connectives, so we can skip over that.\nStep 2:Because negation is the next least dominant, we should evaluate first. We could add parentheses to the\nstatement to make it clearer which connecting needs to be evaluated first: is equivalent to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Compound Statements 75\nStep 3:Next, we evaluate the conjunction, . is equivalent to\nStep 4:Finally, we evaluate the conditional, as this is the most dominant connective in this compound statement.\nWHO KNEW?\nWhen using spreadsheet applications, like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, have you noticed that core functions,\nsuch as sum, average, or rate, have the same name and syntax for use? This is not a coincidence. Various standards\norganizations have developed requirements that software developers must implement to meet the conditions set by\ngovernments and large customers worldwide. The OpenDocument Format OASIS Standard enables transferring data\nbetween different office productivity applications and was approved by the International Standards Organization\n(ISO) and IEC on May 6, 2006.\nPrior to adopting these standards, a government entity, business, or individual could lose access to their own data\nsimply because it was saved in a format no longer supported by a proprietary software product\u2014even data they were\nrequired by law to preserve, or data they simply wished to maintain access to.\nJust as rules for applying the dominance of connectives help maintain understanding and consistency when writing\nand interpreting compound logical statements and arguments, the standards adopted for database software\nmaintain global integrity and accessibility across platforms and user bases.\nEXAMPLE2.11\nApplying the Dominance of Connectives\nFor each of the following compound logical statements, add parentheses to indicate the order to evaluate the statement.\nRecall that parentheses are evaluated innermost first.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. Because negation is the least dominant connective, we evaluate it first: Because conjunction and\ndisjunction have the same dominance, we evaluate them left to right. So, we evaluate the conjunction next, as\nindicated by the additional set of parentheses: The only remaining connective is the disjunction, so it\nis evaluated last, as indicated by the third set of parentheses. The complete solution is:\n2. Negation has the lowest dominance, so it is evaluated first: The remaining connectives are the\nconditional and the conjunction. Because conjunction has a lower precedence than the conditional, it is evaluated\nnext, as indicated by the second set of parentheses: The last step is to evaluate the conditional, as\nindicated by the third set of parentheses:\n3. This statement is known as De Morgan\u2019s Law for the negation of a disjunction. It is always true.Section 2.6of this\nchapter will explore De Morgan\u2019s Laws in more detail.\n\u25e6 First, we evaluate the negations on the right side of the biconditional prior to the conjunction.\n\u25e6 Then, we evaluate the disjunction on the left side of the biconditional, followed by the negation of the disjunction\non the left side.\n\u25e6 Lastly, after completely evaluating each side of the biconditional, we evaluate the biconditional. It does not\nmatter which side you begin with.\nThe final solution is:\nYOUR TURN2.11\nFor each of the following compound logical statements, add parentheses to indicate the order in which to evaluate\nthe statement. Recall that parentheses are evaluated innermost first.\n1.\n2. 76 2 \u2022 Logic\n3.\nWORK IT OUT\nLogic Terms and Properties \u2013 Matching Game\nMaterials: For every group of four students, include 30 cards (game, trading, or playing cards), 30 individual clear\nplastic gaming card sleeves, and 30 card-size pieces of paper. Prepare a list of 60 questions and answers ahead of\ntime related to definitions and problems inStatements and QuantifiersandCompound Statements. Provide each\ngroup of four students with 20 questions and their associated answers. Instruct each group to select 15 of the 20\nquestions, and then, for each problem selected, create one card with the question and one card with the answer.\nInstruct the groups to then place each problem and answer in a separate card sleeve. Once they create 15 problem\ncards and 15 answer cards, have students shuffle the set of cards.\nTo play the game, groups should exchange their card decks to ensure no team begins playing with the deck that they\ncreated. Split each four-person group into teams of two students. After shuffling the cards, one team lays cards face\ndown on their desk in a five-by-six grid. The other team will go first.\nEach player will have a turn to try matching the question with the correct answer by flipping two cards to the face up\nposition. If a team makes a match, they get to flip another two cards; if they do not get a match, they flip the cards\nface down and it is the other team\u2019s turn to flip over two cards. The game continues in this manner until teams match\nall question cards with their corresponding answer cards. The team with the most set of matching cards wins.\nIn the first module of this chapter, we evaluated the truth value of negations. In the following modules, we will discuss\nhow to evaluate conjunctions, disjunctions, conditionals, and biconditionals, and then evaluate compound logical\nstatements using truth tables and our knowledge of the dominance of connectives.\nCheck Your Understanding\n9.

(credit: modification of work \u201cDeadline Xmas 2010\u201d by Allan Henderson/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Interpret and apply negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n2. Construct a truth table using negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions.\n3. Construct a truth table for a compound statement and interpret its validity.\nAre you familiar with the Choose Your Own Adventure book series written by Edward Packard? These gamebooks allow\nthe reader to become one of the characters and make decisions that affect what happens next, resulting in different\nsequences of events in the story and endings based on the choices made. Writing a computer program is a little like\nwhat it must be like to write one of these books. The programmer must consider all the possible inputs that a user can\nput into the program and decide what will happen in each case, then write their program to account for each of these\npossible outcomes.\nAtruth tableis a graphical tool used to analyze all the possible truth values of the component logical statements to\ndetermine the validity of a statement or argument along with all its possible outcomes. The rows of the table correspond\nto each possible outcome for the given logical statement identified at the top of each column. A single logical statement\nhas two possible truth values, true or false. In truth tables, a capital T will represent true values, and a capital F will\nrepresent false values.\nIn this section, you will use the knowledge built inStatements and QuantifiersandCompound Statementsto analyze\narguments and determine their truth value and validity. A logical argument is valid if its conclusion follows from its\npremises, regardless of whether those premises are true or false. You will then explore the truth tables for negation,\nconjunction, and disjunction, and use these truth tables to analyze compound logical statements containing these\nconnectives.\nInterpret and Apply Negations, Conjunctions, and Disjunctions\nThe negation of a statement will have the opposite truth value of the original statement. When is true, is false, and\nwhen is false, is true.\nEXAMPLE2.12\nFinding the Truth Value of a Negation\nFor each logical statement, determine the truth value of its negation.\n1. :\n2. : All horses are mustangs.\n3. : New Delhi is not the capital of India.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.3 \u2022 Constructing Truth Tables 79\nSolution\n1. is true because 3 + 5 does equal 8; therefore, the negation of , , is false.\n2. is false because there are other types of horses besides mustangs, such as Clydesdales or Arabians; therefore, the\nnegation of , , is true.\n3. is false because New Delhi is the capital of India; therefore, the negation of , , is true.\nYOUR TURN2.12\nFor each logical statement, determine the truth value of its negation.\n1. : .\n2. : Some houses are built with bricks.\n3. : Abuja is the capital of Nigeria.\nA conjunction is a logicalandstatement. For a conjunction to be true, both statements that make up the conjunction\nmust be true. If at least one of the statements is false, theandstatement is false.\nEXAMPLE2.13\nFinding the Truth Value of a Conjunction\nGiven and determine the truth value of each conjunction.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. is true, and is false. Because one statement is true, and the other statement is false, this makes the complete\nconjunction false.\n2. is false, so is true, and is true. Therefore, both statements are true, making the complete conjunction true.\n3. is false, and is false. Because both statements are false, the complete conjunction is false.\nYOUR TURN2.13\nGiven : Yellow is a primary color, : Blue is a primary color, and : Green is a primary color, determine the truth value\nof each conjunction.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nThe only time a conjunction is true is if both statements that make up the conjunction are true.\nA disjunction is a logical inclusiveorstatement, which means that a disjunction is true if one or both statements that\nform it are true. The only way a logical inclusiveorstatement is false is if both statements that form the disjunction are\nfalse.\nEXAMPLE2.14\nFinding the Truth Value of a Disjunction\nGiven and determine the truth value of each disjunction.\n1.\n2.\n3. 80 2 \u2022 Logic\nSolution\n1. is true, and is false. One statement is true, and one statement is false, which makes the complete disjunction\ntrue.\n2. is false, so is true, and is true. Therefore, one statement is true, and the other statement is true, which makes\nthe complete disjunction true.\n3. is false, and is false. When all of the component statements are false, the disjunction is false.\nYOUR TURN2.14\nGiven : Yellow is a primary color, : Blue is a primary color, and : Green is a primary color, determine the truth value\nof each disjunction.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nIn the next example, you will apply the dominance of connectives to find the truth values of compound statements\ncontaining negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions and use a table to record the results. When constructing a truth\ntable to analyze an argument where you can determine the truth value of each component statement, the strategy is to\ncreate a table with two rows. The first row contains the symbols representing the components that make up the\ncompound statement. The second row contains the truth values of each component below its symbol. Include as many\ncolumns as necessary to represent the value of each compound statement. The last column includes the complete\ncompound statement with its truth value below it.\nVIDEO\nLogic Part 2: Truth Values of Conjunctions: Is an \"AND\" statement true or false?(https://openstax.org/r/\nTruth_Values_of_Conjunctions)\nLogic Part 3: Truth Values of Disjunctions: Is an \"OR\" statement true or false?(https://openstax.org/r/\nTruth_Values_of_Disjunctions)\nEXAMPLE2.15\nFinding the Truth Value of Compound Statements\nGiven and construct a truth table to determine the truth value of each\ncompound statement\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1.

To create a truth table for the negation of statement , add a column with a heading of , and for each row,\ninput the truth value with the opposite value of the value listed in the column for , as depicted in the table below. 82 2 \u2022 Logic\nNegation\nT F\nF T\nConjunctions and disjunctions are compound statements formed when two logical statements combine with the\nconnectives \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d respectively. How does that change the number of possible outcomes and thus determine the\nnumber of rows in our truth table? Themultiplication principle, also known as thefundamental counting principle,\nstates that the number of ways you can select an item from a group of items and another item from a group with\nitems is equal to the product of and . Because each proposition and has two possible outcomes, true or false, the\nmultiplication principle states that there will be possible outcomes: {TT, TF, FT, FF}.\nThe tree diagram and table inFigure 2.9demonstrate the four possible outcomes for two propositions and .\nFigure2.9\nA conjunction is a logicalandstatement.

Use and apply the conditional to construct a truth table.\n2. Use and apply the biconditional to construct a truth table.\n3. Use truth tables to determine the validity of conditional and biconditional statements.\nComputer languages use if-then or if-then-else statements as decision statements:\n\u2022 Ifthe hypothesis is true,thendo something.\n\u2022 Or,ifthe hypothesis is true,thendo something; else do something else.\nFor example, the following representation of computer code creates an if-then-else decision statement:\nCheck value of variable .\nIf , then print \"Hello, World!\" else print \"Goodbye\".\nIn this imaginary program, the if-then statement evaluates and acts on the value of the variable . For instance, if ,\nthe program would consider the statement as true and \u201cHello, World!\u201d would appear on the computer screen. If\ninstead, , the program would consider the statement as false (because 3 is greater than 1), and print\n\u201cGoodbye\u201d on the screen.\nIn this section, we will apply similar reasoning without the use of computer programs.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nThe Countess of Lovelace, Ada Lovelace, is credited with writing the first computer program. She wrote an algorithm\nto work with Charles Babbage\u2019s Analytical Engine that could compute the Bernoulli numbers in 1843. In doing so, she\nbecame the first person to write a program for a machine that would produce more than just a simple calculation.\nThe computer programming language ADA is named after her.\nReference: Posamentier, Alfred and Spreitzer Christian, \u201cChapter 34 Ada Lovelace: English (1815-1852)\u201d pp. 272-278,\nMath Makers: The Lives and Works of 50 Famous Mathematicians, Prometheus Books, 2019. 88 2 \u2022 Logic\nUse and Apply the Conditional to Construct a Truth Table\nAconditionalis a logical statement of the form if , then . The conditional statement in logic is a promise or contract.\nThe only time the conditional, is false is when the contract or promise is broken.\nFor example, consider the following scenario. A child\u2019s parent says, \u201cIf you do your homework, then you can play your\nvideo games.\u201d The child really wants to play their video games, so they get started right away, finish within an hour, and\nthen show their parent the completed homework. The parent thanks the child for doing a great job on their homework\nand allows them to play video games. Both the parent and child are happy. The contract was satisfied; true implies true is\ntrue.\nNow, suppose the child does not start their homework right away, and then struggles to complete it. They eventually\nfinish and show it to their parent. The parent again thanks the child for completing their homework, but then informs\nthe child that it is too late in the evening to play video games, and that they must begin to get ready for bed. Now, the\nchild is really upset. They held up their part of the contract, but they did not receive the promised reward. The contract\nwas broken; true implies false is false.\nSo, what happens if the child does not do their homework? In this case, the hypothesis is false. No contract has been\nentered, therefore, no contract can be broken. If the conclusion is false, the child does not get to play video games and\nmight not be happy, but this outcome is expected because the child did not complete their end of the bargain. They did\nnot complete their homework. False implies false is true. The last option is not as intuitive. If the parent lets the child\nplay video games, even if they did not do their homework, neither parent nor child are going to be upset. False implies\ntrue is true.\nThe truth table for the conditional statement below summarizes these results.\nT T T\nT F F\nF T T\nF F T\nNotice that the only time the conditional statement, is false is when the hypothesis, , is true and the\nconclusion, , is false.\nVIDEO\nLogic Part 8: The Conditional and Tautologies(https://openstax.org/r/Conditional_and_Tautologies)\nEXAMPLE2.18\nConstructing Truth Tables for Conditional Statements\nAssume both of the following statements are true: : My sibling washed the dishes, and : My parents paid them $5.00.\nCreate a truth table to determine the truth value of each of the following conditional statements.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.4 \u2022 Truth Tables for the Conditional and Biconditional 89\nSolution\n1.

Write the converse of the statement in words and determine its truth value.\n2. Write the inverse of the statement in words and determine its truth value.\n3. Write the contrapositive of the statement in words and determine its truth value.\nSolution\n1. The only way the conditional statement can be false is if the hypothesis, : Chadwick Boseman was an actor, is true\nand the conclusion, : Chadwick Boseman did not star in the movieBlack Panther, is false. The converse is\nand it is written in words as: \u201cIf Chadwick Boseman did not star in the movieBlack Panther, then Chadwick Boseman\nwas an actor.\u201d This statement is true, because false true is true.\n2. The inverse has the form \u201c \u201d The written form is: \u201cIf Chadwick Boseman was not an actor, then Chadwick\nBoseman starred in the movieBlack Panther.\u201d Because is true, and is false, is false, and is true. This means\nthe inverse is false true, which is true. Alternatively, from Question 1, the converse is true, and because the\ninverse is logically equivalent to the converse it must also be true.\n3. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the conditional. Because the conditional is false, the contrapositive is\nalso false. This can be confirmed by looking at the truth values of the contrapositive statement. The contrapositive\nhas the form \u201c .\u201d Because is false and is true, is true and is false.

Apply the law of detachment to determine the conclusion of a pair of statements.\n2. Apply the law of denying the consequent to determine the conclusion for pairs of statements.\n3. Apply the chain rule to determine valid conclusions for pairs of true statements.\nThe previous sections of this chapter provide the foundational skills for constructing and analyzing logical arguments. All\nlogical arguments include a set of premises that support a claim or conclusion; but not all logical arguments are valid\nand sound. A logical argument is valid if its conclusion follows from the premises, and it issoundif it is valid and all of its\npremises are true. A false or deceptive argument is called afallacy. Many types of fallacies are so common that they\nhave been named.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.7 \u2022 Logical Arguments 109\nWHO KNEW?\nIn 1936, Dale Carnegie published his first book, titledHow to Win Friends and Influence People. It was marketed as\ntraining materials for the improvement of public speaking and negotiation skills, and the methods it presented are\nstill used today. Carnegie famously said, \u201cWhen dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of\nlogic, but creatures of emotion.\u201d\nPeople who put forth fallacious logical arguments often take advantage of our susceptibility to emotional appeals, to\ntry to convince us that what they are saying is true. The study of logic helps us combat this weakness through\nrecognition and learning to focus on the facts and structure of the argument.\nThis section focuses on the two main forms that logical arguments can take. While inductive arguments attempt to draw\na more general conclusion from a pattern of specific premises,deductive argumentsattempt to draw specific\nconclusions from at least one or more general premises. Deductive arguments can be proven to be valid using Venn\ndiagrams or truth tables.\nInductive arguments generally cannot be proven to be true. They are judged as being strong or weak, but, like any\nopinion, whether you believe an argument is strong or weak often depends on your knowledge of the topic being\ndiscussed along with the evidence being provided in the premises.Hasty generalizationis the name given to any fallacy\nthat presents a weak inductive argument.\nBe careful! Premises may be true or false. If a premise is false, the claims made by the argument should be\nquestioned.\nLaw of Detachment\nThelaw of detachmentis a valid form of a conditional argument that asserts that if both the conditional, , and the\nhypothesis, , are true, then the conclusion must also be true. The law of detachment is also called affirming the\nhypothesis (or antecedent) and modus ponens. Symbolically, it has the form .\nLaw of Detachment\nPremise:\nPremise:\nConclusion:\nThe is read as the word, \u201ctherefore.\u201d\nLooking at the truth table for the conditional statement, the only time the conditional is true is when the hypothesis is\nalso true.

Consider the\nstatement \u201cIf you play guitar, then you are a musician.\u201d The set of guitarists is a subset of the set of musicians,\nTo verify that an argument is valid using a Venn diagram, draw the Venn diagram representing all the premises in\nthe argument only, as shown inFigure 2.15. Then verify if the conclusion is also represented by the Venn diagram of the\npremises. If it is, the argument is valid. If it is not, the argument is not valid. The set of guitarists is drawn as a subset of\nthe set of musicians to represent the premise, The represents the premise: is true. This completes the\ndrawing of the premises.\nFigure2.15\nNow, examine the Venn diagram to verify if the conclusion is included in the picture. The conclusion is . Because the is\nin the set , and is a subset of , is also in ; therefore, the law of detachment is a valid argument.\nRemember that an argument can be valid without being true. For the argument to be proven true, it must be both\nvalid and sound. An argument is sound if all its premises are true.\nVIDEO\nLogic Part 14: Common Argument Forms like Modus Ponens and Tollens(https://openstax.org/r/\nModus_Ponens_and_Tollens)\nEXAMPLE2.31\nApplying the Law of Detachment to Determine a Valid Conclusion\nEach pair of statements represents the premises in a logical argument.

The polygon has five sides.\nLaw of Denying the Consequent\nAnother form of a valid conditional argument is called thelaw of denying the consequent, or modus tollens. Recall,\nthat the conditional statement, , is logically equivalent to the contrapositive, So, if the conditional\nstatement is true, then the contrapositive statement is also true.

It is also called hypothetical\nsyllogism or the transitivity of implication. Recall that the conditional statement can also be read as implies .\nThis is where the nametransitivity of implicationcomes from. The transitive property for numbers states that, if\nand then it follows that The chain rule extends this property to conditional statements.

We need encryption (using prime numbers) for a secure exchange of information. For a prime\nnumber to be useful for encryption, though, it has to be large. Encryption uses a composite number that is the product\nof two very large primes. In order to break the encryption, one must determine the two primes that were used to form\nthe composite number. If the two prime numbers used are sufficiently large, even the fastest computer cannot\ndetermine those two prime numbers in a reasonable amount of time.

Encryption uses a composite number that is the product of two very large prime numbers. To break the\nencryption, the two primes that were used to form the composite number need to be determined. If the two prime\nnumbers used are sufficiently large, even the fastest computer cannot determine those two prime numbers in a\nreasonable amount of time. It would take a computer 300 trillion years to crack the current encryption standard.\nApplying Divisibility Rules\nBefore we begin our investigation of divisibility, we need to know some facts about important sets of numbers:\n\u2022 The counting numbers are referred to as thenatural numbers. This set of numbers, , is denoted with\nthe symbol\u2115.\n\u2022 Another important set of numbers is theintegers. The integers are the natural numbers, along with 0, and the\nnegatives of the natural numbers. This set is often written as . We denote the integers\nwith the symbol \u2124.\n\u2022 Notice that \u2115 is a proper subset of \u2124, or, \u2115 \u2282 \u2124. All the ideas of this section apply to the natural numbers, while only\nsome apply to all the integers.\nDivisibilityis when the integer is divisible by , if can be written as times another integer. Equivalently, there is no\nremainder when is divided by . There are many occasions when separating items into equal groups comes into play\nto ensure an equal distribution of whole items. For example, Francis, a preschool art teacher, has 15 students in one\nclass. Francis has 225 sheets of construction paper and wants to provide each student with an equal number of pieces.\nTo know if he will use all the construction paper, Francis is really asking if 225 can be evenly divided into 15 groups.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 Prime and Composite Numbers 129\nEXAMPLE3.1\nDetermining if a Number Divides Another Number\nDetermine if 36 is divisible by 4.\nSolution\nWe could divide 36 by 4 and see if there is a remainder, or we could see if we can write 36 as 4 times another integer. If\nwe divide 36 by 4, we see with no remainder. We see that 36 is divisible by 4. We can write 36 as 4 times\nanother integer, . By the definition of divisibility, 36 is divisible by 4.\nYOUR TURN3.1\n1. Determine if 54 is divisible by 9.\nYou can quickly check if a number is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 12.

The divisibility rule for 6 is that the\nnumber passes the divisibility rules for both 2 and 3. Since the last digit is even, 298 is divisible by 2. To determine if 298\nis divisible by 3, we first add the digits of the number: . Since 19 is not divisible by 3, neither is 298.\nBecause 298 is not divisible by 3, it is also not divisible by 6, which means they cannot be put into 6 equal stacks of coins.\nYOUR TURN3.4\n1.

For instance, 7 and 19 areprime. In other\nwords, there is no way to divide a prime number into groups with an equal number of things, unless there is only one\ngroup, or those groups have one item per group. Other natural numbers have more than two unique divisors, such as 4,\nor 26. These numbers are calledcomposite. The number 1 is special; it is neither prime nor composite.\nTo determine if a number is prime or composite, you have to determine if the number has any divisors other than 1 and\nitself. The divisibility rules are useful here, and can quickly show you if a number has a divisor on that list.\nHowever, if none of those divide the number, you still have to check all other possible prime divisors. What are the prime\nnumbers that are possibly divisors of the number you are checking? You need only check the prime numbers up to the\nsquare root of the number in question. For instance, if you want to know if 2,117 is prime, you need to determine if any\nprimes up to the square root of 2,117 (which is 46.0 when rounded to one decimal place) divide 2,117. If any of those\nprimes are divisors of the number in question, then the number is composite. If none of those primes work, then the\nnumber is itself prime.\nWe can check divisibility with whatever tool we wish. Divisibility rules are quick for some prime divisors (2 and 5 come to\nmind) but aren't quick for other values (like 11). In place of divisibility rules, we could just use a calculator. If the prime\nnumber divides the number evenly (that is, there is no decimal or fractional part), then the number is divisible by that\nprime.Table 3.1is a quick list of the prime numbers up to 50. There are 15 prime numbers less than 50.\n2 3 5 7 11\n13 17 19 23 29\n31 37 41 43 47\nTable3.1Prime Numbers\nLess than 50\nEXAMPLE3.7\nDetermining If a Number Is Prime or Composite\nDetermine if 2,117 is prime or composite.\nSolution\nThe square root of 2,117 is 46.0 (rounded to one decimal place). So, we need to check if 2,117 is divisible by any prime up\nto 46.\nStep 1:First we\u2019ll use the rules of divisibility we learned earlier:\n\u2022 We can tell 2,117 is not divisible by 2, as the last digit isn't even.\n\u2022 2,117 is not divisible by 5 (the last digit isn't 0 or 5).\n\u2022 Add the digits of 2,117 to get 11, which is not divisible by 3. So, 2,117 is also not divisible by 3.\nStep 2:Now we repeat the process for all the primes up to 46. 132 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nUsing a calculator, we find that 2,117 divided by the prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23 results in a remainder, a\ndecimal part. So, we know that 2,117 is not divisible by these prime numbers. (You should check these results yourself.)\nMoving on, we check the next prime: 29. Using the calculator to divide 2,117 by 29 results in 73. Since there is no decimal\npart, 2,117 is divisible by 29.\nThis means that 2,117 is not a prime number, but rather, a composite number. Writing 2,117 as the product of 29 and\nanother natural number, .\nYOUR TURN3.7\n1.

So, we need to check if 423 is divisible by any prime up\nto 20.\nStep 1:Check 2. We can tell 423 is not divisible by 2, as the last digit isn't even.\nStep 2:Check 5. It is not divisible by 5 (the last digit isn't 0 or 5).\nStep 3:Check 3. To check if 423 is divisible by 3, we use the divisibility rule for 3. When we take the sum of the digits of\n423, the result is 9. Since 9 is divisible by 3, so is 423.\nSince 423 is divisible by 3, then 423 is a composite number.

It is it divisible by 5 (the last digit isn't 0 or 5).\nStep 3:Check 3. Using the divisibility rule for 3, we take the sum of the digits of 2,917, which is 19. Since 19 is not\ndivisible by 3, neither is 2,917.\nStep 4:Check the rest of the primes up to 50 using a calculator.

Clandestine study, hard and tenacious work, and a mathematical mindset did not lead to college,\nhowever, as she was not allowed to attend. She did manage, through friends, to obtain problem sets and submit\nbrilliant solutions under the name Monsieur LaBlanc. One of her great interests was number theory, which is the\nstudy of properties of integers. One of her theorems, titled \u201cSophie Germain\u2019s Theorem,\u201d partially solved one of the\ngreat mathematical mysteries, Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. From this she discovered what are now known as Sophie\nGermain Primes. A Sophie Germain Prime is a prime number that can be written in the form , where is a\nprime number. For instance, 23 is prime: , which is prime, so 47 is a Sophie Germain Prime. It should be\nnoted that , where is a prime number, may or may not be prime (check for !).\nFinding the Prime Factorization of Composite Numbers\nBefore we can start with prime factorization, let\u2019s remind ourselves what it means to factor a number. We factor a\nnumber by identifying two (or more) numbers that, when multiplied, result in the original number. For instance, 3 and\n24, when multiplied, give 72. So, 72 can be factored into . Notice that we could have factored the 72 differently, say\nas , or , or even as .\nFinding theprime factorizationof a composite number means writing the number as the product of all of its prime\nfactors. For example, . Notice that all the numbers being multiplied on the right-hand side are\nprime numbers. Sometimes prime numbers repeat themselves in the factorization. When prime factors do repeat, we\nmay write the prime factorization usingexponents, as in . In that equation, the 2 is raised to the 4th power.\nThe 4 is the exponent, and the 2 is thebase. More generally, in the exponent notation , the number represented by\nis the base, and the number represented by is the exponent.\nOne has to wonder if finding the prime factorization could result in different factorizations. TheFundamental Theorem\nof Arithmetictells us that there is only one prime factorization for a given natural number.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 Prime and Composite Numbers 135\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\nEvery natural number, other than 1, can be expressed in exactly one way, apart from the arrangement, as a product of\nprimes.\nThe process of finding the prime factorization of a number is iterative, which means we do a step, then repeat it until we\ncannot do the step any longer. The step we use is to identify one prime factor of the number, then write the number as\nthe prime factor times another factor. We repeat this step on the other, newly found, factor. This step is repeated until no\nmore primes can be factored from the remaining factor. This is easier to see and explain with an example.\nEXAMPLE3.11\nFinding the Prime Factorization\nFind the prime factorization of 140.\nSolution\nStep 1:Identify a prime number that divides 140. Since 140 is even (the last digit is even), 2 divides 140. We then factor\nthe 2 out of the 140, giving us .\nStep 2:With the other factor, 70, find a prime factor of 70. Since 70 is also even, 2 divides 70. We factor the 2 out of the\n70 and the factorization is now .\nNotice that we expressed the two factors of 2 as .\nStep 3:Look to the remaining factor, 35. The last digit of 35 is 5, so 5 is a factor of 35. We factor the 5 out of the 35. The\nfactorization is now .\nStep 4:Look to the remaining factor, 7. Since 7 is prime, the process is complete.\nThe prime factorization of 140 is .\nYOUR TURN3.11\n1.

If is composite, continue to the next step.\nStep 2:Identify two divisors of , call them and .\nStep 3:Write the number down, and draw two branches extending down (or to the right) of the number .\nStep 4:Label the end of one branch , the other as .

To ensure we are using full tiles, the side length of\nthe square tiles must divide the length of the room and the width of the room.

A common multiple of a set of numbers is a\nmultiple of each of those numbers.

You start at 0, and going to the left is going backward, or in the\nnegative direction, while going to the right is going forward, or in the positive direction. A number line (Figure 3.12)\nhelps envision the integers. This also means that an integer gives magnitude (size) and direction (positive is to the right,\nnegative is to the left). Graphing an integer on the number line means placing a solid dot at the integer on the number\nline.\nFigure3.12\nVIDEO\nGraphing Integers on the Number Line(https://openstax.org/r/Graphing_Integers)\nEXAMPLE3.27\nGraphing Numbers on the Number Line\nGraph the following on the number line:\n1. 1\n2. \u22124\n3. 3\nSolution\n1.\nFigure3.13\n2.\nFigure3.14\n3.\nFigure3.15\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 The Integers 151\nYOUR TURN3.27\nGraph the following numbers on the number line:\n1. \u221210\n2. 4\n3. 0\nComparing Integers\nWhen determining if one quantity or size is larger than another, we know it means there is more of whatever is being\ndiscussed. In terms of positive integers, we can envision that larger integers are further to the right on the number line.\nThis idea applies to negative integers also. This means that is greater than when is to the right of on the number\nline. We write . When is greater than , we can also say that is less than . On the number line, would be to\nthe left of . We write .\nWe need to recognize that means the same thing as . This can be seen on the number line inFigure 3.16. On\nthis number line, is to the right of , so .

So we can also write .\nWarning: People often ignore the negative signs, and think than since 6 is greater than 2, \u22126 is greater than \u22122.

Determine which of 101 and 98 is larger, and express that using both the greater than and the less than\nnotations.\nThe Absolute Value of an Integer\nWhen talking about graphing integers on the number line, one interpretation suggests it is like walking along a path.\nNegative is going to the left of 0, and positive going to the right. If you take 30 steps to the right, you are 30 steps away\nfrom 0. On the other hand, when you take 30 steps to the left, you are still 30 steps away from 0. So, in a way, even\nthough one is negative and the other positive, these two numbers, 30 and \u221230, are equal since both are 30 steps away\nfrom 0. Theabsolute value of an integer is the distance from to 0, regardless of the direction. The notation for\nabsolute value of the integer is .\nIf we think of an integer as both direction and magnitude (size), absolute value is the magnitude part.\nCalculating the absolute value of an integer is very straightforward. If the integer is positive, then the absolute value of\nthe integer is just the integer itself. If the integer is negative, then to compute the absolute value of the integer, simply\nremove the negative sign. Keeping in mind the number line as a path, when you\u2019ve gone 10 steps to the left of 0, you\nhave still taken 10 steps, and the direction does not matter.\nVIDEO\nEvaluating the Absolute Value of an Integer(https://openstax.org/r/Absolute_Value_of_an_Integer)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 The Integers 153\nEXAMPLE3.31\nCalculating the Absolute Value of a Positive Integer\nCalculate |19|.\nSolution\nSince the number inside the absolute value symbol is positive, the absolute value is just the number itself.

Calculate |\u221281|.\nAdding and Subtracting Integers\nYou may recall having approached adding and subtracting integers using the number line from earlier in your academic\nlife. Adding a positive integer results in moving to the right on the number line. Adding a negative integer results in\nmoving to the left. Subtracting a positive integer results in a move to the left on the number line. But subtracting a\nnegative integer results in a move to the right.\nThis leads to a few adding and subtracting rules, such as:\nRule 1:Subtracting a negative is the same as adding a positive.\nRule 2:Adding two negative integers always results in a negative integer.\nRule 3:Adding two positive integers always results in a positive integer.\nRule 4:The sign when adding integers with opposite signs is the same as the integer with the larger absolute value.\nThese rules are good to keep in the back of your mind, as they can serve as a quick error check when you use a\ncalculator.\nEXAMPLE3.33\nAdding Integers\nUse your calculator to calculate 4 + (\u22127). Explain how the answer agrees with what was expected.\nSolution\nUsing a calculator, we find that 4 + (\u22127) = \u22123.

Explain how the answer agrees with what was expected.\nSolution\nUsing a calculator, we find that 27 \u2013 (\u221213) = 40. Since we\u2019re subtracting a negative number, it is the same as adding a\npositive, so this is the same as 27 + 13 = 40.\nYOUR TURN3.35\n1. Use your calculator to calculate 45 \u2212 (\u221226).

Explain how the answer agrees with what was expected.\nSolution\nUsing a calculator, we find that (\u221213) + 90 = 77. Since we are adding integers with opposite signs, the sign of the answer\nmatches the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value, which is positive since 90 is positive.\nYOUR TURN3.36\n1.

What is Jennifer\u2019s net worth?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 The Integers 155\nSolution\nNet worth is the amount that one is owed minus the amount one owes. Jennifer is owed $50 but owes $87. So, her net\nworth is $50 \u2013 $87 = \u2212$37. The negative indicates that Jennifer owes more than she is owed.\nYOUR TURN3.37\n1.

There are only two rules.\nRule 1:When multiplying or dividing two integers with the same sign, the result is positive.\nRule 2:When multiplying or dividing two integers with opposite signs, the result is negative.\nJust as before, these rules can serve as a quick error check when using a calculator.\nEXAMPLE3.38\nMultiplying Positive Integers\nUse your calculator to calculate 4 \u00d7 8.

What was the average daily temperature for the week of February 14, 2021, in Barrie?\nSolution\nStep 1:To find the average daily temperature, we first need to add the temperatures.\n(\u221220) + (\u221212) + (\u221215) + (\u221223) + (\u221217) + (\u221213) + (\u221219) = \u2212119\nStep 2:That sum will then be divided by 7 since we are averaging over seven days, giving \u2212119/7 = \u221217.

However,\nthere may be expressions where a multiplication should happen before an exponent, or a subtraction before a division.\nTo indicate an operation should be performed out of order, the operation is placed inside parentheses. When\nparentheses are present, the operations inside the parentheses are performed first. Adding the parentheses to our list,\nwe now have PEMDAS, as shown below.\nP Parentheses\nE Exponents\nM/D Multiplication and division (division is just the multiplication by the reciprocal)\nA/S Addition and subtraction (subtraction is just the addition of the negative)\nAs said previously, parentheses indicate that some operation or operations will be performed outside the standard order\nof operation rules. For instance, perhaps you want to multiply 4 and 7 before squaring. To indicate that the multiplication\nhappens before the exponent, the multiplication is placed inside parentheses: .\nThis means operations inside the parentheses take precedence, or happen before other operations. Now, the first step in\ncalculating arithmetic expressions using the order of operations is to perform operations inside parentheses first. Inside\nthe parentheses, you follow the order of operation rules EMDAS.\nEXAMPLE3.49\nPrioritizing Parentheses in the Order of Operations\nCorrectly apply the rules for the order of operations to accurately compute the following:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Order of Operations 163\n.\nSolution\nStep 1:Perform all calculations within the parentheses before all other operations.\nStep 2:Since all parentheses have been cleared, move left to right, and compute all the exponents next.\nStep 3:Perform all multiplications and divisions moving left to right.\nYOUR TURN3.49\n1.

Use fractions to convert between units.\n11. Define and apply percent.\n12. Solve problems using percent.\nWe are often presented with percentages or fractions to explain how much of a population has a certain feature. For\nexample, the 6-year graduation rate of college students at public institutions is 57.6%, or 72/125. That fraction may be\nunsettling. But without the context, the percentage is hard to judge. So how does that compare to private institutions?\nThere, the 6-year graduation rate is 65.4%, or 327/500. Comparing the percentages is straightforward, but the fractions\nare harder to interpret due to different denominators. For more context, historical data could be found. One study\nreported that the 6-year graduation rate in 1995 was 56.4%. Comparing that historical number to the recent 6-year\ngraduation rate at public institutions of 57.6% shows that there hasn't been much change in that rate.\nDefining and Identifying Numbers That Are Rational\nArational number(called rational since it is a ratio) is just a fraction where the numerator is an integer and the\ndenominator is a non-zero integer. As simple as that is, they can be represented in many ways. It should be noted here\nthat any integer is a rational number. An integer, , written as a fraction of two integers is .\nIn its most basic representation, a rational number is an integer divided by a non-zero integer, such as . Fractions may 166 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nbe used to represent parts of a whole. The denominator is the total number of parts to the object, and the numerator is\nhow many of those parts are being used or selected. So, if a pizza is cut into 8 equal pieces, each piece is of the pizza.\nIf you take three slices, you have of the pizza (Figure 3.21). Similarly, if in a group of 20 people, 5 are wearing hats,\nthen of the people are wearing hats (Figure 3.22).\nFigure3.21Pizza cut in 8 slices, with 3 slices highlighted\nFigure3.22Group of 20 people, with 5 people wearing hats\nAnother representation of rational numbers is as a mixed number, such as (Figure 3.23). This represents a whole\nnumber (2 in this case), plus a fraction (the ).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.4 \u2022 Rational Numbers 167\nFigure3.23Two whole pizzas and one partial pizza\nRational numbers may also be expressed in decimal form; for instance, as 1.34. When 1.34 is written, the decimal part,\n0.34, represents the fraction , and the number 1.34 is equal to . However, not all decimal representations are\nrational numbers.\nA number written in decimal form where there is a last decimal digit (after a given decimal digit, all following decimal\ndigits are 0) is aterminating decimal, as in 1.34 above. Alternately, any decimal numeral that, after a finite number of\ndecimal digits, has digits equal to 0 for all digits following the last non-zero digit.\nAll numbers that can be expressed as a terminating decimal are rational. This comes from what the decimal represents.\nThe decimal part is the fraction of the decimal part divided by the appropriate power of 10. That power of 10 is the\nnumber of decimal digits present, as for 0.34, with two decimal digits, being equal to .\nAnother form that is a rational number is a decimal that repeats a pattern, such as 67.1313\u2026 When a rational number is\nexpressed in decimal form and the decimal is a repeated pattern, we use special notation to designate the part that\nrepeats. For example, if we have the repeating decimal 4.3636\u2026, we write this as . The bar over the 36 indicates that\nthe 36 repeats forever.\nIf the decimal representation of a number does not terminate or form a repeating decimal, that number is not a rational\nnumber.\nOne class of numbers that is not rational is thesquare rootsof integers or rational numbers that are notperfect\nsquares, such as and . More generally, the number is the square root of the number if . The\nnotation for this is , where the symbol is the square root sign. An integer perfect square is any integer that\ncan be written as the square of another integer. A rational perfect square is any rational number that can be written as a\nfraction of two integers that are perfect squares.\nSometimes you may be able to identify a perfect square from memory. Another process that may be used is to factor the\nnumber into the product of an integer with itself. Or a calculator (such as Desmos) may be used to find the square root\nof the number. If the calculator yields an integer, the original number was a perfect square.\nTECH CHECK\nUsing Desmos to Find the Square Root of a Number\nWhen Desmos is used, there is a tab at the bottom of the screen that opens the keyboard for Desmos. The keyboard\nis shown below. On the keyboard (Figure 3.24) is the square root symbol . To find the square root of a number,\nclick the square root key, and then type the number. Desmos will automatically display the value of the square root as\nyou enter the number. 168 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nFigure3.24Desmos keyboard with square root key\nEXAMPLE3.51\nIdentifying Perfect Squares\nWhich of the following are perfect squares?\n1. 45\n2. 144\nSolution\n1. We could attempt to find the perfect square by factoring. Writing all the factor pairs of 45 results in ,\nand . None of the pairs is a square, so 45 is not a perfect square. Using a calculator to find the square root of\n45, we obtain 6.708 (rounded to three decimal places). Since this was not an integer, the original number was not a\nperfect square.\n2. We could attempt to find the perfect square by factoring. Writing all the factor pairs of 144 results in\n, and . Since the last pair is an integer multiplied by itself, 144 is a\nperfect square. Alternately, using Desmos to find the square root of 144, we obtain 12. Since the square root of 144\nis an integer, 144 is a perfect square.\nYOUR TURN3.51\nDetermine if the following are perfect squares:\n1. 94\n2. 441\nVIDEO\nIntroduction to Fractions(https://openstax.org/r/Equivalent_Fractions)\nEXAMPLE3.52\nIdentifying Rational Numbers\nDetermine which of the following are rational numbers:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nSolution\n1.

As such, there may be multiple ways to express the\nsame value with different rational numbers. For instance, and are the same value. If we enter them into a\ncalculator, they both equal 0.8. Another way to understand this is to consider what it looks like in a figure when two\nfractions are equal.\nInFigure 3.25, we see that of the rectangle and of the rectangle are equal areas.\nFigure3.25Two Rectangles with Equal Areas\nThey are the same proportion of the area of the rectangle. The left rectangle has 5 pieces, three of which are shaded. The\nright rectangle has 15 pieces, 9 of which are shaded. Each of the pieces of the left rectangle was divided equally into\nthree pieces. This was a multiplication. The numerator describing the left rectangle was 3 but it becomes , or 9, as\neach piece was divided into three. Similarly, the denominator describing the left rectangle was 5, but became , or\n15, as each piece was divided into 3. The fractions and areequivalentbecause they represent the same portion\n(often loosely referred to as equal).\nThis understanding of equivalent fractions is very useful for conceptualization, but it isn\u2019t practical, in general, for\ndetermining when two fractions are equivalent. Generally, to determine if the two fractions and are equivalent, we\ncheck to see that . If those two products are equal, then the fractions are equal also.\nEXAMPLE3.53\nDetermining If Two Fractions Are Equivalent\nDetermine if and are equivalent fractions. 170 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nSolution\nApplying the definition, and .

In other words, when two numbers are equal, then dividing both numbers by the same non-zero\nnumber, the two newly obtained numbers are also equal.

In a fraction, when the numerator and denominator have a common divisor, that common\ndivisor can bedivided out. This is often calledcanceling the common factorsor, more colloquially, ascanceling.\nTo show this, consider the fraction . The numerator and denominator have the common factor 3. We can rewrite the\nfraction as . The common divisor 3 is then divided out, or canceled, and we can write the fraction as\n. The 3s have been crossed out to indicate they have been divided out. The process of dividing out two\nfactors is also referred to asreducing the fraction.\nIf the numerator and denominator have no common positive divisors other than 1, then the rational number is inlowest\nterms.\nThe process of dividing out common divisors of the numerator and denominator of a fraction is calledreducing the\nfraction.\nOne way to reduce a fraction to lowest terms is to determine the GCD of the numerator and denominator and divide out\nthe GCD. Another way is to divide out common divisors until the numerator and denominator have no more common\nfactors.\nEXAMPLE3.54\nReducing Fractions to Lowest Terms\nExpress the following rational numbers in lowest terms:\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1.

Define and identify numbers that are irrational.\n2. Simplify irrational numbers and express in lowest terms.\n3. Add and subtract irrational numbers.\n4. Multiply and divide irrational numbers.\n5. Rationalize fractions with irrational denominators.\nThe Pythagoreans were a philosophical sect in ancient Greece. Their philosophy included reincarnation and purifying the\nmind through the study and contemplation of mathematics and science. One of their principles was the cosmos is ruled\nby order, specifically mathematics and music. They even held mystic beliefs about specific numbers and figures. For\nexample, the number 1 was associated with the mind and essence. Four represented justice, as it is the first product of\ntwo even numbers. Most famously, though, is the association with the Pythagorean Theorem, which states that in a right\ntriangle, the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of the triangle (the legs) equals the square of the longer side (the\nhypotenuse). Even the ancient Egyptians used this relationship, as triangles with side measures 3, 4, and 5 were often\nused in surveying following the flooding of the Nile.\nThere is a story of a Pythagorean, Hippasus, discovering that not all numbers could be expressed as fractions. In other\nwords, not all numbers were rational numbers. The story ends with Hippasus, who shared this, or in some versions\ndiscovered it, put to death by drowning for sharing this fact, that not all quantities could be expressed as the ratio of two\nnatural numbers.\nAs colorful as that story may be, it is most likely false, as there are no contemporary sources to corroborate it. But it does\nseem to mark the discovery that not all quantities or measures were fractions of numbers. And so,irrational numbers\nwere discovered.\nVIDEO\nThe Philosophy of the Pythagoreans(https://openstax.org/r/Philosophy_of_Pythagoreans)\nDefining and Identifying Numbers That Are Irrational\nWe defined rational numbers in the last section as numbers that could be expressed as a fraction of two integers.\nIrrational numbersare numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. Recall that rational numbers\ncould be identified as those whose decimal representations either terminated (ended) or had a repeating pattern at\nsome point. So irrational numbers must be those whose decimal representations do not terminate or become a\nrepeating pattern. 192 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nOne collection of irrational numbers issquare rootsof numbers that aren\u2019tperfect squares. is the square root of the\nnumber , denoted , if . The number is the perfect square of the integer if . The rational number\nis a perfect square if both and are perfect squares.\nOne method of determining if an integer is a perfect square is to examine its prime factorization. If, in that factorization,\nall the prime factors are raised to even powers, the integer is a perfect square. Another method is to attempt to factor\nthe integer into an integer squared. It is possible that you recognize the number as a perfect square (such as 4 or 9). Or,\nif you have a calculator at hand, use the calculator to determine if the square root of the integer is an integer.\nEXAMPLE3.84\nIdentifying Perfect Squares\nDetermine which of the following are perfect squares.\n1. 45\n2. 81\n3.\n4.\nSolution\n1. The prime factorization of 45 is . Since the 5 is not raised to an even power, 45 is not a perfect square.\n2. The prime factorization of 81 is . All the prime factors are raised to even powers, so 81 is a perfect square.\n3. We must determine if both the numerator and denominator of are perfect squares for the rational number to be\na perfect square. The numerator is 9, and as mentioned above, 9 is a perfect square (it is 3 squared). Now we check\nthe prime factorization of the denominator, 28, which is . Since 7 is not raised to an even power, 28 is not\na perfect square. Since the denominator is not a perfect square, is not a perfect square.\n4. We must determine if both the numerator and denominator of are perfect squares for the rational number to\nbe a perfect square. The numerator is 144. The prime factorization of 144 is . Since all the prime\nfactors of 144 are raised to even powers, 144 is a perfect square. Now we check the prime factorization of the\ndenominator, 400, which is . Since all the prime factors of 400 are raised to even powers, 400 is a\nperfect square. Since the numerator and denominator of are perfect squares, is a perfect square.\nYOUR TURN3.84\nDetermine which of the following are perfect squares.\n1. 36\n2. 27\n3.\n4.\nTECH CHECK\nUsing Desmos to Determine if a Number Is a Perfect Square\nDesmos may be used to determine if a number is a perfect square by using its square root function.

There are numbers that defied such classification for\nquite a long time. One such is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The Euler-Mascheroni constant is used in mathematics,\nand is primarily associated with the natural logarithm, which is a mathematical function. The constant has been\naround since around 1790. However, it was unknown if this constant was rational or irrational until 2013, at which\npoint it was proven to be irrational.\nSimplifying Square Roots and Expressing Them in Lowest Terms\nTosimplify a square rootmeans that we rewrite the square root as a rational number times the square root of a\nnumber that has no perfect square factors. The act of changing a square root into such a form is simplifying the square\nroot.\nThe number inside the square root symbol is referred to as theradicand. So in the expression the number is\nreferred to as the radicand.\nBefore discussing how to simplify a square root, we need to introduce a rule about square roots. The square root of a\nproduct of numbers equals the product of the square roots of those number. Written symbolically, .\nFORMULA\nFor any two numbers and , .\nUsing this formula, we can factor an integer inside a square root into a perfect square times another integer. Then the\nsquare root can be applied to the perfect square, leaving an integer times the square root of another integer.

But to conceptualize a\nfraction in that manner, the denominator needs to be an integer. An irrational number in the denominator interferes with\nthat interpretation of a fraction. Fractions that have denominators that are just the square root of an integer can be\naltered into fractions with integer denominators using a process calledrationalizing the denominator. The process\nrelies on the following property of square roots: and the following property of fractions: for any\nnon-zero number .\nUsing these two properties, when a fraction has a square root in the denominator, we can eliminate that square root.\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by that square root from the denominator, . Then apply\nto the denominator, yielding .

Being familiar with\nthese properties is helpful in all settings where numbers are used and manipulated. For example, when multiplying\n, you could multiply the 4 and 25 first. If you know that product is 100, it makes the multiplication easier.\nThe table below is a partial list of properties of real numbers.\nProperty Example In Words\nDistributive property Multiplication distributes across addition\nCommutative property of addition Numbers can be added in any order\nCommutative property of Numbers can be multiplied in any order\nmultiplication\nAssociative property of addition Doesn't matter which pair of numbers is added\nfirst\nAssociative property of Doesn't matter which pair of numbers is\nmultiplication multiplied first\nAdditive identity property Any number plus 0 is the number\nMultiplicative identity property Any number times one is the number\nAdditive inverse property Every number plus its negative is 0\nMultiplicative inverse property Every non-zero number times its reciprocal is 1\n, provided\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.6 \u2022 Real Numbers 209\nThe names of the properties are suggestive.

Using an\nATM involves sliding your bank card into a reader, which then reads, sends, and verifies your card. Swiping or tapping for\na purchase in a brick\u2013and-mortar store is how your card sends its information to the machine, which is then\ncommunicated to the store\u2019s computer and your credit card company.

But when we work with time, specifically with clocks, the\nnumbers cycle back on themselves. It will never be 49 o\u2019clock. Once 12 o\u2019clock is reached, we go back to 1 and repeat the\nnumbers. If it's 11 AM and someone says, \u201cSee you in four hours,\u201d you know that 11 AM plus 4 hours is 3 PM, not 15 AM\n(ignoring military time for now). Math worked on the clock, where numbers restart after passing 12, is calledclock\narithmetic. 212 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nClock arithmetic hinges on the number 12. Each cycle of 12 hours returns to the original time (Figure 3.41). Imagine\ngoing around the clock one full time. Twelve hours pass, but the time is the same. So, if it is 3:00, 14 hours later and two\nhours later both read the same on the clock, 5:00. Adding 14 hours and adding 2 hours are identical. As is adding 26\nhours. And adding 38 hours.\nFigure3.41Clock showing 3:00 with arrow going around the clock one full time, or 12 hours\nWhat do 2, 14, 26, and 38 have in common in relation to 12? When they are divided by 12, they each have a remainder of\n2. That's the key. When you add a number of hours to a specific time on the clock, first divide the number of hours being\nadded by 12 and determine the remainder. Add that remainder to the time on the clock to know what time it will be.\nA good visualization is to wrap a number line around the clock, with the 0 at the starting time. Then each time 12 on the\nnumber line passes, the number line passes the starting spot on the clock. This is referred to asmodulo 12arithmetic.\nEven though the process says to divide the number being added by 12, first perform the addition; the result will be the\nsame if you add the numbers first, and then divide by 12 and determine the remainder.\nIn general terms, let be a positive integer. Then modulo 12, written ( mod 12), is the remainder when is divided by\n12. If that remainder is , we would write (mod 12).\nCaution: 12 mod 12 is 0. So, if a mod 12 problem ends at 0, that would be 12 on the clock.\nEXAMPLE3.101\nDetermining the Value of a Number modulo 12\nFind the value of the following numbers modulo 12:\n1. 34\n2. 539\n3. 156\nSolution\nTo determine the value of a number modulo 12, divide the number by 12 and record the remainder.\n1. To find the value 34 modulo 12:\nStep 1:Determine the remainder when 34 is divided by 12 using long division. The largest multiple of 12 that is less\nthan or equal to 34 is 24, which is the product of 12 and 2.\nStep 2:Performing the subtraction yields 10.\nSince that subtraction resulted in a number less than 12, that is the remainder, 10. The value of 34 modulo 12 is 10,\nor 34 = 10 (mod 12).\n2. To find the value 539 modulo 12:\nStep 1:Determine the remainder when 539 is divided by 12 using long division. We first look to the first two digits of\n539, 53. The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 53 is 48, which is the product of 12 and 4.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.7 \u2022 Clock Arithmetic 213\nStep 2:Performing the subtraction results in 5.\nStep 3:Now, the 9 is brought down.\nStep 4:The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 59 is once more 48 itself, which is .\nStep 5:Finishing the process, the 48 is subtracted from the 59, yielding 11.\nWe've used all the digits of 539, and the last subtraction resulted in a number less than 12, so that number, 11, is the\nremainder. The value of 539 modulo 12 is 11, or, 539 = 11 (mod 12).\n3. To find the value 156 modulo 12:\nStep 1:Determine the remainder when 156 is divided by 12 using long division. We first look to the first two digits of\n156, 15. The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 15 is 12 itself, which is the product of 12 and 1.\nStep 2:Performing the subtraction results in 3.\nStep 3:Now, the 6 is brought down.\nStep 4:The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 36 is 36 itself, which is . 214 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nStep 5:Finishing the process, the 36 is subtracted from the 36, yielding 0.\nWe've used all the digits of 156, and the last subtraction resulted in a number less than 12, so that number, 0, is the\nremainder. The value of 156 modulo 12 is 0, or, 156 = 0 (mod 12).\nWe should note here that, had we been speaking of time, the 0 would be interpreted as 12:00.\nYOUR TURN3.101\nFind the value of the following numbers modulo 12.\n1. 93\n2. 387\nTECH CHECK\nUsing Desmos to Determine the Value of a Number module 12\nDesmos may be used to determine the value of a number modulo 12. It is flexible enough to find the value of a\nnumber modulo of any other integer you want. To determine the value of modulo 12, typemod( ,12)into Desmos.\nThe result will be displayed immediately. This can be used to find 539 modulo 12, as shown in theFigure 3.42.\nFigure3.42Display of 539 modulo 12\nClock arithmetic is modulo 12 arithmetic but applied to time. As time is divided into 12 hours that repeat a cycle, we\nuse modulo 12 for clock arithmetic.\nVIDEO\nClock Arithmetic(https://openstax.org/r/Clock_Arithmetic)\nEXAMPLE3.102\nAdding with Clock Arithmetic\nIf it's 3:00, what time will it be in 89 hours?\nSolution\nTo find that future time, we may determine the value of 89 (mod 12), either by long division or by using a calculator, such\nas Desmos. Then add the result to 3:00. Enteringmod(89,12)in Desmos results in 5. Adding 5 hours, which was 89\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.7 \u2022 Clock Arithmetic 215\n(mod12), to 3:00 results in 8:00.\nYOUR TURN3.102\n1. If it is 9:00 now, what time will it be in 43 hours?\nSubtracting time on the clock works in much the same way as addition. Find the value of the number of hours being\nsubtracted modulo 12, then subtract that from the original time.\nEXAMPLE3.103\nSubtracting with Clock Arithmetic\nIf it is 4:00 now, what time was it 67 hours ago?\nSolution\nTo find that past time, we may determine the value of 67 (mod 12), either by long division or by using a calculator, such\nas Desmos. Then subtract the result to 4:00. Enteringmod(67,12)in Desmos results in 7. Subtracting 7 hours from 4:00\nresults in \u20123:00. We know, though, that time is not represented with negative times. This value, \u20123:00, indicates three\nhours before 12:00, which is 9:00. So, 67 hours before 4:00 was 9:00. We see this in theFigure 3.43.\nFigure3.43Clock showing 7 hours subtracted from 4:00\nYOUR TURN3.103\n1. If it is 7:00 now, what time was it 34 hours ago?\nRecall that clock arithmetic was referred to as modulo 12 arithmetic. Multiplying in modulo 12 also relies on the\nremainder when dividing by 12. To multiply modulo 12 is just to multiply the two numbers, and then determine the\nremainder when divided by 12.\nEXAMPLE3.104\nMultiplying modulo 12\nWhat is the product of 11 and 45 modulo 12?\nSolution\nWe begin by multiplying 11 and 45, which is 495. Next, we find 495 modulo 12, either by dividing the result by 12 to\ndetermine the remainder, or by using a calculator. Enteringmod(495,12)in Desmos yields 3. Had long division been\nused, the remainder would be 3. So modulo 12.\nYOUR TURN3.104\n1. What is the product of 4 and 19 modulo 12? 216 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nCalculating Real-World Applications with Clock Arithmetic\nEXAMPLE3.105\nApplying Clock Arithmetic\nSuppose it is 3:00, and you decide to check your email every 5 hours. What time will it be when you check your email the\nninth time?\nSolution\nIf you check your email every 5 hours nine times, that ninth check will occur 45 hours after 3:00, which is an addition of\n45 hours to 3:00. So, we find 45 modulo 12, which is 9. Nine hours after 3:00 is 12:00. It will be 12:00 when you check\nyour email the ninth time.\nYOUR TURN3.105\n1. You have agreed to text your friend every 3 hours while driving across the country. You began your trip at 8 AM.\nWhat time will it be when you text your friend the 15th time?\nClock arithmetic processes can be applied to days of the week. Every 7 days the day of the week repeats, much like every\n12 hours the time on the clock repeats. The only difference will be that we work with remainders after dividing by 7. In\ntechnical terms, this is referred to asmodulo 7. More generally, let be a positive integer. Then modulo 7, written\nmod 7, is the remainder when is divided by 7. If that value is , we may write (mod 7).\nEXAMPLE3.106\nApplying Clock Arithmetic to Days of the Week\nYour family has a cat, and no one wants to empty the litter box. However, it has to be done daily. The six of you agree to\ntake turns, so everyone has to empty the litter box every 6 days. You empty the box on a Thursday. What day will you\nempty the box for the 10th time?\nSolution\nThe first time you emptied the litter box was on a Thursday. So,the 10th time you empty the litter box will be 9 times\nlater (you've already had your first turn, so 9 turns left!). This will happen 54 (9 times 6) days later. Finding the value of 54\nmodulo 7, using division to determine the remainder or using a calculator to find the value of 54 modulo 7 gives the\nanswer 5.

Apply the rules of exponents to simplifying expressions.\nSometimes, we look for shorthand when writing or expressing something that simply takes too long. The use of LOL and\ntl;dr. This shorthand only works if everyone reading the shorthand knows what it stands for. Using exponents is a similar\ninstance. Writing out a long string of a number times itself over and over takes too much time, and eventually one would\nforget how many of the value has been written or read. For example,\n. There has to be a shorter and more efficient\nway to write 8 times itself 1, 2, 3\u2026.hmmmm, 19 times.\nAnd that\u2019s the role that exponents play in mathematics. They are shorthand for multiplying a number by itself a number\nof times. Without it, calculations would become a mess and we\u2019d have to write a lot more.\nApplying the Rules of Exponents to Simplify Expressions\nSquaring a number is multiplying it by itself, and has that name because it is the area of a square with that side length.\nCubing a number is finding the volume of a cube with that length of sides. That\u2019s why we refer to as five squared, or\nas ten cubed. Exponents represent that multiplication.\nLet\u2019s remind ourselves of the terminology associated with exponents and what exponents represent. Suppose you want\nto multiply a number, let\u2019s label that number , by itself some number of times. Let\u2019s label the number of times . We\ndenote that as . We say raised to the th power. When we write or see , we call the 7 thebaseand we call 5 the\nexponent. What it represents is 7 multiplied by itself 5 times. This means exponents are used as a shorthand for\nrepeated multiplications, where we write . We would write and say seven to the fifth power.\nVIDEO\nExponential Notation(https://openstax.org/r/Exponential_Notation)\nThe definitions of base and exponent make it possible to understand the exponent rules.\nProduct Rule for Exponents\nThe first rule we examine is the product rule, . This rule means that when we multiply a base raised to a\npower times the same base to another power, the result is the base raised to the sum of the powers. To demonstrate,\nconsider . If we apply the product rule to that we get . This can be tested by looking at the\nmultiplications that are represented. The is 9 times itself 3 times, while is 9 times itself 5 times.

Write numbers in standard or scientific notation.\n2. Convert numbers between standard and scientific notation.\n3. Add and subtract numbers in scientific notation.\n4. Multiply and divide numbers in scientific notation.\n5. Use scientific notation in computing real-world applications.\nThe amount of information available on the Internet is simply incomprehensible. One estimate for the amount of data\nthat will be on the Internet by 2025 is 175 Zettabytes. A single zettabyte is one billion trillion. Written out, it is\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. One estimate is that we\u2019re producing 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day. A quintillion is\na trillion trillion, or, written out, 1,000,000,000,000,000,000. To determine how many days it takes to increase the amount\nof information that is on the Internet by 1 zettabyte, divide these two numbers, a zettabyte being\n1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, and 2.5 quintillion, being 2,500,000,000,000,000,000, shows it takes 400 days to generate\n1 zettabyte of information. But doing that calculation is awkward with a calculator. Keeping track of the zeros can be\ntedious, and a mistake can easily be made.\nOn the other end of the scale, a human red blood cell has a diameter of 7.8 micrometers. One micrometer is one\nmillionth of a meter. Written out, 7.8 micrometers is 0.0000078 meters. Smaller still is the diameter of a virus, which is\nabout 100 nanometers in diameter, where a nanometer is a billionth of a meter. Written out, 100 nanometers is\n0.0000001 meters. To compare that to engineered items, a single transistor in a computer chip can be 14 nanometers in\nsize (0.000000014 meters). Smaller yet is the diameter of an atom, at between 0.1 and 0.5 nanometers.\nSometimes we have numbers that are incredibly big, and so have an incredibly large number of digits, or sometimes\nnumbers are incredibly small, where they have a large number of digits after the decimal. But using those\nrepresentations of the names of the sizes makes comparing and computing with these numbers problematic. That\u2019s\nwhere scientific notation comes in.\nWriting Numbers in Standard or Scientific Notation Form\nWhen we say that a number is inscientific notation, we are specifying the form in which that number is written. That\nform begins with an integer with an absolute value between 1 and 9, then perhaps followed the decimal point and then\nsome more digits. This is then multiplied by 10 raised to some power. When the number only has one non-zero digit, the\nscientific notation form is the digit multiplied by 10 raised to an exponent. When the number has more than one non-\nzero digit, the scientific notation form is a single digit, followed by a decimal, which is then followed by the remaining\ndigits, which is then multiplied by 10 to a power.\nThe following numbers are written in scientific notation:\nThe following numbers are not written in scientific notation: 228 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nbecause it isn't multiplied by 10 raised to a power\nbecause the absolute value of \u221250.053 is not at least 1 and less than 10\nbecause 41.7 is not at least 1 and less than 10\nbecause 0.036 is not at least one and less than 10\nEXAMPLE3.117\nIdentifying Numbers in Scientific Notation\nWhich of the following numbers are in scientific notation? If the number is not in scientific notation, explain why it is not.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. The number is in scientific notation because the absolute value of \u22129.67 is at least 1 and less than 10.\n2. The number is not in scientific notation because 145 is not at least 1 and less than 10.\n3. The number is not in scientific notation form. Even though it is at least 1 but less than 10, it is not multiplied by\n10 raised to a power.\nYOUR TURN3.117\nWhich of the following numbers are in scientific notation? If the number is not in scientific notation, explain why it is\nnot.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSome numbers are so large or so small that it is impractical to write them out fully. Avogadro\u2019s number is important in\nchemistry. It represents the number of units in 1 mole of any substance. The substance many be electrons, atoms,\nmolecules, or something else. Written out, the number is: 602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000. Another example of a\nnumber that is impractical to write out fully is the length of a light wave. The wavelength of the color blue is about\n0.000000450 to 0.000000495 meters. Such numbers are awkward to work with, and so scientific notation is often used.\nWe need to discuss how to convert numbers into scientific notation, and also out of scientific notation.\nRecall that multiplying a number by 10 adds a 0 to the end of the number or moves the decimal one place to the right, as\nin or . And if you multiply by 100, it adds two zeros to the end of the number or moves\nthe decimal two places to the right, and so on. For example, and .\nMultiplying a number by 1 followed by some number of zeros just adds that many zeros to the end of the number or\nmoves the decimal place that many places to the right. Numbers written as 1 followed by some zeros are just powers of\n10, as in , , , etc. Generally, .\nWe can use this to write very large numbers. For instance, Avogadro\u2019s number is 602,214,076,000,000,000,000,000, which\ncan be written as . The multiplication moves the decimal 23 places to the right.\nSimilarly, when we divide by 10, we move the decimal one place to the left, as in . If we divide by 100, we\nmove the decimal two places to the left, as in . In general, when you divide a number by a 1 followed by\nzeros, you move the decimal places to the left, as in . This denominator could be written as\n. If we use that in the expression and allow for negative exponents, rewrite the number as\n. With this, we can write division by a 1 followed by zeros as multiplication by\n10 raised to .\nUsing that information, we can demonstrate how to convert from a number in standard form into scientific notation\nform.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.9 \u2022 Scientific Notation 229\nCase 1:The number is a single-digit integer.\nIn this case, the scientific notation form of the number is .\nCase 2:The absolute value of the number is less than 1.\nFollow the process below.\n\u2022 Step 1:Count the number of zeros between the decimal and the first non-zero digit.

Since the absolute value of 428.9 is 10 or larger, so we use the process from Case 3, above.\nStep 1:There are three digits to the left of the decimal point, so .\nStep 2:Write the digits of the number without the decimal place, which is 4289.\nStep 3:Since there is more than one digit, place the decimal point after the first digit.

For instance, let\u2019s look at .\nIf we wanted to move the decimal one place to the left, we\u2019d have to increase the power of 10, as shown here:\n. Since we moved the decimal one to the left, we balance that with moving the\nexponent up by one. Similarly, if we move the decimal one place to the right, we have to balance that by moving the\nexponent one to the left, or subtracting one from the exponent, as shown here: .\nGenerally, for a number in the form :\n\u2022 If you move the decimal to the left by digits, you increase the exponent by .\n\u2022 If you move the decimal to the right by digits, you decrease the exponent by digits.\nEXAMPLE3.119\nIncreasing the Exponent\nChange by moving the decimal two places to the left.\nSolution\nSince we are moving the decimal to the left by two places, we increase the exponent of 10 by 2, so that the exponent is\nnow 7.

Now, we explore\nconverting from scientific notation back into standard form. Doing so involves moving the decimal according to the\npower of the 10. The decimal is moved a number of steps equal to the exponent of the 10. As demonstrated previously,\nwhen the exponent of the 10 is negative, the decimal is moved to the left and when the exponent of the 10 is positive,\nthe decimal is moved to the right.\nEXAMPLE3.121\nConverting from Scientific Notation to Standard Form\nConvert the following into standard form:\n1.\n2.\nSolution\n1.

On the TI-83, it is accessed through the MODE menus. For a commonly used, free phone scientific calculator,\nthe calculator can be forced to work in scientific notation mode through its settings.\nSome calculators, such as the Desmos online calculator, display scientific notation as a number times 10 to a power as\nyou\u2019ve seen in this section. However, some calculators indicate scientific notation by replacing the with an E (or\nEE) followed by the exponent. For example,Figure 3.46shows what you may see on a TI-84.\nFigure3.46Calculator screens\nAdding and Subtracting Numbers in Scientific Notation\nTo add or subtract numbers in scientific notation, the numbers first need to have the same exponent for the 10s. It is\npossible to add the following since the powers of 10 match:\nNotice that the number parts were added, but the exponent part remained the same. This is due to the distributive\nproperty of the real numbers. The is factored from the two terms, as shown:\nNumbers in scientific notation can be added or subtracted directly using a calculator.

Identify arithmetic sequences.\n2. Find a given term in an arithmetic sequence.\n3. Find the th term of an arithmetic sequence.\n4. Find the sum of a finite arithmetic sequence.\n5. Use arithmetic sequences to solve real- world applications\nAs we saw in the previous section, we are adding about 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day to the Internet. If there are\n550 quintillion bytes of data today, then there will be 552.5 quintillion bytes tomorrow, and 555 quintillion bytes in 2\ndays. This is an example of an arithmetic sequence. There are many situations where this concept of fixed increases\ncomes into play, such as raises or table arrangements.\nIdentifying Arithmetic Sequences\nAsequenceof numbers is just that, a list of numbers in order. It can be a short list, such as the number of points earned\non each assignment in a class, such as {10, 10, 8, 9, 10, 6, 10}. Or it can be a longer list, even infinitely long, such as the\nlist of prime numbers. For example, here\u2019s a sequence of numbers, specifically, the squares of the first 12 natural\nnumbers.\n{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144}\nEach value in the sequence is called aterm. Terms in the list are often referred to by their location in the sequence, as in\nthe th term. For the sequence {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144}, the first term of the sequence is 1, the fourth\nterm is 16, and so on. In the sequence of assignment scores {10, 10, 8, 9, 10, 6, 10}, the first term is 10 and the third term\nis 8 (Figure 3.47).\nFigure3.47Sequence showing first, second, and fifth terms\nThe notation we use with sequences is a letter, which represents a term in the sequence, and a subscript, which indicates 240 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nwhat place the term is in the sequence. For the sequence {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144}, we will use the\nletter as a value in the sequence, and so would be the term in the sequence at the fifth position. That number is 25,\nso we can write .\nIn this section, we focus on a special kind of sequence, one referred to as anarithmetic sequence. Arithmetic\nsequences have terms that increase by a fixed number or decrease by a fixed number, called theconstant difference\n(denoted by ), provided that value is not 0. This means the next term is always the previous term plus or minus a\nspecified, constant value. Another way to say this is that the difference between any consecutive terms of the sequence\nis always the same value.\nTo see a constant difference, look at the following sequence: {7, 15, 23, 31, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71, 79, 87}.Figure 3.48\nillustrates that each term of the sequence is the previous term plus 8. Eight is the constant difference here.\nFigure3.48Sequence of numbers with 8 added to each term\nEXAMPLE3.132\nIdentifying Arithmetic Sequences\nDetermine if the following sequences are arithmetic sequences. Explain your reasoning.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. In the sequence , every term is the previous term plus 3. The ellipsis indicates that the\npattern continues, which means keep adding 3 to the previous term to get the new term. Therefore, this is an\ninfinite arithmetic sequence.\n2. In the sequence , terms increase by various amounts, for instance from term 1 to term 2,\nthe sequence increases by 20, but from term 2 to term 3 the sequence increases by 40. So, this is not an arithmetic\nsequence.\n3. In the sequence , every term is the previous term minus 6, so this is an\narithmetic sequence.\nYOUR TURN3.132\nDetermine if the following sequences are arithmetic sequences. Explain your reasoning.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nArithmetic sequences can be expressed with a formula.

For\ninstance, suppose someone practices chess each week and increases the amount of time they study each week. The first\nweek the person practices for 3 hours, and vows to practice 30 more minutes each week. Since the amount of time\npracticing increases by a fixed number each week, this would qualify as an arithmetic sequence.\nEXAMPLE3.136\nApplying an Arithmetic Sequence\nJordan has just watchedThe Queen\u2019s Gambitand decided to hone their skills in chess. To really improve at the game,\nJordan decides to practice for 3 hours the first week, and increase their time spent practicing by 30 minutes each week.\nHow many hours will Jordan practice chess in week 20?\nSolution\nJordan\u2019s practice scheme is an arithmetic sequence, as it increases by a fixed amount each week. The first week there are\n3 hours of practice. This means . Jordan increases the time spent practicing by 30 minutes, or half an hour, each\nweek. This means . Using those values, and that we want to know the amount of time Jordan will study in week\n20, we determine the time in week 20 using .\nSo, Jordan will practice 12.5 hours in week 20.\nYOUR TURN3.136\n1.

How many hours\ntotal will Jordan have practiced chess after 30 weeks of practice?\nSolution\nTo calculate the total amount of time that Jordan practiced, we need to use . The formula requires the\nfirst and last terms of the sequence. Since Jordan practiced 3 hours in the first week, the first term is . Because we\nwant the total practice time after 30 weeks, we need the term. Because the constant difference is , the 244 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nterm is .\nApplying the formula provides the sum of the first 30 terms.\n.\nThis means that Jordan practiced a total of 615 hours after 30 weeks.\nYOUR TURN3.137\n1.

Use geometric sequences to solve real-world applications.\nOne of the concerns when investing is thedoubling time, which is length of time it takes for the value of the investment\nto be twice, or double, that of its starting value. A shorter doubling times means the investment gets bigger, sooner. For\nexample, if you invest $200 in an account with an 8-year doubling time, then in 8 years the value of the account will be\ndouble the starting amount, or . After another 8 years (for a total of 16 years) the investment would be\ntwice its value after the first 8 years, or . Every 8 years, the investment would double\nagain, so after the third 8-year period, the investment would be worth . This process exhibits\nexponential growth, an application of geometric sequences, which is explored in this section.\nIdentifying Geometric Sequences\nWe know what a sequence is, but what makes a sequence a geometric sequence? In an arithmetic sequence, each term\nis the previous term plus the constant difference. So, you add a (possibly negative) number at each step. In ageometric\nsequence, though, each term is the previous term multiplied by the same specified value, called thecommon ratio. In\nthe sequence the common ratio is 2. To see the difference between an\narithmetic sequence and geometric sequence, examine these two sequences (Figures 3.52and3.53).\nFigure3.50Arithmetic sequence\nEach term in this arithmetic sequence is the previous term plus 5.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.11 \u2022 Geometric Sequences 247\nFigure3.51Geometric sequence\nEach term in this geometric sequence is the previous term times 2.\nIn the sequence , the numbers get big fairly quickly, and stay positive. However,\nthat\u2019s not always the case with geometric sequences. Depending on the value of the common ratio, the terms could\nincrease each time (like in the one shown inFigure 3.51), or the terms can get smaller each time, or the terms can\nalternate between positive and negative values. It all depends on the value of the common ratio, .\nConsider this geometric sequence:\nEach term is the previous term times 5, which means the common ratio is 5. This common ratio is larger than 1, and so\nthe terms increase each time. Now, look at this geometric sequence:\nEach term is the previous term times \u22123, and the sign of the terms alternate from positive to negative. Then, there\u2019s this\ngeometric sequence:\nEach term is the previous term times , and the terms decrease each time. What we should take away from these three\nexamples is if the common ratio is a positive number larger than 1, then the sequence increases. If the common ratio is a\nnegative number, then the sign of the terms alternates between positive and negative. If the common ratio is between 0\nand 1, then the terms decrease.\nTwo special cases of geometric sequences are when the constant ratio is 1 and when the common ratio is 0. When the\nconstant ratio is 1, every term of the sequence is the same, as in . This is referred to as aconstant\nsequence. When the constant ratio is 0, the first term can be any number, but every term after the first term is 0, as in\n.\nEXAMPLE3.138\nIdentifying Geometric Sequences\nFor each sequence, determine if the sequence is a geometric sequence. If so, identify the common ratio.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. In the sequence , the jump from 5 to 20 is a multiplication by 4, as is the next\njump to 80, and the next to 320. Each term is 4 times the previous term. Since each term is 4 times the previous, this\nis a geometric sequence. The common ratio is 4.\n2. In the sequence , notice that 6 is \u22123 times \u22122. The jump from 6 to \u221212 is another\nmultiplication by negative. So, if this is a geometric sequence, each term should be the previous term times \u22122. But\nthe change from 24 to 11 is not a multiplication by \u22122, This means the sequence is not a geometric sequence.\n3. In the sequence , the change from 4 to 2 is a multiplication by , as is the next jump, from 2 to\n1, as is the next from 1 to . Each term is times the previous term. Since each term is times the previous, this is\na geometric sequence.

Compound interest is 250 3 \u2022 Real Number Systems and Number Theory\nsomething that happens to money deposited into an account, be it savings or an individual retirement account, or IRA.\nThe interest on the account is calculated and added to the account at regular intervals. This means the interest that was\nearned later gains its own interest. This allows the money to grow faster. If that interest is added every month, we say it\nis compounded monthly. If the interest is added daily, then we say it is compounded daily. The amount of money that is\ndeposited into the account is called the principal and is denoted . The account earns money on that principal. The\namount it earns is a percentage of the money in the account. The interest rate, expressed as a decimal, is denoted .\nFORMULA\nIf you deposit dollars in an account that earns interest compounded yearly, then the amount in the account, ,\nafter years is calculated with the formula: . This is a geometric sequence, with constant ratio\nand first term .\nEXAMPLE3.141\nCalculating Interest Compounded Yearly\nDaryl deposits $1,000 in an account earning interest compounded yearly.

This arises in biology quite frequently, especially in\nrelation to bacterial cultures, but also with other organism population models. In bacterial cultures, the time it takes the\npopulation to double is often recorded. This time to double is the same, regardless of how big the population gets. So, if\nthe population doubles after 3 hours, it doubles again after another 3 hours, and again after another 3 hours, and so on.\nPut into geometric sequence language, it has a common ratio of 2.\nEXAMPLE3.142\nDoubling a Bacterial Culture\nWhenEscherichia coli(E. coli) is in a broth culture at 37\u00b0C, the population ofE. colidoubles in number with 30 organisms,\nhow manyE. colibacteria are present in the culture after 16 hours?\nSolution\nSince the population is doubling every 20 minutes, this is a geometric sequence situation with common ratio . The\nculture begins with 30 organisms, so . The time,16 hours, is 48 twenty-minute periods, so we\u2019re looking for the\n48th term in the sequence. Using these values in the geometric sequence formula gives\n.\nSo, after 16 hours, the culture contains E. coliorganisms. That\u2019s more than 4,000 trillion bacteria.\nYOUR TURN3.142\n1.

On the second square, the player places 2 grains of\nrice. On the third square, the player places 4 grains of rice. On each successive square of the board, the player doubles\nthe number of grains of rice placed on the chess board. When the player places the last rice on the 64th square, how\nmany total grains of rice have been placed on the board?\nSolution\nSince the number of grains of rice is doubled at each step, this is a geometric sequence with first term and\ncommon ratio . Rice is placed on 64 total squares, so we want the sum of the first 64 terms. Using this information\nand the formula, the total number of grains of rice on the board will be:\nThat\u2019s a 20-digit number!\nYOUR TURN3.143\n1. You have a square 1 meter on each side.

The prime factorizations of the numbers can be used to identify the greatest common divisor.\n\u2022 The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers is the smallest integer that is divisible by all of the numbers in\nthe set. The prime factorizations of the numbers can be used to identify the least common multiple.\n\u2022 There are various ways that the GCD and LCM are applied.\n3.2The Integers\n\u2022 A set of numbers that can be built from the natural numbers are the integers, which consist of the natural numbers,\nzero (0), and the negatives of the natural numbers.\n\u2022 Integers are often graphed on a number line, which helps display the relative positions and values of those\nnumbers.\n\u2022 The number line can be used to visualize when one integer is larger than or smaller than another integer.\n\u2022 Arithmetic operations with integers are similar to the operations with natural numbers, except that the sign\n(positive or negative) of the numbers will determine the sign (positive or negative) of the result.\n3.3Order of Operations\n\u2022 Establishing shared rules on which arithmetic operations are calculated first is necessary. Without them, different\npeople may find different values for the same expression.\n\u2022 The highest precedence is with expressions in parentheses. This allows parts of an expression to be calculated in an\norder different than the basic order of operations.\n\u2022 The lowest precedence is addition and subtraction, as they are the basis for all other calculations.\n\u2022 Multiplication and division have precedence over addition and subtraction, as they are representations of repeated\naddition or subtraction.\n\u2022 Exponents have precedence over multiplication and division, as they represent repeated multiplication and division.\n3.4Rational Numbers\n\u2022 Rational numbers are fractions of integers, and can always be written as an integer divided by an integer.\n\u2022 The numerator and denominator of a fraction may have common factors. In such cases, the fraction can be reduced\nby canceling common factors. When the numerator and denominator of a fraction have no common factors, the\nfraction is said to be reduced.\n\u2022 An improper fraction is one with a numerator larger than the denominator. Such a fraction can be rewritten as an\ninteger plus a proper fraction. This is called a mixed number.\n\u2022 Using division and remainder, an improper fraction may be written as a mixed number.\n\u2022 A mixed number can be converted to an improper fraction by reversing the process for changing an improper\nfraction to a mixed number. 256 3 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n\u2022 The arithmetic operations or addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can all be performed on rational\nnumbers.\n\u2022 Addition and subtraction of rational numbers can be performed after a common denominator has been identified,\nand the fractions have been converted to forms having the common denominator.\n\u2022 Multiplication and division of rational numbers can be performed without regard to common denominators.\n\u2022 Between any two rational numbers, there is always another rational number. This is the density property of the\nrational numbers.\n3.5Irrational Numbers\n\u2022 Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as an integer divided by another integer. One example is pi,\ndenoted . Another collection of irrational numbers are natural numbers that are not perfect squares.\n\u2022 Some irrational numbers can be written as a rational part multiplied by an irrational part. If two irrational numbers\nhave the same irrational parts, they can be added or subtracted.\n\u2022 When irrational numbers are similar, on can multiply and divide the numbers without a calculator.\n\u2022 Since , and , products and quotients of square roots can be determined.\n\u2022 Because and , it is possible to simplify square root expressions so the radicand\ncontains no perfect square factors.\n\u2022 When a fraction has an irrational number as its denominator, it is possible to convert the denominator into a\nrational number using its conjugate. Doing so involves multiplying the numerator and denominator by the\nconjugate of the denominator, and then applying the difference of squares formula.\n\u2022 With a single square root term\n\u2022 Using conjugate numbers for two term denominators\n3.6Real Numbers\n\u2022 Real numbers is the collection of all rational and irrational numbers. Conceptually, it is the collection of all values\nthat can be represented on a number line, or, as a length along with sign.\n\u2022 The subsets of the real numbers include the natural numbers, integers, rational numbers and irrational numbers.\nThe natural numbers are a subset of the integers, which is a subset of the rational numbers. The rational and\nirrational numbers are disjoint sets.\n\u2022 The real numbers, due to order of operation rules and that performing arithmetic operations on real number always\nresults in a real number, have arithmetic properties that apply in all cases. There include the distributive property,\nthe commutative property, and the associative property. Also, every real number has an additive inverse and, except\nfor zero (0), have a multiplicative inverse.\n3.7Clock Arithmetic\n\u2022 Clock arithmetic uses the idea that after 12 o\u2019clock comes 1 o\u2019clock. For clock arithmetic, this means that every time\n12 is passed in an arithmetic process, the next number is 1, not 13.\n\u2022 To determine the clock result of an arithmetic operation, divide the final result by 12 and keep the remainder. If the\nremainder is 0, then the time is 12 o\u2019clock.\n\u2022 Clock arithmetic is technically called modulo 12 arithmetic. To perform modulo 12 arithmetic, calculate the\nexpression, then divide the result by 12. The modulo 12 result is the remainder.\n\u2022 Days, in our system, pass in groups of seven. To calculate in day arithmetic, modulo 7 is used. To perform modulo 7\narithmetic, calculate the expression, then divide the result by 7. The modulo 7 result is the remainder.\n3.8Exponents\n\u2022 Exponents are used to express multiplying a number by itself a number of times. The number being multiplied by\nitself is the base. The number of times it is multiplied by itself is the exponent, which is often referred to as the\npower.\n\u2022 Understanding that exponents represent repeated multiplication of a base makes it possible to establish some rules\nfor combining exponential expressions, using the product rule, the quotient rule, and the power rule. Additionally, it\nallows us to formulate distributive rules for exponents.\n\u2022 Any non-zero number raised to the 0th power is 1. This makes the definition of the 0th power consistent with the\ndivision rule for exponents.\n\u2022 For consistency, negative exponents represent the reciprocal of the base raised to the power, so that ,\nprovided that .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3 \u2022 Chapter Summary 257\n3.9Scientific Notation\n\u2022 Some numbers are so large or so small that writing the number out is clumsy and make it difficult to determine the\ntrue size of the number. Scientific notation makes the number more readable and make the relative size of the\nnumber immediately apparent.\n\u2022 A number written in scientific notation is a number at least 1 and smaller than 10 multiplied by 10 raised to an\nexponent. Converting between scientific notation and standard notation involves correctly applying multiplication\nand division by powers of 10, which in practice equates to understanding how moving the decimal point of a\nnumber impacts the exponent of 10.\n\u2022 Adding and subtracting numbers in base 10 requires the exponent of 10 in each number be the same. Once the\nnumbers are converted to have the same exponent with the ten, then the numbers are added or subtracted as\nindicated, with the power of 10 remaining the same. If the result is not in scientific notation (for instance, the\nnumber has exceeded 10), then then number must be converted into scientific notation.\n\u2022 Multiplying and dividing numbers in scientific notation is done by multiplying or dividing the number parts, then\nmultiplying or dividing the 10 raised to the power parts, then multiplying those two results. If the new number is not\nin scientific notation, then the result must be converted into scientific notation.\n3.10Arithmetic Sequences\n\u2022 A sequence is a list of numbers. Any individual number in that list, or sequence, is a term of the sequence. A specific\nterm of a sequence is denoted by the sequence symbol with a subscript indicating where the term in the sequence\nis.\n\u2022 A special form of a sequence is an arithmetic sequence. Each arithmetic sequence is determined by its first term and\nits constant difference. Any term in an arithmetic sequence is determined by adding the constant difference to the\npreceding term.\n\u2022 If the first term and the constant difference of an arithmetic sequence are known, then any term of the sequence\ncan be found directly.\n\u2022 Because arithmetic sequences follow such a strict pattern, the sum of the first terms of an arithmetic sequence\ncan be determined with the formula .\n3.11Geometric Sequences\n\u2022 A special form of a sequence is a geometric sequence.

This is a relatively recent development. The system didn\u2019t\ndevelop until the 6th or 7th century C.E. and took some time to spread across the world, which means other cultures at\nother times had to develop their own methods of counting and recording quantity. Being different cultures and different\ntimes means there were significant differences in counting systems. Cultures needed to count and measure time for\nagriculture and for religious observations. It was needed for trade. Some languages had words only for one, two, and\nmany. Other cultures developed more complex ways to represent quantity, with the Oksapmin people of New Guinea\nusing an astonishing 27 words for their system.\nRepresenting these quantities in a recorded form likely began with a simple marking system, where one scratch on a\nstick or bone represented one of whatever was being counted. We still see this today with tally marks. These systems use\nrepeated symbols to represent more than one. We also have systems where different symbols represent different\nquantities but still use some repetition, such as in Roman numerals.\nOther systems were devised that rely on place values, like the Hindu-Arabic system in use today. Place value systems\nneeded a zero, though, and weren't immediately recognized and took time to develop. And within these positional\nsystems there is variation. Some systems counted in twenties, others in tens, and some in a mix (adding another reason\nto visit Hawaii). Even now, though we all use and think using tens, computers are designed to work in groups of two,\nwhich requires a different perspective on numbering.\nIn this chapter, we explore different numbering systems and grouping systems, eventually discussing base 2, the\nlanguage of computers. 268 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\n4.1 Hindu-Arabic Positional System\nFigure4.2This manuscript is an early example of Hindu numerals. (credit: modification of work \u201cBakshali manuscript\u201d,\nBodleian Libraries/ University of Oxford, public domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Evaluate an exponential expression.\n2. Convert a Hindu-Arabic numeral to expanded form.\n3. Convert a number in expanded form to a Hindu-Arabic numeral.\nThe modern system of counting and computing isn\u2019t necessarily natural. That different symbols are used to indicate\ndifferent quantities or amounts is a relatively new invention. Simple marking by scratches or dots, one for each item\nbeing counted, was the norm long into human history. The modern system doesn\u2019t use repeated symbols to indicate\nmore than one of a thing. It uses the place of a digit in anumeralto determine what that digit represents. A numeral is a\nsymbol used to represent a number. Anumberis an abstract idea that represents quantity or amount.\nBeing clear about the difference between numeral and number is important. Just like a person can be called by various\nnames, such as brother, father, husband, uncle, they are all representing the same person, John Smith. The person John\nSmith is the number, and the names brother, father, husband, and uncle are the numerals.\nWHO KNEW?\nHindu-Arabic Numerals\nThe numerals we currently use are referred to as Hindu-Arabic numerals, although they have changed as time has\npassed. Early forms of the numerals for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 began in India, and passed through Persia to the\nMiddle East. Place value was also employed in the early systems of India. Once this system was in north Africa and the\nMiddle East, it spread to Europe, eventually replacing Roman numerals. Over time, the original symbols transformed\ninto our modern ones. Readthis article for another perspective on how the symbols began (based on the moon!)\n(https://openstax.org/r/myindiamyglory.com/2018/09/05).\nThe system we use for counting and computing uses place values based on powers of 10. In this section, we review\nexponents and our positional system.\nEvaluating Exponential Expressions\nMost modern numerical systems depend on place values, where the quantity represented depends not only on the digit,\nbut also on where the digit is in the number. The place value is a power of some specific number, which means most\nnumbering systems are actually exponential expressions. Anexponential expressionis any mathematical expression\nthat includes exponents. So, evaluating such an expression means performing the calculation. In this chapter, we will be\nusing exponents that are positive integer values. Before we do so, let\u2019s remind ourselves about exponents and what they\nrepresent. Suppose you want to multiply a number. Let\u2019s label that number , by itself some number of times. Let\u2019s label\nthe number of times . We denote that as . We say , or thebase, raised to the th power, or theexponent. For\nexample, if we are multiplying 13 by itself eight times, we write and say 13 to the eighth power.\nWhen computing exponential expressions, we should be careful to remember the order of operations. Using the order of\noperation rules, calculations inside the parentheses are done first, then exponents are calculated, then multiplication\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Hindu-Arabic Positional System 269\nand division calculations are performed, and then addition and subtraction.\nVIDEO\nExponential Notation(https://openstax.org/r/Exponential_Notation)\nEXAMPLE4.1\nEvaluating an Exponential Expression\nEvaluate the following exponential expressions.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1. To evaluate, or calculate, this expression, we use order of operations, which means the exponents are done first,\nthen multiplications, and then additions.\n2. To evaluate the expression, we use the order of operations, which means the exponents are done first, then the\nmultiplications, then the additions. Remember that any base raised to the exponent 0 is 1.\n3. To evaluate the expression, we use the order of operations, which means the exponents are done first, then the\nmultiplications, and then the additions. Remember that any base raised to the exponent 0 is 1.\nYOUR TURN4.1\nEvaluate the following exponential expressions.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nConverting Hindu-Arabic Numerals to Expanded Form\nWhen you see the number 738, and you speak the number out loud, what do you say? You probably said \u201cseven hundred\nthirty-eight\u201d while wondering what point could possibly be made by asking this. What you didn\u2019t say was \u201cseven, and\nthree, and eight.\u201d A pre-K student might say that. Which should make you wonder, why?\nThe reason is that you\u2019ve been taughtplace values, or the positions of digits in a number that determine the values of\nthose digits. You know that in a three-digit number, the first digit is hundreds, the second digit is tens, and the last digit\nis ones. These place values rely on powers of 10, which makes this system abase 10 system.\nThis sense of place value is what makes our system of numbers so useful. You\u2019ve also been taught theHindu-Arabic\nnumeration system. This system, which uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, and also employs place value based\non powers of 10, is in use today.\nWriting a number using these place values is writing them inexpanded form. For a number with digits, the expanded\nform is the first digit times 10 raised to one less than , plus each following digit times 10 raised to one less than the\nprevious power of 10. For example, the number 738 would be written as .\nWhat about a four-digit number, like 5,825? Out loud, we\u2019d say five thousand, seven hundred twenty-five. In expanded\nform, it would be . Notice that the largest exponent is one less than the number\nof digits, and that the exponents go down by one as we move through the number. 270 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nAryabhata of Kusumapura and Brahmagupta\nThe Hindu-Arabic numeral system developed in India, and Aryabhata of Kusumapura is credited with the place value\nnotation in the 5th century. However, the system wasn\u2019t as complete as it could be, until. roughly a century later, when\nBrahmagupta introduced the symbol for 0. The 0 is necessary to indicate that a given place value has been skipped,\nas in 4,098. In 4,098, the 102power is skipped. Without such a symbol, 4,098 and 498 look similar. The value of both\nthe place value notation and the introduction of the symbol 0 cannot be overstated, for math and the sciences.\nEXAMPLE4.2\nWriting a Number in Expanded Form\nWrite the following in expanded form.\n1. 563\n2. 4,821\n3. 903,786\nSolution\n1. Step 1:Since there are three digits in 563, is 3. So, this is the first digit times 10 raised to the power of 2, so we\nstart with .\nStep 2:Then we add the next digit, 6, multiplied by 10 to a power one less than the previous, at which point we have\n.\nStep 3:Finally, the last digit is multiplied by 10 to the zeroth power and added to the previous. This results in\n.\n2. Step 1:Since there are four digits in 4,821, is 4. We multiply the first digit, 4, by 10 raised to the power of 3, which\nis .\nStep 2:Then we add the next digit, 8, multiplied by 10 to a power one less than the previous, at which point we have\n.\nStep 3:We continue to the next digit, lowering the exponent of 10 by one. Now we have\n.\nStep 4:Finally, the last digit is multiplied by 10 to the zeroth power and added to the previous. This results in\n.\n3. Since there are six digits in 903,786, is 6. So, we begin the process with 9 times 10 raised to the 5th power and\ncontinue through the numbers, reducing the exponent of 10 by one each time. This results in\n.\nYOUR TURN4.2\nWrite the following in expanded form.\n1. 924\n2. 1,279\n3. 4,130,045\nConverting Numbers in Expanded Form to Hindu-Arabic Numerals\nConverting from expanded form back into a Hindu-Arabic numeral is the reverse process of expanding a number, and is\nequivalent to evaluating the exponential expression.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Hindu-Arabic Positional System 271\nEXAMPLE4.3\nConverting a Number from Expanded Form to a Hindu-Arabic Numeral\nConvert the following into Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1.

Understand and convert Babylonian numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n2. Understand and convert Mayan numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n3. Understand and convert between Roman numerals and Hindu-Arabic numerals.\nEach culture throughout history had to develop its own method of counting and recording quantity. The system used in\nAustralia would necessarily differ from the system developed in Babylon that would, in turn, differ from the system\ndeveloped in sub-Saharan Africa. These differences arose due to cultural differences. In nearly all societies, knowing the\ndifference between one and two would be useful. But it might not be useful to know the difference between 145 and\n167, as those quantities never had a practical use. For example, a shepherd likely didn't manage more than 100 sheep,\nso quantities larger than 100 might never have been encountered. This can even be seen in our use of the term few,\nwhich is an inexact quantity that most would agree means more than two. However, as societies became more complex,\nas commerce arose, as military bodies developed, so did the need for a system to handle large numbers. No matter the\nsystem, the issues of representing multiple values and how many symbols to use had to be addressed. In this section, we\nexplore how the Babylonians, Mayans, and Romans addressed these issues.\nUnderstand and Convert Babylonian Numerals to Hindu-Arabic Numerals\nThe Babylonians used a mix of anadditive system of numbersand apositional system of numbers. An additive\nsystem is a number system where the value of repeated instances of a symbol is added the number of times the symbol\nappears. A positional system is a system of numbers that multiplies a \u201cdigit\u201d by a number raised to a power, based on the\nposition of the \u201cdigit.\u201d\nThe Babylonian place values didn\u2019t use powers of 10, but instead powers of 60. They didn\u2019t use 60 different symbols\nthough. For the value 1, they used the following symbol:\nFor values up to 9, that symbol would be repeated, so three would be written as 274 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nTo represent the quantity 10, they used\nFor 20, 30, 40, and 50, they repeated the symbol for 10 however many times it was needed, so 40 would be written\nWhen they reached 60, they moved to the next place value. The complete list of the Babylonian numerals up to 59 is in\nTable 4.1.\nTable4.1Babylonian Numerals\nYou can see how Babylonians repeated the symbols to indicate multiples of a value. The number 6 is 6 of the symbol for\n1 grouped together. The symbol for 30 is three of the symbols for 10 grouped together. However, their system doesn\u2019t go\npast 59. To go past 59, they used place values. As opposed to the Hindu-Arabic system, which was based on powers of\n10, the Babylonian positional system was based on powers of 60. You should also notice there is no symbol for 0, which\nhas some impact on the number system. Since the Babylonian number system lacked a 0, they didn\u2019t have a placeholder\nwhen a power of 60 was absent. Without a 0, 101, 110, and 11 all look the same. However, there is some evidence that\nthe Babylonians left a small space between \"digits\" where we would use a 0, allowing them to represent the absence of\nthat place value. To summarize, theBabylonian system of numbersused repeating a symbol to indicate more than\none, used place values, and lacked a 0.\nWHO KNEW?\nInvention of 0\nThe idea of 0 is not a natural one. Most cultures failed to recognize the need for a 0. If someone asked a farmer in 300\nB.C.E. how many cows they had, but they had none, they would not answer \"zero.\" They\u2019d say \u201cI don\u2019t have any\u201d and\nbe done with it. It wasn\u2019t until roughly 3 B.C.E. that 0 appeared in Mesopotamia. It was independently discovered (or\ninvented!) in the Mayan culture around 4 C.E. it made its appearance in India in the 400s C.E., and began to spread at\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 Early Numeration Systems 275\nthat point. It wasn\u2019t developed earlier mostly because positional systems were not yet fully developed. Once\npositional systems arose, the need to represent a missing power had to be addressed.\nSo how do we convert from Babylonian numbers to Hindu-Arabic numbers? To do so, we need to use the symbols from\nTable 4.1, and then place values based on powers of 60. If you have digits in the Babylonian number, you multiply the\nfirst \u201cdigit\u201d by 60 raised to one less than the number of \u201cdigits.\u201d You then continue through the \u201cdigits,\u201d multiplying each\nby 60 raised to a power that is one smaller. However, be careful of spaces, since they represent a zero in that place.\nEXAMPLE4.4\nConverting Two-Digit Babylonian Numbers to Hindu-Arabic Numbers\nConvert the Babylonian number\ninto a Hindu-Arabic number.\nSolution\nhas two digits:\nand\nStep 1:So the first symbol,\nrepresents 4 in the Babylonian system. This is multiplied by 60 to the first power (just as would happen in a two digit\nnumber), which gives us .\nStep 2:The next symbol is\nwhich represents 27 in the Babylonian system.

Similar to the Babylonians, the Mayans would repeat symbols to\nindicate certain values. A single dot was a 1, two dots were a 2, up to four dots. Then a five was a horizontal bar. The\nhorizontal bars could be used three times, since the fourth horizontal bar would make a 20, which was a new position in\nthe number. The 0 was a special picture, which appears like a turtle lying on its back. The shell would then be \"empty,\" so\nmaybe that\u2019s why the symbol was 0. The complete list is provided inTable 4.2. Another feature of Mayan numbers was\nthat they were written vertically. The powers of 20 increased from bottom to top.\nTable4.2Mayan Numerals\nTo summarize, theMayan system of numbersused repeating symbol to indicate more than one, used place values, and\nemployed a 0. So how do we convert from Mayan numbers to Hindu-Arabic numbers? To do so, we need to use the\nsymbols fromTable 4.2and then place values based on powers of 20. If you have digits in the Mayan number, you\nmultiply the first \u201cdigit\u201d by 20 raised to one less than the number of \u201cdigits.\u201d You then continue through the \u201cdigits,\u201d\nmultiplying each by 20 raised to a power that is one smaller than the previous power.

Convert the Mayan number into a Hindu-Arabic number.\nWHO KNEW?\nThe Mayan Calendar\nThe Mayans used this base 20 system for everyday situations. But their culturally important, and extremely accurate,\ncalendar system used a slightly different system. For their calendars, they used a system where the place values were\n1, 20, then 20*18, then 20*18*18. The reason for this is 20*18 is 360, which is closer to the number of days in a year.\nHad they used a purely base 20 system for their calendar, they\u2019d be very far off with 400 days in a year.\nThree hundred sixty days still left the Mayans a bit short, as there are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years). The\nMayan calendar also included 5 days, called Wayeb days, which brings their calendar to 365 days. As it happens,\nWayeb is the Mayan god of misfortune, so these 5 days were considered the bad luck days.\nVIDEO\nConverting Mayan Numbers to Hindu-Arabic Numbers(https://openstax.org /r/Mayan_to_Hindu-Arabic_Numbers)\nUnderstand and Convert Between Roman Numerals and Hindu-Arabic Numerals\nThe Mayan and Babylonian systems shared two features, one of which we are familiar with (place value) and one that we\ndon\u2019t use (repeated symbols). TheRoman system of numbersused repeated symbols, but does not employ a place\nvalue. It also lacks a 0. The Roman system is built on the following symbols inTable 4.3.\nRoman Numeral Hindu-Arabic Value\nI 1\nV 5\nX 10\nL 50\nTable4.3Roman Numerals 284 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nRoman Numeral Hindu-Arabic Value\nC 100\nD 500\nM 1,000\nTable4.3Roman Numerals\nAs in the Mayan and Babylonian systems, a symbol may be repeated to indicate a larger value. However, at 4, they did\nnot use IIII. They instead used IV. Since the I came before the V, the number stands for \u201cone before five.\u201d A similar\nprocess was used for 9, which was written IX, or \u201cone before ten.\u201d The value 40 was written XL, or \u201cten before fifty,\u201d while\n49 was written XLIX, or \u201cforty plus nine.\u201d\nThe following are the rules for writing and reading Roman numerals.\n\u2022 The representations for bigger values precede those for smaller values.\n\u2022 Up to three symbols may be grouped together; for example, III for 3, or XXX for 30, or CC for 200.\n\u2022 A larger value followed by a smaller value indicated addition; for example, VII for 7, XIII for 13, LV for 55, and MCC\nfor 1200.\n\u2022 I can be placed before V to indicate 4, or before X, to indicate 9. These are the only ways I is used as a subtraction.\n\u2022 X can be placed before L to indicate 40, and before C to indicate 90. These are the only ways X is used as a\nsubtraction.\n\u2022 C can be placed before D to indicate 400, and before M to indicate 900. These are the only ways C is used as a\nsubtraction.\n\u2022 If multiple symbols are used, and a subtraction involving that symbol, the subtraction part comes after the multiple\nsymbols. For example, XXIX for 29 and CCXC for 290.\nWHO KNEW?\nLegacy of Roman Numerals\nThe Roman numbering system is still used today in some situations. Many cornerstones of buildings have the year\nwritten in Roman numerals. Movie titles often represent the year the movie was produced as Roman numerals. The\nmost recognizable might be that the Super Bowl is numbered using Roman numerals.\nEXAMPLE4.10\nConverting Roman Numerals to Hindu-Arabic Numbers\nConvert the following Roman numerals into Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n1. XXVII\n2. XXXIV\n3. MMCMXLVIII\nSolution\n1. The numeral XXVII begins with two X\u2019s, which is then followed by a V. So, the two X\u2019s combine to be 20. The V is\nfollowed by two I\u2019s, so the V indicates the addition of 5. The two I\u2019s that follow indicate addition of two. That ends the\nsymbols, so the value is 20 plus 5 plus 2, or 27 in Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n2. The numeral XXXIV begins with three X\u2019s, which is then followed by an I. So, the three X\u2019s combine to be 30. The I is\nfollowed by a V, which indicates 4. That ends the symbols, so the value is 30 plus 4, or 34 in Hindu-Arabic numerals.\n3. The numeral MMCMXLVIII begins with two M\u2019s, which is then followed by a C. So, the two M\u2019s combine to make\n2000. The C is followed by an M, which indicates 900. The CM is followed by XL, which indicates 40. The L is followed\nby V, which indicates 5. The V is followed by three I\u2019s, indicating 3.

(credit: modification of work\n\u201cIMAG0933\u201d by yvanhou/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Convert another base to base 10.\n2. Write numbers in different base systems.\n3. Convert base 10 to other bases.\n4. Determine errors in converting between bases.\nIn our system of numbers, we use base 10, but using base 10 was not a given within other systems. There were other\nsystems that used bases other than 10, as we saw with the Mayans and the Babylonians. The base 10 system comes\ndown to grouping objects in sets of 10, but grouping in sets of 10 only happens if the culture values grouping by that 288 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nmany. We feel 10 is natural because we have 10 fingers. There are other systems using other grouping values, such as 4\nor 20.\nOne good reason for examining other bases is to remind ourselves how we had to learn arithmetic when we were\nyoung, memorizing rules for our base 10 system. We had to learn why those arithmetic rules made sense, such as why\nand . Another good reason for learning other base systems is due to computers; their circuitry\ninstead uses base 2.\nIn this section, we explore other base systems and how to convert between them.\nConversion of Another Base into Base 10 and Other Bases\nWe saw inHindu-Arabic Positional Systemthat our Hindu-Arabic system usesbase 10, which is a system using place\nvalues of digits that depend on powers of 10 (or, are based on powers of 10). We\u2019ve already worked with bases other than\nbase 10: The Babylonian system was base 60, while the Mayan system was base 20.\nTo explore how our base 10 system is used, answer the following question: What\u2019s the following quantity: 4,572? You\nprobably said four thousand five hundred seventy-two (no, there is no \u201cand\u201d between hundred and seventy). But why do\nyou think that 4 means four thousand? A very young person when learning their numbers might say that\u2019s a four five\nseven and two. But you added the context of thousands to the four. Why?\nPlace value, that\u2019s why. You learned early on that where the numeral was gave it different meanings. Ten thousands,\nthousands, hundreds, tens, and ones. So, you translate that symbol string (4,572) into \u201cfour thousand five hundred\nseventy-two.\u201d As we saw inHindu-Arabic Positional System, expanding a Hindu-Arabic number involved writing the\nnumber using each digit times its appropriate power of 10. So, we could write 4,572 as\n.\nOne possible reason we use base 10 is that we have 10 fingers, and in the cultures where the Hindu-Arabic system\ndeveloped, that became the standard. Other cultures may have used other ways of organizing numbers, perhaps using\n20 by including toes, or using 60 because 60 has many divisors. Mathematically though, base 10 is an awkward base to\nwork in since 10 has limited divisors. But we think it is easy and simple because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been taught to use.\nUsing a base 10 system means we need 10 symbols to make our numbering system work: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nNow imagine that we all only had 6 fingers instead of 10 and our counting system was based on those 6 fingers. We\nwould be counting in groups of 6, not groups of 10. How would this change how we work with quantity?\nFirst, we\u2019d need only six symbols. Let\u2019s use 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Second, our place values would be based on powers of 6, not\npowers of 10. For instance, the number 3,024 in base 6 would be . That is how you can\ntranslate a base 6 number into a base 10 number. When we calculate that expression we get\n.\nThis means the base 6 number 3,024 is equal to the base 10 number 664.\nFrom now on, if we are using a base 6 number, we will follow it with the subscript 6, like the following: 3,0246means the\nnumber is in base 6.\nA base 10 number gets no subscript (it\u2019s the standard). So, 3,024 is a base 10 number. A base 13 number would be\n4,67213.\nSo, a base 6 system uses only the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Also, the place values use powers of 6. However, we still\ndon\u2019t know how to count in base 6. In order to do so, we\u2019d have to know how to represent the quantities larger than five\nin base 6. Let\u2019s review how our base 10 system works by counting from 0 to 100, which shows how larger values are\nrepresented.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 Converting with Base Systems 289\nIn writing the base 10 numbers, you start with these first 10 values:\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nBut you\u2019ve run out of symbols. So, we use two digits:\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19\nThe 1 out front means you\u2019ve run out of digits one time.\nBut now you\u2019ve run out twice. Continuing with those numbers gives:\n20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29\nAnd so on,\n30 31 32 33 34 etc.\u2026\nEventually, you hit the 90s,\n90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99\nAnd you\u2019ve run out of the digits again! So, we say we\u2019ve run out of digits in the tens place one time, hence:\n100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109\nThat\u2019s the pattern we use in base 10. We write out the symbols until we\u2019ve used all the symbols, then add a digit in front\nthat counts how many times we\u2019ve used the digits. Knowing the numbers, or being able to count higher and higher, is\nnecessary to understand how all the arithmetic works, as it all goes back to counting.\nThe counting pattern is the same for any other base, including base 6. So, let\u2019s start:\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nBut we\u2019ve run out of symbols! Just like in base 10, we use a second digit, where the first digit will tell us we\u2019ve run out of\nsymbols one time.\n10 11 12 13 14 15\nAnd we use the same pattern:\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n30 31 32 33 34 35\n40 41 42 43 44 45\n50 51 52 53 54 55 290 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nBut we\u2019ve run out of symbols for that front digit. So, we indicate it the same way as in base 10\u2026by adding a third digit in\nfront, indicating we\u2019ve run out of symbols once in the second place:\n100 101 102 103 104 105\n110 111 etc.\nThe symbol pattern is the same, but truncated. We only use the six symbols. So that is how we represent base 6. Being\nable to write out these numbers is important when working with addition in the base.\nWhen using a base larger than 10, though, we need more symbols. Instead of creating new symbols, we use capital\nletters, with A representing the digit for \"10,\" B representing the digit for \"11,\" and so on.\nEXAMPLE4.12\nDetermining Digits of a Base with Less Than 10 Digits\nWhat are the digits used for base 7?\nSolution\nSince this is base 7, we need only 7 symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nYOUR TURN4.12\n1. What are the digits for base 4?\nEXAMPLE4.13\nDetermining Digits of a Base with More Than 10 Digits\nWhat are the digits used for base 14?\nSolution\nSince this is base 14, we need 14 symbols. We don\u2019t have single character numbers for 10, 11, 12, and 13, so, in a fit of\ninspired creativity, we use capital letters A, B, C, D to represent those quantities. So, the digits in base 14 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D.\nYOUR TURN4.13\n1. What are the digits used for base 12?\nWHO KNEW?\nUsing Base 12\nAs mentioned in the text, working in base 10 is mathematically awkward. Ten has only two natural number divisors: 2\nand 5. This means dividing into groups is not easy. However, 12, or a dozen, has more divisors: 2, 3, 4, and 6. The\nDozenal Society recognizes this more mathematically pleasant detail. It advocates for a switch to using base 12 for\nnumbers. Their argument is based on the divisibility of the number 12. But has there ever been a society that used\nsuch a system? The answer is yes. A dialect of the Gwandara language in Nigeria uses the base 12 system. It is\nunlikely, though, that the Dozenal Society will achieve their goal, as the base 10 system is so entrenched in our\nsociety.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 Converting with Base Systems 291\nEXAMPLE4.14\nConverting from One Base into Another\nConvert 3,6017into base 10.\nSolution\nIn base 7, the place values are powers of 7.

Convert 110112into base 10.\nWHO KNEW?\nBefore Napoleon\nBefore Napoleon\u2019s France, which adopted the base 10 system, a modified base 12 system was often used in Europe.\nTwelve is easily divisible into groups of 2, 3, 4, and 6, which makes it easier to work with. Even our numbering system\nretains a bit of this. You have likely noticed that we use the wordsthirteen,fourteen,fifteen, and so on to indicate 10\nand 3, 10 and 4, 10 and 5, and so one. Even the 20s reinforce this idea, as in twenty-one, and twenty-two. However,\ntwo numbers don\u2019t follow this pattern, namely 11 and 12. If they followed the same rules, they\u2019d be one teen and two\nteen. We even have a special word for 12; that is, a dozen. However, etymologically speaking, the wordselevenand\ntwelveare likely derived by referencing the number 10.

Objects were\ninitially grouped into collections of four, and a collection of four was referred to askauna. A person could have two\nkaunaand three \u201cones\u201d (in Hindu-Arabic, 11). Or they could have eightkaunaand one \u201cones\u201d (In Hindu-Arabic, 33).\nHowever, sets of four were grouped in collections of 10. A set of 10kaunawaska\u2019au. The collections ofka\u2019auwere\ngrouped by 10 also. Which meant that 10ka\u2019au(this is 40 in Hindu-Arabic) would belau(or 400 in Hindu-Arabic). What\nthis shows is that the Hawaiian culture developed a system that used base 4 combined with base 10.\nConversion of Base 10 into Another Base\nConverting from base 10 into another base uses repeated division, recording theremainderat each step. Then, the\nnumber in the new base is the remainder starting from the last remainder found. To be accurate in what we\u2019re saying,\nwe need to remind ourselves of some terminology associated with division. When integers are divided, the one being\ndivided is thedividend, and the one that is dividing the dividend is thedivisor. Thequotientis the largest natural\nnumber that can be multiplied by the divisor where the product is less than the dividend.\nWhen the integer is divided by the integer , is called thedividendand is thedivisor.\nTo convert a base 10 number into base , we divide by , recording the remainder. Then we divide the quotient from\nthat step by the base , and record the remainder again. We continue this process until the quotient is 0. Then, the base\nnumber has digits that start with the last remainder and use each remainder in reverse order.\nEXAMPLE4.21\nConverting from Base 10 into a Lower Base\nConvert 298 to base 6.\nSolution\nWe divide 298 by 6, and record the remainder. Then we divide the quotient from that step by 6, and record the remainder\nagain. We continue this process until the quotient is 0. Then, the base 6 number has digits that start with the last\nremainder and use each remainder in reverse order.\nStep 1:When we divide 298 by 6, we get . The quotient is 49 and the remainder is 4.\nStep 2:Now we divide the quotient, 49, by 6. This gives . The quotient is 8 and the remainder is 1.\nStep 3:Repeating, we get . The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 2.\nStep 4:Finally, we perform the operation on the quotient 1, giving us a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1.\nStep 5:The base 6 number has digits equal to the remainders in reverse order, 12146. So, 298 in base 10 when converted\nto base 6 is 12146.\nYOUR TURN4.21\n1.

Then we divide the quotient from that step by 13, and record the\nremainder again. We continue this process until the quotient is 0. Then, the base 13 number has digits that start with the\nlast remainder and use each remainder in reverse order. It is at this step that we\u2019ll convert to the base 13 digits, which\nare 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C.\nStep 1:When we divide 45,134 by 13, we get . The quotient is 3,471 and the remainder is 11.\nStep 2:Now we divide the quotient, 3,471, by 13. This gives . The quotient is 267 and the remainder is 0.\nStep 3:Repeating, we get . The quotient is 20 and the remainder is 7.\nStep 4:Again, and we get . The quotient is 1 and the remainder is 7.\nStep 5:Finally, we get , with quotient 0 and a remainder 1.\nStep 6:The base 13 number has digits equal to the remainders in reverse order, which were 1, 7, 7, 0, and 11. The 11 is\nwritten as B in base 13. So, 45,134 in base 10 when converted to base 13 is 1770B13.\nYOUR TURN4.22\n1.

Convert 137 to base 2.\nConverting from Hindu-Arabic Numbers to Mayan Numbers\nTo convert from a Hindu-Arabic number to a Mayan number involves two distinct processes. First, the number must be\nconverted to base 20, using the process described and demonstrated previously. Next, that base 20 number has to be\nwritten using Mayan numerals. For reference, the Mayan numerals and their values are below.\nEXAMPLE4.24\nConverting from Base 10 into the Mayan System\nConvert the following into Mayan numbers.\n1. 51\n2. 653\nSolution\n1. The Mayan system is base 20, so we must use 20 in the process from above. The first division has a quotient of 2\nand remainder of 11. The 11 serves as the \u201cones\u201d digit. Dividing that quotient, 2, by 20 has a quotient of 0 with a\nremainder of 2. The 2 becomes the \u201ctwenties\u201d digit of the number. So, in base 20, the number would be 2 followed\nby 11. The Mayan symbols for 2 and 11 are and . Writing these vertically, with the \u201cones\u201d digit on top, as\nappropriate for Mayan numbers, results in:\n2. The Mayan system is base 20, so we must use 20 in the process from above. The first division, 673 divided by 20, has\na quotient of 32 and remainder of 13. Dividing that quotient, 32, by 20 has a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 12.\nDividing that quotient, 1, by 20 has a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1. Since there are three remainders here, this\nis a three-digit number. The 1 is the \u201c20-squared\u201d digit, the 12 is the \u201ctwenties\u201d digit, and the 13 is the \u201cones\u201d digit.\nSo, in base 20, the number would be 1 followed by 12 followed by 13.. The Mayan symbols for 1, 12 and 13 are ,\n, and . Writing these vertically, as appropriate for Mayan numbers, would result in:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 Converting with Base Systems 297\nYOUR TURN4.24\nConvert the following into Mayan numbers.\n1. 137\n2. 2,171\nWHO KNEW?\nOther Languages, Other Bases\nThere have been base systems that use bases other than 10.

Visitthis site to\nsee more on the languages that used other bases(https://openstax.org/r/number-systems_other_languages).\nErrors in Converting Between Bases\nThere are some common errors that are made when converting between bases. Often, it comes down to using an\n\u201cillegal\u201d symbol in the new base.\nEXAMPLE4.25\nDetecting an Illegal Symbol When Converting Between Bases\nA base 10 number is converted to base 7 and the result was 20817. Was an error committed? How do you know?\nSolution\nThe result has the digit 8 in it. In base 7, 8 is an illegal symbol. Based on that, an error was committed.\nYOUR TURN4.25\n1. A base 10 number is converted to base 4 and the result was 37024. Was an error committed? How do you know?\nWhen converting from base 10 to another base, an illegal symbol will be used if a mistake was made in the division\nprocess used to find the number in the new base. Since the digits are based on the remainders, any remainder that is an\nillegal symbol would indicate an error.\nEXAMPLE4.26\nDetecting an Error in Division When Converting Between Bases\nWhen changing from base 10 to base 8, the division process resulted in the following remainders: 1, 0, 9, 2, 4. Was an\nerror committed? How do you know?\nSolution\nThe remainders include 9, which in base 8 is an illegal symbol.\nYOUR TURN4.26\n1. When changing from base 10 to base 6, the division process resulted in the following remainders: 5, 0, 0, 10. Was\nan error committed? How do you know? 298 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nAnother possible way to detect an error in converting between bases is to count the number of digits. When converting\nfrom a higher base to a lower base, the number of digits cannot get smaller. Similarly, when converting from a lower\nbase to a higher base, the number of digits cannot get bigger. So, if a base 10 number is converted to a base 3 number,\nthe number of digits in the new base 3 numbers cannot be less than the number of digits in the base 10 number.\nSimilarly, if a base 7 number is converted to base 10, the number of digits in the base 10 number cannot be more than\nthe number of digits in the original base 7 number.\nEXAMPLE4.27\nDetecting an Error in Number of Digits When Converting Between Bases\nA five-digit base 10 number is converted to a base 5 number. The base 5 number has four digits. Was an error\ncommitted? How do you know?\nSolution\nSince 10 is larger than 5, the base 5 number cannot have less digits than the base 10 number.

Add and subtract in bases 2\u20139 and 12.\n2. Identify errors in adding and subtracting in bases 2\u20139 and 12.\nOnce we decide on a system for counting, we need to establish rules for combining the numbers we\u2019re using. This begins\nwith the rules for addition and subtraction. We are familiar with base 10 arithmetic, such as or . How\ndoes that change if we instead use a different base? A larger base? A smaller one? In particular, computers use base 2 for\nall number representation. When your calculator adds or subtracts, multiplies or divides, it uses base 2. This is because\nthe circuitry recognizes only two things, high current and low current, which means the system is uses only has two\nsymbols. Which is what base 2 is.\nIn this section, we use addition and subtraction in bases other than 10 by referencing the processes of base 10, but\napplied to a new base system.\nAddition in Bases Other Than Base 10\nNow that we understand what it means for numbers to be expressed in a base other than 10, we can look at arithmetic\nusing other bases, starting with addition. When you think back to when you first learned addition, it is very likely you\nlearned the addition table. Once you knew the addition table, you moved on to addition of numbers with more than one\ndigit. The same process holds for addition in other bases. We begin with an addition table, and then move on to adding\nnumbers with two or more digits.\nWe worked with base 6 earlier, and have the numbers in base 6 up to 1006. Using that table of values, we can create the\nbase 6 addition table.\nHere\u2019s the beginning of the base 6 addition table:\n+ 0 1 2 3 4 5\n0 0 1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 2 3 4 5 ?\n2 2 3 4 5 ? ?\n3 3 4 5 ? ? ?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.4 \u2022 Addition and Subtraction in Base Systems 301\n4 4 5 ? ? ? ?\n5 5 ? ? ? ? ?\nMany of the cells are not filled out. The ones filled in are values that never get past 5, which is the largest legal symbol in\nbase 6, so they are acceptable symbols. But what do we do with 5 + 3 in base 6? We can\u2019t represent the answer as \u201c8\u201d\nsince \u201c8\u201d is not a symbol available to us. Let\u2019s go back to the list of numbers we have for base 6.\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n10 11 12 13 14 15\n20 21 22 23 24 25\n30 31 32 33 34 35\n40 41 42 43 44 45\n50 51 52 53 54 55\nSo, what is 5 + 1 equal to in base 6? Well, start at the 5, and jump ahead one step. You land on 10.\nThis means that, in base 6, 5 + 1 = 10.\nSo, what is 5 + 2 in base 6? Well, 5 + 2 = 5 + 1 + 1, so 10 + 1\u2026jump one more space and you land on 11. So, 5 + 2 = 11 in\nbase 6. 302 4 \u2022 Number Representation and Calculation\nAnd so it goes.

Multiply and divide in bases other than 10.\n2. Identify errors in multiplying and dividing in bases other than 10.\nJust as inAddition and Subtraction in Base Systems, once we decide on a system for counting, we need to establish rules\nfor combining the numbers we\u2019re using. This includes the rules for multiplication and division. We are familiar with those\noperations in base 10. How do they change if we instead use a different base? A larger base? A smaller one?\nIn this section, we usemultiplication and division in basesother than 10 by referencing the processes of base 10, but\napplied to a new base system.\nMultiplication in Bases Other Than 10\nMultiplication is a way of representing repeated additions, regardless of what base is being used. However, different\nbases have different addition rules. In order to create the multiplication tables for a base other than 10, we need to rely\non addition and the addition table for the base. So let\u2019s look at multiplication in base 6.\nMultiplication still has the same meaning as it does in base 10, in that is 4 added to itself six times,\n.\nSo, let\u2019s apply that to base 6. It should be clear that 0 multiplied by anything, regardless of base, will give 0, and that 1\nmultiplied by anything, regardless of base, will be the value of \u201canything.\u201d\nStep 1:So, we start with the table below:\n* 0 1 2 3 4 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.5 \u2022 Multiplication and Division in Base Systems 315\n1 0 1 2 3 4 5\n2 0 2 4\n3 0 3\n4 0 4\n5 0 5\nStep 2:Notice is there.

Here is demonstrated:\n.\nThis is done by using the addition rules fromAddition and Subtraction in Base Systems, namely that , and\nthen applying the addition processes we\u2019ve always known, but with the base 6 table (Table 4.4).

Is that similar to what happens in base 10?\nTo summarize the creation of a multiplication in a base other than base 10, you need the addition table of the base with\nwhich you are working. Create the table, and calculate the entries of the multiplication table by performing repeated\naddition in that base. The table needs to be drawn only the one time.\nEXAMPLE4.38\nCreating a Multiplication Table for a Base Lower Than 10\nCreate the multiplication table for base 7.\nSolution\nStep 1:Let\u2019s apply the process demonstrated and outlined above to find the base 7 multiplication table.

Computing an\nexponent is done by multiplying the base by itself the number of times equal to the exponent.\n\u2022 The system of numbers currently used is the Hindu-Arabic system. Digits in this system take on values based on\ntheir place in the number. The place values are determined by multiplying the digit by 10 raised to the appropriate\npower.\n\u2022 The expanded form of a Hindu-Arabic number is the sum of each digit times 10 raised to the exponent for that place\nvalue.\n4.2Early Numeration Systems\n\u2022 Historically, there have been many systems for numbering. One system is an additive system, in which symbols are\nrepeated to express larger numbers. Another system is a positional system, in which the digits and their positions\ndetermine the quantity being represented.\n\u2022 The Babylonian system was a combination of a positional and additive system. It used 60 as its base. Using that in\nthe positional system makes it possible to convert between Babylonian and Hindu-Arabic numbers.\n\u2022 The Mayan system was a combination of a positional and additive system. It used 20 as its base. Using that in the\npositional system makes it possible to convert between Mayan and Hindu-Arabic numbers.\n\u2022 The Roman system was an additive system. Knowing what each symbol represents makes it possible to convert\nbetween Roman and Hindu-Arabic numbers.\n4.3Converting with Base Systems\n\u2022 The system we use is the base 10 system. Base 10 is not the only base that can be used. To use another base, one\ncould start with a list of numbers in that base.\n\u2022 To indicate that a number is written in a base other than 10, a subscript is appended to the end of the number. That\nsubscript indicates the base for the number.\n\u2022 Numbers written in a base smaller than 10 use the same symbols as base 10. However, when using bases larger 328 4 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nthan 10, the symbols A, B, C, \u2026 are used to represent digits larger than 9.\n\u2022 To convert from a number written in a base other than 10 into a base 10 number, the number is written in expanded\nform and then that expression is computed.\n\u2022 To convert a number from base 10 into another base, the base 10 number is repeatedly divided by the new base.\nThe remainders when performing these divisions become the digits for the number in the new base.\n\u2022 Common errors can be detected when performing base conversions.\n4.4Addition and Subtraction in Base Systems\n\u2022 Addition tables for bases other than 10 can be built using the same processes that are used in base 10, including\nusing a number line.\n\u2022 Addition in bases other than base 10 use the same processes as addition in base 10, but use the addition table for\nthat base.\n\u2022 Subtraction in bases other than base 10 use the same processes as subtraction in base 10, but use the addition\ntable for that base.\n4.5Multiplication and Division in Base Systems\n\u2022 Multiplication tables for bases other than 10 can be built using the same processes that are used in base 10,\nincluding using repeated addition and the addition table for the base.\n\u2022 Multiplication in bases other than base 10 use the same processes as multiplication in base 10, but use the\nmultiplication table for that base.\n\u2022 Basic division in bases other than base 10 use the same processes as basic division in base 10, where the missing\nfactor process is used.\nVideos\n4.1Hindu-Arabic Positional System\n\u2022 Exponential Notation(https://openstax.org/r/Exponential_Notation)\n4.2Early Numeration Systems\n\u2022 Converting Between Babylonian and Hindu-Arabic numbers(https://openstax.org/r/Babylonian_to_Hindu-\nArabic_Numbers)\n\u2022 Converting Mayan Numbers to Hindu-Arabic Numbers(https://openstax.org /r/Mayan_to_Hindu-Arabic_Numbers)\n\u2022 Converting From Roman Numbers to Hindu-Arabic Numbers(https://openstax.org/r/Roman_to_Hindu-\nArabic_Numbers)\n\u2022 Converting From Hindu-Arabic Numbers to Roman Numbers(https://openstax.org/r/Hindu-\nArabic_to_Roman_Numbers)\n4.3Converting with Base Systems\n\u2022 Convert Base 7 to Base 10(https://openstax.org/r/Convert_Base_7_to_Base_10)\n\u2022 Converting from Base 10 to Another Base(https://openstax.org/r/Base_10_to_Another_Base)\nProjects\nAdditive Systems\nGo online.

Many students struggle with the idea that\nmathematics can include situations that aren\u2019t static and do change. In elementary arithmetic, a situation such as:\nis a static situation and will yield the answer of 8 every time. However, a situation such as:\ncan yield many different answers because the answer depends on what amount (number) that represents. Since the\nvalue of can vary (represent different values), it is known as a variable.\nAlgebra is useful to better model real life situations. In the first equation shown, can only model situations\nwhere you add those two numbers together. For example, if your uncle gives you five dollars and your aunt gives you\nthree dollars, then you will always receive eight dollars. The second equation can model more complex\nsituations. For example, you wish to buy a game that costs $38 but you only have three dollars. Your uncle will pay you\nfive dollars an hour to work for him. If you\u2019ve worked five hours, have you earned enough money? If not, how many\nhours will you have to work?\nAlgebra and algebraic thinking open up a world of possibilities that arithmetic alone cannot do. 334 5 \u2022 Algebra\n5.1 Algebraic Expressions\nFigure5.2Two college graduates!

Convert between written and symbolic algebraic expressions and equations.\n2. Simplify and evaluate algebraic expressions.\n3. Add and subtract algebraic expressions.\n4. Multiply and divide algebraic expressions.\nAlgebraic expressionsare the building blocks of algebra. While a numerical expression (also known as an arithmetic\nexpression) like can represent only a single number, an algebraic expression such as can represent many\ndifferent numbers. This section will introduce you to algebraic expressions, how to create them, simplify them, and\nperform arithmetic operations on them.\nAlgebraic Expressions and Equations\nXavier and Yasenia have the same birthday, but they were born in different years. This year Xavier is 20 years old and\nYasenia is 23, so Yasenia is three years older than Xavier. When Xavier was 15, Yasenia was 18. When Xavier will be 33,\nYasenia will be 36. No matter what Xavier\u2019s age is, Yasenia\u2019s age will always be 3 years more.\nIn the language of algebra, we say that Xavier's age and Yasenia's age are variable and the 3 is a constant. The ages\nchange, or vary, so age is avariable. The 3 years between them always stays the same or has the same value, so the age\ndifference is theconstant. In algebra, letters of the alphabet are used to represent variables. The letters most often\nused for variables are , , , , , and . Suppose we call Xavier's age . Then we could use to represent Yasenia's\nage, as shown in the table below.\nXavier\u2019s Age Yasenia\u2019s Age\n15 18\n20 23\n33 36\nTo write algebraically, we need some symbols as well as numbers and variables.

He introduced these ideas in his publication ofLa Geometrie,\nwhich was printed in 1637. In this publication, he also used the letters , , and to represent known quantities. There\nis a (possibly fictitious) story that, when the book was being printed for the first time, the printer began to run short\nof the last three letters of the alphabet. So the printer asked Descartes if it mattered which of , , or were used for\nthe mathematical equations in the book. Descartes decided it made no difference to him; so the printer decided to\nuse predominantly for the mathematics in the book, because the letters and would occur more often in the\nbody of the text (written in French) than the letter would! This might explain why the letter is still used today as\nthe most common variable to represent unknown quantities in algebra.\nSimplifying and Evaluating Algebraic Expressions\nTosimplify an expressionmeans to do all the math possible. For example, to simplify we would first multiply\nto get 8 and then add 1 to get 9. We have introduced most of the symbols and notation used in algebra, but now\nwe need to clarify the order of operations. Otherwise, expressions may have different meanings, and they may result in\ndifferent values. Consider . Do you add first or multiply first? Do you get different answers?\nAdd first: Multiply first: Which one is correct?\nEarly on, mathematicians realized the need to establish some guidelines when performing arithmetic operations to\nensure that everyone would get the same answer. Those guidelines are called the order of operations and are listed in\nthe table below.\nStep 1:Parentheses and Other Simplify all expressions inside the parentheses or other grouping symbols,\nGrouping Symbols working on the innermost parentheses first.\nStep 2:Exponents Simplify all expressions with exponents.\nStep 3:Multiplication and Perform all multiplication and division in order from left to right. These\nDivision operations have equal priority.\nStep 4:Addition and Subtraction Perform all addition and subtraction in order from left to right. These operations\nhave equal priority.\nYou may have heard about Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally or PEMDAS. Be careful to notice in Steps 3 and 4 in the\ntable above that multiplication and division, as well as addition and subtraction, happen in order from LEFT to\nRIGHT. It is possible, for example, to have PEDMAS or PEMDSA. The PEMDAS trick can be misleading if not fully\nunderstood!\nEXAMPLE5.5\nMaking a Numerical Equation True Using the Order of Operations\nUse parentheses to make the following statements true.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 Algebraic Expressions 339\nSolution\n1.

Now we'll evaluate some\nexpressions\u2014again following the order of operations. To evaluate an expression means to find the value of the\nexpression when the variable is replaced by a given number.\nEXAMPLE5.6\nEvaluating and Simplifying an Expression\n1. Evaluate when .\n2. Evaluate when .\nSolution\n1. To evaluate, let in the expression, and then simplify: .\n2. To evaluate, let in the expression, and then simplify: .\nYOUR TURN5.6\n1. Evaluate when .\n2. Evaluate when .\nOperations of Algebraic Expressions\nAlgebraic expressions are made up ofterms. A term is a constant or the product of a constant and one or more\nvariables. Examples of terms are 7, , 5 , 9 , and . The constant that multiplies the variable is called thecoefficient.\nThink of the coefficient as the number in front of the variable. Consider the algebraic expressions 5 , which has a\ncoefficient of 5, and 9 , which has a coefficient of 9. If there is no number listed in front of the variable, then the\ncoefficient is 1 since .\nSome terms share common traits. When two terms are constants or have the same variable and exponent, we say they\narelike terms. If there are like terms in an expression, you can simplify the expression by combining the like terms. We\nadd the coefficients and keep the same variable.\nEXAMPLE5.7\nAdding Algebraic Expressions\nAdd .\nSolution\nStep 1:Add the terms in any order and get the same result (think: ) and drop the parentheses: 340 5 \u2022 Algebra\nStep 2:Group like terms together:\nStep 3:Combine the like terms:\nYOUR TURN5.7\n1. Add .\nEXAMPLE5.8\nSubtracting Algebraic Expressions\nSubtract .\nSolution\nStep 1:Distribute the negative inside the parentheses (think: , which is the correct\nanswer). You cannot just drop the parentheses (for example, , which is not correct as we have\nalready verified the answer is 3):\nStep 2:Group like terms together:\nStep 3:Combine the like terms:\nYOUR TURN5.8\n1. Subtract .\nBefore looking at multiplying algebraic expressions we look at theDistributive Property, which says that to multiply a\nsum, first you multiply each term in the sum and then you add the products. For example,\ncan also be solved as . If we use a variable, then\n.\nWe can extended this example to , which can\nalso be solved as . If we use variables, then\n.\nFORMULA\nDistributive Property:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 Algebraic Expressions 341\nEXAMPLE5.9\nSimplifying an Expression Using the Order of Operations\nSimplify each expression.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nSolution\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nYOUR TURN5.9\nSimplify each expression.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nEXAMPLE5.10\nMultiplying Algebraic Expressions\nMultiply .\nSolution\nStep 1:Use the Distributive Property:\nStep 2:Multiply:\nStep 3:Combine the like terms:\nYOUR TURN5.10\n1. Multiply .\nYou may have heard the term FOIL which stands for: First, Outer, Inner, Last. FOIL essentially describes a way to use\nthe Distributive Property if you multiply a two-term expression by another two-term expression, but FOIL only works\nin that specific situation. For example, suppose you have a two-term expression multiplied by a three-term\nexpression, such as .What terms qualify as inner terms and what terms qualify as outer terms? In 342 5 \u2022 Algebra\nthis particular situation, FOIL cannot possibly work; the multiplication of should yield six terms,\nwhere FOIL is designed to only give you four! The Distributive Property works regardless of how many terms there\nare. FOIL can be misleading and applied inappropriately if not fully understood!\nEXAMPLE5.11\nDividing Algebraic Expressions\nDivide .\nSolution\nDivide EACH term by 4 :\nYOUR TURN5.11\n1. Divide .\nBe careful how you divide! Sometimes students incorrectly divide only one term on top by the bottom term. For\nexample, might turn into if done incorrectly. When we divide expressions, EACH\nterm is divided by the divisor. So, If you forget, it is always a good\nidea to check these rules by creating an example using numerical expressions. For example, .\nDividing each term on top by 3 would yield ,which is the correct answer.\nHowever, if you just divided the 9 on top by the 3 on the bottom, getting ,this does not\nresult in the correct answer.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 Algebraic Expressions 343\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nAl-Khwarizmi\nFigure5.3Al-Khwarizmi\nAbu Ja\u2019far Muhammad ibn Musa Al-Khwarizmi was born around 780 AD, probably in or around the region of\nKhwarizm, which is now part of modern-day Uzbekistan. For most of his adult life, he worked as a scholar at the\nHouse of Wisdom in Baghdad, Iraq. He wrote many mathematical works during his life, but is probably most famous\nfor his bookAl-kitab al-muhtasar fi hisab al-jabr w\u2019al\u2019muqabalah, which translates toThe Condensed Book on the\nCalculation of al-Jabr(completion)and al\u2019muqabalah(balancing).

Solve linear equations in one variable using properties of equations.\n2. Construct a linear equation to solve applications.\n3. Determine equations with no solution or infinitely many solutions.\n4. Solve a formula for a given variable.\nIn this section, we will study linear equations in one variable. There are several real-world scenarios that can be\nrepresented by linear equations: taxi rentals with a flat fee and a rate per mile; cell phone bills that charge a monthly fee\nplus a separate rate per text; gym memberships with a monthly fee plus a rate per class taken; etc. For example, if you\njoin your local gym at $10 per month and pay $5 per class, how many classes can you take if your gym budget is $75 per\nmonth?\nLinear Equations and Applications\nSolving any equation is like discovering the answer to a puzzle. The purpose of solving an equation is to find the value or\nvalues of the variable that makes the equation a true statement. Any value of the variable that makes the equation true\nis called a solution to the equation. It is the answer to the puzzle! There are many types of equations that we will learn to\nsolve. In this section, we will focus on alinear equation, which is an equation in one variable that can be written as\nwhere and are real numbers and , such that is the coefficient of and is the constant.\nTo solve a linear equation, it is a good idea to have an overall strategy that can be used to solve any linear equation. In\nthe Example 5.12, we will give the steps of a general strategy for solving any linear equation.

Welsh mathematician and physician Robert Recorde is given credit for\ninventing the modern sign. It first appears in writing inThe Whetstone of Witte, a book Recorde wrote about algebra,\nwhich was published in 1557. In this book, Recorde states, \"I will set as I do often in work use, a pair of parallels, or\nGemowe (twin) lines of one length, thus: ===, because no two things can be more equal.\" Although his version of the\nsign was a bit longer than the one we use today, his idea stuck and \"=\" is used throughout the world to indicate\nequality in mathematics.\nInAlgebraic Expressions, you translated an English sentence into an equation. In this section, we take that one step\nfurther and translate an English paragraph into an equation, and then we solve the equation. We can go back to the\nopening question in this section:If you join your local gym at $10 per month and pay $5 per class, how many classes can\nyou take if your gym budget is $75 per month?We can create an equation for this scenario and then solve the equation\n(seeExample 5.15).\nEXAMPLE5.14\nConstructing a Linear Equation to Solve an Application\nThe Beaudrie family has two cats, Basil and Max.

Graph inequalities in one variable.\n2. Solve linear inequalities in one variable.\n3. Construct a linear inequality to solve applications.\nIn this section, we will study linear inequalities in one variable. Inequalities can be used when the possible values\n(answers) in a certain situation are numerous, not just a few, or when the exact value (answer) is not known but it is\nknown to be within a range of possible values. There are many real-world scenarios that can be represented by linear\ninequalities. For example, consider the survey of the mayoral election inFigure 5.5Surveys and polls are usually\nconducted with only a small group of people. The margin of error indicates a range of how the actual group of voters\nwould vote given the results of the survey. This range can be expressed using inequalities.\nAnother example involves college tuition. Say a local community college charges $113 per credit hour. You budget $1,500\nfor tuition this fall semester. What are the number of credit hours that you could take this fall? Since this answer could be\nmany different values, it can be expressed as an inequality.\nGraphing Inequalities on the Number Line\nInAlgebraic Expressions, we introduced equality and the symbol. In this section, we look at inequality and the symbols\n, , , and . The table below summarizes the symbols and their meaning.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Linear Inequalities in One Variable with Applications 357\nSymbol Meaning\nless than\ngreater than\nless than or equal to\ngreater than or equal to\nSuppose you had the inequality statement . What possible number or numbers would make the inequality\ntrue? If you are thinking, \" could be 4,\" that's correct, but could also be 5, 6, 37, 1 million, or even 3.001. The number\nof solutions is infinite; any number greater than 3 is a solution to the inequality .\nRather than trying to list all possible solutions, we show all the solutions to the inequality on the number line. All\nthe numbers to the right of 3 on the number line are shaded, to show that all numbers greater than 3 are solutions. At\nthe number 3 itself, an open parenthesis is drawn, since the number 3 is not part of the solutions of .\nWe can also represent inequalities using interval notation. There is no upper end to the solution to this inequality. In\ninterval notation, we express as . The symbol is read as \"infinity.\" Infinity is not an actual number.Figure\n5.6shows both the number line and the interval notation for .\nFigure5.6The inequality is graphed on this number line and written in interval notation.\nWe used the left parenthesis symbol to show that the endpoint of the inequality is not included. Parentheses are used\nwhen the endpoints are not included as a possible answer to the inequality. The notation for inequalities on a number\nline and in interval notation use the same symbols to express the endpoints of intervals.\nThe inequality means all numbers less than or equal to 1. To illustrate that solution on a number line, we first put a\nbracket at ; brackets are used when the endpoint is included. We then shade in all the numbers to the left of 1, to\nshow that all numbers less than one are solutions. There is no lower end to those numbers. We write in interval\nnotation as . The symbol is read as \"negative infinity.\"Figure 5.7shows both the number line and interval\nnotation for .\nFigure5.7The inequality is graphed on this number line and written in interval notation.\nFigure 5.8summarizes the general representations in both number line form and interval notation of solutions for\n, , , and . 358 5 \u2022 Algebra\nFigure5.8Summary of representations in number line form and interval notation.\nEXAMPLE5.21\nGraphing an Inequality\nGraph the inequality and write the solution in interval notation.\nSolution\nShade to the right of to show all the numbers greater than , and put a bracket at to show that the numbers are\ngreater than or equal to (Figure 5.9)\nFigure5.9\nWrite in interval notation starting at with a bracket to show that is included in the solution and then infinity\nbecause the solution includes all the numbers greater than or equal to :\nYOUR TURN5.21\n1.

Graph the inequality and and write the solution in interval notation.\nWHO KNEW?\nWhere Did the Inequality Symbols Come From?\nThe first use of the symbol to represent \"less than\" and to represent \"greater than\" appeared in a mathematics\nbook written by Englishman Thomas Harriot that was published in 1631. However, Harriot did not invent the\nsymbols\u2026the editor of the book did! Harriot used triangular symbols to represent less than and greater than; the\neditor, for reasons unknown, changed to symbols that are similar to the ones we use today. The symbols used to\nrepresent less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to ( and ) were first used in 1731 by French hydrologist\nand surveyor Pierre Bouguer. Interestingly, English mathematician John Wallis had used similar symbols as early as\n1670, but he put the bar above the less than and greater than symbols instead of below them.\nSolving Linear Inequalities\nAlinear inequalityis much like a linear equation\u2014but the equal sign is replaced with an inequality sign. A linear\ninequality is an inequality in one variable that can be written in one of the forms or\nwhere , , and are all real numbers.\nWhen we solved linear equations, we were able to use the properties of equality to add, subtract, multiply, or divide both\nsides and still keep the equality. Similar properties hold true for inequalities. We can add or subtract the same quantity\nfrom both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality. For example, we know that 2 is less than 4, i.e., . If we\nadd 6 to both sides of this inequality, we still have a true statement:\nThe same would happen if we subtracted 6 from both sides of the inequality; the statement would stay true:\nNotice that the inequality signs stayed the same. This leads us to the Addition and Subtraction Properties of Inequality.\nFORMULA\nFor any numbers , , and , if , then and .\nFor any numbers , , and , if , then and .\nWe can add or subtract the same quantity from both sides of an inequality and still keep the inequality the same. But\nwhat happens to an inequality when we divide or multiply both sides by a number? Let's first multiply and divide both\nsides by a positive number, starting with an inequality we know is true, . We will multiply and divide this\ninequality by 5: 360 5 \u2022 Algebra\nThe inequality signs stayed the same. Does the inequality stay the same when we divide or multiply by a negative\nnumber? Let's use our inequality to find out, multiplying it and dividing it by :\nNotice that when we filled in the inequality signs, the inequality signs reversed their direction in order to make it true! To\nsummarize, when we divide or multiply an inequality by a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same. When we\ndivide or multiply an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign reverses. This gives us the Multiplication and\nDivision Property of Inequality.\nFORMULA\nFor any numbers , , and ,\nmultiply or divide by a positive: if and , then and\nif and , then and\nmultiply or divide by a negative: if and , then and\nif and , then and\nTo summarize, when we divide or multiply an inequality by:\n\u2022 a positive number, the inequality sign stays the same.\n\u2022 a negative number, the inequality sign reverses.\nBe careful to only reverse the inequality sign when you are multiplying and dividing by a negative. You do NOT\nreverse the inequality sign when you add or subtract a negative. For example, is solved by dividing both\nsides of the inequality by 2 to get . You do NOT reverse the inequality sign because there is a negative 4. As\nanother example, is solved by adding to both sides to get . This does not reverse the\ninequality sign because we were not multiplying or diving by a negative. We then divide both sides by 5 and get\n.\nEXAMPLE5.23\nSolving a Linear Inequality Using One Operation\nSolve , graph the solution on the number line, and write the solution in interval notation.\nSolution\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Linear Inequalities in One Variable with Applications 361\nFigure5.13\nYOUR TURN5.23\n1.

The method we will use to solve applications withlinear\ninequalitiesis very much like the one we used when we solved applications with equations. We will read the problem\nand make sure all the words are understood. Next, we will identify what we are looking for and assign a variable to\nrepresent it. We will restate the problem in one sentence to make it easy to translate into an inequality. Then, we will\nsolve the inequality.\nSometimes an application requires the solution to be a whole number, but the algebraic solution to the inequality is not a\nwhole number. In that case, we must round the algebraic solution to a whole number. The context of the application will\ndetermine whether we round up or down.\nEXAMPLE5.25\nConstructing a Linear Inequality to Solve an Application with Tablet Computers\nA teacher won a mini grant of $4,000 to buy tablet computers for their classroom.

(Source(https://openstax.org /r/media_apps_chart))\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Construct ratios to express comparison of two quantities.\n2. Use and apply proportional relationships to solve problems.\n3. Determine and apply a constant of proportionality.\n4. Use proportions to solve scaling problems.\nRatios and proportions are used in a wide variety of situations to make comparisons. For example, using the information\nfromFigure 5.15, we can see that the number of Facebook users compared to the number of Twitter users is 2,006 M to\n328 M. Note that the \"M\" stands for million, so 2,006 million is actually 2,006,000,000 and 328 million is 328,000,000.\nSimilarly, the number of Qzone users compared to the number of Pinterest users is in a ratio of 632 million to 175\nmillion. These types of comparisons are ratios.\nConstructing Ratios to Express Comparison of Two Quantities\nNote there are three different ways to write aratio, which is a comparison of two numbers that can be written as: to\nOR OR the fraction . Which method you use often depends upon the situation. For the most part, we will want to\nwrite our ratios using the fraction notation. Note that, while all ratios are fractions, not all fractions are ratios. Ratios\nmake part to part, part to whole, and whole to part comparisons. Fractions make part to whole comparisons only.\nEXAMPLE5.28\nExpressing the Relationship between Two Currencies as a Ratio\nThe Euro (\u20ac) is the most common currency used in Europe.

Because weight is the force of gravity acting\nupon a mass, the weights of objects is different on various planetary bodies than they are on Earth. For example, a\nperson who weighs 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 33 pounds on the moon! Write this comparison as a ratio.\nSolution\nUsing the definition of ratio, let pounds on Earth and let pounds on the moon. Then the ratio can be\nwritten as either 200 to 33; or 200:33; or\nYOUR TURN5.29\n1. A person who weighs 170 pounds on Earth would weigh 64 pounds on Mars. Write this comparison as a ratio.\nUsing and Applying Proportional Relationships to Solve Problems\nUsingproportionsto solve problems is a very useful method. It is usually used when you know three parts of the\nproportion, and one part is unknown. Proportions are often solved by setting up like ratios. If and are two ratios\nsuch that then the fractions are said to beproportional. Also, two fractions and are proportional\nif and only if .\nEXAMPLE5.30\nSolving a Proportion Involving Two Currencies\nYou are going to take a trip to France.

Notice that U.S. dollar\namounts are in both numerators and Euro amounts are in both denominators.\nStep 2:Cross multiply, since the ratios and are proportional, then .\nYou should receive Euros .\nYOUR TURN5.30\n1.

This is the\n\"cross multiplication\" rule that students often use (and unfortunately, often use incorrectly). The only time cross\nmultiplication can be used is if you have two ratios (and only two ratios) set up in a proportion. For example, you\ncannot use cross multiplication to solve for in an equation such as because you do not have just the\ntwo ratios. Of course, you could use the rules of algebra to change it to be just two ratios and then you could use\ncross multiplication, but in its present form, cross multiplication cannot be used.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nEudoxus was born around 408 BCE in Cnidus (now known as Knidos) in modern-day Turkey. As a young man, he\ntraveled to Italy to study under Archytas, one of the followers of Pythagoras. He also traveled to Athens to hear\nlectures by Plato and to Egypt to study astronomy. He eventually founded a school and had many students.\nEudoxus made many contributions to the field of mathematics. In mathematics, he is probably best known for his\nwork with the idea of proportions. He created a definition of proportions that allowed for the comparison of any\nnumbers, even irrational ones. His definition concerning the equality of ratios was similar to the idea of cross\nmultiplying that is used today. From his work on proportions, he devised what could be described as a method of\nintegration, roughly 2000 years before calculus (which includes integration) would be fully developed by Isaac Newton\nand Gottfried Leibniz. Through this technique, Eudoxus became the first person to rigorously prove various theorems\ninvolving the volumes of certain objects. He also developed a planetary theory, made a sundial still usable today, and\nwrote a seven volume book on geography calledTour of the Earth, in which he wrote about all the civilizations on the\nEarth, and their political systems, that were known at the time. While this book has been lost to history, over 100\nreferences to it by different ancient writers attest to its usefulness and popularity.\nDetermining and Applying a Constant of Proportionality\nIn the last example, we were given that cups of flour could make 60 cookies; we then calculated that cups of\nflour would make 1,020 cookies, and 720 cookies could be made from 27 cups of flour. Each of those three ratios is\nwritten as a fraction below (with the fractions converted to decimals). What happens if you divide the numerator by the\ndenominator in each?\nThe quotients in each are exactly the same! This number, determined from the ratio of cups of flour to cookies, is called\ntheconstant of proportionality. If the values and are related by the equality then is the constant of\nproportionality between and . Note since then and\nOne piece of information that we can derive from the constant of proportionality is a unit rate. In our example (cups of\nflour divided by cookies), the constant of proportionality is telling us that it takes 0.0375 cups of flour to make one\ncookie. What if we had performed the calculation the other way (cookies divided by cups of flour)?\nIn this case, the constant of proportionality is telling us that cookies can be made with one\ncup of flour. Notice in both cases, the \"one\" unit is associated with the denominator. The constant of proportionality is\nalso useful in calculations if you only know one part of the ratio and wish to find the other.\nEXAMPLE5.33\nFinding a Constant of Proportionality\nIsabelle has a part-time job. She kept track of her pay and the number of hours she worked on four different days, and\nrecorded it in the table below. What is the constant of proportionality, or pay divided by hours?

For\nexample, . The constant of proportionality is 12.5, or $12.50. This tells you Isabelle's hourly pay: For every\nhour she works, she gets paid $12.50.\nYOUR TURN5.33\n1.

One common place you see a scale is on a map (as\nrepresented inFigure 5.16). In this image, 1 inch is equal to 200 miles. This is the scale. This means that 1 inch on the\nmap corresponds to 200 miles on the surface of Earth. Another place where scales are used is with models: model cars,\ntrucks, airplanes, trains, and so on. A common ratio given for model cars is 1:24\u2014that means that 1 inch in length on the\nmodel car is equal to 24 inches (2 feet) on an actual automobile. Although these are two common places that scale is\nused, it is used in a variety of other ways as well.\nEXAMPLE5.37\nSolving a Scaling Problem Involving Maps\nFigure 5.17is an outline map of the state of Colorado and its counties. If the distance of the southern border is 380\nmiles, determine the scale (i.e., 1 inch = how many miles).

Since the length of the border in real life is\n380 miles, our scale is 1 inch miles.\nThe eastern and western borders both measure 3 inches, so their lengths are about 285 miles. The northern border\nmeasures the same as the southern border, so it has a length of 380 miles.\nYOUR TURN5.37\n1.\nOutline Map of Wyoming (credit: \"Blank map of Wyoming showing counties\" by David Benbennick/Wikimedia\nCommons, Public Domain)\nConsider the outline map of the state of Wyoming and its counties.

If a model car is 9\ninches long, how long is a real NASCAR automobile? Write your answer in feet.\nSolution\nThe scale tells us that 1 inch of the model car is equal to 24 inches (2 feet) on the real automobile. So set up the two\nratios into a proportion. Notice that the model lengths are both in the numerator and the NASCAR automobile lengths\nare both in the denominator.\nThis amount (216) is in inches. To convert to feet, divide by 12, because there are 12 inches in a foot (this conversion from\ninches to feet is really another proportion!).

(credit: \"Gas Under 4 Bucks\" by Mark Turnauckas, Flickr/CC\nBY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Graph linear equations and inequalities in two variables.\n2. Solve applications of linear equations and inequalities.\nIn this section, we will learn how to graph linear equations and inequalities. There are several real-world scenarios that\ncan be represented by graphs of linear inequalities. Think of filling your car up with gasoline. If gasoline is $3.99 per\ngallon and you put 10 gallons in your car, you will pay $39.90. Your friend buys 15 gallons of gasoline and pays $59.85.\nYou can plot these points on a coordinate system and connect the points with a line to create the graph of a line. You'll\nlearn to do both in this section.\nPlotting Points on a Rectangular Coordinate System\nJust like maps use a grid system to identify locations, a grid system is used in algebra to show a relationship between\ntwo variables in a rectangular coordinate system. The rectangular coordinate system is also called the -plane or the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.5 \u2022 Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities 377\n\u201ccoordinate plane.\u201d\nThe rectangular coordinate system is formed by two intersecting number lines, one horizontal and one vertical. The\nhorizontal number line is called the -axis. The vertical number line is called the -axis. These axes divide a plane into\nfour regions, called quadrants. The quadrants are identified by Roman numerals, beginning on the upper right and\nproceeding counterclockwise. SeeFigure 5.19.\nFigure5.19Quadrants on the Coordinate Plane\nIn the rectangular coordinate system, every point is represented by anordered pair(Figure 5.20). The first number in\nthe ordered pair is the -coordinate of the point, and the second number is the -coordinate of the point. The phrase\n\"ordered pair\" means that the order is important. At the point where the axes cross and where both coordinates are\nzero, the ordered pair is . The point has a special name. It is called theorigin.\nFigure5.20Ordered Pair\nWe use the coordinates to locate a point on the -plane. Let's plot the point as an example. First, locate 1 on the\n-axis and lightly sketch a vertical line through . Then, locate 3 on the -axis and sketch a horizontal line through\n. Now, find the point where these two lines meet\u2014that is the point with coordinates . SeeFigure 5.21. 378 5 \u2022 Algebra\nFigure5.21Point Plotted on the Coordinate Plane\nNotice that the vertical line through and the horizontal line through are not part of the graph. The dotted\nlines are just used to help us locate the point . When one of the coordinates is zero, the point lies on one of the\naxes. InFigure 5.22, the point is on the -axis and the point (\u22122, 0) is on the -axis.\nFigure5.22Points and Plotted on the Coordinate Plane\nEXAMPLE5.39\nPlotting Points on a Coordinate System\nPlot the following points in the rectangular coordinate system and identify the quadrant in which the point is located:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.5 \u2022 Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities 379\nSolution\nThe first number of the coordinate pair is the -coordinate, and the second number is the -coordinate. To plot each\npoint, sketch a vertical line through the -coordinate and a horizontal line through the -coordinate (Figure 5.23). Their\nintersection is the point.\n1. Since , the point is to the left of the -axis. Also, since , the point is above the -axis. The point is\nin quadrant II.\n2. Since , the point is to the left of the -axis.

In almost every case, when you\nsolved the equation, you got exactly one solution. But equations can have more than one variable. Equations with two\nvariables may be of the form . An equation of this form, where and are both not zero, is called alinear\nequation in two variables. Here is an example of a linear equation in two variables, and . 380 5 \u2022 Algebra\nThe equation is also a linear equation. But it does not appear to be in the form . We can use\nthe addition property of equality and rewrite it in form.\nStep 1:Add to both sides.\nStep 2:Simplify.\nStep 3:Put it in form.\nBy rewriting as , we can easily see that it is a linear equation in two variables because it is of the\nform . When an equation is in the form , we say it is instandard form of a linear equation.\nMost people prefer to have , , and be integers and when writing a linear equation in standard form,\nalthough it is not strictly necessary.\nLinear equations have infinitely many solutions. For every number that is substituted for there is a corresponding\nvalue. This pair of values is asolutionto the linear equation and is represented by the ordered pair ( , ). When we\nsubstitute these values of and into the equation, the result is a true statement, because the value on the left side is\nequal to the value on the right side.\nWe can plot these solutions in the rectangular coordinate system. The points will line up perfectly in a straight line. We\nconnect the points with a straight line to get the graph of the linear equation. We put arrows on the ends of each side of\nthe line to indicate that the line continues in both directions.\nA graph is a visual representation of all the solutions of a linear equation. The line shows youallthe solutions to that\nlinear equation. Every point on the line is a solution of that linear equation. And every solution of the linear equation is\non this line. This line is called the graph of the equation. Pointsnoton the line are not solutions! The graph of a linear\nequation is a straight line.\n\u2022 Every point on the line is a solution of the equation.\n\u2022 Every solution of this equation is a point on this line.\nEXAMPLE5.40\nDetermining Points on a Line\nFigure 5.24is the graph of .\nFigure5.24Graph of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.5 \u2022 Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities 381\nFor each ordered pair, decide:\nI.

Organize them in a table.\nStep 2:Plot the points in a rectangular coordinate system. Check that the points line up. If they do not, carefully check\nyour work.\nStep 3:Draw the line through the three points. Extend the line to fill the grid and put arrows on both ends of the line.\nIt is true that it only takes two points to determine a line, but it is a good habit to use three points. If you only plot two\npoints and one of them is incorrect, you can still draw a line, but it will not represent the solutions to the equation. It will\nbe the wrong line. If you use three points, and one is incorrect, the points will not line up. This tells you something is\nwrong, and you need to check your work.\nEXAMPLE5.41\nGraphing a Line by Plotting Points\nGraph the equation: .\nSolution\nFind three points that are solutions to the equation. Since this equation has the fraction as a coefficient of , we will\nchoose values of carefully. We will use zero as one choice and multiples of 2 for the other choices.

He was sickly as a child, so much so that he was allowed to stay\nin bed until 11:00 AM rather than get up at 5:00 AM like the other school children. He kept this habit of rising late for\nmost of the rest of his life.\nAfter his primary schooling, Descartes attended the University of Poitiers, receiving a law degree in 1616. He then\nembarked on a myriad of journeys, joining two different militaries (one in the Netherlands, the other in Bavaria) and\ngenerally travelling around Europe until 1628, when he settled in the Netherlands. It was here that he began to delve\ndeeply into his ideas of science, mathematics, and philosophy.\nIn 1637, at the urging of his friends, Descartes publishedDiscourse on the Method for Conducting One's Reason Well\nand Seeking the Truth in the Sciences. The book had three appendices:La Dioptrique, a work on optics;Les M\u00e9t\u00e9ores,\nwhich pertained to meteorology; andLa G\u00e9om\u00e9trie, a work on mathematics. It was in this appendix that he proposed\na geometric way of representing many different algebraic expressions and equations. It is this system of\nrepresentation that almost all mathematical textbooks use today.\nThese publications (along with several others) brought much fame to Descartes. So renowned was his reputation that\nlate in 1649, Queen Christina of Sweden asked Descartes to come to Sweden to tutor her. However, she wished to do\nher studies at 5:00 in the morning; Descartes had to break his lifelong habit of sleeping in late. A few months later, in\nFebruary 1650, Descartes died of pneumonia.\nGraphing Linear Inequalities\nPreviously we learned to solve inequalities with only one variable. We will now learn about inequalities containing two\nvariables that can be written in one of the following forms: , , , and\nwhere and are not both zero. We will look atlinear inequalities in two variables,which are very\nsimilar to linear equations in two variables.\nLike linear equations, linear inequalities in two variables have many solutions. Any ordered pair ( , ) that makes an\ninequality true when we substitute in the values is asolution to a linear inequality. 386 5 \u2022 Algebra\nEXAMPLE5.43\nDetermining Solutions to an Inequality\nDetermine whether each ordered pair is a solution to the inequality :\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nSolution\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nYOUR TURN5.43\nDetermine whether each ordered pair is a solution to the inequality\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nLet us think about .

There are several real-world scenarios that can be represented by the\ngraph of a quadratic equation. Think of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. Both ends of the arch are 630 feet apart\nand the arch is 630 feet tall. You can plot these points on a coordinate system and create a parabola to graph the\nquadratic equation.\nIdentify Polynomials, Monomials, Binomials and Trinomials\nYou have learned that a term is a constant, or the product of a constant and one or more variables. When it is of the\nform , where is a constant and is a positive whole number, it is called amonomial. Some examples of\nmonomial are 8, , , and .\nA monomial or two or more monomials combined by addition or subtraction is apolynomial. Some examples include:\n, , and . Some polynomials have special names, based on the number of\nterms. A monomial is a polynomial with exactly one term (examples: 14, , , and ). Abinomialhas exactly\ntwo terms (examples: , , , and ), and a trinomial has exactly three terms (examples:\n, , , and ).\nNotice that every monomial, binomial, and trinomial is also a polynomial. They are just special members of the \u201cfamily\u201d\nof polynomials and so they have special names. We use the words monomial, binomial, and trinomial when referring to\nthese special polynomials and just call all the rest polynomials.\nMultiply Binomials\nRecall multiplying algebraic expressions fromAlgebraic Expressions.

There are, however, many different methods for solving quadratic equations that were developed\nthroughout history. Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, Indian, and Greek mathematicians all solved various types of\nquadratic equations, as did Arab mathematicians of the ninth through the twelfth centuries. It is one of these Arab\nmathematicians' methods that we wish to investigate with this activity.\nMuhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was employed as a scholar at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, located in\npresent day Iraq. One of the many accomplishments of Al-Khwarizmi was his book on the topic of algebra. In that\nbook, he asks, \u201cWhat must be the square which, when increased by ten of its own roots, amounts to 39?\u201d Al-\nKhwarizmi, like many Arab mathematicians of his time, was well versed in Euclid's Elements. Like Euclid, he viewed\nalgebra very geometrically, and thus had a geometric approach to solving a problem like the one above. In his\napproach, he used a method which today we refer to ascompleting the square.\nHis description of the solution method for the above problem is: halve the number of roots, which in the present\ninstance yields 5. This you multiply by itself; the product is 25. Add this to 39; the sum is 64. Now take the root of this\nwhich is 8, and subtract from it half the number of the roots, which is 5; the remainder is 3. This is the root of the\nsquare which you sought for. Thus the square is 9.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.6 \u2022 Quadratic Equations with Two Variables with Applications 421\nSo, what does all of this mean? Al-Khwarizmi would start with a square of unknown length\nof side (we will label the side length ). SeeFigure 5.52So, this square has area\nFigure5.52\nHe would then proceed to halve the number of roots (i.e., there are 10 roots by which the\nsquare is increasing) to get 5; this he would add to the first square. SeeFigure 5.53The\narea of the two new pieces added into the original square are both . At this point, we\nhave .\nFigure5.53\nNow Al-Khwarizmi needed to \u201ccomplete the square\u201d by adding into the drawing a small\nsquare. SeeFigure 5.54This square has an area of 25.\nFigure5.54\n, or .\nNotice that the completed square has side length , so the large square has area . (Notice algebraically\nthat the left half of the equation factors to This means the area of large square\nequals 64. If , then ; so must be equal to 3 or to make this true. Note that Al-Kwarimi\nwould not have considered the possibility of a negative solution, since he approached the solution geometrically, and\nnegative distances do not exist.\nCheck Your Understanding\n48.

Determine if a relation is a function with different representations.\n3. Apply the vertical line test.\n4. Determine the domain and range of a function.\nIn this section, we will learn about relations and functions. As we go about our daily lives, we have many data items or\nquantities that are paired to our names. Our social security number, student ID number, email address, phone number,\nand our birthday are matched to our name. There is a relationship between our name and each of those items. When\nyour teacher gets their class roster, the names of all the students in the class are listed in one column and then the\nstudent ID number is likely to be in the next column. If we think of the correspondence as a set of ordered pairs, where\nthe first element is a student name and the second element is that student\u2019s ID number, we call this a relation.\n(Student name, Student ID #)\nThe set of all the names of the students in the class is called the domain of the relation and the set of all student ID\nnumbers paired with these students is the range of the relation. In general terms, arelationis any set of ordered pairs,\n( ). All the -values in the ordered pairs together make up thedomain. All the -values in the ordered pairs together\nmake up the range.\nThere are many situations similar to the student's name and student ID # where one variable is paired or matched with\nanother. The set of ordered pairs that records this matching is a relation. A special type of relation, called afunction,\noccurs extensively in mathematics. A function is a relation that assigns to each element in its domain exactly one\nelement in the range. For each ordered pair in the relation, each -value is matched with only one -value.\nLet us look at the relation between your friends and their birthdays inFigure 5.56. Every friend has a birthday, but no\none has two birthdays. It is okay for two people to share a birthday. It is okay that Danny and Stephen share July 24 as\ntheir birthday and that June and Liz share August 2. Since each person has exactly one birthday, the relation is a function.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.7 \u2022 Functions 429\nFigure5.56Birthday Mapping\nUse Function Notation\nIt is very convenient to name a function; most often functions are named , , , , , or . In any function, for each\n-value from the domain, we get a corresponding -value in the range. In the function , we write this range value as\n( ). This notation ( ) is called function notation and is read \"f of \" or \"the value of f at .\" In this case the parentheses\ndo not indicate multiplication.\nWe call the independent variable as it can be any value in the domain. We call the dependent variable as its value\ndepends on . Much like when you first encountered the variable , function notation may be rather unsettling. But the\nmore you use the notation, the more familiar you become with the notation, and the more comfortable you will be with\nit.\nLet\u2019s review the equation . To find the value of when , we know to substitute into the equation\nand then simplify.\nLet .\nThe value of the function at is 3. We do the same thing using function notation, the equation can be\nwritten as . To find the value when , we write:\nLet .\nThe value of the function at is 3. This process of finding the value of for a given value of is called\nevaluating the function.\nEXAMPLE5.61\nEvaluating the Function\nFor the function , evaluate the function.\n1.\n2.\n3. 430 5 \u2022 Algebra\nSolution\n1.

The\nfunction represents the relation between the number of emails, , and the time, , measured\nin days. Find (7). Explain what the result means.\nDetermining If a Relation Is a Function with Different Representations\nWe can determine whether a relation is a function by identifying the input and the output values. If each input value\nleads to only one output value, classify the relation as a function. If any input value leads to two or more outputs, do not\nclassify the relation as a function.\nWe will review three different representations of relations and determine if they are functions: ordered pairs, mapping,\nand equations.\nEXAMPLE5.63\nDetermining If a Relation Is a Function with a Set of Ordered Pairs\nUse the set of ordered pairs to determine whether the relation is a function.\n1.\n2.\nSolution\n1.

The arrows show the pairing of the elements of the domain with the\nelements of the range. Consider the example of the relation between your friends and their birthdays used inFigure\n5.57. In this particular example, the domain is the set of people\u2019s names, and the range is the set of their birthdays. This\nmapping was a function because everybody\u2019s name maps to exactly one birthday.\nEXAMPLE5.64\nDetermining If a Relation Is a Function with Mapping\nUse the mapping inFigure 5.57to determine whether the relation is a function.\nFigure5.57 432 5 \u2022 Algebra\nSolution\nBoth Lydia and Marty have two phone numbers.

The relations we looked at were expressed as a set of ordered\npairs, a mapping, or an equation. We will now cover how to tell if a graph is that of a function.\nAn ordered pair is a solution of a linear equation, if the equation is a true statement when the -values and\n-values of the ordered pair are substituted into the equation. The graph of a linear equation is a straight line where\nevery point on the line is a solution of the equation, and every solution of this equation is a point on this line.Figure 5.58\nwe can see that in the graph of the equation , for every -value there is only one -value, as shown in the\naccompanying table. 434 5 \u2022 Algebra\nFigure5.58Graph of the Equation\nA relation is a function if every element of the domain has exactly one value in the range. The relation defined by the\nequation is a function. If we look at the graph, each vertical dashed line only intersects the solid line at one\npoint. This makes sense as in a function, for every -value there is only one -value. If the vertical line hit the graph twice,\nthe -value would be mapped to two -values, and so the graph would not represent a function. This leads us a graphical\nmethod of determining functions called thevertical line test, which states that a set of points in a rectangular\ncoordinate system is the graph of a function if every vertical line intersects the graph in at most one point. If any vertical\nline intersects the graph in more than one point, the graph does not represent a function.\nEXAMPLE5.66\nApplying the Vertical Line Test\nDetermine whether the graph (Figure 5.59) is the graph of a function applying the vertical line test.\nFigure5.59\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.7 \u2022 Functions 435\nSolution\nOn the graph (Figure 5.60), only three vertical dashed lines are drawn.

The person who is credited with the modern definition of function is Swiss mathematician Johann\nBernoulli, who wrote about it in a letter to Leibniz in 1698. Supposedly, Leibniz wrote Bernoulli back, approving of this\nuse of the word. In 1734, the use of the notation for a function was first used by Swiss mathematician Leonhard\nEuler (pronounced \u201cOiler\u201d). Euler had a knack for inventing notation. He also introduced the notation for the base of\nnatural logs (1727), for the square root of (1777), for summation (1755), and many others. Euler also\nintroduced many other ideas associated with functions. Euler defined exponential functions and defined logarithmic\nfunctions as their inverse; he also introduced the beta and gamma functions, and was the first person to consider the\ntrigonometric identities (sine, cosine, etc.) as functions.\nCheck Your Understanding\n57.

Graph functions using intercepts.\n2. Compute slope.\n3. Graph functions using slope and -intercept.\n4. Graph horizontal and vertical lines.\n5. Interpret graphs of functions.\n6. Model applications using slope and -intercept.\nIn this section, we will expand our knowledge of graphing by graphing linear functions. There are many real-world\nscenarios that can be represented by graphs of linear functions. Imagine a chairlift going up at a ski resort. The journey a\nskier takes travelling up the chairlift could be represented as a linear function with a positive slope. The journey a skier\ntakes down the slopes could be represented by a linear function with a negative slope.\nGraphing Functions Using Intercepts\nEvery linear equation can be represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation. We have seen that\nwhen graphing a line by plotting points, you can use any three solutions to graph. This means that two people graphing\nthe line might use different sets of three points. At first glance, their two lines might not appear to be the same, since\nthey would have different points labeled. But if all the work was done correctly, the lines should be exactly the same. One\nway to recognize that they are indeed the same line is to look at where the line crosses the -axis and the -axis. These\npoints are called theinterceptsof a line. Let us review the graphs of the lines inFigure 5.65. 448 5 \u2022 Algebra\nFigure5.65\nThe table below lists where each of these lines crosses the - and -axis. Do you see a pattern? For each line, the\n-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the -axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the -axis has the\nform and is called the -intercept of the line. The -intercept occurs when is zero. In each line, the -coordinate of\nthe point where the line crosses the -axis is zero. The point where the line crosses the -axis has the form and is\ncalled the -intercept of the line. The -intercept occurs when is zero.\nThe line crosses the Ordered Pair for this The line crosses the Ordered Pair for This\nFigure\nat: Point at: Point\nFigure (a) 3 6\nFigure (b) 4\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.8 \u2022 Graphing Functions 449\nThe line crosses the Ordered Pair for this The line crosses the Ordered Pair for This\nFigure\nat: Point at: Point\nFigure (c) 5\nFigure (d) 0 0\nGeneral\nFigure\nEXAMPLE5.70\nFinding - and -Intercepts\nFind the -intercept and -intercept on the (a) and (b) graphs inFigure 5.66.\nFigure5.66\nSolution\nInFigure 5.66, the graph crosses the -axis at the point .

Find the intercepts of and use them to graph the equation.\nComputing Slope\nWhen graphing linear equations, you may notice that some lines tilt up as they go from left to right and some lines tilt\ndown. Some lines are very steep and some lines are flatter. In mathematics, the measure of the steepness of a line is\ncalled theslopeof the line. To find the slope of a line, we locate two points on the line whose coordinates are integers.\nThen we sketch a right triangle where the two points are vertices of the triangle and one side is horizontal and one side\nis vertical. Next, we measure or calculate the distance along the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle. The vertical\ndistance is called theriseand the horizontal distance is called therun.\nWe can assign a numerical value to the slope of a line by finding the ratio of the rise and run. The rise is the amount the\nvertical distance changes while the run measures the horizontal change, as shown in this illustration. Slope (Figure 5.68)\nis a rate of change.\nFigure5.68\nFORMULA\nTo calculate slope , use the formula\n,\nwhere the rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change. 452 5 \u2022 Algebra\nThe concept of slope has many applications in the real world. In construction, the pitch of a roof, the slant of plumbing\npipes, and the steepness of stairs are all applications of slope. As you ski or jog down a hill, you definitely experience\nslope.\nEXAMPLE5.72\nFinding the Slope from a Graph\nFind the slope of the line shown inFigure 5.69.\nFigure5.69\nSolution\nStep 1:Locate two points on the graph whose coordinates are integers, such as and . Starting at , sketch\na right triangle to as shown inFigure 5.70.\nFigure5.70\nStep 2:Count the rise; since it goes down, it is negative. The rise is \u22122.\nStep 3:Count the run. The run is 3.\nStep 4:Use the slope formula substitute the values of the rise and run.\nThe slope of the line is .\nThe solution is decreases by 2 units as increases by 3 units.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.8 \u2022 Graphing Functions 453\nYOUR TURN5.72\n1. Find the slope of the line shown in the graph.\nSometimes we will need to find the slope of a line between two points when we don\u2019t have a graph to measure the rise\nand the run. We could plot the points on grid paper, then count out the rise and the run, but there is a way to find the\nslope without graphing. First, we need to introduce some algebraic notation.\nWe have seen that an ordered pair ( , ) gives the coordinates of a point. But when we work with slopes, we use two\npoints. How can the same symbol ( , ) be used to represent two different points? Mathematicians use subscripts to\ndistinguish such points. For example, ( , ) would be said aloud as \u201c sub 1, sub 1\u201d and ( , ) read \u201c sub 2, sub\n2.\u201d The \u201csub\u201d is a short way of saying \u201csubscript.\u201d We will use ( , ) to identify the first point and ( , ) to identify the\nsecond point in our slope equation. If we had more than two points, (if we were finding more than one slope), we could\nuse ( , ), ( , ), and so on.\nLet\u2019s review how the rise and run relate to the coordinates of the two points by taking another look at the slope of the\nline between the points and , as shown inFigure 5.71.\nFigure5.71\nOn the graph, we count the rise of 3 and the run of 5. Notice on the graph that that ( , ) is the point and ( , )\nis the point . The rise can be found by subtracting the -coordinates, 6 and 3, and the run can be found by\nsubtracting the -coordinates 7 and 2.\nWe have shown that is really another version of . We can use this formula to find the slope of a line. 454 5 \u2022 Algebra\nFORMULA\nTo find the slope of the line between two points ( , ) and ( , ), use the formula\nEXAMPLE5.73\nFinding the Slope of the Line Using Points\nUse the slope formula to find the slope of the line through the points (\u22122, \u22123) and (\u22127, 4).\nSolution\nWe\u2019ll call (\u22122, \u22123) point 1 and (\u22127, 4) point 2.\nStep 1:Use the slope formula:\nStep 2:Substitute the values:\nStep 3:Simplify:\nStep 4:Verify the slope on the graph shown inFigure 5.72.\nFigure5.72\nYOUR TURN5.73\n1.

Oftentimes in math classes, students are\ngiven mathematical functions and can make graphs to represent them. But the interpretation of graphs is a more\napplicable skill to the real world. Being able to \u201cread\u201d a graph\u2014understanding its domain and range, what the intercepts\nmean, and what the slope (or curve) means\u2014 that's a real-world skill. 462 5 \u2022 Algebra\nEXAMPLE5.78\nInterpreting a Graph\nInFigure 5.79the -axis on the graph represents the 120-minute bike ride Juan went on.

Between 30 and 60\nminutes, the slope is 0 and indicates that he\u2019s not riding the bike (the distance is not increasing). Then between 60\nand 90 minutes, the slope is again. Finally, after 90 minutes the slope is meaning Juan is getting 4 miles\ncloser to home every 15 minutes.\n3. Answers will vary. Juan left his house for a bike ride.

We will review a few applications here so you can\nunderstand how equations written in slope-intercept form relate to real-world situations. Usually when a linear equation\nmodel uses real-world data, different letters are used for the variables instead of using only and . The variable names\noften remind us of what quantities are being measured. Also, we often need to extend the axes in our rectangular\ncoordinate system to bigger positive and negative numbers to accommodate the data in the application.\nEXAMPLE5.79\nConverting Temperature\nThe equation is used to convert temperatures from degrees Celsius ( ) to degrees Fahrenheit ( ).\n1.

Graph the equation.\nWe will need to use a larger scale than our usual.

Solve applications of systems of linear equations.\nIn this section, we will learn how to solve systems of linear equations in two variables. There are several real-world\nscenarios that can be represented by systems of linear equalities. Suppose two friends, Andrea and Bart, go shopping at\na farmers market to buy some vegetables. Andrea buys 2 tomatoes and 4 cucumbers and spends $2.00. Bart buys 4\ntomatoes and 5 cucumbers and spends $2.95. What is the price of each vegetable?\nDetermining If an Ordered Pair Is a Solution to a System of Equations\nWhen we solved linear equations inLinear Equations in One Variable with ApplicationsandLinear Inequalities in One\nVariable with Applications, we learned how to solve linear equations with one variable. Now we will work with two or\nmore linear equations grouped together, which is known as asystem of linear equations.\nIn this section, we will focus our work on systems of two linear equations in two unknowns (variables) and applications of\nsystems of linear equations. An example of a system of two linear equations is shown below. We use a brace to show the\ntwo equations are grouped together to form a system of equations.\nA linear equation in two variables, such as , has an infinite number of solutions. Its graph is a line. Remember,\nevery point on the line is a solution to the equation and every solution to the equation is a point on the line. To solve a\nsystem of two linear equations, we want to find the values of the variables that are solutions to both equations. In other\nwords, we are looking for the ordered pairs ( , ) that make both equations true. These are called thesolutions of a\nsystem of equations.\nTo determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two equations, we substitute the values of the variables into\neach equation. If the ordered pair makes both equations true, it is a solution to the system.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.9 \u2022 Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables 475\nEXAMPLE5.81\nDetermining Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution to the System\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system.\n1.\n2.\nSolution\n1.\nWe substitute and into both equations.\ndoes not make both equations true. is not a solution.\n2.

The first method we will use is graphing. The graph of a\nlinear equation is a line. Each point on the line is a solution to the equation. For a system of two equations, we will graph\ntwo lines. Then we can see all the points that are solutions to each equation. And, by finding what points the lines have\nin common, we will find the solution to the system.\nMost linear equations in one variable have one solution; but for some equations calledcontradictions, there are no\nsolutions, and for other equations calledidentities, all numbers are solutions. Similarly, when we solve a system of two\nlinear equations represented by a graph of two lines in the same plane, there are three possible cases, as shown in\nFigure 5.83.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.9 \u2022 Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables 477\nFigure5.83\nEach time we demonstrate a new method, we will use it on the same system of linear equations.

Solve this system of linear equations by graphing.\nSolving Systems of Linear Equations Using Substitution\nWe will now solve systems of linear equations by the substitution method. We will use the same system we used for\ngraphing.\nWe will first solve one of the equations for either or . We can choose either equation and solve for either\nvariable\u2014but we\u2019ll try to make a choice that will keep the work easy. Then, we substitute that expression into the other\nequation. The result is an equation with just one variable\u2014and we know how to solve those!\nAfter we find the value of one variable, we will substitute that value into one of the original equations and solve for the\nother variable. Finally, we check our solution and make sure it makes both equations true. This process is summarized\nhere:\nStep 1:Solve one of the equations for either variable.\nStep 2:Substitute the expression from Step 1 into the other equation.\nStep 3:Solve the resulting equation.\nStep 4:Substitute the solution in Step 3 into either of the original equations to find the other variable.\nStep 5:Write the solution as an ordered pair.\nStep 6:Check that the ordered pair is a solution to both original equations. 480 5 \u2022 Algebra\nEXAMPLE5.84\nSolving a System of Linear Equations Using Substitution\nSolve this system of linear equations by substitution:\nSolution\nStep 1:Solve one of the equations for We\u2019ll solve the first equation\neither variable. for .\nStep 2:Substitute the expression from We replace in the second\nStep 1 into the other equation. equation with the expression\n.\nStep 3:Solve the resulting equation.

Solve this system of linear equations by substitution:\nSolving Systems of Linear Equations Using Elimination\nWe have solved systems of linear equations by graphing and by substitution. Graphing works well when the variable\ncoefficients are small, and the solution has integer values. Substitution works well when we can easily solve one\nequation for one of the variables and not have too many fractions in the resulting expression.\nThe third method of solving systems of linear equations is called the elimination method. When we solved a system by\nsubstitution, we started with two equations and two variables and reduced it to one equation with one variable. This is\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.9 \u2022 Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables 481\nwhat we\u2019ll do with the elimination method, too, but we\u2019ll have a different way to get there.\nThe elimination method is based on the Addition Property of Equality. The Addition Property of Equality says that when\nyou add the same quantity to both sides of an equation, you still have equality. We will extend the Addition Property of\nEquality to say that when you add equal quantities to both sides of an equation, the results are equal. For any\nexpressions , , , and :\nif\nand\nthen .\nTo solve a system of equations by elimination, we start with both equations in standard form. Then we decide which\nvariable will be easiest to eliminate. How do we decide? We want to have the coefficients of one variable be opposites, so\nthat we can add the equations together and eliminate that variable. Notice how that works when we add these two\nequations together:\nThe \u2019s add to zero and we have one equation with one variable. Let us try another one:\nThis time we do not see a variable that can be immediately eliminated if we add the equations. But if we multiply the first\nequation by , we will make the coefficients of opposites. We must multiply every term on both sides of the equation\nby .\nThen rewrite the system of equations.\nNow we see that the coefficients of the terms are opposites, so will be eliminated when we add these two equations.\nOnce we get an equation with just one variable, we solve it. Then we substitute that value into one of the original\nequations to solve for the remaining variable. And, as always, we check our answer to make sure it is a solution to both\nof the original equations. Here\u2019s a summary of using the elimination method:\nStep 1:Write both equations in standard form. If any coefficients are fractions, clear them.\nStep 2:Make the coefficients of one variable opposites.\nDecide which variable you will eliminate.\nMultiply one or both equations so that the coefficients of that variable are opposites.\nStep 3:Add the equations resulting from Step 2 to eliminate one variable.\nStep 4:Solve for the remaining variable.\nStep 5:Substitute the solution from Step 4 into one of the original equations.

Demonstrate whether an ordered pair is a solution to a system of linear inequalities.\n2. Solve systems of linear inequalities using graphical methods.\n3. Graph systems of linear inequalities.\n4. Interpret and solve applications of linear inequalities.\nIn this section, we will learn how to solve systems of linear inequalities in two variables. InSystems of Linear Equations in\nTwo Variables, we learned how to solve for systems of linear equations in two variables and found a solution that would\nwork in both equations. We can solve systems of inequalities by graphing each inequality (as discussed inGraphing\nLinear Equations and Inequalities) and putting these on the same coordinate system. The double-shaded part will be our\nsolution to the system. There are many real-life examples for solving systems of linear inequalities.\nConsider Ming who has two jobs to help her pay for college. She works at a local coffee shop for $7.50 per hour and at a\nresearch lab on campus for $12 per hour. Due to her busy class schedule, she cannot work more than 15 hours per week.\nIf she needs to make at least $150 per week, can she work seven hours at the coffee shop and eight hours in the lab?\nDetermining If an Ordered Pair Is a Solution of a System of Linear Inequalities\nThe definition of asystem of linear inequalitiesis similar to the definition of a system of linear equations. A system of\nlinear inequalities looks like a system of linear equations, but it has inequalities instead of equations. A system of two\nlinear inequalities is shown here.\nTo solve a system of linear inequalities, we will find values of the variables that are solutions to both inequalities. We\nsolve the system by using the graphs of each inequality and show the solution as a graph. We will find the region on the\nplane that contains all ordered pairs that make both inequalities true. The solution of a system of linear\ninequalities is shown as a shaded region in the -coordinate system that includes all the points whose ordered pairs\nmake the inequalities true.\nTo determine if an ordered pair is a solution to a system of two inequalities, substitute the values of the variables into\neach inequality. If the ordered pair makes both inequalities true, it is a solution to the system. 492 5 \u2022 Algebra\nEXAMPLE5.89\nDetermining Whether an Ordered Pair Is a Solution to a System\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:\n1.\n2.\nSolution\n1. Is the ordered pair a solution?\nWe substitute and into both inequalities.\nThe ordered pair made both inequalities true. Therefore is a solution to this system.\n2. Is the ordered pair a solution?\nWe substitute and into both inequalities.\nThe ordered pair made one inequality true, but the other one false. Therefore is not a solution to this\nsystem.\nYOUR TURN5.89\nDetermine whether the ordered pair is a solution to the system:\n1.\n2.\nSolving Systems of Linear Inequalities Using Graphical Methods\nThe solution to a single linear inequality was the region on one side of the boundary line that contains all the points that\nmake the inequality true. The solution to a system of two linear inequalities is a region that contains the solutions to\nboth inequalities. We will review graphs of linear inequalities and solve the linear inequality from its graph.\nEXAMPLE5.90\nSolving a System of Linear Inequalities by Graphing\nUseFigure 5.88to solve the system of linear inequalities:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.10 \u2022 Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables 493\nFigure5.88\nSolution\nTo solve the system of linear inequalities we look at the graph and find the region that satisfies BOTH inequalities.

Compose an objective function to be minimized or maximized.\n2. Compose inequalities representing a system application.\n3. Apply linear programming to solve application problems.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.11 \u2022 Linear Programming 519\nImagine you hear about some natural disaster striking a far-away country; it could be an earthquake, a fire, a tsunami, a\ntornado, a hurricane, or any other type of natural disaster. The survivors of this disaster need help\u2014they especially need\nfood, water, and medical supplies. You work for a company that has these supplies, and your company has decided to\nhelp by flying the needed supplies into the disaster area. They want to maximize the number of people they can help.\nHowever, there are practical constraints that need to be taken into consideration; the size of the airplanes, how much\nweight each airplane can carry, and so on. How do you solve this dilemma? This is where linear programming comes into\nplay.Linear programmingis a mathematical technique to solve problems involving finding maximums or minimums\nwhere a linear function is limited by various constraints.\nAs a field, linear programming began in the late 1930s and early 1940s. It was used by many countries during World War\nII; countries used linear programming to solve problems such as maximizing troop effectiveness, minimizing their own\ncasualties, and maximizing the damage they could inflict upon the enemy. Later, businesses began to realize they could\nuse the concept of linear programming to maximize output, minimize expenses, and so on. In short, linear programming\nis a method to solve problems that involve finding a maximum or minimum where a linear function is constrained by\nvarious factors.\nWHO KNEW?\nA Mathematician Invents a \u201cTsunami Cannon\u201d\nOn December 26, 2004, a massive earthquake occurred in the Indian Ocean. This earthquake, which scientists\nestimate had a magnitude of 9.0 or 9.1 on the Richter Scale, set off a wave of tsunamis across the Indian Ocean. The\nwaves of the tsunami averaged over 30 feet (10 meters) high, and caused massive damage and loss of life across the\ncoastal regions bordering the Indian Ocean.\nUsama Kadri works as an applied mathematician at Cardiff University in Wales. His areas of research include fluid\ndynamics and non-linear phenomena. Lately, he has been focusing his research on the early detection and easing of\nthe effects of tsunamis. One of his theories involves deploying a series of devices along coastlines which would fire\nacoustic-gravity waves (AGWs) into an oncoming tsunami, which in theory would lessen the force of the tsunami. Of\ncourse, this is all in theory, but Kadri believes it will work. There are issues with creating such a device: they would\ntake a tremendous amount of electricity to generate an AGW, for instance, but if it would save lives, it may well be\nworth it.\nCompose an Objective Function to Be Minimized or Maximized\nAnobjective functionis a linear function in two or more variables that describes the quantity that needs to be\nmaximized or minimized.\nEXAMPLE5.96\nComposing an Objective Function for Selling Two Products\nMiriam starts her own business, where she knits and sells scarves and sweaters out of high-quality wool. She can make a\nprofit of $8 per scarf and $10 per sweater. Write an objective function that describes her profit.\nSolution\nLet represent the number of scarves sold, and let represent the number of sweaters sold. Let represent profit.\nSince each scarf has a profit of $8 and each sweater has a profit of $10, the objective function is .\nYOUR TURN5.96\n1. For a fundraiser at school, the Robotics Club is selling bags of apples and bunches of bananas during lunch. They\nwill make a profit of $4 per bag of apples and $6 per bunch of bananas. Write an objective function that\ndescribes the profit the Robotics Club will make. 520 5 \u2022 Algebra\nEXAMPLE5.97\nComposing an Objective Function for Production\nWilliam\u2019s factory produces two products, widgets and wadgets. It takes 24 minutes for his factory to make 1 widget, and\n32 minutes for his factory to make 1 wadget. Write an objective function that describes the time it takes to make the\nproducts.\nSolution\nLet equal the number of widgets made; let equal the number of wadgets made; let represent total time. The\nobjective function is .\nYOUR TURN5.97\n1. Suppose William has a second factory that can make widgets in 20 minutes and wadgets in 28 minutes. Write an\nobjective function that describes the time it takes to make the products.\nComposing Inequalities Representing a System Application\nFor our two examples of profit and production, in an ideal world the profit a person makes and/or the number of\nproducts a company produces would have no restrictions. After all, who wouldn\u2019t want to have an unrestricted profit?\nHowever in reality this is not the case; there are usually several variables that can restrict how much profit a person can\nmake or how many products a company can produce. These restrictions are calledconstraints.\nMany different variables can be constraints. When making or selling a product, the time available, the cost of\nmanufacturing and the amount of raw materials are all constraints. In the opening scenario with the tsunami, the\nmaximum weight on an airplane and the volume of cargo it can carry would be constraints. Constraints are expressed as\nlinear inequalities; the list of constraints defined by the problem forms a system of linear inequalities that, along with the\nobjective function, represent a system application.\nEXAMPLE5.98\nRepresenting the Constraints for Selling Two Products\nTwo friends start their own business, where they knit and sell scarves and sweaters out of high-quality wool. They can\nmake a profit of $8 per scarf and $10 per sweater. To make a scarf, 3 bags of knitting wool are needed; to make a\nsweater, 4 bags of knitting wool are needed. The friends can only make 8 items per day, and can use not more than 27\nbags of knitting wool per day. Write the inequalities that represent the constraints. Then summarize what has been\ndescribed thus far by writing the objective function for profit and the two constraints.\nSolution\nLet represent the number of scarves sold, and let represent the number of sweaters sold. There are two constraints:\nthe number of items the business can make in a day (a maximum of 8) and the number of bags of knitting wool they can\nuse per day (a maximum of 27). The first constraint (total number of items in a day) is written as:\nSince each scarf takes 3 bags of knitting wool and each sweater takes 4 bags of knitting wool, the second constraint,\ntotal bags of knitting wool per day, is written as:\nIn summary, here are the equations that represent the new business:\n; This is the profit equation: The business makes $8 per scarf and $10 per sweater.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.11 \u2022 Linear Programming 521\nYOUR TURN5.98\n1.

Another regulation:\nthe container where the Robotics Club keeps the fruit has a maximum weight capacity of 70 pounds.

Research indicates that long-term demand for products from the factory will\nresult in average sales of 12 widgets per day and 10 wadgets per day. Because of limitations on storage at the factory, no\nmore than 20 widgets or 17 wadgets can be made each day. Write the inequalities that represent the constraints. Then\nsummarize what has been described thus far by writing the objective function for time and the two constraints.\nSolution\nLet equal the number of widgets made; let equal the number of wadgets made. Based on the long-term demand, we\nknow the factory must produce a minimum of 12 widgets and 10 wadgets per day. We also know because of storage\nlimitations, the factory cannot produce more than 20 widgets per day or 17 wadgets per day. Writing those as\ninequalities, we have:\nThe number of widgets made per day must be between 12 and 20, and the number of wadgets made per day must be\nbetween 10 and 17. Therefore, we have:\nThe system is:\nis the variable for time; it takes 24 minutes to make a widget and 32 minutes to make a wadget.\nYOUR TURN5.99\n1. Suppose a second factory can make widgets in 20 minutes and wadgets in 28 minutes. Research for this factory\nindicates that long-term demand for products from this second factory will result in average sales of 15 widgets\nper day and 13 wadgets per day. Because of limitations on storage at his factory, no more than 22 widgets or 19\nwadgets can be made each day. Write the inequalities that represent the constraints. Then summarize what has\nbeen described thus far by writing the objective function for time and the two constraints.\nApplying Linear Programming to Solve Application Problems\nThere are four steps that need to be completed when solving a problem using linear programming. They are as follows: 522 5 \u2022 Algebra\nStep 1:Compose an objective function to be minimized or maximized.\nStep 2:Compose inequalities representing the constraints of the system.\nStep 3:Graph the system of inequalities representing the constraints.\nStep 4:Find the value of the objective function at each corner point of the graphed region.\nThe first two steps you have already learned. Let\u2019s continue to use the same examples to illustrate Steps 3 and 4.\nEXAMPLE5.100\nSolving a Linear Programming Problem for Two Products\nThree friends start their own business, where they knit and sell scarves and sweaters out of high-quality wool. They can\nmake a profit of $8 per scarf and $10 per sweater. To make a scarf, 3 bags of knitting wool are needed; to make a\nsweater, 4 bags of knitting wool are needed. The friends can only make 8 items per day, and can use not more than 27\nbags of knitting wool per day. Determine the number of scarves and sweaters they should make each day to maximize\ntheir profit.\nSolution\nStep 1:Compose an objective function to be minimized or maximized. FromExample 5.98, the objective function is\n.\nStep 2:Compose inequalities representing the constraints of the system. FromExample 5.98, the constraints are\nand .\nStep 3:Graph the system of inequalities representing the constraints. Using methods discussed inGraphing Linear\nEquations and Inequalities, the graphs of the constraints are shown below. Because the number of scarves ( ) and the\nnumber of sweaters ( ) both must be non-negative numbers (i.e., and ), we need to graph the system of\ninequalities in Quadrant I only.Figure 5.99shows each constraint graphed on its own axes, whileFigure 5.100shows the\ngraph of the system of inequalities (the two constraints graphed together). InFigure 5.100, the large shaded region\nrepresents the area where the two constraints intersect. If you are unsure how to graph these regions, refer back to\nGraphing Linear Equations and Inequalities.\nFigure5.99Graphs of each constraint\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.11 \u2022 Linear Programming 523\nFigure5.100Graph of the System of Inequalities\nStep 4:Find the value of the objective function at each corner point of the graphed region. The \u201cgraphed region\u201d is the\narea where both of the regions intersect; inFigure 5.101, it is the large shaded area. The \u201ccorner points\u201d refer to each\nvertex of the shaded area. Why the corner points? Because the maximum and minimum of every objective function will\noccur at one (or more) of the corner points.Figure 5.101shows the location and coordinates of each corner point.\nFigure5.101Graph of Region with Corner Points\nThree of the four points are readily found, as we used them to graph the regions; the fourth point, the intersection point\nof the two constraint lines, will have to be found using methods discussed inSystems of Linear Equations in Two\nVariables, either using substitution or elimination. As a reminder, set up the two equations of the constraint lines:\nFor this example, substitution will be used.\nSubstituting into the first equation for , we have 524 5 \u2022 Algebra\nNow, substituting the 5 in for in either equation to solve for . Choosing the second equation, we have:\nTherefore, , and .\nTo find the value of the objective function, , put the coordinates for each corner point into the equation\nand solve. The largest solution found when doing this will be the maximum value, and thus will be the answer to the\nquestion originally posed: determining the number of scarves and sweaters the new business should make each day to\nmaximize their profit.\nCorner ( , ) Objective Function\nThe maximum value for the profit occurs when and . This means that to maximize their profit, the new\nbusiness should make 5 scarves and 3 sweaters every day.\nYOUR TURN5.100\n1. For a fundraiser at school, the Robotics Club is selling bags of apples and bunches of bananas during lunch. They\nwill make a profit of $4 per bag of apples and $6 per bunch of bananas. Due to school health regulations, the\nclub is allowed to have only 20 bags and bunches of fruit on school grounds each day to sell. Another regulation:\nthe container where the Robotics Club keeps the fruit has a maximum weight capacity of 70 pounds. Each bag of\napples weighs 3 pounds, while each bunch of bananas weighs 5 pounds. Determine the number of bags of\napples and the number of bags of bananas the Robotics Club should sell each day to maximize their profit.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nLeonid Kantorovich\nLeonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich was born January 19, 1912, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Two major events affected young\nLeonid\u2019s life: when he was five, the Russian Revolution began, making life in St. Petersburg very difficult; so much so\nthat Leonid\u2019s family fled to Belarus for a year. When Leonid was 10, his father died, leaving his mother to raise five\nchildren on her own.\nDespite the hardships, Leonid showed incredible mathematical ability at a young age. When he was only 14, he\nenrolled in Leningrad State University to study mathematics. Four years later, at age 18, he graduated with what\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.11 \u2022 Linear Programming 525\nwould be equivalent to a Ph.D. in mathematics.\nAlthough his primary interests were in pure mathematics, in 1938 he began working on problems in economics.\nSupposedly, he was approached by a local plywood manufacturer with the following question: how to come up with a\nwork schedule for eight lathes to maximize output, given the five different kinds of plywood they had at the factory.\nBy July 1939, Leonid had come up with a solution, not only to the lathe scheduling problem but to other areas as well,\nsuch as an optimal crop rotation schedule for farmers, minimizing waste material in manufacturing, and finding\noptimal routes for transporting goods. The technique he discovered to solve these problems eventually became\nknown as linear programming. He continued to use this technique for solving many other problems involving\noptimization, which resulted in the bookThe Best Use of Economic Resources, which was published in 1959. His\ncontinued work in linear programming would ultimately result in him winning the Nobel Prize of Economics in 1975.\nCheck Your Understanding\n80. Kellie makes tables and chairs.

From algebraic expressions we can create algebraic\nequations.\n\u2022 Algebraic expressions are often simplified and evaluated using the four arithmetic operations.\n5.2Linear Equations in One Variable with Applications\n\u2022 Solving linear equations means discovering what the value of the variable in a linear equation represents in the\ngiven conditions.\n\u2022 When solving a linear equation, most often you will have one solution; however, a linear equation may have no\nsolutions or infinitely many solutions.\n5.3Linear Inequalities in One Variable with Applications\n\u2022 Inequalities can be used when the possible values (answers) in a certain situation are numerous, or when the exact\nvalue (answer) is not known, but it is known to be within a range of possible values.\n\u2022 Linear inequalities can be represented using a number line or using interval notation.\n5.4Ratios and Proportions\n\u2022 A ratio is a comparison of two numbers. The ratio of two numbers and can be written as: to OR : OR the\nfraction / .\n\u2022 All fractions are ratios, but not all ratios are fractions. Ratios make part to part, part to whole, and whole to part\ncomparisons. Fractions make part to whole comparisons only.\n\u2022 When two ratios are equal, we say they are in proportion or are proportional.\n\u2022 Setting up proportions allows us to solve many various situations where three of the four values of the proportion\nare known.\n5.5Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities\n\u2022 Linear equations can be represented graphically on a rectangular coordinate system.\n\u2022 Solving linear equations in two variables means finding the point where two lines intersect. There are three\npossibilities: The lines intersect at exactly one point; the lines do not intersect (they are parallel); or the lines\nintersect everywhere (they are the same line). 532 5 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n\u2022 Solving linear inequalities in two variables means finding a region of possible answers. Every point in this region will\nmake both inequalities true statements.\n\u2022 Plotting points is a standard way to help graph linear equations and linear inequalities.\n5.6Quadratic Equations with Two Variables with Applications\n\u2022 A quadratic equation is an algebraic equation where the highest power (degree) of the equation is two.\n\u2022 To solve a quadratic equation is to find the value(s) that when substituted in for the variables, will make the\nequation equal to zero.\n\u2022 There can be two, one, or no solutions to any quadratic equation.\n\u2022 There are several methods to solve a quadratic equation. These methods include factoring quadratic equations,\ngraphic quadratic equations, using the square root method, and using the quadratic formula.\n5.7Functions\n\u2022 A relation is any set of ordered pairs . All of the -values of the set are the domain, and all of the -values of the\nset are the range.\n\u2022 A relation is a function if each -value in the domain is assigned to exactly one element in the range. A -value in the\nrange can have more than one -value assigned to it; but each -value can only be assigned to one -value.\n\u2022 For the function is the name of the function, is the domain value variable, and is the range\nvalue variable.\n\u2022 The vertical line test is a test that can be done on the graph of a relation to determine if it is a function.\n5.8Graphing Functions\n\u2022 Every linear function can be graphically represented by a unique line that shows all the solutions of the equation.\n\u2022 The points where the graph of a line intersects the -axis and -axis are called the intercepts of the line.\n\u2022 Most lines will have one -intercept and one -intercept. Only if the line is straight vertical (no -intercept) or\nstraight horizontal (no -intercept) will it not have both intercepts. Note that a line that is straight vertical is not a\nfunction, but a line that is straight horizontal is a function.\n\u2022 Since any two points determine a straight line, any linear function can be graphed if both intercepts are known.\n\u2022 The slope of a linear function is the ratio of the vertical change divided by the horizontal change. It is often referred\nto as .\n\u2022 A formula for finding the slope of linear functions is for any two points of the linear function and\n.\n5.9Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables\n\u2022 To solve a system of linear equations means finding the point or points where the two linear equations intersect.\n\u2022 Two lines can intersect at one point, no points if they are parallel, or every point if they are the same equation.\n\u2022 Systems of linear equations can be solved by graphing, by using substitution, or by using the elimination method.\n5.10Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables\n\u2022 To solve a system of linear inequalities means to find the area(s) where the points in that area make all the linear\ninequalities true.\n\u2022 Systems of linear inequalities can be solved by graphing the linear equations associated with the inequalities, then\n'testing' points to see whether the values of the point make the equation true or not.\n5.11Linear Programming\n\u2022 Linear programming is a mathematical technique to solve problems involving finding maximums or minimums\nwhere a linear function is limited by various constraints.\n\u2022 An objective function is a linear function in two or more variables that describes the quantity that needs to be\nmaximized or minimized.\n\u2022 In linear programming, a constraint is a restriction that affects the maximum or minimum values of an objective\nfunction.\n\u2022 Through the creation of objective functions and restraints, a linear system can be developed and solved through\nlinear programming.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5 \u2022 Chapter Summary 533\nVideos\n5.1Algebraic Expressions\n\u2022 Q&A: Why We Teach Algebra(https://openstax.org/r/Teach_Algebra)\n5.2Linear Equations in One Variable with Applications\n\u2022 Solving for a Variable in an Equation(https://openstax.org/r/Solving_for_a_variable)\n5.5Graphing Linear Equations and Inequalities\n\u2022 Graphing Linear Inequalities in Two Variables(https://openstax.org/r/Graphing_linear)\n5.6Quadratic Equations with Two Variables with Applications\n\u2022 Factoring with the Box Method (Area Model)(https://openstax.org/r/Factoring_with_the_Box)\n\u2022 Solving Quadratics with the Zero Property(https://openstax.org/r/Zero_Property)\n\u2022 Solving Quadratics with the Quadratic Formula(https://openstax.org/r/Solving_Quadratics)\n5.7Functions\n\u2022 Relations and Functions(https://openstax.org/r/Relationsp_and_Functions)\n\u2022 Domain and Range on Graphs(https://openstax.org/r/Domain)\n5.9Systems of Linear Equations in Two Variables\n\u2022 Practice with Solving Applications of Systems of Equations(https://openstax.org/r/Practice_with_Solving)\n\u2022 Applications of Systems of Linear Equations(https://openstax.org/r/Applications_of_Systems)\n5.10Systems of Linear Inequalities in Two Variables\n\u2022 Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities by Graphing(https://openstax.org/r/Solving_Systems)\n\u2022 Systems of Linear Inequalities(https://openstax.org/r/Systems_of_Linear)\nFormula Review\n5.1Algebraic Expressions\n\u2022 Distributive Property:\n5.3Linear Inequalities in One Variable with Applications\n\u2022 For any numbers , , and if , then and .\n\u2022 For any numbers , , and , if , then and .\n\u2022 For any numbers , , and ,\nmultiply or divide by a positive:\nif and , then and\nif and , then and\nmultiply or divide by a negative:\nif and , then and\nif and , then and\n5.8Graphing Functions\n\u2022 To calculate slope , use the formula\n,\nwhere the rise measures the vertical change and the run measures the horizontal change.\n\u2022 To find the slope of the line between two points and , use the formula\nProjects\nRatio and Proportion\u2014Comparing Prices, Part 1\nGo to your favorite coffee shops and find out what a same sized drink costs at each.

Ultimately, personal money management\ninvolves managing both our debt and also our savings and investments.\nIn 2021, the average American had consumer debt balance of $96,371. Nearly $100,000 per person. And less than 25% of\nAmericans are debt free. Consumer debt can include mortgages, credit cards, as well as student loans. A key question all\nconsumers should consider is how to manage debt and not become overburdened by it. The first step is to create a\nbudget, which puts earnings into perspective, indicating what we can, and cannot, afford. A budget also entails setting\naside certain funds for savings and investment, which help us achieve our short- and long-term goals.\nCreating a budget requires an understanding of how money\u2014debt and savings\u2014works. Initially, percentages and\ninterest need to be understood. They drive most of what happens with debt and savings. With that understanding,\ndiscussions of buying a house, a car, or incurring credit card debt can be addressed from a financial perspective. All the\nwhile, retirement is waiting. Preparing for retirement involves saving and saving earlier rather than later. The power of\ncompound interest is on full display when saving early.\nThis chapter covers some of the basics of money management: percentages, interest, budgeting, debt (student loans,\nmortgage, car, credit cards), savings, investments, and taxes. 544 6 \u2022 Money Management\n6.1 Understanding Percent\nFigure6.2The federal budget describes how money is spent and how money is earned. (credit: \"Breakdown of revenues\nand outlays in 2021 US Federal budget\" Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Define and calculate percent.\n2. Convert between percent, decimal, and fractional values.\n3. Calculate the total, percent, or part.\n4. Solve application problems involving percents.\nIn 2020, the U.S. federal governmentbudgeted $3.5 billion for the National Park Service(https://openstax.org/r/\nNational_Park_Service), which appears to be a very large number (and is!) and a large portion of the total federal budget.\nHowever, thetotal outlays from the U.S. federal government in 2020 was $6.6 trillion(https://openstax.org/r/\nU.S._federal_government). So, the amount budgeted for the National Park Service was less than one-tenth of 1 percent,\nor 1/10%, of the total outlays. Thispercentdescribes a specific number. Understanding that ratio puts the $3.5 billion\nbudgeted to the National Park Service in perspective.\nThis chapter focuses on percent as a primary tool for understanding money management. The interest paid on debt, the\ninterest earned through investments, and even taxes are entirely determined using percent. This section introduces the\nbasics of working with this invaluable tool.\nDefine and Calculate Percent\nThe wordpercentcomes from the Latin phrase per centum, which means \u201cby the hundred.\u201d So any percent is a number\ndivided by 100. Changing a percent to a fraction is to write the percent in itsfractional form. To write % in its fractional\nform is to write the percent as the fraction .\nA percent need not be an integer and does not have to be less than 100.\nEXAMPLE6.1\nRewriting a Percent as a Fraction\nRewrite the following as fractions:\n1. 18%\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Understanding Percent 545\n2. 84%\n3. 38.7%\n4. 213%\nSolution\n1.

We can change a percent into decimal form by dividing the percent by 100 and representing\nthe result as a decimal.\nFORMULA\nThe decimal form of % is found by calculating the decimal value of .\nEXAMPLE6.2\nConverting a Percent to Decimal Form\nConvert the following percents to decimal form:\n1. 17%\n2. 7%\n3. 18.45%\nSolution\n1. To convert 17% to its decimal form, divide 17 by 100. This moves the decimal two places to the left, resulting in 0.17.\nThe decimal form of 17% is 0.17.\n2. To convert 7% to its decimal form, divide 7 by 100. This moves the decimal two places to the left, resulting in 0.07.\nThe decimal form of 7% is 0.07.\n3. To convert 18.45% to its decimal form, divide 18.45 by 100. This moves the decimal two places to the left, resulting in\n0.1845. The decimal form of 18.45% is 0.1845.\nYOUR TURN6.2\nConvert the following percents to decimal form:\n1. 9%\n2. 24%\n3. 2.18% 546 6 \u2022 Money Management\nYou should notice that, to convert from percent to decimal form, you can simply move the decimal two places to the left\nwithout performing the division.\nFORMULA\nTo convert the number from decimal form to percent, multiply by 100 and place a percent sign, %, after the\nnumber, .\nEXAMPLE6.3\nConverting the Decimal Form of a Percent to Percent\nConvert each of the following to percent:\n1. 0.34\n2. 4.15\n3. 0.0391\nSolution\n1. Using the formula and = 0.34, we calculate , which gives us 34%.\n2. Using the formula and = 4.15, we calculate , which gives us 415%.\n3. Using the formula and = 0.0391, we calculate , which gives us 3.91%.\nYOUR TURN6.3\nConvert the following to percent:\n1. 0.41\n2. 0.02\n3. 9.2481\nYou should notice that, to convert from decimal form to percent form, you can simply move the decimal two places to\nthe right without performing the multiplication.\nCalculate the Total, Percent, or Part\nThe word \u201cof\u201d is used to indicate multiplication using fractions, as in \u201cone-fourth of 56.\u201d To find \u201cone-fourth of 56\u201d we\nwould multiply 56 by one-fourth. We can think of percents as fractions with a specific denominator\u2014100. So, to calculate\n\u201c25% of 52,\u201d we multiply 52 by 25%. But, first we need to convert the percent to either fractional form (25/100) or decimal\nform. Using the decimal form of 25% we have 0.25 \u00d7 52, which equals 13.\nIn this problem, 52 is thetotalorbase, 25 is thepercentage, and 13 isthe percentage of52, or thepartof 52. This is\nsometimes referred to as theamount.\nFORMULA\nThe mathematical formula relating the total (base), the percent in decimal form, and the part (amount) is\n, or, .\nIn all calculations, the percent is expressed in decimal form.\nKnowing any two of the values in our formula allows us to calculate the third value.

Determine 70% of 3,500\n2. Determine 156% of 720\nSolution\n1. The total is = 3,500, and the percent is = 70. The decimal form of 70% is 0.70. To find the part, or percent of the\ntotal, substitute those values into the formula and calculate.\nFrom this, we say that 70% of 3,500 is 2,450.\n2. The total is = 720, and the percent is = 156. The decimal form of 156% is 1.56. To find the part, or percent of the\ntotal, substitute those values into the formula and calculate.\nFrom this, we say that 156% of 720 is 1,123.2.\nYOUR TURN6.4\n1.

What is the total if 35% of the total is 70?\n2. What is the total if 10% of the total is 4,000?\nSolution\n1. Step 1:The percent is 35, which in decimal form is 0.35. We were given that 35% of the total is 70, so the part is 70.\nWe are to find the total. Substituting into the formula, we have\nStep 2:To find the total, we solve the equation for the total.\nFrom this we see that 200 is the total, or, that 35% of 200 is 70. 548 6 \u2022 Money Management\n2. Step 1:The percent is 10, which in decimal form is 0.1. We were given that 10% of the total is 4,000, so the part is\n4,000. Substituting into the formula, we have\nStep 2:To find the total, we solve the equation for the total.\nFrom this we see that 40,000 is the total, or that 10% of 40,000 is 4,000.\nYOUR TURN6.5\n1.

This will result in the\ndecimal form of the percent, so it must be converted to percent form.\nEXAMPLE6.6\nFinding the Percent from the Total and the Part\n1. What percent of 500 is 175?\n2. What percent of 228 is 155?\nSolution\n1. Step 1:The total is 500, the percent of the total is 175. Substituting into the formula, we have\nStep 2:To find the percent, we solve the equation for the percent.\nWe see the percent in decimal form is 0.35. Converting from the decimal form yields 35%. We say that 175 is 35% of\n500.\n2. Step 1:The total is 228, the percent of the total is 155. Substituting into the formula, we have\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Understanding Percent 549\nStep 2:To find the percent, we solve the equation for the percent.\nWe see the percent is 0.6798 (rounded to four decimal places). Converting from the decimal form yields 67.98%. We\nsay that 155 is 67.98% of 228.\nYOUR TURN6.6\nFind the percent in the following:\n1. Total is 40, percent of the total is 25\n2.

Understanding\nthese types of values helps when consuming media or discussing finances, for instance. Effectively working with and\ninterpreting numbers and percents will help you become an informed consumer of this information.\nIn most cases, working through what is presented requires you to identify that you are indeed working with a question\nof percents, which two of the three values that are related through percents are known, and which of the three values\nyou need to find.\nEXAMPLE6.7\nRetention Rate at College\nJustine applies to a medium size university outside her hometown and finds out that the retention rate (percent of\nstudents who return for their sophomore year) for the 2021 academic year at the university was 84%. During a visit to\nthe registrar\u2019s office, she finds out that 1,350 people had enrolled in academic year 2021. How many students from the\nacademic year 2021 are returning for the 2022 academic year?\nSolution\nThe percent of students who will return for the 2022 academic year (the retention rate) is 84%. The total number of\nstudents who enrolled in the 2021 academic year was 1,350. This means the percent is known and the total is known.\nFrom this, we can determine the number of students who will return (percent of the total) for the 2022 academic year\nusing the formula . Substituting into the formula and calculating, we find that the number of\nstudents that are returning is\nSo 1,134 students will return for the 2022 academic year.\nYOUR TURN6.7\n1.

Solve application problems involving sales tax.\nMany people first encounter percentages during a retail transaction such as a percent discount (SALE! 25% off!!), or\nthrough sales tax (\"Wait, I thought this was $1.99?\"), a report that something has increased by some percentage of the\nprevious value (NOW! 20% more!!). These are examples of percent decreases and percent increases. In this section, we\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Discounts, Markups, and Sales Tax 553\ndiscuss decrease, increase, and then the case of sales tax.\nCalculating Discounts\nRetailers frequently hold sales to help move merchandise. The sale price is almost always expressed as some amount off\nthe original price. These arediscounts, a reduction in the price of something. The price after the discount is sometimes\nreferred to as the reduced price or the sale price.\nWhen a reduction is a percent discount, it is an application of percent, which was introduced inUnderstanding Percent.\nThe formula used was . In a discount application, the discount plays the role of the part, the\npercent discount is the percentage, and the original price plays the role of the total.\nFORMULA\nThe formula for a discount based on a percentage is , with the percent\ndiscount expressed as a decimal. The price of the item after the discount is .\nThese are often combined into the following formula\nWhen the original price and the percent discount are known, the discount and the sale price can be directly computed.\nEXAMPLE6.10\nCalculating Discount for a Percent Discount\nCalculate the discount for the given price and discount percentage.

However, it is rare that the discount\npercentages are added together. For example, if you have a 15% coupon and qualify for a 20% price reduction, the\nretailer typically does not add those two percentages together to determine the new price. The retailer instead\napplies one discount, then applies the second discount to the price obtained after the first discount was deducted.\nResearch the original prices of two different laptops offered by one retail outlet.

The retailer then charges more than that\namount for the goods. This increase is called themarkup. This selling price, orretail price, is what the retailer charges\nthe consumer in order to pay their own costs and make a profit. Markup, then is very similar to discount, except we add\nthe markup, while we subtract the discount.\nFORMULA\nThe formula for a markup based on a percentage is , with the percent markup\nexpressed as a decimal.

It is most often set, collected, and spent by individual states, counties, parishes, and municipalities.\nNone of these sales tax revenues go to the federal government.\nFor example, North Carolina has a state sales tax of 4.75% while New Mexico has a state sales tax of 5%. Additionally,\nmany counties in North Carolina charge an additional 2% sales tax, bringing the total sales tax for most (72 of the 100)\ncounties in North Carolinians to 6.75%. However, in Durham, the county sales tax is 2.25% plus an additional 0.5% tax\nused to fund public transportation, bringing Durham County\u2019s sales tax to 7%. To find the sales tax in a particular place,\nthen, add other locality sales taxes to the base state sales tax rate.\nHow much we pay in sales tax depends on where we are, and what we are buying.\nTo determine the amount of sales tax on taxable purchase, we need to find the product of the purchase price, or marked\nprice, and the sales tax rate for that locality.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Discounts, Markups, and Sales Tax 561\nFORMULA\nTo calculate the amount of sales tax paid on the purchase price in a locality with sales tax given in decimal form,\ncalculate The total price is then\nWhen the sales tax calculation results in a fraction of a penny, then normal rounding rules apply, round up for half a\npenny or more, but round down for less than half a penny.\nYou should notice that this the same as markup, except using a different term.

(credit: \u201cInterest Rates\u201d by Mike Mozart/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Compute simple interest.\n2. Understand and compute future value.\n3. Compute simple interest loans with partial payments.\n4. Understand and compute present value.\nThere is truth in the phrase \u201cYou need to have money to make money.\u201d In essence, if you have money to lend, you can\nlend it at a cost to a borrower and make money on that transaction.\nWhen money is borrowed, the person borrowing the money (borrower) typically has to pay the person or entity that lent\nthe money (the lender) more than the amount of money that was borrowed. This extra money is theinterestthat is to\nbe paid. Interest is sometimes referred to as the cost to borrow, the cost of the loan, or the finance cost.\nThis idea also applies when someone deposits money in a bank account or some other form of investment. That person\nis essentially lending the money to the bank or company. The money earned by the depositor is also called interest. The\ninterest is typically based on the amount borrowed, or theprincipal.\nThe pairing of borrower and lender can take various forms. The borrower may be a consumer using a credit card or\ntaking out a loan from a bank, the lender. Companies also borrow from lending banks. Someone who invests in a\ncompany\u2019s stock is the lender in this case; the company is essentially the borrower.\nIn this section, we examine the basic building block of interest paid on loans and borrowed credit and also the returns on\ninvestments like bank accounts, simple interest.\nCompute Simple Interest\nLet\u2019s get some terminology understood. Interest to be paid by a borrower is often expressed as anannual percentage\nrate, which is the percent of the principal that is paid as interest for each year the money is borrowed. This means that\nthe more that is borrowed, the more that must be paid back. Sometimes, the interest to be paid back issimple interest,\nwhich means that the interest is calculated on the amount borrowed only.\nThe length of time until the loan must be paid off is thetermof the loan. The date when the loan must be paid off is\nwhen the loan isdue. The day that the loan is issued is theorigination date. We\u2019ll put this terminology to use in the\nfollowing examples. Note that in this section we will use letters, called variables, to represent the different parts of the\nformulas we\u2019ll be using. This will help keep our formulas and calculations manageable.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.3 \u2022 Simple Interest 567\nSimple Interest Loans with Integer Year Terms\nCalculating simple interest is similar to the percent calculations we made inUnderstanding PercentandDiscounts,\nMarkups, and Sales Tax, but must be multiplied by the term of the loan (in years, if dealing with an annual percentage\nrate).\nFORMULA\nThe simple interest, , to be paid on a loan with annual interest rate for a number of years (term of the loan) , with\nprincipal , is found using , where the decimal form of the interest rate, , is used. The total repaid, then\nis or, more directly, . This total is often referred to as the loanpayoff amount, or more\nsimply just the payoff.\nWhen the annual interest rate, the principal, and the number of years that the money is borrowed is known, the interest\nto be paid can be found and from there the total to be repaid can be calculated.\nBe aware, interest paid to a lender is almost uniformly rounded up to the next cent.\nEXAMPLE6.27\nSimple Interest on Loans with Integer Year Terms\nCalculate the simple interest to be paid on a loan with the given principal, annual percentage rate, and number of years.\nThen, calculate the loan payoff amount.\n1. Principal = $4,000, annual interest rate = 5.5%, and number of years = 4\n2. Principal = $14,800, annual interest rate = 7.9%, and number of years = 7\nSolution\n1. Substitute the principal = $4,000, the decimal form of the annual interest rate = 0.055, and number of years = 4\ninto the formula for simple interest, and calculate.\n.\nThe simple interest, or cost of the loan, to be paid on the loan is $880.\nThe loan payoff amount, or the total to be repaid, is , or $4,880.00.\n2. Substitute the principal = $14,800, the decimal form of the annual interest rate = 0.079, and number of years =\n7 into the formula for simple interest, and calculate.\n.\nThe simple interest, or cost to borrow, to be paid on the loan is $8,184.40.\nThe loan payoff amount, or the total to be repaid, is , or $22,984.40.\nYOUR TURN6.27\nCalculate the simple interest to be paid on a loan with the given principal, annual percentage rate, and number of\nyears. Then calculate the loan payoff, or total to be repaid.\n1. Principal = $6,700, annual interest rate = 11.99%, and number of years = 3\n2. Principal = $25,800, annual interest rate = 6.9%, and number of years = 5\nEXAMPLE6.28\nSimple Interest Equipment Loan\nRiley runs an auto repair shop, and needs to purchase a new brake lathe, which costs $11,995. She takes out a two-year,\nsimple interest loan at an annual interest rate of 14.9%. How much interest will she pay and how much total will she\nrepay on the loan?\nSolution\nStep 1.Determine the variables, or parts of the formula. The principal is the cost of the brake lathe, so = $11,995. 568 6 \u2022 Money Management\nThe interest rate Riley pays is 14.9%, or = 0.149 in decimal form. The length of the loan is two years, so = 2. We are first\nasked to find , the interest Riley will pay.\nStep 2.Substitute the known variables into the formula for simple interest and solve for .\nFrom Step 1 we have .\nThis tells us that the simple interest, or cost to borrow, to be paid on the loan is $3,574.51.\nStep 3.Use the formula to determine the total amount Riley will repay, .\nThe total to be repaid is , or $15,569.51.\nYOUR TURN6.28\n1. Beth is the owner of a small retail store in downtown St. Louis. The windows in the storefront need replacing, so\nshe needs to take out a $9,500 loan to get the repairs done. The rate she secures is 9.25% and the term of the\nloan is one year. How much interest will she pay and how much total will she repay on the loan?\nSimple Interest Loans with Other Lengths of Terms\nIn the previous example and Your Turn exercise, the loans were paid back in one payment after an integer number of\nyears. However, there are also loans lasting a length of time not equal to an integer number of years (like 1, 2, or 3 years\nor more), but in a number of months (like 4 months, 18 months, and so on). What model would apply to these situations?\nWhen the loan is paid back after a term that is not an integer number of years but is instead a number of months, the\nterm of the loan, or time, , is expressed as a fraction of the year. So for a 2-month loan, the time, in years, is 2/12 = 1/6.\nFor a 5-month loan, the time in years is 5/12. For an 18-month term, the term in years is 18/12 = 1.5.\nEXAMPLE6.29\nLoan to Purchase Equipment\nAbeje needs a loan to purchase equipment for the gym she is going to open. She visits the bank and secures a 4-month\nloan of $20,000. Her annual percentage rate is 6.75%. How much interest will Abeje pay and what is her loan payoff\namount?\nSolution\nAbeje\u2019s loan is for $20,000, so her principal is = 20,000. The interest rate Abeje will pay is 6.75%, or = 0.0675 in\ndecimal form. The length of the loan is 4 months, so . Substituting these in the formula for simple interest, we find\nher interest to be\nThe simple interest, or cost to borrow, to be paid on the loan is $450.00.\nThe payoff is , or $20,450.00.\nYOUR TURN6.29\n1. Samuel needs to borrow $8,400 to pay for repairs to his small manufacturing facility. He manages to get a simple\ninterest loan at 17.33%, to be paid after 6 months. How much interest will Samuel pay and what is Samuel\u2019s loan\npayoff amount?\nThose examples dealt in months. However, some loans are for days only (45 days, 60 days, 120 days). In such cases, we\nfind the daily interest rate. The fraction we will use for the daily interest rate is the interest rate (as a decimal) divided by\n365. This may be referred to as Actual/365. In order to find the term of the loan, divide the number of days in the term of\nthe loan by 365.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.3 \u2022 Simple Interest 569\nFORMULA\nTo determine the interest, , on a loan with term expressed in days, with principal of , and interest rate in decimal\nform of , calculate . Here, represents the daily interest rate.\nAlternately, the above formula is equivalent to , where the interest rate remains an annual rate, but\nthe time is expressed as a fraction of the year.\nWHO KNEW?\nIt seems reasonable to use 365 as the number of days in the year, since there are 365 days in most years. However,\nsometimes, banks have used (and continue to use) 360 as the number of days in a year. They may also treat all\nmonths as if they have 30 days. These differences lead to (sometimes small) differences in how much interest is paid.\nSince the number of days is in the denominator, a smaller denominator (360) will result in larger numbers (interest)\nthat is 365 is used for the denominator. Seethis page from ACRE(https://openstax.org/r/ACRE)for a comparison.\nEXAMPLE6.30\nLoan for Moving Costs\nDavid plans to move his family from Raleigh, North Carolina to Tempe, Arizona. His company will reimburse (pay after\nthe move) David for the move. David does research and determines that movers will cost $5,600 to move his family\u2019s\nbelongings to Tempe. He takes out a simple interest, 45-day loan at 11.75% interest to pay this cost. How much interest\nwill be paid on this 45-day loan, and what is David\u2019s loan payoff amount?\nSolution\nThis loan is in terms of days, so we will use the formula , where t is the number of days and is the\nannual interest rate.\nThe principal for the loan is the moving cost, or = 5,600. The annual interest rate that David will pay is 11.75%, which in\ndecimal is 0.1175. The length of time for the loan is 45 days, so = 45.\nSubstituting these values into the formula and calculating, we find that the interest to be paid is\n, or $81.13 (remember, interest is almost always rounded up to the next cent).\nThe payoff for the loan is $5,681.13.\nYOUR TURN6.30\n1. Heather runs a silk screen t-shirt shop, and seeks a short-term loan to pay for new inventory (paints, blades,\nshirts). They secure a $3,700 simple interest loan for 60 days, at an annual rate of 18.99%. How much will\nborrowing the money cost Heather, and what is her loan payoff amount?\nUnderstand and Compute Future Value\nMoney can be invested for a specific amount of time and earn simple interest while invested. The terminology and\ncalculations are the same as we\u2019ve already seen. However, instead of the total to be paid back, the investor is interested\nin the total value of the investment after the interest is added. This is called thefuture valueof the investment.\nFORMULA\nThe future value, , of an investment that yields simple interest is , where is the\nprincipal (amount invested at the start), is the annual interest rate in decimal form, and is the length of time the 570 6 \u2022 Money Management\nmoney is invested. The time will be an integer if the term of the deposit is an integer number of years, will be\nnumber of months/12 if the term is in months, will be actual/365 if the deposit is for a number of days.\nEXAMPLE6.31\nSimple Interest on a Deposit\nIn the following, determine how much interest was earned on the investment and the future value of the investment, if\nthe investment yields simple interest.\n1.

To find the future value, we use\nthe formula . Substituting the values and calculating, we find the future value of the investment to be\n. The future value of the investment at the end of 30 years is $7,775.00.\n3. The principal is = $10,000, the annual interest rate, in decimal form, is 0.0125, and the term is 18 months. Since\nthe term is in months, we have to write the months in terms of years. For 18 months, we use 18/12 as . The interest\nearned on the investment is , or the interest earned was $187.50. To\nfind the future value, we use the formula . Substituting the values and calculating, we find the future\nvalue of the investment to be .

Though\noverall interest rates for CDs change over time and individual returns vary with the terms of the CD, investors are\noffered predictable interest income for their investments.\nTo investigate this yourself, search online to determine the strengths and weaknesses of CDs (investopedia.com\noffers good, basic information on investing). Then, online, identify five national banks and two local banks who offer\nCDs.\n\u2022 Track the interest rates for the CDs at various terms (1 year, 3 years, 5 years) for each of the banks you found that\noffer CDs.\n\u2022 Calculate the amount of interest earned for a $10,000 deposit for each CD at each of the terms.\n\u2022 Compare the results from the various banks, CDs, and terms and decide which is the best investment. You may\nwant to consider both the length of time that the money is locked up, and the return.\nPaying Simple Interest Loans with Partial Payments\nIn every example above, there was one payment for the loan, or one withdrawal for the investment. However, for many\nloans (house, car, in-ground swimming pool), the loan will be paid back in two or more payments. Such a payment is\ncalled apartial payment, because they only pay off part of the loan.\nWhen a partial payment is made, some of the payment pays for the principal, but the rest of the payment pays for\ninterest on the principal. When making the first partial payment, the interest is calculated on the principal for the time\nbetween the origination date of the loan and the date of the payment. If another partial payment is made, the interest is\ncalculated based on the remaining principal and the time between the previous partial payment and the current partial\npayment date.\nEXAMPLE6.33\nInterest Paid in a Partial Payment on a Loan\n1.

However, the length of time for that remaining balance is the time between the partial\npayment and the day the loan is paid off.\nStep 1:Determine the remaining balance after the partial payment.\nStep 2:Calculate the number of days between the partial payment and the date the loan is paid off. This will be the time\nin the payment formula.\nStep 3:Calculate the amount to be paid at the end of the loan, or the payoff amount, using ,\nwhere is the remaining balance and is the time found in Step 2.\nEXAMPLE6.35\nFinding Loan Pay Off After a Partial Payment\nLaura takes out an $18,400 loan for 120 days at 17.9% simple interest. She makes a partial payment of $7,500 after 45\ndays. What is her payoff amount at the end of the loan?\nSolution\nThe initial balance, or principal, of her loan is $18,400. The interest rate in decimal form is 0.179. Her partial payment of\n$7,500 is made after 45 days. Using these values, we can determine how much of the partial payment is applied to the\nbalance. From there, we can determine her final loan payoff after 120 days.\nStep 1:Determine the remaining balance after the partial payment. Using the partial payment process outlined in the\nprevious example, we first find that the amount of the partial payment that is applied to the balance. Their interest paid\nin the partial payment is , or $406.07 (remember to round up!). Using\nthis and that the loan amount was for $18,400, the remaining balance on the loan after the partial payment is\n.\nStep 2:The number of days between the partial payment and the date that the loan is to be paid off is 120 \u2013 45 = 75. This\nmeans that the time between the partial payment and the final payment is 75 days.\nStep 3:To calculate the payoff amount, use , with = $11,306.07 (the remaining balance), =\n75 (from Step 2) and = 0.179. The payoff amount, then, is .\nRounding up, the payoff amount is $11,721.92. 574 6 \u2022 Money Management\nYOUR TURN6.35\n1. Paola takes out a 75-day loan for $3,500.00. Her interest rate is 11.2%. If she makes a partial payment of\n$1,250.00 after 30 days, what will her payoff be at the end of the loan?\nRepeated Partial Payments\nCar loans and mortgages (loans for homes) are paid off through repeated partial payments, most often monthly\npayments. Since car loans are often 3 to 6 years, and mortgages 15 to 30 years, calculating each individual monthly\npayment one at a time is time consuming and tedious. Even a 3-year loan would involve applying the above steps 36\ntimes! Fortunately, there is a formula for determining the amount of each partial payment for monthly payments on a\nsimple interest loan.\nFORMULA\nThe amount of monthly payments, , for a loan with principal , monthly simple interest rate (in decimal form), for\nnumber of months is found using the formula . The monthly interest rate is the annual rate\ndivided by 12. The number of months is the number of years times 12.\nEXAMPLE6.36\nCalculating Car Payments\nDesiree buys a new car, by taking a loan out from her credit union. The balance of her loan is $27,845.00. The annual\ninterest rate that Desiree will pay is 7.3%. She plans to pay this off over 4 years. How much will Desiree\u2019s monthly\npayment be?\nSolution\nTo use the formula for monthly payments, we need the principal, the interest rate, and the number of years. The\nprincipal is $27,845. The annual rate, in decimal form, is 0.073. Dividing 0.073 by 12 gives the monthly interest rate\n. She takes the loan out for 4 years, which is months. Substituting these values into\nthe formula, , we calculate:\nUsing the formula and rounding up to the next cent, we see that Desiree\u2019s monthly payment will be $670.67.\nYOUR TURN6.36\n1.

However, most spreadsheet programs, including\nGoogle Sheets, have a payment function. In Google Sheets, that function is PMT. To find the payment for an\ninstallment loan (like for a car), you need to enter the interest rate per period, the number of payments, and the loan\namount. FromYour Turn 6.36, the rate was 0.0476/12, the number of payments was 60, and the loan amount was\n$23,660.

If we set a goal for the future, it would be useful to know how much to deposit now so\nan account reaches the goal. The amount that needs to be deposited now to hit a goal in the future is called thepresent\nvalue.\nFORMULA\nThe present value, , of money deposited at an annual, simple interest rate of (in decimal form) for time (in\nyears) with a specified future value of , is calculated with the formula .\nNote: Present value, in this calculation, is always rounded up. Otherwise, future value may fall short of the target\nfuture value.\nUnderstanding what this tells you is important.

We substitute those values into the formula and calculate.\n. Rounding up, we see that the present value\nof $10,000 invested at a simple annual interest rate of 5.5% for 15 years is $5,479.46. This means that $5,479.46\nneeds to be invested so that, after 15 years at 5.5% interest, the investment will be worth $10,000.\n2. The future value is = $150,000. The time of the investment is in years, so = 20. The annual, simple interest rate\nis 6.25%, which in decimal form is 0.0625. We substitute those values into the formula and calculate.\n. Rounding up, we see that the present value\nof $150,000 invested at a simple annual interest rate of 6.25% for 20 years is $66,666.67. This means that $66,666.67\nneeds to be invested so that, after 20 years at 6.25% interest, the investment will be worth $150,000.\n3. The future value is = $250,000. The time of the investment is 486 months. This needs to be converted to years. To\ndo so, divide the number of months by 12, giving , so = 40.5 years. The annual, simple interest\nrate is 4.75%, which in decimal form is 0.0475. We substitute those values into the formula and calculate.\n. Rounding up, we see that the\npresent value of $250,000 invested at a simple annual interest rate of 4.75% for 486 months is $129,954.52.

Compute compound interest.\n2. Determine the difference in interest between simple and compound calculations.\n3. Understand and compute future value.\n4. Compute present value.\n5. Compute and interpret effective annual yield.\nFor a very long time in certain parts of the world, interest was not charged due to religious dictates. Once this restriction\nwas relaxed, loans that earned interest became possible. Initially, such loans had short terms, so only simple interest was\napplied to the loan. However, when loans began to stretch out for years, it was natural to add the interest at the end of\neach year, and add the interest to the principal of the loan. After another year, the interest was calculated on the initial\nprincipal plus the interest from year 1, or, the interest earned interest. Each year, more interest was added to the money\nowed, and that interest continued to earn interest.\nSince the amount in the account grows each year, more money earns interest, increasing the account faster. This growth\nfollows a geometric series (Geometric Sequences). It is this feature that gives compound interest its power. This module\ncovers the mathematics of compound interest.\nUnderstand and Compute Compound Interest\nAs we saw inSimple Interest, an account that pays simple interest only pays based on the original principal and the term\nof the loan. Accounts offeringcompound interestpay interest at regular intervals. After each interval, the interest is\nadded to the original principal. Later, interest is calculated on the original principal plus the interest that has been added\npreviously.\nAfter each period, the interest on the account is computed, then added to the account. Then, after the next period, when\ninterest is computed, it is computed based on the original principal AND the interest that was added in the previous\nperiods. 580 6 \u2022 Money Management\nThe following example illustrates how compounded interest works.\nEXAMPLE6.39\nInterest Compounded Annually\nAbena invests $1,000 in a CD (certificate of deposit) earning 4% compounded annually. How much will Abena\u2019s CD be\nworth after 3 years?\nSolution\nSince the interest is compounded annually, the interest will be computed at the end of each year and added to the CD\u2019s\nvalue. The interest at the end of the following year will be based on the value found form the previous year.\nStep 1:After the first year, the interest in Abena\u2019s CD is computed using the interest formula . The principal\nis = 1,000, the rate, as a decimal, is 0.04, and the time is one year, so = 1. Using that, the interest earned in the first\nyear is , so the interest earned in the first year was $40.00. This is added to the\nvalue of the CD, making the CD worth .\nStep 2:At the end of the second year, interest is again computed, but is computed based on the CD\u2019s new value, $1,040.\nUsing this new value and the interest formula ( and are still 0.04 and 1, respectively), we see that the CD earned\n, or $41.60. This is added to the value of the CD, making the CD now worth\n.\nStep 3:At the end of the third year, interest is again computed, but is computed based on Abena\u2019s CD\u2019s new value,\n$1,081.60. Using this value and the interest formula ( and are still 0.04 and 1, respectively), we see that the CD earned\n, or $43.26 (remember to round down). This is added to the value of the\nCD, making the CD now worth .\nAfter 3 years, Abena\u2019s CD is worth $1,124.86.\nYOUR TURN6.39\n1.

Had\nAbena invested in a CD with simple interest, how much would the CD have been worth after 3 years? How much more\ndid Abena earn using compound interest?\nSolution\nHad Abena invested $1,000 in a 4% simple interest CD for 3 years, her CD would have been worth\n, or $1,120.00. With interest compounded annually, Abena\u2019s CD was\nworth $1,124.86. The difference between compound and simple interest is .

This gives information that can be used to identify\nthe best investment from a yield perspective.\nUsing a formula, we can interpret compound interest as simple interest. The effective annual yield formula stems from\nthe compound interest formula and is based on an investment of $1 for 1 year.\nEffective annual yield is where = effective annual yield, = interest rate in decimal form, and =\nnumber of times the interest is compounded in a year. is interpreted as the equivalent annual simple interest rate.\nEXAMPLE6.46\nDetermine and Interpret Effective Annual Yield for 6% Compounded Quarterly\nSuppose you have an investment paying a rate of 6% compounded quarterly.

Designing your budget\nwill help understand the financial priorities you have, and the constraints on your life choices. You want to have enough\nincome to pay not only for the necessities, but also for things that represent your wants, like trips or dinner out. You also\nmay want to save money for large purchases or retirement. You do not want to just get by, and you do not want the\nproblems associated with overdue balances, rising debt, and possibly losing something you have worked hard to obtain.\nWhile creating a budget may seem intimidating at first, coming up with your basic budget outline is the hardest part.\nOver time, you will adjust not only the numbers, but the categories.\nCreating a Budget\nYou should view creating abudgetas a financial tool that will help you achieve your long-term goals. A budget is an\nestimation of income and expenses over some period of time. You will be able to track your progress, which will help you\nto prepare for the future by making smart investment decisions.\nThere are several budget-creating tools available, such as the apps Good budget and Mint, and Google Sheets. Getting\nstarted, though, begins well before you find an app. The following are steps that can be used to create your monthly\nbudget.\n1. Track your income and expensesReview your income and expenses for the past 6 months to a year. This will give\nyou an idea of your current habits.\n2. Set your income baselineDetermine all the sources of income you will have. This income may from paychecks,\ninvestments, or freelance work. It even includes child support and gifts. Be sure to use income after taxes. This\nallows you to determine your maximum expenditures per month.\nFor income that is not steady, such as gig work or freelance work, use the previous 6 to 12 months of income to find\nan average income from that gig or freelance work. Use this average in the budgeting process.\n3. Determine your expensesReview your bills from the past 6 months. You should include mortgage payments or\nrent, insurance, car payments, utilities, groceries, transportation expenses, personal care, entertainment, and\nsavings. Using your credit card statements and bank statements will help you determine these amounts. Be aware\nthat some of the expenses will not change over time. These are referred to asfixed expenses, like rent, car\npayments, insurance, internet service, and the like. Other expenses may vary widely from month to month and are\nappropriately calledvariable expenses, and include such expenses as gasoline, groceries.\nSome expenses are yearly, such as insurance or property taxes. Other expanses may be quarterly (four times per\nyear) or semiannual (twice per year). To budget for such bills by month, divide the bill total by the number of months\nthe bill covers.\n4. Categorize your expensesThese categories may be housing, transportation, or food, for broad categories, or may\nget more specific, where you categorize car payments, car insurance, and gasoline separately. The categories are\nyour choices. Be sure to account for the cost of maintaining a vehicle or home. The more specific you are, the better\nyou\u2019ll understand your spending needs and habits.\n5. Total your monthly income and monthly expenses and compareThese values should be compared. If your\nexpenses are higher than your income, then adjustments have to be made. Decisions of what to do with any extra\nincome is part of the planning process also.\n6. Make plans for unplanned expensesAsk anyone, an unexpected car repair can ruin a carefully crafted budget.\nHave a plan for how you can be ready for these random expenses.

Use your budget to make decisions and adjust for any changesYour budget is a changeable document. Add to it\nwhen you wish, refer to it when special purchases are to be made. Keeping your budget up to date helps\naccommodate changes in income and expenses.\nVIDEO\nCreating a Budget(https://openstax.org/r/creating_budget)\nIn this section, we will focus on income and expenses. One of the easiest ways to manage a budget is to create a table,\nwith one column containing income sources, another with income values, a third with expense categories, and a last\ncontaining expenses.

This amount\nof money varies from state to state, and sometimes even city to city. For a person making $50,000 per year gross\nsalary in Salt Lake City, Utah, take home pay is about 75.6% of gross salary. In Detroit, Michigan, take home pay is\nabout 74.5% of gross salary. Lakeland, Florida, take home pay is about 80.5% of gross salary. These also change based\non how much a person earns! Before choosing a place to live, it makes sense to determine how much deductions\nfrom pay will impact your income.\nEXAMPLE6.49\nCreating a Budget\nHeather has graduated college and currently works as a nurse for a rural medical group.

Maddy works as a mechanical engineer, making $6,093.75 monthly after payroll taxes. Her monthly expenses are\nher mortgage at $1,452.89, car payments at $627.38, car insurance at $179.00, health insurance at $265.00,\nutilities at $320, clothing at $150, entertainment at $400, credit card debt at $450, food at $370, and gasoline at\n$175. Create Maddy\u2019s budget in a table, compare the total income to total expenses, and determine how much\nexcess income per month she has or how much she falls short by each month.\nUsing the budget process, we can make decisions on adding expenses to the budget. To do so, check the cushion of the\nbudget to see if there is room in the budget for the new expense.\nEXAMPLE6.51\nAdding to an Existing Budget\nIn the example above, Carol had excess income of $708.00. She looks up the cost of before-school care for her daughter.\nShe finds that, monthly, the cost would be $252.00 per month. Is this an affordable program for Carol? Add this expense\nto her budget table.\nSolution\nShe can afford this, as the cost for the before school program is $252.00 and she had extra income of $708.00.

Recall Heather\u2019s budget from Example 6.49. She decides she wants to buy her own home, which would increase\nher expenses. Instead of $1,050.00 in rent, she would pay $1,240.00 for her mortgage. Her utilities costs would\nincrease to $295.00 per month. Add these to Heather\u2019s budget to determine if the changes are affordable.\nThe 50-30-20 Budget Philosophy\nIt isn\u2019t clear, obvious, or easy to decide how much of your income to allocate to various categories of expenses. Many\npeople pay their bills and then consider all the leftover money to be spending money. However, when developing your\nown budget, you may want to follow the50-30-20 budget philosophy, which provides a basic guideline for how your\nincome could be allocated. Fifty percent of your budget is allotted to your needs, 30% of your budget is allotted to pay\nfor your wants, and 20% of your budget is allotted for savings and debt service (paying off your debts).\nKnowing what expenses are necessary and what expenses are wants is important, since wants and needs are often\nconfused. The following arenecessary expensesthat represent basic living requirements and debt services. This list\nisn\u2019t complete: mortgage/rent, utilities, car, car insurance, health care, groceries, gasoline, child care (for working\nparents), and minimum debt payments. The 50-30-20 budget philosophy suggests that 50%, or half, your income go to\nthese necessities.\nWants, though, are things you could live without but still wish to have, such as Amazon Prime, restaurant dinners, coffee\nfrom Starbucks, vacation trips, and hobby costs. Even a gym membership or that new laptop are wants. Creating the\nroom to afford these wants is important to our mental health. Not budgeting for things we want will negatively impact\nour quality of life.\nThe remaining 20% should be set aside, either in retirement funds, stocks, other investments, an emergency fund\n(recommendations are that an emergency fund have 3 months of income), and perhaps extra spent to pay down debt.\nThis 20% is very useful for addressing those unexpected costs, such as repairs or replacement of items that no longer\nwork. Without budgeting this cushion, any expense that is a surprise can cause us to miss necessary payments.\nThe list of necessary expenses was not complete. There are other expenses that could be included.\nNecessary Expenses and Expenses that are Wants\nFor some people, an expense will be necessary while the same expense for someone else will be a want. A good example\nof this is internet service. Many people consider internet service as a need, especially those who work from home or who\nare not able to leave their homes. One could also call internet service a need if they have children in school. For others,\ninternet service is a want. If a person\u2019s job doesn\u2019t require them to be online, if they are not in school, if they do not have\nkids, then internet service can be dropped. There are public options for internet service. One could even use their phone\nas a hot spot.\nCars often fall into the category of need, but could also fall into the want category, depending on where and how you 596 6 \u2022 Money Management\nlive. Bikes, public transportation, and walking are all options that could replace a car. This would then remove the cost of\ngasoline and car insurance.\nAnother consideration when deciding if an item on your budget is a need or a want is about your choices and priorities.\nA car is a need for many. But the need for a car is not the same as the need for a specific car. If you choose to buy a car\nwith payments that exceed your budgeted amount for the car, then that car is a want. The amount you exceed the\nbudget now belongs in the want category.\nThe same can be said for housing. If you want an apartment that costs $1,250 per month, but your budget only allows\nfor an apartment that costs $900, then $350 of the rent is a want.\nThe point of that is to carefully consider if an expense is a need as opposed to a want.\nWhen your expenses exceed your income, you may want to change how you budget your income to line up with these\nguidelines. This may mean cutting back, finding less-expensive living arrangements, finding a less-expensive (and more\nfuel-efficient) car, or sacrificing some specialty groceries. Using these guidelines keeps your financial life manageable.\nBetter still, they can guide you as you begin your life after graduation.\nEXAMPLE6.52\nEvaluate a Budget Using 50-30-20 model\nIn the example above, after Carol added before school care for her daughter to the budget, her budget was as shown\nbelow.

Applying the 50-30-20 budget philosophy to this income requires the calculation of\neach of those percentages.\nFor the necessities, Carol should budget 50% of her income, or .\nFor her wants, she should budget 30% of her income, or .\nFor savings and extra debt service, she should budget 20% of her income, or .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.5 \u2022 Making a Personal Budget 597\nIn her budget, her necessities include all expenses except for entertainment. These expenses total $2,480, which exceeds\nthe suggested budget amount of $1568.00. To follow the guidelines, Carol would have to cut back on these necessities.\nFor her wants, she spends $200.00 on entertainment, which is well below the suggested budget amount of $940.80. If\nshe modifies how much she spends on needs, she may be able to increase the spending on her wants.\nHer excess income is $456.00, which is below what she should be saving and using to pay down extra debt. If she does\nadjust how much she spends on needs, she could increase the amount for savings.\nYOUR TURN6.52\n1. Recall Heather\u2019s budget from Example 6.49, before she thought of moving.

Distinguish various basic forms of savings plans.\n2. Compute return on investment for basic forms of savings plans.\n3. Compute payment to reach a financial goal.\nThe stock market crash of 1929 led to the Great Depression, a decade-long global downturn in productivity and\nemployment. A state of shock swept through the United States; the damage to people\u2019s lives was immeasurable.\nAmericans no longer trusted established financial institutions. By October 1931, the banking industry\u2019s biggest challenge\nwas restoring confidence to the American public. In the next 10 years, the federal government would impose strict\nregulations and guidelines on the financial industry. The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 created the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC), which insures bank deposits. The new federal guidelines helped ease suspicions among\nthe general public about the banking industry. Gradually, things returned to normal, and today we have more\ninvestment instruments, many insured through the FDIC, than ever before.\nIn this section, we will first look at the different types of savings accounts and proceed to discuss the various types of\ninvestments. There is some overlap, but we will try to differentiate among these financial instruments. Saving money\nshould be a goal of every adult, but it can also be a difficult goal to attain.\nDistinguish Various Basic Forms of Savings Plans\nThere are at least three types of savings accounts. Traditional savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money\nmarket accounts are three main savings account vehicles.\nSavings Account\nA savings account is probably the most well-known type of investment, and for many people it is their first experience\nwith a bank. Asavings accountis a deposit account, held at a bank or other financial institution, which bears some\ninterest on the deposited money. Savings accounts are intended as a place to save money for emergencies or to achieve\nshort-term goals. They typically pay a low interest rate, but there is virtually no risk involved, and they are insured by the\nFDIC for up to $250,000.\nSavings accounts have some strengths. They are highly flexible. Generally, there are no limitations on the number of\nwithdrawals allowed and no limit on how much you can deposit. It is not unusual, however, that a savings account will\nhave a minimum balance in order for the bank to pay maintenance costs. If your account should dip below the\nminimum, there are usually fees attached. 602 6 \u2022 Money Management\nWHO KNEW?\nMany banks are covered by FDIC insurance. The FDIC is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and is an\nindependent agency created by the U.S. Congress. One of its purposes is to provide insurance for deposits in banks,\nincluding savings accounts. Be aware, not all banks are FDIC insured. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 for a savings\naccount, so you do not want your balance to exceed that federally insured limit.\nHaving your savings account at the same bank as your checking account does offer a real advantage. For example, if\nyour checking account is approaching its lower limit, you can transfer funds from your savings account and avoid any\nbank fees. Similarly, if you have an excess of funds in your checking account, you can transfer funds to your savings\naccount and earn some interest. Checking accounts rarely pay interest.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nJ.P. Morgan\nJ.P. Morgan was a wealthy banker around the turn of the 20th century. His business interests included railroads and\nthe steel industry. However, it was in 1907 that a financial crisis, caused by poor banking decisions and followed by\nsuch great distrust in the banking system that a frenzy of withdrawals from banks occurred, that J.P. Morgan and\nother wealthy bankers lent from their own funds to help stabilize and save the system.\nThere are some weaknesses to savings accounts. Primarily, it is because savings accounts earn very low interest rates.\nThis means they are not the best way to grow your money. Experts, though, recommend keeping a savings account\nbalance to cover 3 to 6 months of living expenses in case you should lose your job, have a sudden medical expense, or\nother emergency.\nAround tax time, you will receive a 1099-INT form stating the amount of interest earned on your savings, which is the\namount that must be reported when you file your tax return. A1099 formis a tax form that reports earnings that do not\ncome from your employer, including interest earned on savings accounts. These 1099 forms have the suffix INT to\nindicate that the income is interest income.\nSavings accounts earn interest, and those earnings can be found using the interest formulas from previous sections. The\nfinal value of these accounts is sometimes called the future value of the account.\nEXAMPLE6.55\nSingle Deposit in a Savings Account\nViolet deposits $4,520.00 in a savings account bearing 1.45% interest compounded annually. If she does not add to or\nwithdraw any of that money, how much will be in the account after 3 years?\nSolution\nTo find the compound interest, use the formula fromCompound Interest, , where represents the\namount in the account after years, with initial deposit (or principal) of , at an annual interest rate, in decimal form, of\n, compounded times per year. Violet has a principal of $4,520.00, which will earn an interest of = 0.0145,\ncompounded yearly (so = 1), for = 3 years. Substituting and calculating, we find that Violet\u2019s account will be worth\nOr, Violet will have $4,719.48 after 3 years.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.6 \u2022 Methods of Savings 603\nYOUR TURN6.55\n1. Brian deposits $5,600 in a savings account that yields 1.23% interest compounded annually. If he leaves that\ndeposit in the account and adds nothing new to the account, what will the account be worth in 5 years?\nWHO KNEW?\nBanks have not always offered interest on savings accounts. An 1836 publication from Indiana noted that banks in\nother states allow small interest on deposits. It specifically says that in these other states, these deposits are what\nbusiness transactions are based upon. And that giving interest would encourage deposits, and thus increase the\nbusiness that banks can do.\nJournal of the House of Representatives of the Sate of Indiana(https://openstax.org/r/onepage)\nCertificates of Deposit, or CDs\nWe discussedcertificates of deposit(CDs) in earlier sections. CDs differ from savings accounts in a few ways. First, the\ninvestment lasts for a fixed period of time, agreed to when the money is invested in the CD. These time periods often\nrange from 6 months to 5 years. Money from the CD cannot be withdrawn (without penalty) until the investment period\nis up. Also, money cannot be added to an existing CD.\nCertificates of deposit have features similar to savings accounts. They are insured by the FDIC. They are entirely safe.\nThey do, though, offer a better interest rate. The trade-off is that once the money is invested in a CD, that money is\nunavailable until the investment period ends.\nEXAMPLE6.56\n5-Year CD\nSilvio deposits $10,000 in a CD that yields 2.17% compounded semiannually for 5 years. How much is the CD worth after\n5 years?\nSolution\nThis also uses the compound interest formula fromCompound Interest, , Substituting the values =\n$10,000, = 0.0217, = 2 (semiannually means twice per year), and = 5, we find the account will be worth\nThe CD will be worth $11,219.53 after 5 years.\nYOUR TURN6.56\n1. Denise deposits $3,500 in a CD bearing 2.23% interest compounded quarterly for 3 years. How much will Denise\u2019s\nCD be worth after those 3 years?\nMoney Market Account\nAmoney market accountis similar to a savings account, except the number of transactions (withdrawals and transfers)\nis generally limited to six each month. Money market accounts typically have a minimum balance that must be\nmaintained. If the balance in the account drops below the minimum, there is likely to be a penalty. Money market\naccounts offer the flexibility of checks and ATM cards. Finally, the interest rate on a money market account is typically 604 6 \u2022 Money Management\nhigher than the interest rate on a savings account.\nEXAMPLE6.57\nSingle Deposit to a Money Market Account\nMarietta opens a money market account, and deposits $2,500.00 in the account. It bears 1.76% interest compounded\nmonthly. If she makes no other transactions on the account, how much will be in the account after 4 years?\nSolution\nThis, once again, uses the compound interest formula fromCompound Interest: , Substituting the\nvalues = $25,000, = 0.0176, = 12, and = 4, we find the account will be worth\nThe money market account will be worth $2,682.20 after 4 years.\nYOUR TURN6.57\n1.

Such a measure isreturn on investment.\nFORMULA\nThe return on investment, often denoted ROI, is the percent difference between the initial investment, , and the\nfinal value of the investment, , or , expressed as a percentage.\nThe length of time of the investment is not considered in ROI.\nEXAMPLE6.58\nCalculating Return on Investment\n1. Determine the return on investment for the 5-year CD fromExample 6.56. Round the percentage to two decimal\nplaces.\n2. Determine the return on investment for the money market account fromExample 6.57. Round the percentage to\ntwo decimal places.\nSolution\n1. The initial deposit in the CD was $10,000, so = $10,000. The value at the end of 5 years was $11,239.53. so =\n$11,239.53.

In reality, people often open accounts that\nallow them to add deposits, orpayments, to the account at regular intervals. This agrees with the 50-30-20 budget\nphilosophy, where some income is saved every month. When a deposit is made at the end of each compounding period,\nsuch a savings account is called anordinary annuity.\nThe formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is , where is the future value\nof the annuity, is the payment, is the annual interest rate (in decimal form), is the number of compounding\nperiods per year, and is the number of years.\nIt is important to note that the number of deposits per year and the number of periods per year are the same.\nAnother form of annuity if the annuity due, which has deposits at the start of each compounding period. This other\nannuity type has different formulas and is not addressed in this text.\nEXAMPLE6.59\nFuture Value of an Ordinary Annuity\nJill has an account that bears 3.75% interest compounded monthly. She decides to deposit $250.00 each month, at the 606 6 \u2022 Money Management\nend of the compounding period, into this account. What is the future value of this account, after 8 years?\nSolution\nThese are regular payments into an account bearing compound interest. She is depositing them at the end of each\ncompounding period. This makes this an ordinary annuity. Substituting the values = 250, = 0.0375, = 12, and = 8\ninto the formula, we find the future value of the account.\nThe account, after 8 years, will contain $27,938.20.\nYOUR TURN6.59\n1.

Distinguish between basic forms of investments including stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.\n2. Understand what bonds are and how bond investments work.\n3. Understand how stocks are purchased and gain or lose value.\n4. Read and derive information from a stock table.\n5. Define a mutual fund and how to invest.\n6. Compute return on investment for basic forms of investments.\n7. Compute future value of investments.\n8. Compute payment to reach a financial goal.\n9. Identify and distinguish between retirement savings accounts.\nYou can save your money in a safe or a vault (or worse, under the mattress!), but that money does not grow. It would be\nhard to save enough for retirement that way. What can be done to increase the value of the money you already have?\nThe answer is to invest it. Use the money that you have to earn more money back. For instance, as we saw inMethods of\nSavings, you can save it in a bank. Or, to reach loftier goals, invest in something more likely to grow, such as stocks.\nA great example of this is Apple stock. Anyone who bought stock in Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc.) in 1997\nand held onto the shares earned a lot of money.To be more specific, $100 worth of Apple shares bought in 1980, when it\nwas first sold to the public, was valued at $67,564 in 2019, or 676 times more!(https://openstax.org/r/much_aspx)\nPerhaps you have heard a story like that, of an investment opportunity taken that paid off, or the story of an investment\nopportunity missed. But such stories are the exceptions.\nIn this section, we\u2019ll investigate bonds, stocks, and mutual funds and their comparative strengths and weaknesses. We\nclose the section with a discussion of retirement savings accounts.\nDistinguish Between Basic Forms of Investments\nBonds, stocks, and mutual funds tend to offer higher returns, but to varying degrees, come with higher risks. Stocks and\nmutual funds also vary in how much they earn. Their predicted rates of return on investment are not guaranteed, but\neducated guesses based on market trends and historical performance.\nWe will use the methods and formulas we learned earlier to evaluate these forms of investment.\nBonds\nBondsare issued from big companies and from governments. Selling bonds is an alternative to an institution taking a\nloan from a bank. The funds from the selling of bonds are often used for large projects, like funding the building of a\nnew highway or hospital.\nBonds are considered a conservative investment. They are bought for what is known as theissue price. The interest is\nfixed (does not change) at the time of purchase and is based on the issue price of the bond. The interest rate is often\nreferred to as the coupon rate; the interest paid is often called the coupon yield. The interest paid is often higher than\nsavings accounts and the risk is exceptionally low. The bond is for a fixed length of time. The end of this time is the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.7 \u2022 Investments 613\nmaturity date of the bond.\nThere are several types of bonds:\n\u2022 Treasury bondsare issued by the federal government.\n\u2022 Municipal bondsare issued by state and local governments.\n\u2022 Corporate bondsare issued by major corporations.\nThere are other types of bonds available, but they are beyond the scope of this section.\nWHO KNEW?\nTrading Bonds\nBonds are often part of larger investment portfolios. These bonds may be traded. However, the interest paid is based\non the price when the bond was bought (the issue price). These bonds can be bought and sold for more or less\nmoney than the issue price. If the bond is bought for more than the issue price, the interest is still paid on the issue\nprice, not on the purchase price when the trade was made. This means the actual return on the bond decreases. If the\nbond is bought for less than the issue price, the return on the bond goes up.\nVIDEO\nBonds(https://openstax.org/r/investing_basics_bonds)\nEXAMPLE6.62\nBond Investment\nMuriel purchases a $3,000 bond with a maturity of 4 years at a fixed coupon rate of 5.5% paid annually.

The performance and earnings of stocks is\nnot guaranteed, which makes them riskier than any other investment discussed earlier. However, they can offer higher\nreturn on investment than the other investments. Their value grows in two ways. They offerdividends, which is a\nportion of the profit made by the company. And the price per share can increase based on how others see that value of\nthe company changing. If the value of the company drops, or the company folds, the money invested in the stock also\ndrops.\nMost stock transactions are executed through a broker. Brokers\u2019 commissions can be a percentage of value of the trades\nmade or a flat fee. There are full-service brokers who charge higher commission rates, but they also offer financial advice\nand perform the research that you may not have the time or the expertise to do on your own. A discount broker only\nexecutes the stock transactions, buying or selling, so they charge lower rates than full-service brokers. There are also\nbrokers that offer commission-free trading.\nAn important thing to remember is that stocks might provide a very large return on investment, but the trade-off is the\nrisk associated with owning stocks. 614 6 \u2022 Money Management\nWHO KNEW?\nChapter 11 Bankruptcy and Stocks\nIn the fall of 2022, the parent company of Regal Theaters, named Cineworld, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nAccording to news articles, the bankruptcy was necessitated due to its heavy debt load. Generally, a company can file\nfor Chapter 11 bankruptcy to allow them time to reorganize and restructure debts. When this happens, the company,\nafter the Chapter 11 process is over, offers new stock. This makes the previous stock worthless. However, the company\nmay allow an exchange of old stock for a discounted amount of the new stock. This in effect reduces (maybe vastly)\nthe wealth held by those who owned the original stock.\nEXAMPLE6.63\nBuying Stock in Company ABC\nHaniah buys stock in the ABC company, investing a total of $13,000.

Volkswagen seems to be a rather safe\ninvestment. But in 2015, Volkswagen\u2019s stock tumbled 30% over a few days when it was revealed that the company had\ninstalled software that altered the emission performance of some of their diesel engines.

When you buy shares of a mutual fund, your\nmoney is pooled with the assets of other investors. This pooled money is invested in stocks, bonds, money market\ninstruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are typically operated by professional money managers who allocate the\nfund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors.\nA key benefit of mutual funds is that they allow small or individual investors to invest in professionally managed\nportfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. This means each shareholder participates proportionally in the gains\nor losses of the fund. The performance of a mutual fund is usually stated as how much the mutual fund\u2019s total value has\nincreased or decreased. Since there are many different investments inside the mutual fund, the risk is reduced\nsignificantly, compared to direct ownership of stocks. Even so, mutual funds historically perform well and can earn more\nthan 10% annually.\nThe investments that make up a mutual fund are structured and maintained to match stated investment objectives,\nwhich are specified in itsprospectus. A prospectus is a pamphlet or brochure that provides information about the\nmutual fund. Before buying shares of a mutual fund, consult its prospectus, consider its goals and strategies to see if\nthey match your goals and values and also research any associated fees.\nVIDEO\nMutual Funds(https://openstax.org/r/investing_basics_mutual_funds)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.7 \u2022 Investments 621\nEXAMPLE6.68\nInvesting in a Mutual Fund\nKaitlyn has analyzed her $12,862.50 quarterly budget using the 50-30-20 budget philosophy, and sees she should be\nsaving or paying down debt with $2,572.50 per quarter. She decides to invest $1,300 quarterly a mutual fund that reports\nan average return of 11.62% over the 18-year life of the mutual fund. Assuming that this interest rate continues, and is\ncompounded quarterly, how much will her mutual fund account be worth after 5 years?\nSolution\nKaitlyn\u2019s plan is an ordinary annuity, and so the future value of her account can be found using the formula\n, with a payment of $1,300, a rate of 0.1162, number of compounding periods 4, after 5\nyears.

What was Muriel\u2019s return on investment?\nSolution\nEach year, Muriel received $165. She received this money four times, so earned a total of $660. This represents \u2013 ,\nor just the earnings.

What is\nMaureen\u2019s return on investment?\nAs mentioned, the ROI does not address the length of time of the investment. A good way to do that is to equate the ROI\nto an account bearing interest that is compounded annually.\nThe annual return is the average annual rate, or the annual percentage yield (APY) that would result in the same amount\nwere the interest paid once a year.\nFORMULA\nThe formula for annual return is , where = the number of years, = new value, and\n= starting principal.\nWe apply this to the previous example.\nEXAMPLE6.71\nAnnual Return on Investment for a Bond\nRecallExample 6.70, in which Muriel purchased a $3,000 bond with a maturity of 4 years at a fixed coupon rate of 5.5%\npaid annually.

The starting principal was $3,000. The value\nat the end of 4 years was $3,000 + $660 = $3,660. The time of the investment was 4 years.

Each has distinct characteristics that are suited to different\ninvestors\u2019 needs.\nIndividual Retirement Accounts\nAtraditional IRAlets you contribute up to an amount set by the government, which may change from year to year. For\nexample, the maximum contribution for 2022 is $6,000; $7,000 over age 50. Anyone is eligible to contribute to a\ntraditional IRA, regardless of your income level. Your money grows tax-deferred, but withdrawals after age 59\u00bd are taxed\nat current rates. Traditional IRAs also allow you to use the contribution itself as a deduction on a current year tax return.\nRoth IRAsallow contributions at the same levels as traditional IRAs, with a maximum $6,000 for 2022; $7,000 over age\n50. However, to be eligible to make contributions, your earned income must be below a certain level. A Roth IRA allows\nafter-tax contributions. In other words, the contribution itself is not tax-deductible, as it is with the traditional IRA.\nHowever, your money grows tax-free. If you make no withdrawals until you are age 59\u00bd, there are no penalties. IRAs pay\na modest interest rate.\nIn either case, IRA deposits have to be from earned income, which in effect means if your earned income is over $6,000\n($7,000) then you can deposit the maximum.\nEXAMPLE6.74\nComparing Roth IRAs to Traditional IRAs\nWhich type of IRA, Roth or traditional, has an income limit for its use?\nSolution\nRoth IRAs require income to be below a certain limit.\nYOUR TURN6.74\n1. Which type of IRA, Roth or traditional, allow deposits before tax, but have earnings that are taxed after the age of\n59 \u00bd?\nWHO KNEW?\nIn 2022, the maximum that can be added to a Roth IRA was $6,000 for those under 50 years of age. For those over 50\nyears of age, the maximum that can be added to a Roth IRA is $7,000. However, to qualify for a Roth IRA in fall of\n2022, a single person\u2019s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) must be below $129,000. Then, if a single person\u2019s\nincome is between $129,000 and $144,000, the maximum contribution is reduced from the limit for incomes below\n$129,000. For a married couples filing a joint tax return those values are $204,000 to $214,000.\n401(k) Accounts\nYour employer may offer a retirement account to you. These are often in the form of a401(k)account. There are\ntraditional and Roth 401(k) accounts, which differ in how they are taxed, much as with other IRAs. In the traditional\n401(k) plans, the money is deposited before tax is assessed, which means you do not pay taxes on this money. However,\nthat means when money is withdrawn, it is taxed. These accounts are similar to mutual funds, in that the money is\ninvested in a wide range of assets, spreading the risk.\nOne of the perks some employers offer is to match some amount of your contributions to the 401(k) plan. For instance,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.7 \u2022 Investments 625\nthey may match your deposits up to 5% of your income.

What is the most money that Alice can deposit that will be fully matched by the company?\n2. How much total will be deposited into Alice\u2019s account if she deposits the full 6%?\n3. How much return does Alice earn if she deposits exactly 6% in her 401(k)?\nSolution\n1. The employer will match up to 6% of any employee\u2019s salary. 6% of Alice\u2019s salary is . So Alice\ncan deposit up to $3,096 and receive that amount in matching funds in her account.\n2. Alice\u2019s contribution plus the company\u2019s contribution is , which is the total that is deposited\ninto Alice\u2019s account.\n3.

How much return does Jameis earn if he deposits exactly 7.5% in her 401(k)?\n401(k) plans with matching funds provide great value, as their rates of return are high compared to savings accounts,\nand are less risky that stocks since such funds invest across many investment vehicles. The next example demonstrates\nthe power of constant deposits into a 401(k) plan that has some employer match.\nEXAMPLE6.76\nConstant Deposits into a 401(k) Plan\nDeJean begins depositing $300 per month from his paycheck each month in his employer-based 401(k) account.

How much will DeJean\u2019s account be worth if he keeps making those payments for 30 years?\n2. What will his account be worth without the matching funds?\nSolution\n1. This is a form of an ordinary annuity, so the formula will be used. The company\nmatches DeJean\u2019s full deposit, so each month $600 will be deposited.

(credit: \"Closing\" by Tim\nPierce/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Describe various reasons for loans.\n2. Describe the terminology associated with loans.\n3. Understand how credit scoring works.\n4. Calculate the payment necessary to pay off a loan.\n5. Read an amortization table.\n6. Determine the cost to finance for a loan.\nNew car envy is real. Some people look at a new car and feel that they too should have a new car. The search begins.\nThey find the model they want, in the color they want, with the features they want, and then they look at the price. That\u2019s\noften the point where the new car fever breaks and the reality of borrowing money to purchase the car enters the\npicture. This borrowing takes the form of a loan.\nIn this section, we look at the basics of loans, including terminology, credit scores, payments, and the cost of borrowing\nmoney.\nReasons for Loans\nEven if you want a new car because you need one, or if you need a new computer since your current one no longer runs\nas fast or smoothly as you would like, or you need a new chimney because the one on your house is crumbling, it\u2019s likely\nyou do not have that cost in cash. Those are very large purchases. How do you buy that if you don \u2019t have the cash?\nYou borrow the money.\nAnd for helping you with your purchase, the company or bank charges you interest.\nLoans are taken out to pay for goods or services when a person does not have the cash to pay for the goods or services.\nWe are most familiar with loans for the big purchases in our lives, such as cars, homes, and a college education. Loans\nare also taken out to pay for repairs, smaller purchases, and home goods like furniture and computers.\nLoans can come from a bank, or from the company selling the goods or providing the service. The borrower agrees to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.8 \u2022 The Basics of Loans 631\npay back more than the amount borrowed. So there is a cost to borrowing that should be considered when deciding on a\npurchase bought with credit or a borrowed money.\nEven using a credit card is a form of a loan.\nEssentially, a loan can be obtained for just about any purchase, large or small, that has a cost beyond a person\u2019s cash on\nhand.\nThe Terminology of Loans\nThere are many words and acronyms that get used in relation to loans. A few are below.\nAPR is the annual percentage rate. It is the annual interest paid on the money that was borrowed. Theprincipalis the\ntotal amount of the loan, or that has been financed. Afixed interest rateloan has an interest rate that does not change\nduring the life of the loan. Avariable interest rateloan has an interest rate that may change during the life of the loan.\nThetermof the loan is how long the borrower has to pay the loan back. Aninstallment loanis a loan with a fixed\nperiod, and the borrower pays a fixed amount per period until the loan is paid off. The periods are almost uniformly\nmonthly.Loan amortizationis the process used to calculate how much of each payment will be applied to principal and\nhow much is applied to interest.Revolving credit, also known as open-end credit, is how most credit cards work but is\nalso a kind of loan account. (We will learn about credit cards inCredit Cards) You can use up to some specified value,\ncalled the limit, any way you want, and as long as you pay the issuer of the credit according to their terms, you can keep\nborrowing from this account.\nThese and other terminologies can be researched further atForbes(https://openstax.org/r/terminologies).\nWHO KNEW?\nCredit Scores\nNot everyone pays the same interest for the same loan. One person might get an APR of 2.9% while another pays\n6.9%. These rates are based on your credit score.\nData about you and your credit is collected by three credit bureaus\u2014Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. They\ncalculate your score using one of two main models: FICO and Vantage Score. The score they develop is based on the\nfollowing categories:\n\u2022 Payment History:Making your payments on time and not missing payments is by far the most important factor.\nAll three credit types\u2014revolving, installment, and open\u2014contribute to this factor.\n\u2022 Credit Utilization or Amount Owed:How much do you owe on your credit card accounts? This category is\nconcerned with the ratio of how much you owe on revolving credit accounts relative to your available credit, also\nknown as your credit utilization ratio.\nThis is the only category that depends solely on your revolving credit accounts.\n\u2022 Length of Credit History:This is the average age of your credit history, including the age of the oldest and\nnewest accounts. All three types of credit accounts play a role in this category.\n\u2022 Credit Mix:This number represents the different types of credit accounts you have, such as credit cards, car\nloan, mortgages, and whether you are successful managing both revolving and installment accounts.\n\u2022 New Credit:Have you recently opened a new account or applied for new credit? Lenders want to know how\nmuch new credit you are taking on. So, if you are planning to buy a car and make another large purchase with a\ncredit card, you may want to space these purchases out.\nIf you have done well in these categories, your credit score will be high, and you will qualify for lower interest rates\nbecause you are not perceived as being a risky investment. However, if you do poorly in these categories, your score\nwill be low and you will pay higher interest rates since you present a greater risk.\nCheck outthis nerdwallet article on credit scores(https://openstax.org/r/how_to_improve)to learn more!\nVIDEO\nCredit Scores Explained(https://openstax.org/r/credit_scores_explained) 632 6 \u2022 Money Management\nWHO KNEW?\nWhere Do Interest Rates Come From?\nThere are many factors that impact your interest rate beyond your credit score. Banks have the authority to set their\nown rates, so competition between banks impacts interest rates. Bank A doesn\u2019t want to charge interest rates that are\ntoo high, since borrowers will find banks with better rates. Banks also don\u2019t want to charge too little interest.\nThe too little interest is more involved than the too high. The bank needs to make a profit on its loans. Deposits at the\nbank are used by the bank to generate loans. The bank has to pay those depositors interest. The bank must charge\nmore for loans they give than they pay to people with deposits in the bank.\nBanks also borrow money from each other. These loans have an interest rate, and once more, the bank making a loan\nmust make a profit. More directly, they must charge more for loans they give than they pay for loans they take. In the\nUnited States, banks may also borrow from the Federal Reserve, which also charges an interest rate, which is also\ncalled the discount rate.\nThis is where a bank\u2019s prime rate comes from. A bank\u2019s prime rate is the interest rate it will give to its very best\ncustomers, which means most customers will pay more than the bank\u2019s prime rate. To confuse the issue, there is also\ntheWall StreetJournal\u2019s prime rate. It is the average of the prime rates charged by individual banks. TheWall Street\nJournalsurveys several banks to generate this value.\nBanks also increase the interest rate charged to customers based on both the credit risk presented by the customer,\nand the risk associate with what the loan will be used for.\nCalculating Loan Payments\nLoan payments are made up of two components. One component is the interest that accrued during the payment\nperiod. The other component is part of the principal. This should remind you of partial payments fromSimple Interest.\nOver the course of the loan, the amount of principal remaining to be paid decreases. The interest you pay in a month is\nbased on the remaining principal, just as in the partial payments ofSimple Interest.\nFORMULA\nThe amount of interest, , to be paid for one period of a loan with remaining principal is , where is the\ninterest rate in decimal form and is he number of payments in a year (most often = 12). Since the interest is for the\none period, the time is 1 and does not impact the calculation. Note, interest paid to lenders is always rounded up to\nthe next penny.\nEXAMPLE6.77\nInterest for a Monthly Payment of a Loan\nFind the interest to be paid for the period on loans with the following remaining principal and given annual interest rate.\nEach period is a month.\n1. Remaining principal is $13,450, interest rate is 6.75%\n2. Remaining principal is $8,460, interest rate is 5.99%\nSolution\n1. Substituting $13,450 for the remaining principal , 0.0675 for , and = 12 since the period is a month into the\nformula, we find that the interest to be paid this period is .\n2.

Each period is a month.\n1. Remaining principal is $56,945, interest rate is 7.5%\n2. Remaining principal is $25,850, interest rate is 2.9%\nThe payment of the loan has to be such that the principal of the loan is paid off with the last payment. In any period, the\namount of interest is defined by the formula above, but changes from period to period since the principal is decreasing\nwith each payment. The trick is knowing how much principal should be paid each payment so that the loan is paid off at\nthe stated time. Fortunately, that is found using the following formula.\nFORMULA\nThe payment, , per period to pay down a loan with beginning principal is , where\nis the annual interest rate in decimal form, is the number of years of the loan, and is the number of payments per\nyear (typically, loans are paid monthly making = 12).\nNote, payment to lenders is always rounded up to the next penny.\nOften, the formula takes the form , where is the interest rate per period (annual rate\ndivided by the number of periods per year), and is the total number of payments to be made.\nEXAMPLE6.78\nCalculating the Payment for a Loan\nIn the following, calculate the payment necessary to pay off the loan with the given details. The payments are monthly.\n1. A car loan taken out for $28,500 at an annual interest rate of 3.99% for 5 years.\n2. A home loan taken out for $136,700 and an annual interest rate of 5.75% for 15 years.\nSolution\n1. The loan is for $28,500, which is the principal. The rate is 3.99%, so = 0.0399. The term of the loan is 5 years, so\n=5. Monthly payments means = 12. Substituting these values for , , , and into the formula\nand calculating, we find the payment for the loan.\nThe monthly payment needed is $524.75.\n2. The loan is for $136,000, which is the principal . The rate is 5.75% so = 0.0575. The term of the loan is 15 years, so\n= 15. Monthly payments mean =12. Substituting these values for , , , and into the formula\nand calculating, we find the payment for the loan. 634 6 \u2022 Money Management\nThe monthly payment needed is $1,135.18.\nYOUR TURN6.78\nIn the following, calculate the payment necessary to pay off the loan with the given details.

A solar panel installation loan taken out for $33,760 and an annual interest rate of 4.3% for 20 years.\nTECH CHECK\nUsing Google Sheets to Calculate Loan Payments\nGoogle Sheets has a formula to calculate the monthly payment necessary to pay off a loan with a specified interest\nrate and term. The formula is the PMT formula. It uses the principal , interest rate , and years. Follow these steps\nOpen a Google worksheet and click on any cell.\nType =-PMT(r/12,12*t,P).\nHit the enter key.\nThe cell displays the payment.\nPlease note the negative sign. Since Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program, is sees the payment as funds leaving\nthe account, and so they are, by default, negative. The negative sign in front of the formula makes the result positive.\nFor example, for a $50,000 loan at 10.9% interest for 7 years, you would type =-PMT(0.109/12,12*7,50000). The\nformula and the result are shown inFigure 6.18.\nFigure6.18Google Sheets formula\nAlternatively, you can also use an online calculator to find monthly payments for a loan, such as the one at\nCaluculator.net(https://openstax.org/r/payment_calculator)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.8 \u2022 The Basics of Loans 635\nReading Amortization Tables\nAnamortization tableor amortization schedule is a table that provides the details of the periodic payments for a loan\nwhere the payments are applied to both the principal and the interest. The principal of the loan is paid down over the life\nof the loan. Typically, the payments each period are equal.

Summarize the standard prepayment plan.\n5. Understand student loan consolidation.\n6. Summarize and describe benefits or drawbacks of other repayment plans.\n7. Summarize possible courses of action if a student loan defaults.\nObtaining a Student Loan\nAll college students are eligible to apply for a loan regardless of their financial situation or credit rating. Federal student\nloans do not require a co-signer or a credit check. Most students do not have a credit history when they begin college,\nand the federal government is aware of this. However, private loans will generally require a co-signer as well as a credit\ncheck. The co-signer will assume responsibility for paying off the loan if the student cannot make the payments.\nThe first step in applying for student loans is to fill out theFAFSA(Free Application for Student Aid). FAFSA determines\nfinancial need and what type of loan the student is qualified to obtain. For students who are still dependents on their\nparent\u2019s taxes, the parents also fill out the FAFSA, as their wealth and income impacts what the dependent student is\neligible for. Students who cannot demonstrate financial need will also be helped by applying with FAFSA, as it will help\nguide them to the type of loan most appropriate. The FAFSA must be submitted each year.\nThe FAFSA deadline is the spring of the student\u2019s next academic year. The deadline is often in March. Do not allow\nthis deadline to pass.\nAs soon as an offer letter from the college is received, the student should start the application process. The college will\ndetermine the loan amount needed. Also, there are limits on the amount a student can borrow. There are both yearly\nlimits and aggregate limits. See the table later in this section that outlines the loan limits per school year and in the\naggregate.\nIf the student receives a direct subsidized loan, there is a limit on the eligibility period. The time limit on eligibility\ndepends on the college program into which the student enrolls. The school publishes how long a program is expected to\ntake. The eligibility period is 150% of that published time. For example, if a student is enrolled in a 4-year program, such\nas a bachelor\u2019s degree program, their eligibility period is 6 years, as 1.50(4) = 6. Therefore, the student may receive direct 646 6 \u2022 Money Management\nsubsidized loans for a period of 6 years.\nTypes and Features of Student Loans\nOnce a tuition statement is received, and all the non-loan awards are analyzed that are applicable to the costs of college\n(such as scholarships and grants), there still may be quite of bit of an expense to attend college. This difference between\nwhat college will cost (including tuition, room and board, books, computers) and the non-loan awards received is the\ncollege funding gap.\nEXAMPLE6.81\nCollege Funding Gap\nIshraq receives her award and tuition letter from the college she wants to attend. Her tuition, fees, books, and room and\nboard all come to $24,845 for the year. Her non-loan awards include an instant scholarship from the school for $7,500, a\nscholarship she earned for enrolling in a STEM program for $3,750, and a $1,000 scholarship from her church.

His tuition, fees, books, and\nroom and board all come to $34,845 for the year. His non-loan awards include an instant scholarship from the\nschool for $17,500, three scholarships he earned from sources he found online, which total $5,600, and a $2,000\nscholarship from his employer. What is Yuan-Teng\u2019s college funding gap?\nThere are several loan types, which basically break down into four broad categories: subsidized loans, unsubsidized\nloans, PLUS loans, and private loans. These loans are meant to fill the college funding gap.\nFederalsubsidized loansare backed by the U.S. Department of Education. These loans are intended for undergraduate\nstudents who can demonstrate financial need. Subsidized federal loans, including Stafford loans, defer payments until\nthe student has graduated. During the deferment, the government pays the interest while the student is enrolled at\nleast half-time. These loans are generally made directly to students. However, there are restrictions on how the money\ncan be used. It can only be used for tuition, room and board, computers, books, fees, and college-related expenses.\nInterest rates are not based on the financial markets but determined by Congress. Federal loans are backed by the\nDepartment of Education.\nFederalunsubsidized loans, including unsubsidized Stafford loans, are available for undergraduate and graduate\nstudents who cannot demonstrate financial need. If the student meets the program requirements, they are\nautomatically approved. The student is not required to pay these loans during their time in college (enrolled at least half-\ntime). However, the interest rate is generally higher and there is no deferment period, as with subsidized loans. Interest\nbegins accruing as soon as the money is disbursed.\nThe immediate accrual of interest means the balance of the loan grows as the student attends school. A loan that\nwas for $10,000 can grow past $13,000 over five years of college. Some advisors tell students to pay the interest\nportion of the loan while it is deferred to prevent this growth of debt.\nParent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS)are federal loans made directly to parents. They are available even if\nparents are not deemed financially needy. A credit check is performed and approval is not automatic. The limit to what\nparents can borrow from a PLUS loan each year is still the college funding gap, but the aggregate of the PLUS loans does\nnot have a limit. This means the PLUS loan can cover whatever is left in the funding gap once all other aid and loans are\napplied. Payments do not begin until the student is out of school, but interest begins to accrue the moment funds are\ndisbursed. Because the parents take out the loan, the parents are responsible for paying back the loan.\nPrivate student loansare backed by a bank or credit institution and require a credit check, and interest rates are\nvariable. As private loans are not subsidized by the government, no one pays the interest but the borrower. The student\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.9 \u2022 Understanding Student Loans 647\ndoes not have to start repaying the loan until after graduation, but interest starts to accrue immediately. This loan has\nfewer repayment options, more fees and penalties, and the loan cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. Many\nstudents need a co-signer to acquire a private loan. Like PLUS loans, private student loans can cover whatever is left in\nthe funding gap once all other aid and loans are applied\nStudent loans, in general, have a term of 10 years, that is, the loans are paid back over 10 years. This can vary, but 10\nyears is the standard.\nWHO KNEW?\nSchool-Channel Loans and Direct-to-Consumer Loans\nPrivate loans can fall into one of two categories: school-channel loans and direct to consumer loans.School-channel\nloansare disbursed directly to the school. The school verifies the loan does not exceed the cost to attend school.\nDirect\u2013to-consumer loansdo not have the verification process. Those proceeds are sent directly to the borrower.\nThey are processed more quickly, but often have higher interest rates.\nVIDEO\nTypes of Student Loans(https://openstax.org/r/Student_Loans)\nLimits on Student Loans\nAs mentioned earlier, there are limits to how much a student can borrow, per year and in total. The following table shows\na general breakdown of the amounts the federal government and private lenders will lend. Amounts are based on level\nof need and whether the student is a dependent or an independent student. Independent students include those who\nare at least 24 years old, married, a professional, a graduate student, a veteran, a member of the armed forces, an\nemancipated minor, or an orphan. The amounts shown are as of this writing in 2022.\nDependent Students\nYear Independent Students Maximum Amounts\nMaximum Amounts\nFirst-Year $5,500 but no more than $9,500 but no more than $3,500 may be in subsidized loans\nUndergraduate $3,500 may be in\nsubsidized loans\nSecond-Year $6,500 but no more than $10,500 but no more than $4,500 in subsidized loans\nUndergraduate $4,500 may be\nsubsidized loans\nThird Year and $7,500 but no more than $12,500 but no more than $5,500 may be in subsidized loans\nAdditional $5,500 may be in\nYears subsidized loans\nGraduate and Not applicable $20,500 in unsubsidized loans\nProfessional\nLimits $31,000 but no more $57,500 for undergraduates but no more than $23,000 in subsidized.\nthan $23,000 in $138,500 for graduate or professional but no more than $65,500 may\nsubsidized loans be subsidized loans.\nCheck out thisEdvisors page on the limits of student borrowing(https://openstax.org/r/loan_limits)to learn more! 648 6 \u2022 Money Management\nEXAMPLE6.82\nLoan for Year 5 of College\nEfraim is a dependent undergraduate student enrolled in a biology program.

Students will pay them back and will pay interest. In the fall of 2022, the\nfederal student loan interest rate was 4.99%. Private student loans rates ranged between 3.22% and 13.95%. Finding the\nlowest interest rate you can helps with the payments, and especially helps if the loan is not federally subsidized.\nRemember, if the loan is not federally subsidized, the student is on the hook for the interest that is accumulating with the\nloan.\nInterest Accrual\nThe interest on student loans begins as soon as the loan is disbursed (paid to the borrower). When the loan is federally\nsubsidized, the government pays that interest for the student. This means the loan for a subsidized loan of $3,000 is still\na loan for $3,000 when the student graduates. However, if the loan is not federally subsidized, the student is responsible\nfor the interest that accrues on the loan. The $3,000 loan from year 1 of college is now a loan for more due to that added\ninterest. The interest on that loan grew while the student was in college. The formula for growth of the loan\u2019s balance is\nthe same as compound interest formula fromCompound Interest, .\nEXAMPLE6.84\nDenise takes out unsubsidized student loan, in August, in her first year of college for $2,000.

What is the balance of her first year loan in May of her graduation year?\nSolution\nThe principal of the loan is $2,000. Her interest rate is 8%. Since student loans are typically paid monthly, there are 12\nperiods per year. Since the time she has had the loan is not in years, we will use the number of months for the value of\nin the formula. She has had the loan for 4 years and 9 months, meaning 57 period have passed. Substituting those\nvalues into the formula and calculating, we find her balance in May of her graduating year is\n.\nYOUR TURN6.84\n1.

She does not pay the interest on the\nloan during her time in college. What is the balance of her first year loan in May of her graduation year?\nThe Standard Repayment Plan\nThere are various repayment plans available. The one most likely to apply to a student loan is thestandard repayment\nplan,which is available to everyone. Borrowers pay a fixed amount monthly so the loan is paid in full within 10 years.\nConsolidated loans, discussed later in this section, also qualify for the standard repayment plan, and may allow the\npayoff period to range from 10 to 30 years. Direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, PLUS loans, and federal Stafford\nloans are eligible.\nSince these are loans, they are paid back with interest. As with most installment loans, their payments are due monthly.\nThe formula for paying back these loans is the same as the formula used for paying loans inThe Basics of Loans:\n.\nUsing that formula, we can calculate how much the payment is for a student loan. Remember that all loan payments are\nrounded up to the next penny.\nEXAMPLE6.85\nStandard Repayment Plan\nFind the payment for the following student loans using the standard repayment plan: 650 6 \u2022 Money Management\n1.

The interest rate on the loan is 6.7%.\nHow much are her payments if she pays it off in the standard of 10 years?\nStudent Loan Consolidation\nWhen a student graduates, they may have multiple different student loans. Keeping track of them and paying them off\nseparately can be a burden. Instead, these loans can be consolidated into a single loan. If they are federal loans the\ncombination is calledfederal consolidation.Combining private loans is often referred to asrefinancing.Refinancing,\norprivate consolidation,can be used to combine both private and federal student loans. Be aware that consolidated\nfederal loans may still be subject to the rules and protections that govern subsidized loans. Refinancing loans, private or\nfederal, are no longer subject to those rules and guidelines. Check out thisExperian article about consolidation and\nrefinancing(https://openstax.org/r/my_student_loans)for more deatil.\nIn consolidation of federal direct student loans, the interest rate is the weighted average of the interest rates on the\nsubsidized loans. This means the interest rate remains the same. However, if the term is extended, then the student will\npay back more over time than if they did not extend the loan term.\nIn refinancing, it is possible to obtain a lower interest rate on the student loans, which may lower how much is paid per\nmonth and lower the total paid back over time. These monthly payments are calculated using the same formula as for\nany other loan payment, . The term of the refinanced loan may also be changed, which\nwould also impact the payment per month.\nIn either case, consolidating or refinancing, the monthly financial burden on the student can decrease. However, if the\nterm is extended, the total amount repaid may increase.\nEXAMPLE6.87\nFederal Loan Consolidation and Interest Rates\nErnest has four federal student loans that he wants to consolidate.

Brian consolidates his federal student loans into one loan at 4.99%. The consolidated balance is $20,340, and he\nextends the term to 12 years. What are Brian\u2019s monthly payments for the consolidated loan?\nOther Repayment Plans\nThere are various other repayment plans available to students. Plans other than the standard repayment plan typically\nrequire the student to meet certain criteria. The following plans are independent of student income, but may make early\npayments easier.\n\u2022 Graduated repayment plansare plans where the amount of payments gradually increases so that the loan is paid\noff in 10 years, or within 10 to 30 years for consolidated loans. Payments start off small and increase approximately\nevery 2 years. Almost all loan types are eligible, including direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, Stafford loans,\nPLUS loans, and consolidated loans.\n\u2022 Extended repayment plansare available to the direct loan borrower if the outstanding direct loans are over\n$30,000. The payments, fixed or graduated, are designed so that the loans are satisfied within 25 years. Eligible\nloans include both direct subsidized or unsubsidized loans, Stafford loans, PLUS loans, and consolidated loans.\nIf student earnings are such that the standard, graduated, or extended repayment plans are unaffordable, then one can\nmake payments that are based on theirdiscretionary income.Discretionary income is federally defined to be the\ndifference between (adjusted) gross income and 150% of the poverty guideline for location and family size. This\ndiscretionary income then depends on where one lives (contiguous United States or Hawaii or Alaska) and how many\ndependents one has. If married, a spouse\u2019s income will be included in the adjusted gross income. Understanding\ndiscretionary income is necessary to understand how income driven payments plans work.\nEXAMPLE6.89\nDiscretionary Income\n1.

If Jamie lives in a two-person household\nand has a gross income of $36,900, what is his discretionary income?\nThe following plans all depend on discretionary income.\n\u2022 Pay As You Earn (PAYE) repayment planshave monthly payments that are 10% of discretionary income based on a\nstudent\u2019s updated income and family size. If a borrower files a joint tax return, their spouse\u2019s income and debt may\nalso be considered. Eligible loans include direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, PLUS loans made to students,\nand some consolidated loans. These loans are forgiven (student does not pay the remaining balance) after 20 years\nof monthly payments if they were direct federal student loans.\n\u2022 Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) repayment planshave payment amounts that are based on income and family\nsize and calculated as 10% of discretionary income. Eligible loans include direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans,\ndirect PLUS loans, and some consolidated loans. These loans are forgiven, that is, the student does not pay more,\nafter 20 or 25 years, provided they were direct federal student loans.\n\u2022 Income-Based Repayment (IBR) planssound like a few of the others and there are similarities in all of them. The\npayments are either 10% or 15% of discretionary income, but this plan is meant for those with a relatively high debt.\nEvery year, income and family size must be updated, and payments are calculated based on those figures. Eligible\nloans include direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans, Stafford loans, and PLUS loans made to students, but not\nPLUS loans made to parents.\n\u2022 Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) planshave payments that are either 20% of discretionary income or\nwhatever would be paid if a student were on a fixed payment plan for more than 12 years, whichever is less.

However, if there is no forgiveness at the end of the loan,\nthen the income driven payment plans can cause problems. For one, your payment may not be sufficient to cover the\ninterest rate of your loans. In that case, your loan balance actuallyincreasesas you make your payments. Eventually, you\nare paying for not only your original loan balance, but interest that has been growing and compounding over time. Also,\nif the loan term is extended, you may pay more, perhaps a lot more, money over time. You may find yourself in the\nposition of paying these loans for decades.\nWith those possible drawbacks, great care must be taken to avoid large problems down the line.\nVIDEO\nRepayment Plans(https://openstax.org/r/student_loan_repayment_plans)\nStudent Loan Default and Consequences\nThe first day a payment is late, the account becomesdelinquent. After 90 days, this delinquency is reported to the credit\nbureaus, and goes intodefault.This is serious, as now a credit score is affected, meaning that it will be harder to buy a\ncar, a home, get a credit card, or a cell phone. Even renting an apartment may be a task not easily overcome. The default\nrate for students who do not complete their degree is three times higher than for students who do.\nFurther, defaulting on a student loan may mean that the borrower loses eligibility for repayment plans, as the balance\nand any unpaid interest may become due immediately, and any tax refunds may be withheld and applied to the loan,\nand wages may be garnished. One should immediately contact your loan servicer and try to make other arrangements\nfor repayment if this situation becomes apparent, as different repayment plans are available, if actions are taken quickly.\nThere are several options that may be open to avoid defaulting. One is calledrehabilitation,or is the process in which a\nborrower may bring a student loan out of default by adhering to specified repayment requirements, and the other is\nconsolidation.

(credit: \"Credit Cards\" by Sean MacEntee/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Apply for a credit card armed with basic knowledge.\n2. Distinguish between three basic types of credit cards.\n3. Compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of credit cards.\n4. Read and understand the basic parts of a credit card statement.\n5. Compute interest, balance due, and minimum payment due for a credit card.\nIt can be difficult to get along these days without at least one credit card. Most hotels and rental car agencies require\nthat a credit card is used. There are even a number of retailers and restaurants that no longer accept cash. They make\nonline purchasing easier. And nothing contributes more to a good credit rating than a solid history of making credit card\npayments on time.\nBeing granted a credits card is a privilege. Used unwisely that privilege can become a curse and the privilege may be\nwithdrawn. In this section, we will talk about the different types of credit cards and their advantages and disadvantages.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.10 \u2022 Credit Cards 657\nThe more knowledge a cardholder has about the credit card industry, the better able credit accounts can be managed,\nand that knowledge may cause major adjustments to a cardholder\u2019s lifestyle.\nAll credit cards are not equal, but they all represent consumers borrowing money, usually from a bank, to pay for needs\nand \u201cwants.\u201d As such, they are a type of loan, and your repayment may include interest. (You might want to review\nSection 6.8, which discusses loans and repayment plans.)\nThere are many institutions and credit cards to choose from. Use caution as you shop around for a credit card that suits\nyou. Your top concern is likely the interest rates on purchases and cash advances. But be careful to also read the small\nprint regarding charges for late payments, and other fees such as anannual fee,where the credit card charges you (the\ncardholder) a fee each year for the privilege of using the cards. Many cards charge no such fee, but there are many that\ncharge modest to heavy fees. Make sure to understand rules forreward programs, where the credit card issuer grants\nbenefits based on one\u2019s spending. Finally, once one applies for and is granted a credit card, pay attention to thecredit\nlimitthe bank offers. Once a company is owed that much money, use of the card for purchases should be curtailed until\nsome of the debt is paid off.\nThe interest rate will not matter if the balance is paid every month. When the balance is paid every month, there is\nNO INTEREST charged.\nTypes of Credit Cards\nThere are basically three types of credit cards: bank-issued credit cards, store-issued credit cards, and travel/\nentertainment credit cards. We will look at all three and explain the good and the bad qualities of each.\nBank-Issued Credit Cards\nPerhaps the most widely used credit card type is thebank-issued credit card, like Visa or MasterCard (and even\nAmerican Express and Discover cards). These types of cards are an example of revolving credit, meaning that additional\ncredit is extended before the previous balance is paid\u2014but only up to the assigned credit limit. Bank-issued cards are\nconsidered the most convenient, as they can be used to purchase anything, including apparel, furniture, groceries, fuel\nfor automobiles, meals, hotel bills, and so on, just as if paying with cash. The interest rates on bank-issued credit cards\nare usually lower than those for other credit cards we\u2019ll discuss, and the credit limits are generally higher. Currently,\nbank-issued cards have an average 20.09% APR.\nStore-Issued Credit Cards\nStore-issued credit cardsare issued by retailers. One can hardly walk into a store these days without being offered a\ndiscount on purchases if one applies for the store credit card. These cards can only be used in that store or family of\nstores that issues the card. However, if a store credit card is associated with Visa, MasterCard, or American Express, then\nthe card might be used the same way that the bank-issued cards are used. This is called cobranding. The logo of the\nbank-issued card will be present on the store card. Many stores offer both types. Like other credit cards, they may come\nwith an annual fee.\nStore credit cards usually charge higher interest rates than bank-issued cards. Currently, store credit cards have an APR\n(annual percentage rate) of 24.15%. Any rewards offered by store credit cards are usually limited to purchases made in\ntheir own store, and it typically takes longer to accumulate enough rewards or points to redeem them, whereas\ncobranded credit cards offer opportunities to earn rewards on all purchases, regardless of whether purchases are made\nin the issuing store or not.\nStore credit cards usually offer lower credit limits, at least in the beginning. After being proved to be a responsible credit\ncard owner, credit limits can be raised. Nevertheless, store credit cards are a good choice for those new to the credit card\nindustry. If on-time payments are consistently made, it is an excellent way to get started building a credit history.\nTravel/Entertainment Cards, or Charge Cards\nThis is the third type of credit card. Thetravel and entertainment cards,also known ascharge cards,first and\nforemost offer very high limits or unlimited credit, but they must be paid in full every month. They generally charge high\nannual fees and impose expensive penalties should a payment be late. On the other hand, they typically have longer\ngrace periods and offer many and various kinds of rewards.\nCheck out thisnerdwallet article about the differences between a charge card and a credit card(https://openstax.org/r/\ncards_charge_cards).\nAn interest rate will greatly depend on credit score. Responsible use of credit cards will increase a credit score. See 658 6 \u2022 Money Management\nthe WHO KNEW? fromThe Basics of Loans.\nVIDEO\nChoosing a Credit Card(https://openstax.org/r/Credit_Card)\nWHO KNEW?\nTop Travel and Entertainment Cards\nAt one time, Diner\u2019s Club was the premier entertainment card. To be accepted into the Diner\u2019s Club and be rewarded\nwith a charge card meant one was special. Today, an American Express card is held with the same reverence as\nDiner\u2019s Club was in the past. It was a privilege to own one of these cards. There is a lot of competition going on to\nsupplant Diner\u2019s Club, as shown by theChase Sapphire Preferred Card\u2019s(https://openstax.org/r/Chase_Sapphire)\ntravel rewards and benefits.\nAnother thing worth mentioning here and something that appears to be an unusual offering is part of the American\nExpress Gold and higher-level cards. Cardholders can actually open a savings account, buy a CD, or apply for a\npersonal or business loan from American Express. The company boasts a higher interest rate than what is paid on\ntraditional savings accounts and CDs.\nEXAMPLE6.91\nComparing Credit Cards\n1. Which type of credit card is paid off every month so has no interest to be paid, but comes with high fees?\n2. Which type of credit cards are the most widely accepted?\n3. Which type of credit cards are the most limited?\nSolution\n1. Charge cards are to be paid off completely each month.\n2. Bank-issued credit cards are the most flexible to use, because they are not limited to which retailers or service\nproviders accept them.\n3. Store issues credit cards are the most limited, since they only work in that family of stores.\nYOUR TURN6.91\n1. Which type of credit card typically have the highest interest rates?\n2. What should be considered other than interest rate when selecting a card?\n3. Which type of cards typically have high annual fees?\nCredit Card Statements\nCardholders usually receive monthly statements and have 21 days to pay the minimum amount due. The statements\nitemize and summarize activity on the credit card for that statement\u2019sbilling period. The billing period for a credit card\nis generally a month long, but typically does not start and end on the first and last days of the month. The statement will\ninclude the current balance, interest rate, the minimum payment due, and the due date. Be aware, different companies\nproduce statements that are laid out differently. The information will be clearly labeled though.\nThe due date is a top concern. Missing a due date is one of the worst things a cardholder can do financially, and this is by\nfar the biggest downfall of owning a credit card. Not only is the cardholder subject to late fees, but when a payment is\nlate more than once there is a high probability that the cardholder will be negatively reported to the credit bureaus,\nwhich can quickly erode a credit score.Figure 6.23shows an excerpt from an actual statement from a Chase Bank Visa\ncard, based on the current $668.25 balance.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.10 \u2022 Credit Cards 659\nFigure6.23Credit card statement\nSpecifically pay attention to the late payment penalty and minimum payment warning statements. stating that if no\nother purchases are made and you continue making only the minimum payment, it will take 19 months to pay off the\nbalance and you will pay $754.00. You can\u2019t say you were not warned.\nIt is critical that you examine your statement every month because it is always a possibility that your account may have\nbeen compromised. If you should notice fraudulent charges on your statement, notifying the credit card company is\noften enough to have those charges researched by the company and removed. The card with the fraudulent charges will\nbe canceled and a new card with a new account number will be sent to you.\nEXAMPLE6.92\nReading a Credit Card Statement\nOn the credit card statementFigure 6.24, identify\n1.

One process to find that average daily balance follows these steps:\n1. Start with a list of transactions with their dates and amounts.\n2. For each day that had transactions, find the total of the transactions for the day. Expenditures are treated as positive\nvalues, payments are treated as negative values.\n3. Create a table containing each day with a different balance. The balance is the previous balance plus the day\u2019s total\ntransactions.\n4. Add a column for the number of days those balances until the balance changed.\n5. Add a column that contains the balances multiplied by the number of days until the balance changed.\n6. Find the sum of that last column.\n7. Divide the sum by the number of days in the billing period (often the number of days in the month). This is the\naverage daily balance.\nEXAMPLE6.93\nComputing Average Daily Balance\nThe billing cycle goes from May 1 to May 31. The balance at the start of the billing cycle is $450.21. The list of\ntransactions on the card is below.\nDate Activity Amount\n1-May Billing Date Balance $450.21\n10-May Payment $120.00\n15-May Groceries $83.43\n26-May Auto Parts $45.12\n26-May Restaurant $85.34\n30-May Shoes $98.23\nFind the average daily balance for the credit card during the month of May. 662 6 \u2022 Money Management\nSolution\nTo find the average daily balance, we use the following steps.\n1. Start with a list of transactions with their dates and amounts.\nThis list is provided.\n2. For each day that had transactions, find the total of the transactions for the day.\nThe only day with more than one transaction was May 26. The sum of those transactions is $130.46. Treating the\npayment as a negative value, the daily transaction amounts are\nDate Amount\n1-May $450.21\n10-May -$120.00\n15-May $83.43\n26-May $130.46\n30-May $98.23\n3. Create a table containing each day with a different balance.\nThe new table with dates that had different balances is below.\nDate Balance\n1-May $450.21\n10-May $330.21\n15-May $413.64\n26-May $544.10\n30-May $642.33\n4. Now, add a column for the number of days those balances until the balance changed. The days until the balance\nchanges is found by finding the difference in the dates. For instance, from May 15 to May 26 was 11. Adding that\ncolumn to the table we have\nDate Balance Days Until Balance Changes\n1-May $450.21 9\n10-May $330.21 5\n15-May $413.64 11\n26-May $544.10 4\n30-May $642.33 2\nThe last entry was 2 since there are 31 days in May.\n5.

ADB = $6,803.41, annual interest rate 14.9%, billing cycle of 28 days\nWHO KNEW?\nCredit Cards Charge Stores Fees\nThe interest you pay is not the only way a credit card company generates revenue. It also charges fees to the retailers,\nonline stores, and service providers that allow the consumer, you, to use your credit card to pay them. These are\ncalled processing fees. Currently they typically range from 2.87% to 4.35% of each transaction. That means if you use\nyour credit card at a store and spend $100.00, the store will have to pay the credit card company somewhere between\n$2.87 and $4.35.\nOne type of processing fee is the interchange fee. Mastercard charges the vendor 1.35% of the sale, plus an\nadditional percentage up to 3.25%, and a fixed $001 fee for each transaction.\nAdded to that is an assessment fee. This fee is 0.14% for Visa cards.\nCalculating the Balance of a Credit Card\nThebalance,or sometimes balance due, on a credit card is the previous balance, plus all expenses, minus all payments\nand credits, plus the interest on the card. As stated before, if the card was paid off, there is no interest to be paid.\nEXAMPLE6.95\nCalculating the Balance of a Credit Card\nFind the balance on the credit card with the given interest charge and balance before interest was charged.

The calculations for this may differ from card to card. They also depend in the balance\nof the credit card. General guidelines for minimum payment due are:\n\u2022 For larger balances (usually over $1,000), the minimum payment will be some percentage of the balance due.\n\u2022 For moderate balances (between $25 and $1,000), the minimum would be a specified dollar amount. $25 seems to\nbe a common value.\n\u2022 If the balance is small (under $25 for instance), then the minimum payment is the balance.\nThose are just guidelines. Individual cards may vary in these values.\nMinimum payments should only be paid if money is short in a given month. The length of time to pay off a credit card\nusing minimum payments is quite long, and results in paying a lot of interest. It is strongly discouraged.\nEXAMPLE6.97\nCalculate the Minimum Payment Due\nThe FYA credit card company has the following minimum payment policy. For balances over $1,000, the minimum\npayment is 2.5% of the balance due plus fees, but not interest. For balances between $500.00 and $999.99, the minimum\npayment is $50.00.

Investigate the types of car insurance.\n6. Solve application problems involving owning and maintaining a car.\nThere are people who don\u2019t need a car and won\u2019t purchase one. But for many people, whether or not to have a car is not\na question. Having a car is a basic necessity for these people.\nObtaining a car can be daunting. The models, the features, the additional costs, and finding funding are all steps that\nneed to be taken. One of the big decisions is whether to buy the car or to lease the car. This section will address some of\nthe issues associated with each option.\nThe Basics of Car Purchasing\nThe biggest questions you will answer before purchasing a car are, what do you want and what do you need?\nDoes it have to be new? Does it have to be a make and model you are familiar with? Does it have to have assisted\ndriving? What other details are important to you? For a new vehicle, every feature beyond standard features comes with\nadditional cost, which leads to the question that constrains all of your decisions about a car. How much can you afford to\nspend on a car?\nWhat you can afford must include insurance costs (discussed later in this section) and maintenance and upkeep. Once\nyou have this in mind, you can search for a car that matches, as closely as possible, what you want and can afford. Most,\nif not all, dealers have websites that you can search through to identify the car you want. If new cars are not affordable,\nused cars cost less but come with the wear and tear of use. 676 6 \u2022 Money Management\nThe sticker price of the car, called the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP), or the negotiated price you arrive at,\nisn\u2019t the end of the cost to buying a car. There are many fees that accompany the purchase of the car, and perhaps even\nsales tax. These include but aren\u2019t necessarily limited to the following:\n\u2022 thetitle and registration fee, which includes registering your car with the state, getting the license plate, and\nassigning the title of the car to the lender. This cannot be avoided.\n\u2022 adestination fee, which covers the cost of delivering the vehicle to the dealer\n\u2022 adocumentation fee, sometimes referred to a processing fee of handling fee, is the cost of all the paperwork the\ndealer did to get you the car\n\u2022 adealer preparation fee, which is for washing the car and other preparation of that sort. You should try to\nnegotiate that out of the cost of the dealer tries to charge for that\n\u2022 extended warrantiesand maintenance plans, which help cover some of the costs of caring for the car.\n\u2022 Sales tax.\nYou could pay for these immediately, but they are often added to the financing of the car, meaning they become part of\nthe principal of your loan.\nEXAMPLE6.98\nTotal Cost to Purchase a Car\nNichole negotiates with her car dealership so that the price is $21,800. She needs to pay the 6.75% sales tax on the car.\nOther fees are $31.00 for title and registration, $1,000 in destination fees, and a documentation fee of $175. What is the\ntotal cost of Nichole\u2019s car?\nSolution\nWe add the car\u2019s sales cost, sales tax and all other fees to arrive at this value. The sales tax is 6.75% on the price she\nnegotiated, so is . Adding these up, we have a total cost of\n.\nYOUR TURN6.98\n1. Luther negotiates for the price of his car, reaching agreement at $28,975. He needs to pay 8% in sales tax, 2.1%\nin ownership tax, a $950 destination fee, processing fees totaling $370, and registration fee of $617. What is the\ntotal cost for Luther\u2019s purchase?\nOne way to bring down payments on a car is to provide adown paymentor a trade in. This is money applied to the\npurchase price before financing happens. Be warned, the sales tax applies to the full purchase price! If you reduce the\namount financed, the payments respond by going down. This often becomes part of the negotiating process.\nEXAMPLE6.99\nTotal Cost to Purchase a Car with Down Payment\nSophia negotiates a $19,800 price for her new car. The sales tax is 9.5% in her area, and the dealership charges her $300\nin documentation fees. Her title, plates, and registration come to $321.50. The dealership adds to this a destination fee\nof $1,100. If she places a down payment of $5,000 on the car, what is the total she will finance for the car?\nSolution\nThe price was $19,800. The sales tax of 9.5% is based on this number. The sales tax comes to .\nAdding all the fees to the price and the sales tax brings the total cost of the car to\n. Her down payment is applied to this number, so the $5,000\nis subtracted from $23,402.50. The subtraction yields the amount to be financed, which is $18,402.50.\nYOUR TURN6.99\n1. Carlos buys a car with a negotiated price of $36,250. The sales tax in his region is 6.5%. The dealer charges a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.11 \u2022 Buying or Leasing a Car 677\n$1,200 destination fee and a $450 documentation fee. He must pay for title, registration, and license plates,\nwhich come to $21.50. If he has a $7,500 down payment, how much will he have to finance?\nWhen purchasing a car, the total cost to obtain the car is not the only factor in your monthly price. You will also pay an\ninterest rate for the loan you obtain. The interest rate you will get is dependent on your credit score (seeThe Basics of\nLoans). But you can choose from different lenders. The dealership will likely offer to finance your car loan. Frequently,\ndealerships offer special financing with very low rates. This is to help move inventory, and may indicate their desire to\nmake sales. This might make negotiating easier. Even if the dealership offers financing, check with your bank or credit\nunion to determine the interest rates they are offering. To reduce your payments, choose the lowest rate you can find.\nPurchase Payments and Interest\nWhether or not you buy a new car or a used car, if you finance the purchase, you are taking out a loan. The interest rates\navailable for used cards are frequently higher than those for new cars. These loan payments work exactly the same way\nas other loans do as far as payments are concerned. The payment function comes fromThe Basics of Loans. The\ndifference between financing a new car or a used car is that financing a new car typically comes with a lower interest rate\nand a longer term that financing a used car.\nFORMULA\nThe payment, , per period to pay off a loan with beginning principal is , where is\nthe annual interest rate in decimal form, is the term in years, and is the number of payments per year (typically,\nloans are paid monthly making = 12).\nNote, payment to lenders is always rounded up to the next penny.\nOften, the formula takes the form , where is the interest rate per period (annual rate\ndivided by the number of periods per year), and is the total number of payments to be made.\nEXAMPLE6.100\nNew Car Payments\nIn the following, calculate the monthly payment using the given total to be financed, the interest rate, and the term of\nthe car loan.\n1. Total to be financed is $31,885, interest rate is 2.9%, for 5 years.\n2. Total to be financed is $22,778, interest rate is 4.5%, for 6 years.\nSolution\n1.

Calculate the monthly payment for a car loan that has $21,845 being financed at an interest rate of 6.3% for 4\nyears.\nThe Basics of Leasing a Car\nLeasing a car is an alternative to purchasing a car. It is still a loan, and acts like one in many respects. They typically last\neither 24 months or 36 months, though other terms are available. Leases also come with mileage limits, frequently\n10,000, 12,000, or 15,000 miles per year. When the lease is over, the car is returned to the dealer. At that time there may\nbe fees that have to be paid, such as for damage to the car or for extra miles driven over the limit.\nThere are two components to lease costs. One is the monthly payment for the lease. The other is the fees for leasing,\nThese often are paid before the lease is complete. These include:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.11 \u2022 Buying or Leasing a Car 679\n\u2022 a down payment, which is your initial payment that is applied to the price of the car. It reduces the amount you\nfinance, much the same as when you purchase a car. It is recommended that this be negotiated away.\n\u2022 theacquisition fee, sometimes called the bank fee. This is the money charge for the company to set up the lease. It\nis essentially a paperwork fee. It is not likely that this can be negotiated.\n\u2022 asecurity deposit, which might be required. It is about the same as 1 month\u2019s payment for the lease. The deposit is\nreturned to you if the car is in good shape at the end. This can be negotiated away.\n\u2022 disposition fees, which cover the cost the company will incur when they take your car back and are typically\nbetween $200 and $450.\n\u2022 the title, registration, and license fees, just as with the purchase of a car.\n\u2022 sales tax, which will likely be applied. The sales tax only covers the depreciated portion of the car (more on\ndepreciation later) in many states. Since this depends on the state in which the car is leased, you should determine\nthe sales tax rules for where you lease the car.\nAs you can imagine, this can come to a fairly high dollar amount.\nEXAMPLE6.102\nCost to Obtain a Lease\nDonna wants to lease a Subaru Outback in Eden, New York. Find the total cost of obtaining her lease if there is no down\npayment, $175.00 in acquisition fees, a security deposit of $300.00, $350.00 in disposition fees, $102.50 in title and\nregistration fees, and sales tax of $3,536.05.\nSolution\nAdding these values together we find the total cost is $4,463.55.\nYOUR TURN6.102\n1. RJ wants to lease a Tahoe in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Their company\nleased automobiles to corporations. They began by leasing 5 cars to the Petrolager pharmaceutical company in year\none. This saved Petrolager money and provided a steady cash flow to the Four Wheels business. In year two, the\nnumber of cars leased to Petrolager was 75. Their new idea was to lease cars directly to companies for one year.\nPreviously, such companies might pay for mileage, gas, and a partial down payment. Sadly, the salesmen who were\nbeing so helped often left the company before the car was paid for, and so the company lost the down payment\nmoney.\nThe lease was for $45 per month per car for one year.\nYou have some obligations when you lease a car. You must keep the car in good condition, cleaned, maintained, and free\nof anything more than minor damage. If the car is in poor condition when the car is returned, you will be responsible for\nthe cost to bring the car to an acceptable condition. You are also expected to keep the mileage under its limit. If you go\nover, you will pay 10 to 25 cents per mile over.\nLease Payments\nLease payments are similar to regular loan payments, but have some other details. Calculating a lease payment involves\nknowing the following values:\n\u2022 The price of the car.This is the cost you would pay for the car after applying all discounts, incentives, and 680 6 \u2022 Money Management\nnegotiations.\n\u2022 Residual Value.This is the manufacturer's estimate of the car's value after a set period of time. The residual value is\nexpressed as a percentage of the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP).\n\u2022 Months.This is the length of the lease. Most leases are either 24- or 36-month leases, but other terms are available.\n\u2022 Monthly Depreciation. The monthly depreciation is the difference between the price of the car and the residual\nvalue, divided by the number of months of the lease, and represents the monthly loss of value of the car while it\u2019s\nbeing used.\n\u2022 Money Factor (MF).This is the interest rate, but expressed in a different way for a lease. Converting from the\nmoney factor to the annual percentage rate (APR) is done by multiplying the MF by 2400. Naturally, converting an\nAPR to a MF is done by dividing the APR by 2400.\nFORMULA\nThe monthly depreciation for a car, MD, is , is the price paid for the car, is the residual value of the car,\nand is the number of months of the lease.\nThe annual percentage rate for a lease is , where MF is the money factor of the lease.

The\nfollowing is a list of points of comparison between the two.\n\u2022 The payments for a lease are likely less than the payment for purchasing.\n\u2022 When leasing, you get a new car after the lease term is over, typically 24 or 36 months. Buying the car means the\nsame car is driven until it is re-sold and a new one bought. Essentially, leasing a car is equivalent to renting a car.\n\u2022 The leased car is new, so all warrantees are in force and you drive the car during its best years. When the car is\npurchased, it may be kept past its warrantees and may be driven until it is quite old.\n\u2022 Each time you lease a new car, all the fees and taxes must be paid again. When buying a car, these fees are only paid\nonce.\n\u2022 Leasing contracts carry restrictions on the mileage you can drive per year, and going over incurs more cost at the 682 6 \u2022 Money Management\nend of the lease. Buying the car means no such mileage limits.\n\u2022 When leasing, you are obligated to keep the vehicle in good condition and maintained according to the dealer\u2019s\nschedule. Some dealerships will even pay for oil changes over the life of the lease. When the car is purchased, the\nupkeep schedule is the choice of the owner.\n\u2022 When a car is purchased and kept for long enough, the warranty expires and the owner is responsible for all\nmaintenance items and repairs. The warrantee for a car won\u2019t expire during the lease term.\n\u2022 When a new car is purchased and the loan is paid off the car is still owned by the buyer and may be traded in when\na new car is to be purchased. When leasing, the car is returned to the dealer when the lease term is over.\nWhen deciding between the two, you are choosing between these features. If you aren\u2019t willing to drive an older car or\ndeal with the upkeep that accompanies an older car, you may want to lease. This means you will need to pay those\nbeginning costs each time the lease is up. If you want to own the car after the payments are over, then you may want to\nbuy a car. This means you are paying for all the upkeep after the warrantees expire, but you have no limits on mileage\nand own the car at the end. It really depends on your preferences.\nEXAMPLE6.106\nLease or Buy\nIn the following, determine if a lease or purchase of a car is better.\n1. Joyce is concerned with large repairs and does not want to deal with them.\n2. Maurice prefers to drive newer cars.\nSolution\n1. Since Joyce does not want to deal with repairs, so leasing would be a better choice. This way, the warranty covers\nmost of the big repairs that could need to be done.\n2. Since Maurice likes to drive new cars, leasing is a better option, since he will lease a new car every 2 to 3 years.\nYOUR TURN6.106\n1. Christopher does a lot of driving, averaging over 20,000 miles per year.\n2. John eventually wants to not make car payments.\nCar Insurance\nCar insurance is meant to cover costs associated with accidents involving cars. Most states (all except New Hampshire\nand Virginia) require some insurance. Without insurance, the state may not let you get a license for your car or register\nyour car. Your state\u2019s requirements can be hard to follow. Fortunately, insurance companies and brokers will make sure\nyour insurance is sufficient for your state and will warn you if you try to not meet the requirements. Of course, they may\noffer more than what is sufficient, so it is your responsibility to determine how much coverage you want, as long as the\nminimum insurance requirements are met. The cost of insurance should be accounted for when evaluating the\naffordability of buying or leasing a car.\nWhether your car is leased or owned, you do need insurance. This contributes to the cost of having the vehicle. Leasing\nor owning makes no difference to the insurance company you choose, because they are insuring you based on what you\nare driving, your driving record, and other information about you including where you live and your age. These\ninsurance policies have many components that address different costs that can come from auto accidents. This may\nmake details confusing, and you may not realize what you are paying for until you must use it. Here is a brief outline of\nthe different components of auto insurance, many of which are required by the state that issues your driver\u2019s license.\n\u2022 Liability insuranceis mandatory coverage in most states. Liability insurance covers property damage and injuries\nto others should you be found legally responsible for an accident. You are required to have the minimum amount of\ncoverage, as determined by your state, in both areas.\n\u2022 Collision insuranceis insurance covering the damage caused to your car if involved in an accident with another\nvehicle.\n\u2022 Comprehensive insuranceis an extra level of coverage if involved in an accident with another vehicle and covers\nother things like theft, vandalism, fire, or weather events as outlined in your policy. There is a deductible assigned to\neach type of insurance, an amount that you pay out of pocket before your comprehensive coverage takes effect.\nComprehensive insurance is often required if you lease or finance the purchase of a vehicle.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.11 \u2022 Buying or Leasing a Car 683\n\u2022 Uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance:If you are hit by an uninsured or underinsured motorist, this\ninsurance will help pay medical bills and damage to your car.\n\u2022 Medical payments insuranceis mandatory in some states and helps pay for medical costs associated with an\naccident, regardless of who is at fault.\n\u2022 Personal injury protection insuranceis coverage for certain medical bills and other expenses due to a car\naccident. Other covered expenses may include loss of income or childcare, depending on your policy.\n\u2022 Gap insuranceis designed to cover the gap between what is owed on the car and what the car is worth in the event\nyour car is a total loss.\n\u2022 Rental reimbursement insuranceis coverage for a rental car while your car is under repair resulting from an\naccident.\nYou can also purchase other special insurance policies, such as classic car insurance, new car replacement insurance, and\nsound system replacement insurance, to name a few. It is important that you determine exactly what you need, as\ninsurance policies can be expensive and vary according to your age, driving history, and where you live.\nEXAMPLE6.107\nTypes of Insurance\n1. Which component of insurance pays if you are in an accident with a motorist without insurance?\n2. Which component of insurance pays for the remaining principal owed on your car in the case of a total loss?\nSolution\n1. Uninsured motorist insurance covers accidents with those who have no insurance.\n2. Gap insurance will cover the gap between what is owed on the car and what it is worth if an accident results in a\ntotal loss.\nYOUR TURN6.107\n1. Which component of insurance covers medical bills in the event of an accident?\n2. Which component of insurance pays for costs to others if you have an accident and are found legally\nresponsible for those damages?\nEXAMPLE6.108\nMonthly Cost of Owning a Car\nIf your car payment is $287.50 per month and your car insurance is $930 every 6 months, what is the cost of the car per\nmonth when accounting for the insurance?\nSolution\nThe cost of the car including insurance is the monthly payment, $287.50, plus the monthly cost of the insurance. The\ninsurance cost per month is since the insurance cost is for every 6 months. Adding those the cost with\ninsurance is $442.50.\nYOUR TURN6.108\n1. If your car payment is $410.86 per month and your car insurance is $2,190 per year, what is the cost of the car\nper month when accounting for the insurance?\nMaintaining a Car\nCars are not a buy it and forget it item. They require upkeep, which adds to the cost of owning the car. Tires, brakes, and\nwipers need replacing. Oli changes, inspections, so many things other than gasoline. Below is a list of some maintenance\nrequirements for cars, along with cost and roughly how often they should happen. 684 6 \u2022 Money Management\nMaintenance Frequency Cost Range\nNew Tires Every 5 years $25\u2013$300 per tire\nOil Change Every 3,000\u20136,000 miles $35\u2013$75\nWipers Every 6\u201312 months $20\u2013$40\nInspection Annual $10\u2013$50\nBrake pads 10,000\u201320,000 miles $200\u2013$300\nAir Filter 15,000\u201330,000 miles $35\u2013$80\nWhen designing a budget, these expected costs should be accounted for. Extra money per month should be saved in\naddition to this budget category, to handle unanticipated, and perhaps very costly, repairs.\nEXAMPLE6.109\nEstella needs to budget for her car maintenance. She expects to buy new tires each 4 years, which will cost her $480 to\nreplace them all. Oil changes near her cost $49.99, and she believes she will get one every 4 months. Her inspection\ncosts $15 per year. Wipers for her car cost $95 for all three and she anticipates changing them every year. She drives less\nthan 30,000 miles per year, so she plans to replace the air filter once per year. The air filter for her car costs $57.50. How\nmuch should she budget per month to cover these costs?\nSolution\nHer yearly costs are the wipers, inspection, and tires, which total $167.50. Tires will be bought every 5 years, so per year\nshe should budget $96. Her oil changes, which will happen three times per year, cost $49.99 each, so she\u2019ll spend\n$149.97 for the year on oil changes. Adding these up, her yearly budget should include $413.47 for maintenance.\nDividing by 12 gives the monthly budget for maintenance, which is $34.46 (rounded up to the next penny).\nYOUR TURN6.109\n1.

(credit: \"New construction,\nnew development house for sale\" by jongorey/houseandhammer.com, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Evaluate advantages and disadvantages of renting.\n2. Evaluate advantages and disadvantages of homeownership.\n3. Calculate the monthly payment for a mortgage and related interest cost.\n4. Read and interpret an amortization schedule.\n5. Solve application problems involving affordability of a mortgage.\nAfter renting an apartment for 10 years, you realize that it may be time to purchase a home. Your job is stable, and you\ncould use more space. It is time to investigate becoming a homeowner. What are the things that you must consider, and\nwhat is the financial benefit of owning as opposed to renting? This section is about the advantages, disadvantages, and\ncosts of homeownership as opposed to renting.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Renting\nWhen renting, you will likely sign alease, which is a contract between a renter and a landlord. Alandlordis the person\nor company that owns property that is rented. The lease will detail your responsibilities, restrictions on activities,\ndeposits, fees, maintenance, repairs, and rent during the term of the lease. It also defines what your landlord can, and\ncannot, do with the property while you occupy the property.\nLike leasing a car, there are advantages to renting but also some disadvantages. Some advantages are:\n\u2022 Lower cost.\n\u2022 Short-term commitment.\n\u2022 Little to no maintenance cost. The landlord pays for or performs most maintenance.\n\u2022 You need not stay at end of lease. Once the lease term is over (the lease is up), you are not obligated to stay.\n\u2022 If renting in an apartment complex, there may be a pool, gym, or community room for renters to use.\nOf course, there are disadvantage too:\n\u2022 No tax incentives.\n\u2022 Housing cost is not fixed. When the lease is up, the rent can change.\n\u2022 No equity. When you are done living in a rental, you have built no value.\n\u2022 Restrictions on occupants. There may be a limit on how many can live in the apartment.\n\u2022 Restrictions on decorating. The property is not yours, so any decorating or improvements need landlord permission.\n\u2022 Limits on pets. Permission for pets, and their number and type, will be set forth in the lease.\n\u2022 May not be able to remain when lease term is over. The landlord can, at the end of your lease, invite you to leave.\n\u2022 The building may be sold, and the new landlord may institute changes to the lease when the previous lease expires.\nRenting has fees to be paid at the start of the lease. Typically, when you rent, you will pay first and last months\u2019 rent and\na security deposit. A security deposit is a sum of money that the landlord holds until the renter leaves the rental\nproperty. The deposit will cover repairs for damage to the apartment during the renter\u2019s stay but may be returned if the\napartment is in good condition. If your landlord runs a credit check on you, the landlord may charge you for that. 688 6 \u2022 Money Management\nAdvantages of Buying a Home\nThe advantages to buying a home mirror the disadvantages of renting, and the disadvantages of home ownership\nmirror the advantages of renting.\nSome advantages to buying a home are:\n\u2022 There are tax incentives. The interest you pay for your mortgage (more on that later) is deductible on your federal\nincome tax.\n\u2022 There are no restrictions on pets or occupants, unless laws in your area specify limits for homes.\n\u2022 You can redecorate any way you wish, limited only by the laws in your area.\n\u2022 Once your mortgage is set with a fixed-interest rate, your housing cost is fixed.\n\u2022 Your home grows equity, that is, the difference between what you owe and what the house is worth grows. You can\nuse the equity to secure loans, and you recover the equity (and more if you\u2019re fortunate) when you sell the house.\n\u2022 As long as you pay your mortgage and maintain the home to the standards of your community, you can stay as long\nas you wish.\nSome disadvantages to home ownership are:\n\u2022 The cost is higher than renting. Mortgages and associated costs are typically higher than rent for a similar living\nspace.\n\u2022 The owner is responsible for upkeep, maintenance, and repairs. These can be extremely costly.\n\u2022 The owner cannot walk away from the property. It can be sold, but simply leaving the property, especially if not paid\noff yet, has serious consequences.\nThe big question of affordability looms large over the decision to rent or buy. Renting, strictly from an affordability\nviewpoint, comes with much less initial outlay and smaller commitment. If you do not have sufficient income to regularly\nsave for possibly expensive repairs, or your credit isn\u2019t quite as good as it needs to be, then renting may be the best\nchoice. Of course, even if you can afford to buy a home, you may choose to rent based on the comparative advantages.\nVIDEO\nRent or Buy(https://openstax.org/r/Rent_or_Buy)\nBuying a home really involves two buyers. You and the mortgage company. The mortgage company has interest in the\nhome, as they are providing the funds for the home. They want to protect their investment, and many fees are about the\nbank as much as the buyer. They fund a mortgage based on the value they assign the property. Not you. This means they\nwill want some certainty that the home is sound, and you are a good investment.\nWHO KNEW?\nClosing Costs\nWhen a home is bought, there are many costs that need to be paid at the time of purchase, which are lumped under\nthe term closing costs. At the start of 2022, the average closing costs for a single-family home exceeded $6,800. These\ncosts include:\n\u2022 The appraisal fee, which is what is paid to someone to establish the home\u2019s worth.

Amortgage\nis a long-term loan and the property itself is the security. The bank decides the minimum down payment (with your\ninput), the payment schedule, the duration of the loan, whether the loan can be assumed by another party, and the\npenalty for late payments. The title of the home belongs to the bank.\nSince a mortgage is a loan, everything about loans fromThe Basics of Loansholds true, including the formula for the\npayments.\nMonthly Mortgage Payments\nThe formula to calculate your monthly payments of principal and interest uses APR as the annual interest rate.\nFORMULA\nThe payment, , per month to pay down a mortgage with beginning principal is\n, where is the annual interest rate in decimal form and is the number of years of\nthe payment.\nNote, payment to lenders is always rounded up to the next penny.\nTo find the total amount of your payments over the life of the loan, multiply your monthly payments by the number of\npayments.\nEXAMPLE6.110\n30-Year Mortgage at 4.8% Interest\nEvan buys a house.

This means you have money tied to the property,\nwhich lenders believe makes you less likely to walk away from a property. The amount of the down payment will be\ndecided between you and the mortgage company. However, if your down payment is less than 20% of the property\nvalue, you will be required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). This is insurance you pay for so that the\nmortgage company is protected ifyoudefault on the loan. It often comes to between 0.5% and 2.25% of the original\nloan amount. It increases your monthly payment. Once you reach 20% of the loan value, you can request that the PMI\nbe dropped. Even if you do not request cancelling the PMI, it will eventually and automatically be dropped.\nFor more, seethis article on ways to get rid of PMI(https://openstax.org/r/mortgage_insurance).\nReading and Interpreting Amortization Tables\nAmortization tables were addressed inThe Basics of Loans. They are most frequently encountered when analyzing\nmortgages.\nThe amortization table for a 30-year mortgage is quite long, containing 360 rows. A full table will not be reproduced\nhere. We can, though, read information from a portion of an amortization table.\nEXAMPLE6.113\nAmortization Table for a 30-Year, $165,900 Mortgage\nFigure 6.27shows a portion of an amortization table for a 30-year, $165,900 mortgage.

At what payment does the amount that is applied to mortgage finally exceed the amount applied to interest?\nEscrow Payments\nThe last few examples have looked at mortgage payments, which cover the principal and interest. However, when you\ntake out a mortgage, the payment is sometimes much higher than that. This is because your mortgage company also\nhas you pay into anescrow account, which is a savings account maintained by the mortgage company.\nYour insurance payments will be set by your insurer and the mortgage company will pay them on time for you from your\nescrow account. Your property taxes are set by where you live and are typically a percentage of your property\u2019sassessed\nvalue. The assessed value is the estimation of the value of your home and does not necessary reflect the purchase or\nresale value of the home. Your property taxes will also be paid on time by the mortgage company from your escrow\naccount.\nFor example, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the effective tax rate for property is 1.69% of the assessed value of the home.\nThese escrow payments, which cover bills for the home, can increase the monthly payments for your home well beyond\nthe basic principal and interest payment.\nEXAMPLE6.114\nAdding Escrow Payments to Mortgage Payments\nJenna decides to purchase a home, with mortgage of $108,450 at 6% interest for 30 years.

Determine gross, adjusted gross, and taxable income.\n2. Apply exemptions, deductions, and credits to basic income tax calculations.\n3. Compute FICA tax.\n4. Solve tax application problems for working students.\nBefore the start of the American Civil War in 1861, most of the country\u2019s revenue came from tariffs on trade and excise\ntaxes. However, this fell far short of the high cost of the war. Because of this, the federal government enacted the nation\u2019s\nfirst income tax with the Revenue Act of 1861, which created the Internal Revenue Service as we know it today.\nNo one likes paying income tax, but it is a reality of life. In this section, we will learn about Form 1040, the U.S. Individual\nIncome Tax Return, and ways to prepare for tax time.\nThe U.S. tax code may change from year to year. Because of this, this section includes examples of how taxes,\ndeductions, and exemptions might be computed. The types of income, deductions, and exemptions that are used in the\nexamples are used in the current tax code. 698 6 \u2022 Money Management\nGross, Adjusted Gross, and Taxable Income\nYour income drives how much you pay in taxes. The more you earn, the more you are likely to pay. But your income\nalone is not the full story. When you add all the money you earned from your job, freelance work, interest from savings,\nand other sources, you have yourgross income. If you are an employee, your income from your job will be reported on\na W-2, which is sent to you by your employer. Income from freelance work will be reported on a 1099-MISC form, and is\nsent by the company that paid you. Income from interest is reported on a 1099-INT form and comes from the entity that\npaid the interest.\nBefore you determine how much you owe in taxes, you will make certain adjustments to that gross income. You will\ndeduct, or subtract, some of income from the gross income. That\u2019s youradjusted gross income, or AGI. That is still not\nwhat you are taxed on. Next, you need to applyexemptionsto your income. These are pieces of income that the\ngovernment does not tax. After that is done, you reach yourtaxable income. We will look at each of these parts of the\ntaxable income.\nWHO KNEW?\nGifts and Winning\nMoney given as a gift my be taxed if the gift amount is high enough. If you win $50,000 in the lottery, that money is\ntaxed as income. If you give a family member a large cash gift, that gift will be subject to a tax provided that the gift\nexceeds the federally set limits.\nYou will notice that your paycheck already has taxes taken out of it. Your employer will withhold some of your income,\nsending it directly to the federal, state, and local governments. It is an estimate of how much you will owe in income tax.\nIn the end, it reduces how much you will pay when your taxes are due. If they withhold too much income, you will receive\nthe extra they withheld in the form of a refund.\nEXAMPLE6.115\nComputing Gross Income\nRoger is preparing to do his taxes. He worked two jobs, with reported income of $27,500 and $13,200. His two CDs\nyielded $327 together. He also won a split club raffle for $2,000.

What is Chloe\u2019s gross income?\nYour adjusted gross income (AGI) is computed before your taxes are determined. It begins with the gross income, and\nthen subtracts from that income any deduction.Deductionsare expenditures on your part that the government won\u2019t\ntax. These deductions include money deposited into tax-deferred investments, and mortgage interest that you paid,\ncharitable contributions if you made any, medical bills over a threshold, medical insurance under certain circumstances,\nand property taxes. If you add all these up, and they are all legal deductions, the sum is subtracted from your gross\nincome, leaving the AGI.\nEXAMPLE6.116\nCompute Adjusted Gross Income\nChandra\u2019s gross income is $58,400.

She paid $7,840 in mortgage interest and $3,810 in property taxes. She also\ndonated $1,500 to her favorite charity. What is Isabelle\u2019s AGI?\nRemember that your AGI is not yourtaxable income. Exemptions need to be subtracted from the AGI to reach your\ntaxable income. Exemptions are income that the government does not tax. Some examples of exempt income are\ndisbursements from health savings accounts for qualified medical expenses, bond interest, some IRA distributions, and\ngifts given that are under $16,000. Note that exemptions are different from deductions: exemptions are excused\nincomes, whereas deductions are excused expenditures.\nEXAMPLE6.117\nTaxable Income\nYelizaveta\u2019s AGI is $75,490.

What is her\ntaxable income?\nTax Credits\nAnother piece of the tax puzzle istax credits. This is money subtracted from the tax you owe.\nTax credits are very different from deductions or exemptions. Deductions and exemptions are taken away from your\ngross income before the tax you owe is calculated. A tax credit, is subtracted, dollar for dollar, from your tax bill. Once\nthe tax you owe is calculated, subtract the any tax credits from that calculated tax.\nSome of the tax credits are refundable. This means that if subtracting them from your tax results in a negative number,\nyou receive a tax refund. For more details, seethis article about tax credits(https://openstax.org/r/taxcredit.asp).\nThe federal government has placed income limits and restrictions and on those eligible to receive tax credits because\ntheir value is so high.

There is no cap to how many years you can apply for this credit.\n\u2022 Child tax creditis worth $2,000 per child under the age of 17 if that child lives at home at least half the year, subject\nto income limits. This is a refundable tax credit.\n\u2022 Child and dependent care tax creditwas designed to help pay for child care while the parent works. The amount\nof the credit is dependent on your income. However, the maximum amount that can be received is, in 2022, $4,000\nfor one eligible person, or $8,000 for two or more qualifying people. A dependent qualifies if they are a child under 700 6 \u2022 Money Management\n13 years old, a spouse who is unable to care for themselves, or some other qualifying person. This is a refundable\ntax credit.\n\u2022 Premium tax creditwas created by the Affordable Care Act, and it is one that is received by many people\nthroughout the year. In essence it is a health insurance premium subsidy. The amount of the credit is based on your\nincome and the price of health insurance in your area. This is a refundable tax credit.\nEXAMPLE6.118\nApply a Tax Credit\nKaitlyn has calculated the tax she owes to be $5,200. However, she receives an earned income tax credit of $1,715.

FICA taxes are used solely to fund Social Security and\nMedicare and are separate from federal income tax. It amounts to 7.65% of your gross pay, which is withheld from your\npaycheck automatically. Your employer is required to match the 7.65% amount. Of the 7.65%, 6.2% goes to Social\nSecurity (SSI), and 1.45% goes to Medicare.\nAs of 2022, SSI tax only applies to the first $147,000 of earnings.

The tax system in the United States is\nprogressive, meaning that the tax rates are marginal so the higher your taxable income the higher the tax rate you will\npay. Taxable income is broken into brackets, or ranges of income. Each bracket has a different tax rate. The tax brackets\nand rates for single filers as of 2022 are given below:\nBracket Lower Income Limit Upper Income Limit Tax Rate\n1 0 $10,275 10%\n2 $10,276 $41,775 12%\n3 $41,776 $89,075 22%\n4 $89,076 $170,050 24%\n5 $170,051 $215,950 32%\nTable6.3Federal Income Tax Brackets for Single Filers, 2021\u20132022\n(data source: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-\nadjustments-for-tax-year-2022) 702 6 \u2022 Money Management\nBracket Lower Income Limit Upper Income Limit Tax Rate\n6 $215,951 $539,900 35%\n7 $539,901 37%\nTable6.3Federal Income Tax Brackets for Single Filers, 2021\u20132022\n(data source: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-\nadjustments-for-tax-year-2022)\nSo if your taxable income is $76,500 and you are filing as a single filer, your tax bill will be 22% of that $76,500, right?\nWrong. Your income is split among those brackets and the money in each bracket is taxed at that bracket\u2019s tax rate.\nSeems confusing. Here is a list of steps to follow to find the tax owed.\nStep 1:Find the bracket for the income.\nStep 2:For each bracket below the income bracket, the tax from that bracket is:\nStep 2a:Find the difference between the upper limit of that bracket and upper limit of the next lower bracket. If this is\nbracket 1, use 0 as the upper limit of the previous bracket.\nStep 2b:The tax from that bracket is the bracket tax rate applied to the difference from Step 2a.\nStep 3:For the bracket that the income belongs to, find the income minus the lower limit for the bracket.\nStep 4:The tax for the bracket of the income is tax rate for that bracket applied to the difference found in Step 3.\nStep 5:Add these various tax values to get the total income tax.\nThere are various tax brackets, and the rates may change in any given year. The income limits may also change. For all\nexamples going forward, we will use the single filer tax brackets, even if those brackets are not appropriate (e.g., married\nor head of household filers).\nEXAMPLE6.122\nIncome Tax on Taxable Income\nFaith has a taxable income of $103,650.

Subtracting the\ndeductions from the gross income, we find his AGI to be $86,590.\nEmmanuel seems to have no exemptions, so his AGI and his taxable income are the same.\nWe find the taxes Emmanuel owes using the process outlined above.\nStep 1:His income belongs to the third tax bracket, $41,776 to $89,0875. So the taxes from the first two brackets follow\nsteps 2a and 2b.\nFor bracket 1:\nStep 2a:The upper limit is $10,275, the upper limit of the previous bracket was 0, so the difference is $10,275.\nStep 2b:For the first bracket, he owes 10% of $10,275, or $1,027.50.\nFor bracket 2:\nStep 2a:The upper limit is $41,775, the upper limit from the previous bracket was $10,275, so the difference is $31,500\nStep 2b:For the second bracket, he owes 12% of $31,500, or $3,780.\nStep 3:For bracket 3, his income is $86,590, the upper limit of the previous bracket is $41,775. The difference of those is\n.\nStep 4:The tax he owes for that bracket is 22% of the difference, which is $9,859.30.\nStep 5:The total in taxes that Emmanuel owes is the sum of the taxes found above, or\n.\nOnce his taxes are computed, he subtracts his tax credits.

what a percent is as a fraction, a decimal, and as a part of the whole.\n\u2022 Use the percent equation to find any of the three values that are related by the equation.\n\u2022 Apply the percent equation in applications.\n6.2Discounts, Markups, and Sales Tax\n\u2022 Discounts are markdowns from an original price.\n\u2022 Mark-ups are increases to the price paid by a retailer to cover their costs.\n\u2022 be able to calculate the markup based on a percentage of the cost\n\u2022 Sales taxes vary from state to state and often county to county.\n\u2022 Retail prices, sales prices and percent discounts can be calculated if the other two values are known.\n\u2022 Original costs, retail prices, and percent markup can be calculated if the other two values are known.\n\u2022 In calculations, sales tax acts like a markup.\n6.3Simple Interest\n\u2022 Interest is money that is paid by a borrower for the privilege of borrowing the money.\n\u2022 Simple interest is computed by substituting the principal, interest rate, and number of years into the formula\n\u2022 The payoff for a loan is the amount of principal remaining on a loan plus the interest that accumulated on the loan\nsince the last payment.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6 \u2022 Chapter Summary 709\n\u2022 The future value of an investment yielding simple interest is the original principal plus the interest earned on the\ninvestment.\n\u2022 When making a partial payment, some of the payment pays off all the accumulated interest, while the remainder of\nthe payment is applied to the principal of the loan.\n\u2022 Finding the present value of an investment is used to determine how much should be invested now in order to\nachieve a specific goal.\n6.4Compound Interest\n\u2022 Compound interest means that the interest earned during one period will earn interest in later periods. Essentially,\nthe amount of the principal grows from period to period.\n\u2022 The important values in computing compound interest are the interest rate, the principal, the length of time the\ninvestment, and the number of times the investment is compounded.\n\u2022 Compound interest has minimal impact early, but later has a very large impact.\n\u2022 You can determine how much to invest today in order to reach a goal for some time later.\n\u2022 Compound interest can be translated into an effective annual yield, which allows for comparison between\ninvestment options.\n6.5Making a Personal Budget\n\u2022 A budget is a set of guidelines for how to allocate your income.\n\u2022 Budgeting helps to plan for many of life\u2019s expenses\n\u2022 Budgets are used to compare income to expenses. When expenses exceed income, changes have to be made.\n\u2022 Budgets can help evaluate the affordability of life changes.\n\u2022 One guideline for setting a budget is the 50-30-20 budget philosophy. The guidelines suggest that 50% of income is\nallocated to necessary expenses, 30% to expenses that wants, and 20% to savings and other debt reduction.\n6.6Methods of Savings\n\u2022 There are three main types of savings accounts, saving accounts, certificates of deposit (CD), and money market\naccounts.\n\u2022 Savings account are very risk free, and so yield low interest rates.\n\u2022 The differences in the three types of savings accounts relate to their convenience.\n\u2022 Savings account typically have a lower interest rate that money market accounts, which typically have lower interest\nrates than CDs.\n\u2022 Ordinary annuities more accurately reflect how we save, in that money is deposited repeatedly over time.\n\u2022 Spreadsheet software, such as Google Sheets, have built in functions that can be used to quickly calculate both the\nfuture value of an ordinary annuity account, but also the payment necessary to reach a goal using an ordinary\nannuity.\n6.7Investments\n\u2022 There are many different investments with different returns and risks.\n\u2022 Bonds are loans form the purchaser to the entity selling the bond.\n\u2022 Bonds have some tax benefits, low to no risk, and a low return.\n\u2022 Stocks represent part ownership in a company. As such, stock holders share in the profits, and losses, of the\ncompany.\n\u2022 Information, including price, P/E, yearly highs and lows, and dividend amount can be found in online stock tables\navailable on many websites.\n\u2022 Mutual funds represent collections of professionally administered investment vehicles. Have shares in a mutual\nfund has lower risk than ownership of stocks.\n\u2022 Retirement accounts employ some of the same strategies as mutual funds, in that they spread the risk and are\nprofessionally managed.\n\u2022 IRAs and Roth IRAs differ on when taxes are paid on the money, and who can use them. Roth IRAs have income\nlimits while traditional IRAs do not.\n6.8The Basics of Loans\n\u2022 There are many reasons for a loan, but primarily it is taken out for a large expense when cash is not available.\n\u2022 Each payment for an installment loan consists of an interest portion and a principal portion.\n\u2022 There is a formula to calculate the payment necessary to pay off a loan in installments.\n\u2022 Amortization schedules, or tables, show how each payment is applied to principal and interest. It also includes other\ndetails such as remaining balance and total interest paid. 710 6 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n\u2022 Loans often have other fees associated with them such as origination fees or application fees. The total of the\ninterest paid and the fees is the cost of finance.\n6.9Understanding Student Loans\n\u2022 The FAFSA must be filled out each year that a student wishes to borrow for.\n\u2022 A student\u2019s funding gap determines how much they need in loans to pay for college.\n\u2022 Federal subsidized student loans defer payments until after graduation and interest does not accrue on these loans.\n\u2022 Unsubsidized student loans defer payment until after graduation but interest begins accruing as soon as the loan\nfinds are disbursed.\n\u2022 There are both yearly and aggregate limits for student loans to prevent over-borrowing, among other reasons.\n\u2022 Federal direct loans have a low interest rate set by the government, but other student loans have varying rates of\ninterest set by the banks.\n\u2022 The standard repayment plan lasts 10 years and is made up of monthly payments.\n\u2022 Consolidating or refinancing student loans merges many student loans into one loan.\n\u2022 If only federal loans are consolidated, the interest rate is the same as the individual loans, currently set at 4.99%.\n\u2022 If other loans are refinanced together, the interest rate may be lower with the new loan.\n\u2022 Other repayment plans are available. Such a plan may have payment that start small and grow as the loan is paid\noff, or it may have a longer term, or may be based on the discretionary income of the student.\n\u2022 Being delinquent on a student loan is a precursor to being in default. Making payments in a timely fashion allows\nthe student to avoid this situation.\n6.10Credit Cards\n\u2022 Credit cards can be a flexible way to pay for almost anything, but can become a financial hazard if used unwisely.\n\u2022 When deciding which credit card to apply for, evaluate the interest rate, fees (annual and late), reward programs and\ncredit limit. Be sure they meet your criteria.\n\u2022 Paying off the balance of your credit card every month will control your spending and will never result in paying\ninterest.\n\u2022 Credit card statements hold all important information about your credit card, including payment, balances, charges\nand billing cycle dates.\n\u2022 Although the minimum payment is attractive precisely because it is so small, paying only the minimum results is a\nlong payoff term and higher interest costs.\n6.11Buying or Leasing a Car\n\u2022 There are many factors to consider when choosing to buy or lease a car.\n\u2022 The cost of the car is increased by a number of fees and sales tax.\n\u2022 There are advantages to buying a car and advantages to leasing a car. The decision between the two depends on\nthe preference of the buyer.\n\u2022 Insurance covers costs associate with accidents.

Casinos must walk a fine line in order to be profitable. Their customers\nmust lose more money than they win, on average, in order to stay in business. But if the chances of a single customer\nwinning more money than they lose is too small, people will stop coming in the door to play the games.\nIn this chapter, we'll study the techniques a casino must use to determine how likely it is that a customer will win a\nparticular game, and then how the casino decides how much money a winner will rake in so that the customers are\nhappy, but the casino also turns a profit in the long run. In order to figure out those likelihoods, we have to be able to\nsomehow consider every possible outcome of these games. For example, in a game that involves players receiving 5\ncards from a deck of 52, there are 2,598,960 possibilities for each player. We'll start off this chapter by learning how to\ncount those possible outcomes. 724 7 \u2022 Probability\n7.1 The Multiplication Rule for Counting\nFigure7.2The Multiplication Rule for Counting allows us to compute more complicated probabilities, like drawing two\naces from a deck. (credit: \u201cPair of Aces \u2013 Poker\u201d by Poker Photos/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Apply the Multiplication Rule for Counting to solve problems.\nOne of the first bits of mathematical knowledge children learn is how to count objects by pointing to them in turn and\nsaying: \u201cone, two, three, \u2026\u201d That\u2019s a useful skill, but when the number of things that we need to count grows large, that\nmethod becomes onerous (or, forverylarge numbers, impossible for humans to accomplish in a typical human lifespan).\nSo, mathematicians have developed short cuts to counting big numbers. These techniques fall under the mathematical\ndiscipline ofcombinatorics, which is devoted to counting.\nMultiplication as a Combinatorial Short Cut\nOne of the first combinatorial short cuts to counting students learn in school has to do with areas of rectangles. If we\nhave a set of objects to be counted that can be physically arranged into a rectangular shape, then we can use\nmultiplication to do the counting for us. Consider this set of objects (Figure 7.3):\nFigure7.3\nCertainly we can count them by pointing and running through the numbers, but it\u2019s more efficient to group them (Figure\n7.4).\nFigure7.4\nIf we group the balls by 4s, we see that we have 6 groups (or, we can see this arrangement as 4 groups of 6 balls). Since\nmultiplication is repeated addition (i.e., ), we can use this grouping to quickly see that there\nare 24 balls.\nLet\u2019s generalize this idea a little bit. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re visiting a bakery that offers customized cupcakes. For the cake,\nwe have three choices: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Each cupcake can be topped with one of four types of frosting:\nvanilla, chocolate, lemon, and strawberry. How many different cupcake combinations are possible? We can think of\nlaying out all the possibilities in a grid, with cake choices defining the rows and frosting choices defining the columns\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 The Multiplication Rule for Counting 725\n(Figure 7.5).\nFigure7.5\nSince there are 3 rows (cakes) and 4 columns (frostings), we have possible combinations. This is the reasoning\nbehind theMultiplication Rule for Counting, which is also known as the Fundamental Counting Principle. This rule says\nthat if there are ways to accomplish one task and ways to accomplish a second task, then there are ways to\naccomplish both tasks. We can tack on additional tasks by multiplying the number of ways to accomplish those tasks to\nour previous product.\nEXAMPLE7.1\nUsing the Multiplication Rule for Counting\nEvery card in a standard deck of cards has two identifying characteristics: a suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades;\nthese are indicated by these symbols, respectively: , , , ) and a rank (ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, and\nking; the letters A, J, Q, and K are used to represent the words). Each possible pair of suit and rank appears exactly once\nin the deck.

Apply permutations to solve problems.\nSwimming events are some of the most popular events at the summer Olympic Games. In the finals of each event, 8\nswimmers compete at the same time, making for some exciting finishes. How many different orders of finish are\npossible in these events? In this section, we\u2019ll extend the Multiplication Rule for Counting to help answer questions like\nthis one, which relate topermutations. A permutation is an ordered list of objects taken from a given population. The\nlength of the list is given, and the list cannot contain any repeated items.\nApplying the Multiplication Rule for Counting to Permutations\nIn the case of the swimming finals, one possible permutation of length 3 would be the list of medal winners (first,\nsecond, and third place finishers). A permutation of length 8 would be the full order of finish (first place through eighth\nplace). Let\u2019s use the Multiplication Rule for Counting to figure out how many of each of these permutations there are.\nEXAMPLE7.4\nUsing the Multiplication Rule for Counting to Find the Number of Permutations\nThe final heat of Olympic swimming events features 8 swimmers (or teams of swimmers).\n1. How many different podium placements (first place, second place, and third place) are possible?\n2. How many different complete orders of finish (first place through eighth place) are possible?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.2 \u2022 Permutations 729\nSolution\n1. Let\u2019s start with the first place finisher. How many options are there? Since 8 swimmers are competing, there are 8\npossibilities. Once that first swimmer completes the race, there are 7 swimmers left competing for second place.\nAfter the second finisher is decided, there are 6 swimmers remaining who could possibly finish in third place. Thus,\nthere are 8 possibilities for first place, 7 for second place, and 6 for third place. The Multiplication Rule for Counting\nthen tells us there are different ways the winners\u2019 podium can be filled out.\n2. To look at the complete order of finish, we can continue the pattern we can see in part 1 of this example: There are 5\npossibilities for fourth place, 4 for fifth place, 3 for sixth place, 2 for seventh place, and then just 1 swimmer is left to\nfinish in eighth place. Using the Multiplication Rule for Counting, we see that there are\npossible orders of finish.\nYOUR TURN7.4\n1. You have a hand of 5 cards (that happen to create what\u2019s called a royal flush in the game of poker): 10 , J , Q ,\nK , and A . Into how many different orders can you put those cards?\nFactorials\nThe pattern we see inExample 7.4occurs commonly enough that we have a name for it:factorial.\nFor any positive whole number , we define the factorial of (denoted and read \" factorial\") to be the product of\nevery whole number less than or equal to . We also define 0! to be equal to one. We will use factorials in a couple of\ndifferent contexts, so let's get some practice doing computations with them.\nEXAMPLE7.5\nComputing Factorials\nCompute the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\nSolution\n1.\n2. There are two ways to approach this calculation. The first way is to compute the factorials first, then divide:\nHowever, there is an easier way! You may notice in the second step that there are several terms that can be\ncanceled; that\u2019s always the case whenever we divide factorials. In this case, notice that we can rewrite the numerator\nlike this:\nWith that in mind, we can proceed this way by canceling out the 6!:\nThat\u2019s much easier!\n3. Let\u2019s approach this one using our canceling technique. When we see two factorials in either the numerator or\ndenominator, we should focus on the larger one first. So: 730 7 \u2022 Probability\nYOUR TURN7.5\nCompute the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\nPermutations\nAs we\u2019ve seen, factorials can pop up when we\u2019re computing permutations. In fact, there is a formula that we can use to\nmake that connection explicit. Let\u2019s define some notation first. If we have a collection of objects and we wish to create\nan ordered list of of the objects (where ), we\u2019ll call the number of those permutations (read \u201cthe number\nof permutations of objects taken at a time\u201d). We formalize the formula we'll use to compute permutations below.\nFORMULA\nIf you wondered why we defined earlier, it was to make formulas like this one work; if we have objects and want\nto order all of them (so, we want the number of permutations of objects taken at a time), we get\n.

The estimated age of the\nuniverse isonlyabout seconds. So, if a very bored all-powerful being started shuffling cards at the instant\nthe universe began, it would have to have averaged at least shufflesper second since the\nbeginning of timeto have covered every possible arrangement of a deck of cards.

Compute combinations.\n3. Apply combinations to solve applications.\nInPermutations, we studied permutations, which we use to count the number of ways to generate an ordered list of a\ngiven length from a group of objects. An important property of permutations is that the order of the list matters: The\nresults of a race and the selection of club officers are examples of lists where the order is important. In other situations,\nthe order is not important. For example, in most card games where a player receives a hand of cards, the order in which\nthe cards are received is irrelevant; in fact, players often rearrange the cards in a way that helps them keep the cards\norganized.\nCombinations: When Order Doesn\u2019t Matter\nIn situations in which the order of a list of objects doesn\u2019t matter, the lists are no longer permutations.

Since there is no distinction among the responsibilities of the 3 committee members, the order isn\u2019t important. So,\nthis is a combination.\n2. The order of the characters in a password matter, so this is a permutation.\n3. The order of finish matters in a dog show, so this is a permutation.\n4. A plate with mashed potatoes, peas, and broccoli is functionally the same as a plate with peas, broccoli, and mashed\npotatoes, so this is a combination.\nYOUR TURN7.8\nDecide whether the following represent permutations or combinations:\n1.

Your instructor chooses half\nthe class to take the first vehicle.\nCounting Combinations\nPermutations and combinations are certainly related, because they both involve choosing a subset of a large group. Let\u2019s\nexplore that connection, so that we can figure out how to use what we know about permutations to help us count\ncombinations. We\u2019ll take a basic example. How many ways can we select 3 letters from the group A, B, C, D, and E? If\norder matters, that number is . That\u2019s small enough that we can list them all out in the table below.\nABC ABD ABE ACB ACD ACE\nADB ADC ADE AEB AEC AED\nBAC BAD BAE BCA BCD BCE\nBDA BDC BDE BEA BEC BED\nCAB CAD CAE CBA CBD CBE\nCDA CDB CDE CEA CEB CED\nDCA DAC DAE DBA DBC DBE\nDCA DCB DCE DEA DEB DEC\nEAB EAC EAD EBA EBC EBD\nECA ECB ECD EDA EDB EDC 734 7 \u2022 Probability\nNow, let\u2019s look back at that list and color-code it so that groupings of the same 3 letters get the same color, as shown in\nFigure 7.9:\nFigure7.9\nAfter color-coding, we see that the 60 cells can be seen as 10 groups (colors) of 6. That\u2019s no coincidence! We\u2019ve already\nseen how to compute the number of permutations using theformulaTo compute the number of combinations, let\u2019s\ncount them another way using the Multiplication Rule for Counting. We\u2019ll do this in two steps:\nStep 1:Choose 3 letters (paying no attention to order).\nStep 2:Put those letters in order.\nThe number of ways to choose 3 letters from this group of 5 (A, B, C, D, E) is the number of combinations we\u2019re looking\nfor; let\u2019s call that number (read \u201cthe number of combinations of 5 objects taken 3 at a time\u201d). We can see from our\nchart that this is ten (the number of colors used). We can generalize our findings this way: remember that the number of\npermutations of things taken at a time is .

Khayyam is\nprobably best remembered as a poet, with hisRubaiyatbeing his most famous work.\nMeanwhile, in 11th-century China, Jia Xian also was working with combinations, as was his 13th-century successor\nYang Hui.\nIt is not known whether the discoveries of any of these men were known in the other regions, or if the Indians,\nPersians, and Chinese all came to their discoveries independently.

(credit:\n\u201cPea Plant\u201d by Maria Keays/Flickr, CC BY 2.0))\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Determine the sample space of single stage experiment.\n2. Use tables to list possible outcomes of a multistage experiment.\n3. Use tree diagrams to list possible outcomes of a multistage experiment.\nIn the 19th century, an Augustinian friar and scientist named Gregor Mendel used his observations of pea plants to set\nout his theory of genetic propagation. In his work, he looked at the offspring that resulted from breeding plants with\ndifferent characteristics together. For applications like this, it is often insufficient to only know in how many ways a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 739\nprocess might end; we need to be able to list all of the possibilities. As we\u2019ve seen, the number of possible outcomes can\nbe very large! Thus, it\u2019s important to have a strategy that allows us to systematically list these possibilities to make sure\nwe don\u2019t leave any out. In this section, we\u2019ll look at two of these strategies.\nSingle Stage Experiments\nWhen we are talking about combinatorics or probability, the word \u201cexperiment\u201d has a slightly different meaning than it\ndoes in the sciences. Experiments can range from very simple (\u201cflip a coin\u201d) to very complex (\u201ccount the number of\nuranium atoms that undergo nuclear fission in a sample of a given size over the course of an hour\u201d). Experiments have\nunknown outcomes that generally rely on something random, so that if the experiment is repeated (orreplicated) the\noutcome might be different. No matter what the experiment, though, analysis of the experiment typically begins with\nidentifying its sample space.\nThesample spaceof an experiment is the set of all of the possible outcomes of the experiment, so it\u2019s often expressed\nas a set (i.e., as a list bound by braces; if the experiment is \u201crandomly select a number between 1 and 4,\u201d the sample\nspace would be written ).\nEXAMPLE7.12\nFinding the Sample Space of an Experiment\nFor each of the following experiments, identify the sample space.\n1. Flip a coin (which has 2 faces, typically called \u201cheads\u201d and \u201ctails\u201d) and note which face is up.\n2. Flip a coin 10 times and count the number of heads.\n3. Roll a 6-sided die and note the number that is on top.\n4. Roll two 6-sided dice and note the sum of the numbers on top.\nSolution\n1. If we use \u201cH\u201d to denote \u201cheads is facing up\u201d and \u201cT\u201d to denote \u201ctails is facing up\u201d, then the sample space is {H, T}.\n2. It\u2019s possible (though unlikely) that there will be no heads flipped; the outcome in that case would be \u201c0.\u201d It\u2019s also\npossible (more likely, but still quite unlikely) that only one flip will result in heads. Any other whole number is\npossible, up to the maximum: We\u2019re flipping the coin 10 times, so we can\u2019t get any more than 10 heads. So, the\nsample space is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.\n3. There are 6 numbers on the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, the sample space for a single roll of the die is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n4. If we roll 2 dice, the smallest possible sum we could get is and the biggest is . Every other\nwhole number between those two is possible. So, the sample space is {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}.\nYOUR TURN7.12\nIdentify the sample space of each experiment.\n1. You draw a card from a standard deck and note its suit.\n2. You draw a card from a standard deck and note its rank.\n3. You roll a 4-sided die and note the number on the bottom. (A 4-sided die is shaped like a pyramid, so when it\ncomes to rest, there\u2019s no single side facing up.)\n4. You roll three 4-sided dice and note the sum of the numbers on the bottom.\nMultistage Experiments\nSome experiments have more complicated sample spaces because they occur in stages. These stages can occur in\nsuccession (like drawing cards one at a time) or simultaneously (rolling 2 dice). Sample spaces get more complicated as\nthe complexity of the experiment increases, so it\u2019s important to choose a systematic method for identifying all of the\npossible outcomes. The first method we\u2019ll discuss is the table.\nUsing Tables to Find Sample Spaces\nTables are useful for finding the sample space for experiments that meet two criteria: (1) The experiment must have only\ntwo stages, and (2) the outcomes of each stage must have no effect on the outcomes of the other. When the stages do\nnot affect each other, we say the stages areindependent. Otherwise, the stages aredependentand so we can\u2019t use\ntables; we\u2019ll look at a method for analyzing dependent stages soon. 740 7 \u2022 Probability\nEXAMPLE7.13\nDetermining Independence\nDecide whether the two stages in these experiments are independent or dependent.\n1. You flip a coin and note the result, and then flip the coin again and note the result.\n2. You draw 2 cards from a standard deck (52 cards), one at a time.\nSolution\n1. No matter what happens on the first flip, the second flip has the same sample space: {H, T} (You\u2019ll sometimes hear\nthe phrase \u201cThe coin has no memory\u201d). So, these stages are independent.\n2. Let\u2019s say that the first card you draw is A . The sample space for the second draw consists of all the cardsexceptA\n(since that card is no longer in the deck, you can\u2019t draw it again). If instead that first card was 2 , the sample space\nfor the second draw is different: it\u2019s every card except 2 . Since the sample space for the second card changes\nbased on the result of the first draw, these stages are dependent.\nYOUR TURN7.13\nDecide whether the two stages in these experiments are dependent or independent.\n1. You\u2019re getting dressed to go to a party, and you plan to wear a blouse and a skirt. You choose the blouse first,\nthen the skirt (assume that you\u2019d be comfortable wearing any of your skirts with any of your blouses).\n2. On further reflection, you realize that some of your skirts clash with some of your blouses. So, you choose the\nblouse first, and then choose a skirt that goes with your chosen blouse.\nIf you have a two-stage experiment with independent stages, a table is the most straightforward way to identify the\nsample space. To build a table, you list the outcomes of one stage of the experiment along the top of the table and the\noutcomes of the other stage down the side. The cells in the interior of the table are then filled using the outcomes\nassociated with each cell\u2019s row and column. Let\u2019s look at an example.\nEXAMPLE7.14\nUsing Tables to Identify Sample Spaces\nIdentify the sample spaces of these experiments using tables.\n1. You roll two dice: one 4-sided and one 6-sided.\n2. You\u2019re in an ice-cream shop, and you\u2019re going to get a single scoop of ice cream with a topping. The flavors of ice\ncream you\u2019re considering are vanilla, chocolate, and rocky road; the toppings are fudge, whipped cream, and\nsprinkles.\n3. The pea plants you\u2019re breeding have two possible pod colors: green and yellow. These colors are decided by a\nparticular gene, which comes in two types: \u201cG\u201d for green, and \u201cg\u201d for yellow (In genetics, capital letters usually\ndenotedominantgenes, while lower-case letters denoterecessivegenes). Each plant has two genes. If you breed a\nGg pea plant with a gg plant, the offspring plant will get one gene from each parent. What are the possible\noutcomes?\nSolution\n1. Step 1:Make the outline of a table, with the results of the 4-sided roll on one side and the results of the 6-sided roll\non the other. In practice, it doesn\u2019t matter which you choose; for this example, we\u2019ll put the 4-sided results on top\n(labeling the columns of the chart) and the 6-sided results on the side (labeling the rows of the chart) as shown in\nthe following table:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 741\n4-Sided Roll\n1 2 3 4\n6-Sided Roll 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nStep 2:Fill in the results in each cell of the table below. Use the notation of an ordered pair, with the row label first.\n4-Sided Roll\n1 2 3 4\n6-Sided Roll 1 (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (1,4)\n2 (2,1) (2,2) (2,3) (2,4)\n3 (3,1) (3,2) (3,3) (3,4)\n4 (4,1) (4,2) (4,3) (4,4)\n5 (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4)\n6 (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (6,4)\nSo, for example, (3,2) represents the outcome where the 6-sided roll results in a 3, and the 4-sided roll gives us a 2.\nThus, the sample space of the experiment is {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,1),\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)}.\n2. Step 1:Let\u2019s put the flavors on the rows and the toppings on the columns of the following table:\nToppings\nfudge whipped cream sprinkles\nFlavors vanilla\nchocolate\nrocky road\nStep 2:We can fill in the cells of the table below with the resulting combinations. 742 7 \u2022 Probability\nToppings\nfudge whipped cream sprinkles\nFlavors vanilla vanilla with fudge vanilla with whipped cream vanilla with sprinkles\nchocolate chocolate with fudge chocolate with whipped cream chocolate with sprinkles\nrocky road rocky road with fudge rocky road with whipped cream rocky road with sprinkles\nSo, the sample space is {vanilla with fudge, vanilla with whipped cream, vanilla with sprinkles, chocolate with fudge,\nchocolate with whipped cream, chocolate with sprinkles, rocky road with fudge, rocky road with whipped cream,\nrocky road with sprinkles}.\n3. Step 1:We\u2019ll put the parents\u2019 genes (P1 and P2) as labels on the rows and columns of the following table:\nP2\ng g\nP1 G\ng\nStep 2:We\u2019ll fill in the offspring\u2019s gene composition, listing parent 1\u2019s gene first in the table below.\nP2\ng g\nP1 G Gg Gg\ng gg gg\nThus, the sample space is {Gg, Gg, gg, gg}. (Diagrams like this, which allow us to identify the genotypes of offspring,\nare calledPunnett squaresin honor of Reginald Punnett (1875\u20131967), who first used them in the context of\ngenetics.)\nYOUR TURN7.14\n1. Use a table to identify the sample space of an experiment in which you flip a coin and roll a 6-sided die.\nUsing Tree Diagrams to Identify Sample Spaces\nIn experiments where there are more than two stages, or where the stages are dependent, atree diagramis a helpful\ntool for systematically identifying the sample space. Tree diagrams are built by first drawing a single point (ornode),\nthen from that node we draw one branch (a short line segment) for each outcome of the first stage. Each branch gets its\nown node at the other end (which we typically label with the corresponding outcome for that branch); from each of\nthese, we draw another branch for each outcome of the second stage, assuming that the outcome of the first stage\nmatches the branch we were on. If there are other stages, we can continue from there by continuing to add branches\nand nodes. This sounds really complicated, but it\u2019s easier to understand through an example.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 743\nEXAMPLE7.15\nUsing a Tree Diagram to Identify a Sample Space\nUse a tree diagram to find the sample spaces of each of the following experiments:\n1. You flip a coin 3 times, noting the outcome of each flip in order.\n2. You flip a coin. If the result is heads, you roll a 4-sided die. If it\u2019s tails, you roll a 6-sided die.\n3. You are planning to go on a hike with a group of friends. There are 3 trails to consider: Abel Trail, Borel Trail, and\nCondorcet Trail. One of your friends, Jess, requires a wheelchair; if she joins you, the group couldn\u2019t handle the rocky\nCondorcet Trail.\nSolution\n1. Step 1:Let\u2019s start by placing our first node (Figure 7.11).\nFigure7.11\nStep 2:We\u2019ll add two branches, one for each outcome of the first coin flip, and label them (Figure 7.12).\nFigure7.12\nStep 3:We\u2019re ready for stage two of the experiment: another coin flip. At each node, we add in branches that\nrepresent those outcomes (Figure 7.13).\nFigure7.13\nFinally, we can add another set of branches for the outcomes of the third stage (Figure 7.14). 744 7 \u2022 Probability\nFigure7.14\n(These final nodes are calledleaves.)\nStep 4:We can write down the outcomes in the sample space by tracing the path out to each leaf, writing down the\noutcome at each node we pass through. For example, this leaf (Figure 7.15):\nFigure7.15\nis reached via this path (Figure 7.16):\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 745\nFigure7.16\nStep 5:We\u2019ll label that leaf as \"HTH\" (Figure 7.17), since the path passes through nodes labeled H, T, and H on its\nway out to our leaf.\nFigure7.17\nStep 6:We can label the remaining leaves using the same method (Figure 7.18). 746 7 \u2022 Probability\nFigure7.18\nThe sample space is the labels on the leaves: {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}.\n2. Step 1:We\u2019ll start with our initial node (Figure 7.19).\nFigure7.19\nStep 2:We\u2019ll add in branches for the outcomes of the first stage (Figure 7.20), which is the coin flip.\nFigure7.20\nStep 3:The second stage of the experiment depends on the outcome of the first stage.\na. If the outcome of the first stage was H, then we roll a 4-sided die. So,onlyon the node for H, we\u2019ll add in the\noutcomes of a 4-sided die roll (Figure 7.21).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 747\nFigure7.21\nb. If the outcome of the first stage was T, then we roll a 6-sided die. So, we\u2019ll add those branches to the node for T\n(Figure 7.22).\nFigure7.22\nStep 4:We can label the leaves to get the sample space (Figure 7.23). 748 7 \u2022 Probability\nFigure7.23\nThe sample space is: {H1, H2, H3, H4, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6}.\nc. Step 1:Let\u2019s label the trails A, B, and C for ease of labeling. Even though the trails are listed first in the exercise, we\ncan\u2019t use the trail choice as our first stage: the trails available to us depend on whether Jess is able to join the trip.\nSo, the first stage is whether Jess joins us (J) or not (N) (Figure 7.24).\nFigure7.24\nStep 2:We list the appropriate trails on each branch (Figure 7.25).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Tree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes 749\nFigure7.25\nSo, the sample space is {JA, JB, NA, NB, NC}.\nYOUR TURN7.15\n1. You have a modified deck of cards containing only J , Q , and K . You draw 2 cards without replacing them\n(where order matters). Use a tree diagram to identify the sample space.\nCheck Your Understanding\n17. You flip a coin 6 times and note the number of heads. What is the sample space of this experiment?\n18. You are ordering a combo meal at a restaurant. The meal comes with either 8 or 12 chicken nuggets, and your\nchoice of crinkle fries, curly fries, or onion rings.

On the TV game showThe Price Is Right, contestants play games to try to win prizes. One of these games is\ncalled \u201cLet \u2018Em Roll.\u201d In this game, players roll five 6-sided dice. These dice each have 3 faces labeled with a car;\nthe other 3 faces are labeled with prize money amounts (one each of $500, $1,000, and $1,500). Players get to\nroll all 5 dice, and then have the opportunity to win additional rolls. If all 5 dice show a car, the contestant wins a\nnew car. If not, the contestant can use any additional rolls to reroll the dice with prize money showing to try to\nwin the car (or, they can take the total amount of money showing on the dice and end the game).

If not, the\ncontestant can use any additional rolls to reroll the dice with prize money showing to try to win the car (or, they can\ntake the total amount of money showing on the dice and end the game). Kathleen is playing this game, and she\nhas 3 rolls to try to win the car. On her first roll, 3 of the dice showed cars. Use an appropriate method to find the\nsample space of the number of cars showing after each of the following rolls. Give those outcomes as ordered\npairs: (number of cars after the second roll, number of cars after the third roll).\n28. In the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, each of 2 players chooses 1 of the 3 title objects. The players reveal their choices\nsimultaneously using hand signals. Jim and Eva are gearing up to play the game. List the sample space of all the\npossible outcomes of the first round of their game as ordered pairs of the form (Jim\u2019s choice, Eva\u2019s choice).\n7.5 Basic Concepts of Probability\nFigure7.26When you roll two dice, some outcomes (like rolling a sum of seven) are more likely than others (rolling a\nsum of twelve).

Define probability including impossible and certain events.\n2. Calculate basic theoretical probabilities.\n3. Calculate basic empirical probabilities.\n4. Distinguish among theoretical, empirical, and subjective probability.\n5. Calculate the probability of the complement of an event.\nIt all comes down to this. The game ofMonopolythat started hours ago is in the home stretch. Your sister has the dice,\nand if she rolls a 4, 5, or 7 she\u2019ll land on one of your best spaces and the game will be over. How likely is it that the game\nwill end on the next turn? Is it more likely than not? How can we measure that likelihood? This section addresses this\nquestion by introducing a way to measure uncertainty.\nIntroducing Probability\nUncertainty is, almost by definition, a nebulous concept. In order to put enough constraints on it that we can\nmathematically study it, we will focus on uncertainty strictly in the context of experiments. Recall that experiments are\nprocesses whose outcomes are unknown; the sample space for the experiment is the collection of all those possible\noutcomes. When we want to talk about the likelihood of particular outcomes, we sometimes group outcomes together;\nfor example, in theMonopolyexample at the beginning of this section, we were interested in the roll of 2 dice that might\nfall as a 4, 5, or 7. A grouping of outcomes that we\u2019re interested in is called anevent. In other words, an event is a subset\nof the sample space of an experiment; it often consists of the outcomes of interest to the experimenter.\nOnce we have defined the event that interests us, we can try to assess the likelihood of that event. We do that by 752 7 \u2022 Probability\nassigning a number to each event ( ) called theprobabilityof that event ( ). The probability of an event is a number\nbetween 0 and 1 (inclusive). If the probability of an event is 0, then the event is impossible. On the other hand, an event\nwith probability 1 is certain to occur. In general, the higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event\nwill occur.\nEXAMPLE7.16\nDetermining Certain and Impossible Events\nConsider an experiment that consists of rolling a single standard 6-sided die (with faces numbered 1-6). Decide if these\nprobabilities are equal to zero, equal to one, or somewhere in between.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\nSolution\nLet's start by identifying the sample space. For one roll of this die, the possible outcomes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6}. We can use\nthat to assess these probabilities:\n1. We see that 4 is in the sample space, so it\u2019s possible that it will be the outcome. It\u2019s not certain to be the outcome,\nthough. So, .\n2. Notice that 7 is not in the sample space. So, .\n3. Every outcome in the sample space is a positive number, so this event is certain. Thus, .\n4. Since is not in the sample space, .\n5. Some outcomes in the sample space are even numbers (2, 4, and 6), but the others aren\u2019t. So,\n.\n6. Every outcome in the sample space is a single-digit number, so .\nYOUR TURN7.16\nJorge is about to conduct an experiment that consists of flipping a coin 4 times and recording the number of heads\n. Decide if these probabilities are equal to zero, equal to one, or somewhere in between.\n1.\n2.\n3.\nThree Ways to Assign Probabilities\nThe probabilities of events that are certain or impossible are easy to assign; they\u2019re just 1 or 0, respectively. What do we\ndo about those in-between cases, for events that might or might not occur? There are three methods to assign\nprobabilities that we can choose from. We\u2019ll discuss them here, in order of reliability.\nMethod 1: Theoretical Probability\nThe theoretical method gives the most reliable results, but it cannot always be used. If the sample space of an\nexperiment consists of equally likely outcomes, then thetheoretical probabilityof an event is defined to be the ratio of\nthe number of outcomes in the event to the number of outcomes in the sample space.\nFORMULA\nFor an experiment whose sample space consists of equally likely outcomes, thetheoretical probabilityof the\nevent is the ratio\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Basic Concepts of Probability 753\nwhere and denote the number of outcomes in the event and in the sample space, respectively.\nEXAMPLE7.17\nComputing Theoretical Probabilities\nRecall that a standard deck of cards consists of 52 unique cards which are labeled with a rank (the whole numbers from 2\nto 10, plus J, Q, K, and A) and a suit ( , , , or ). A standard deck is thoroughly shuffled, and you draw one card at\nrandom (so every card has an equal chance of being drawn). Find the theoretical probability of each of these events:\n1. The card is .\n2. The card is a .\n3. The card is a king (K).\nSolution\nThere are 52 cards in the deck, so the sample space for each of these experiments has 52 elements. That will be the\ndenominator for each of our probabilities.\n1. There is only one in the deck, so this event only has one outcome in it. Thus, .\n2. There are 13 in the deck, so .\n3. There are 4 cards of each rank in the deck, so .\nYOUR TURN7.17\nYou are about to roll a fair (meaning that each face has an equal chance of landing up) 6-sided die, whose faces are\nlabeled with the numbers 1 through 6. Find the theoretical probabilities of each outcome.\n1. You roll a 4.\n2. You roll a number greater than 2.\n3. You roll an odd number.\nIt is critical that you make sure that every outcome in a sample space is equally likely before you compute\ntheoretical probabilities!\nEXAMPLE7.18\nUsing Tables to Find Theoretical Probabilities\nIn theBasic Concepts of Probability, we were considering aMonopolygame where, if your sister rolled a sum of 4, 5, or 7\nwith 2 standard dice, you would win the game. What is the probability of this event? Use tables to determine your\nanswer.\nSolution\nWe should think of this experiment as occurring in two stages: (1) one die roll, then (2) another die roll. Even though\nthese two stages will usually occur simultaneously in practice, since they\u2019re independent, it\u2019s okay to treat them\nseparately.\nStep 1:Since we have two independent stages, let\u2019s create a table (Figure 7.27), which is probably the most efficient\nmethod for determining the sample space. 754 7 \u2022 Probability\nFigure7.27\nNow, each of the 36 ordered pairs in the table represent an equally likely outcome.\nStep 2:To make our analysis easier, let\u2019s replace each ordered pair with the sum (Figure 7.28).\nFigure7.28\nStep 3:Since the event we\u2019re interested in is the one consisting of rolls of 4, 5, or 7. Let\u2019s shade those in (Figure 7.29).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Basic Concepts of Probability 755\nFigure7.29\nOur event contains 13 outcomes, so the probability that your sister rolls a losing number is .\nYOUR TURN7.18\n1. If you roll a pair of 4-sided dice with faces labeled with the numbers 1 through 4, what is the probability of rolling\na sum of 6 or 7?\nEXAMPLE7.19\nUsing Tree Diagrams to Compute Theoretical Probability\nIf you flip a fair coin 3 times, what is the probability of each event? Use a tree diagram to determine your answer\n1. You flip exactly 2 heads.\n2. You flip 2 consecutive heads at some point in the 3 flips.\n3. All 3 flips show the same result.\nSolution\nLet\u2019s build a tree to identify the sample space (Figure 7.30). 756 7 \u2022 Probability\nFigure7.30\nThe sample space is {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}, which has 8 elements.\n1. Flipping exactly 2 heads occurs three times (HHT, HTH, THH), so the probability is .\n2. Flipping 2 consecutive heads at some point in the experiment happens 3 times: HHH, HHT, THH. So, the probability\nis .\n3. There are 2 outcomes that all show the same result: HHH and TTT. So, the probability is .\nYOUR TURN7.19\nYou have a modified deck of cards containing only 3 , 4 , and 5 . You draw 2 two cards without replacing them\n(where order matters). What is the probability of each event?\n1. The first card drawn is 3 .\n2. The first card drawn has a lower number than the second card.\n3. One of the cards drawn is 4 .\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nGerolamo Cardano\nThe first known text that provided a systematic approach to probabilities was written in 1564 by Gerolamo Cardano\n(1501\u20131576). Cardano was a physician whose illegitimate birth closed many doors that would have otherwise been\nopen to someone with a medical degree in 16th-century Italy. As a result, Cardano often turned to gambling to help\nends meet. He was a remarkable mathematician, and he used his knowledge to gain an edge when playing at cards\nor dice. His 1564 work, titledLiber de ludo aleae(which translates asBook on Games of Chance), summarized\neverything he knew about probability. Of course, if that book fell into the hands of those he played against, his\nadvantage would disappear. That\u2019s why he never allowed it to be published in his lifetime (it was eventually published\nin 1663). Cardano made other contributions to mathematics; he was the first person to publish the third degree\nanalogue of the Quadratic Formula (though he didn\u2019t discover it himself), and he popularized the use of negative\nnumbers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Basic Concepts of Probability 757\nMethod 2: Empirical Probability\nTheoretical probabilities are precise, but they can\u2019t be found in every situation. If the outcomes in the sample space are\nnot equally likely, then we\u2019re out of luck. Suppose you\u2019re watching a baseball game, and your favorite player is about to\nstep up to the plate. What is the probability that he will get a hit?\nIn this case, the sample space is {hit, not a hit}. That doesn\u2019t mean that the probability of a hit is , since those outcomes\naren\u2019t equally likely. The theoretical method simply can\u2019t be used in this situation. Instead, we might look at the player\u2019s\nstatistics up to this point in the season, and see that he has 122 hits in 531 opportunities. So, we might think that the\nprobability of a hit in the next plate appearance would be about . When we use the outcomes of previous\nreplications of an experiment to assign a probability to the next replication, we\u2019re defining anempirical probability.\nEmpirical probability is assigned using the outcomes of previous replications of an experiment by finding the ratio of the\nnumber of times in the previous replications the event occurred to the total number of previous replications.\nEmpirical probabilities aren\u2019t exact, but when the number of previous replications is large, we expect them to be close.\nAlso, if the previous runs of the experiment are not conducted under the exact set of circumstances as the one we\u2019re\ninterested in, the empirical probability is less reliable. For instance, in the case of our favorite baseball player, we might\ntry to get a better estimate of the probability of a hit by looking only at his history against left- or right-handed pitchers\n(depending on the handedness of the pitcher he\u2019s about to face).\nWHO KNEW?\nProbability and Statistics\nOne of the broad uses of statistics is called statistical inference, where statisticians use collected data to make a guess\n(or inference) about the population the data were collected from. Nearly every tool that statisticians use for inference\nis based on probability. Not only is the method we just described for finding empirical probabilities one type of\nstatistical inference, but some more advanced techniques in the field will give us an idea of how close that empirical\nprobability might be to the actual probability!\nEXAMPLE7.20\nFinding Empirical Probabilities\nAssign an empirical probability to the following events:\n1. Jose is on the basketball court practicing his shots from the free throw line. He made 47 out of his last 80 attempts.\nWhat is the probability he makes his next shot?\n2. Amy is about to begin her morning commute. Over her last 60 commutes, she arrived at work 12 times in under half\nan hour. What is the probability that she arrives at work in 30 minutes or less?\n3. Felix is playingYahtzeewith his sister. Felix won 14 of the last 20 games he played against her. How likely is he to win\nthis game?\nSolution\n1. Since Jose made 47 out of his last 80 attempts, assign this event an empirical probability of .\n2. Amy completed the commute in under 30 minutes in 12 of the last 60 commutes, so we can estimate her probability\nof making it in under 30 minutes this time at .\n3. Since Felix has won 14 of the last 20 games, assign a probability for a win this time of .\nYOUR TURN7.20\n1. Jessie is in charge of quality control at a factory manufacturing SUVs. Today, she\u2019s checking the placement of the\ntaillight housing. Of the last thousand units off the line, 13 had faulty placement. What empirical probability\nmight Jesse assign to the next vehicle coming off the line having bad placement? 758 7 \u2022 Probability\nWORK IT OUT\nBuffon\u2019s Needle\nA famous early question about probability (posed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century) had\nto do with the probability that a needle dropped on a floor finished with wooden slats would lay across one of the\nseams. If the distance between the slats is exactly the same length as the needle, then it can be shown using calculus\nthat the probability that the needle crosses a seam is . Using toothpicks or matchsticks (or other uniformly long and\nnarrow objects), assign an empirical probability to this experiment by drawing parallel lines on a large sheet of paper\nwhere the distance between the lines is equal to the length of your dropping object, then repeatedly dropping the\nobjects and noting whether the object touches one of the lines. Once you have your empirical probability, take its\nreciprocal and multiply by 2. Is the result close to ?\nMethod 3: Subjective Probability\nIn cases where theoretical probability can\u2019t be used and we don\u2019t have prior experience to inform an empirical\nprobability, we\u2019re left with one option: using our instincts to guess at asubjective probability. A subjective probability is\nan assignment of a probability to an event using only one\u2019s instincts.\nSubjective probabilities are used in cases where an experiment can only be run once, or it hasn\u2019t been run before.\nBecause subjective probabilities may vary widely from person to person and they\u2019re not based on any mathematical\ntheory, we won\u2019t give any examples. However, it\u2019s important that we be able to identify a subjective probability when we\nsee it; they will in general be far less accurate than empirical or theoretical probabilities.\nEXAMPLE7.21\nDistinguishing among Theoretical, Empirical, and Subjective Probabilities\nClassify each of the following probabilities as theoretical, empirical, or subjective.\n1. An eccentric billionaire is testing a brand new rocket system. He says there is a 15% chance of failure.\n2. With 4 seconds to go in a close basketball playoff game, the home team need 3 points to tie up the game and send\nit to overtime. A TV commentator says that team captain should take the final 3-point shot, because he has a 38%\nchance of making it (greater than every other player on the team).\n3. Felix is losing hisYahtzeegame against his sister. He has one more chance to roll 2 dice; he\u2019ll win the game if they\nboth come up 4. The probability of this is about 2.8%.\nSolution\n1. This experiment has never been run before, so the given probability is subjective.\n2. Presumably, the commentator has access to each player\u2019s performance statistics over the entire season. So, the\ngiven probability is likely empirical.\n3. Rolling 2 dice results in a sample space with equally likely outcomes. This probability is theoretical. (We\u2019ll learn how\nto calculate that probability later in this chapter.)\nYOUR TURN7.21\nClassify each of the following probabilities as theoretical, empirical, or subjective.\n1. You have entered a raffle with 500 entrants. Your probability of winning is 0.2%.\n2. Your little brother takes the bus to school each morning. On the first day of school, you believe that the\nprobability that the bus arrives between 7:15 AM and 7:30 AM is about 80%.\n3. Your little brother takes the bus to school each morning. On the last day of school, you believe that the\nprobability that the bus arrives between 7:15 AM and 7:30 AM is about 73%.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Basic Concepts of Probability 759\nWHO KNEW?\nBenford\u2019s Law\nIn 1938, Frank Benford published a paper (\u201cThe law of anomalous numbers,\u201d inProceedings of the American\nPhilosophical Society) with a surprising result about probabilities. If you have a list of numbers that spans at least a\ncouple of orders of magnitude (meaning that if you divide the largest by the smallest, the result is at least 100), then\nthe digits 1\u20139 are not equally likely to appear as the first digit of those numbers, as you might expect. Benford arrived\nat this conclusion using empirical probabilities; he found that 1 was about 6 times as likely to be the initial digit as 9\nwas!\nNew Probabilities from Old: Complements\nOne of the goals of the rest of this chapter is learning how to break down complicated probability calculations into easier\nprobability calculations. We\u2019ll look at the first of the tools we can use to accomplish this goal in this section; the rest will\ncome later.\nGiven an event , thecomplementof (denoted ) is the collection of all of the outcomes that arenotin . (This is\nlanguage that is taken from set theory, which you can learn more about elsewhere in this text.) Since every outcome in\nthe sample space either is or is not in , it follows that . So, if the outcomes in are equally likely,\nwe can compute theoretical probabilities and . Then, adding these last two equations, we get\nThus, if we subtract from both sides, we can conclude that . Though we performed this\ncalculation under the assumption that the outcomes in are all equally likely, the last equation is true in every situation.\nFORMULA\nHow is this helpful? Sometimes it is easier to compute the probability that an eventwon\u2019thappen than it is to compute\nthe probability that itwill. To apply this principle, it\u2019s helpful to review some tricks for dealing with inequalities. If an\nevent is defined in terms of an inequality, the complement will be defined in terms of the opposite inequality: Both the\ndirection and the inclusivity will be reversed, as shown in the table below.\nIf is defined with: then is defined with: 760 7 \u2022 Probability\nEXAMPLE7.22\nUsing the Formula for Complements to Compute Probabilities\n1. If you roll a standard 6-sided die, what is the probability that the result will be a number greater than one?\n2. If you roll two standard 6-sided dice, what is the probability that the sum will be 10 or less?\n3. If you flip a fair coin 3 times, what is the probability that at least one flip will come up tails?\nSolution\n1. Here, the sample space is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. It\u2019s easy enough to see that the probability in question is , because there\nare 5 outcomes that fall into the event \u201croll a number greater than 1.\u201d Let\u2019s also apply our new formula to find that\nprobability. Since is defined using the inequality , then is defined using . Since there\u2019s only one\noutcome (1) in , we have . Thus, .\n2. InExample 7.18, we found the following table of equally likely outcomes for rolling 2 dice (Figure 7.31):\nFigure7.31\nHere, the event is defined by the inequality . Thus, is defined by . There are three outcomes\nin : two 11s and one 12. Thus, .\n3. InExample 7.15, we found the sample space for this experiment consisted of these equally likely outcomes: {HHH,\nHHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}. Our event is defined by , so is defined by . The only outcome\nin is the first one on the list, where zero tails are flipped. So, .\nYOUR TURN7.22\n1. If you roll a pair of 4-sided dice with faces labeled 1 through 4, what is the probability that the sum of the\nresulting numbers will be greater than 3? Hint: You found this sample space in an earlier Your Turn.\nCheck Your Understanding\nYou have two coins: a nickel and a quarter. You flip them both. Find the probabilities of these events:\n22. Both come up heads.\n23. The quarter comes up heads.\n24. You get one heads and one tails.\n25. You get three tails.\nDecide whether the given probabilities were most likely derived theoretically, empirically, or subjectively.\n26.

So, Ashley says the probability of flipping heads on that coin is about 58%.\nIf you flip a fair coin 50 times, the probability of getting 20 or fewer heads is about 10.1% (a fact we\u2019ll learn how to verify\nlater).\n29. If is the event \u201cnumber of heads is 20 or fewer\u201d, describe the event using an inequality.\n30. Find .\nSECTION 7.5 EXERCISES\nFor the following exercises, we are considering two special 6-sided dice. Each face is labeled with a number and a letter:\nthe first die has faces 1A, 1B, 2A, 2C, 4A, 4E; the second has faces 1A, 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3C. Assume that each face has an\nequal probability of landing face up.\n1.

Calculate probabilities with permutations.\n2. Calculate probabilities with combinations.\nIn our earlier discussion of theoretical probabilities, the first step we took was to write out the sample space for the\nexperiment in question. For many experiments, that method just isn\u2019t practical. For example, we might want to find the\nprobability of drawing a particular 5-card poker hand. Since there are 52 cards in a deck and the order of cards doesn\u2019t\nmatter, the sample space for this experiment has possible 5-card hands. Even if we had the patience\nand space to write them all out, sorting through the results to find the outcomes that fall in our event would be just as\ntedious.\nLuckily, the formula for theoretical probabilities doesn\u2019t require us to know every outcome in the sample space; we just\nneed to know how many outcomes there are. In this section, we\u2019ll apply the techniques we learned earlier in the chapter\n(The Multiplication Rule for Counting, permutations, and combinations) to compute probabilities.\nUsing Permutations to Compute Probabilities\nRecall that we can use permutations to count how many ways there are to put a number of items from a list in order. If\nwe\u2019re looking at an experiment whose sample space looks like an ordered list, then permutations can help us to find the\nright probabilities.\nEXAMPLE7.23\nUsing Permutations to Compute Probabilities\n1. In horse racing, an exacta bet is one where the player tries to predict the top two finishers in particular race in order.\nIf there are 9 horses in a race, and a player decided to make an exacta bet at random, what is the probability that\nthey win?\n2. You are in a club with 10 people, 3 of whom are close friends of yours. If the officers of this club are chosen at\nrandom, what is the probability that you are named president and one of your friends is named vice president?\n3. A bag contains slips of paper with letters written on them as follows: A, A, B, B, B, C, C, D, D, D, D, E. If you draw 3\nslips, what is the probability that the letters will spell out (in order) the word BAD? 764 7 \u2022 Probability\nSolution\n1. Since order matters for this situation, we\u2019ll use permutations. How many different exacta bets can be made? Since\nthere are 9 horses and we must select 2 in order, we know there are possible outcomes. That\u2019s the size of\nour sample space, so it will go in the denominator of the probability. Since only one of those outcomes is a winner,\nthe numerator of the probability is 1. So, the probability of randomly selecting the winning exacta bet is .\n2. There are 10 people in the club, and 2 will be chosen to be officers. Since the order matters, there are\ndifferent ways to select officers. Next, we must figure out how many outcomes are in our event. We\u2019ll use the\nMultiplication Rule for Counting to find that number. There is only 1 choice for president in our event, and there are\n3 choices for vice president. So, there are outcomes in the event. Thus, the probability that you will serve\nas president with one of your friends as vice president is .\n3. There are 12 slips of paper in the bag, and 3 will be drawn. So, there are possible outcomes. Now, we\u2019ll\ncompute the number of outcomes in our event. The first letter drawn must be a B, and there are 3 of those. Next\nmust come an A (2 of those) and then a D (4 of those). Thus, there are outcomes in our event. So, the\nprobability that the letters drawn spell out the word BAD is .\nYOUR TURN7.23\n1. Another bag of letters contains C, C, C, C, D, D, I, I, I, T, T, T, Y, Y, Y, Y. What is the probability that 4 letters chosen\nat random will spell, in order, CITY?\nCombinations to Computer Probabilities\nIf the sample space of our experiment is one in which order doesn\u2019t matter, then we can use combinations to find the\nnumber of outcomes in that sample space.\nEXAMPLE7.24\nUsing Combinations to Compute Probabilities\n1. Palmetto Cash 5 is a game offered by the South Carolina Education Lottery. Players choose 5 numbers from the\nwhole numbers between 1 and 38 (inclusive); the player wins the jackpot of $100,000 if the randomizer selects those\nnumbers in any order. If you buy one ticket for this game, what is the probability that you win the top prize by\nchoosing all 5 winning numbers?\n2. There\u2019s a second prize in the Palmetto Cash 5 game that a player wins if 4 of the player's 5 numbers are among the\n5 winning numbers. What\u2019s the probability of winning the second prize?\n3. Scrabbleis a word-building board game. Players make hands of 7 letters by selecting tiles with single letters printed\non them blindly from a bag (2 tiles have nothing printed on them; these blanks can stand for any letter). Players use\nthe letters in their hands to spell out words on the board. Initially, there are 100 tiles in the bag. Of those, 44 are (or\ncould be) vowels (9 As, 12 Es, 9 Is, 8 Os, 4 Us, and 2 blanks; we\u2019ll treat Y as a consonant). What is the probability that\nyour initial hand has no vowels?\nSolution\n1. There are 38 numbers to choose from, and the order of the 5 we pick doesn\u2019t matter. So, there are\noutcomes in the sample space. Only one outcome is in our winning event, so the probability of winning is .\n2. As in part 1 of this example,, there are 501,492 outcomes in the sample space. The tricky part here is figuring out\nhow many outcomes are in our event. To qualify, the outcome must contain 4 of the 5 winning numbers, plus one\nlosing number. There are ways to choose the 4 winning numbers, and there are losing\nnumbers. So, using the Multiplication Rule for Counting, there are outcomes in our event. Thus, the\nprobability of winning the second prize is , which is about 0.00033.\n3. The number of possible starting hands is . There are consonants in the\nbag, so the number of all-consonant hands is .

In this card game, players are dealt a hand of two\ncards from a standard deck. The dealer\u2019s cards are dealt with the second card face up, so the order matters; the other\nplayers\u2019 hands are dealt entirely face down, so order doesn\u2019t matter. The goal of the game is to build a hand whose\npoint value is as close as possible to 21 without going over. The point values of each card are as follows: numbered\ncards are worth the number on the face (for example, is worth 8 points); jacks, queens, and kings are each worth 10\npoints, and aces are worth either 1 or 11 points (the player can choose). Players whose hands are worth less than 21\npoints may ask to be dealt additional cards one at a time until they either go over 21 points or they choose to stop.\n1. What is the probability that a player (not the dealer) is dealt an initial hand worth 21 points? This can only\nhappen with an ace and a card worth 10 points (10, J, Q, or K).\n2. What is the probability that the dealer is dealt an initial hand worth 21 points, with an ace showing?\n3. What is the probability that a player is dealt 2 cards worth 10 points each?\n4. What is the probability that a player is dealt an initial hand with an 8 and a 3?\n5. What is the probability that a player is dealt an initial hand with two 8s?\n6. What is the probability that a player is dealt 2 ?\n7. In some versions of the game, a player wins automatically if they draw a hand of 5 cards that doesn\u2019t go over 21\npoints. One way this can happen is if they draw 5 cards, all of which are A, 2, 3, or 4. What is the probability of\ndrawing 5 cards from that collection?\nIn horse racing, a trifecta bet is one where the player tries to predict the top three finishers in order.

At the beginning of the game, 1 card of each of the 3 types is secretly removed from the deck (the object of the\ngame is to identify those 3 cards). The remaining 18 cards are dealt out to the players. Assuming there are 3 players,\neach player gets 6 cards. Find the probabilities of a player being dealt hands with the given characteristics.\n23.

Compute odds.\n2. Determine odds from probabilities.\n3. Determine probabilities from odds.\nA particular lottery instant-win game has 2 million tickets available. Of those, 500,000 win a prize. If there are 500,000\nwinners, then it follows that there are 1,500,000 losing tickets. When we evaluate the risk associated with a game like\nthis, it can be useful to compare the number of ways to win the game to the number of ways to lose. In the case of this\ngame, we would compare the 500,000 wins to the 1,500,000 losses. In other words, there are 3 losing tickets for every\nwinning ticket. Comparisons of this type are the focus of this section.\nComputing Odds\nThe ratio of the number of equally likely outcomes in an event to the number of equally likely outcomesnotin the\nevent is called theodds for(orodds in favorof) the event. The opposite ratio (the number of outcomes not in the\nevent to the number in the event to the number in the event is called theodds againstthe event.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.7 \u2022 What Are the Odds? 767\nBoth odds and probabilities are calculated as ratios. To avoid confusion, we will always use fractions, decimals, or\npercents for probabilities, and we\u2019ll use colons to indicate odds. The rules for simplifying fractions apply to odds,\ntoo. Thus, the odds for winning a prize in the game described in the section opener are\nand the odds against winning a prize are .These would often be described in words as \u201cthe odds of winning are\none to three in favor\u201d or \u201cthe odds of winning are three to one against.\u201d.\nNotice that, while probabilities must always be between zero and one inclusive, odds can be any (non-negative)\nnumber, as we\u2019ll see in the next example.\nEXAMPLE7.25\nComputing Odds\n1. If you roll a fair 6-sided die, what are the odds for rolling a 5 or higher?\n2. If you roll two fair 6-sided dice, what are the odds against rolling a sum of 7?\n3.

The sample space for this experiment is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Two of those outcomes are in the event \u201croll a five or\nhigher,\u201d while four are not. So, the odds for rolling a five or higher are .\n2. InExample 7.18, we found the sample space for this experiment using the following table (Figure 7.34):\nFigure7.34\nThere are 6 outcomes in the event \u201croll a sum of 7,\u201d and there are 30 outcomes not in the event. So, the odds against\nrolling a 7 are .\n3. There are 13 in a standard deck, and others. So, the odds in favor of drawing a are .\n4. There are ways to draw 2 , and ways to draw 2 cards that arenotboth . So, the\nodds against drawing 2 are .\nYOUR TURN7.25\nYou roll a pair of 4-sided dice with faces labeled 1 through 4.\n1.

Consider again the instant-win game from thesection opener, with\n500,000 winning tickets out of 2,000,000 total tickets. If a player buys one ticket, the probability of winning is\n, and the probability of losing is .

Identify mutually exclusive events.\n2. Apply the Addition Rule to compute probability.\n3. Use the Inclusion/Exclusion Principle to compute probability.\nUp to this point, we have looked at the probabilities ofsimpleevents. Simple events are those with a single, simple\ncharacterization. Sometimes, though, we want to investigate more complicated situations. For example, if we are\nchoosing a college student at random, we might want to find the probability that the chosen student is a varsity athlete\norin a Greek organization. This is acompound event: there are two possible criteria that might be met. We might\ninstead try to identify the probability that the chosen student isbotha varsity athleteandin a Greek organization. In this\nsection and thenext, we\u2019ll cover probabilities of two types of compound events: those build using \u201cor\u201d and those built\nusing \u201cand.\u201d We\u2019ll deal with the former first.\nMutual Exclusivity\nBefore we get to the key techniques of this section, we must first introduce some new terminology. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re\ndrawing a card from a standard deck. We\u2019ll consider 3 events: is the event \u201cthe card is a ,\u201d is the event \u201cthe card is a\n10,\u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is a .\u201d If the card drawn is , then and didn\u2019t occur, but did. If the card drawn is\ninstead , then didn\u2019t occur, but both and did.\nWe can see from these examples that, if we are interested in several possible events, more than one of them can occur\nsimultaneously (both and , for example). But, if you think about all the possible outcomes, you can see that and\ncanneveroccur simultaneously; there are no cards in the deck that are both and . Pairs of events that cannot both\noccur simultaneously are calledmutually exclusive. Let\u2019s go through an example to help us better understand this\nconcept.\nEXAMPLE7.28\nIdentifying Mutually Exclusive Events\nDecide whether the following events are mutually exclusive. If they are not mutually exclusive, identify an outcome that\nwould result in both events occurring.\n1. You are about to roll a standard 6-sided die. is the event \u201cthe die shows an even number\u201d and is the event \u201cthe\ndie shows an odd number.\u201d\n2. You are about to roll a standard 6-sided die. is the event \u201cthe die shows an even number\u201d and is the event \u201cthe\ndie shows a number less than 4.\u201d\n3. You are about to flip a coin 4 times. is the event \u201cat least 2 heads are flipped\u201d and is the event \u201cfewer than 3 tails\nare flipped.\u201d 772 7 \u2022 Probability\nSolution\n1. Let\u2019s look at the outcomes for each event: and . There are no outcomes in common, so\nand are mutually exclusive.\n2. Again, consider the outcomes in each event: and . Since the outcome 2 belongs to both\nevents, these arenotmutually exclusive.\n3. Suppose the results of the 4 flips are HTTH. Then at least 2 heads are flipped, and fewer than 3 tails are flipped. That\nmeans that both and occurred, and so these events arenotmutually exclusive.\nYOUR TURN7.28\nSuppose you\u2019re about to draw one card from a deck containing only these 10 cards: , , , , , , ,\n, , . Decide whether these events are mutually exclusive:\n1. is the event \u201cthe card is an ace\u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is a king.\u201d\n2. is the event \u201cthe card is a \u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is an ace.\u201d\n3. is the event \u201cthe card is a \u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is a king.\u201d\nThe Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events\nIf two events are mutually exclusive, then we can use addition to find the probability that one or the other event occurs.\nFORMULA\nIf and are mutually exclusive events, then\n.\nWhy does this formula work? Let\u2019s consider a basic example. Suppose we\u2019re about to draw aScrabbletile from a bag\ncontaining A, A, B, E, E, E, R, S, S, U. What is the probability of drawing an E or an S? Since 3 of the tiles are marked with E\nand 2 are marked with S, there are 5 tiles that satisfy the criteria. There are ten tiles in the bag, so the probability is\n. Notice that the probability of drawing an E is and the probability of drawing an S is ; adding those\ntogether, we get . Look at the numerators in the fractions involved in the sum: the 3 represents the\nnumber of E tiles and the 2 is the number of S tiles. This is why the Addition Rule works: The total number of outcomes in\none event or the other is the sum of the numbers of outcomes in each of the individual events.\nEXAMPLE7.29\nUsing the Addition Rule\nFor each of the given pairs of events, decide if the Addition Rule applies. If it does, use the Addition Rule to find the\nprobability that one or the other occurs.\n1. You are rolling a standard 6-sided die. Event is \u201croll an even number\u201d and event is \u201croll a 3.\u201d\n2. You are drawing a card at random from a standard 52-card deck. Event is \u201cdraw a \u201d and event is \u201cdraw a king.\u201d\n3. You are rolling a pair of standard 6-sided dice. Event is \u201croll an odd sum\u201d and event is \u201croll a sum of 10.\u201d The\ntable we constructed inExample 7.18might help.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.8 \u2022 The Addition Rule for Probability 773\nFigure7.36\nSolution\n1. Since 3 is not an even number, these events are mutually exclusive. So, we can use the Addition Rule: since\nand , we get .\n2. If the card drawn is , then both and occur. So, they aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, and the Addition Rule doesn\u2019t\napply.\n3. Since 10 is not odd, these events are mutually exclusive. Since and , the Addition Rule gives\nus .\nYOUR TURN7.29\nSuppose you\u2019re about to draw one card from a deck containing only these 10 cards:\n, , , , , , , , , . If appropriate, use the Addition Rule to find the probability that one or\nthe other of these events occurs:\n1. is the event \u201cthe card is an ace\u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is a king.\u201d\n2. is the event \u201cthe card is a \u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is an ace.\u201d\n3. is the event \u201cthe card is a \u201d and is the event \u201cthe card is a king.\u201d\nFinding Probabilities When Events Aren\u2019t Mutually Exclusive\nLet\u2019s return to the example we used to explore the Addition Rule: We\u2019re about to draw aScrabbletile from a bag\ncontaining A, A, B, E, E, E, R, S, S, U. Consider these events: is \u201cdraw a vowel\u201d and is \u201cdraw a letter that comes after L\nin the alphabet.\u201d Since there are 6 vowels, . There are 4 tiles with letters that come after L alphabetically, so\n. What is ? If we blindly apply the Addition Rule, we get , which would mean that the\ncompound event or is certain. However, it\u2019s possible to draw a B, in which case neither nor happens. Where\u2019s\nthe error?\nThe events are not mutually exclusive: the outcome U belongs to both events, and so the Addition Rule doesn\u2019t apply.\nHowever, there\u2019s a way to extend the Addition Rule to allow us to find this probability anyway; it\u2019s called theInclusion/\nExclusion Principle. In this example, if we just add the two probabilities together, the outcome U is included in the sum\ntwice: It\u2019s one of the 6 outcomes represented in the numerator of , and it\u2019s one of the 4 outcomes represented in the\nnumerator of . So, that particular outcome has been \u201cdouble counted.\u201d Since it has beenincludedtwice, we can get a\ntrue accounting byexcludingit once: .

(credit: \u201cdice\u201d by Ciar\u00e1n Archer/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Calculate conditional probabilities.\n2. Apply the Multiplication Rule for Probability to compute probabilities.\nBack inExample 7.18, we constructed the following table (Figure 7.38) to help us find the probabilities associated with\nrolling two standard 6-sided dice:\nFigure7.38\nFor example, 3 of these 36 equally likely outcomes correspond to rolling a sum of 10, so the probability of rolling a 10 is\n. However, if you choose to roll the dice one at a time, the probability of rolling a 10 will change after the first die\ncomes to rest. For example, if the first die shows a 5, then the probability of rolling a sum of 10 has jumped to \u2014the\nevent will occur if the second die also shows a 5, which is 1 of 6 equally likely outcomes for the second die. If instead the\nfirst die shows a 3, then the probability of rolling a sum of 10 drops to 0\u2014there are no outcomes for the second die that\nwill give us a sum of 10.\nUnderstanding how probabilities can shift as we learn new information is critical in the analysis of our second type of\ncompound events: those built with \u201cand.\u201d This section will explain how to compute probabilities of those compound\nevents.\nConditional Probabilities\nWhen we analyze experiments with multiple stages, we often update the probabilities of the possible final outcomes or\nthe later stages of the experiment based on the results of one or more of the initial stages. These updated probabilities\nare calledconditional probabilities. 778 7 \u2022 Probability\nIn other words, if is a possible outcome of the first stage in a multistage experiment, then the probability of an event\nconditional on (denoted , read \u201cthe probability of given \u201d) is the updated probability of under the\nassumption that occurred.\nIn the example that opened this section, we might consider rolling two dice as a multistage experiment: rolling one, then\nthe other. If we define to be the event \u201croll a sum of 10,\u201d to be the event \u201cfirst die shows 5,\u201d and to be the event\n\u201cfirst die shows 3,\u201d then we computed , , and .\nEXAMPLE7.31\nComputing Conditional Probabilities\n1.

You are about to draw 2 cards without replacement from a deck containing only these 10 cards: , , , ,\n, , , , , . We\u2019ll define the following events: is \u201cboth cards are the same rank,\u201d is \u201cfirst card is an\nace,\u201d and is \u201cfirst card is a king.\u201d Compute and .\n3. Jim\u2019s sock drawer contains 5 black socks and 3 blue socks. To avoid waking his partner, Jim doesn\u2019t want to turn the\nlights on, so he puts on 2 socks at random. Let be the event \u201cJim\u2019s 2 socks match,\u201d let be the event \u201cthe sock on\nJim\u2019s left foot is black,\u201d and let be the event \u201cthe sock on Jim\u2019s left foot is blue.\u201d Compute , , and\n.\nSolution\n1. Step 1.The sample space is {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}. The event consists of the first 4 of those\noutcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, and THH. Thus, .\nStep 2.Now, let\u2019s compute . We are assuming the result of the first flip is heads. That leaves us with 4\npossible outcomes: HHH, HHT, HTH, and HTT. Of those, April wins 3 (HHH, HHT, HTH) and loses one (HTT). So,\n.\nStep 3.If the result of the first flip is instead tails, the 4 possible outcomes are THH, THT, TTH, and TTT. Of those,\nApril wins 1 (THH) and loses 3 (THT, TTH, TTT). So, .\n2. Step 1.If the event happens, then 1 of the 4 aces is drawn first; the remaining cards in the deck are 3 aces, 2\nkings, 2 queens, and 2 jacks. In order for the event to occur, the second card drawn has to be an ace. Since there\nare 3 aces among the remaining 9 cards, .\nStep 2.If the event happens instead, then the first card drawn is a king. That leaves 4 aces, 1 king, 2 queens, and\n2 jacks in the deck. Under the assumption that the first card is a king, the event will occur only if the second card\nis also a king. Since only one of the remaining 9 cards is a king, we have .\n3. Step 1.We can view the event as a compound event using \u201cor\u201d: both socks are blue or both socks are black. Let\u2019s\ncompute the probability that both socks are blue using combinations. We\u2019re choosing 2 socks from a group of 8; 3 of\nthe 8 are blue. So, . Similarly, . Therefore, since\nthese events are mutually exclusive, we can use the Addition Rule:\n.\nStep 2.If the sock on Jim\u2019s left foot is black (i.e., occurred), then there are 4 remaining black socks of the 7 in the\ndrawer. So, .\nStep 3.If the sock on Jim\u2019s left foot is blue ( occurred), then there are 2 blue socks among the 7 remaining in the\ndrawer.

We stated at the time that two stages were dependent if the result of one stage affects the other stage.\nWe explained that dependence in terms of the sample space, but sometimes that dependence can be a little more\nsubtle; it\u2019s more properly understood in terms of conditional probabilities. Two stages of an experiment are\ndependent if for some outcome of the second stage and outcome of the first stage .\nWHO KNEW?\nProtecting Bombers in World War II\nIn his bookHow Not to Be Wrong, Jordan Ellenberg recounts this anecdote: During World War II, the American\nmilitary wanted to add additional armor plating to bomber aircraft, in order to reduce the chances that they get shot\ndown. So, they collected data on planes after returning from missions. The data showed that the fuselage, wings, and\nfuel system had many more bullet holes (per unit area) than the engine compartments, so the military brass wanted\nto add additional armor to the parts of the plane that were hit most often. Luckily, before they added the armor to the\nplanes, they asked for a second opinion. Abraham Wald, a Jewish mathematician who had fled the rising Nazi regime,\npointed out that it was far more important that the armor plating be added to areas where there werefewerbullet\nholes. Why? The planes they were studying had already completed their missions, so the military was essentially\nlooking at conditional probabilities: the probability of suffering a bullet strike,given thatthe plane made it back\nsafely. More bullet holes in an area on the plane indicated that was a region that wasn\u2019t as important for the plane\u2019s\nsurvival!\nCompound Events Using \u201cAnd\u201d and the Multiplication Rule\nFor multistage experiments, the outcomes of the experiment as a whole are often stated in terms of the outcomes of the\nindividual stages. Commonly, those statements are joined with \u201cand.\u201d For example, in the sock drawer example just\nabove, one outcome might be \u201cthe left sock is black and the right sock is blue.\u201d As with \u201cor\u201d compound events, these\nprobabilities can be computed with basic arithmetic.\nFORMULA\nMultiplication Rule for Probability: If and are events associated with the first and second stages of an experiment,\nthen .\nInThe Addition Rule for Probability, we considered probabilities of events connected with \u201cand\u201d in the statement of\nthe Inclusion/Exclusion Principle. These two scenarios are different; in the statement of the Inclusion/Exclusion\nPrinciple, the events connected with \u201cand\u201d are both events associated with thesamesingle-stage experiment (or the\nsame stage of a multistage experiment). In the Multiplication Rule, we\u2019re looking at events associated withdifferent\nstages of a multistage experiment.\nEXAMPLE7.32\nUsing the Multiplication Rule for Probability\nYou are president of a club with 10 members: 4 seniors, 3 juniors, 2 sophomores, and 1 first-year. You need to choose 2\nmembers to represent the club on 2 college committees. The first person selected will be on the Club Awards Committee\nand the second will be on the New Club Orientation Committee. The same person cannot be selected for both. You\ndecide to select these representatives at random. 780 7 \u2022 Probability\n1. What is the probability that a senior is chosen for both positions?\n2. What is the probability that a junior is chosen first and a sophomore is chosen second?\n3. What is the probability that a sophomore is chosen first and a senior is chosen second?\nSolution\n1. We need the probability that a senior is chosen first and a senior is chosen second. These are two stages of a\nmultistage experiment, so we\u2019ll apply the Multiplication Rule for Probability:\nSince there are 4 seniors among the 10 members, . Next, assuming a senior is\nchosen first, there are 3 seniors among the 9 remaining members. So,\n. Putting this all together, we get\n.\n2. There are 3 juniors among the 10 members, so . Assuming a junior is chosen first, there\nare 2 sophomores among the remaining 9 members, so . Thus,\nusing the Multiplication Rule for Probability, we have\n.\n3. The probability that a sophomore is chosen first is , and the probability that a senior is chosen second given\nthat a sophomore was chosen first is . Thus, using the Multiplication Rule for Probability, we have:\n.\nYOUR TURN7.32\nYou\u2019re drawing 2 cards in order from a deck containing only the cards , , , , , , , and .\nCompute the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\nWORK IT OUT\nThe Birthday Problem\nOne of the most famous problems in probability theory is the Birthday Problem, which has to do with shared\nbirthdays in a large group. To make the analysis easier, we\u2019ll ignore leap days, and assume that the probability of\nbeing born on any given date is . Now, if you have 366 people in a room, we\u2019re guaranteed to have at least one\npair of people who share a single birthday. Imagine filling the room by first admitting someone born on January 1,\nthen someone born on January 2, and so on\u2026 The 365th person admitted would be born on December 31. If you add\none more person to the room, that person\u2019s birthday wouldhaveto match someone else\u2019s.\nLet\u2019s look at the other end of the spectrum. If you choose two people at random, what is the probability that they\nshare a birthday? As with many probability questions, this is best addressed by find out the probability that they do\nnotshare a birthday. The first person\u2019s birthday can be anything (probability 1), and the second person\u2019s birthday can\nbe anything other than the first person\u2019s birthday (probability ). The probability that they havedifferentbirthdays\nis . So, the probability that they share a birthday is .\nWhat if we have three people? The probability that they all have different birthdays can be obtained by extending our\nprevious calculation: The probability that two people have different birthdays is , so if we add a third to the mix,\nthe probability that they have a different birthday from the other two is . So, the probability that all three have\ndifferent birthdays is , and thus the probability that there\u2019s a shared birthday in the group is\n.\nThe big question is this: How many people do we need in the room to have the probability of a shared birthday\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.9 \u2022 Conditional Probability and the Multiplication Rule 781\ngreater than ? Make a guess, then with a partner keep adding hypothetical people to the group and computing\nprobabilities until you get there!\nIt is often useful to combine the rules we\u2019ve seen so far with the techniques we used for finding sample spaces. In\nparticular, trees can be helpful when we want to identify the probabilities of every possible outcome in a multistage\nexperiment. The next example will illustrate this.\nEXAMPLE7.33\nUsing Tree Diagrams to Help Find Probabilities\nThe board gameClueuses a deck of 21 cards: 6 suspects, 6 weapons, and 9 rooms. Suppose you are about to draw 2\ncards from this deck. There are 6 possible outcomes for the draw: 2 suspects, 2 weapons, 2 rooms, 1 suspect and 1\nweapon, 1 suspect and 1 room, or 1 weapon and 1 room. What are the probabilities for each of these outcomes?\nSolution\nStep 1:Let\u2019s start by building a tree diagram that illustrates both stages of this experiment. Let\u2019s use S, W, and R to\nindicate drawing a suspect, weapon, and room, respectively (Figure 7.39).\nFigure7.39\nStep 2:We want to start computing probabilities, starting with the first stage. The probability that the first card is a\nsuspect is . The probability that the first card is a weapon is the same: . Finally, the probability that the first card\nis a room is . 782 7 \u2022 Probability\nStep 3:Let\u2019s incorporate those probabilities into our tree: label the edges going into each of the nodes representing the\nfirst-stage outcomes with the corresponding probabilities (Figure 7.40).\nFigure7.40\nNote that the sum of the probabilities coming out of the initial node is 1; this should always be the case for the\nprobabilities coming out of any node!\nStep 4:Let\u2019s look at the case where the first card is a suspect. There are 3 edges emanating from that node (leading to\nthe outcomes SS, SW, and SR). We\u2019ll label those edges with the appropriateconditionalprobabilities, under the\nassumption that the first card is a suspect. First, there are 5 remaining suspect cards among the 20 left in the deck, so\n. Using similar reasoning, we can compute\nand .\nStep 5:Checking our work, we see that the sum of these 3 probabilities is again equal to 1.

Here\u2019s how it\nworked: On the stage were three areas concealed by numbered curtains. The car was hidden behind one of the\ncurtains; the other two curtains hid worthless prizes (called \u201cZonks\u201d on the show). The contestant would guess which\ncurtain concealed the car. To build tension, Monty would then reveal what was behind one of theothercurtains, which\nwas always one of the Zonks (Since Monty knew where the car was hidden, he always had at least one Zonk curtain\nthat hadn\u2019t been chosen that he could reveal). Monty then turned to the contestant and asked: \u201cDo you want to stick\nwith your original choice, or do you want to switch your choice to the other curtain?\u201d What should the contestant do?\nDoes it matter?\nWith a partner or in a small group, simulate this game. You can do that with a small candy (the prize) hidden under\none of three cups, or with three playing cards (just decide ahead of time which card represents the \u201cGrand Prize\u201d).\nOne person plays the host, who knows where the prize is hidden. Another person plays the contestant and tries to\nguess where the prize is hidden. After the guess is made, the host should reveal a losing option that wasn\u2019t chosen by\nthe contestant. The contestant then has the option to stick with the original choice or switch to the other, unrevealed\noption. Play about 20 rounds, taking turns in each role and making sure that both contestant strategies (stick or\nswitch) are used equally often. After each round, make a note of whether the contestant chose \u201cstick\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d and\nwhether the contestant won or lost. Find the empirical probability of winning under each strategy. Then, see if you\ncan use tree diagrams to verify your findings.\nCheck Your Understanding\nFor the following exercises, you are rolling two 6-sided dice, each of which has 3 orange faces, 2 green faces, and 1 blue\nface.\n50.

(credit: \u201cbaseball game\u201d by Britt Reints/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Identify binomial experiments.\n2. Use the binomial distribution to analyze binomial experiments.\nIt\u2019s time for the World Series, which determines the champion for this season in Major League Baseball. The scrappy Los\nAngeles Angels are facing the powerhouse Cincinnati Reds. Computer models put the chances of the Reds winning any\nsingle game against the Angels at about 65%. The World Series, as its name implies, isn\u2019t just one game, though: it\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s known as a \u201cbest-of-seven\u201d contest: the teams play each other repeatedly until one team wins 4 games (which\ncould take up to 7 games total, if each team wins three of the first 6 matchups). If the Reds truly have a 65% chance of\nwinning a single game, then the probability that they win the series should be greater than 65%. Exactly how much\nbigger?\nIf you have the patience for it, you could use a tree diagram like we used inExample 7.33to trace out all of the possible\noutcomes, find all the related probabilities, and add up the ones that result in the Reds winning the series. Such a tree\ndiagram would have final nodes, though, so the calculations would be very tedious. Fortunately, we have tools\nat our disposal that allow us to find these probabilities very quickly. This section will introduce those tools and explain\ntheir use.\nBinomial Experiments\nThe tools of this section apply to multistage experiments that satisfy some pretty specific criteria. Before we move on to\nthe analysis, we need to introduce and explain those criteria so that we can recognize experiments that fall into this\ncategory. Experiments that satisfy each of these criteria are calledbinomial experiments. A binomial experiment is an\nexperiment with a fixed number of repeated independent binomial trials, where each trial has the same probability of\nsuccess.\nRepeated Binomial Trials\nThe first criterion involves the structure of the stages. Each stage of the experiment should be a replication of every\nother stage; we call these replicationstrials. An example of this is flipping a coin 10 times; each of the ten flips is a trial,\nand they all occur under the same conditions as every other. Further, each trial must have only two possible outcomes.\nThese two outcomes are typically labeled \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cfailure,\u201d even if there is not a positive or negative connotation\nassociated with those outcomes. Experiments with more than two outcomes in their sample spaces are sometimes\nreconsidered in a way that forces just two outcomes; all we need to do is completely divide the sample space into two\nparts that we can label \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cfailure.\u201d For example, your grade on an exam might be recorded as A, B, C, D, or F,\nbut we could instead think of the grades A, B, C, and D as \u201csuccess\u201d and a grade of F as \u201cfailure.\u201d Trials with only two\noutcomes are calledbinomial trials(the wordbinomialderives from Latin and Greek roots that mean \u201ctwo parts\u201d).\nIndependent Trials\nThe next criterion that we\u2019ll be looking for is independence of trials. Back inTree Diagrams, Tables, and Outcomes, we\nsaid that two stages of an experiment are independent if the outcome of one stage doesn\u2019t affect the other stage.\nIndependence is necessary for the experiments we want to analyze in this section.\nFixed Number of Trials\nNext, we require that the number of trials in the experiment be decided before the experiment begins. For example, we\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.10 \u2022 The Binomial Distribution 791\nmight say \u201cflip a coin 10 times.\u201d The number of trials there is fixed at 10. However, if we say \u201cflip a coin until you get 5\nheads,\u201d then the number of trials could be as low as 5, but theoretically it could be 50 or a 100 (or more)! We can\u2019t apply\nthe tools from this section in cases where the number of trials is indeterminate.\nConstant Probability\nThe next criterion needed for binomial experiments is related to the independence of the trials. We must make sure that\nthe probability of success in each trial is the same as the probability of success in every other trial.\nEXAMPLE7.34\nIdentifying Binomial Experiments\nDecide whether each of the following is a binomial experiment. For those that aren\u2019t, identify which criterion or criteria\nare violated.\n1. You roll a standard 6-sided die 10 times and write down the number that appears each time.\n2. You roll a standard 6-sided die 10 times and write down whether the die shows a 6 or not.\n3. You roll a standard 6-sided die until you get a 6.\n4. You roll a standard 6-sided die 10 times. On the first roll, we define \u201csuccess\u201d as rolling a 4 or greater. After the first\nroll, we define \u201csuccess\u201d as rolling a number greater than the result of the previous roll.\nSolution\n1. Since we\u2019re noting 1 of 6 possible outcomes, the trials are not binomial. So, this isn\u2019t a binomial experiment.\n2. We have 2 possible outcomes (\u201c6\u201d and \u201cnot 6\u201d), the trials are independent, the probability of success is the same\nevery time, and the number of trials is fixed. This is a binomial experiment.\n3. Since the number of trials isn\u2019t fixed (we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get our first 6 after 1 roll or 20 rolls or somewhere in\nbetween), this isn\u2019t a binomial experiment.\n4. Here, the probability of success might change with every roll (on the first roll, that probability is ; if the first roll is a\n6, the probability of success on the next roll is zero). So, this is not a binomial experiment.\nYOUR TURN7.34\nDecide whether the following experiments are binomial experiments:\n1. Draw a card from a well-shuffled deck, note its suit, and replace it. Repeat this process 5 times.\n2. Draw 5 cards from a well-shuffled deck and count the number of .\n3. Draw a card from a well-shuffled deck, note whether it is a or not, and replace it. Repeat this process 5\ntimes.\n4. Draw cards from a well-shuffled deck until you get a .\nThe Binomial Formula\nIf we flip a coin 100 times, you might expect the number of heads to be around 50, but you probably wouldn\u2019t be\nsurprised if the actual number of heads was 47 or 52. What is the probability that the number of heads is exactly 50? Or\nfalls between 45 and 55? It seems unlikely that we would get more than 70 heads. Exactly how unlikely is that?\nEach of these questions is a question about the number of successes in a binomial experiment (flip a coin 100 times,\n\u201csuccess\u201d is flipping heads). We could theoretically use the techniques we\u2019ve seen in earlier sections to answer each of\nthese, but the number of calculations we\u2019d have to do is astronomical; just building the tree diagram that represents this\nsituation is more than we could complete in a lifetime; it would have final nodes! To put that number\nin perspective, if we could draw 1,000 dots every second, and we started at the moment of the Big Bang, we\u2019d currently\nbe about 0.00000003% of the way to drawing out those final nodes. Luckily, there\u2019s a shortcut called the Binomial\nFormula that allows us to get around doing all those calculations!\nFORMULA\nBinomial Formula: Suppose we have a binomial experiment with trials and the probability of success in each trial is\n. Then: 792 7 \u2022 Probability\n.\nWe can use this formula to answer one of our questions about 100 coin flips. What is the probability of flipping exactly 50\nheads? In this case, , , and , so . Unfortunately,\nmany calculators will balk at this calculation; that first factor ( ) is an enormous number, and the other two factors\nare very close to zero. Even if your calculator can handle numbers that large or small, the arithmetic can create serious\nerrors in rounding off.\nTECH CHECK\nLuckily, spreadsheet programs have alternate methods for doing this calculation. In Google Sheets, we can use the\nBINOMDIST function to do this calculation for us. Open up a new sheet, click in any empty cell, and type\n\u201c=BINOMDIST(50,100,0.5,FALSE)\u201d followed by the Enter key. The cell will display the probability we seek; it\u2019s about 8%.\nLet\u2019s break down the syntax of that function in Google Sheets: enter \u201c=BINOMDIST( , , , FALSE)\u201d to find the\nprobability of successes in trials with probability of success .\nEXAMPLE7.35\nUsing the Binomial Formula\n1. Find the probability of rolling a standard 6-sided die 4 times and getting exactly one 6without using technology.\n2. Find the probability of rolling a standard 6-sided die 60 times and getting exactly ten 6s using technology.\n3. Find the probability of rolling a standard 6-sided die 60 times and getting exactly eight 6s using technology.\nSolution\n1. We\u2019ll apply the Binomial Formula, where , , and :\n2. Here, , , and . In Google Sheets, we\u2019ll enter \u201c=BINOMDIST(10, 60, 1/6, FALSE)\u201d to get our result:\n0.137.\n3. This experiment is the same as in Exercise 2 of this example; we\u2019re simply changing the number of successes from\n10 to 8. Making that change in the formula in Google Sheets, we get the probability 0.116.\nYOUR TURN7.35\nCompute the probabilities (rounded to 3 decimal places) of the following events related to rolling a standard 4-sided\ndie (with faces labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4):\n1. You roll the die 10 times and get exactly four 2s.\n2. You roll the die 20 times and get exactly four 2s.\n3. You roll the die 30 times and get exactly four 2s.\nThe Binomial Distribution\nIf we are interested in the probability of more than just a single outcome in a binomial experiment, it\u2019s helpful to think of\nthe Binomial Formula as a function, whose input is the number of successes and whose output is the probability of\nobserving that many successes. Generally, for a small number of trials, we\u2019ll give that function in table form, with a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.10 \u2022 The Binomial Distribution 793\ncomplete list of the possible outcomes in one column and the probability in the other.\nFor example, suppose Kristen is practicing her basketball free throws. Assume Kristen always makes 82% of those shots.\nIf she attempts 5 free throws, then the Binomial Formula gives us these probabilities:\nShots Made Probability\n0 0.000189\n1 0.004304\n2 0.0392144\n3 0.1786432\n4 0.4069096\n5 0.3707398\nA table that lists all possible outcomes of an experiment along with the probabilities of those outcomes is an example of\naprobability density function(PDF). A PDF may also be a formula that you can use to find the probability of any\noutcome of an experiment.\nBecause they refer to the same thing, some sources will refer to the Binomial Formula as the Binomial PDF.\nIf we want to know the probability of a range of outcomes, we could add up the corresponding probabilities. Going back\nto Kristen\u2019s free throws, we can find the probability that she makes 3 or fewer of her 5 attempts by adding up the\nprobabilities associated with the corresponding outcomes (in this case: 0, 1, 2, or 3):\nThe probability that the outcome of an experiment is less than or equal to a given number is called acumulative\nprobability. A table of the cumulative probabilities of all possible outcomes of an experiment is an example of a\ncumulative distribution function(CDF). A CDF may also be a formula that you can use to find those cumulative\nprobabilities.\nCumulative probabilities are always associated with events that are defined using .If other inequalities are used to\ndefine the event, we must restate the definition so that it uses the correct inequality.\nHere are the PDF and CDF for Kristen\u2019s free throws:\nShots Made Probability Cumulative\n0 0.000189 0.000189\n1 0.004304 0.004493\n2 0.0392144 0.0437073\n3 0.1786432 0.2223506\n4 0.4069096 0.6292602\n5 0.3707398 1 794 7 \u2022 Probability\nTECH CHECK\nGoogle Sheets can also compute cumulative probabilities for us; all we need to do is change the \u201cFALSE\u201d in the\nformulas we used before to \"TRUE.\"\nEXAMPLE7.36\nUsing the Binomial CDF\nSuppose we are about to flip a fair coin 50 times. Let represent the number of heads that result from those flips. Use\ntechnology to find the following:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nSolution\n1. The event here is defined by , which is the inequality we need to have if we want to use the Binomial CDF. In\nGoogle Sheets, we\u2019ll enter \u201c=BINOMDIST(22, 50, 0.5, TRUE)\u201d to get our answer: 0.2399.\n2. This event uses the wrong inequality, so we need to do some preliminary work. If , that means\n(because has to be a whole number). So, we\u2019ll enter \u201c=BINOMDIST(25, 50, 0.5, TRUE)\u201d to find\n.\n3. The inequality associated with this event is pointing in the wrong direction. If is the event , that means\nthat contains the outcomes {29, 30, 31, 32, 33, \u2026}. Thus, must contain the outcomes {\u2026, 25, 26, 27, 28}. In\nother words, is defined by . Since it uses , we can find using \u201c=BINOMDIST(28, 50, 0.5, TRUE)\u201d:\n0.8389 So, using the formula for probabilities of complements, we have\n4. As in part 3, this inequality is pointing in the wrong direction. If is the event , then contains the\noutcomes {20, 21, 22, 23, \u2026}. That means contains the outcomes {\u2026, 16, 17, 18, 19}, and so is defined by\n. So, we can find using \u201c=BINOMDIST(19, 50, 0.5, TRUE)\u201d: 0.0595. Finally, using the formula for\nprobabilities of complements, we get:\n5. If , that means we are interested in the outcomes {21, 22, 23, 24}. This doesn\u2019t look like any of the\nprevious situations, but there is a way to find this probability using the Binomial CDF. We need to put everything in\nterms of \u201cless than or equal to,\u201d so we\u2019ll first note that all of our outcomes are less than or equal to 24. But we don\u2019t\nwant to include values that are less than or equal to 20. So, we have three events: let be the event defined by\n(note that we\u2019re trying to find ). Let be defined by , and let be defined by . Of\nthese three events, contains the most outcomes. If occurs, then either or must have occurred. Moreover,\nand are mutually exclusive. Thus, , by the Addition Rule. Solving for the probability that we\nwant, we get\nYOUR TURN7.36\nYou are about to roll a standard 6-sided die 20 times.

Find the probabilities of the following events, rounded to 4 decimal places:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\nFinally, we can answer the question posed at thebeginning of this section. Remember that the Reds are facing the\nAngels in the World Series, which is won by the team who is first to win 4 games. The Reds have a 65% chance to win any\ngame against the Angels. So, what is the probability that the Reds win the World Series? At first glance, this is not a\nbinomial experiment: The number of games played is not fixed, since the series ends as soon as one team wins 4 games.\nHowever, we can extend this situation to a binomial experiment: Let\u2019s assume that 7 games are always played in the\nWorld Series, and the winner is the team who wins more games. In a way, this is what happens in reality; it\u2019s as though\nthe first team to lose 4 games (and thus cannot win more than the other team) forfeits the rest of their games. So, we\ncan treat the actual World Series as a binomial experiment with seven trials. If is the number of games won by the\nReds, the probability that the Reds win the World Series is . Using the techniques from the last example, we\nget .\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nAbraham de Moivre\nAbraham de Moivre was born in 1667 in France to a Protestant family. Though he was educated in Catholic schools,\nhe remained true to his faith; in 1687, he fled with his brother to London to escape persecution under the reign of\nKing Louis XIV. Once he arrived in England, he supported himself as a freelance math tutor while he conducted his\nown research. Among his interests was probability; in 1711, he published the first edition ofThe Doctrine of Chances:\nA Method of Calculating the Probabilities of Events in Play. This book was the second textbook on probability (after\nCardano\u2019sLiber de ludo aleae). De Moivre discovered an important connection between the binomial distribution and\nthenormal distribution(an important concept in statistics; we\u2019ll explore that distribution and its connection to the\nbinomial distribution in Chapter 8).

These bets have different probabilities of 798 7 \u2022 Probability\nwinning but also have different payouts. In general, the lower the probability of winning a bet is, the more money a\nplayer wins for that bet. With so many options, is there one bet that\u2019s \u201csmarter\u201d than the rest? What\u2019s the best play to\nmake at a roulette table? In this section, we\u2019ll develop the tools we need to answer these questions.\nExpected Value\nMany experiments have numbers associated with their outcomes. Some are easy to define; if you roll 2 dice, the sum of\nthe numbers showing is a good example. In some card games, cards have different point values associated with them;\nfor example, in some forms of the game rummy, aces are worth 15 points; 10s, jacks, queens, and kings are worth 10;\nand all other cards are worth 5. The outcomes of casino and lottery games are all associated with an amount of money\nwon or lost. These outcome values are used to find theexpected valueof an experiment: the mean of the values\nassociated with the outcomes that we would observe over a large number of repetitions of the experiment. (See\nConditional Probability and the Multiplication Rulefor more on means.)\nThat definition is a little vague; How many is \u201ca large number?\u201d In practice, it depends on the experiment; the number\nhas to be large enough that every outcome would be expected to appear at least a few times. For example, if we\u2019re\ntalking about rolling a standard 6-sided die and we note the number showing, a few dozen replications should be\nenough that the mean would be representative. Since the probability of each outcome is , we would expect to see each\noutcome about 8 times over the course of 48 replications. However, if we\u2019re talking about the Powerball lottery, where\nthe probability of winning the jackpot is about , we would need severalbillionreplications to ensure that every\noutcome appears a few times. Luckily, we can find the theoretical expected value before we even run the experiment the\nfirst time.\nFORMULA\nExpected Value: If represents an outcome of an experiment and represents the value of that outcome, then\nthe expected value of the experiment is:\n,\nwhere is the \u201csum,\u201d meaning we add up the results of the formula that follows over all possible outcomes.\nEXAMPLE7.37\nFinding Expected Values\nFind the expected values of the following experiments.\n1.

So, the expected value of a\nsingle roll of a die is 3.5.\n2. Back inExample 7.18, we made this table of all of the equally likely outcomes (Figure 7.47):\nFigure7.47\nStep 1:Let\u2019s useFigure 7.47to create the PDF for this experiment, as shown in the following table: 800 7 \u2022 Probability\nValue Probability\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nStep 2:We can multiply each row to find as shown in the following table:\nValue Probability\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.11 \u2022 Expected Value 801\nValue Probability\n11\n12\nStep 3:We can add the last column to get the expected value:\n.\nSo, the expected value is 7.\n3.

There are 3 events that we care about, so let\u2019s use those events in\nthe table below:\nEvent Probability\n{A}\n{10, J, Q, K}\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nStep 2:Let\u2019s add a column to the following table for the values of each event:\nEvent Probability Value\n{A} 15\n{10, J, Q, K} 10\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} 5\nStep 3:We\u2019ll add the column for the product of the values and probabilities to the table below:\nEvent Probability Value\n{A} 15\n{10, J, Q, K} 10\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} 5\nStep 4:We\u2019ll find the sum of the last column: .

Find the expected value of the number showing when you roll a special 6-sided die with faces {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8}.\n2. Find the expected value of the number of heads showing if you flip a coin 3 times.\n3. You are about to play a game, where you flip a coin 3 times. If all 3 flips result in heads, you win $20. If you get\n2 heads, you win $10. If you flip 1 or 0 heads, you win nothing. What is the expected value of your winnings?\nLet\u2019s make note of some things we can learn fromExample 7.37. First, as Exercises 1 and 3 demonstrate, the expected\nvalue of an experiment might not be a value that could come up in the experiment. Remember that the expected value is\ninterpreted as a mean, and the mean of a collection of numbers doesn\u2019t have to actually be one of those numbers.\nSecond, looking at Exercise 1, the expected value (3.5) was just the mean of the numbers on the faces of the die:\n. This is no accident! If we break that fraction up using the addition in the numerator, we get\n, which we can rewrite as . That\u2019s exactly the\ncomputation we did to find the expected value! In fact, expected values can always be treated as a special kind of mean\ncalled aweighted mean, where the weights are the probabilities associated with each value. When the probabilities are\nall equal, the weighted mean is just the regular mean.\nInterpreting Expected Values\nAs we noted, the expected value of an experiment is the mean of the values we would observe if we repeated the\nexperiment a large number of times. (This interpretation is due to an important theorem in the theory of probability\ncalled the Law of Large Numbers.) Let\u2019s use that to interpret the results of theprevious example.\nEXAMPLE7.38\nInterpreting Expected Values\nInterpret the expected values of the following experiments.\n1. Roll a standard 6-sided die and note the number showing.\n2. Roll 2 standard 6-sided dice and note the sum of the numbers showing.\n3. Draw a card from a well-shuffled standard deck of cards and note itsRummyvalue (15 for aces; 10 for tens, jacks,\nqueens, and kings; 5 for everything else).\nSolution\n1. If you roll a standard 6-sided die many times, the mean of the numbers you roll will be around 3.5.\n2. If you roll a pair of standard 6-sided dice many times, the mean of the sums of the numbers you roll will be about 7.\n3. If you draw a card from a well-shuffled deck many times, the mean of theRummyvalues of the cards would be\naround 7.3.\nYOUR TURN7.38\n1. Interpret the expected value of the number showing when you roll a special 6-sided die with faces {1, 1, 2, 3,\n5, 8}.\n2. Interpret the expected value of the number of heads showing if you flip a coin 3 times.\n3. You are about to play a game where you flip a coin 3 times. If all 3 flips result in heads, you win $20. If you get\n2 heads, you win $10. If you flip 1 or 0 heads, you win nothing. Interpret the expected value of your winnings.\nWHO KNEW?\nPascal\u2019s Wager\nThe French scholar Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) was among the earliest mathematicians to study probabilities, and was\nthe first to accurately describe and compute expected values. In his bookPens\u00e9es(Thoughts), he turned the analysis\nof expected values to his belief in the Christian God. He said that there is no way for people to establish the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.11 \u2022 Expected Value 803\nprobability that God exists, but since the \u201cwinnings\u201d on a bet that God exists (and that you then lead your life\naccordingly) are essentially infinite, the expected value of taking that bet is always positive, no matter how unlikely it\nis that God exists.\nUsing Expected Value\nNow that we know how to find and interpret expected values, we can turn our attention to using them. Suppose\nsomeone offers to play a game with you. If you roll a die and get a 6, you get $10. However, if you get a 5 or below, you\nlose $1. Is this a game you\u2019d want to play? Let\u2019s look at the expected value: The probability of winning is and the\nprobability of losing is , so the expected value is . That means, on average, you\u2019ll\ncome out ahead by about 83 cents every time you play this game. It\u2019s a great deal! On the other hand, if the winnings for\nrolling a 6 drop to $3, the expected value becomes , meaning you should expect to\nlose about 33 cents on average for every time you play. Playing that game is not a good idea! In general, this is how\ncasinos and lottery corporations make money: Every game has a negative expected value for the player.\nWHO KNEW?\nExpected Values in Football\nIn the 21st century, data analytics tools have revolutionized the way sports are coached and played. One tool in\nparticular is used in football at crucial moments in the game. When a team faces a fourth down (the last possession in\na series of four possessions, a fairly common occurrence), the coach faces a decision: Run one play to try to gain a\ncertain number of yards, or kick the ball away to the other team. Here\u2019s the interesting part of the decision: If the\nteam \u201cgoes for it\u201d and runs the play and they are successful, then they keep possession of the ball and can continue in\ntheir quest to score more points. If they are unsuccessful, then they lose possession of the ball, giving the other team\nan opportunity to score points. If, instead, the team punts, or kicks the ball away, then the other team gets possession\nof the ball, but in a worse position for them than if the original team goes for it and fails. To analyze this situation,\ndata analysts have generated empirical probabilities for every fourth down situation, and computed the expected\nvalue (in terms of points) for each decision. Coaches frequently use those calculations when they decide which option\nto take!\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nPierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal\nIn 1654, a French writer and amateur mathematician named Antoine Gombaud (who called himself the Chevalier du\nM\u00e9re) reached out to his gambling buddy Blaise Pascal to answer a question that he\u2019d read about called the \u201cproblem\nof points.\u201d The question goes like this: Suppose you\u2019re playing a game that is scored using points, and the first person\nto earn 5 points is the winner. The game is interrupted with the score 4 points to 2. If the winner stood to win $100,\nhow should the prize money be divided between the players? Certainly the person who is 1 point away from victory\nshould get more, buthow muchmore?\nWe have developed tools in this section to answer this question. At its heart, it\u2019s a question about conditional\nprobabilities and expected value. At the time that Pascal first started thinking about it, though, those ideas hadn\u2019t yet\nbeen invented. Pascal reached out to a colleague named Pierre de Fermat, and over the course of a couple of months,\ntheir correspondence with each other would eventually solve the problem. In the process, they first described\nconditional probabilities and expected values!\nApart from their work in probability, these men are famous for other work in mathematics (and, in Pascal\u2019s case,\nphilosophy and physics). Fermat is remembered for his work in geometry and in number theory. After his death, the\nstatement of what came to be called \u201cFermat\u2019s Last Theorem\u201d was discovered scribbled in the margin of a book, with\nthe note that Fermat had discovered a \u201cmarvelous proof that this margin is too small to contain.\u201d The theorem says\nthat any equation of the form has no positive integer solutions if . No proof of that theorem was 804 7 \u2022 Probability\ndiscovered until 1994, when Andrew Wiles used computers and new branches of geometry to finally prove the\ntheorem!\nPascal is remembered for the \u201carithmetical triangle\u201d that is named for him (though he wasn\u2019t the first person to\ndiscover it; see thesection on the binomial distributionfor more), as well as work in geometry. In physics, Pascal\nworked on hydrodynamics and air pressure (the SI unit for pressure is named for him), and in philosophy, Pascal\nadvocated for a mathematical approach to philosophical problems.\nEXAMPLE7.39\nUsing Expected Values\nIn the casino game keno, a machine chooses at random 20 numbers between 1 and 80 (inclusive) without replacement.\nPlayers try to predict which numbers will be chosen. Players don\u2019t try to guess all 20, though; generally, they\u2019ll try to\npredict between 1 and 10 of the chosen numbers. The amount won depends on the number of guesses they made and\nthe number of guesses that were correct.\n1. At one casino, a player can try to guess just 1 number. If that number is among the 20 selected, the player wins $2;\notherwise, the player loses $1. What is the expected value?\n2. At the same casino, if a player makes 2 guesses and they\u2019re both correct, the player wins $14; otherwise, the player\nloses $1. What is the expected value?\n3. Players can also make 3 guesses. If 2 of the 3 guesses are correct, the player wins $1. If all 3 guesses are correct, the\nplayer wins $42. Otherwise, the player loses $1. What is the expected value?\n4. Which of these games is the best for the player? Which is the best for the casino?\nSolution\n1. There are 20 winning numbers out of 80, so if we try to guess one of them, the probability of guessing correctly is\n. The probability of losing is then , and so the expected value is .\n2. There are winning choices out of total ways to choose 2 numbers. So, the probability of\nwinning is and the probability of losing is . So, the expected value of the game is\n.\n3. Step 1:Let\u2019s start with the big prize. There are ways to correctly guess 3 winning numbers out of\nways to guess three numbers total. That means the probability of winning the big prize is\n.\nStep 2:Let\u2019s find the probability of the second prize. The denominator is the same: 82,160. Let\u2019s figure out the\nnumerator. To win the second prize, the player must pick 2 of the 20 winning numbers and one of the 60 losing\nnumbers. The number of ways to do that can be found using the Multiplication Rule for Counting: there are\nways to pick 2 winning numbers and 60 ways to pick 1 losing number, so there are\nways to win the second prize. So, the probability of winning that second prize is .\nStep 3:Since the overall probability of winning is , the probability of losing must\nbe . So, the expected value is .\n4. The bet that\u2019s the best for the player is the one with the highest expected value for the player, which is guessing two\nnumbers. The best one for the casino is the one with the lowest expected value for the player, which is guessing one\nnumber.\nYOUR TURN7.39\nThe casino game craps involves rolling 2 standard 6-sided dice.

This amount was the 23rd highest in the league at the time. How did the\nteam\u2019s management decide on her salary? They likely considered some intangible qualities, like her leadership skills.\nHowever, much of their deliberations probably took into account her performance on the court. For example, Parker led\nthe league in rebounds in the 2020 season (214 of them) and scored 14.7 points per game (which ranked her 18th\namong all WNBA players). Further, Parker brought 13 seasons of experience to the team. All of these factors played a\nrole in deciding the terms of her contract.\nEstimating the value of one variable (like salary) based on other, measurable variables (points per game, experience,\nrebounds, etc.) is among the most important applications of statistics, which is the mathematical field devoted to\ngathering, organizing, summarizing, and making decisions based on data. 816 8 \u2022 Statistics\n8.1 Gathering and Organizing Data\nFigure8.2Surveys are commonly used to gather data. (credit: \u201csurvey\u201d by Donnell King/Flickr, CC0 1.0 Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Distinguish among sampling techniques.\n2. Organize data using an appropriate method.\n3. Create frequency distributions.\nWhen a polling organization wants to try to establish which candidate will win an upcoming election, the first steps are\nto write questions for the survey and to choose which people will be asked to respond to the survey. These can seem like\nsimple steps, but they have far-reaching implications in the analysis the pollsters will later carry out. The process by\nwhichsamples(or groups ofunitsfrom which we collect data) are chosen can strongly affect thedatathat are collected.\nUnits are anything that can be measured or surveyed (such as people, animals, objectives, or experiments) and data are\nobservations made on units.\nOne of the most famous failures of good sampling occurred in the first half of the twentieth century.The Literary Digest\nwas among the most respected magazines of the early twentieth century. Despite the name, theDigestwas a weekly\nnewsmagazine. Starting in 1916, theDigestconducted a poll to try to predict the winner of each US Presidential election.\nFor the most part, their results were good; they correctly predicted the outcome of all five elections between 1916 and\n1932. In 1936, the incumbent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt faced Kansas governor Alf Landon, and once again the\nDigestran their famous poll, with results published the week before the election. Their conclusion? Landon would win in\na landslide, 57% to 43%. Once the actual votes had been counted, though, Roosevelt ended up with 61% of the popular\nvote, 18% more than the poll predicted. What went wrong?\nThe short answer is that the people who were chosen to receive the survey (over ten million of them!) were not a good\nrepresentation of thepopulationof voting adults. The sample was chosen using theDigest'sown base of subscribers as\nwell as publicly available lists of people that were likely adults (and therefore eligible to vote), mostly phone books and\nvehicle registration records. The pollsters then mailed every single person on these lists a survey. Around a quarter of\nthose surveys were returned; this constituted the sample that was used to make theDigest\u2019s disastrously incorrect\nprediction. However, theDigestmade an error in failing to consider that the election was happening during the Great\nDepression, and only the wealthy had disposable income to spend on telephone lines, automobiles, and magazine\nsubscriptions. Thus, only the wealthy were sent theDigest\u2019s survey. Since Roosevelt was extremely popular among\npoorer voters, many of Roosevelt\u2019s supporters were excluded from theDigest\u2019s sample.\nAnother more complicated factor was the low response rate; only around 25% of the surveys were returned. This created\nwhat\u2019s called a non-response bias.\nSampling and Gathering Data\nTheDigest'sfailure highlights the need for what is now considered the most important criterion for sampling:\nrandomness. This randomness can be achieved in several ways. Here we cover some of the most common.\nAsimple random sampleis chosen in a way that every unit in the population has an equal chance of being selected,\nand the chances of a unit being selected do not depend on the units already chosen. An example of this is choosing a\ngroup of people by drawing names out of a hat (assuming the names are well-mixed in the hat).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.1 \u2022 Gathering and Organizing Data 817\nAsystematic random sampleis selected from an ordered list of the population (for example, names sorted\nalphabetically or students listed by student ID). First, we decide what proportion of the population will be in our sample.\nWe want to express that proportion as a fraction with 1 in the numerator. Let\u2019s call that numberD. Next, we\u2019ll choose a\nrandom number between one andD. The unit at that position will go into our sample. We\u2019ll find the rest of our sample by\nchoosing everyDth unit in the list, starting with our random number.\nTo walk through an example, let\u2019s say we want to sample 2% of the population: . (Note: If the number in\nthe denominator isn\u2019t a whole number, we can just round it off. This part of the process doesn\u2019t have to be precise.) We\ncan then use a random number generator to find a random number between 1 and 50; let's use 31. In our example, our\nsample would then be the units in the list at positions 31, 81 (31 + 50), 131 (81 + 50), and so forth.\nAstratified sampleis one chosen so that particular groups in the population are certain to be represented. Let\u2019s say you\nare studying the population of students in a large high school (where the grades run from 9th to 12th), and you want to\nchoose a sample of 12 students. If you use a simple or systematic random sample, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that\nyou\u2019ll miss one grade completely. In a stratified sample, you would first divide the population into groups (thestrata),\nthen take a random sample within eachstratum(that\u2019s the singular form of \u201cstrata\u201d). In the high school example, we\ncould divide the population into grades, then take a random sample of three students within each grade. That would get\nus to the 12 students we need while ensuring coverage of each grade.\nAcluster sampleis a sample where clusters of units are chosen at random, instead of choosing individual units. For\nexample, if we need a sample of college students, we may take a list of all the course sections being offered at the\ncollege, choose three of them at random (the sections are the clusters), and then survey all the students in those\nsections. A sample like this one has the advantage of convenience: If the survey needs to be administered in person,\nmany of your sample units will be located in one place at the same time.\nEXAMPLE8.1\nRandom Sampling\nFor each of the following situations, identify whether the sample is a simple random sample, a systematic random\nsample, a stratified random sample, a cluster random sample, or none of these.\n1. A postal inspector wants to check on the performance of a new mail carrier, so she chooses four streets at random\namong those that the carrier serves. Each household on the selected streets receives a survey.\n2. A hospital wants to survey past patients to see if they were satisfied with the care they received. The administrator\nsorts the patients into groups based on the department of the hospital where they were treated (ICU, pediatrics, or\ngeneral), and selects patients at random from each of those groups.\n3. A quality control engineer at a factory that makes smartphones wants to figure out the proportion of devices that\nare faulty before they are shipped out. The phones are currently packed in boxes for shipping, each of which holds\n20 devices. The engineer wants to sample 100 phones, so he selects five crates at random and tests every phone in\nthose five crates.\n4. A newspaper reporter wants to write a story on public perceptions on a project that will widen a congested street.\nShe stands on the side of the street in question and interviews the first five people she sees there.\n5. An executive at a streaming video service wants to know if her subscribers would support a second season of a new\nshow. She gets a list of all the subscribers who have watched at least one episode of the show, and uses a random\nnumber generator to select a sample of 50 people from the list.\n6. An agent for a state\u2019s Department of Revenue is in charge of selecting 100 tax returns for audit. He has a list of all of\nthe returns eligible for audit (about 12,000 in all), sorted by the taxpayer\u2019s ID number. He asks a computer to give\nhim a random number between 1 and 120; it gives him 15. The agent chooses the 15th, 135th, 255th, 375th, and\nevery 120th return after that to be audited.\nSolution\nTo decide which type of random sample is being used in each of these, we need to focus on how the randomization is\nbeing incorporated.\n1. The surveys are being given to households, so households are the units in this case. But households aren\u2019t being\nchosen randomly; instead,streetsare being chosen at random. These form clusters of units, so this is a cluster\nrandom sample.\n2. In this case, the administrator isn\u2019t selecting patients at random from the entire list of patients. Instead, she is\nchoosing at random from the patients who were in each of the departments (ICU, pediatrics, general) separately.\nThe departments formstrata, so this is a stratified random sample. 818 8 \u2022 Statistics\n3. The engineer is testing whether the phones are faulty, so those are the units. But the random process is being used\nto select thecratesof phones. Those crates form clusters, so this is a cluster random sample.\n4. The reporter isn\u2019t using a random process at all, so this sample doesn\u2019t belong to any of the types we have been\ntalking about. A sample like this one is sometimes described as aconvenience sample, and shouldn\u2019t be used in a\nstatistical setting.\n5. The executive is choosing her sample completely at random from the full population, so this is a simple random\nsample.\n6. The agent is choosing from the full population, but is only choosing the first unit for the sample at random; the rest\nare chosen by skipping down the list systematically. Thus, this is a systematic random sample.\nYOUR TURN8.1\nFor each of the following situations, identify whether the sample is a simple random sample, a systematic random\nsample, a stratified random sample, a cluster random sample, or none of these.\n1. The chairperson of the University Chess Club is trying to decide on a time for the club\u2019s regular meetings, so\nshe emails all of the members of the club to find their preferences.\n2. The registrar at a small college wants to use a survey to determine if their office could do a better job of\nserving students. They choose three students at random from each major to take the survey.\n3. A civic club is organizing a raffle as a fundraiser.

(credit:\n\"George Gallup at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., 1969\" by Bernard Gotfryd/Library of Congress Prints &\nPhotographs Division, public domain)\nGeorge Gallup (1901\u20131984) rose to fame in 1936 when his prediction of the percentage of the vote going to each\ncandidate in that year\u2019s U.S. Presidential election was more accurate than the one published inLiterary Digest, and he\ndid so using a sample that was much smaller than theDigest. He even took it one step farther, predicting with high\naccuracy the erroneous results of the poll that theLiterary Digestwould end up publishing! Gallup\u2019s theories on public\nopinion polling essentially created that field. In 1948, Gallup\u2019s reputation took a bit of a hit, when he famously, but\nincorrectly, predicted that Thomas Dewey would beat incumbent Harry Truman in that year\u2019s Presidential election.\nOver the following decades, however, public trust in Gallup\u2019s polls recovered and even steadily increased. The\ncompany Gallup founded(https://openstax.org/r/Gallup)continues to conduct daily public opinion polls, as well as\nprovides consulting services for businesses.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.1 \u2022 Gathering and Organizing Data 819\nOrganizing Data\nOnce data have been collected, we turn our attention to analysis. Before we analyze, though, it\u2019s useful to reorganize the\ndata into a format that makes the analysis easier. For example, if our data were collected using a paper survey, ourraw\ndataare all broken down by respondent (represented by an individual response sheet). To perform an analysis on all the\nresponses to an individual question, we need to first group all the responses to each question together. The way we\norganize the data depends on the type of data we\u2019ve collected.\nThere are two broad types of data: categorical and quantitative.Categorical dataclassifies the unit into a group (or\ncategory). Examples of categorical data include a response to a yes-or-no question, or the color of a person\u2019s eyes.\nQuantitative datais a numerical measure of a property of a unit. Examples of quantitative data include the time it takes\nfor a rat to run through a maze or a person\u2019s daily calorie intake. We\u2019ll look at each type of data in turn when considering\nhow best to organize.\nCategorical Data Organization\nThe best way to organize categorical data is using acategorical frequency distribution. A categorical frequency\ndistribution is a table with two columns. The first contains all the categories present in the data, each listed once. The\nsecond contains thefrequenciesof each category, which are just a count of how often each category appears in the data.\nEXAMPLE8.2\nCreating a Categorical Frequency Distribution\nA teacher records the responses of the class (28 students) on the first question of a multiple choice quiz, with five\npossible responses (A, B, C, D, and E):\nA A C A B B A E A C A A A C\nE A B A A C A B E E A A C C\nCreate a categorical frequency distribution that organizes the responses.\nSolution\nStep 1:For each possible response, count the number of times that response appears in the data. In the responses for\nthis class, \u201cA\u201d appears 14 times, \u201cB\u201d 4 times, \u201cC\u201d 6 times, \u201cD\u201d 0 times, and \u201cE\u201d 4 times.\nStep 2:Make a table with two columns. The first column should be labeled so that the reader knows what the responses\nmean, and the second should be labeled \u201cFrequency.\u201d\nResponse to First Question Frequency\nA 14\nB 4\nC 6\nD 0\nE 4\nStep 3:Check your work. If you add up your frequencies, you should get the same number as the total number of\nresponses. Twenty-eight students answered that first question, and . 820 8 \u2022 Statistics\nYOUR TURN8.2\n1. Students in a statistics class who were asked to provide their majors provided the data below:\nUndecided Biology Biology Sociology\nPolitical Science Sociology Undecided Undecided\nUndecided Biology Biology Education\nBiology Biology Political Science Political Science\nCreate a categorical frequency distribution to organize these responses.\nQuantitative Data\nWe have a couple of options available for organizing quantitative data. If there are just a few possible responses, we can\ncreate a frequency distribution just like the ones we made for categorical data above. For example, if we\u2019re surveying a\ngroup of high school students and we ask for each student\u2019s age, we\u2019ll likely only get whole-number responses between\n13 and 19. Since there are only around seven (and likely fewer) possible responses, we can treat the data as if they\u2019re\ncategorical and create a frequency distribution as before.\nEXAMPLE8.3\nCreating a Quantitative Frequency Distribution\nAttendees of a conflict resolution workshop are asked how many siblings they have. The responses are as follows:\n1 0 1 1 2 0 3 1 1 4 1 2 0 1 3\n1 2 1 2 4 1 0 1 3 0 1 2 2 1 5\nCreate a frequency distribution to organize the responses.\nSolution\nStep 1:Count the number of times you see each unique response: \u201c0\u201d appears 5 times, \u201c1\u201d appears 13 times, \u201c2\u201d appears\n6 times, \u201c3\u201d appears 3 times, \u201c4\u201d appears twice, and \u201c5\u201d appears once.\nStep 2:Make a table with two columns. The first column should be labeled so that the reader knows what the responses\nmean, and the second should be labeled \u201cFrequency.\u201d Then fill in the results of our count.\nNumber of Siblings Frequency Number of Siblings Frequency\n0 5 3 3\n1 13 4 2\n2 6 5 1\nStep 3:Check your work. If you add up your counts, you should get the same number as the total number of responses.\nLooking back at the raw data, there were 30 responses, and .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.1 \u2022 Gathering and Organizing Data 821\nYOUR TURN8.3\n1. A question on a community survey asked each respondent to give the number of people who shared their\nresidence, and the data from the responses was as follows:\n1 3 2 2 1 3 3 4 2 2 2 4 1 1 2 3 1 1 5 2\n1 4 3 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 2 2 2 1 4\nCreate a frequency distribution to organize the responses.\nIf there are many possible responses, a frequency distribution table like the ones we\u2019ve seen so far isn\u2019t really useful;\nthere will likely be many responses with a frequency of one, which means the table will be no better than looking at the\nraw data. In these cases, we can create abinned frequency distribution. A binned frequency distribution groups the\ndata into ranges of values calledbins, then records the number of responses in each bin.\nFor example, if we have height data for individuals measured in centimeters, we might create bins like 150\u2013155 cm,\n155\u2013160 cm, and so forth (making sure that every data value falls into a bin). We must be careful, though; in this\nscenario, it\u2019s not clear which bin would contain a response of 155 cm. Usually, responses on the edge of a bin are placed\nin the higher bin, but it\u2019s good practice to make that clear. In cases where responses are rounded off, you can avoid this\nissue by leaving a gap between the bins that couldn\u2019t contain any responses. In our example, if the measurements were\nall rounded off to the nearest centimeter, we could make bins like 150\u2013154 cm, 155\u2013159 cm, etc. (since a response like\n154.2 isn\u2019t possible). We\u2019ll use this method going forward. How do we decide what the boundaries of our bins should be?\nThere\u2019s no one right way to do that, but there are some guidelines that can be helpful.\n1. Every data value should fall into exactly one bin. For example, if the lowest value in our data is 42, the lowest bin\nshould not be 45\u201349.\n2. Every bin should have the same width. Note that if we shift the upper limits of our bins down a bit to avoid\nambiguity (like described above), we can\u2019t simply subtract the lower limit from the upper limit to get the bin width;\ninstead, we subtract the lower limit of the bin from the lower limit of thenextbin. For example, if we\u2019re looking at\nGPAs rounded to the nearest hundredth, we might choose bins like 2.00\u20132.24, 2.25\u20132.49, 2.50\u20132.74, etc. These bins\nall have a width of 0.25.\n3. If the minimum or maximum value of the data falls right on the boundary between two bins, then it\u2019s OK to bend\nthe rule just a little in order to avoid having an additional bin containing just that one value. We\u2019ll see an example of\nthis in just a moment.\n4. If we have too many or too few bins, it can be difficult to get a good sense of the distribution. Seven or eight bins is\nideal, but that\u2019s not a firm rule; anything between five and twelve is fine. We often choose the number of bins so\nthat the widths are round numbers.\nEXAMPLE8.4\nCreating a Binned Frequency Distribution\nThe GPAs of students enrolled in an advanced sociology class are listed in the following table. At this institution, 4.00 is\nthe maximum possible GPA.\n3.93 3.43 2.87 2.51 2.70 1.91 2.32 2.85 3.06 3.03 3.49 1.84 3.72 2.56\n1.99 3.40 3.74 3.23 1.98 3.05 1.43 2.90 1.20 3.72 3.56 3.07 2.58 4.00\n2.79 3.81 2.60 3.69 2.88 3.34 1.51 3.63 3.45 1.89 2.30 2.98 3.04 2.70\nCreate a binned frequency distribution for the data.\nSolution\nStep 1: Identify the max and min values in your bins.Looking at the dataset, you can see that the lowest value is 1.20, 822 8 \u2022 Statistics\nand the highest is 4.00.\nStep 2: Get a rough idea of bin widths.Aim for seven or eight bins, give or take a couple. For eight bins, the minimum\nwidth can be found by taking the difference between the largest and smallest data values and dividing by the number of\nbins:\nIf we use 0.35 for our widths, starting at our minimum value of 1.20, we\u2019ll get bins with these boundaries: 1.20, 1.55,\n1.90, 2.25, 2.60, 2.95, 3.30, 3.65, 4.00.\nStep 3: Consider the context of the values.Because these are GPAs, there are natural breaks at 2.00 and 3.00 that are\nimportant. (People like whole numbers!) Since 0.35 is very close to , let\u2019s use that for our bin width instead, and make\nsure that whole numbers fall on the boundaries. That means our first bin needs to start at 1.00 and go up to 1.33 to\nmake sure our minimum value is included. The next bin will run from 1.34 to 1.66, and so forth.\nStep 4: Create the distribution table.We start our distribution table by filling in the bins:\nGPA Range Frequency GPA Range Frequency GPA Range Frequency\n1.00\u20131.33 2.00\u20132.33 3.00\u20133.33\n1.34\u20131.66 2.34\u20132.66 3.34\u20133.66\n1.67\u20131.99 2.67\u20132.99 3.67\u20134.00\nNotice that the last bin doesn\u2019t follow the pattern; since our maximum data value is right on the upper boundary of that\nlast bin, this is a case where we can bend that rule just a little to avoid creating a bin for 4.00\u20134.33 (which wouldn\u2019t really\nmake sense in the context of these GPAs anyway, since 4.00 is the maximum possible GPA).\nStep 5: Complete the table with the frequencies.Finish the table by counting the number of data values that fall in\neach bin, and recording them in the frequency column:\nGPA Range Frequency GPA Range Frequency GPA Range Frequency\n1.00\u20131.33 1 2.00\u20132.33 2 3.00\u20133.33 6\n1.34\u20131.66 2 2.34\u20132.66 4 3.34\u20133.66 7\n1.67\u20131.99 5 2.67\u20132.99 8 3.67\u20134.00 7\nStep 6: Check your work.Add up the frequencies to make sure all the data values are included.

(credit: \"Group of\ndiverse people having a business meeting\" by Rawpixel Ltd/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Create charts and graphs to appropriately represent data.\n2. Interpret visual representations of data.\n3. Determine misleading components in data displayed visually.\nSummarizing raw data is the first step we must take when we want to communicate the results of a study or experiment\nto a broad audience. However, even organized data can be difficult to read; for example, if a frequency table is large, it\ncan be tough to compare the first row to the last row. As the old saying goes: a picture is worth a thousand words (or, in\nthis case, summary statistics)! Just as our techniques for organizing data depended on the type of data we were looking 828 8 \u2022 Statistics\nat, the methods we\u2019ll use for creating visualizations will vary. Let\u2019s start by considering categorical data.\nVisualizing Categorical Data\nIf the data we\u2019re visualizing is categorical, then we want a quick way to represent graphically the relative numbers of\nunits that fall in each category. When we created the frequency distributions in the last section, all we did was count the\nnumber of units in each category and record that number (this was thefrequencyof that category). Frequencies are nice\nwhen we\u2019re organizing and summarizing data; they\u2019re easy to compute, and they\u2019re always whole numbers. But they can\nbe difficult to understand for an outsider who\u2019s being introduced to your data.\nLet\u2019s consider a quick example. Suppose you surveyed some people and asked for their favorite color. You communicated\nyour results using a frequency distribution. Jerry is interested in data on favorite colors, so he reads your frequency\ndistribution. The first row shows that twelve people indicated green was their favorite color. However, Jerry has no way of\nknowing if that\u2019s a lot of people without knowing how many people total took your survey. Twelve is a pretty significant\nnumber if only twenty-five people took the survey, but it\u2019s next to nothing if you recorded a thousand responses. For that\nreason, we will often summarize categorical data not with frequencies, but withproportions. The proportion of data\nthat fall into a particular category is computed by dividing the frequency for that category by the total number of units in\nthe data.\nProportions can be expressed as fractions, decimals, or percentages.\nEXAMPLE8.5\nFinding Proportions\nRecallExample 8.2, in which a teacher recorded the responses on the first question of a multiple choice quiz, with five\npossible responses (A, B, C, D, and E). The raw data was as follows:\nA A C A B B A E A C A A A C\nE A B A A C A B E E A A C C\nWe computed a frequency distribution that looked like this:\nResponse to First Question Frequency\nA 14\nB 4\nC 6\nD 0\nE 4\nNow, let's compute the proportions for each category.\nSolution\nStep 1:In order to compute a proportion, we need the frequency (which we have in the table above) and the total\nnumber of units that are represented in our data. We can find that by adding up the frequencies from all the categories:\n.\nStep 2:To find the proportions, we divide the frequency by the total. For the first category (\u201cA\u201d), the proportion is\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 829\nWe can compute the other proportions similarly, filling in the rest of the table:\nResponse to First Question Frequency Proportion\nA 14\nB 4\nC 6\nD 0\nE 4\nStep 3:Check your work: If you add up your proportions, you should get 1 (if you\u2019re using fractions or decimals) or 100%\n(if you\u2019re using percentages). In this case,\nIf you need to round off the results of the computations to get your percentages or decimals, then the sum might\nnot be exactly equal to 1 or 100% in the end due to that rounding error.\nYOUR TURN8.5\n1. In Your Turn 8.2, students in a statistics class were asked to provide their majors. Those results are again listed\nbelow:\nUndecided Biology Biology Sociology\nPolitical Science Sociology Undecided Undecided\nUndecided Biology Biology Education\nBiology Biology Political Science Political Science\nYou created a frequency distribution:\nMajor Frequency\nBiology 6\nEducation 1\nPolitical Science 3 830 8 \u2022 Statistics\nMajor Frequency\nSociology 2\nUndecided 4\nNow, find the proportions associated with each category. Express your answers as percentages.\nNow that we can compute proportions, let\u2019s turn to visualizations. There are two primary visualizations that we\u2019ll use for\ncategorical data: bar charts and pie charts. Both of these data representations work on the same principle: If proportions\nare represented as areas, then it\u2019s easy to compare two proportions by assessing the corresponding areas. Let\u2019s look at\nbar charts first.\nBar Charts\nAbar chartis a visualization of categorical data that consists of a series of rectangles arranged side-by-side (but not\ntouching). Each rectangle corresponds to one of the categories. All of the rectangles have the same width. The height of\neach rectangle corresponds to either the number of units in the corresponding category or the proportion of the total\nunits that fall into the category.\nEXAMPLE8.6\nBuilding a Bar Chart\nInExample 8.5, we computed the following proportions:\nResponse to First Question Frequency Proportion\nA 14 50%\nB 4 14.3%\nC 6 21.4%\nD 0 0%\nE 4 14.3%\nDraw a bar chart to visualize this frequency distribution.\nSolution\nStep 1:To start, we\u2019ll draw axes with the origin (the point where the axes meet) at the bottom left:\nFigure8.5\nStep 2:Next, we\u2019ll place our categories evenly spaced along the bottom of the horizontal axis. The order doesn\u2019t really\nmatter, but if the categories have some sort of natural order (like in this case, where the responses are labeled A to E), it\u2019s\nbest to maintain that order. We'll also label the horizontal axis:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 831\nFigure8.6\nStep 3:Now, we have a decision to make: Will we use frequencies to define the height of our rectangles, or will we use\nproportions? Let\u2019s try it both ways. First, let\u2019s use frequencies. Notice that our frequencies run from zero to 14; this will\ncorrespond to the scale we put on the vertical axis. If we put a tick mark for every whole number between 0 and 14, the\nresult will be pretty crowded; let\u2019s instead put a mark on the multiples of 3 or 5:\nFigure8.7\nStep 4:Now, let\u2019s draw in the first rectangle. The frequency associated with \u201cA\u201d is 14. So we\u2019ll go to 14 on the vertical axis,\nand place a mark at that height above the \u201cA\u201d label:\nFigure8.8\nStep 5:Then, draw vertical lines straight down from the edges of your mark to make a rectangle:\nFigure8.9 832 8 \u2022 Statistics\nStep 6:Finally, we can build the rest of the rectangles, making sure that the bases all have the same length of the base =\nwidth of the rectangle, and the rectangles don\u2019t touch. Notice that, since the frequency for \u201cD\u201d is zero, that category has\nno rectangle (but we\u2019ll leave a space there so the reader can see that there is a category with frequency zero). Here\u2019s the\nresult:\nFigure8.10\nStep 7:That\u2019s it! Now, let\u2019s use proportions instead of frequencies. We'll label the vertical axis with evenly spaced\nnumbers that run the full range of the percentages in our table: 0% to 50%. We can divide that into five equal parts (so\nthat each has width 10%), and use that to label our vertical axis:\nFigure8.11\nStep 8:Then, we can fill in the rectangles just as we did before. The height of the \u201cA\u201d rectangle is 50%, the \u201cB\u201d rectangle\ngoes up to 14.3%, \u201cC\u201d goes to 21.4%, there is no rectangle for \u201cD\u201d (since its proportion is 0%), and the \u201cE\u201d rectangle also\ngoes up to 14.3%:\nFigure8.12\nStep 9:Notice that the rectangles are basically identical in our two final bar charts. That\u2019s no coincidence! Bar charts that\nuse proportions and those that use frequencies will always look identical (which is why it doesn\u2019t really matter much\nwhich option you choose). Here\u2019s why: look at the bars for \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d. The frequencies for these are 4 and 6 respectively.\nNotice that 6 is 50% bigger than 4 (since ), which means that the \u201cC\u201d bar will be 50% higher than the \u201cB\u201d bar.\nNow look at the same bars using proportions: since , the bar for \u201cC\u201d will be 50% higher than the bar\nfor \u201cB.\u201d The same relationships hold for the other bars, too.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 833\nFigure8.13\nYOUR TURN8.6\n1.

Analyze the graph to answer the\nfollowing questions. 834 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.14(data source: consumerreports.org/cars)\n1. What proportion of available cars were sports cars?\n2. What proportion of available cars were sedans?\n3. Which categories of cars each made up less than 5% of the models available?\nSolution\n1. The bar for sports cars goes up to 10%, so the proportion of models that are considered sports cars is 10%.\n2. The bar corresponding to sedan goes up past 30% but not quite to 35%. It looks like the proportion we want is\nbetween 33% and 34%.\n3. We\u2019re looking for the bars that don\u2019t make it all the way to the 5% line. Those categories are hatchback and wagon.\nYOUR TURN8.7\nThe bar graph shows the region of every institution of higher learning in the United States (except for the service\nacademies, like West Point).\nAnalyze the bar chart to answer the following questions.\n1. Which region contains the largest number of institutions of higher learning?\n2. What proportion of all institutions of higher learning can be found in the Southwest?\n3.

Do the colors in each bag appear with the same frequency? Get a bag of one of these candies and\nmake a bar chart to visualize the color distribution.\nPie Charts\nApie chartconsists of a circle divided into wedges, with each wedge corresponding to a category. The proportion of the\narea of the entire circle that each wedge represents corresponds to the proportion of the data in that category. Pie\ncharts are difficult to make without technology because they require careful measurements of angles and precise circles,\nboth of which are tasks better left to computers.\nVIDEO\nCreate Pie Charts Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Creating_Pie_Chart)\nPie charts are sometimes embellished with features like labels in the slices (which might be the categories, the\nfrequencies in each category, or the proportions in each category) or a legend that explains which colors correspond to\nwhich categories. When making your own pie chart, you can decide which of those to include. The only rule is that there\nhas to be some way to connect the slices to the categories (either through labels or a legend).\nEXAMPLE8.8\nMaking Pie Charts\nUse the data that follows to generate a pie chart.\nType Percent Type Percent\nSUV 43.6% Minivan 5.5%\nSedan 33.6% Hatchback 3.6%\nSports 10.0% Wagon 3.6%\nTable8.1(data source:\nwww.consumerreports.org/cars)\nSolution\nFirst, enter the chart above into a new sheet in Google Sheets.

For those efforts, she is today considered the founder of\nmodern nursing.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 837\nFigure8.16Florence Nightingale's significant contribution to the field of statistical graphics cannot be understated.\n(credit: \"Florence Nightingale\" by Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division/http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/\npp.print, public domain)\nNightingale is also remembered for her contributions in statistics, especially in the ways we visualize data. She\ndeveloped a version of the pie chart that is today known as apolar area diagram, which she used to visualize the\ncauses of death among the soldiers in the war, highlighting the number of preventable deaths the British Army\nsuffered in that conflict.\nIn 1859, the Royal Statistical Society honored her for her contributions to the discipline by electing her to join the\norganization. She was the first woman to be so honored. She was later named an honorary member of the American\nStatistical Association. Nightingale's status as a revered pioneer in both nursing and statistics is a complex one,\nbecause some of her writings and opinions demonstrate a colonialist mindset and disregard for those who lost their\nlives and lands at the hands of the British. Her core statistical writings indicated that she felt superior to the\nIndigenous people she was treating. Members of both fields continue to debate her near-iconic role.\nVisualizing Quantitative Data\nThere are several good ways to visualize quantitative data. In this section, we\u2019ll talk about two types: stem-and-leaf plots\nand histograms.\nStem-and-Leaf Plots\nStem-and-leaf plotsare visualization tools that fall somewhere between a list of all the raw data and a graph. A stem-\nand-leaf plot consists of a list of stems on the left and the corresponding leaves on the right, separated by a line. The\nstems are the numbers that make up the data only up to the next-to-last digit, and the leaves are the final digits. There is\none leaf for every data value (which means that leaves may be repeated), and the leaves should be evenly spaced across\nall stems. These plots are really nothing more than a fancy way of listing out all the raw data; as a result, they shouldn\u2019t\nbe used to visualize large datasets.\nThis concept can be difficult to understand without referencing an example, so let\u2019s first look at how to read a stem-and-\nleaf plot.\nEXAMPLE8.9\nReading a Stem-and-Leaf Plot\nA collector of trading cards records the sale prices (in dollars) of a particular card on an online auction site, and puts the\nresults in a stem-and-leaf plot:\n0 5 8 9\n1 0 0 0 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 9 9\nTable8.2 838 8 \u2022 Statistics\n2 0 0 0 0 5 5 9 9\n3 0 0 0 5 5\n4 0 0 5\n5\n6 0\nTable8.2\nAnswer the following questions about the data:\n1. How many prices are represented?\n2. What prices represent the five most expensive cards? The five least expensive?\n3. What is the full set of data?\nSolution\n1. Each leaf (the numbers on the right side of the bar) represents one data value. So, on the first row (which looks like\n0 | 5 8 9), there are three data values (one for each leaf: 5, 8, and 9). The next row has thirteen leaves, then eight,\nfive, three, zero, and one. Adding those up, we get data points or prices.\n2. The most expensive card is the last one listed. Its stem is 6 and its leaf is 0, so the price is $60. There are no leaves\nassociated with the 5 stem, so there were no cards sold for $50 to $59. The next most expensive cards are then on\nthe 4 stem: $45, $40, and $40 (remember, repeated leaves mean repeated values in the dataset). So, we have our\nfour most expensive cards. The fifth would be on the next stem up. The biggest leaf on the 3 stem is a 5, so the fifth-\nmost expensive card sold for $35.\nAs for the five least-expensive cards, the smallest stem is 0, with leaves 5, 8, and 9. So, the three least expensive\ncards sold for $5, $8, and $9 (notice that we don\u2019t write down that leading 0 from the stem in the tens place). The\nnext two least-expensive cards will be the two smallest leaves on the next stem: $10 and $10.\n3. The full list of data is: 5, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 13, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 16, 19, 19, 20, 20, 20, 24, 25, 25, 29, 29, 30, 30, 30,\n35, 35, 40, 40, 45, 60.\nYOUR TURN8.9\nThe stem-and-leaf plot below shows data collected from a sample of employed people who were asked how far (in\nmiles) they commute each day:\n0 4 6 7\n1 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 5 8 8\n2 0 5 5 5\n3 0 0 5 5 6\n4\n5 0\n6 0\n1. How many data points are represented?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 839\n2. What are the three longest and shortest commutes?\n3. What is the full list of data?\nStem-and-leaf plots are useful in that they give us a sense of the shape of the data. Are the data evenly spread out over\nthe stems, or are some stems \u201cheavier\u201d with leaves? Are the heavy stems on the low side, the high side, or somewhere in\nthe middle? These are questions about thedistributionof the data, or how the data are spread out over the range of\npossible values.\nSome words we use to describe distributions areuniform(data are equally distributed across the range),symmetric\n(data are bunched up in the middle, then taper off in the same way above and below the middle),left-skewed(data are\nbunched up at the high end or larger values, and taper off toward the low end or smaller values), andright-skewed(data\nare bunched up at the low end, and taper off toward the high end). See below figures.\nLooking back at the stem-and-leaf plot in the previous example, we can see that the data are bunched up at the low end\nand taper off toward the high end; that set of data is right-skewed. Knowing the distribution of a set of data gives us\nuseful information about the property that the data are measuring.\nNow that we have a better idea of how to read a stem-and-leaf plot, we\u2019re ready to create our own.\nEXAMPLE8.10\nConstructing a Stem-and-Leaf Plot\nAn entomologist studying crickets recorded the number of times different crickets (of differing species, genders, etc.)\nchirped in a one-minute span. The raw data are as follows:\n89 97 82 102 84 99 93 103 120 91\n115 105 89 109 107 89 104 82 106 92\n101 109 116 103 100 91 85 104 104 106\nConstruct a stem-and-leaf plot to visualize these results.\nSolution\nStep 1: Before we can create the plot, we need to sort the data in order from smallest to largest: 840 8 \u2022 Statistics\n82 82 84 85 89 89 89 91 91 92\n93 97 99 100 101 102 103 103 104 104\n104 105 106 106 107 109 109 115 116 120\nStep 2:Next, we identify the stems. To do that, we cut off the final digit of each number, which leaves us with stems of 8,\n9, 10, 11, and 12. Arrange the stems vertically, and add the bar to separate these from the leaves:\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nStep 3:Write down the leaves on the right side of the bar, giving just the final digit (that we cut off to make the stems) of\neach data value. List these in order, and make sure they line up vertically:\n8 2 2 4 5 9 9 9\n9 1 1 2 3 7 9\n10 0 1 3 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 7 9 9\n11 5 6\n12 0\nTable8.3\nYOUR TURN8.10\n1.

For example, if all the data in your dataset\nare between 20 and 29, then you\u2019ll just have one stem, which isn\u2019t terribly useful. (Although there are methods likestem\nsplittingfor addressing that particular problem, we won\u2019t go into those at this time.) On the other end of the spectrum,\nthe data may be so spread out that every stem has only one leaf. (This problem can sometimes be addressed by\nrounding off the data values to the tens, hundreds, or some other place value, then using that place for the leaves.)\nFinally, if you have dozens or hundreds (or more) of data values, then a stem-and-leaf plot becomes too unwieldy to be\nuseful. Fortunately, we have other tools we can use.\nHistograms\nHistogramsare visualizations that can be used for any set of quantitative data, no matter how big or spread out. They\ndiffer from a categorical bar chart in that the horizontal axis is labeled with numbers (not ranges of numbers), and the\nbars are drawn so that they touch each other. The heights of the bars reflect the frequencies in each bin. Unlike with\nstem-and-leaf plots, we cannot recreate the original dataset from a histogram. However, histograms are easy to make\nwith technology and are great for identifying the distribution of our data. Let\u2019s first create one histogram without\ntechnology to help us better understand how histograms work.\nEXAMPLE8.11\nConstructing a Histogram\nInExample 8.10, we built a stem-and-leaf plot for the number of chirps made by crickets in one minute. Here are the raw\ndata that we used then: 842 8 \u2022 Statistics\n89 97 82 102 84 99\n115 105 89 109 107 89\n101 109 116 103 100 91\n93 103 120 91 85 104\n104 82 106 92 104 106\nConstruct a histogram to visualize these results.\nSolution\nStep 1:Add data to bins. Histograms are built on binned frequency distributions, so we\u2019ll make that first. Luckily, the\nstem-and-leaf plot we made earlier can help us do this much more quickly:\n8 2 2 4 5 9 9 9\n9 1 1 2 3 7 9\n10 0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 7 9 9\n11 5 6\n12 0\nIf we\u2019re using bins of width 10, we can compute the frequencies by counting the numbers of leaves associated with the\ncorresponding stem:\nBin Frequency\n80-89 7\n90-99 6\n100-109 14\n110-119 2\n120-129 1\n(Note that, when we made binned frequency diagrams in the last module, we noted that if the biggest data value was\nright on the border between two bins, it was OK to lump it in with the lower bin. That\u2019s not recommended when building\nhistograms, so the data value 120 is all alone in the 120-129 bin.)\nStep 2:Create the axes. On the horizontal axis, start labeling with the lower end of the first bin (in this case, 80), and go\nup to the higher end of the last bin (120). Mark off the other bin boundaries, making sure they\u2019re all evenly spaced. On\nthe vertical axis, start with zero and go up at least to the greatest frequency you see in your bins (14 in this example),\nmaking sure that the labels you make are evenly spaced and that the difference between those numbers is the same.\nLet\u2019s count off our vertical axis by threes:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 843\nFigure8.17\nStep 3:Draw in the bars. Remember that the bars of a histogram touch, and that the heights are determined by the\nfrequency. So, the first bar will cover 80 to 90 on the horizontal axis, and have a height of 7:\nFigure8.18\nNow, we can fill in the others:\nFigure8.19\nStep 4:Let\u2019s compare the histogram we just created to the stem-and-leaf plot we made earlier:\nFigure8.20\nNotice that the leaves on the rotated stem-and-leaf plot match the bars on our histogram! We can view stem-and-leaf\nplots as sideways histograms. But, as we\u2019ll see soon, we can do much more with histograms. 844 8 \u2022 Statistics\nYOUR TURN8.11\n1.

Create a histogram in Google Sheets of the\naverage SAT scores. Use bins of width 50. Are the data uniformly distributed, symmetric, left-skewed, or right-skewed?\nSolution\nUsing the procedure described in the video above, we get this: 846 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.21(data source: https://data.ed.gov)\nThe data are fairly symmetric, but slightly right-skewed.\nYOUR TURN8.12\n1. The file\u201cInState\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)contains in-state tuition costs (in dollars) for every\ninstitution of higher learning in the United States for which data is available (data from data.ed.gov). Create a\nhistogram in Google Sheets of in-state tuition costs. Choose a bin size that you think works well. Are the data\nuniformly distributed, symmetric, left-skewed, or right-skewed?\nBar Charts for Labeled Data\nSometimes we have quantitative data where each value is labeled according to the source of the data. For example, in\nthe Your Turn above, you looked at in-state tuition data. Every value you used to create that histogram was associated\nwith a school; the schools are the labels. InYOUR TURN 8.11, you found a histogram of the wins of every Major League\nBaseball team in 2019. Each of those win totals had a label: the team. If we\u2019re interested in visualizing differences among\nthe different teams, or schools, or whatever the labels are, we create a different version of the bar graph known as abar\nchart for labeled data.\nThese graphs are made in Google Sheets in exactly the same way as regular bar graphs. The only change is that the\nvertical axis will be labeled with the units for your quantitative data instead of just \u201cFrequency.\u201d\nEXAMPLE8.13\nBuilding a Bar Chart for Labeled Data\nThe following table shows the gross domestic product (GDP) for the United States for the years 2010 to 2019:\nYear GDP (in $ trillions) Year GDP (in $ trillions)\n2010 14.992 2015 18.225\n2011 15.543 2016 18.715\n2012 16.197 2017 19.519\nTable8.6(source: https://data.worldbank.org)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 847\nYear GDP (in $ trillions) Year GDP (in $ trillions)\n2013 16.785 2018 20.580\n2014 17.527 2019 21.433\nTable8.6(source: https://data.worldbank.org)\nConstruct a histogram that represents these data.\nSolution\nIn this case, the years are the labels, and the data we are interested in are the GDP numbers.

There are two\nprimary ways this can be done: by manipulating the scales on the axes and by manipulating or misrepresenting areas of\nbars. Let\u2019s look at some examples of these.\nEXAMPLE8.14\nMisleading Graphs\nThe table below shows the teams, and their payrolls, in the English Premier League, the top soccer organization in the\nUnited Kingdom.\nTeam Salary (\u00a31,000,000s) Team Salary (\u00a31,000,000s)\nManchester United F.C. 175.7 Newcastle United F.C. 56.9\nManchester City F.C. 136.5 Aston Villa F.C. 52.3\nChelsea F.C. 132.8 Fulham F.C. 52.1\nArsenal F.C. 130.7 Southampton F.C. 49.6\nTottenham Hotspur F.C. 129.2 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. 49.5\nLiverpool F.C. 118.6 Brighton & Hove Albion 43.7\nCrystal Palace 85.0 Burnley F.C. 35.5\nEverton F.C. 82.5 West Bromwich Albion F.C. 23.8\nLeicester City 73.7 Leeds United F.C. 22.5\nWest Ham United F.C. 69.2 Sheffield United F.C. 19.7\nTable8.8(source: www.spotrac.com)\nHow might someone present this data in a misleading way?\nSolution\nStep 1:Let\u2019s focus on the top five teams. Here\u2019s a bar chart of their payrolls:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 849\nFigure8.23(data source: www.spotrac.com)\nStep 2:Now, here\u2019s another bar chart visualizing exactly the same data:\nFigure8.24(data source: www.spotrac.com)\nStep 3:You should notice that despite using the same data, these two graphs look strikingly different. In the second\ngraph, the gap between Manchester United and the other four teams looks significantly larger than in the first graph.\nThe scale on the vertical axis has been manipulated here. The first graph's axis starts at zero, while the lowest value on\nthe second graph's axis is 120. This trick has a strong impact on the viewer\u2019s perception of the data.\nBeware of vertical axes that don\u2019t start at zero! They overemphasize differences in heights.\nStep 4:To further emphasize the difference this creates in our perception, let's look at that data again, but this time\nusing graphics instead of colored areas on our bar graph. 850 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.25(data source: www.spotrac.com)\nThis graph uses an image of a \u00a310 banknote in place of the bars. Using an image that evokes the context of the data in\nplace of a standard, \u201cboring\u201d bar is a common tool that people use when creatinginfographics. However, this is generally\nnot a good practice because it distorts the data. Notice that our \u201cbars\u201d (the banknotes) are just as tall here as they were\nin the previous figure. But, to maintain the right proportions, thewidthshad to be adjusted as well, which changes the\narea (height \u00d7 width) of each bar. A key point is that when looking at rectangles, the human eye tends to process areas\nmore easily than heights.\nBeware of infographics! Areas overemphasize a difference that should be measured with a height!\nStep 5:Now, let\u2019s look at all 20 teams. This histogram indicates that the data are right-skewed, with the highest number\nof teams having a payroll between \u00a340 million and \u00a380 million:\nFigure8.26(data source: www.spotrac.com)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Visualizing Data 851\nStep 6:Now let's view this same data in another chart:\nFigure8.27(data source: www.spotrac.com)\nStep 7:Even though this chart uses the same data, the skew seems to be reversed. Why? Well, even though this graph\nlookslike a histogram, it isn\u2019t. Look closely at the labels on the horizontal axis; they don't correspond to spots on the axis,\nbut instead provide a range, meaning this is a bar graph based on a binned frequency distribution.\nWhen we review these ranges, we can see that the last range is misleading as it consists of all data \u201cover 80.\u201d If the bins\nall had the same width, that last bin would run from 80 to 120. However, we can see from the histogram that the\nmaximum value for this data is between 160 and 200. If the last bin in this bar graph were labeled honestly, it would read\n\u201c80\u2013200,\u201d which would drive home the fact that the width of that bar is misleading.\nAlways check the horizontal axis on histograms! The widths of all the bars should be equal.\nYOUR TURN8.14\n1.

(credit: modification of work \u201cI\u2019m the tallest\u201d by Jenn\nDurfey/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Calculate the mode of a dataset.\n2. Calculate the median of a dataset.\n3. Calculate the mean of a dataset.\n4. Contrast measures of central tendency to identify the most representative average.\n5. Solve application problems involving mean, median, and mode.\nWhat exactly do we mean when we describe something as \"average\"? Is the height of an average person the height that\nmore people share than any other? What if we line up every person in the world, in order from shortest to tallest, and\nfind the person right in the middle: Is that person\u2019s height the average? Or maybe it\u2019s something more complicated.\nImagine a game where you and a friend are trying to guess the typical person\u2019s height. Once the guesses are made, you\nbring in every person and measure their height. You and your friend figure out how far off each of your guesses were\nfrom the actual value, then square that number. The result is the number of points you earn for that person. After we\ncheck every height and award points accordingly, the person with the lower score wins (because a lower score means\nthat person\u2019s guess was, overall, closer to the actual values). Could we define the average height to be the number that\nyou should guess to give you the smallest possible score?\nEach of these three methods of determining the \u201caverage\u201d is commonly used. They are all methods of measuring\ncentrality(orcentral tendency). Centrality is just a word that describes the middle of a set of data. All give potentially\ndifferent results, and all are useful for different reasons. In this section, we\u2019ll explore each of these methods of finding\nthe \u201caverage.\u201d\nThe Mode\nIn our discussion of average heights, the first possible definition we offered was the height that more people share than\nany other. This is themode, or the value that appears most often. If there are two modes, the data arebimodal.\nLet\u2019s look at some examples.\nEXAMPLE8.15\nFinding the Mode Using a Stem-and-Leaf Plot\nInExample 8.9, we looked at a stem-and-leaf plot of the sale prices (in dollars) of a particular collectible trading card: 858 8 \u2022 Statistics\n0 5 8 9\n1 0 0 0 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 9 9\n2 0 0 0 0 5 5 9 9\n3 0 0 0 5 5\n4 0 0 5\n5\n6 0\nWhat is the mode price?\nSolution\nThe mode is the price that appears most often. Both 15 and 20 appear 4 times, more than any other values. So, they are\nthe modes (and we can conclude that this set of data is bimodal).\nYOUR TURN8.15\n1. In Example 8.10, we constructed a stem-and-leaf plot for the number of times in one minute that different\ncrickets chirped:\n8 2 2 4 5 9 9 9\n9 1 1 2 3 7 9\n10 0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 5 6 6 7 9 9\n11 5 6\n12 0\nWhat is the mode of the number of chirps in a minute?\nWhen we have a complete list of the data or a stem-and-leaf plot, it\u2019s pretty straightforward to find the mode; we just\nneed to find the number that appears most often. If we\u2019re given a frequency distribution instead, the technique is\ndifferent (but just as straightforward): we\u2019re looking for the number with the highest frequency.\nEXAMPLE8.16\nFinding the Mode Using a Frequency Distribution\nInExample 8.3, we created a frequency distribution of the number of siblings of conflict resolution class attendees.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Mean, Median and Mode 859\nNumber of Siblings Frequency\n0 5\n1 13\n2 6\n3 3\n4 2\n5 1\nWhat is the mode of the number of siblings?\nSolution\nThe mode is the value that appears the most often, which means it has the greatest frequency. Thirteen of the\nrespondents have one sibling, more than any other number. So, the mode is 1.\nYOUR TURN8.16\n1. In Your Turn 8.3, you found a frequency distribution for the number of people who shared a residence with\npeople in a sample.\nNumber of People in the Residence Frequency\n1 12\n2 13\n3 8\n4 6\n5 1\nWhat\u2019s the mode of the number of people in these residences?\nWhat happens if there is no number in the data that appears more than once? In that case, by our definition, every data\nvalue is a mode. But according to some other definitions, the data would have no mode. In practice, though, it doesn\u2019t\nreally matter; if no data value appears more than once, then the mode is not helpful at all as a measure of centrality.\nThe Median\nLet's revisit our example of trying to identify the height of the \u201caverage\u201d person. If we lined everyone up in order by\nheight and found the person right in the middle, that person\u2019s height is called themedian, or the value that is greater\nthan no more than half and less than no more than half of the values.\nLet\u2019s look at a really simple example. Consider the following list of numbers: 11, 12, 13, 13, 14. Is the first number on the\nlist, 11, the median? There are no values less than 11 (that\u2019s 0%), and there are four values greater than 11 (that\u2019s 80%).\nSince more than 50% of the data are greater than 11, the definition is violated; it\u2019s not the median. Here\u2019s a chart with the\nrest of the data, with red shading to show where the definition is violated: 860 8 \u2022 Statistics\nData Number of Values Percentage of Values Number of Values Percentage of Values\nValue Below Below Above Above\n11 0 0% 4 80%\n12 1 20% 3 60%\n13 2 40% 1 20%\n14 4 80% 0 0%\nTable8.10\nOnly 13 has no violations, so it\u2019s the median according to the definition. In practice, we find the median just like we\ndescribed in the average height example: by lining up all the data values in order from smallest to largest and picking\nthe value in the middle. For our easy example (with data values 11, 12, 13, 13, 14), that first 13 is right in the middle;\nthere are two values to the left and two values to the right. If there\u2019s not one value right in the middle, we pick the two\nclosest, then choose the number exactly between them. For example, let\u2019s say we have the data 41, 44, 46, 53. Since\nthere are an even number of data values in our list, we can\u2019t pick the one right in the middle. The two closest to the\nmiddle are 44 and 46, so we\u2019ll choose the number halfway between those to be the median: 45. As this example shows,\nthe median (unlike the mode) doesn\u2019t have to be a number in our original set of data.\nIn the examples we\u2019ve looked at so far, it\u2019s been pretty easy to identify which number is right in the middle. If we had a\nvery large dataset, though, it might be harder. Fortunately, we have some formulas to help us with that.\nFORMULA\nSuppose we have a set of data with values, ordered from smallest to largest. If is odd, then the median is the data\nvalue at position . If is even, then we find the values at positions and . If those values are named and\n, then the median is defined to be .\nLet\u2019s put those formulas to work in an example.\nEXAMPLE8.17\nFinding the Median Using a Stem-and-Leaf Plot\nInExample 8.9, we looked at a stem-and-leaf plot that contained 33 sale prices (in dollars) of a particular collectible\ntrading card:\n0 5 8 9\n1 0 0 0 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 9 9\n2 0 0 0 0 5 5 9 9\n3 0 0 0 5 5\n4 0 0 5\n5\n6 0\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Mean, Median and Mode 861\nWhat is the median price?\nSolution\nStep 1:Since 33 is odd, the median is the data value at position , where is the number of values in the dataset.\nThere are 33 total values, so our formula becomes . That means we want to look for the 17th number in the\ndataset.\nStep 2:We'll want to count from the lowest value to the 17th number. We can use our stem and leaf plot to do this.\n1 2 3\n0 5 8 9\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n1 0 0 0 3 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 9 9\n17\n2 0 0 0 0 5 5 9 9\n3 0 0 0 5 5\n4 0 0 5\n5\n6 0\nThe seventeenth number is 20, so the median is 20.\nYOUR TURN8.17\n1. Consider the data given in this stem-and-leaf plot (there are 17 data values):\n12 1 2 2 5\n13 0 3 4 4 6 8\n14 2 5 9 9\n15 0 3\n16\n17 0\nWhat is the median of this data?\nNow, let\u2019s tackle an example with an even number of values. 862 8 \u2022 Statistics\nEXAMPLE8.18\nFinding the Median\nInExample 8.10, we looked at the number of times different crickets (of differing species, genders, etc.) chirped in a one-\nminute span.

Counting them up, we see there are 30, which is even.\nStep 3: Since we have an even number of data values, we need to find the values in positions and .\nThese are 101 and 102.\nStep 4: We use the formula to compute the median: .\nYOUR TURN8.18\n1.

The last method we discussed was\nalso the most complicated. It involved a game where the player guesses a height, then figures out how far off that guess\nis from every single person\u2019s height. Those differences get squared and added together to get a score. Our next measure\nof centrality gives the lowest possible score: No other guess would beat it in the game. Given a dataset containingntotal\nvalues, themeanof the dataset is the sum of all the data values, divided byn.\nThis is a computation you have likely done before.

But, there\u2019s an easier way: Remember that repeatedly adding a number to itself is the definition of multiplication.\nSo, for example, since there are six 2s in our data, the sum of all those 2s must be .\nStep 4:Let\u2019s add a column to our distribution for these products:\nNumber of Siblings Frequency (Number of Siblings) (Frequency)\n0 5 0\n1 13 13\n2 6 12\n3 3 9\n4 2 8\n5 1 5\nStep 5:So, the sum of all our data values is .

Find the mode, median, and mean of\nthose in-state tuition values.\nSolution\nStep 1:To find the mode, we select an empty cell type \u201c=MODE(\u201d, click on the header of the column to insert a reference\nto the column into our formula, and then close the parentheses. When we hit the enter key, our formula is replaced with\nthe mode: $13,380.\nStep 2:We can find the median and mean using the same process, except using the functions \u201cMEDIAN\u201d and \u201cAVERAGE\u201d\nin place of \u201cMODE\u201d. We find that the median is $11,207 and the mean is $15,476.79.\nYOUR TURN8.22\n1. The dataset\"MLB2019\"(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)gives the number of wins for every Major\nLeague Baseball team in the 2019 season. Use Google Sheets to find the mode(s), median, and mean.\nWhich Is Better: Mode, Median, or Mean?\nIf the mode, median, and mean all purport to measure the same thing (centrality), why do we need all three? The answer\nis complicated, as each measure has its own strengths and weaknesses. The mode is simple to compute, but there may\nbe more than one. Further, if no data value appears more than once, the mode is entirely unhelpful. As for the mean and\nmedian, the main difference between these two measures is how each is affected by extreme values.\nConsider this example: the mean and median of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are both 3. But what if the dataset is instead 1, 2, 3, 4, 10?\nThe median is still 3, but the mean is now 4. What this example shows is that the mean is sensitive to extreme values,\nwhile the median isn\u2019t. This knowledge can help us decide which of the two is more relevant for a given dataset. If it is\nimportant that the really high or really low values are reflected in the measure of centrality, then the mean is the better\noption. If very high or low values are not important, however, then we should stick with the median.\nThe decision between mean and median only really matters if the data are skewed. If the data are symmetric, then the\nmean and median are going to be approximately equal, and the distinction between them is irrelevant. If the data are\nskewed, the mean gets pulled in the direction of the skew (i.e., if the data are right-skewed, then the mean will be bigger\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Mean, Median and Mode 867\nthan the median; if the data are left-skewed, the opposite relation is true).\nEXAMPLE8.23\nChoosing Which Measure of Centrality to Use\nFor the following situations, decide which measure(s) of centrality would be best:\n1. You found a used car that you like, and you want to know if the price is too high or too low. You find a list of sale\nprices for that make and model, and you see that the distribution of those prices is skewed to the right. Some of the\nprices at the high end are close to the original sale price of the car, so you guess that those cars might have really\nlow mileage, or have other enhancements added on that increased the value (but which don\u2019t apply to the car you\nfound).\n2. You are asked to analyze the responses to a survey. One of the questions asked, \u201cHow strongly do you agree with\nthe statement, \u2018I believe my elected representatives have my best interests in mind when they vote\u2019?\u201d Responses are\na number between 1 and 5, with 1 representing \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and 5 representing \u201cstrongly agree.\u201d\n3. You are asked to find the \u201caverage\u201d household income for a zip code. Those values are skewed right.\n4. Thinking back to the situation at the beginning of this section: you want to find \u201caverage\u201d height. The data you\u2019ve\ncollected seem to be distributed symmetrically.\nSolution\n1. In this situation, the high values are not comparable to the value of the car you found and we don\u2019t want them to\naffect the results. Also, we\u2019re unlikely to find many repeated values, so the mode is probably not useful. Median is\nbest.\n2. Here, we want to know what a typical result is. The mean doesn\u2019t really make sense; it involves adding the numbers\ntogether, so it would treat two \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d and two \u201cstrongly agree\u201d responses (those add to\n) as exactly the same as four \u201cneutral\u201d responses ( ). But those are really\ndifferent situations; the first shows a strong polarization in the responses, while the second represents strong\nindifference. The mode is probably the best choice (because the data are actually categorical), but the median would\nbe good too.\n3. The mode isn\u2019t going to be useful in this situation because it\u2019s unlikely you will find many households that have\nexactly the same income. The mean and median will be different because of the skew, so the choice comes down to\nthe extreme values. Remember that the data are skewed right, so high values are prevalent. Because these high\nvalues are important for our analysis, we want them to be reflected in the results. Thus, the mean is best. That being\nsaid, the median is also useful; it allows us to say something like \u201c50% of the households surveyed make more than\u201d\nthe median.\n4. Because we aren\u2019t likely to find many people with exactly the same height, the mode won\u2019t be useful. Since the data\nare symmetric, the mean and the median will be about the same. So, it doesn\u2019t really matter which of those two we\nchoose.\nYOUR TURN8.23\nFor the following situations, decide which measure(s) of centrality would be best:\n1. The data come from a survey question where the responses range from 1 (\u201cnot interested\u201d) to 10 (\u201cvery\ninterested\u201d).\n2.

(credit: \"Standardized test exams form\nwith answers bubbled\" by Marco Verch Professional Photographer/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Calculate the range of a dataset\n2. Calculate the standard deviation of a dataset\nMeasures of centrality like the mean can give us only part of the picture that a dataset paints. For example, let\u2019s say\nyou\u2019ve just gotten the results of a standardized test back, and your score was 138. The mean score on the test is 120. So,\nyour score is above average! But how good is itreally? If all the scores were between 100 and 140, then you know your\nscore must be among the best. But if the scores ranged from 0 to 200, then maybe 140 is good, but not great (though\nstill above average). Knowing information about how the data are spread out can help us put a particular data value in\nbetter context. In this section, we\u2019ll look at two numbers that help us describe the spread in the data: the range and the\nstandard deviation. These numbers are called measures of dispersion.\nThe Range\nOur first measure of dispersion is therange, or the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the set.\nIt\u2019s the measure we used in the standardized test example above.\nLet\u2019s look at a couple of examples.\nEXAMPLE8.24\nFinding the Range\nYou survey some of your friends to find out how many hours they work each week. Their responses are: 5, 20, 8, 10, 35,\n12. What is the range?\nSolution\nThe maximum value in the set is 35 and the minimum is 5, so the range is .\nYOUR TURN8.24\n1. On your morning commute, you decide to record how long you have to wait each time you get caught at a red\nlight. Here are the times in seconds: 12, 58, 35, 79, 21. What is the range?\nFor large datasets, finding the maximum and minimum values can be daunting. There are two ways to do it in a\nspreadsheet. First, you can ask the spreadsheet program to sort the data from smallest to largest, then find the first and\nlast numbers on the sorted list. The second method uses built-in functions to find the minimum and maximum. 874 8 \u2022 Statistics\nVIDEO\nFind the Minimum and Maximum Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/min-max_Google-Sheet)\nIn either method, once you\u2019ve found the maximum and minimum, all you have to do is subtract to find the range.\nEXAMPLE8.25\nFinding the Range with Google Sheets\nThe data in\u201cAvgSAT\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)contains the average SAT score for students attending\nevery institution of higher learning in the US for which data is available.

What is the range of these costs?\nThe range is very easy to compute, but it depends only on two of the data values in the entire set. If there happens to be\njust one unusually high or low data value, then the range might give a distorted measure of dispersion. Our next\nmeasure takes every single data value into account, making it more reliable.\nThe Standard Deviation\nThe standard deviation is a measure of dispersion that can be interpreted as approximately the average distance of\nevery data value from the mean. (This distance from the mean is the \u201cdeviation\u201d in \u201cstandard deviation.\u201d)\nFORMULA\nThe standard deviation is computed as follows:\nHere, represents each data value, is the mean of the data values, is the number of data values, and the capital\nsigma ( ) indicates that we take a sum.\nTo compute the standard deviation using the formula, we follow the steps below:\n1. Compute the mean of all the data values.\n2. Subtract the mean from each data value.\n3. Square those differences.\n4. Add up the results in step 3.\n5. Divide the result in step 4 by\n6.

(credit: \"graduation caps\" by John Walker/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Compute percentiles.\n2. Solve application problems involving percentiles.\nA college admissions officer is comparing two students. The first, Anna, finished 12th in her class of 235 people. The\nsecond, Brian, finished 10th in his class of 170 people. Which of these outcomes is better? Certainly 10 is less than 12,\nwhich favors Brian, but Anna\u2019s class was much bigger. In fact, Anna beat out 223 of her classmates, which is\nof her classmates, while Brian bested 160 out of 170 people, or 94%. Comparing the proportions of the data values that\nare below a given number can help us evaluate differences between individuals in separate populations. These\nproportions are calledpercentiles. If of the values in a dataset are less than a number , then we say that is at the\nth percentile.\nFinding Percentiles\nThere are some other terms that are related to \"percentile\" with meanings you may infer from their roots. Remember\nthat the wordpercentmeans \u201cper hundred.\u201d This reflects that percentiles divide our data into 100 pieces. The word\nquartilehas a root that means \u201cfour.\u201d So, if a data value is at the first quantile of a dataset, that means that if you break\nthe data into four parts (because of thequart-), this data value comes after the first of those four parts. In other words,\nit\u2019s greater than 25% of the data, placing it at the 25th percentile.Quintilehas a root meaning \u201cfive,\u201d so a data value at\nthe third quintile is greater than three-fifths of the data in the set. That would put it at the 60th percentile. The general\nterm for these isquantiles(the rootquant\u2013 means \u201cnumber\u201d).\nInMean, Median, and Mode, we defined themedianas a number that is greater than no more than half of the data in a\ndataset and is less than no more than half of the data in the dataset. With our new term, we can more easily define it:\nThe median is the value at the 50th percentile (or second quartile).\nLet\u2019s look at some examples.\nEXAMPLE8.28\nFinding Percentiles\nConsider the dataset 5, 8, 12, 1, 2, 16, 2, 15, 20, 22.\n1. At what percentile is the value 5? 880 8 \u2022 Statistics\n2. What value is at the 60th percentile?\nSolution\nBefore we can answer these two questions, we must put the data in increasing order: 1, 2, 2, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 20, 22.\n1. There are three values (1, 2, and 2) in the set that are less than 5, and there are ten values in the set. Thus, 5 is at the\npercentile.\n2. To find the value at the 60th percentile, we note that there are ten data values, and 60% of ten is six. Thus, the\nnumber we want is greater than exactly six of the data values. Thus, the 60th percentile is 15.\nYOUR TURN8.28\nConsider the dataset 2, 5, 8, 16, 12, 1, 8, 6, 15, 4.\n1. What value is at the 80th percentile?\n2. At what percentile is the value 12?\nIn each of the examples above, the computations were made easier by the fact that the we were looking for percentiles\nthat \u201ccame out evenly\u201d with respect to the number of values in our dataset. Things don\u2019t always work out so cleanly.\nFurther, different sources will define the termpercentilein different ways. In fact, Google Sheets hasthreebuilt-in\nfunctions for finding percentiles, none of which uses our definition. Some of the definitions you\u2019ll see differ in the\ninequality that is used. Ours uses \u201cless than or equal to,\u201d while others use \u201cless than\u201d (these correspond roughly to\nGoogle Sheets\u2019 \u2018PERCENTILE.INC\u2019 and \u2018PERCENTILE.EXC\u2019). Some of them use different methods forinterpolatingvalues.\n(This is what we did when we first computed medians without technology; if there were an even number of data values\nin our dataset, found the mean of the two values in the middle. This is an example of interpolation. Most computerized\nmethods use this technique.) Other definitions don\u2019t interpolate at all, but instead choose the closest actual data value to\nthe theoretical value. Fortunately, for large datasets, the differences among the different techniques become very small.\nSo, with all these different possible definitions in play, what will we use? For small datasets, if you\u2019re asked to compute\nsomething involving percentileswithout technology, use the technique we used in the previous example. In all other\ncases, we\u2019ll keep things simple by using the built-in \u2018PERCENTILE\u2019 and \u2018PERCENTRANK\u2019 functions in Google Sheets (which\ndo the same thing as the \u2018PERCENTILE.INC\u2019 and \u2018PERCENTRANK.INC\u2019 functions; they\u2019re \u201cinclusive, interpolating\u201d\ndefinitions).\nVIDEO\nUsing RANK, PERCENTRANK, and PERCENTILE in Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Using-RANK-PERCENTRANK-\nand-PERCENTILE)\nEXAMPLE8.29\nUsing Google Sheets to Compute Percentiles: Average SAT Scores\nThe data in\u201cAvgSAT\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)contains the average SAT score for students attending\nevery institution of higher learning in the US for which data is available.\n1. What score is at the 3rd quartile?\n2. What score is at the 40th percentile?\n3. At what percentile is Albion College in Michigan (average SAT: 1132)?\n4. At what percentile is Oregon State University (average SAT: 1205)?\nSolution\n1. The 3rd quartile is the 75th percentile, so we\u2019ll use the PERCENTILE function. Click on an empty cell, and type\n\u201c=PERCENTILE(\u201c. Next, enter the data: click on the letter at the top of the column containing the average SAT scores.\nThen, tell the function which percentile we want; it needs to be entered as a decimal. So, type a comma (to separate\nthe two pieces of information we\u2019re giving this function), then type \u201c0.75\u201d and close the parentheses with \u201c)\u201d. The\nresult should look like this (assuming the data are in column C): \u201c=PERCENTILE(C:C, 0.75)\u201d. When you hit the enter\nkey, the formula will be replaced with the average SAT score at the 75th percentile: 1199.\n2. Using the PERCENTILE function, we find that an average SAT of 1100 is at the 40th percentile.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.5 \u2022 Percentiles 881\n3. Since we want to know the percentile for a particular score, we\u2019ll use the PERCENTRANK function. Like the\nPERCENTILE function, we need to give PERCENTRANK two pieces of information: the data, and the value we care\nabout. So, click on an empty cell, type \u201c=PERCENTRANK(\u201c, and then click on the letter at the top of the column\ncontaining the data. Next, type a comma and then the value we want to find the percentile for; in this case, we\u2019ll\ntype \u201c, 1132\u201d. Finally, close the parentheses with \u201c)\u201d and hit the enter key. The formula will be replaced with the\ninformation we want: an average SAT of 1132 is at the 54th percentile.\n4.

Describe the characteristics of the normal distribution.\n2. Apply the 68-95-99.7 percent groups to normal distribution datasets.\n3. Use the normal distribution to calculate a -score.\n4. Find and interpret percentiles and quartiles.\nMany datasets that result from natural phenomena tend to have histograms that are symmetric and bell-shaped.\nImagine finding yourself with a whole lot of time on your hands, and nothing to keep you entertained but a coin, a\npencil, and paper. You decide to flip that coin 100 times and record the number of heads. With nothing else to do, you\nrepeat the experiment ten times total. Using a computer to simulate this series of experiments, here\u2019s a sample for the\nnumber of heads in each trial:\n54, 51, 40, 42, 53, 50, 52, 52, 47, 54\nIt makes sense that we\u2019d get somewhere around 50 heads when we flip the coin 100 times, and it makes sense that the\nresult won\u2019talwaysbe exactly 50 heads. In our results, we can see numbers that were generally near 50 and not always\n50, like we thought. 884 8 \u2022 Statistics\nMoving Toward Normality\nLet\u2019s take a look at a histogram for the dataset in our section opener:\nFigure8.33\nThis is interesting, but the data seem pretty sparse. There were no trials where you saw between 43 and 47 heads, for\nexample. Those results don\u2019t seem impossible; we just didn\u2019t flip enough times to give them a chance to pop up. So, let\u2019s\ndo it again, but this time we'll perform 100 coin flips 100 times. Rather than review all 100 results, which could be\noverwhelming, let's instead visualize the resulting histogram.\nFigure8.34\nFrom the histogram, we see that most of the trials resulted in between, say, 44 and 56 heads. There were some more\nunusual results: one trial resulted in 70 heads, which seems really unlikely (though still possible!). But we\u2019re starting to\nmaybe get a sense of the distribution. More data would help, though. Let\u2019s simulate another 900 trials and add them to\nthe histogram!\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.6 \u2022 The Normal Distribution 885\nFigure8.35\nWe can still see that 70 is a really unusual observation, though we came close in another trial (one that had 68 heads).\nNow, the distribution is coming more into focus: It looks quite symmetric and bell-shaped. Let\u2019s just go ahead and take\nthis thought experiment to an extreme conclusion: 10,000 trials.\nFigure8.36\nThe distribution is pretty clear now. Distributions that are symmetric and bell-shaped like this pop up in all sorts of\nnatural phenomena, such as the heights of people in a population, the circumferences of eggs of a particular bird\nspecies, and the numbers of leaves on mature trees of a particular species. All of these have bell-shaped distributions.\nAdditionally, the results of many types of repeated experiments generally follow this same pattern, as we saw with the\ncoin-flipping example; this fact is the basis for much of the work done by statisticians. It\u2019s a fact that\u2019s important enough\nto have its own name: the Central Limit Theorem. 886 8 \u2022 Statistics\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nJohn Kerrich\nHaving enough time on your hands to actually perform this coin-flipping experiment may sound far-fetched, but the\nEnglish mathematician John Kerrich found himself in just such a situation. While he was studying abroad in Denmark\nin 1940, that country was invaded by the Germans. Kerrich was captured and placed in an internment camp, where he\nremained for the duration of the war. Kerrich knew that he had all kinds of time on his hands. He also studied\nstatistics, so he knew what should happentheoreticallyif he flipped a coin many, many times. He also knew of nobody\nwho had evertestedthat theory with an actual, large-scale experiment. So, he did it: While he was incarcerated,\nKerrich flipped a regular coin 10,000 times and recorded the results. Sure enough, the theory held up!\nThe Normal Distribution\nIn the coin flipping example above, the distribution of the number of heads for 10,000 trials was close to perfectly\nsymmetric and bell-shaped:\nFigure8.37\nBecause distributions with this shape appear so often, we have a special name for them:normal distributions. Normal\ndistributions can be completely described using two numbers we\u2019ve seen before: themeanof the data and thestandard\ndeviationof the data. You may remember that we described the mean as a measure of centrality; for a normal\ndistribution, the mean tells us exactly where the center of the distribution falls. The peak of the distribution happens at\nthe mean (and, because the distribution is symmetric, it\u2019s also the median). The standard deviation is a measure of\ndispersion; for a normal distribution, it tells us how spread out the histogram looks. To illustrate these points, let\u2019s look at\nsome examples.\nEXAMPLE8.31\nIdentifying the Mean of a Normal Distribution\nThis graph shows three normal distributions. What are their means?\nFigure8.38\nSolution\nStep 1:Take a look at the three curves on the graph. Since the mean of a normal distribution occurs at the peak, we\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.6 \u2022 The Normal Distribution 887\nshould look for the highest point on each distribution. Let\u2019s draw a line from each curve's peak down to the axis, so we\ncan see where these peaks occur:\nFigure8.39\nStep 2:The peak of the red (leftmost) distribution occurs over the number 1 on the horizontal axis. Thus, the mean of\nthe red distribution is 1. Similarly, the mean of the blue (middle) distribution is 2, and the mean of the yellow (rightmost)\ndistribution is 3.\nYOUR TURN8.31\n1. Identify the means of these three distributions:\nEXAMPLE8.32\nIdentifying the Standard Deviation of a Normal Distribution\nThis graph shows three distributions, all with mean 2. What are their standard deviations?\nFigure8.40\nSolution\nStep 1:Identifying the standard deviation from a graph can be a little bit tricky. Let\u2019s focus in on the yellow (lowest\npeaked) curve: 888 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.41\nStep 2:Notice that the graph curves downward in the middle, and curves upwards on the ends. Highlighted in red is the\npart that curves downward and in green, the part that curves upward:\nFigure8.42\nStep 3:The places where the graph changes from curving up to curving down (or vice versa) are calledinflection points.\nLet\u2019s identify where those occur by dropping a line straight down from each:\nFigure8.43\nStep 4:We can estimate that the inflection points occur at and ; the mean is at (as shown by the\nmiddle dotted line). The difference between the mean and the location of either inflection point is the standard\ndeviation; since , we conclude that the standard deviation of the green distribution is 3.\nStep 5:Now, looking at the other two graphs, let's first identify the inflection points:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.6 \u2022 The Normal Distribution 889\nFigure8.44\nStep 6:The red (tallest peaked) distribution has inflection points at 1 and 3, and the mean is 2. Thus, the standard\ndeviation of the red distribution is . The blue (lower peaked) distribution has inflection points at 0 and\n4, and its mean is also 2. So, the standard deviation of the blue distribution is 2.\nYOUR TURN8.32\n1. Estimate the standard deviations of this normal distribution, centered at 5:\nLet\u2019s put it all together to identify a completely unknown normal distribution.\nEXAMPLE8.33\nIdentifying the Mean and Standard Deviation of a Normal Distribution\nUsing the graph, identify the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution.\nFigure8.45 890 8 \u2022 Statistics\nSolution\nStep 1:Let\u2019s start by putting dots on the graph at the peak and at the inflection points, then drop lines from those points\nstraight down to the axis:\nFigure8.46\nStep 2:From the red (middle) line, we can see that the mean of this distribution is 55. The blue (outermost) lines are each\n3 units away from the mean (at 52 and 58), so the standard deviation is 3.\nYOUR TURN8.33\n1. Identify the mean and standard deviation of this distribution. Anything within 5 on the standard deviation is\nacceptable.\nProperties of Normal Distributions: The 68-95-99.7 Rule\nThe most important property of normal distributions is tied to its standard deviation. If a dataset is perfectly normally\ndistributed, then 68% of the data values will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. For example, suppose we\nhave a set of data that follows the normal distribution with mean 400 and standard deviation 100. This means 68% of the\ndata would fall between the values of 300 (one standard deviationbelowthe mean: ) and 500 (one\nstandard deviationabovethe mean: ). Looking at the histogram below, the shaded area represents 68%\nof the total area under the graph and above the axis:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.6 \u2022 The Normal Distribution 891\nFigure8.47\nSince 68% of the area is in the shaded region, this means that of the area is found in the unshaded\nregions. We know that the distribution is symmetric, so that 32% must be divided evenly into the two unshaded tails:\n16% in each.\nOf course, datasets in the real world are never perfect; when dealing with actual data that seem to follow a symmetric,\nbell-shaped distribution, we\u2019ll give ourselves a little bit of wiggle room and say thatapproximately68% of the data fall\nwithin one standard deviation of the mean.\nThe rule for one standard deviation can be extended to two standard deviations. Approximately 95% of a normally\ndistributed dataset will fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. If the mean is 400 and the standard deviation is\n100, that means 95% calculation describes the way we compute standardized scores. (two standard deviationsbelowthe\nmean: ) and 600 (two standard deviationsabovethe mean: ). We can visualize\nthis in the following histogram:\nFigure8.48\nAs before, since 95% of the data are in the shaded area, that leaves 5% of the data to go into the unshaded tails. Since\nthe histogram is symmetric, half of the 5% (that\u2019s 2.5%) is in each.\nWe can even take this one step further: 99.7% of normally distributed data fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.\nIn this example, we\u2019d see 99.7% of the data between 100 (calculated as ) and 700 (calculated as\n). We can see this in the histogram below, although you may need to squint to find the unshaded\nbits in the tails! 892 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.49\nThis observation is formally known as the68-95-99.7 Rule.\nEXAMPLE8.34\nUsing the 68-95-99.7 Rule to Find Percentages\n1.

Let\u2019s build another table:\nMean\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40\nWe can see that 20 and 30 represent one standard deviation above and below the mean, so 68% of the data fall in\nthat range.\n3.

If data are distributed normally with mean 14 and standard deviation 2, between what two values will 99.7% of the\ndata fall?\nSolution\n1. The 68-95-99.7 Rule tells us that 68% of the data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. So, to find the\nvalues we seek, we\u2019ll add and subtract one standard deviation from the mean: and\n. Thus, we know that 68% of the data fall between 80 and 120.\n2.

So, 95% of\nthe data will fall between -30 and 30.\n3. Once again, the 68-95-99.7 Rule tells us that 99.7% of the data will fall within three standard deviations of the mean.\nSo, let\u2019s add and subtract three standard deviations from the mean: and .

If data are distributed normally with mean 200 and standard deviation 30, between what two values will\n99.7% of the data fall?\nThere are more problems we can solve using the 68-95-99.7 Rule. but first we must understand what the rule implies.\nRemember, the rule says that 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean. Thus, with normally\ndistributed data with mean 100 and standard deviation 10, we have this distribution: 894 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.50\nSince we know that 68% of the data lie within one standard deviation of the mean, the implication is that 32% of the data\nmust fallbeyondone standard deviation away from the mean. Since the histogram is symmetric, we can conclude that\nhalf of the 32% (or 16%) is more than one standard deviationabovethe mean and the other half is more than one\nstandard deviationbelowthe mean:\nFigure8.51\nFurther, we know that the middle 68% can be split in half at the peak of the histogram, leaving 34% on either side:\nFigure8.52\nSo, just the \u201c68\u201d part of the 68-95-99.7 Rule gives us four other proportions in addition to the 68% in the rule.

For example, since the proportion between\n100 and 120 is 47.5% and the proportion between 100 and 110 is 34%, we can subtract to find that the proportion\nbetween 110 and 120 is :\nFigure8.55\nEXAMPLE8.36\nFinding Other Proportions Using the 68-95-99.7 Rule\nAssume that we have data that are normally distributed with mean 80 and standard deviation 3.\n1. What proportion of the data will be greater than 86?\n2. What proportion of the data will be between 74 and 77?\n3. What proportion of the data will be between 74 and 83?\nSolution\nBefore we can answer these questions, we must mark off sections that are multiples of the standard deviation away\nfrom the mean: 896 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.56\n1. To figure out what proportion of the data will be greater than 86, let's start by shading in the area of data that are\nabove 86 in our figure, or the data more than two standard deviations above the mean.\nFigure8.57\nWe saw inFigure 8.47that this proportion is 2.5%.\n2.

To figure out what proportion of the data will be between 74 and 83, let's start by shading in that area of data in our\nfigure.\nFigure8.60\nNext, we'll break this region into two pieces at the mean:\nFigure8.61\nFromFigure 8.47, we know the blue (leftmost) region represents 47.5% of the data. And, usingYOUR TURN 8.33, we\nget that the red (rightmost) region covers 34% of the data. Adding those together, the proportion we want is 81.5%.\nYOUR TURN8.36\nSuppose we have data that are normally distributed with mean 500 and standard deviation 100.

This calculation is common enough that it has its own name: thestandardized score. Values above\nthe mean have positive standardized scores, while those below the mean have negative standardized scores. Since it's\ncommon to use the letter to represent a standard score, this value is also often referred to as a -score.\nSo far, we\u2019ve only really considered -scores that are whole numbers, but in general they can be any number at all. For\nexample, if we have data that are normally distributed with mean 80 and standard deviation 6, the value 85 is five units\nabove the mean, which is less than one standard deviation. Dividing by the standard deviation, we get . Since 85 is of\none standard deviation above the mean, we\u2019d say that the standardized score for 85 is (which is positive, since\n). This calculation describes the way we compute standardized scores.\nFORMULA\nIf is a member of a normally distributed dataset with mean and standard deviation , then the standardized score\nfor is\nIf you know a -score but not the original data value , you can find it by solving the previous equation for :\nThe symbols and are the Greek lettersmuandsigma. They are the analogues of the English letters and ,\nwhich stand formeanandstandard deviation.\nIf you convert every data value in a dataset into its -score, the resulting set of data will have mean 0 and standard\ndeviation 1. This is why we call thesestandardized scores: the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard\ndeviation 1 is often called thestandard normal distribution.\nEXAMPLE8.37\nStandardizing Data\nSuppose we have data that are normally distributed with mean 50 and standard deviation 6. Compute the standardized\nscores (rounded to three decimal places) for these data values:\n1. 52\n2. 40\n3. 68\nSolution\nFor each of these, we\u2019ll plug the given values into the formula.

However, if the -score is not a whole\nnumber, the Rule isn\u2019t going to help us. Luckily, we can use technology to help us out. We\u2019ll talk here about the built-in\nfunctions in Google Sheets, but other tools work similarly.\nLet\u2019s say we\u2019re working with normally distributed data with mean 40 and standard deviation 7, and we want to know at\nwhat percentile a data value of 50 would fall. That corresponds to finding the proportion of the data that are less than\n50. If we create our histogram and mark off whole-number multiples of the standard deviation like we did before, we\u2019ll\nsee why the 68-95-99.7 Rule isn\u2019t going to help:\nFigure8.62\nSince 50 doesn\u2019t line up with one of our lines, the 68-95-99.7 Rule fails us. Looking back atFigure 8.47andFigure 8.48,\nthe best we can say is that 50 is between the 84th and 99.5th percentiles, but that\u2019s a pretty wide range. Google Sheets\nhas a function that can help; it\u2019s called NORM.DIST. Here\u2019s how to use it:\n1. Click in an empty cell in your worksheet. 900 8 \u2022 Statistics\n2. Type \u201c=NORM.DIST(\u201c\n3. Inside the parentheses, we must enter a list of four things, separated by commas: the data value, the mean, the\nstandard deviation, and the word \u201cTRUE\u201d. These have to be entered in this order!\n4. Close the parentheses, and hit Enter. The result is then displayed in the cell; convert it to a percent to get the\npercentile.\nSo, for our example, we should type \u201c=NORM.DIST(50, 40, 7, TRUE)\u201d into an empty cell, and hit Enter. The result is\n0.9234362745; converting to a percent and rounding, we can conclude that 50 is at the 92nd percentile. Let\u2019s walk\nthrough a few more examples.\nEXAMPLE8.39\nUsing Google Sheets to Find Percentiles\nSuppose we have data that are normally distributed with mean 28 and standard deviation 4. At what percentile do each\nof the following data values fall?\n1. 30\n2. 23\n3. 35\nSolution\n1. By entering \u201c=NORM.DIST(30, 28, 4, TRUE)\u201d we find that 30 is at the 69th percentile.\n2. By entering \u201c=NORM.DIST(23, 28, 4, TRUE)\u201d we find that 23 is at the 11th percentile.\n3.

Suppose you have data that are normally distributed with mean 20 and standard deviation 6. Determine at what\npercentiles these data values fall: 25, 12, and 31.\nGoogle Sheets can also help us go the other direction: If we want to find the data value that corresponds to a given\npercentile, we can use the NORM.INV function. For example, if we have normally distributed data with mean 150 and\nstandard deviation 25, we can find the data value at the 30th percentile as follows:\n1. Click on an empty cell in your worksheet.\n2. Type \u201c=NORM.INV(\u201c\n3.

These must be entered in this order!\n4. Close the parentheses and hit Enter. The desired data value will be in the cell!\nIn our example, we want the 30th percentile; converting 30% to a decimal gives us 0.3. So, we\u2019ll type \u201c=NORM.INV(0.3,\n150, 25)\u201d to get 136.8899872; let\u2019s round that off to 137.\nEXAMPLE8.40\nUsing Google Sheets to Find the Data Value Corresponding to a Percentile\nSuppose we have data that are normally distributed with mean 47 and standard deviation 9.

(credit: \u201cTaking a Test\u201d by Marco Verch\nProfessional Photographer/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Apply the normal distribution to real-world scenarios.\nAs we saw inThe Normal Distribution, the word \u201cstandardized\u201d is closely associated with the normal distribution. This is\nwhy tests like college entrance exams, state achievement tests for K\u201312 students, and Advanced Placement tests are\noften called \u201cstandardized tests\u201d: scores are assigned in a way that forces them to follow a normal distribution, with a\nmean and standard deviation that are consistent from year to year. Standardization also allows people like college\nadmissions officers to directly compare an applicant who took the ACT (a college entrance exam) to an applicant who\ninstead chose to take the SAT (a different college entrance exam). Standardization allows us to compare individuals from\ndifferent groups; this is among the most important applications of the normal distribution. We\u2019ll explore this and other\nreal-world uses of the normal distribution in this section.\nCollege Entrance Exams\nThere are two good ways to compare two data values from different groups: using -scores and using percentiles. The\ntwo methods will always give consistent results (meaning that we won\u2019t find, for example, that the first value is better\nusing -scores but the second value is better using percentiles), so use whichever method is more comfortable for you.\nEXAMPLE8.41\nEvaluating College Entrance Exam Scores\nAccording to theDigest of Education Statistics(https://openstax.org/r/nces_ed_gov), composite scores on the SAT have\nmean 1060 and standard deviation 195, while composite scores on the ACT have mean 21 and standard deviation 5.\n1. At what percentile would an SAT score of 990 fall?\n2. What is thez-score of an ACT score of 27?\n3. Which is better: a score of 1450 on the SAT or 29 on the ACT?\nSolution\n1. Using Google Sheets, we can answer this question with the formula \u201c=NORM.DIST(990, 1060, 195, TRUE)\u201d. A score of\n990 would fall at the 36th percentile.\n2. Using the formula , we get .\n3. Let\u2019s compare the values using both percentiles and -values:\nPercentiles:Using \u201c=NORM.DIST(1450, 1060, 195, TRUE)\u201d we find that an SAT score of 1450 is at the 98th percentile.\nMeanwhile, by entering \u201c=NORM.DIST(29, 21, 5, TRUE)\u201d we see that an ACT score of 29 is around the 95th percentile.\nSince it\u2019s at a higher percentile, we can conclude that an SAT score of 1450 is better than an ACT score of 29. 904 8 \u2022 Statistics\n-scores:Using the formula, we see that the -score for an SAT score of 1450 is , while the\n-score for an ACT score of 29 is . Since it has a higher -score, an SAT score of 1450 is better than\nan ACT score of 29.\nYOUR TURN8.41\nAccording tothe Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)(https://openstax.org/r/mba_com), the mean\nscore on the GMAT (an entrance exam for graduate schools in business management) is 565, with standard\ndeviation 116. For the LSAT (an entrance exam for law schools),Kaplan(https://openstax.org/r/kaptest_com)informs\nus that the mean score is 150 with standard deviation 10.\n1. What is the -score for a GMAT score of 715?\n2. At what percentile is an LSAT score of 166?\n3. Which is better: a GMAT score of 650 or an LSAT score of 161?\nCoin flipping\nIn the opening ofThe Normal Distribution, we saw that the number of heads we get when we flip a coin 100 times is\ndistributed normally. It can be shown that if is the number of flips, then the mean of that distribution is and the\nstandard deviation is (as long as ). So, for 100 flips, the mean of the distribution is 50 and the standard\ndeviation is 5. In that opening example, one of our early runs gave us 70 heads in 100 flips, which we noted seemed\nunusual. Using the normal distribution, we can identify exactly how unusual that really is. Using Google Sheets, the\nformula \u201c=NORM.DIST(70, 50, 5, TRUE)\u201d gives us 0.999968, which is the 99.997th percentile! How is that useful? Suppose\nyou need to test whether a coin is fair, and so you flip it 100 times. While we might be suspicious if we get 70 heads out\nof the 100 flips, we now have a numerical measure for how unusual that is: If the coin were fair, we would expect to see\n70 heads (or more) only of the time. That\u2019s really unlikely! Analysis like this is related to\nhypothesis testing, an important application of statistics in the sciences and social sciences.\nEXAMPLE8.42\nFlipping a Coin\nLet\u2019s say we flip a coin 64 times and count the number of heads.\n1. What would be the mean of the corresponding distribution?\n2. What would be the standard deviation of the corresponding distribution?\n3. Suppose we got 25 heads, which seems a little low. At what percentile would 25 heads fall?\nSolution\n1. Since , the mean is .\n2. Again using , we get a standard deviation of .\n3. Using \u201c=NORM.DIST(25, 32, 4, TRUE)\u201d, we see that 25 heads is at the 4th percentile.

InExample 8.12, we created a\nhistogram for these data:\nFigure8.64(data source: https://data.ed.gov)\nThis distribution is fairly symmetric (it\u2019s just a little right-skewed) and bell-shaped, so we can use normal distribution\ntechniques to analyze the data.\n1. What is the mean of these average SAT scores?\n2. What is the standard deviation of these SAT scores?\n3. Using the answers to the previous two questions, use NORM.DIST in Google Sheets to estimate at what percentile\nthe University at Buffalo in New York (average SAT: 1250) falls.\n4. Use PERCENTRANK to find the actual percentile of the University at Buffalo, and see how close the estimate in the\nprevious question came.\nSolution\n1. Using the AVERAGE function in Google Sheets, we find that the mean is 1141.174.\n2. Using the STDEV function, we get that the standard deviation is 125.517.\n3. Entering \u201c=NORM.DIST(1250, 1141, 125.517, TRUE)\u201d into Google Sheets, we estimate that the University at Buffalo is\nat the 81st percentile.\n4. Using PERCENTRANK, we find that the actual percentile is the 84th. These are close!\nYOUR TURN8.43\n1.

Recently, a team at Duke University has been using statistics\nto help identify partisan gerrymandering, where electoral districts have been carefully drawn in a way that benefits\none political party over another.

How do you know?\n8.8 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines\nFigure8.65A scatter plot is a visualization of the relationship between quantitative dataset.\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Construct a scatter plot for a dataset.\n2. Interpret a scatter plot.\n3. Distinguish among positive, negative and no correlation.\n4. Compute the correlation coefficient.\n5. Estimate and interpret regression lines.\nOne of the most powerful tools statistics gives us is the ability to explore relationships between two datasets containing\nquantitative values, and then use that relationship to make predictions. For example, a student who wants to know how\nwell they can expect to score on an upcoming final exam may consider reviewing the data on midterm and final exam\nscores for students who have previously taken the class. It seems reasonable to expect that there is a relationship\nbetween those two datasets: If a student did well on the midterm, they were probably more likely to do well on the final\nthan the average student. Similarly, if a student did poorly on the midterm, they probably also did poorly on the final\nexam.\nOf course, that relationship isn\u2019t set in stone; a student\u2019s performance on a midterm exam doesn\u2019t cement their\nperformance on the final! A student might use a poor result on the midterm as motivation to study more for the final. A\nstudent with a really good grade on the midterm might be overconfident going into the final, and as a result doesn\u2019t\nprepare adequately.\nThe statistical method ofregressioncan find a formula that does the best job of predicting a score on the final exam\nbased on the student\u2019s score on the midterm, as well as give a measure of the confidence of that prediction! In this\nsection, we\u2019ll discover how to use regression to make these predictions. First, though, we need to lay some graphical\ngroundwork. 908 8 \u2022 Statistics\nRelationships Between Quantitative Datasets\nBefore we can evaluate a relationship between two datasets, we must first decide if we feel that one might depend on\nthe other. In our exam example, it is appropriate to say that the score on the final depends on the score on the midterm,\nrather than the other way around: if the midterm depended on the final, then we\u2019d need to know the final scorefirst,\nwhich doesn\u2019t make sense.\nHere\u2019s another example: if we collected data on home purchases in a certain area, and noted both the sale price of the\nhouse and the annual household income of the purchaser, we might expect a relationship between those two. Which\ndepends on the other? In this case, sale price depends on income: people who have a higher income can afford a more\nexpensive house. If it were the other way around, people could buy a new, more expensive house and then expect a\nraise! (This is very bad advice.)\nIt's worth noting that not every pair of related datasets has clear dependence. For example, consider the percent of a\ncountry\u2019s budget devoted to the military and the percent earmarked for public health. These datasets are generally\nrelated: as one goes up, the other goes down. However, in this case, there\u2019s not a preferred choice for dependence, as\neach could be seen as depending on the other. When exploring the relationship between two datasets, if one set seems\nto depend on the other, we\u2019ll say that dataset contains values of theresponse variable(ordependent variable). The\ndataset that the response variable depends on contains values of what we call theexplanatory variable(or\nindependent variable). If no dependence relationship can be identified, then we can assign either dataset to either role.\nEXAMPLE8.44\nIdentifying Explanatory and Response Variables\nFor each of the following pairs of related datasets, identify which (if any) should be assigned the role of response variable\nand which should be assigned to be the explanatory variable.\n1. A person\u2019s height and weight\n2. A professional basketball player\u2019s salary and their average points scored per game (which is a measure of how good\nthey are at basketball)\n3. The length and width of leaves on a tree\nSolution\n1. As people get taller, their weight tends to increase. But if a person goes on a diet and loses weight, we don\u2019t expect\nthem to also get shorter. So, weight depends on height. That means we\u2019ll say that the response variable isweight\nand the explanatory variable isheight.\n2. The more points a basketball player scores, the more money they should make. But if a basketball player gets a\nraise, we wouldn\u2019t expect them to get better at basketball as a result. So, the response issalaryand the explanatory\nispoints per game.\n3. The way that the length and width of leaves are connected isn\u2019t clear. It seems reasonable that as the width goes up,\nso would the length. But the other direction is also plausible: as the length goes up, so does the width. Without a\nclear dependence relationship, we\u2019re free to declare either to be the response and the other to be the explanatory.\nYOUR TURN8.44\nGiven these pairs of datasets, identify which (if either) would be the best choice for theresponsevariable.\n1. A person\u2019s age and their annual income\n2. A student\u2019s GPA and their score on the SAT\n3. A student\u2019s GPA and the number of hours they spend studying per week\nOnce we\u2019ve assigned roles to our two datasets, we can take the first step in visualizing the relationship between them:\ncreating a scatter plot.\nCreating Scatter Plots\nAscatter plotis a visualization of the relationship between two quantitative sets of data. The scatter plot is created by\nturning the datasets into ordered pairs: the first coordinate contains data values from the explanatory dataset, and the\nsecond coordinate contains thecorrespondingdata values from the response dataset. These ordered pairs are then\nplotted in the -plane. Let's return to our exam example to put this into practice.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 909\nEXAMPLE8.45\nCreating Scatter Plots Without Technology\nStudents are exploring the relationship between scores on the midterm exam and final exam in their math course. Here\nare some of the scores reported by their classmates:\nName Midterm grade Final grade\nStudent 1 88 84\nStudent 2 71 80\nStudent 3 75 77\nStudent 4 94 95\nStudent 5 68 73\nCreate a scatter plot to visualize the data.\nSolution\nStep 1:Since it makes more sense to think of the final exam score as being dependent on the midterm exam score, we\u2019ll\nlet the final grade be the response. So, let\u2019s think of these two datasets as a set of ordered pairs, midterm first, final\nsecond:\nName (Midterm, Final)\nStudent 1 (88, 84)\nStudent 2 (71, 80)\nStudent 3 (75, 77)\nStudent 4 (94, 95)\nStudent 5 (68, 73)\nStep 2:Next, let\u2019s make the axes. On the horizontal axis, make sure the range of values is sufficient to cover all of the\nexplanatory data. For our data, that\u2019s 68 to 94. Similarly, the vertical axis should cover all of the response data (73 to 95):\nFigure8.66 910 8 \u2022 Statistics\nStep 3:Our first point is (88, 84). So, we\u2019ll locate 88 on the horizontal axis, 84 on the vertical axis, and identify the point\nthat\u2019s directly above the first location and horizontally level with the second:\nFigure8.67\nStep 4:Repeat this process to place the other four points on the graph:\nFigure8.68\nStep 5:Finally, label the axes:\nFigure8.69\nYOUR TURN8.45\n1.

Luckily, Google Sheets automates this process for us.\nVIDEO\nMaking Scatter Plots in Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Scatter-Plots)\nEXAMPLE8.46\nCreating Scatter Plots in Google Sheets\nThe dataset\u201cNHL19\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)gives the results of the 2018\u20132019 National Hockey\nLeague season. The columns are team, wins (W), losses (L), overtime losses (OTL), total points (PTS), goals scored by the\nteam (GF), goals scored against the team (GA), and goal differential (the difference in GF and GA). Use Google Sheets to\ncreate a scatter plot for GF vs. GA.\nWhen we talk about plotting one set versus another, the first is the response and the second is explanatory.\nSolution\nStep 1:Open the dataset in Google Sheets, and click and drag to select the data we want to visualize (in this case, we\nwant the columns for GF and GA; make sure you include those labels in the selection).\nStep 2:Next, click on the \u201cInsert\u201d menu, then click \u201cChart.\u201d Sheets will automatically choose a chart format; if the result\nisn\u2019t a scatter plot, click on the drop-down menu under \u201cChart type\u201d in the Chart Editor on the right side of the window\nand select \u201cScatter chart.\u201d\nStep 3:Next, check that the correct choices were made for the horizontal and vertical axes. In this case, we want to see\nGF on the vertical axis and GA on the horizontal axis. If Sheets made the wrong choice, we can fix it in the Chart Editor by\nclicking on the name of the dataset under \u201cX-axis\u201d to open up a dropdown menu, then selecting the variable that should\ngo on the horizontal axis (GA in this case).\nStep 4:Now, click on the variable under \u201cSeries\u201d and select the one that should go on the vertical axis (GF). If you had to\nmake that change, the axis labels in the graph may also need changing; those labels can be fixed using the \u201cCustomize\u201d\ntab in the Chart Editor under \u201cChart & axis titles.\u201d Your result should look like this: 912 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.70(data source: www.nhl.com)\nYOUR TURN8.46\n1. With the data in\"NHL19,\"(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)use Google Sheets to create a scatter plot\nfor points (PTS) vs. wins (W).\nReading and Interpreting Scatter Plots\nScatter plots give us information about the existence and strength of a relationship between two datasets. To break that\ninformation down, there are a series of questions we might ask to help us. First: Is there a curved pattern in the data? If\nthe answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then we can stop; none of the linear regression techniques from here to the end of this section are\nappropriate.Figure 8.71andFigure 8.74show several examples of scatter plots that can help us identify these curved\npatterns.\nFigure8.71Curved pattern\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 913\nFigure8.72No curved pattern\nFigure8.73Curved pattern\nFigure8.74No curved pattern\nOnce we have confirmed that there is no curved pattern in our data, we can move to the next question: Is there a linear\nrelationship? To answer this, we must look at different values of the explanatory variable and determine whether the\ncorresponding response values are different,on average. It's important to look at the values \u201con average\u201d because, in\ngeneral, our scatter plots won\u2019t include just one corresponding response point for each value of the explanatory variable\n(i.e., there may be multiple response values for each explanatory value). So, we try to look for the center of those points.\nLet\u2019s look again atFigure 8.74, but consider some different values for the explanatory variable. Let\u2019s highlight the points\nwhose -values are around 50 and those that are around 80: 914 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.75\nNow, we can estimate the middle of each group of points. Let's add our estimated averages to the plot as starred points:\nFigure8.76\nSince those two starred points occur at different heights, we can conclude that there\u2019s likely a relationship worth\nexploring.\nHere\u2019s another example using a different set of data:\nFigure8.77\nLet\u2019s look again at the points near 50 and near 80, and estimate the middles of those clusters:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 915\nFigure8.78\nNotice that there\u2019s not much vertical distance between our two starred points. This tells us that there\u2019s not a strong\nrelationship between these two datasets.\nPositive and Negative Linear Relationships\nAnother way to assess whether there is a relationship between two datasets in a scatter plot is to see if the points seem\nto be clustered around a line (specifically, a line that\u2019s not horizontal). The stronger the clustering around that line is, the\nstronger the relationship.\nOnce we\u2019ve established that there\u2019s a relationship worth exploring, it\u2019s time to start quantifying that relationship. Two\ndatasets have apositive linear relationshipif the values of the response tend to increase, on average, as the values of\nthe explanatory variable increase. If the values of the responsedecreasewith increasing values of the explanatory\nvariable, then there is anegative linear relationshipbetween the two datasets. The strength of the relationship is\ndetermined by how closely the scatter plot follows a single straight line: the closer the points are to that line, the\nstronger the relationship. The scatter plots inFigure 8.74toFigure 8.80depict varying strengths and directions of linear\nrelationships.\nFigure8.79Perfect negative relationship 916 8 \u2022 Statistics\nFigure8.80Strong negative relationship\nFigure8.81Weak negative relationship\nFigure8.82No relationship\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 917\nFigure8.83Weak positive relationship\nFigure8.84Strong positive relationship\nFigure8.85Perfect positive relationship\nThe strength and direction (positive or negative) of a linear relationship can also be measured with a statistic called the\ncorrelation coefficient(denoted ). Positive values of indicate a positive relationship, while negative values of\nindicate a negative relationship. Values of close to 0 indicate a weak relationship, while values close to correspond\nto a very strong relationship. Looking again atFigure 8.74toFigure 8.80, the correlation coefficients for each, in\nsequential order, are: \u20121, \u20120.97, \u20120.55, \u20120.03, 0.61, 0.97, and 1.\nThere\u2019s no firm rule that establishes a cutoff value of to divide strong relationships from weak ones, but is often\ngiven as the dividing line (i.e., if or the relationship is strong, and if the relationship is\nweak). 918 8 \u2022 Statistics\nThe formula for computing is very complicated; it\u2019s almost never done without technology. Google Sheets will do the\ncomputation for you using the CORREL function. The syntax works like this: if your explanatory values are in cells A2 to\nA50 and the corresponding response values are in B2 to B50, then you can find the correlation coefficient by entering\n\u201c=CORREL(A2:A50, B2:B50)\u201d. (Note that the order doesn\u2019t matter for correlation coefficients; \u201c=CORREL(B2:B50, A2:A50)\u201d\nwill give the same result.)\nLet\u2019s put all of this together in an example.\nEXAMPLE8.47\nInterpreting Scatter Plots\nConsider the four scatter plots below:\n1.\nFigure8.86\n2.\nFigure8.87\n3.\nFigure8.88\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 919\n4.\nFigure8.89\nFor each of these, answer the following questions:\na.

Yes, there is a curved pattern.\n2. a. No, there\u2019s no curved pattern.\nb. Since the points tend upward as we move from left to right, this is a positive relationship. The points seem\npretty closely grouped around a line, so it\u2019s fairly strong. Comparing this scatter plot to those inFigure 8.79to\nFigure 8.85, we can see that the relationship is stronger than the one inFigure 8.83( ) but not as strong\nas the one inFigure 8.84( ). So, the value of the correlation coefficient is somewhere between the two.\nWe might guess that .\n3. a. No, there\u2019s no curved pattern.\nb. Since the points tend downward as we move from left to right, this is a negative relationship. The points are not\ntightly grouped around a line, but the pattern is clear. It looks like it has approximately the same strength as\nthe plot inFigure 8.83, just with the opposite sign. So, we might guess that .\n4. a. No, there\u2019s no curved pattern.\nb.

Round to the nearest hundredth.\nWORK IT OUT\nWinning with Statistics\nBilly Beane, the former general manager of the Oakland A\u2019s baseball team, famously took his low budget team to\nunprecedented heights by using statistics to identify undervalued players; his story is recounted in the book\nMoneyball(which was later made into a movie, with Brad Pitt playing Beane). You can do the same thing: Take a look\nat team statistics in the sport of your choice(https://openstax.org/r/sports-reference)and try to identify a statistic\nthat\u2019s most closely related to winning (meaning that it has the highest correlation coefficient with team wins).\nLinear Regression\nThe final step in our analysis of the relationship between two datasets is to find and use the equation of the regression\nline. For a given set of explanatory and response data, theregression line(also called theleast-squares lineorline of\nbest fit) is the line that does the best job of approximating the data.\nWhat does it mean to say that a particular line does the \u201cbest job\u201d of approximating the data? The way that statisticians 922 8 \u2022 Statistics\ncharacterize this \u201cbest line\u201d is rather technical, but we\u2019ll include it for the sake of satisfying your curiosity (and backing up\nthe claim of \"best\"). Imagine drawing a line that looks like it does a pretty good job of approximating the data. Most of\nthe points in the scatter plot will probably not fall exactly on the line; the distance above or below the line a given point\nfalls is called that point\u2019sresidual. We could compute the residuals for every point in the scatter plot. If you take all those\nresiduals and square them, then add the results together, you get a statistic called thesum of squared errorsfor the line\n(the name tells you what it is: \u201csum\u201d because we\u2019re adding, \u201csquared\u201d because we\u2019re squaring, and \u201cerrors\u201d is another\nword for \u201cresiduals\u201d). The line that we choose to be the \u201cbest\u201d is the one that has the smallest possible sum of squared\nerrors. The implied minimization (\u201csmallest\u201d) is where the \u201cleast\u201d in \u201cleast squares\u201d comes from; the \u201csquares\u201d comes from\nthe fact that we\u2019re minimizing the sum ofsquarederrors. This is very similar to the process we outlined in the \"game\"\nthat we used to introduce the mean. Both the regression line and the mean are designed to minimize a sum of squared\nerrors. Here ends the super technical part.\nFinding the Equation of the Regression Line\nSo, how do we find the equation of the regression line? Recall the point-slope form of the equation of a line:\nFORMULA\nIf a line has slope and passes through a point , then the point-slope form of the equation of the line is:\nThe regression line has two properties that we can use to find its equation. First, it always passes through thepoint of\nmeans. If and are the means of the explanatory and response datasets, respectively, then the point of means is\n. We\u2019ll use that as the point in the point-slope form of the equation. Second, if and are the standard\ndeviations of the explanatory and response datasets, respectively, and if is the correlation coefficient, then the slope is\n. Putting all that together with the point-slope formula gives us this:\nFORMULA\nSuppose and are explanatory and response datasets that have a linear relationship. If their means are and\nrespectively, their standard deviations are and respectively, and their correlation coefficient is , then the\nequation of the regression line is:\n.\nLet's walk through an example.\nEXAMPLE8.49\nFinding the Equation of the Regression Line from Statistics\nSuppose you have datasets and with the following statistics: has mean 21 and standard deviation 4, has mean 8\nand standard deviation 2, and their correlation coefficient is \u22120.4.

Suppose you have datasets and with the following statistics: has mean 100 and standard deviation 5, has\nmean 200 and standard deviation 20, and their correlation coefficient is 0.75. What\u2019s the equation of the\nregression line?\nAs you can see, finding the equation of the regression line involves a lot of steps if you have to find all of the values of\nthe needed quantities yourself. But, as usual, technology comes to our rescue. This video (which you actually watched\nearlier when learning how to create scatter plots) covers the regression line at around the 3:30 mark. Note that Google\nSheets calls it the \"trendline.\"\nLet's put this into practice.\nEXAMPLE8.50\nFinding the Equation of the Regression Line Using Google Sheets\nInExample 8.46, we considered the relationship between goals scored (GF) and goals against (GA) using the dataset\n\u201cNHL19\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets). Recreate the scatter plot in Google Sheets, and use it to find the\nequation of the regression line.\nSolution\nOnce we have recreated the scatter plot, we find the equation of the regression line by clicking the three dots at the top\nright of the plot, selecting \u201cEdit chart,\u201d then clicking on \u201cCustomize\u201d and \u201cSeries.\u201d We add the regression line by checking\nthe box next to \u201cTrendline,\u201d and then we show the equation by selecting \u201cUse Equation\u201d in the drop-down menu under\n\u201cLabel.\u201d The equation of the tangent line is .\nYOUR TURN8.50\n1. In Your Turn 8.46, you created a scatter plot for points (PTS) vs. wins (W) using the dataset\u201cNHL19\u201d\n(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets). Recreate the scatter plot in Google Sheets, and use it to find the\nequation of the regression line.\nUsing the Equation of the Regression Line\nOnce we\u2019ve found the equation of the regression line, what do we do with it? We\u2019ll look at two possible applications:\nmaking predictions and interpreting the slope.\nWe can use the equation of the regression line to predict the response value for a given explanatory value . All we\nhave to do is plug that explanatory value into the formula and see what response value results. This is useful in two\nways: first, it can be used to make a guess about an unknown data value (like one that hasn\u2019t been observed yet).\nSecond, it can be used to evaluate performance (meaning, we can predict an outcome given a particular event). In\nExample 8.45, we created a scatter plot of final exam scores vs. midterm exam scores using this data:\nName Midterm Grade Final Grade\nAllison 88 84\nBenjamin 71 80\nCarly 75 77\nDaniel 94 95\nElmo 68 73 924 8 \u2022 Statistics\nThe equation of the regression line is , where is the final exam score and is the midterm exam\nscore. If Frank scored 85 on the midterm, then our prediction for his final exam score is . To\nuse the regression line to evaluate performance, we use a data value we\u2019ve already observed. For example, Allison\nscored 88 on the midterm. The regression line predicts that someone who scores an 88 on the midterm will get\non the final. Allison actually scored 84 on the final, meaning she underperformed\nexpectations by almost 4 points .\nThe second application of the equation of the regression line is interpreting the slope of the line to describe the\nrelationship between the explanatory and response datasets. For the exam data in the previous paragraph, the slope of\nthe regression line is 0.687. Recall that the slope of a line can be computed by finding two points on the line and dividing\nthe difference in the -values of those points by the difference in the -values. Keeping that in mind, we can interpret our\nslope as . Multiplying both sides of that equation by the denominator of the fraction,\nwe get . Thus, a one-point increase in the midterm score\nwould result in a predicted increase in the final score of 0.687 points. A ten-point drop in the midterm score would give\nus a decrease in the predicted final score of 6.87 points. In general, the slope gives us the predicted change in the\nresponse that corresponds to a one unit increase in the explanatory variable.\nEXAMPLE8.51\nApplying the Equation of the Regression Line\nThe data in\u201cMLB2019Off\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)gives offensive team stats for the 2019 Major\nLeague Baseball season. Use that dataset to answer the following questions:\n1. What is the equation of the regression line for runs (R) vs. hits (H)?\n2. How many runs would we expect a team to score if the team got 1500 hits in a season?\n3. Did the Kansas City Royals (KCR) overperform or underperform in terms of runs scored, based on their hit total? By\nhow much?\n4. Write a sentence to interpret the slope of the regression line.\nSolution\n1. Using Google Sheets, we find that the regression line equation is , where is the number of runs\nscored and is the number of hits.\n2. Plugging 1500 into the equation of the regression line, we get . We would predict that a\nteam with 1500 hits would score 870 runs.\n3. The Royals had 1356 hits, so we would predict their run total to be . They actually scored\n691 runs, so they underperformed expectations by 52 runs .\n4. The slope gives us the predicted change in the response that corresponds to a one unit increase in the explanatory\nvariable. So, we expect one additional hit to result in 0.884 more runs. Since 0.884 runs doesn\u2019t really make sense,\nwe can get a better interpretation by multiplying through by ten or one hundred: Ten additional hits will result in\nalmost nine additional runs, or a hundred additional hits will yield on average just over 88 additional runs.\nYOUR TURN8.51\nUsing the\u201cMLB2019Off\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)dataset, answer the following:\n1. What is the equation of the regression line for the number of times a runner is caught stealing a base (CS) vs.\nthe number of successful stolen bases (SB)?\n2. How many times would we expect a team to be caught stealing if the team steals 70 bases in a season?\n3. Did the Philadelphia Phillies (PHI) overperform or underperform in terms of getting caught stealing, based on\ntheir stolen base total? By how much?\n4.

According tothe American Statistical Association(https://openstax.org/r/\nAmerican-Statistical-Association), not only do producers use statistics to identify the next potential blockbuster, but\nthey\u2019ve also pinned down how much money awards add to the bottom line. (An Academy Award is worth about $3\nmillion!) In addition, studios use their streaming services to gather data about their customers and the types of\nmovies they watch; this data helps them learn what kinds of entertainment their customers want more of.\nWORK IT OUT\nCollecting and Analyzing Your Own Data\nThis section has demonstrated many pairs of related quantitative datasets. Think about some quantitative variables\nthat you can ask your classmates about, which might be related. Once you have some ideas, collect the data from\nyour classmates. Then analyze the data by creating a scatter plot, finding the equation of the regression line (if\nappropriate), and interpreting it.\nExtrapolation\nA very common misuse of regression techniques involvesextrapolation, which involves making a prediction about\nsomething that doesn't belong in the dataset.\nEXAMPLE8.52\nMore Applying the Equation of the Regression Line\nThe data in\u201cWNBA2019\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)gives team statistics from the 2019 WNBA season.\nUse that dataset to answer these questions about team wins (W) and the proportion of team field goals made (FG%, the\nnumber of shots made divided by the number of shots attempted. Even though this column is labeled using a percent\nsign, the values are not expressed as percentages):\n1. What is the equation of the regression line for wins vs. proportion of made field goals?\n2. How many wins would we expect for a team that makes 42% of its shots?\n3. Did the New York Liberty overperform or underperform in terms of wins, based on the team\u2019s proportion of made\nfield goals?\n4. Write a sentence to interpret the slope of the regression line.\nSolution\n1. Using Google Sheets, we get the equation , where is the proportion of field goals made\nand is the number of wins.\n2. Since 42% corresponds to a proportion of 0.42, we\u2019ll plug 0.42 into the regression equation for , which gives us\n. We would predict that a team that makes 42% of its shots would win about 16\ngames.\n3. The New York Liberty made 41.4% of their shots, so we expect they would have\nwins. In fact, they had only 10 wins, so they underperformed expectations by over 5 wins.\n4. Step 1:The slope gives us the expected increase in the response that corresponds to a one unit increase in the\nexplanatory variable. If we simply go with that interpretation, we would get a sentence like \u201cWe expect an increase\nin proportion of field goals made of 1 would result in an additional 178 wins.\u201d However, that sentence doesn't make\nmuch sense. Let's consider why.\nStep 2:First, proportions must be between 0 and 1, the proportion of made field goals can\u2019t be increased by 1 and\nstill make sense. Second, the total number of games played is only 34, so no team could get an additional 178 wins!\nSo, we\u2019ll have to change the units.\nStep 3:Since the proportions of made field goals are often expressed as a percentage, we could try to use that. If\nwe express the slope as a fraction with 1 in the denominator (remember, the denominator represents the 926 8 \u2022 Statistics\nproportion of field goals made), then convert the denominator to a percentage and simplify, we get\n.\nStep 4:So, an increase in field goal percentage of 1% would result in an expected increase of 1.78 wins.\nYOUR TURN8.52\nUse the data in\u201cWNBA2019\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets)to answer these questions about the\nrelationship between the proportion of made field goals (FG%) and the proportion of made three-point field goals\n(3P%):\n1. What is the equation of the regression line for proportion of made three-point field goals vs. proportion of\nmade field goals?\n2. What proportion of made three-point field goals would we expect for a team that makes 44% of its field\ngoals?\n3. Did the Dallas Wings overperform or underperform in terms of proportion of made three-point field goals,\nbased on the team\u2019s proportion of made field goals?\n4. Write a sentence to interpret the slope of the regression line.\nCorrelation Does Not Imply Causation\nOne of the most common fallacies about statistics has to do with the relationship between two datasets. In the dataset\n\u201cPublic\u201d(https://openstax.org/r/Chapter8_Data-Sets), we find that the correlation coefficient between the 75th percentile\nmath SAT score and the 75th percentile verbal SAT score is 0.92, which is really strong. The slope of the regression line\nthat predicts the verbal score from the math score is 0.729, which we might interpret as follows: \u201cIf the 75th percentile\nmath SAT score goes up by 10 points, we\u2019d expect the corresponding verbal SAT score to go up by just over 7 points.\u201d\nDoes the increasing math scorecausethe increase in the verbal score? Probably not. What\u2019s really going on is that\nthere\u2019s a third variable that\u2019s affecting them both: To raise the SAT math score by 10 points, a school will recruit students\nwho do better on the SAT in general; these students will also naturally have higher SAT verbal scores. This third variable\nis sometimes called alurking variableor aconfounding variable. Unless all possible lurking variables are ruled out, we\ncannot conclude that one thing causes another.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.8 \u2022 Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines 927\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nDr. Talithia Williams\nFigure8.90A photo of Dr. Williams (credit: Used by permission of Talithia Williams)\nDr. Talithia Williams is a statistician on the faculty of Harvey Mudd College, and the first Black woman to achieve\ntenure at this university.

Eugenicists took Charles Darwin\u2019s theories of evolution and ruthlessly\napplied them to the human race. Francis Galton (1822\u20131911), a cousin of Darwin and also the mathematician who\ninvented the formula for standard deviation, claimed that people in the British upper classes possessed higher 928 8 \u2022 Statistics\nintelligence due to their superior breeding. Karl Pearson (1857\u20131936), who derived the formula for the correlation\ncoefficient, argued inNational Life from the Standpoint of Science, that, instead of providing social welfare programs,\nnations could better improve the fortunes of the poor by waging \u201cwar with inferior races.\u201d Ronald Fisher (1890\u20131962)\nwas possibly the most important statistician of the 20th century, having invented several new techniques (including\nthe ubiquitous analysis of variance), and yet he also founded the Cambridge University Undergraduates Eugenics\nSociety, whose self-prescribed goal was to evangelize \u201cnot by precept only, but by example, the doctrine of a new\nnatural ability of worth and blood.\u201d\nWhen eugenics took hold in the United States, it was used to justify terrible acts by the government, including the\nforced sterilization of individuals with mental illness, epilepsy, a physical impairment (like blindness), or a criminal\nhistory. The Nazi regime took these ideas to their ultimate, terrible conclusion: killing people who had mental or\nphysical disabilities, or who were born into an \u201cinferior\u201d race. Over six million people died in this Holocaust, one of the\ndarkest events in human history.

Stem-and-leaf\nplots are visual representations of entire datasets.\n\u2022 By manipulating the axes, changing widths of bars, or making bad choices for bins, we can create data\nvisualizations that misrepresent the distribution of data.\n8.3Mean, Median and Mode\n\u2022 The mode of a dataset is the value that appears the most frequently. The median is a value that is greater than or\nequal to no more than 50% of the data and less than or equal to no more than 50% of the data. The mean is the\nsum of all the data values, divided by the number of units in the dataset.\n\u2022 The median of a dataset is not affected by outliers, but the mean will be biased toward outliers. This distinction\nmight affect which measure of centrality is used to summarize a dataset.\n8.4Range and Standard Deviation\n\u2022 The range of a dataset is the difference between its largest and smallest values. The standard deviation is\napproximately the mean difference (in absolute value) that individual units fall from the mean of the dataset.\n8.5Percentiles\n\u2022 The percentile rank of a data value is the percentage of all values in the dataset that are less than or equal to the\ngiven value.\n8.6The Normal Distribution\n\u2022 Normally distributed data follow a bell-shaped, symmetrical distribution.\n\u2022 The mean of normally distributed data falls at the peak of the distribution. The standard deviation of normally-\ndistributed data is the distance from the peak to either of the inflection points.\n\u2022 Data that are normally distributed follow the 68-95-99.7 Rule, which says that approximately 68% of the data fall\nwithin one standard deviation of the mean, 95% fall within two standard deviations, and 99.7% fall within three\nstandard deviations.\n\u2022 The -score for a data value is the number of standard deviations that value falls above (or below, if the -score is\nnegative) the mean.\n\u2022 We can use the normal distribution to estimate percentiles.\n8.7Applications of the Normal Distribution\n\u2022 We can use -scores to compare data values from different datasets.\n8.8Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines\n\u2022 If one variable affects the value of another variable, we say the first is an explanatory variable and the second is a\nresponse variable.\n\u2022 Scatter plots place a point in the -plane for each unit in the dataset. The -value is the value of the explanatory\nvariable, and the -value is the value of the response variable.\n\u2022 The correlation coefficient gives us information about the strength and direction of the relationship between two\nvariables. If is positive, the relationship is positive: an increase in the value of the explanatory variable tends to\ncorrespond to anincreasein the value of the response variable. If is negative, the relationship is negative: an\nincrease in the value of the explanatory variable tends to correspond to adecreasein the value of the response\nvariable. Values of that are close to 0 indicate weak relationships, while values close to \u20131 or indicate strong 936 8 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nrelationships.\n\u2022 The regression line for a relationship between two variables is the line that best represents the data. It can be used\nto predict values of the response variable for a given value of the explanatory variable.\nVideos\n8.2Visualizing Data\n\u2022 Make a Simple Bar Graph in Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Bar-Graphs)\n\u2022 Create Pie Charts Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Pie-Charts)\n\u2022 Make a Histogram Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Histograms)\n\u2022 How to Spot a Misleading Graph(https://openstax.org/r/Misleading-Graphs)\n8.3Mean, Median and Mode\n\u2022 Compute Measures of Centrality Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Computing-Measures-of-Centrality)\n8.4Range and Standard Deviation\n\u2022 Find the Minimum and Maximum Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Finding-Minimum-and-Maximum)\n\u2022 Find the Standard Deviation Using Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Finding-Standard-Deviation)\n8.5Percentiles\n\u2022 Using RANK, PERCENTRANK, and PERCENTILE in Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Using-RANK-PERCENTRANK-\nand-PERCENTILE)\n8.8Scatter Plots, Correlation, and Regression Lines\n\u2022 Making Scatter Plots in Google Sheets(https://openstax.org/r/Scatter-Plots)\nFormula Review\n8.3Mean, Median and Mode\nSuppose we have a set of data with values, ordered from smallest to largest.

While\nin the United States, gasoline is sold in gallons and distances are measured in miles, but in almost any other country you\nwill find that gasoline is sold in liters and distance is measured in kilometers.\nWhether you\u2019re traveling, baking, watching an international sporting event, working with machine tools, or using\nscientific equipment, it's important to understand themetric system, or the International System of Units (SI). The\nmetric system is a decimal measuring system that uses meters, liters, and grams to quantify length, capacity, and mass.\nIt is used in all but three countries in the world, including the United States. 944 9 \u2022 Metric Measurement\n9.1 The Metric System\nFigure9.2A scale that measures weight in both metric and customary units. (credit: \u201cWeighing the homemade cheddar\u201d\nby Ruth Hartnup/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Identify units of measurement in the metric system and their uses.\n2. Order the six common prefixes of the metric system.\n3. Convert between like unit values.\nEven if you don\u2019t travel outside of the United States, many specialty grocery stores utilize the metric system. For\nexample, if you want to make authentic tamales you might visit the nearest Hispanic grocery store. While shopping, you\ndiscover that there are two brands of masa for the same price, but one bag is marked 1,200 g and the other 1 kg. Which\none is the better deal? Understanding the metric system allows you to understand that 1,200 grams is equivalent to 1.2\nkg, so the 1,200 g bag is the better deal.\nUnits of Measurement in the Metric System\nUnits of measurement provide common standards so that regardless of where or when an object or substance is\nmeasured, the results are consistent. When measuring distance, the units of measure might be feet,meters, or miles.\nWeight might be expressed in terms of pounds orgrams. Volume or capacity might be measured in gallons, orliters.\nUnderstanding how metric units of measure relate to each other is essential to understanding the metric system:\n\u2022 The metric unit for distance is the meter (m). A person\u2019s height might be written as 1.8 meters (1.8 m). A meter\nslightly longer than a yard (3 feet), while a centimeter is slightly less than half an inch.\n\u2022 The metric unit for area is thesquare meter(m2). The area of a professional soccer field is 7,140 square meters\n(7,140 m2).\n\u2022 The metric base unit for volume is thecubic meter(m3). However, the liter (L), which is a metric unit of capacity, is\nused to describe the volume of liquids. Soda is often sold in 2-liter (2 L) bottles.\n\u2022 The gram (g) is a metric unit of mass but is commonly used to express weight. The weight of a paper clip is\napproximately 1 gram (1 g).\n\u2022 The metric unit for temperature isdegrees Celsius(\u00b0C). The temperature on a warm summer day might be 24 \u00b0C.\nWhile the U.S. Customary System of Measurement uses ounces and pounds to distinguish between weight units of\ndifferent sizes, in the metric system abase unitis combined with a prefix, such askilo\u2013in kilogram, to identify the\nrelationship between smaller or larger units.\nWhen using abbreviations to represent metric measures, always separate the quantity and the units with a space,\nwith no spaces between the letters or symbols in the units. For example, 7 millimeters is written as 7 mm, not 7mm.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.1 \u2022 The Metric System 945\nTECH CHECK\nIt is important to be able to convert between the U.S. Customar System of Measurement and the metric system.\nHowever, in this chapter we\u2019ll focus on converting units within the metric system. Why? Typing \u201c200 centimeters in\ninches\u201d into any browser search bar will instantly convert those measures for you(Figure 9.3).You\u2019ll have an\nopportunity in theProjectsto work between measurement systems.\nFigure9.3(credit: Screenshot/Google)\nLet\u2019s be honest. Most of us use computers or smartphones to perform many of the calculations and conversions we\nwere taught in math class. But there is value in understanding the metric system since it exists all around us, and\nmost importantly, knowing how the different metric units relate to each other allows you to compare prices, find the\nright tool in a workshop, or acclimate when in another country. No matter the circumstance, you cannot avoid the\nmetric system.\nEXAMPLE9.1\nDetermining the Correct Base Unit\nWhich base unit would be used to express the following?\n1. amount of water in a swimming pool\n2. length of an electrical wire\n3. weight of one serving of peanuts\nSolution\n1. Liquid volume is generally expressed in units of liters (L).\n2. Length is measured in units of meters (m).\n3. Weight is commonly expressed in units of grams (g).\nYOUR TURN9.1\nDetermine the correct base measurement for each of the following.\n1. weight of a laptop\n2. width of a table\n3. amount of soda in a pitcher\nWhile there are other base units in the metric system, our discussions in this chapter will be limited to units used to\nexpress length, area, volume, weight, and temperature. 946 9 \u2022 Metric Measurement\nMetric Prefixes\nUnlike the U.S. Customary System of Measurement in which 12 inches is equal to 1 foot and 3 feet are equal to 1 yard,\nthe metric system is structured so that the units within the system get larger or smaller by a power of 10. For example, a\ncentimeter is , or 100 times smaller than a meter, while the kilometer is 103, or 1,000 times larger than a meter.\nThe metric system combines base units and unit prefixes reasonable to the size of a measured object or substance. The\nmost used prefixes are shown inTable 9.1. An easy way to remember the order of the prefixes, from largest to smallest,\nis the mnemonicKing Henry Died From Drinking Chocolate Milk.\nPrefix kilo\u2013 hecto\u2013 deca\u2013 base unit deci\u2013 cent\u2013 milli\u2013\nAbbreviation\nMagnitude\nTable9.1Metric Prefixes\nEXAMPLE9.2\nOrdering the Magnitude of Units\nOrder the measures from smallest unit to largest unit.\ncentimeter, millimeter, decimeter\nSolution\nLooking at the metric prefixes, we can see that the prefix order from smallest unit to largest unit is milli-, centi-, deci-, so\nthe order of the units from smallest to largest is millimeter, centimeter, decimeter.\nYOUR TURN9.2\n1. Order the measures from largest unit to smallest unit.\nhectogram, decagram, kilogram\nEXAMPLE9.3\nDetermining Reasonable Values for Length\nWhat is a reasonable value for the length of a person\u2019s thumb: 5 meters, 5 centimeters, or 5 millimeters?\nSolution\nGiven that a meter is slightly longer than a yard, 5 meters is not a reasonable value for the length of a person\u2019s thumb.\nSince a millimeter is 10 times smaller than a centimeter, which is approximately inch, 5 millimeters is not a reasonable\nestimate for the length of a person\u2019s thumb. The correct answer is 5 centimeters.\nYOUR TURN9.3\n1. What is a reasonable estimate for the length of a hallway: 2.5 kilometers, 2.5 meters, or 2.5 centimeters?\nConverting Metric Units of Measure\nImagine you order a textbook online and the shipping detail indicates the weight of the book is 1 kg. By attaching the\nletter \u201ck\u201d to the base unit of gram (g), the unit used to express the measure is or 1,000 times greater than a gram.\nOne kilogram is equivalent to 1,000 grams.\nThe tip of a highlighter measures approximately 1 cm.

One meter is equivalent to 100 centimeters.\nAconversion factoris used to convert from smaller metric units to bigger metric units and vice versa. It is a number\nthat when used with multiplication or division converts from one metric unit to another, both having the same base unit.\nIn the metric system, these conversion factors are directly related to the powers of 10. The most common used\nconversion factors are shown inFigure 9.4.\nFigure9.4Common Metric Conversion Factors for (a) Meters, (b) Liters, and (c) Grams\nEXAMPLE9.4\nConverting Metric Distances Using Multiplication\nThe firehouse is 13.45 km from the library. How many meters is it from the firehouse to the library?\nSolution\nWhen converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit, use multiplication. The conversion factor from kilometer to the\nbase unit of meters is 1,000.\nSo, the firehouse is 13,450 meters away from the firehouse.\nYOUR TURN9.4\n1. The record for the men\u2019s high jump is 2.45 m. What is the record when expressed in centimeters?\nEXAMPLE9.5\nConverting Metric Capacity Using Division\nHow many liters is 3,565 milliliters?\nSolution\nWhen converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit, use division. The conversion factor from milliliter to the base unit of\nliters is 1,000.\nSo, 3,565 milliliters is 3.565 liters. 948 9 \u2022 Metric Measurement\nYOUR TURN9.5\n1.

Due to miscommunication, Caroline took measurements in centigrams and\nAiyana used milligrams. Convert Caroline\u2019s measurement of 125 centigrams to milligrams.\nSolution\nWhen converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit, use multiplication. The conversion factor from centigrams to the\nmilligrams is 10.\nSo, the 125 centigrams are 1,250 milligrams.\nYOUR TURN9.6\n1. Convert Aiyana\u2019s measurement of 1,457 mg to centigrams.\nEXAMPLE9.7\nConverting Metric Units of Volume to Solve Problems\nA bottle contains 500 mL of juice. If the juice is packaged in 24-bottle cases, how many liters of juice does the case\ncontain?\nSolution\nStep 1:Multiply the amount of juice in each bottle by the number of bottles.\nStep 2:Divide by 1,000 to convert from milliliters to liters.\nSo, there are 12 liters of juice in each case.\nYOUR TURN9.7\n1.

Children and young adults probably watched educational cartoons about the\nmetric system on Saturday mornings.\nIn 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act and created a board of 17 people commissioned to\ncoordinate the voluntary switch to the metric system in the United States. Among those 17 people was Valerie\nAntoine, an engineer who made it her life\u2019s work to push for this change. Despite President Ronald Reagan dissolving\nthe board in 1982, effectively killing the move to the metric system at the time, Antoine continued the movement out\nof her own home as the executive director of the U.S. Metric Association. Reagan\u2019s decision followed intensive\nlobbying by American businesses whose factories used machinery designed to use customary measurements by\nworkers trained in customary measurements. There was also intense public pressure from American citizens who\ndidn\u2019t want to go through the time consuming and expensive process of changing the country\u2019s entire infrastructure.\nFueled by a Congressional mandate in 1992 that required all federal agencies make the switch to the metric system,\nAntoine never gave up hope that the metric system would trickle down from the government and find its way into\nAmerican schools, homes, and everyday life.\nVIDEO\nU.S. Office of Education: Metric Education(https://openstax.org/r/U.S._Office_Education)\nEXAMPLE9.8\nConverting Grams to Solve Problems\nThe nutrition label on a jar of spaghetti sauce indicates that one serving contains 410 mg of sodium.

Identify reasonable values for area applications.\n2. Convert units of measures of area.\n3. Solve application problems involving area.\nAreais the size of a surface. It could be a piece of land, a rug, a wall, or any other two-dimensional surface with\nattributes that can be measured in the metric unit for distance-meters. Determining the area of a surface is important to\nmany everyday activities. For example, when purchasing paint, you\u2019ll need to know how manysquare unitsof surface\narea need to be painted to determine how much paint to buy.\nSquare units indicate that two measures in the same units have been multiplied together. For example, to find the area\nof a rectangle, multiply the length units and the width units to determine the area in square units.\nNote that to accurately calculate area, each of the measures being multiplied must be of the same units. For example, to\nfind an area in square centimeters, both length measures (length and width) must be in centimeters.\nFORMULA\nThe formula used to determine area depends on the shape of that surface. Here we will limit our discussions to the\narea of rectangular-shaped objects like the one in Figure 9.6. Given this limitation, the basic formula for area is:\nFigure9.6Rectangle with Length and Width Labeled\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 Measuring Area 953\nReasonable Values for Area\nBecause area is determined by multiplying two lengths, the magnitude of difference between different square units is\nexponential. In other words, while a meter is 100 times greater in length than a centimeter, a square meter is\ntimes greater in area than a square centimeter . The relationships between benchmark\nmetric area units are shown in the following table.\nUnits Relationship Conversion Rate\nto\nto\nto\nAn essential understanding of metric area is to identify reasonable values for area. When testing for reasonableness you\nshould assess both the unit and the unit value. Only by examining both can you determine whether the given area is\nreasonable for the situation.\nEXAMPLE9.10\nDetermining Reasonable Units for Area\nWhich unit of measure is most reasonable to describe the area of a sheet of paper: , , or ?\nSolution\nIn the U.S. Customary System of Measurement, the length and width of paper is usually measured in inches. In the\nmetric system centimeters are used for measures usually expressed in inches. Thus, the most reasonable unit of\nmeasure to describe the area of a sheet of paper is square centimeters. Square kilometers is too large a unit and square\nmillimeters is too small a unit.\nYOUR TURN9.10\n1.

An\narea of 100 km2is equivalent to a surface of which is much too large for the walls of a bedroom.

After measuring the length and width of the field they determine\nthat the area of the football field is 5,350 km2. Does their calculation make sense? Explain your answer.\nSolution\nNo, kilometers are used to determine longer distances, such as the distance between two points when driving. A football\nfield is less than 1 kilometer long, so a more reasonable unit of value would be m2. An area of 5,350 km2can be\ncalculated using the dimensions 53.5 by 100, which are reasonable dimensions for the length and width of a football\nfield. So, a more reasonable value for the area of the football field is 5,350 m2.\nYOUR TURN9.12\n1. A crafter uses four letter-size sheets of paper to create a paper mosaic in the shape of a square.

Identify reasonable values for weight applications.\n2. Convert units of measures of weight.\n3. Solve application problems involving weight.\nIn the metric system, weight is expressed in terms of grams or kilograms, with a kilogram being equal to 1,000 grams. A\npaper clip weighs about 1 gram. A liter of water weighs about 1 kilogram. In fact, in the same way that 1 liter is equal in\nvolume to 1 cubic decimeter, the kilogram was originally defined as the mass of 1 liter of water. In some cases,\nparticularly in scientific or medical settings where small amounts of materials are used, the milligram is used to express\nweight. At the other end of the scale is the metric ton (mt), which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms. The average car\nweighs about 2 metric tons.\nAny discussion about metric weight must also include a conversation aboutmass. Scientifically, mass is the amount of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.4 \u2022 Measuring Weight 971\nmatter in an object whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. The amount of mass of an object\nremains constant no matter where the object is. Identical objects located on Earth and on the moon will have the same\nmass, but the weight of the objects will differ because the moon has a weaker gravitational force than Earth. So, objects\nwith the same mass will weigh less on the moon than on Earth.\nSince there is no easy way to measure mass, and since gravity is just about the same no matter where on Earth you go,\npeople in countries that use the metric system often use the words mass and weight interchangeably. While scientifically\nthe kilogram is only a unit of mass, in everyday life it is often used as a unit of weight as well.\nReasonable Values for Weight\nTo have an essential understanding of metric weight, you must be able to identify reasonable values for weight. When\ntesting for reasonableness, you should assess both the unit and the unit value. Only by examining both can you\ndetermine whether the given weight is reasonable for the situation.\nVIDEO\nMetric System: Units of Weight(https://openstax.org/r/Metric_System:_units_of_weight)\nEXAMPLE9.31\nIdentifying Reasonable Units for Weight\nWhich is the more reasonable value for the weight of a newborn baby:\n\u2022 3.5 kg or\n\u2022 3.5 g?\nSolution\nUsing our reference weights, a baby weighs more than 3.5 paperclips, so 3.5 kilograms is a more reasonable value for\nthe weight of a newborn baby.\nYOUR TURN9.31\n1.

So, a reasonable value for the weight of three lemons would\nbe 250 grams.\nYOUR TURN9.32\n1.

Identify reasonable values for temperature applications.\n3. Solve application problems involving temperature.\nWhen you touch something and it feels warm or cold, what is that really telling you about that substance?Temperature\nis a measure of how fast atoms and molecules are moving in a substance, whether that be the air, a stove top, or an ice\ncube. The faster those atoms and molecules move, the higher the temperature.\nIn the metric system, temperature is measured using the Celsius (\u00b0C) scale. Because temperature is a condition of the\nphysical properties of a substance, the Celsius scale was created with 100 degrees separating the point at which water\nfreezes, 0 \u00b0C, and the point at which water boils, 100 \u00b0C. Scientifically, these are the points at which water molecules\nchange from one state of matter to another\u2014from solid (ice) to liquid (water) to gas (water vapor).\nWhen reading temperatures, it\u2019s important to look beyond the degree symbol to determine which temperature scale\nthe units express. For example, 13 \u00b0C reads \u201c13 degrees Celsius,\u201d indicating that the temperature is expressed using\nthe Celsius scale, while 13 \u00b0F reads \u201c13 degrees Fahrenheit,\u201d indicating that the temperature is expressed using the 978 9 \u2022 Metric Measurement\nFahrenheit scale.\nVIDEO\nMisconceptions About Temperature(https://openstax.org/r/Misconceptions_About_Temperature)\nWHO KNEW?\nHow Many Temperature Scales Are There?\nDid you know that in addition to Fahrenheit and Celsius, there is a third temperature scale widely used throughout\nthe world? The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature at which there is no heat energy\npresent at all. It is primarily used by scientists to measure very high or very low temperatures when water is not\ninvolved.\nConverting Between Fahrenheit and Celsius Temperatures\nUnderstanding how to convert between Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures is an essential skill in understanding\nmetric temperatures. You likely know that below 32 \u00b0F means freezing temperatures and perhaps that the same holds\ntrue for 0 \u00b0C. While it may be difficult to recall that water boils at 212 \u00b0F, knowing that it boils at 100 \u00b0C is a fairly easy\nthing to remember.\nBut what about all the temperatures in between?

The\nsystem was first proposed in 1670 and has since been adopted as the International System of Units and used in\nnearly every country in the world.\n\u2022 Each successive unit on the metric scale is 10 times larger than the previous one. To convert between units with the\nsame base unit, you must either multiply or divide by a power of 10.\n\u2022 The most used prefixes are listed inTable 9.1. An easy way to remember the order of the prefixes, from largest to\nsmallest, is the mnemonicKing Henry Died from Drinking Chocolate Milk.\n9.2Measuring Area\n\u2022 Area describes the size of a two-dimensional surface. It is the amount of space contained within the lines of a two-\ndimensional space.\n\u2022 Area is measured in square meters units; in the metric system the base unit for area is square meters ( ).\n9.3Measuring Volume\n\u2022 Volume is a measure of the space contained within or occupied by three-dimensional objects.\n\u2022 Volume is measured in cubic units; the base unit for volume in the metric system is cubic meters (m3)\n\u2022 The liter (L) is a metric unit of capacity but is often used to express the volume of liquids. One liter is equivalent to\none cubic decimeter, which is the volume of a cube measuring .\n9.4Measuring Weight\n\u2022 Mass is the amount of matter in an object whereas weight is the force exerted on an object by gravity. The mass of\nan object never changes; the weight of an object changes depending on the force of gravity. An object with the\nsame mass would weigh less on the moon than on Earth because the moon\u2019s gravity is less than that of Earth.\n\u2022 In the metric system, weight and mass are often used interchangeably and are expressed in terms in grams or\nkilograms. 988 9 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n9.5Measuring Temperature\n\u2022 Temperature is a measure of how fast atoms and molecules are moving in a substance, whether that be the air, a\nstove top, or an ice cube. The faster those atoms and molecules move, the higher the temperature.\n\u2022 In the metric system, temperature is measured using the Celsius (\u00b0C) scale.\n\u2022 The Celsius scale was created with 100 degrees separating the point at which water freezes, 0 \u00b0C, and the point at\nwhich water boils, 100 \u00b0C. Scientifically, these are the points at which water molecules change from one state of\nmatter to another\u2014from solid (ice) to liquid (water) to gas (water vapor).\nVideos\n9.1The Metric System\n\u2022 U.S. Office of Education: Metric Education(https://openstax.org/r/U.S._Office_Education)\n\u2022 Neil deGrasse Tyson Explains the Metric System(https://openstax.org/r/Tyson_Explains_Metric_System)\n9.2Measuring Area\n\u2022 Converting Metric Units of Area(https://openstax.org/r/Metric_Units_of_Area)\n\u2022 Why the Metric System Matters(https://openstax.org/r/Metric_System_Matters)\n9.3Measuring Volume\n\u2022 How to Convert Cubic Centimeters to Cubic Meters(https://openstax.org/r/Convert_CC_to_CM)\n\u2022 Converting Metric Units of Volume(https://openstax.org/r/Converting_Metric_Units_of_Volume)\n9.4Measuring Weight\n\u2022 Metric System: Units of Weight(https://openstax.org/r/Metric_System:_units_of_weight)\n\u2022 Using Drones to Weigh Whales?(https://openstax.org/r/Using_drones_to_weigh_whales?)\n\u2022 Metric Units of Mass: Convert mg, g, and kg(https://openstax.org/r/Convert_mg-g-kg)\n9.5Measuring Temperature\n\u2022 Misconceptions About Temperature(https://openstax.org/r/Misconceptions_About_Temperature)\n\u2022 Temperature Conversion Trick(http://openstax.org/r/Temperature_Conversion_Trick)\n\u2022 Learn the Metric System in 5 Minutes(https://openstax.org/r/Metric_System_in_5_Minutes)\nFormula Review\n9.1The Metric System\nYou can convert between unit sizes with the same base unit using the conversion factors shown inFigure 9.4.\n9.2Measuring Area\nTo determine the area of rectangular-shaped objects:\nFigure9.16Rectangle with Length and Width Labeled\nYou can convert between metric area units using the conversion factors shown inFigure 9.7.\n9.3Measuring Volume\nTo determine the volume of a rectangular prism:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9 \u2022 Chapter Summary 989\nFigure9.17Rectangular Prism with Height , Length , and Width Labeled\nYou can convert between metric volume units and metric capacity units using the relationships shown inTable 9.2.\n9.4Measuring Weight\nYou can convert between metric weight units using the conversion factors shown inFigure 9.13.\n9.5Measuring Temperature\nTo convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius:\nTo convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\nTo estimate temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius:\nTo estimate temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:\nProjects\nCooking\n1.

Other scientists are also represented in the painting.\nTo the ancient Greeks, the study of mathematics meant the study of geometry above all other subjects. The Greeks\nlooked for the beauty in geometry and did not allow their geometrical constructions to be \u201cpolluted\u201d by the use of\nanything as practical as a ruler. They permitted the use of only two tools\u2014a compass for drawing circles and arcs, and an\nunmarked straightedge to draw line segments. They would mark off units as needed. However, they never could be sure\nof what the units meant. For instance, how long is an inch? These mathematicians defined many concepts.\nThe Greeks absorbed much from the Egyptians and the Babylonians (around 3000 BCE), including knowledge about\ncongruence and similarity, area and volume, angles and triangles, and made it their task to introduce proofs for\neverything they learned. All of this historical wisdom culminated with Euclid in 300 BCE.\nEuclid (325\u2013265 BC) is known as the father of geometry, and his most famous work is the 13-volume collection known as\nThe Elements, which are said to be \u201cthe most studied books apart from the Bible.\u201d Euclid brought together everything\noffered by the Babylonians, the Egyptians, and the more refined contributions by the Greeks, and set out, successfully, to\norganize and prove these concepts as he methodically developed formal theorems.\nThis chapter begins with a discussion of the most basic geometric tools: the point, the line, and the plane. All other\ntopics flow from there. Throughout the eight sections, we will talk about how to determine angle measurement and\nlearn how to recognize properties of special angles, such as right angles and supplementary angles. We will look at the\nrelationship of angles formed by a transversal, a line running through a set of parallel lines. We will explore the concepts\nof area and perimeter, surface area and volume, and transformational geometry as used in the patterns and rigid 994 10 \u2022 Geometry\nmotions of tessellations. Finally, we will introduce right-angle trigonometry and explore the Pythagorean Theorem.\n10.1 Points, Lines, and Planes\nFigure10.2The lower right-hand corner ofThe School of Athensdepicts a figure representing Euclid illustrating to\nstudents how to use a compass on a small chalkboard. (credit: modification of work \u201cSchool of Athens\u201d by Raphael\n(1483\u20131520), Vatican Museums/Wikimedia, Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Identify and describe points, lines, and planes.\n2. Express points and lines using proper notation.\n3. Determine union and intersection of sets.\nIn this section, we will begin our exploration of geometry by looking at the basic definitions as defined by Euclid. These\ndefinitions form the foundation of the geometric theories that are applied in everyday life.\nInThe Elements, Euclid summarized the geometric principles discovered earlier and created an axiomatic system, a\nsystem composed of postulates. Apostulateis another term for axiom, which is a statement that is accepted as truth\nwithout the need for proof or verification. There were no formal geometric definitions before Euclid, and when terms\ncould not be defined, they could be described. In order to write his postulates, Euclid had to describe the terms he\nneeded and he called the descriptions \u201cdefinitions.\u201d Ultimately, we will work with theorems, which are statements that\nhave been proved and can be proved.\nPoints and Lines\nThe first definition Euclid wrote was that of a point. He defined a point as \u201cthat which has no part.\u201d It was later expanded\nto \u201can indivisible location which has no width, length, or breadth.\u201d Here are the first two of the five postulates, as they are\napplicable to this first topic:\n1. Postulate 1: A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.\n2. Postulate 2: Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.\nBefore we go further, we will define some of the symbols used in geometry inFigure 10.3:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Points, Lines, and Planes 995\nFigure10.3Basic Geometric Symbols for Points and Lines\nFromFigure 10.3, we see the variations in lines, such as line segments, rays, or half-lines. What is consistent is that two\ncollinear points (points that lie on the same line) are required to form a line. Notice that a line segment is defined by its\ntwo endpoints showing that there is a definite beginning and end to a line segment. A ray is defined by two points on the\nline; the first point is where the ray begins, and the second point gives the line direction. A half-line is defined by two\npoints, one where the line starts and the other to give direction, but an open circle at the starting point indicates that the\nstarting point is not part of the half-line. A regular line is defined by any two points on the line and extends infinitely in\nboth directions. Regular lines are typically drawn with arrows on each end.\nEXAMPLE10.1\nDefining Lines\nFor the following exercises, use this line (Figure 10.4).\nFigure10.4\n1. Define .\n2. Define .\n3.

For example, airlines working out routes between cities,\nwhere each city\u2019s airport is a point, and the points are connected by line segments. Another example is a city map. Think\nabout the intersection of roads, such that the center of each intersection is a point, and the points are connected by line\nsegments representing the roads. SeeFigure 10.5.\nFigure10.5Air Line Routes\nEXAMPLE10.2\nDetermining the Best Route\nView the street map (Figure 10.6) as a series of line segments from point to point. For example, we have vertical line\nsegments , and on the right. On the left side of the map, we have vertical line segments , The\nhorizontal line segments are , , , , , and There are two diagonal line segments, and\nAssume that each location is on a corner and that you live next door to the library.\nFigure10.6Street Map\n1. Let\u2019s say that you want to stop at the grocery store on your way home from school. Come up with three routes you\nmight take to do your errand and then go home. In other words, name the three ways by the line segments in the\norder you would walk, and which way do you think would be the most efficient route?\n2.

Suppose you need to go to the post office and the dry cleaners on your way home from school. Name three ways\nyou might walk to do your errands and end up at home. Which way do you think is the most efficient way to walk,\nget your errands done, and go home?\nSolution\n1. From school to the grocery store and home: first way ; second way ;\nthird way . It seems that the third way is the most efficient way.\n2. From school to the library: first way ; second way ; third way ; fourth\nway . The first way should be the most efficient way.\n3.

Using the street map in Figure 10.6, find two ways you would stop at the dry cleaners and the grocery store after\nschool on your way home.\nParallel Lines\nParallel linesare lines that lie in the same plane and move in the same direction, but never intersect. To indicate that the\nline and the line are parallel we often use the symbol The distance between parallel lines remains\nconstant as the lines extend infinitely in both directions. SeeFigure 10.7.\nFigure10.7Parallel Lines\nPerpendicular Lines\nTwo lines that intersect at a angle areperpendicular linesand are symbolized by . If and are perpendicular,\nwe write When two lines form a right angle, a angle, we symbolize it with a little square SeeFigure 10.8.\nFigure10.8Perpendicular Lines\nEXAMPLE10.3\nIdentifying Parallel and Perpendicular Lines\nIdentify the sets of parallel and perpendicular lines inFigure 10.9. 998 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.9\nSolution\nDrawing these lines on a grid is the best way to distinguish which pairs of lines are parallel and which are perpendicular.\nBecause they are on a grid, we assume all lines are equally spaced across the grid horizontally and vertically. The grid\nalso tells us that the vertical lines are parallel and the horizontal lines are parallel. Additionally, all intersections form a\nangle. Therefore, we can safely say the following:\n, the line containing the points and is parallel to the line containing the points and .\n, the line containing the points and is parallel to the line containing the points and .\n, the line containing the points and is perpendicular to the line containing the points and . We know\nthis because both lines trace grid lines, and intersecting grid lines are perpendicular.\nWe can also state that ; the line containing the points and is perpendicular to the line containing the\npoints and because both lines trace grid lines, which are perpendicular by definition.\nWe also have ; the line containing the points and is perpendicular to the line containing the points and\nbecause both lines trace grid lines, which are perpendicular by definition.\nFinally, we see that ; the line containing the points and is perpendicular to the line containing the points\nand because both lines trace grid lines, which are perpendicular by definition.\nYOUR TURN10.3\n1.

So, it seems\nappropriate to introduce a mini-version of set theory here. First, asetis a collection of objects joined by some common\ncriteria. We usually name sets with capital letters. For example, the set of odd integers between 0 and 10 looks like this:\nWhen it involves sets of lines, line segments, or points, we are usually referring to theunionor\nintersectionof set.\nThe unionof two or more sets contains all the elements in either one of the sets or elements in all the sets referenced,\nand is written by placing this symbol in between each of the sets. For example, let set and let set\nThen, the union of sets A and B is\nThe intersectionof two or more sets contains only the elements that are common to each set, and we place this symbol\nin between each of the sets referenced.

We also identify a plane by three noncollinear points, or points\nthat do not lie on the same line. Think of a piece of paper, but one that has infinite length, infinite width, and no\nthickness. However, not all planes must extend infinitely. Sometimes a plane has a limited area.\nWe usually label planes with a single capital letter, such as Plane , as shown inFigure 10.16, or by all points that\ndetermine the edges of a plane. In the following figure, Plane contains points and , which are on the same line,\nand point , which is not on that line. By definition, is a plane. We can move laterally in any direction on a plane.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Points, Lines, and Planes 1001\nFigure10.16Plane\nOne way to think of a plane is the Cartesian coordinate system with the -axis marked off in horizontal units, and -axis\nmarked off in vertical units. In the Cartesian plane, we can identify the different types of lines as they are positioned in\nthe system, as well as their locations. SeeFigure 10.17.\nFigure10.17Cartesian Coordinate Plane\nThis plane contains points , , and . Points and are colinear and form a line segment. Point is not on that line\nsegment. Therefore, this represents a plane.\nTo give the location of a point on the Cartesian plane, remember that the first number in the ordered pair is the\nhorizontal move and the second number is the vertical move.

He was responsible\nfor shaping the development of Western thought perhaps more powerfully than anyone of his time. One of his\ngreatest achievements was the founding of the Academy in Athens where he emphasized the study of geometry.\nGeometry was considered by the Greeks to be the \u201cultimate human endeavor.\u201d Above the doorway to the Academy, an\ninscription read, \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter here.\u201d\nThe curriculum of the Academy was a 15-year program. The students studied the exact sciences for the first 10 years.\nPlato believed that this was the necessary foundation for preparing students\u2019 minds to study relationships that\nrequire abstract thinking. The next 5 years were devoted to the study of the \u201cdialectic.\u201d The dialectic is the art of\nquestion and answer. In Plato\u2019s view, this skill was critical to the investigation and demonstration of innate\nmathematical truths. By training young students how to prove propositions and test hypotheses, he created a culture\nin which the systematic process was guaranteed. The Academy was essentially the world\u2019s first university and held the\nreputation as the ultimate center of learning for more than 900 years.\nCheck Your Understanding\nUse the graph for the following exercises.\n1.

Identify and express angles using proper notation.\n2. Classify angles by their measurement.\n3. Solve application problems involving angles.\n4. Compute angles formed by transversals to parallel lines.\n5. Solve application problems involving angles formed by parallel lines.\nUnusual perspectives on architecture can reveal some extremely creative images. For example, aerial views of cities\nreveal some exciting and unexpected angles. Add reflections on glass or steel, lighting, and impressive textures, and the\nstructure is a work of art. Understanding angles is critical to many fields, including engineering, architecture,\nlandscaping, space planning, and so on. This is the topic of this section.\nWe begin our study of angles with a description of how angles are formed and how they are classified. An angle is the\njoining of two rays, which sweep out as the sides of the angle, with a common endpoint. The common endpoint is called\nthevertex. We will often need to refer to more than one vertex, so you will want to know the plural of vertex, which is\nvertices.\nInFigure 10.22, let the ray stay put. Rotate the second ray in a counterclockwise direction to the size of the angle\nyou want. The angle is formed by the amount of rotation of the second ray. When the ray continues to rotate in a\ncounterclockwise direction back to its original position coinciding with ray the ray will have swept out We call\nthe rays the \u201csides\u201d of the angle.\nFigure10.22Vertex and Sides of an Angle\nClassifying Angles\nAngles are measured inradiansordegrees.

A protractor is a very handy little tool, usually made of\ntransparent plastic, like the one shown here.\nFigure10.24Protractor (credit: modification of work \u201cSchool drawing tools\u201d by Marco Verch/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nWith a protractor, you line up the straight bottom with the horizontal straight line of the angle. Be sure to have the\ncenter hole lined up with the vertex of the angle. Then, look for the mark on the protractor where the second ray lines\nup. As you can see from the image, the degrees are marked off. Where the second ray lines up is the measurement of\nthe angle.\nMake sure you correctly match the center mark of the protractor with the vertex of the angle to be measured.\nOtherwise, you will not get the correct measurement. Also, keep the protractor in a vertical position.\nNotation\nNaming angles can be done in couple of ways. We can name the angle by three points, one point on each of the sides\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 Angles 1009\nand the vertex point in the middle, or we can name it by the vertex point alone. Also, we can use the symbols or\nbefore the points. When we are referring to the measure of the angle, we use the symbol .

Find the missing side of similar triangles.\nHow were the ancient Greeks able to calculate the radius of Earth? How did soldiers gauge their target? How was it\npossible centuries ago to estimate the height of a sail at sea? Triangles have always played a significant role in how we\nfind heights of objects too high to measure or distances between objects too far away to calculate. In particular, the\nconcept of similar triangles has countless applications in the real world, and we shall explore some of those applications\nin this section.\nTechnology has given us instruments that allow us to find measurements of distant objects with little effort. However, it\nis all based on the properties of triangles discovered centuries ago. In this section, we will explore the various types of\ntriangles and their special properties, as well as how to measure interior and exterior angles. We will also explore\ncongruence theorems and similarity.\nIdentifying Triangles\nJoining any three noncollinear points with line segments produces a triangle. For example, given points , , and ,\nconnected by the line segments and we have a triangle, as shown inFigure 10.43.\nFigure10.43Triangle\nTriangles are classified by their angles and their sides.

In other words, side is opposite angle , side\nis opposite angle , and side is opposite angle .\nFigure10.44Types of Triangles\nWe want to add a special note about right triangles here, as they are referred to more than any other triangle. The side\nopposite the right angle is its longest side and is called thehypotenuse, and the sides adjacent to the right angle are\ncalled the legs.\nOne of the most important properties of triangles is that the sum of the interior angles equals Euclid discovered\nand proved this property using parallel lines. The completed sketch is shown inFigure 10.45.\nFigure10.45Sum of Interior Angles\nThis is how the proof goes:\nStep 1:Start with a straight line and a point not on the line.\nStep 2:Draw a line through point parallel to the line .\nStep 3:Construct two transversals (a line crossing the parallel lines), one angled to the right and one angled to the left,\nto intersect the parallel lines.\nStep 4:Because of the property that alternate interior angles inside parallel lines are equal, we have that\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.3 \u2022 Triangles 1021\nStep 5:Notice that by the straight angle property.\nStep 6:Therefore, by substitution, and we have that\nTherefore, the sum of the interior angles of a\nEXAMPLE10.15\nFinding Measures of Angles Inside a Triangle\nFind the measure of each angle in the triangle shown (Figure 10.46).

The lengths of the sides of one triangle will be proportional to the corresponding sides of the second triangle.\nNote that a single fraction is called a ratio, but two fractions equal to each other is called a proportion, such as\nThis rule of similarity applies to all shapes as well as triangles. Another way to view similarity is by applying ascaling\nfactor, which is the ratio of corresponding measurements between an object or representation of the object, to an\nimage that produces the second, similar image.\nFor example, why are the two images inFigure 10.55are similar? These two images have the same proportions between\nelements. Therefore, they are similar.\nFigure10.55Similarity 1026 10 \u2022 Geometry\nEXAMPLE10.20\nDetermining If Triangles Are Similar\nAre the two triangles shown inFigure 10.56similar?\nFigure10.56\nSolution\nStep 1:We will look at the proportions within each triangle. In triangle (alpha), the side opposite the angle\nmeasures 7, and the side opposite the angle measures 4.

Thales\nis also known for devising a method for measuring the height of the pyramids by similar right triangles.Figure 10.60\nshows his method. He measured the length of the shadow cast by the pyramid at the precise time when his own\nshadow ended at the same place.\nFigure10.60Thales and Similarity\nHe equated the vertical height of the pyramid with his own height; the horizontal distance from the pyramid to the tip\nof its shadow with the distance from himself and the tip of his own shadow; and finally, the length of the shadow cast\noff the top of the pyramid with length of his own shadow cast off the top of his head. Using proportions, as shown in\nFigure 10.60, he essentially discovered the properties of similarity for right triangles. That is, is similar to\nNote that to be similar, all corresponding angles between the two triangles must be equal, and the\nproportions from one side to another side within each triangle, as well as the proportions of the corresponding sides\nbetween the two triangles must be equal.\nThales is also credited with discovering a method of determining the distance of a ship from the shoreline.

Solve application problems involving perimeter and circumference.\nIn our homes, on the road, everywhere we go, polygonal shapes are so common that we cannot count the many uses.\nTraffic signs, furniture, lighting, clocks, books, computers, phones, and so on, the list is endless. Many applications of\npolygonal shapes are for practical use, because the shapes chosen are the best for the purpose.\nModern geometric patterns in fabric design have become more popular with time, and they are used for the beauty they\nlend to the material, the window coverings, the dresses, or the upholstery. This art is not done for any practical reason,\nbut only for the interest these shapes can create, for the pure aesthetics of design.\nWhen designing fabrics, one has to consider the perimeter of the shapes, the triangles, the hexagons, and all polygons\nused in the pattern, including the circumference of any circular shapes. Additionally, it is the relationship of one object to\nanother and experimenting with different shapes, changing perimeters, or changing angle measurements that we find\nthe best overall design for the intended use of the fabric. In this section, we will explore these properties of polygons,\nthe perimeter, the calculation of interior and exterior angles of polygons, and the circumference of a circle.\nIdentifying Polygons\nApolygonis a closed, two-dimensional shape classified by the number of straight-line sides. SeeFigure 10.63for some\nexamples. We show only up to eight-sided polygons, but there are many, many more. 1036 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.63Types of Polygons\nIf all the sides of a polygon have equal lengths and all the angles are equal, they are calledregular polygons. However,\nany shape with sides that are line segments can classify as a polygon. For example, the first two shapes, shown inFigure\n10.64andFigure 10.64, are both pentagons because they each have five sides and five vertices. The third shapeFigure\n10.64is a hexagon because it has six sides and six vertices. We should note here that the hexagon inFigure 10.64is a\nconcave hexagon, as opposed to the first two shapes, which are convex pentagons. Technically, what makes a polygon\nconcave is having an interior angle that measures greater than . They are hollowed out, or cave in, so to speak.\nConvex refers to the opposite effect where the shape is rounded out or pushed out.\nFigure10.64Polygons\nWhile there are variations of all polygons, quadrilaterals contain an additional set of figures classified by angles and\nwhether there are one or more pairs of parallel sides.

A Greek scientist, inventor, philosopher, astronomer, physicist, and mathematician, Archimedes\nflourished in Syracuse, Sicily. He is credited with the invention of various types of pulley systems and screw pumps\nbased on the center of gravity. He advanced numerous mathematical concepts, including theorems for finding\nsurface area and volume. Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and developed the idea of the \u201cinfinitely small\u201d and\nthe method of exhaustion. The method of exhaustion is a technique for finding the area of a shape inscribed within a\nsequence of polygons. The areas of the polygons converge to the area of the inscribed shape. This technique evolved\nto the concept of limits, which we use today.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.4 \u2022 Polygons, Perimeter, and Circumference 1047\nOne of the more interesting achievements of Archimedes is the way he estimated the number pi, the ratio of the\ncircumference of a circle to its diameter. He was the first to find a valid approximation. He started with a circle having\na diameter of 1 inch. His method involved drawing a polygon inscribed inside this circle and a polygon circumscribed\naround this circle. He knew that the perimeter of the inscribed polygon was smaller than the circumference of the\ncircle, and the perimeter of the circumscribed polygon was larger than the circumference of the circle. This is shown\nin the drawing of an eight-sided polygon. He increased the number of sides of the polygon each time as he got closer\nto the real value of pi. The following table is an example of how he did this.\nSides Inscribed Perimeter Circumscribed Perimeter\n4 2.8284 4.00\n8 3.0615 3.3137\n16 3.1214 3.1826\n32 3.1365 3.1517\n64 3.1403 3.1441\nArchimedes settled on an approximation of after an iteration of 96 sides. Because pi is an irrational\nnumber, it cannot be written exactly. However, the capability of the supercomputer can compute pi to billions of\ndecimal digits. As of 2002, the most precise approximation of pi includes 1.2 trillion decimal digits.\nWHO KNEW?\nThe Platonic Solids\nThe Platonic solids (Figure 10.76) have been known since antiquity. A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object\nconstructed with congruent regular polygonal faces. Named for the philosopher, Plato believed that each one of the\nsolids is associated with one of the four elements: Fire is associated with the tetrahedron or pyramid, earth with the\ncube, air with the octahedron, and water with the icosahedron. Of the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, Plato\nsaid, \u201c\u2026 God used it for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven.\u201d 1048 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.76Platonic Solids\nPlato believed that the combination of these five polyhedra formed all matter in the universe. Later, Euclid proved that\nexactly five regular polyhedra exist and devoted the last book of theElementsto this theory. These ideas were\nresuscitated by Johannes Kepler about 2,000 years later. Kepler used the solids to explain the geometry of the\nuniverse.

(credit: \"Penrose Tiling\" by Inductiveload/Wikimedia\nCommons, Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Apply translations, rotations, and reflections.\n2. Determine if a shape tessellates.\nThe illustration shown above (Figure 10.77) is an unusual pattern called a Penrose tiling. Notice that there are two types\nof shapes used throughout the pattern: smaller green parallelograms and larger blue parallelograms. What's interesting\nabout this design is that although it uses only two shapes over and over, there is no repeating pattern.\nIn this section, we will focus on patterns that do repeat. Repeated patterns are found in architecture, fabric, floor tiles,\nwall patterns, rug patterns, and many unexpected places as well. It may be a simple hexagon-shaped floor tile, or a\ncomplex pattern composed of several different motifs. These two-dimensional designs are called regular (or periodic)\ntessellations. There are countless designs that may be classified as regular tessellations, and they all have one thing in\ncommon\u2014their patterns repeat and cover the plane.\nWe will explore how tessellations are created and experiment with making some of our own as well. The topic of\ntessellations belongs to a field in mathematics called transformational geometry, which is a study of the ways objects\ncan be moved while retaining the same shape and size. These movements are termedrigid motionsandsymmetries.\nWHO KNEW?\nM. C. Escher\nA good place to start the study of tessellations is with the work of M. C. Escher. The Dutch graphic artist was famous\nfor the dimensional illusions he created in his woodcuts and lithographs, and that theme is carried out in many of his\ntessellations as well. Escher became obsessed with the idea of the \u201cregular division of the plane.\u201d He sought ways to\ndivide the plane with shapes that would fit snugly next to each other with no gaps or overlaps, represent beautiful\npatterns, and could be repeated infinitely to fill the plane. He experimented with practically every geometric shape\nimaginable and found the ones that would produce a regular division of the plane. The idea is similar to dividing a\nnumber by one of its factors. When a number divides another number evenly, there are no remainders, like there are\nno gaps when a shape divides or fills the plane.\nEscher went far beyond geometric shapes, beyond triangles and polygons, beyond irregular polygons, and used\nother shapes like figures, faces, animals, fish, and practically any type of object to achieve his goal; and he did achieve\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Tessellations 1053\nit, beautifully, and left it for the ages to appreciate.\nVIDEO\nM.C. Escher: How to Create a Tessellation(https://openstax.org/r/create_tessellation)\nThe Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher(https://openstax.org/r/mathematical_art)\nTessellation Properties and Transformations\nA regular tessellation means that the pattern is made up of congruent regular polygons, same size and shape, including\nsome type of movement; that is, some type of transformation or symmetry. Here we consider the rigid motions of\ntranslations, rotations, reflections, or glide reflections. A plane of tessellations has the following properties:\n\u2022 Patterns are repeated and fill the plane.\n\u2022 There are no gaps or overlaps. Shapes must fit together perfectly. (It was Escher who determined that a proper\ntessellation could have no gaps and no overlaps.)\n\u2022 Shapes are combined using a transformation.\n\u2022 All the shapes are joined at a vertex. In other words, if you were to draw a circle around a vertex, it would include a\ncorner of each shape touching at that vertex.\n\u2022 For a tessellation of regular congruent polygons, the sum of the measures of the interior angles that meet at a\nvertex equals\nInFigure 10.78, the tessellation is made up of squares. There are four squares meeting at a vertex. An interior angle of a\nsquare is and the sum of four interior angles is InFigure 10.79, the tessellation is made up of regular\nhexagons. There are three hexagons meeting at each vertex. The interior angle of a hexagon is and the sum of\nthree interior angles is Both tessellations will fill the plane, there are no gaps, the sum of the interior angle\nmeeting at the vertex is and both are achieved by translation transformations. These tessellations work because all\nthe properties of a tessellation are present.\nFigure10.78Tessellation \u2013 Squares\nFigure10.79Tessellation \u2013 Hexagons\nThe movements or rigid motions of the shapes that define tessellations are classified as translations, rotations, 1054 10 \u2022 Geometry\nreflections, or glide reflections. Let\u2019s first define these movements and then look at some examples showing how these\ntransformations are revealed.\nTranslation\nAtranslationis a movement that shifts the shape vertically, horizontally, or on the diagonal. Consider the trapezoid\ninFigure 10.80. We have translated it 3 units to the right and 3 units up. That means every corner is moved by\nthe number of units and in the direction specified. Mathematicians will indicate this movement with a vector, an arrow\nthat is drawn to illustrate the criteria and the magnitude of the translation. The location of the translated trapezoid is\nmarked with the vertices, but it is still the exact same shape and size as the original trapezoid .\nFigure10.80Translation\nEXAMPLE10.34\nCreating a Translation\nSuppose you have a hexagon on a grid as inFigure 10.81. Translate the hexagon 5 units to the right and 3 units up.\nFigure10.81\nSolution\nThe best way to do this is by translating the individual points . Once translated, the points become\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Tessellations 1055\nFigure10.82\nYOUR TURN10.34\n1. Translate the hexagon with points 6 units down.\nRotation\nThe rotation transformation occurs when you rotate a shape about a point and at a predetermined angle. InFigure\n10.83, the triangle is rotated around the rotation point by and then translated 7 units up and 4 units over to the\nright. That means that each corner is translated to the new location by the same number of units and in the same\ndirection. 1056 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.83Rotation\nWe can see that is mapped to by a rotation of up and to the right. If rotated again by , the triangle would\nbe upside down.\nEXAMPLE10.35\nApplying a Rotation\nFigure 10.84illustrates a tessellation begun with an equilateral triangle. Explain how this pattern is produced.\nFigure10.84\nSolution\nA rotation to the right or to the left around the vertex by six times, produces the hexagonal shape. The sixth rotation\nbrings the triangle back to its original position. Then, a reflection up and another one on the diagonal will reproduce the\npattern. When a shape returns to its original position by a rotation, we say that it has rotational symmetry.\nYOUR TURN10.35\n1. Starting with the triangle in the figure shown, explain how the pattern on the right was achieved.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Tessellations 1057\nReflection\nAreflectionis the third transformation. A shape is reflected about a line and the new shape becomes a mirror image.\nYou can reflect the shape vertically, horizontally, or on the diagonal. There are two shapes inFigure 10.85. The\nquadrilateral is reflected horizontally; the arrow shape is reflected vertically.\nFigure10.85Reflection\nGlide Reflection\nTheglide reflectionis the fourth transformation. It is a combination of a reflection and a translation. This can occur by\nfirst reflecting the shape and then gliding or translating it to its new location, or by translating first and then reflecting.\nThe example inFigure 10.86shows a trapezoid, which is reflected over the dashed line, so it appears upside down. Then,\nwe shifted the shape horizontally by 6 units to the right. Whether we use the glide first or the reflection first, the end\nresult is the same in most cases. However, the tessellation shown in the next example can only be achieved by a\nreflection first and then a translation. 1058 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.86Glide Reflection\nEXAMPLE10.36\nApplying the Glide Reflection\nAn obtuse triangle is reflected about the dashed line, and the two shapes are joined together. How does the tessellation\nshown inFigure 10.87materialize?\nFigure10.87\nSolution\nThe new shape is reflected horizontally and joined with the original shape. It is then translated vertically and horizontally\nto make up the tessellation. Notice the blank spaces next to the vertical pattern. These areas are made up of the exact\noriginal shape rotated but with no line up the center. These rotated shapes are translated horizontally and\nvertically, and thus, the plane is tessellated with no gaps. This is an example of a glide reflection where the order of the\ntransformations matters.\nYOUR TURN10.36\n1. Explain how this tessellation of equilateral triangles could be produced.\nEXAMPLE10.37\nApplying More Than One Tessellation\nShow how this tessellation (Figure 10.88) can be achieved.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Tessellations 1059\nFigure10.88\nSolution\nThis is a tessellation that has one color on the front of the trapezoid and a different color on the back. There is a\ntranslation on the diagonal, and a reflection vertically. These are two separate transformations resulting in two new\nplacements of the trapezoid. We can call this a combination of two transformations or a glide reflection.\nYOUR TURN10.37\n1. How does this tessellation of the squares come about?\nInterior Angles\nThe sum of the interior angles of a tessellation is . InFigure 10.89, the tessellation is made of six triangles formed\ninto the shape of a hexagon. Each angle inside a triangle equals , and the six vertices meet the sum of those interior\nangles, . 1060 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.89Interior Angles at the Vertex of Triangles\nInFigure 10.90, the tessellation is made up of trapezoids, such that two of the interior angles of each trapezoid equals\nand the other two angles equal . Thus, the sum of the interior angles where the vertices of four trapezoids meet\nequals .\nFigure10.90Interior Angles at the Vertex of Trapezoids\nThese tessellations illustrate the property that the shapes meet at a vertex where the interior angles sum to .\nTessellating Shapes\nWe might think that all regular polygons will tessellate the plane by themselves. We have seen that squares do and\nhexagons do. The pattern of squares inFigure 10.91is a translation of the shape horizontally and vertically. The\nhexagonal pattern inFigure 10.92, is translated horizontally, and then on the diagonal, either to the right or to the left.\nThis particular pattern can also be formed by rotations. Both tessellations are made up of congruent shapes and each\nshape fits in perfectly as the pattern repeats.\nFigure10.91Translation Horizontally and Vertically\nFigure10.92Translation Horizontally and Slide Diagonally\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Tessellations 1061\nWe have also seen that equilateral triangles will tessellate the plane without gaps or overlaps, as shown inFigure 10.93.\nThe pattern is made by a reflection and a translation. The darker side is the face of the triangle and the lighter side is the\nback of the triangle, shown by the reflection. Each triangle is reflected and then translated on the diagonal.\nFigure10.93Reflection and Glide Translation\nEscher experimented with all regular polygons and found that only the ones mentioned, the equilateral triangle, the\nsquare, and the hexagon, will tessellate the plane by themselves. Let\u2019s try a few other regular polygons to observe what\nEscher found.\nEXAMPLE10.38\nTessellating the Plane\nDo regular pentagons tessellate the plane by themselves (Figure 10.94)?\nFigure10.94\nSolution\nWe can see that regular pentagons do not tessellate the plane by themselves. There is a gap, a gap in the shape of a\nparallelogram. We conclude that regular pentagons will not tessellate the plane by themselves.\nYOUR TURN10.38\n1. Do regular heptagons tessellate the plane by themselves?\nEXAMPLE10.39\nTessellating Octagons\nDo regular octagons tessellate the plane by themselves (Figure 10.95)? 1062 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.95\nSolution\nAgain, we see that regular octagons do not tessellate the plane by themselves. The gaps, however, are squares. So, two\nregular polygons, an octagon and a square, do tessellate the plane.\nYOUR TURN10.39\n1. Do regular dodecagons (12-sided regular polygons) tessellate the plane by themselves?\nJust because regular pentagons do not tessellate the plane by themselves does not mean that there are no pentagons\nthat tessellate the plane, as we see inFigure 10.96.\nFigure10.96Tessellation of Pentagons\nAnother example of an irregular polygon that tessellates the plane is by using the obtuse irregular triangle from a\nprevious example.

The parallelogram is then translated on the diagonal and to the right and to the left.\nNaming\nA tessellation of squares is named by choosing a vertex and then counting the number of sides of each shape touching\nthe vertex. Each square in the tessellation shown inFigure 10.98has four sides, so starting with square , the first\nnumber is 4, moving around counterclockwise to the next square meeting the vertex, square , we have another 4,\nsquare adds another 4, and finally square adds a fourth 4. So, we would name this tessellation a 4.4.4.4.\nThe hexagon tessellation, shown inFigure 10.99has six sides to the shape and three hexagons meet at the vertex. Thus,\nwe would name this a 6.6.6. The triangle tessellation, shown inFigure 10.100has six triangles meeting the vertex. Each\ntriangle has three sides. Thus, we name this a 3.3.3.3.3.3.\nFigure10.984.4.4.4\nFigure10.996.6.6\nFigure10.1003.3.3.3.3.3\nEXAMPLE10.40\nCreating Your Own Tessellation\nCreate a tessellation using two colors and two shapes. 1064 10 \u2022 Geometry\nSolution\nWe used a parallelogram and an isosceles triangle.

As the context changes, so does the value.\nArea refers to a region measured in square units, like a square mile or a square foot. For example, to purchase tile for a\nkitchen floor, you would need to know how many square feet are needed because tile is sold by the square foot.\nCarpeting is sold by the square yard. As opposed to linear measurements like perimeter, which in in linear units. For\nexample, fencing is sold in linear units, a linear foot or yard. Linear dimensions refer to an outline or a boundary. Square\nunits refer to the area within that boundary. Different items may have different units, but either way, you must know the\nlinear dimensions to calculate the area.\nMany geometric shapes have formulas for calculating areas, such as triangles, regular polygons, and circles. To calculate\nareas for many irregular curves or shapes, we need calculus. However, in this section, we will only look at geometric\nshapes that have known area formulas. The notation for area, as mentioned, is in square units and we write sq in or sq\ncm, or use an exponent, such as or Note that linear measurements have no exponent above the units or we can\nsay that the exponent is 1.\nArea of Triangles\nThe formula for the area of a triangle is given as follows.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.6 \u2022 Area 1069\nFORMULA\nThe area of a triangle is given as where represents the base and represents the height.\nFor example, consider the triangle inFigure 10.103.\nFigure10.103Triangle 1\nThe base measures 4 cm and the height measures 5 cm. Using the formula, we can calculate the area:\nInFigure 10.104, the triangle has a base equal to 7 cm and a height equal to 3.5 cm. Notice that we can only find the\nheight by dropping a perpendicular to the base. The area is then\nFigure10.104Triangle 2\nEXAMPLE10.41\nFinding the Area of a Triangle\nFind the area of this triangle that has a base of 4 cm and the height is 6 cm (Figure 10.105).\nFigure10.105\nSolution\nUsing the formula, we have 1070 10 \u2022 Geometry\nYOUR TURN10.41\n1.

Some quadrilaterals have either one or two sets of parallel\nsides. The set of quadrilaterals include the square, the rectangle, the parallelogram, the trapezoid, and the rhombus. The\nmost common quadrilaterals are the square and the rectangle.\nSquare\nInFigure 10.106, a grid is represented with twelve squares across each row, and twelve\nsquares down each column. If you count the little squares, the sum equals 144 squares. Of course, you do not\nhave to count little squares to find area\u2014we have a formula.

Suppose you are remodeling your home\nand you want to replace all the flooring. You need to know how to calculate the area of the floor to purchase the correct\namount of tile, or hardwood, or carpet. If you want to paint the rooms, you need to calculate the area of the walls and\nthe ceiling to know how much paint to buy, and the list goes on. Can you think of other situations where you might need\nto calculate area?\nEXAMPLE10.42\nFinding the Area of a Rectangle\nYou have a garden with an area of 196 square feet.

Notice inFigure 10.108, if we cut a\ndiagonal across the parallelogram from one vertex to the opposite vertex, we have two triangles. If we multiply the area 1072 10 \u2022 Geometry\nof a triangle by 2, we have the area of a parallelogram:\nFigure10.108Area of a Parallelogram\nFORMULA\nThe area of a parallelogram is\nFor example, if we have a parallelogram with the base be equal to 10 inches and the height equal to 5 inches, the area\nwill be\nEXAMPLE10.44\nFinding the Area of a Parallelogram\nIn the parallelogram (Figure 10.109), if find the exact area of the parallelogram.\nFigure10.109\nSolution\nUsing the formula of we have\nYOUR TURN10.44\n1.

First, the apothem of a regular\npolygon is a line segment that starts at the center and is perpendicular to a side.

For example, suppose\nyou are purchasing new carpet for a room measured in feet, but carpeting is sold in terms of yards. You will have to\nconvert feet to yards to purchase the correct amount of carpeting. Or, you may need to convert centimeters to inches, or\nfeet to meters.

Calculate the surface area of right prisms and cylinders.\n2. Calculate the volume of right prisms and cylinders.\n3. Solve application problems involving surface area and volume.\nVolume and surface area are two measurements that are part of our daily lives. We use volume every day, even though\nwe do not focus on it. When you purchase groceries, volume is the key to pricing. Judging how much paint to buy or how\nmany square feet of siding to purchase is based on surface area. The list goes on. An example is a three-dimensional\nrendering of a floor plan. These types of drawings make building layouts far easier to understand for the client. It allows\nthe viewer a realistic idea of the product at completion; you can see the natural space, the volume of the rooms. This\nsection gives you practical information you will use consistently. You may not remember every formula, but you will\nremember the concepts, and you will know where to go should you want to calculate volume or surface area in the\nfuture.\nWe will concentrate on a few particular types of three-dimensional objects: right prisms and right cylinders. The adjective\n\u201cright\u201d refers to objects such that the sides form a right angle with the base. We will look at right rectangular prisms, 1088 10 \u2022 Geometry\nright triangular prisms, right hexagonal prisms, right octagonal prisms, and right cylinders. Although, the principles\nlearned here apply to all right prisms.\nThree-Dimensional Objects\nIn geometry, three-dimensional objects are calledgeometric solids. Surface area refers to the flat surfaces that\nsurround the solid and is measured in square units. Volume refers to the space inside the solid and is measured in cubic\nunits. Imagine that you have a square flat surface with width and length. Adding the third dimension adds depth or\nheight, depending on your viewpoint, and now you have a box. One way to view this concept is in the Cartesian\ncoordinate three-dimensional space. The -axis and the -axis are, as you would expect, two dimensions and suitable for\nplotting two-dimensional graphs and shapes. Adding the -axis, which shoots through the origin perpendicular to the\n-plane, and we have a third dimension. SeeFigure 10.124.\nFigure10.124Three-Dimensional Space\nHere is another view taking the two-dimensional square to a third dimension. SeeFigure 10.125.\nFigure10.125Going from Two Dimensions to Three Dimensions\nTo study objects in three dimensions, we need to consider the formulas for surface area and volume. For example,\nsuppose you have a box (Figure 10.126) with a hinged lid that you want to use for keeping photos, and you want to cover\nthe box with a decorative paper. You would need to find the surface area to calculate how much paper is needed.\nSuppose you need to know how much water will fill your swimming pool. In that case, you would need to calculate the\nvolume of the pool. These are just a couple of examples of why these concepts should be understood, and familiarity\nwith the formulas will allow you to make use of these ideas as related to right prisms and right cylinders.\nFigure10.126\nRight Prisms\nAright prismis a particular type of three-dimensional object. It has a polygon-shaped base and a congruent, regular\npolygon-shaped top, which are connected by the height of its lateral sides, as shown inFigure 10.127.

Calculate the surface area of a greenhouse with a flat roof measuring 12 ft wide, 25 ft long, and 8 ft high.\nRight Cylinders\nThere are similarities between a prism and a cylinder. While a prism has parallel congruent polygons as the top and the\nbase, aright cylinderis a three-dimensional object with congruent circles as the top and the base. The lateral sides of a\nright prism make a angle with the polygonal base, and the side of a cylinder, which unwraps as a rectangle, makes a\nangle with the circular base.\nRight cylinders are very common in everyday life. Think about soup cans, juice cans, soft drink cans, pipes, air hoses, and\nthe list goes on.\nInFigure 10.133, imagine that the cylinder is cut down the 12-inch side and rolled out. We can see that the cylinder side\nwhen flat forms a rectangle. The formula includes the area of the circular base, the circular top, and the area of the\nrectangular side. The length of the rectangular side is the circumference of the circular base. Thus, we have the formula\nfor total surface area of a right cylinder.\nFigure10.133Right Cylinder\nFORMULA\nThe surface area of a right cylinder is given as\nTo find the volume of the cylinder, we multiply the area of the base with the height.\nFORMULA\nThe volume of a right cylinder is given as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.7 \u2022 Volume and Surface Area 1093\nEXAMPLE10.60\nFinding the Surface Area and Volume of a Cylinder\nGiven the cylinder inFigure 10.133, which has a radius of 5 inches and a height of 12 inches, find the surface area and\nthe volume.\nSolution\nStep 1:We begin with the areas of the base and the top.

However, many geometric applications can be solved with the\ntools learned in this section. Suppose you want to make some throw pillows for your sofa, but you have a limited amount\nof fabric. You want to make the largest pillows you can from the fabric you have, so you would need to figure out the\ndimensions of the pillows that will fit these criteria.

You have a limited amount of fencing available, but you would like the garden to be as large as\npossible. How would you determine the shape and size of the garden?

Apply trigonometric ratios to find missing parts of a right triangle.\n4.

However, there is evidence that the theorem was known as early as 1900\u20131100 BC by the\nBabylonians. The Pythagorean Theorem is a formula used for finding the lengths of the sides of right triangles.\nBorn in Greece, Pythagoras lived from 569\u2013500 BC. He initiated a cult-like group called the Pythagoreans, which was a\nsecret society composed of mathematicians, philosophers, and musicians. Pythagoras believed that everything in the\nworld could be explained through numbers. Besides the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras and his followers are\ncredited with the discovery of irrational numbers, the musical scale, the relationship between music and mathematics,\nand many other concepts that left an immeasurable influence on future mathematicians and scientists.\nThe focus of this section is on right triangles. We will look at how thePythagorean Theoremis used to find the\nunknown sides of a right triangle, and we will also study thespecialtriangles, those with set ratios between the lengths\nof sides. By ratios we mean the relationship of one side to another side. When you think about ratios, you should think\nabout fractions. A fraction is a ratio, the ratio of the numerator to the denominator. Finally, we will preview trigonometry.\nWe will learn about the basic trigonometric functions, sine, cosine and tangent, and how they are used to find not only\nunknown sides but unknown angles, as well, with little information.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.8 \u2022 Right Triangle Trigonometry 1099\nPythagorean Theorem\nThe Pythagorean Theorem is used to find unknown sides of right triangles. The theorem states that the sum of the\nsquares of the two legs of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side of the right triangle).\nFORMULA\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states\nwhere and are two sides (legs) of a right triangle and is the hypotenuse, as shown inFigure 10.138.\nFigure10.138Pythagorean Right Triangle\nFor example, given that side and side we can find the measure of side using the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus,\nEXAMPLE10.64\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem\nFind the length of the missing side of the triangle (Figure 10.139).\nFigure10.139\nSolution\nUsing thePythagorean Theorem, we have 1100 10 \u2022 Geometry\nWhen we take the square root of a number, the answer is usually both the positive and negative root.

Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the missing side of the right triangle shown.\nDistance\nThe applications of the Pythagorean Theorem are countless, but one especially useful application is that of distance. In\nfact, the distance formula stems directly from the theorem. It works like this:\nInFigure 10.140, the problem is to find the distance between the points and We call the length from\npoint to point side , and the length from point to point side . To find side , we use the\ndistance formula and we will explain it relative to the Pythagorean Theorem. The distance formula is\nsuch that is a substitute for in the Pythagorean Theorem and is equal to\nand is a substitute for in the Pythagorean Theorem and is equal to When we\nplug in these numbers to the distance formula, we have\nThus, , the hypotenuse, in the Pythagorean Theorem.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.8 \u2022 Right Triangle Trigonometry 1101\nFigure10.140Distance\nEXAMPLE10.65\nCalculating Distance Using the Distance Formula\nYou live on the corner of First Street and Maple Avenue, and work at Star Enterprises on Tenth Street and Elm Drive\n(Figure 10.141).

Every vertical rise of 1 in requires that the horizontal length be\n12 inches. You are constructing a ramp at your business. The plan is to make the ramp 130 inches in horizontal length\nand the slanted distance will measure approximately 132.4 inches (Figure 10.142). What should the vertical height be?\nFigure10.142\nSolution\nThe Pythagorean Theorem states that the horizontal length of the base of the ramp, sidea, is 130 in. The length ofc, or\nthe length of the hypotenuse, is 132.4 in. The length of the height of the triangle is sideb.\nThen, by thePythagorean Theorem, we have:\nIf you construct the ramp with a 25 in vertical rise, will it fulfill the building code? If not, what will have to change?\nThe building code states 12 in of horizontal length for each 1 in of vertical rise. The vertical rise is 25 in, which means\nthat the horizontal length has to be So, no, this will not pass the code. If you must keep the vertical rise\nat 25 in, what will the other dimensions have to be? Since we need a minimum of 300 in for the horizontal length:\nThe new ramp will look likeFigure 10.143.\nFigure10.143\nYOUR TURN10.66\n1.

However, it was Pythagoras who found countless applications of the theorem\nleading to advances in geometry, architecture, astronomy, and engineering.\nAmong his accolades, Pythagoras founded a school for the study of mathematics and music. Students were called the\nPythagoreans, and the school\u2019s teachings could be classified as a religious indoctrination just as much as an academic\nexperience. Pythagoras believed that spirituality and science coexist, that the intellectual mind is superior to the\nsenses, and that intuition should be honored over observation.\nPythagoras was convinced that the universe could be defined by numbers, and that the natural world was based on\nmathematics. His primary belief wasAll is Number.He even attributed certain qualities to certain numbers, such as\nthe number 8 represented justice and the number 7 represented wisdom. There was a quasi-mythology that\nsurrounded Pythagoras. His followers thought that he was more of a spiritual being, a sort of mystic that was all-\nknowing and could travel through time and space. Some believed that Pythagoras had mystical powers, although\nthese beliefs were never substantiated.\nPythagoras and his followers contributed more ideas to the field of mathematics, music, and astronomy besides the\nPythagorean Theorem. The Pythagoreans are credited with the discovery of irrational numbers and of proving that\nthe morning star was the planet Venus and not a star at all. They are also credited with the discovery of the musical\nscale and that different strings made different sounds based on their length. Some other concepts attributed to the\nPythagoreans include the properties relating to triangles other than the right triangle, one of which is that the sum of\nthe interior angles of a triangle equals These geometric principles, proposed by the Pythagoreans, were proven\n200 years later by Euclid.\nWHO KNEW?\nA Visualization of the Pythagorean Theorem\nInFigure 10.157, which is one of the more popular visualizations of the Pythagorean Theorem, we see that square is\nattached to side ; square is attached to side ; and the largest square, square , is attached to side . Side\nmeasures 3 cm in length, side measures 4 cm in length, and side measures 5 cm in length. By definition, the area\nof square measures 9 square units, the area of square measures 16 square units, and the area of square\nmeasures 25 square units. Substitute the values given for the areas of the three squares into the Pythagorean\nTheorem and we have\nThus, the sum of the squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse, as stated in\nthe Pythagorean Theorem. 1114 10 \u2022 Geometry\nFigure10.157\nCheck Your Understanding\n48.

Maybe you would tell your friend\nthat the last time you voted was during the last presidential election, or perhaps you would tell your friend that you\nprefer not to vote. When thinking about voting, presidential campaigns or advertisements for reelections may come to\nmind, but you can cast your vote in many ways. Have you liked a post, followed a creator, friended a stranger, or clicked a\nheart online today? In the digital age, it's possible to vote several times a day. Voting systems are not only the machines\nthat drive every democracy on Earth, but they are also the engines driving social media and many other aspects of life. A\ndeeper understanding of these voting systems will enhance your ability to successfully engage with the world in which\nwe live.\nIn this chapter, you will become one of the founders of the new democratic country of Imaginaria. You have a great\nresponsibility to the people of this fledgling democracy. You have been tasked with writing the portion of the\nconstitution that lays out voting procedures. In preparation for this important task, you will explore the various types of\nvoting systems, from school board elections to Twitter wars. You will see how these types are alike, how they differ, and\nhow they might be applied in Imaginaria. Most importantly, you will learn about the mathematically inherent advantages\nand disadvantages of various voting systems so that you can make informed choices to better the lives of the\nImaginarians. 1130 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\n11.1 Voting Methods\nFigure11.2President Barack Obama votes in the 2012 election. (credit: Pete Souza/White House, Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Apply plurality voting to determine a winner.\n2. Apply runoff voting to determine a winner.\n3. Apply ranked-choice voting to determine a winner.\n4. Apply Borda count voting to determine a winner.\n5. Apply pairwise comparison and Condorcet voting to determine a winner.\n6. Apply approval voting to determine a winner.\n7. Compare and contrast voting methods to identify flaws.\nToday is the day that you begin your quest to collaborate on the constitution of Imaginaria! Let\u2019s begin by thinking about\nthe selection of a leader who can serve as president. It seems straightforward; if the majority of citizens prefer a\nparticular candidate, that candidate should win. But not all votes are decided by a simple majority. Why not? What are\nthe options?\nMajority versus Plurality Voting\nWhen an election involves only two options, a simplemajorityis a reasonable way to determine a winner. A majority is a\nnumber equaling more than half, or greater than 50 percent of the total.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the outcomes of U.S. presidential elections to understand more.Table 11.1displays the results of the\n2000 U.S. presidential election. Like most presidential elections, this election involved more than two options. If that is\nthe case, is it possible that no single candidate will receive more than half of the votes cast?\nCandidate (Party Label) Popular Vote Total\nAl Gore (Democrat) 50,999,897\nGeorge W. Bush (Republican) 50,456,002\nRalph Nader (Green) 2,882,955\nPatrick J.

Did any single candidate secure the majority of popular votes?\nSolution\nStep 1:Calculate 50 percent of 105,405,100 by multiplying the decimal form of 50 percent, which is 0.50, by 158,394,605:\nStep 2:Determine the minimum number of votes needed to have a majority. The minimum number of votes required is\nthe lowest counting number that is larger than 50 percent of the votes. To have a majority, an individual candidate must\nhave more than 52,702,550; so, a majority candidate must have 52,702,551 votes or more.\nStep 3:Compare the number of votes each candidate received to 52,702,551. According to the data inTable 11.1, none\nof the candidates secured a majority.\nYOUR TURN11.1\n1. According to the Cook Political Report, a total of 158,394,605 votes were cast in the 2020 U.S. presidential\nelection. Of those, 81,281,502 were cast for Joe Biden, 74,222,593 for Donald Trump, and 2,890,510 for other\ncandidates. Although U.S. presidential elections are not determined by popular vote, did either Joe Biden or\nDonald Trump secure a majority of the votes?\nUnlike in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, a candidate won the majority of votes in the 2020 election (seeTable 11.1). It\nis a common occurrence for no single candidate to receive a majority of the votes in an election with more than two\ncandidates. When this occurs, the candidate with the largest portion of the votes is said to have aplurality.\nEXAMPLE11.2\nPlurality of Popular Vote in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election\nRefer again toTable 11.1. In the 2000 U.S. presidential election, which candidate had a plurality of popular votes?\nSolution\nAl Gore secured 50,999,897 votes which was more than any other single candidate. Therefore, he had a plurality of the\npopular votes.\nYour plans for Imaginarian elections will likely include primary elections, or preliminary elections to select candidates for\na principal or general election.Table 11.2displays the results of the 2018 U.S. Senate Republican primary for Maryland. 1132 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nTop Four Republican Candidates Votes Percentage of Party Votes\nCambell, Tony 51,426 29.22%\nChaffee, Chris 42,328 24.05%\nGrigorian, Christina J. 30,756 17.48%\nGraziani, John R. 15,435 8.77%\nTotal Votes 175,981 100%\nTable11.2(source: https://ballotpedia.org/\nUnited_States_Senate_election_in_Maryland_(June_26,_2018_Republican_primary))\nYOUR TURN11.2\n1.

Did the candidate win a majority or a plurality of Republican votes?\nConsider how election by plurality, not majority, is the most common method of selecting candidates for public office.\nWHO KNEW?\nThe U.S. Electorial College: Winning the Presidency without a Plurality\nIn the 2000 U.S. presidential election, Al Gore had a plurality of the popular votes, but he did not win the election.\nWhy? This occurred because the U.S. president and vice president are elected by electors rather than a direct vote by\nthe citizens. The electors are part of the Electoral College, a body of people representing the states. Why was the\nElectoral College created? The Electoral College was created as a compromise between those authors of the U.S.\nConstitution who believed Congress should elect the president, and those who believed the citizens should vote\ndirectly. The popular vote was not recorded until the presidential election of 1824. Since then, only five presidents\nhave been elected without winning a plurality of the popular vote: John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in\n1876, Grover Cleveland in 1888, George Bush in 2000, and Donald Trump in 2016.\nRunoff Voting\nHas your family ever debated what to have for dinner? Suppose your family is deciding on a restaurant and exactly half\nof you want to have pizza but the other half want hamburgers. How do you decide when the result is a tie? You need a\ntiebreaker!\nWill the new democracy of Imaginaria need tiebreakers? When no candidate satisfies the requirements to win the\nelection, arunoff election, or second election, is held to determine a winner.\nHow would runoff voting work in Imaginaria? There are many types ofrunoff voting systems, which are voting systems\nthat utilize a runoff election when the first round does not result in a winner. The method for implementing a runoff\nelection can vary widely, particularly in the criteria used to determine whether a candidate will be on the ballot in the\nsecond election. For example, atwo-round systemis a runoff voting system in which only the top candidates advance to\nthe runoff election. In some two-round systems, only the top two candidates are on the second ballot, or it may be any\ncandidate who secures a certain percentage of the vote will advance. TheHare Methodis another runoff voting system\nin which only the candidate(s) with the very least votes are eliminated. This can potentially result in several rounds of\nrunoff elections.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Voting Methods 1133\nEXAMPLE11.3\nRunoff Election for Condominium Association President\nA condominium association elects a new president every two years by a two-round system of voting. If none of the\ncandidates receive a majority, the association charter states that the top two candidates will be eligible to participate in a\nrunoff election. In a particular year, five residents were nominated. The results of the first round are given in the table\nbelow.\nCandidate Votes in First Round\nAbou 18\nBaiocchi 10\nCampana 5\nDali 11\nEugene 4\n1. Is there a winner based on the first round? Why or why not?\n2. If there is a winner, who won? If there should be a runoff, who will advance to the second round?\nSolution\n1. A majority of 48 total votes is required to win. Begin by finding 50 percent of 48, which is calculated as follows:\n. A majority is 25 or more. No candidate has a majority, so there is no winner based on the first round.\n2. Abou and Dali advance to the second round.\nYOUR TURN11.3\nThe student government bylaws of a particular college require that a new president is elected annually by plurality\nvoting. In the event of a tie, the bylaws require the candidate(s) with the fewest votes to be removed from the ballot\nand a runoff election to be held with the remaining candidates. This process is repeated until a single candidate\nreceives a plurality and wins the election. The results of two voting rounds are given in the table below.\nCandidate Votes in First Round Votes in Second Round\nFerguson 158 168\nGarcia 103 104\nHearn 157 180\nIsaac 123 123\nJackman 58 Eliminated\nKelly 72 74\nLim 158 180\n1.

If there should be a runoff, who must be removed from the ballot?\nSteps to Determine Winner by Plurality or Majority Election with Runoff\nTo determine the winner by plurality or when a majority election with runoff occurs, we take these three steps:\nStep 1:If a majority is required to win the election, determine the number of votes needed to achieve a majority. This is\nthe least whole number greater than 50 percent of the total votes. If a majority is not required, move to Step 2.\nStep 2:Count the number of votes for each candidate in the current round of voting. If a single candidate has enough\nvotes to win a plurality, or a majority as appropriate, then you are done! Otherwise, eliminate a predetermined number\nof candidates based on the rules of the election. Elimination conditions may vary. For example, the rules may state that\nthe candidate(s) with the fewest votes will be eliminated (as in the Hare method), or that only the candidates meeting a\ncertain threshold will move on (as in a two-round system). Once the appropriate candidates are eliminated, move on to\nStep 3.\nStep 3:Hold a runoff election. If the runoff is simulated using a list of voter\u2019s preferences, renumber the preferences to\nreflect the remaining number of options in such a way that the original order of preference is retained. Then repeat Step\n2.\nNote: The second and third steps may be repeated as many times as necessary for voting procedures that allow multiple\nrunoffs.\nEXAMPLE11.4\nFamily Dinner Night\nThe five members of the Chionilis family\u2014Annette, Rene, Seema, Titus, and Galen\u2014have decided to get takeout for\ndinner. They are trying to decide on a restaurant. The options are Rainbow China, Dough Boys Pizza, Taco City, or\nCaribbean Flavor. They will use majority election with runoffs where the restaurant with the fewest votes is eliminated in\neach round. The preferences of each family member are listed by first initial in the table below. An entry of 1 represents\nthe person\u2019s first choice; 2, their second; and so on.

In other words, hold a second round. Since we have a list of the voters\u2019 preferences\nwith the eliminated option removed, we will renumber the preferences as first, second, and third so that we keep\nthe original order of preference. The result is that we will count the second-place vote of any voter whose first\nchoice was eliminated.\nOptions A R S T G\nRainbow China 1 3 2 1 2\nDough Boys Pizza 2 2 1 2 1\nCaribbean Flavor 3 1 3 3 3\nStep 4:Repeat the process from Step 2.

Recall that ranked-choice voting is still the Hare Method where the candidate with\nthe very least number of votes is eliminated each round until a majority is attained. The difference here is that the voters\nhave completed a ranked ballot, so they don't have to visit the polls multiple times. Here are the steps for ranked-choice\nvoting.\nSteps to Determine Winner by Ranked-Choice Voting\nTo determine the winner when ranked-choice voting occurs, we take these three steps:\nStep 1:Determine the number of votes needed to achieve a majority.

Another type\nof ranked voting is theBorda count method, which uses ranked ballots that award candidates points corresponding to\nthe number of candidates ranked lower on each ballot.\nTo understand how this works, let\u2019s review the favorite colors of our kindergarten class from the table below. Let\u2019s focus\non the votes represented by the first column of the preference summary.\nNumber of Ballots 4 6 4 7\nRed 2 6 2 5\nBlue 1 2 1 4\nGreen 6 5 5 2\nYellow 5 4 6 3\nPurple 4 3 4 1\nPink 3 1 3 6\nEach student had six options. This first column tells us that four students ranked blue as their first choice, red as their\nsecond choice, pink as their third choice, purple as their fourth choice, yellow as their fifth choice, and green as their\nsixth choice. Blue was ranked higher than other colors. For each of the four students who completed their\nballot in this way, blue would receive five points. Since there were four ballots with this ordering, blue would receive\npoints from the first column. To determine the total points for each candidate, we have to find the sum of the\npoints they received in each column.\nTo determine the winner of a contest using the Borda count method, we must compare total number of points earned by\neach candidate. The candidate with the most points is the winner. Each row of the preference summary corresponds to a\nsingle candidate. To find the number of points received by a particular candidate in the preference summary, or their\nBorda score, we will need to focus on the row in which that candidate appears.\nBefore we practice determining the winner of a Borda count election, let\u2019s examine how to find the Borda score for a\nsingle candidate.\nEXAMPLE11.7\nMost Popular Color in Kindergarten Revisited\nLet\u2019s review the ballots from the kindergarten class again, as shown in the table below.

Did the same candidate win? What observations can you make\nabout the results?\nThe Borda count method may seem too complicated to even consider using for Imaginaria, but each voting method has\nits own pros and cons. The Borda count method, for example, favors compromise candidates over divisive candidates. A\ncompromise candidateis not the first choice of most of the voters, but is more acceptable to the population as a whole 1144 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nthan the other candidates. Adivisive candidateis simultaneously the first choice of a large portion of the voters and the\nlast choice of another large portion of the voters.\nInExample 11.8, Candidate A was ranked first by 225 voters, but was ranked last by 185 voters. No voters ranked\nCandidate A as second or third. It appears that, although Candidate A had the majority of first place votes, there was a\nsignificant minority who strongly disliked them. Candidate A was a divisive candidate. Candidate B, on the other hand,\nwas the second choice of every voter, making Candidate B a good compromise. The Borda count method chose\nCandidate B, a compromise candidate, that was more acceptable to the population as a whole. This scenario is cited by\nboth opponents and proponents of the Borda count method.\nVIDEO\nDetermine Winner of Election by Borda Count Method(https://openstax.org/r/Borda_count_method)\nPairwise Comparison and Condorcet Voting\nWe have discussed two kinds of ranked voting methods so far: ranked-choice and Borda count. A third type of ranked\nvoting is thepairwise comparison method, in which the candidates receive a point for each candidate they would beat\nin a one-on-one election and half a point for each candidate they would tie. If one candidate earns more points than the\nothers, then that candidate wins. This method is one of severalCondorcet voting methods, which are methods in which\ncandidates are ranked and then compared pairwise to each other, a candidate having to beat all others in order to win.\nThese methods vary in the way candidates are scored, and there is not always a clear winner. A candidate who wins each\npossible pairing is known as aCondorcet candidate. These terms are named after the Marquis de Condorcet, a French\nphilosopher and mathematician who preferred the pairwise comparison method to the Hare method and made public\narguments in its favor.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nMarquis de Condorcet\nCondorcet voting methods are named for the Marquis de Condorcet, a French philosopher and mathematician known\nfor, among other accomplishments, writing \u201cSur l'admission des femmes au droit de Cit\u00e9\u201d (\u201cOn the Admission of\nWomen to the Rights of Citizenship\u201d), in 1789, the first published essay on the political rights of women.\nFor more details visit this Web site.\nIf you include a Condorcet voting method in the constitution of Imaginaria, the election supervisors may want to use a\npairwise comparison matrix like the one inFigure 11.3. It\u2019s a tool used to list the number of wins associated with each\npairing of two candidates. Each candidate will receive a point for each win and a half a point for each tie. Each pairing is\nlisted twice, once for the number of wins of a candidate over a particular challenger and once for the number of wins of\nthe challenger over that candidate.\nFigure11.3Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Three Candidates\nSteps to Determine a Winner by Pairwise Comparison Method Using a Matrix\nTo determine the winner when the pairwise comparison method is used, we take these three steps:\nStep 1:On the matrix, indicate a losing matchup by crossing out a box, , and tie match ups by drawing a slash\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Voting Methods 1145\nthrough the box, .\nStep 2:Award each candidate 1 point for a win, half a point for a tie, and 0 points for a loss.\nStep 3:Identify the winner, which is the candidate with the most points.\nVIDEO\nDetermine Winner of Election by Using the Pairwise Comparison Method(https://openstax.org/r/\npairwise_comparison_method)\nBefore you decide on the pairwise comparison method for Imaginaria, review what\u2019s involved in constructing a pairwise\ncomparison matrix from a summary of ranked ballots.

Is the winner a Condorcet candidate?\nSolution\nThere are four candidates on the ballots. We will need a row and a column for each candidate in addition to the\nheadings, so we will draw a five by five matrix.\nFigure11.4Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Four Candidates\n1. Step 1:Refer toFigure 11.4to determine the values that belong in each cell. 1146 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\n\u25e6 A over B: A is preferred to B in columns 3 and 4. So, A scores points.\n\u25e6 A over C: A is preferred to C in columns 3 and 4. So, A scores 225 points again.\n\u25e6 A over D: Similarly, A scores 225 points.\n\u25e6 B over A: B is preferred to A in columns 1 and 2. So, B scores points.\nStep 2:Continuing in this way, we complete the pairwise comparison matrix, as shown inFigure 11.5.\nFigure11.5Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Four Candidates with Vote Counts\n2. Step 1:Losing pairings are crossed off with an . In the event of a tie, we will draw a slash, .\nStep 2:Determine the number of points for each candidate by analyzing their row of wins.

If there is a Condorcet candidate, does that candidate always win?\nLet\u2019s think about why these questions might be important to you if you chose the pairwise comparison method. First, if\nno candidate meets the criteria to win an election, you will need a backup plan such as a runoff election. Second, if the\nwinner is not a Condorcet candidate, then there is at least one candidate who beat the winner in a pairwise matchup and\nthe supporters of that candidate might question the validity of the election. Finally, if there is a Condorcet candidate who\nbeat every other candidate in a pairwise matchup, it is reasonable to conclude that it would be unfair for anyone else to\nwin. The rest of the examples in this section should illustrate these key concepts.\nEXAMPLE11.10\nRock, Paper, Scissors by Pairwise Comparison\nSuppose that three people are playing the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. On the count of three, each person shows a hand\nsignal for rock, paper, or scissors. Each hand signal beats another hand signal. The group keeps having a tie because\nPerson A always picks rock, Person B always picks paper which beats rock, and Person C always picks scissors which\nbeats paper, and is beaten by rock! This leads to a disagreement about which choice is best. They decide to use the\npairwise comparison method determine the winner. Their preference rankings are given in the following table. 1148 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nVoters A B C\nRock (R) 1 3 2\nPaper (P) 2 1 3\nScissors (S) 3 2 1\nSolution\nConstruct the comparison matrix:\nFigure11.7Rock, Paper, Scissors Pairwise Comparison Matrix\nThere is a tie! There is no winner.\nExample 11.10illustrates the answer to the first key question. The pairwise comparison method does not always result in\na winner. For example, much like the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, it is possible for a cyclic pattern to emerge in which\neach candidate beats the next until the last candidate who beats the first.\nFigure11.8Rock, Paper, Scissors Cyclic Outcome\nYOUR TURN11.10\n1. A pairwise comparison matrix is given. Determine the winner by the pairwise comparison method. If there is not\na winner, explain why. If there is a winner, tell whether the winner is a Condorcet candidate.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Voting Methods 1149\nA Pairwise Comparison Matrix\nNow, you have the answer to the second key question. The pairwise comparison matrix inYOUR TURN 11.10is an\nexample of a scenario where a winner is not a Condorcet candidate.\nThe answer to the third question is not as clear. If there is a Condorcet candidate, does that candidate win? So far, we\nhave not come across a contradictory example where the Condorcet candidate didn't win, but we cannot know with\ncertainty that it is not possible by looking at examples. Instead, we will need to use some reasoning. Let\u2019s review some\nparticular cases of elections with a certain number of candidates, and then we will try to generalize the scenario to an\nelection with candidates.\nEXAMPLE11.11\nDoes the Condorcet Candidate Win?\n1. Suppose there is an election with five candidates\u2014A, B, C, D, and E\u2014and that Candidate C is a Condorcet candidate.\nHow many points did Candidate C win?\n2. What is the greatest number of points that any one of the other candidates could win?\n3. Is it possible for Candidate C to lose or tie?\nSolution\n1. In any pairwise election with five candidates, each candidate must compete against four other candidates. It follows\nthat the most points a single candidate can win is four points, which would occur if the candidate won every\nmatchup. As a Condorcet candidate, Candidate C won all the pairwise matchups against Candidates A, B, D, and E,\nearning four points.\n2. The rest of the candidates lost to Candidate C. The most points a particular candidate could win if they won\nmatchups with each of the other three candidates is three points.\n3. Since Candidate C has four points and the rest of the candidates have three points or less, Candidate C is the winner.\nTherefore, it is not possible for Candidate C to tie or lose.\nYOUR TURN11.11\nSuppose there is an election with 26 candidates, A through Z, and that Candidate C is a Condorcet candidate.\n1. How many points did Candidate C win?\n2. What is the greatest number of points that any one of the other candidates could win?\n3. Is it possible for Candidate C to lose or tie? 1150 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nLet\u2019s consider a general case where there are candidates. One of the candidates is a Condorcet candidate. Since the\nCondorcet candidate wins all matchups, the Condorcet candidate wins points. Since each of the other candidates\nlost to the Condorcet candidate, the most a single candidate could win is . Since the Condorcet candidate won\npoints and each other candidate won points or fewer, the Condorcet candidate is the winner. You have your answer\nto the third key question! If there is a Condorcet candidate, that candidate is always the winner.\nApproval Voting\nThe last type of voting system you will consider for your budding democracy is anapproval voting system. In this\nsystem, each voter may approve any number of candidates without rank or preference for one over another (among the\napproved candidates), and the candidate approved by the most voters wins. This voting system has aspects in common\nwith plurality voting and Condorcet voting methods, but it has characteristics that distinguish it from both. Anapproval\nvoting ballotlists the candidates and provides the option to approve or not approve each candidate.\nThe term \u201capproval voting\u201d was not used until the 1970s Brams, Steven J.; Fishburn, Peter C. (2007),Approval Voting,\nSpringer-Verlag, p. xv, ISBN 978-0-387-49895-9, although its use has been documented as early as the 13th century\n(Brams, Steven J. (April 1, 2006).The Normative Turn in Public Choice(PDF) (Speech). Presidential Address to Public\nChoice Society. New Orleans, Louisiana.) Approval voting has the appeal of being simpler than ranked voting methods. It\nalso allows an individual voter to support more than one candidate equally. This has appeal for those who do not want a\nsplit vote among a few mainstream candidates to lead to the election of a fringe candidate. It also has appeal for those\nwho want an underdog to have a chance of success because voters will not worry about wasting their vote on a\ncandidate who is not believed likely to win.\nEXAMPLE11.12\nRock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock\nSuppose that Person A/B/C were just about to give up on their game of Rock, Paper, Scissors when they were joined by\nPerson D who reminded them that their updated version, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was a far superior game\nwith the added rules that Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard\npoisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, and Scissors decapitates Lizard.\nFigure11.9Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Dominance\nPerson D encourages their friends to hold a new election. This time, for the sake of simplicity, the group decides to use\napproval voting to determine the best move in the game.

We have covered a lot of options for the voting methods. Now, you need to decide which one is best for\nImaginaria. Imaginarians might consider characteristics of certain voting systems desirable and others undesirable. In\nsome cases, voters may consider these undesirable traits to be flaws in a voting system that are significant enough to\nmotivate them to reject that system. If you are feeling a bit overwhelmed by this decision, maybe it would help to read\nabout the experiences of others who have faced similar questions.\nConsider the 2000 U.S. presidential election in which Green Party candidate Ralph Nader and Reform Party candidate Pat\nBuchanan were on the ballet running against the mainstream candidates, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W.\nBush. The voting results for Florida are given inTable 11.3.\nCandidate Party Votes Percentage\n(G) George W. Bush Republican 2,912,790 48.85%\n(A) Al Gore Democrat 2,912,253 48.84%\nTable11.3Florida Results in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election\n(source: https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/\nFederalElections2000_PresidentialGeneralElectionResultsbyState.pdf)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Voting Methods 1153\nCandidate Party Votes Percentage\n(R) Ralph Nader Green 97,488 1.63%\n(P) Pat Buchanan Reform 17,484 0.29%\n(H) Harry Brown Libertarian 16,415 0.28%\n(O) 7 Other Candidates Other 6,680 0.11%\nTotal 5,963,110\nTable11.3Florida Results in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election\n(source: https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/\nFederalElections2000_PresidentialGeneralElectionResultsbyState.pdf)\nIn more than one state, Buchanan was able to split the Republican vote enough to allow Gore to win that state. Nader\nsplit the Democrat vote in Florida and New Hampshire by enough votes to prevent Gore from winning those states. Had\nGore won either state, he would have had enough electoral votes to win the election. Instead, Bush won. This is an\nexample of a flaw in the plurality system of voting: the spoiler.\nAspoileris a less popular candidate who takes votes from a more popular candidate with similar positions, swinging the\nrace to another candidate with vastly different views that they would not support. This encourages voters not to vote for\nthe candidate that they perceive to be the best, but instead for the candidate they can live with who they perceive to\nhave a better chance of winning. Some voters may prefer a method such as approval voting, which does not have this\ntrait in common with plurality voting.\nEXAMPLE11.14\nThe Spoiler Controversy\nBecause the vote counts for George W. Bush and Al Gore differed by only 537 votes, many Democrats blamed Ralph\nNader and the Green Party for their loss. Let\u2019s consider how the election results might have differed if the approval\nvoting method had been used.\nUseTable 11.3and the following assumptions to extrapolate the results of an approval method election:\n\u2022 100 percent of Pat Buchanan supporters would approve George W. Bush.\n\u2022 100 percent of Ralph Nader supporters would approve Al Gore.\n\u2022 72 percent of Libertarians would approve George W. Bush.\n\u2022 28 percent of Libertarians would approve Al Gore (as was roughly the known percentage at the time according to\nthe Cato Institute).\n\u2022 50 percent of the supporters of other candidates would approve George Bush while 50 percent would approve Al\nGore.\nSolution\nStep 1:Create a summary of approval ballots based on the given assumptions. For the Libertarian candidate, 72 percent\nof 16,415 of the votes is and 28 percent is . For the other candidates, 50\npercent of the votes is .\n2,912,790 2,912,253 97,488 17,484 11,819 4,596 3,340 3,340\nNumber of Votes\n(G) (A) (R) (B) (72% H) (28% H) (50% O) (50% O)\n(G) George W.

Bush:\n\u2022 Al Gore:\n\u2022 Ralph Nader:\n\u2022 Pat Buchanan:\n\u2022 Harry Brown:\n\u2022 Other Candidates:\nIn this scenario, Al Gore is the winner.\nYOUR TURN11.14\n1. Extrapolate the results of an approval method election using Table 11.3, the assumptions from Example 11.14,\nand the additional assumptions that the supporters of Al Gore would all approve Ralph Nader and that half of\nthe supporters of George Bush would approve Pat Buchanan while half would approve Harry Brown.\nThe results inExample 11.14andYour Turn 11.14highlight one of the characteristics of approval voting. Ralph Nader\nmoved up from a distant third place finish to a close second place finish when Al Gore\u2019s supporters approved him on\ntheir ballots. In this way, fringe candidates have a better chance of winning, which some voters consider a flaw but\nothers consider a benefit.\nAnother aspect of approval voting systems that is a concern to many voters is that candidates in approval elections\nmight encourage their loyal supporters to approve them and only them to avoid giving support to any other candidate.\nIf this occurred, the election in effect becomes a traditional plurality election. This is a flaw that cannot occur in an\ninstant runoff system since all candidates are ranked.\nEXAMPLE11.15\nThree Habitable Planets\nIn the future, humans have explored distant solar systems and found three habitable planets which could be colonized.\nSince it will take all available resources to colonize one planet, humans must agree on the planet. Planet A has the most\ncomfortable climate and most plentiful resources, but it is the farthest from Earth making travel to the planet a\nchallenge. Planet B is half the distance but will require more resources to make comfortable. Planet C is the least suitable\nof the three and terraforming will be required, but it is close enough to make travel between Earth and Planet C possible\non a more regular basis.

Plurality\n2. Ranked-choice method\n3. Borda count\nSolution\n1. The plurality method only considers the top choice of each voter. By this system, Planet A has 45 percent of the vote,\nPlanet B has 15 percent of the vote, and Planet C has 40 percent of the vote. Planet A wins.\n2. Using either instant runoff or a two-round system, Planet B with only 15 percent of the vote will be eliminated in the\nfirst round. In Round 2, the 15 percent that voted for Planet B would vote for their second choice, Planet C. This\nleaves Planet A with 45 percent and Planet C with 55 percent. Planet C has a majority and wins the election.\n3. To find the Borda score for each candidate, imagine there are exactly 100 voters. Then the summary of ranked\nballots looks like:\nOut of 100 Voters 45 15 40\nPlanet A 1 3 3\nPlanet B 2 1 2\nPlanet C 3 2 1\nThe Borda score for each candidate is as follows:\nPlanet A:\nPlanet B:\nPlanet C:\nPlanet B wins.\nYOUR TURN11.15\nThe juniors at a high school in Central Florida are voting for a theme park to visit for an end of the year field trip.

Borda count\nThe election inExample 11.15involves a scenario in which there are two extreme candidates, Planet A and Planet B, and\na moderate candidate, Planet C. The supporters of the extreme candidates prefer the moderate candidate to the other\nextremist ones. This makes Planet C a compromise candidate. In this case, both the plurality method and ranked-choice\nvoting resulted in the election of one of the extreme candidates, but the Borda count method elected the compromise\ncandidate in this scenario. Depending on a person\u2019s perspective, this may be perceived as a flaw in either ranked-choice\nand plurality systems, or the Borda count method.\nInFairness in Voting Methods, we will analyze the fairness of each voting system in greater detail using objective\nmeasures of fairness.\nTECH CHECK\nVoting Calculators\nIt is possible to create Excel spreadsheets that complete the calculations necessary to determine the winner of an\nelection by various voting methods.

Apply Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem when evaluating voting fairness.\nNow that we\u2019ve covered a variety of voting methods and discussed their differences and similarities, you might be\nleaning toward one method over another. You will need to convince the other founders of Imaginaria that your\npreference will be the best for the country. Before your collaborators approve the inclusion of a voting method in the\nconstitution, they will want to know that the voting method is a fair method. In this section, we will formally define the\ncharacteristics of a fair system. We will analyze each voting previously discussed to determine which characteristics of\nfairness they have, and which they do not. In order to guarantee one ideal, we must often sacrifice others.\nThe Majority Criterion\nOne of the most fundamental concepts in voting is the idea that most voters should be in favor of a candidate for a\ncandidate to win, and that a candidate should not win without majority support. This concept is known as themajority\ncriterion.\nWith respect to the four main ranked voting methods we have discussed\u2014plurality, ranked-choice, pairwise comparison,\nand the Borda count method\u2014we will explore two important questions:\n1. Which of these voting systems satisfy the majority criterion and which do not?\n2. Is it always \u201cfair\u201d for a voting system to satisfy the majority criterion?\nKeep in mind that this criterion only applies when one of the candidates has a majority. So, the examples we will analyze\nwill be based on scenarios in which a single candidate has more than 50 percent of the vote.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Fairness in Voting Methods 1163\nEXAMPLE11.16\nRoommates Choose Fast Food\nIt\u2019s final exams week and seven college students are hungry. They must get food, but from which drive thru? Their\npreferences are listed in the table below. The majority have listed McDonald\u2019s as their top choice. Let\u2019s calculate what the\nresults of the election will be using various voting methods.\nVoters A B C D E F G\n(M) McDonald\u2019s 1 1 1 1 5 5 5\n(B) Burger King 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n(T) Taco Bell 4 4 3 4 3 3 1\n(O) Pollo Tropical 3 5 4 3 4 1 3\n(I) Pizza Hut 5 3 5 5 1 4 4\n1. Which restaurant is the winner using the plurality voting method?\n2. Which restaurant is the winner using the ranked-choice voting method?\n3. Does the majority criterion apply? If so, for which of voting method(s), if any, did the majority criterion fail?\nSolution\n1. For plurality voting, we only need to count the first-place votes for each candidate. In this case, McDonald\u2019s has four\nfirst place votes, which is a majority and wins the election automatically.\n2. For ranked-choice voting, McDonald\u2019s also wins because it has a majority at the end of Round 1.\n3. The majority criterion does apply because one candidate had a majority of the first-place votes. The majority\ncriterion did not fail by either method, because in each case the majority candidate won.\nYOUR TURN11.16\nUse the information in the table to answer the following questions.\nVoters L M N O P\nOption A 2 2 3 2 1\nOption B 1 4 1 4 2\nOption C 3 1 4 1 3\nOption D 4 1 2 3 4\n1. Which option is the winner when using the plurality voting method?\n2. Which option is the winner when using the ranked-choice voting method?\n3. Does the majority criterion apply? If so, for which voting method(s), if any, did the majority criterion fail?\nFromExample 11.16, it appears that the plurality and ranked-choice voting methods satisfy the majority criterion. In\ngeneral, the majority candidate always wins in a plurality election because the candidate that has more than half of the\nvotes has more votes than any other candidate. The same is true for ranked-choice voting; and there will never be a\nneed for a second round when there is a majority candidate. Let\u2019s examine how some of the other voting methods stand 1164 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nup to the majority criterion.\nEXAMPLE11.17\nRoommates Choose Fast Food\nThose seven college students are hungry again! Their preferences haven\u2019t changed, as shown below. Let\u2019s calculate if the\nresults change when we use different voting methods.\nVOTERS A B C D E F G\n(M) McDonald\u2019s 1 1 1 1 5 5 5\n(B) Burger King 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n(T) Taco Bell 4 4 3 4 3 3 1\n(O) Pollo Tropical 3 5 4 3 4 1 3\n(I) Pizza Hut 5 3 5 5 1 4 4\n1. Which restaurant is the winner using the pairwise comparison voting method?\n2. Which restaurant is the winner using the Borda count voting method?\n3. Does the majority criterion apply? If so, for which voting method(s), if any, did the majority criterion fail?\nSolution\n1. For pairwise comparison, notice that McDonald\u2019s is a Condorcet candidate because it wins every pairwise\ncomparison. So, McDonald\u2019s is the winner.\n2. For the Borda count, we must calculate the Borda score for each candidate: McDonald\u2019s is 16, Burger King is 21, Taco\nBell is 13, Pollo Tropical is 12, Pizza Hut is 8. The winner is Burger King!\n3. Yes, the majority criterion applies because McDonald\u2019s has the majority of first place votes. The majority criterion\nonly fails using the Borda method.\nYOUR TURN11.17\nUse the information in the following table to find the winner using each of the voting methods in parts 1 and 2, then\nanswer the question in part 3.\nVoters L M N O P\nOption A 2 2 3 2 2\nOption B 1 4 1 4 1\nOption C 3 1 4 1 3\nOption D 4 3 2 3 4\n1. Pairwise comparison\n2. Borda count\n3. Does the majority criterion apply? If so, for which voting method(s) did the majority criterion fail?\nExample 11.17demonstrates a concept that we also saw inBorda Count Voting\u2014the Borda method frequently favors the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Fairness in Voting Methods 1165\ncompromise candidate over the divisive candidate. This can happen even when the divisive candidate has a majority, as\nit did in this example. Although a majority of the voters were in favor of McDonald\u2019s, a significant minority was strongly\nopposed to McDonald\u2019s, ranking it last. Since the Borda score includes all rankings, this strong opposition has an impact\non the outcome of the election.\nPairwise comparison will always satisfy the majority criterion because the candidate with the majority of first-place votes\nwins each pairwise matchup. While it is possible for the majority candidate to win by the Borda count method, it is not\nguaranteed. So, the Borda method fails the majority criterion. A summary of each voting method as it relates to the\nmajority criterion is found in the following table.\nVoting Method Majority Criterion\nPlurality Satisfies\nRanked-choice Satisfies\nPairwise comparison Satisfies\nBorda count Violates\nIf you prefer the Borda method, you might argue that its failure to satisfy the majority criterion is actually one of its\nstrengths. As we saw inExample 11.16andExample 11.17, the majority have the power to vote for their own benefit at\nthe expense of the minority. While four students were very enthusiastic about McDonald\u2019s, three students were strongly\nopposed to McDonald\u2019s. It is reasonable to say that the better option would be Burger King, the compromise candidate,\nwhich everyone ranked highly and no one strongly opposed. The Borda method is designed to favor a candidate that is\nacceptable to the population as a whole. In this way, the Borda method avoids a downfall of strict majority rule known as\nthetyranny of the majority, which occurs when a minority of a population is treated unfairly because their situation is\ndifferent from the situation of the majority.\nThe people of Imaginaria should know that the power of the majority to vote their will has serious implications for other\ngroups. For example, according to the UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, the LGBTQ+ community in the United\nStates makes up approximately 4.5 percent of the population. When elections occur that include issues that affect the\nLGBTQ+ community, members of the LGBTQ+ community depend on the 95.5 percent of the population who do not\nidentify as LGBTQ+ to consider their perspectives when voting on issues such as same-sex marriage, the use of public\nrestrooms by transgender people, and adoption by same-sex couples.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nRobert Dahl\nIn his book,Democracy and Its Critics, Robert Dahl wrote, \u201cIf a majority is not entitled to do so, then it is thereby\ndeprived of its rights; but if a majority is entitled to do so, then it can deprive the minority of its rights.\u201d Dahl was a\nrenowned political theorist, but he is also considered to be a mathematician since his work utilizes ideas from an area\nof mathematics known as Game Theory (Mathematics Genealogy Project, NDSU Department of Mathematics with the\nAmerican Mathematical Society).\nWHO KNEW?\nThree Branches of Government\nConcerns about the consequences of majority rule are not new. In 1788, John Adams warned of the consequences of\nmajority rule and he argued for three branches of government as a way to temper them. In the early 1800s, a young\nFrench aristocrat named Alexis de Tocqueville toured the United States and wroteDemocracy in America, which\nfocused on the impact of democracy on political and civil societies. He observed, even then, the dominance of the\nwhite majority over the Indigenous people and enslaved people, which was perpetuated by majority rule. 1166 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nVIDEO\nSeparation of Powers and Checks and Balances(https://openstax.org/r/separation_of_powers)\nHead-to-Head Criterion\nAnother fairness criterion you must consider as you select a voting method for Imaginaria is theCondorcet criterion,\nalso known as the head-to-head criterion. An election method satisfies the Condorcet criterion provided that the\nCondorcet candidate wins the election whenever a Condorcet candidate exists. ACondorcet methodis any voting\nmethod that satisfies the Condorcet criterion.\nRecall fromThree Key Questionsthat not every election has a Condorcet candidate; the Condorcet criterion will not apply\nto every election. Also recall that a Condorcet candidate cannot lose an election by pairwise comparison. So, the pairwise\ncomparison voting method is said to satisfy the Condorcet criterion.\nEXAMPLE11.18\nSpending Tax Refund\nA survey asked a random sample of 100 people in the United States to rank their priorities for spending their tax refund.\nThe options were (V) go on vacation, (S) put into savings, (D) pay off debt, or (T) other. The pairwise comparison matrix\nfor the results is inFigure 11.11. Determine whether the Condorcet criterion applies.\nFigure11.11Pairwise Comparison Matrix for Tax Refund Spending\nSolution\nThe Condorcet criterion only applies when there is a Condorcet candidate. \u201cPay off debt\u201d (D) is a Condorcet candidate\nbecause D wins every matchup. Yes, the Condorcet criterion applies to this election.\nYOUR TURN11.18\n1.

We know that the Condorcet criterion applies\nbecause Option D, \u201cPay off debt,\u201d is a Condorcet candidate, which wins every pairwise match up.\nUse the information in the ballot summary from the table below to find the winner and determine whether the\nCondorcet criterion is satisfied in this election when each of the following voting methods are used.\nVotes 33 32 31 4\nOn a vacation (V) 1 3 3 2\nPut into savings (S) 3 1 2 1\nPay off debt (D) 2 2 1 4\nOther (T) 4 4 4 3\n1. Plurality\n2. Ranked-choice voting\n3. Borda count\nSolution\n1. V wins 33 first place votes; S, 36; D, 31; and T, 0. So candidate S, \u201cPut into savings,\u201d has a plurality and wins. Since the\nCondorcet candidate D didn\u2019t win, the Condorcet criterion is violated.\n2. Use the steps outlined inRanked-Choice Votingfor determining the winner of an election by ranked-choice voting,\nthe application of the Hare method in which instant runoffs are used.\nStep 1:The number of votes needed to achieve a majority is 51.\nStep 2:As illustrated in part 1, no candidate has a majority of first-place votes; so the candidate with the fewest\nvotes, T, must be eliminated.\nStep 3:Reallocate votes to the remaining candidates for the second round:\nVotes 33 32 31 4\nOn a vacation (V) 1 3 3 2\nPut into savings (S) 3 1 2 1\nPay off debt (D) 2 2 1 3\nStep 4:Repeat the process from Step 2.

Since the Condorcet candidate D candidate D, \u201cPay off\ndebt,\u201d didn\u2019t win, the Condorcet criterion is violated.\n3. Calculate the Borda score for each candidate.\nV:\nS:\nD:\nT:\nCandidate D, \u201cPay off debt,\u201d has the highest Borda score and wins. Since D was the Condorcet candidate, this election\nsatisfies the Condorcet criterion.\nYOUR TURN11.19\nUse the summary of ranked ballots below to find the winner and determine whether the Condorcet criterion is\nsatisfied when each of the following voting methods are used. Recall that Option A is a Condorcet candidate.\nVotes 3 2\nOption A 1 3\nOption B 2 1\nOption C 3 2\n1. Plurality\n2. Ranked-choice voting\n3. Borda count\nAs we have seen, the plurality method, ranked-choice voting, and the Borda count method each fail the Condorcet\ncriterion in some circumstances. Of the four main ranked voting methods we have discussed, only the pairwise\ncomparison method satisfies the Condorcet criterion every time. A summary of each voting method as it relates to the\nCondorcet criterion is found in the following table.\nVoting Method Condorcet Criterion\nPlurality Violates\nRanked-choice Violates\nPairwise comparison Satisfies\nBorda count Violates\nMonotonicity Criterion\nThe citizens of Imaginaria might be surprised to learn that it is possible for a voter to cause a candidate to lose by\nranking that candidate higher on their ballot. Is that fair? Most voters would say, \u201cAbsolutely not!!\u201d This is an example of\na violation of the fairness criterion called themonotonicity criterion, which is satisfied when no candidate is harmed by\nup-ranking nor helped by down-ranking, provided all other votes remain the same.\nConsider a scenario in which voters are permitted a first round that is not binding, and then they may change their vote\nbefore the second round. Such a first round can be called a \u201cstraw poll.\u201d Now, let\u2019s suppose that a particular candidate\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Fairness in Voting Methods 1169\nwon the straw poll. After that, several voters are convinced to increase their support, orup-rank, that winning candidate\nand no voters decrease that support. It is reasonable to expect that the winner of the first round will also win the second.\nSimilarly, if some of the voters decide to decrease their support, ordown-rank, a losing candidate, it is reasonable to\nexpect that candidate will still lose in the second round.\nYou might be wondering why it\u2019s called the monotonicity criterion. In mathematics, the term monotonicity refers to the\nquality of always increasing or always decreasing. For example, a person\u2019s age is monotonic because it always increases,\nwhereas a person\u2019s weight is not monotonic because it can increase or decrease. If the only changes to the votes for a\nparticular candidate after a straw poll are in one direction, this change is considered monotonic.\nIf you are going to make an informed decision about which voting method to use in Imaginaria, you need to know which\nof the four main ranked voting methods we have discussed\u2014plurality, ranked-choice, pairwise comparison, and the\nBorda count method\u2014satisfy the monotonicity criterion.\nEXAMPLE11.20\nFavorite Dog Breed by Plurality\nThe local animal shelter is having a vote-by-donation charity event. For a $10 donation, an individual can complete a\nranked ballot indicating their favorite large dog breed: standard poodle, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, or bulldog.\nUse the summary of ballots below to answer each question.\nVotes 42 53 61 24\n(S) Standard Poodle 1 3 2 1\n(G) Golden Retriever 3 1 4 4\n(L) Labrador Retriever 4 2 1 2\n(B) Bulldog 2 4 3 3\n1. Determine the winner of the election by plurality.\n2. Suppose that the 53 voters in the second column increased their ranking of the winner by 1. Determine the winner\nby plurality with the new rankings.\n3. Does this election violate the monotonicity criterion?\n4. Do you think the result of part 3 is also true for plurality voting and the monotonicity criterion in general? Why or\nwhy not?\nSolution\n1. The number of votes for each candidate are: S 66, G 53, L 61, and B 0. The winner is the standard poodle.\n2. If the 53 voters in the second column rank S as 2 and L as 3, then the number of votes for each candidate are: S with\n66, G with 53, L with 61, and B with 0. The winner is still the standard poodle.\n3. This election does not violate the monotonicity criterion because the winner was not hurt by up-ranking.\n4. In general, increasing the ranking for a winner of a plurality election will either leave them with the same or more\nfirst place votes while leaving the other candidates with the same or fewer first place votes. So a plurality election\nwill never violate the monotonicity criterion.\nYOUR TURN11.20\nUse the Favorite Large Dog Breed Ballot Summary to answer each question.\n1.

Determine the winner by\nthe pairwise comparison method with the new rankings.\n3. Does this election violate the monotonicity criterion?\n4. Do you think the result of part 3 is true for the pairwise comparison method and the monotonicity criterion in\ngeneral? Why or why not?\nSolution\n1. By the pairwise comparison method, Option A wins with three points.\n2. If the 95 voters in the first column ofFigure 11.12increased their ranking of the winner by 1, then C would fall into\nfourth place and A would move up to third place on those ballots. This would only affect the matchup between A\nand C, and the result would be that A would gain 95 votes while C would lose 95 votes. This means A would have 320\nvotes and C would have 90. Since A already was ahead of C, this just puts A further ahead and causes no change to\nthe election results.\n3. Since the winner A is not hurt by an up-rank, and the loser C is not helped by a down-rank, this election is fair by the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Fairness in Voting Methods 1171\nmonotonicity criterion.\n4. Yes, the monotonicity criterion would be satisfied by the pairwise comparison method, because an up-rank of the\nwinner can never decrease the number of pairwise wins.

Of the four main ranked voting methods we have discussed, only the ranked-\nchoice method violates the monotonicity criterion.

Consider this well-known anecdote that is sometimes attributed to the American philosopher Sidney\nMorgenbesser:\nA man is told by his waiter that the dessert options this evening are blueberry pie or apple pie. The man orders the apple\npie. The waiter returns and tells him that there is also a third option, cherry pie. The man says, \u201cIn that case, I would like\nthe blueberry pie.\u201d (Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren\u2019t Fair (and What We Can Do About It), William Pound stone, p.\n50, ISBN 0-8090-4893-0)\nThis story illustrates the concept of the Irrelevant Alternatives Criterion, also known as theIndependence of Irrelevant\nAlternatives Criterion (IIA),which means that the introduction or removal of a third candidate should not change or\nreverse the rankings of the original two candidates relative to one another. In particular, if a losing candidate is removed\nfrom the race or if a new candidate is added, the winner of the race should not change.\nEXAMPLE11.22\nApple, Blueberry, or Cherry?\nSuppose that 30 students in a class are going to vote on whether to have apple, blueberry, or cherry pie.

The number of first place votes for each candidate is: A with 14, B with 12, and C with 4. Apple pie has the most first-\nplace votes and wins the election.\n2. If cherry pie is removed from the ballot, then the four voters in the third column now rank blueberry pie as their first\nchoice. So the four votes for C now belong to B. This means that blueberry pie has 16 votes compared to the 14\nvotes for apple pie. Blueberry pie now wins the plurality election.\n3. Yes, the election violates the IIA because the removal of a losing candidate from the ballot changed the winner of\nthe election.\nYOUR TURN11.22\nThe local animal shelter is having another vote-by-donation charity event!

When\nhundreds of thousands to millions of votes must be collected and counted in a short period of time, deciding it can be\nchallenging to be on counting procedures that are accurate and secure. Electronic voting machines or even Internet\nvoting can speed up the process, but how reliable are these methods? This has been a subject for debate for years.\nIn a press release on August 3, 2007, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen explained the results of an extensive\nreview of electronic voting systems in her state. She said that transparency and auditability were key. She went on to\nsay, \u201cI think voters and counties are the victims of a federal certification process that hasn\u2019t done an adequate job of\nensuring that the systems made available to them are secure, accurate, reliable and accessible. Congress enacted the\nHelp America Vote Act, which pushed many counties into buying electronic systems that\u2014as we\u2019ve seen for some\ntime and we saw again in the independent UC review\u2014were not properly reviewed or tested to ensure that they\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Fairness in Voting Methods 1175\nprotected the integrity of the vote.\u201d Secretary Bowden subsequently ordered that voting machines must have tighter\nsecurity to be used in California. (DB07:042, Secretary of State Debra Bowen Moves to Strengthen Voter Confidence in\nElection Security Following Top-to-Bottom Review of Voting Systems, https://sos.ca.gov/elections.) In some instances,\nthe use of electronic voting in parliamentary elections has been discontinued completely for security reasons. For\nexample, according to the National Democratic Institute, the Netherlands returned to all paper ballots and hand\ncounting in 2006. Will you use voting machines or Internet voting in Imaginaria?\nSo far, every one of the voting methods we have analyzed has failed one or more of the fairness criteria in one\nelection or another.\nVoting Majority Condorcet Criterion (Head- Monotonicity (Independence of) Irrelevant\nMethod Criterion to-Head Criterion) Criterion Alternatives Criterion\nPlurality Satisfies Violates Satisfies Violates\nRanked- Satisfies Violates Satisfies Violates\nchoice\nPairwise Satisfies Satisfies Violates Violates\ncomparison\nBorda count Violates Violates Satisfies Violates\nYou might be wondering if there is a voting system you could recommend for Imaginaria that satisfies all the fairness\ncriteria. If there is one, it remains to be discovered and it is not a voting system that is based solely on preference\nrankings. In 1972, Harvard Professor of Economics Kenneth J. Arrow received the Nobel Prize in Economics for proving\nArrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem, which states that any voting system, either existing or yet to be created, in which the\nonly information available is the preference rankings of the candidates, will fail to satisfy at least one of the following\nfairness criteria: the majority criterion, the Condorcet criterion, the monotonicity criterion, and the independence of\nirrelevant alternatives criterion. This theorem only applies to a specific category of voting systems\u2014those for which the\npreference ranking is the only information collected. There are other types of voting systems to which the Impossibility\nTheorem does not apply. For example, there is a class of voting systems calledCardinal voting systemsthat allow for\nrating the candidates in some way.\n\u201cRating\u201d is different from \u201cranking\u201d because a voter can give different candidates the same rating. Consider the five-star\nrating systems used by various industries, or the thumbs up/thumbs down rating system used on YouTube. Could there\nbe a Cardinal voting system that does not violate any of the fairness criteria we have discussed? It\u2019s possible, but more\nresearch must be done in order to prove it.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nKenneth J. Arrow\nIn 1972, Kenneth J. Arrow, a Harvard Professor of Economics, received the Nobel Prize in Economics jointly with Sir\nJohn Hicks, another world renowned economist, for their contributions to economic theory. In particular, Professor\nArrow proved mathematically that no ranked voting system meets all four of the fairness criteria discussed in this\nsection. The statement of this fact is known as Arrow\u2019s Impossibility Theorem.Visit this site for more details on\nProfessor Arrow(https://openstax.org/r/prizes/economic-sciences/1972/arrow/facts/)\nCheck Your Understanding\n8.

Explain your reasoning.\n1. In a plurality election, the candidates have the following vote counts: A 125, B 132, C 149, D 112. The pairwise\nmatchup points for each candidate would have been: A 1, B 3, C 1, D 1.\n2. In a Borda count election, the candidates have the following Borda scores: A 1245, B 1360, C 787. Candidate A\nreceived 55 percent of the first-place rankings.\n3. In a pairwise comparison election, the four candidates initially received the following points for winning\nmatchups: A 2, B , , C 1, D . When candidate C dropped out of the election, the remaining candidates\nreceived: A 1, B , D .\n4. In a Borda count election, the candidates have the following Borda scores: A 15, B 11, C 12, D 16. The pairwise\nmatchup points for the same voter profiles would have been: A 2, B 0, C 1, D 3.\n5. In a Borda count election, the candidates have the following Borda scores: A 15, B 11, C 12, D 16. When\nCandidate E was added to the ballot, the Borda scores became: A 25, B 21, C 15, D 24, E 18.\n6. In a pairwise comparison election, Candidate C was a Condorcet candidate in a straw poll. When the actual\nelection took place, several voters up-ranked Candidate C on their ballots, but no other changes were made to\nthe voter preferences, and Candidate B won the election.\nFor the following exercises, use the table below.\nVotes 49 51\nCandidate A 3 1\nCandidate B 1 2\nCandidate C 2 3\n7.

(credit: \u201capple spice cake\u201d by Mark Bonica/Flickr, CC\nBY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Analyze the apportionment problem and applications to representation.\n2. Evaluate applications of standard divisors.\n3. Evaluate applications of standard quotas.\nThe Apportionment Problem\nIn the new democracy of Imaginaria, there are four states: Fictionville, Pretendstead, Illusionham, and Mythbury. Each\nstate will have representatives in the Imaginarian Legislature. You might now have an agreement on which voting\nmethod your citizens will use to elect representatives. However, before that process can even begin, you must decided on\nhow many representatives each state will receive. This decision will present its own challenges.\nWhen sharing your birthday cake, it\u2019s only fair that everyone gets the same portion size, right? You were portioning the\ncake by dividing it up equally and giving everyone a slice. A great thing about cake is that you can slice it any way you\nwant, but how do youapportion, or divide and distribute, items that can't be sliced? Suppose that you have a box of 16\nRing Pops\u2122, gem-shaped lollipops on a plastic ring. You are going to share the box with four other kids. Dividing the 16\nRing Pops\u2122 among the group of five leads to a problem; after each person in the group gets three Ring Pops\u2122, there is\nstill one left! Who gets the last one? Theapportionment problemis how to fairly divide, or apportion, available\nresources that must be distributed to the recipients in whole, not fractional, parts.\nThe apportionment problem applies to many aspects of life, including the representatives in the Imaginarian legislature.\nThe table below provides a short list of examples of resources that must be apportioned in whole parts, and the\nrecipients of those resources.\nResource Recipients\nCovid-19 Vaccines Nations around the world\nAirport Terminals Airlines\nFaculty Positions at a University Departments\nPublic Schools Communities 1180 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nResource Recipients\nU.S. House of Representatives Seats States\nParliamentary Seats Political Parties\nFair division of a resource is not necessarily equal division of the resource like when distributing cake slices. When\ndistributing airport terminals amongst airlines, there are many factors to consider such as the size of the airline, the\nnumber and types of aircraft they have, and the demand for the service. In most cases, fairness is defined as being\nproportional; two quantities are proportional if they have the same relative size. In the case of the Covid-19 vaccine, the\nexpectation would be that countries with larger populations get more doses of the vaccine. In the Imaginarian\nlegislature, the expectation may be that the states with larger populations will receive the larger number of\nrepresentatives. This concept is referred to as apart-to-part ratio.\nSuppose that a supermarket has a special on pies, two for $5. The first customer purchases four pies for $10, and the\nsecond customer purchases eight pies for $20. The dollar to pie ratio for the first customer is\nand the dollar to pie ratio for the second customer is . So,\nthe dollar to pie ratio is constant. Although the customers do not spend the same amount of money, the amount each\nspent was proportional to the number of pies purchased.\nNow suppose that the supermarket changed the special to $5 for the first pie, and $2 for each additional pie. In that\ncase, four pies would cost , while 8 pies would cost . The dollar to pie ratios would be\nand , respectively. This special does not result in a\nconstant part to part ratio. The dollars spent are not proportional to the number of pies purchased.\nVIDEO\nWhat Is a Ratio?(https://openstax.org/r/ratios_proportions)\nWhat Are the Different Types of Ratios?(https://openstax.org/r/ratio_types)\nEXAMPLE11.24\nRatio of Faculty to Students at a College\nThe following table provides a comparison of the number of faculty members in each department at a particular college\nto the student head count in that department and the number of class sections in that department in the Spring\nsemester.

Find the part to part ratio of pencils to desks for each room. Represent it as both a reduced fraction and a\ndecimal rounded to the nearest hundredth as needed.\n3. Have the pencils been distributed proportionally? If so, what is the constant ratio of pencils to desks? Give the\nunits.\nThere are some useful relationships between quantities that are proportional to each other. When there is a constant\nratio between two quantities, the one quantity can be found by multiplying the other by that ratio. Remember the\nsupermarket special on pies, 2 pies for $5? The ratio of dollars to pies is and the ratio of\npies to dollars is . These two values are reciprocals of each other, and .\nThis means that multiplying by one has the same effect as dividing by the other. This also means that knowing either\nconstant ratio allows us to calculate the price given the number of pies. To find the cost of 20 pies, multiply by the ratio\nof dollars to pies or divide by the ratio of pies to dollars.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nThese patterns are true in general. 1182 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nFORMULA\nLet be a particular item and another such that there is a constant ratio of to\n\u2022 and\n\u2022\n\u2022\nEXAMPLE11.25\nRatio of Faculty to Students at a College\nRefer to the information given inExample 11.24.\n1. If there are 32 class sections each semester in the Fine Art department, and the same ratio is used to determine the\nnumber of faculty members, how many faculty members would you expect to see in the Fine Art department?\n2. If the Health Sciences department has 6 full-time faculty members, how many part-time faculty members are in the\ndepartment?\nSolution\n1. Multiply the number of class sections by the ratio of faculty members per class section to find the number of faculty.\nSince there are 4 faculty members per class, the number of faculty members in 32 classes should be\nfaculty members.\n2. Multiply the number of full-time faculty by the ratio of part-time to full-time to find the number of part-time. Since\nratio of full-time faculty to part-time faculty at the college is or 1 full-time per 2 part time, the ratio of part-time to\nfull-time is part-time to 1 full-time; so the number of part-time faculty in a department with 6 full-time faculty\nshould be part-time faculty.\nYOUR TURN11.25\nRefer again to the table providing information on classroom capacities and pencil distribution.\nRoom Number B C D E\nRoom Capacity (number of student desks) 24 18 32 22\nNumber of Pencils 36 27 48 33\n1.

Just like the five children sharing 16 Ring Pops\u2122, there are\ngoing to be leftovers and there are many methods for deciding what to do with those leftovers.\nThe Standard Divisor\nThere are two houses of congress in the United States: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state has two\nsenators, but the number of representatives depends on the population of the state. The number of representative seats\nin the U.S. House of Representatives is currently set by law to be 435. In order to distribute the seats fairly to each state,\nthe ratio of the population of the U.S. to the number of representative seats must be calculated. The ratio of the total\npopulation to the house size is called thestandard divisor, and it is the number of members of the total population\nrepresented by one seat.\nAlthough apportionment applies to many other scenarios, such as the pencil distribution during the SAT, the terminology\nof apportionment is based on the House of Representatives scenario. Thus, several government-related terms take on a\nmore general meaning. Thestatesare the recipients of the apportioned resource, theseatsare the units of the\nresource being apportioned, thehouse sizeis the total number of seats to be apportioned, thestate populationis the\nmeasurement of the state's size, and thetotal populationis the sum of the state populations.\nFORMULA\nEXAMPLE11.27\nThe Standard Divisor of the U.S. House of Representatives 2021\nAs of this writing, the Census.gov website U.S. Population clock showed a population of 332,693,997.

This would mean that\neach member of the population is allocated their own personal seat.\n\u2022 The standard divisor will be a number between 0 and 1 when the total population is less than the number of seats.\nThis means that each member of the population is allocated more than one seat.\n\u2022 The standard divisor will be a number greater than 1when the total population is greater than the number of seats.\nThis means that a certain number of members of the population will share 1 seat.\nIf the population is five children and the house consists of five pieces of candy, the standard divisor is\nmeaning each child gets one candy. If the population is five children and ten pieces of\ncandy, the standard divisor is meaning that each child gets more than one candy.

Identify the states, seats, house size, state population, and total population in this apportionment scenario.\n2. Describe the ratio the standard divisor represents in this scenario and calculate the standard divisor to the nearest\ntenth.\nSolution\n1. The states are the schools in that county. The seats are the school resource officers. The house size is the number of\nschool resource officers, which is 349. The state population is the number of students in a particular school, which\nwas not given. The total population consists of the sum of the school populations, which is 271,500.\n2. The standard divisor is the ratio of the total population to the house size, which is the number of students served by\neach resource officer. Divide students per officer.\nYOUR TURN11.28\nThe Hernandez family and the Higgins family went trick-or-treating together for Halloween last year.

Identify the states, seats, house size, state population, and total population in this apportionment scenario.\n2. Describe the ratio the standard divisor represents in this scenario and calculate the standard divisor to four\ndecimal places.\nThe Standard Quota\nOnce the standard divisor for the Imaginarian legislature is calculated, the next task is to determine the number of seats\nthat each state should receive, which is referred to as the state\u2019sstandard quota. Unless all the states have the same\npopulation, each state will receive a different number of seats because the quantities will be proportionate to the state\npopulations. To determine those amounts, we will use an idea we learned earlier. Recall that, when the number of units 1186 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nof item is proportionate to the number of units of item , we have:\nIn this case, we are trying to calculate the number of seats a state should be apportioned, the state\u2019s standard quota.

Identify and contrast flaws in various apportionment methods.\nA Closer Look at the Apportionment Problem\nInStandard Divisors, Standard Quotas, and the Apportionment Problemwe calculated the standard divisor and the\nstandard quotas in various apportionment scenarios. The results of those calculations routinely led to fractions and\ndecimals of units. However, the seats in the House of Representatives, laptops in a classroom, or a variety of other\nresources, are indivisible, meaning they cannot be divided up into fractional parts. This leaves a decision to be made. For\nexample, if the standard quota for the number of laptops to be distributed to a classroom is 12.44 units, how do we deal\nwith the fractional part of 0.44? It is unclear if the classroom should receive 12 units, 13 units, or some other value. Let\u2019s\ntry traditional rounding to the nearest whole number value.\nEXAMPLE11.31\nInstalling Emergency Lights\nThe board of trustees of a college has recently approved the installation of 70 new emergency blue lights in three\nparking lots. The number of lights in each lot will be proportionate to the size of the parking lot, which isto be measured\nin acres. The total number of acres is 34; so the standard divisor is .

Does the sum found in part 2 equal the number of lights available?\nSolution\n1. If traditional rounding is used, there will be 31, 19, and 21 lights distributed to each lot, respectively.\n2. The total of these values is 71.\n3. No, the total from part 2 is one more than the number of lights available. In other words, one of the parking lots\nmust get 1 fewer light than apportioned.\nYOUR TURN11.31\nThe science department of a high school has received a grant for 34 laptops.

Does the sum found in part 2 equal the number of laptops available?\nExample 11.31demonstrates that we cannot successfully apportion indivisible resources by rounding off each standard\nquota using traditional rounding. This leaves us with a problem. What is a fair way to distribute the fractional parts of the\nstandard quotas? We will refer to this as theapportionment problem. Several methods for making this decision will be\ndiscussed.\nEXAMPLE11.32\nA-10C Thunderbolt II Aircraft\nIn 2015, the U.S. Air Force had a fleet of approximately 281 A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft.

This example demonstrates the apportionment problem because it is not possible to send a fractional number of\naircraft to an Air Force base. On the other hand, if we use traditional rounding methods to get whole numbers, the\nresults are aircraft will be apportioned, which is one less than the number of aircraft that\nwere supposed to beapportioned.\nYOUR TURN11.32\n1. The reading coach at an elementary school has 13 gift cards to distribute to their three students as a reward for\ntime spent reading. When they calculated the standard quota for each student based on the number of minutes\nthey student had read, the results were: 4.49 gift cards, 4.03 gift cards, and 4.48 gift cards. How does this\ndemonstrate the apportionment problem?\nHamilton's Method of Apportionment\nOne of the problems encountered when standard quotas are transformed into whole numbers using traditional\nrounding is that it is possible for the sum of the values to be greater than the number of seats available. A reasonable\nway to avoid this is to always round down, even when the first decimal place is five or greater. For example, a standard\nquota of 12.33 and a standard quota of 12.99 would both round down to 12. This is called thelower quota.\nEXAMPLE11.33\nLower Quota for Apportionment of Aircraft\nThe Air Force administration wants to distribute 27 aircrafts across six bases based on the number of qualified pilots\nstationed at those bases.

Give the lower quota for each Air Force base.\n2. Find the sum of the lower quotas. By how much does this sum fall short of the actual number of aircraft?\nSolution\n1. Round down. The lower quota for each Air Force base is 5, 5, 2, 6, 3, 3, respectively.\n2. The sum is 24. This is 3 fewer than the actual number of aircraft.\nYOUR TURN11.33\nThe apportionment of 70 new emergency blue lights in three parking lots is based on acreage.

By how much does this sum fall short of the actual number of emergency lights?\nIf the standard quotas are all rounded down, their sum will always be less than or equal to the house size. Then, it would\nonly remain to find a fair way to distribute any remaining seats. Alexander Hamilton, who was a general in the American\nRevolution, author of the Federalist Papers, and the first secretary of the treasury, took this approach to apportionment.\nSteps for Hamilton\u2019s Method of Apportionment\nThere are five steps we follow when applying Hamilton\u2019s Method of apportionment:\n1. Find the standard divisor.\n2. Find each state\u2019s standard quota.\n3. Give each state the state\u2019s lower quota (with each state receiving at least 1 seat).\n4.

The value that results from rounding down is called the lower\nquota, and the value that results from rounding up is called theupper quota.\nAs we explore more methods of apportionment, we will consider whether they satisfy the quota rule.

Apportionment Method V has been used to allocate 125 seats to ten states as shown in the table below.\nDetermine whether the apportionment satisfies the quota rule and justify your answer.\nState A State B State C State D State E State F State G\nStandard Quota41.26 10.70 16.00 13.11 17.00 5.77 2.64\nLower Quota 41 10 16 13 17 5 2\nUpper Quota 42 11 17 14 18 6 3\nMethod V 42 11 17 13 18 4 2\nIt is possible for an apportionment method to satisfy the quota rule in some scenarios but violate it in others. However,\nbecause the Hamilton method always begins with the lower quota and either adds one to it or keeps it the same, the\nfinal Hamilton quota will always consist of values that are either lower quota values or upper quota values. When an\napportionment method has this characteristic, it is said to satisfy the quota rule. So, we can say:\nThe Hamilton method of apportionment satisfies the quota rule.\nAlthough the Hamilton method of apportionment satisfies the quota rule, it can result in some unexpected outcomes,\nwhich has caused it to pass in and out of favor of the U.S. government over the years. There are several apportionment\nmethods that have been popular alternatives, such as Jefferson\u2019s method of apportionment that the founders of\nImaginaria should consider.\nJefferson\u2019s Method of Apportionment\nAnother approach to dealing with the fractional parts of the standard quotas is to modify the standard divisor so that the\ntotal of the resulting modified lower quotas is the necessary number of seats. This is the approach used by Jefferson.\nIn Jefferson\u2019s method, the change to the standard divisor is made so that the total of the modified lower quotas equals\nthe house size. The change in the standard divisor to get the modified divisor is relatively small. There is not a formula\nfor this. The modified divisor is found by \u201cguess and check.\u201d It is important to remember thatincreasingthe divisor\ndecreasesthe quotas, butdecreasingthe divisorincreasesthe quotas. So, if you need a larger quota, try reducing the\ndivisor, and if you need a smaller quota, try increasing the divisor.\nEXAMPLE11.36\nModifying a Standard Divisor\nSuppose the population of a state is 50 and the standard divisor is 12.5.\n1. Find the state\u2019s standard quota.\n2. Increase the standard divisor by 2 units and use the modified divisor to determine the modified quota for the state.\n3. Decrease the modified divisor from part 2 by 1.5 units and use the new modified divisor to determine the modified\nquota for the state.\n4. Choose any value of divisor between the value of the modified divisor from part 2 and the value of the modified\ndivisor from part 3 and use it to determine the modified quota for the state.\n5. Which modified quota was the largest, the modified quota from part 2, from part 3, or from part 4? Explain why.\nSolution\n1. The state\u2019s standard quota is .\n2. The modified divisor is 14.5. The modified quota is .\n3. The modified divisor is 13. The modified quota is .\n4. One value between 13 and 14.5 is 13.5. With a modified divisor of 13.5, the modified quota is .\n5. The modified quota from part 3 was the largest because the divisor was the smallest of the three. Dividing the same 1198 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nnumber by a smaller value gives a larger result.\nYOUR TURN11.36\nSuppose the population of a state is 12 and the standard divisor is 0.225.\n1. Find the state\u2019s standard quota.\n2. Decrease the standard divisor by 0.200 units and use the modified divisor to determine the modified quota\nfor the state.\n3. Increase the modified divisor from part 2 by 0.100 units and use the new modified divisor to determine the\nmodified quota for the state.\n4. Choose any value of divisor between the value of the modified divisor from part 2 and the value of the\nmodified divisor from part 3 and use it to determine the modified quota for the state.\n5. Which modified quota was the smallest, the modified quota from part 2, from part 3, or from part 4? Explain\nwhy.\nWhen you use Jefferson\u2019s method, you might have to adjust the divisor several times find modified lower quotas that\nsum to the house size. First, guess what the divisor should be based on the sum of the lower quotas and then increase\nor decrease it from there based on whether the sum needs to be smaller or larger respectively. If the result still does not\nproduce lower quotas that sum to the house size, adjust again. Keep a record of the values that didn't work to help you\nnarrow your search.\nSteps for Jefferson\u2019s Method of Apportionment\nWe take four steps to apply Jefferson\u2019s Method of apportionment:\nStep 1:Find the standard divisor.\nStep 2:Find each state\u2019s quota. This will be the standard quota the first time Step 2 is completed and the standard\ndivisor is used, but Step 2 may be repeated as needed using a modified divisor and resulting in modified quotas.\nStep 3:Find the states\u2019 lower quotas (with each state receiving at least one seat), and their sum.\nStep 4:If the sum from Step 3 equals the number of seats, the apportionment is complete. If the sum of the lower\nquotas is less than the number of seats, reduce the standard divisor. If the sum of the lower quotas is greater than the\nnumber of seats, increase the standard divisor. Return to Step 2 using the modified divisor.\nEXAMPLE11.37\nHawaiian State Representative Districts\nSuppose that the Hawaii State Department of Education has a budget for 616 schools and is doing a research study to\ndetermine the equitable number of schools to have in each of five counties based on the residents under the age of 19.\nWith the data in the table below, apply Jefferson\u2019s method to apportion the schools to the counties.\nHawaii Honolulu Kalawao Kauai Maui Total\nResidents under Age 19 46,310 224,230 20 16,560 38,450 325,570\nSolution\nStep 1:The process for finding the standard divisor, standard quotas, and lower quotas is the same in the Hamilton and\nJefferson methods of apportionment.

Since 615 is less than 616, use a\nmodified divisor that is less than the standard divisor of 528.52. Try 526.00.\nStep 3:Find each state\u2019s modified quota, lower quota, and the sum of the lower quotas based on the modified divisor of\n526:\nHawaii Honolulu Kalawao Kauai Maui Total\nModified 616\nQuota\nLower Quota 88 426 1 31 72 618\nStep 4:The new sum of the lower quotas is 2 units greater than 616. We have overshot the goal. So, increase the divisor\nto a value between 526.00 and 528.52. Try 527.00.\nStep 5:Repeat the process of finding the quotas.

The apportionment is complete.\nThe apportionment is: Hawaii County 87, Honolulu County 425, Kalawao County 1, Kauai 31, and Maui 72 schools.\nWhen using Jefferson\u2019s method, the modified divisors you use may be different from what another person chooses, but\nfinal apportionment values will be the same. 1200 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nYOUR TURN11.37\n1.

Yes, the Hamilton and Webster methods result in the same apportionment.\n2. The largest county is Honolulu. The citizens would likely favor the Jefferson method of apportionment most since\nthey received the most seats by that method. They would likely favor the Adams method of apportionment least\nbecause they received the least number of seats by that method.\n3. As a group, the other four counties received 192 seats by either the Hamilton or Webster method, 194 seats by the\nAdams method, and 191 seats by the Jefferson method. They would likely favor the Adams method the most and\nfavor the Jefferson methods the least.\nYOUR TURN11.40\nIn Your Turn 11.34, 11.37, 11.38, and 11.39, you apportioned 35 legislative seats among the four states of Imaginaria\nusing the Hamilton, Jefferson, Adams, and Webster methods of apportionment. To understand how the differences\nin the apportionments might affect Imaginarians, answer these questions.\n1. Which apportionment method would the citizens of the largest state likely favor most and least? Justify your\nanswer.\n2. As a group, which apportionment method would the citizens of the other three states likely favor most and 1206 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nleast? Justify your answer.\nThe Adams method favored the smaller states and the Jefferson method favored the larger states in the previous\nexample, but is this the case in general?\nSince the Jefferson method begins with the lower quotas, any adjustment to the quotas will be an increase. As you have\nseen, this is accomplished by using a modified divisor that is smaller than the standard divisor. The next example\ncompares the impact of a decreasing divisor on the modified quotas of large states to the impact of the same size\ndecrease on small states.\nEXAMPLE11.41\nEffect of Decreasing Divisors on Modified Quotas\nThe following table displays the effect of reducing the size of the divisor. Observe the effect this has on the modified\nquotas of smaller states versus larger states and use the table answer each question.\nModified Quotas\nState Population Divisor: 10,500 Divisor: 10,000 Divisor: 9,500\nA 10,000 0.95 1 1.05\nB 100,000 9.52 10 10.53\nC 1,000,000 95.24 100 105.26\n1. When the divisor decreases from 10,500 to 10,000, how many representatives are gained by each state based on the\nlower quota?\n2. When the divisor decreases from 10,000 to 9,500, how many representatives are gained by each state based on the\nlower quota?\n3. Which state gains the most representatives each time the divisor is decreased?\nSolution\n1. Since a state must have at least one seat, State A begins with 1 seat and still has one seat. State B begins with 9\nseats and increases to 10 seats. State C begins with 95 seats and increases to 100 seats. So, State A gains 0, B gains\n1, and C gains 5 seats.\n2. State A begins with 1 and still has 1. State B begins with 10 and still has 10. State C begins with 100 and increases to\n105. So, State A gains 0, State B gains 0, and State C gains 5.\n3. State C, the largest state, gains the most representatives each time the divisor is decreased.\nThis example demonstrates that the Jefferson method is biased toward states with larger populations because the\nmodified divisor is smaller than the standard divisor. On the other hand, the Adams\u2019s method, which begins with the\nupper quotas, must increase the standard divisor in order to reduce the quotas. Once again, the effect on the number of\nseats is greater for the larger states, but this time they are decreased. This means that the Adams\u2019s method favors states\nwith smaller populations.\nYOUR TURN11.41\nThe following table displays the effect of increasing the size of the divisor. Observe the effect this has on the\nmodified quotas of smaller states versus larger states and use the table to answer each question.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.4 \u2022 Apportionment Methods 1207\nModified Quotas\nState Population Divisor: 11,500 Divisor: 12,000 Divisor: 12,500\nA 10,000 0.87 0.83 0.8\nB 100,000 8.7 8.33 8\nC 1,000,000 86.96 83.33 80\n1. When the divisor increases from 11,500 to 12,000, how many representatives are lost by each state based on\nthe upper quota?\n2. When the divisor increases from 12,000 to 12,500, how many representatives are lost by each state based on\nthe upper quota?\n3. Which state loses the most representatives each time the divisor is increased?\nFlaws in Apportionment Methods\nAs we have seen, different apportionment methods can have the same results in some scenarios but different results in\nothers. Citizens of states which receive fewer seats with a particular apportionment method will view the apportionment\nmethod as flawed and argue in favor of a different method. This inevitably creates debates regarding the use of one\nmethod over another. Methods that favor larger states are likely to be challenged by smaller states, methods that favor\nsmaller states are likely to be challenged by larger states, and methods that violate the quota rule are likely to be\nchallenged by states of any size depending on the circumstances.\nSuppose that the State of Hawaii House of Representatives had 51 representatives, each with their own district. Imagine\nthat redistricting were underway, and the representative districts were to be apportioned to each of five counties based\non population. The following table shows the apportionment that would result from the use of the Jefferson, Adams, and\nWebster methods of apportionment.\nHawaii Honolulu Kalawao Kauai Maui\nPopulation 201,500 974,600 100 72,300 167,400\nLower Quota 7 35 0 2 6\nUpper Quota 8 36 1 3 7\nJefferson 7 35 1 2 6\nAdams 7 34 1 3 6\nWebster 7 34 1 3 6\nFrom the table, you can see that Hawaii, Kalawao, and Maui receive the same number of seats regardless of the method\nused. However, citizens of Honolulu would likely reject the Adams and Webster methods arguing that they violate the\nquota rule. Similarly, citizens of Kauai would probably reject the Jefferson method based on the argument that it unfairly\nfavors the larger states. This scenario demonstrates that the Adams and Webster methods violate the quota rule, but the\nJefferson method also violates the quota rule at times.The Hamilton method is the only method that satisfies the\nquota rule in all scenarios.It also consistently favors neither larger nor smaller states.

In example above, we imagined that there were 51 state legislators in Hawaii, each representing\ntheir own district. But how did the legislators decide on the boundaries for these districts? Typically, boundaries are\ndrawn so that each district has approximately the same number of residents, but the percentage of residents in each\ndistrict with a particular political affiliation can swing the power from one group to another. When the districts are\ndrawn to impact the power of a political party, ethnic or racial group, or other group, this is called gerrymandering.\nFor example, districts can be drawn so that a particular group is spread thinly across districts, increasing the\nlikelihood that they will not have strong representation.\nFigure11.17This cartoon map conveys the idea that the drawing of the map may impact election outcomes.

Describe and illustrate the Alabama paradox.\n2. Describe and illustrate the population paradox.\n3. Describe and illustrate the new-states paradox.\n4. Identify ways to promote fairness in apportionment methods.\nApportionment Paradoxes\nThe citizens of Imaginaria will want the apportionment method to be as fair as possible. There are certain characteristics\nthat they would reasonably expect from a fair apportionment.\n\u2022 If the house size is increased, the state quotas should all increase or remain the same but never decrease.\n\u2022 If one state\u2019s population is growing more rapidly than another state\u2019s population, the faster growing state should\nnot lose a seat while a slower growing state maintains or gains a seat.\n\u2022 If there is a fixed number of seats, adding a new state should not cause an existing state to gain seats while others\nlose them.\nHowever, apportionment methods are known to contradict these expectations. Before you decide on the right\napportionment for Imaginarians, let\u2019s explore theapportionment paradox, a situation that occurs when an\napportionment method produces results that seem to contradict reasonable expectations of fairness.\nThere is a lot that the founders of Imaginaria can learn from U.S. history. The constitution of the United States requires\nthat the seats in the House of Representatives be apportioned according to the results of the census that occurs every\ndecade, but the number of seats and the apportionment method is not stipulated. Over the years, several different\napportionment methods and house sizes have been used and scrutinized for fairness. This scrutiny has led to the\ndiscovery of several of these apportionment paradoxes.\nThe Alabama Paradox\nAt the time of the 1880 U.S. Census, the Hamilton method of apportionment had replaced the Jefferson method. The\nnumber of seats in the House of Representatives was not fixed. To achieve the fairest apportionment possible, the house\nsizes were chosen so that the Hamilton and Webster methods would result in the same apportionment. The chief clerk of\nthe Census Bureau calculated the apportionments for house sizes between 275 and 350. There was a surprising result\nthat became known as theAlabama paradox, which is said to occur when an increase in house size reduces a state\u2019s\nquota. Alabama would receive eight seats with a house size of 299, but only receive seven seats if the house size\nincreased to 300. (Michael J. Caulfield (Gannon University), \"Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress -\nParadoxes of Apportionment,\"Convergence(November 2010), DOI:10.4169/loci003163)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.5 \u2022 Fairness in Apportionment Methods 1213\nEXAMPLE11.42\nThe 1880 Alabama Quota\nThe 1880 census recorded the population of Alabama as 1,513,401 and that of the U.S. as 62,979,766.\n1. Calculate the standard divisor and standard quota for the State of Alabama based on a house size of 299.\n2. Calculate the standard divisor and standard quota for the State of Alabama based on a house size of 300.\n3. Did the standard quota increase or decrease when the house size increased?\n4. Consider the Hamilton method of apportionment. Explain how Alabama\u2019s final quota could be smaller with a larger\nstandard quota.\nSolution\n1. The standard divisor is citizens per seat. The standard quota for\nAlabama is seats.\n2. The standard divisor is citizens per seat. The standard quota for\nAlabama is seats.\n3. The standard quota increased.\n4. In each case, the state would receive the lower quota of 7 and then be awarded one more seat if the fractional part\nof the standard quota were high enough relative to the fractional parts of the other states\u2019 standard quotas. When\nthe house size was 299, Alabama received one of the remaining seats after the lower quotas were distributed. When\nthe house size was 300, Alabama did not receive one of the remaining seats after the lower quotas were distributed.\nIt must have been the case that either the fractional part 0.2090 ranked lower amongst the other fractional parts of\nthe state quotas than the fractional part 0.1850 did, or there were fewer remaining seats, or both.\nAfter the 1900 census, the Census Bureau again calculated the apportionment based on various house sizes. It was\ndetermined that Colorado would receive three seats with a house size of 356, but only two seats with a house size of 357.\nYOUR TURN11.42\nThe 1900 census recorded the population of Colorado as 539,700 and that of the U.S. as 76,212,168.\n1. Calculate the standard divisor and standard quota for the State of Colorado based on a house size of 356.\n2. Calculate the standard divisor and standard quota for the State of Colorado based on a house size of 357.\n3. Did the standard quota increase or decrease when the house size increased?\n4. Consider the Hamilton method of apportionment. Explain how Colorado\u2019s final quota could be smaller with a\nlarger standard quota.\nEXAMPLE11.43\nHamilton\u2019s Method and the Alabama Paradox\nSuppose that States A and B each have a population of 6, while State C has a population of 2.\n1. Use the Hamilton method to apportion 10 seats.\n2. Use the Hamilton method to apportion 11 seats.\n3. Does this example demonstrate the Alabama paradox? If so, how?\nSolution\n1. Step 1:The total population is 14. The standard divisor is individuals per seat.\nStep 2:The states\u2019 standard quotas are as follows: A , B , and C\nStep 3:The states\u2019 lower quotas are as follows: A 4, B 4, and C 1.\nStep 4:The sum of the lower quotas is 9, which means there is one seat remaining to be apportioned. State C has\nthe highest fractional part and receives the additional seat.\nStep 5:The final apportionment is as follows: A 4, B 4, and C 2, which sums to 10.\n2. Step 1:The total population is 14. The standard divisor is individuals per seat. 1214 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nStep 2:The states\u2019 standard quotas are: A , B , and C .\nStep 3:The states\u2019 lower quotas are: A 4, B 4, and C 1.\nStep 4:The sum of the lower quotas is 9, which means there are two seats remaining to be apportioned. A and B\nhave the highest fractional parts and receive the additional seats.\nStep 5:The final apportionment is: A 5, B 5, and C 1.\n3. Yes, this demonstrates the Alabama paradox because State C receives two seats if the house size is 10, but only one\nseat if the house size is 11.\nYOUR TURN11.43\nSuppose that the founders of Imaginaria decide to have a parliament that apportions seats to four political parties\nbased on the portion of the vote each party has earned. Also, suppose that Party A has 56.7 thousand votes, Party B\nhas 38.5 thousand votes, Party C has 4.2 thousand votes, and Party D has 0.6 thousand votes.\n1. Use the Hamilton method to apportion 323 seats.\n2. Use the Hamilton method to apportion 324 seats.\n3. Does this example demonstrate the Alabama paradox? If so, how?\nThe Population Paradox\nIt is important for the founders of Imaginaria to keep in mind that the populations of states change as time passes.\nSome populations grow and some shrink. Some populations increase by a large amount while others increase by a small\namount. These changes may necessitate areapportionmentof seats, or the recalculation of state quotas due to a\nchange in population. It would be reasonable for Imaginarians to expect that the state with a population that has grown\nmore than others will gain a seat before the other states. Once again, this is not always the case with the Hamilton\nmethod of apportionment. Thepopulation growth rateof a state is the ratio of the change in the population to the\noriginal size of the population, often expressed as a percentage. This value is positive if the population is increasing and\nnegative if the population is decreasing. Thepopulation paradoxoccurs when a state with an increasing population\nloses a seat while a state with a decreasing population either retains or gains seats. More generally, the population\nparadox occurs when a state with a higher population growth rate loses seats while a state with a lower population\ngrowth rate retains or gains seats.\nNotice that the population paradox definitions has two parts. If either part applies, then the population paradox has\noccurred. The first part of the definition only applies when one state has a decreasing population. The second part of the\ndefinition applies in all situations, whether there is a state with a decreasing population or not. It will be easier to identify\nsituations that involve a decreasing population. The other situations requires the calculation of a growth rate. The reason\nthat we don't have to calculate a growth rate when one state has a decreasing population and the other has an\nincreasing population is that increasing population has a positive growth rate which is always greater than the negative\ngrowth rate of a decreasing population.\nA state must lose a seat in order for the population paradox to apply. It is not enough for a state with a lower\ngrowth rate to gain a seat while a state with a higher growth rate retains the same number of seats.\nEXAMPLE11.44\nApportionment of Respirators to Hospitals\nSuppose that 18 respirators are to be apportioned to three hospitals based on their capacities.

There are 38 seats in the Congress of Costaguana. The\napportionment of the seats is determined by Hamilton\u2019s method to be: 19 for Azuera, 15 for Punta Mala, and 4 for\nEsmerelda. A census reveals that the population has grown and the seats must be reapportioned. If Azuera now has\n953,000 residents, Punta Mala now has 706,000 residents, and Esmerelda now has 218,000 residents, how many seats 1216 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nwill each state receive upon reapportionment? How is this an example of the population paradox?\nSolution\nThe Hamilton reapportionment is: 19 for Azuera, 14 for Punta Mala, and 5 for Esmerelda. This is an example of the\npopulation paradox because Punta Mala lost a seat to Esmerelda, even though Punta Mala\u2019s population grew by 1.44\npercent while Esmerelda\u2019s only grew by 1.40 percent.\nYOUR TURN11.45\n1. The country of Elbonia has three states: Mudston with a population of 866,000; WallaWalla with a population of\n626,000; and Dilberta with a population of 256,000. There are 38 seats in the Congress of Elbonia. The\napportionment of the seats is determined by Hamilton\u2019s method to be: 19 for Mudston, 14 for WallaWalla, and 5\nfor Dilberta. A census reveals that the population has grown and the seats must be reapportioned. If Mudston\nnow has 921,000 residents, WallaWalla now has 640,000 residents, and Dilberta now has 260,000 residents, how\nmany seats will each state receive upon reapportionment? How is this an example of the population paradox?\nThe New-States Paradox\nAs a founder of Imaginaria, you might also consider the possibility that Imaginaria could annex nearby lands and\nincrease the number of states. This occurred several times in the United States such as when Oklahoma became a state\nin 1907. The House size was increased from 386 to 391 to accommodate Oklahoma\u2019s quota of five seats. When the seats\nwere reapportioned using Hamilton\u2019s method, New York lost a seat to Maine despite the fact that their populations had\nnot changed. This is an example of thenew-state paradox, which occurs when the addition of a new state is\naccompanied by an increase in seats to maintain the standard ratio of population to seats, but one of the existing states\nloses a seat in the resulting reapportionment.\nEXAMPLE11.46\nNew State of Oscuridad\nThe country of San Lorenzo has grown from two states to three.

The constitution of Gulliversia requires that the 90 congressional seats be apportioned by Hamilton\u2019s method.\nLilliput has received 38 seats while Brobdingnag has received 52 seats. Recently, the island of Houyhnhnmsland with a\npopulation of 170,000 has joined the union, becoming a state of Gulliversia. When Houyhnhnmsland is included, nine\nadditional seats must be apportioned to maintain the same ratio of seats to citizens. Use Hamilton\u2019s method to\nreapportion the 99 seats to the three states. How is the resulting apportionment an example of the new-states paradox?\nSolution\nThe reapportionment gives 39 seats to Lilliput, 51 seats to Brobdingnag, and 9 seats to Houyhnhnmsland. This is an\nexample of the new-states paradox because the original state of Brobdingnag lost a seat to the original state of Lilliput\nwhen the new state was added to the union.\nYOUR TURN11.47\n1.

The constitution of Neverland requires that the 84 congressional seats be apportioned by\nHamilton\u2019s method. Neverwood has received 37 seats while Mermaids Lagoon has received 47 seats. Recently,\nthe island of Marooners Rock with a population of 190,000 has joined the union, becoming a state of Neverland.\nWhen Marooners Rock is included, nine additional seats must be apportioned to maintain the same ratio of seats\nto citizens. Use Hamilton\u2019s method to reapportion the 93 seats to the three states. How is the resulting\napportionment an example of the new-states paradox?\nWhen a new state is added, it is necessary to determine the amount that the house size must be increased to retain the\noriginal ratio of population to seats, in other words to keep the original standard divisor. To calculate the new house size,\ndivide the new population by the original standard divisor, and round to the nearest whole number.\nFORMULA 1218 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nEXAMPLE11.48\nOklahoma Joins the Union\nOklahoma was admitted as the 46th state on November 16, 1907. Before Oklahoma joined the union, the U.S. population\nwas approximately 75,030,000 and the House of Representatives had 386 seats. The new state had a population of\napproximately 970,000. Use this information to estimate the original standard divisor to the nearest hundred, the new\npopulation, the new house size, and the number of seats Oklahoma should receive.\nSolution\nStep 1:\nStep 2:New Population\nStep 3:\nStep 4:There are new seats to be apportioned to Oklahoma.\nYOUR TURN11.48\n1. New Mexico was admitted as the 47th state on January 6, 1912. Before New Mexico joined the union, the U.S.\npopulation was approximately 76,000,000 and the House of Representatives had 391 seats. The new state had a\npopulation of approximately 300,000. Use this information to estimate the original standard divisor to the\nnearest hundred, the new population, the new house size, and the number of seats New Mexico should receive.\nThe Search for the Perfect Apportionment Method\nThe ideal apportionment method would simultaneously satisfy the following four fairness criteria.\n\u2022 Satisfy the quota rule\n\u2022 Avoid the Alabama paradox\n\u2022 Avoid the population paradox\n\u2022 Avoid the new-states paradox\nWe have seen that the Hamilton method allows the Alabama paradox, the population paradox, and the new-states\nparadox in some apportionment scenarios. Let\u2019s explore the results of the other methods of apportionment we have\ndiscussed in some of the same scenarios.\nEXAMPLE11.49\nOrange Grove and the New-States Paradox\nThe incorporated town of Orange Grove consists of two subdivisions: The Oaks with 1,254 residents and The Villages\nwith 10,746 residents. A council with 100 members supervises the municipality\u2019s operations. The council votes to annex\nan unincorporated subdivision called The Lakes with a population of 630. They plan to increase the size of the council to\nmaintain the ratio of seats to residents such that the new council will have 100 seats plus the number of seats given to\nThe Lakes. Use each of the following apportionment methods and indicated number of additional seats to find the\noriginal and new apportionment and determine whether the new-state paradox occurs.\n1. Jefferson\u2019s method with five additional seats.\n2. Adams\u2019s method with six additional seats.\n3. Webster\u2019s method with five additional seats\nSolution\n1. Using a modified divisor of 119, the original apportionment would have been: The Oaks 10 and The Villages 90.\nUsing a modified divisor of 119, the new apportionment would be: The Oaks 10, The Villages 90, and The Lakes 5.\nThe new-state paradox does not occur.\n2. Using a modified divisor of 121, the original apportionment would have been: The Oaks 11 and The Villages 89.\nUsing a modified divisor of 121, the new apportionment would be: The Oaks 11, The Villages 89, and The Lakes 6.\nThe new-state paradox does not occur.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.5 \u2022 Fairness in Apportionment Methods 1219\n3. Using the standard divisor of 120, the original apportionment would have been: The Oaks 10 and The Villages 90.\nUsing a modified divisor of 119.5, the new apportionment would be: The Oaks 10, The Villages 90, and The Lakes 5.\nThe new-state paradox does not occur.\nYOUR TURN11.49\n1. Suppose that in 2016, States A, B, and C had populations of 13 million, 12 million, and 112 million, respectively. In\n2020, State A has grown by 1 million residents, State B has lost 1 million residents, and State C has gained 2\nmillion residents. Compare the apportionments in 2016 to 2020 using each method given below. Which of the\nfour methods violate(s) the population paradox in this scenario?\nWe have seen in our examples that neither the population paradox nor the new-states paradox occurred when using the\nJefferson, Adams, and Webster methods. It turns out that, although all three of these divisor methods violate the quota\nrule, none of them ever causes the population paradox, new-states paradox, or even the Alabama paradox. On the other\nhand, the Hamilton method satisfies the quota rule, but will cause the population paradox, the new-states paradox, and\nthe Alabama paradox in some scenarios.\nIn 1983, mathematicians Michel Balinski and Peyton Young proved that no method of apportionment can simultaneously\nsatisfy all four fairness criteria.\nThere are other apportionment methods that satisfy different subsets of these fairness criteria. For example, the\nmathematicians, Balinski and Young who proved the Balinski-Young Impossibility Theorem created a method that both\nsatisfies the quota rule and is free of the Alabama paradox. (Balinski, Michel L.; Young, H. Peyton (November 1974). \u201cA\nNew Method for Congressional Apportionment.\u201dProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 71 (11): 4602\u20134606.)\nHowever, no method may always follow the quota rule and simultaneously be free of the population paradox. (Balinski,\nMichel L.; Young, H. Peyton (September 1980). \"The Theory of Apportionment\" (PDF). Working Papers. International\nInstitute for Applied Systems Analysis. WP-80-131.)\nSo, as you and your fellow founders of Imaginaria make the important decision about the right apportionment method\nfor Imaginaria, do not look for a perfect apportionment method. Instead, look for an apportionment method that best\nmeets the needs and concerns of Imaginarians.\nCheck Your Understanding\nIn the following questions, a scenario is given. Determine whether the scenario is an example of a quota rule violation,\nthe Alabama paradox, the population paradox, the new-states paradox, or none of these.\n33. A city purchased five new firetrucks and apportioned them among the existing fire stations. Although your\nneighborhood fire station has the same proportion of the city\u2019s firetrucks as before the new ones were\npurchased, it now has one fewer.\n34. The school resources officers in a county were reapportioned based on the most recent census. The number of\nstudents at Chapel Run Elementary went up while the number of students at Panther Trail Elementary went\ndown. However, Chapel Run now has one fewer resources officer while Panther Trail has one more than it did\npreviously.\n35. The standard quota for States A, B, and C are 1.19, 2.73, and 5.71 respectively. State A received 1 seat, State B\nreceived 3 seats, and State C received 4 seats.\n36. A corporation that owns several hospitals purchased an additional hospital, causing the doctor to patient ratio\nto decrease.\n37. When the city of Cocoa annexed an adjacent unincorporated community, the number of seats on the city\ncouncil was increased to maintain the standard ratio of citizens to seats, but one existing community of Cocoa\nstill lost a seat on the city council to another existing community of Cocoa when the new community was\nadded.\nIn the following questions, a type of scenario is described. Indicate which paradox could arise in a scenario of this kind.\n38. A reapportionment occurs because the populations of the states change, and the house size remains the same.\n39. A reapportionment occurs because the house size increases, and the populations of the states remain the\nsame.\n40. A reapportionment occurs because an additional state is added to the union, the populations of the original\nstates remain the same, and the house size is increased to correspond to the population of the new state. 1220 11 \u2022 Voting and Apportionment\nSECTION 11.5 EXERCISES\nIn the following exercises, determine whether the scenario violates the Alabama paradox. Justify your answer.\n1. A company with an office in each of four cities must distribute 145 new Chromebooks to the four offices. It is\ndetermined that Office A will receive 42, Office B will receive 17, Office C will receive 35, and Office D will receive\n51. At the last minute, it is discovered that there are 146 Chromebooks. When they are reapportioned, Office A\nreceives 42, Office B receives 16, Office C receives 36, and Office D receives 52.\n2. A county with three towns has 30 garbage trucks to apportion. Attenborough receives 6 trucks, Breckenridge\nreceives 8 trucks, and Cabbotsville receives 16 trucks, in proportion to their populations. When one additional\ntruck is purchased, the reallocation results in 5 trucks for Attenborough, 9 for Breckenridge, and 8 for\nCabbotsville though there has been no change in populations.\n3. A group of 60 dentists work for a company that runs five offices. The dentists have been apportioned to the\noffices by the number of patients. Office A receives 14 dentists, Office B receives 11, Office C receives 11, Office\nD receives 12, and Office E receives 12. When a new dentist joins the group, the new apportionment gives the\nfollowing: A 14, B 11, C 11, D 12, and E 13.\nIn the following exercises, determine whether the scenario violates the population paradox. Justify your answer.\n4. A company with locations in three cities plans to give 200 achievement awards that shall be apportioned to the\nthree cities by population. City A with 9,150 employees is allotted 61 awards, City B with 6,040 employees is\nallotted 40 awards, and City C with 14,810 employees is allotted 99 awards to distribute. Then it is discovered\nthat the number of employees is out of date. The awards are reallocated based on the new populations: City A\nwith 9,180; City B with 6,040; and City C with 14,930. It turns out that the apportionment remains the same.\n5. A soccer club must apportion soccer balls to the teams among four age brackets based on the number of teams\nin each bracket. Bracket U8 receives 32 balls, U12 receives 46 balls, U15 receives 29 balls, and U18 receives 25\nballs. Mid-season, the balls are reapportioned. U8 has decreased by 10 percent, U12 has increased by 20\npercent, U15 remains the same, and U18 has increased by 10 percent. The reapportionment gives 33 balls to\nU8, 46 balls to U12, 29 balls to U15, and 14 balls to U18.\n6. READ (Reading Education Assistance Dogs) trains and certifies therapy animals to serve in classrooms and help\nchildren develop a love of reading in a low-stress environment. Suppose that 20 therapy teams are apportioned\nto three schools based on their populations. When the population of School A decreases by 10 percent, the\npopulation of School B increases by 10 percent, and the population of School C remains constant, the\napportionment remains the same.\nIn the following exercises, determine whether the scenario violates the new-states paradox. Justify your answer.\n7. A charity organization has 851 volunteers in Country A and 3449 volunteers in Country B. There are 43 lead\norganizers that must be apportioned to the two locations. Country A receives 9 while Country B receives 34.\nWhen the operations are expanded to Country C with 725 volunteers, 7 new lead organizers are added to the\nteam. When the lead organizers are reapportioned, Country A receives 9, Country B receives 34, and Country C\nreceives 7 lead organizers.\n8. A country has two states. There are 22 seats in the legislature. State A has 4 seats, and State B has 18 seats.\nWhen State C joins the union, the number of representatives is increased by five. Under the new\napportionment, State A receives 3 seats, State B receives 19 seats, and State C receives 5 seats.\n9. In the Garunga Solar System, there are four inhabited planets. Three of the planets are members of the United\nAssociation of Garungan Planets (UAGP). The UAGP has 67 seats. Planet Angluertka has 40 seats, planet\nBangluertka has 27 seats, and planet Clangluertka has 13 seats. When planet Danggluertka decides to join the\nUAGP, 14 seats are added to accommodate them proportionately. The new allocation of seats gives 40 seats to\nAngluertka, 26 seats to Bangluertka, 14 seats to Clangluertka, and 14 seats to Danggluertka.\nIn the following exercises, use the Hamilton method of apportionment to answer the questions.\n10.

Hamilton\u2019s method satisfies\nthe quota rule and favors neither larger nor smaller states.\n\u2022 Jefferson\u2019s method of apportionment uses a modified divisor that is adjusted so that the modified lower quotas sum\nto the house size. Jefferson\u2019s method violates the quota rule and favors larger states.\n\u2022 Adams\u2019s method of apportionment uses a modified divisor that is adjusted so that the modified upper quotas, sum\nto the house size. Adams\u2019s method violates the quota rule and favors smaller states.\n\u2022 Webster\u2019s method of apportionment uses a modified divisor that is adjusted so that the modified state quotas,\nrounded using traditional rounding, sum to the house size. Webster\u2019s method violates the quota rule but favors\nneither larger nor smaller states.\n11.5Fairness in Apportionment Methods\n\u2022 Several surprising outcomes can occur when apportioning seats that voters may find unfair: Alabama paradox,\npopulation paradox, and new-state paradox.\n\u2022 Apportionment methods are susceptible to apportionment paradoxes and may violate the quota rule.\n\u2022 The Balinsky-Young Impossibility Theorem indicates that no apportionment can satisfy all fairness criteria.\nVideos\n11.1Voting Methods\n\u2022 How Does Ranked-Choice Voting Work?(https://openstax.org/r/ranked-choice_voting1)\n\u2022 Determine Winner of Election by Ranked-Choice Method (aka Instant Runoff)(https://openstax.org/r/ranked- 1228 11 \u2022 Chapter Summary\nchoice_voting2)\n\u2022 Determine Winner of Election by Borda Count Method(https://openstax.org/r/Borda_count_method)\n\u2022 Determine Winner of Election by Pairwise Comparison Method(https://openstax.org/r/w1NNK7Dn3E8)\n11.2Fairness in Voting Methods\n\u2022 Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances(https://openstax.org/r/separation_of_powers)\n11.3Standard Divisors, Standard Quotas, and the Apportionment Problem\n\u2022 What Is a Ratio?(https://openstax.org/r/ratios_proportions)\n\u2022 What Are the Different Types of Ratios?(https://openstax.org/r/ratio_types)\n\u2022 Math Antics \u2013 Rounding(https://openstax.org/r/rounding)\n11.4Apportionment Methods\n\u2022 Hamilton Method of Apportionment(https://openstax.org/r/Hamiltons_method)\n\u2022 Jefferson Apportionment Method(https://openstax.org/r/Jeffersons_method)\n\u2022 Adams Method Apportionment Calculator(https://openstax.org/r/Adams_method)\nFormula Review\n11.3Standard Divisors, Standard Quotas, and the Apportionment Problem\nLet be a particular item and another such that there is a constant ratio of to .\n\u2022 and\n\u2022\n\u2022\n11.5Fairness in Apportionment Methods\nProjects\nThe First Census: Challenges of Collecting Population Data\nAs you and your fellow founders write the Imaginarian constitution, you must also design systems to collect accurate\ninformation about the population of Imaginaria.

Model applications of graph basics.\nWhen you hear the word,graph, what comes to mind? You might think of the -coordinate system you learned about\nearlier in this course, or you might think of the line graphs and bar charts that are used to display data in news reports.\nThe graphs we discuss in this chapter are probably very different from what you think of as a graph. They look like a\nbunch of dots connected by short line segments. The dots represent a group of objects and the line segments represent\nthe connections, or relationships, between them. The objects might be bus stops, computers, Snapchat accounts, family\nmembers, or any other objects that have direct connections to each other. The connections can be physical or virtual,\nformal or casual, scientific or social. Regardless of the kind of connections, the purpose of the graph is to help us\nvisualize the structure of the entire network to better understand the interactions of the objects within it.\nParts of a Graph\nIn agraph, the objects are represented with dots and their connections are represented with lines like those inFigure\n12.3.Figure 12.3displays asimple graphlabeledGand amultigraphlabeledH. The dots are calledvertices; an\nindividual dot is avertex, which is one object of a set of objects, some of which may be connected. We often label\nvertices with letters. For example, GraphGhas verticesa, b, c, andd, and MultigraphHhas vertices,e, f, g, andh. Each\nline segment or connection joining two vertices is referred to as anedge.His considered a multigraph because it has a\ndouble edge betweenfandh, and a double edge betweenhandg. Another reasonHis called a multigraph is that it has\naloopconnecting vertexeto itself; a loop is an edge that joins a vertex to itself. Loops and double edges are not allowed\nin a simple graph.\nTo sum up, a simple graph is a collection of vertices and any edges that may connect them, such that every edge\nconnects two vertices with no loops and no two vertices are joined by more than one edge. A multigraph is a graph in\nwhich there may be loops or pairs of vertices that are joined by more than one edge. In this chapter, most of our work\nwill be with simple graphs, which we will call graphs for convenience.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.1 \u2022 Graph Basics 1239\nFigure12.3A Graph and a Multigraph\nIt is not necessary for the edges in a graph to be straight. In fact, you can draw an edge any way you want. In graph\ntheory, the focus is on which vertices are connected, not how the connections are drawn (seeFigure 12.4). In a graph,\neach edge can be named by the two letters of the associated vertices. The four edges in GraphXinFigure 12.4areab,\nac, ad, andae. The order of the letters is not important when you name the edge of a graph. For example,abrefers to\nthe same edge asba.\nA graph may have vertices that are not joined to other vertices by edges, such as vertex f in Graph X inFigure 12.4,\nbut any edge must have a vertex at each end.\nFigure12.4Different Representations of the Same Graph\nEXAMPLE12.1\nIdentifying Edges and Vertices\nName all the vertices and edges of graphFinFigure 12.5.\nFigure12.5GraphF\nSolution\nThe vertices arev, w, x, y, andz. The edges arevw, vx, wx, wz, xy, andxz.\nWhen listing the vertices and edges in a graph, work in alphabetical order to avoid accidentally listing the same item 1240 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\ntwice. When you are finished, count the number of vertices or edges you listed and compare that to the number of\nvertices or edges on the graph to ensure you didn\u2019t miss any.\nYOUR TURN12.1\n1. Name all the vertices and edges of GraphA.\nGraphA\nSince the purpose of a graph is to represent the connections between objects, it is very important to know if two vertices\nshare a common edge. The two vertices at either end of a given edge are referred to asneighboring, oradjacent. For\nexample, inFigure 12.5, verticesxandware adjacent, but verticesyandware not.\nEXAMPLE12.2\nIdentifying Vertices That Are Not Adjacent\nName all the pairs of vertices of graphFinFigure 12.5that arenotadjacent.\nSolution\nThe pairs of vertices that are not adjacent in graphFarevandy, vandz, wandy, andyandz.\nYOUR TURN12.2\n1.

The two computer scientists identified webpages as vertices and hyperlinks on those pages as edges because\nhyperlinks connect one website to the next. The number of edges influences the ranking of a website on the Google\nSearch Engine because the websites with more links to \u201ccredible sources\u201d are ranked higher.(\"Page Rank: The Graph\nTheory-based Backbone of Google,\"(https://openstax.org/r/The_Graph_Theory)September 20, 2011, Cornell\nUniversity, Networks Blog.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.1 \u2022 Graph Basics 1241\nAnalyzing Geographical Maps with Graphs\nFigure12.6Commercial airlines' route systems create a global network.\nWhen graphs are used to model and analyze real-world applications, the number of edges that meet at a particular\nvertex is important. For example, a graph may represent the direct flight connections for a particular airport as inFigure\n12.7. Representing the connections with a graph rather than a map shifts the focus away from the relative positions and\ntoward which airports are connected. InFigure 12.7, the vertices are the airports, and the edges are the direct flight\npaths. The number of flight connections between a particular airport and other South Florida airports is the number of\nedges meeting at a particular vertex. For example, Key West has direct flights to three of the five airports on the graph.\nIn graph theory terms, we would say that vertex FYW hasdegree3. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that\nconnect to that vertex.\nFigure12.7Direct Flights between South Florida Airports\nEXAMPLE12.3\nDetermining the Degree of a Vertex\nDetermine the degree of each vertex of GraphJinFigure 12.7. If graphJrepresents direct flights between a set of\nairports, do any of the airports have direct flights to two or more of the other cities on the graph? 1242 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.8GraphJ\nSolution\nFor each vertex, count the number of edges that meet at that vertex. This value is the degree of the vertex. InFigure\n12.9, the dashed edges indicate the edges that meet at the marked vertex.\nFigure12.9Degrees of Vertices of GraphJ\nVertexahas degree 3, vertexbhas degree 1, verticescanddeach have degree 2, and vertexehas degree 0.

States like Utah\nand New Mexico that meet at only a single point arenotconsidered to have a shared border. By representing this map as\na graph, where the connections are shared borders, we shift our perspective from physical attributes such as shape, size\nand distance, toward the existence of the relationship of having a shared boundary.\nFigure12.11Graph of the Shared Boundaries of Four Corners States\nEXAMPLE12.4\nGraphing the Midwestern States\nA map of the Midwest is given inFigure 12.12.

Any scenario in which objects are\nconnected to each other can be represented with a graph, and the connections don\u2019t have to be physical.

Indicate whether a graph or a multigraph would be a better model.\nSolution\nThe objects that are represented with vertices areRobloxfriends. ARobloxfriendship between two friends will be\nrepresented as an edge between a pair of vertices. There will be no double edges because it is not possible for two\nfriends to be linked twice inRoblox; they are either friends or they are not. Also, a player cannot be a friend to themself,\nso there is no need for a loop. Since there are no double edges or loops, this is best represented as a graph.\nYOUR TURN12.5\n1.

(credit: \"MRI Scan\" by NIH Image Gallery/Flickr, Public Domain)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Describe and interpret relationships in graphs.\n2. Model relationships with graphs.\nGraph theory is used in neuroscience to study how different parts of the brain connect. Neurobiologists use functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure levels of blood in different parts of the brain, called nodes. When nodes\nare active at the same time, it suggests there is a functional connection between them so they form a network. This\nnetwork can be represented as a graph where the vertices are the nodes and the functional connections are the edges\nbetween them.

Which graph do you think would represent a network with the highest resistance\nto failure? Which graph would probably be the most vulnerable to failure? How might this relate to the degrees of the\nvertices?\nFigure12.17Models of Neural Networks\nSolution\nGraphBrepresents a network that would have the highest resistance to failure because there are more edges\nconnecting the nodes indicating there are more connections between nodes than on either of the other graphs. This\nwould make the network more resistant to failure because there are more options to work around a faulty edge or node.\nGraphAwould probably be the most susceptible to failure because the network depends on a few particular edges and\nvertices for connections. There are more vertices of higher degree in GraphBthan in GraphAbecause there are more\nedges connecting the nodes.\nYOUR TURN12.6\nSociologists use graphs to study connections between people and to identify characteristics that make communities\nmore resilient, more likely to stay connected over time. In the graphs shown, the edges represent social connections\nand the vertices are individuals.\nModels of Communities\n1. Which graph do you think represents the most resilient community? What is the sum of the degrees of all the\nvertices in this graph?\n2. Which graph do you think represents the community that is least likely to stay connected over time?

Is the sum of the degrees higher or lower in a more resilient community?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 Graph Structures 1251\nRelating the Number of Edges to the Degrees of Vertices\nIn the applications of graph theory to neuroscience and sociology inExample 12.6andYOUR TURN 12.6, there was a\ncorrelation between the degrees of vertices and the resilience of a network. Researchers in many fields have also\nobserved a direct relationship between the number of edges in a graph and the degrees of the vertices. To begin to\nunderstand this relationship, consider a graph with five vertices and zero edges as inFigure 12.18.\nFigure12.18Graph with Five Vertices and zero Edges\nInstead of being marked with a name, each vertex inFigure 12.18is marked with its degree. In this case, all of the\ndegrees are 0 so the sum of the degrees is also zero. Suppose that we add an edge between any two existing vertices\nand indicate the degrees of the vertices. This gives us a graph with five vertices and one edge like the graph inFigure\n12.19.\nFigure12.19Graph with Five Vertices and One Edge\nNote that the degrees of two vertices increased, each by 1. So, the sum of the degrees is now 2. Suppose that we\ncontinue in this way, adding one edge at a time and making note of the number of edges and the sum of the degrees of\nthe vertices as inFigure 12.20.\nFigure12.20Comparing Number of Edges to Sum of Degrees\nFigure 12.20demonstrates a characteristic that is true of all graphs of any shape or size. When the number of edges is\nincreased by one, the sum of the degrees increases by two. This happens because each edge has two ends and each end\nincreases the degree of one vertex by one unit. As a result, the sum of the degrees of the vertices on any graph is always\ntwice the number of edges. This relationship is known as theSum of Degrees Theorem.\nFORMULA\nFor the Sum of Degrees Theorem,\nor\nEXAMPLE12.7\nFinding the Sum of Degrees\nSuppose that a graph has five edges.\n1.

SeeFigure 12.21.\nFigure12.21\nYOUR TURN12.7\nSuppose that the sum of the degrees of a graph is six.\n1. Find the number of edges.\n2. Draw two graphs that demonstrate your conclusion.\nCompleteness\nSuppose that there were five strangers in a room,A,B,C,D, andE, and each one would be introduced to each of the\nothers. How many introductions are necessary? One way to begin to answer this question is to draw a graph with each\nvertex representing an individual in the room and each edge representing an introduction as inFigure 12.22.\nFigure12.22Model of Introductions between Five Strangers\nLet\u2019s approach the problem by thinking about how many new people PersonAwould meet, then PersonB, and so on,\nmaking sure not to repeat any introductions. The first graph inFigure 12.22shows PersonAmeeting PersonsB,C,D,\nandE, for a total of 4 introductions. The next graph shows that PersonBstill has to meet PersonsC,D, andE, for a total\nof 3 more introductions. The next graph shows that PersonCstill has to meet PersonsDandE, which is 2 more\nintroductions. The next graph shows that PersonDonly remains to meet PersonE, which is 1 more introduction. The\nfinal graph has edges representing 10 introductions. The last graph is an example of acomplete\ngraph because each pair of vertices is joined by an edge. Another way of saying this is that the graph is complete\nbecause each vertex is adjacent to every other vertex.Figure 12.23shows complete graphs with three, four, five, and six\nvertices.\nFigure12.23Complete Graphs with Up to Six Vertices\nSuppose we want to know the number of introductions necessary in a room with six people. This would be represented\nby a complete graph with six vertices, and the total number of introductions would be , the\nnumber of edges in the graph. In fact, you can always find the number of introductions in a room with people by\nadding all the whole numbers from 1 to .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 Graph Structures 1253\nFORMULA\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with vertices is the sum of the whole numbers from 1 to ,\n.\nSuppose that we want to determine how many introductions are necessary in a room with 500 strangers. In other words,\nsuppose that we want to determine the number of edges in a complete graph with 500 vertices. Adding up all the\nnumbers from 1 to 499 could take a long time! In the next example, we use the Sum of Degrees Theorem to make the\nproblem more manageable.\nEXAMPLE12.8\nUsing the Sum of Degrees Theorem\nUse the Sum of Degrees Theorem to determine the number of introductions required in a room with\n1. 6 strangers.\n2. 10 strangers.\n3. strangers.\nSolution\n1. Since there are 6 strangers, there are 6 vertices. Since each individual must meet 5 other individuals, there are 5\nedges meeting at each vertex which means each vertex has degree 5. Since there are 6 vertices of degree 5, the sum\nof degrees is . By the Sum of Degrees Theorem, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees, which\nis . So, the total number of introductions is 15.\n2. Since there are 10 strangers, there are 10 vertices. Since each individual must meet 9 other individuals, there are 9\nedges meeting at each vertex which means each vertex has degree 9. Since there are 10 vertices of degree 9, the\nsum of degrees is . By the Sum of Degrees Theorem, the number of edges is half the sum of the degrees,\nwhich is . So, the total number of introductions is 45.\n3. Since there are strangers, there are vertices. Since each individual must meet other individuals, there are\nedges meeting at each vertex which means each vertex has degree . Since there are vertices of degree\n, the sum of degrees is . By the Sum of Degrees Theorem, the number of edges is half the sum of the\ndegrees, which is . So, the total number of introductions is .\nYOUR TURN12.8\n1. Determine the number of introductions necessary in a room with 500 strangers using the Sum of Degrees\nTheorem.\nNow we have a shorter way to calculate the number of introductions in a room with strangers, and the number of\nedges on a complete graph with vertices. Let\u2019s update our formula.\nFORMULA\nThe number of edges in a complete graph with vertices is .\nSubgraphs\nSometimes a graph is a part of a larger graph.

(credit: \"Diagram of the water cycle\" by NASA, Public Domain)\nWhen you think of a cycle in everyday life, you probably think of something that begins and ends the same way. For\nexample, the water cycle (Figure 12.26) begins with water in a lake or ocean, which evaporates into water vapor,\ncondenses into clouds, and then returns to earth as rain or some other form of precipitation that settles into lakes or\noceans. Acyclein graph theory is similar in that it begins and ends in the same way: It is a series of connected edges\nthat begin and end at the same vertex but otherwise never repeat any vertices.\nIn a cycle, there are always the same number of vertices as edges, and all vertices must be of degree 2. Cycles are often\nreferred to by the number of vertices. For example, a cycle with 5 vertices can be called a 5-cycle. Cycles can also be\nnamed after polygons based on the number of edges. For example a 5-cycle is also called a pentagon.Table 12.1lists\nthese names for cycles of size 3 through size 10.\nCycle Category Number of Edges Example\ntriangle 3\nquadrilateral 4\npentagon 5\nhexagon 6\nheptagon 7\noctagon 8\nTable12.1Categories of Cycles 1256 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nCycle Category Number of Edges Example\nnonagon 9\ndecagon 10\nTable12.1Categories of Cycles\nThere are many more polygon names, including a megagon that has a million edges and a googolgon that has\nedges, but usually we just say -gon when the number is past 10. For example, a cycle with 11 edges could be called an\n11-gon.\nNotice that the 10-cycle, or decagon, appears to cross over itself inTable 12.1. Remember, graphs can be drawn\ndifferently but represent the same connections. InFigure 12.27, the same decagon is transformed into a graph that does\nnot appear to overlap itself. We have done this without changing any of the connections so both diagrams represent the\nsame relationships, and both diagrams are considered decagons.\nFigure12.27Transformation of a Decagon\nWHO KNEW?\nGoogol to Google\nDid the name \"googolgon\" ring a bell for you? If so, there is a good reason for it. The creators of Google.com\nrenamed their search engine Google, a misspelled reference to the number \"googol\" alluding to the enormous\nnumber of calculations their algorithm can tackle.

Cyclic subgraphs are named\nby listing their vertices sequentially. The vertex where you begin is not important. GraphKinFigure 12.28has two\ntriangle cycles (g,h,j) and (h,i,j), and one quadrilateral cycle (g,h,i,j).\nFigure12.28Cycles in GraphK\nThe same cycle can be named in many ways, but we must keep in mind that listing two vertices consecutively\nindicates an edge exists between them. For example, (g, h, i, j) can also be named (h, i, j, g) or (j, i, h, g). However,\nyou cannot name it (g, i, h, j,) which doesn't reflect the correct order of the vertices. We can see that the order (g, i,\nh, j) is incorrect because the cycle has no edges gi or hj.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 Graph Structures 1257\nEXAMPLE12.10\nIdentifying Cyclic Subgraphs\nIdentify the types of cyclic subgraphs in GraphHinFigure 12.29and name them.\nFigure12.29GraphH\nSolution\nIn order to avoid missing a cycle, begin by analyzing the vertexa, then proceed in alphabetical order.

After checking each of the remaining vertices, we see there are no other cycles.\nIn order to avoid naming the same cycle twice, consider naming cycles beginning with the letter closest to the\nbeginning of the alphabet and then progressing clockwise.\nYOUR TURN12.10\n1. Which types of cycles are in GraphGin Figure 12.32? Use the vertices of the graph to give a name for one of each\ntype that you find.\nWe have seen that sociologists use graphs to study the structures of social networks. In sociology, there is a principle\nknown as Triadic Closure. It says that if two individuals in a social network have a friend in common, then it is more likely\nthose two individuals will become friends too. Sociologists refer to this as an open triad becoming a closed triad. This\nconcept can be visualized as graphs inFigure 12.30. (Chakraborty, Dutta, Mondal, and Nath, \"Application of Graph Theory\nin Social Media,International Journal of Computer Sciences and Engineering, 6(10):722-729) In the open triad inFigure\n12.30, personaand personbeach has a friendship with personc. In the closed triad, personaand personahave also\ndeveloped a friendship. Notice that the graph representing the closed triad is a three-cycle, or a triangle, in graph theory\nterms.\nFigure12.30Graphs of Open Triad and Closed Triad\nAnother topic of interest to sociologists, as well as computer scientists and scientists in many fields, is the concept of a\nclique. In a social group, a clique is a subgroup who are all friends. A triad is an example of a clique with three people,\nbut there can be cliques of any size. In graph theory, a clique is a complete subgraph.\nEXAMPLE12.11\nIdentifying Triads and Cliques\nThe graphs inYOUR TURN 12.6represent social communities. The vertices are individuals and the edges are social\nconnections. Use the graphs to answer the questions.\n1. Which graph has the most triads? Name the triangles.\n2. Which graph has the fewest triads? Name the triangles.\n3. How might an increase in the number of triads in a graph affect the resilience of a community? Explain your\nreasoning. 1258 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\n4. Identify a clique with more than three vertices in GraphEby naming its vertices.\nSolution\n1. GraphEhas the most triads. The triangles are (a, b, c), (a, e, g), (c, f, i), (e, g, h), (e, h, i), and (f, h, i).\n2. GraphDhas the fewest triads. There are no triangles in the graph.\n3. More triads means vertices of greater degree, which indicates greater resilience. Specifically, if an edge is removed\nfrom a closed triad, there the two individuals who are no longer adjacent are still connected by way of the third\nmember of the triad.\n4.

Let\u2019s look at the three-cycles within complete graphs with up to six vertices, which are shown inFigure 12.31.\nFigure12.31Complete Graphs with Up to Six Vertices\nLet's list the names of all the triangles in each graph.Since every pair of vertices is adjacent, any three vertices on a\ncomplete graph form a triangle. There is only one triangle in the complete graph with three vertices, (a,b,c). For the\nrest of the graphs, it is important that we take an organized approach. Start with the vertex that is first alphabetically,\nlisting any triangles that include that vertex also in alphabetical order. Then, proceed to the next vertex in the alphabet,\nand list any triangles that include that vertex, except those that are already listed.

Do you see a pattern emerge for counting triangles in a complete graph? Without\ndrawing a complete graph with 7 vertices, we can predict that it will have\ntriangles inside it. This pattern also appears in a\nfamous diagram known to Western mathematicians as \"Pascal\u2019s Triangle.\"Figure 12.32displays the first 11 rows of\nPascal\u2019s Triangle. Row 0 of Pascal\u2019s Triangle only has the number 1 in it. The first and last entries in each of the other\nrows are also 1s. Otherwise, all the entries are formed by adding two entries from the previous row. For example, in row\n6, entry 1 is 6, which was found by adding 1 and the 5 from the previous row, and entry 2 is 15, which was found by\nadding the 5 and the 10 from the previous row, as shown inTable 12.2.\nFigure12.32Pascal\u2019s Triangle\nIMPORTANT!

Determine when two graphs represent the same relationships\n3. Explore real-world examples of graph isomorphisms\n4. Find the complement of a graph\nMaps of the same region may not always look the same. For example, a map of Earth on a flat surface looks distorted at\nthe poles. When the same regions are mapped on a spherical globe, the countries that are closer to the polls appear 1266 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nsmaller without the distortion. Despite these differences, the two maps still communicate the same relationships\nbetween nations such as shared boundaries, and relative position on the earth. In essence, they are the same map. This\nmeans that for every point on one map, there is a corresponding point on the other map in the same relative location. In\nthis section, we will determine exactly what characteristics need to be the shared by two graphs in order for us to\nconsider them \u201cthe same.\u201d\nWhen Are Two Graphs Really the Same Graph?\nIn arithmetic, when two numbers have the same value, we say they are equal, like \u00bd = 0.5. Although \u00bd and 0.5 look\ndifferent, they have the same value, because they are assigned the same position on the real number line. When do we\nsay that two graphs are equal?\nFigure 12.38shows GraphsAandF, which are identical except for the labels. Graphs are visual representations of\nconnections. As long as two graphs indicate the same pattern of connections, like GraphAand GraphF, they are\nconsidered to be equal, or in graph theory terms,isomorphic.\nFigure12.38Identical Graphs with Different Labels\nTwo graphs are isomorphic if either one of these conditions holds:\n1. One graph can be transformed into the other without breaking existing connections or adding new ones.\n2. There is a correspondence between their vertices in such a way that any adjacent pair in one graph corresponds to\nan adjacent pair in the other graph.\nIt is important to note that if either one of the isomorphic conditions holds, then both of them do. When we need to\ndecide if two graphs are isomorphic, we will need to make sure that one of them holds. For example,Figure 12.39shows\nhow GraphTcan be bent and flipped to look like GraphZ, which means that GraphsTandZsatisfy condition 1 and are\nisomorphic.\nFigure12.39GraphTTransformed Into GraphZ\nAlso, notice that the vertices that were adjacent in the first graph are still adjacent in the transformed graph as shown in\nFigure 12.40. For example, vertex 3 is still adjacent to vertex 4, which means they are still neighboring vertices joined by\na single edge.\nFigure12.40Adjacent Vertices Are Still Adjacent\nWhen Are Two Graphs Really Different?\nVerifying that two graphs are isomorphic can be a challenging process, especially for larger graphs. It makes sense to\ncheck for any obvious ways in which the graphs might differ so that we don\u2019t spend time trying to verify that graphs are\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Comparing Graphs 1267\nisomorphic when they are not. If two graphs have any of the differences shown inTable 12.3, then they cannot be\nisomorphic.\nUnequal number of vertices\nUnequal number of edges\nUnequal number of vertices of a particular degree\nDifferent cyclic subgraphs\nTable12.3Characteristics of Graphs That Are Not Isomorphic\nRecognizing Isomorphic Graphs\nIsomorphic graphs that represent the same pattern of connections can look very different despite having the same\nunderlying structure. The edges can be stretched and twisted. The graph can be rotated or flipped. For example, in\nFigure 12.41, each of the diagrams represents the same pattern of connections.\nFigure12.41Four Representations of the Same Graph\nLooking atFigure 12.41, how can we know that these graphs are isomorphic? We will start by checking for any obvious\ndifferences. Each of the graphs inFigure 12.41has four vertices and five edges; so, there are no differences there. Next,\nwe will focus on the degrees of the vertices, which have been labeled inFigure 12.42.\nFigure12.42Graphs with Vertices of the Same Degrees\nAs shown inFigure 12.42, each graph has two vertices of degree 2 and two vertices of degree 3; so, there are no\ndifferences there. Now, let\u2019s check for cyclic subgraphs. These are highlighted inFigure 12.43. 1268 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.43Graphs with the Same Cyclic Subgraphs\nAs shown inFigure 12.43, each graph has two triangles and one quadrilateral; so, no differences there either. It is\nbeginning to look likely that these graphs are isomorphic, but we will have to look further to be sure.\nTo know with certainty that these graphs are isomorphic, we need to confirm one of the two conditions from the\ndefinition of isomorphic graphs. With smaller graphs, you may be able to visualize how to stretch and twist one graph to\nget the other to see if condition 1 holds. Imagine the edges are stretchy and picture how to pull and twist one graph to\nform the other. If you can do this without breaking or adding any connections, then the graphs are really the same.\nFigure 12.44demonstrates how to change graphA4to getA3, graphA3to getA2, and graphA2to getA1.\nFigure12.44Transforming Graphs\nNow that we have used visual analysis to see that condition 1 holds for graphsA1,A2,A3, andA4inFigure 12.43, we\nknow that they are isomorphic. InFigure 12.44, one of the edges of graphA4crossed another edge of the graph. By\ntransforming it into graphA3, we have \u201cuntangled\u201d it. Graphs that can be untangled are calledplanargraphs. The\ncomplete graph with five vertices is an example of anonplanargraph-that means that, no matter how hard you try, you\ncan\u2019t untangle it. But, when you try to figure out if two graphs are the same, it can be helpful to untangle them as much\nas possible to make the similarities and differences more obvious.\nEXAMPLE12.13\nIdentifying Isomorphic Graphs\nWhich of the three graphs inFigure 12.45are isomorphic, if any? Justify your answer.\nFigure12.45Three Similar Graphs\nSolution\nStep 1:Check for differences in number of vertices, number of edges, degrees of vertices, and types of cycles to see if an\nisomorphism is possible.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Comparing Graphs 1269\n\u2022 Vertices: They all have the same number of vertices, 4.\n\u2022 Edges: They all have the same number of edges, 4.\n\u2022 Degrees: GraphB1and GraphB2each have a vertex of degree 3, while GraphB3does not. So, GraphB3is not\nisomorphic to either of the other two graphs, but GraphB1and GraphB2could possibly be isomorphic.\n\u2022 Cycles: Focus on any cycles in GraphB1and GraphB2. Each graph has a triangle as shown inFigure 12.46.\nFigure12.46Cycles of GraphB1and GraphB2\nStep 2:If no differences were found and an isomorphism is possible, verify one of the conditions in the definition of\nisomorphic.\nSince we were able to determine that GraphB1and GraphB2have no obvious differences, and they are relatively small\ngraphs, we will attempt to transform one graph into the other, which would verify condition 1. GraphB1can be\ntransformed into GraphB2without breaking or adding connections as shown inFigure 12.47. Begin by untangling graph\nB1. Then rotate or flip as needed to see that the graphs match.\nFigure12.47Transformation of GraphB1\nSo, GraphB1and GraphB2have the same structure and are isomorphic.\nYOUR TURN12.13\n1. Name four differences between GraphC1and GraphC2that show they cannot be isomorphic.\nTwo Distinct Graphs\nHave you ever noticed that many popular board games may look different but are really the same game? A good\nexample is the many variations of the board gameMonopoly\u00ae, which was submitted to the U.S. Patent Office in 1935.\nAlthough the rules have been revised a bit, a very similar game board is still in use today. There have been many\nversions of Monopoly over the years. Many have been stylized to reflect a popular theme, such as a show or sports team,\nwhile retaining the same game board structure. If we were to represent these different versions of the game using a\ngraph, we would find that the graphs are isomorphic. . Let's analyze some game boards using graph theory to determine\nif they have the same structure despite having different appearances. 1270 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.48Two Game Boards\nEXAMPLE12.14\nDeciding If Graphs are Isomorphic\nA teacher uses games to teach her students about colors and numbers as shown inFigure 12.48.\nIn the Colors Game, shown in FigureA, each player begins in the space marked START and proceeds in a\ncounterclockwise direction. On each turn, the player spins a spinner marked 1 and 2 and moves forward the number of\nspaces shown on the spinner.

If the player lands on a space marked with a\ndiamond, the player jumps to the next space marked with a diamond and stops there. The first player to land in\nor pass the space marked END wins. In the Dots game, shown in FigureB, each player begins in the space\nmarked 1 and proceeds in numerical order through the numbered spaces. On each turn, the player rolls a six-\nsided die and moves forward the number of spaces shown on the die. When a player lands on a space marked\nwith a green dot, they immediately move to the space indicated by the arrow. Construct a graph to represent\neach gameboard such that each vertex represented a space on the game board and each edge represented the\nability of a player to move directly from one space to the next. For example, in the Dots game, the vertex\nrepresenting space 3 would be adjacent to 2, 4, and 6. Identify at least three differences between a graph based\non Diamonds and a graph based on Dots to show the graphs are not isomorphic. 1272 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nTwo Game Boards\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nElizabeth Magie\nGame designer, engineer, comedian, and political activist, Elizabeth Magie designed a game called \u201cLandlord\u2019s Game\u201d\nto educate fellow citizens about the dangers of monopolies and the benefits of wealth redistribution through a land\ntax. Magie, whose father had campaigned with Abraham Lincoln, was a proponent of a land tax, an idea popularized\nby Henry George\u2019s 1879 book,Progress and Poverty. She designed the game to be played by two sets of rules for\ncomparison. In one version, the goal was to dominate opponents by creating monopolies, leaving one wealthy player\nstanding in the end. In the other version, all the players were rewarded when a monopoly was created through a\nsimulated land tax. She patented this game for the first time in 1904. Does the game board inFigure 12.50look\nfamiliar?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Comparing Graphs 1273\nFigure12.50Landlord\u2019s GamePatent (credit: \"Landlord's Game Patent\" Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nThat\u2019s right! A modified version of the game was obtained from friends by a man named Charles Darrow who\nrenamed it Monopoly and sold to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers later paid Magie $500 for the right to her patent\non it. The property tax version was left behind, and the modern game of Monopoly was born.

This list of corresponding pairs of vertices in\nsuch a way that any adjacent pair in one graph corresponds to an adjacent pair in the other graph is called an\nisomorphism. Consider the isomorphic graphs inFigure 12.38. InFigure 12.51, we could replace the labels GraphFwith\nthe labels from GraphAand have an identical graph, as inFigure 12.52.\nFigure12.51Identical Graphs with Different Labels 1274 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.52Corresponding Vertices\nSo, we can identify an isomorphism between GraphAand GraphFby listing the corresponding pairs of vertices:b-g,c-h,\nd-i, ande-j. Notice thatbis adjacent tocandgis adjacent toh. This must be the case sincebcorresponds togandc\ncorresponds toh. The same is true for other pairs of adjacent vertices.\nAn isomorphism between graphs is not necessarily unique. There can be more than one isomorphism between two\ngraphs. We can see how to form a different isomorphism between GraphAand GraphFfromFigure 12.33by rotating\nGraphFclockwise and comparing the rotated version ofFto GraphAas inYOUR TURN 12.13. Now, we can see that a\nsecond isomorphism exists, which has the correspondence:b-j,d-h,c-i, ande-gas shown inFigure 12.53.\nFigure12.53Transforming GraphFinto GraphA\nWhen you name isomorphisms, one way to check that your answer is reasonable is to make sure that the degrees of\ncorresponding vertices are equal.\nVIDEO\nDetermine If Two Graphs Are Isomorphic and Identify the Isomorphism(https://openstax.org/r/Determine_If_Two)\nEXAMPLE12.15\nIdentifying Isomorphisms\nInExample 12.13, we showed that the GraphsB1andB2inFigure 12.45are isomorphic.

Also, GraphScontains a triangle cycle (m,r,o) but GraphGhas no triangles. This means that the\ngraphs are not isomorphic.\nFigure12.57Comparing Subgraphs 1276 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nStep 2:This step is not necessary because we now know GraphsGandSare not isomorphic.\nYOUR TURN12.16\n1. Three students have been asked to determine if GraphsEandTare isomorphic and justify their answers.\nGraphEand GraphT\nJavier believes that GraphsEandTare not isomorphic because GraphEcontains a triangle cycle and GraphT\ndoes not. He supports his conclusion with the graphs shown.\nJavier\u2019s Highlighted Cycle\nMaubi also believes that GraphsEandTare not isomorphic, but says that it is because GraphThas a\nquadrilateral cycle (p,q,r,s) while GraphEdoes not. Caden believes that GraphsEandTare isomorphic. She\nsaid one isomorphism isa-p,b-q,c-s, andd-r. Determine who is correct, who is incorrect, and explain how you\nknow.\nComplementary Graphs\nSuppose that you are a camp counselor at Camp Woebegone and you are holding a camp Olympics with four events. The\ncampers have signed up for the events. You drew a graph inFigure 12.58to help you visualize which events have\ncampers in common.\nFigure12.58Graph of Events with Campers in Common\nGraphEinFigure 12.58shows that some of the same campers will be in eventsaandb, as well asbandd,candd, anda\nandc. What do you think the graph would look like that represented the events that do not have campers in common? It\nwould have the same vertices, but any pair of adjacent edges in GraphE, would not be adjacent in the new graph, and\nvice versa. This is called acomplementarygraph, as shown inFigure 12.59. Two graphs are complementary if they have\nthe same set of vertices, but any vertices that are adjacent in one, are not adjacent in the other. In this case, we can say\nthat one graph is thecomplementof the other.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Comparing Graphs 1277\nFigure12.59Graphs of Camp Olympics\nOne way to find the complement of a graph is to draw the complete graph with the same number of vertices and remove\nall the edges that were in the original graph. Let\u2019s say you wanted to find the complement of GraphEfromFigure 12.59,\nand you didn\u2019t already know it was GraphF. You could start with the complete graph with four vertices and remove the\nedges that are in GraphEas shown inFigure 12.60.\nFigure12.60Use Complete Graph to Find Complement\nEXAMPLE12.17\nFinding a Complement\nA particular high school has end-of-course exams in (E3) English 3, (E4) English 4, (M) Advanced Math, (C) Calculus, (W)\nWorld History, (U) U.S. History, (B) Biology, and (P) Physics. No English 3 students are taking English 4, World History, or\nBiology; no English 4 students are also in Calculus, Advanced Math, U.S. History, or Physics; no Physics students are also\ntaking Advanced Math; No World History students are also taking U.S. History; and no Advanced Math students are also\ntaking Calculus.\n1.

InFigure 12.61, we have drawn a vertex for each exam and edges between any vertices that have no students in\ncommon.\nFigure12.61Graph of Exams with No Students in Common\n2. One way to get the complement of the graph inFigure 12.61is to draw a complete graph with the same number of\nvertices and remove the edges they have in common as shown inFigure 12.62. 1278 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.62Remove Unwanted Edges from Complete Graph\nThe final graph of the complement is inFigure 12.63.\nFigure12.63Graph of Exams with Students in Common\n3.

Find the complement of the GraphH.\nWhen two graphs are really the same graph, they have the same missing edges. So, when two graphs have a lot of\nedges, it may actually be easier to determine if they are isomorphic by looking at which edges are missing rather than\nwhich edges are included. In other words, we can determine if two graphs are isomorphic by checking if their\ncomplements are isomorphic.\nEXAMPLE12.18\nUsing a Complement to Find an Isomorphism\nUseFigure 12.64to answer each question.\nFigure12.64GraphK\n1.

(credit: \u201cLongleat Maze\u201d by Niki Odolphie/Wikimedia, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Describe and identify walks, trails, paths, and circuits.\n2. Solve application problems using walks, trails, paths, and circuits.\n3. Identify the chromatic number of a graph.\n4. Describe the Four-Color Problem.\n5. Solve applications using graph colorings.\nNow that we know the basic parts of graphs and we can distinguish one graph from another, it is time to really put our\ngraphs to work for us. Many applications of graph theory involve navigating through a graph very much like you would\nnavigate through a maze. Imagine that you are at the entrance to a maze. Your goal is to get from one point to another\nas efficiently as possible. Maybe there are treasures hidden along the way that make straying from the shortest path\nworthwhile, or maybe you just need to get to the end fast. Either way, you definitely want to avoid any wrong turns that\nwould cause unnecessary backtracking. Luckily, graph theory is here to help!\nWalks\nSupposeFigure 12.69is a maze you want to solve. You want to get from the start to the end.\nFigure12.69Your Maze\nYou can approach this task any way you want. The only rule is that you can\u2019t climb over the wall. To put this in the context\nof graph theory, let\u2019s imagine that at every intersection and every turn, there is a vertex. The edges that join the vertices\nmust stay within the walls. The graph within the maze would look likeFigure 12.70. 1284 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.70The Graph in Your Maze\nOne approach to solving a maze is to just start walking. It is not the most efficient approach. You might cross through\nthe same intersection twice. You might backtrack a bit. It\u2019s okay. We are just out for a walk. It might look something like\nthe black sequence of vertices and edges inFigure 12.71.\nFigure12.71The Walk Through the Graph in Your Maze\nThis type of sequence of adjacent vertices and edges is actually called awalk(ordirected walk) in graph theory too!\nA walk can be identified by naming the sequence of its vertices (or by naming the sequence of its edges if those are\nlabeled). Let\u2019s take the graph out of the context of the maze and give each vertex a name and each edge of the walk a\ndirection as inFigure 12.72.\nFigure12.72The Graph without Your Maze\nThe name of this walk fromptorisp\u2192q\u2192o\u2192n\u2192i\u2192j\u2192c\u2192d\u2192c\u2192j\u2192k\u2192s\u2192r. When a particular edge on our\ngraph was traveled in both directions, it had arrows in both directions and the letters of vertices that were visited more\nthan once had to be repeated in the name of the walk.\nNot every list of vertices or list of edges makes a path. The order must take into account the way in which the edges\nand vertices are connected. The list must be a sequence, which means they are in order. No edges or vertices can be\nskipped and you cannot go off the graph.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1285\nFigure12.73A Walk or Not a Walk?\nThe highlighted edges GraphYinFigure 12.73represent a walk betweenfandb. The highlighted edges in GraphXdo\nnotrepresent a walk betweenfandb, because there is a turn at a point that is not a vertex. This is like climbing over a\nwall when you are walking through a maze. Another way of saying this is thatb\u2192d\u2192fis not a walk, because there is no\nedge betweenbandd.\nA point on a graph where two edges cross is not a vertex.\nEXAMPLE12.19\nNaming a Walk Through A House\nFigure 12.74shows the floor plan of a house. Use the floor plan to answer each question.\nFigure12.74Floor Plan of a House\n1. Draw a graph to represent the floor plan in which each vertex represents a different room (or hallway) and edges\nrepresent doorways between rooms.\n2. Name a walk through the house that begins in the living room, ends in the garage and visits each room (or hallway)\nat least once.\nSolution\n1. Step 1:We will need a vertex for each room and it is convenient to label them according to the names of the rooms.\nVisualize the scenario in your head as shown inFigure 12.75.

Step 1:Draw a path that begins at vertexL, representing the living room, and ending at vertexG, representing the\ngarage making sure to visit every room at least once. There are many ways this can be done. You may want to\nnumber the edges to keep track of their order. One example is shown inFigure 12.77.\nFigure12.77Draw the Path fromLtoG\nStep 2:Name the path that you followed by listing the vertices in the order you visited them.\nL\u2192R\u2192L\u2192K\u2192L\u2192H\u2192B\u2192H\u2192M\u2192H\u2192G\nYOUR TURN12.19\n1. Recall from the Graph Basics section that a graph in which there are multiple edges between the same pair of\nvertices is called a multigraph. The figure shows a map of the four bridges that link Staten Island to Brooklyn and\nNew Jersey and a multigraph representing the map. In the multigraph, the edges are labeled instead of the\nvertices. The edges represent the bridges,G(Goethals Bridge),B(Bayonne Bridge),C(Outerbridge Crossing),\nandV(Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge). The vertices represent New Jersey, Staten Island, and Brooklyn.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1287\nMap and Multigraph of Staten Island Bridges\nA path can be named by a sequences of edges instead of a sequence of vertices.

G\u2192V\u2192B\u2192V\u2192C\nPaths and Trails\nA walk is the most basic way of navigating a graph because it has no restrictions except staying on the graph. When\nthere are restrictions on which vertices or edges we can visit, we will call the walk by a different name. For example, if we\nwant to find a walk that avoids travelling the same edge twice, we will say we want to find atrail(ordirected trail). If we\nwant to find a walk that avoids visiting the same vertex twice, we will say, we want to find apath(ordirected path).\nWalks, trails, and paths are all related.\n1. All paths are trails, but trails that visit the same vertex twice are not paths.\n2. All trails are walks, but walks in which an edge is visited twice would not be trails.\nWe can visualize the relationship as inFigure 12.78.\nFigure12.78Walks, Trails, and Paths\nLet\u2019s practice identifying walks, trails, and paths using the graphs inFigure 12.79. 1288 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.79GraphsAandK\nEXAMPLE12.20\nIdentifying Walks, Paths, and Trails\nConsider each sequence of vertices from GraphAinFigure 12.79.

First, check to see if the sequence of vertices is a walk by making sure that the vertices are consecutive. As you can\nsee inFigure 12.80, there is no edge between vertexcand vertexd.\nFigure12.80\nThis means that the sequence is not a walk. If it is not a walk, then it can\u2019t be a path and it cannot be a trail, so, it is\nnone of these.\n2. First, check to see if the sequence is a walk. As you can see inFigure 12.81, the vertices are consecutive.\nFigure12.81\nThis means that the sequence is a walk. Since the vertexbis visited twice, this walk is not a path. Since edge is\ntraveled twice, this walk is not a trail. So, the sequence is only a walk.\n3. First, check to see if the sequence is a walk. We can see inFigure 12.82that the vertices are consecutive, which\nmeans it is a walk.\nFigure12.82\nNext, check to see if any vertex is visited twice. Remember, we donotconsider beginning and ending at the same\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1289\nvertex to be visiting a vertex twice. So, no vertex was visited twice. This means we have a walk that is also a path.\nNext check to see if any edge was visited twice; none were. So, the sequence is a walk, a path, and a trail.\n4. First, check to see if the sequence is a walk. We can see inFigure 12.83that the vertices are consecutive, which\nmeans it is a walk.\nFigure12.83\nNext check to see if any vertex is visited twice. Since vertexbis visited twice, this is not a path. Finally, check to see if\nany edges are traveled twice. Since no edges are traveled twice, this is a trail. So, the sequence of vertices is a walk\nand a trail.\nYOUR TURN12.20\nConsider each sequence of vertices from GraphKin Figure 12.106.

For the trip to Orlando, you decide to purchase tickets with a layover in Key West (EYW) as shown inFigure\n12.86, but you still have to decide on the return trip. Determine if your roundtrip itinerary is a closed walk, a circuit, and/\nor a directed cycle, based on the return trip described in each part. 1292 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.86MIA to EYW to MCO\n1. You returned to Miami (MIA) by reversing your route.\n2. Your direct flight back left Orlando (MCO) but was diverted to Fort Lauderdale (FLL)! From there you flew to Tampa\n(TPA) before returning to Miami (MIA).\nSolution\n1. The whole trip wasMIA\u2192EYW\u2192MCO\u2192EYW\u2192MIA. This is a closed walk, because it is a walk that begins and ends\nat the same vertex. It is not a circuit, because it repeats edges. If it is not a circuit, then it cannot be a directed cycle.\n2. The whole trip wasMIA\u2192EYW\u2192MCO\u2192FLL\u2192TPA\u2192MIA. This is a closed walk, because it is a walk that begins and\nends at the same vertex. It is a circuit because no edges were repeated. It is also a directed cycle because no\nvertices were repeated either. So, it is all three!\nYOUR TURN12.21\nSuppose that you want to travel from Palm Beach (PBI) to any other city listed in Figure 12.113 and then return to\nPalm Beach.\n1.

How is this related to the degree of the vertex PBI?\nVIDEO\nClosed Walks, Closed Trails (Circuits), and Closed Paths (Directed Cycles) in Graph Theory(https://openstax.org/r/\nclosed_walks)\nGraph Colorings\nIn this section so far, we have looked at how to navigate graphs by proceeding from one vertex to another in a sequence\nthat does not skip any vertices, but in some applications we may want to skip vertices. Remember the camp Olympics at\nCamp Woebegone inComparing Graphs? You were planning a camp Olympics with four events. The campers signed up\nfor the events. You drew a graph to help you visualize which events have campers in common. The vertices of GraphEin\nFigure 12.87represent the events and adjacent vertices indicate that there are campers who are participating in both.\nFigure12.87Graphs of Camp Olympics\nIn this case, we do NOT want events represented by two adjacent vertices to occur in the same timeslot, because that\nwould prevent the campers who wanted to participate in both from doing so. We can use the graph inFigure 12.87to\ncount the timeslots we need so there are no conflicts. Let\u2019s assign each timeslot a different color. We could categorize\nevents that happen at 1 pm as Red; 2 pm, Purple; 3 pm, Blue; and 4 pm, Green. Then assign different colors to any pair\nof adjacent vertices to ensure that the events they represent do not end up in the same timeslot.Figure 12.88shows\nseveral of the ways to do this while obeying the rule that no pair of adjacent vertices can be the same color.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1293\nFigure12.88Graph Colorings\nInFigure 12.88, the graphs with vertices colored so that no adjacent vertices are the same color are calledgraph\ncolorings. Notice that Graph 3 has the fewest colors, which means it shows us how to have the fewest number of\ntimeslots. The events marked in red,aandd, can be held at the same time because they are not adjacent and do not\nhave conflicts. Also, the events marked in purple,bandc, can be held at the same time. We would not need green or\nblue timeslots at all!\nA graph that uses colors is called an -coloring. The smallest number of colors needed to color a particular graph is\ncalled itschromatic number.\nGraph colorings can be used in many applications like the scheduling scenario at camp Woebegone. Let's look at how\nthey work in more detail.Figure 12.89shows two different colorings of a particular graph. Coloring A is called a four-\ncoloring, because it uses four colors, red (R), green (G), blue (B), and purple (P). Coloring B is called a three-coloring\nbecause it uses three. The colors allow us to visually subdivide the graphs into groups. The only rule is that adjacent\nvertices are different colors so that they are in different groups.\nFigure12.89Two Colorings of the Same Graph\nIt turns out that a three-coloring is the best we can do with the graph inFigure 12.89. No matter how many different\npatterns you try with only two colors, you will never find one in which the adjacent vertices are always different colors. In\nother words, the graph has a chromatic number of three. For large graphs, computer assistance is usually required to\nfind the chromatic numbers. There is no formula for finding the chromatic number of a graph, but there are some facts\nthat are helpful inTable 12.5. 1294 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFact Example\nRecall that planar graphs are\nuntangled; that is, they can be\ndrawn on a flat surface so that no\ntwo edges are crossing.If a graph\nis planar, it can be colored with\nfour colors or possibly fewer.\nEach vertex in a complete graph is\nadjacent to every other vertex\nforcing us to color them all\ndifferent colors.The chromatic\nnumber of a complete graph is\nthe same as the number of\nvertices.\nIf a graph has a clique, a complete\nsubgraph, then each vertex in the\nclique must have a different color\nand the vertices outside the clique\nmay or may not have even more\ncolors.The chromatic number of\na graph isat leastthe number of\nvertices in its biggest clique.\nTable12.5Facts about Graph Colorings\nCreating Colorings to Solve Problems\nLet\u2019s see how these facts can help us color the graph inFigure 12.90.\n\u2022 Since the graph is planar, the chromatic number isno more thanfour.\n\u2022 The graph is not complete, but it has complete subgraphs of three vertices. In other words, it has triangles like the\none shown with blue vertices inFigure 12.90. This means that the chromatic number isat leastthree.\nFigure12.90A Graph with Triangles\nWe know we can color this graph in three or four colors. It is usually best to start by coloring the vertex of highest degree\nas shown inFigure 12.91. In this case, we used red (R). The color is not important.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1295\nFigure12.91Color Highest Degree Vertex First\nWe want to color as many of the vertices the same color as possible; so, we look at all the vertices that are not adjacent\nto the red vertex and begin to color them, red starting with the one among them of highest degree. Since the only\nvertices that are not adjacent are both degree 2, choose either one and color it red as shown inFigure 12.92.\nFigure12.92Color More Red from Highest to Lowest Degree\nNow, there is only one vertex left that is not adjacent to a red; so, color it red. Of the remaining vertices, the highest\ndegree is four; so, color one of the vertices of degree four in a different color. These two steps are shown inFigure 12.93.\nFigure12.93Complete the Reds and Start Another Color\nRepeat the same procedure. There are three remaining vertices that are not adjacent to a blue. Color as many blue as\npossible, with priority going to vertices of higher degree as shown inFigure 12.94.\nFigure12.94Repeat Procedure for Color Blue\nAll the remaining vertices are adjacent to blue. So, it is time to repeat the procedure with another color as shown in\nFigure 12.95. 1296 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.95Repeat Procedure for Color Purple\nAll the vertices are now colored with a three-coloring so we know the chromatic number isat mostthree, but we knew\nthe chromatic number wasat leastthree because the graph has a triangle. So, we are now certain it isexactlythree.\nVIDEO\nColoring Graphs Part 1: Coloring and Identifying Chromatic Number(https://openstax.org/r/\nColoring_and_Identifying)\nSuppose the vertices of the graph inFigure 12.96represented the nine events in the Camp Woebegone Olympics, and\nedges join any events that have campers in common, but nonadjacent vertices do not.\nFigure12.96Coloring for Nine Event Camp Woebegone Olympics\nAny vertices of the same color are nonadjacent; so, they have no conflicts. Since this graph is a three-coloring, all nine\nevents could be scheduled in just three timeslots!\nEXAMPLE12.22\nUnderstanding Chromatic Numbers\nInExample 12.17, we discussed a high school, which holds end-of-course exams in (E3) English 3, (E4) English 4, (M)\nAdvanced Math, (C) Calculus, (W) World History, (U) U.S. History, (B) Biology, and (P) Physics. We were given a list of\ncourses that had no students in common. We used that information to find the graph inFigure 12.63, which shows\nedges between exams with students in common. Use the graph we found inExample 12.17to answer each question.\nFigure12.97Graph of Exams with Students in Common\n1. The graph contains a clique of size 4 formed by the vertices P, E3, C, and U. What does this tell you about the\nchromatic number?\n2. The graph is not planar, meaning that you cannot untangle it. What does this tell you about the chromatic number?\n3.

Do you know what the minimum number of timeslots is? If so, what is it and how do you know? If not, what are the\npossibilities?\nSolution\n1. We would need four different colors just for the clique with four vertices; so, the chromatic number isat leastfour.\n2. It is possible for the chromatic number to be greater than four.\n3.

We knew the chromatic number had to be at least 1298 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nfour because there was a clique with four vertices. Now we have found a four-coloring of the graph which tells us\nthat the chromatic number is at most four. So, we know four must be the chromatic number.\nThe procedure used in Example 22 to color the graph is not guaranteed to result in a graph that has the minimum\nnumber of colors possible, but it is usually results in a coloring that is close to the chromatic number.\nYOUR TURN12.22\nThe given figure shows the same graph colored in several ways.

Draw an -coloring for the graph where is the answer to Exercise 1.\nThe Four Color Problem\nFigure12.98Using only four colors, no two adjacent regions have the same color.\nThe idea of coloring graphs to solve problems was inspired by one of the most famous problems in mathematics, the\n\u201cfour color problem.\u201d The idea was that, no matter how complicated a map might be, only four colors were needed to\ncolor the map so that no two regions that shared a boundary would be the same color. For many years, everyone\nsuspected this to be true, because no one could create a map that needed more than four colors, but they couldn\u2019t prove\nit was true in general. Finally, graphs were used to solve the problem!\nVIDEO\nThe Four Color Map Theorem \u2013 Numberphile(https://openstax.org/r/The_Four)\nWe saw how maps can be represented as graphs inGraph Basics.Figure 12.99fromExample 12.4shows a map of the\nmidwestern region of the United States.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Navigating Graphs 1299\nFigure12.99Map of Midwestern States\nFigure 12.100shows how this map can be associated with a graph in which each vertex represents a state and each edge\nindicates the states that share a common boundary.Figure 12.101shows the final graph.\nFigure12.100Edge Assigned to Each Pair of Midwestern States with Common Border\nFigure12.101Final Graph Representing Common Boundaries between Midwestern States\nNotice that the graph representing the common boundaries between midwestern states is planar, meaning that it can be\ndrawn on a flat surface without edges crossing.

This seemed to be the case for other maps as well,\nbut he could not figure out why. He shared this with his brother, Frederick, who subsequently took the problem to his\nprofessor, August De Morgan, one of the most famous mathematicians of all time. De Morgan never was able to solve\nthe problem, but he shared it with his colleagues. The problem continued to intrigue and perplex mathematicians for\nover a hundred years, inspiring discoveries in several areas of mathematics. It was finally proven by Kenneth Appel\nand Wolfgang Haken from the University of Illinois in 1976 using a combination of computer-aided calculations and\ngraph theory.

It is a flat object with only one side. This might sound theoretical, but you can\nmake one for yourself. Take a narrow strip of paper, make a half twist in it, and tape the ends together. To prove to\nyourself that it has only one side, pick a point anywhere on the paper and start drawing a line. You can draw the line\ncontinuously without lifting your pen from the paper and eventually, you will get back to the point at which you\nstarted. Since you never had to flip over the paper, you have just proved it has one side!\nNow, you might be wondering what this has to do with Graph Theory. It turns out that a map drawn on a m\u00f6bius strip\ncannot necessarily be drawn using four colors. This doesn\u2019t contradict the Four-Color Theorem, which only applies to\ngraphs that are planar. A m\u00f6bius strip does not live on a \u201cplane,\u201d or flat surface, which means the maps are not always\nplanar like those drawn on a flat piece of paper.

Evaluate Euler Circuits in real-world applications.\nThe delivery of goods is a huge part of our daily lives. From the factory to the distribution center, to the local vendor, or\nto your front door, nearly every product that you buy has been shipped multiple times to get to you. If the cost and time\nof that delivery is too great, you will not be able to afford the product. Delivery personnel have to leave from one\nlocation, deliver the goods to various places, and then return to their original location and do all of this in an organized\nway without losing money. How do delivery services find the most efficient delivery route? The answer lies in graph\ntheory.\nConnectedness\nBefore we can talk about finding the best delivery route, we have to make sure there is a route at all. For example,\nsuppose that you were tasked with visiting every airport on the graph inFigure 12.105by plane. Could you accomplish\nthat task, only taking direct flight paths between airports listed on this graph? In other words, are all the airports\nconnected by paths? Or are some of the airports disconnected from the others? 1310 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.105Major Central and South Florida Airports\nInFigure 12.105, we can see TPA is adjacent to PBI, FLL, MIA, and EYW. Also, there is a path between TPA and MCO\nthrough FLL. This indicates there is a path between each pair of vertices. So, it is possible to travel to each of these\nairports only taking direct flight paths and visiting no other airports. In other words, the graph isconnectedbecause\nthere is a path joining every pair of vertices on the graph. Notice that if one vertex is connected to each of the others in a\ngraph, then all the vertices are connected to each other. So, one way to determine if a graph is connected is to focus on a\nsingle vertex and determine if there is a path between that vertex and each of the others. If so, the graph is connected. If\nnot, the graph isdisconnected,which means at least one pair of vertices in a graph is not joined by a path. Let\u2019s take a\ncloser look at graphXinFigure 12.106. Focus on vertexa. There is a path between verticesaandb, but there is no path\nbetween vertexaand vertexc. So, GraphXis disconnected.\nFigure12.106Connected vs. Disconnected\nWhen you are working with a planar graph, you can also determine if a graph is connected by untangling it. If you draw\nit so that so that none of the edges are overlapping, like we did with GraphXinFigure 12.106, it is easier to see that the\ngraph is disconnected.\nFigure12.107Untangling GraphX\nVersions 2 and 3 of GraphXinFigure 12.107each have the same number of vertices, number of edges, degrees of the\nvertices, and pairs of adjacent vertices as version 1. In other words, each version retains the same structure as the\noriginal graph. Since versions 2 and 3 of GraphX, do not have overlapping edges, it is easier to identify pairs of vertices\nthat do not have paths between them, and it is more obvious that GraphXis disconnected. In fact, there are two\ncompletely separate, disconnected subgraphs, one with the vertices in {a, b, e}, and the other with the vertices {c, d, f}\nThese sets of vertices together with all of their edges are calledcomponentsof GraphX. A component of a graph is a\nsubgraph in which there is a path between each pair of vertices in the subgraph, but no edges between any of the\nvertices in the subgraph and a vertex that is not in the subgraph.\nNow let\u2019s focus on GraphYfromFigure 12.106. As in GraphX, there is a path between verticesaandb, as well as\nbetween verticesaande, but GraphYis different from GraphXbecause of vertexg. Not only is there a path between\nverticesaandg, but vertexgbridges the gap betweenaandcwith the patha \u2192 b \u2192 g \u2192 c. Similarly, there is a path\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Euler Circuits 1311\nbetween verticesaanddand verticesaandf:a \u2192 b \u2192 g \u2192 d,a \u2192 b \u2192 g \u2192 d \u2192 f. Since there is a path between vertexa\nand every other vertex, GraphYis connected. You can also see this a bit more clearly by untangling GraphYas inFigure\n12.108. Even whenYis drawn so that the edges do not overlap, the graph cannot be drawn as two separate,\nunconnected pieces. In other words, GraphYhas only one component with the vertices {a, b, c, d, e, f}.\nWe can give an alternate definition ofconnectedanddisconnectedusing the idea of components. A graph is connected\nif it has only one component. A graph is disconnected if it has more than one component. These alternate definitions are\nequivalent to the previous definitions. This means that you can confirm a graph is connected or disconnected either by\nchecking to see if there is a path between each vertex and each other vertex, or by identifying the number of\ncomponents. A graph is connected if it has only one component.\nFigure12.108Untangling GraphY\nEXAMPLE12.24\nDetermining If a Graph Is Connected or Disconnected\nUseFigure 12.109to answer each question.\nFigure12.109GraphE\n1.

Would this graph be connected or\ndisconnected? Explain your reasoning.\nSolution\nHawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico are geographically separate from the 48 contiguous states, and each from each other.\nThis means that there are vertices on the graph with no path joining them to the other vertices. So the graph is\ndisconnected.\nYOUR TURN12.25\n1. \u201cSix degrees of separation\u201d is the idea that any two people on Earth are connected by at most six social\nconnections.

Explain your reasoning.\nOrigin of Euler Circuits\nThe city of Konigsberg, modern day Kaliningrad, Russia, has waterways that divide up the city. In the 1700s, the city had\nseven bridges over the various waterways. The map of those bridges is shown inFigure 12.110. The question as to\nwhether it was possible to find a route that crossed each bridge exactly once and return to the starting point was known\nas the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. In 1735, one of the most influential mathematicians of all time, Leonard Euler, solved\nthe problem using an area of mathematics that he created himself, graph theory!\nFigure12.110Map of the Bridges of Konigsberg in 1700s (credit: \u201cKonigsberg Bridge\u201d by Merian Erben/Wikimedia\nCommons, Public Domain)\nEuler drew a multigraph in which each vertex represented a land mass, and each edge represented a bridge connecting\nthem, as shown inFigure 12.111. Remember fromNavigating Graphsthat a circuit is a trail, so it never repeats an edge,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Euler Circuits 1313\nand it is closed, so it begins and ends at the same vertex. Euler pointed out that the Konigsberg Bridge Problem was the\nsame as asking this graph theory question: Is it possible to find a circuit that crosses every edge? Since then, circuits (or\nclosed trails) that visit every edge in a graph exactly once have come to be known asEuler circuitsin honor of Leonard\nEuler.\nVIDEO\nRecognizing Euler Trails and Euler Circuits(https://openstax.org/r/Euler_trails_circuits)\nEuler was able to prove that, in order to have an Euler circuit, the degrees of all the vertices of a graph have to be even.\nHe also proved that any graph with that characteristic must have an Euler circuit. So, saying that a connected graph is\nEulerian is the same as saying it has vertices with all even degrees, known as theEulerian circuit theorem.\nFigure12.111Graph of Konigsberg Bridges\nTo understand why the Euler circuit theorem is true, think about a vertex of degree 3 on any graph, as shown inFigure\n12.112.\nFigure12.112A Vertex of Degree 3\nFirst imagine the vertex of degree 3 shown inFigure 12.112is not the starting vertex. At some point, each edge must be\ntraveled. The first time one of the three edges is traveled, the direction will be toward the vertex, and the second time it\nwill be away from the vertex. Then, at some point, the third edge must be traveled coming in toward the vertex again.\nThis is a problem, because the only way to get back to the starting vertex is to then visit one of the three edges a second\ntime. So, this vertex cannot be part of an Euler circuit.\nNext imagine the vertex of degree 3 shown inFigure 12.112is the starting vertex. The first time one of the edges is\ntraveled, the direction is away from the vertex. At some point, the second edge will be traveled coming in toward the\nvertex, and the third edge will be the way back out, but the starting vertex is also the ending vertex in a circuit. The only\nway to return to the vertex is now to travel one of the edges a second time. So, again, this vertex cannot be part of an\nEuler circuit.\nFor the same reason that a vertex of degree 3 can never be part of an Euler circuit, a vertex of any odd degree cannot\neither. We can use this fact and the graph inFigure 12.113to solve the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. Since the degrees of\nthe vertices of the graph inFigure 12.112are not even, the graph is not Eulerian and it cannot have an Euler circuit. This\nmeans it is not possible to travel through the city of Konigsberg, crossing every bridge exactly once, and returning to\nyour starting position. 1314 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.113Degrees of Vertices in Konigsberg Bridge Multigraph\nVIDEO\nExistence of Euler Circuits in Graph Theory(https://openstax.org/r/existence_Euler_circuits)\nChinese Postman Problem\nAt Camp Woebegone, campers travel the waterways in canoes. As part of the Camp Woebegone Olympics, you will hold\na canoeing race. You have placed a checkpoint on each of the 11 different streams. The competition requires each team\nto travel each stream, pass through the checkpoints in any order, and return to the starting line, as shown in theFigure\n12.114.\nFigure12.114Map of Canoe Event Checkpoints\nSince the teams want to go as fast as possible, they would like to find the shortest route through the course that visits\neach checkpoint and returns to the starting line. If possible, they would also like to avoid backtracking. Let\u2019s visualize the\ncourse as a multigraph in which the vertices represent turns and the edges represent checkpoints as inFigure 12.115.\nFigure12.115Multigraph of Canoe Event\nThe teams would like to find a closed walk that repeats as few edges as possible while still visiting every edge. If they\nnever repeat an edge, then they have found a closed trail, which is a circuit. That circuit must cover all edges; so, it would\nbe an Euler circuit. The task of finding a shortest circuit that visits every edge of a connected graph is often referred to as\ntheChinese postman problem. The name Chinese postman problem was coined in honor of the Chinese\nmathematician named Kwan Mei-Ko in 1960 who first studied the problem.\nIf a graph has an Euler circuit, that will always be the best solution to a Chinese postman problem. Let\u2019s determine if the\nmultigraph of the course has an Euler circuit by looking at the degrees of the vertices inFigure 12.116. Since the degrees\nof the vertices are all even, and the graph is connected, the graph is Eulerian.

Justify your answer.\nIdentifying Euler Circuits\nSolving the Chinese postman problem requires finding a shortest circuit through any graph or multigraph that visits\nevery edge. In the case of Eulerian graphs, this means finding an Euler circuit. The method we will use is to find any\ncircuit in the graph, then find a second circuit starting at a vertex from the first circuit that uses only edges that were not\nin the first circuit, then find a third circuit starting at a vertex from either of the first two circuits that uses only edges that\nwere not in the first two circuits, and then continue this process until all edges have been used. In the end, you will be\nable to link all the circuits together into one large Euler circuit.\nLet\u2019s find an Euler circuit in the map of the Camp Woebegone canoe race. InFigure 12.119, we have labeled the edges of\nthe multigraph so that the circuits can be named. In a multigraph it is necessary to name circuits using edges and\nvertices because there can be more than one edge between adjacent vertices.\nFigure12.119Multigraph of Canoe Race with Vertices and Edges Labeled\nWe will begin with vertex 1 because it represents the starting line in this application. In general, you can start at any\nvertex you want. Find any circuit beginning and ending with vertex 1.

Recall the postal delivery person who needed to\ndeliver mail to every block of every street in a subdivision. We used the map inFigure 12.126to create the graph in\nFigure 12.127.\nFigure12.126Map of Subdivision\nFigure12.127Graph of Subdivision\nSince the graph of the subdivision has vertices of odd degree, there is no Euler circuit. This means that there is no route\nthrough the subdivision that visits every block of every street without repeating a block. What should our delivery person\ndo? They need to repeat as few blocks as possible. The technique we will use to find a closed walk that repeats as few\nedges as possible is calledeulerization. This method adds duplicate edges to a graph to create vertices of even degree\nso that the graph will have an Euler circuit.\nInFigure 12.128, the eight vertices of odd degree in the graph of the subdivision are circled in green. We have added\nduplicate edges between the pairs of vertices, which changes the degrees of the vertices to even degrees so the\nresulting multigraph has an Euler circuit. In other words, we have eulerized the graph.\nFigure12.128An Eulerized Graph\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Euler Circuits 1321\nThe duplicate edges in the eulerized graph correspond to blocks that our delivery person would have to travel twice. By\nkeeping these duplicate edges to a minimum, we ensure the shortest possible route. It can be challenging to determine\nthe fewest duplicate edges needed to eulerize a graph, but you can never do better than half the number of odd\nvertices. In the graph inFigure 12.128, we have found a way to fix the eight vertices of odd degree with only four\nduplicate edges. Since four is half of eight, we will never do better.\nIMPORTANT! The duplicate edges that we add indicate places where the route will pass twice. An entirely new edge\nbetween two vertices that were not previously adjacent would indicate that our postal delivery person created a new\nroad through someone\u2019s property! So,we can duplicate existing edges, but we cannot create new ones.\nEXAMPLE12.28\nEulerizing Graphs\nUse GraphAand multigraphsB,C,D, andEgiven inFigure 12.129to answer the questions.\nFigure12.129GraphAand MultigraphsBthroughE\n1.

(credit: \u201cMap of Pony Express\u201d by\nNathan Hughes Hamiltonh/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Describe and identify Euler trails.\n2. Solve applications using Euler trails theorem.\n3. Identify bridges in a graph.\n4. Apply Fleury\u2019s algorithm.\n5. Evaluate Euler trails in real-world applications.\nWe used Euler circuits to help us solve problems in which we needed a route that started and ended at the same place.\nIn many applications, it is not necessary for the route to end where it began. In other words, we may not be looking at\ncircuits, but trails, like the old Pony Express trail that led from Sacramento, California in the west to St. Joseph, Missouri\nin the east, never backtracking.\nEuler Trails\nIf we need a trail that visits every edge in a graph, this would be called anEuler trail. Since trails are walks that do not\nrepeat edges, an Euler trail visits every edge exactly once.\nEXAMPLE12.29\nRecognizing Euler Trails\nUseFigure 12.132to determine if each series of vertices represents a trail, an Euler trail, both, or neither.

It is a trail only. It is a trail because it is a walk that doesn\u2019t cover any edges twice, but it is not an Euler trail because\nit didn\u2019t cover edgesadordg.\n2. It is neither. It is not a trail because it visitsabandbetwice. Since it is not a trail, it cannot be an Euler trail.\n3. It is both. It is a trail because it is a walk that doesn\u2019t cover any edges twice, and it is an Euler trail because it visits all\nthe edges.\nYOUR TURN12.29\nUse the figure to determine if each sequence of vertices represents an Euler trail or not.

For example, inFigure 12.132,\nGraphHhas exactly two vertices of odd degree, vertexgand vertexe. Notice the Euler trail we saw in Excercise 3 of\nExample 12.29began at vertexgand ended at vertexe.\nThis is consistent with what we learned about vertices off odd degree when we were studying Euler circuits. We saw that\na vertex of odd degree couldn't exist in an Euler circuit as depicted inFigure 12.133. If it was a starting vertex, at some\npoint we would leave the vertex and not be able to return without repeating an edge. If it was not a starting vertex, at\nsome point we would return and not be able to leave without repeating an edge. Since the starting and ending vertices\nin an Euler trail are not the same, the start is a vertex we want to leave without returning, and the end is a vertex we\nwant to return to and never leave. Those two vertices must have odd degree, but the others cannot.\nFigure12.133A Vertex of Degree 3\nLet\u2019s use the Euler trail theorem to solve a puzzle so you can amaze your friends! This puzzle is called the \u201cFive Rooms\nPuzzle.\u201d Suppose that you were in a house with five rooms and the exterior. There is a doorway in every shared wall\nbetween any two rooms and between any room and the exterior as shown inFigure 12.134. Could you find a route\nthrough the house that passes through each doorway exactly once? 1328 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.134Five Rooms Puzzle\nLet\u2019s represent the puzzle with a graph in which vertices are rooms (or the exterior) and an edge indicates a door\nbetween two rooms as shown inFigure 12.135.\nFigure12.135Graph of Five Rooms Puzzle\nTo pass through each doorway exactly once means that we cross every edge in the graph exactly once. Since we have\nnot been asked to start and end at the same position, but to visit each edge exactly once, we are looking for an Euler\ntrail. Let\u2019s check the degrees of the vertices.\nFigure12.136Degrees of Vertices in Five Rooms Puzzle\nSince there are more than two vertices of odd degree as shown inFigure 12.136, the graph of the five rooms puzzle\ncontains no Euler path. Now you can amaze and astonish your friends!\nBridges and Local Bridges\nNow that we know which graphs have Euler trails, let\u2019s work on a method to find them. The method we will use involves\nidentifyingbridgesin our graphs. A bridge is an edge which, if removed, increases the number of components in a\ngraph. Bridges are often referred to as cut-edges. InFigure 12.137, there are several examples of bridges. Notice that an\nedge that is not part of a cycle is always a bridge, and an edge that is part of a cycle is never a bridge.\nFigure12.137Graph with Bridges\nEdgesbf,cg, anddgare \u201cbridges\u201d\nThe graph inFigure 12.137is connected, which means it has exactly one component. Each time we remove one of the\nbridges from the graph the number of components increases by one as shown inFigure 12.138. If we remove all three,\nthe resulting graph inFigure 12.138has four components.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.6 \u2022 Euler Trails 1329\nFigure12.138Removing a Bridge Increases Number of Components\nIn sociology, bridges are a key part of social network analysis. Sociologists study two kinds of bridges: local bridges and\nregular bridges. Regular bridges are defined the same in sociology as in graph theory, but they are unusual when\nstudying a large social network because it is very unlikely a group of individuals in a large social network has only one\nlink to the rest of the network. On the other hand, alocal bridgeoccurs much more frequently. A local bridge is a\nfriendship between two individuals who have no other friends in common. If they lose touch, there is no single individual\nwho can pass information between them. In graph theory, alocal bridgeis an edge between two vertices, which, when\nremoved, increases the length of the shortest path between its vertices to more than two edges. InFigure 12.139, a local\nbridge between verticesbandehas been removed. As a result, the shortest path betweenbandeisb\u2192i\u2192j\u2192k\u2192e,\nwhich is four edges. On the other hand, if edgeabwere removed, then there are still paths betweenaandbthat cover\nonly two edges, likea\u2192i\u2192b.\nFigure12.139Removing a Local Bridge\nThe significance of a local bridge in sociology is that it is the shortest communication route between two groups of\npeople. If the local bridge is removed, the flow of information from one group to another becomes more difficult. Let\u2019s\nsay that vertexbis Brielle and vertexeis Ella. Now, Brielle is less likely to hear about things like job opportunities, that\nElla many know about. This is likely to impact Brielle as well as the friends of Brielle.\nEXAMPLE12.30\nIdentifying Bridges and Local Bridges\nUse the graph of a social network inFigure 12.140to answer each question.\nFigure12.140Graph of a Social Network\n1. Identify any bridges.\n2. If all bridges were removed, how many components would there be in the resulting graph?\n3. Identify one local bridge.\n4.

Here are the steps\ninvolved in applying Fleury\u2019s algorithm.\nHere are the steps involved in applying Fleury\u2019s algorithm.\nStep 1:Begin at either of the two vertices of odd degree.\nStep 2:Remove an edge between the vertex and any adjacent vertex that is NOT a bridge, unless there is no other\nchoice, making a note of the edge you removed. Repeat this step until all edges are removed.\nStep 3:Write out the Euler trail using the sequence of vertices and edges that you found. For example, if you removed\nab, bc, cd, de, andef, in that order, then the Euler trail isa\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192e\u2192f.\nFigure 12.142shows the steps to find an Euler trail in a graph using Fleury\u2019s algorithm.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.6 \u2022 Euler Trails 1331\nFigure12.142Using Fleury\u2019s Algorithm To Find Euler Trail\nThe Euler trail that was found inFigure 12.142ist\u2192v\u2192w\u2192u\u2192t\u2192w\u2192y\u2192x\u2192v.\nEXAMPLE12.31\nFinding an Euler Trail with Fleury\u2019s Algorithm\nUse Fleury\u2019s Algorithm to find an Euler trail for GraphJinFigure 12.143.\nFigure12.143GraphJ\nSolution\nStep 1:Choose one of the two vertices of odd degree,corf, as your starting vertex.

Describe and identify Hamilton cycles.\n2. Compute the number of Hamilton cycles in a complete graph.\n3. Apply and evaluate weighted graphs.\nInEuler CircuitsandEuler Trails, we looked for circuits and paths that visited eachedgeof a graph exactly once. In this\nsection, we will look for circuits that visit eachvertexexactly once. Like many concepts in graph theory, the idea of a\ncircuit that visits each vertex once was inspired by games and puzzles. As early as the 9th century, Indian and Islamic\nintellectuals wondered whether it was possible for a knight to visit every space on a chess board of a given size, which is\nequivalent to visiting every vertex of a graph that represents the chess board.\nIn 1857, a mathematician named William Rowan Hamilton invented a puzzle in which players were asked to find a route\nalong the edges of a dodecahedron (seeFigure 12.156), which visited every vertex exactly once. Let\u2019s explore how graph\ntheory provides insight into these games as well as practical applications such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem.\nFigure12.156A Dodecahedron\nHamilton\u2019s Puzzle\nBefore we look at the solution to Hamilton's puzzle, let\u2019s review some vocabulary we used inFigure 12.157. It will be\nhelpful to remember that directed cycle is a type of circuit that doesn\u2019t repeat any edges or vertices.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.7 \u2022 Hamilton Cycles 1341\nFigure12.157Closed Walks, Circuits, and Directed Cycles\nThe goal of Hamilton's puzzle was to find a route along the edges of the dodecahedron, which visits each vertex exactly\nonce. A dodecahedron is a three-dimensional space figure with faces that are all pentagons as we saw inFigure 12.156.\nSince it is easier to visualize two dimensions rather than three, we will flatten out the dodecahedron and look at the\nedges and vertices on a flat surface. GraphAinFigure 12.158shows a two-dimensional graph of the edges and vertices,\nand GraphBshows an untangled version of GraphAin which no edges are crossing. GraphBinFigure 12.158is very\nsimilar to the design of the game board that Hamilton invented for his puzzle.\nUntangle graph\nFigure12.158Graph of Edges and Vertices of Dodecahedron\nWe can see that this is a planar graph because it can be \u201cuntangled.\u201d In order to solve Hamilton\u2019s puzzle, we need to find\na circuit that visits every vertex once. A solution is shown inFigure 12.159.\n>\nIn three Dimensions\nFigure12.159A Solution to Hamilton\u2019s Puzzle\nA circuit that doesn\u2019t repeat any vertices, like the one inFigure 12.159, is called a directed cycle. So, we can most\naccurately say that Hamilton\u2019s puzzle asks us to find a directed cycle that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once.\nBecause Hamilton created and solved this puzzle, these special circuits were namedHamilton cycles, orHamilton 1342 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\ncircuits.\nWHO KNEW?\nIcosian Game\nWhen Hamilton invented his puzzle in the 19th century, it was originally called the Icosian game. This was a reference\nto an icosahedron, not a dodecahedron. Why? Hamilton was actually interested in the symmetries of icosahedrons. It\nturns out that these two space figures are related to each other. The dodecahedron has 30 edges, 20 faces, and 12\nvertices, while the icosahedron has 30 edges, 12 faces, and 20 vertices. By relating the vertices of the dodecahedron\nto the faces of the icosahedron, Hamilton was able to make the mathematical connections necessary to use graph\ntheory and dodecahedrons to make discoveries about the symmetries of icosahedrons.\nHamilton Cycles vs. Euler Circuits\nLet\u2019s practice naming and identifying Hamilton cycles, as well as distinguishing them from Euler circuits. It is important\nto remember that Euler circuits visit all edges without repetition, while Hamilton cycles visit all vertices without\nrepetition. Hamilton cycles are named by their vertices just like all circuits. An example is given inFigure 12.160.\nFigure12.160Hamilton Cycle in GraphZ\nNotice that the Hamilton cyclea\u2192b\u2192c\u2192dfor GraphZinFigure 12.160is NOT an Euler circuit, because it does not visit\nedge . Some Hamilton cycles are also Euler circuits while some are not, and some Euler circuits are Hamilton cycles\nwhile some are not.\nTIP! Sometimes students confuse Euler circuits with Hamilton cycles. To help you remember, think of the E in Euler\nas standing for Edge.\nEXAMPLE12.33\nDifferentiating between Hamilton Cycles or Euler Circuits\nUseFigure 12.161to determine whether the given circuit is a Hamilton cycle, an Euler circuit, both, or neither.\nFigure12.161GraphQ\n1. a\u2192b\u2192c\u2192e\u2192h\u2192g\u2192f\u2192d\u2192a\n2. g\u2192e\u2192h\u2192g\u2192f\u2192d\u2192a\u2192b\u2192d\u2192g\n3. a\u2192b\u2192c\u2192e\u2192h\u2192g\u2192f\u2192d\u2192b\u2192e\u2192g\u2192d\u2192a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.7 \u2022 Hamilton Cycles 1343\nSolution\n1. This circuit is a Hamilton cycle only. It visits each vertex exactly once, so, it is a Hamilton cycle. It is not an Euler\ncircuit because it doesn\u2019t visit all of the edges.\n2. This circuit is neither Hamilton cycle nor an Euler circuit. It doesn\u2019t visit vertex , so, it is not a Hamilton cycle. It also\ndoesn\u2019t visit edges and , so, it is not an Euler circuit.\n3. This circuit is an Euler circuit only. It visits several vertices more than once; so, it is not a Hamilton cycle. It visits\nevery edge exactly once, so, it is an Euler circuit.\nTIP! Euler circuits never skip a vertex, so, they only fail to be Hamilton cycles when they visit a vertex more than\nonce. Hamilton cycles never visit any edges twice, so, they only fail to be Euler circuits when they skip edges.\nYOUR TURN12.33\n1. Consider the figure shown. Is the circuita\u2192b\u2192f\u2192e\u2192h\u2192i\u2192g\u2192d\u2192c\u2192aan Euler circuit, a Hamilton cycle,\nor both?\nGraphT\nNotice that the graph is a cycle. A cycle will always be Eulerian because all vertices are degree 2. Moreover, any circuit in\nthe graph will always be both an Euler circuit and a Hamilton cycle. It is not always as easy to determine if a graph has a\nHamilton cycle as it is to see that it has an Euler circuit, but there is a large group of graphs that we know will always\nhave Hamilton cycles, the complete graphs. Since all vertices in a complete graph are adjacent, we can always find a\ndirected cycle that visits all the vertices. For example, look at the directed six-cycle,n\u2192o\u2192p\u2192q\u2192r\u2192s, in the\ncomplete graph with six vertices inFigure 12.162.\nFigure12.162Directed Cycle in Complete Graph\nThat is not the only directed six-cycle in the graph though. We could find another just be reversing the direction, and we\ncould find even more by using different edges. So, how many Hamilton cycles are in a complete graph with vertices?\nBefore we tackle this problem, let\u2019s look at a shorthand notation that we use in mathematics which will be helpful to us.\nFactorials\nIn many areas of mathematics, we must calculate products like or ,\nproducts that involve multiplying all the counting numbers from a particular number down to 1. Imagine that the\nproduct happened to be all the numbers from 100 down to 1. That\u2019s a lot of writing! Instead of writing all of that out,\nmathematicians came up with a shorthand notation. For example, instead of , we write , which is\nread \u201c7factorial.\u201d In other words, the product of all the counting numbers from down to 1 is called factorial and it is 1344 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nwritten\nEXAMPLE12.34\nEvaluating Factorials\nEvaluate and for .\nSolution\nand\nYOUR TURN12.34\n1.

InTable 12.8, we\nhave drawn all the four cycles in a complete graph with four vertices. Remember, cycles can be named starting with any\nvertex in the cycle, but we will name them starting with vertex .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.7 \u2022 Hamilton Cycles 1345\nComplete Graph Cycle Cycle Cycle\nCycle Name Clockwise (a, b, c, d) (a, b, d, c) (a, c, b, d)\nCycle Name Counterclockwise (a, d, c, b) (a, c, d, b) (a, d, b, c)\nTable12.8Four-Cycles in Complete Graph with Four Vertices\nTable 12.8shows that there are three unique four-cycles in a complete graph with four vertices. Notice that there were\ntwo ways to name each cycle, one reading the vertices in a clockwise direction and one reading the vertices in a\ncounterclockwise direction. This is important to us because we are interested in Hamilton cycles, which aredirected\ncycles. Although the cycles(a, b, c, d)and(a, d, c, b)are the same cycle, the directed cycles,a\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192aanda\u2192d\n\u2192c\u2192b\u2192a, which travel the same route in reverse order are considered different directed cycles, as shown inTable\n12.9.\nComplete Graph Cycle Cycle Cycle\nClockwise Hamilton Cycle\na\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192a a\u2192b\u2192d\u2192c\u2192a a\u2192c\u2192b\u2192d\u2192a\nCounter-clockwise Hamilton Cycle\na\u2192d\u2192c\u2192b\u2192a a\u2192c\u2192d\u2192b\u2192a a\u2192d\u2192b\u2192c\u2192a\nTable12.9Hamilton Cycles in a Complete Graph with Four Vertices\nThe six directed four-cycles inTable 12.9are the only distinct Hamilton cycles in a complete graph with four vertices.

Similarly, the number of Hamilton cycles in a graph with five vertices is the number of\nways to arrange four letters, which is . In general, to find the number of Hamilton cycles in a graph,\nwe take one less than the number of vertices and find its factorial. 1346 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFORMULA\nThe number of distinct Hamilton cycles in a complete graph with vertices is\nEXAMPLE12.36\nCounting Hamilton Cycles in a Complete Graph\nHow many Hamilton cycles are in the complete graph inFigure 12.163?\nFigure12.163Complete GraphL\nSolution\nThere are five vertices in the graph.

(ThisU.S.city put an algorithm in charge of its school bus routes and saved $5 million, Sean Fleming,\nWorld Economic Forum)\nThe problem the Quantum Team tackled involves graph theory. Imagine a graph in which vertices are the bus depot, the\nschool, and the bus stops along a particular route. The bus must start at the depot, visit every stop exactly once, and end\nat the school. The route is a special kind of path that visits every vertex exactly once. Can you guess what those paths are\ncalled? 1352 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nHamilton Paths\nJust as circuits that visit each vertex in a graph exactly once are called Hamilton cycles (or Hamilton circuits), paths that\nvisit each vertex on a graph exactly once are calledHamilton paths. As we explore Hamilton paths, you might find it\nhelpful to refresh your memory about the relationships between walks, trails, and paths by looking atFigure 12.166. We\nknow that paths are walks that don\u2019t repeat any vertices or edges. So, a Hamilton path visits every vertex without\nrepeating any vertices or edges.Figure 12.167shows a path from vertexAto vertexEand a Hamilton path from vertexA\nto vertexE.\nFigure12.166Walks, Trails, and Paths\nFigure12.167Path or Hamilton Path?\nEXAMPLE12.38\nIdentifying Hamilton Paths\nWhich of the following sequences of vertices is a Hamilton path for GraphQinFigure 12.168?\nFigure12.168GraphQ\n1. a\u2192d\u2192b\u2192c\u2192e\u2192g\u2192f\n2. c\u2192b\u2192e\u2192h\u2192g\u2192f\u2192d\u2192a\n3. h\u2192e\u2192g\u2192d\u2192b\u2192e\u2192g\u2192f\u2192d\u2192a\u2192b\u2192c\nSolution\nSequence 1 is a path, because it is a walk that doesn\u2019t repeat any vertices or edges, but not a Hamilton path because it\nskips vertexh. Sequence 2 is a path that visits each vertex exactly once; so, it is a Hamilton path. Sequence 3 is a walk,\nbut it is not a path because it visits verticesg,e, andbeach more than once; so, it cannot be a Hamilton path.

Use Figure 12.253 to find a Hamilton path between verticesCandE.\nExistence of a Hamilton Path\nIt turns out that there is no Hamilton path between verticesAandEin GraphGinFigure 12.177. To understand why, let\u2019s\nimagine there is a red apple tree on one side of a bridge and a green apple tree on the other side of the bridge. Now\nsuppose someone asked you to pick up all the fallen apples under each tree without crossing the bridge more than once,\nand making sure that the first apple you pick up and the last apple you pick up are both red. You would say, that is\nimpossible! To have the first and last apple be red would either require leaving the green apples on the ground or\ncrossing the bridge twice.\nLet\u2019s see how this relates to finding a Hamilton path betweenAandEin GraphG. The edgeACis a bridge because, if it\nwere removed, the graph would become disconnected with two components, the component {C} and the component {A,\nB,D,E,F}. So, we can think of the verticesA,B,D,E, andFas the red apples, vertexCas the green apple, and the edge\nACis the bridge between them as inFigure 12.178.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.8 \u2022 Hamilton Paths 1357\nFigure12.178Bridge between Red and Green Apples\nThe creation of a Hamilton path requires a visit to each vertex, just as picking up all the apples requires a visit to each\napple.AandEare both red apples; so, a path fromAtoEwould both start and end at a red apple, just as you were asked\nto do. And you wouldn\u2019t be able to cross the bridge twice because that would mean visitingAtwice, which is not allowed\nin a Hamilton path. So, it is impossible to find a Hamilton path fromAtoEjust as it was impossible to pick up all the\napples without crossing the bridge more than once. By the same reasoning, if a graph has a bridge, there will never be a\nHamilton path that begins and ends on the same side of that bridge, meaning beginning and ending at vertices that\nwould be in the same component if the bridge were removed from the graph.\nEXAMPLE12.40\nFinding a Hamilton Path If One Exists\nFind a Hamilton path from vertexsto vertexvfor each graph inFigure 12.179or indicate that there is none.\nFigure12.179GraphsA,B,C, andD\nSolution\nGraphA: Edgeuwis a bridge connecting component {s,t,u,v} to the component {w,x,y,z}.

Besides the many routing applications in which we need the shortest distance, there are also\napplications in which we search for the route that is least expensive or takes the least time.

We have solved many problems in\nthis chapter, and the procedures that we used were different types of algorithms. In this section, we will use two\ncommon types of algorithms, abrute force algorithmand agreedy algorithm. A brute force algorithm begins by\nlisting every possible solution and applying each one until the best solution is found. A greedy algorithm approaches a\nproblem in stages, making the apparent best choice at each stage, then linking the choices together into an overall\nsolution which may or may not be the best solution.\nTo understand the difference between these two algorithms, consider the tree diagram inFigure 12.187. Suppose we\nwant to find the path from left to right with the largest total sum. For example, branch A in the tree diagram has a sum\nof .\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1365\nFigure12.187Points Along Different Paths\nTo be certain that you pick the branch with greatest sum, you could list each sum from each of the different branches:\nA:\nB:\nC:\nD:\nE:\nF:\nG:\nH:\nThen we know with certainty that branchEhas the greatest sum.\nFigure12.188BranchE\nNow suppose that you wanted to find the branch with the highest value, but you only were shown the tree diagram in\nphases, one step at a time. 1366 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.189Tree Diagram Phase 1\nAfter phase 1, you would have chosen the branch with 10 and 7. So far, you are following the same branch. Let\u2019s look at\nthe next phase.\nFigure12.190Tree Diagram Phase 2\nAfter phase 2, based on the information you have, you will choose the branch with 10, 7 and 4. Now, you are following a\ndifferent branch than before, but it is the best choice based on the information you have. Let\u2019s look at the last phase.\nFigure12.191Tree Diagram Phase 3\nAfter phase 3, you will choose branchGwhich has a sum of 32.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1367\nThe process of adding the values on each branch and selecting the highest sum is an example of a brute force algorithm\nbecause all options were explored in detail. The process of choosing the branch in phases, based on the best choice at\neach phase is a greedy algorithm. Although a brute force algorithm gives us the ideal solution, it can take a very long\ntime to implement. Imagine a tree diagram with thousands or even millions of branches. It might not be possible to\ncheck all the sums. A greedy algorithm, on the other hand, can be completed in a relatively short time, and generally\nleads to good solutions, but not necessarily the ideal solution.\nEXAMPLE12.42\nDistinguishing between Brute Force and Greedy Algorithms\nA cashier rings up a sale for $4.63 cents in U.S. currency. The customer pays with a $5 bill. The cashier would like to give\nthe customer $0.37 in change using the fewest coins possible. The coins that can be used are quarters ($0.25), dimes\n($0.10), nickels ($0.05), and pennies ($0.01). The cashier starts by selecting the coin of highest value less than or equal to\n$0.37, which is a quarter. This leaves . The cashier selects the coin of highest value less than or\nequal to $0.12, which is a dime. This leaves . The cashier selects the coin of highest value less than\nor equal to $0.02, which is a penny. This leaves . The cashier selects the coin of highest value less\nthan or equal to $0.01, which is a penny. This leaves no remainder. The cashier used one quarter, one dime, and two\npennies, which is four coins. Use this information to answer the following questions.\n1. Is the cashier\u2019s approach an example of a greedy algorithm or a brute force algorithm? Explain how you know.\n2. The cashier\u2019s solution is the best solution. In other words, four is the fewest number of coins possible. Is this\nconsistent with the results of an algorithm of this kind? Explain your reasoning.\nSolution\n1. The approach the cashier used is an example of a greedy algorithm, because the problem was approached in\nphases and the best choice was made at each phase. Also, it is not a brute force algorithm, because the cashier did\nnot attempt to list out all possible combinations of coins to reach this conclusion.\n2. Yes, it is consistent. A greedy algorithm does not always yield the best result, but sometimes it does.\nYOUR TURN12.42\n1. Suppose that you lost the combination to a combination lock that consisted of three digits, and each was\nselected from the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. You desperately need to open the lock without breaking it. You\ndecide to check all possible combinations methodically, 000, then 001, then 002, and so on until you find the\nright combination. Is this an example of a brute force algorithm or a greedy algorithm?\nThe Traveling Salesperson Problem\nNow let\u2019s focus our attention on the graph theory application known as thetraveling salesperson problem (TSP)in\nwhich we must find the shortest route to visit a number of locations and return to the starting point.\nRecall fromHamilton Cycles, the officer in the U.S. Air Force who is stationed at Vandenberg Air Force base and must\ndrive to visit three other California Air Force bases before returning to Vandenberg. The officer needed to visit each base\nonce. We looked at the weighted graph inFigure 12.192representing the four U.S. Air Force bases: Vandenberg,\nEdwards, Los Angeles, and Beal and the distances between them.\nFigure12.192Graph of Four California Air Force Bases 1368 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nAny route that visits each base and returns to the start would be a Hamilton cycle on the graph. If the officer wants to\ntravel the shortest distance, this will correspond to a Hamilton cycle of lowest weight. We saw inTable 12.11that there\nare six distinct Hamilton cycles (directed cycles) in a complete graph with four vertices, but some lie on the same cycle\n(undirected cycle) in the graph.\nComplete Graph Cycle Cycle Cycle\nClockwise Hamilton Cycle\na\u2192b\u2192c\u2192d\u2192a a\u2192b\u2192d\u2192c\u2192a a\u2192c\u2192b\u2192d\u2192a\nCounterclockwise Hamilton Cycle\na\u2192d\u2192c\u2192b\u2192a a\u2192c\u2192d\u2192b\u2192a a\u2192d\u2192b\u2192c\u2192a\nTable12.11Hamilton Cycles in a Complete Graph with Four Vertices\nSince the distance between bases is the same in either direction, it does not matter if the officer travels clockwise or\ncounterclockwise. So, there are really only three possible distances as shown inFigure 12.193.\nFigure12.193Three Possible Distances\nThe possible distances are:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1369\nSo, a Hamilton cycle of least weight isV\u2192B\u2192E\u2192L\u2192V(or the reverse direction). The officer should travel from\nVandenberg to Beal to Edwards, to Los Angeles, and back to Vandenberg.\nFinding Weights of All Hamilton Cycles in Complete Graphs\nNotice that we listed all of the Hamilton cycles and found their weights when we solved the TSP about the officer from\nVandenberg. This is a skill you will need to practice. To make sure you don't miss any, you can calculate the number of\npossible Hamilton cycles in a complete graph. It is also helpful to know that half of the directed cycles in a complete\ngraph are the same cycle in reverse direction, so, you only have to calculate half the number of possible weights, and the\nrest are duplicates.\nFORMULA\nIn a complete graph with vertices,\n\u2022 The number of distinct Hamilton cycles is .\n\u2022 There are at most different weights of Hamilton cycles.\nTIP! When listing all the distinct Hamilton cycles in a complete graph, you can start them all at any vertex you\nchoose. Remember, the cyclea\u2192b\u2192c\u2192ais the same cycle asb\u2192c\u2192a\u2192bso there is no need to list both.\nEXAMPLE12.43\nCalculating Possible Weights of Hamilton Cycles\nSuppose you have a complete weighted graph with verticesN, M, O, andP.\n1. Use the formula to calculate the number of distinct Hamilton cycles in the graph.\n2. Use the formula to calculate the greatest number of different weights possible for the Hamilton cycles.\n3. Are all of the distinct Hamilton cycles listed here? How do you know?\nCycle 1:N\u2192M\u2192O\u2192P\u2192N\nCycle 2:N\u2192M\u2192P\u2192O\u2192N\nCycle 3:N\u2192O\u2192M\u2192P\u2192N\nCycle 4:N\u2192O\u2192P\u2192M\u2192N\nCycle 5:N\u2192P\u2192M\u2192O\u2192N\nCycle 6:N\u2192P\u2192O\u2192M\u2192N\n4. Which pairs of cycles must have the same weights? How do you know?\nSolution\n1. There are 4 vertices; so, . This means there are distinct Hamilton cycles\nbeginning at any given vertex.\n2. Since , there are possible weights.\n3. Yes, they are all distinct cycles and there are 6 of them.\n4. Cycles 1 and 6 have the same weight, Cycles 2 and 4 have the same weight, and Cycles 3 and 5 have the same\nweight, because these pairs follow the same route through the graph but in reverse.\nTIP! When listing the possible cycles, ignore the vertex where the cycle begins and ends and focus on the ways to\narrange the letters that represent the vertices in the middle. Using a systematic approach is best; for example, if you\nmust arrange the letters M, O, and P, first list all those arrangements beginning with M, then beginning with O, and\nthen beginning with P, as we did in Example 12.42.\nYOUR TURN12.43\n1. A complete weighted graph has verticesV,W,X,Y, andZ. List all the distinct Hamilton cycles. UseVas the\nstarting vertex. Identify the pairs of cycles that have the same weight because they are reverses of each other. 1370 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nThe Brute Force Method\nThe method we have been using to find a Hamilton cycle of least weight in a complete graph is a brute force algorithm,\nso it is called thebrute force method. The steps in the brute force method are:\nStep 1:Calculate the number of distinct Hamilton cycles and the number of possible weights.\nStep 2:List all possible Hamilton cycles.\nStep 3:Find the weight of each cycle.\nStep 4:Identify the Hamilton cycle of lowest weight.\nEXAMPLE12.44\nApplying the Brute Force Method\nOn the next assignment, the air force officer must leave from Travis Air Force base, visit Beal, Edwards, and Vandenberg\nAir Force bases each exactly once and return to Travis Air Force base. There is no need to visit Los Angeles Air Force base.\nUseFigure 12.194to find the shortest route.\nFigure12.194Distances between Five California Air Force Bases\nSolution\nStep 1:Since there are 4 vertices, there will be cycles, but half of them will be the reverse of the others;\nso, there will be possible distances.\nStep 2:List all the Hamilton cycles in the subgraph of the graph inFigure 12.195.\nFigure12.195Subgraph with CitiesB, E, T, andV\nTo find the 6 cycles, focus on the three vertices in the middle,B, E,andV. The arrangements of these vertices areBEV,\nBVE, EBV, EVB, VBE, andVEB. These would correspond to the 6 cycles:\n1:T\u2192B\u2192E\u2192V\u2192T\n2:T\u2192B\u2192V\u2192E\u2192T\n3:T\u2192E\u2192B\u2192V\u2192T\n4:T\u2192E\u2192V\u2192B\u2192T\n5:T\u2192V\u2192B\u2192E\u2192T\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1371\n6:T\u2192V\u2192E\u2192B\u2192T\nStep 3:Find the weight of each path. You can reduce your work by observing the cycles that are reverses of each other.\n1:\n2:\n3:\n4: Reverse of cycle 2, 1071\n5: Reverse of cycle 3, 1572\n6: Reverse of cycle 1, 1097\nStep 4:Identify a Hamilton cycle of least weight.\nThe second path,T\u2192B\u2192V\u2192E\u2192T, and its reverse,T\u2192E\u2192V\u2192B\u2192T, have the least weight. The solution is that the\nofficer should travel from Travis Air Force base to Beal Air Force Base, to Vandenberg Air Force base, to Edwards Air Force\nbase, and return to Travis Air Force base, or the same route in reverse.\nYOUR TURN12.44\n1. Suppose that the Air Force officer needed to leave from Travis Air Force base, visit each of Beal, Edwards, and Los\nAngeles Air Force bases exactly once and return to Travis. Use Figure 12.278 to find the shortest route.\nNow suppose that the officer needed a cycle that visited all 5 of the Air Force bases inFigure 12.194. There would be\ndifferent arrangements of vertices and distances to compare\nusing the brute force method. If you consider 10 Air Force bases, there would be\ndifferent arrangements and\ndistances to consider. There must be another way!\nThe Nearest Neighbor Method\nWhen the brute force method is impractical for solving a traveling salesperson problem, an alternative is a greedy\nalgorithm known as thenearest neighbor method, which always visit the closest or least costly place first. This method\nfinds a Hamilton cycle of relatively low weight in a complete graph in which, at each phase, the next vertex is chosen by\ncomparing the edges between the current vertex and the remaining vertices to find the lowest weight. Since the nearest\nneighbor method is a greedy algorithm, it usually doesn\u2019t give the best solution, but it usually gives a solution that is\n\"good enough.\" Most importantly, the number of steps will be the number of vertices. That\u2019s right! A problem with 10\nvertices requires 10 steps, not 362,880. Let\u2019s look at an example to see how it works.\nSuppose that a candidate for governor wants to hold rallies around the state. They plan to leave their home in cityA, visit\ncitiesB, C, D, E, andFeach once, and return home. The airfare between cities is indicated in the graph inFigure 12.196. 1372 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.196Airfares between CitiesA, B, C, D, E, andF\nLet\u2019s help the candidate keep costs of travel down by applying the nearest neighbor method to find a Hamilton cycle that\nhas a reasonably low weight. Begin by marking starting vertex as for \"visited 1st.\" Then to compare the weights of the\nedges betweenAand vertices adjacent toA: $250, $210, $300, $200, and $100 as shown inFigure 12.197. The lowest of\nthese is $100, which is the edge betweenAandF.\nFigure12.197Finding the Second Vertex\nMarkFas for \"visited 2nd\" then compare the weights of the edges betweenFand the remaining vertices adjacent to\nF: $170, $330, $150 and $350 as shown inFigure 12.198. The lowest of these is $150, which is the edge betweenFandD.\nFigure12.198Finding the Third Vertex\nMarkDas for \"visited 3rd.\" Next, compare the weights of the edges betweenDand the remaining vertices adjacent to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1373\nD: $120, $310, and $270 as shown inFigure 12.199. The lowest of these is $120, which is the edge betweenDandB.\nFigure12.199Finding the Fourth Vertex\nSo, markBas for \"visited 4th.\" Finally, compare the weights of the edges betweenBand the remaining vertices\nadjacent toB: $160 and $220 as shown inFigure 12.200. The lower amount is $160, which is the edge betweenBandE.\nFigure12.200Finding the Fifth Vertex\nNow you can markEas and mark the only remaining vertex, which isC, as . This is shown inFigure 12.201. Make a\nnote of the weight of the edge fromEtoC, which is $180, and fromCback toA, which is $210. 1374 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.201Finding the Sixth Vertex\nThe Hamilton cycle we found isA\u2192F\u2192D\u2192B\u2192E\u2192C\u2192A. The weight of the circuit is\n. This may or may not be the route with the lowest cost, but there is a\ngood chance it is very close since the weights are most of the lowest weights on the graph and we found it in six steps\ninstead of finding 120 different Hamilton cycles and calculating 60 weights. Let\u2019s summarize the procedure that we used.\nStep 1:Select the starting vertex and label for \"visited 1st.\" Identify the edge of lowest weight between and the\nremaining vertices.\nStep 2:Label the vertex at the end of the edge of lowest weight that you found in previous step as where the\nsubscript n indicates the order the vertex is visited. Identify the edge of lowest weight between and the vertices that\nremain to be visited.\nStep 3:If vertices remain that have not been visited, repeat Step 2. Otherwise, a Hamilton cycle of low weight is\n.\nEXAMPLE12.45\nUsing the Nearest Neighbor Method\nSuppose that the candidate for governor wants to hold rallies around the state but time before the election is very\nlimited. They would like to leave their home in cityA, visit citiesB,C,D,E, andFeach once, and return home. The airfare\nbetween cities is not as important as the time of travel, which is indicated inFigure 12.202. Use the nearest neighbor\nmethod to find a route with relatively low travel time. What is the total travel time of the route that you found?\nFigure12.202Travel Times between CitiesA, B, C, D, EandF\nSolution\nStep 1:Label vertexAas . The edge of lowest weight betweenAand the remaining vertices is 85 min betweenAand\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.9 \u2022 Traveling Salesperson Problem 1375\nD.\nStep 2:Label vertexDas . The edge of lowest weight betweenDand the vertices that remain to be visited,B, C, E, and\nF, is 70 min betweenDandF.\nRepeat Step 2:Label vertexFas . The edge of lowest weight betweenFand the vertices that remain to be visited,B, C,\nandE, is 75 min betweenFandC.\nRepeat Step 2:Label vertexCas . The edge of lowest weight betweenCand the vertices that remain to be visited,B\nandE, is 100 min betweenCandB.\nRepeat Step 2:Label vertexBas . The only vertex that remains to be visited isE. The weight of the edge betweenB\nandEis 95 min.\nStep 3:A Hamilton cycle of low weight isA\u2192D\u2192F\u2192C\u2192B\u2192E\u2192A. So, a route of relatively low travel time isAtoDtoF\ntoCtoBtoEand back toA. The total travel time of this route is:\nYOUR TURN12.45\n1.

In this last section, we will discuss arguably the most fun kinds of graphs, trees. Have you\nevery researched your family tree? Family trees are a perfect example of the kind of trees we study in graph theory. One\nof the characteristics of a family tree graph is that it never loops back around, because no one is their own grandparent!\nWhat Is A Tree?\nWhether we are talking about a family tree or a tree in a forest, none of the branches ever loops back around and rejoins\nthe trunk. This means that atreehas no cyclic subgraphs, or isacyclic. A tree also has only one component. So, a tree is\na connected acyclic graph. Here are some graphs that have the same characteristic. Each of the graphs inFigure 12.204\nis a tree.\nFigure12.204GraphsT,P, andS\nLet\u2019s practice determining whether a graph is a tree.

Star tree?\n2. Caterpillar tree?\n3. Path graph?\nCharacteristics of Trees\nAs we study trees, it is helpful to be familiar with some of their characteristics. For example, if you add an edge to a tree\ngraph between any two existing vertices, you will create a cycle, and the resulting graph is no longer a tree. Some\nexamples are shown inFigure 12.209. Adding edgebjto GraphTcreates cycle (b,c,i,j). Adding edgertto GraphP\ncreates cycle (r,s,t). Adding edgetvto GraphScreates cycle (t,u,v).\nFigure12.209Adding Edges to Trees\nIt is also true that removing an edge from a tree graph will increase the number of components and the graph will no\nlonger be connected. In fact, you can see inFigure 12.210that removing one or more edges can create a forest.\nRemoving edgeqrfrom GraphPcreates a graph with two components, one with verticeso, pandq, and the other with 1384 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nverticesr, s, andt. Removing edgeuwfrom GraphScreates two components, one with just vertexwand the other with\nthe rest of the vertices. When two edges were removed from GraphT, edgebfand edgecd, creates a graph with three\ncomponents as shown inFigure 12.210.\nFigure12.210Removing Edges from Trees\nA very useful characteristic of tree graphs is that the number of edges is always one less than the number of vertices. In\nfact, any connected graph in which the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices is guaranteed to be a\ntree. Some examples are given inFigure 12.211.\nFigure12.211Number of Vertices and Edges in Trees vs. Other Graphs\nFORMULA\nThe number of edges in a tree graph with vertices is .\nA connected graph with n vertices and edges is a tree graph.\nEXAMPLE12.48\nExploring Characteristics of Trees\nUse GraphsIandJinFigure 12.212to answer each question.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.10 \u2022 Trees 1385\nFigure12.212GraphsIandJ\n1.

Watch this great Numberphile video to see why this is actually a problem you can\ndo at home!\nVIDEO\nThe Problem inGood Will Huntingby Numberphile(https://openstax.org/r/Hunting_Numberphile)\nSpanning Trees\nSuppose that you planned to set up your own computer network with four devices. One option is to use a \u201cmesh\ntopology\u201d like the one inFigure 12.213, in which each device is connected directly to every other device in the network. 1386 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.213Common Network Configurations\nThe mesh topology for four devices could be represented by the complete GraphA1inFigure 12.214where the vertices\nrepresent the devices, and the edges represent network connections. However, the devices could be networked using\nfewer connections. GraphsA2,A3,andA4ofFigure 12.214show configurations in which three of the six edges have been\nremoved. Each of the GraphsA2,A3andA4inFigure 12.214is a tree because it is connected and contains no cycles. Since\nGraphsA2,A3andA4are also subgraphs of GraphA1that include every vertex of the original graph, they are also known\nasspanning trees.\nFigure12.214Network Configurations for Four Devices\nBy definition, spanning trees must span the whole graph by visiting all the vertices. Since spanning trees are subgraphs,\nthey may only have edges between vertices that were adjacent in the original graph. Since spanning trees are trees, they\nare connected and they are acyclic. So, when deciding whether a graph is a spanning tree, check the following\ncharacteristics:\n\u2022 All vertices are included.\n\u2022 No vertices are adjacent that were not adjacent in the original graph.\n\u2022 The graph is connected.\n\u2022 There are no cycles.\nEXAMPLE12.49\nIdentifying Spanning Trees\nUseFigure 12.215to determine which of graphsM1,M2,M3, andM4, are spanning trees ofQ.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.10 \u2022 Trees 1387\nFigure12.215GraphsQ,M1,M2,M3,andM4\nSolution\n1.

You can\nstart at any vertex, go any direction, and create a path through the graph stopping only when you can\u2019t continue without\nbacktracking as shown inFigure 12.216. 1388 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.216First Phase to Construct a Spanning Tree\nOnce you have stopped, pick a vertex along the path you drew as a starting point for another path. Make sure to visit\nonly vertices you have not visited before as shown inFigure 12.217.\nFigure12.217Intermediate Phase to Construct a Spanning Tree\nRepeat this process until all vertices have been visited as shown inFigure 12.218.\nFigure12.218Final Phase to Construct a Spanning Tree\nThe end result is a tree that spans the entire graph as shown inFigure 12.219.\nFigure12.219The Resulting Spanning Tree\nNotice that this subgraph is a tree because it is connected and acyclic. It also visits every vertex of the original graph, so\nit is a spanning tree. However, it is not the only spanning tree for this graph. By making different turns, we could create\nany number of distinct spanning trees.\nEXAMPLE12.50\nConstructing Spanning Trees\nConstruct two distinct spanning trees for the graph inFigure 12.220.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.10 \u2022 Trees 1389\nFigure12.220GraphL\nSolution\nTwo possible solutions are given inFigure 12.221andFigure 12.222.\nFigure12.221First Spanning Tree for GraphL\nFigure12.222Second Spanning Tree for GraphL\nYOUR TURN12.50\n1.

Consider GraphDinFigure 12.223. 1390 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nFigure12.223GraphD\nGraphDhas 10 vertices. A spanning tree of GraphDmust have 9 edges, because the number of edges is one less than\nthe number of vertices in any tree. GraphDhas 13 edges so 4 need to be removed. To determine which 4 edges to\nremove, remember that trees do not have cycles. There are four triangles in GraphDthat we need to break up. We can\naccomplish this by removing 1 edge from each of the triangles. There are many ways this can be done. Two of these\nways are shown inFigure 12.224.\nFigure12.224Removing Four Edges from GraphD\nVIDEO\nSpanning Trees in Graph Theory(https://openstax.org/r/Spanning_Trees_in_Graph_Theory)\nEXAMPLE12.51\nRemoving Edges to Find Spanning Trees\nUse the graph inFigure 12.225to answer each question.\nFigure12.225GraphV\n1.

The actual social networks were more like spanning trees than other\npossible models because there were very few short cycles.

For example, the graph might represent a computer network, and the weights might represent the cost involved\nin connecting two devices. So, finding a spanning tree with the lowest possible total weight, orminimum spanning\ntree, means saving money! The method that we will use to find a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph is called\nKruskal\u2019s algorithm. The steps for Kruskal\u2019s algorithm are: 1392 12 \u2022 Graph Theory\nStep 1:Choose any edge with the minimum weight of all edges.\nStep 2:Choose another edge of minimum weight from the remaining edges. The second edge does not have to be\nconnected to the first edge.\nStep 3:Choose another edge of minimum weight from the remaining edges, but do not select any edge that creates a\ncycle in the subgraph you are creating.\nStep 4:Repeat step 3 until all the vertices of the original graph are included and you have a spanning tree.\nVIDEO\nUse Kruskal's Algorithm to Find Minimum Spanning Trees in Graph Theory(https://openstax.org/r/\nTrees_in_Graph_Theory)\nEXAMPLE12.52\nUsing Kruskal\u2019s Algorithm\nA computer network will be set up with six devices.

What is the total\ncost?\nFigure12.229Graph of Network Connection Costs\nSolution\nA minimum spanning tree will correspond to the network configuration of least cost. We will use Kruskal\u2019s algorithm to\nfind one. Since the graph has six vertices, the spanning tree will have six vertices and five edges.\nStep 1:Choose an edge of least weight. We have sorted the weights into numerical order. The least is $100.

Notice that the two selected\nedges do not need to be adjacent to each other as shown inFigure 12.231.\nFigure12.231Step 2 Select EdgeBD\nStep 3:Select the lowest weight edge of the remaining edges, as long as it does not result in a cycle.

BothBFandCEhave a weight of $170, butBFwould\ncreate cycle (b,d,f) and there cannot be a cycle in a spanning tree as shown inFigure 12.234.\nFigure12.234Repeat Step 3 Do Not Select EdgeBF\nSo, we will selectCE, which will complete the spanning tree as shown inFigure 12.235.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.10 \u2022 Trees 1395\nFigure12.235Repeat Step 3 Select EdgeCE\nThe minimum spanning tree is shown inFigure 12.236.

Graphs and multigraphs represent objects as vertices and the relationships between the objects as edges.\n\u2022 The degree of a vertex is the number of edges that meet it and the degree can be zero.\n\u2022 An edge must have a vertex at each end.\n\u2022 Multigraphs may contain loops and double edges, but simple graphs may not.\n12.2Graph Structures\n\u2022 The sum of the degrees of the vertices in a graph is twice the number of edges.\n\u2022 In a complete graph every pair of vertices is adjacent.\n\u2022 A subgraph is part of a larger graph.\n\u2022 Cycles are a sequence of connected vertices that begin and end at the same vertex but never visit any vertex twice.\n12.3Comparing Graphs\n\u2022 Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure.\n\u2022 When graphs are relatively small, we can use visual inspection to identify an isomorphism by transforming one\ngraph into another without breaking connections or adding new ones.\n\u2022 An isomorphism between two graphs preserves adjacency.\n\u2022 If two graphs differ in number of vertices, number of edges, degrees of vertices, or types of subgraphs, they cannot\nbe isomorphic.\n\u2022 When the complements of two graphs are isomorphic, so are the graphs themselves.\n12.4Navigating Graphs\n\u2022 Walks, trails, and paths are ways to navigate through a graph using a sequence of connected vertices and edges.\n\u2022 Closed walks, circuits, and directed cycles are ways to navigate from a vertex on a graph and return to the same\nvertex.\n\u2022 Colorings are a way to organize the vertices of a graph into groups so that no two members of a group are adjacent.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12 \u2022 Chapter Summary 1403\n\u2022 Maps can be represented with planar graphs, which can always be colored using four colors or fewer.\n12.5Euler Circuits\n\u2022 A connected graph has only one component.\n\u2022 The Euler circuit theorem states that an Euler circuit exists in every connected graph in which all vertices have even\ndegree, but not in disconnected graphs or any graph with one or more vertices of odd degree.\n\u2022 The Chinese postman problem asks how to find the shortest closed trail that visits all edges at least once.\n\u2022 If an Euler circuit exists, it is always the best solution to the Chinese postman problem.\n\u2022 Eulerization is the process of adding duplicate edges to a graph so that the new multigraph has an Euler circuit.\n\u2022 The minimum number of duplicated edges needed to eulerize a graph is half the number of odd vertices or

Math can be found in areas that are expected and sometimes in areas that are\nsurprising. There are many ways that mathematical concepts, such as those in this text, are infused in the world around\nus. In this chapter, we will explore a sampling of five distinct areas from everyday life where math\u2019s impact plays a\nmeaningful role.\nMath's impact on art can be found in numerical relationships that are known to create or enhance beauty. The Fibonacci\nnumbers are one mathematical example that can be found in nature such as in petal count of a rose. On a different note,\na mathematical exploration can aid in making a convincing argument on how we can positively impact our environment.\nWhether looking at the choices of a single individual or the larger impact offered from a collaborative effort, there are\nmeasurable responses to positively address climate change. Turning to medicine, which has been a topic of global\nimportance in recent years, we will explore how math is used to determine drug dosage rates and test the validity of a\nvaccine. Switching back to items of aesthetic nature, we will examine some foundational components of music which,\nlike art, brings beauty and joy to our lives. Finally, we will explore some ways that math is used in sports to predict future\nperformance and analyze tournaments styles. 1418 13 \u2022 Math and...\n13.1 Math and Art\nFigure13.2Sunflower seeds appear in a pattern that involves the Fibonacci sequence.

Identify and describe the Fibonacci sequence and its application to nature.\n3. Apply the golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence relationship.\n4. Identify and compute golden rectangles.\nArt is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or\nsculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.\nOxford Dictionary\nArt, like other disciplines, is an area that combines talent and experience with education. While not everyone considers\nthemself skilled at creating art, there are mathematical relationships commonly found in artistic masterpieces that drive\nwhat is considered attractive to the eye. Nature is full of examples of these mathematical relationships.\nEnroll in a cake decorating class and, when you learn how to create flowers out of icing, you will likely be directed as to\nthe number of petals to use. Depending on the desired size of a rose flower, the recommendation for the number of\npetals to use is commonly 5, 8, or 13 petals. If learning to draw portraits, you may be surprised to learn that eyes are\napproximately halfway between the top of a person\u2019s head and their chin. Studying architecture, we find examples of\nbuildings that contain golden rectangles and ratios that add to the beautifying of the design. The Parthenon (Figure\n13.3), which was built around 400 BC, as well as modern-day structures such the Washington Monument are two\nexamples containing these relationships. These seemingly unrelated examples and many more highlight mathematical\nrelationships that we associate with beauty in artistic form.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Math and Art 1419\nFigure13.3The Parthenon in Greece demonstrates the golden ratio.

The golden ratio is\nexpressed in nature from plants to creatures such as the starfish, honeybees, seashells, and more. It is commonly noted\nby the Greek letter\u03d5(pronounced \u201cfee\u201d). , which has a decimal value approximately equal to 1.618.\nConsiderFigure 13.3: Note how the building is balanced in dimension and has a natural shape.

Leonardo da\nVinci is considered one of the artists who mastered the mathematics of the golden ratio, which is prevalent in his artwork\nsuch asVirtuvian Man(Figure 13.4). This famous masterpiece highlights the golden ratio in the proportions of an ideal\nbody shape.\nThe golden ratio is approximated in several physical measurements of the human body and parts exhibiting the golden\nratio are simply called golden. The ratio of a person\u2019s height to the length from their belly button to the floor is\u03d5or\napproximately 1.618. The bones in our fingers (excluding the thumb), are golden as they form a ratio that approximates\n\u03d5.

(credit: \u201crilke4\u201d by monchoohcnom/Flickr, Public Domain Mark 1.0)\nTheFibonacci sequencecan be found occurring naturally in a wide array of elements in our environment from the\nnumber of petals on a rose flower to the spirals on a pine cone to the spines on a head of lettuce and more. The\nFibonacci sequence can be found in artistic renderings of nature to develop aesthetically pleasing and realistic artistic\ncreations such as in sculptures, paintings, landscape, building design, and more. It is the sequence of numbers\nbeginning with 1, 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms in the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,\n\u2026).\nThe petal counts on some flowers are represented in the Fibonacci sequence. A daisy is sometimes associated with\nplucking petals to answer the question \u201cThey love me, they love me not.\u201d Interestingly, a daisy found growing wild\ntypically contains 13, 21, or 34 petals and it is noted that these numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence.

If a circular row on a pinecone contains 21 scales and models the Fibonacci sequence, approximately how many\nscales would be found on the next circular row?\nGolden Ratio and the Fibonacci Sequence Relationship\nMathematicians for years have explored patterns and applications to the world around us and continue to do so today.\nOne such pattern can be found in ratios of two adjacent terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\nRecall that the Fibonacci sequence = 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13,\u2026 with 5 and 8 being one example of adjacent terms. When\ncomputing the ratio of the larger number to the preceding number such as 8/5 or 13/8, it is fascinating to find the\ngolden ratio emerge. As larger numbers from the Fibonacci sequence are utilized in the ratio, the value more closely\napproaches\u03d5, the golden ratio.\nEXAMPLE13.3\nFinding Golden Ratio in Adjacent Fibonacci Terms\nThe 24th Fibonacci number is 46,368 and the 25th is 75,025.

Having access to clean, potable water is critical for not\nonly our health but also for the health of our ecosystem. About 1 out of 10 people on our planet do not have easy access\nto clean water to drink.

Shortly thereafter, William\nGrylls Adams and Richard Evans Day discovery that selenium can produce electricity if exposed to the sun was a major\nbreakthrough. Less than 10 years later, Charles Fritts invented the first solar cells using selenium. Jumping a mere 100\nyears later, Bell Labs in the United States produced the first practical photovoltaic cells in the mid-1950s and developed\nversions used to power satellites in the same decade.\nSolar panel use has exploded in recent decades and is now used by residences, organizations, businesses, and\ngovernment buildings such as the White House, space to power satellites, and various methods of transportation. One\nreason for the expansion is a continuing drop in cost combined with an increase in performance and durability. In the\nmid-1950s, the cost of a solar panel was around $300 per watt capability. Twenty years later, the cost was a third of the\n1950s\u2019 cost. Currently, solar panel cost has dropped to less than $1 per watt while decreasing in size as well as increasing\nin longevity. The dropping price and improved performance has moved solar to a modest investment that can pay for\nitself in less than half the time of systems from 15 years ago.\nWHO KNEW?\nSolar Power\u2019s Age\nThe sun has been harnessed by humans for centuries. The earliest recorded use of tapping the sun\u2019s energy for\npower dates back to the seventh century BC when man focused the sun\u2019s rays through a magnifying glass to create\nfire. Four thousand years later, we find historical record of using mirrors to focus the sun and light torches, often for\nceremonial proceedings. Use of the sun to light torches continued through the centuries and has been recorded by\nvarious cultures including the Chinese civilization in 20 AD and beyond.\nIn more recent years, the sun was harnessed to power ovens on ships traversing to oceans in the 1700s. At the same\ntime, the power of the sun was utilized to power steamboats through the 1800s. M\u00e1ria Telkes, a Hungarian-born\nAmerican scientist, invented a widely deployed solar seawater distiller used on World War II life rafts. Soon after, she\npartnered with architect Eleanor Raymond to design the first modern home to be completely heated by solar power.\nAir warmed on rooftop collectors transferred heat to salts, which stored the heat for later use.\nAlthough solar panels as we know them today are relatively new in history, use of the sun to harness power is much\nolder.\nCompute Power Needs for Common Home Devices\nAkilowatt(kW) is 1,000 watts (W). Akilowatt-hour(kWh) is a measurement of energy use, which is the amount of\nenergy used by a 1,000-watt device to run for an hour. Using the definition of a kilowatt-hour, to calculate how long it\nwould take to consume 1 kWh of power, we divide 1,000 by the watts use of a device.\nFORMULA\nFor example, a 75 W bulb would take to use 1 kW of power. 1428 13 \u2022 Math and...\nFORMULA\nEXAMPLE13.8\nCalculating the Kilowatt-Hours Needed to Run a Television\nA 48 in plasma television uses about 200 W.

We will look further at reducing greenhouse gas and CO2emissions.\nAny gas that prevents infrared radiation from escaping Earth's atmosphere is a greenhouse gas. There are 24 currently\nidentified greenhouse gases of which carbon dioxide is one. When measuring the impact of any of the greenhouse\ngases, the measurements are given in units of carbon dioxide emissions. For this reason, greenhouse gas and carbon\ndioxide have become interchangeable in discussions.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nCharles Fritts and Mohammad M. Atalla\nCharles Fritts, a New York inventor, is credited with creating the first solar cell, which he installed on a rooftop in New\nYork City in 1884. While the solar cell was not very efficient, having a rate of conversion between 1 to 2%, this was a\nmajor step early in solar power energy. Today\u2019s solar cells have an efficiency on average of 15 to 20%, which yields a\nnotably higher impact. Nonetheless, the work that Fritts successfully completed marked the start of solar energy\nthrough the use of photovoltaic solar panels in the United States.\nMohamed M. Atalla was an Egyptian-born scientist who moved to the United States to complete his studies, and\nundertook research and development at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. Many of the early efficiency gains in solar\ncells were due to his development of processes for using silicon within electronic devices. Atalla's work led to the\ninvention of silicon transistors and microchips (including his own invention of the MOSFET, the most widely used\ntransistor in the world), and quickly increased the efficiency of solar cells. 1430 13 \u2022 Math and...\nEXAMPLE13.11\nCalculating the Solar Power for Average Home Use in Kilowatts\nIf a home uses approximately 30 kW of electricity per day, what size solar system would be needed to fuel 80% of a\nhome\u2019s needs for a month (30 days)?\nSolution\nA solar system capable of producing 720 kW a month would be needed.\nYOUR TURN13.11\n1.

Compute the mathematical factors utilized in concentrations/dosages of drugs.\n2. Describe the history of validating effectiveness of a new drug.\n3. Describe how mathematical modeling is used to track the spread of a virus.\nThe pandemic that rocked the world starting in 2020 turned attention to finding a cure for the Covid-19 strain into a\nworld race and dominated conversations from major news channels to households around the globe. News reports\ndecreeing the number of new cases and deaths locally as well as around the world were part of the daily news for over a\nyear and progress on vaccines soon followed. How was a vaccine able to be found so quickly? Is the vaccine safe? Is the\nvaccine effective? These and other questions have been raised through communities near and far and some remain\ndebatable. However, we can educate ourselves on the foundations of these discussions and be more equipped to analyze\nnew information related to these questions as it becomes available.\nConcentrations and Dosages of Drugs\nConsider any drug and the recommended dosage varies based on several factors such as age, weight, and degree of\nillness of a person. Hospitals and medical dispensaries do not stock every possible needed concentration of medicines.\nDrugs that are delivered in liquid form for intravenous (IV) methods in particular can be easily adjusted to meet the\nneeds of a patient. Whether administering anesthesia prior to an operation or administering a vaccine, calculation of the\nconcentration of a drug is needed to ensure the desired amount of medicine is delivered.\nThe formula to determine the volume needed of a drug in liquid form is a relatively simple formula. The volume needed\nis calculated based on the required dosage of the drug with respect to the concentration of the drug. For drugs in liquid\nform, the concentration is noted as the amount of the drug per the volume of the solution that the drug is suspended in\nwhich is commonly measured in g/mL or mg/mL.\nSuppose a doctor writes a prescription for 6 mg of a drug, which a nurse calculates when retrieving the needed\nprescription from their secure pharmaceutical storage space. On the shelves, the drug is available in liquid form as 2 mg\nper mL. This means that 1 mg of the drug is found in 0.5 mL of the solution. Multiplying 6 mg by 0.5 mL yields 3 mL,\nwhich is the volume of the prescription per single dose.\nFORMULA\n.\nA common calculation for the weight of a liquid drug is measured in grams of a drug per 100 mL of solution and is also\ncalled the percentage weight by volume measurement and labeled as % w/v or simply w/v.\nNote that the units for a desired dose of a drug and the units for a solution containing the drug or pill form of the\ndrug must be the same. If they are not the same, the units must first be converted to be measured in the same 1432 13 \u2022 Math and...\nunits.\nSuppose you visit your doctor with symptoms of an upset stomach and unrelenting heartburn. One possible recourse is\nsodium bicarbonate, which aids in reducing stomach acid.\nEXAMPLE13.12\nCalculating the Quantity in a Mixture\nHow much sodium bicarbonate is there in a 250 mL solution of 1.58% w/v sodium bicarbonate?\nSolution\nsodium bicarbonate in 100 mL. If there is 250 mL of the solution, we have 2.5 times as much sodium\nbicarbonate as in 100 mL. Thus, we multiply 1.58 by 2.5 to yield 3.95 g sodium bicarbonate in 250 mL solution.\nYOUR TURN13.12\n1. How many milligrams of sodium chloride are there in 200 mL of a 0.9% w/v normal saline solution?\nEXAMPLE13.13\nCalculating the Quantity of Pills Needed\nA doctor prescribes 25.5 mg of a drug to take orally per day and pills are available in 8.5 mg. How many pills will be\nneeded each day?\nSolution\nThe prescription and the pills are in the same units which means no conversions are needed. We can divide the units of\nthe drug prescribed by the units in each pill: . So, 3 pills will be needed each day.\nYOUR TURN13.13\n1. How many pills would be needed for a patient who has been prescribed 25.5 mg of a drug if each pill contains\n4.25 mg.\nEXAMPLE13.14\nCalculating the Drug Dose in Milligrams, Based on Patient Weight\nA patient is prescribed 2 mg/kg of a drug to be delivered intramuscularly, divided into 3 doses per day. If the patient\nweighs 45 kg, how many milligrams of the drug should be given per dose?\nSolution\nStep 1:Calculate the total daily dose of the drug based on the patient\u2019s weight (measured in kilograms):\nStep 2:Divide the total daily dose by the number of doses per day:\nThe patient should receive 30 mg of the drug in each dose.\nYOUR TURN13.14\n1. A patient is prescribed 1.4 mg/kg of a drug to be delivered intramuscularly, divided into 2 doses per day. If the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 Math and Medicine 1433\npatient weighs 60 kg, how many milliliters of the drug should be given per dose?\nNote that the units for a patient\u2019s weight must be compatible with the units used in the medicine measurement. If\nthey are not the same, the units must first be converted to be measured in the same units.\nEXAMPLE13.15\nCalculating the Drug Dose in Milliliters, Based on Patient Weight\nA patient is prescribed 2 mg/kg of a drug to be delivered intramuscularly, divided into 3 doses per day. If the drug is\navailable in 20 mg/mL and the patient weighs 60 kg, how many milliliters of the drug should be given per dose?\nSolution\nStep 1:Calculate the total daily dose of the drug (measured in milligrams) based on the patient\u2019s weight (measured in\nkilograms):\nStep 2:Calculate the volume in each dose:\nStep 3:Calculate the volume based on the strength of the stock:\nThe patient should receive 2 mL of the stock drug in each dose.\nYOUR TURN13.15\n1. A patient is prescribed 2.5 mg/kg of a drug to be delivered intramuscularly, divided into 2 doses per day. If the\ndrug is available in 5 mg/mL and the patient weighs 52 kg, how many milligrams of the drug should be given per\ndose?\nWHO KNEW?\nMath Statistics from the CDC\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that about half the U.S. population in 2019 used at least\none prescription drug each month, and about 25% of people used three or more prescription drugs in a month. The\nresulting overall collective impact of the pharmaceutical industry in the United States exceeded $1.3 trillion a year\nprior to the 2020 pandemic.\nValidating Effectiveness of a New Vaccine\nThe process to develop a new vaccine and be able to offer it to the public typically takes 10 to 15 years. In the United\nStates, the system typically involves both public and private participation in a process. During the 1900s, several vaccines\nwere successfully developed, including the following: polio vaccine in the 1950s and chickenpox vaccine in the 1990s.\nBoth of these vaccines took years to be developed, tested, and available to the public. Knowing the typical timeline for a\nvaccine to move from development to administration, it is not surprising that some people wondered how a vaccine for\nCovid-19 was released in less than a year\u2019s time.\nLesser known is that research on coronavirus vaccines has been in process for approximately 10 years. Back in 2012,\nconcern over the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) broke out and scientists from all over the world began\nworking on researching coronaviruses and how to combat them. It was discovered that the foundation for the virus is a\nspike protein, which, when delivered as part of a vaccine, causes the human body to generate antibodies and is the 1434 13 \u2022 Math and...\nplatform for coronavirus vaccines.\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, Operation Warp Speed, fueled by the U.S. federal government and private\nsector, poured unprecedented human resources into applying the previous 10 years of research and development into\ntargeting a specific vaccine for the Covid-19 strain.\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nShibo Jiang\nDr. Shibo Jiang, MD, PhD, is co-director the Center for Vaccine Development at the Texas Children\u2019s Hospital and head\nof a virology group at the New York Blood Center. Together with his colleagues, Jiang has been working on vaccines\nand treatments for a range of viruses and infections including influenzas, HIV, Sars, HPV and more recently Covid-19.\nHis work has been recognized around the world and is marked with receiving grants amounting to over $20 million\nfrom U.S. sources as well as the same from foundations in China, producing patents in the United States and China\nfor his antiviral products to combat world concerns.\nJiang has been a voice for caution in the search for a vaccine for Covid-19, emphasizing the need for caution to ensure\nsafety in the development and deployment of a vaccine. His work and that of his colleagues for over 10 years on other\ncoronaviruses paved the way for the vaccines that have been shared to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMathematical Modeling to Track the Spread of a Vaccine\nWith a large number of people receiving a Covid-19 vaccine, the concern at this time is how to create an affordable\nvaccine to reach people all over the world. If a world solution is not found, those without access to a vaccine will serve as\nincubators to variants that might be resistant to the existing vaccines.\nAs we work to vaccinate the world, attention continues with tracking the spread of the Covid-19 and its multiple variants.\nMathematical modelingis the process of creating a representation of the behavior of a system using mathematical\nlanguage. Digital mathematical modeling plays a key role in analyzing the vast amounts of data reported from a variety\nof sources such as hospitals and apps on cell phones.\nWhen attempting to represent an observed quantitative data set, mathematical models can aid in finding patterns and\nconcentrations as well as aid in predicting growth or decline of the system. Mathematical models can also be useful to\ndetermine strengths and vulnerabilities of a system, which can be helpful in arresting the spread of a virus.\nThe chapter onGraph Theoryexplores one such method of mathematical modeling using paths and circuits. Cell phones\nhave been helpful in tracking the spread of the Covid-19 virus using apps regulated by regional government public\nhealth authorities to collect data on the network of people exposed to an individual who tests positive for the Covid-19\nvirus.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 Math and Medicine 1435\nPEOPLE IN MATHEMATICS\nGladys West\nFigure13.10Gladys West (credit: \"Dr. Gladys West Hall\" by The US Air Force/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nDr. Gladys West is a mathematician and hidden figure with a rich r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of accomplishments spanning Air Force\napplications and work at NASA. Born in 1930, West rose and excelled both academically and in her professional life at\na time when Black women were not embraced in STEM positions. One of her many accomplishments is the Global\nPositioning System (GPS) used on cell phones for driving directions.\nWest began work as a human computer, someone who computes mathematical computations by hand. Considering\nthe time and complexity of some calculations, she became involved in programming computers to crunch\ncomputations. Eventually, West created a mathematical model of Earth with detail and precision that made GPS\npossible, which is utilized in an array of devices from satellites to cell phones. The next time you tag a photo or obtain\ndriving directions, you are tapping into the mathematical modeling of Earth that West developed.\nConsider the following graph (Figure 13.11):\nFigure13.11Contact Tracing for Math 111 Section 1\nAt the center of the graph, we find Alyssa, whom we will consider positive for a virus. Utilizing the technology of phone\napps voluntarily installed on each phone of the individuals in the graph, tracking of the spread of the virus among the 6\nindividuals that Alyssa had direct contact with can be implemented, namely Suad, Rocio, Braeden, Soren, and Sandra.\nLet\u2019s look at Jos\u00e9\u2019s exposure risk as it relates to Alyssa. There are multiple paths connecting Jos\u00e9 with Alyssa. One path\nincludes the following individuals: Jos\u00e9 to Mikaela to Nate to Sandra to Alyssa. This path contains a length of 4 units, or\npeople, in the contact tracing line. There are 2 more paths connecting Jos\u00e9 to Alyssa. A second path of the same length\nconsists of Jos\u00e9 to Lucia to Rocio to Braeden to Alyssa. Path 3 is the shortest and consists of Jos\u00e9 to Lucia to Rocio to 1436 13 \u2022 Math and...\nAlyssa. Tracking the spread of positive cases in the line between Alyssa and Jos\u00e9 aids in monitoring the spread of the\ninfection.\nNow consider the complexity of tracking a pandemic across the nation. Graphs such as the one above are not practical to\nbe drawn on paper but can be managed by computer programs capable of computing large volumes of data. In fact, a\ncomputer-generated mathematical model of contact tracing would look more like a sphere with paths on the exterior as\nwell as on the interior. Mathematical modeling of contact tracing is complex and feasible through the use of technology.\nEXAMPLE13.16\nUsing Mathematical Modeling\nFor the following exercises, use the sample contact tracing graph to identify paths (Figure 13.12).\nFigure13.12Contact Tracing for ECON 250 Section 1\n1.

Describe the basics of frequency related to sound.\n2. Describe the basics of pitch as it relates to music.\n3. Describe and evaluate musical notes, half-steps, whole steps, and octaves.\n4. Describe and find frequencies of octaves.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s most famous and popular language is music.\u201d\nPsy, South Korean singer, rapper, songwriter, and record producer\nImagine a world without music and many of us would struggle to fill the void. Music uplifts, inspires, heals, and generally\nadds dimension to virtually every aspect of our lives. But what is music? For some it is a song; for others it may be the\nsounds of birds or the rhythmic sound of drumming or a myriad of other sounds. Whatever you consider music, it is all\naround us and is an integral part of our lives. \u201cMusic can raise someone\u2019s mood, get them excited, or make them calm\nand relaxed. Music also\u2014and this is important\u2014allows us to feel nearly or possibly all emotions that we experience in\nour lives. The possibilities are endless\u201d (Galindo, 2009).\nWhat music you listen to can impact your mood and emotions. In similar fashion, the music we choose can often tell\nthose around us something about our current moods and emotions. Consider the music you may have been listening to\nas you today or even as you are reading this text. What cues to your mood do your music selections share? Albert\nEinstein is quoted as saying, \u201cIf I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my\ndaydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.\u201d What clues do your recent music choices say about your mood or\nhow your day is going?\nBasics of Frequency as It Relates to Sound\nEvery sound is created by an object vibrating and these vibrations travel in waves that are captured by our ears. Some\nvibrations we may be able to see, such as a plucked guitar string moving, whereas other vibrations we may not be able\nto see, such as the sound created when we hold our breath when accidentally dropping our cell phone on a hard floor.\nWe don\u2019t see the vibrations of our cell phone hitting the floor; however, any audible sound created in the fall is the result\nof vibrations in the form of sound waves, which can be pictured similarly to waves moving through the ocean.\nThe waves of sounds each have afrequency, or rate of vibration of sound waves, that measures the number of waves\ncompleted in a single second and are measured inhertz(Hz; one Hz is one cycle per second). Louder sounds have\nstronger vibrations or are created closer to our ear. The further an ear is from the source of the sound, the quieter the\nsound will appear.\nSounds range in frequency from 16 Hz to ultrasonic values, with humans able to hear sounds in a frequency range of\nabout 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Adults lose the ability to hear the upper end of the range and typically top out in the ability to\nhear in a frequency of 15,000\u201317,000 Hz. Sounds with a frequency above 17,000 Hz are less likely to be heard by adults\nwhile still being audible to children.\nWhile frequency plays a key role in audible sounds, so too does the sound level, which can be measured indecibels(dB),\nwhich are the units of measure for the intensity of a sound or the degree of loudness. As a sound level increases, the\ndecibel level increases.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.4 \u2022 Math and Music 1439\nA person with average hearing can hear sounds down to 0 dB. Those with exceptionally good hearing can hear even\nquieter sounds, down to approximately \u20135 dB. The following table includes sample sounds with their related decibel\nvalues.\nSound Decibels (dB)\nFirecrackers 140\nTake-off of military jet from aircraft carrier 130\nClap of thunder 120\nAuto horn standing next to the vehicle 110\nOutboard motor 100\nMotorcycle 90\nNoise inside a car in city traffic 80\nTypical washing machine 70\nPublic conversation, such as at a restaurant 60\nPrivate conversation 50\nHum of a computer with fan blowing 40\nQuiet whisper 30\nSwishing leaves 20\nRegular breathing 10\nLowest typical sound audible by teenagers 0\nEXAMPLE13.17\nSelecting Decibel Value of Sounds\nSelect the most representative decibel value for each of the following sounds:\n1. car wash: 25 dB, 55 dB, 85 dB\n2. vacuum cleaner: 15 dB, 70 dB, 90 dB\n3. ship\u2019s engine room: 30 dB, 65 dB, 95 dB\n4. approaching subway car: 70 dB, 100 dB, 120 dB\nSolution\n1. 85 dB\n2. 70 dB\n3. 95 dB\n4. 100 dB 1440 13 \u2022 Math and...\nYOUR TURN13.17\nMatch each of the following sounds with a corresponding decibel level: live outdoor concert, birds chirping, window\nair conditioner, garbage disposal.\n1. 40 dB\n2. 60 dB\n3. 80 dB\n4. 100 dB\nBasics of Pitch\nWhen considering the various sound levels the human ear can hear, the ear perceives sound both from the frequency\nlevel and the pitch of a sound. The quality of the sound is referred to aspitch, the tonal quality of a sound and how high\nor low the tone. Sounds with a high frequency have a high pitch, such as 900 Hz, and sounds with a low pitch have a low\nfrequency, such as 50 Hz.\nLet\u2019s take a look at frequency and pitch using a string instrument such as a guitar or piano. When a string is plucked on a\nguitar or a key is played on a piano, the related string vibrates at a frequency that is related to the length and thickness\nof the string. The frequency is measurable and has a singular value. The pitch of the note played is open for\ninterpretation, as the pitch is a function of personal opinion.\nWHO KNEW?\nGraphing Calculators and Music\nIt may be interesting to note that a TI-84 and TI-Nspire graphing calculators can be utilized to tune a musical\ninstrument by measuring the frequency of a note using a small plug-in accessory that captures the sound waves from\na note and displays the corresponding frequency. Using the displayed frequency, an instrumentalist can then make\nthe needed adjustment to perfectly tune an instrument. This method of tuning an instrument can be helpful whether\na novice player or a seasoned instrumentalist because the instrument can be tuned precisely to the correct frequency.\nNote Values, Half-Steps, Whole Steps, and Octaves\n\u201cThere are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever\nbe heard.\u201d\nSun Tzu, Chinese strategist\nFigure13.14Piano Keys and Notes (credit: modification of work \"Contemplate\" by Walt Stoneburner/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nMoving our exploration to note values, the frequency of all notes is well defined by a specific and unique frequency for\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.4 \u2022 Math and Music 1441\neach note that is measurable. We will explore keys on a keyboard to discuss notes that have the same relationships with\nany instrument or musical piece.\nLet\u2019s look atFigure 13.14. The white keys are labeled with the letters A\u2013G and the photo begins with middle C, which can\nbe found in the middle of a keyboard. This labeling of the keys repeats across an entire keyboard and keys to the right\nhave a higher pitch and frequency than keys to the left. Each of the keys correlates to a musical note.\nMovement up or down between any two consecutive keys (black and white) or notes constitutes ahalf-step. Movement\nof one half-step sometimes involves asharp(#) or aflat(\u266d) symbol. For example, D#is one half-step above D and D\u266dis\none half-step below D. Note that this is not always true as one half-step above B is C, and one half-step below F is E. In\nsimilar fashion, awhole stepis movement up or down between any two half-steps on a keyboard.\nEXAMPLE13.18\nIdentifying Half-Steps\nName which keys are one half-step up and one half-step down from the following:\n1.

E\nYou may have noticed that there are eight letters of the alphabet used to label notes. Selecting any one note and\ncounting up 12 half-steps you will find that the numbering for notes begins at the same value as you started from. This 1442 13 \u2022 Math and...\ncollection of 12 consecutive half-notes is called anoctaveand is a basic foundational component in music theory.\nEXAMPLE13.20\nListing All Notes in an Octave\nList the 12 notes forming an octave, beginning with the note C.\nSolution\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B\nYOUR TURN13.20\n1. List the 12 notes forming an octave, beginning with the note G.\nFrequencies of Octaves\nNotes that are one octave apart have the same name and are related in frequency values. Given the frequency of any\nnote, the frequency of same note one octave higher is doubled and this pattern continues as you move up and down the\nnotes on a keyboard or any other musical instrument. Song writers and singers use this knowledge to change the pitch\nof a note up or down to align with a person\u2019s vocal range. Regardless of which C is played or sung, the pitch is the same\nand the frequency is related by a power or two.\nLabeled keys on a keyboard are numbered for ease in identification. For example, middle C is labeled as C4on a full\nkeyboard as it is the fourth C from the left in a set of eight notes. The frequency of C4is 262 Hz, rounded to the nearest\nwhole number.\nEXAMPLE13.21\nCalculating the Frequency Values of Octaves\nGiven that the frequency of C4is 262 Hz, find the approximate frequency of C6.\nSolution\nThe frequency of each consecutive higher octave doubles. Given that the frequency of C4is 262 Hz, the frequency of C5is\nfound by doubling the frequency of C4, which is 524 Hz. In similar fashion, the frequency of C6is found by doubling the\nfrequency of C5, which yields 1,048 Hz.\nYOUR TURN13.21\n1.

Cope combined his interests when he developed software that can analyze a piece of music\nand create a new and unique musical piece in the same style as the original. Some of his well-known products have\nbeen based off of the classical music of Mozart, creating what has been called Mozart\u2019s \u201c42nd Symphony,\u201d as well as\nother genres including opera and a range of current music styles.

Spotify, which was launched in 2008, typically plays artists $0.06 per time a song\nis streamed, with some artists receiving up to $0.84 per play amounting to over $9 billion in revenue for Spotify in\n2020. Since 2014, Spotify\u2019s revenue has grown over a billion dollars a year, with roughly half of their revenue being\npaid out in royalties, which was good news for artists during the Covid-19 pandemic when in-person concerts and\nshopping were hindered.\nCheck Your Understanding\n11.

(credit: \u201cCheering Touchdowns\u201d by\nSteven Miller/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nLearning Objectives\nAfter completing this section, you should be able to:\n1. Describe why data analytics (statistics) is crucial to advance a team\u2019s success.\n2. Describe single round-robin method of tournaments.\n3. Describe single-elimination method of tournaments.\n4. Explore math in baseball, fantasy football, hockey, and soccer (projects at the end of the section).\nSports are big business and entertainment around the world. In the United States alone, the revenue from professional\nsports is projected to bring in over $77 billion, which includes admission ticket costs, merchandise, media coverage\naccess rights, and advertising. So, whether or not you enjoy watching professional sports, you probably know someone\nwho does. Some celebrities compete to be part of half-time shows and large companies vie for commercial spots that are\ncostly but reach a staggering number of viewers, some who only watch the half-time shows and advertisements.\nData Analytics (Statistics) Is Crucial to Advance a Team\u2019s Success\nAnalyzing the vast data that today\u2019s world has amassed to find patterns and to make predictions for future results has\ncreated a degree field fordata analyticsat many colleges, which is in high demand in places that might surprise you.\nOne such place is in sports, where being able to analyze the available data on your team\u2019s players, potential recruits,\nopposing team strategies, and opposing players can be paramount to your team\u2019s success.\nHollywood turned the notion of using data analytics into a major motion picture back in 2011 with the release of\nMoneyball,starring Brad Pitt, which grossed over $110 million. The critically acclaimed movie, based on a true story as\nshared in a book by Michael Lewis, follows the story of a general manager for the Oakland Athletics who used data\nanalytics to take a team comprised of relatively unheard of players to ultimately win the American League West title in a\nyear\u2019s time. The win caught the eye of other team managers and owners, which started an avalanche of other teams\ndigging into the data of players and teams.\nIn today\u2019s world of sports, a team has multiple positions utilizing data analytics from road scouts who evaluate a\npotential recruit\u2019s skills and potential to the ultimate position of general manager who is typically the highest-paid (non-\nplayer) employee with the exception of the coaches. Being able to understand and evaluate the available data is big\nbusiness and is a highly sought after skill set. In college and professional sports, it is no longer sufficient to have a strong\nplaybook and great players. The science to winning is in understanding the math of the data and using it to propel your\nteam to excelling.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.5 \u2022 Math and Sports 1445\nSingle Round-Robin Tournaments\nFigure13.16Single-Round Robin Tournament\nA common tournament style is single round-robin tournaments (Figure 13.16), where each team or opponent plays every\nother team or opponent, and the champion is determined by the team that wins the most games. Ties are possible and\nare resolved based on league rules.\nAn advantage of the round-robin tournament style is that no one team has the advantage ofseeding, which eliminates\nsome teams from playing against each other based on rank of their prior performance. Rather, each team plays every\nother team, providing equal opportunity to triumph over each team. In this sense, round-robin tournaments are deemed\nthe fairest tournament style.\nOne hindrance to employing a round-robin-style tournament is the potential for the number of games involved in\ntournament play to determine a winner. Determining the number of games can be found easily using a formula which,\nas we will see, can quickly grow in the number of games required for a single round-robin tournament.\nFORMULA\nThe number of games in a single round-robin tournament with teams is .\nEXAMPLE13.22\nCalculating the Number of Games in Single Round-Robin Tournaments\nFind the number of games in a single round-robin tournament for each of the following numbers of teams:\n1. 4 teams\n2. 8 teams\n3. 20 teams\nSolution\n1.

As such, some tournaments elect to employ variations of single round-robin tournament play as\nwell as other tournament styles such as elimination tournaments.\nFigure13.17Single-Elimination Tournament (credit: final TK)\nSingle-Elimination Tournaments\nWhen desiring a more efficient tournament style to determine a champion, one option is single-elimination tournaments\n(Figure 13.17), where teams are paired up and the winner advances to the next round of play. The losing team is\ndefeated from tournament play and does not advance in the tournament, although some leagues offer consolation\nmatches.\nFORMULA\nThe number of games in a single-elimination tournament with teams is .\nEXAMPLE13.23\nCalculating the Number of Games in Single-Elimination Tournaments\nFind the number of games in a single-elimination tournament for each of the following numbers of teams:\n1. 4 teams\n2. 8 teams\n3. 20 teams\nSolution\n1.

As you can see, in comparing the number of games in a single round-robin\ntournament inExample 13.22with the number of games in single-elimination tournament as shown inExample 13.23,\nthe number of games required for single round-robin can quickly become unmanageable to schedule.\nThere are modifications to both the round-robin and elimination tournament styles such as double round-robin and\ndouble-elimination tournaments. Next time you observe a college or professional sporting event, see if you can\ndetermine the tournament style of play.\nWHO KNEW?\nSports Popularity Shifts\nSport has been a popular entertainment venue for hundreds of years and the popularity of various sports shifts over\ntime as well as in different regions of the world today. In today\u2019s world, the most popular sport is, overwhelmingly,\nsoccer, with over 4 billion fans followed by cricket with 2.5 billion fans. It may surprise you to learn that American\nfootball doesn\u2019t rank in the top 10 most popular sports in the world today, yet table tennis ranks in sixth place and\ngolf fills the last spot in the top 10 world sports.\nIn the early 1930s, baseball ranked a close second, with basketball virtually tying for third place. By the mid-1940s,\nhockey slightly led in first place over basketball. Ten years later, hockey remained in the number one sport, but cricket\npushed basketball to third place. In the 1960s, soccer dominated in popularity. Over the next 30 years, basketball\ndropped in popularity and there was much movement in the popularity of sports. By the late 1990s, soccer swept to\nfirst place, where it has since continued to grow in popularity.\nCheck Your Understanding\n18. How is data analytics used in sports today?\n19.

Managers, coaches,\nand pitchers study the statistics of the players on opposing teams to give their team an edge by knowing what pitches to\nthrow for the best probability to be missed by a batter. In similar fashion, batters study pitchers\u2019 statistics to learn a\npitcher\u2019s strength and how to predict what a pitcher will throw and how to best hit against a pitcher.\nThe three primary baseball statistics are batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs), which are the\ncomponents of the title of Triple Crown winner that is awarded to players who dominate in these three areas. However,\nthere is a wealth of other statistics to evaluate when studying the performance of a player.\nConduct an Internet search to research statistics and how they are calculated in the following categories:\nBatting Statistics\n1.

For clarity in this exercise, the actual fantasy football\nplayers will be denoted as FFP and actual professional team members will be denoted as players.\nWhile some fantasy football leagues have slightly different setups or scoring systems, most share some common\nelements.\nOften using a lottery system to determine who picks first, second, and so on, FFPs select 15 current players to comprise\ntheir personal fantasy football team. The players selected can be from any professional teams and a FFP can utilize any\nteam recognized by their league. FFPs can elect to keep the same players on their team for the whole league play or\ntrade for any player not selected by another FFP in their league.\nAt the start of each week during football season, each fantasy football player selects their roster of actual players to\ncomprise their roster of starting players. Typically, a starting roster consists of the following players:\nNumber to Select Position Abbreviation Position Title\nQB Quarterback\nK Kicker\nTE Tight End\nRB Running Back\nD/ST Defense\nWR Wide receiver\nRB or WR Flex\nAs actual professional games are played, points are tallied based on your league\u2019s scoring system. The points the team\nmembers on your starting roster make during the week are computed and whichever FFP has the highest score for the\nweek wins that week.\nThe FFPs with the best records of wins versus losses enters fantasy football playoffs to determine the ultimate league\nchampion and collects the pot.\nThe above overview of fantasy football describes the basic game play. The fun comes in understanding and analyzing the\nmath behind the scoring.\n1. Talk to people you know who have played fantasy football in the past and interview them. Inquire about how they\nselect players and how league(s) they have played in have computed the weekly scoring.\na. Was a league manager recruited to manage the record keeping of scores?\nb. Was an online scoring system utilized or did the fantasy football use a streamlined or specialized scoring\nsystem?\nc. What strategies were used to select the team of 15 players and who would be on the weekly starting roster?\nd. Were any online resources utilized to aid in choosing which players to select?\ne. How was math utilized to select team members or who to place as a starter each week? Be as specific as\npossible, citing examples when available. 1454 13 \u2022 Chapter Summary\n2. Conduct an Internet research to find two different resources that a FFP could utilize when selecting players for their\nteam or for their starting roster. Describe the math involved in the resources.\n3. Conduct an Internet research to learn more about the scoring utilized by fantasy football leagues. Write a short\nparagraph sharing how the use of math and knowledge of football statistics is used and how they are calculated to\naid a FFP in selecting their team and starting roster.\nMath and Hockey\nHockey is full of math from obvious components such as scoring and statistics to the shape of the rink and the angles\ninvolved in puck movement.\nCollegiate and professional hockey games are 60 minutes long and are divided into three periods of 20 (60/3) minutes\neach. At any one time, there are five players and one goalie on the ice for each team. If a player is called on a penalty and\nis placed in the penalty box, that team now has four players, which is 20% less players on the ice competing against five\nopponents. In some instances, a team may have two players in the penalty box at one time, resulting in three players, or\n40% less players on the ice compared to a full team. Being one player down for a 2-minute penalty or potentially 5\nminutes for a major penalty leads to an imbalance on the ice and calls for a quick change of offense and defense\nstrategy.\nRink Composition\u2014North American\nAn ice rink is comprised of various geometrical shapes, each with precise dimensions.\n1. Research the dimensions of a hockey rink and draw an accurate scale model on graph paper. Be sure to include the\nscale for your model and indicate all units.\n2.

While players are not carrying\nprotractors and measuring angles during play, mental calculation of angles is a constant in any successful player\u2019s\nthinking. A goalie is not physically able to cover the entire open net region and a player must calculate an angle to kick\nthe ball consistent with the net opening while predicting the ability of the goalie to stop the ball from entering the net.\n1. Research angles as they apply to soccer play. Provide two examples of different plays indicating angle of a player\u2019s\nbody, angle of foot striking the ball, and angle to the net. Include relevant dimensions. Adding a diagram that may\naid in clarity is an option.\n2. Draw a scale model of a soccer field including dimensions with labels.\nUsing an Internet search, select two top soccer players from the same league to answer the following questions:\n3.

In the expression , 10 is called\nthebase, and 5 is called theexponent, orpower. The exponent 5 is telling us to multiply the base 10 by itself 5 times.\nSo, . By definition, any number raised to the 0 power is 1. So, .\nIn the following table, there are several nonnegative integer powers of 10 that have been written as a product. Notice\nthat higher exponents result in larger products. What do you notice about the number of zeros in the resulting product?\nExponential Form Product Number of Zeros in Product\nThat\u2019s right! The number of zeros is the same as the power each time!\nNegative Integer Powers of 10\nThereciprocalof a number is 1 divided by that number. For example, the reciprocal of 10 is . We use negative\nexponents to indicate a reciprocal. For example, . Similarly, any expression with a negative exponent\ncan be written with a positive exponent by taking the reciprocal. Several negative powers of 10 have been simplified in\nthe table that follows. What do you notice about the number of zeros in the denominator (bottom) of each fraction?\nExponential Form Equivalent Simplified Expression Number of Zeros in Denominator\nThat\u2019s right! The number of zeros is the same as the positive version of the power each time.\nIn the following table, we will write the same powers of 10 as decimals. Count the number of decimal places to the right\nof the decimal point. What do you notice? 1460 A \u2022 Co-Req Appendix: Integer Powers of 10\nExponential Form Equivalent Simplified Expression Number of Decimal Places to Right of Decimal\nThat\u2019s right! The number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point is the same as the positive version of the\npower each time.\nMultiplying Integers by Positive Powers of 10\nDid you know that the distance from the sun to Earth is over 90 million miles? This value can be represented as\n90,000,000, or we can write it as a product: , which is actually a more compact way of writing 90\nmillion. Notice that the power of 7 reflects the number of zeros in 90 million. Several products of positive integers and\npowers of 10 are given in the table that follows. Notice that the number of zeros is the same as the exponent except in\none case.\nExponential Form Product Number of Zeros in Product\nThe only case in which the number of zeros didn\u2019t equal the exponent was the last case. Why do you think that\nhappened? That\u2019s right! We multiplied by 70 which also had a zero. So, the product had a zero from the 70 and 5 zeros\nfrom for a total of 6 zeros in 7,000,000.\nMultiplying by Negative Powers of 10\nAs we have seen, negative powers of 10 are decimals. Several products of positive integers and powers of 10 are given in\nthe table below. Notice that multiplying an integer by 10 raised to a negative integer power results in a smaller number\nthan you started with. Also, the number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point is the same as the exponent\nexcept in one case.\nExponential Form Product Number of Decimal Places to Right of Decimal\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 Co-Req Appendix: Integer Powers of 10 1461\nExponential Form Product Number of Decimal Places to Right of Decimal\nThe only case in which the number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point didn\u2019t equal the positive version of\nthe exponent was the last case. Why do you think that happened? That\u2019s right! We multiplied by 70, which ended in zero.\nMoving the Decimal Place\nA helpful shortcut when multiplying a number by a power of 10 is to \u201cmove the decimal point.\u201d The following table shows\nseveral powers of 10, both positive and negative. Compare the location of the decimal point in the original number to\nthe location of the decimal point in the product. How has it changed?\nExponential How the Position of the Decimal Point\nProduct\nForm Changed\nNotice that multiplying by a positive power of 10 moves the decimal point to the right, making the value larger, while\nmultiplying by a negative power of 10 moves the decimal point to the left, making the value smaller. Also, the number of\ndecimal places that the decimal point moves is exactly the positive version of the exponent. 1462 A \u2022 Co-Req Appendix: Integer Powers of 10\nAccess for free at openstax.org Answer Key 1463\nAnswer Key\nChapter 1\nYour Turn\n1.1\n1.

The citizens would likely favor the Jefferson method of apportionment most since they\nreceived the most seats by that method. They would likely favor the Adams and Webster methods of apportionment\nleast because they received the least number of seats by those method.\n2. As a group the other three states received nine seats by either the Hamilton method, seven seats by the Jefferson\nMethod, and ten seats by either the Adams method or the Webster method. They would likely favor the Adams\nmethod and Webster method most and favor the Jefferson methods least.\n11.41\n1. State A loses 0, seats State B loses 0, and State C loses 3.\n2. State A loses 0 seats, State B loses 1, and State C loses 4.\n3. State C, the largest state, loses the most representatives each time the divisor is increased.\n11.42\n1. The standard divisor is 214,079.1236 citizens per seat. The standard quota for Colorado is 2.5210 seats.\n2. The standard divisor is 213,479.4622 citizens per seat. The standard quota for Colorado is 2.5281 seats.\n3. The standard quota increased.\n4. It must have been the case that either the fractional part 0.5281 ranked lower amongst the other fractional parts of\nthe state quotas than the fractional part 0.5210 did, or there were fewer remaining seats to be distributed, or both.\n11.43\n1. The final apportionment is: A 183, B 124, C 14, and D 2, which sums to 323.\n2. The final apportionment is: A 184, B 125, C 13, and D 2, which sums to 324.\n3.
