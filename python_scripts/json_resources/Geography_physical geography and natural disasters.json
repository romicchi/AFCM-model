{"text":"1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF\nKNOWING\nThe Nature of Science\nScience can be defined as the systematic examination of the natural\nworld\u2019s structure and functioning, including its physical and\nbiological attributes. Science is also a rapidly expanding body of\nknowledge, whose ultimate goal is to discover the most\nstraightforward general principles that can explain the enormous\ncomplexity of nature. These principles can be used to gain insights\ninto the natural world and make predictions about future change.\nScience is a relatively new way of learning about natural\nphenomena, having largely replaced the influences of less objective\nmethods and world views. The primary alternatives to science are\nbelief systems that are influential in all cultures, including those\nbased on religion, morality, and aesthetics. These belief systems are\nprimarily directed toward different ends than science, such as\nfinding meaning that transcends mere existence, learning how\npeople ought to behave, and understanding the value of artistic\nexpression.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nModern science evolved from a way of learning called natural\nphilosophy, which was developed by classical Greeks and was\nconcerned with the rational investigation of existence, knowledge,\nand phenomena. Compared with modern science, however, studies\nin natural philosophy used unsophisticated technologies and\nmethods and were not mainly quantitative, sometimes involving\nonly the application of logic.\nInductive and Deductive Logic\nThe English philosopher Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was highly 6 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\ninfluential in the development of modern science. Bacon was not an\nactual practitioner of science but was a strong proponent of its\nemerging methodologies. He promoted the application of\ninductive logic, in which conclusions are developed from the\naccumulating evidence of experience and the results of experiments.\nInductive logic can lead to unifying explanations based on large\nbodies of data and observations of phenomena. Consider the\nfollowing illustration of inductive logic, applied to an\nenvironmental topic:\n\u2022 Observation 1: Marine mammals off the Atlantic coast have\nsignificant DDT residues and other chlorinated hydrocarbons\nin their fat and other body tissues.\n\u2022 Observation 2: So do marine mammals off British Columbia.\n\u2022 Observation 3: As do those in the Arctic Ocean, although in\nlower concentrations.\nInductive conclusion: There is widespread contamination of\nmarine mammals with chlorinated hydrocarbons. Further research\nmay demonstrate that contamination is a global phenomenon. This\nsuggests a potentially crucial environmental problem.\n(Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book Publishing, n.d.)\nIn contrast, deductive logic involves making one or more initial\nassumptions and then drawing logical conclusions from those\npremises. Consequently, the truth of a deductive conclusion\ndepends on the veracity of the original assumptions. If those\nassumptions are based on false information or supernatural beliefs,\nthen any deduced conclusions are likely to be wrong. Consider the\nfollowing illustration of deductive logic: 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 7\n\u2022 Assumption 1: TCDD, an extremely toxic chemical in the\ndioxin family, is poisonous when present in even the smallest\nconcentrations in food and water \u2013 even a single molecule can\ncause toxicity.\n\u2022 Assumption 2: Exposure to anything poisonous in even the\nsmallest concentrations is unsafe.\n\u2022 Assumption 3: No unsafe exposure should be allowed.\nDeductive conclusion 1: No exposure to TCDD is safe.\nDeductive conclusion 2: No emissions of TCDD should be\nallowed.\nThe two conclusions are consistent with the original assumptions.\nHowever, there is disagreement among highly qualified scientists\nabout those assumptions. Many toxicologists believe that exposure\nto TCDD (and any other potentially toxic chemicals) must exceed a\nthreshold of biological tolerance before poisoning results. In\ncontrast, other scientists believe that even the smallest exposure to\nTCDD carries some degree of toxic risk. Thus, the strength of\ndeductive logic depends on the acceptance and truth of the original\nassumptions from which its conclusions flow.\nIn general, inductive logic plays a much stronger role in modern\nscience than does deductive logic. In both cases, however, the\nusefulness of any conclusions depends significantly on the accuracy\nof any observations and other data on which they were based. Poor\ndata may lead to an inaccurate conclusion through the application\nof inductive logic, as will inappropriate assumptions in deductive\nlogic. (Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book Publishing, n.d.) 8 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nUnderstanding Science\nScientists seek to understand the fundamental principles that\nexplain natural patterns and processes. Science is more than just a\nbody of knowledge; science provides a means to evaluate and create\nnew knowledge without bias. Scientists use objective evidence over\nsubjective evidence to reach sound and logical conclusions.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nObjective observation is without personal bias and the same by all\nindividuals. Humans are biased by nature, so they cannot be\ncompletely objective; the goal is to be unbiased. A subjective 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 9\nobservation is based on a person\u2019s feelings and beliefs and is unique\nto that individual.\nAnother way scientists avoid bias is by using quantitative over\nqualitative measurements whenever\npossible. Quantitative measurement is expressed with a specific\nnumerical value. Qualitative observations are general or relative\ndescriptions. For example, describing a rock as red or heavy is a\nqualitative observation. Determining a rock\u2019s color by measuring\nwavelengths of reflected light or its density by measuring the\nproportions of minerals it contains is quantitative. Numerical\nvalues are more precise than general descriptions, and they can be\nanalyzed using statistical calculations. This is why quantitative\nmeasurements are much more useful to scientists than qualitative\nobservations.\nIt is challenging to establish truth in science because all scientific\nclaims are falsifiable, which means any initial hypothesis may be\ntested and proven false. Only after exhaustively eliminating false\nresults, competing ideas, and possible variations does a hypothesis\nbecome regarded as a reliable scientific theory. This meticulous\nscrutiny reveals weaknesses or flaws in a hypothesis and is the\nstrength that supports all scientific ideas and procedures. Proving\ncurrent ideas are wrong has been the driving force behind many\nscientific careers. 10 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nFalsifiability separates science from pseudoscience. Scientists are\nwary of explanations of natural phenomena that discourage or\navoid falsifiability. An explanation that cannot be tested or does not\nmeet scientific standards is not considered science, but\npseudoscience. Pseudoscience is a collection of ideas that may\nappear scientific but does not use the scientific method. Astrology\nis an example of pseudoscience. It is a belief system that attributes\nthe movement of celestial bodies to influencing human behavior.\nAstrologers rely on celestial observations, but their conclusions are\nnot based on experimental evidence, and their statements are not\nfalsifiable. This is not to be confused with astronomy, which is the\nscientific study of celestial bodies and the cosmos. 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 11\nScience is also a social process. Scientists share their ideas with peers\nat conferences, seeking guidance and feedback. Research papers and\ndata submitted for publication are rigorously reviewed by qualified\npeers, scientists who are experts in the same field. The scientific\nreview process aims to weed out misinformation, invalid research\nresults, and wild speculation. Thus, it is slow, cautious, and\nconservative. Scientists tend to wait until a hypothesis is supported\nby an overwhelming amount of evidence from many independent\nresearchers before accepting it as a scientific theory.\nGoals of Science\nThe broad goals of science are to understand natural phenomena\nand explain how they may be changing over time. To achieve those\ngoals, scientists undertake investigations based on information,\ninferences, and conclusions developed through a systematic\napplication of logic, usually of the inductive sort. As such, scientists\ncarefully observe natural phenomena and conduct experiments.\nA higher goal of scientific research is to formulate laws that describe\nthe workings of the universe in general terms. Universal laws, along\nwith theories and hypotheses, are used to understand and explain\nnatural phenomena. However, many natural phenomena are\nincredibly complicated and may never be fully understood in terms\nof physical laws. This is particularly true of the ways that organisms\nand ecosystems are organized and function. 12 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nScientific investigations may be pure or applied. Pure science is\ndriven by intellectual curiosity \u2013 it is the unfettered search for\nknowledge and understanding, without regard for its usefulness in\nhuman welfare. Applied science is more goal-oriented and deals\nwith practical difficulties and problems of one sort or another.\nApplied science might examine how to improve technology,\nadvance the management of natural resources, or reduce pollution\nor other environmental damages associated with human activities.\n(Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book Publishing, n.d.)\nFacts, Hypotheses, and 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 13\nExperiments\nA fact is an event or thing known to have happened, to exist, and to\nbe true. Facts are based on experience and scientific evidence. In\ncontrast, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for the occurrence\nof a phenomenon. Scientists formulate hypotheses as statements\nand then test them through experiments and other forms of\nresearch. Hypotheses are developed using logic, inference, and\nmathematical arguments in order to explain observed phenomena.\nHowever, it must always be possible to refute a scientific\nhypothesis. Thus, the hypothesis that \u201ccats are so intelligent that\nthey prevent humans from discovering it\u201d cannot be logically\nrefuted, and so it is not a scientific hypothesis.\nA theory is a broader conception that refers to a set of\nexplanations, rules, and laws. These are supported by a large body\nof observational and experimental evidence, all leading to robust\nconclusions. The following are some of the most famous theories in\nscience:\n\u2022 the theory of gravitation, first proposed by Isaac Newton\n(1642-1727)\n\u2022 the theory of evolution by natural selection published\nsimultaneously in 1858 by two English naturalists, Charles\nDarwin (1809-1882) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913)\n\u2022 the theory of relativity, identified by the German-Swiss\nphysicist, Albert Einstein (1879-1955) 14 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nLarge bodies of evidence strongly support celebrated theories like\nthese, and they will likely persist for a long time. However, we\ncannot say that these (or any other) theories are known with\ncertainty to be exact \u2013 some future experiments may yet falsify even\nthese famous theories. (Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book\nPublishing, n.d.)\nScientific Method\nThe scientific method begins with identifying a question\ninvolving the structure or function of the natural world, which is\nusually developed using inductive logic. The question is interpreted 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 15\nin terms of existing theory, and specific hypotheses are formulated\nto explain the character and causes of the natural phenomenon.\nThe research might involve observations made in nature or carefully\ncontrolled experiments, and the results usually give scientists\nreasons to reject hypotheses rather than accept them. Most\nhypotheses are rejected because their predictions are not borne out\nduring research. Any viable hypotheses are further examined\nthrough additional research, primarily involving experiments\ndesigned to disprove their predictions. Once a large body of\nevidence accumulates in support of a hypothesis, it can corroborate\nthe original theory.\nThe scientific method is only to investigate questions that can be\ncritically examined through observation and experiment.\nConsequently, science cannot resolve value-laden questions, such as\nthe meaning of life, good versus evil, or the existence and qualities\nof God or any other supernatural being or force. 16 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nAn experiment is a test or investigation designed to provide\nevidence in support of, or preferably against, a hypothesis. A\nnatural experiment is conducted by observing actual variations of\nphenomena in nature, and then developing explanations by\nanalyzing possible causal mechanisms. A manipulative\nexperiment involves the deliberate alteration of factors that are\nhypothesized to influence phenomena. The manipulations are\ncarefully planned and controlled to determine whether predicted\nresponses will occur, thereby uncovering causal relationships.\nBy far, the most useful working hypotheses in scientific research are\ndesigned to disprove rather than support. A null hypothesis is a\nspecific testable investigation that denies something implied by the 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 17\ncentral hypothesis being studied. Unless null hypotheses are\neliminated based on contrary evidence, we cannot be confident of\nthe central hypothesis. (Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book\nPublishing, n.d.)\nThis is an essential aspect of scientific investigation. For instance, a\nparticular hypothesis might be supported by many confirming\nexperiments or observations. However, this does not serve to\n\u201cprove\u201d the hypothesis; instead, it only supports its conditional\nacceptance. As soon as a clearly defined hypothesis is falsified by an\nappropriately designed and well-conducted experiment, it is\ndisproved for all time. This is why experiments designed to disprove\nhypotheses are a vital aspect of the scientific method.\nRevolutionary advances in understanding may occur when an\nimportant hypothesis or theory is rejected through discoveries of\nscience. For instance, once it was discovered that the Earth is not\nflat, it became possible to sail beyond the visible horizon\nconfidently without fear of falling off the edge of the world.\nAnother example involved the discovery by Copernicus that the\nplanets of our solar system revolve around the Sun. The related\nconcept that the Sun is an ordinary star among many \u2013 these\nrevolutionary ideas replaced the previously dominant one that the\nplanets, Sun, and stars all revolved around the Earth.\nThomas Kuhn (1922-1995) was a philosopher of science who\nemphasized the critical role of \u201cscientific revolutions\u201d in achieving\nsignificant advances in our understanding of the natural world. In\nessence, Kuhn (1996) said that a scientific revolution occurs when a\nwell-established theory is rigorously tested and then collapses under\nthe accumulating weight of new facts and observations that cannot 18 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nbe explained. This renders the original theory obsolete, to be\nreplaced by a new, more informed paradigm (i.e., a set of\nassumptions, concepts, practices, and values that constitutes a way\nof viewing reality and is shared by an intellectual community).\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nA variable is a factor that is believed to influence a natural\nphenomenon. For example, a scientist might hypothesize that the\nproductivity of a wheat crop is potentially limited by such variables\nas the availability of water or nutrients such as nitrogen and\nphosphorus. Some of the most powerful scientific experiments\ninvolve manipulating key (or controlling) variables and comparing\nthe results of those treatments with a control that was not\nmanipulated. In the example just described, the specific variable 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 19\nthat controls wheat productivity could be identified by conducting\nan experiment in which test populations are provided with varying\namounts of water, nitrogen, and phosphorus, alone and in\ncombination, and then comparing the results with a non-\nmanipulated control.\nIn some respects, however, the explanation of the scientific method\noffered above is a bit uncritical. It perhaps suggests a too-orderly\nprogression in terms of logical, objective experimentation and\ncomparison of alternative hypotheses. These are, in fact, essential\ncomponents of the scientific method. Nevertheless, it is essential to\nunderstand that scientists\u2019 insights and personal biases are also\nsignificant in the conduct and progress of science. In most cases,\nscientists design research that they think will \u201cwork\u201d to yield useful\nresults and contribute to the orderly advancement of knowledge in\ntheir field. Karl Popper (1902-1994), a European philosopher,\nnoted that scientists tend to use their \u201cimaginative preconception\u201d\nof the workings of the natural world to design experiments based\non their informed insights. This means that competent scientists\nmust be more than knowledgeable and technically skilled \u2013 they\nshould also be capable of a degree of insightful creativity when\nforming their ideas, hypotheses, and research. (Environmental\nScience \u2013 Simple Book Publishing, n.d.)\nUncertainty\nMuch scientific investigation involves the collection of observations\nby measuring phenomena in the natural world. Another essential\naspect of science involves making predictions values of variables. 20 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nSuch projections require a degree of understanding of the\nrelationships among variables, influencing factors, and recent\npatterns of change. However, many kinds of scientific information\nand predictions are subject to inaccuracy. This occurs because\nmeasured data are often approximations of the true values of\nphenomena, and predictions are rarely fulfilled precisely. The\naccuracy of observations and predictions is influenced by various\nfactors, primarily those described in the following sections.\n(Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book Publishing, n.d.)\nPredictability\nA few phenomena are considered to have a universal character and\nare consistent wherever and whenever they are accurately measured.\nOne of the best examples of such a universal constant is the speed of\nlight, which always has a value of 2.998 \u00d7 108 meters per second,\nregardless of where it is measured or of the speed of the body from\nwhich the light is emitted. Similarly, certain relationships describing\ntransformations of energy and matter, known as the laws of\nthermodynamics, always give reliable predictions.\nHowever, most natural phenomena are not consistent \u2013 depending\non circumstances, there are exceptions to general predictions about\nthem. This circumstance is particularly true of biology and ecology,\nrelated fields of science in which almost all general predictions have\nexceptions. Laws or unifying principles of biology or ecology have\nnot yet been discovered, compared to the several esteemed laws and\n11 universal constants of physics. Thus, biologists and ecologists\nhave great difficulties making accurate predictions about the\nresponses of organisms and ecosystems to environmental change. 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 21\nVariability\nMany natural phenomena are highly variable in space and time.\nThis is true of physical and chemical variables as well as biological\nand ecological ones. Within a forest, the amount of sunlight\nreaching the ground varies significantly with time, depending on\nthe hour of the day and the season of the year. It varies spatially,\ndepending on the density of foliage over any place where sunlight is\nbeing measured. Similarly, the density of a particular species of fish\nwithin a river typically varies in response to changes in habitat\nconditions and other influences. Most fish populations also vary\nover time, mainly migratory species such as salmon. In\nenvironmental science, replicated (or independently repeated)\nmeasurements and statistical analyses are used to measure and\naccount for these temporal and spatial variations.\nAccuracy and Precision\nAccuracy refers to the degree to which a measurement or\nobservation reflects the actual or true value of the subject. For\nexample, the insecticide DDT and the metal mercury are\npotentially toxic chemicals that occur in trace concentrations in all\norganisms, but their small residues are challenging to analyze\nchemically. Some of the analytical methods used to determine the\nconcentrations of DDT and mercury are more accurate than others\nand provide relatively useful and reliable data compared with less\naccurate methods. Analytical data are usually approximations of the\nreal values \u2013 rigorous accuracy is rarely attainable.\nPrecision is related to the degree of repeatability of a measurement 22 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nor observation. For example, suppose that the actual number of\ncaribou in a migrating herd is 10,246 animals. A wildlife ecologist\nmight estimate that there were about 10,000 animals in that herd,\nwhich for practical purposes is a reasonably accurate reckoning of\nthe actual number of caribou. If other ecologists also independently\nestimate the herd\u2019s size at about 10,000 caribou, there is a\nreasonable degree of precision among the values. If, however, some\nsystematic bias existed in the methodology used to count the herd,\ngiving consistent estimates of 15,000 animals (remember, the actual\npopulation is 10 246 caribou), these estimates would be considered\nprecise, but not particularly accurate.\nPrecision is also related to the number of digits with which data are\nreported. If you were using a flexible tape to measure the lengths of\n10 large, wriggly snakes, you would probably measure the reptiles\nonly to the nearest centimeter. The strength and squirminess of the\nanimals make more precise measurements impossible. The reported\naverage length of the ten snakes should reflect the original\nmeasurements and might be given 204 cm and not a value such as\n203.8759 cm. The latter number might be displayed as a digital\naverage by a calculator or computer, but it is unrealistically precise.\nSignificant figures are related to accuracy and precision and can\nbe defined as the number of digits used to report data from analyses\nor calculations. Examples most easily understand significant figures.\nThe number 179 has three significant figures, as does the number of\n0.0849 and 0.000794 (the zeros preceding the significant integers\ndo not count). However, the number 195,000,000 has nine\nsignificant figures (the zeros following are meaningful), although\nthe number 195 \u00d7 106 has only three significant figures. 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 23\nIt is rarely useful to report environmental or ecological data to more\nthan 2-4 significant figures. This is because any more would\ngenerally exceed the accuracy and precision of the methodology\nused in the estimation and would be unrealistic. For example, the\nUnited States approximate population in 2020 was 330 million\npeople, (or 330 \u00d7 106; both of these notations have three significant\nfigures). However, the population should not be reported as\n333,000,000, which implies an unrealistic accuracy and precision of\neight significant figures.\nA Need for Scepticism\nEnvironmental science is filled with many examples of uncertainty\n\u2013 in present values and future changes of environmental variables\nand predictions of biological and ecological responses to those\nchanges. To some degree, the difficulties associated with scientific\nuncertainty can be mitigated by developing improved methods and\ntechnologies for analysis and modeling and examining changes\noccurring in different parts of the world. The latter approach\nenhances our understanding by providing convergent evidence\nabout the occurrence and causes of natural phenomena.\nHowever, scientific information and understanding will always be\nsubject to some degree of uncertainty. Therefore, predictions will\nalways be inaccurate to some extent, and this uncertainty must be\nconsidered when trying to understand and deal with the causes and\nconsequences of environmental changes. As such, all information\nand predictions in environmental science must be critically\ninterpreted with uncertainty in mind. This should be done\nwhenever one is learning about an environmental issue, whether it 24 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\ninvolves listening to a speaker in a classroom, at a conference, or on\nvideo, or when reading an article in a newspaper, textbook, website,\nor scientific journal. Because of the uncertainty of many predictions\nin science, and particularly in the environmental realm, a certain\namount of skepticism and critical analysis is always useful.\nEnvironmental issues are acutely important to the welfare of people\nand other species. Science and its methods allow for a critical and\nobjective identification of crucial issues, the investigation of their\ncauses, and a degree of understanding of the consequences of\nenvironmental change. Scientific information influences decision\nmaking about environmental issues, including whether to pursue\nexpensive strategies to avoid further, but often uncertain, damage.\nHowever, scientific information is only one consideration for\ndecision-makers, who are also concerned with the economic,\ncultural, and political contexts of environmental problems. When\ndeciding how to deal with the causes and consequences of\nenvironmental changes, decision-makers may give greater weight to\nnon-scientific (social and economic) considerations than scientific\nones, especially when there is uncertainty about the latter. The\nmost critical decisions about environmental issues are made by\npoliticians and senior bureaucrats in government, or by private\nmanagers, rather than by environmental scientists. Decision-makers\ntypically worry about the short-term implications of their decisions\non their chances for re-election or continued employment, and on\nthe economic activity of a company or society at large, as much as\nthey do about environmental damage. (Environmental Science \u2013\nSimple Book Publishing, n.d.) That is why the United States\nstruggled so much with the COVID-19 pandemic. On one end of 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 25\nthe response, was a focus on health science. On the other were\neconomists worried about collapsing the economy. It was ultimately\nup to politicians to make the decision on how much the nation\nshould \u201clockdown\u201d and how much the nation needed to stay\neconomically \u201copen.\u201d\nScience Denial and Evaluating\nSources\nIntroductory science courses usually deal with accepted scientific\ntheory and do not include opposing ideas, even though these\nalternate ideas may be credible. This makes it easier for students to\nunderstand complex material. Advanced students will encounter\nmore controversies as they continue to study their discipline.\nSome groups argue that some established scientific theories are\nwrong, not based on their scientific merit but the group\u2019s ideology.\nThis section focuses on how to identify evidence-based information\nand differentiate it from pseudoscience.\nScience Denial\nScience denial happens when people argue that established\nscientific theories are wrong, not based on scientific merit but\nrather on subjective ideology \u2013 such as for social, political, or\neconomic reasons. Organizations and people use science denial as a\nrhetorical argument against issues or ideas they oppose. Three\nexamples of science denial versus science are: 26 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\n\u2022 Teaching evolution in public schools\n\u2022 Linking tobacco smoke to cancer\n\u2022 Linking human activity to climate change.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nAmong these, denial of climate change is strongly connected with\ngeography. A climate denier denies explicitly or doubts the objective\nconclusions of geologists and climate scientists. Science denial\ngenerally uses three false arguments. The first argument tries to\nundermine the scientific conclusion\u2019s credibility by claiming the\nresearch methods are flawed, or the theory is not universally\naccepted\u2014the science is unsettled. The notion that scientific ideas\nare not absolute creates doubt for non-scientists; however, a lack of 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 27\nuniversal truths should not be confused with scientific uncertainty.\nBecause science is based on falsifiability, scientists avoid claiming\nuniversal truths and use language that conveys uncertainty. This\nallows scientific ideas to change and evolve as more evidence is\nuncovered.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nThe second argument claims the researchers are not objective and\nmotivated by ideology or economic agenda. This is an ad\nhominem argument in which a person\u2019s character is attacked\ninstead of the merit of their argument. They claim results have been\nmanipulated so researchers can justify asking for more funding.\nThey claim that because a federal grant funds the researchers, they\nare using their results to lobby for expanded government regulation. 28 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nThe third argument is to demand a balanced view, equal time in\nmedia coverage, and educational curricula to engender the false\nillusion of two equally valid arguments. Science deniers frequently\ndemand equal coverage of their proposals, even when there is little\nscientific evidence supporting their ideology. For example, science\ndeniers might demand religious explanations to be taught as an\nalternative to the well-established theory of evolution. Alternatively,\nall possible causes of climate change are discussed as equally\nprobable, regardless of the body of evidence. Conclusions derived\nusing the scientific method should not be confused with those\nbased on ideologies.\nFurthermore, conclusions about nature derived from ideologies\nhave no place in science research and education. For example, it\nwould be inappropriate to teach the flat earth model in modern\ngeography or earth science courses because this idea has been\ndisproved by the scientific method. Unfortunately, widespread\nscientific illiteracy allows these arguments to be used to suppress\nscientific knowledge and spread misinformation. 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 29\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nThe formation of new conclusions based on the scientific method is\nthe only way to change scientific conclusions. We would not teach\nFlat Earth geology and plate tectonics because Flat Earthers do not\nfollow the scientific method. The fact that scientists avoid universal\ntruths and change their ideas as more evidence is uncovered should\nnot be seen as meaning that the science is unsettled. Because of\nwidespread scientific illiteracy, these arguments are used by those\nwho wish to suppress science and misinform the general public. 30 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nIn a classic case of science denial, beginning in the 1960s and for the\nnext three decades, the tobacco industry and their scientists used\nrhetorical arguments to deny a connection between tobacco usage\nand cancer. Once it became clear scientific studies overwhelmingly\nfound that using tobacco dramatically increased a person\u2019s\nlikelihood of getting cancer, their next strategy was to create a sense\nof doubt about the science. The tobacco industry suggested the\nresults were not yet fully understood, and more study was needed.\nThey used this doubt to lobby for delaying legislative action to\nwarn consumers of the potential health hazards. This tactic is\ncurrently employed by those who deny the significance of human\ninvolvement in climate change. 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 31\nEvaluating Sources of Information\nIn the age of the internet, information is plentiful. Geologists,\nscientists, or anyone exploring scientific inquiry must discern valid\nsources of information from pseudoscience and misinformation.\nThis evaluation is especially critical in scientific research because\nscientific knowledge is respected for its reliability. Textbooks such as\nthis one can aid this complex and crucial task. At its roots, quality\ninformation comes from the scientific method, beginning with the\nempirical thinking of Aristotle. The application of the scientific\nmethod helps produce unbiased results. A valid inference or\ninterpretation is based on objective evidence or data. Credible data\nand inferences are clearly labeled, separated, and differentiated.\nAnyone looking over the data can understand how the author\u2019s\nconclusion was derived or come to an alternative conclusion.\nScientific procedures are clearly defined, so the investigation can be\nreplicated to confirm the original results or expanded further to\nproduce new results. These measures make a scientific inquiry valid\nand its use as a source reputable. Of course, substandard work\noccasionally slips through, and retractions are published from time\nto time. An infamous article linking the MMR vaccine to autism\nappeared in the highly reputable journal Lancet in 1998. Journalists\ndiscovered that the author had multiple conflicts of interest and\nfabricated data, and the article was retracted in 2010. 32 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=5\nIn addition to methodology, data, and results, the authors of a\nstudy should be investigated. When looking into any research, the\nauthor(s) should be investigated. An author\u2019s credibility is based on\nmultiple factors, such as having a degree in a relevant topic or being\nfunded from an unbiased source.\nThe same rigor should be applied to evaluating the publisher,\nensuring the results reported come from an unbiased process. The\npublisher should be easy to discover. Good publishers will show the\nlatest papers in the journal and make their contact information and\nidentification clear. Reputable journals show their peer review style.\nSome journals are predatory, where they use unexplained and\nunnecessary fees to submit and access journals. Reputable journals 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 33\nhave recognizable editorial boards. Often, a reputable journal will\nassociate with a trade, association, or recognized open-source\ninitiative.\nOne of the hallmarks of scientific research is peer review. Research\nshould be transparent to peer review. This allows the scientific\ncommunity to reproduce experimental results, correct and retract\nerrors, and validate theories. This allows the reproduction of\nexperimental results, corrections of errors, and proper justification\nof the research to experts.\nCitation is imperative to avoid plagiarism, and also allows readers to\ninvestigate an author\u2019s line of thought and conclusions. When\nreading scientific works, it is essential to confirm that the citations\nare from reputable scientific research. Most often, scientific\ncitations are used to reference paraphrasing rather than quotes. The\nnumber of times a work is cited is said to measure the investigation\nhas within the scientific community, although this technique is\ninherently biased. (Environmental Science \u2013 Simple Book\nPublishing, n.d.)\nCritical Evaluation of an Overload of\nInformation\nMore so than any previous society, we live today in a world of\naccessible and abundant information. It has become remarkably\neasy for people to communicate with others over vast distances,\nturning the world into a \u201cglobal village\u201d (a phrase coined by\nMarshall McLuhan (1911-1980), a Canadian philosopher, to\ndescribe the phenomenon of universal networking). Technologies 34 | 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING\nhave facilitated this global connectedness for transferring ideas and\nknowledge \u2013 mainly electronic communication devices, such as\nradio, television, computers, and their networks. Today, these\ntechnologies compress space and time to achieve a virtually\ninstantaneous communication. So much information is now\navailable that the situation is often referred to as an \u201cinformation\noverload\u201d that must be analyzed critically. Critical analysis is the\nprocess of sorting information and making scientific inquiries\nabout data. Involved in all aspects of the scientific process, critical\nanalysis scrutinizes information, and research by posing sensible\nquestions such as the following:\n\u2022 Is the information derived from a scientific framework\nconsisting of a hypothesis that has been developed and tested\nwithin the context of an existing body of knowledge and\ntheory in the field?\n\u2022 Were the methodologies used likely to provide data that are\nobjective, accurate, and precise? Were the data analyzed using\nstatistical methods appropriate to the data structure and the\nquestions being asked?\n\u2022 Were the results of the research compared with other pertinent\nwork that has been previously published? Were key similarities\nand differences discussed and a conclusion deduced about\nwhat the new work reveals about the issue being investigated?\n\u2022 Is the information based on research published in a refereed\njournal that requires highly qualified reviewers in the subject\narea to scrutinize the work, followed by an editorial decision\nabout whether it warrants publication?\n\u2022 If the analysis of an issue was based on incomplete or possibly\ninaccurate information, was a precautionary approach used to 1.1 SCIENCE AS A WAY OF KNOWING | 35\naccommodate the uncertainty inherent in the\nrecommendations? All users of published research have an\nobligation to critically evaluate what they are reading in these\nways in order to decide whether the theory is appropriate, the\nmethodologies reliable, and the conclusions sufficiently\nrobust. Because so many environmental issues are\ncontroversial, with data and information presented on both\nsides of the debate, people need to formulate objectively\ncritical judgments. Thus, people need a high degree of\nenvironmental literacy \u2013 an informed understanding of the\ncauses and consequences of environmental damage. Being able\nto analyze information critically is a key personal benefit of\nstudying environmental science. 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A\nSCIENCE\nGeography is the spatial study of the earth\u2019s physical and cultural\nenvironments. Geographers study the earth\u2019s physical\ncharacteristics, its inhabitants and cultures, phenomena such as\nclimate, and the earth\u2019s place within the universe. Geography also\nexamines the spatial relationships between all physical and cultural\nphenomena in the world. Furthermore, geographers also look at\nhow the earth, its climate, and its landscapes are changing due to\ncultural intervention. Geography is a much broader field than many\npeople realize. Most people think of area studies as the whole of\ngeography. In reality, geography is the study of the earth, including\nhow human activity has changed it. Geography involves studies that\nare much broader than merely understanding the shape of the\nearth\u2019s landforms. Physical geography involves all the planet\u2019s\nphysical systems. Human geography incorporates studies of human\nculture, spatial relationships, interactions between humans and the\nenvironment, and many other research areas that involve the\ndifferent subspecialties of geography. Students interested in a career\nin geography would be well served to learn geospatial techniques\nand gain skills and experience in GIS and remote sensing, as they are\nthe areas within geography where employment opportunities have\ngrown the most over the past few decades. 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE | 37\nThemes of Geography\n\u201cPathemetric Data\u201d by NOAA is licensed under Public Domain.\nGeography helps us make sense of the world through four historical\ntraditions. Spatial analysis includes many of the concepts tied to\ngeospatial technology: the study and analysis between the\ninteractions and distribution patterns of the physical and human\nenvironments using spatial technology such as geographic\ninformation systems, satellite imagery, aerial photography and\ndrones, global positioning systems, and more. Earth science\nincludes the study of landforms, climates, and the distribution of\nplants and animals. Regional studies focus on a particular region\nto understand the dynamics of a specific interaction between\nhuman activity and the environment. Researchers studying\nhuman-landscape interaction examine the impact of humans on\ntheir landscape and find out how different cultures have used and\nchanged their environments. Geography provides the tools to\nintegrate knowledge from many disciplines into a usable form by\nproviding a sense of place to natural or human events. Geography 38 | 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE\noften explains why or how something occurs in a specific location.\nWorld geography utilizes the spatial approach to help understand\nthe components of our global community.\nThe discipline of geography can be broken down into three\nfundamental areas of focus: physical geography, human geography,\nand world regional geography. These fundamental areas are similar\nin that they use a spatial perspective, and include the study of place\nand the comparison of one place with another.\nPhysical Geography\nPhysical geography is the spatial study of natural phenomena that\nmake up the environment, such as rivers, mountains, landforms,\nweather, climate, soils, plants, and any other physical aspects of the\nearth\u2019s surface. Physical geography focuses on geography as a form\nof earth science. It tends to emphasize the main physical parts of the\nearth \u2013 the lithosphere (surface layer), the atmosphere (air), the\nhydrosphere (water), and the biosphere (living organisms)\u2014and the\nrelationships between these parts. 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE | 39\n\u201cMerapi in Java, Indonesia\u201d by Brigitte Werner is licensed as Public\nDomain.\nSome researchers are environmental geographers, part of an\nemerging field that studies the spatial aspects and cultural\nperceptions of the natural environment. Environmental\ngeography requires an understanding of both physical and human\ngeography, as well as an understanding of how humans\nconceptualize their environment and the physical landscape.\nThe physical landscape is the term used to describe the natural\nterrain at any one place on the planet. The natural forces of erosion,\nweather, tectonic plate action, and water have formed the earth\u2019s\nphysical features. Many states and national parks in the United\nStates attempt to preserve unique physical landscapes for the public\nto enjoy, such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Grand Canyon. 40 | 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE\nHuman Geography\nHuman geography is the study of human activity and its\nrelationship to the earth\u2019s surface. Human geographers examine the\nspatial distribution of human populations, religions, languages,\nethnicities, political systems, economics, urban dynamics, and other\ncomponents of human activity. They study patterns of interaction\nbetween human cultures and various environments and focus on\nthe causes and consequences of human settlement and distribution\nover the landscape. While the economic and cultural aspects of\nhumanity are the primary focus of human geography, these aspects\ncannot be understood without describing the landscape on which\neconomic and cultural activities occur.\n\u201cRed Square, Moscow, Russia\u201d by Valerii Tkachenko is licensed\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.\nThe cultural landscape is the term used to describe those parts of 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE | 41\nthe earth\u2019s surface that have been altered or created by humans. For\nexample, the urban cultural landscape of a city may include\nbuildings, streets, signs, parking lots, or vehicles, while the rural\ncultural landscape may consist of fields, orchards, fences, barns, or\nfarmsteads. Cultural forces unique to a given place \u2013 such as\nreligion, language, ethnicity, customs, or heritage \u2013 influence the\ncultural landscape of that place at a given time. The colors, sizes,\nand shapes of the cultural landscape usually symbolize some level of\nsignificance regarding societal norms. Spatial dynamics assist in\nidentifying and evaluating cultural differences between places.\nWorld Regional Geography\nWorld regional geography studies various world regions as they\ncompare with the rest of the world. Factors for comparison include\nboth the physical and the cultural landscape. The main questions\nare, Who lives there? What are their lives like? What do they do for\na living? Physical factors of significance can include location,\nclimate type, and terrain. Human factors include cultural\ntraditions, ethnicity, language, religion, economics, and politics. 42 | 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE\n\u201cBig Ben, London\u201d by Pixabay.\nWorld regional geography focuses on regions of various sizes across\nthe earth\u2019s landscape and aspires to understand the unique\ncharacter of regions in terms of their natural and cultural attributes.\nSpatial studies can play an essential role in regional geography. The\nscientific approach can focus on the distribution of cultural and\nnatural phenomena within regions as delimited by various natural\nand cultural factors. The focus is on the spatial relationships within\nany field of study, such as regional economics, resource\nmanagement, regional planning, and landscape ecology.\nThe regions studied in world regional geography can be combined\ninto more substantial portions called realms. Realms are large areas\nof the planet, usually, with multiple regions that share the same\ngeneral geographic location. Regions are cohesive areas within each\nrealm. 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE | 43\nCareers in Geography and GIS\nGeography is not a discipline of endlessly memorizing capitals,\ncountries, rivers, mountain ranges, and more. The discipline is\nabout scientifically analyzing the spatial and temporal distribution,\nconnections, and patterns of the physical and cultural\nenvironments we live within.\nThe following information on careers in geography is from the\nwebsite of the Association of American Geographers (AAG), which\nis a resource for those interested in pursuing employment in the\nfield of geography.\nMany occupations require knowledge of and skills in geography.\nGeographers work in many different areas, such as environmental\nmanagement, education, disaster response, city and county\nplanning, community development, and more. Geography is an\ninterdisciplinary field that offers diverse career opportunities.\nMany geographers pursue rewarding careers in business; local, state,\nor federal government agencies, nonprofit organizations; and\nschools. Geographers with graduate (master\u2019s and doctorate)\ndegrees may become educators in higher education (community\ncolleges and universities). 44 | 1.2 GEOGRAPHY AS A SCIENCE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Maps and mapping\ntechnology are literally and virtually everywhere. Though the\nmodes and means of making and distributing maps have been\nrevolutionized with recent advances in computing like the Internet,\nthe art and science of map-making dates back centuries. This is\nbecause humans are inherently spatial organisms, and in order for\nus to live in the world, we must first somehow relate to it. Enter the\nmental map.\nMental Maps\nMental or cognitive maps are psychological tools that we all use\nevery day. As the name suggests, mental maps are maps of our\nenvironment that are stored in our brains. We rely on our mental\nmaps to get from one place to another, to plan our daily activities,\nor to understand and situate events that we hear about from our\nfriends, family, or the news. Mental maps also reflect the amount\nand extent of geographic knowledge and spatial awareness that we\npossess.\nMental maps tend to have the following characteristics: 48 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u2022 Mental maps illustrate what we know about the places we live.\nThey are rough \u201csketches\u201d or ideas of our geographic\nknowledge of an area.\n\u2022 Mental maps highlight how we relate to our local\nenvironment.\n\u2022 What we choose to include and exclude on our map provides\ninsights about what places we think are important and how we\nmove through our places of residence.\n\u2022 When we compare our mental maps to someone else\u2019s from\nthe same place, certain similarities emerge that shed light upon\nhow we as humans tend to think spatially and organize\ngeographical information in our minds.\nTo reinforce these points, consider the series of mental maps of Los\nAngeles provided below. Take a moment to look at each map and\ncompare the maps with the following questions in mind:\n\u2022 What similarities are there on each map?\n\u2022 What are some of the differences?\n\u2022 Which places or features are illustrated on the map?\n\u2022 From what you know about Los Angeles, what is included or\nexcluded on the maps?\n\u2022 What assumptions are made in each map?\n\u2022 At what scale is the map drawn? 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 49\n\u201cMental Map of Los Angeles A\u201d is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 License. 50 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u201cMental Map of Los Angeles B\u201d is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 License. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 51\n\u201cMental Map of Los Angeles C\u201d is licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 License.\nEach map is probably an imperfect representation of one\u2019s mental\nmap. However, we can see some similarities and differences that\nprovide insights into how people relate to Los Angeles, maps, and,\nmore generally, the world. First, all maps are oriented so that north\nis up. Though only one of the maps contains a north arrow that\nexplicitly informs viewers of the geographic orientation of the map,\nwe are accustomed to most maps having north at the top of the\npage. Second, all but the first map identify some prominent features\nand landmarks in the Los Angeles area. For instance, Los Angeles\nInternational Airport (LAX) appears on two of these maps, as do\nthe Santa Monica Mountains. How the airport is represented or\nportrayed on the map, for instance, as text, an abbreviation, or\nsymbol, also speaks to our experience using and understanding 52 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nmaps. Third, two of the maps depict a portion of the freeway\nnetwork in Los Angeles, and one also highlights the Los Angeles\nRiver and Ballona Creek. In a city where the \u201ccar is king,\u201d how can\nany map omit the freeways?\nWhat we include and omit on our mental maps, by choice or not,\nspeaks volumes about our geographical knowledge and spatial\nawareness. Recognizing and identifying what we do not know is an\nessential part of learning. It is only when we identify the unknown\nthat we can ask questions, collect information to answer those\nquestions, develop knowledge through answers, and begin to\nunderstand the world where we live.\nAsking Geographic Questions\nFilling in the gaps in our mental maps and, more generally, the gaps\nin our geographic knowledge requires us to ask questions about the\nworld where we live and how we relate to it. Such questions can be\nsimple with a local focus (e.g., \u201cWhich way is the nearest hospital?\u201d)\nor more complex with a more global perspective (e.g., \u201cHow is\nurbanization impacting biodiversity hotspots around the world?\u201d).\nThe thread that unifies such questions is geography. For instance,\nthe question of \u201cwhere?\u201d is an essential part of the questions\n\u201cWhere is the nearest hospital?\u201d and \u201cWhere are the biodiversity\nhotspots concerning cities?\u201d Being able to articulate questions\nclearly and to break them into manageable pieces are valuable skills\nwhen using and applying a geographic information system (GIS). 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 53\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=29\nThough there may be no such thing as a \u201cdumb\u201d question, some\nquestions are indeed better than others. Learning how to ask the\nright question takes practice and is often more difficult than finding\nthe answer itself. However, when we ask the right question,\nproblems are more easily solved, and our understanding of the\nworld is improved. There are five general types of geographic\nquestions that we can ask and that GIS can help us to answer. Each\ntype of question is listed here and is also followed by a few examples\n(Nyerges 1991). Nyerges, T. 1991. \u201cAnalytical Map Use.\u201d\nCartography and Geographic Information Systems (formerly The\nAmerican Cartographer) 18: 11\u201322.\nQuestions about geographic location: 54 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u2022 Where is it?\n\u2022 Why is it here or there?\n\u2022 How much of it is here or there?\nQuestions about geographic distribution:\n\u2022 Is it distributed locally or globally?\n\u2022 Is it spatially clustered or dispersed?\n\u2022 Where are the boundaries?\nQuestions about geographic association:\n\u2022 What else is near it?\n\u2022 What else occurs with it?\n\u2022 What is absent in its presence?\nQuestions about geographic interaction:\n\u2022 Is it linked to something else?\n\u2022 What is the nature of this association?\n\u2022 How much interaction occurs between the locations?\nQuestions about geographic change:\n\u2022 Has it always been here?\n\u2022 How has it changed over time and space?\n\u2022 What causes its diffusion or contraction?\nThese and related geographic questions are frequently asked by\npeople from various areas of expertise, industries, and professions. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 55\nFor instance, urban planners, traffic engineers, and demographers\nmay be interested in understanding the commuting patterns\nbetween cities and suburbs (geographic interaction). Biologists and\nbotanists may be curious about why one animal or plant species\nflourish in one place and not another (geographic location\/\ndistribution). Epidemiologists and public health officials are\nundoubtedly interested in where disease outbreaks occur and how,\nwhy, and where they spread (geographic change\/interaction\/\nlocation).\nA geographic information system (GIS) can assist in answering\nall these questions and many more. Furthermore, GIS often opens\nup additional avenues of inquiry when searching for answers to\ngeographic questions. Herein is one of the greatest strengths of the\nGIS. While GIS can be used to answer specific questions or to solve\nparticular problems, it often unearths even more interesting\nquestions. It presents more problems to be solved in the future.\nGeographic Inquiry\nGeography is the study of the physical and cultural environments of\nthe earth. What makes geography different from other disciplines is\nthat it is focusing on spatial inquiry and analysis. Geographers also\ntry to look for connections between things such as patterns,\nmovement and migration, trends, and so forth. This process is\ncalled a geographic or spatial inquiry.\nIn order to do this, geographers go through a geographic\nmethodology that is quite similar to the scientific method, but 56 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nagain with a geographic or spatial emphasis. This method can be\nsimplified in a six-step geographic inquiry process.\n\u2022 Ask a geographic question. This means asking questions\nabout spatial relationships in the world around you.\n\u2022 Acquire geographic resources. Identify data and\ninformation that you need to answer your question.\n\u2022 Explore geographic data. Turn the data into maps, tables,\nand graphs, and look for patterns and relationships.\n\u2022 Analyze geographic information. Determine what the\npatterns and relationships mean concerning your question.\n\u201cKnowing where something is, how its location influences its\ncharacteristics, and how it influences relationships with other\nphenomena are the foundation of geographic thinking. This mode\nof the investigation asks you to see the world and all that is in it in\nspatial terms. Like other research methods, it also asks you to\nexplore, analyze, and act upon the things you find. It also is\nimportant to recognize that this is the same method used by\nprofessionals around the world working to address social,\neconomic, political, environmental, and a range of scientific issues\u201d\n(ESRI).\nGeographic Concepts\nBefore we can learn how to think geographically and apply spatial\nthinking, it is first necessary to review and reconsider a few key\ngeographic concepts that are often taken for granted. For instance,\nwhat is a location, and how can it be defined? At what distance does 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 57\na location become \u201cnearby\u201d? Or what do we mean when we say that\nsomeone has a \u201cgood sense of direction\u201d? By answering these and\nrelated questions, we establish a framework that will help us to\nlearn and to apply a GIS. This framework will also permit us to\nshare and communicate geographic information with others, which\ncan facilitate collaboration, problem-solving, and decision making.\nScale\nWhen representing the Earth on a manageable-sized map, the actual\nsize of the location is reduced. Scale is the ratio between the\ndistance between two locations on a map and the corresponding\ndistance on Earth\u2019s surface. A 1:1000 scale map, for example, would\nmean that 1 meter on the map equals 1000 meters, or 1 kilometer,\non Earth\u2019s surface. Scale can sometimes be a confusing concept, so\nit is important to remember that it refers to a ratio. It does not refer\nto the size of the map itself, but rather, how zoomed in or out the\nmap is. A 1:1 scale map of your room would be the same size of\nyour room \u2013 plenty of room for significant detail, but hard to fit\ninto a glove compartment.\nAs with map projections, the \u201cbest\u201d scale for a map depends on\nwhat it is used for. If you are going on a walking tour of a historic\ntown, a 1:5,000 scale map is commonly used. If you are a geography\nstudent looking at a map of the entire world, a 1:50,000,000 scale\nmap would be appropriate. \u201cLarge\u201d scale and \u201csmall\u201d scale refer to\nthe ratio, not to the size of the landmass on the map. 1 divided by\n5,000 is 0.0002, which is a larger number than 1 divided by\n50,000,000 (which is 0.00000002). Thus, a 1:5,000 scale map is 58 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nconsidered \u201clarge\u201d scale while 1:50,000,000 is considered \u201csmall\u201d\nscale.\nLocation\nThe one concept that distinguishes geography from other fields is\nlocation, which is central to a GIS. Location is simply a position on\nthe surface of the earth. What is more, nearly everything can be\nassigned a geographic location. Once we know the location of\nsomething, we can put it on a map, for example, with a GIS.\nGenerally, we tend to define and describe locations in nominal or\nabsolute terms. In the case of the former, locations are simply\ndefined and described by name. For example, city names such as\nNew York, Tokyo, or London refer to nominal locations.\nToponymy, or the study of place names and their respective history\nand meanings, is concerned with such nominal locations.\nThough we tend to associate the notion of location with particular\npoints on the surface of the earth, locations can also refer to\ngeographic features (e.g., Rocky Mountains) or large areas (e.g.,\nSiberia). The United States Board on Geographic Names maintains\ngeographic naming standards and keeps track of such names\nthrough the Geographic Names Information Systems. The GNIS\ndatabase also provides information about which state and county\nthe feature is located as well as its geographic coordinates.\nContrasting nominal locations are absolute locations that use\nsome type of reference system to define positions on the earth\u2019s\nsurface. For instance, defining a location on the surface of the earth 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 59\nusing latitude and longitude is an example of absolute location.\nPostal codes and street addresses are other examples of absolute\nlocation that usually follow some form of local logic. Though there\nis no global standard when it comes to street addresses, we can\ndetermine the geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude)\nof particular street addresses, zip codes, place names, and other\ngeographic data through a process called geocoding. There are\nseveral free online geocoders that return the latitude and longitude\nfor various locations and addresses around the world.\nWith the advent of the global positioning system (GPS),\ndetermining the location of nearly any object on the surface of the\nearth is a relatively simple and straightforward exercise. GPS\ntechnology consists of a constellation of twenty-four satellites that\nare orbiting the earth and continuously transmitting time signals.\nTo determine a position, earth-based GPS units (e.g., handheld\ndevices, car navigation systems, mobile phones) receive the signals\nfrom at least three of these satellites and use this information to\ntriangulate a location. All GPS units use the geographic coordinate\nsystem (GCS) to report location. Initially developed by the United\nStates Department of Defense for military purposes, there is now a\nwide range of commercial and scientific uses of a GPS.\nLocation can also be defined in relative terms. Relative location\nrefers to defining and describing places in relation to other known\nlocations. For instance, Cairo, Egypt, is north of Johannesburg,\nSouth Africa; New Zealand is southeast of Australia; and Kabul,\nAfghanistan, is northwest of Lahore, Pakistan. Unlike nominal or\nabsolute locations that define single points, relative locations 60 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nprovide a bit more information and situate one place in relation to\nanother.\nDirection\nLike location, the concept of direction is central to geography and\nGIS. Direction refers to the position of something relative to\nsomething else, usually along a line. In order to determine\ndirection, a reference point or benchmark from which direction\nwill be measured needs to be established. One of the most common\nbenchmarks used to determine direction is ourselves. Egocentric\ndirection refers to when we use ourselves as a directional\nbenchmark. Describing something as \u201cto my left,\u201d \u201cbehind me,\u201d or\n\u201cnext to me\u201d are examples of egocentric direction.\nAs the name suggests, landmark direction uses a known landmark\nor geographic feature as a benchmark to determine direction. Such\nlandmarks may be a busy intersection of a city, a prominent point\nof interest like the Colosseum in Rome, or some other feature like a\nmountain range or river. The critical thing to remember about\nlandmark direction, especially when providing directions, is that\nthe landmark should be relatively well-known.\nIn geography and GIS, three more standard benchmarks are used to\ndefine the directions of true north, magnetic north, and grid north.\nTrue north is based on the point at which the axis of the earth\u2019s\nrotation intersects the earth\u2019s surface. In this respect, the North and\nSouth Poles serve as the geographic benchmarks for determining\ndirection. Magnetic north (and south) refers to the point on the\nsurface of the earth where the earth\u2019s magnetic fields converge. This 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 61\nis also the point to which magnetic compasses point. Note that\nmagnetic north falls somewhere in northern Canada and is not\ngeographically coincident with true north or the North Pole. Grid\nnorth simply refers to the northward direction that the grid lines of\nlatitude and longitude on a map, called a graticule, point to.\nDistance\nComplementing the concepts of location and direction is distance.\nDistance refers to the degree or amount of separation between\nlocations and can be measured in nominal or absolute terms with\nvarious units. We can describe the distances between locations\nnominally as \u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall,\u201d or we can describe two or more\nlocations as \u201cnear\u201d or \u201cfar apart.\u201d\nCalculating the distance between two locations on the surface of\nthe earth can be quite involving because we are dealing with a three-\ndimensional object. Moving from the three-dimensional earth to\ntwo-dimensional maps on paper, computer screens, and mobile\ndevices is not a trivial matter and is discussed in greater detail in a\nlater chapter.\nWe also use a variety of units to measure distance. For instance, the\ndistance between London and Singapore can be measured in miles,\nkilometers, flight time on a jumbo jet, or days on a cargo ship.\nWhether or not such distances make London and Singapore \u201cnear\u201d\nor \u201cfar\u201d from each other is a matter of opinion, experience, and\npatience. Hence the use of absolute distance metrics, such as that\nderived from the distance formula, provide a standardized method\nto measure how far away or how near locations are from each other. 62 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nSpace\nWhere distance suggests a measurable quantity in terms of how far\napart locations are situated, space is a more abstract concept that is\nmore commonly described rather than measured. For example,\nspace can be described as \u201cempty,\u201d \u201cpublic,\u201d or \u201cprivate.\u201d\nWithin the scope of a digital mapping or GIS, we are interested in\nspace, and in particular, we are interested in what fills particular\nspaces and how and why things are distributed across space. In this\nsense, space is a somewhat ambiguous and generic term that is used\nto denote the general geographic area of interest.\nOne kind of space that is of particular relevance to a GIS is\ntopological space. Simply put, topological space is concerned with\nthe nature of relationships and the connectivity of locations within\na given space. What is essential within topological space are (1) how\nlocations are (or are not) related or connected, and (2) the rules that\ngovern such geographic relationships.\nTransportation maps such as those for subways provide some of the\nbest illustrations of topological spaces. When using maps, we are\nprimarily concerned with how to get from one stop to another\nalong a transportation network. Specific rules also govern how we\ncan travel along the network (e.g., transferring lines is possible only\nat a few key stops; we can travel only one direction on a particular\nline). Such maps may be of little use when traveling around a city\nby car or foot. However, they show the local transportation\nnetwork and how locations are linked together effectively and\nefficiently. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 63\nNavigation\nTransportation maps, like those discussed previously, illustrate how\nwe move through the environments where we live, work, and play.\nThis movement and, in particular, destination-oriented travel are\ngenerally referred to as navigation. How we navigate through space\nis a complex process that blends our various motor skills;\ntechnology, mental maps, and awareness of locations, distances,\ndirections, and the space where we live. What is more, our\ngeographical knowledge and spatial awareness are continuously\nupdated and changed as we move from one location to another.\nPhoto by Suzy Brooks on Unsplash.\nThe acquisition of geographic knowledge is a lifelong endeavor.\nThough several factors influence the nature of such knowledge, we 64 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\ntend to rely on the three following types of geographic knowledge\nwhen navigating through space:\n\u2022 Landmark knowledge refers to our ability to locate and\nidentify unique points, patterns, or features (e.g., landmarks)\nin space.\n\u2022 Route knowledge permits us to connect and travel between\nlandmarks by moving through space.\n\u2022 Survey knowledge enables us to understand where landmarks\nare concerning each other and to take shortcuts.\nEach type of geographic knowledge is acquired in stages, one after\nthe other. For instance, when we find ourselves in a new or\nunfamiliar location, we usually identify a few unique points of\ninterest (e.g., hotel, building, fountain) to orient ourselves. We are,\nin essence, building up our landmark knowledge. Using and\ntraveling between these landmarks develops our route knowledge\nand reinforces our landmark knowledge and our overall\ngeographical awareness. Survey knowledge develops once we begin\nto understand how routes connect landmarks and how various\nlocations are situated in space. It is at this point, when we are\nsomewhat comfortable with our survey knowledge, that we can take\nshortcuts from one location to another. Though there is no\nguarantee that a shortcut will be successful, if we get lost, we are at\nleast expanding our local geographic knowledge.\nLandmark, route, and survey knowledge are the cornerstones of\nhaving a sense of direction and frame our geographical learning and\nawareness. While some would argue that they are born with a good\nsense of direction, others admit to always getting lost. The 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 65\npopularity of personal navigation devices and online mapping\nservices speaks to the overwhelming desire to know and to situate\nwhere we are in the world. Though developing and maintaining a\nkeen sense of direction presumably matters less and less as such\ndevices and services continue to develop and spread, it can also be\nargued that the more we know about where we are in the world, the\nmore we will want to learn about it.\nThis section covers concepts essential to geography, GIS, and many\nother fields of interest. Understanding how location, direction, and\ndistance can be defined and described provides an essential\nfoundation for the successful use and implementation of a GIS.\nThinking about space and how we navigate through, it also serves\nto improve and own geographic knowledge and spatial awareness.\nUnderstanding Maps\nA map can be defined as a graphic representation of the real world.\nBecause of the infinite nature of our Universe, it is impossible to\ncapture all of the complexity found in the real world. For example,\ntopographic maps abstract the three-dimensional real world at a\nreduced scale on a two-dimensional plane of paper. Cartography is\nthe art and science of making maps, and a cartographer is\nprofessional who creates maps.\nMaps are among the most compelling forms of information for\nseveral reasons. Maps are artistic. Maps are scientific. Maps preserve\nhistory. Maps clarify. Maps reveal the invisible. Maps inform the\nfuture. Regardless of the reason, maps capture the imagination of\npeople around the world. As one of the most trusted forms of 66 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\ninformation, map makers, and geographic information system\n(GIS) practitioners hold a considerable amount of power and\ninfluence. Therefore, understanding and appreciating maps and\nhow maps convey information are essential aspects of GIS. The\nappreciation of maps begins with exploring various map types.\nSo what exactly is a map? Like GIS, there are probably just as many\ndefinitions of maps as there are people who use and make them. We\ncan define a map simply as a representation of the world. Such\nmaps can be stored in our brain (i.e., mental maps), they can be\nprinted on paper, or they can appear online. Notwithstanding the\nactual medium of the map (e.g., our fleeting thoughts, paper, or\ndigital display), maps represent and describe various aspects of the\nworld. For purposes of clarity, the three types of maps are the\nreference map, the thematic map, and the dynamic map.\nMost maps allow us to specify the location of points on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface using a coordinate system. For a two-dimensional map, this\ncoordinate system can use simple geometric relationships between\nthe perpendicular axes on a grid system to define spatial location.\nTwo types of coordinate systems are currently in general use in\ngeography: the geographical coordinate system and the rectangular\n(also called Cartesian) coordinate system. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 67\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=29\nGeographic Information Science\n(GIScience)\nReference Maps\nThe primary purpose of a reference map is to deliver location\ninformation to the map user. Geographic features and map\nelements on a reference map tend to be treated and represented\nequally. In other words, no single aspect of a reference map takes\nprecedence over any other aspect. Moreover, reference maps\ngenerally represent geographic reality accurately. Examples of some 68 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\ncommon types of reference maps include topographic maps such as\nthose created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and\nimage maps obtained from satellites or aircraft that are available\nthrough online mapping services.\n\u201cWinkel Triple\u201d by Daniel R. Strebe is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported.\nThe accuracy of a given reference map is indeed critical to many\nusers. For instance, local governments need accurate reference maps\nfor land use, zoning, and tax purposes. National governments need\naccurate reference maps for political, infrastructure, and military\npurposes. People who depend on navigation devices like global\npositioning systems (GPS) units also need accurate, and up-to-date\nreference maps to arrive at their desired destinations. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 69\nThematic Maps\n156\u00b0 155\u00b0\nA l e n u i h a h a C h a n n e l O Pp oo inlu t Hawi P o l o l u S l u m p\nMakapala\n20\u00b0 4 4\n3 3 3 3 2 2\n22 0\n7 5 2 0 7 5\n25 0\n5 0 5 0 5 0\n50 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nm m\nm m m m m m m\nM -a 1h K1 u 5\no\nk 0\nh\nao m\nKl\nK\nn\na\na o\nia\nlnC\nu\nao\na\naK K s Ba t ihw a Ko ya\nlK\naoi Wh\nHla\naa\naw\nooe iK\na l\na\na\nuB\nhii ahh\naa\nloya\nol\nHe\naoW 2uV 5a ai 2liW lk\nl\n3a ao a g ml\nliPo oep ko aKlu ao1 ilo 6 o7 ah 0a mla\nWai Km\naWa mhi aep ki\u2019 oo aaKu Mk Hu aoi 4h un 2a no 0e k 5al a eH mKalo' Kpaa a em\na\na k u a\nKa\nulC\nKa\nW\noo\nl\nK\naa\ne\ni\nk\na\nls\nupo\nt\nkulL a ueau Ppa ah po\na\nHe ikh ioo\nlu\noe\nHi Klo e K aB eua aky 'aa uha\nH i l o R i d g e\nP u n a R i d g e\n20\u00b0\n2 1 1 1 1 -0 7 5 2 0\n27 5\n20 5 0 5 0\n55 0\n50 0 0 0 0\n00 0 0\nm m m m m\nmm m m\n0\nK o n a\nC o a\nsK tea HBla oak nye ak uu na auCaptain Cook Ma4u1n70a mLoa HilinaK 1 Pi a2 ll i2a 2u me\nV\nHa\no olc lea\ni\nn Po\naliMoVuienwtain KaP imah uoa PohK ou ikC m ia up ke ahi\n- - -1 2\n3-\n0 0\n05\n0 0\n00\n0 0\n00\nm m\nmm\nMilolii Papa\nHionamoa\nPahala\n- -4 50 00 00\n0\nm\nm\nOHceaawna iViaienw\n-6000 m Kauna Na'alehu PACIFIC OCEAN\n19\u00b0 Point Lo\u2018ihi 19\u00b0\nWaiahukini Kaalualu - 980 m\nKa Lae P Sr ei cn oc nip da al r yR Roa od ad\nPACIFIC OCEAN K a h u k u F a u l t 0 0 ( (k mm i))M T A V Sur oii a r bln pi c mlo aor nr e tR o rgo ea dd Volcano 3050\n156\u00b0 155\u00b0\n\u201cHawaii Island Topographic Map\u201d licensed as Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.\nContrasting the reference map are thematic maps. As the name\nsuggests, thematic maps are concerned with a particular theme or\ntopic of interest. While reference maps emphasize the location of\ngeographic features, thematic maps are more concerned with how\nthings are distributed across space. Such things are often abstract\nconcepts such as life expectancy around the world, per capita gross\ndomestic product (GDP) in Europe, or literacy rates across India.\nOne of the strengths of mapping, and in particular of thematic\nmapping, is that it can make such abstract and invisible concepts\nvisible and comparable on a map. 70 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u201c2012\nUSDA\nPlant\nHardiness\nZone Map\n(USA)\u201d by\nUSDA-AR\nS and\nOregon\nState\nUniversity\n(OSU) is\nlicensed\nunder\nPublic\nDomain.\nIt is important to note that reference and thematic maps are not\nmutually exclusive. In other words, thematic maps often contain\nand combine geographical reference information, and conversely,\nreference maps may contain thematic information. What is more,\nwhen used in conjunction, thematic and reference maps often\ncomplement each other.\nFor example, public health officials in a city may be interested in\nproviding equal access to emergency rooms to the city\u2019s residents.\nInsights into this and related questions can be obtained through\nvisual comparisons of a reference map that shows the locations of\nemergency rooms across the city to thematic maps of various\nsegments of the population (e.g., households below poverty,\npercent elderly, underrepresented groups).\nThematic maps are generally are more abstract, involving more\nprocessing and interpretation of data, and often depict concepts 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 71\nthat are not directly visible; examples include maps of income,\nhealth, climate, or ecological diversity. There is no clear-cut line\nbetween reference and thematic maps, but the categories are useful\nto recognize because they relate directly to how the maps are\nintended to be used and to decisions that their cartographers have\nmade in the process of shrinking and abstracting aspects of the\nworld to generate the map. Different types of thematic maps\ninclude:\n\u2022 choropleth \u2013 a thematic map that uses tones or colors to\nrepresent spatial data as average values per unit area\n\u2022 proportional symbol \u2013 uses symbols of different sizes to\nrepresent data associated with different areas or locations\nwithin the map\n\u2022 isopleth\u2013 also known as contour maps or isopleth maps\ndepict smooth continuous phenomena such as precipitation\nor elevation\n\u2022 dot density \u2013 uses a dot symbol to show the presence of a\nfeature or phenomenon \u2013 dot maps rely on a visual scatter to\nshow a spatial pattern\n\u2022 dasymetric \u2013 an alternative to a choropleth map but instead\nof mapping the data so that the region appears uniform,\nancillary information is used to model the internal\ndistribution of the data 72 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u201cUnited States population density map based on Census 2010\ndata\u201d by Jim Irwin and licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported.\nWithin the context of a GIS, we can overlay the reference map of\nemergency rooms directly on top of the population maps to see\nwhether or not access is uniform across neighborhood types. There\nare other factors to consider when looking at emergency room\naccess (e.g., access to transport), but through such map overlays,\nunderserved neighborhoods can be identified. 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 73\n\u201cGIS Overlay Process\u201d is licensed\nunder a Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 License.\nWhen presented in hardcopy format, both reference and thematic\nmaps are static or fixed representations of reality. Such permanence\non the page suggests that geography and the things that we map are\nalso in many ways, fixed or constant. This is far from reality. The\nintegration of GIS with other forms of information technology like\nthe Internet and mobile telecommunications is rapidly changing\nthis view of maps and mapping, as well as geography at large.\nDynamic Maps\nThe diffusion of GIS and the popularity of online mapping tools 74 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nand applications speak to this shift in thinking about maps and\nmap use. In this regard, it is worthwhile to discuss the diffusion of\ndynamic maps. Dynamic maps are simply changeable or\ninteractive representations of the earth. Dynamic mapping refers\nmore to how maps are used and delivered to the map user today\n(e.g., online, via mobile phone) than to the content of the map\nitself. Both reference and thematic maps can be dynamic, and such\nmaps are an integral component of any GIS. The critical point\nabout dynamic maps is that more and more people, not just GIS\nprofessionals, have access to such maps.\n\u201cGoogle Maps\u201d by Deepanker Verma is licensed under no\ncopyright.\nUnlike a hardcopy map that has features and elements, users cannot\nmodify or change, dynamic maps encourage and sometimes require\nuser interaction. Such interaction can include changing the scale or\nvisible area by zooming in or zooming out, selecting which features 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 75\nor layers to include or to remove from a map (e.g., roads, imagery),\nor even starting and stopping a map animation.\nJust as dynamic maps will continue to evolve and require more user\ninteraction in the future, map users will demand more interactive\nmap features and controls. As this democratization of maps and\nmapping continues, the geographic awareness and map\nappreciation of map users will also increase. Therefore, it is of\ncritical importance to understand the nature, form, and content of\nmaps to support the changing needs, demands, and expectations of\nmap users in the future.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Every\ntime you and millions of other users perform these tasks, you are\nmaking use of Geographic Information Science (GIScience) and 78 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\nrelated spatial technologies. Many of these technologies, such as\nGlobal Positioning Systems (GPS) and in-vehicle navigation units,\nare very well-known, and you can probably recall the last time you\nhave used them.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=29\nGeographic Information Science\n(GIScience)\nOther applications and services that are the products of GIScience\nare a little less obvious, but they are every bit as common. If you are\nconnected to the Internet, you are making use of geospatial 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 79\ntechnologies right now. Every time your browser requests a web\npage from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), a geographic\nlookup occurs and the server you are connected to contacts other\nservers that are closest to it and retrieves the information. This\nhappens so that the delay between your request to view the data\nand the data being sent to you is as short as possible.\nGIScience and the related technologies are everywhere, and we use\nthem every day. When it comes to information, \u201cspatial is special.\u201d\nReliance on spatial attributes is what separates geographic\ninformation from other types of information. There are several\ndistinguishing properties of geographic information.\nUnderstanding them, and their implications for the practice of\ngeographic information science is a key utilizing geographic data.\n\u2022 Geographic data represent spatial locations and non-spatial\nattributes measured at certain times.\n\u2022 Geographic space is continuous.\n\u2022 Geographic space is nearly spherical.\n\u2022 Geographic data tend to be spatially dependent.\nSpatial attributes tell us where things are, or where things were at\nthe time the data were collected. By merely including spatial\nattributes, geographic data allow us to ask a plethora of geographic\nquestions. For example, we might ask, \u201care gas prices in Puyallup\nhigh?\u201d The interactive map from GasBuddy.com can help us with\nsuch a question while enabling us to generate many other spatial\ninquiries related to the geographic variation in fuel prices.\nAnother essential characteristic of geographic space is that it is 80 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\n\u201ccontinuous.\u201d Although the Earth has valleys, canyons, caves,\noceans, and more, there are no places on Earth without a location,\nand connections exist from one place to another. Outside of science\nfiction, there are no tears in the fabric of space-time. Modern\ntechnology can measure location very precisely, making it possible\nto generate incredibly detailed depictions of geographic feature\nlocation (e.g., of the coastline of the eastern U.S). It is often possible\nto measure so precisely that we collect more location data than we\ncan store and much more than is useful for practical applications.\nHow much information is useful to store or to display in a map will\ndepend on the map scale (how much of the world we represent\nwithin a fixed display such as the size of your computer screen) as\nwell as on the map\u2019s purpose. The map below is a digital elevation\nmodel (DEM), that is considered continuous because elevation\nalways exits on the planet.\n\u201cGlobal\nDEM using\nGEBCO 08\nElevation\nDataset\u201d\nby Kevin\nGill,\nlicensed\nunder\nAttribution\n2.0\nGeneric\n(CC BY\n2.0).\nIn addition to being continuous, geographic data also tend to be\nspatially dependent. More simply, \u201ceverything is related to 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY | 81\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant\nthings\u201d (which leads to an expectation that things that are near to\none another tend to be more alike than things that are far apart).\nHow alike things are in relation to their proximity to other things\ncan be measured by a statistical calculation known as spatial\nautocorrelation. Without this fundamental property, geographic\ninformation science as we know it today would not be possible.\nGeographic data comes in many types, from many different sources\nand captured using many techniques; they are collected, sold, and\ndistributed by a wide array of public and private entities. In general,\nwe can divide the collection of geographic data into two main types:\n\u2022 Directly collected data\n\u2022 Remotely sensed data\nDirectly collected data are generated at the source of the\nphenomena being measured. Examples of directly collected data\ninclude measurements such as temperature readings at specific\nweather stations, elevations recorded by visiting the location of\ninterest, or the position of a grizzly bear equipped with a GPS-\nenabled collar. Also, included here are data derived from surveys\n(e.g., the census) or observation (e.g., Audubon Christmas bird\ncount).\nRemotely sensed data are measured from remote distances\nwithout any direct contact with the phenomena or need to visit the\nlocations of interest. Satellite images, sonar readings, and radar are\nall forms of remotely sensed data.\nMaps are both the raw material and the product of geographic 82 | 1.3 GEOGRAPHIC LITERACY\ninformation systems (GIS). All maps represent features and\ncharacteristics of locations, and that representation depends upon\ndata relevant at a particular time. All maps are also selective; they do\nnot show us everything about the place depicted; they show only\nthe particular features and characteristics that their maker decided\nto include. Maps are often categorized into reference or thematic\nmaps based upon the producer\u2019s decision about what to include\nand the expectations about how the map will be used. The\nprototypical reference map depicts the location of \u201cthings\u201d that are\nusually visible in the world; examples include road maps and\ntopographic maps depicting terrain. 1.4 MAPPING\nTECHNOLOGY\nGeographic Grid Systems\nThe earth has 360 degrees, and they are measured using a grid\npattern called the graticule. Lines of latitude and longitude allow\nany absolute location on the planet to have an identifiable address\nof degrees north or south and east or west, which will enable\ngeographers to locate, measure, and study spatial activity accurately.\nGeographers and cartographers organize locations on the earth\nusing a series of imaginary lines that encircle the globe. The two\nprimary lines are the equator and the prime meridian. The systems\nof longitude and latitude are formed from these lines, allowing\nusers to locate themselves anywhere on the planet. The line is the\nlongest when one travels along in an east-west direction. At the\nequator, the sun is directly overhead at noon on the two equinoxes,\nwhich occur in March and September. 84 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nNorth Pole\n60\u00b0 90\u00b0 -150\u00b0 180\u00b0 150\u00b0\ne\nud -120\u00b0 120\u00b0\nLatit\n30\u00b0\n-90\u00b0\n90\u00b0\n0\u00b0 Equator\n-30\u00b0 -60\u00b0\n60\u00b0\n-60\u00b0\nSout- h90 P\u00b0\nole\n-30 P\u00b0\nrime\nM0\u00b0\neridian30\u00b0\nLongitude\n\u201cLatitude and Longitude of the Earth\u201d (author unknown) licensed\nunder the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain\nDedication.\nLatitude and Parallels\nThe equator is the largest circle of latitude on Earth. The equator\ndivides the earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and\nis called 0 degrees latitude. The other lines of latitude are numbered\nfrom 0 to 90 degrees, going toward each of the poles. The lines\nnorth of the equator toward the North Pole are north latitude, and\neach of the numbers is followed by the letter \u201cN.\u201d The lines south\nof the equator toward the South Pole are south latitude, and the\nletter \u201cS follows each of the numbers.\u201d The equator (0 latitude) is\nthe only line of latitude without any letter following the number.\nNotice that all lines of latitude are parallel to the equator (they are\noften called parallels) and that the North Pole equals 90 degrees N,\nand the South Pole equals 90 degrees S. Noted parallels include\nboth the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, which are\n23.5 degrees from the equator. At 66.5 degrees from the equator are 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 85\nthe Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle near the North and\nSouth Pole, respectively. The following are the essential parallel\nlines:\n\u2022 Equator, 0 degrees\n\u2022 Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north\n\u2022 Tropic of Capricorn, 23.5 degrees south\n\u2022 Arctic Circle, 66.5 degrees north\n\u2022 Antarctic Circle, 66.5 degrees south\n\u2022 North Pole, 90 degrees north (infinitely small circle)\n\u2022 South Pole, 90 degrees south (infinitely small circle)\nLongitude and Meridians\nThe prime meridian sits at 0 degrees longitude and divides the\nearth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The prime\nmeridian is defined as an imaginary line that runs through the\nRoyal Observatory in Greenwich, England, a suburb of London.\nThe Eastern Hemisphere includes the continents of Europe, Asia,\nand Australia, while the Western Hemisphere includes North and\nSouth America. All meridians (lines of longitude) east of the prime\nmeridian (0 and 180) are numbered from 1 to 180 degrees east (E);\nthe lines west of the prime meridian (0 and 180) are numbered\nfrom 1 to 180 degrees west (W). The 0 and 180 lines do not have a\nletter attached to them. The meridian at 180 degrees is called the\nInternational Date Line. The International Date Line (180\ndegrees longitude) is opposite the prime meridian and indicates the\nstart of each day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). Each day officially starts\nat 12:01 a.m., at the International Date Line. Do not confuse the 86 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nInternational Date Line with the prime meridian (0 longitude).\nThe actual International Date Line does not follow the 180-degree\nmeridian exactly. Several alterations have been made to the\nInternational Date Line to accommodate political agreements to\ninclude an island or country on one side of the line or another.\nLatitude is also sometimes described as zones of latitude.

The poles are an imaginary line\nrunning from the axis of Earth\u2019s rotation. The plane of the\nequator is an imaginary horizontal line that cuts the earth into two\nhalves. This brings up the topic of great and small circles. A great\ncircle is any circle that divides the earth into a circumference of two\nhalves. It is also the largest circle that can be drawn on a sphere. The\nline connecting any points along a great circle is also the shortest\ndistance between those two points. Examples of great circles\ninclude the Equator, all lines of longitude, the line that divides the\nearth into day and night called the circle of illumination, and the\necliptic plane, which divides the earth into equal halves along the\nequator. Small circles are circles that cut the earth, but not into 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 89\nequal halves. Examples of small circles include all latitude lines\nexcept the equator, the Tropical of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn,\nthe Arctic Circle, and Antarctic Circle.\nClimate and Latitude\n\u201cSatellite Map of the World:\nPhysical: Geographic Projection\u201d\nby Newport Geography licensed\nunder Creative Commons\nAttribution 2.0 Generic.\nThe earth is tilted on its axis 23.5 degrees. As it rotates around the\nsun, the tilt of the earth\u2019s axis provides different climatic seasons\nbecause of the variations in the angle of direct sunlight on the\nplanet. Places receiving more direct sunlight experience a warmer\nclimate. Elsewhere, the increased angle of incoming solar radiation 90 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nnear the earth\u2019s poles results in more reflected sunlight and a colder\nclimate. The Northern Hemisphere experiences winter when\nsunlight is reflected off the earth\u2019s surface, and less of the sun\u2019s\nenergy is absorbed from the sun\u2019s sharper angle.\nTime Zones\nUniversal Time (UT), Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu Time (Z): all four terms\ncan be defined as the local time at 0 degrees longitude, which is the\nprime meridian (location of Greenwich, England). This is the same\ntime under which many military operations, international radio\nbroadcasts, and air traffic control systems operate worldwide. UTC\nis set in zero- to twenty-four-hour time periods, as opposed to two\ntwelve-hour periods (a.m. and p.m.). The designations of a.m. and\np.m. are relative to the central meridian: a.m. refers to ante\nmeridiem, or \u201cbefore noon,\u201d and p.m. refers to post meridiem, or\n\u201cafter-noon.\u201d UT, UTC, GMT, and Z all refer to the same twenty-\nfour-hour time system that assists in unifying a standard time\nregarding global operations. For example, all air flights use the\ntwenty-four-hour time system so the pilots can coordinate flights\nacross time zones and around the world.\nThe earth rotates on its axis once every twenty-four hours at the\nrate of 15 degrees per hour (15 \u00d7 24 = 360). Time zones are\nestablished roughly every 15 degrees longitude so that local times\ncorrespond to similar hours of day and night. With this system, the\nsun is generally overhead at noon in every time zone that follows the\n15-degree-wide system. The twenty-four times zones are based on\nthe prime meridian regarding Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 91\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT), or Zulu Time (Z), which all\noperate on the twenty-four-hour time clock. Local time zones are\neither plus or minus determined by the distance from the prime\nmeridian.\n\u201cStandard Time Zones of the World\u201d by Poulpy is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported.\nThe 15-degree time zone problem is that the zones do not\nnecessarily follow state, regional, or local boundaries. The result is\nthat time zones are seldom precisely 15 degrees wide and usually\nhave various boundary lines. In the United States, the boundaries\nbetween the different time zones are inconsistent with the lines of\nlongitude; in some cases, time zones zigzag to follow state lines or to\nkeep cities within a single time zone. Other countries address the\nproblem differently. China, for example, is a significant inland area\nas the United States yet operates on only one time zone for the\nentire country. 92 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

For instance, in geometry, we use x (horizontal) and y\n(vertical) coordinates to define points on a two-dimensional plane.\nThe coordinate system that is most commonly used to define\nlocations on the three-dimensional earth is called the geographic\ncoordinate system (GCS), and it is based on a sphere or spheroid.\nA spheroid (a.k.a. ellipsoid) is simply a sphere that is slightly wider\nthan it is tall and approximates more closely the actual shape of the 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 93\nearth. Spheres are commonly used as models of the earth for\nsimplicity.\nThe unit of measure in the GCS is degrees, and their respective\nlatitude and longitude define locations within the GCS. Latitude is\nmeasured relative to the equator at zero degrees, with maxima of\neither ninety degrees north at the North Pole or ninety degrees\nsouth at the South Pole. Longitude is measured relative to the\nprime meridian at zero degrees, with maxima of 180 degrees west or\n180 degrees east.\nNote that latitude and longitude can be expressed in degrees-\nminutes-seconds (DMS) or decimal degrees (DD). When using\ndecimal degrees, latitudes above the equator and longitudes east of\nthe prime meridian are positive, and latitudes below the equator\nand longitudes west of the prime meridian are negative (see the\nfollowing table for examples).\nConverting from DMS to DD is a relatively straightforward\nexercise. For example, since there are sixty minutes in one degree, we\ncan convert 118\u00b0 15 minutes to 118.25 (118 + 15\/60). Note that an\nonline search of the term \u201ccoordinate conversion\u201d will return\nseveral coordinate conversion tools.\nWhen we want to map things like mountains, rivers, streets, and\nbuildings, we need to define how the lines of latitude and longitude\nwill be oriented and positioned on the sphere. A datum serves this\npurpose and specifies precisely the orientation and origins of the\nlines of latitude and longitude relative to the center of the earth or\nspheroid. 94 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nDepending on the need, situation, and location, there are several\ndatums to choose from. For instance, local datums try to match the\nspheroid closely to the earth\u2019s surface in a local area and return\naccurate local coordinates. A typical local datum used in the United\nStates is called NAD83 (i.e., North American Datum of 1983). For\nlocations in the United States and Canada, NAD83 returns\nrelatively accurate positions, but positional accuracy deteriorates\nwhen outside of North America.\nThe global WGS84 datum (i.e., World Geodetic System of 1984)\nuses the center of the earth as the origin of the GCS and is used for\ndefining locations across the globe. Because the datum uses the\ncenter of the earth as its origin, locational measurements tend to be\nmore consistent regardless of where they are obtained on the earth.\nHowever, they may be less accurate than those returned by a local\ndatum. Note that switching between datums will alter the\ncoordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) for all locations of interest. 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 95\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

A globe is an excellent representation of the three-\ndimensional, spheroid earth. One of the problems with globes,\nhowever, is that they are not very portable (i.e., you cannot fold a\nglobe and put in it in your pocket), and their small scale makes\nthem of limited practical use (i.e., geographic detail is sacrificed). To\novercome these issues, it is necessary to transform the three-\ndimensional shape of the earth to a two-dimensional surface like a\nflat piece of paper, computer screen, or mobile device display in 96 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\norder to obtain more useful map forms and map scales. Enter the\nmap projection.\nMap projections refer to the methods and procedures that are used\nto transform the spherical three-dimensional earth into two-\ndimensional planar surfaces. Specifically, map projections are\nmathematical formulas that are used to translate latitude and\nlongitude on the surface of the earth to x and y coordinates on a\nplane. Since there is an infinite number of ways this translation can\nbe performed, there is an infinite number of map projections. The\nmathematics behind map projections are beyond the scope of this\nintroductory overview for simplicity, the following discussion\nfocuses on describing types of map projections, the distortions\ninherent to map projections, and the selection of appropriate map\nprojections.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 97\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=41\nTo illustrate the concept of a map projection, imagine that we place\na light bulb in the center of a translucent globe. On the globe are\noutlines of the continents and the lines of longitude and latitude\ncalled the graticule. When we turn the light bulb on, the outline of\nthe continents and the graticule will be \u201cprojected\u201d as shadows on\nthe wall, ceiling, or any other nearby surface. This is what is meant\nby map \u201cprojection.\u201d\nWithin the realm of maps and mapping, there are three surfaces\nused for map projections (i.e., surfaces on which we project the\nshadows of the graticule). These surfaces are the plane, the cylinder,\nand the cone. Referring again to the previous example of a light\nbulb in the center of a globe, note that during the projection\nprocess, we can situate each surface in any number of ways. For\nexample, surfaces can be tangential to the globe along the equator\nor poles, they can pass through or intersect the surface, and they can\nbe oriented at any number of angles.\nNaming conventions for many map projections include the surface\nas well as its orientation. For example, as the name suggests,\n\u201cplanar\u201d projections use the plane, \u201ccylindrical\u201d projections use\ncylinders, and \u201cconic\u201d projections use the cone. For cylindrical\nprojections, the \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cstandard\u201d aspect refers to when the\ncylinder is tangential to the equator (i.e., the axis of the cylinder is\noriented north-south). When the axis of the cylinder is perfectly 98 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\noriented east-west, the aspect is called \u201ctransverse,\u201d and all other\norientations are referred to as \u201coblique.\u201d Regardless of the\norientation or the surface on which a projection is based, a number\nof distortions will be introduced that will influence the choice of\nmap projection.\nWhen moving from the three-dimensional surface of the earth to a\ntwo-dimensional plane, distortions are not only introduced but also\ninevitable. Generally, map projections introduce distortions in\ndistance, angles, and areas. Depending on the purpose of the map, a\nseries of trade-offs will need to be made concerning such\ndistortions.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=41 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 99\nMap projections that accurately represent distances are referred to\nas equidistant projections. Note that distances are only correct in\none direction, usually running north-south, and are not correct\neverywhere across the map. Equidistant maps are frequently used\nfor small-scale maps that cover large areas because they do an\nexcellent job of preserving the shape of geographic features such as\ncontinents.\nMaps that represent angles between locations also referred to as\nbearings, are called conformal. Conformal map projections are used\nfor navigational purposes due to the importance of maintaining a\nbearing or heading when traveling great distances. The cost of\npreserving bearings is that areas tend to be quite distorted in\nconformal map projections. Though shapes are more or less\npreserved over small areas, at small scales areas become wildly\ndistorted. The Mercator projection is an example of a conformal\nprojection and is famous for distorting Greenland.\nAs the name indicates, equal area or equivalent projections preserve\nthe quality of the area. Such projections are of particular use when\naccurate measures or comparisons of geographical distributions are\nnecessary (e.g., deforestation, wetlands). To maintain true\nproportions in the surface of the earth, features sometimes become\ncompressed or stretched depending on the orientation of the\nprojection. Moreover, such projections distort distances as well as\nangular relationships.\nAs noted earlier, there is theoretically an infinite number of map\nprojections to choose from. One of the key considerations behind\nthe choice of map projection is to reduce the amount of distortion.\nThe geographical object being mapped and the respective scale at 100 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nwhich the map will be constructed are also essential factors to think\nabout. For instance, maps of the North and South Poles usually use\nplanar or azimuthal projections, and conical projections are best\nsuited for the middle latitude areas of the earth. Features that\nstretch east-west, such as the country of Russia, are represented well\nwith the standard cylindrical projection, while countries oriented\nnorth-south (e.g., Chile, Norway) are better represented using a\ntransverse projection.\nIf a map projection is unknown, sometimes it can be identified by\nworking backward and carefully examining the nature and\norientation of the graticule (i.e., grid of latitude and longitude), as\nwell as the varying degrees of distortion. There are trade-offs made\nconcerning distortion on every map. There are no hard-and-fast\nrules as to which distortions are more preferred over others.\nTherefore, the selection of map projection largely depends on the\npurpose of the map.\nWithin the scope of GIS, knowing, and understanding map\nprojections are critical. For instance, in order to perform an overlay\nanalysis as the one described earlier, all map layers need to be in the\nsame projection. If they are not, geographical features will not be\nappropriately aligned, and any analyses performed will be\ninaccurate and incorrect. Most GIS includes functions to assist in\nthe identification of map projections, as well as to transform\nbetween projections in order to synchronize spatial data. Despite\nthe capabilities of technology, an awareness of the potential and\npitfalls that surround map projections is essential. 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY | 101\nGeospatial Technology\nTraditionally, the field of cartography, or mapmaking, has been a\nvital discipline for geographers. While cartography is an essential\npart of geography, geographers also look at spatial (space) and\ntemporal (time) relationships between various types of data,\nincluding physical landscape types, economies, and human activity.\nGeography also examines the relationships between and the\nprocesses of humans and their physical and cultural environments.\nBecause maps are powerful visual graphics tools that illustrate\nrelationships and processes at work in the world, cartography and\ngeographic information systems have become prominent in modern\nscience. Maps are the most common method of illustrating\ndifferent spatial qualities, and geographers create and use maps to\ncommunicate spatial data about the earth\u2019s surface. 102 | 1.4 MAPPING TECHNOLOGY\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

GIS can\nintegrate several maps into one to help analysts understand a place\nconcerning their own specific needs.\nGIS also focuses on storing information about the earth (both\ncultural and natural) in computer databases that can be retrieved\nand displayed in the form of specialized maps for specific purposes\nor analyses.

For example, because of the\ntheory of plate tectonics, we understand why nearly 90 percent of\nall earthquakes and volcanoes occur along the Pacific Ocean\u2019s outer\nedges, called the Ring of Fire. The theory of plate tectonics has\nalso helped to explain why some volcanoes are more explosive and\nactive than others. We also understand that different tectonic plate\nboundaries produce different fault lines and, thus, different types of\nearthquakes. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 109\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=54\nMany natural hazards have seasons, especially those controlled by\nexternal forces. The United States has more tornadoes than the rest\nof the world combined, yet it most only occurs in the spring and\nearly fall. Landslides are more prone in the spring when snow\nbegins to melt, and the saturated ground causes unstable slopes to\nslide. Wildfires are frequent in the middle of the summer and early\nfall when the land is dry, and afternoon thunderstorms in arid\nclimates produce lightning without any precipitation. Furthermore,\nhurricane season in the Northern Hemisphere peaks between\nAugust and September when the Atlantic Ocean is warmest.\nSince hazards are statistically predictable in some manner, it\nbecomes essential to develop a warning system. Predictions, such 110 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nas weather predictions, state that it will occur at a specified time,\ndate, and intensity. It is like saying, \u201ca major snowstorm will reach\nSalt Lake City at 4:30 PM for the commute home.\u201d A forecast\nstates a probability of something occurring, such as \u201c40 percent of\nshowers today.\u201d Forecasts are much broader than predictions.\nWhen a natural disaster event is about to happen or has occurred, a\nsystem has been set up to alert the public. A watch is issued when\nthe conditions for an event are right. If a severe thunderstorm is\nstrong enough and rotating, a tornado may form. Alternatively, if\nan earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 strikes somewhere in the\nocean, a tsunami watch may be issued because it was strong enough\nto generate one. However, a watch does not necessarily mean that it\nwill occur. A warning is sent out to the areas that could be\nimpacted if a tornado is spotted on the ground or an ocean sensor\nrecords an approaching tsunami. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 111\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The\nrisk of a potential hazard is defined as the probability of a disaster\nmultiplied by the consequence to the human environment.\n\u2022 Risk = Probability of Disaster x Consequence of Disaster\nIt is essential to determine the potential risk a location has for any\nparticular disaster to know how to prepare for one. Referring to\nSalt Lake City again, the probability of an earthquake occurring\nanytime soon is small, but the consequences to human lives and\ndestruction are very high. There is a moderately high risk of an\nearthquake striking Salt Lake City. One of the limiting factors of\nrisk is knowing the probability of a disaster. Too often, scientific\ndata is lacking enough information to determine how often a\ndisaster occurs for a particular location. This is particularly true\nwith geologic hazards, where geologic time is vastly more extensive\nthan the age of scientific reasoning. 112 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nHazards, Disasters, and\nCatastrophes\nWhat is the difference between a natural hazard, a disaster, or a\ncatastrophe? A hazard is any natural process, or even that poses a\ndirect threat to the human environment. The event itself is not a\nhazard; instead, a process or event becomes a hazard when it\nthreatens human interests. A disaster is the effect of a hazard on\nsociety, usually as an event that occurs over a limited time in a\ndefined geographic area. The term disaster is used when the\ninteraction between humans and a natural process results in\nsignificant property damage, injuries, or loss of life. Finally, a\ncatastrophe is a massive disaster that significantly impacted the\nhuman environment and requiring a significant expenditure of\ntime, money, and resources for response and recovery.\nCurrently, the earthquake that is expected to strike Salt Lake City is\njust a hazard, a natural process that poses a potential threat to the\nhuman environment, because it has not occurred yet. If that\nearthquake turns out to be a moderate 5.0 magnitude earthquake,\nit will likely be considered a disaster. However, if the expected 7.0 to\n7.5 magnitude earthquake were to occur, it would be considered a\ncatastrophe because thousands of people will likely perish, tens of\nthousands will be injured, and the economic cost will be in the\nbillions of dollars. An article by NASA titled The Rising Costs of\nNatural Hazards talks about how the financial and human cost of\nnatural disasters is rising. To help prepare for these disasters, better\nmitigation efforts will be required, such as proper building and\nzoning codes, first responder preparedness, and public education. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 113\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=54\nIn the summer of 2008, China was rocked by a magnitude 8.0\nearthquake that killed over 80,000 people. A week earlier, a cyclone\nstruck Burma killing 130,000. On January 12, 2010, a magnitude\n7.0 earthquake killed nearly 300,000 people and leveled the capital\ncity of Port-a-Prince in Haiti. On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0\nearthquake generated a tsunami off the coast of eastern Japan,\nkilling 30,000 people. Are natural disasters getting worse? Not\nreally. Humans are over-populating the earth and living in more\nhazard-prone areas. Over the last 70 years, the world\u2019s population\nhas tripled to 6.7 billion. World population projections suggest that\nthe human population will reach 9 billion by 2050. by\nexponentially grow, and by 2050 the world\u2019s population will reach 114 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\n9 billion. Exponential growth means the world\u2019s population will\nnot grow linearly (in a straight line), but rather as a percent. Our\nincreased population size has caused air quality to suffer, reduced\nthe availability of clean drinking water, increased the world\u2019s\nextreme poverty rate, and has made us more prone to natural\nhazards.\nThere is also a relationship between the magnitude of an event\n(energy released) and its frequency (intervals between episodes).\nThe more earthquakes that occur for a particular location, the\nweaker they tend to be. That is because built-up energy is slowly\nbeing released at a relatively constant rate. However, if there are\nlong intervals between one earthquake and the next, the energy can\nbuild and can ultimately produce a stronger earthquake. That is the\nproblem with earthquakes along the Wasatch Front of Utah. The\ninterval or frequency between earthquakes tends to be 1,500 years,\nso the magnitude tends to be high because of the built-up energy.\nAt some point, we are going to want to get this earthquake over\nwith because the longer it waits, the worse it will be.\nPrimary and Secondary Effects\nThere are two types of effects caused by natural disasters: direct and\nindirect. Direct effects, also called primary effects, include\ndestroyed infrastructure and buildings, injuries, separated families,\nand even death. Indirect, sometimes called secondary effects, are\nthings like contaminated water, disease, and financial losses. In\nother words, indirect effects are things that happen after the disaster\nhas occurred. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 115\nHow we chose to build our cities will significantly determine how\nmany lives are saved in a disaster. For example, we should not be\nbuilding homes in areas that are prone to landslides, liquefaction,\nor flash floods. Instead, these places should be left as open-space\nsuch as parks, golf courses, or nature preserves. This is a matter of\nproper zoning laws which are controlled by the local government.\nAnother way we can reduce the impact of natural disasters is by\nhaving evacuation routes, disaster preparedness and education, and\nbuilding codes so that our building does not collapse on people.\nInternal and External Forces\nTwo forces generate natural hazards: internal forces and external\nforces. The first is internal forces generated by the internal heat of\nthe earth and creates geologic hazards like earthquakes, volcanoes,\nand tsunamis. The theory of plate tectonics proposes that internal\nheating from the earth\u2019s core causes large tectonic plates that make\nup the planet\u2019s continents and oceans and move around like\nbumper cars, where they either slam into each other or pull apart.\nExternal forces influence weather, climate, and landslides. Heating\nfrom the Sun causes differential heating on the surface, ultimately\ncreating our weather and all the hazards associated with it. These\nexternal forces create flash floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, supercells,\nand climatic disasters such as droughts and famines. 116 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nHuman Population\nSometimes people will ask if natural disasters are getting worse.\nThis apocalyptic concern has only increased over time because of\nclimate change or COVID-19. From a geologic perspective, and\nwhat the data suggests, is that natural events are not continuing to\nget worse. That does not mean that issues such as climate change\nshould be discounted, far from it. But one variable that is consistent\nis that human population growth is causing humans to be more in\nthe way of natural events.\nDemography is the study of how human populations change over\ntime and space. It is a branch of human geography related to\npopulation geography, which is the examination of the spatial\ndistribution of human populations. Geographers study how\npopulations grow and migrate, how people are distributed around\nthe world, and how these distributions change over time. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 117\n\u201cList of Countries Ordered by their Population Size\u201d by\nPopulationPyramid.net is under licensed under Creative Commons\n3.0 IGO.\nFor most of human history, relatively few people lived on Earth, and\nthe world population grew slowly. Only about five hundred million\npeople lived on the entire planet in 1650 (that is less than half\nIndia\u2019s population in 2000). Things changed dramatically during\nEurope\u2019s Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and into the\n1800s, when declining death rates due to improved nutrition and\nsanitation allowed more people to survive to adulthood and\nreproduce. The population of Europe grew rapidly. However, by\nthe middle of the twentieth century, birth rates in developed\ncountries declined, as children had become a financial liability\nrather than an economic asset to families. Fewer families worked in\nagriculture, more families lived in urban areas, and women delayed\nthe age of marriage to pursue education, resulting in a decline in\nfamily size and a slowing of population growth. In some countries\n(e.g., Russia and Japan), the population is actually in decline, and 118 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nthe average age in developed countries has been rising for decades.\nThe process just described is called the demographic transition.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=54\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the world\u2019s population\nwas about 1.6 billion. One hundred years later, there were roughly\nsix billion people worldwide, and as of 2011, the number was\napproaching seven billion. This rapid growth occurred as the\ndemographic transition spread from developed countries to the rest\nof the world. During the twentieth century, death rates due to\ndisease and malnutrition decreased in nearly every corner of the\nglobe. In developing countries with agricultural societies, however,\nbirth rates remained high. Low death rates and high birth rates\nresulted in rapid population growth. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 119\nMeanwhile, birth rates and family sizes have also been declining in\nmost developing countries as people leave agricultural professions\nand move to urban areas. This means that population growth rates,\nwhile still higher in the developing world than in the developed\nworld, are declining. Although the exact figures are unknown,\ndemographers expect the world\u2019s population to stabilize by 2100\nand decline somewhat.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=54\nThe world\u2019s population growth rate has been mostly occurring in\ndeveloping countries, whereas populations are stable or in decline\nin places such as Europe and North America. World population\nincrease is pronounced on the continent of Asia: China and India\nare the most populous countries in the world, each with more than 120 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\na billion people, and Pakistan is an emerging population giant with\na high rate of population growth. The continent of Africa has the\nhighest fertility rates in the world. The most striking paradox\nwithin population studies is that while there has been a decline in\nfertility (a declining family size) in developing countries, the world\u2019s\npopulation will grow substantially by 2030 because of the\ncompounding effect of a large number of people already in the\nworld. Even though population growth rates are in decline in many\ncountries, the population is still growing. A small growth rate on a\nbroad base population still results in the birth of many millions of\npeople.\nAs of May 2020, the United States Census Bureau estimates that\nthe world population is nearly 7.65 billion, with a growth rate of\nroughly 1.07 percent, or roughly 82 million people per year. The\nworld population reached 6 billion in 1999 and 7 billion in 2011. If\nthe current growth rate continues, the human population will\nreach 8 billion by 2023 and hopefully level off at roughly 10 billion\nby 2055. Between 2010 and 2050, world population growth will be\ngenerated exclusively in developing countries. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 121\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=54\nThe three most significant population clusters in the world are the\nregions of eastern China, South Asia, and Europe. Southeast Asia\nalso has large population clusters. Additional large population\ncenters exist in various countries with high urbanization. An\nexample is the urbanized region between Boston and Washington,\nDC, which includes New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\nneighboring metropolitan areas, which is often called a megalopolis.\nThe coastal country of Nigeria in West Africa or the island of Java\nin Indonesia are good examples of large population clusters\ncentered in the tropics.\nSocial dynamics and geography will determine where the new\nadditions to the human family will live. Providing food, energy, and 122 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nmaterials for these additional humans will tax many countries of the\nworld, and poverty, malnutrition, and disease are expected to\nincrease in regions with poor sanitation, limited clean water, and\nlack of economic resources. In 2010, more than two billion people\n(one-third of the planet\u2019s population) lived in abject poverty and\nearned less than the equivalent of two US dollars per day. The\ncarrying capacity of the planet is not and cannot be known. How\nmany humans can the earth sustain indefinitely? There is the\npossibility that we have already reached the threshold of its\ncarrying capacity.\nThe human population will continue to grow until it either crashes\ndue to the depletion of resources or stabilizes at a sustainable\ncarrying capacity. Population growth exacts a toll on the earth as\nmore people use more environmental resources. The areas most\nimmediately affected by increased populations include forests (a\nfuel resource and a source of building material), freshwater\nsupplies, and agricultural soils. These systems get overtaxed, and\ntheir depletion has serious consequences. Type C climates, which\nare moderate and temperate, are usually the most productive and\nare already vulnerable to severe deforestation, water pollution, and\nsoil erosion. Maintaining adequate food supplies will be critical to\nsupporting a sustainable carrying capacity. The ability to transport\nfood supplies quickly and safely is a significant component of\nmanaging the conservation of resources. Deforestation by humans\nusing wood for cooking fuel is already a serious concern in the arid\nand dry type B climates. 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 123\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

For example, in 1929, the American\ndemographer Warren Thompson developed the Demographic\nTransition Model (DTM) to explain population growth based on\nan interpretation of demographic history. A revised version of\nThomson\u2019s model outlines five stages of demographic transition,\nfrom traditional rural societies to modern urban societies. 124 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\n\u201cThe Demographic Transition in 5 Stages\u201d by Max Roser is licensed\nunder Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International.\nStage 1: Low Growth Rate\nHumans have lived in the first stage of the DTM for most of our\nexistence. In this first stage, CBRs and CDRs fluctuated greatly\nregionally, globally, and overtime because of living conditions, food\noutput, environmental conditions, war, and disease. Ultimately, the\nnatural increase of the world was stable because CBRs and CDRs\nwere about equal. However, around 8,000 BC, the world\u2019s\npopulation began to grow dramatically due to the agricultural\nrevolution. During this time, humans learn to domesticate plants\nand animals for personal use and became less reliant on hunting\nand gathering for sustenance. This allowed for more stable food\nproduction and allowed village populations to grow. War and 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 125\ndisease prevented population growth from occurring on a global\nscale.\nStage 2: High Growth Rate\nAround the mid-1700s, global populations began to grow ten times\nfaster than in the past because of the Industrial Revolution. The\nIndustrial Revolution brought with it a variety of technological\nimprovements in agricultural production and food supply.\nIncreased wealth in Europe and later North America, because the\nIndustrial Revolution meant that more money and resources could\nbe devoted to medicine, medical technology, water sanitation, and\npersonal hygiene. Sewer systems were installed in cities; thus, public\nhealth improved. All of this dramatically caused CDRs to drop\naround the world. At first, CBRs stayed high as CDRs dropped,\ncausing populations to increase in Europe and North America.\nOver time, this would change.\nAfrica, Asia, and Latin America moved into Stage 2 of the\ndemographic transition model 200 years later for different reasons\nthan their European and North American counterparts. The\nmedicine created in Europe and North America was brought into\nthese developing nations creating what is now called the medical\nrevolution. This revolution or diffusion of medicine to this region\ncaused death rates to drop quickly. While the medical revolution\nreduced death rates, it did not bring with it the wealth and\nimproved living conditions, and development that the Industrial\nRevolution created. Global population growth is most significant\nin the regions that are still in Stage 2. 126 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nStage 3: Moderate Growth Rate\nToday, Europe and North America have moved to Stage 3 of the\ndemographic transition model. A nation moves from Stage 2 to\nStage 3 when CBRs begin to drop while CDRs remain low or even\ncontinue to fall. It should be noted that the natural rate of increase\nin nations within Stage 3 is moderate because CBRs are somewhat\nhigher than CDRs. The United States, Canada, and nations in\nEurope entered this stage in the early 20th century. Latin American\nnations entered this stage later in the century.\nAdvances in technology and medicine cause a decrease in IMR and\noverall CDR during Stage 2. Social and economic changes bring\nabout a decrease in CBR during Stage 3. Countries that begin to\nacquire wealth tend to have fewer children as they move away from\nrural-based development structures toward urban-based structures\nbecause more children survive childhood, and the need for large\nfamilies for agricultural work decreases. Additionally, women\ngained more legal rights and chose to enter the workforce, own\nproperty, and have fewer children as nations move into Stage 3.\nStage 4: Return to Low Growth Rate\nA country enters Stage 4 of the demographic transition model\nwhen CBRs equal to or become less than CDRs. When CBRs are\nequal to CDRs, a nation will experience zero population growth\n(ZPG). This occurs in many countries where girls do not live as\nlong as they reach their childbearing age due to gender inequality.\nA country in the first two stages of the transition model will have a 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS | 127\nbroad base of young people and a smaller proportion of older\npeople. A country in Stage 4 will have a much smaller base of young\npeople (fewer children), but a much larger population of elderly\n(decreased CDR). A country with a large youth population is more\nlikely to be rural with high birthrates and possibly high death rates,\nhelping geographers analyze a nation\u2019s health care system.\nMoreover, a country in Stage 4 with a large elderly population will\nhave much fewer young people supporting the economy. These two\nexamples represent the dependency ratio, mentioned earlier in this\nchapter. This ratio is the number of people, young and old,\ndependent on the working force.\nHuman geographers like to focus on the following demographic\ngroups: 0-14 years old, 15-64 years old, and 65 and older.\nIndividuals who are 0-14 and over 65 are considered dependents\n(though this is changing in older generations). One-third of all\nyoung people live in developing nations. Moreover, this places\nconsiderable strain on those nations\u2019 infrastructure, such as schools,\nhospitals, and day-care. Older individuals in more developed\nnations (MDL) benefit from health care services, but require more\nhelp and resources from the government and economy.\nAnother ratio geographers look at is the number of males compared\nto females, called the sex ratio. Globally, more males are born than\nfemales, but males have a higher death rate than females. However,\nunderstanding a country\u2019s sex ratio and its dependency ratio helps\nhuman geographers analyze fertility rates and natural increase.\nAs noted earlier, population growth has increased dramatically in\nthe last century. No country is still in Stage 1, and very few have\nmoved into Stage 4. The majority of the world is either in Stage 2 or 128 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\n3, which both have higher CBRs than CDRs, creating a human\npopulation of over 7.5 billion today.\nStage 5: Population Decline\nMany demographers believe a new stage in the DTM should be\nadded to address issues starting to develop in countries within\nEurope and Japan. In this final stage, CBR would be extremely low\nand an increasing CDR. This would cause the area\u2019s NIR to\nbecome negative, leading to declining population growth. This may\ncreate an enormous strain on the social safety net programs of a\ncountry as is tries to support older citizens who are no longer\nworking and contributing to the economy.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Human\nbehavior transforms natural hazards into unnatural disasters.\u201d Most\ndeaths from natural disasters occur in less developed countries.\nAccording to the United Nations, a less developed country\n(LDC) is a country that exhibits the lowest indicators of\nsocioeconomic development and ranked among the lowest on the\nHuman Development Index. Those who live in low-income\nenvironments tend to have the following characteristics:\n\u2022 Live in areas that are at a higher risk to geologic, weather, and\nclimate-related disasters\n\u2022 Live in areas that lack the economics and resources to provide\na safe living infrastructure for its people\n\u2022 Tend to have few social and economic assets and a weak social\nsafety net\n\u2022 Lack the technological infrastructure to provide early warning\nsystems\nAs human populations have grown and expanded, and technology\nhas allowed us to manipulate the environment, natural disasters\nhave become more complex and arguable more \u201cunnatural.\u201d There\nare a variety of ways humans have not only influenced but\nmagnified the impacts of disasters on society. For simplification,\nthis book will narrow it down to four: human population growth,\npoverty and inequality, environmental degradation, and climate\nchange. 130 | 1.5 UNDERSTANDING NATURAL DISASTERS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

This idea held for many centuries until Galileo\u2019s\ntelescope helped allow people to realize that Earth is not the center\nof the universe. They also found out that there are many more stars\nthan were visible to the naked eye. All of those stars were in the\nMilky Way Galaxy.\nIn the early 20th century, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble\ndiscovered that what scientists called the Andromeda Nebula was\nover 2 million light-years away, many times farther than the farthest\ndistances that had ever been measured. Hubble realized that many\nof the objects that astronomers called nebulas were not clouds of\ngas, but were collections of millions or billions of stars that we now\ncall galaxies.\nHubble showed that the universe was much larger than our galaxy.\nToday, we know that the universe contains about a hundred billion\ngalaxies, about the same number of galaxies as there are stars in the\nMilky Way Galaxy. Edwin Hubble went on to measure the distance\nto hundreds of other galaxies after discovering that there are galaxies\nbeyond the Milky Way. His data would eventually show how the\nuniverse is changing, and would even yield clues as to how the 140 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nuniverse formed. Today we now know that the universe in nearly 14\nbillion years old.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The spectrum will have\nspecific dark bands where elements in the star absorb light of\nparticular energies. By examining the arrangement of these dark\nabsorption lines, astronomers can determine the composition of\nelements that make up a distant star. The element helium was first 2.1 THE UNIVERSE | 141\ndiscovered in our Sun, not on Earth, by analyzing the absorption\nlines in the spectrum of the Sun.\nWhile studying the spectrum of light from distant galaxies,\nastronomers noticed something strange. The dark lines in the\nspectrum were in the patterns they expected, but they were shifted\ntoward the red end of the spectrum. This shift of absorption bands\ntoward the red end of the spectrum is known as redshift.\n\u201cThree Steps to the Hubble Constant\u201d by NASA is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nRedshift occurs when the light source is moving away from the\nobserver or when the space between the observer and the source is\nstretched. What does it mean that stars and galaxies are redshifted?\nWhen astronomers see redshift in the light from a galaxy, they know\nthat the galaxy is moving away from Earth. What astronomers are\nnoticing is that all the galaxies have a redshift, strongly indicating\nthat all galaxies are moving away from each other, causing the\nUniverse to expand. 142 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nRedshift can occur with other types of waves, too, called the\nDoppler Effect. An analogy to redshift is the noise a siren makes as\nit passes. As it passes by, the ambulance will seem to lower the pitch\nof its siren. This is because the sound waves shift towards a lower\npitch when the ambulance speeds away. Though redshift involves\nlight instead of sound, a similar principle operates in both\nsituations.\nThe Expanding Universe\nEdwin Hubble combined his measurements of the distances to\ngalaxies with other astronomers\u2019 measurements of redshift. From\nthis data, he noticed a relationship, called Hubble\u2019s Law, that states\nthat the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from\nus. What this leads to is the hypothesis that the universe is\nexpanding. 2.1 THE UNIVERSE | 143\n\u201cTimeline of the Expanding Universe\u201d by NASA is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nThe figure above by NASA shows a simplified diagram of the\nexpansion of the universe. If we look closely at the diagram, the\nformation of the universe and the energy is relatively high. Over the\n13.7 billion years, the energy begins to cool enough to create\ntrillions of stars and, over time, develop into galaxies. Over time, the\ngalaxies continue to cool and expand farther apart from each other. 144 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

According to the Big Bang\ntheory, the universe began about 13.7 billion years ago. Everything\nthat is now in the universe was squeezed into a tiny volume of hot,\nchaotic mass. An enormous explosion, a big bang \u2013 caused the\nuniverse to start expanding rapidly. All the matter and energy in the\nuniverse and even space itself came out of this explosion. Currently,\nthere is not a way for scientists to know since there is no remaining\nevidence. 146 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nAfter the Big Bang\nIn the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was\nunimaginably hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became\nless dense and began to cool. After only a few seconds, protons,\nneutrons, and electrons formed. After a few minutes, those\nsubatomic particles came together to create hydrogen. The energy\nin the universe was significant enough to initiate nuclear fusion,\nand hydrogen nuclei were fused into helium nuclei. The first\nneutral atoms that included electrons did not form until about\n380,000 years later.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

However, recent discoveries continue to shake\nup our understanding of the universe. Astronomers and other\nscientists are now wrestling with some unanswered questions about\nwhat the universe is made of and why it is expanding. Many\ncosmologists create mathematical models and computer\nsimulations to account for these unknown phenomena, such as\ndark energy and dark matter.\nThe things we observe in space are objects that emit\nelectromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter\nthat emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the\nuniverse. The rest of the matter, about 80 percent, is dark matter.\nDark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cannot\nobserve it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter\nexists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it.\nWhen astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find\nthat the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts\ncloser to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more\nmatter in the galaxy than they can see. 2.1 THE UNIVERSE | 149\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

To explain\nstrong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be\npresent. With so little to go on, astronomers do not know much\nabout the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just\nbe ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as\nblack holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs, objects more massive\nthan Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. However,\nastronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which\nthey have named MACHOS (massive astrophysical compact halo\nobject), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be\nonly a small part of the total. 150 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nAnother possibility is that the dark matter is thought to be much\ndifferent from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be\nparticles that have gravity, but do not otherwise appear to interact\nwith other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles\nWIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles.\nMost scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in\nthe universe is a combination of massive astrophysical compact halo\nobjects (MACHOS) and some exotic matter such as weakly-\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs).

If yes, then the universe will\nexpand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time.\nIf no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and\neventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the\nBig Bang. Observations of the universe show that it is expanding\nfaster now than ever before, and in the future, it will expand even\nfaster. So now, astronomers think that the universe will keep\nexpanding forever. However, it also proposes a problematic new\nquestion: What is causing the expansion of the universe to\naccelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical\nform of energy called dark energy.

The\nage, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the\nhistory, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are\nresponsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements\nsuch as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are\nintimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that\nmay coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life,\nand death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.\u201d (Stars |\nScience Mission Directorate, n.d.)\nAlthough constellations have stars that usually only appear to be\nclose together, stars may be found in the same portion of space.\nStars that are grouped tightly together are called star systems.\nLarger groups of hundreds or thousands of stars are called star\nclusters. The image shown here is a famous star cluster known as\nPleiades, which can be seen with the naked autumn sky. 2.1 THE UNIVERSE | 153\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

A system of two stars orbiting each other is a binary star. A\nsystem with more than two stars orbiting each other is a multiple\nstar system. The stars in a binary or multiple star system are often so\nclose together that they appear as only through a telescope can the\npair be distinguished.\nStar clusters are divided into two main types, open clusters and\nglobular clusters. Open clusters are groups of up to a few\nthousand stars that are loosely held together by gravity. Pleiades is\nan open cluster that is also called the Seven Sisters. Open clusters\ntend to be blue and often contain glowing gas and dust and are 154 | 2.1 THE UNIVERSE\nmade of young stars formed from the same nebula. The stars may\neventually be pulled apart by gravitational attraction to other\nobjects.\nGlobular clusters are groups of tens to hundreds of thousands of\nstars held tightly together by gravity. Globular clusters have a\ndefinite, spherical shape and contain mostly reddish stars. The stars\nare closer together, closer to the center of the cluster. Globular\nclusters do not have much dust in them \u2014 the dust has already\nformed into stars. 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\nTypes of Galaxies\nGalaxies are the most prominent groups of stars and can contain\nanywhere from a few million stars to many billions of stars.

Several\narms spiral outward in the Pinwheel Galaxy and are appropriately 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 157\ncalled spiral arms.

The\nsmallest elliptical galaxies are as small as some globular clusters.\nGiant elliptical galaxies, on the other hand, can contain over a\ntrillion stars. Elliptical galaxies are reddish to yellowish because they\ncontain mostly old stars. Most elliptical galaxies contain very little\ngas and dust because they had already formed.

Most irregular galaxies were once spiral or\nelliptical galaxies that were then deformed either by gravitational\nattraction to a more massive galaxy or by a collision with another\ngalaxy.\nDwarf galaxies are small galaxies containing only a few million to a\nfew billion stars. Dwarf galaxies are the most common type in the\nuniverse. However, because they are relatively small and dim, we do\nnot see as many dwarf galaxies from Earth. Most dwarf galaxies are\nirregular in shape. However, there are also dwarf elliptical galaxies\nand dwarf spiral galaxies.\nLook back at the picture of the spiral galaxy, Andromeda. Next to\nour closest galaxy neighbor are two dwarf elliptical galaxies that are\ncompanions to the Andromeda Galaxy. One is a bright sphere to\nthe left of center, and the other is a long ellipse below and to the\ncenter\u2019s right. Dwarf galaxies are often found near more massive\ngalaxies. They sometimes collide with and merge into their larger\nneighbors.\nMilky Way Galaxy\nOn a dark, clear night, a milky band of light will stretch across the\nsky. This band is the disk of a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy is our\ngalaxy and is made up of millions of stars along with a lot of gas and\ndust. Although it is difficult to know what the shape of the Milky 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 159\nWay Galaxy is because we are inside of it, astronomers have\nidentified it as a typical spiral galaxy containing about 100 billion to\n400 billion stars.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=121\nLike other spiral galaxies, our galaxy has a disk, a central bulge, and\nspiral arms. The disk is about 100,000 light-years across and 3,000\nlight-years thick. Most of the Galaxy\u2019s gas, dust, young stars, and\nopen clusters are in the disk. Scientists know that the Milky Way is a\nspiral galaxy because of the shape of the galaxy as from Earth\u2019s\nperspective, the velocities of stars and gas in the galaxy show a\nrotational motion, and the gases, color, and dust are typical of spiral\ngalaxies. 160 | 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\nThe central bulge is about 12,000 to 16,000 light-years wide and\n6,000 to 10,000 light-years thick. The central bulge contains mostly\nolder stars and globular clusters. Some recent evidence suggests the\nbulge might not be spherical, but is instead shaped like a bar. The\nbar might be as long as 27,000 light-years long. The disk and bulge\nare surrounded by a faint, spherical halo, which also includes old\nstars and globular clusters. Astronomers have discovered that there\nis a gigantic black hole at the center of the galaxy.\nThe Milky Way Galaxy is a significant place. Our solar system,\nincluding the Sun, Earth, and all the other planets, is within one of\nthe spiral arms in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. Most of the\nstars we see in the sky are relatively nearby stars that are also in this\nspiral arm. Earth is about 26,000 light-years from the center of the\ngalaxy, a little more than halfway out from the center of the galaxy\nto the edge.\nJust as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun and solar system orbit the\ncenter of the Milky Way Galaxy. One orbit of the solar system takes\nabout 225 to 250 million years. The solar system has orbited 20 to\n25 times since it formed 4.6 billion years ago. Astronomers have\nrecently found that at the center of the Milky Way, and most other\ngalaxies, is a supermassive black hole, though a black hole cannot be\nseen.\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/O37DrGZxDyw\nNuclear Fusion within Stars\nThe Sun is Earth\u2019s primary source of energy, yet the planet only 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 161\nreceives a small portion of its energy, and the Sun is just an ordinary\nstar. Many stars produce much more energy than the Sun. The\nenergy source for all stars is nuclear fusion.\nStars are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, which are packed so\ndensely in a star that is the star\u2019s center. The pressure is enormous\nenough to initiate nuclear fusion reactions. In a nuclear fusion\nreaction, the nuclei of two atoms combine to create a new atom.\nMost commonly, two hydrogen atoms fuse to become a helium\natom in the core of a star. Although nuclear fusion reactions\nrequire much energy to get started, they produce enormous\namounts of energy once they are going.\nIn a star, the energy from fusion reactions in the core pushes\noutward to balance the inward pull of the star\u2019s gravity. This energy\nmoves outward through the star\u2019s layers until it finally reaches the\nstar\u2019s outer surface. The star\u2019s outer layer glows brightly, sending\nthe energy into space as electromagnetic radiation, including\nvisible light, heat, ultraviolet light, and radio waves.\nIn particle accelerators, subatomic particles are propelled until they\nhave attained almost the same amount of energy as found in the\ncore of a star. When these particles collide head-on, new particles\nare created. This process simulates the nuclear fusion that takes\nplace in the cores of stars. The process also mimics the conditions\nthat allowed for the first helium atom to be produced from the\ncollision of two hydrogen atoms in the first few minutes of the\nuniverse. 162 | 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

A coil of an electric stove will start black, but with\nadded heat will start to glow a dull red. With more heat, the coil\nturns a brighter red, then orange. At extremely high temperatures,\nthe coil will turn yellow-white or even blue-white. A star\u2019s color is\nalso determined by the temperature of the star\u2019s surface. Relatively\ncool stars are red, warmer stars are orange or yellow, and extremely\nhot stars are blue or blue-white.\nColor is the most common way to classify stars. A star\u2019s class is 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 163\ngiven by a letter, where each letter corresponds to a color and\ntemperature range. Note that these letters do not match the color\nnames; they are leftover from an older system that is no longer used.\nFor most stars, the surface temperature is also related to size. Bigger,\nbluish-white stars produce more energy and have hotter surfaces\nthan smaller, yellow stars that produce less energy, so their surfaces\nare hotter than smaller stars. These stars tend toward bluish-white.\nStars have a life cycle that is expressed similarly to the life cycle of a\nliving creature: they are born, grow, change over time, and\neventually die. Most stars vary in size, color, and class at least once\nin their lifetime. What astronomers know about the life cycles of\nstars is because of data gathered from visual, radio, and X-ray\ntelescopes.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 164 | 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\nthe text.

This term\ncomes from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shown below. For\nstars on the main sequence, the temperature is directly related to\nbrightness. A star is on the main sequence as long as it can balance\nthe inward force of gravity with the outward force of nuclear fusion\nin its core. The more massive a star, the more it must burn\nhydrogen fuel to prevent internal gravitational collapse. Because\nthey burn more fuel, massive stars have higher temperatures, but\nrun out of hydrogen sooner than smaller stars.\nOur Sun, a yellow star, has been a main-sequence star for about 5\nbillion years and will continue on the main sequence for about 5\nbillion more years. Massive stars may be on the main sequence for\nonly 10 million years. Tiny stars may last tens to hundreds of\nbillions of years.\nRed Giants and White Dwarfs\nAs a star begins to use up its hydrogen, it fuses helium atoms into\nheavier atoms such as carbon. A blue giant star has exhausted its 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 165\nhydrogen fuel and is a transitional phase. When the light elements\nare mostly used up, the star can no longer resist gravity, and it starts\nto collapse inward. The outer layers of the star grow outward and\ncool. The larger, cooler star turns red, and so is called a red giant.\nEventually, a red giant burns up all of the helium in its core. What\nhappens next depends on how massive the star is. A typical star,\nsuch as the Sun, stops fusion completely. Gravitational collapse\nshrinks the star\u2019s core to a white, glowing object about Earth\u2019s size,\ncalled a white dwarf, which will ultimately fade out.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

When very massive stars leave the main sequence, they\nbecome red supergiants. Unlike a red giant, when all the helium in\na red supergiant is gone, fusion continues. Lighter atoms fuse into\nheavier atoms up to iron atoms. Creating elements heavier than\niron through fusion uses more energy than it produces, so stars do\nnot ordinarily form any heavier elements. When there are no more 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 167\nelements for the star to fuse, the core succumbs to gravity and\ncollapses, creating an explosion called a supernova.\nA supernova explosion contains so much energy that atoms can\nfuse to produce heavier elements such as gold, silver, and uranium.\nA supernova can shine as brightly as an entire galaxy for a short\ntime.

To see an example of parallax, try\nholding your finger about 30 cm (1 foot) in front of your eyes.\nNow, while focusing on your finger, close one eye and then the\nother. Alternate back and forth between eyes, and pay attention to\nhow your finger appears to move. The shift in the position of your\nfinger is an example of parallax. Now try moving your finger closer\nto your eyes, and repeat the experiment and notice any differences.\nThe closer your finger is to your eyes, the more significant the\nposition changes because of parallax. 176 | 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\nAstronomers use this same principle to measure the distance to\nstars. Instead of a finger, they focus on a star, and instead of\nswitching back and forth between eyes, they switch between the\nmost significant possible differences in observing position. To do\nthis, an astronomer first looks at the star from one position and\nnotes where the star is relative to more distant stars. Now, where\nwill the astronomer go to observe the most significant distance from\nthe first observation? In six months, after Earth moves from one\nside of its orbit around the Sun to the other side, the astronomer\nlooks at the star again. This time parallax causes the star to appear in\na different position relative to more distant stars. From the size of\nthis shift, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Astronomers have\ndeveloped yet another novel way to use the 24-year-old space\ntelescope by employing a technique called spatial scanning, which\ndramatically improves Hubble\u2019s accuracy for making angular\nmeasurements. The technique, when applied to the age-old method\nfor gauging distances called astronomical parallax, extends Hubble\u2019s\ntape measure ten times farther into space. \u201cThis new capability is\nexpected to yield new insight into the nature of dark energy, a\nmysterious component of space that is pushing the universe apart at\nan ever-faster rate,\u201d said Noble laureate Adam Riess of the Space\nTelescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore, Md.\nParallax, a trigonometric technique, is the most reliable method for\nmaking astronomical distance measurements, and a practice long\nemployed by land surveyors here on Earth. Earth\u2019s orbit\u2019s diameter\nis the base of a triangle, and the star is the apex where the triangle\u2019s\nsides meet. The lengths of the sides are calculated by accurately\nmeasuring the three angles of the resulting triangle. Astronomical\nparallax works reliably well for stars within a few hundred light-\nyears of Earth. (Northon, 2014)\nFor example, measurements of the distance to Alpha Centauri, the\nstar system closest to our sun, vary only by one arc second. This\nvariance in distance is equal to the apparent width of a dime seen\nfrom two miles away. Stars farther out have much smaller angles of\napparent back-and-forth motion that are extremely difficult to\nmeasure. (Northon, 2014)\nAstronomers have pushed to extend the parallax yardstick ever 178 | 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS\ndeeper into our galaxy by measuring smaller angles more accurately.\nThis new long-range precision was proven when scientists\nsuccessfully used Hubble to measure the distance of a particular\nclass of bright stars called Cepheid variables, approximately 7,500\nlight-years away in the northern constellation Auriga. The\ntechnique worked so well; they are now using Hubble to measure\nthe distances of other far-flung Cepheids. Such measurements will\nbe used to provide a firmer footing for the so-called cosmic\n\u201cdistance ladder.\u201d This ladder\u2019s \u201cbottom rung\u201d is built on\nmeasurements to Cepheid variable stars that, because of their\nknown brightness, have been used for more than a century to gauge\nthe size of the observable universe. They are the first step in\ncalibrating far more distant extra-galactic milepost markers such as\nType Ia supernovae.\nRiess and the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., in\ncollaboration with Stefano Casertano of STScI, developed a\ntechnique to use Hubble to make measurements as small as five-\nbillionths of a degree. To make a distance measurement, two\nexposures of the target Cepheid star were taken six months apart,\nwhen Earth was on opposite sides of the sun. A very subtle shift in\nthe star\u2019s position was measured to an accuracy of 1\/1,000 the\nwidth of a single image pixel in Hubble\u2019s Wide Field Camera 3,\nwhich has 16.8 megapixels total. A third exposure was taken after\nanother six months to allow for the team to subtract the effects of\nthe subtle space motion of stars, with additional exposures used to\nremove other sources of error.\nRiess shares the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize in Physics with another\nteam for his leadership in the 1998 discovery the universe\u2019s 2.2 GALAXIES AND STARS | 179\nexpansion rate is accelerating \u2014 a phenomenon widely attributed\nto a mysterious, unexplained dark energy filling the universe. This\nnew high-precision distance measurement technique is enabling\nRiess to gauge just how much the universe is stretching. His goal is\nto refine estimates of the universe\u2019s expansion rate to the point\nwhere dark energy can be better characterized. (Northon, 2014) 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nGeocentric Model\nHumans\u2019 view of the solar system has evolved as technology and\nscientific knowledge has increased. The ancient Greeks identified\nfive of the planets, and they were the only planets known for many\ncenturies. Since then, scientists have discovered two more planets,\nmany other solar-system objects, and even planets found outside\nour solar system. (Introduction to the Solar System | Earth Science,\nn.d.)\nThe ancient Greeks believed that Earth was at the center of the\nuniverse. This view is called the geocentric \u201cEarth-centered\u201d\nmodel. In the geocentric model, the sky, or heavens, are a set of\nspheres layered on top of one another. Each object in the sky is\nattached to a sphere and moves around Earth as that sphere rotates.\nFrom Earth outward, these spheres contain the Moon, Mercury,\nVenus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. An outer sphere holds\nall the stars. Since the planets appear to move much faster than the\nstars, the Greeks placed them closer to Earth.\nThe geocentric model worked well by explaining why all the stars\nappear to rotate around Earth once per day. The model also\nexplained why the planets move differently from the stars and each\nother. One problem with the geocentric model is that some planets 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 181\nseem to move backward, in retrograde, instead of in their usual\nforward motion around Earth.\nAround 150 A.D., the astronomer Ptolemy resolved this problem\nby using a system of circles to describe the motion of planets. In\nPtolemy\u2019s system, a planet moves in a small circle, called an\nepicycle. This circle moves around Earth in a larger circle, called a\ndeferent. Ptolemy\u2019s version of the geocentric model worked so well\nthat it remained the accepted model of the universe for more than a\nthousand years.\nHeliocentric Model\nPtolemy\u2019s geocentric model worked, but it was not only\ncomplicated, it occasionally made errors in predicting the\nmovement of planets. At the beginning of the 16th century A.D.,\nNicolaus Copernicus proposed that Earth and all the other planets\norbit the Sun. With the Sun at the center, this model is called the\nheliocentric or \u201csun-centered\u201d model of the universe. Copernicus\u2019\nmodel explained the motion of the planets, as well as Ptolemy\u2019s\nmodel, did, but it did not require complicated additions like\nepicycles and deferents.\nAlthough Copernicus\u2019 model worked more simply than Ptolemy\u2019s,\nit still did not entirely describe the motion of the planets because,\nlike Ptolemy, Copernicus thought planets moved in perfect circles.\nNot long after Copernicus, Johannes Kepler refined the\nheliocentric model so that the planets moved around the Sun in\nellipses (ovals), not circles. Kepler\u2019s model matched observations\nperfectly. 182 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Galileo\ndiscovered that the planet Jupiter has moons orbiting around it.\nThis provided the first evidence that objects could orbit something\nbesides Earth. Galileo also discovered that Venus has phases like the\nMoon, which provides direct proof that Venus orbits the Sun. 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 183\nGalileo\u2019s discoveries caused many more people to accept the\nheliocentric model of the universe, although Galileo himself was\nfound guilty of heresy for his ideas.

Ptolemy made the best model he could with the\nassumption that Earth was the center of the universe, but by letting\nthat assumption go, Copernicus came up with a much simpler\nmodel. Before people would accept that Copernicus was right, they\nneeded to accept that the Sun was the center of the solar system. 184 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nToday we know that just as Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun and solar\nsystem orbit the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The center of the\nMilky way may likely be a massive black hole. One orbit of the solar\nsystem takes about 225 to 250 million years. It is believed that the\nsolar system has orbited 20 to 25 times since it formed 4.6 billion\nyears ago.\nModern Solar System\nToday, we know that our solar system is just one tiny part of the\nuniverse. Neither Earth nor the Sun is at the center of the universe.\nHowever, the heliocentric model accurately describes the solar\nsystem. In our modern view of the solar system, the Sun is at the\ncenter, with the planets moving in elliptical orbits around the Sun.\nThe planets do not emit their light, but instead, reflect light from\nthe Sun.\nEsri has created an excellent story map called the Solar System Atlas.\nNASA has created a great website called Solar System Exploration,\nand National Geographic has created a great resource called Solar\nSystem.

Some extrasolar planets\nhave been directly observed, but indirect methods have discovered\nmost. One technique involves detecting a star\u2019s very slight motion\nperiodically moving toward and away from us along our line-of-\nsight, known as a star\u2019s radial velocity. This periodic motion can\nbe attributed to the gravitational pull of a planet or, sometimes,\nanother star orbiting the star. 186 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nA planet may also be identified by measuring a star\u2019s brightness over\ntime. A temporary, periodic decrease in light emitted from a star\ncan occur when a planet crosses in front of the star it is orbiting,\ncalled a transit, momentarily blocking out some of the starlight.\nMore than 3,600 extrasolar planets have been identified, and the\nrate of discovery is increasing rapidly.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

In general, the farther away from\nthe Sun, the higher the distance from one planet\u2019s orbit to the next.\nThe orbits of the planets are not circular but slightly elliptical with\nthe Sun located at one of the foci.\nWhile studying the solar system, Johannes Kepler discovered the\nrelationship between the time it takes a planet to make one\ncomplete orbit around the Sun, its \u201corbital period,\u201d and the\ndistance from the Sun to the planet. If the orbital period of a planet\nis known, it is possible to determine the planet\u2019s distance from the\nSun. This is how astronomers without modern telescopes could\ndetermine the distances to other planets within the solar system.\nDistances in the solar system are often measured in astronomical\nunits (AU). One astronomical unit is defined as the distance from\nEarth to the Sun. 1 AU equals about 150 million kilometers or 93\nmillion miles. The table below shows the distances to the planets\n(the average radius of orbits) in AU. The table also indicates how\nlong it takes each planet to spin on its axis (the length of a day) and\nhow long it takes each planet to complete an orbit (the length of a\nyear); in particular, notice how slowly Venus rotates relative to\nEarth. raeY\nfo\nhtgneL\nyaD\nfo\nhtgneL\nnuS\nmorf\necnatsiD\negarevA\ntenalP\n)sraeY\nhtraE\nnI(\n42.0\n)syaD\nhtraE\nnI(\n48.65\n)UA(\nstinU\nlacimonortsA\n93.0\nyrucreM\n26.0\n20.342\n27.0\nsuneV\n00.1\n00.1\n00.1\nhtraE\n88.1\n30.1\n25.1\nsraM\n68.11\n14.0\n2.5\nretipuJ\n64.92\n34.0\n45.9\nnrutaS\n10.48\n27.0\n22.91\nsunarU\n8.461\n76.0\n60.03\nenutpeN 192 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nThe Role of Gravity\nIsaac Newton was one of the first scientists to explore gravity. He\nunderstood that the Moon circles the Earth because a force is\npulling the Moon toward Earth\u2019s center. Without that force, the\nMoon would continue moving in a straight line off into space.\nNewton also came to understand that the same force that keeps the\nMoon in its orbit is the same force that causes objects on Earth to\nfall to the ground.\nNewton defined the Universal Law of Gravitation, which states\nthat a force of attraction, called gravity, exists between all objects in\nthe universe. The strength of the gravitational force depends on\nhow much mass the objects have and how far apart they are from\neach other. The greater the objects\u2019 mass, the higher the force of\nattraction; also, the greater the distance between the objects, the\nsmaller the force of attraction.\nThe distance between the Sun and each of its planets is substantial,\nbut the Sun and each of the planets are also gigantic. Gravity keeps\neach planet orbiting the Sun because the star and its planets are\nenormous objects. The force of gravity also holds moons in orbit\naround planets. There are two additional key features of the solar\nsystem that helps us understand how it formed: 1) All the planets\nlie in nearly the same plane, or flat disk-like region, 2) All the\nplanets orbit in the same direction around the Sun. 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 193\nFormation of the Solar System\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

According to this\nhypothesis, the Sun and the planets of our solar system formed\nabout 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant cloud of gas\nand dust, called a nebula. 194 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=123\nThe nebula was drawn together by gravity, which released\ngravitational potential energy. As small particles of dust and gas\nsmashed together to create larger ones, they released kinetic energy.\nAs the nebula collapsed, the gravity at the center increased, and the\ncloud started to spin because of its angular momentum. As it\ncollapsed further, the spinning got faster, much as an ice skater\nspins faster when he pulls his arms to his sides during a spin.\nMuch of the cloud\u2019s mass migrated to its center, but the rest of the\nmaterial flattened out in an enormous disk. The disk contained\nhydrogen and helium, along with heavier elements and even simple\norganic molecules. 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 195\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=123\nFormation of the Sun and Planets\nAs gravity pulled matter into the center of the disk, the density and\npressure at the center became intense. When the pressure in the\ncenter of the disk was high enough, nuclear fusion within our star\nbegan, and the blazing star stopped the disk from collapsing\nfurther.\nMeanwhile, the outer parts of the disk were cooling off. Matter\ncondensed from the cloud, and small pieces of dust started\nclumping together to create ever bigger clumps of matter. Larger\nclumps, called planetesimals, attracted smaller clumps with their 196 | 2.3 THE SOLAR SYSTEM\ngravity. Gravity at the center of the disk attracted more massive\nparticles, such as rock and metal, and lighter particles remained\nfurther out in the disk. Eventually, the planetesimals formed\nprotoplanets, which grew to become the planets and moons that\nwe find in our solar system today.\nThe gravitational sorting of material with the inner planets,\nMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, dense rock and metal formed.\nThe outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune,\ncondensed farther from the Sun from lighter materials such as\nhydrogen, helium, water, ammonia, and methane. Out by Jupiter\nand beyond, where it is frigid, these materials formed solid particles.\nThe nebular hypothesis was designed to explain some of the\nessential features of the solar system:\n\u2022 Orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane with the Sun\nat the center\n\u2022 Planets revolve in the same direction\n\u2022 Planets mostly rotate in the same direction\n\u2022 Axes of rotation of the planets are mostly nearly perpendicular\nto the orbital plane\n\u2022 Oldest moon rocks are 4.5 billion years\nThe two videos below, from the European Space Agency (ESA),\ndiscusses the Sun, planets, and other bodies in the Solar System and\nhow they formed.

At such high temperatures, hydrogen\ncombines to form helium by nuclear fusion, a process that releases\nvast amounts of energy. This energy moves outward towards the\nouter layers of the Sun.\nThe radiative zone, just outside the core, has a temperature of\nabout 7 million degrees Celsius. The energy released in the core\ntravels exceptionally slow through the radiative zone. A particle of\nlight, called a photon, travels only a few millimeters before it hits\nanother particle. The photon is absorbed and then released again. A\nphoton may take as long as 50 million years to travel through the\nradiative zone. 2.4 THE SUN | 201\nIn the convection zone, hot material from near the radiative zone\nrises, cools at the Sun\u2019s surface, and then plunges back downward to\nthe radiative zone.

The photosphere is relatively cool, only about 6,700\ndegrees Celsius. The photosphere has several different colors;\noranges, yellows, and reds, giving it a grainy appearance.\nThe chromosphere is a thin zone, about 2,000 km thick, that\nglows red as energy heats it from the photosphere. Temperatures in\nthe chromosphere range from about 4,000-10,000 degrees Celsius.\nJets of gas fire up through the chromosphere at speeds up to 72,000\nkm per hour, reaching heights as high as 10,000 km.\nThe corona is the outermost plasma layer and is called the Sun\u2019s\nhalo or crown.

Rovers have landed on\nMars and sent back enormous amounts of information, but much\nof the rest of what is known about the inner planets are from\nsatellite images.\nThe inner planets, or terrestrial planets, are the four planets\nclosest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Unlike the\nouter planets, which have many satellites, Mercury and Venus do\nnot have moons, Earth has one, and Mars has two. Of course, the\ninner planets have shorter orbits around the Sun, and they all spin\nmore slowly. Geologically, the inner planets are all made of cooled\nigneous rock with iron cores, and all have been geologically active,\nat least early in their history. None of the inner planets has rings.\n(Inner Planets | Earth Science, n.d.)\nTerrestrial planets are substantially different from gas giants, which\nmight not have solid surfaces and are composed mostly of\nhydrogen, helium, and water existing in various physical states.\nTerrestrial planets all have roughly the same structure: a central\nmetallic core, mostly iron, with a surrounding silicate mantle.\nTerrestrial planets have canyons, craters, mountains, volcanoes, and\nsecondary atmospheres. 212 | 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS\nMercury\nThe smallest planet, Mercury, is the planet closest to the Sun.\nBecause of Mercury\u2019s proximity to the Sun, it is difficult to observe\nfrom Earth, even with a telescope. However, the Mariner 10\nspacecraft visited Mercury from 1974 to 1975. The MESSENGER\nspacecraft, which stands for Mercury Surface, Space Environment,\nGeochemistry, and Ranging, has been studying Mercury in detail\nsince 2005. The craft is currently in orbit around the planet, where\nit is creating detailed maps. MESSENGER stands for Mercury\nSurface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging.\nThe surface of Mercury is covered with craters. Ancient impact\ncraters mean that for billions of years, Mercury has not changed\nmuch geologically. Also, with minimal atmosphere, the processes of\nweathering and erosion do not wear down structures on the planet.\nMercury is one of the solar system\u2019s densest planets. It is relatively\nlarge, liquid core, made mostly of melted iron, takes up about 42\npercent of the planet\u2019s volume. 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS | 213\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

A year on Mercury, the length of time it takes to\norbit the Sun is just 88 Earth days.\nDespite its short years, Mercury has very long days. A day is defined\nas the time it takes a planet to turn on its axis. Mercury rotates\nslowly on its axis, turning precisely three times for every two times it\norbits the Sun. Therefore, each day on Mercury is 57 Earth days\nlong. In other words, on Mercury, a year is only a Mercury day and\na half long!\nMercury is close to the Sun so that it can get scorching. However, 214 | 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS\nMercury has virtually no atmosphere, no water to insulate the\nsurface, and rotates very slowly. For these reasons, temperatures on\nthe surface of Mercury vary widely. Indirect sunlight, the surface\ncan be as hot as 427 degrees Celsius (801 degrees Fahrenheit). On\nthe dark side, or in the shadows inside craters, the surface can be as\ncold as -183 degrees Celsius (-297 degrees Fahrenheit). Although\nmost of Mercury is extremely dry, scientists think there may be a\nsmall amount of water in the form of ice at the poles of Mercury, in\nareas that never receive direct sunlight.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Venus\u2019 thick clouds reflect sunlight well, so\nVenus is very bright, making it the brightest object in the sky beside\nthe Sun and the Moon. Because the orbit of Venus is inside Earth\u2019s\norbit, Venus always appears close to the Sun. When Venus rises just\nbefore the Sun rises, the bright object is called the morning star.\nWhen it sets just after the Sun sets, it is the evening star.\nOf the planets, Venus is most similar to Earth in size and density.\nVenus is also our nearest neighbor. The planet\u2019s interior structure is\nsimilar to Earth\u2019s with a large iron core and a silicate mantle.\nHowever, the resemblance between the two inner planets ends\nthere.\nVenus rotates in a direction opposite the other planets and opposite\nto the direction it orbits the Sun. This rotation is extremely slow,\nonly one turn every 243 days. This is longer than a year on Venus,\nwhere it only takes Venus 224 days to orbit the Sun. 216 | 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Clouds on Venus are made mostly\nof carbon dioxide with a bit of sulfur dioxide and corrosive sulfuric\nacid. Because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, the atmosphere\ntraps heat from the Sun and creates a powerful greenhouse effect.\nEven though Venus is further from the Sun than Mercury, the\ngreenhouse effect makes Venus the hottest planet. Temperatures at\nthe surface reach 465 degrees Celsius (860 degrees Fahrenheit),\nwhich is hot enough to melt lead.\nThe atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the atmospheric pressure\non the planet\u2019s surface is 90 times greater than the atmospheric 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS | 217\npressure on Earth\u2019s surface. The dense atmosphere obscures the\nsurface of Venus, even from spacecraft orbiting the planet.\nSince spacecraft cannot see through the thick atmosphere, radar is\nused to map Venus\u2019 surface. Many features found on the surface are\nsimilar to Earth and yet are very different. Orbiting spacecraft have\nused radar to reveal mountains, valleys, and canyons. Most of the\nsurface has large areas of volcanoes surrounded by plains of lava.\nVenus has many more volcanoes than any other planet in the solar\nsystem, and some of those volcanoes are very large. Most of the\nvolcanoes are no longer active, but scientists have found that there\nis some active volcanism.\nIt is difficult for scientists to figure out the geological history of\nVenus. The environment is too harsh for a rover to go there. It is\neven more difficult for students to figure out the geological history\nof a distant planet based on the information given here. Scientists\ncan still piece information together to begin t understand Venus\u2019s\npast.\nOn Earth, volcanism is generated because the planet\u2019s interior is\nhot. Much of the volcanic activity is caused by plate tectonic\nactivity. However, on Venus, there is no evidence of plate\nboundaries, and volcanic features do not line up the way they do at\nplate boundaries.\nBecause the density of impact craters can be used to determine how\nold a planet\u2019s surface is, the small number of impact craters means\nthat Venus\u2019 surface is still relatively young. Scientists think that\nthere is frequent, planet-wide resurfacing of Venus with volcanism\ntaking place in many locations. The cause is the heat that builds up 218 | 2.5 TERRESTRIAL PLANETS\nbelow the surface that has no es-cape until finally it destroys the\ncrust and results in volcanoes.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Astronomers think\nthat hydrogen and helium gases comprised much of the solar system\nwhen it first formed. Since the inner planets did not have enough\nmass to hold on to these light gases, their hydrogen and helium\nfloated away into space. The Sun and the massive outer planets had\nenough gravity to keep hydrogen and helium from drifting away.\n(Outer Planets | Earth Science, n.d.)\nAll of the outer planets have numerous moons. They all also have\nplanetary rings, composed of dust and other small particles that\nencircle the planet in a thin plane.\nJupiter\nBecause Jupiter is so massive, it reflects much sunlight and appears\nbright in the night sky; only the Moon and Venus are brighter. This 238 | 2.6 GAS GIANTS\nbrightness is all the more impressive because Jupiter is quite far\nfrom the Earth, 5.20 AUs away.

Like the other gas\ngiants, it is less dense than Earth. Hypothetically, astronauts trying\nto land a spaceship on the surface of Jupiter would find that there is\nno solid surface.

In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens\nrealized that the features were rings.

Light from the Sun\ntakes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus, and the planet\norbits the Sun once about every 84 Earth years. Uranus has a mass\nof about 14 times the mass of Earth, but it is much less dense than\nEarth. Gravity at the surface of Uranus is weaker than on Earth\u2019s 2.6 GAS GIANTS | 253\nsurface, so if a human were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, they\nwould weigh about 10 percent less than what they would weigh on\nEarth.\n\u201cUranus\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nLike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is composed mainly of hydrogen\nand helium, with an outer gas layer that gives way to liquid on the\ninside. Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials, including\nwater, ammonia (NH3), and methane (CH4) than Jupiter and\nSaturn. When sunlight reflects off Uranus, clouds of methane filter\nout red light, giving the planet a blue-green color. There are bands\nof clouds in Uranus\u2019 atmosphere, but they are hard to see in normal\nlight, so the planet looks like a plain blue ball.\nMost of the solar system planets rotate on their axes in the same\ndirection as they move around the Sun. Uranus is tilted on its side,\nso its axis is almost identical to its orbit. It rotates like a top that was\nturned so that it was spinning parallel to the floor.

Halley\u2019s comet, with a period of 75 years, will\nnext be seen in 2061. The first mention of the comet in historical\nrecords may go back as much as two millennia. Short-period comets,\nwith periods of about 200 years or less, come from a region beyond\nNeptune\u2019s orbit. The Kui-per belt (pronounced \u201cKI-per\u201d) contains\nnot only comets, but asteroids, and at least two dwarf planets.\nComets, with periods as long as thousands or even millions of years, 266 | 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\ncome from a distant region of the solar system called the Oort\ncloud, about 50,000\u2013100,000 AU from the Sun (50,000\u2013100,000\ntimes the distance from the Sun to Earth).\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

With the discovery of\nmany new objects in our solar system, in 2006, astronomers refined\nthe definition of a planet. Their subsequent reclassification of Pluto\nto the new category dwarf planet stirred up a great deal of\ncontroversy. How the classification of Pluto has evolved is an\ninteresting story in science. 268 | 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nPluto\nFrom the time it was discovered in 1930 until the early 2000s, Pluto\nwas considered the ninth planet. When astronomers first located\nPluto, the telescopes were not as good as they are today. Back then,\nastronomers believe Pluto and its moon, Charon, were one large\nobject. With better telescopes, astronomers realized that Pluto was\nmuch smaller than they had initially been thought. Better\ntechnology also allowed astronomers to discover many smaller\nobjects like Pluto that orbit the Sun. One of them, Eris, discovered\nin 2005, is even larger than Pluto.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Unlike\nthe other outer planets in the solar system, which are all gas giants,\nit is small, icy, and rocky. With a diameter of about 2,400 km, it is\nonly about one-fifth the mass of Earth\u2019s Moon. Pluto\u2019s orbit is tilted\nrelative to the other planets and is shaped like a long, narrow ellipse.\nPluto\u2019s orbit sometimes even passes inside Neptune\u2019s orbit.\nIn 1992 Pluto\u2019s orbit was recognized to be part of the Kuiper Belt.\nWith more than 200 million Kuiper belt objects, Pluto has failed the\ntest of clearing other bodies out its orbit. In 2006, the International\nAstronomical Union decided that there were too many questions\nsurrounding what could be called a planet and so refined its\ndefinition.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=135 270 | 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nAccording to the new definition, a planet must:\n\u2022 Orbit a star\n\u2022 Be big enough that its gravity causes it to be shaped like a\nsphere.\n\u2022 Be small enough that it is not a star itself.\n\u2022 Have cleared the area of its orbit of smaller objects.\n\u2022 A dwarf planet is an object that meets items the first three\nitems in the list above, but not the fourth. Pluto is now called\na dwarf planet, along with the objects Ceres, Make-make, and\nEris.\nAccording to the IAU, a dwarf planet must:\n\u2022 Orbit a star\n\u2022 Have enough mass to be nearly spherical\n\u2022 Not have cleared the area around its orbit of smaller objects.\n\u2022 Not be a moon\nPluto has three moons of its own. The largest, Charon, is big enough\nthat the Pluto-Charon system is sometimes considered to be a\ndouble dwarf planet. Two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were\ndiscovered in 2005. However, having moons is not enough to make\nan object a planet. 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 271\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=135\nCeres\nCeres is the most massive object in the asteroid belt. Before 2006,\nCeres was considered the largest of the asteroids, with only about\n1.3 percent of the mass of the Earth\u2019s Moon. However, unlike the\nasteroids, Ceres has enough mass that its gravity causes it to be\nshaped like a sphere. Like Pluto, Ceres is rocky. Ceres orbits the Sun,\nis round, and is not a moon. As part of the asteroid belt, its orbit\nis full of other smaller bodies, so Ceres fails the fourth criterion for\nbeing a planet. 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM | 273\nMakemake\nMakemake is the third largest and second brightest dwarf planet\nwe have discovered so far. With a diameter estimated to be between\n1,300 and 1,900 km, it is about three-quarters the size of Pluto.\nMakemake orbits the Sun in 310 years at a distance between 38.5 to\n53 AU. It is thought to be made of methane, ethane, and nitrogen\nices.\nEris\nEris is the most widely-known dwarf planet in the solar system,\nwhich is roughly 27 percent more massive than Pluto. The object\nwas not discovered until 2003 because it is about three times farther\nfrom the Sun than Pluto, and almost 100 times farther from the\nSun than Earth is. For a short time, Eris was considered the \u201ctenth\nplanet\u201d in the solar system, but its discovery helped to prompt\nastronomers to better define planets and dwarf planets in 2006. Eris\nalso has a small moon, Dysnomia, that orbits it once about every 16\ndays.\nAstronomers know there may be other dwarf planets in the outer\nreaches of the solar system. Haumea was made a dwarf planet in\n2008, and so now the total is five. Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus may\nbe added to the list of dwarf planets in the future. We still have a lot\nto discover and explore. 274 | 2.7 OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM\nExtent of the Solar System\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

However,\nmany features make Earth vastly different from the planets and any\nother planet that we know of so far.\nEarth is a sphere or, more correctly, an oblate spheroid, which is a\nsphere that is a bit squished down at the poles and bulges a bit at\nthe equator. Alternatively, to be more technical, the minor axis (the\ndiameter through the poles) is smaller than the major axis (the\ndiameter through the equator). When the earth is cut into equal\nhalves, each half is called a hemisphere. North of the equator in the\nnorthern hemisphere and south of the equator in the southern\nhemisphere. Eastern and western hemispheres are also designated.\nEven the ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round by observing\nthe arc shape of the shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse.\nThe Sun and the other planets of the solar system are also spherical.\nLarger satellites, those that have enough mass for their gravitational\nattraction to have made them round, are as well. 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY | 289\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Earth\u2019s magnetic field also has a\nnorth and south pole and a magnetic field that surrounds it. The\nmagnetic field arises from the convection of molten iron and nickel\nmetal in Earth\u2019s outer liquid iron core. Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nextends several thousand kilometers into space. The magnetic field\nshields the planet from harmful radiation from the Sun. 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY | 291\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

This imaginary\nline is called an axis. Earth spins around its axis, just as a top spins\naround its spindle. This spinning movement is called the Earth\u2019s\nrotation. While the Earth spins on its axis, it also orbits or revolves\naround the Sun, called a revolution.\nA pendulum set in motion will not change its motion, and so the\ndirection of its swinging should not change. However, Foucault\nobserved that his pendulum did seem to change direction. Since he 292 | 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY\nknew that the pendulum could not change its motion, he\nconcluded that the Earth, underneath the pendulum, was moving.\nAn observer in space will see that Earth requires 23 hours, 56\nminutes, and 4 seconds to make one complete rotation on its axis.\nHowever, because Earth moves around the Sun at the same time as\nrotating, the planet must turn just a bit more to reach the same\nplace relative to the Sun. Hence the length of a day on Earth is 24\nhours. At the equator, the Earth rotates at a speed of about 1,700\nkm per hour, but at the poles, the movement speed is nearly\nnothing.\n\u201cAxial Tilt Obliquity\u201d by Dennis Nilsson is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 3.0 Unported. 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY | 293\nEarth\u2019s Revolution\nFor Earth to make one complete revolution around the Sun takes\n365.24 days. This amount of time is the definition of one year. The\ngravitational pull of the Sun keeps Earth and the other planets in\norbit around the star. Like the other planets, Earth\u2019s orbital path is\nan ellipse, so the planet is sometimes farther away from the Sun\nthan at other times. The closest Earth gets to the Sun each year is at\nperihelion (147 million km) on about January 3, and the furthest\nis at aphelion (152 million km) on July 4. Earth\u2019s elliptical orbit has\nnothing to do with Earth\u2019s seasons.\nDuring one revolution around the Sun, Earth travels at an average\ndistance of about 150 million km. Earth revolves around the Sun at\nan average speed of about 27 km (17 mi) per second, but the speed\nis not constant. The planet moves slower when it is at aphelion and\nfaster when it is at perihelion.\nSeasons\nThe reason the Earth has seasons is that Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees\non its axis, along with Earth\u2019s daily rotation and annual revolution\naround the sun. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, the\nNorth Pole points toward the Sun, and in the Northern\nHemisphere winter, the North Pole has tilted away from the Sun. 294 | 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY\n\u201cNorth Season\u201d by Tau\u02bbolunga is licensed under the Creative\nCommons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication.\nThe Tropic of Cancer is the parallel at 23.5 degrees north of the\nequator, which is the most northerly place on Earth, receiving\ndirect sunlight during the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s summer.\nRemember that the earth is tilted 23.5 degrees, which accounts for\nseasonal variations in climate. The Tropic of Capricorn is the\nparallel at 23.5 degrees south of the equator and is the most\nsoutherly location on Earth, receiving direct sunlight during the\nSouthern Hemisphere\u2019s summer.\nThe tropics (Cancer and Capricorn) are the two imaginary lines\ndirectly above which the sun shines on the two solstices, which\noccur on or near June 20 or 21 (summer solstice in the Northern\nHemisphere) and December 21 or 22 (winter solstice in the\nNorthern Hemisphere). The sun is directly above the Tropic of\nCancer at noon on June 20 or 21, marking the beginning of\nsummer in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of winter\nin the Southern Hemisphere. The sun is directly above the Tropic 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY | 295\nof Capricorn at noon on December 21 or 22, marking the\nbeginning of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the\nbeginning of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.

The\nregion between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn is known as\nthe tropics.

During winter, the North Pole is away\nfrom the sun and does not receive much sunlight. At times, it is\ndark for most of the twenty-four-hour day.

It is the farthest location south that receives\nsunlight during the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere (90\nS \u2212 23.5 = 66.5 S). When it is winter in the north, it is summer in\nthe south.\nThe Arctic and Antarctic Circles mark the extremities (southern\nand northern, respectively) of the polar day (twenty-four-hour\nsunlit day) and the polar night (24-hour sunless night). North of\nthe Arctic Circle, the sun is above the horizon for twenty-four\ncontinuous hours at least once per year and below the horizon for\ntwenty-four continuous hours per year. This is true also near the\nAntarctic Circle, but it occurs south of the Antarctic Circle, toward\nthe South Pole. Equinoxes, when the line of direct sunlight hits the\nequator and days and nights are of equal length, occur in the spring\nand fall on or around March 20 or 21 and September 22 or 23. 3.1 EARTH AS A PLANETARY BODY | 297\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Humankind has insufficient\nfirst-hand information regarding what is below; most of what we\nknow is pieced together from models, seismic waves, and\nassumptions based on meteorite material. In general, the Earth can\nbe divided into layers based on chemical composition and physical\ncharacteristics. (2 Plate Tectonics \u2013 An Introduction to Geology,\nn.d.) 312 | 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nLower Mantle\n\u201cEarth and Atmosphere Cutaway\u201d by the USGS is licensed under\nPublic Domain.\nChemical Layers\nThe Earth has three main divisions based on their chemical\ncomposition, which means chemical makeup. Indeed, there are\ncountless variations in composition throughout the Earth, but only\ntwo significant changes take place, leading to three distinct chemical\nlayers. 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH | 313\nIce cap Asthenosphere \u201cDiagram\nRigid mantle\nCrust earth of Earth\u201d\nContinental crust (granitic) is licensed\nOceanic crust (basaltic)\nStiffer mantle drawn to scale under the\nOuter core\n(liquid) Creative\nCommons\nInner core\n(solid) Attribution\n-ShareAlik\ne 3.0\nAtmosphere\nUnported\nContinent Hydrosphere\nOcean license.\nCrust\nThe outermost chemical layer and the layer humans currently reside\non is known as the crust. The crust has two types: continental\ncrust, which is relatively low density and has a composition similar\nto granite, and oceanic crust, which is relatively high density\n(especially when it is cold and old) and has a composition similar to\nbasalt. In the lower part of the crust, rocks start to be more ductile\nand less brittle, because of added heat. Earthquakes, therefore,\ngenerally occur in the upper crust.\nAt the base of the crust is a substantial change in seismic velocity\ncalled the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 Discontinuity, or Moho for short,\ndiscovered by Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 (pronounced mo-ho-ro-vee-\ncheech) in 1909 by studying earthquake wave paths in his native\nCroatia. It is caused by the dramatic change in composition that\noccurs between the mantle and the crust. Underneath the oceans,\nthe Moho is about 5 km down. Under continents, the average is\nabout 30-40 km, except near a sizeable mountain-building event,\nknown as an orogeny, where that thickness is about doubled. 314 | 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nMantle\nThe mantle is the layer below the crust and above the core. It is the\nmost substantial layer by volume, extending from the base of the\ncrust to a depth of about 2900 km. Most of what we know about\nthe mantle comes from seismic waves, though some direct\ninformation can be gathered from parts of the ocean floor that are\nbrought to the surface, known as ophiolites. Also, carried within\nmagma are xenoliths, which are small chunks of lower rock carried\nto the surface by eruptions. These xenoliths are made of the rock\nperidotite, which on the scale of igneous rocks is ultramafic. We\nassume the majority of the mantle is made of peridotite.\nCore\nThe core of the Earth, which has both liquid and solid\ncomponents, is made mostly of iron, nickel, and oxygen. First\ndiscovered in 1906 by looking into seismic data, it took the union of\nmodeling, astronomical insight, and seismic data to arrive at the\nidea that the core is mostly metallic iron. Meteorites contain much\nmore iron than typical surface rocks, and if meteoric material is\nwhat made the Earth, the core would have formed as dense material\n(including iron and nickel) sank to the center of the Earth via its\nweight as the planet formed, heating the Earth intensely.\nPhysical Layers\nThe Earth can also be broken down into five distinct physical layers\nbased on how each layer responds to stress. While there is some 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH | 315\noverlap in the chemical and physical designations of layers, precisely\nthe core-mantle boundary, there are significant differences between\nthe two systems.

Including the crust, it has both an\noceanic component and a continental component. Oceanic\nlithosphere, ranging from a thickness of zero (at the forming of\nnew plates on the mid-ocean ridge) to 140 km, is thin and rigid.\nThe continental lithosphere is more plastic (especially with\ndepth) and is overall thicker, from 40 to 280 km thick. Most\nimportantly, the lithosphere is not continuous. It is broken into\nseveral segments that geologists call plates. A plate boundary is\nwhere two plates meet and move relative to each other. It is at and 316 | 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nnear plate boundaries where plate tectonics\u2019 real action is seen,\nincluding mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanism.\nAsthenosphere\nThe asthenosphere, with \u2018astheno\u2019 meaning weak, is the layer\nbelow the lithosphere. The most distinctive property of the\nasthenosphere is movement. While still solid, over geologic time\nscales, it will flow and move because it is mechanically weak. In this\nlayer, partly driven by convection of intense interior heat,\nmovement allows the lithospheric plates to move. Since certain\ntypes of seismic waves pass through the asthenosphere, we know\nthat it is solid, at least at the short time scales of the passage of\nseismic waves. The depth and occurrence of the asthenosphere are\ndependent on heat and can be very shallow at mid-ocean ridges and\nvery deep in plate interiors and beneath mountains.\nMesosphere\nThe mesosphere, or lower mantle as it is sometimes called, is more\nrigid and immobile than the asthenosphere, though still hot. This\ncan be attributed to increased pressure with depth. Between\napproximately 410 and 660 km depth, the mantle is in a state of\ntransition, as minerals with the same composition are changed to\nvarious forms, dictated by increasing pressure conditions. Changes\nin seismic velocity show this, and this zone also can be a physical\nbarrier to movement. Below this zone, the mantle is uniform and\nhomogeneous, as no significant changes occur until the core is\nreached. 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH | 317\nThe outer core is the only liquid layer found within Earth. It starts\nat 2,890 km (1,795 mi) depth and extends to 5,150 km (3,200 mi).\nInge Lehmann, a Danish geophysicist, in 1936, was the first to\nprove that there was an inner core that was solid within the liquid\nouter core based on analyzing seismic data. The solid inner core is\nabout 1,220 km (758 mi) thick, and the outer core is about 2,300\nkm (1,429 mi) thick.\nIt seems like a contradiction that the hottest part of the Earth is\nsubstantial, as hot temperatures usually lead to melting or boiling.\nThe solid inner core can be explained by understanding that the\nimmense pressure inhibits melting, though as the Earth cools by\nheat flowing outward, the inner core grows slightly larger over time.\nAs the liquid iron and nickel in the outer core moves and convects,\nit becomes the most likely source for Earth\u2019s magnetic field. This is\ncritically important to maintaining the atmosphere and conditions\non Earth that make it favor-able to life. Loss of outer core\nconvection and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field could strip the\natmosphere of most of the gases essential to life and dry out the\nplanet, much like what has happened to Mars. 318 | 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nIce cap Asthenosphere\nRigid mantle\nearth\nCrust\nContinental crust (granitic)\nOceanic crust (basaltic)\ndrawn to scale\nStiffer mantle\nOuter core\n(liquid)\nInner core\n(solid)\nAtmosphere\nContinent Hydrosphere\nOcean\n\u201cStructure of Earth\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.\nStructure of Earth\u2019s Crust\nThe fundamental unifying principle of geology and the rock cycle is\nthe theory of Plate Tectonics. Plate tectonics describes how the\nlayers of the Earth move relative to each other. Specifically, the outer\nlayer divided into tectonic or lithospheric plates. As the tectonic\nplates float on a mobile layer beneath called the asthenosphere, they\ncollide, slide past each other, and split apart. Significant landforms\nare created at these plate boundaries, and rocks making up the\ntectonic plates move through the rock cycle.\nThe following is a summary of the Earth\u2019s layers based on chemical\ncomposition (or the chemical makeup of the layers). Earth has three\nmain geological layers based on chemical composition \u2013 crust,\nmantle, and core. The outermost layer is the crust and is composed 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH | 319\nof mostly silicon, oxygen, aluminum, iron, and magnesium. There\nare two types of crust, continental and oceanic crust. Continental\ncrust is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) thick, represents most of the\ncontinents, and is composed of low-density igneous and\nsedimentary rocks. Oceanic crust is approximately 10 kilometers (6\nmiles) thick, makes up most of the ocean floor, and covers about 70\npercent of the planet. Oceanic crust is high-density igneous basalt-\ntype rocks. The moving tectonic plates are made of crust, and some\nof the next layers within the earth called the mantle. The crust and\nthis portion of the upper mantle are rigid and called the\nlithosphere and make up the tectonic plates.\nContinents\nThe oldest continental rocks are billions of years old, so the\ncontinents have had much time to happen to them. Constructive\nforces cause physical features on Earth\u2019s surface known as\nlandforms to grow. Crustal deformation \u2013 when crust\ncompresses, pulls apart, or slides past other crust \u2013 results in hills,\nvalleys, and other landforms. Mountains rise when continents\ncollide when one slab of ocean crust plunges beneath another or a\nslab of continental crust to create a chain of volcanoes. Sediments\nare deposited to form landforms, such as deltas. Volcanic eruptions\ncan also be destructive forces that blow landforms apart. The\ndestructive forces of weathering and erosion modify landforms.\nWater, wind, ice, and gravity are essential forces of erosion. 320 | 3.3 INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF EARTH\nOceanic Basins\nThe ocean basins are all younger than 180 million years. Although\nthe ocean basins begin where the ocean meets the land, the\ncontinent extends downward to the seafloor, so the continental\nmargin is made of continental crust.\nThe ocean floor itself is not flat. The most distinctive feature is the\nmountain range that runs through much of the ocean basin, known\nas the mid-ocean ridge. The ocean trenches are the deepest places of\nthe ocean, many of which are found around the edge of the Pacific\nOcean. Chains of volcanoes are also found in the center of the\noceans, such as around Hawaii. Flat plains are found on the ocean\nfloor with their features covered by mud.\n\u201cElevation\u201d is NOAA is licensed\nas Public Domain. 3.4 MINERALS\nAtoms and Isotopes\nA chemical element is a substance that cannot be made into a more\nstraightforward form by ordinary chemical means the smallest unit\nof a chemical element is an atom. An atom has all the properties\nof that element. At the center of an atom is a nucleus made up\nof subatomic particles called protons and neutrons. Protons have\na positive electrical charge. The number of protons in the nucleus\ndetermines what element the atom is. Neutrons are about the size\nof protons but have no charge. Electrons, each having a negative\nelectrical charge, orbit the nucleus at varying energy levels in a region\nknown as the electron cloud. 322 | 3.4 MINERALS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

All atoms of a given element always have the same\nnumber of protons but may differ in the number of neutrons\nfound in its nucleus. Atoms of an element with differing numbers\nof neutrons are called isotopes.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=279\nIons and Molecules\nAtoms are stable when they have a full outermost electron valence\nshell. For an atom to fill its outermost shell, it will give, take, or\nshare electrons. When an atom either gains or loses electrons, this\ncreates an ion. Ions have either a positive or a negative electrical\ncharge. What is the charge of an ion if the atom loses an electron?\nAn atom with the same number of protons and electrons has no\noverall charge, so if an atom loses the negatively charged electron, it\nhas a positive charge. What is the charge of an ion if the atom gains\nan electron? If the atom gains an electron, it has a negative charge. 324 | 3.4 MINERALS\nWhen atoms chemically bond, they form compounds. The\nsmallest unit of a compound with all the properties of that\ncompound is a molecule. When two or more atoms share electrons\nto form a chemical bond, they form a molecule. The molecular\nmass is the sum of the masses of all the atoms in the molecule.\nChemical Bonding\nIons come together to create a molecule so that electrical charges\nare balanced; the positive charges balance the negative charges, and\nthe molecule has no electrical charge. An atom will balance its\nelectrical charge by sharing an electron with another atom, giving it\naway, or receive an electron from another atom.\nThe joining of ions to make molecules is chemical bonding. There\nare three main types of chemical bonds. Ionic bonds occur when\nelectrons are transferred between atoms. Covalent bonds occur\nwhen an atom shares one or more electrons with another atom. The\nsharing of electrons is not always evenly distributed within a\nmolecule. If one atom has the electrons more often than another\natom in the molecule, it has a positive and a negative side. It is a\npolar molecule because it acts a little bit as if it had poles, like a\nmagnet. Finally, hydrogen bonds are weak intermolecular bonds\nthat form when the positive side of one polar molecule is attracted\nto another polar molecule\u2019s negative side. 3.4 MINERALS | 325\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Turquoise is prized for its striking\ngreenish-blue color. Notice that specific terms are being used to\ndescribe the appearance of minerals. Color is rarely useful for\nidentifying a mineral.\nStreak\nStreak is the color of a mineral\u2019s powder. Streak is a more reliable 330 | 3.4 MINERALS\nproperty than color because streak does not vary. Minerals that are\nthe same color may have a different colored streak. Many minerals,\nsuch as the quartz, do not have a streak. To check streak, scrape the\nmineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. Yellow-gold pyrite has a\nblackish streak, another indicator that pyrite is not gold, with a\ngolden yellow streak.\nLuster\nLuster describes the reflection of light off a mineral\u2019s surface.\nMineralogists have specific terms to describe luster. One\nstraightforward way to classify luster is based on whether the\nmineral is metallic or non-metallic. Minerals that are opaque and\nshiny, such as pyrite, have a metallic luster. Minerals such as quartz\nhave a non-metallic luster.\nSpecific Gravity\nDensity describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space:\ndensity = mass\/volume. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter\nin an object. Its volume describes the amount of space an object\ntakes up. The density of an object depends on its mass and its\nvolume. For example, the water in a drinking glass has the same\ndensity as the water in the same volume of a swimming pool. Gold\nhas a density of about 19 g\/cm3; pyrite has a density of about 5 g\/\ncm3 \u2013 that is another way to tell pyrite from gold. Quartz is even\nless dense than pyrite and has a density of 2.7 g\/cm3. The specific\ngravity of a substance compares its density to that of water. Denser\nsubstances have higher specific gravity. 3.4 MINERALS | 331\nHardness\nHardness is a measure of whether a mineral will scratch or be\nscratched. Mohs Hardness Scale is a reference for mineral\nhardness. With a Mohs scale, anyone can evaluate an unknown\nmineral for its hardness. Imagine you have an unknown mineral.\nYou find that it can scratch fluorite or even apatite, but feldspar\nscratches it. This examination of the mineral informs you that the\nmineral\u2019s hardness is between 5 and 6. Note that no other mineral\ncan scratch diamond. Breaking a mineral breaks its chemical bonds.\nSince some bonds are weaker than other bonds, each type of\nmineral is likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are\nweakest. For that reason, minerals break apart in distinctive ways.\n(Mineral Identification | Earth Science, n.d.)\nCleavage\nCleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along specific planes\nto make smooth surfaces. Halite breaks between layers of sodium\nand chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces. One reason\ngemstone is beautiful is that the cleavage planes make an attractive\ncrystal shape with smooth faces. (Mineral Identification | Earth\nScience, n.d.)\nFracture\nFracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane.\nFracture is not always the same in the same mineral because its\nstructure does not determine fracture. Minerals may have natural 332 | 3.4 MINERALS\nfractures. Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If a mineral\nsplinter like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz,\nform smooth curved surfaces when they fracture.

Minerals can form from volcanic gases,\nsediment formation, oxidation, crystallization from magma, or\ndeposition from a saline fluid. (Reading: Physical Characteristics of\nMinerals | Geology, n.d.)\nFormation from Hot Material\nA rock is a collection of minerals. Imagine a rock that becomes so\nhot it melts. Many minerals start in liquids that are hot enough to\nmelt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of\nsubstances that can be hotter than 1,000oC. Magma cools slowly\ninside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough\nto be seen clearly. When magma erupts onto Earth\u2019s surface, it is\ncalled lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma when it is\nbelow the surface. In cooling lava, mineral crystals do not have time\nto form and are exceedingly small. The chemical composition will\nbe the same as if the magma cooled slowly. Existing rocks may be\nheated enough to release the molecules from their structure and\nmove around. The molecules may match up with different\nmolecules to form new minerals as the rock cools, a process called\nmetamorphism. (Matter Matters | Earth Science, n.d.)\nFormation from Solutions\nWater on Earth, such as the water in the oceans, contains chemical\nelements mixed into a solution. Various processes can cause these\nelements to combine to form solid mineral deposits. 334 | 3.4 MINERALS\nMinerals from Salt Water\nWhen water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid precipitate of\nminerals. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved\nminerals and salts. When the amount is too vast to stay dissolved in\nthe water, the particles come together to form mineral solids, which\nsink. Halite readily precipitates out of the water, as does calcite.\nSome lakes, such as Mono Lake in California or The Great Salt\nLake in Utah, contain many mineral precipitates.\nMinerals from Hot Underground\nWater\nMagma heats nearby underground water, which reacts with the\nrocks around it to pick up dissolved particles. As the water flows\nthrough open spaces in the rock and cools, it deposits solid\nminerals. The mineral deposits form when a mineral fills cracks in\nrocks are called veins when minerals are deposited in open spaces\nand large crystal forms.\nMining and Mineral Use\nSome minerals are beneficial. An ore is a rock that contains minerals\nwith useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore is extracted from\nthe ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other\nproducts. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends\non how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and\nrefining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes 3.4 MINERALS | 335\nis often not figured into a product\u2019s cost. It is crucial to use mineral\nresources wisely.\nFinding and Mining Minerals\nGeologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable\nnatural resources. Geologists study geological formations and test\nthe physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate\npossible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral\ndeposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of\nminerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine.\nThere are many ways to mine ores. (Reading: Mining and Mineral\nUse | Geology, n.d.)\nSurface mining allows the extraction of ores that are close to\nEarth\u2019s surface. Overlying rock is blasted, and the rock that contains\nthe valuable minerals is placed in a truck and taken to a refinery.\nSurface mining includes open-pit mining and mountaintop\nremoval. Other methods of surface mining include strip mining,\nplacer mining, and dredging. Strip mining is like open-pit mining\nbut with material removed along a strip.\nPlacers are valuable minerals found in stream gravels. California\u2019s\nnickname, the Golden State, can be traced to the discovery of placer\ndeposits of gold in 1848. The gold weathered out of hard\nmetamorphic rock in the western Sierra Nevada, which also\ncontains deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, chromite, and other\nvaluable minerals. The gold traveled down rivers and then settled in\ngravel deposits. Currently, California has active mines for gold and\nsilver and for non-metal minerals such as sand and gravel, which are 336 | 3.4 MINERALS\nused for construction. (Reading: Mining and Mineral Use |\nGeology, n.d.)\n\u201cBingham Copper Mine\u201d by David Guthrie is licensed under\nCreative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic.\nUnderground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into\nEarth\u2019s surface. Miners blast and tunnel into the rock to gain access\nto the ores. How underground mining is approached depends on\nthe placement of the ore body, its depth, concentration of ore, and\nthe surrounding rock\u2019s strength. Underground mining is costly and\ndangerous. Fresh air and lights must also be brought into the\ntunnels for the miners, and accidents are far too frequent.\nThe ore\u2019s journey to becoming a useable material is only just\nbeginning when the ore leaves the mine. Rocks are crushed so that\nthe valuable minerals can be separated from the waste rock. Then\nthe minerals are separated from the ore. A few methods for\nextracting ore are: 3.4 MINERALS | 337\n\u2022 Heap leaching: the addition of chemicals, such as cyanide or\nacid, to remove ore.\n\u2022 Flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the\nvaluable mineral and floats.\n\u2022 Smelting: roasting rock, causing it to segregate into layers so\nthe mineral can be extracted.\nTo extract the metal from the ore, the rock is melted at a\ntemperature higher than 900 degrees Celsius, which requires much\nenergy. Extracting a metal from the rock is so energy-intensive that\nrecycling just 40 aluminum cans will save the energy equivalent of\none gallon of gasoline. (Mining and Mineral Use | Earth Science,\nn.d.)\nAlthough mining provides people with many necessary resources,\nenvironmental costs can be high. Surface mining clears the\nlandscape of trees and soil, and nearby streams and lakes are\ninundated with sediment. Pollutants from the mined rock, such as\nheavy metals, enter the sediment and water system. Acids flow from\nsome mine sites, changing the composition of nearby waterways.\nU.S. law has changed so that in recent decades a mine region must\nbe restored to its natural state, a process called reclamation. This is\nnot true of older mines. Pits may be refilled or reshaped, and\nvegetation planted. Pits may be allowed to fill with water and\nbecome lakes or maybe turned into landfills. Underground mines\nmay be sealed off or left open as homes for bats.\nSome minerals are valuable because they are beautiful. Jade has\nbeen used for thousands of years in China. Diamonds sparkle on\nmany engagement rings. Minerals like jade, turquoise, diamonds, 338 | 3.4 MINERALS\nand emeralds are gemstones. A gemstone, or gem, is a material that\nis cut and polished for jewelry. Gemstones are usually rare and do\nnot break or scratch easily. Most are cut along cleavage faces and\nthen polished so that light bounces back off the cleavage planes.\nLight does not pass through opaque gemstones, such as turquoise.\nGemstones are not just used in jewelry. Diamonds are used to cut\nand polish other materials, such as glass and metals because they are\nso hard. The mineral corundum, of which ruby and sapphire are\nvarieties, is used in sandpaper products.\nMinerals are used in much less obvious places. The mineral gypsum\nis used for the sheetrock in homes. Window glass is made from\nsand, which is mostly quartz. Halite is mined for rock salt. Copper\nis used in electrical wiring, and bauxite is the source of the\naluminum used in soda cans. (Reading: Mining and Mineral Use |\nGeology, n.d.)\nConflict Resouces\nBlood Diamonds\nBlood diamonds, also called conflict diamonds, are diamonds\nmined in conflict areas and sold to finance warlords or invading\narmies in a geographic region. The term \u201cblood\u201d diamonds are used\nto highlight the negative impacts and consequences of diamonds\nmined for these ends. Often, women and children are enslaved to\nmine blood diamonds, and other conflict resources, to fund these\nlocal and regional wars. The Kimberley Process was created to help\ncombat and regulate the flow of diamonds mined around the world 3.4 MINERALS | 339\nto ensure that people were not purchasing blood diamonds. Blood\ndiamonds have been mined from Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra\nLeone, Liberia, Guinea, and Guinea Bissau.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

With\nthe advancement of technology (i.e. laptops, smartphones, tablets),\nthe need and demand for the mineral cobalt have grown rapidly. It\nis believed that Subsaharan Africa, specifically Central Africa, has\nroughly two-thirds of the world\u2019s cobalt. To meet the demand,\nwomen and children have been imprisoned to extract cobalt from 340 | 3.4 MINERALS\nthe mines.

Magma forms under the Earth\u2019s surface in\nthe crust or mantle and erupts on Earth\u2019s surface as lava. When\nmagma or lava cools, it solidifies by crystallization in which\nminerals grow within the magma or lava. The rock that results from\nthis is an igneous rock from the Latin word ignis, meaning \u201cfire.\u201d\n\u201cRock Cycle\u201d by Siyavula Education is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 2.0 Generic. 344 | 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE\nIgneous rocks, as well as other types of rocks on Earth\u2019s surface, are\nexposed to weathering and erosion processes to produce sediments.\nWeathering is the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks into\nsmaller fragments, and erosion is the removal of those fragments\nfrom their original location. Once igneous rocks are broken down\nand transported, these fragments or grains are considered\nsediments. Sediments such as gravel, sand, silt, and clay can be\ntransported by water in the form of streams, ice in the form of\nglaciers, and air in the form of wind. Sediments ultimately come to\nrest in a process known as deposition. The deposited sediments\naccumulate in place, often underwater such as a shallow marine\nenvironment, get buried.\nWithin the burial process, the sediments go through compaction by\nthe weight of overlying sediments and cementation as minerals in\ngroundwater glue the sediments together. The process of\ncompacting and cementing sediments together is lithification, and\nlithified sediments are considered a sedimentary rock, such as\nsandstone and shale. Other sedimentary rocks, known as chemical\nsedimentary rocks, are not made of weathered and eroded\nsedimentary fragments. The direct chemical precipitation instead\nmakes them of minerals.\nPre-existing rocks may be metamorphosed into a metamorphic\nrock, meta- means \u201cchange\u201d, -morphos means \u201cform\u201d or \u201cshape.\u201d\nWhen rocks are subjected to extreme increases in temperatures or\npressures, the minerals alter into enlarged crystals, or entirely new\nminerals with a similar chemical make up. These elevated\ntemperatures and pressures can occur when rocks are buried deep\nwithin the Earth\u2019s crust, or they encounter hot magma or lava. In 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 345\nsome cases, the temperature and pressure conditions can allow\nrocks to melt and create magma and lava, showing the cyclical\nnature of the rock cycle as new rocks are born.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=281\nIgneous Rocks\nIgneous rocks form from the cooling and hardening of molten\nmagma in many different environments. Their composition and\ntexture identify these rocks. More than 700 distinct types of\nigneous rocks are known. 346 | 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE\n\u201cSarychev Peak Eruption, Kuril Islands\u201d by NASA\u2019s Earth\nObservatory is licensed under Public Domain.\nMagma Composition\nThe rock beneath the Earth\u2019s surface is sometimes heated to high\nenough temperatures that it melts to create magma. Different\nmagmas have a different composition and contain whatever\nelements were in the rock that melted. Magma also contains gases.\n(Reading: Types of Rocks | Geology, n.d.) The main elements are\nthe same as the elements found in the crust. Whether rock melts to\ncreate magma depends on:\n\u2022 Temperature: Temperature increases with depth, so melting\nis more likely to occur at greater depths.\n\u2022 Pressure: Pressure increases with depth, but increased\npressure raises the melting temperature, so melting is less likely\nto occur at higher pressures. 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 347\n\u2022 Water: The addition of water changes the melting point of\nrock. As the number of water molecules increases, the melting\npoint decreases.\n\u2022 Rock composition: Minerals melt at different temperatures,\nso the temperature must be high enough to melt some\nminerals in the rock. The first mineral to melt from a rock will\nbe quartz (if present), and the last will be olivine (if present).\nAs a rock heats up, the minerals that melt at the lowest\ntemperatures will melt first. Partial melting occurs when the\ntemperature on a rock is high enough to melt only some of the\nminerals in the rock. The minerals that will melt will be those that\nmelt at lower temperatures. Fractional crystallization is the opposite\nof partial melting. This process describes the crystallization of\ndifferent minerals as magma cools. (Igneous Rocks | Geology, n.d.)\nBowen\u2019s Reaction Series indicates the temperatures at which\nminerals melt or crystallize. An understanding of the way atoms\njoins to form minerals leads to an understanding of how different\nigneous rocks form. Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series also explains why\nsome minerals are always found together, and some are never found\ntogether.\nIf the liquid separates from the solids at any time in partial melting\nor fractional crystallization, the liquid and solid chemical\ncomposition will be different. When that liquid crystallizes, the\nresulting igneous rock will have a different composition from the\nparent rock. (Reading: Types of Rocks | Geology, n.d.) 348 | 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE\nIntrusive Igneous Rock\nIgneous rocks are called intrusive when they cool and solidify\nbeneath the surface. Intrusive igneous rocks form plutons, and so\nare also called plutonic. A pluton is an igneous intrusive rock body\nthat has cooled in the crust. When magma cools within the Earth,\nthe cooling proceeds slowly. Intrusive igneous rocks cool slower\nthan extrusive igneous rocks, which allows for more massive crystal\nstructure to develop.\nIgneous rocks make up most of the rocks on Earth. Most igneous\nrocks are buried below the surface and covered with sedimentary\nrocks or are buried beneath the ocean water. In some places,\ngeological processes have brought igneous rocks to the surface.\nYosemite is a classic example of intrusive igneous rock. The molten\nmagma never reached Earth\u2019s surface, so the molten material had\nmillions of years to cool down slowly to form granite. Later,\ngeologic forces and erosion have caused those granite plutons to\nsurface as they are today.\nExtrusive Igneous Rock\nIgneous rocks are called extrusive when they cool and solidify\nabove the surface. These rocks usually form from a volcano, so they\nare also called volcanic rocks. Extrusive igneous rocks cool much\nmore rapidly than intrusive rocks, reducing the time for crystal\nstructure to form within the rocks.\nCooling rate and gas content create a variety of rock textures. Lavas\nthat cool exceptionally rapidly may have a glassy texture. Those 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 349\nwith many holes from gas bubbles have a vesicular texture.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=281\nHuman Uses of Igneous Rock\nIgneous rocks have a wide variety of uses, including to create\nbuildings and statues, kitchen countertops, abrasive material for\nhousehold products, or for smoothing skin. Ground-up pumice\nstone is sometimes added to toothpaste to function as an abrasive\nmaterial to scrub teeth. Peridotite is sometimes mined for peridot, a\ntype of olivine that is used in jewelry. Diorite was used extensively 350 | 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE\nby ancient civilizations for vases and other decorative artwork and is\nstill used for art today.\nSedimentary Rock\nSandstone is one of the common types of sedimentary rocks that\nform from sediments. There are many other types. Sediments may\ninclude:\n\u2022 Fragments of other rocks that often have been worn down\ninto small pieces, such as sand, silt, or clay.\n\u2022 Organic materials, or the remains of once-living organisms.\n\u2022 Chemical precipitates, which are materials that get left behind\nafter the water evaporates from a solution.\nRocks at the surface undergo mechanical and chemical weathering.\nThese physical and chemical processes break the rock into smaller\npieces. Physical weathering breaks the rocks apart, while\nchemical weathering dissolves the less stable minerals. These\noriginal elements of the minerals end up in solution, and new\nminerals may form. Sediments are removed and transported by\nwater, wind, ice, or gravity in a process called erosion. 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 351\n\u201cBryce\nCanyon at\nSunset\u201d by\nR. Adam\nDastrup is\ncopywritte\nn.\nStreams carry vast amounts of sediment. The more energy the water\nhas, the larger the particle it can carry. A rushing river on a steep\nslope might be able to carry boulders. As this stream slows down, it\nno longer has the energy to carry large sediments and will drop\nthem. A slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles.\nSediments are deposited on beaches and deserts, at the bottom of\noceans, and in lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, and swamps. Fast-\nmoving avalanches and slow-moving glaciers can drop large piles of\nsediment. Wind can only transport sand and smaller particles. The\ntype of sediment that is deposited will determine the type of\nsedimentary rock that can form. Distinct colors of sedimentary rock\nare determined by the environment where they are deposited. Red\nrocks form where oxygen is present, while darker sediments form\nwhen the environment is oxygen-poor.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=281\nSedimentary Rock Formation\nAccumulated sediments harden into a rock by a process called\nlithification. Two essential steps are needed for sediments to\nlithify. Sediments are squeezed together by the weight of overlying\nsediments on top of them, called compaction. Cemented, non-\norganic sediments become clastic rocks. If organic material is\nincluded, they are bioclastic rocks.\nFluids fill in the spaces between the loose particles of sediment and\ncrystallize to create a rock by cementation. When sediments settle\nout of calmer water, they form horizontal layers. One layer is 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 353\ndeposited first, and another layer is deposited on top of it. So, each\nlayer is younger than the layer beneath it. When the sediments\nharden, the layers are preserved. Sedimentary rocks formed by the\ncrystallization of chemical precipitates are called chemical\nsedimentary rocks.\nBiochemical sedimentary rocks form in the ocean or a salt lake.\nLiving creatures remove ions, such as calcium, magnesium, and\npotassium, from the water to make shells or soft tissue. When the\norganism dies, it sinks to the ocean floor to become biochemical\nsediment, which may become compacted and cemented into solid\nrock. (Reading: Mining and Mineral Use | Geology, n.d.)\nHuman Use of Sedimentary Rock\nSedimentary rocks are used as building stones, although they are\nnot as hard as igneous or metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rocks are\nused in construction. Sand and gravel are used to make concrete;\nthey are also used in asphalt. Many economically valuable resources\ncome from sedimentary rocks. Iron ore and aluminum are two\nexamples. (Reading: Mining and Mineral Use | Geology, n.d.)\nMetamorphic Rock\nMetamorphism is the addition of heat and\/or pressure to existing\nrocks, which causes them to change physically and\/or chemically so\nthat they become a new rock. Metamorphic rocks may change so\nmuch that they may not resemble the original rock. 354 | 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE\nAny type of rock \u2013 igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic \u2013 can\nbecome a metamorphic rock. All that is needed is enough heat and\/\nor pressure to alter the existing rock\u2019s physical or chemical makeup\nwithout melting the rock entirely. Rocks change during\nmetamorphism be-cause the minerals need to be stable under the\nnew temperature and pressure conditions. The need for stability\nmay cause the structure of minerals to rearrange and form new\nminerals. Ions may move between minerals to create minerals of the\ndifferent chemical compositions. Hornfels, with its alternating\nbands of dark and light crystals, is an excellent example of how\nminerals rearrange themselves during metamorphism.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=281\nExtreme pressure may also lead to foliation, the flat layers that form 3.5 THE ROCK CYCLE | 355\nin rocks as pressure squeezes the rocks. Foliation forms typically\nwhen pressure is exerted in only one direction. Metamorphic rocks\nmay also be non-foliated. Quartzite and limestone are non-\nfoliated. The two main types of metamorphism are both related to\nheat within Earth:\n\u2022 Regional metamorphism: Changes in enormous quantities\nof rock over a wide area caused by extreme pressure from\noverlying rock or compression caused by geologic processes.\nDeep burial exposes the rock to hot temperatures.\n\u2022 Contact metamorphism: Changes in a rock that is in contact\nwith magma because of the magma\u2019s extreme heat.\nThe Utah Geologic Survey has several resources related to\nlandforms in Utah. They have also created a fun story map called\nGeoSights of popular geologic sights within the State of Utah. 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE\nTECTONICS\nContinental Drift Hypothesis\nAlfred Wegener (1880-1930) was a German scientist who\nspecialized in meteorology and climatology. He had a knack for\nquestioning accepted ideas, and this started in 1910 when he\ndisagreed with isostasy (vertical land movement due to the weight\nbeing removed or added) as the explanation for the Bering Land\nBridge. After literary reviews, he published a hypothesis stating the\ncontinents had moved in the past. While he did not have the precise\nmechanism worked out, he had an extensive list of evidence that\nbacked up his hypothesis of continental drift. 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 357\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=286\nEarly Evidence for Continental Drift\nThe first piece of evidence is that the shape of the coastlines of some\ncontinents fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Since the first\nworld map, people have noticed the similarities in the coastlines of\nSouth America and Africa, and the continents being ripped apart\nhad even been mentioned as an explanation. Antonio Snider-\nPellegrini even did preliminary work on continental separation and\nmatching fossils in 1858.\nWhat Wegener did differently than others was synthesized a\nsignificant amount of data in one place, as well as use the shape of 358 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nthe continental shelf, the actual edge of the continent, instead of\nthe current coastline, which fit even better than previous efforts.\nWegener also compiled and added to evidence of similar rocks,\nfossils, and glacial formations across the oceans.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=286\nFossil Evidence\nFor example, the primitive aquatic reptile Mesosaurus was found on\nthe separate coastlines of the continents of Africa and South\nAmerica, and the reptile Lystrosaurus was found on Africa, India,\nand Antarctica. These were land-dwelling creatures that could not\nhave swam across an entire ocean; thus, this was explained away by 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 359\nopponents of continental drift by land bridges. The land bridges\nhad eroded, allowed animals and plants to move between the\ncontinents. However, some of the presumed land bridges would\nhave had to have stretched across broad, deep oceans.\nAFRICA Fossil evidence\nof the Triassic\nINDIA land reptile\nLystrosaurus.\nSOUTH AMERICA\nAUSTRALIA\nANTARCTICA\nFossil remains of Fossils of the fern\nCynognathus, a Fossil remains of the Glossopteris, found in\nTriassic land reptile freshwater reptile all of the southem\napproximately Mesosaurus. continents, show that\n3m long. they were once joined.\n\u201cSnider-Pellegrini Wegener Fossil Map\u201d is licensed under Public\nDomain.\nGeologic Evidence\nMountain ranges with the same rock types, structures, and ages are\nnow on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The Appalachians of\nthe eastern United States and Canada, for example, are just like\nmountain ranges in eastern Greenland, Ireland, Great Britain, and\nNorway. Wegener concluded that they formed a single mountain\nrange that was separated as the continents drifted. (Dastrup, 2014) 360 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nClimatic Evidence\nAnother significant piece of evidence was climate anomalies. Late\nPaleozoic glacial evidence was found in widespread, warm areas like\nsouthern Africa, India, Australia, and the Arabian subcontinent.\nWegener himself had found evidence of tropical plant fossils in\nareas north of the Arctic Circle. According to Wegener, the more\nstraightforward explanation that fits all the climate, rock, and fossil\nobservations, mainly as more data were collected, involved moving\ncontinents.\nGrooves and rock deposits left by ancient glaciers are found today\non different continents close to the equator. This would indicate\nthat the glaciers either formed in the middle of the ocean or covered\nmost of the Earth. Today glaciers only form on land and nearer the\npoles. Wegener thought that the glaciers were centered over the\nsouthern landmass close to the South Pole, and the continents later\nmoved to their present positions.\nProposed Mechanism for\nContinental Drift\nWegener\u2019s work was considered a fringe theory for his entire life.\nOne of the most significant flaws and easiest dismissals of Wegener\u2019s\nhypothesis was a mechanism for the movement of the continents.\nThe continents did not appear to move, and extraordinary evidence\nwould need to be provided to change the establishment\u2019s minds,\nincluding a mechanism for movement. Other pro-continental drift\nfollowers had used expansion, contraction, or even the origin of the 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 361\nMoon as ideas to how the continents moved. Wegener used\ncentrifugal forces and precession to explain the movement, but that\nwas proven wrong. He had some speculation about seafloor\nspreading, with hints of convection within the earth, but these\nwere unsubstantiated. As it turns out, convection within the mantle\nhas been revealed as a significant force in driving plate movements,\naccording to current knowledge.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

He was\npoorly respected in his lifetime, and his ideas of moving continents 362 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nseemed destined to be lost to history as a fringe idea. However,\nstarting in the 1950s, evidence started to trickle in that made\ncontinental drift more viable. By the 1960s, there was enough\nevidence supporting Wegener\u2019s missing mechanism, seafloor\nspreading, allowing continental drift\u2019s hypothesis to develop into\nthe Theory of Plate Tectonics. Widespread acceptance among\nscientists has transformed Wegener\u2019s hypothesis to a Theory. Today,\nGPS and earthquake data continue to back up the theory. Below are\nthe pieces of evidence that allowed the transformation.\n\u201cTectonic Plates\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nMapping the Ocean Floors\nStarting in 1947 and using an adaptation of sonar, researchers\nbegan to map a poorly understood topographic and thermal high in\nthe mid-Atlantic. Bruce Heezen and Marie Tharp were the first to 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 363\nmake a detailed map of the ocean floor, and this map revealed the\nmid-Atlantic Ridge, a basaltic feature, unlike the continents.\nInitially, this was thought to be part of an expanding Earth or a\nmechanism for the ocean\u2019s growth. Transform faults were also\nadded to explain movements more completely. When it was later\nrealized that earthquake epicenters were also found within this\nfeature, the idea that this was part of the continental movement\ntook hold.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Scientists\nhad long known of strange magnetic anomalies (magnetic values\nthat differ from expected values) associated with the ocean floor.\nThis tool was adapted by geologists later for further study of the 364 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nocean depths, including strange alternating symmetrical stripes on\nboth sides of a feature (which would be discovered later as the mid-\nocean ridge) showing reversing magnetic pole directions. By 1963,\nthese magnetic stripes would be explained in concordance with\nHess\u2019s spreading model and others.\nSeafloor sediment was also an important feature that was\nmeasured in the oceans, both with dredging and with drilling.\nSediment was believed to have been piling up on ocean floors for an\nexceptionally long time in a static model of accumulation. Initial\nstudies showed less sediment than expected, and initial results were\neven used to argue against the continental movement. With more\ntime, researchers discovered thinner sediment close to ridges,\nindicating a younger age.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 365\nthe text.

A zone\nof deep earthquakes that lay along a plane, trending from the\nsurface near the trenches to inside the Earth beneath the continents\nand island arcs, were recognized independently by several scientists.\nToday called the Wadati-Benioff zone; it was an essential piece of\nthe puzzle.\nPaleomagnetism\nMagnetic field mapping, as mentioned above, was not the only way\nmagnetism was used in the development of plate tectonics. The first\nnew hard evidence that supported plate motion came from\npaleomagnetism. Paleomagnetism is the study of magnetic fields\nfrozen within rocks, basically a fossil compass. This is typically most\nuseful with igneous rocks where magnetic minerals like magnetite\ncrystallizing in the magma align with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and\nin the solid rock point to the paleo-magnetic north. The earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field creates flux lines surrounding the magnetic north\nand south poles (like a bar magnet), which are both close to the 366 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nEarth\u2019s rotational north and south poles. In igneous rocks,\nmagnetic minerals align parallel with these flux lines. Thus, both\nmagnetic inclination, related to latitude, and declination related to\nmagnetic north are preserved in the rocks.\nScientists had noticed that, for some time, the magnetic north, to\nwhich many rocks pointed, was nowhere close to the current\nmagnetic north. This was explained by implying the magnetic\nnorth pole moved over time. Eventually, scientists started to realize\nthat moving continents explained the data better than moving the\npole around alone.\n.\nNormal magnetic\na\npolarity\nReversed\nmagnetic polarity b\nc\nLithosphere Magma\n\u201cOceanic Stripe Magnetic Anomalies Scheme\u201d by the United States\nGeologic Survey (USGS) is licensed under Public Domain.\nSeafloor Spreading\nWorld War II gave scientists the tools to find the mechanism for 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 367\ncontinental drift that had eluded Wegener. Maps and other data\ngathered during the war allowed scientists to develop the seafloor\nspreading hypothesis. This hypothesis traces oceanic crust from\nits origin at a mid-ocean ridge to its destruction at a deep-sea trench\nand is the mechanism for continental drift. (Seafloor Spreading |\nEarth Science, n.d.)\nDuring World War II, battleships and submarines carried echo\nsounders to locate enemy submarines. Echo sounders produce\nsound waves that travel outward in all directions, bounce off the\nnearest object, and then return to the ship. By knowing the sound\nspeed in seawater, scientists calculate the distance to the object\nbased on the time it takes for the wave to make a round trip. During\nthe war, most of the sound waves ricocheted off the ocean bottom.\nThis animation shows how sound waves are used to create pictures\nof the seafloor and ocean crust.\n\u201cTectonic Plate Boundaries\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey\n(USGS) is licensed under Public Domain.\nAfter the war, scientists pieced together the ocean depths to 368 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nproduce bathymetric maps, which revealed the ocean floor features\nas if the water were taken away. Even scientists were amazed that the\nseafloor was not completely flat. What was discovered was a large\nchain of mountains along the deep seafloor, called mid-ocean\nridges. Scientists also discovered deep-sea trenches along the edges\nof continents or in the sea near active volcanic chains. Finally, large,\nflat areas called abyssal plains we found. When they first observed\nthese bathymetric maps, scientists wondered what had formed these\nfeatures.\nScientists brought these observations together in the early 1960s to\ncreate the seafloor spreading hypothesis. In this hypothesis, a\nhot, buoyant mantle creates a mid-ocean ridge, causing the ridge to\nrise upward. The hot magma at the ridge erupts as lava that forms\nnew seafloor. When the lava cools, the magnetite crystals take on\nthe current magnetic polarity, and as more lava erupts, it pushes the\nseafloor horizontally away from the ridge axis. (Seafloor Spreading |\nEarth Science, n.d.)\nThe magnetic stripes continue across the seafloor. As oceanic crust\nforms and spreads, moving away from the ridge crest, it pushes the\ncontinent away from the ridge axis. If the oceanic crust reaches a\ndeep-sea trench, it sinks into the trench and is lost into the mantle.\nScientists now know that the oldest crust is coldest and lies deepest\nin the ocean because it is less buoyant than the hot new crust. 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 369\n\u201cAge of Oceanic Lithosphere\u201d by the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) is licensed under Public\nDomain.\nUnifying Theory of Plate Tectonics\nUsing all the evidence mentioned, the theory of plate tectonics took\nshape. In 1966, J. Tuzo Wilson was the first scientist to put the\nentire picture together of an opening and closing ocean. Before\nlong, models were proposed showing the plates moving concerning\neach other with clear boundaries between them, and scientists had\nalso started to piece together complicated tectonic histories. The\nplate tectonic revolution had taken hold. 370 | 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

What part of the Earth makes up the \u201cplates\u201d in plate\ntectonics? This question was also answered because of technology\ndeveloped during the Cold War. The tectonic plates are made up\nof the lithosphere. During the 1950s and early 1960s, scientists set\nup seismograph networks to see if enemy nations were testing\natomic bombs. These seismographs also recorded all the\nearthquakes around the planet. The seismic records could be used\nto locate an earthquake\u2019s epicenter, the point on Earth\u2019s surface\ndirectly above the earthquake\u2019s place. Earthquake epicenters outline\nthese tectonic plates. Mid-ocean ridges, trenches, and significant\nfaults mark the edges of these plates along with where earthquakes 3.6 THEORY OF PLATE TECTONICS | 371\noccur. (Reading: Theory of Plate Tectonics | Geology\n(Modification for Lehman College, CUNY), n.d.)\nThe lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor\ntectonic plates. The plates\u2019 edges can be drawn by connecting the\ndots that mark earthquakes\u2019 epicenters. A single tectonic plate can\nbe made of all oceanic lithosphere or all continental lithosphere,\nbut nearly all plates are made of a combination of both. Movement\nof the plates over Earth\u2019s surface is termed plate tectonics. Plates\nmove at a rate of a few centimeters a year, about the same rate\nfingernails grow. (Theory of Plate Tectonics | Earth Science, n.d.) 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE\nBOUNDARIES\nPlaces, where oceanic and continental lithospheric tectonic plates\nmeet and move relative to each other, are called active margins\n(e.g., the western coasts of North and South America). A location\nwhere continental lithosphere transitions into the oceanic\nlithosphere without movement is known as a passive margin (e.g.,\nthe eastern coasts of North and South Ameri-ca). Therefore,\ntectonic plates may be made of both oceanic and continental\nlithosphere. In the process of plate tectonics, the movement of the\nlithospheric plates is the primary force that causes the majority of\nfeatures and activity on the Earth\u2019s surface that can be attributed to\nplate tectonics. This movement occurs (at least partially) via the\ndrag of motion within the asthenosphere and because of density. (2\nPlate Tectonics \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nAs they move, the tectonic plates interact with each other at the\nboundaries between the tectonic plates. These interactions are the\nprimary drivers of mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanism\non the planet. In a simplified plate tectonic model, plate interaction\ncan be placed in one of three categories. In places where plates move\ntoward each other, the boundary is known as convergent. In places\nwhere plates move apart, the boundary is known as divergent. In\nplaces where the plates slide past each other, the boundary is known 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 373\nas a transform boundary. The next three subchapters will explain\nthe details of the movement at each type of boundary.\nConvergent Boundaries\nConvergent boundaries, sometimes called destructive\nboundaries, are places where two or more tectonic plates have a net\nmovement toward each other. Convergent boundaries, more than\nany other, are known for orogenesis, the process of building\nmountains and mountain chains. The key to convergent\nboundaries is understanding the density of each plate involved in\nthe movement. The continental lithosphere is always lower in\ndensity and is buoyant when compared to the asthenosphere. On\nthe other hand, the oceanic lithosphere is denser than the\ncontinental lithosphere and, when old and cold, may even be denser\nthan the asthenosphere. When plates of different density converge,\nthe denser plate sinks beneath, the less dense plate, a process called\nsubduction. (2 Plate Tectonics \u2013 An Introduction to Geology,\nn.d.) 374 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\n\u201cWorld Geologic Provinces\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey\n(USGS) is licensed under Public Domain.\nSubduction is when the oceanic lithosphere descends into the\nmantle due to its density. The average rate of subduction of oceanic\ncrust worldwide is 25 miles per million years, about a half-inch per\nyear. Continental lithosphere can partially subduct if attached to\nthe sinking oceanic lithosphere, but its buoyancy does not allow it\nto subduct fully. As the tectonic plate descends, it also pulls the\nocean floor down in a trench feature. On average, the ocean floor\nis around 3-4 km deep. In trenches, the ocean can be more than\ntwice as deep, with the Mariana Trench approaching a staggering 11\nkm.\nWithin the trench is a feature called the accretionary wedge,\nsometimes known as melange or accretionary prism, which is a\nmix of ocean floor sediments that are scraped and compressed at the\nboundary between the subducting plate and the overriding plate.\nSometimes pieces of continental material, like microcontinents,\nriding with the subducting plate will become sutured to the 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 375\naccretionary wedge, forming a terrane. Substantial portions of\nCalifornia are comprised of accreted terranes.\nWhen the subducting plate, known as a slab, submerges into the\ndepths of the mantle, the heat and pressure are so immense that\nlighter materials, known as volatiles, like water and carbon dioxide,\nare pushed out of the subducting plate into an area called the\nmantle wedge. The volatiles is released mostly via hydrated\nminerals that revert to non-hydrated forms in these conditions.\nWhen mixed with asthenospheric material above the tectonic plate,\nthese volatiles lower the melting point of the material. At the\ntemperature of that depth, the material melts to form magma. This\nprocess of magma generation is called flux melting. Magma,\nbecause of its lower density, migrates toward the surface, creating\nvolcanism. This forms a curved chain of volcanoes, due to many\nboundaries being curved on a spherical Earth, a feature called an\narc. The overriding plate, which contains the arc, can be either\noceanic or continental, where some features are different, but the\ngeneral architecture remains the same.\nHow subduction initiates are still a matter of some debate. This\nwould start at passive margins where oceanic and continental crust\nmeet. At the current time, there is oceanic lithosphere that is denser\nthan the underlying asthenosphere on either side of the Atlantic\nOcean that is not currently subducting. Why has it not turned into\nan active margin? Firstly, there is strength in the connection\nbetween the dense oceanic lithosphere and the less dense\ncontinental lithosphere it is connected to, which needs to be\novercome. Gravity could cause the denser oceanic plate to force\nitself down, or the plate can start to flow ductility at a low angle. 376 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nThere is evidence that new subduction is starting off the coast of\nPortugal. Massive earthquakes, like the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake,\nmay even have something to do with this process of creating a\nsubduction zone, though it is not definitive. Transform boundaries\nthat have brought areas of different densities together are also\nthought to start subduction. (2 Plate Tectonics \u2013 An Introduction\nto Geology, n.d.)\nBesides volcanism, subduction zones are also known for the most\nmassive earthquakes in the world. In places, the entire subducting\nslab can become stuck, and when the energy has built up too high,\nthe entire subduction zone can slide at once along a zone extending\nfor hundreds of kilometers along the trench, creating enormous\nearthquakes and tsunamis. The earthquakes can not only be\nsignificant, but they can be deep, outlining the subducting slab as it\ndescends. Sub-duction zones are the only places on Earth with fault\nsurfaces large enough to create 9.0 magnitude earthquakes. Also,\nbecause the faulting occurs beneath seawater, subduction can create\ngiant tsunamis, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and the\n2011 T\u014dhoku Earthquake in Japan.\nSubduction, which is a convergent motion, can have varying\ndegrees of convergence. In places with a high rate of convergence,\nmostly due to young, buoyant oceanic crust sub-ducting, the\nsubduction zone can create faulting behind the arc area itself,\nknown as back-arc faulting. This faulting can be tensional, or this\narea is subject to compressional forces. A modern example of this\noccurs in the two \u2018spines\u2019 of the Andes Mountains. In the west, the\nmountains are formed from the volcanic arc itself; in the east, thrust\nfaults have pushed up another, non-volcanic mountain range still 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 377\npart of the Andes. This type of thrusting can typically occur in two\nstyles: thin-skinned, which only faults surficial rocks, and thick-\nskinned, which thrusts deeper crustal rocks. Thin-skinned\ndeformation notably occurred in the western US during the\nCretaceous Sevier Orogeny. Near the end of the Sevier Orogeny,\nthick-skinned deformation also occurred in the Laramide Orogeny.\nThe Laramide Orogeny is also known for another subduction\nfeature: flat-slab subduction. When the slab subducts at such a\nlow angle, there is an interaction between the slab and the overlying\ncontinental plate. Magmatic activity can give rise to mineral\ndeposits, and deformation can occur well into the interior of the\noverriding plate. All subduction zones have a forearc basin, which\nis an area between the arc and the trench. This is an area of a high\ndegree of thrust faulting and deformation, seen mostly within the\naccretionary wedge. There are also places where the convergence\nshows the results of tensional forces. A variety of causes have been\nproposed for this, including slab roll-back due to density or ridge\nmigration. This causes extension behind the volcanic or island arc,\nknown as a back-arc basin. These can have so much extension that\nrifting and divergence can develop, though they can be more\nasymmetric than their mid-ocean ridge counterparts. (2 Plate\nTectonics \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nOceanic-Continental Subduction\nOceanic-continental subduction occurs when an oceanic plate\ndives below a continental plate. These regions can have powerful\nearthquakes along the subduction zones, with the potential of\ngenerating tsunamis. This boundary has a trench and mantle 378 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nwedge, but the volcanoes are expressed in a feature known as a\nvolcanic arc. A volcanic arc is a chain of mountain volcanoes, with\nfamous examples including the Cascade Range of the Pacific\nNorthwest and the Andes Mountains of South America.\n\u201cOceanic-Continental Destructive Plate Boundary\u201d is licensed\nunder Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.\nOceanic-Oceanic Subduction\nOceanic-oceanic subduction zones have two significant\ndifferences from boundaries that have continental lithosphere.\nFirstly, each plate in an ocean-ocean plate boundary is capable of\nsubduction. Therefore, it is typical that the denser, older, and\ncolder of the two plates is the one that subducts. Secondly, since\nboth plates are oceanic, volcanism creates volcanic islands instead\nof continental volcanic mountain ranges. This chain of active 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 379\nvolcanoes is known as an island arc. There are many examples of\nthis on Earth, including the Aleutian Islands off of Alaska, the\nLesser Antilles in the Caribbean, and several island arcs in the\nwestern Pacific.\n\u201cOceanic-Oceanic Destructive\u201d is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International.\u201d\nContinental-Continental\nConvergence\nIn places where two continental plates converge toward each other,\nsubduction is not possible. This occurs when an ocean basin closes,\nand a passive margin is attempted to drive down with the\nsubducting slab. Instead of subducting beneath the continent, the\ntwo masses of continental lithosphere slam into each other, in a\nprocess known as a collision. Collision zones are known for tall 380 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nmountains and frequent, massive earthquakes, with little to no\nvolcanism. With subduction ceasing with the collision, there is not\na process to create the magma for volcanism.\nContinental plates are too low density to subduct, which is why the\nprocess of collision occurs instead of subduction. Unlike the dense\nsubducting slabs that form from oceanic plates, any attempt to\nsubduct continental plates is short-lived. An occasional exception to\nthis is obduction, in which a part of a continental plate is caught\nbeneath an oceanic plate, formed in collision zones or with small\nplates caught in subduction zones. This imbalance in density is\nsolved by the continental material buoying upward, bringing\noceanic floor and mantle material to the surface, and is the primary\nsource of ophiolites. An ophiolite consists of rocks of the ocean\nfloor that are moved onto the continent, which can also expose\nparts of the mantle on the surface.\n\u201cContinental-Continental Destructive Plate Boundary\u201d is licensed\nunder Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International. 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 381\nForeland basins can also develop near the mountain belt, as the\nlithosphere is depressed due to the mass of the mountains\nthemselves. While subduction mountain ranges can cause this,\ncollisions have many examples, with possibly the best modern\nexample being the Persian Gulf, a feature only there due to the\nweight of the nearby Zagros Mountains. The subducting oceanic\nlithosphere powers collisions, and eventually stop as the continental\nplates combine into a more substantial mass. In truth, a small\nportion of the continental crust can be driven down into the\nsubduction zone, though due to its buoyancy, it returns to the\nsurface over time. Because of the relative plastic nature of the\ncontinental lithosphere, the zone of deformation is much\nbroader. Instead of earthquakes found along a narrow boundary,\ncollision earthquakes can be found hundreds of miles from the\nsuture between the landmasses.\nThe best modern example of this process occurs concurrently in\nmany locations across the Eurasian continent. It includes mountain\nbuilding in the Pyrenees (the Iberian Peninsula converging with\nFrance), Alps (Italy converging into central Europe), Zagros\n(Arabia converging into Iran), and Himalayan (India converging\ninto Asia) ranges. Eventually, as ocean basins close, continents join\ntogether to form a massive accumulation of continents called a\nsupercontinent, which has taken place in hundreds of million-year\ncycles over earth\u2019s history.

They can occur within a\ncontinental plate or an oceanic plate, though the typical pattern is\nfor divergence to begin within the continental lithosphere in a\nprocess known as \u201crift to drift,\u201d described below. 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 383\nContinental Rifting\nBecause of the thickness of continental plates, heat flow from the\ninterior is suppressed. The shielding that supercontinents provide is\neven stronger, eventually causing an upwelling of hot mantle\nmaterial. This material uplift weakens overlying continental crust,\nand as convection beneath naturally starts pulling the material away\nfrom the area, the area starts to be de-formed by tensional stress\nforming a valley feature known as a rift valley. These features are\nbounded by normal faults and include tall shoulders called horsts,\nand deep basins called grabens. When rifts form, they can\neventually create linear lakes, linear seas, and even oceans to form\nas divergent forces continue.\n\u201cContinental-Continental Constructive\u201d is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International.\nThis breakup via rifting, while initially seeming random, has two\ninfluences that dictate the shape and location of rifting. First, the 384 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nstable interiors of some continents, called a craton, are too strong\nto be broken apart by rifting. Where cratons are not a factor, rifting\ntypically occurs along with the patterns of a truncated\nicosahedron, or \u201csoccer ball\u201d pattern. This is the geometric pattern\nof fractures that requires the least amount of energy when\nexpanding a sphere equally in all directions. Taking into account the\nradius of the Earth, this includes 110 km segments of deformation\nand volcanism, which have 120-degree turns, forming something\nknown as failed rift arms. Even if the motion stops, a minor basin\ncan develop in this weak spot called an aulacogen, which can form\nlong-lived basins well after tectonic processes stop. These are places\nwhere extension started but did not continue. One famous example\nis the Mississippi Valley Embayment, which forms a depression\nthrough which the upper end of the Mississippi River flows. In\nplaces where the rift arms do not fail, for example, the Afar\nTriangle, three divergent boundaries can develop near each other,\nforming a triple junction.

The best example is the East\nAfrican Rift Zone, where the Horn of Africa near Somalia is\nbreaking away from mainland Africa. Lake Baikal in Russia is also\nan active rift. Broad rifts distribute the deformation over a wide\narea of many fault-bounded locations, like in the western United\nStates in a region known as the Basin and Range. The Wasatch\nFault, which created the Wasatch Range in Utah, marks the eastern\nedge of the Basin and Range. 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 387\n\u201cGreat Basin Map\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.\nOf course, earthquakes do occur at rifts, though not at the severity\nand frequency of some other boundaries. Volcanism is also frequent\nin the extended, faulted, and thin lithosphere found at rift zones\ndue to decompression melting and faults acting as conduits for the\nlava reaching the surface. Many relatively young volcanoes dot the\nBasin and Range, and bizarre volcanoes occur in East Africa like Ol 388 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nDoinyo Lengai in Tanzania, which erupts carbonatite lavas,\nrelatively cold liquid carbonate.\nMid-Oceanic Ridges\nAs rifting and volcanic activity progress, the continental lithosphere\nbecomes more mafic and thinner, with the eventual result\ntransforming the plate under the rifting area into the oceanic\nlithosphere. This is the process that gives birth to a new ocean,\nmuch like the narrow Red Sea (map) that emerged with the\nmovement of Arabia away from Africa. As the oceanic litho-sphere\ncontinues to diverge, a mid-ocean ridge is formed. (2 Plate\nTectonics \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\n\u201cOceanic-Oceanic Constructive\u201d is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International.\nA mid-ocean ridge, also known as a spreading center, has many\ndistinctive features. They are the only places on Earth where the 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 389\nnew oceanic lithosphere is being created via slow oozing volcanism.\nAs the oceanic lithosphere spreads apart, rising asthenosphere melts\ndue to decreasing pressure and fills in the void, making the new\nlithosphere and crust. These volcanoes produce more lava than all\nthe other volcanoes on Earth combined, and yet are not usually\nlisted on maps of volcanoes due to the vast majority of mid-ocean\nridges being underwater. Only rare locations, such as Iceland, are\nthe volcanism and divergent characteristics seen on land.\nTechnically, these places are not mid-ocean ridges because they are\nabove the surface of the seafloor.\nAlfred Wegener even hypothesized this concept of mid-ocean\nridges. Because the lithosphere is extremely hot at the ridge, it has a\nlower density. This lower density allows it to isostatically \u2018float\u2019\nhigher on the asthenosphere. As the lithosphere moves away from\nthe ridge by continued spreading, the plate cools and starts to sink\nisostatically lower, creating the surrounding abyssal plains with\nlower topography. Age patterns match this idea, with younger rocks\nnear the ridge and older rocks away from the ridge. Sediment\npatterns also thin toward the ridge, since the steady accumulation\nof dust and biologic material takes time to accumulate. 390 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=288\nAnother distinctive feature around mid-ocean ridges is magnetic\nstriping. Called the Vine-Matthews-Morley Hypothesis, it\nstates that as the material moves away from the ridge, it cools below\nthe Curie Point, the temperature at which the magnetic field is\nimprinted on the rock as the rock freezes. Over time, the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field has flipped back and forth, and it is this change in the\nfield causes the stripes. This pattern is an excellent record of past\nocean-floor movements and can be used to reconstruct past\ntectonics and determine rates of spreading at the ridges.\nMid-ocean ridges also are home to some of the unique ecosystems\ndiscovered, found around hydrothermal vents that circulate ocean\nwater through the shallow oceanic crust, and send it back out to 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 391\nrich chemical compounds and heat. While it was known for some\ntime that hot fluids could be found on the ocean floor, it was only\nin 1977 when a team of scientists using the Diving Support Vehicle\nAlvin discovered a thriving community of organisms, including\ntubeworms bigger than people. This group of organisms is\ndependent on the sun and photosynthesis but instead relies on\nchemical reactions with sulfur compounds and heat from within\nthe Earth, a process known as chemosynthesis. Before this\ndiscovery, the thought in biology was that the sun was the ultimate\nsource of energy in ecosystems; now, we know this to be false. Not\nonly that, but some have also suggested it is from this that life could\nhave started on Earth, and it now has become a target for\nextraterrestrial life (e.g., Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa).\nTransform Boundaries\nA transform boundary sometimes called a strike-slip or a\nconservative boundary, is where the motion is of the plates sliding\npast each other. They can move in either dextral fashion with the\nside opposite moving toward the right, or a sinistral fashion with\nthe side opposite moving toward the left. Most transform\nboundaries can be viewed as a single fault or as a series of faults. As\nstress builds on adjacent plates attempting to slide them past each\nother, eventually, a fault occurs and releases stress with an\nearthquake. Transform faults have a shearing motion and are\nprevalent in places where tectonic stresses are transferred. In\ngeneral, transform boundaries are known for only earthquakes,\nwith little to no mountain building and volcanism. 392 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\n\u201cContinental-Continental Conservative Opposite Direction\u201d is\nlicensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International.\nMost transform boundaries are associated with mid-ocean ridges.\nAs spreading centers progress, these aseismic fracture zone\ntransform faults accommodate different amounts of spreading due\nto Eulerian geometry that a sphere rotates faster in the middle\n(Equator) than at the top (Poles) than along the ridge. However, in\nthe eyes of humanity, the more significant trans-form faults are\nwhere the motion occurs within continental plates with a shearing\nmotion. These transform faults produce frequent moderate to large\nearthquakes. Famous examples include California\u2019s San Andreas\nFault, the Northern and Eastern Anatolian Faults in Turkey, the\nAltyn Tagh Fault in central Asia, and the Alpine Fault in New\nZealand.

Transpression is defined as places where\nthere is an extra component of compression with shearing. In these\nrestraining bends, mountains can be built up along the fault. The\nsouthern part of the San Andreas Fault has a large area of\ntranspression known as the \u201cbig bend\u201d and has built, moved, and\nrotated many mountain ranges in southern California.\nTranstension is defined as places where there is an extra\ncomponent of extension with shearing. In these releasing bends,\ndepressions and sometimes volcanism are formed along the fault.\nThe Dead Sea and California\u2019s Salton Sea are examples of basins\nformed by transtensional forces. 394 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nPiercing Points\nA piercing point is a feature that is cut by a fault and can be used\nto recreate past movements along the fault. While this can be used\non all faults, transform faults are most adapted for this technique.\nNormal and reverse faulting and divergent and convergent\nboundaries tend to obscure, bury, or destroy these features;\ntransform faults generally do not. Piercing points usually consist of\nunique lithologic, structural, or geographic patterns that can be\nmatched by removing the movement along the fault. Detailed\nstudies of piercing points along the San Andreas Fault has shown\nover 225 km of movement in the last 20 million years along three\ndifferent active traces of the fault. 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 395\n\u201cAerial San Andreas Carrizo Plain\u201d by John Wiley is licensed under\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported.\nWilson Cycle\nThe Wilson Cycle, named for J. Tuzo Wilson, who first described\nit in 1966, outlines the origin and subsequent breakup of\nsupercontinents. This cycle has been operating for the last billion\nyears with supercontinents Pangaea and Rodinia, and possibly\nbillions of years before that. The driving force of this is two-fold.\nThe more straightforward mechanism arises from the fact that\ncontinents hold the Earth\u2019s internal heat much better than the\nocean basins. When continents congregate together, they hold more 396 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nheat in which more vigorous convection can occur, which can start\nthe rifting process. Mantle plumes are inferred to be the legacy of\nthis increased heat and may record the history of the start of rifting.\nThe second mechanism for the Wilson Cycle involves the\ndestruction of plates. While rifting eventually leads to drifting\ncontinents, a few unanswered questions emerge:\n\u2022 Does their continued movement result from a continuation of\nthe ridge spreading and under-lying convection, known as\nridge push?\n\u2022 Do the tectonic plates move because of the weight of the\nsubducting slab sinking via its density, known as slab pull?\n\u2022 Alternatively, does the height of the ridge pushing down,\nknown as gravitational sliding?\nTo be sure, these are all factors in plate movement and the Wilson\nCycle. It does appear, in the current best hypothesis, that there is a\nmore significant component of slab pull than ridge push. Plate\ntectonic models are beginning to detail the next supercontinent,\ncalled Pangea Proxima, that will form 250 million years.\nHotspots\nWhile the Wilson Cycle can give a general overview of plate\nmotions in the past, another process can give a more precise, but\nrecent, plate movement. A hot spot is an area of rising magma,\ncausing a series of volcanic centers that form volcanic islands in the\nocean or craters\/mountains on land. There is no plate tectonic\nprocess, like subduction or rifting, which causes this volcanic 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 397\nactivity; it seems disconnected to plate tectonics processes. Also first\npostulated by J. Tuzo Wilson, in 1963, hot spots have a continual\nsource of magma with no earthquakes, besides those associated\nwith volcanism. The classic idea is that hot spots do not move,\nthough some evidence has been suggested that the hot spots do\nmove as well. Even though hotspots and plate tectonics seem\nindependent, there are some relationships between them, and they\nhave two components: Firstly, there are several hot spots currently\nand several others in the past that are believed to have begun at the\ntime of rifting. Secondly, as plate tectonics moves the plates around,\nthe assumed stationary nature of hot spots creates a track of\nvolcanism that can measure past plate movement. By using the age\nof the eruptions from hot spots and the direction of the chain of\nevents, one can identify a specific rate and direction of movement\nof a plate over the time the hot spot was active.\n\u201cHawaiian Hot Spot\u201d by the National Park Service is licensed under\nPublic Domain.\nHot spots are still very mysterious in their exact mechanism of 398 | 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES\nmagma generation. The main camps on hotspot mechanics are\nopposed. Some claim deep sources of heat, from as deep as the core,\nbring heat up to the surface in a structure called a mantle plume.\nSome have argued that not all hot spots are sourced from deep\nwithin the planet, and are sourced from shallower parts of the\nmantle. Others have mentioned how difficult it has been to imagine\nthese deep features. The idea of how hot spots start is also\ncontroversial. Usually, divergent boundaries are tabbed as the start,\nespecially during supercontinent break up, though some question\nwhether extensional or tectonic forces alone can explain the\nvolcanism. Subducting slabs have also been named as a cause for\nhotspot volcanism. Even impacts of objects from space have been\nused to explain plumes. However, they are formed; there are dozens\nfound throughout the Earth. Famous examples include the Tahiti,\nAfar Triangle, Easter Island, Iceland, the Galapagos Islands, and\nSamoa. The United States has two of the most extensive and best-\nstudied examples: Hawai\u2019i and Yellowstone.\nHawaiian Hot Spot\nThe big island of Hawaii is the active end of the Hawaiian-\nEmperor seamount chain, which stretches across the Pacific for\nalmost 6000 km. The evidence for this hot spot goes back at least 80\nmillion years, and presumably, the hot spot was around before then,\nbut rocks older than that in the Pacific Plate had already subducted.\nThe most striking feature of the chain is a significant bend that\noccurs about halfway through the chain that occurred about 50\nmillion years ago. The change in direction has been more often\nlinked to a plate re-configuration, but also other things like plume 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 399\nmigration. While some scientists often assume that mantle plumes\ndo not move, much like the plumes themselves, this idea is under\ndispute.\nThree-dimensional seismic imaging, called tomography, has\nmapped the Hawaiian mantle plume at depths, including the lower\nmantle. Within the Hawaiian Islands, there is unmistakable\nevidence of the age of volcanism decreasing, including island size,\nrock age, and even vegetation. Hawai\u2019i is one of the most active\nhotspots on Earth. Kilauea, the central active vent of the hot spot\neruption, has continually erupted since 1983.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The significant difference is that Hawaii sits on a thin\noceanic plate, which makes the magma easily come to the surface.\nYellowstone, however, is on a continental plate. The thickness of\nthe plate causes the generally much more violent and less frequent\neruptions that have carved a curved path in the western United\nStates for over 15 million years. Some have speculated an earlier\nstart to the hotspot, tying it to the Columbia River flood basalts\nand even 70 million-year-old volcanism in Canada\u2019s Yukon.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=288 3.7 TECTONIC PLATE BOUNDARIES | 401\nThe most recent significant eruption formed the current caldera\nand the Lava Creek Tuff. This eruption threw into the atmosphere\nabout 1000 cubic kilometers of magma erupted 631,000 years ago.\nAsh from the eruption has been found as far away as Mississippi.\nThe next eruption, when it occurs, should be of equivalent size,\ncausing a massive calamity to not only the western United States\nbut also the world. These so-called \u201csupervolcanic\u201d eruptions have\nthe potential for volcanic winters lasting years. With so much gas\nand ash filling the atmosphere, sunlight is blocked and unable to\nreach Earth\u2019s surface as well as usual, which could drastically alter\nglobal environments and send worldwide food production into a\ntailspin.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Strain is deformation caused by stress. Strain\nin rocks can be represented as a change in rock volume and rock\nshape, as well as fracturing the rock. There are three types of stress:\ntensional, compressional, and shear. Tensional stress involves\npulling something apart in opposite directions, stretching and\nthinning the material. Compressional stress involves things\ncoming together and pushing on each other, thickening the\nmaterial. Shear stress involves transverse movement of the material\nmoving past each other, like a scissor. (9 Crustal Deformation and\nEarthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nDeformation\nWhen rocks are stressed, the resulting strain can be elastic, ductile,\nor brittle, called deformation. Elastic deformation is strain that is\nreversible after the stress is released. For example, when compressing\na spring, it elastically returns to its original shape after releasing it. 414 | 4.1 GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND LANDFORMS\nDuctile deformation occurs when enough stress is applied to a\nmaterial that the changes are permanent, and the material is no\nlonger able to revert to its original shape. For example, if a spring is\nstretched too far, it can be permanently bent out of shape. Note\nthat concepts related to ductile deformation apply at the visible\n(macro) scale, and deformation is more complicated at a\nmicroscopic scale. Research of plastic deformation, which touches\non the atomic scale, is beyond the scope of introductory texts. The\nyield point is the amount of strain at which elastic deformation is\nsurpassed, and permanent deformation is measurable. Brittle\ndeformation is when the material undergoes another critical point\nof no return. When sufficient stress to pass that point occurs, it fails\nand fractures.

Pore pressure is the pressure exerted by fluids\ninside of the open spaces (pores) inside of a rock or sediment.\nStrain rate is how quickly material is deformed. Rock strength is\na measure of how readily a rock will respond to stress. Shale has low\nstrength, and granite has high strength.\nRemoving heat, such as decreasing temperature, makes the material\nmore rigid. Likewise, heating materials make them more ductile.\nHeating glass makes it capable of bending and stretching.\nRegarding strain response, it is easier to bend a piece of wood\nslowly without breaking it.\nSedimentary rocks are essential for deciphering the geologic history\nof a region because they follow specific rules. First, sedimentary\nrocks are formed with the oldest layers on the bottom and the\nyoungest on top. Second, sediments are deposited horizontally, so\nsedimentary rock layers are originally horizontal, as are some\nvolcanic rocks, such as ash falls. Finally, sedimentary rock layers that\nare not horizontal are deformed in some manner \u2013 often looking\nlike they are tiling into the earth. Scientists can trace the\ndeformation a rock has experienced by seeing how it differs from its\noriginal horizontal, oldest-on-bottom position. This deformation\nproduces geologic structures such as folds, joints, and faults that are\ncaused by stresses. 416 | 4.1 GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND LANDFORMS\nStress and Mountain Building\nThe sheer power and strength of two or more converging\ncontinental plates smash upwards that create mountain ranges.\nStresses from geologic uplift cause folds, reverse faults, and thrust\nfaults, which allow the crust to rise upwards. The subduction of\noceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries also builds\nmountain ranges. When tensional stresses pull crust apart, it breaks\ninto blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The\nresult is alternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-\nrange.\n\u201cFolding\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nFolds\nGeologic folds are layers of rock that are curved or bent by ductile\ndeformation. Terms involved with folds include axis, which is the\nline along which the bending occurred, and limbs, which are the\ndipping beds that make up the sides of the folds. Compressional\nforces most commonly form folds at depth, where hotter 4.1 GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND LANDFORMS | 417\ntemperatures and higher confining pressures allow ductile\ndeformation to occur.\nFolds are described by the orientation of their axes, axial planes, and\nlimbs. They are made up of two or more dipping beds, dipping in\nopposite directions, which come together along a line, called the\naxis. Each set of dipping beds is known as a fold limb. The plane\nthat splits the fold into two halves is known as the axial plane. (9\nCrustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to\nGeology, n.d.)\nSymmetrical folds have mirrored limbs across their axial planes.\nThe limbs of a symmetrical fold are inclined at the same, but\nopposite, angle indicating equal compression on both sides of the\nfold. Asymmetrical folds have dipping, non-vertical axial planes,\nwhere limbs dip into the ground at different angles. Recumbent\nfolds are very tight folds with limbs compressed near the axial\nplanes and are generally horizontal, and overturned folds are where\nthe angles on both limbs dip in the same direction. The fold axis is\nwhere the axial plane intersects the strata involved in the fold. A\nhorizontal fold has a horizontal fold axis. When the axis of the fold\nplunges into the ground, the fold is called a plunging fold. 418 | 4.1 GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND LANDFORMS\n\u201cRock Folding\u201d by Colin Park is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nAnticline\nAnticlines are arch-like (\u201cA\u201d-shaped) folds, with downward\ncurving limbs that have beds that dip away from the central axis of\nthe fold. They are convex-upward in shape. In anticlines, the oldest\nrock strata are in the center of the fold along the axis, and the\nyounger beds are on the outside. An antiform has the same shape as\nan anticline, but in antiforms, the relative ages of the beds in the\nfold cannot be determined. Oil geologists have an interest in\nanticlines because they can form oil traps, where oil migrates up\nalong the limbs of the fold and accumulates in the high point along\nthe axis of the fold.

They are\nconcave-upward in shape. In synclines, the older rock is on the\noutside of the fold, and the youngest rock is on the inside of the\nfold along the axis.

They are relatively common on\nthe Colorado Plateau, where they form \u201creefs,\u201d ridges that act as\ntopographic barriers and should not be confused with ocean reefs.\nCapitol Reef National Park is an example of a monocline in Utah.\nMonoclines can be caused by bending of shallower sedimentary\nstrata as faults grow below them. These faults are commonly called\n\u201cblind faults\u201d because they end before reaching the surface and can\nbe either normal or reverse faults. (9 Crustal Deformation and\nEarthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nDome\nA dome is a symmetrical to semi-symmetrical upwarping of rock\nbeds, like in Utah\u2019s San Rafael Swell. Domes have a shape like an 4.1 GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES AND LANDFORMS | 421\ninverted bowl, similar to domes on buildings, like the Capitol\nBuilding. Some domes are formed from compressional forces, while\nother domes are formed from underlying igneous intrusions, by salt\ndiapirs, or even impacts, like upheaval dome in Canyonlands\nNational Park. (9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nBasin\nA basin is the inverse of a dome. The basin is when rock forms a\nbowl-shaped depression. The Uinta Basin is an example of a basin\nin Utah. Technically, geologists refer to rocks folded into a bowl-\nshape as structural basins. Sometimes structural basins can also be\nsedimentary basins in which large quantities of sediment\naccumulate over time. Sedimentary basins can form as a result of\nfolding but are much more commonly produced in mountain\nbuilding, between mountain blocks or via faulting. Regardless of\nthe cause, as the basin sinks, called subsidence, it can accumulate\neven more sediment as the sediment\u2019s weight causes more\nsubsidence in a positive-feedback loop. There are active sedimentary\nbasins all over the world. 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\nTypes of Faults\nFaults are the places in the crust where brittle deformation occurs\nas two blocks of rocks move relative to one another. There are three\nmajor fault types: normal, reverse, and strike-slip. Normal and\nreverse faults display vertical, also known as dip-slip, motion. Dip-\nslip motion consists of relative up and down movement along a\ndipping fault between two blocks, the hanging wall and the\nfootwall. In a dip-slip system, the footwall is below the fault\nplane, and the hanging-wall is above the fault plane. An excellent\nway to remember this is to imagine a mine tunnel through a fault;\nthe hanging wall would be where a miner would hang a lantern, and\nthe footwall would be at the miner\u2019s feet. Faults are more prevalent\nnear and related to plate boundaries but can occur in plate interiors\nas well. Faults can show evidence of movement along the fault\nplane. Slickensides are polished, often grooved surfaces along the\nfault plane created by friction during the movement. A joint or\nfracture is a plane of breakage in a rock that does not show\nmovement or offset. Joints can result from many processes, such as\ncooling, depressurizing, or folding. Joint systems may be regional\naffecting many square miles. (9 Crustal Deformation and\nEarthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.) 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 423\n\u201cMoab Fault\u201d by Andrew Wilson\u201d is licensed under Public Domain.\nNormal faults move by a vertical motion where the hanging-wall\nmoves downward relative to the footwall along the dip of the fault.\nTensional forces create normal faults in the crust. Normal faults\nand tensional forces are commonly caused at divergent plate\nboundaries and where tensional stresses are stretching the crust. An\nexample of a normal fault is the Wasatch Fault along the Wasatch\nRange.\nGrabens, horsts, and half-grabens are all blocks of crust or rock\nbounded by normal faults. Grabens drop down relative to adjacent\nblocks and create valleys. Horsts go up relative to adjacent down-\ndropped blocks and become areas of high topography. Where\ntogether, horsts and grabens create a symmetrical pattern of valleys\nsurrounded by normal faults on both sides and mountains. Half- 424 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\ngrabens are a one-sided version of a horst and graben, where blocks\nare tilted by a normal fault on one side, creating an asymmetrical\nvalley-mountain arrangement. The mountain-valleys of the Basin\nand Range Province of Western Utah and Nevada consist of a series\nof full and half-grabens from the Salt Lake Valley to the Sierra\nNevada Mountains. When the dip of a normal fault decreases with\ndepth (i.e., the fault becomes more horizontal as it goes deeper), the\nfault is listric. Extreme versions of listric faulting occur when\nsubstantial amounts of extension occur along very low-angle\nnormal faults, known as detachment faults. The normal faults of\nthe Basin and Range appear to be-come detachment faults at depth.\n(9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to\nGeology, n.d.)\nHorst Graben\nNormal\nfault\n\u201cHorst and Graben\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nReverse faults, caused by compressional forces, are when the\nhanging wall moves up relative to the footwall. A thrust fault is a\nreverse fault where the fault plane has a low dip angle (generally less\nthan 45 degrees). Thrust faults bring older rocks on top of younger 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 425\nrocks and can cause repetition of rock units in the stratigraphic\nrecord. Convergent plate boundaries with subduction zones create\na particular type of \u201creverse\u201d fault called a megathrust fault.\nMegathrust faults cause the most significant magnitude\nearthquakes and commonly cause tsunamis.\nPop-up Pop-down\nReverse\nfaults\n\u201cReverse Faults\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nStrike-slip faults have a side to side motion. In the pure strike-slip\nmotion, crustal blocks on either side of the fault do not move up or\ndown relative to each other. There is left-lateral, called sinistral,\nand right-lateral, called dextral, strike-slip motion. In left-lateral or\nsinistral strike-slip motion, the opposite block moves left relative to\nthe block that the observer is standing on. In right-lateral or dextral\nstrike-slip motion, the opposite block moves right relative to the\nobserver\u2019s block. Strike-slip faults are most associated with\ntransform boundaries and are prevalent in fracture zones adjacent\nto mid-ocean ridges.\nBends in strike-slip faults can create areas where the sliding blocks 426 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\ncreate compression or tension. Tensional stresses will create\ntranstensional features with normal faults and basins like\nCalifornia\u2019s Salton Sea, and compressional stresses will create\ntranspressional features with reverse faults and small-scale\nmountain building, like California\u2019s San Gabriel Mountains. The\nfaults that play off transpression or transtension features are known\nas flower structures.\nAn example of a right-lateral strike-slip fault is the San Andreas\nFault, which denotes a transform boundary between the North\nAmerican and Pacific plates. An example of a left-lateral strike-slip\nfault is the Dead Sea fault in Jordan and Israel. (9 Crustal\nDeformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\n\u201cStrike-slip Fault\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution\n4.0 International.\nCauses of Earthquakes\nPeople feel approximately 1 million earthquakes a year. Few are 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 427\nnoticed far from the source. Even fewer are significant earthquakes.\nEarthquakes are usually felt only when they are greater than a\nmagnitude 2.5 or greater. The USGS Earthquakes Hazards\nProgram has a real-time map showing the most recent earthquakes.\nMost earthquakes occur along active plate boundaries. Intraplate\nearthquakes (not along plate boundaries) are still poorly\nunderstood. (9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nEarthquake energy is known as seismic energy, and it travels\nthrough the earth in the form of seismic waves. To understand\nsome of the basics of earthquakes and how they are measured,\nconsider some of the fundamental properties of waves. Waves\ndescribe a motion that repeats itself in a medium such as rock or\nunconsolidated sediments. The magnitude refers to the height,\ncalled amplitude, of a wave. Wavelength is the distance between\ntwo successive peaks of the wave. The number of repetitions of the\nmotion over time, called cycles per time, is the frequency. The\ninverse of frequency, which is the amount of time for a wave to\ntravel one wavelength, is the period. When multiple waves combine,\nthey can interfere with each other. When the waves are in sync with\neach other, they will have constructive interference, where the\ninfluence of one wave will add to and magnify the other. If the\nwaves are out of sync with each other, they will have destructive\ninterference. If two waves have the same amplitude and frequency\nand are \u00bd wavelength out of sync, the destructive interference\nbetween them can eliminate each wave. 428 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=376\nThe elastic rebound theory explains the release of seismic energy.\nWhen the rock is strained to the point that it undergoes brittle\ndeformation, built-up elastic energy is released during dis-\nplacement, which radiates away as seismic waves. When the brittle\ndeformation occurs, it creates an offset between the fault blocks at a\nstarting point called the focus. This offset propagates along the\nsurface of rupture, which is known as the fault plane.\nThe fault blocks of persistent faults like the Wasatch Fault of Utah\nare locked together by friction. Over hundreds to thousands of\nyears, stress builds up along the fault. Eventually, stress along the\nfault overcomes the frictional resistance, and slip initiates as the\nrocks break. The deformed rocks \u201csnap back\u201d toward their original 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 429\nposition in a process called elastic rebound. Bending of the rocks\nnear the fault may reflect this buildup of stress, and in earth-quake-\nprone areas like California, strain gauges that measure this bending\nare set up in an attempt to understand more about predicting an\nearthquake. In some locations where the fault is not locked, seismic\nstress causes a continuous movement along the fault called fault\ncreep, where displacement occurs gradually. Fault creep occurs\nalong some parts of the San Andreas Fault.\nThe release of seismic energy occurs in a series of steps. After a\nseismic energy release, energy begins to build again during a period\nof inactivity along the fault. The accumulated elastic strain may\nproduce small earthquakes (on or near the main fault). These are\ncalled fore-shocks and can occur hours or days before a massive\nearthquake, but they may not occur at all. The main release of\nenergy occurs during the major earthquake, known as the\nmainshock. Aftershocks may then occur to adjust strain that built\nup from the movement of the fault. They generally decrease over\ntime. (9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction\nto Geology, n.d.)\nEarthquake Zones\nNearly 95 percent of all earthquakes occur along with one of the\nthree types of tectonic plate boundaries, but earthquakes do occur\nalong all three types of plate boundaries. About 80 percent of all\nearthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined\nwith convergent and transform boundaries. Called the Ring of\nFire, this is also the location of most volcanoes around the planet. 430 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\nAbout 15 percent take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt,\nwhere convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into the\nEurasian Plate, creating the largest mountain ranges in the world.\nThe remaining 5 percent are scattered around other plate\nboundaries or are intraplate earthquakes.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=376\nTransform Plate Boundaries\nTransform plate boundaries occur when two tectonic plates grind\nparallel to each other rather than colliding or subducting. Deadly\nearthquakes occur at transform plate boundaries, creating strike-\nslip faults because they tend to have shallow focuses where the 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 431\nrupture occurs. The faults along the San Andreas Fault zone\nproduce around 10,000 earthquakes a year. Most are tiny, but\noccasionally one is massive. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the Hay-\nward Fault was the site of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in 1868. The\n1906 quake on the San Andreas Fault had a magnitude estimated at\n7.9.\nDuring the 1989 World Series, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck\nLoma Prieta, near Santa Cruz, California, killing 63 people,\ninjuring 3,756, and cost $6 billion. A few years later, in Northridge,\nCalifornia, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake killed 72 people, injured\n12,000 people, and caused $12.5 billion in damage. This earthquake\noccurred on an unknown fault because it was a blind thrust fault\nnear Los Angeles, California.\nAlthough California is prone to many natural hazards, including\nvolcanic eruptions at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen, and landslides on\ncoastal cliffs, the natural hazard the state is linked with is\nearthquakes. New Zealand also has strike-slip earthquakes, about\n20,000 a year, but only a small percentage of those are large enough\nto be felt. A 6.3 quake in Christchurch in February 2011 killed\nabout 180 people. (Reading: The Nature of Earthquakes | Geology,\nn.d.)\nConvergent Plate Boundaries\nEarthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the motions of\nthe subducting lithosphere as it plunges through the mantle,\ncreating reverse and thrust faults. Convergent plate boundaries\nproduce earthquakes all around the Pacific Ocean basin. The 432 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\nPhilippine Plate and the Pacific Plate subduct beneath Japan,\ncreating a chain of volcanoes and produces as many as 1,500\nearthquakes annually.\nIn March 2011, an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off Sendai in\nnortheastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 T\u014dhoku\nearthquake, was the most powerful ever to strike Japan and one of\nthe top five known worldwide. Damage from the earthquake was\nover-shadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out\ncoastal cities and towns. Two months after the earthquake, about\n25,000 people died or were missing, and 125,000 buildings were\ndamaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major\nearthquakes, have continued to rock the region. A map of\naftershocks is seen here. Recently, the New York Times created an\ninteractive website of the Japan earthquake and tsunami.\nThe Pacific Northwest of the United States is at risk from a\npotentially massive earthquake that could strike any time.\nSubduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath North America\nproduces active volcanoes, but large earthquakes only hit every 300\nto 600 years. The last was in 1700, with an estimated magnitude of\naround 9.0. The elastic rebound theory, as applied to subduction\nzones, can be viewed here.\nMassive earthquakes are the hallmark of the thrust faulting and\nfolding when two continental plates converge. The 2001 Gujarat\nearthquake in India was responsible for about 20,000 deaths, and\nmany more people became injured or homeless. In Understanding\nEarthquakes: From Research to Resilience, scientists try to\nunderstand the mechanisms that cause earthquakes and tsunamis 4.2 EARTHQUAKES | 433\nand how society can deal with them.

Earthquakes at mid-\nocean ridges are small and shallow because the plates are young,\nthin, and hot. On land where continents split apart, earthquakes are\nlarger and stronger. A classic example of normal faulting along\ndivergent boundaries is the Wasatch Front in Utah and the entire\nBasin and Range through Nevada. 434 | 4.2 EARTHQUAKES\n\u201cWasatch Fault\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nIntraplate Boundaries\nIntraplate earthquakes are the result of stresses caused by plate\nmotions acting in solid slabs of the lithosphere. In 1812, a\nmagnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri. The\nearthquake was strongly felt over approximately 50,000 square\nmiles and altered the course of the Mississippi River. Because very\nfew people lived there at the time, only 20 people died. Many more\npeople live there today. A similar earthquake today would\nundoubtedly kill many people and cause a great deal of property\ndamage. (Reading: The Nature of Earthquakes | Geology, n.d.) 4.3 MEASURING AND\nLOCATING EARTHQUAKES\nFocus and Epicenter\nThe focus, also called a hypocenter of an earthquake, is the point\nof initial breaking or rupturing where the displacement of rocks\noccurs. The focus is always at some depth below the ground surface\nin the crust, and not at the surface. From the focus, the\ndisplacement propagates up, down, and laterally along the fault\nplane. The displacement produces shock waves, creates seismic\nwaves. The larger the displacement and the further it propagates,\nthe more significant the seismic waves and ground shaking. More\nshaking is usually the result of more seismic energy released. The\nepicenter is the location on the Earth\u2019s surface vertically above the\npoint of rupture (focus). The epicenter is also the location that\nmost news reports give because it is the center of the area where\npeople are affected. The focus is the point along the fault plane\nfrom which the seismic waves spread outward. (9 Crustal\nDeformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.) 436 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\n\u201cFocus and Epicenter\u201d by the Utah Geologic Survey is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nSeismic Waves\nSeismic waves are an expression of the energy released after an\nearthquake in the form of body waves and surface waves. When\nseismic energy is released, the first waves to propagate out are body\nwaves that pass through the planet\u2019s body. Body waves include\nprimary waves (P waves) and secondary waves (S waves). Primary\nwaves are the fastest seismic waves. They move through the rock via\ncompression, very much like sound waves move through the air.\nParticles of rock move forward and back during the passage of the P\nwaves. Primary waves can travel through both fluids and solids.\nSecondary waves travel slower and follow primary waves,\npropagating as shear waves. Particles of rock move from side to side\nduring the passage of S waves. Because of this, secondary waves\ncannot travel through liquids, plasma, or gas.\nWhen an earthquake occurs at a location in the earth, the body 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES | 437\nwaves radiate outward, passing through the earth and into the rock\nof the mantle. A point on this spreading wave-front travels along a\nspecific path that reaches a seismograph located at one of the\nthousands of seismic stations scattered over the earth. That specific\ntravel path is a line called a seismic ray. Since the density (and\nseismic velocity) of the mantle increases with depth, a process called\nrefraction causes earthquake rays to curve away from the vertical\nand bend back toward the surface, passing through bodies of rock\nalong the way.\n\u201cSeismic Waves\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nSurface waves are produced when P and S body waves strike the\nearth\u2019s surface and travel along the Earth\u2019s surface, radiating\noutward from the epicenter. Surface waves travel more slowly than\nbody waves. They have complex horizontal and vertical ground\nmovements that create a rolling motion. Because they propagate at\nthe surface and have complex motions, surface waves are responsible\nfor most of the damage. Two types of surface waves are Love waves\nand Rayleigh waves. Love waves produce horizontal ground\nshaking and, ironically from their name, are the most destructive.\nRayleigh waves produce an elliptical motion of points on the 438 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\nsurface, with longitudinal dilation and compression, like ocean\nwaves. How-ever, with Raleigh waves, rock particles move in a\ndirection opposite to that of water particles in ocean waves. (9\nCrustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to\nGeology, n.d.)\nEarth is like a bell, and an earthquake is a way to ring it. Like other\nwaves, seismic waves bend and bounce when passing from one\nmaterial to another, like moving from a dense rock to rock with\neven higher density. When a wave bends as it moves into a different\nsubstance, it is known as refraction, and when waves bounce back,\nit is known as reflection. Because S waves cannot move through a\nliquid, they are blocked by the liquid outer core, creating a shadow\nzone on the opposite side of the planet to the earthquake source.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES | 439\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=380\nSeismographs\nSeismographs are instruments used to measure seismic waves.\nThey measure the vibration of the ground using pendulums or\nsprings. The seismograph principle involves mounting a recording\ndevice solidly to the earth and suspending a pen or writing\ninstrument above it on a spring or pendulum. As the ground\nshakes, the suspended pen records the shaking on the recording\ndevice. The graph resulting from measurements of a seismograph is\na seismogram. Seismographs of the early 20th century were mostly\nsprings or pendulums with pens on them that wrote on a rotating\ndrum of paper. Digital ones now use magnets and wire coils to\nmeasure ground motion. Typical seismograph arrays measure\nvibrations in three directions: north-south (x), east-west (y), and\nup-down (z). 440 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\n\u201cSeismograph Recording\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International.\nTo determine the distance of the seismograph from the epicenter,\nseismologists use the difference between when the first P waves\nand S waves arrive. After an earthquake, P waves will appear first on\nthe seismogram, followed by S waves, and finally, body waves,\nwhich have the largest amplitude on the seismogram. Surface waves\ndo lose energy quickly, so they are not measured at great distances\nfrom the focus. Seismograph technology across the globe record the\narrival of seismic waves from each earthquake at many station sites.\nThe distance to the epicenter can be determined by comparing\narrival times of the P and S waves. Electronic communication\namong seismic stations and connected computers used to make\ncalculations mean that locations of earthquakes and news reports\nabout them are generated quickly in the modern world. (9 Crustal\nDeformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.) 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES | 441\nLocating Earthquakes\nEach seismograph gives the distance from that station to the\nearthquake epicenter. Three or more seismograph stations are\nneeded to locate the epicenter of an earthquake through\ntriangulation. Using the arrival-time difference from the first P wave\nto the first S wave, one can determine the distance from the\nepicenter, but not the direction. The distance from the epicenter to\neach station can be plotted as a circle, the distance being equal to\nthe circle\u2019s radius. The place where the circles intersect demarks the\nepicenter. This method also works in three dimensions with spheres\nand multi-axis seismographs to locate not only the epicenter but\nalso the depth of the earthquake\u2019s focus.\nSeismograph Network\nThe International Registry of Seismograph Stations lists more than\n20,000 seismographs on the planet. Seismologists can use and 442 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\ncompare data from sets of multiple seismometers dispersed over a\nwide area, a seismograph network. By collaborating, scientists can\nmap the inside of the earth\u2019s properties, detect large explosive\ndevices, and predict tsunamis. The Global Seismograph Network, a\nset of worldwide linked seismographs that distribute real-time data\nelectronically, consists of more than 150 stations that meet specific\ndesign and precision standards. The Global Seismograph Network\nhelps the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\nmonitor for nuclear tests. The USArray is a network of hundreds of\npermanent and transportable seismographs within the United\nStates.

The\nRichter scale is the most well-known magnitude scale devised for\nan earthquake and was the first one developed by Charles Richter at\nCalTech. This was the magnitude scale used historically by early\nseismologists. The Richter scale magnitude is determined from\nmeasurements on a seismogram. Magnitudes on the Richter scale\nare based on measurements of the maximum amplitude of the\nneedle trace measured on the seismogram and the arrival time\ndifference of S and P waves, which gives the distance to the\nearthquake. (9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nThe Richter scale is a logarithmic scale, based on powers of 10. The\namplitude of the seismic wave recorded on the seismogram is ten\ntimes greater for each increase of 1 unit on the Richter scale. That\nmeans a magnitude six earthquake shakes the ground ten times\nmore than a magnitude 5. However, the actual energy released for\neach 1-unit magnitude increase is 32 times greater. That means 444 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\nenergy released for a magnitude six earthquake is 32 times greater\nthan a magnitude 5 earthquake. The Richter scale was developed\nfor distances appropriate for earthquakes in Southern California\nand on seismograph machines in use there. Its applications to more\nconsiderable distances and massive earthquakes are limited.\nTherefore, most agencies no longer use Richter\u2019s methods to\ndetermine the magnitude but generate a quantity called the\nMoment Magnitude, which is more accurate for large earthquakes\nmeasured at the seismic array across the earth. As numbers, the\nmoment magnitudes are comparable to the magnitudes of the\nRichter Scale. The media still often give magnitudes as Richter\nMagnitude even though the actual calculation was of moment\nmagnitude.\n\u201cEarthquake Severity\u201d is licensed under Public Domain. 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES | 445\nMoment Magnitude Scale\nThe Moment Magnitude Scale depicts the absolute size of\nearthquakes, comparing information from multiple locations and\nusing a measurement of actual energy released calculated from the\ncross-sectional area of rupture, amount of slippage, and the rigidity\nof the rocks. Because of the unique geologic setting of each\nearthquake and because the rupture area is often hard to measure,\nestimates of moment magnitude can take days to months to\ncalculate. (9 Crustal Deformation and Earthquakes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nLike the Richter magnitude, the moment magnitude scale is\nlogarithmic. Both scales are used in tandem because the estimates of\nmagnitude may change after a quake. The Richter scale is used as a\nquick determination immediately following the quake (and is\nusually reported in news accounts), and the moment magnitude is\ncalculated days to months later. The magnitude values of the two\nmagnitudes are approximately equal except for massive\nearthquakes.\nModified Mercalli-Intensity Scale\nThe Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale is a qualitative scale (I-\nXII) of the intensity of ground shaking based on damage to\nstructures and people\u2019s perceptions. This scale can vary depending\non the location and population density (urban vs. rural). It was also\nused for historical earthquakes, which occurred before quantitative\nmeasurements of magnitude could be made. The Modified Mercalli\nIntensity maps show where the damage is most severe based on 446 | 4.3 MEASURING AND LOCATING EARTHQUAKES\nquestionnaires sent to residents, newspaper articles, and reports\nfrom assessment teams. Recently, USGS has used the internet to\nhelp gather data more quickly.\nShakemaps (written ShakeMaps by the USGS) use high-quality\nseismograph data from seismic networks to show areas of intense\nshaking. They are the result of rapid, computer-interpolated\nseismograph data. They are useful in crucial minutes after an\nearthquake, as they can show emergency personnel where the most\nsignificant damage likely occurred and locate areas of possible\ndamaged gas lines and other utilities.\n\u201cModified Mercalli Intensity Scale\u201d by the United States Geologic\nSurvey is licensed under Public Domain. 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK\nGround Shaking, Location, and\nDirection\nIn general, the larger the magnitude, the stronger the shaking, and\nthe longer the shaking will last. However, other factors influence\nthe level of shaking. Closer earthquakes will inherently cause more\nshaking than those farther away. The location of the epicenter and\ndirection of rupture will influence how much shaking is felt. The\ndirection that the rupture propagates along the fault influences the\nshaking. The path of most significant rupture can intensify shaking\nin effect known as directivity.\nThe nature of the ground materials affects the properties of the\nseismic waves. Varied materials respond differently to an\nearthquake. Think of shaking jello versus shaking a meatloaf; one\nwill jiggle much more to the same amount of shaking. The response\nto shaking depends on their degree of consolidation; lithified\nsedimentary rocks, and crystalline rocks shake less than\nunconsolidated sediments and landfill. This is because seismic\nwaves move faster through consolidated bedrock, move slower\nthrough unconsolidated sediment, and move slowest through\nunconsolidated materials with high water content. Since the energy\nis carried by both velocity and amplitude, when a seismic wave\nslows down, its amplitude increases, which in turn increases seismic 448 | 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK\nshaking. Energy is transferred to the vertical motion of the surface\nwaves.\nDepth of Focus\nThe focus is the place within the Earth where the earthquake starts,\nand the depth of earthquakes influences the amount of shaking.\nDeeper earthquakes cause less shaking at the surface because they\nlose much of their energy before reaching the surface. Recall that\nmost of the destruction is caused by surface waves, caused by the\nbody waves reaching the surface.\nWhat Determines Destruction?\nBuilding Materials\nBuilding material choices can influence the amount of damage\ncaused by earthquake shaking. The flexibility of building materials\nrelates to their resistance to damage by earthquake waves.\nUnreinforced Masonry (URM) is the most devastated by ground\nshaking. Wood framing held together with nails that can bend and\nflex with wave passage are more likely to survive earthquakes. Steel\nalso can deform elastically before brittle failure. The Salt Lake City\ncampaign \u201cFix the Bricks\u201d has useful information on URMs and\nearthquake safety.\nShaking Intensity and Duration\nMore significant shaking and duration of shaking will cause more 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK | 449\ndestruction than less shaking and shorter shaking. Resonance is\nwhen the frequency of seismic energy matches a building\u2019s natural\nfrequency of shaking, determined by properties of the building, and\nintensifies the shaking\u2019s amplitude. This famously happened in the\n1985 Mexico City Earthquake, where buildings of heights between\n6 and 15 stories were especially vulnerable to earthquake damage.\nSkyscrapers designed with earthquake resilience have dampers, and\nbase isolation features to reduce resonance. Changes in the\nstructural integrity of a structure could alter its resonance.\nConversely, changes in measured resonance can indicate potential\nchanges in structural integrity. (9 Crustal Deformation and\nEarthquakes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nEarthquake Recurrence\nGeologists dig earthquake trenches across some faults to measure\nground deformation and estimate the frequency of occurrence of\npast earthquakes. Trenches are useful for faults with prolonged\nrecurrence intervals (100s to 10,000s of years), which is the period\nbe-tween significant earthquakes. In areas with more frequent\nearthquakes and more measured earthquake data, trenches are less\nnecessary. A long hiatus in earthquake activity could indicate the\nbuildup of stress on a specific segment of a fault with strain held in\nplace by friction, which would indicate a higher probability of an\nearthquake along that segment. This hiatus of seismic activity along\na length of a fault (i.e., a fault that is locked and not having any\nearthquakes) is known as a seismic gap.\nSecondary Hazards Caused by 450 | 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK\nEarthquakes Liquefaction\nLiquefaction is when saturated unconsolidated sediments (usually\nsilt or sand) is liquefied from shaking. Shaking causes loss of\ncohesion between grains of sediment, reducing the effective stress\nresistance of the sediment. The sediment flows very much like the\nquicksand presented in movies. Liquefaction creates sand\nvolcanoes, which is when liquefied sand is squirted through an\noverlying (usually finer-grained) layer, creating cone-shaped sand\nfeatures. It may also cause buildings to settle or tilt.\nEarthquake-induced tsunamis have caused many of the more recent\ndevastating natural disasters. Tsunamis form when earthquakes\noffset the seafloor in the ocean subsurface. This offset can be caused\nby fault movement or underwater landslides and lifts a volume of\nocean water generating the tsunami wave. Tsunami waves travel fast\nwith low amplitude in deep ocean water but are significantly\namplified as the water shallows as they approach the shore. When a\ntsunami is about to strike land, the water in front of the wave along\nthe shore will recede significantly, tragically causing curious people\nto wander out. This receding water is the drawback of the trough in\nfront of the tsunami wave, which then crashes onshore as a wall of\nwater upwards of a hundred feet high. Warning systems have been\nestablished to help mitigate the loss of life caused by tsunamis.\nLandslides\nShaking can trigger landslides (see landslide section for more\ninformation). One example is the 1992 magnitude 5.9 earthquake\nin St. George, Utah. This earthquake caused the Spring-dale 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK | 451\nlandslide, having a scarp that offset and destroyed several structures\nin the Balanced Rock Hills subdivision.\nSeiches\nSeiches are waves on lakes generated by earthquakes, which cause\nsloshing of water back and forth and, sometimes, even changes in\nelevation of the lake. A seich in Hebgen Lake during the 1959\nearthquake caused significant destruction to structures and roads\naround the lake.\nLand Elevation Changes\nSignificant subsidence and upheaval of the land can occur about the\nslippage that causes earthquakes. Land elevation changes are the\nresult of the relaxation of stress and subsequent movement along\nthe fault plane. The 1964 Alaska earthquake is an excellent example\nof this. Where the fault cuts the surface, the elevation of one side\ncauses a fault scarp that maybe a few feet to 20 or 30 feet in height.\nThe Wasatch Mountains represent an accumulation of fault scarps\nof a couple of dozen feet at a time over a few million years.\nHuman-Induced Earthquakes\nCan humans create earthquakes? Not intentionally, but the answer\nis yes, and here is why. If a water reservoir is built on top of an active\nfault line, the water may lubricate the fault and weaken the stress\nbuilt up within it. This may either create a series of small\nearthquakes or potentially create a massive earthquake. Also, the 452 | 4.4 EARTHQUAKE RISK\nsheer weight of the reservoir r\u2019s water can weaken the bedrock\ncausing it to fracture. Then the obvious concern is if the dam fails.\nEarthquakes can also be generated if humans inject other fluids into\na fault, such as sew-age or chemical waste. Finally, nuclear\nexplosions can trigger earthquakes. One way to determine if a\nnation has tested a nuclear bomb is by monitoring the earthquakes\nand energy released by the explosion. 4.5 VOLCANISM\nMagma Generation\nMagma and lava contain three components \u2013 melt, solids, and\nvolatiles (dissolved gases). The liquid part, called melt, is made of\nions from minerals that have already melted. The solid part, called\nsolids, are crystals of minerals that have not melted (higher melting\ntemperature) and are floating in the melt. Volatiles are gaseous\ncomponents dissolved in the magma, such as water vapor, carbon\ndioxide, sulfur, and chlorine. The presence and amount of these\nthree components affect the physical behavior of the magma.

This heat inside the Earth is caused by\nresidual heat left over from the original formation of Earth and\nradioactive decay. The rate at which temperature increases with\ndepth is called the geothermal gradient. The average geothermal\ngradient in the upper 100 kilometers of the crust is generally about\n25 degrees Celsius per kilometer (km). So, for every kilometer of\ndepth, the temperature increases by about 25 degrees Celsius. (4\nIgneous Processes and Volcanoes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology,\nn.d.) 4.5 VOLCANISM | 455\n\u201cGeothermal Gradient\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.\nDecompression Melting\nMagma is created at the mid-ocean ridge by decompression melting.\nThe mantle is solid but is slowly flowing under enormous pressure\nand temperatures due to convection. Rock is not a good conductor\nof heat, so as mantle rock rises, the pressure is reduced along with\nthe melting point (the green line), but the rock temperature\nremains about the same, and the rising rock begins to melt. Pressure\nchanges instantaneously as the rock rises, but temperature changes 456 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nslowly because of the low heat conductivity of rock. In the figure\nabove, setting B: mid-ocean ridge shows a mass of mantle rock at a\npressure-temperature X on the P-T diagram and its geographical\nlocation on the cross-section under a mid-ocean ridge. At this\nlocation, the P-T diagram shows the red arrow increasing to the\nright. Thus, hotter rock is now shallower, at a lower pressure, and\nthe new geothermal gradient (red line) shifts past the solidus (green\nline) and melting starts. As this magma continues to rise at\ndivergent boundaries and encounters seawater, it cools and\ncrystallizes to form new lithospheric crust. (4 Igneous Processes and\nVolcanoes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nFlux Melting\nAnother way that rocks melt is when volatile gases (e.g., water\nvapor) are added to mantle rock from a descending subducting slab\nin a process called flux melting (or fluid-induced melting). The\nsubducting slab contains oceanic lithosphere and hydrated\nminerals. As the slab descends and slowly increases in temperature,\nvolatiles are expelled from these hydrated minerals, like squeezing\nwater out of a sponge. The volatiles then rises into the overlying\nasthenospheric mantle, which lowers the melting point of the\nperidotite minerals (olivine and pyroxene). The pressure and\ntemperature of the overlying mantle rock do not change, but the\naddition of volatiles lowers the melting temperature. This is\nanalogous to adding salt to an icy roadway. The salt lowers the\nmelting\/crystallization temperature of the solid water (ice) so that it\nmelts. Another example is welders adding flux to lower the melting\npoint of their welding materials. 4.5 VOLCANISM | 457\nFlux melting is illustrated in setting D: island arc (subduction zone)\nof the P-T diagram above. Volatiles added to mantle rock at\nlocation \u201cZ\u201d act as a flux to lower the melting temperature. This is\nshown in the P-T diagram by the solidus (green line) shifting to the\nleft. The solidus line moves past the geothermal gradient (red line),\nand melting begins. Magmas producing the volcanoes of the Ring\nof Fire, associated with the circum-Pacific subduction zones, are a\nresult of flux melting. As introduced in the minerals chapter, water\nions can bond with other ions in the crystal structures of amphibole\n(and other silicates), which is essential in considering how magmas\nform in subduction zones by \u201cflux melting.\u201d Such hydrated\nminerals in subducting slabs contribute water to the flux melting\nprocess.

The eruption killed 57\npeople, destroyed 250 homes, and swept away 47 bridges. Mount\nSt. Helens today still has minor earthquakes and eruptions, and\nnow has a horseshoe-shaped crater with a lava dome inside. The\ndome is formed of viscous lava that oozes into place.\nIt should first be noted that magma is molten material inside the\nearth, while lava is molten on the earth\u2019s surface. The reason for the\ndistinction is because lava can cool quickly from the air and solidify\ninto rock rapidly, while magma may never reach the earth\u2019s surface.\nVolcanoes do not always erupt in the same way. Each volcanic\neruption is unique, differing in size, style, and composition of the\nerupted material. One key to what makes the eruption unique is the\nchemical composition of the magma that feeds a volcano, which\ndetermines (1) the eruption style, (2) the type of volcanic cone that\nforms, and (3) the composition of rocks that are found at the\nvolcano.\nDifferent minerals within rocks melt at different temperatures, and\nthe amount of partial melting and the composition of the original\nrock determine the magma\u2019s composition. Magma collects in\nmagma chambers in the crust at 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath\nthe surface of a volcano.\nThe words that describe the composition of igneous rocks also\ndescribe magma composition. Mafic magmas are low in silica and\nhave darker magnesium, and iron-rich mafic minerals, such as 4.5 VOLCANISM | 459\nolivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and have\nlighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The\nhigher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity.\nViscosity is a liquid\u2019s resistance to flow.\nViscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not\nviscous and will flow smoothly to the surface. Felsic magma is\nviscous and does not flow smoothly. Most felsic magma will stay\ndeeper in the crust and will cool to form intrusive igneous rocks\nsuch as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma\nchamber, it may be too viscous to move, and so it gets stuck.\nDissolved gases become trapped by thick magma, and the magma\nchamber begins to build pressure.\nExplosive Eruptions\nThe type of magma in the chamber determines the type of volcanic\neruption. A massive explosive eruption creates even more\ndevastation than the force of the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki\nat the end of World War II, in which more than 40,000 people died.\nA massive explosive volcanic eruption is 10,000 times as powerful.\nFelsic magmas erupt explosively because of hot, gas-rich magma\nchurning within its chamber. The pressure becomes so great that\nthe magma eventually breaks the seal and explodes, just like when a\ncork is released from a champagne bottle. Magma, rock, and ash\nburst upward in an enormous explosion creating volcanic ash called\ntephra. It should be noted that when looked under a microscope,\nthe volcanic \u201cash\u201d is actual microscopic shards of glass. That is why\nit is so dangerous to inhale the air following an eruption. 460 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\n\u201cVolcanic Ash Dunes\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International.\nScorching hot tephra, ash, and gas may speed down the volcano\u2019s\nslopes at 700 km\/h (450 mph) as a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic\nflows knock down everything in their path. The temperature inside\na pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800\ndegrees Fahrenheit). Before the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980,\nthe Lassen Peak eruption on May 22, 1915, was the most recent\nCascade eruption. A column of ash and gas shot 30,000 feet into\nthe air. This triggered a high-speed pyroclastic flow, which melted\nsnow and created a volcanic mudflow known as a lahar. Lassen Peak\ncurrently has geothermal activity and could erupt explosively again.\nMt. Shasta, the other active volcano in California, erupts every 600\nto 800 years. An eruption would create a large pyroclastic flow, and\nprobably a lahar. Of course, Mt. Shasta could explode and collapse\nlike Mt. Mazama in Oregon. 4.5 VOLCANISM | 461\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Although the\npressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt\nwith the same explosive force as felsic magma. People can usually be\nevacuated before an effusive eruption, so they are much less deadly.\nMagma pushes toward the surface through fissures and reaches the\nsurface through volcanic vents. Click here to view a lava stream\nwithin the vent of a Hawaiian volcano using a thermal camera.\nLow-viscosity lava flows down mountainsides. Differences in\ncomposition and where the lavas erupt result in lava types like a 4.5 VOLCANISM | 463\nropy form pahoehoe and a chunky form called aa. Although\neffusive eruptions rarely kill anyone, they can be destructive. Even\nwhen people know that a lava flow is approaching, there is not\nmuch anyone can do to stop it from destroying a building, road, or\ninfrastructure.\n\u201cPahoehoe Lava\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International. 464 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nVolcano Features and Types\n\u201cVolcano Structure\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nA volcano occurs where lava erupts at the surface and solidifies into\nrock. There are several types of volcanoes based on their shape,\neruption style, magmatic composition, and other aspects. The most\nmassive craters are called a caldera, such as the Crater Lake Caldera\nin Oregon. Many volcanic features are produced by viscosity, a\nfundamental property of lava. Viscosity is the resistance to flowing\nby a fluid. Low viscosity magma flows easily more like syrup, the\nbasaltic volcanism that occurs in Hawaii on shield volcanoes. High\nviscosity means a sticky magma, typically felsic or intermediate, that\nflows slowly, like toothpaste.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=387\nShield Volcanoes\nThe largest volcano is a shield volcano and is characterized by\nbroad, low-angle flanks, a small vent, or groups of vents at the top,\nand basaltic magma. The name \u201cshield\u201d comes from the side view\nresembling a medieval warrior\u2019s shield. They are typically associated\nwith hotspots, midocean ridges, or continental rifts where upper\nmantle material rises, and build up slowly from many low-viscosity\nbasaltic lava flows that can travel long distances, hence making the\nlow-angle flanks. Because the magma is basaltic and low viscosity,\nthe eruption style is not explosive but rather effusive, meaning that 466 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nvolcanic eruptions are small, localized, and predictable. Therefore,\nthis eruption style is not typically much of a hazard.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=387\nMauna Loa (info) and the more active Kilauea (info) in Hawaii are\ngood examples of vents on a shield volcano. The eruption of\nKilauea from fissures in Hawaii in 2018, while not explosive,\nproduced viscous lavas that did considerable damage to roads and\nstructures. Shield volcanoes are also found in Iceland, the\nGalapagos Islands, Northern California, Oregon, and the East\nAfrican Rift (USGS, 2011). 4.5 VOLCANISM | 467\n\u201cHawaiian Islands\u201d by NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory is licensed under\nPublic Domain.\nBasaltic magma can form several rock types and unique landforms.\nBased on magma temperature, composition, and content of\ndissolved gases and water vapor, there are two main types of basaltic\nvolcanic rocks with Hawaiian names \u2013 pahoehoe and aa. Pahoehoe\nis a basaltic magma that flows smoothly into a \u201cropey\u201d appearance.\nIn contrast, aa (sometimes spelled a\u2019a or \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 and pronounced \u201cah-\nah\u201d) has a crumbly blocky appearance. (Peterson and Tilling 1980).\nFelsic silica-rich lavas also form aa flows.\nIn basaltic lava flows, the low viscosity lava can smoothly flow,\nand it tends to harden on the outside but continue to flow\ninternally within a tube. Once the interior flowing lava subsides, the\ntube may be left as an empty lava tube. Lava tubes famously make 468 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\ncaves (with or without collapsed roofs) in Hawaii, Northern\nCalifornia, the Columbia River Basalt Plateau of Washington and\nOregon, El Malpais National Monument in New Mexico, and\nCraters of the Moon National Monument in Idaho. Fissures, cracks\nthat originate from shield-style eruptions, are also common.\nMagmas from fissures are typically very fluid and mafic. The\nvolcanic activity itself causes some fissures, and some can be\ninfluenced by tectonics, such as the common fissures parallel to the\ndivergent boundary in Iceland. See above for fissure flows from\nKilauea in 2018.\nSince basalt flows are thick accumulations of lava with a\nhomogeneous composition that flows quickly when the lava begins\nto cool, it can contract into columns with a hexagonal cross-section\ncalled columnar jointing. This feature is common in basaltic lava\nflows but can be found in more felsic lavas and tuffs. (4 Igneous\nProcesses and Volcanoes \u2013 An Introduction to Geology, n.d.)\nCinder Cones\nCinder cones are small volcanoes with steep sides, made of cinders\nand volcanic bombs ejected from a clear central vent. Typically, they\ncome from mafic lavas that have high volatile content. Cinders form\nwhen hot lava is ejected into the air, cooling and solidifying before\nthey reach the flank of the volcano. The largest cinders are called\nvolcanic bombs. Cinder cones form in short-lived eruption events\nthat are common in the western United States.\nA recent and striking example of a short-lived cinder cone is the\n1943 eruption near Par\u00edcutin, Mexico. The cinder cone started with 4.5 VOLCANISM | 469\nan explosive eruption shooting cinders out of a vent in the middle\nof a farmer\u2019s field. Quickly, volcanism continued building the cone\nto a height of over 300 feet in a week and 1,200 feet in the first eight\nmonths. After the initial explosive gases and cinders were released,\ngrowing the cone, basaltic lava poured out around the base of the\ncone. This order of events is typical for cinder cones: first violent\neruption, then the formation of cone and crater, followed by a low-\nviscosity lava flow from the base (the cone of cinders is not strong\nenough to support a column of lava rising to the top of the crater).\nThe Par\u00edcutin cinder cone was built over nine years and covered\nabout 100-square miles with ashes and destroyed the town of San\nJuan.\n\u201cGroundhog Cinder Cone\u201d by the United States Department of\nAgriculture is licensed under Public Domain. 470 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nLava Domes\nLava domes are a relatively small accumulation of silica-rich\nvolcanic rocks, such as rhyolite and obsidian, that is too viscous to\nflow, and therefore, pile high close to the vent. The domes often\nform within the collapsed crater of a stratovolcano near the vent\nand grow by expansion from within. As it grows, its outer surface\ncools and hardens, then shatters, spilling loose fragments down its\nsides. An excellent example of a lava dome is inside of a collapsed\nstratovolcano crater is Mount Saint Helens. Examples of a stand-\nalone lava dome are Chaiten in Chile and the Mammoth Mountain\nin California.

Crater Lake, Yellowstone, and Long\nValley Caldera are good examples. At Crater Lake National Park in\nOregon, about 6,800 years ago, Mount Mazama was a composite\nvolcano that erupted in a sizeable explosive blast, ejecting massive\nvolcanic ash. The eruption rapidly drained the underlying magma 474 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nchamber causing the top to collapse into it, forming a significant\ndepression that later filled with water.

The prefix \u201cinter-\u201d means \u201cbetween.\u201d In\ncontrast, some volcanoes are not associated with plate boundaries\nbut are found within the plate far from plate boundaries. These are\ncalled intraplate volcanoes, and hotspots and fissure eruptions form\nmany. The prefix \u201cintra-\u201d means \u201cwithin.\u201d The following discusses\nvolcanism\u2019s location in more detail with mid-ocean ridges,\nsubduction zones, continental rifts representing interplate\nvolcanism, and hot spots representing intraplate volcanism. 4.5 VOLCANISM | 481\nVolcanoes along Mid-Oceanic Ridges\nAlthough most volcanism occurs on the ocean floor along the mid-\nocean ridge (a type of divergent plate boundary), they are the least\nobserved since most are under 10,000 to 15,000 feet of ocean, an\nexception being Iceland. As the oceanic plates diverge and thin, hot\nmantle rock is allowed to rise, pressure from depth is released,\nwhich causes the ultramafic mantle rock (peridotite) to melt\npartially. The resulting magma is basaltic in composition based on\nthe concept of partial melting discussed earlier. Because most\nvolcanoes on the ocean floor are basaltic, most of the oceanic\nlithosphere is also basaltic near the surface with phaneritic gabbro\nand ultramafic peridotite forming underneath. Icelandic volcanism\nis an example of this, but lying above sea level.\nAn underwater volcanic eruption occurs when basaltic magma\nerupts underwater, forming pillow basalts or in small explosive\neruptions. Lava erupting into seawater forms pillow-shaped\nstructures, hence the name. In association with these seafloor\neruptions, an entire underwater ecosystem thrives in parts of the\nmid-ocean ridge. This ecosystem exists around tall vents emitting\nblack, hot mineral-rich water called deep-sea hydrothermal vents\n(also known as black smokers).\nThis hot water, up to 380 degrees Celsius (716 degrees Fahrenheit),\nis heated by the magma and dissolves many elements that support\nthe ecosystem. Deep underwater where the sun cannot reach, this\necosystem of organisms depends on the heat of the vent for energy\nand vent chemicals as its foundation of life called chemosynthesis.\nThe foundation of the ecosystem is hydrogen sulfide-oxidizing 482 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\nbacteria that live symbiotically with the larger organisms. Hydrogen\nsulfide (H2S, the gas that smells like rotten eggs) needed by these\nbacteria is contained in the volcanic gases emitted from the\nhydrothermal vents. The source of most of this sulfur and other\nelements is the Earth\u2019s interior.

Wherever mantle can melt, volcanoes may be the\nresult. Volcanoes erupt because mantle rock melts. The first stage in\ncreating a volcano is when mantle rock begins to melt because of 4.5 VOLCANISM | 483\nscorching temperatures, lithospheric pressure lowers, or water is\nadded.\nSubduction Zones\nDuring the process of subduction, water is expelled from the\nhydrated minerals causing partial melting by flux melting in the\noverlying mantle rock. This creates a mafic magma that rises\nthrough the lithosphere and can change the composition by\ninteracting with surrounding continental crust as well as by magma\ndifferentiation. These changes then evolve basaltic magma into a\nmore silica-rich rock in volcanoes and plutons. These silica-rich\nrocks are felsic to intermediate rocks such as andesite, rhyolite,\npumice, and tuff. The Ring of Fire surrounding the Pacific Ocean\nis dominated by subduction and contains volcanoes with silica-rich\nmagma. These volcanoes are discussed in more detail in the\nstratovolcano section.\nLarge earthquakes are prevalent along convergent plate boundaries.\nSince the Pacific Ocean is rimmed by convergent and transform\nboundaries, 80 percent of all earthquakes occur around the Pacific\nOcean basin, called the Ring of Fire. A description of the Pacific\nRing of Fire along western North America is below:\n\u2022 Subduction at the Middle American Trench creates volcanoes\nin Central America.\n\u2022 The San Andreas Fault is a transform boundary.\n\u2022 Subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath the North\nAmerican plate creates the Cascade volcanoes like Mount St.\nHelens, Mount Rainer, Mount Hood, and more. 484 | 4.5 VOLCANISM\n\u2022 Subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American\nplate in the north creates the long chain of the Aleutian\nIslands volcanoes near Alaska.\nMt.

The thinning allows for some of the lower crustal rocks\nor upper mantle rocks to rise, releasing some pressure and causing\npartial melting. The magma generated is less dense than the\nsurrounding rock and rises through the crust to the surface,\nerupting as basalt. These basaltic eruptions are usually in the form\nof flood basalts, cinder cones, and basaltic lava flows. For example,\nyoung cinder cones are found in south-central Utah, the Black 4.5 VOLCANISM | 485\nRock Desert Volcanic Field, which is part of the Basin and Range\ncrustal extension. The 1-minute video (below) illustrates volcanism\nin the Basin and Range Province. These Utah cinder cones and lava\nflows started erupting 6 million years ago with the last volcanic\neruption 720 years ago. (4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nHotspots\nThe primary source of intraplate volcanism is hotspots. Hotspots\noccur when lithospheric plates glide over a hot mantle plume, an\nascending column of hot rock (solid, not magma) originating from\ndeep within the mantle. A chain of ancient volcanoes formerly\nactive but now inactive for millions of years can be seen on the\nseafloor or on continents, which leads to an active intraplate\nvolcano, indicating hotspot volcanism. The Pacific oceanic plate\noverrode a hotspot mantle plume producing a long volcanic island\nchain beginning with the Emperor Seamounts in the northwest\nPacific and terminating at the Hawaiian Islands with currently\nactive volcanoes. When the North American continental plate\noverrode a mantle plume hotspot, a chain of ancient volcanic\ncalderas formed extending from Southwestern Idaho to the\nYellowstone caldera.

Think of the Bowen\u2019s Reaction Series and the\ntemperatures of the magmas that contain the respective minerals. If\nhot mafic magma rises beneath felsic continental crust spreads into\na head below the felsic boundary, the higher heat of the mafic\nmagma may cause the felsic rock above it to melt. There may be\nmixing of the mafic material from below with the felsic above to\nform intermediate magmas, or the felsic magma may melt and rise\nhigher, forming granitic batholiths or even emerging as a felsic\nvolcano. Such felsic (granitic) batholiths lie at the core of the Sierra\nNevada Mountains and comprise Yosemite\u2019s dramatic features.\nSince most mantle plumes are beneath the oceanic lithosphere,\nvolcanism\u2019s initial stages typically take place on the seafloor. Over\ntime, basaltic volcanoes may form islands like those in Hawaii. If\nthe hotspot is under the continental lithosphere, magma of more 4.5 VOLCANISM | 487\nfelsic to intermediate (silica-rich) composition rises into an\nexplosive volcano like Mt. St. Helens or the Yellowstone caldera. 4.6 PREDICTING\nERUPTIONS AND RISK\nPredicting Volcanic Eruptions\nVolcanologists try to forecast volcanic eruptions, but this has proven\nto be as difficult as predicting an earthquake. Many pieces of\nevidence can mean that a volcano is about to erupt, but the time\nand magnitude of the eruption are challenging to pin down. This\nevidence includes the history of previous volcanic activity,\nearthquakes, slope deformation, and gas emissions.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=390\nHistory of Volcanic Activity\nA volcano\u2019s history, how long since its last eruption and the period\nbetween its previous eruptions, is an excellent first step to predicting\neruptions. If the volcano is considered active, it is currently erupting\nor shows signs of erupting soon. A dormant volcano means there\nis no current activity, but it has erupted recently. Finally, an extinct\nvolcano means there is no activity and will probably not erupt again.\nActive and dormant volcanoes are heavily monitored, especially in\npopulated areas. (Volcanic Eruptions | Earth Science, n.d.) 490 | 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK\nEarthquakes\nMoving magma shakes the ground, so the number and size of\nearthquakes increase before an eruption. A volcano that is about\nto erupt may produce a sequence of earthquakes. Scientists use\nseismographs that record each earthquake\u2019s length and strength to\ndetermine if an eruption is imminent.\nMagma and gas can push the volcano\u2019s slope upward. Most ground\ndeformation is subtle and can only be detected by tiltmeters, which\nare instruments that measure the angle of a volcano\u2019s slope.\nHowever, ground swelling may sometimes create considerable\nchanges in the shape of a volcano. Mount St. Helens grew a bulge\non its north side before its 1980 eruption. Ground swelling may also\nincrease rockfalls and landslides. (Volcanoes | Earth Science, n.d.)\nGas Emissions\nGases may be able to escape a volcano before magma reaches the\nsurface. Scientists measure gas emissions in vents on or around the\nvolcano. Gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2),\nhydrochloric acid (HCl), and even water vapor, can be measured\nat the site or, in some cases, from a distance using satellites. The\namounts of gases and their ratios are calculated to help predict\neruptions. (Volcanoes | Earth Science, n.d.)\nRemote Monitoring\nSome aspects of volcanic monitoring can be monitored using\nsatellite technology. Satellites also monitor temperature readings and 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 491\ndeformation. As technology improves, scientists are better able to\ndetect changes in a volcano accurately and safely. Since\nvolcanologists are usually uncertain about an eruption, officials may\nnot know whether to require evacuation. If people are evacuated,\nand the eruption does not happen, the people will be displeased and\nless likely to evacuate the next time there is a threat of an eruption.\nThe costs of disrupting business are high. However, scientists\ncontinue to work to improve the accuracy of their predictions.\nVolcanic Hazards\nVolcanoes are responsible for a large number of deaths. Volcanic\nhazards have been famous for centuries, but recent eruptions are\nbetter documented. The most apparent hazard is the lava itself\nwithin a lava flow, but volcanic hazards go far beyond a lava flow.\nFor example, on May 18, 1980, Mount Saint Helens erupted with\nan explosion and landslide that removed the upper 1,300 feet (400\nm) of the mountain. This explosion was immediately followed by a\nlateral blast and pyroclastic flow [23] covering 230 square miles of\nforest with ash and debris. The effects of the blast are shown on the\nbefore and after images. The pyroclastic flow (see below) moved at\nspeeds of 50 \u2013 80 miles per hour (80-130 km\/hr), flattened trees,\nand ejected a giant ash cloud into the air. Watch the 7-minute USGS\nvideo for an account of May 18, 1980, which killed 57. Pyroclastic\nflows are common in explosive eruptions of stratovolcanoes.\nIn 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius, located near Naples, Italy, violently\nerupted, sending a pyroclastic flow over the Roman countryside,\nincluding the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. The buried 492 | 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK\ntowns were discovered in an archeological expedition in the 18th\ncentury. Pompeii famously contains the remains (casts) of people\nsuffocated by ash and covered by 10 feet (3 m) of ash, pumice lapilli,\nand collapsed roofs. (4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.)\nPyroclastic Flows\nThe most dangerous volcanic hazard are pyroclastic flows. These\nflows are a mix of lava blocks, pumice, ash, and hot gases between\n400 to 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The turbulent cloud of ash and gas\nraces down the steep flanks at high speeds up to 120 mph (much\nfaster than people can run) into the valleys around composite\nvolcanoes. Most explosive, silica-rich, high viscosity magma\nvolcanoes such as composite cones usually have pyroclastic flows.\nThe rock tuff and welded tuff is often formed from these pyroclastic\nflows.\nThere are numerous examples of deadly pyroclastic flows. In 2014,\nthe Mount Ontake pyroclastic flow in Japan killed 47 people. The\nflow was caused by magma heating groundwater into steam, which\nthen rapidly ejected with ash and volcanic bombs. Some were killed\nby inhalation of toxic gases and hot ash, while volcanic bombs struck\nothers. Two short videos below document the eyewitness video of\npyroclastic flows. In the early 1990s, Mount Unzen erupted several\ntimes with pyroclastic flows. The pyroclastic flow shown in this\nshort video killed 41 people. In 1902, on the Caribbean Island\nMartinique, Mount Pelee erupted with a violent pyroclastic flow\nthat destroyed the entire town of St. Pierre and killing 28,000 people 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 493\nin moments.

They form from\nthe rapid melting of snow or glaciers on volcanoes. They are like a\nslurry of concrete but can flow up to 50 mph while still on the steep\nflanks. Since lahars are slurry-like, they can travel long distances in\nriver valleys like a flash flood.\nDuring the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption, lahars reached\n17-miles (27 km) down the North Fork of the Toutle River. 494 | 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK\nPrehistoric lahar flows have been mapped at significant vol-canoes\nsuch as Mount Rainier near Tacoma, Washington (Rosi et al. 1999).\nPrehistoric lahars occupied river floodplains where large cities are\nfound today, as shown on the map. Similarly, Mount Baker poses\na hazard as shown by this hazard map for Mount Baker north of\nSeattle, Washington. A recent scenario played out when a lahar from\nthe volcano Nevado del Ruiz Colombia, buried a town in 1985 and\nkilled an estimated 25,000 people.\n\u201cLahar off Mount St. Helens\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey\nis licensed under Public Domain.\nLandslides and Landslide-Generated\nTsunamis\nThe flanks of a volcano are steep and unstable, which can lead to\nslope failure and generate dangerous landslides. For example, the\nlandslide at Mount St. Helens 1980 released a considerable amount\nof materials as the entire north flank collapsed. The landslide moved 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 495\nat speeds of 100-180 mph. Movement of magma, explosive\neruptions, massive earthquakes, and heavy rainfall can trigger these\nlandslides. In unique situations, the landslide material can reach\nwater and cause a tsunami. In 1792 in Japan, Mount Unzen erupted,\ncausing a giant landslide that reached the Ariake Sea and made a\ntsunami that killed 15,000 people on the opposite shore.\nTephra and Ash\nVolcanoes, mainly composite volcanoes, eject substantial amounts\nof tephra (ejected rock materials) and ash (fragments less than 2 mm\nor 0.08 inches. Tephra is heavier and falls closer to the vent. Larger\nblocks and bombs pose hazards to those close to the eruption, such\nas at the 2014 Mount Ontake disaster in Japan discussed earlier.\nAsh is fine and can be carried long distances away from the vent,\nand can cause building collapses and respiratory issues like silicosis.\nHot ash can be dangerous to those close to the eruption and disrupt\nservices such as airline transportation farther away. For example, in\n2010, the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland created a giant ash cloud\nin the upper atmosphere that caused the most significant air travel\ndisruption in northern Europe since a seven-day airline shut down\nduring World War II. No one was hurt, but the cost to the world\neconomy was estimated to be billions of dollars.

As rising magma reaches the\nsurface, the confining pressure decreases, allowing gases to escape,\nlike gases coming out of solution after opening a soda bottle.\nTherefore, volcanoes, when not erupting, release hazardous gases\nsuch as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen\nsulfide (H2S), and hydrogen halides (HF, HCl, or HBr). Carbon\ndioxide can sink and accumulate in low-lying depressions on the\nearth\u2019s surface. Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort in Mammoth\nLakes, California, is located within the Long Valley Caldera.\nTherefore, the whole ski resort and town are within the caldera. In\n2006, three ski patrol members were killed after skiing into snow\ndepressions near fumaroles filled with carbon dioxide (info). 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 497\nTherefore, in volcanic areas where carbon dioxide emissions occur,\navoid low-lying areas that may trap carbon dioxide.\nIn rare cases, a volcano can suddenly release gases without warning.\nCalled a limnic eruption, this commonly occurs in crater lakes as\ngases pour from the water. It infamously occurred in 1986 in Lake\nNyos, Cameroon, killing almost 2,000 people due to carbon dioxide\nasphyxiation.\nVolcanic Monitoring\nVolcano monitoring requires geologists to use many instruments to\ndetect changes that may indicate an eruption is imminent. Some of\nthe main observations include regular monitoring for earthquakes\n(including unique vibrational earthquakes called harmonic tremors,\ncaused by magma movement), changes in the orientation and\nelevation of the land surface, and an increase in gas emissions. 498 | 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=390\nVolcanic Landforms and\nGeothermal Activity\nVolcanic Landforms and Vents\nVolcanoes are associated with many types of landforms. The\nlandforms vary with the composition of the magma that created\nthem. Hot springs and geysers are also examples of surface features\nrelated to volcanic activity.\nThe most apparent landforms created by lava are volcanoes, most 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 499\ncommonly as cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield\nvolcanoes or eruptions that take place through fissures. The\neruptions that created the entire ocean floor are fissure eruptions.\nMagma intrusions ALSO can create landforms. The image on the\nright is of Shiprock in New Mexico, which is the neck of an old\nvolcano that has eroded.\nLava Domes\nWhen lava is viscous, it flows slowly. If there is not enough magma\nor enough pressure to create an explosive eruption, the magma may\nform a lava dome. However, because the magma\u2019s viscosity is so\nthick, the lava does not flow far from the volcanic vent. Lava flows\noften make mounds right in the middle of craters at the top of\nvolcanoes.\nLava Plateaus and Land\nA lava plateau forms when enormous amounts of fluid lava flow\nover an extensive area. When the lava solidifies, it creates a large,\nflat surface of the igneous rock. Lava creates new land as it solidifies\non the coast or emerges from beneath the water. Over time the\neruptions can create whole islands. The Hawaiian Islands are formed\nfrom shield volcano eruptions that have grown over the last 5 million\nyears.\nHot Springs and Geysers\nWater sometimes encounters the hot rock. The water may emerge at\nthe surface as either a hot spring or a geyser. Water heated below 500 | 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK\nground that rises through a crack to the surface creates a hot spring.\nThe water in hot springs may reach temperatures in the hundreds of\ndegrees Celsius beneath the surface, although most hot springs are\nmuch cooler.\nBenefits of Volcanic Activity\nThere are many benefits to volcanic activity. One of the significant\nbenefits is the fact that volcanic activity can create very fertile soil for\nagriculture. The problem is that many civilizations developed near\nvolcanoes for this reason \u2013 with sometimes deadly effects. Volcanic\nactivity can also create many mineral resources such as gold, silver,\nnickel, copper, and lead. Volcanic rock is often used for landscaping,\ntile, and cement.\nSome of the most amazing landscapes are near volcanoes because\nvolcanic activity builds land creating, breathtaking scenery.\nVolcanoes are economically vital for many regions because of the\nrecreational activity and tourism they bring.\nFinally, a new but essential trend is geothermal power. The heat\ngenerated by volcanoes can create electricity to power civilization.\nGeothermal power is an entirely renewable resource free of pollution\nand energy dependence from fossil fuels. Iceland \u2013 the surface\nmanifestation of the mid-Atlantic ridge \u2013 has a goal of powering the\nentire nation on geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is also being\nused in California, Kilauea, Hawaii, and now Utah. 4.6 PREDICTING ERUPTIONS AND RISK | 501\n\u201cGeothermal Energy\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\n\u201cNesjavelli\nr Power\nStation in\nSouthwest\nIceland\u201d is\nlicensed\nunder\nPublic\nDomain. 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nMost people never thought much about tsunamis until the\ncataclysmic event that occurred on December 26, 2004, in\nIndonesia. Tsunami is a Japanese term that means \u201charbor wave\u201d.\nThere are four significant ways tsunamis form: underwater\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, or extraterrestrial\nimpacts such as asteroids. These four seismic events will be looked\nat in greater detail in a minute. The formation of a tsunami by these\ncatastrophic events is called tsunami initiation.\n\u201cAerial of Sukuiso, Japan\u201d by the United States Navy is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nNow once a tsunami is generated, it will travel outward in a circular\nradius from the tsunami epicenter at speeds of 500 mph. However,\nthe height of each wave crest in the deep ocean is only 2-3 feet; thus, 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 503\nlarge ships never feel tsunamis in the deep ocean. It is essential to\nstop here and briefly discuss the physics of energy traveling through\nwater. First, a wave of water is called a wave \u2013 that was easy! Next,\nthe distance between two wave peaks or heights is called a\nwavelength. The frequency is when it takes one wavelength\n(distance between two wave peaks) to pass a given position. Thus,\nwaves with long wavelengths have low frequencies because it takes a\nlong time for the wave to cross a given point. Waves that have short\nwavelengths have high frequencies.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=400\nHave you ever watched an object floating in the water as a wave\npasses by it? Let\u2019s say it is a stick in the ocean. Now when that wave\npasses by, the stick does not travel with the wave; rather, the stick 504 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nbops up and down but stays relatively in the same place. That is\nbecause the water does not travel with the wave\u2019s energy; instead,\nthe energy passes through the water causing the water to travel in a\ncircle (which appears as an up, slightly forward, down, and\nbackward motion). The depth of the circular size of motion\ngenerated by waves is half the distance from each wave crest. Thus if\nthe distance from one wave crest to the next wave crest is one mile,\nthe depth of the water\u2019s circular motion is half a mile. This is\nimportant because tsunamis have very long wavelengths; thus, their\ndepths reach the ocean floor.\nIt was noted above that the height of a tsunami is only a few feet\nhigh with very long wavelengths out in the deep ocean. This is\nbecause in the deep water, the amplitude of the waves is minimal,\nand the wavelengths quite large for anyone on a boat to notice. As\nthe tsunami approaches the shoreline, it begins to slow down and\ngrow taller because the friction between the oscillating tsunami\nwaves comes into more contact with the rising elevation of the\nseafloor. This friction causes the wave\u2019s amplitude to grow, the\nwavelength shortens (distance between each successive tsunami\nwave), and the frequency becomes shorter, causing the energy of the\ntsunami to grow taller. The height of a tsunami is called the run-\nup. Thus when a tsunami reaches the shore, it may have slowed to\n30-40 mph but dramatically higher. The size of the run-up is\ndetermined by the distance between the tsunami epicenter and the\nshoreline, the energy released by the tsunami initiation, and the\nsteepness of the continental slope. 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 505\n\u201cTsunami\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.\nTsunamis are also not a massive, single wave coming ashore; rather,\nthey are a series of powerful, rippling waves called a tsunami train.\nAs the waves approach shore, the shoreline frequently disappears as\nthe water is pulled back into the ocean to build up the waves. Many\npeople find this strange event enticing and go onto the beach to see\nthe fish flapping on the newly bare ground. However, this is a false\nsense of security, and within minutes the series of waves come\ncrashing ashore. Often, there can be up to ten individual tsunami\nwaves, and the most powerful waves tend to be the second or third\nwave. So if the water along the coastline disappears, people need to\nquickly gather their family and friends and head to higher ground. 506 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=400\nFormation of a Tsunami\nEarthquakes\nMost tsunamis occur because of powerful subduction zone such as\nthe Ring of Fire. Thus, most tsunamis are generated by a reverse\nfault or thrust fault earthquakes along subduction zones because of\nthe amount of water displaced by these events. However, not all\nreverse fault earthquakes can initiate tsunamis. The minimum\nmagnitude of an earthquake needed to create a tsunami is a 7.5; the\nAsian tsunami of 2004 was generated by a 9.1 magnitude thrust 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 507\nfault along an oceanic-to-oceanic subduction zone. Strike-slip faults\nalong transform boundaries do not generate tsunamis because their\nparallel movement does not displace enough water.\nThe potential for a tsunami striking the United States is very high\nfor a variety of reasons. One is because of the oceanic-to-continental\nsubduction zone in the northwestern states of Washington,\nOregon, and northern California. Recall from previous modules\nthat this subduction zone generates earthquakes, but has produced\nthe major volcanoes of the region such as Mount St. Helens, Mt.\nRainer, and Mt. Shasta. Research shows that ever few hundred\nyears, the region experiences a 9.0 magnitude earthquake generating\na significant tsunami that would reach coastal cities within 20\nminutes. There would be no time to evacuate the people in time.\nThe Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011 was the most documented\nnatural disaster in human history. 508 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=400\nVolcanoes\nLess common, but still a force to consider, are large, violent,\ncomposite volcanoes. There are a couple of ways a volcano can\ngenerate a tsunami. Sometimes just the energy released by the\nvolcano along with the pyroclastic flow can initiate a tsunami.\nOther times, a violent eruption can cause a portion of a volcano\u2019s\nslope to slide off into the ocean. The most dangerous way would be\nif a volcano explodes or collapses to generate a caldera in the ocean.\nThere are some real-world examples of this occurring. In 1883 on\nthe volcanic island of Krakatau (image on the right), a violent 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 509\neruption occurred, producing a tsunami that killed 35,000 people\nand destroyed two-thirds of the island. It is believed a massive\npyroclastic flow slammed into the ocean, producing a massive\ntsunami. Ultimately the eruption was so violent that the island\ncollapsed to produce a massive caldera of the former island.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=400\nA concern today is the volcanic islands off western Africa called the\nCanary Islands. Scientists are concerned with an unstable slope on\nthe western side of one of the volcanic islands. Their concern is that\na significant eruption could cause a portion of the slope to slide off\ninto the Atlantic Ocean, generating a massive tsunami. Within 9\nhours \u2013 traveling at 500 mph \u2013 this tsunami would reach the\neastern United States with a run-up of nearly 150 feet! 510 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nLast but not least is the major island of Mauna Loa, Hawaii.\nScientific studies of the former volcanic islands that use to be over\nthis hot spot show that shield volcanoes tend to grow fastest just\nbefore they move off the hot spot. Mauna Loa is the most active\nvolcano in the world and is about to move off the hot spot. A new\nvolcanic island is beginning to form underwater just east of the\nmain island. Studies show that the increased activity and lava flows\ncan destabilize portions of the slopes as more weight is added.\nFieldworks has discovered that Mauna Loa has had over 60 giant\ndebris avalanches that slide into the Pacific Ocean. These slides tend\nto be 10-20 miles long and could ultimately generate a tsunami 900\nfeet high.\nLandslides\nLarge scale landslides can also displace large amounts of water to\ngenerate massive tsunamis. Often, it is a volcanic eruption or\nearthquake that generates the landslide, which creates a tsunami.\nOne concern for the United States is an underwater landslide \u2013 a\nsubmarine landslide \u2013 off the eastern coast of the continental\nshelf can displace enough water to generate a 20-foot tsunami and\nreach the nation within 20 minutes. The most massive landslide\never recorded in human history happened in Lituya Bay, Alaska. A\nmagnitude 7.0 earthquake along the Denali Fault generated a\nmassive rockfall into the bay, which produced a 1,700-foot tsunami.\nHowever, the bay contained most of the energy, and thus a major\ncatastrophe was averted. Nevertheless, the concern is another such\nevent occurring in Glacier Bay, Alaska, which is a significant tourist\nattraction for cruise lines. 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 511\nAsteroid Impacts\nThe rarest, but most lethal tsunami would be generated by an\nasteroid or comet impact. If an asteroid were to make it through the\nearth\u2019s atmosphere, there is a 70 percent chance it would land in the\nocean. For example, an asteroid striking the Atlantic Ocean could\nproduce a tsunami that would cover over half of the nation. All\ncoastal cities around the world would also be destroyed.\nFurthermore, with 90 percent of all humans living near a large body\nof water, well, you see the impact! The last asteroid impact in the\nocean occurred 65 million years ago and produced a tsunami half a\nmile high.\n\u201cAsteroid\nImpact\u201d by\nReimund\nBetrams\nfrom\nPixabay.\nCoastal Impacts\nThere are a variety of coastal vulnerabilities caused by tsunamis. As\nnoted in previous modules, there are two types of effects of\ntsunamis (and all disasters). The primary effects are pretty straight\nforward. Areas at most risks of tsunamis are highly populated 512 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\ncoastal regions such as major cities. Moreover, if the tsunami occurs\nduring high tide, the fingers of destruction will reach farther inland.\nMost of the deaths from the Asian tsunami of 2004 were from\nflooding and the actual debris within the water. Other primary\neffects include coastal erosion and the destruction of ecosystems.\nThe following are aerial photographs of tsunamis from National\nGeographic.\n\u201cAerial View of Ache, Sumatra, Indonesia\u201d by the United States\nNavy is licensed under Public Domain.\nThe secondary effects of tsunamis are less noticeable. These\ninclude contaminated water sources, disease outbreaks, chemical\npollution, homelessness, and economic loss. Sometimes the\nsecondary effects are worse than the primary effects because all the\nnew attention occurs with the primary effects, but very little\nattention is on the region after a few months. 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 513\nMitigation Against Tsunamis\nPeople and ecosystems are quite resilient to natural disasters, but a\nlot must be done to prevent massive death and destruction, to begin\nwith. After a deadly tsunami in Hawaii in the 1950s, the United\nStates developed the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. If a 7.5\nmagnitude earthquake occurs somewhere in the Ring of Fire, a\ntsunami watch is released by NOAA, indicating that a seismic event\njust occurred that could have generated a tsunami. In the Pacific\nOcean, a system of instruments on the ocean floor and buoys\nmonitors the Pacific Ocean for tsunamis. If the system detects a\ntsunami, a signal is sent to satellites, which is then sent to coastal\nareas, and a tsunami warning is announced.\n\u201cUnderstanding Tsunami Alerts\u201d by the National Weather Service\nis licensed under Public Domain.\nAnother mitigation measure is tsunami run-up maps. A tsunami\nrun-up map indicates how far a tsunami will travel inland based on\nthe continental shelf and strength of the tsunami. By 514 | 4.7 TSUNAMIS\nunderstanding where and how far a tsunami will travel inland,\ngovernment agencies can determine proper zoning and building\ncodes. Before the Asian tsunami of 2004, the United States had\ntsunami run-up maps of Indonesia but were considered classified.\nIndonesia, being a more impoverished nation, did not have run-up\nmaps for their nation. After the catastrophic event, the U.S.\nmilitary saw how destabilizing this was to the nation and decided to\nrelease this information from the run-up maps to the region.\nOther ways the impacts of tsunamis can be minimized include:\n\u2022 Strong building codes and zoning policies that are enforced by\nlocal officials\n\u2022 Planting and protecting existing natural barriers such as\nvegetation and coastal areas\n\u2022 Proper education of how to prepare and what to do during\nand after a tsunami 4.7 TSUNAMIS | 515\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Most rocks are formed at some depth within\nthe crust except for volcanic rocks and some sedimentary rocks.\nThey experience relatively constant temperature, high pressure, no\ncontact with the atmosphere, and little or no moving water. Once a\nrock is exposed at the surface, which is what happens when the\noverlying rock is eroded, conditions change dramatically.\nTemperatures vary widely, there is much less pressure, oxygen and\nother gases are plentiful, and in most climates, water is abundant.\nWeathering includes two main processes that are entirely different.\nOne is the mechanical breakdown of rock into smaller fragments,\nand the other is the chemical change of the minerals within the rock\nto forms that are stable in the surface environment. Mechanical\nweathering provides fresh surfaces for attack by chemical processes,\nand chemical weathering weakens the rock so that it is more\nsusceptible to mechanical weathering. Together, these processes\ncreate two significant products, one being the sedimentary clasts\nand ions in solution that can eventually become sedimentary rock,\nand the other is the soil necessary for our existence on Earth. 528 | 5.1 WEATHERING\n\u201cBryce Canyon\u201d by Luca Galuzzi is licenced under Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic.\nMechanical Weathering\nIntrusive igneous rocks form at depths of several hundreds of\nmeters to several tens of kilometers. Sediments are turned into\nsedimentary rocks only when other sediments bury them to depths\nmore than several hundreds of meters. Most metamorphic rocks are\nformed at depths of kilometers to tens of kilometers. Weathering\ncannot even begin until these rocks are uplifted through various\nmountain-building processes \u2014 most of which are related to plate\ntectonics \u2014 and the overlying material has been eroded, and the\nrock is exposed as an outcrop. The critical agents of mechanical\nweathering are:\n\u2022 The decrease in pressure that results from the removal of 5.1 WEATHERING | 529\noverlying rock\n\u2022 Freezing and thawing of water in cracks in the rock\n\u2022 Formation of salt crystals within the rock\n\u2022 Cracking from plant roots and exposure by burrowing\nanimals\nWhen a mass of rock is exposed by weathering and removal of the\noverlying rock, there is a decrease in the confining pressure on the\nrock, and the rock expands. This unloading promotes cracking of\nthe rock, known as exfoliation.\nGranitic rock tends to exfoliate parallel to the exposed surface\nbecause it is typically homogenous, and it does not have\npredetermined planes along which it must fracture. Sedimentary\nand metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, tend to exfoliate along\npredetermined planes.\nFrost wedging, also called ice wedging, is the process by which\nwater seeps into cracks in a rock, expands on freezing, and thus\nenlarges the cracks. The effectiveness of frost wedging is related to\nthe frequency of freezing and thawing. Frost wedging is most\neffective in mountainous climates. In warm areas where freezing is\ninfrequent, in very cold areas where thawing is infrequent, or in\narid areas, where there is little water to seep into cracks, the role of\nfrost wedging is limited.\nIn many mountainous regions, the transition between freezing\nnighttime temperatures and thawing daytime temperatures is\nfrequent \u2014 tens to hundreds of times a year. Even in warm coastal\nareas, freezing and thawing transitions are frequent at higher\nelevations. A common feature in areas of active frost wedging is a 530 | 5.1 WEATHERING\ntalus slope \u2014 a fan-shaped deposit of fragments removed by frost\nwedging from the steep rocky slopes above.\n\u201cTalus Cones\u201d by Mark Wilson is licensed under Public Domain.\nA related process, frost heaving, takes place within unconsolidated\nmaterials on gentle slopes. In this case, water in the soil freezes and\nexpands, pushing the overlying material up. Frost heaving is\nresponsible for winter damage to roads all over North America.\nWhen saltwater seeps into rocks and then evaporates on a hot\nsunny day, salt crystals grow within cracks and pores. The growth\nof these crystals exerts pressure on the rock and can push grains\napart, causing the rock to weaken and break. Salt weathering can\nalso occur away from the coast because most environments have\nsome salt in them.\nThe effects of plants and animals are significant in mechanical\nweathering. Roots can force their way into even the tiniest cracks,\nand they exert tremendous pressure on the rocks as they grow,\nwidening the cracks and breaking the rock. Although animals do\ngenerally not burrow through solid rock, they can excavate and 5.1 WEATHERING | 531\nremove vast volumes of soil, and thus expose the rock to weathering\nby other mechanisms.\nMechanical weathering is greatly facilitated by erosion, which is the\nremoval of weathering products, allowing for the exposure of more\nrock for weathering. On the steep rock faces at the top of the cliff,\nrock fragments have been broken off by ice wedging, and then\nremoved by gravity. This is a form of mass wasting, which will be\nlooked at later in this chapter. Other essential agents of erosion that\nhave the effect of removing the products of weathering include\nwater in streams, ice in glaciers, and waves on the coasts.\nChemical Weathering\nChemical weathering results from chemical changes to minerals\nthat become unstable when they are exposed to surface conditions.\nThe kinds of changes that take place are highly specific to the\nmineral and the environmental conditions. Some minerals, like\nquartz, are virtually unaffected by chemical weathering, while\nothers, like feldspar, are easily altered. In general, the degree of\nchemical weathering is most significant in warm and wet climates\nand least in cold and dry climates. The essential characteristics of\nsurface conditions that lead to chemical weathering are the presence\nof water (in the air and on the ground surface), the abundance of\noxygen, and the presence of carbon dioxide, which produces weak\ncarbonic acid when combined with water.\nThe Products of Weathering and 532 | 5.1 WEATHERING\nErosion\nThe products of weathering and erosion are the unconsolidated\nmaterials that we find around us on slopes, beneath glaciers, in\nstream valleys, on beaches, and in deserts. The nature of these\nmaterials \u2014 their composition, size, degree of sorting, and degree of\nrounding \u2014 is determined by the type of rock that is being\nweathered, the nature of the weathering, the erosion, and\ntransportation processes, and the climate.\nA summary of the weathering products of some of the common\nminerals present in rocks is provided below.\nCommon\nTypical Weathering Products\nMineral\nQuartz Quartz as sand grains\nClay minerals plus potassium,\nFeldspar\nsodium, and calcium in solution\nBiotite and Chlorite plus iron and\nAmphibole magnesium in solution\nPyroxene and Serpentine plus iron and\nOlivine magnesium in solution\nCalcium and carbonate in\nCalcite\nsolution\nIron oxide minerals plus iron in\nPyrite\nsolution and sulphuric acid\nThe produces created from weathering range widely in size and\nshape, depending on the processes involved. If and when deposits\nlike these are turned into sedimentary rocks, the textures of those 5.1 WEATHERING | 533\nrocks will vary significantly. Importantly, when we describe\nsedimentary rocks that formed millions of years in the past, we can\nuse those properties to make inferences about the conditions that\nexisted during their formation. 5.2 WEATHERING AND\nSOIL FORMATION\nWeathering is a vital part of the process of soil formation, and soil is\ncritical to our existence on Earth. Many people refer to any loose\nmaterial on Earth\u2019s surface as soil, but to geographers, soil is the\nmaterial that includes organic matter, lies within the top few tens of\ncentimeters of the surface, and is vital in sustaining plant growth.\nSoil is a complex mixture of minerals (approximately 45 percent),\norganic matter (approximately 5 percent), and empty space\n(approximately 50 percent, filled to varying degrees with air and\nwater). The mineral content of soils is variable but is dominated by\nclay minerals and quartz, along with minor amounts of feldspar and\nsmall fragments of rock. The types of weathering that take place\nwithin a region have a significant influence on soil composition and\ntexture. For example, in a warm climate, where chemical weathering\ndominates, soils tend to be more abundant in clay. Soil scientists\ndescribe soil texture in terms of the relative proportions of sand,\nsilt, and clay. The sand and silt components in this diagram are\ndominated by quartz, with lesser amounts of feldspar and rock\nfragments, while the clay minerals dominate the clay component.\nSoil forms through accumulation and decay of organic matter and\nthe mechanical and chemical weathering processes described above.\nThe factors that affect the nature of soil and the rate of its\nformation include climate (especially average temperature and 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 535\nprecipitation amounts, and the following types of vegetation), the\ntype of parent material, the slope of the surface, and the amount of\ntime available.\nFormation of Soil\nClimate\nSoils develop because of the weathering of materials on Earth\u2019s\nsurface, including the mechanical breakup of rocks, and the\nchemical weathering of minerals. The downward percolation of\nwater facilitates soil development. Soil forms most readily under\ntemperate to tropical conditions (not cold), and precipitation\namounts are moderate (not dry, but not too wet). Chemical\nweathering reactions (especially the formation of clay minerals) and\nbiochemical reactions proceed fastest under warm conditions, and\nplant growth is enhanced in warm climates. Too much water (e.g.,\nin rainforests) can lead to the leaching of critical chemical nutrients\nand, hence, acidic soils. In humid and poorly drained regions,\nswampy conditions may prevail, producing soil that is dominated\nby organic matter. Too little water (e.g., in deserts and semi-deserts),\nresults in minimal downward chemical transportation and the\naccumulation of salts and carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) from\nupward-moving water. Soils in dry regions also suffer from a lack of\norganic material.\nParent Material\nSoil parent materials can include all different bedrock 536 | 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\ntypes and any unconsolidated sediments, such as glacial\ndeposits and stream deposits. Soils are described as\nresidual soils if they develop on bedrock, and transported\nsoils if they develop on transported material such as\nglacial sediments. However, the term \u201ctransported soil\u201d is\nmisleading because it implies that the soil itself has been\ntransported, which is not the case. When referring to such\nsoil, it is better to be specific and say \u201csoil developed on\nunconsolidated material,\u201d because that distinguishes it\nfrom soil developed on bedrock.\nParent materials provide essential nutrients to residual soils. For\nexample, a minor constituent of granitic rocks is the calcium-\nphosphate mineral apatite, which is a source of the critical soil\nnutrient phosphorus. Basaltic parent material tends to generate very\nfertile soils because it also provides phosphorus, along with\nsignificant amounts of iron, magnesium, and calcium.\nSome unconsolidated materials, such as river-flood deposits, make\nfor especially good soils because they tend to be rich in clay\nminerals. Clay minerals have large surface areas with negative\ncharges that are attractive to positively charged elements like\ncalcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium, which are essential\nnutrients for plant growth. 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 537\n\u201cSoil Texture\u201d by the United States Department of Agriculture is\nlicensed under Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\nInternational.\nSlope\nSoil can only develop where surface materials remain in place and\nare not frequently moved away by mass wasting. Soils cannot\ndevelop where the rate of soil formation is less than the rate of\nerosion, so steep slopes tend to have little or no soil. 538 | 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\nTime\nEven under ideal conditions, soil takes thousands of years to\ndevelop. Virtually all of northern North America was still glaciated\nup until 14 ka. Glaciers still dominated the central and northern\nparts of Canada until around 10 ka, and so, at that time, conditions\nwere still not ideal for soil development even in the southern\nregions. Therefore, soils in Canada, and especially in central and\nnorthern Canada, are relatively young and not well developed.\nThe same applies to soils forming on newly created surfaces, such as\nrecent deltas or sandbars, or in areas of mass wasting.\nSoil Horizons\nThe process of soil formation generally involves the downward\nmovement of clay, water, and dissolved ions, and a typical result of\nthat is the development of chemically and texturally different layers\nknown as soil horizons. The typically developed soil horizons are:\n\u2022 O \u2014 the layer of organic matter\n\u2022 A \u2014 the layer of partially decayed organic matter mixed with\nmineral material\n\u2022 E\u2014 the eluviated (leached) layer from which some of the clay\nand iron have been removed to create a pale layer that may be\nsandier than the other layers\n\u2022 B \u2014 the layer of accumulation of clay, iron, and other\nelements from the overlying soil\n\u2022 C \u2014 the layer of incomplete weathering 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 539\n\u201cSoil Profile\u201d by the United State Department of Agriculture is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nAnother type of layer develops in hot, arid regions known as\ncaliche (pronounced ca-lee-chee). It forms from the downward (or\nin some cases upward) movement of calcium ions, and the\nprecipitation of calcite within the soil. When well developed, 540 | 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\ncaliche cements the surrounding material together to form a layer\nthat has the consistency of concrete.\nLike all geological materials, soil is subject to erosion, although,\nunder natural conditions on gentle slopes, the rate of soil formation\neither balances or exceeds the rate of erosion. Human practices\nrelated to forestry and agriculture have significantly upset this\nbalance.\n\u201cSoil Profile\u201d is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nSoils are held in place by vegetation. When vegetation is removed,\neither through cutting trees or routinely harvesting crops and tilling\nthe soil, that protection is either temporarily or permanently lost.\nThe primary agents of the erosion of unprotected soil are water and\nwind. 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 541\nSoil is an important reservoir for organic components necessary for\nplants, animals, and microorganisms to live. The organic\ncomponent of soil, called humus, is a rich source of bioavailable\nnitrogen. Nitrogen is the most common element in the atmosphere,\nbut it exists in a form most life forms are unable to use. Special\nbacteria found only in soil provide most nitrogen compounds that\nare usable, bioavailable, by life forms.\n\u201cNitrogen Cycle\u201d by the Environmental Protection Agency is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nThese nitrogen-fixing bacteria absorb nitrogen from the\natmosphere and convert it into nitrogen compounds. These\ncompounds are absorbed by plants and used to make DNA, amino\nacids, and enzymes. Animals obtain bioavailable nitrogen by eating\nplants, and this is the source of most of the nitrogen used by life.\nThat nitrogen is an essential component of proteins and DNA. 542 | 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\nSoils range from poor to rich, depending on the amount of humus\nthey contain. Soil productivity is determined by water and nutrient\ncontent. Freshly created volcanic soils, called andisols, and clay-rich\nsoils that hold nutrients and water are examples of productive soils.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=462\nWater erosion is accentuated on sloped surfaces because fast-flowing\nwater has higher eroding power than still water. Raindrops can\ndisaggregate exposed soil particles, putting the finer material (e.g.,\nclays) into suspension in the water. Sheetwash, unchannelled flow\nacross a surface carries suspended material away, and channels erode\nright through the soil layer, removing both fine and coarse material.\nWind erosion is exacerbated by the removal of trees that act as 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 543\nwindbreaks and by agricultural practices that leave bare soil\nexposed.\nTillage is also a factor in soil erosion, especially on slopes, because\neach time a cultivator lifts the soil, it is moved a few centimeters\ndown the slope.\nWeathering and Climate Change\nEarth has two important carbon cycles. One is the biological one,\nwherein living organisms, mostly plants, consume carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere to make their tissues, and then, after they die,\nthat carbon is released back into the atmosphere when they decay\nover years or decades. A small proportion of this biological-cycle\ncarbon becomes buried in sedimentary rocks: during the slow\nformation of coal, as tiny fragments and molecules in organic-rich\nshale, and as the shells and other parts of marine organisms in\nlimestone. This becomes part of the geological carbon cycle, a cycle\nthat involves a majority of Earth\u2019s carbon but operates only very\nslowly.\nThe geological carbon cycle below shows the various steps in the\nprocess (not necessarily in this order):\n\u2022 Organic matter from plants is stored in peat, coal, and\npermafrost for thousands to millions of years.\n\u2022 Weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon\ndioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, stored in the oceans for\nthousands to tens of thousands of years.\n\u2022 Marine organisms convert dissolved carbon to calcite, which is 544 | 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION\nstored in carbonate rocks for tens to hundreds of millions of\nyears.\n\u2022 Carbon compounds are stored in sediments for tens to\nhundreds of millions of years; some end up in petroleum\ndeposits.\n\u2022 Carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to the mantle,\nwhere the carbon may be stored for tens of millions to billions\nof years.\n\u2022 During volcanic eruptions, carbon dioxide is released back to\nthe atmosphere, where it is stored for years to decades.\nDuring much of Earth\u2019s history, the geological carbon cycle has\nbeen balanced, with carbon being released by volcanism at\napproximately the same rate that the other processes store it. Under\nthese conditions, the climate remains relatively stable.\nDuring some periods of Earth\u2019s history, that balance has been upset.\nThis can happen during prolonged periods of higher than average\nvolcanism. One example is the eruption of the Siberian Traps at\naround 250 Ma, which appears to have led to strong climate\nwarming over a few million years.\nA carbon imbalance is also associated with significant mountain-\nbuilding events. For example, the Himalayan Range was formed\nbetween about 40 and 10 million years ago. Over that period, and\nstill today, the rate of weathering on Earth has been enhanced\nbecause those mountains are so high, and the range is so extensive.\nThe weathering of these rocks, most importantly the hydrolysis of\nfeldspar, has resulted in the consumption of atmospheric carbon\ndioxide and transfer of the carbon to the oceans and ocean-floor 5.2 WEATHERING AND SOIL FORMATION | 545\ncarbonate minerals. The steady drop in carbon dioxide levels over\nthe past 40 million years, which led to the Pleistocene glaciations, is\npartly attributable to the Himalayan Range formation.\nAnother, non-geological form of carbon-cycle imbalance is\nhappening today on a very rapid time scale. We are in the process of\nextracting vast volumes of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) that were\nstored in rocks over the past several hundred million years, and\nconverting these fuels to energy and carbon dioxide. By doing so,\nwe are changing the climate faster than has ever happened in the\npast. 5.3 MASS WASTING\nMass wasting, which is synonymous with slope failure\u201d is the\nfailure and downslope movement of rock or unconsolidated\nmaterials in response to gravity. The term landslide is almost\nsynonymous with mass wasting, but not entirely because some\npeople reserve \u201clandslide\u201d for relatively rapid slope failures, while\nothers do not. Other than the video below, this textbook will avoid\nusing the term \u201clandslide.\u201d\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=464 5.3 MASS WASTING | 547\nFactors That Control Slope\nStability\nMass wasting happens because tectonic processes have created\nuplift. Erosion, driven by gravity, is the inevitable response to that\nuplift, and various types of erosion, including mass wasting, have\ncreated slopes in the uplifted regions. Slope stability is ultimately\ndetermined by two factors: the angle of the slope and the strength\nof the materials on it.\nA block of rock is typically situated on a rock slope that is being\npulled toward Earth\u2019s center (vertically down) by gravity. The\nvertical gravitational force can be split into two components relative\nto the slope: one pushing the block down the slope, called the shear\nforce, and the other pushing into the slope, called the normal\nforce. The shear force, which wants to push the block down the\nslope, has to overcome the strength of the connection between the\nblock and the slope, which may be quite weak if the block has split\naway from the main body of rock, or may be very strong if the\nblock is still a part of the rock. If the shear strength is greater than\nthe shear force, the block should not move. However, if the shear\nforce becomes stronger than the shear strength, the block of rock\nwill slide down the slope.\nAs already noted, slopes are created by uplift, followed by erosion.\nIn areas with relatively recent uplift, slopes tend to be quite steep.\nThis is especially true where glaciation has taken place because\nglaciers in mountainous terrain create steep-sided valleys. In areas\nwithout recent uplift, slopes are less steep because hundreds of\nmillions of years of erosion (including mass wasting) have made 548 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\nthem that way. However, as we will see, some mass wasting can\nhappen even on relatively gentle slopes.\nThe strength of the materials on slopes can vary widely. Solid rocks\ntend to be strong, but there is an extensive range of rock strength. If\nwe consider just the strength of the rocks and ignore issues like\nfracturing and layering, then most crystalline rocks, like granite,\nbasalt, or gneiss, are very strong, while some metamorphic rocks,\nlike schist, are moderately strong. Sedimentary rocks have variable\nstrength. Dolostone and some limestone are strong, most sandstone\nand conglomerate are moderately strong, and some sandstone and\nall mudstones are quite weak.\nFractures, metamorphic foliation, or bedding can significantly\nreduce the strength of a body of rock, and in the context of mass\nwasting, this is most critical if the planes of weakness are parallel to\nthe slope and least critical if they are perpendicular to the slope.\nInternal variations in the composition and structure of rocks can\nsignificantly affect their strength. Schist, for example, may have\nlayers rich in sheet silicates (mica or chlorite), and these will tend to\nbe weaker than other layers. Some minerals tend to be more\nsusceptible to weathering than others, and the weathered products\nare commonly quite weak (e.g., the clay formed from feldspar).\nUnconsolidated sediments are generally weaker than sedimentary\nrocks because they are not cemented and, in most cases, have not\nbeen significantly compressed by overlying materials. This binding\nproperty of sediment is sometimes referred to as cohesion. Sand and\nsilt tend to be particularly weak, clay is generally a little stronger,\nand sand mixed with clay can be stronger still. Finer deposits are 5.3 MASS WASTING | 549\nrelatively strong (they maintain a steep slope), while the overlying\nsand is relatively weak, and has a shallower slope that has recently\nfailed. Glacial till, typically a mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and\nlarger clasts, forms and is compressed beneath tens to thousands of\nmeters of glacial ice so it can be as strong as some sedimentary rock.\nApart from the type of material on a slope, the amount of water\nthat the material contains is the most critical factor controlling its\nstrength. This is especially true for unconsolidated materials, but it\nalso applies to bodies of rock. Granular sediments, like the sand at\nPoint Grey, have lots of spaces between the grains. Those spaces\nmay be arid (filled only with air); or moist (often meaning that\nsome spaces are water-filled, some grains have a film of water\naround them, and small amounts of water are present where grains\nare touching each other); or completely saturated. Unconsolidated\nsediments tend to be strongest when they are moist because the\nsmall amounts of water at the grain boundaries hold the grains\ntogether with surface tension. Dry sediments are held together only\nby the friction between grains, and if they are well sorted or well\nrounded, or both, that cohesion is weak. Saturated sediments tend\nto be the weakest of all because the large amount of water pushes\nthe grains apart, reducing the mount friction between grains. This\nis especially true if the water is under pressure.\nWater will also reduce the strength of solid rock, especially if it has\nfractures, bedding planes, or clay-bearing zones. This effect is even\nmore significant when the water is under pressure, which is why\nholes are drilled into rocks on road cuts to relieve this pressure.\nWater also has a particular effect on clay-bearing materials. All clay\nminerals will absorb a little bit of water, and this reduces their 550 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\nstrength. The smectite clays, such as the bentonite used in cat\nlitter, can absorb much water, and that water pushes the sheets\napart at a molecular level and makes the mineral swell. Smectite that\nhas expanded in this way has almost no strength; it is incredibly\nslippery.\nMoreover, finally, water can significantly increase the mass of the\nmaterial on a slope, which increases the gravitational force pushing\nit down. A body of sediment that has 25% porosity and is saturated\nwith water weighs approximately 13% more than it does when it is\ncompletely dry, so the gravitational shear force is also 13% higher.\nMass-Wasting Triggers\nThe shear force and the shear strength of materials on slopes, and\nabout factors that can reduce the shear strength. Shear force is\nprimarily related to the slope angle, and this does not change\nquickly. However, shear strength can change quickly for various\nreasons, and events leading to a rapid reduction in shear strength\nare considered to be triggers for mass waste.\nAn increase in water content is the most common mass-wasting\ntrigger. This can result from the rapid melting of snow or ice, heavy\nrain, or some event that changes the pattern of water flow on the\nsurface. Rapid melting can be caused by a dramatic increase in\ntemperature (e.g., in spring or early summer) or by a volcanic\neruption. Heavy rains are typically related to storms. Earthquakes\ncan cause changes in water flow patterns, previous slope failures\nthat dam up streams, or human structures that interfere with\nrunoff (e.g., buildings, roads, or parking lots). 5.3 MASS WASTING | 551\nIn some cases, a decrease in water content can lead to failure. This is\nmost common with clean sand deposits, which lose strength when\nthere is no more water around the grains. Freezing and thawing can\nalso trigger some forms of mass wasting. More specifically, the\nthawing can release a block of rock attached to a slope by a film of\nice. One other process that can weaken a body of rock or sediment\nis shaking. The most apparent source of shaking is an earthquake,\nbut shaking from highway traffic, construction, or mining will also\ndo the job. Several deadly mass-wasting events (including snow\navalanches) were triggered by the M7.8 earthquake in Nepal in\nApril 2015.\nClassification of Mass Wasting\nIt is crucial to classify slope failures so that we can understand what\ncauses them and how to mitigate them. The three criteria used to\ndescribe slope failures are:\n\u2022 The type of material that failed (typically either bedrock or\nunconsolidated sediment).\n\u2022 The mechanism of the failure (how the material moved).\n\u2022 The rate at which it moved.\nThe type of motion is the essential characteristic of slope failure,\nand there are three different types of motion:\n\u2022 If the material drops through the air, vertically or nearly\nvertically, it is known as a fall.\n\u2022 If the material moves as a mass along a sloping surface 552 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\n(without internal motion within the mass), it is a slide.\n\u2022 If the material has internal motion, like a fluid, it is a flow.\n\u201cMass Wasting Types\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nUnfortunately, it is not typically that simple. Many slope failures\ninvolve two of these types of motion, some involve all three, and in 5.3 MASS WASTING | 553\nmany cases, it is not easy to tell how the material moved. The types\nof slope failure are summarized below. 554 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\nFailure Type of Type of Rate of\nType Material Motion Motion\nVertical or\nnear-vertical\nRock Very fast\nRock fall fall (plus\nfragments (>10s m\/s)\nbouncing in\nmany cases)\nMotion as a Typically\nunit along a very slow\nA large rock\nRock slide planar surface (mm\/y to\nbody\n(translational cm\/y), some\nsliding) can be faster\nFlow (at high\nA large rock\nspeeds, the\nbody that\nmass of rock\nRock slides and then Very fast\nfragments is\navalanche breaks into (>10s m\/s)\nsuspended on\nsmaller\na cushion of\nfragments\nair)\nSoil or other Flow\noverburden in (although Very slow\nCreep or\nsome small sliding motion (mm\/y to\nsolification\ncases, mixed may also cm\/y)\nwith ice occur)\nMotion as a\nThick deposits\nunit along a\nof Slow (cm\/y\nSlump curved surface\nunconsolidated to m\/y)\n(rotational\nsediment\nsliding)\nFlow (a\nLoose\nmixture of\nsediment with Moderate to\nsediment and\nMudflow a significant fast (cm\/s to\nwater moves\ncomponent of m\/s)\ndown a\nsilt and clay\nchannel) 5.3 MASS WASTING | 555\nFlow (similar\nSand, gravel,\nDebris to a mudflow,\nand larger Fast (m\/s)\nflow but typically\nfragments\nfaster)\nRock Fall\nA rock fall is when fragments or rock break off relatively easily\nfrom steep bedrock slopes, most commonly due to frost-wedging in\nareas where there are many freeze-thaw cycles per year. When hiking\nalong a steep mountain trail on a cool morning, one might have\nheard the occasional fall of rock fragments onto a talus slope. This\nhappens because the water between cracks freezes and expands\novernight. When that same water thaws in the morning sun, the\nfragments that had been pushed beyond their limit by the ice fall to\nthe slope below. 556 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\n\u201cJalalabad Rock Fall\u201d by Wien Sven Dirks is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nRock Slide\nA rock slide is the sliding motion of rock along a sloping surface.\nIn most cases, the movement is parallel to a fracture, bedding, or\nmetamorphic foliation plane, and it can range from very slow to\nmoderately fast. The word sackung describes a slope\u2019s very slow\nmotion of a block of rock (mm\/y to cm\/y).\nRock Avalanche\nIf a rock slides and then starts moving quickly (m\/s), the rock is\nlikely to break into many small pieces, and at that point, it turns\ninto a rock avalanche, in which the large and small fragments of 5.3 MASS WASTING | 557\nrock move in a fluid manner supported by a cushion of air within\nand beneath the moving mass.\n\u201cGoodell Creek Debris Avalanche\u201d is licensed under Public Domain.\nCreep or Solifluction\nThe very slow, millimeters per year to centimeters per year,\nmovement of soil or other unconsolidated material on a slope is\nknown as creep. Creep, which generally only affects the upper\nseveral centimeters of loose material, is typically a very slow flow,\nbut in some cases, sliding may occur. Creep can be facilitated by\nfreezing and thawing because particles are lifted perpendicular to\nthe surface by the growth of ice crystals within the soil, and then let\ndown vertically by gravity when the ice melts. The same effect can\nbe produced by frequent wetting and drying of the soil. In cold\nenvironments, solifluction is a more intense form of freeze-thaw-\ntriggered creep. 558 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\nCreep is most noticeable on moderate-to-steep slopes where trees,\nfence posts, or grave markers are consistently leaning in a downhill\ndirection. In the case of trees, they try to correct their lean by\ngrowing upright, and this leads to a curved lower trunk known as a\n\u201cpistol butt.\u201d\n\u201cSoil Creep\u201d by Derek Harper is licensed under Creative Commons\nShare-Alike 2.0 Unported.\nSlump is a type of slide (movement as a mass) that takes place\nwithin thick unconsolidated deposits (typically thicker than 10 m).\nSlumps involve movement along one or more curved failure\nsurfaces, with downward motion near the top and outward motion\ntoward the bottom. They are typically caused by an excess of water\nwithin these materials on a steep slope. 5.3 MASS WASTING | 559\nMudflows and Debris Flows\nWhen a mass of sediment becomes wholly saturated with water, the\nmass loses strength, to the extent that the grains are pushed apart,\nand it will flow, even on a gentle slope. This can happen during\nrapid spring snowmelt or heavy rains and is also relatively common\nduring volcanic eruptions because of the rapid melting of snow and\nice. (A mudflow or debris flow on a volcano or during a volcanic\neruption is a lahar.) If the material involved is primarily sand-sized\nor smaller, it is known as a mudflow.\nIf the material involved is gravel-sized or larger, it is known as a\ndebris flow. Because it takes more gravitational energy to move\nmore massive particles, a debris flow typically forms in an area with\nsteeper slopes and more water than a mudflow. In many cases, a\ndebris flow takes place within a steep stream channel and is\ntriggered by the collapse of bank material into the stream. This\ncreates a temporary dam and a significant flow of water and debris\nwhen the dam breaks. 560 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Where we can neither delay\nnor mitigate mass wasting, we should consider moving out of the\nway. 5.3 MASS WASTING | 561\nPreventing and Delaying Mass Wasting\nDelaying mass wasting is a worthy endeavor, of course, because\nduring the time that the measures are still effective, they can save\nlives and reduce damage to property and infrastructure. The other\nside of the coin is that we must be careful to avoid activities that\ncould make mass wasting more likely. One of the most common\nanthropogenic causes of mass waste is road construction, and this\napplies to both remote gravel roads built for forestry and mining\nand large urban and regional highways. Road construction is a\npotential problem for two reasons. First, creating a flat road surface\non a slope inevitably involves creating a cut bank that is steeper than\nthe original slope. This might also involve creating a filled bank that\nis both steeper and weaker than the original slope. Second,\nroadways typically cut across natural drainage features, and unless\ngreat care is taken to reroute the runoff water and prevent it from\nforming concentrated flows, oversaturating fill of materials can\nresult \u2014 a specific example of the contribution of construction-\nrelated impeded drainage to slope instability.\nApart from water issues, engineers building roads and other\ninfrastructure on bedrock slopes must be acutely aware of the\ngeology, especially of any weaknesses or discontinuities in the rock\nrelated to bedding, fracturing, or foliation.\nIt is widely believed that the construction of buildings on the tops\nof steep slopes can contribute to the instability of the slope. This is\nprobably true, but not because of the weight of the building. A\ntypical house is not usually heavier than the fill that was removed\nfrom the hole in the ground made to build it. A more likely 562 | 5.3 MASS WASTING\ncontributor to the instability of the slope around a building is the\neffect that it and the changes made to the surrounding area have on\ndrainage.\nMonitoring Mass Wasting\nIn some areas, it is necessary to establish warning systems so that we\nknow if conditions have changed at a known slide area, or if a rapid\nfailure, such as a debris flow, is actually on its way downslope.\nMt. Rainier, a glacier-covered volcano in Washington State, has the\npotential to produce massive mudflows or debris flows (lahars) with\nor without a volcanic eruption. Over 100,000 people in the\nTacoma, Puyallup, and Sumner areas are in harm\u2019s way because\nthey currently reside on deposits from past lahars. In 1998, a\nnetwork of acoustic monitors was established around Mt. Rainier.\nThe monitors are embedded in the ground adjacent to expected\nlahar paths. They are intended to provide warnings to emergency\nofficials, and when a lahar is detected, the residents of the area will\nhave anywhere from 40 minutes to three hours to get to safe\nground.\nMitigating the Impacts of Mass Wasting\nIn situations where we cannot predict, prevent, or delay mass-\nwasting hazards, some effective measures can be taken to minimize\nthe associated risk. In some parts of the world, similar features have\nbeen built to protect infrastructure from other types of mass\nwasting. Debris flows are inevitable, unpreventable, and\nunpredictable. The results have been deadly and expensive many 5.3 MASS WASTING | 563\ntimes in the past. It would be costly to develop a new route in this\nregion, so provincial authorities have taken steps to protect\nresidents and traffic on the highway and the railway. Debris-flow\ndefensive structures have been constructed in several drainage\nbasins. One strategy is to allow the debris to flow quickly through\nto the ocean along a smooth channel. Another is to capture the\ndebris within a constructed basin that allows the excess water to\ncontinue through but catches the debris materials.\nThe United States Geologic Survey and the Utah Geologic Survey\nare excellent sources for more information regarding mass wasting. 5.4 EROSION\nErosion is a mechanical process, usually driven by water, gravity,\nwind, or ice that removes sediment from weathering. Liquid water\nis the principal agent of erosion. Erosion resistance is essential in the\ncreation of distinctive geological features. This is well demonstrated\nin the cliffs of the Grand Canyon. The cliffs are made of rock left\nstanding after less resistant materials have weathered and eroded.\nRocks with different levels of erosion resistance also create unique-\nlooking features called hoodoos in Bryce Canyon National Park and\nGoblin Valley State Park in Utah.\n\u201cBryce Canyon\u201d by R. Adam Dastrup, is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution-NoncCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0\nInternational. 5.4 EROSION | 565\nErosion by Streams\nStreams, any running water from a rivulet to a raging river, complete\nthe hydrologic cycle by returning precipitation that falls on land to\nthe oceans. Some of this water moves over the surface, and some\nmoves through the ground as groundwater. Flowing water does the\nwork of both erosion and deposition.\nFlowing streams pick up and transport weathered materials by\neroding sediments from their banks. Streams also carry ions and\nionic compounds that dissolve easily in the water. Sediments are\ncarried as the following loads: dissolved, suspended, and bed. A\ndissolved load is composed of ions in solution. These ions are usually\ncarried in the water to the ocean.\nSediments carried as solids as the stream flows are called a suspended\nload. The stream\u2019s velocity determines the size of particles that can\nbe carried within a load. Faster streams can carry larger particles.\nStreams that carry larger particles have greater competence. Streams\nwith a steep gradient (slope) have a faster velocity and greater\ncompetence. 566 | 5.4 EROSION\n\u201cStream Load\u201d is licensed under Public Domain.\nParticles that are too large to be carried as suspended loads are\nbumped and pushed along the stream bed, called bed load. Bed\nload sediments do not move continuously, but rather in intermittent\nmovements, called saltation. Streams with high velocities and steep\ngradients do a great deal of down-cutting into the stream bed, which\nis primarily accomplished by movement of particles that make up\nthe bed load.\nStages of Streams\nAs a stream flows from higher elevations, like in the mountains,\ntowards lower elevations, like the ocean, the work of the stream\nchanges. At a stream\u2019s headwaters, often high in the mountains,\ngradients are steep. The stream moves fast and does lots of work\neroding the stream bed.\nAs a stream moves into lower areas, the gradient is not as steep. Now\nthe stream does more work eroding the edges of its banks. Many 5.4 EROSION | 567\nstreams develop curves in their channels called meanders. As streams\nmove onto flatter ground, the stream erodes the banks\u2019 outer edges\nto carve a floodplain, which is a flat-level area surrounding the stream\nchannel.\nThe base level is where a stream meets a large body of standing\nwater, usually the ocean, but sometimes a lake or pond. Streams\nwork to down cut in their stream beds until they reach base level.\nThe higher the elevation, the further the stream from which it will\nreach the base level, and the more cutting it has to do.\nStream Deposition\nAs a stream gets closer to the base level, its gradient lowers, and it\ndeposits more material than it erodes. On flatter ground, streams\ndeposit material on the inside of meanders. A stream\u2019s floodplain\nis much broader and shallower than the stream\u2019s channel. When a\nstream flows onto its floodplain, its velocity slows, and it deposits\nmuch of its load. These sediments are rich in nutrients and make\nexcellent farmland. 568 | 5.4 EROSION\n\u201cAlluvial Fan in Iran\u201d by NASA\u2019s Earth Observatory is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nA stream at flood stage carries lots of sediments. When its gradient\ndecreases, the stream overflows its banks and broadens its channel.\nThe decrease in gradient causes the stream to deposit its sediments,\nthe largest first. These large sediments build a higher area around the\nedges of the stream channel, creating natural levees. 5.4 EROSION | 569\n\u201cLena River Delta\u201d by NASA Landsat Science is licensed under\nPublic Domain.\nWhen a river enters standing water, its velocity slows to a stop.\nThe stream moves back and forth across the region and drops its\nsediments in an extensive triangular-shaped deposit called a delta. If\na stream falls down a steep slope onto a broad flat valley, an alluvial\nfan develops. Alluvial fans generally form in arid regions. 570 | 5.4 EROSION\n\u201cNile River and Delta\u201d by NASA is licensed as Public Domain.\nGround Water Erosion and\nDeposition\nGroundwater is a strong erosional force, as it works to dissolve\naway solid rock. Carbonic acid is especially good at dissolving the\nrock limestone. Over many years, groundwater travels along small\ncracks. The water dissolves and carries away the solid rock, gradually\nenlarging the cracks, eventually forming a cave. The video below\nis drone footage of the world\u2019s largest cave, Hang Son Doong, in\nVietnam. 5.4 EROSION | 571\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The\nminerals may then be deposited, for example, as stalagmites (grows\nfrom the top) or stalactites (grows from the bottom). If a stalactite\nand stalagmite join together, they form a column. One wonders\nof visiting a cave are witnessing the beauty of these fantastic and\nstrangely captivating structures. Caves also produce a beautiful rock,\nformed from calcium carbonate, travertine. Groundwater saturated\nwith calcium carbonate precipitates as the mineral calcite or\naragonite. Mineral springs that produce travertine can be hot, warm,\nor even cold.\nIf the roof of a cave collapses, a sinkhole could form. Some sinkholes 5.4 EROSION | 573\nare large enough to swallow up a home or several homes in a\nneighborhood.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=467\nWave Action and Erosion\nWaves are essential for building up and breaking down shorelines.\nWaves transport sand onto and off of beaches, transport sand along\nbeaches, carves structures along the shore. The most massive waves\nform when the wind is powerful, blows steadily for a long time, and\nblows over a long distance. 574 | 5.4 EROSION\n\u201cWavecut Platform\u201d by under Creative Commons\nAttribution-Share Alike 2.5 Generic.\nThe wind could be strong, but if it gusts for just a short time, large\nwaves will not form. Wave energy does the work of erosion at the\nshore. Waves approach the shore at some angle, so the inshore part\nof the wave reaches shallow water sooner than the part that is further\nout. The shallow part of the wave \u2018feels\u2019 the bottom first. This slows\ndown the inshore part of the wave and makes the wave \u2018bend.\u2019 This\nbending is called refraction.\nWave refraction either concentrates wave energy or disperses it. In\nquiet water areas, such as bays, wave energy is dispersed, so sand\nis deposited. Areas that stick out into the water are eroded by the\nintense wave energy that concentrates its power on the wave-cut cliff.\nA wave-cut platform is the level area formed by wave erosion as\nthe waves undercut a cliff. An arch is produced when waves erode\nthrough a cliff. When a sea arch collapses, the isolated towers of\nrocks that remain are known as sea stacks. 5.4 EROSION | 575\nWave Deposition\nRivers carry sediments from the land to the sea. If wave action is\nhigh, a delta will not form. Waves will spread the sediments along\nthe coastline to create a beach. Waves also erode sediments from cliffs\nand shorelines and transport them onto beaches.\nBeaches can be made of mineral grains, like quartz, rock fragments,\nand also pieces of shell or coral. Waves continually move sand along\nthe shore and move sand from the beaches on shore to bars of sand\noffshore as the season\u2019s change. In the summer, waves have lower\nenergy, so they bring sand up onto the beach. In the winter, higher\nenergy waves bring the sand back offshore.\nSome features form by wave-deposited sand, such as barrier islands\nand spits. A spit is sand connected to the land and extending into the\nwater. A spit may hook to form a tombolo. Shores that are relatively\nflat and gently sloping may be lined with long narrow barrier islands.\nMost barrier islands are a few kilometers wide and tens of kilometers\nlong.\nIn its natural state, a barrier island acts as the first line of defense\nagainst storms such as hurricanes. When barrier islands are\nurbanized, hurricanes damage houses and businesses rather than\nvegetated sandy areas in which sand can move. A large hurricane\nbrings massive problems to the urbanized area.\nProtecting Shorelines\nIntact shore areas protect inland areas from storms that come off\nthe ocean. Where the natural landscape is altered, or the amount 576 | 5.4 EROSION\nof development does damage from a storm too costly to consider,\npeople use several types of structures to attempt to slow down wave\nerosion. A groin is a long narrow pile of rocks built perpendicular to\nthe shoreline to keep sand at that beach. A breakwater is a structure\nbuilt in the water parallel to the shore to protect the shore from\nstrong incoming waves. A seawall is also parallel to the shore, but it\nis built onshore.\n\u201cAerial of Siloso Beach Singapore\u201d is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution 2.0 Generic.\nPeople do not always want to choose safe building practices, and\ninstead choose to build a beach house right on the beach. Protecting\ndevelopment from wave erosion is difficult and expensive, and it\ndoes not always work. Anti-tsunami seawalls protected the\nnortheastern coast of Japan, yet waves from the 2011 tsunami that\nresulted from the Tohoku earthquake washed over some seawalls 5.4 EROSION | 577\nand caused others to collapse. Japan is now planning to build even\nhigher seawalls to prepare for any future (and inevitable) tsunami. 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND\nThe power of the wind to erode depends on particle size, wind\nstrength, and whether the particles can be picked up. Wind is a\ncrucial erosional force in arid than humid regions. Wind transports\nsmall particles, such as silt and clay, over great distances, even\nhalfway across a continent or an entire ocean basin. Particles may be\nsuspended for days. Wind more easily picks up particles on the\nground that has been disturbed, such as a construction site or a\ndune. Just like flowing water, wind transports particles as both bed\nload and suspended load. For wind, bed load is made of sand-sized\nparticles, many of which move by saltation. The suspended load is\ntiny particles of silt and clay.\nWind Erosion\nWind is a more potent erosional force in arid regions than it is in\nhumid regions. In humid areas, water and vegetation bind the soil,\nso it is harder to pick up. In arid regions, small particles are\nselectively picked up and transported. As they are removed, the\nground surface gets lower and rockier, causing deflation. What is\nleft is desert pavement, a surface covered by gravel-sized particles\nthat are not easily moved by wind. 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND | 579\n\u201cDelicate Arch\u201d by John Buie is licensed under Creative Commons\nAttribution 2.0 Generic.\nParticles moved by the wind do the work of abrasion. As a grain\nstrikes another grain or surface, it erodes that surface. Abrasion by\nwind may polish natural or human-made surfaces, such as\nbuildings. Stones that have become polished and faceted due to\nabrasion by sand particles are called ventifacts.\nExposed rocks in desert areas often develop a dark brown to black\ncoating called desert varnish. Wind transports clay-sized particles\nthat chemically react with other substances at high temperatures.\nThe coating is formed of iron and manganese oxides. Often\npetroglyphs are carved into the desert varnish by earlier civilizations\nin arid regions. 580 | 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND\n\u201cWind Erosion in the Altiplano Region of Bolivia\u201d is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic license.\nWind Deposition\nDeserts and seashores sometimes have dunes. Beach dunes have\ndifferent compositions depending on their location, and are usually\nquartz because, in humid areas, other minerals weather into clays.\nIn the tropics, dunes may be composed of calcium carbonate,\nwhich is typical. In deserts, sand dunes may be composed of a\nvariety of minerals. There is little weathering, and so less stable\nminerals are left behind.\nSand dunes are usually very uniform in size and shape. Particles are\nsand-sized because more massive particles are too heavy for the 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND | 581\nwind to transport by suspension. They are rounded since rounded\ngrains roll more easily than angular grains.\n\u201cSand Dunes in Namibia, Africa\u201d is Free for Commercial Use by\nPikrepo.\nFor dunes to form, there must be an abundant supply of sand and\nsteady winds. A strong wind slows down, often over some\nobstacles, such as a rock or some vegetation, and drops its sand. As\nthe wind moves up and over the obstacle, it increases in speed. It\ncarries the sand grains up the gently sloping, upwind side of the\ndune by saltation. As the wind passes over the dune, its speed\ndecreases \u2014 sand cascades down the crest, forming the slip face of\nthe dune. The slip face is steep because it is at the angle of repose for\ndry sand, about 34 degrees.\nWind deposits dunes layer by layer. If the wind changes directions,\ncross-beds form. Cross beds are named for the way each layer is\nformed at an angle to the ground. The types of a dune that forms\ndepend on the amount of sand available, the character and 582 | 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND\ndirection of the wind, and the type of ground the sand is moving\nover.\nLoess\nWindblown silt and clay deposited layer on a layer over a large area\nare loesses that come from the German word loose. Loess deposits\nform downwind of glacial outwash or desert, where fine particles\nare available. Loess deposits make very fertile soils in many regions\nof the world.\nFine-grained mud in the deep ocean is formed from silts and clays\nbrought from the land by the wind. The particles are deposited on\nthe sea surface, then slowly settle to the deep ocean floor, forming\nbrown, greenish, or reddish clays. Volcanic ash may also settle on\nthe seafloor. 5.5 TRANSPORT BY WIND | 583\n\u201cLoess Plateau Geomorphology\u201d is licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported. 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE\nON EROSION AND\nDEPOSITION\nFormation and Movement of\nGlaciers\nGlaciers cover about 10 percent of the land surface near Earth\u2019s\npoles, and they are also found in high mountains. During the Ice\nAges, glaciers covered as much as 30 percent of Earth. Around 600\nto 800 million years ago, geologists think that almost all of the Earth\nwas covered in snow and ice, called the Snowball Theory. Scientists\nuse the evidence of erosion and deposition left by glaciers to do a\nkind of detective work to figure out where the ice once was and\nwhere it came from. 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION | 585\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=471\nGlaciers are solid ice that moves exceptionally slowly along the land\nsurface. They erode and shape the underlying rocks. Glaciers also\ndeposit sediments in characteristic landforms. The two types of\nglaciers are: continental and alpine. Continental glaciers are large\nice sheets that cover relatively flat ground. These glaciers flow\noutward from where the most considerable amount of snow and\nice accumulate. Alpine or valley glaciers flow downhill through\nmountains along existing valleys. 586 | 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION\n\u201cThwaites Glacier\u201d is a continental glacier taken by NASA and is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\n\u201cPerito Moreno Glacier\u201d by Luca Galuzzi is an alpine glacier and is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5\nGeneric license. 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION | 587\nGlacial Erosion\nGlaciers erode the underlying rock by abrasion and plucking. Glacial\nmeltwater seeps into cracks of the underlying rock, the water freezes\nand pushes pieces of rock outward. The rock is then plucked out\nand carried away by the flowing ice of the moving glacier. With the\nweight of the ice over them, these rocks can scratch deeply into the\nunderlying bedrock making long, parallel grooves in the bedrock,\ncalled glacial striations.\nMountain glaciers leave behind unique erosional features. When a\nglacier cuts through a \u2018V\u2019 shaped river valley, the glacier pucks rocks\nfrom the sides and bottom. This widens the valley and steepens the\nwalls, making a \u2018U\u2019 shaped valley.\nSmaller tributary glaciers, like tributary streams, flow into the\nmain glacier in their own shallower \u2018U\u2019 shaped valleys. A hanging\nvalley forms where the main glacier cuts off a tributary glacier and\ncreates a cliff. Streams plunge over the cliff to create waterfalls. Up\nhigh on a mountain, where a glacier originates, rocks are pulled away\nfrom valley walls. 588 | 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION\n\u201cU-Shaped Valley\u201d by Dan Hobley is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION | 589\nDepositional Features of\nGlaciers\n\u2014 alpine glacier \u2014\ncirque basin ar\u00eate\naccu zm ou nl eation t r i b u gta lar cy i er\nlateral moraine\nsnow glacier\nplucking firn equilibrium line\nfirn line medial moraine\nglacial ice\nabrasion ablation zone outwash plain\ncrevasses meltwater stream\nt lr oa nn gs iv tue drs ie n ac lr e cv rea vs ase sses drumlins kettle lakes\nbedrock\nesker terminal moraines\nkame\nground\nmoraine\n\u201cAlpine Glacier Diagram\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nAs glaciers flow, mechanical weathering loosens rock on the valley\nwalls, which falls as debris on the glacier. Glaciers can carry rocks\nof any size, from giant boulders to silt. These rocks can be carried\nfor many miles over many years and decades. These rocks that are\ndifferent in type or origin from the surrounding bedrock are glacial\nerratics. Melting glaciers deposit all the big and small bits of solid\nmaterial they are carrying in a pile. These unsorted deposits of rock\nare called glacial till.\nGlacial till is found in different types of deposits. Linear rock\ndeposits are called moraines and are named by their location relative\nto the glacier. Geologists study moraines to figure out how far 590 | 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION\nglaciers extended and how long it took them to melt away. Lateral\nmoraines form at the edges of the glacier as material drops onto\nthe glacier from erosion of the valley walls. Medial moraines form\nwhere the lateral moraines of two tributary glaciers join together in\nthe middle of a more massive glacier. Sediment from underneath the\nglacier becomes a ground moraine after the glacier melts. Ground\nmoraine contributes to the fertile transported soils in many regions.\nTerminal moraines are long ridges of till left at the furthest point\nthe glacier reached. End moraines are deposited where the glacier\nstopped for a long enough period to create a rocky ridge as it\nretreated. Two end moraines form long Island in New York.\nWhile glaciers dump unsorted sediments, glacial meltwater can sort\nand re-transport the sediments. As water moves through unsorted\nglacial till it leaves behind the larger particles and takes away the\nsmaller bits of sand and silt.\nSeveral types of stratified deposits form in glacial regions but are\nnot formed directly by the ice. Varves form where lakes are covered\nby ice in the winter. Dark, fine-grained clay sinks to the bottom in\nwinter, but melting ice in spring brings running water that deposits\nlighter colored sands. Each alternating dark\/light layer represents\none year of deposits. If during a year, a glacier accumulates more\nice than melts away, the glacier advances downhill. If a glacier melts\nmore than it accumulates over a year, it is retreating. 5.6 GLACIAL INFLUENCE ON EROSION AND DEPOSITION | 591\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Glaciers flow incredibly\nslowly downslope under the influence of gravity. However, satellite\nimagery and on the ground data have shown that these glaciers are\nmelting back and receding at an incredible rate. Because glaciers\ntake so long to form and flow, they are excellent indicators of the\nplanet\u2019s temperature. As the planet has continued to warm over the\nlast 100 years, glaciers from all around the world are retreating. This\nis important to humanity because glaciers make up a large portion\nof the usable freshwater on the planet.

Now there are two\ntypes of subsidence.\nSlow Subsidence\nSlow subsidence occurs when the water within the sediment is\nslowly squeezed out because of overlying weight. There are several\nexamples of slow subsidence, but the best one is Venice, Italy.\nVenice was built at sea level on the now submerged delta of the\nBrenta River. The city is sinking because of the overlying weight of\nthe city and the pumping of groundwater. The problem now is that\nsea levels are rising as glaciers melt and water expands due to global\nwarming. 594 | 5.7 SUBSIDENCE\n\u201cGondola on the Grand Canal, Venice, Italy\u201d by Peter K Burian is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0\nInternational license.\nAn example of slow subsidence in the U.S. includes New Orleans,\nLouisiana. As we all know from Hurricane Katrina, the Mississippi\nRiver has a vast network of levees that prevent the massive river\nfrom flooding \u2013 most of the time. But by preventing the spring-\ntime flooding, we are preventing the river from depositing sediment\nonto the land. Instead, the sediment is being transported to the\nGulf of Mexico creating the massive Mississippi delta.\nFast Subsidence\nFast subsidence occurs when naturally acidic water begins to\ndissolve limestone rock to form a network of water-filled\nunderground caverns. But if droughts or pumping of groundwater\nreduces the water table below the level of the caves, they caverns\ncollapse creating surface sinkholes. A dramatic example of fast\nsubsidence occurred in Guatemala City in 2007 when a massive\nsinkhole formed 300 feet deep. As noted above, the underground 5.7 SUBSIDENCE | 595\nregion surrounding Guatemala is composed of limestone and a vast\nunderground network of caverns. It is believed that the water table\nhas been dropping in the region and thus draining the caves.\nAfterward, the caves can not support the overlying weight and\ncollapse in.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Despite its simplicity, water has\nremarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes and has high\nsurface tension because of the molecules\u2019 polar nature that they\ntend to stick together. Without water, life might not exist on Earth,\nand it certainly would not have the tremendous complexity and\ndiversity that we see.\nWhere is Earth's Water?\nSurface\/other Atmosphere Living things\nFreshwater 2.5% freshwater 1.2% 3.0% 0.26%\nRivers\n0.49%\nOther saline Ground-\nSwamps,\nwater 0.9% water Lakes\nmarshes\n30.1% 20.9%\n2.6%\nSoil\nmoisture\nOceans Ground 3.8%\n96.5% ice and\nGlaciers permafrost\nand\n69.0%\nice caps\n68.7%\nTotal global Freshwater Surface water and\nwater other freshwater\n\u201cDistribution of the Locations of Water on Earth\u201d by the United\nStates Geologic Survey is licensed under Public Domain. 608 | 6.1 DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH'S WATER\nEarth\u2019s oceans contain 97 percent of the planet\u2019s water, and just 3\npercent is freshwater with relatively low concentrations of salts.\nMost freshwater is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of\nGreenland and Antarctica. A storage location for water such as an\nocean, glacier, pond, or even the atmosphere is known as a\nreservoir. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very\nquickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time a\nmolecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time.\nHydrologic Cycle\nBecause of the unique properties of water, water molecules can\ncycle through almost any-where on Earth. The water molecule\nfound in a glass of water today could have erupted from a volcano\nearly in Earth history. In the intervening billions of years, the\nmolecule probably spent time in a glacier or far below the ground.\nThe molecule surely was high up in the atmosphere and maybe\ndeep in the belly of a dinosaur.\nWater is the only substance on Earth that is present in all three\nstates of matter \u2013 as a solid, liquid, or gas. Along with that, Earth is\nthe only planet where water is present in all three states. Because of\nthe ranges in temperature in specific locations around the planet, all\nthree phases may be present in a specific location or region. The\nthree phases are solid (ice or snow), liquid (water), and gas (water\nvapor). 6.1 DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH'S WATER | 609\n\u201cThe Water Cycle\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is licensed\nunder Public Domain.\nWater is continuously on the move. It is evaporated from the\noceans, lakes, streams, the surface of the land, and plants\n(transpiration) by solar energy. It is moved through the\natmosphere by winds and condenses to form clouds of water\ndroplets or ice crystals. It comes back down as rain or snow and\nflows through streams, into lakes, and eventually back to the ocean.\nWater on the surface and in streams and lakes infiltrates the ground\nto become groundwater. Groundwater slowly moves through the\nrock and surficial materials. Some groundwater returns to other\nstreams and lakes, and some go directly back to the oceans. (Earle,\n2019)\nBecause Earth\u2019s water is present in all three states, it can get into\nvarious environments around the planet. The movement of water\naround the Earth\u2019s surface is the hydrologic (water) cycle. Water 610 | 6.1 DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH'S WATER\nchanges from a liquid to a gas by evaporation to become water\nvapor. The Sun\u2019s energy can evaporate water from the ocean surface\nor lakes, streams, or puddles on land. Only the water molecules\nevaporate; the salts remain in the ocean or a freshwater reservoir.\nThe water vapor stays in the atmosphere until it undergoes\ncondensation to become tiny droplets of liquid. The droplets gather\nin clouds, which are blown about the globe by the wind. As the\nwater droplets in the clouds collide and grow, they fall from the sky\nas precipitation. Precipitation can be rain, sleet, hail, or snow.\nSometimes precipitation falls back into the ocean, and sometimes it\nfalls onto the land surface.\nWhen water falls from the sky as rain, it may enter streams and\nrivers that flow down to oceans and lakes. Water that falls as snow\nmay sit on a mountain for several months. Snow may become part\nof the ice in a glacier, where it may remain for hundreds or\nthousands of years. Snow and ice may go directly back into the air\nby sublimation, the process in which a solid changes directly into a\ngas without first becoming a liquid. Although it is hard to see water\nvapor sublimate from a glacier, it is possible to see dry ice sublimate\nin the air. 6.1 DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH'S WATER | 611\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

A water droplet falling as rain could also become part of a\nstream or a lake. At the surface, the water may eventually evaporate\nand reenter the atmosphere. 612 | 6.1 DISTRIBUTION OF EARTH'S WATER\n\u201cEarth\u2019s Energy Budget\u201d from NASA is licensed under Public\nDomain.\nA significant amount of water infiltrates into the ground, and soil\nmoisture is an important reservoir for that water. Water trapped in\nthe soil is essential for plants to grow. Water may seep through dirt\nand rock below the soil through pores infiltrating the ground to go\ninto Earth\u2019s groundwater system. Groundwater may enter aquifers\nthat may store freshwater for centuries. Alternatively, the water may\ncome to the surface through springs or find its way back to the\noceans. Plants and animals depend on water to live, and they also\nplay a role in the water cycle. Plants take water from the soil and\nrelease substantial amounts of water vapor into the air through\ntheir leaves, a process known as transpiration.

Along with wetlands, these freshwater regions contain a\ntremendous variety of organisms. Streams are bodies of water that\nconsist of constant motion, called a current. Geologists recognize\nmany categories of streams depending on their size, depth, speed,\nand location. Creeks, brooks, tributaries, bayous, and rivers might\nall be lumped together as streams. In streams, water always flows\ndownhill, but the form that downhill movement takes varies with\nrock type, topography, and many other factors. 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 617\n\u201cStream Landscape in British Columbia\u201d is licensed under Public\nDomain.\nStreams are the most important agents of erosion and\ntransportation of sediments on Earth\u2019s surface. They are\nresponsible for the creation of much of the topography that we see\naround us. They are also places of great beauty and tranquility, and\nof course, they supply much of the water that is essential to our\nexistence. However, streams are not always peaceful and soothing.\nDuring large storms and rapid snowmelts, they can become raging\ntorrents capable of moving cars and houses and destroying roads\nand bridges. When they spill over their banks, they can flood vast\nareas, devastating populations, and infrastructure. (11 Water \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.) 618 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\nParts of a Stream\nThere are a variety of distinct types of streams. A stream originates\nat its sources, such as high mountains where snows collect in\nwinter and melt in summer, or a source might be a spring. A\nstream may have more than one source, and when two streams\ncome together, it is called a confluence. The smaller of the two\nstreams is a tributary of the larger stream. A stream may create a\npool where the water slows and becomes more profound.\n\u201cRiver Source\u201d by Tony Ferrie is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic. 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 619\n\u201cFlooding at the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio River\u201d by\nNASA Landsat Science is licensed under Public Domain.\nThe point at which a stream comes into a large body of water, like\nan ocean or a lake, is called the mouth. Where the stream meets the\nocean or lake, it is called an estuary. The mix of fresh and saltwater,\nwhere a river runs into the ocean, creates a diversity of\nenvironments where many different organisms create unique\necosystems. 620 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\n\u201cMouths of the Amazon River\u201d by NASA is licensed under Public\nDomain.\nStream Erosion and Deposition\nFlowing water is a fundamental mechanism for both erosion and\ndeposition. Water flow in a stream is primarily related to the\nstream\u2019s gradient, but the stream channel\u2019s geometry also controls\nit. The water flow velocity is decreased by friction along the stream\nbed, so it is slowest at the bottom and edges and fastest near the\nsurface and in the middle. The velocity below the surface is typically\nslightly higher than right at the surface because of friction between\nthe water and the air. On a curved section of a stream, flow is fastest\non the outside and slowest on the inside.\nOther factors that affect stream-water velocity are the size of\nsediments on the stream bed \u2013 because large particles tend to slow\nthe flow more than small ones \u2013 and the discharge, or volume of 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 621\nwater passing a point in a unit of time. During a flood, the water\nlevel always rises, so there is a more cross-sectional area for the water\nto flow in. However, as long as a river remains confined to its\nchannel, the velocity of the water flow also increases.\nimage\n\u201cRelative Velocity of Stream Flow\u201d by Steven Earle is licensed\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.\nLarge particles rest on the bottom, bedload, and may only be moved\nduring rapid flows under flood conditions. They can be moved by\nsaltation (bouncing) and by traction (being pushed along by the\nforce of the flow). Smaller particles may rest on the bottom some of\nthe time, where they can be moved by saltation and traction, but\nthey can also be held in suspension in the flowing water, especially\nat higher velocities. Streams that flow fast tend to be turbulent\n(flow paths are chaotic, and the water surface appears rough), and\nthe water may be muddy, while those that flow more slowly tend to\nhave laminar flow (straight-line flow and a smooth water surface)\nand clear water. Turbulent flow is more effective than laminar flow\nat keeping sediments in suspension. Stream water also has a\ndissolved load, representing roughly 15 percent of the mass of\nmaterial transported, and includes ions such as calcium and\nchloride in solution. The solubility of these ions is not affected by\nflow velocity.\nThe faster the water is flowing, the larger the particles that can be\nkept in suspension and transported within the flowing water.\nHowever, as Swedish geographer Filip Hjulstr\u00f6m dis-covered in the\n1940s, the relationship between grain size and the likelihood of a 622 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\ngrain being eroded, transported, or deposited is not as simple as one\nmight imagine. Consider, for example, a 1 mm grain of sand. If it is\nresting on the bottom, it will remain there until the velocity is high\nenough to erode it. However, once it is in suspension, that same 1\nmm particle will remain in suspension as long as the velocity does\nnot drop below 10 centimeters per second (cm\/s.) For a 10 mm\ngravel grain, the velocity is 105 cm\/s to be eroded from the bed but\nonly 80 cm\/s to remain in suspension.\nOn the other hand, a 0.01 mm silt particle only needs a velocity of\n0.1 cm\/s to remain in suspension but requires 60 cm\/s to be\neroded. A tiny silt grain requires a higher velocity to be eroded than\na grain of sand that is 100 times larger. For clay-sized particles, the\ndiscrepancy is even more significant. In a stream, the most easily\neroded particles are small sand grains between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm.\nAnything smaller or larger requires a higher water velocity to be\neroded and entrained in the flow. The main reason for this is that\nthose small particles, especially the tiny grains of clay, have a strong\ntendency to stick together, so they are challenging to erode from\nthe stream bed. 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 623\n\u201cParticles in Suspension and Ions in Solution\u201d by Steven Earle is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\nlicense.\nIt is essential to be aware that a stream can erode and deposit\nsediments simultaneously. At 100 cm\/s, for example, silt, sand, and\nmedium gravel will be eroded from the stream bed and transported\nin suspension, coarse gravel will be held in suspension, pebbles will\nbe both transported and deposited, and cobbles and boulders will\nremain stationary on the stream bed.\nA stream typically reaches its highest velocity when it is close to\nflooding over its banks, known as the bank-full stage. As soon as\nthe flooding stream overtops its banks and occupies the broad area\nof its flood plain, the water has a much larger area to flow through,\nand the velocity drops significantly. At this point, sediment that was\nbeing carried by the high-velocity water is deposited near the edge\nof the channel, forming a natural bank or lev\u00e9e. (11 Water \u2013 An\nIntroduction to Geology, n.d.) 624 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\nStream Types\nStream channels can be straight or curved, deep and slow, or rapid\nand choked with coarse sediments. The cycle of erosion has some\ninfluence on the nature of a stream, but several other factors are\nessential. Youthful streams that are actively downcutting their\nchannels tend to be relatively straight and are typically ungraded\n(meaning that rapids and falls are frequent). Youthful streams\ncommonly have a step-pool morphology, meaning that the stream\nconsists of a series of pools connected by rapids and waterfalls. They\nalso have steep gradients and steep and narrow V-shaped valleys, in\nsome cases steep enough to be called canyons.\n\u201cBlack Canyon and Gunnison River\u201d is a V-shaped river taken by\nTerry Foote and is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International license.\nIn mountainous terrains, steep youthful streams typically flow into\nbroad and low-gradient U-shaped glaciated valleys. The youthful\nstreams have high sediment loads, and when they flow into the 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 625\nlower-gradient glacial valleys where the velocity is not high enough\nto carry all of the sediment, braided patterns develop, characterized\nby a series of narrow channels separated by gravel bars.\n\u201cU-Shaped Valley in Norway\u201d by Petr Smerkl is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nBraided streams can develop anywhere there is more sediment\nthan a stream can transport. One such environment is in volcanic\nregions, where explosive eruptions produce enormous amounts of\nunconsolidated material that gets washed into streams. The\nColdwater River next to Mt. St. Helens in Washington State is an\nexcellent example.\nA stream that occupies a vast, flat flood plain with a low gradient\ntypically carries only sand-sized and finer sediments and develops a\nsinuous flow pattern. When a stream flows around a corner, the\nwater on the outside has farther to go and tends to flow faster. This\nleads to erosion of the banks on the outside of the curve, deposition 626 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\non the inside, and formation of a point bar. Over time, the\nsinuosity of the stream becomes increasingly exaggerated, and the\nchannel migrates around within its flood plain, forming a\nmeandering pattern.\n\u201cBraided Stream\u201d by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration is licensed under Public Domain.\nThe meander in the photo below has reached the point where the\nthin neck of land between two parts of the channel is about to be\neroded. When this happens, an oxbow lake will form. Finally, at\nthe point where a stream enters a still body of water, a lake, or the\nocean, sediment is deposited and a delta forms.\nRivers\nRivers are the largest types of stream, moving substantial amounts\nof water from higher to lower elevations. The Amazon River, the 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 627\nplanet\u2019s most enormous river, has a flow rate of nearly 220,000\ncubic meters per second! People have used rivers since the beginning\nof civilization as a source of water, food, transportation, defense,\npower, recreation, and waste disposal.\n\u201cRed River Meanders\u201d by the US Department of Agriculture is\nlicensed under Public Domain. 628 | 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS\nDivides\nA divide is a topographically high area that separates a landscape\ninto different water basins. The rain that falls on the north side of a\nridge flows into the northern drainage basin, and rain that falls on\nthe south side flows into the southern drainage basin. On a much\ngrander scale, entire continents have divides, known as continental\ndivides.\n\u201cNorth America Water Divides\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 629\nThe pattern of tributaries within a drainage basin depends mainly\non the type of rock beneath, and on structures within that rock\n(folds, fractures, faults, etc.). Dendritic patterns, which are by far\nthe most common, develop in areas where the rock (or\nunconsolidated material) beneath the stream has no particular\nfabric or structure and can be eroded equally easily in all directions.\nExamples would be granite, gneiss, volcanic rock, and sedimentary\nrock that has not been folded. Trellis drainage patterns typically\ndevelop where sedimentary rocks have been folded or tilted and\nthen eroded to varying degrees depending on their strength. The\nRocky Mountains of B.C. and Alberta are an excellent example of\nthis, and many of the drainage systems within the Rockies have\ntrellis patterns. Rectangular patterns develop in areas with little\ntopography and a system of bedding planes, fractures, or faults that\nform a rectangular network. The fourth type of drainage pattern,\nwhich is not specific to a drainage basin, is known as radial. Radial\npatterns form around isolated mountains (such as volcanoes) or\nhills, and the individual streams typically have dendritic drainage\npatterns.

If we compare this with an ungraded stream like\nCawston Creek, we can see that graded streams are steepest in their\nheadwaters, and their gradient gradually decreases toward their\nmouths. Ungraded streams have steep sections at various points,\nand typically have rapids and waterfalls at numerous locations along\ntheir lengths.\nThe ocean is the ultimate base level, but lakes and other rivers act as\nbase levels for many smaller streams. Engineers can create an\nartificial base level on a stream by constructing a dam. Sediments\naccumulate within the flood plain of a stream, and then, if the base\nlevel changes, or if there is less sediment to deposit, the stream may\ncut down through those existing sediments to form terraces.\nIn the late 19th century, American geologist William Davis\nproposed that streams and the surrounding terrain develop in a\ncycle of erosion. Following tectonic uplift, streams erode quickly,\ndeveloping deep V-shaped valleys that follow relatively straight\npaths. Gradients are high, and profiles are ungraded. Rapids and\nwaterfalls are common. During the mature stage, streams erode\nmore broad valleys and start to deposit thick sediment layers.\nGradients are slowly reduced, and grading increases. In old age,\nstreams are surrounded by rolling hills, and they occupy broad\nsediment-filled valleys. Meandering patterns are common.\nDavis\u2019s work was done long before the idea of plate tectonics, and\nhe was not familiar with the impacts of glacial erosion on streams\nand their environments. While some parts of his theory are out of\ndate, it is still a useful way to understand streams and their\nevolution. 6.2 STREAMS AND RIVER SYTEMS | 631\n\u201cDavid\u2019s Cycle of Erosion\u201d by Steven Earle is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. 6.3 WETLANDS\nWetlands are lands that are wet for significant periods. They are\ncommon where water and land meet. Wetlands can be large flat areas\nor small and steep areas. Wetlands are vibrant and unique ecosystems\nwith many species that rely on both the land and the water for\nsurvival. Only specialized plants can grow in these conditions.\nWetlands tend to have a great deal of biological diversity. Wetland\necosystems can also be fragile systems sensitive to the amounts and\nquality of water present within them.

Marshes are 6.3 WETLANDS | 633\nshallow wetlands around lakes, streams, or the ocean where grasses\nand reeds are common, but trees are not. Frogs, turtles, muskrats,\nand many varieties of birds are at home in marshes.\n\u201cBride Book Salt Marsh\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nA swamp is a wetland with lush trees and vines found in a low-\nlying area beside slow-moving rivers. Like marshes, they are often\nor always inundated with water. Since the water in a swamp moves\nslowly, oxygen in the water is often scarce. Swamp plants and\nanimals must be adapted for these low-oxygen conditions. Like\nmarshes, swamps can be freshwater, saltwater, or a mixture of both. 634 | 6.3 WETLANDS\n\u201cNational Wildlife Refuge, Georgia\u201d by the United States Fish and\nWildlife Service is licensed as Public Domain.\nIn an estuary, salt water from the sea mixes with fresh water from\na stream or river. These semi-enclosed areas are home to plants and\nanimals that can tolerate the sharp changes in salt content that the\nconstant motion and mixing of waters create. Estuaries contain\nbrackish water, water that has more salt than freshwater but less\nthan seawater. Because of the rapid changes in salt content, estuaries\nhave many different habitats for plants, animals, and extremely high\nbiodiversity. 6.3 WETLANDS | 635\n\u201cSierra Leone River Estuary\u201d by the European Space Agency is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0\nIGO license.\nEcological Role of Wetlands\nAs mentioned above, wetlands are home to many varied species of\norganisms. Although they make up only 5 percent of the United\nStates area, wetlands contain more than 30 percent of the plant\ntypes. Many endangered species live in wetlands, so wetlands are\nprotected from human use. Wetlands also offer protection from\nstorm surges from tropical storm systems like hurricanes and supply\nsafe, hidden protection for hatchlings.\nWetlands also play a critical biological role by removing pollutants\nfrom water. For example, they can trap and use fertilizer that has\nwashed off a farmer\u2019s field, and therefore they prevent that fertilizer\nfrom contaminating another body of water. Since wetlands 636 | 6.3 WETLANDS\nnaturally purify water, preserving wetlands also help to maintain\nclean supplies of water.\nPonds and Lakes\nPonds and lakes are bordered by hills or low rises so that the water\nis blocked from flowing directly downhill. Ponds are small bodies\nof freshwater that usually have no outlet; ponds are often are fed by\nunderground springs. Lakes are more substantial bodies of water.\nLakes are usually freshwater, although the Great Salt Lake in Utah is\njust one exception. Water usually drains out of a lake through a river\nor a stream, and all lakes lose water to evaporation.\nLarge lakes have tidal systems and currents, and can even affect\nweather patterns. The Great Lakes in the United States contain 22\npercent of the world\u2019s fresh surface water. The largest them, Lake\nSuperior, has a tide that rises and falls several centimeters each day.\nThe Great Lakes are large enough to alter the Northeastern United\nStates\u2019 weather system by the \u201clake effect,\u201d which is an increase in\nsnow downwind of the relatively warm lakes. The Great Lakes are\nhome to countless species of fish and wildlife.\nLakes form in various ways: in depressions carved by glaciers, in\ncalderas, and along tectonic faults, to name a few. Subglacial lakes\nare even found below an ice cap. As a result of geologic history\nand landmasses\u2019 arrangement, most lakes are in the Northern\nHemisphere.\nLimnology is the study of bodies of freshwater and the organisms 6.3 WETLANDS | 637\nthat live there. The ecosystem of a lake is divided into three distinct\nsections:\n\u2022 Surface (littoral) zone is the sloped area closest to the edge of\nthe water.\n\u2022 Open-water zone (also the photic or limnetic zone) has\nabundant sunlight.\n\u2022 Deep-water zone (also the aphotic or profundal zone) has\nlittle or no sunlight.\nThere are several life zones found within a lake. In the littoral zone,\nsunlight promotes plant growth, which provides food and shelter\nto animals such as snails, insects, and fish. In the open-water zone,\nother plants and fish, such as bass and trout, live. The deep-water\nzone does not have photosynthesis since there is no sunlight. Most\ndeep-water organisms are scavengers, such as crabs and catfish that\nfeed on dead organisms that fall to the bottom of the lake. Fungi\nand bacteria aid in the decomposition in the deep zone. Though\ndifferent creatures live in the oceans, ocean waters also have these\nsame divisions based on sunlight with similar types of creatures that\nlive in each of the zones.\nLakes are not permanent features of a landscape. Some come and go\nwith the seasons, as water levels rise and fall. Over a longer time, lakes\ndisappear when they fill with sediments, if the springs or streams\nthat fill them diminish, or if their outlets grow because of erosion.\nWhen the climate of an area changes, lakes can either expand or\nshrink. Lakes may disappear if precipitation significantly diminishes. 6.4 FLOODS\nFloods, an overflow of water in one place, are a natural part of the\nwater cycle, but they can be terrifying forces of destruction. Floods\ncan occur for a variety of reasons, and their effects can be minimized\nin several ways. Perhaps unsurprisingly, floods tend to affect low-\nlying areas most severely. Floods usually occur when precipitation\nfalls more quickly than that water can be absorbed into the ground\nor carried away by rivers or streams. Waters may build up gradually\nthroughout weeks when an extended period of rainfall or snowmelt\nfills the ground with water and raises stream levels.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 6.4 FLOODS | 639\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=516\nFlash floods are sudden and unexpected, taking place when very\nheavy rains fall over a very brief period. A flash flood may do its\ndamage miles from where the rain falls if the water travels far down\na dry streambed so that the flash flood occurs far from the location\nof the original storm.\nDensely vegetated lands are less likely to experience flooding. Plants\nslow down water as it runs over the land, giving it time to enter the\nground. Even if the ground is too wet to absorb more water, plants\nstill slow the water\u2019s passage and increase the time between rainfall\nand the water\u2019s arrival in a stream; this could keep all the water\nfalling over a region to hit the stream at once. Wetlands function as\na buffer between land and high-water levels and play a key role in\nminimizing the impacts of floods. Flooding is often more severe in\nareas that have been recently logged. 640 | 6.4 FLOODS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=516\nWhen a dam breaks along a reservoir, flooding can be catastrophic.\nHigh water levels have also caused small dams to break, wreaking\nhavoc downstream. People try to protect areas that might flood\nwith dams, and dams are remarkably effective. People may also line\na riverbank with levees, high walls that keep the stream within its\nbanks during floods. A levee in one location may force the high\nwater up or downstream and cause flooding there. The New\nMadrid Overflow in the image above was created with the\nrecognition that the Mississippi River sometimes cannot be\ncontained by levees and must be allowed to flood. 6.4 FLOODS | 641\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=516\nNot all the consequences of flooding are negative. Rivers deposit\nnew nutrient-rich sediments when they flood, and so floodplains\nhave traditionally been suitable for farming. Flooding as a source of\nnutrients was essential to Egyptians along the Nile River until the\nAswan Dam was built in the 1960s. Although the dam protects\ncrops and settlements from the annual floods, farmers must now\nuse fertilizers to feed their crops.\nFloods are also responsible for moving substantial amounts of\nsediments about within streams. These sediments provide habitats\nfor animals, and the periodic movement of sediment is crucial to\nthe lives of several types of organisms. Plants and fish along the 642 | 6.4 FLOODS\nColorado River, for example, depend on seasonal flooding to\nrearrange sand bars. 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nGroundwater is stored in the open spaces within rocks and within\nunconsolidated sediments. Rocks and sediments near the surface\nare under less pressure than those at significant depth and therefore\ntend to have more open space. For this reason, and because it is\nexpensive to drill deep wells, most of the groundwater that is\naccessed by individual users is within the first 100 m of the surface.\nSome municipal, agricultural, and industrial groundwater users get\ntheir water from greater depth, but deeper groundwater tends to be\nof lower quality than shallow groundwater, so there is a limit to\nhow deep we can go. 644 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=518\nPorosity is the percentage of open space within unconsolidated\nsediment or rock. Primary porosity is represented by the spaces\nbetween grains in a sediment or sedimentary rock. Secondary\nporosity is porosity that has developed after the rock has formed. It\ncan include fracture porosity, space within fractures in any rock.\nSome volcanic rock has a particular type of porosity related to\nvesicles, and some limestone has increased porosity related to\ncavities within fossils.\nRECHARGE AREA\nDISCHARGE AREA\nPUMPED WELL\nWater table\nDays Years\nUn ac qo un iff ein red\nYears Days\nConfining bed\nConfined\naquifer Centuries\nConfining bed\nConfined\naquifer Millennia\n\u201cGroundwater Flow\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is\nlicensed under Public Domain.\nmaertS 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 645\nPorosity is expressed as a percentage calculated from the volume of\nopen space in a rock compared with the total volume of rock.\nUnconsolidated sediments tend to have higher porosity than\nconsolidated ones because they have no cement, and most have not\nbeen strongly compressed. Finer-grained materials (e.g., silt and\nclay) tend to have greater porosity, some as high as 70 percent, than\ncoarser materials (e.g., gravel). Primary porosity tends to be higher\nin well-sorted sediments compared to poorly sorted sediments,\nwhere there is a range of smaller particles to fill the spaces made by\nthe larger particles. Glacial till, which has a wide range of grain\nsizes and is typically formed under compression beneath glacial ice,\nhas relatively low porosity.\n\u201cTerminus of the Fox Glacier, New Zealand\u201d by Paul Morris is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0\nGeneric license. 646 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nConsolidation and cementation during the process of lithification\nof unconsolidated sediments into sedimentary rocks reduce primary\nporosity. Sedimentary rocks generally have porosities in the range of\n10 percent to 30 percent, some of which may be secondary\n(fracture) porosity. The grain size, sorting, compaction, and degree\nof cementation of the rocks all primary influence porosity. For\nexample, poorly sorted and well-cemented sandstone and well-\ncompressed mudstone can have incredibly low porosity. Igneous or\nmetamorphic rocks have the lowest primary porosity because they\ncommonly form at depth and have interlocking crystals. Most of\ntheir porosity comes in the form of secondary porosity in fractures.\nOf the consolidated rocks, well-fractured volcanic rocks and\nlimestone with cavernous openings produced by dissolution have\nthe highest potential porosity, while intrusive igneous and\nmetamorphic rocks, which formed under enormous pressure, have\nthe lowest. Porosity is a measure of how much water can be stored\nin geological materials. Most rocks have some porosity and\ntherefore contain groundwater. Groundwater is found under the\nground and everywhere on the planet. Considering that\nsedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments cover about 75\npercent of the continental crust with an average thickness of a few\nhundred meters and that they are likely to have around 20 percent\nporosity on average, it is easy to see that a considerable volume of\nwater can be stored in the ground.\nPorosity is a description of how much space there could be to hold\nwater under the ground, and permeability describes how those\npores are shaped and interconnected. This determines how easy it is\nfor water to flow from one pore to the next. Larger pores mean\nthere is less friction between flowing water and the sides of the 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 647\npores. Smaller pores mean more friction along pore walls, but also\nmore twists and turns for the water to have to flow-through. A\npermeable material has a sizable number of well-connected pores\nspaces, while an impermeable material has fewer, smaller pores that\nare poorly connected. Permeability is the most crucial variable in\ngroundwater. Permeability describes how easily water can flow\nthrough the rock or unconsolidated sediment and how easy it will\nbe to extract it for our purposes. The characteristic of permeability\nof a geological material is quantified by geoscientists and engineers\nusing some different units, but the most common is the hydraulic\nconductivity. The symbol used for hydraulic conductivity is K.\nAlthough hydraulic conductivity can be expressed in a range of\ndifferent units, in this book, we will always use m\/s. (Earle, 2015)\nUnconsolidated materials are generally more permeable than the\ncorresponding rocks (compare sand with sandstone, for example),\nand the coarser materials are much more permeable than the finer\nones. The least permeable rocks are unfractured intrusive igneous\nand metamorphic rocks, followed by unfractured mudstone,\nsandstone, and limestone. The permeability of sandstone can vary\nwidely depending on the degree of sorting and the amount of\ncement present. Fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks,\nespecially fractured volcanic rocks, can be highly permeable, as can\nlimestone dissolve along fractures and bedding planes to create\nsolutional openings. Both sand and clay deposits (and sandstone\nand mudstone) are quite porous (30 percent to 50 percent for sand\nand 40 percent to 70 percent for silt and clay), but while sand can\nbe quite permeable, clay and mudstone are not.\nWe have now seen a wide range of porosity in geological materials 648 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nand an even more extensive range of permeability. Groundwater\nexists everywhere there is porosity. However, whether groundwater\ncan flow in significant quantities depends on the permeability. An\naquifer is a body of rock or unconsolidated sediment with\nsufficient permeability to allow water to flow through it.\nUnconsolidated materials like gravel, sand, and even silt make\nrelatively good aquifers, as do rocks like sandstone. Other rocks can\nbe suitable aquifers if they are well fractured. An aquitard is a body\nthat does not transmit a significant amount of water, such as clay, a\ntill, or a poorly fractured igneous or metamorphic rock. These are\nrelative terms, not absolute, and are usually defined based on\nsomeone\u2019s desire to pump groundwater; an aquifer to someone\nwho does not need much water may be an aquitard to someone else\nwho does. An aquifer that is exposed at the ground surface is called\nan unconfined aquifer. An aquifer where there is a lower\npermeability material between the aquifer and the ground surface is\nknown as a confined aquifer, and the aquitard separating the\nground surface, and the aquifer is known as the confining layer.\nIf a person were to go out into their garden or a forest or a park and\nstart digging, they would find that the soil is moist (unless you are\nin a desert), but it is not saturated with water. This means that some\nof the pore space in the soil is occupied by water, and some of the\npore space is occupied by air (unless you are in a swamp). This is\nknown as the unsaturated zone. If a person were to dig down far\nenough, they would get to the point where all of the pore spaces are\n100 percent filled with water (saturated), and the bottom of your\nhole would fill up with water. The level of water in the hole\nrepresents the water table, which is the surface of the saturated\nzone. 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 649\nWater falling on the ground surface as precipitation (rain, snow,\nhail, fog, etc.) may flow off a hill slope directly to a stream in the\nform of runoff, or it may infiltrate the ground, where it is stored in\nthe unsaturated zone. The water in the unsaturated zone may be\nused by plants (transpiration), evaporate from the soil\n(evaporation), or continue past the root zone and flow down to the\nwater table, where it recharges the groundwater.\nIn areas with topographic relief, the water table generally follows\nthe land surface, but tends to come closer to surface in valleys, and\nintersects the surface where there are streams or lakes. The water\ntable can be determined from the depth of water in a well that is\nnot being pumped. Although, that only applies if the well is within\nan unconfined aquifer. In this case, most of the hillside forms the\nrecharge area, where water from precipitation flows downward\nthrough the unsaturated zone to reach the water table. The area at\nthe stream or lake to which the groundwater is flowing is a\ndischarge area.\nWhat makes water flow from the recharge areas to the discharge\nareas? Recall that water is flowing in pores where there is friction,\nwhich means it takes work to move the water. There is also some\nfriction between water molecules themselves, which is determined\nby the viscosity-ty. Water has a low viscosity, but friction is still a\nfactor. All flowing fluids are always losing energy to friction with\ntheir surroundings. Water will flow from areas with high energy to\nthose with low energy. Recharge areas are at higher elevations,\nwhere the water has high gravitational energy. It was energy from\nthe sun that evaporated the water into the atmosphere and lifted it 650 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nto the recharge area. The water loses this gravitational energy as it\nflows from the recharge area to the discharge area.\nThe situation gets a lot more complicated in the case of confined\naquifers, but they are es-essential sources of water, so we need to\nunderstand how they work. There is always a water table, which\napplies even if the geological materials at the surface have incredibly\nlow permeability. Where there is a confined aquifer, meaning one\nthat is separated from the surface by a confining layer, this aquifer\nwill have its own \u201cwater table,\u201d which is called a potentiometric\nsurface, as it is a measure of the total potential energy of the water.\nHowever, if we drill a well through both the unconfined aquifer\nand the confining layer and into the confined aquifer, the water will\nrise above the top of the confined aquifer to its potentiometric\nsurface. This is known as an artesian well because the water rises\nabove the top of the aquifer. In some situations, the potentiometric\nsurface may be above the ground level. The water in a well drilled\ninto the confined aquifer in this situation would rise above ground\nlevel, and flow out if it is not capped. This is known as a flowing\nartesian well. 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 651\nPervious Strata\nImpervious Strata\nSaturation level\nArtesian Well\n\u201cArtesian Well\u201d by Andrew Dunn is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license.\nIt is critical to understand that groundwater does not flow in\nunderground streams nor form underground lakes. Except karst\nareas, with caves in limestone, groundwater flows very slowly\nthrough granular sediments or solid rock with fractures in it. Flow\nvelocities of several centimeters per day are possible in significantly\npermeable sediments with significant hydraulic gradients. However,\nin many cases, permeabilities are lower than the ones we have used\nas examples here, and in many areas, gradients are much lower. It is\ncommon for groundwater to flow at velocities of a few millimeters\nto a few centimeters per year.\nAs already noted, groundwater does not flow in straight lines. It\nflows from areas of higher hydraulic head to areas of lower hydraulic\nhead, and this means that it can flow \u201cuphill\u201d in many situations.\nGroundwater flows at right angles to the equipotential lines in the\nsame way that water flowing down a slope would flow at right 652 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nangles to the contour lines. The stream in this scenario is the\nlocation with the lowest hydraulic potential, so the groundwater\nthat flows to the lower parts of the aquifer has to flow upward to\nreach this location. It is forced upward by the pressure differences,\nfor example, the difference between the 112 and 110 equipotential\nlines.\nGroundwater that flows through caves, including those in karst\nareas, where caves have been formed in limestone because of\ndissolution, behaves differently from groundwater in other\nsituations. Caves above the water table are air-filled conduits, and\nthe water that flows within these conduits is not under pressure; it\nresponds only to gravity. In other words, it flows downhill along the\ngradient of the cave floor. Many limestone caves also extend below\nthe water table and into the saturated zone. Here water behaves in a\nsimilar way to any other groundwater, and it flows according to the\nhydraulic gradient.\nThe Water Table\nFor a groundwater aquifer to hold the same amount of water, the\namount of recharge must equal the amount of discharge. In wet\nregions, streams are fed by groundwater; the stream\u2019s surface is the\ntop of the water table. In dry regions, water seeps down from the\nstream into the aquifer, often dry much of the year. Water leaves a\ngroundwater reservoir in streams or springs, where people take\nwater from aquifers.\nAlthough groundwater levels do not rise and fall as rapidly as at the\nsurface, over time, the water table will rise during wet periods and 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 653\nfall during droughts. One of the most interesting but extremely\natypical types of aquifers are found in Florida. Although aquifers\nare very rarely underground rivers, in Florida, water has dissolved\nthe limestone so that streams travel underground and aboveground.\n(Components of Groundwater | Geology, n.d.)\nGroundwater Use\nGroundwater is a significant water source for people. Groundwater\ncan be a renewable resource, as long as when the water pumped\nfrom the aquifer is replenished. It is essential for anyone who\nintends to dig a well to know how deep the water table is beneath\nthe surface. Because groundwater involves interaction between the\nEarth and the water, the study of groundwater is called\nhydrogeology. Some aquifers are overused; people pump out more\nwater than is replaced. As the water is pumped out, the water table\nslowly falls, requiring wells to be dug deeper, which takes more\nmoney and energy. Wells may go completely dry if they are not deep\nenough to reach into the lowered water table. 654 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The aquifer is found from 30 to 100\nmeters deep over about 440,000 square kilometers! The water in\nthe aquifer is mostly from the last ice age. People widely use the\nOgallala Aquifer for municipal and agricultural needs. About eight\ntimes more water is taken from the Ogallala Aquifer each year than\nis replenished. Much of the water is used for irrigation of crops in\nthe Breadbasket of the central plains. Currently, there is great\nconcern about the long-term health of this vast aquifer because it is\nbeing tapped into and used at a higher rate than being replenished\nby natural processes. This could have huge implications regarding\nfood production in the country if this critical water source is 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 655\ndepleted. At current rates of use, 70 percent of the aquifer could be\ngone by 2050.\n\u201cOgallala Aquifer and Keystone Pipeline\u201d is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. 656 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nOveruse and lowering of the water tables of aquifers could have\nother impacts as well. Lowering the water table may cause the\nground surface to sink. Subsidence may occur beneath houses and\nother structures. When coastal aquifers are overused, salt water\nfrom the ocean may enter the aquifer, contaminating the aquifer\nand making it less useful for drinking and irrigation.

A spring 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 657\nmay be constant, or may only flow at certain times of the year.\nTowns in many locations depend on water from springs. Springs\ncan also be a vital source of water in locations where surface water is\nscarce.\nA well is created by digging or drilling to reach groundwater. When\nthe water table is close to the surface, wells are a convenient method\nfor extracting water. When the water table is far below the surface,\nspecialized equipment must be used to dig a well. Most wells use\nmotorized pumps to bring water to the surface, but some still\nrequire people to use a bucket to draw water up.\nFinally, it is also essential to understand how water is cleaned,\nfiltered, and delivered to our homes and work. Many of us do not\nknow where our water comes from, and we take it for granted. This\noften leads to the wasteful water use of our lawns, showers, and\nother appliances.\nGroundwater Quality\nOne good thing about groundwater as a source of water is that it is\nnot as easily contaminated as surface water. However, there are two\ncaveats to that: one is that groundwater can become naturally\ncontaminated because of its very close connection to the materials\nof its aquifer, and the second is that once contaminated by human\nactivities, groundwater is very difficult to clean up. (Earle, 2019) 658 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nNatural Contamination of Groundwater\nGroundwater moves slowly through an aquifer, and unlike the\nsurface water of a stream, it has many contacts with the\nsurrounding rock or sediment. In most aquifers, the geological\nmaterials that make up the aquifer are relatively inert or are made\nup of minerals that dissolve very slowly into the groundwater. Over\ntime, however, all groundwater gradually has increased material\ndissolved within it as it remains in contact with the aquifer. In some\nareas, that rock or sediment includes some minerals that could\ncontaminate the water with elements that might make the water less\nthan ideal for human consumption or agricultural use. Examples\ninclude copper, arsenic, mercury, fluorine, sodium, and boron. In\nsome cases, contamination may occur because the aquifer material\nhas unusually high levels of the element in question. In other cases,\nthe aquifer material is just natural rock or sediment, but some\nparticular feature of the water or the aquifer allows contaminants to\nbuild up to significant levels.\nRural residents in the densely populated country of Bangladesh\n(over 1,000 residents\/km2, compared with 3.4\/km2 in Canada)\nused to rely mostly on surface supplies for their drinking water, and\nmany of these were subject to bacterial contamination. Infant\nmortality rates were among the highest in the world, and other\nillnesses such as diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis\nwere common. In the 1970s, international agencies, including\nUNICEF, started a program of drilling wells to access abundant\ngroundwater supplies at depths of 20 m to 100 m. Eventually, over\n8 million such wells were drilled. Infant mortality and illness rates 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 659\ndropped dramatically, but it was later discovered that the water\nfrom a high proportion of these wells has arsenic above safe levels.\nMost of the wells in the affected areas are drilled into recent\nsediments of the vast delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers.\nWhile these sediments are not particularly enriched in arsenic, they\nhave enough organic matter to use up any oxygen present. This\nleads to water with a naturally low oxidation potential (anoxic\nconditions); arsenic is highly soluble under these conditions, and so\nany arsenic present in the sediments easily gets dissolved into the\ngroundwater. Arsenic poisoning leads to headaches, confusion, and\ndiarrhea, and eventually to vomiting, stomach pain, and\nconvulsions. If not treated, the outcomes are heart disease, stroke,\ncancer, diabetes, coma, and death. There are ways to treat arsenic-\nrich groundwater, but it is a challenge in Bangladesh to implement\nthe simple and effective technology that is available. (Earle, 2019)\nAnthropogenic Contamination of\nGroundwater\nGroundwater can become contaminated by pollution at the surface\n(or at depth), and there are many different anthropogenic (human-\ncaused) sources of contamination. The vulnerability of aquifers to\npollution depends on several factors, including the depth to the\nwater table, the permeability of the material between the surface\nand the aquifer, the aquifer\u2019s permeability, the slope of the surface,\nand the amount of precipitation. Confined aquifers tend to be\nmuch less vulnerable than unconfined ones, and deeper aquifers are\nless vulnerable than shallow ones. Steeper slopes mean that surface\nwater tends to run off rather than infiltrate (and this can reduce the 660 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\npossibility of contamination). Contamination risk is also less in dry\nareas than in areas with heavy rainfall. (Earle, 2019)\n\u201cCrop Circles, Kansas \u201d by NASA is licensed under Public Domain.\nThe principal sources of anthropogenic groundwater\ncontamination include the following:\n\u2022 Chemicals and animal waste related to agriculture, and\nchemicals applied to golf courses and domestic gardens\n\u2022 Agriculture\n\u2022 Landfills\n\u2022 Industrial operations 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 661\n\u2022 Mines, quarries, and other rock excavations\n\u2022 Leaking fuel storage tanks (especially those at gas stations)\n\u2022 Septic systems\n\u2022 Runoff from roads (e.g., winter salting) or chemical spills of\nmaterials being transported\nLandfills\nIn the past, domestic and commercial refuse was commonly\ntrucked to a \u201cdump\u201d (typically a hole in the ground), and when the\nhole was filled, it was covered with soil and forgotten. In situations\nlike this, rain and melting snow can easily pass through the soil used\nto cover the refuse. This water passes into the waste itself, and the\nresulting landfill leachate that flows from the bottom of the landfill\ncan seriously contaminate the surrounding groundwater and\nsurface water. In the past few decades, regulations around refuse\ndisposal have been significantly strengthened, and significant steps\nhave been taken to reduce the amount of landfill waste by diverting\nrecyclable and compostable materials to other locations.\nA modern engineered landfill has an impermeable liner (typically\nheavy plastic, although engineered clay liners or natural clay may be\nadequate in some cases), a plumbing system for draining leachate\n(the rainwater that flows through the refuse and becomes\ncontaminated), and a network of monitoring wells both within and\naround the landfill. Once a part or all of a landfill site is full, it is\nsealed over with a plastic cover, and a system is put in place to\nextract landfill gas (typically a mixture of carbon dioxide and\nmethane). That gas can be sent to a nearby location where it is\nburned to create heat or used to generate electricity. The leachate 662 | 6.5 GROUNDWATER\nmust be treated, and that can be done in a typical sewage treatment\nplant.\nThe monitoring wells are used to assess the water table level around\nthe landfill and collect groundwater samples so that any leakage can\nbe detected. Because some leakage is almost inevitable, the ideal\nplacement for landfills is in areas where the depth to the water table\nis significant (tens of meters if possible) and where the aquifer\nmaterial is relatively impermeable. Landfills should also be situated\nfar from streams, lakes, or wetlands to avoid contamination of\naquatic habitats.\nToday, hundreds of abandoned dumps are scattered across the\ncountry; most have been left to contaminate groundwater that we\nmight wish to use sometime in the future. In many cases, it is\nunlikely that we will be able to do so. (Earle, 2019)\nMines, Quarries, and Rock Excavations\nMines and other operations that involve the excavation of\nsubstantial amounts of rock (e.g., highway construction) have the\npotential to create severe environmental damage. The exposure of\nrock that has previously not been exposed to air and water can lead\nto the oxidation of sulfide-bearing minerals, such as pyrite, within\nthe rock. The combination of pyrite, water, oxygen, and a\nparticular type of bacteria (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) that\nthrives in acidic conditions leads to the generation of acidity, in\nsome cases, to pH less than 2. Water that acidic is hazardous by\nitself, but the low pH also increases the solubility of certain heavy\nmetals. The water that is generated by this process is known as acid\nrock drainage (ARD). ARD can occur naturally where sulfide- 6.5 GROUNDWATER | 663\nbearing rocks are near the surface. The issue of ARD is a primary\nenvironmental concern at both operating mines and abandoned\nmines. Groundwater adjacent to the contaminated streams in the\narea is very likely contaminated as well.\nLeaking Fuel Tanks\nUnderground storage tanks (USTs) are used to store fuel at gas\nstations, industrial sites, airports, and anywhere that large volumes\nof fuel are used. They do not last forever, and eventually, they start\nto leak their contents into the ground. This is a problem at older gas\nstations, although it may also become a future problem at newer gas\nstations. Sometimes a gas station can be seen that is closed and\nsurrounded by a chain-link fence. In virtually all such cases, the\ndiscovery of leaking USTs and the requirement has triggered the\nclosure to cease operations and remediate the site.\nPetroleum fuels are complex mixtures of hydrocarbon compounds\nand the properties of their components \u2013 such as density, viscosity,\nsolubility in water, and volatility \u2013 tend to vary widely. As a result, a\npetroleum spill is like several spills for the price of one. The\npetroleum liquid slowly settles through the unsaturated zone and\nthen tends to float on the surface of the groundwater. The more\nreadily soluble components of the spill dissolve in the groundwater\nand are dispersed along with the normal groundwater flow, and the\nmore volatile components of the spill rise toward the surface,\npotentially contaminating buildings.

From space, the dominance of water is clear because most of\nit is stored in Earth\u2019s oceans. (Oceans and Coastal Environments |\nEarth Science, n.d.)\nEarth would not be the same planet without its oceans. The oceans,\nalong with the atmosphere, keep Earth\u2019s surface temperatures\nrelatively constant worldwide. Some places on Earth reach as cold as\n-7 degrees Celsius, while other places reach as hot as 55 degrees 674 | 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN\nCelsius. On other planets like Mercury, temperatures range from\n-180 degrees Celsius to 430 degrees Celsius. (Significance of the\nOceans | Physical Geography, n.d.)\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=529\nThe oceans, along with the atmosphere, distribute heat around the\nplanet. The oceans absorb heat near the equator and then transport\nthat solar energy to polar regions. The oceans also moderate the\nclimate within a region. At the same latitude, the temperature range\nis smaller and coastal areas compared to areas farther inland. Along\ncoastal areas, summer temperatures are not as hot, and winter\ntemperatures are not as cold, because water takes a long time to heat\nup or cool down. 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN | 675\nBiologically Rich\nThe oceans are an essential part of Earth\u2019s water cycle. Since they\ncover so much of the planet, most evaporation comes from the\nocean, and most precipitation falls on the oceans.\n\u201cCoral Reef at the Andaman Islands\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe oceans are also home to an enormous amount of life. That is,\nthey have tremendous biodiversity. Tiny ocean plants create the\nbase of a food web that supports all sorts of life forms. Marine life\nmakes up most of all biomass on Earth. Biomass is the total mass of\nliving organisms in a given area. These organisms supply us with\nfood and even the oxygen created by marine plants. 676 | 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN\nContinental Margins\nRecall from the chapter on Plate Tectonics that the ocean floor is\nnot flat. Mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea trenches, and other features all\nrise sharply above or plunge deeply below the abyssal plains. Earth\u2019s\ntallest mountain is Mauna Kea volcano, which rises 10,203 m\n(33,476 ft.) from the Pacific Ocean floor to become one of the\nvolcanic mountains of Hawaii. The deepest canyon is also on the\nocean floor, the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench, 10,916 m\n(35,814 ft). The mapping of the ocean floor and coastal margins is\ncalled bathymetry. (Introduction to the Oceans | Earth Science,\nn.d.)\n\u201cBathymetry of the Hawaiian Archipelago\u201d by the USGS is licensed\nas Public Domain. 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN | 677\nThe continental margin is the transition from the land to the\ndeep sea or, geologically speaking, from continental crust to oceanic\ncrust. More than one-quarter of the ocean basin is the continental\nmargin.\nComposition of Ocean Water\nThe ocean\u2019s water is a complex system of organic and inorganic\nsubstances. Water is a polar molecule that can dissolve many\nsubstances such as salts, sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules.\nSaltwater comes come water that moves through rock and soil on\nthe land and picks up ions. This is the flip side of weathering. Salts\ncomprise about 3.5 percent of the mass of ocean water, but the salt\ncontent or salinity is different in various locations.\n\u201cComposition of Ocean Water\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license. 678 | 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN\nIn places like estuaries, seawater mixes with freshwater, causing\nsalinity to be much lower than average. Where there is lots of\nevaporation, but minimal circulation of water, salinity can be much\nhigher. The Dead Sea has 30 percent salinity, nearly nine times the\naverage salinity of ocean water. It is called the Dead Sea because\nnothing can survive within it because of its salinity. (Significance of\nthe Oceans | Physical Geography, n.d.)\nLayers of the Ocean\nIn 1960, two scientists in a specially designed submarine called the\nTrieste descended into a submarine trench called the Challenger\nDeep (10,910 meters). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a\nlot shallower than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for\nsea creatures to live in. Three significant factors make the deep\nocean hard to inhabit: the absence of light, low temperature, and\nextremely high pressure. The National Weather Service as\ninformation on the layers of the ocean. (Layers of the Ocean |\nPhysical Geography, n.d.)\nVertical Divisions\nTo better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the\nwater column by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two\nzones vertically, based on the light level. Large lakes are divided into\nsimilar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth\nof about 200 m, creating the photic zone (consisting of the\nSunlight Zone and Twilight Zone). Organisms that\nphotosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN | 679\nto the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as\nphytoplankton, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to\nthe rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live\nin or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone (consisting of\nthe Midnight Zone and the Abyss), there is not enough light for\nphotosynthesis. The aphotic zone makes up most of the ocean, but\nhas a small amount of its life, both in the diversity of type and\nnumbers. (Introduction to the Oceans | Earth Science, n.d.)\n\u201cThermocline\u201d by NOAA is licensed as Public Domain.\nHorizontal Divisions\nThe seabed is also divided into the zones described above, but the\nocean itself is separated horizontally by distance from the shore.\nNearest to the shore lies the intertidal zone, the region between\nthe high and low tidal marks. This hallmark of the intertidal is\nchanged, where water is in constant motions from ocean waves,\ntides, and currents. The land is sometimes underwater and\nsometimes is exposed. The neritic zone is from low tide mark and\nslopes gradually down to the edge of the seaward side of the\ncontinental shelf. Some sunlight penetrates the seabed here. The 680 | 7.1 SIGNIFICANCE OF OCEAN\noceanic zone is the entire rest of the ocean from the bottom edge\nof the neritic zone, where sunlight does not reach the bottom.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The stronger the wind, the longer it blows,\nand the larger the area of water over which it blows (the fetch), the\nlarger the waves are likely to be.\nThe essential parameters of a wave are its wavelength (the\nhorizontal distance between two crests or two troughs), its\namplitude (the vertical distance between a trough and a crest),\nand its velocity (the speed at which wave crests move across the\nwater). Relatively small waves move up to about 10 km\/h and arrive\non a shore about once every 3 seconds. Huge waves move about five\ntimes faster (over 50 km\/h), but because their wavelengths are so\nmuch longer, they arrive less often \u2013 about once every 14 seconds.\n(17.1 Waves \u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.) 682 | 7.2 WAVES\n\u201cWavelength\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nAs a wave moves across the water\u2019s surface, the water itself mostly\nmoves up and down and only moves a small amount in the\ndirection of wave motion. As this happens, a point on the water\nsurface describes a circle with a diameter equal to the wave\namplitude. This motion is also transmitted to the water\nunderneath, and the water is disturbed by a wave to a depth of\napproximately one-half of the wavelength.\nThe one-half wavelength depth of disturbance of the water beneath\na wave is known as the wave base. Since ocean waves rarely have\nwavelengths higher than 200 m, and the open ocean is several\nthousand meters deep, the wave base does not frequently interact\nwith the ocean\u2019s bottom. However, as waves approach the much\nshallower water near the shore, they start to \u201cfeel\u201d the bottom, and\nthey are affected by that interaction. The wave \u201corbits\u201d are both 7.2 WAVES | 683\nflattened and slowed by dragging, and the implications are that the\nwave amplitude (height) increases, and the wavelength decreases\n(the waves become much steeper). The ultimate result of this is that\nthe waves lean forward, and eventually break. (17.1 Waves \u2013\nPhysical Geology, n.d.)\nWaves usually approach the shore at an angle, and this means that\none part of the wave feels the bottom sooner than the rest of it, so\nthe part that feels the bottom first slows down first. In open water,\nthese waves had wavelengths close to 100 m. In the shallow water\ncloser to shore, the wavelengths decreased to around 50 m, and in\nsome cases, even less.\nEven though they bend and become nearly parallel to the shore,\nmost waves still reach the shore at a small angle, and as each one\narrives, it pushes water along the shore, creating what is known as a\nlongshore current within the surf zone where waves are breaking.\n(Ocean Movements | Earth Science, n.d.)\nAnother significant effect of waves reaching the shore at an angle is\nthat when they wash up onto the beach, they do so at an angle, but\nwhen that same wave water washes back down the beach, it moves\nstraight down the slope of the beach. The upward-moving water,\nknown as the swash, pushes sediment particles along the beach,\nwhile the downward-moving water, the backwash, brings them\nstraight back. With every wave that washes up and down the beach,\nparticles of sediment are moved along the beach in a zigzag pattern.\nThe combined effects of sediment transport within the surf zone by\nthe longshore current and sediment movement along the beach by\nswash and backwash is known as longshore drift. Longshore drift 684 | 7.2 WAVES\nmoves a tremendous amount of sediment along coasts (both oceans\nand large lakes) around the world, and it is responsible for creating a\nvariety of depositional features.\nA rip current is another type of current that develops in the\nnearshore area and has the effect of returning water that has been\npushed up to the shore by incoming waves. Rip currents flow\nstraight out from the shore and are fed by the longshore currents.\nThey die out quickly outside the surf zone but can be dangerous to\nswimmers who get caught in them. If part of a beach does not have\na strong unidirectional longshore current, the rip currents may be\nfed by longshore currents going in both directions.\n\u201cRip Currents\u201d by the National Weather Service is licensed as\nPublic Domain. 7.2 WAVES | 685\nBehavior of Waves Approaching\nShore\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=533\nIn the open sea, waves generally appear choppy because wave trains\nfrom many directions interact with each other. Where crests\nconverge with other crests, called constructive interference, they\nadd together producing peaks, a process referred to as wave\namplification. Constructive interference of troughs produces\nhollows. Where crests converge with troughs, they cancel each\nother out, called destructive interference. As waves approach the\nshore and begin to make frictional contact with the seafloor (i.e., 686 | 7.2 WAVES\nwater depth is a half wavelength or less), they begin to slow down,\nbut the energy carried by the wave remains the same, so they build\nup higher. The water moves in a circular motion as the wave passes,\nwith the water that feeds each circle being drawn from the trough\nin front of the advancing wave. As the wave encounters shallower\nwater at the shore, there is eventually insufficient water in front of\nthe wave to supply a complete circle, and the crest pours over,\ncreating a breaker. (12 Coastlines \u2013 An Introduction to Geology,\nn.d.)\nSome of the damage done by storms is from storm surges. The\nwater piles up at a shoreline as storm winds push waves into the\ncoast. Storm surge may raise sea level as much as 7.5 m (25 ft),\nwhich can be devastating in a shallow land area when winds, waves,\nand rain are heavy.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of 7.2 WAVES | 687\nthe text.

Called tsunamis, these waves are created\nwhen a portion of the seafloor is suddenly elevated by movement in\nthe crustal rocks below that are involved in an earthquake. The\nwater is suddenly lifted, and a wave train spreads out in all\ndirections from the mound carrying enormous energy and traveling\nvery fast (hundreds of miles per hour). 688 | 7.2 WAVES\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=533\nTsunamis may pass unnoticed in the open ocean because the\nwavelength is very long, and the wave height is shallow. However, as\nthe wave train approaches the shore, each wave makes contact with\nthe shallow seafloor, friction increases, and the wave slows down.\nWave height builds up, and the wave strikes the shore as a wall of\nwater a hundred or more feet high. The massive wave may sweep\ninland well beyond the beach. This is called the tsunami run-up,\nwhich destroys structures far inland. Tsunamis deliver a\ncatastrophic blow to observers at the beach as the water in the\ntrough in front of it is drawn back toward the tsunami wave,\nexposing the seafloor. Curious and unsuspecting people on the\nbeach may run out to see exposed offshore sea life only to be 7.2 WAVES | 689\noverwhelmed when the breaking crest hits.

As the Moon revolves around our planet, its\ngravity pulls Earth toward it. The lithosphere is unable to move\nmuch, but the gravity pulls the water above it, and a bulge is\ncreated. This bulge is the high tide beneath the Moon. The Moon\u2019s\ngravity then pulls the Earth toward it, leaving the water on the\nopposite side of the planet behind. This creates a second-high tide\nbulge on the opposite side of Earth from the Moon. These two\nwater bulges on opposite sides of the Earth aligned with the Moon\nare the high tides. (Tides | Earth Science, n.d.)\nSince so much water is pulled into the two high tides, low tides\nform between the two high tides. As the Earth rotates beneath the\nMoon, a single spot will experience two high tides and two low tides\nevery day.\nThe tidal range is the difference between the ocean level at high\ntide and the ocean at low tide. The tidal range in a location depends\non some factors, including the slope of the seafloor. Water appears\nto move a greater distance on a gentle slope than on a steep slope.\n(Ocean Movements | Earth Science, n.d.)\nMonthly Tidal Patterns\nWaves are additive, so when the gravitational pull of the Sun and\nMoon are in the same direction, the high tides add, and the low\ntides add. High tides are higher and low tides are lower than at\nother times throughout the month. These more extreme tides, with 7.2 WAVES | 691\na greater tidal range, are called spring tides. Spring tides do not just\noccur in the spring; they occur whenever the Moon is in a new-\nmoon or full-moon phase, about every 14 days. (Tidal Waves |\nPhysical Geography, n.d.)\nNeap tides are tides that have the smallest tidal range, and they\noccur when the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun form a 90-degree\nangle. They occur precisely halfway between the spring tides when\nthe Moon is at first or last quarter. How do the tides add up to\ncreate neap tides? The Moon\u2019s high tide occurs in the same place as\nthe Sun\u2019s low tide and the Moon\u2019s low tide in the same place as the\nSun\u2019s high tide. At neap tides, the tidal range relatively small.\nHigh tides occur about twice a day, about every 12 hours and 25\nminutes. The reason is that the Moon takes 24 hours and 50\nminutes to rotate once around the Earth, so the Moon is over the\nsame location 24 hours and 50 minutes later. Since high tides occur\ntwice a day, one arrives every 12 hours and 25 minutes. (Tides |\nEarth Science, n.d.)\nSome coastal areas do not follow this pattern at all. These coastal\nareas may have one high and one low tide per day or a different\namount of time between two high tides. These differences are often\nbecause of local conditions, such as the shape of the coastline that\nthe tide is entering. The National Ocean Service has a wealth of\ninformation on tides and water levels. 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS\nSurface Currents\nOcean water moves in predictable ways along the ocean surface.\nSurface currents can flow for thousands of kilometers and can\nreach depths of hundreds of meters. These surface currents do not\ndepend on the weather; they remain unchanged even in large\nstorms because they depend on factors that do not change.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=535\nSurface currents are created by three things: global wind patterns,\nthe rotation of the earth, and ocean basins\u2019 shape. Surface currents\nare significant because they distribute heat around the planet and\nare a significant factor influencing climate around the globe.\n\u201cWhat Causes Ocean Currents.\u201d story map by Esri.\nGlobal Wind Currents\nWinds on Earth are either global or local. Global winds blow in the\nsame directions all the time and are related to the unequal heating\nof Earth by the Sun, that is that more solar radiation strikes the\nequator than the polar regions, and the rotation of the Earth called\nthe Coriolis effect. The causes of the global wind patterns will be\ndescribed later when we look at the atmosphere. (Surface Currents |\nPhysical Geography, n.d.) Water in the surface currents is pushed in\nthe direction of the significant wind belts:\n\u2022 Trade winds are consistent winds that flow east to west\nbetween the equator and 30 degrees North and 30 degrees\nSouth. 694 | 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS\n\u2022 Westerlies are winds that flow west to east in the middle\nlatitudes.\n\u2022 Polar easterlies are winds that flow east to west between 50\ndegrees and 60 degrees north and south of the equator and the\nnorth and south pole.\nRotation of the Earth\nThe wind is not the only factor that affects ocean currents. The\nCoriolis effect describes how Earth\u2019s rotation steers winds and\nsurface ocean currents. The Coriolis effect causes freely moving\nobjects to appear to move to the right in the Northern Hemisphere\nand to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The objects themselves\nare moving straight, but the Earth is rotating beneath them, so they\nseem to bend. 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS | 695\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=535\nAn example might make the Coriolis effect easier to visualize. If an\nairplane flies five hundred miles due north, it will not arrive at the\ncity that was due north of it when it began its journey. Over the\ntime it takes for the airplane to fly five hundred miles, that city\nmoved, along with the Earth it sits on. Therefore, the airplane will\narrive at a city to the west of the original city (in the Northern\nHemisphere) unless the pilot has compensated for the change. So,\nto reach his intended destination, the pilot must also veer right\nwhile flying north.\nAs wind or ocean currents move, the Earth spins underneath it. As\na result, an object moving north or south along the Earth will\nappear to move in a curve, instead of in a straight line. Wind or\nwater that travels toward the poles from the equator is deflected to\nthe east, while wind or water that travels toward the equator from\nthe poles gets bent to the west. The Coriolis effect bends the\ndirection of surface currents to the right in the Northern\nHemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. (Surface\nCurrents | Physical Geography, n.d.)\nDeep Currents\nThermohaline circulation drives deep ocean circulation. Thermo 696 | 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS\nmeans heat, and haline refers to salinity. Differences in temperature\nand salinity change the density of seawater. Thermohaline\ncirculation is the result of density differences in water masses\nbecause of their different temperature and salinity. (Ch 4 Earth\u2019s\nHydrosphere, n.d.)\n\u201cThermohaline Circulation\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nLower temperature and higher salinity yield the densest water.\nWhen a volume of water is cooled, the molecules move less\nvigorously, so the same number of molecules takes up less space,\nand the water is denser. If salt is added to a volume of water, there\nare more molecules in the same volume, so it is denser. Changes in\ntemperature and salinity of seawater take place at the surface. Water\nbecomes dense near the poles. Cold polar air cools the water and\nlowers its temperature, increasing its salinity. Freshwater freezes out\nof seawater to become sea ice, which also increases the salinity of the\nremaining water. This frigid, very saline water is very dense and\nsinks, a process called downwelling.\nTwo things then happen. The dense water pushes deeper water out 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS | 697\nof its way, and that water moves along the bottom of the ocean.\nThis deep-water mixes with less dense water as it flows. Surface\ncurrents move water into the space vacated at the surface where the\ndense water sank. Water also sinks into the deep ocean off\nAntarctica. Since unlimited amounts of water cannot sink to the\nocean\u2019s bottom, water must rise from the deep ocean to the surface\nsomewhere. This process is called upwelling.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=535\nUpwelling occurs along the coast when the wind blows water\nstrongly away from the shore. This leaves a void that is filled with\ndeep water that rises to the surface. Upwelling is significant where it\noccurs. During its time on the bottom, the cold deep water has\ncollected nutrients that have fallen through the water column. 698 | 7.3 OCEAN CURRENTS\nUpwelling brings those nutrients to the surface. That nutrient\nsupports the growth of plankton and forms the base of a vibrant\necosystem. California, South America, South Africa, and the\nArabian Sea all benefit from offshore upwelling. Upwelling also\ntakes place along the equator between the North and South\nEquatorial Currents. Winds blow the surface water north and south\nof the equator, so deep water undergoes upwelling. The nutrients\nrise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial\noceans. (Deep Currents | Physical Geography, n.d.)\n\u201cHow Ocean Currents Impact the World\u201d story map by\nEsri. 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND\nLANDFORMS\nTopology of the Sea Floor\nOceans cover 71 percent of Earth\u2019s surface and hold 97 percent of\nEarth\u2019s water. The water the oceans hold is critical to plate\ntectonics, volcanism, and, of course, life on Earth. We know more\nabout the surface of the Moon than the floor of the oceans.\nWhether this is true or not, the critical point is that the ocean floor\nis covered with an average of nearly 4,000 m of water, and it is pitch\nblack below a few hundred meters, so it is not easy to discover what\nis down there. We know a lot more about the oceans than we used\nto, but there is still a great deal more to discover. (Earle, 2015)\nEarth has had oceans for a very long time, dating back to the point\nwhere the surface had cooled enough to allow liquid water, only a\nfew hundred million years after Earth\u2019s formation. At that time,\nthere were no continental rocks, so the water that was here was\nlikely spread out over the surface in one giant (but relatively\nshallow) ocean. (Earle, 2019)\nWe examined the seafloor\u2019s topography from the perspective of\nplate tectonics, but here we are going to take another look at the\nessential features from an oceanographic perspective. The essential\nfeatures are the extensive continental shelves less than 250 m deep 700 | 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS\n(pink); the vast deep ocean plains between 4,000 and 6,000 m deep\n(light and dark blue); the mid-Atlantic ridge, in many areas\nshallower than 3,000 m; and the deep ocean trench north of Puerto\nRico. (18.1 The Topography of the Sea Floor \u2013 Physical Geology,\nn.d.)\n\u201cTopography of the Atlantic Ocean Sea Floor\u201d by NASA is licensed\nas Public Domain.\nThe main features of the Pacific Ocean floor are the continental\nslopes, which drop from about 200 m to several thousand meters\nover a distance of a few hundred kilometers; the abyssal plains \u2013\nexceedingly flat and from 4,000 m to 6,000 m deep; volcanic\nseamounts and islands; and trenches at subduction zones that are\nup to 11,000 m deep. 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS | 701\n\u201cGeneralized Topography of the Pacific Ocean Sea Floor\u201d by\nSteven Earle is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution\n4.0 International license.\nThe ocean floor is entirely underlain by mafic oceanic crust, while\nthe continental slopes are underlain by felsic continental crust\n(mostly granitic and sedimentary rocks). Moreover, the denser\noceanic crust floats lower on the mantle than continental crust\ndoes, and that is why oceans are oceans. Although the temperature\nof the ocean surface varies widely, from a few degrees either side of\nfreezing in polar regions to over 25\u00b0C in the tropics, in most parts\nof the ocean, the water temperature is around 10\u00b0C at 1,000 m\ndepth and about 4\u00b0C from 2,000 m depth to the bottom. (18.1 The\nTopography of the Sea Floor \u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.)\nThe deepest parts of the ocean are within the subduction trenches,\nand the deepest of these is the Marianas Trench in the southwestern\nPacific (near Guam) at 11,000 m. Other trenches in the\nsouthwestern Pacific are over 10,000 m deep; the Japan Trench is\nover 9,000 m deep, and the Puerto Rico and Chile-Peru Trenches\nare over 8,000 m deep. Shallow trenches tend to be that way\nbecause they have significant sediment infill. There is no\nrecognizable trench along the subduction zone of the Juan de Fuca 702 | 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS\nPlate because it has been filled with sediments from the Fraser and\nColumbia Rivers. (Earle, 2015)\nLandforms of Coastal Erosion\nLarge waves crashing onto a shore bring a tremendous amount of\nenergy that has a significant eroding effect, and several unique\nerosion features commonly form on rocky shores with strong\nwaves. When waves approach an irregular shore, they are slowed\ndown to varying degrees, depending on differences in the water\ndepth, and as they slow, they are bent or refracted. That energy is\nevenly spaced out in the deep water, but because of refraction, the\nwaves\u2019 energy, which moves perpendicular to the wave crests, is\nbeing focused on the headlands. On irregular coasts, the headlands\nreceive much more wave energy than the intervening bays, and thus\nthey are more strongly eroded. The result of this is coastal\nstraightening. An irregular coast, like the west coast of Vancouver\nIsland, will eventually become straightened, although that process\nwill take millions of years.\n\u201cCoastal Straightening\u201d by Steven Earle is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.\nWave erosion is highest in the surf zone, where the wave base is\nimpinging strongly on the seafloor and where the waves are\nbreaking. The result is that the substrate in the surf zone is typically\neroded to a flat surface known as a wave-cut platform, or wave-cut\nterrace. A wave-cut platform extends across the intertidal zone. 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS | 703\n(3.3 Crystallization of Magma \u2013 Physical Geology \u2013 2nd Edition,\nn.d.)\nResistant rock that does not get eroded entirely during the\nformation of a wave-cut platform will remain behind to form a\nstack. Here the different layers of the sedimentary rock have\ndifferent resistance to erosion. The upper part of this stack is made\nup of rock that resisted erosion, and that rock has protected a small\npedestal of underlying softer rock. The softer rock will eventually\nbe eroded, and the big rock will become just another boulder on the\nbeach.\n\u201cBasalt Sea Stack\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.\nArches and sea caves are related to stacks because they all form\nbecause of the erosion of non-resistant rock. (17.2 Landforms of\nCoastal Erosion | Physical Geology, n.d.) 704 | 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS\n\u201cAkun Island Basalt Sea Cave\u201d by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\nis licensed as Public Domain.\nSubmarine Canyons\nSubmarine canyons are narrow and deep canyons located in the\nmarine environment on continental shelves. They typically form at\nthe mouths of sizeable landward river systems, both by cutting\ndown into the continental shelf during low sea levels and by\ncontinual material slumping or flowing down from the mouth of\nthe river or a delta. Underwater currents rich in sediment pass\nthrough the canyons, erode them and drain onto the ocean floor.\nSteep delta faces and underwater flows of sediments are released\ndown the continental slope as underwater landslides, called\nturbidity flows. The erosive action of this type of flow continues to\ncut the canyon, and eventually, fan-shaped deposits develop on the\nocean floor beyond the continental slope. 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS | 705\nLandforms of Coastal\nDeposition\nSome coastal areas are dominated by erosion, an example being the\nPacific coast of Canada and the United States, while others are\ndominated by deposition, examples being the Atlantic and\nCaribbean coasts of the United States. However, on almost all\ncoasts, deposition and erosion are happening to vary degrees most\nof the time, although in various places. On deposition-dominant\ncoasts, the coastal sediments are still being eroded from some areas\nand deposited in others.\nThe main factor in determining if the coast is dominated by erosion\nor deposition is its history of tectonic activity. A coast like that of\nBritish Columbia is tectonically active, and compression and uplift\nhave been going on for tens of millions of years. This coast has also\nbeen uplifted during the past 15,000 years by isostatic rebound due\nto deglaciation. The coasts of the United States along the Atlantic\nand the Gulf of Mexico have not seen significant tectonic activity in\na few hundred million years, and except in the northeast, have not\nexperienced post-glacial uplift. These areas have relatively little\ntopographic relief, and there is now minimal erosion of coastal\nbedrock. (17.3 Landforms of Coastal Deposition \u2013 Physical\nGeology, n.d.)\nOn coasts dominated by depositional processes, most of the\nsediment being deposited typically comes from large rivers. An\nobvious example is where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf\nof Mexico at New Orleans; another is the Fraser River in\nVancouver. No large rivers bring sandy sediments to the west coast 706 | 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS\nof Vancouver Island, but there are still long and wide sandy beaches\nthere. In this area, most of the sand comes from glaciofluvial sand\ndeposits situated along the shore behind the beach, and some come\nfrom the erosion of the rocks on the headlands.\nOn a sandy marine beach, the beach face is the area between the low\nand high tide levels. A berm is a flatter region beyond the reach of\nhigh tides; this area stays dry except during large storms.\n\u201cWinter and Summer Beach Deposition\u201d by Steven Earle is\nlicensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational license.\nMost beaches go through a seasonal cycle because conditions\nchange from summer to winter. In summer, sea conditions are calm\nwith long-wavelength, low-amplitude waves generated by distant\nwinds. Winter conditions are rougher, with shorter-wavelength,\nhigher-amplitude waves caused by strong local winds. The heavy\nseas of winter gradually erode sand from beaches, moving it to an\nunderwater sandbar offshore. The gentler waves of summer 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS | 707\ngradually push this sand back toward the shore, creating a broader\nand flatter beach.\n\u201cGoose Spit at Comox on Vancouver Island\u201d by the U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service is licensed as Public Domain.\nThe evolution of sandy depositional features on seacoasts is\nprimarily influenced by waves and currents, especially longshore\ncurrents. As sediment is transported along a shore, either it is\ndeposited on beaches, or it creates other depositional features. For\nexample, a spit is an elongated sandy deposit that extends out into\nopen water in the direction of a longshore current. (3.4\nClassification of Igneous Rock \u2013 Physical Geology \u2013 2nd Edition,\nn.d.) 708 | 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS\n\u201cBaymouth Bar and Tombolo\u201d by Steven Earle is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.\nA spit that extends across a bay to the extent of closing, or almost\nclosing it off, is known as a baymouth bar. Most bays have streams\nflowing into them, and since this water must get out, rarely, a\nbaymouth bar will completely close the entrance to a bay. In areas\nwhere there is sufficient sediment being transported, and there are\nnearshore islands, a tombolo may form.\n\u201cFormation of a Tombolo\u201d by Steven Earle is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.\nTombolos are common where islands are abundant, and they\ntypically form where there is a wave shadow behind a nearshore 7.4 TOPOGRAPHY AND LANDFORMS | 709\nisland. This becomes an area with reduced energy, and so the\nlongshore current slows, and sediments accumulate. Eventually,\nenough sediments accumulate to connect the island to the\nmainland with a tombolo. (17.3 Landforms of Coastal Deposition\n\u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.)\nIn areas where coastal sediments are abundant and coastal relief is\nlow (because there has been little or no recent coastal uplift), it is\ncommon for barrier islands to form. Barrier islands are elongated\nislands composed of sand that form a few kilometers away from the\nmainland. They are common along the US Gulf Coast from Texas\nto Florida, and along the US Atlantic Coast from Florida to\nMassachusetts. North of Boston, the coast becomes rocky, partly\nbecause that area has been affected by a post-glacial crustal rebound.\nCoasts in tropical regions, between 30 degrees North and South, are\ncharacterized by carbonate reefs. Reefs form in relatively shallow\nmarine water within a few hundred to a few thousand meters of\nshore in areas where there is little or no input of clastic sediments\nfrom streams, and marine organisms such as corals, algae, and\nshelled organisms can thrive. The associated biological processes are\nenhanced where upwelling currents bring chemical nutrients from\ndeeper water, but not so deep that the water is cooler than about 25\ndegrees Celsius. Sediments that form in the back reef (shore side)\nand fore reef (ocean side) are typically dominated by carbonate\nfragments eroded from the reef and from organisms that thrive in\nthe back-reef area protected from wave energy by the reef. (17.3\nLandforms of Coastal Deposition \u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.) 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON\nTHE OCEANS\nSea-Level Change\nSea-level change has been a feature on Earth for billions of years,\nand it has important implications for coastal processes and both\nerosional and depositional features. There are three primary\nmechanisms of sea-level change, as described below.\n\u201cNASA Satellite Sea-Level Rise Observations\u201d by NASA is licensed\nas Public Domain.\nEustatic sea-level changes are global sea-level changes related to\nchanges in the volume of glacial ice on land or changes in the shape 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS | 711\nof the seafloor caused by plate tectonic processes. For example,\nchanges in the rate of mid-ocean spreading will change the\nseafloor\u2019s shape near the ridges, which affects sea level. (17.4 Sea-\nLevel Change \u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.)\nOver the past 20,000 years, there have been approximately 125\nmeters (410 feet) of eustatic sea-level rise due to glacial melting.\nMost of that took place between 15,000 and 7,500 years ago during\nthe significant melting phase of the North American and Eurasian\nIce Sheets. At around 7,500 years ago, the rate of glacial melting and\nsea-level rise decreased dramatically, and since that time, the average\nrate has been in the order of 0.7 mm\/year. Anthropogenic climate\nchange led to an accelerating sea-level rise starting around 1870.\nSince that time, the average rate has been 1.1 mm\/year, but it has\nbeen gradually increasing. Since 1992, the average rate has been 3.2\nmm\/year. (17.4 Sea-Level Change \u2013 Physical Geology, n.d.)\nIsostatic sea-level changes are local changes caused by subsidence\nor uplift of the crust related either to changes in the amount of ice\non the land or to growth or erosion of mountains. 712 | 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

This ranges from\nseveral hundred meters of rebound in the central part of the\nLaurentide Ice Sheet (around Hudson Bay) to 100 m to 200 m in\nthe peripheral parts of the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets \u2013\nin places such as Vancouver Island and the mainland coast of BC.\nAlthough the global sea level was about 130 m lower during the last\nglaciation, the glaciated regions were depressed at least that much in\nmost places, and more than that in places where the ice was thickest.\n(Webb, n.d.) 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS | 713\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=541\nTectonic sea-level changes are local changes caused by tectonic\nprocesses. The subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath\nBritish Columbia creates tectonic uplift (about 1 mm\/year) along\nthe western edge of Vancouver Island, although much of this uplift\nis likely to be reversed when the next sizeable subduction-zone\nearthquake strikes.\nEstuaries and fiords commonly characterize coastlines in areas\nwhere there has been a net sea-level rise in the geologically recent\npast. This valley was filled with ice during the last glaciation, and\nthere has been a net rise in sea level here since that time. Uplifted\nwave-cut platforms or stream valleys characterize coastlines in areas\nwhere there has been a net sea-level drop in the geologically recent 714 | 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS\npast. Uplifted beach lines are another product of relative sea-level\ndrop, although these are difficult to recognize in areas with vigorous\nvegetation.\nEmergent and Submergent\nCoasts\nCoastlines that have a relative fall in sea level, either caused by\ntectonics or sea-level change, are called emergent. Where the\nshoreline is rocky, with a sea cliff, waves refracting around\nheadlands attack the rocks behind the point of the headland.\nThey may cut out the rock at the base forming a sea arch that may\ncollapse to isolate the point as a stack. Rocks behind the stack may\nbe eroded, and sand eroded from the point collects behind it,\nforming a tombolo, a sand strip that connects the stack to the\nshoreline. Where sand supply is low, wave energy may erode a wave-\ncut platform across the surf zone, exposed as bare rock with tidal\npools at low tide. Wave energy expended at the base of a sea cliff\nmay cut a wave notch. 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS | 715\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=541\nSea cliffs tend to be persistent features as the waves cut away at their\nbase, and higher rocks calve off by mass wasting. If the coast is\nemergent, these erosional features may be elevated compared to the\nwave zone. Wave-cut platforms become marine terraces, with\nremnant sea cliffs inland from them.\nTectonic subsidence or sea-level rise produces a submergent coast.\nFeatures associated with submergence coasts include estuaries,\nbays, and river mouths flooded by the higher water. Fjords are\nancient glacial valleys now flooded by post-Ice Age sea level rise.\nElongated bodies of sand called barrier islands form parallel to the\nshoreline from the old beach sands, often isolated from the\nmainland by lagoons behind them. Some scientists hypothesize that 716 | 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS\nbarrier islands formed by rising sea levels as the ice sheets melted\nafter the last ice age. Accumulation of spits and far offshore bar\nformations are also mentioned as formation hypotheses for barrier\nislands.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=541\nTidal flats or mudflats form where tides alternately flood and\nexpose low areas along the coast. Combinations of symmetrical\nripple marks, asymmetrical ripple marks from tidal currents, and\nmud cracks from drying form on these tidal flats. An example of\nancient tidal flat deposits is exposed in the Precambrian strata\nfound in the central part of the Wasatch Mountains of Utah. These\nancient deposits provide an example of applying Hutton\u2019s\nUniformity Principle. The presence of features common on 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS | 717\nmodern tidal flats prompts the interpretation that these ancient\ndeposits were formed in a similar environment. There were\nshorelines, tides, and shoreline processes acting at that time, yet the\nancient rocks\u2019 age indicates that there were no land plants to hold\nproducts of mechanical weathering in place, so rates of erosion\nwould have been different. The Uniformity Principle must be\napplied with some knowledge of the context of the application.\nTypically, tidal flats are broken into three different sections, which\nmay be abundant or absent in each tidal flat. Barren zones are\nareas with strong, flowing water and coarser sediment, with ripples\nand cross-bedding typical. Marshes are vegetated with natural sand\nand mud. Salt pans are the finest-grained parts of the tidal flats,\nwith silty sediment, mud cracks, and are less often submerged.\nLagoons are locations where spits, barrier islands, or other features\nhave partially cut off a body of water from the ocean. Estuaries are\na (typically vegetated) type of lagoon where freshwater flows into\nthe area and makes the water brackish (between salt and\nfreshwater). However, terms like a lagoon, estuary, and even bay are\noften loosely used in place of one another. Lagoons and estuaries\nare transitional between terrestrial and marine geologic\nenvironments, where littoral, lacustrine, and fluvial processes can\noverlap. 718 | 7.5 HUMAN IMPACTS ON THE OCEANS\nCoral Reefs and Bleaching\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Sometimes these changes are effective\nand may appear to be beneficial, although in most cases, there are\nunintended negative consequences that we do not recognize until\nmuch later. (17.5 Human Interference with Shorelines | Physical\nGeology, n.d.)\nSeawalls help limit erosion and are enjoyable amenities for the\npublic, but they have geological and ecological costs. When a\nshoreline is \u201chardened\u201d in this way, crucial marine habitats are lost,\nand sediment production is reduced, which can affect beaches\nelsewhere. Seawalls also affect the behavior of waves and longshore\ncurrents, sometimes with negative results. 724 | 7.6 HUMAN INTERFERENCE WITH SHORELINES\n\u201cSeawall\u201d by Oikos-team is licensed as Public Domain.\nGroins have an effect similar to that of breakwaters, although\ngroins are constructed perpendicular to the beach, and they trap\nsediment by slowing the longshore current. Most of the sediment\nthat forms beaches along our coasts comes from rivers, so if we want\nto take care of the beaches, we have to take care of rivers. When a\nriver is dammed, its sediment load is deposited in the resulting\nreservoir, and for the century or two, while the reservoir is filling up,\nthat sediment cannot get to the sea. During that time, beaches\n(including spits, baymouth bars, and tombolos) within tens of\nkilometers of the river\u2019s mouth (or more in some cases) are at risk of\nerosion. 7.6 HUMAN INTERFERENCE WITH SHORELINES | 725\n\u201cGroins and Jetties\u201d by the National Park Service is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nCoasts are prime real estate land that attracts the development of\nbeach houses, condominiums, and hotels. This kind of interest and\ninvestment leads to ongoing efforts to manage the natural processes\nin coastal areas. Humans who find longshore drift is removing sand\nfrom their beaches often use groins in an attempt to retain it.\nSimilar but smaller than jetties, groins are bits of wood or concrete\nbuilt across the beach perpendicular to the shoreline at the\ndownstream end of one\u2019s property. Unlike jetties, they are used to\npreserve sand on a beach, rather than to divert it from an area. Sand\nerodes on the downstream side of the groin and collects against the\nupstream side. Every groin thus creates a need for another one\ndownstream. The series of groins along a beach develops a scalloped\nappearance for the shoreline. (12 Coastlines \u2013 An Introduction to\nGeology, n.d.) 726 | 7.6 HUMAN INTERFERENCE WITH SHORELINES\nSand for longshore drift and beaches comes from rivers flowing to\nthe oceans from inland areas. Beaches may become starved of sand\nif sediment carried by streams and rivers is trapped behind dams. To\nmitigate, beach replenishment may be employed where sand is\nhauled from other areas by trucks or barges and dumped on the\ndepleted beach. Unfortunately, this can disrupt the ecosystem that\nexists along the shoreline by exposing native creatures to foreign\nsandy material and foreign microorganisms and can even bring in\nforeign objects that impact humans on replenished beaches.\nVisitors to one replenished east coast beach found munitions and\nmetal shards in the sand which had been brought from abandoned\ntest ranges from which the sand had been dredged.\nAnother approach to reduce erosion or provide protected areas for\nboat anchoring is the construction of a breakwater, an offshore\nstructure against which the waves break, leaving calmer waters\nbehind it. Unfortunately, this means that waves can no longer reach\nthe beach to keep the longshore drift of sand moving. The drift is\ninterrupted, the sand is deposited in the quieter water, and the\nshoreline builds out, forming a tombolo behind the breakwater,\neventually covering the structure with sand. The image shows this\nresult at the breakwater constructed by the city of Venice,\nCalifornia, to create a quiet water harbor. The tombolo behind the\nbreakwater is now acting as a large groin in the beach drift. 7.7 ATTRIBUTIONS AND\nREFERENCES\nCreative Commons Attributions\nAn Introduction to Geology by Chris Johnson, Matthew D.\nAffolter, Paul Inkenbrandt, Cam Mosher is licensed under CC BY-\nNC-SA 4.0\nNatural Disasters and Human Impacts by R.

Its\ndiameter is about 865,000 miles or 109 Earths lined up side-by-side\nand is so large that it makes up 99.99 percent of the mass of our\nSolar System. According to astronomers, our sun is the most\ncommon type of star in the known universe and has existed for\nnearly 4.6 billion years.\nThe sun\u2019s composition is about 92 percent hydrogen (the lightest\nelement in the universe) and almost 8 percent helium (the second\nlightest element). Using these elements, the sun generates energy\nthrough a process called thermonuclear reaction. This energy is\ncreated when the sun fuses hydrogen atoms to make a heavier\nelement called helium. This process not only creates new elements\nbut also releases an enormous amount of energy. 738 | 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=618\nThe energy emitted by the sun is called electromagnetic energy, a\nrange of wavelengths from the shortwave to the longwave spectrum\nof light, which travels at the speed of light. Recall from the module\non tsunamis that a wavelength is the distance between two wave\ncrests, and frequency is the number of wavelengths that pass a given\npoint in a given amount of time. 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE | 739\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=618\nThe sun\u2019s life expectancy is already half over. In another 4 billion\nyears, it will consume all the hydrogen within it, leaving behind\nhelium and a few other newly created elements. When the hydrogen\nruns out, in about 5 billion years, the sun will grow into a red giant,\nexpanding its diameter well past Mercury and possibly Venus and\nEarth. The sun will continue to fuse helium into carbon until the\nstar begins to release its outer layers to form a planetary nebula.\nLeft behind will be the white-hot core of our star, called a white\ndwarf that will slowly fade out over billions of years. 740 | 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Would you rather walk barefoot on black\npavement or grass? The answers to these questions relate to the idea\nthat different objects absorb and reflect energy differently on the\nplanet. Darker objects tend to absorb more energy, while lighter\nobjects reflect less energy. The percent of energy an object reflects is\nan object\u2019s albedo. Because the planet has different albedos from\ncities, forests, deserts, oceans, rocks, glaciers, and more, the planet\nhas uneven heating. The result is that of all the energy the Earth\nreceives from the sun, only 51 percent is absorbed by the planet,\nwhile 49 percent is reflected into space. 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE | 741\natmosphere\nsun's rays\nlong\na\ndistance\nlarge\narea\nEarth\nsun's rays\nequator\nb short\ndistance\n\u201cObique Rays\u201d by Peter Halasz has licensed under Creative\nCommons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nUneven heating of the planet also occurs because of the curvature\nof the Earth. The planet receives most of its energy near the\nequator, where the sun\u2019s rays are directly hitting the planet.\nTowards the poles, the sun\u2019s energy becomes more diffused and\nspread out over a greater area. The equator receives more energy\nfrom the sun than it can radiate back into space, producing a\nsurplus of energy at 0 degrees latitude. At the poles, the planet\nradiates more energy out into space than it receives from the sun.\nThere is a deficit of energy in these regions. The ultimate purpose\nof weather is to transfer the surplus of energy and heat from the\nequator to the poles, bring colder air toward the equator and find\nequilibrium.\nllams aera 742 | 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE\nGlobal Transfer of Heat\nThe source of energy for the weather on Earth is the sun. The earth-\natmosphere energy balance is the balance of energy the earth\nabsorbs, and the energy reflected into space. Roughly 51 percent of\nthe energy the earth receives from the sun is absorbed, while\napproximately 49 percent of the sun\u2019s energy is reflected into space.\nTo balance the energy deficit at the earth\u2019s poles and the energy\nsurplus at the equator, the planet will transfer energy by\nconduction, convection, latent heat, and radiation.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=618 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE | 743\nConduction\nConduction is the transfer of heat from a warmer object to a colder\nobject through molecule interaction. As the sun heats the ground,\nenergy is transferred to the atmosphere by conduction. However,\nthe atmosphere is an inferior conductor of heat. In calm weather,\nthe heated ground only warms the first few centimeters of air. The\natmosphere\u2019s temperature can be up to 50 percent colder five feet\nabove the ground than at the surface. Since the atmosphere is such a\npoor conductor of heat, there must be other ways to transfer the\nenergy.\nConvection\nConvection is the transfer of heat by the mass movement of a fluid\n(such as water and air). It occurs mostly in liquids and gases because\nthey are free to move around. Heat is transferred upward and\noutward away from its heat source, and cooler air is brought in to\nreplace the rising air. On a local scale, convection in the summer can\nproduce afternoon thunderstorms. On a global scale, convection\ntransfers energy between the equator and poles. 744 | 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE\nPolar cell\n60\u00b0 N\nMid-latitude cell\nWesterlies\n30\u00b0 N HIGH\nHadley cell Northeasterly Trades\nIntertropical\nconvergence\nzone 0\u00b0\nHadley cell Southeasterly Trades\nHIGH\n30\u00b0 S\nWesterlies\nMid-latitude cell\n60\u00b0 S\nPolar cell\n\u201cEarth Global Circulation\u201d by NASA is licensed as Public Domain.\nRadiation\nThe final process of transferring heat around the planet is called\nradiation. The energy coming from the sun comes in various\nwavelengths. A wavelength is the distance measured along a wave\nof energy from one crest to another. The shorter the wavelength,\nthe higher the energy. The energy received from the sun passes\nthrough the atmosphere without warming it. All objects that\nabsorb radiation from the sun radiate some of that energy back into\nspace, but in a weaker form of energy. This weaker energy becomes\nlongwave radiation and is typically observed as heat. All living\nobjects (including humans) radiate longwave radiation. The Earth 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE | 745\nitself radiates the energy absorbed from the sun in the form of\nlongwave radiation, which is sometimes called Earthlight.\n\u201cEarth\u2019s Energy Budget\u201d by NASA is licensed as Public Domain.\nLatent Heat\nLatent heat is a powerful force in the weather. When water\ntransforms from gas to liquid or solid, or vice versa, it is called a\nphase change. The heat required to change phases is called latent\nheat. For water to change from a liquid to a gas, energy\/heat must\nbe taken from external sources such as the surrounding atmosphere.\nTherefore, evaporation is a cooling process because the water is\ntaking heat from the surrounding air to evaporate. 746 | 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE\n\u201cThe Water Cycle\u201d by the United States Geologic Survey is licensed\nas Public Domain.\nThe process of evaporation and condensation transfers substantial\namounts of heat around the planet. The heat released in a typical\nthunderstorm is equal to one of the original atomic bombs. The\nheat and energy within a hurricane are equal to thousands of\nnuclear weapons or could power the United States for over a year. 8.2 WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE | 747\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=618 8.3 CONTROLS OF\nWEATHER AND CLIMATE\nLatitude\nSeveral controlling factors determine global temperatures. The first\nand most significant is latitude. Because of the Earth\u2019s shape and\nthe sun\u2019s angle hitting the planet, temperatures are highest near the\nequator and decrease toward the poles. In fact, at the equator, more\nenergy is absorbed from the sun than is radiated back into space. At\nthe poles, more energy is radiated back into space than is absorbed\nby the sun. The purpose of weather and ocean currents is to balance\nout these two extremes.\n\u201cLarge World Physical Map\u201d is licensed as Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International. 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 749\nLand-Water Distribution\nThe next impact on temperature is the land-water distribution\non the planet. Places near the ocean tend to have milder climates\nyear-round versus regions surrounded by land. This is because the\nearth can heat up and cool down faster and with more significant\nfluctuation than the ocean. The reason is that sunlight must heat a\nlarger volume of area in the ocean because light can pass through\nwater. Water requires five times more energy to heat one degree\nCelsius than for landmasses, called specific heat. Thus, the region\u2019s\ntemperatures found near large bodies of water temperatures change\nslowly compared to land. Ocean currents are also vital controls in\ntransferring heat around the planet. In the Northern Hemisphere,\nocean currents rotate clockwise, bringing cold water from the\nNorth Pole toward the equator and warm water from the equator\ntoward the North Pole. The opposite occurs in the Southern\nHemisphere, where ocean currents rotate counterclockwise. 750 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\n\u201cTennessee Valley Beach\u201d by R. Adam Dastrup is licensed as\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\nElevation\nThe last control of temperature is elevation. On average,\natmospheric temperature decreases 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit per 1,000\nfeet rise in elevation. This is called the normal lapse rate or also\ncalled the temperature lapse rate. 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 751\n\u201cLake Blanch\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.\nMoisture and Humidity\nFor liquid water to evaporate, water molecules must absorb enough\nenergy to break bonds between each other. To do this, the liquid\nwater must absorb energy and heat from the surrounding\nenvironment. This release of energy is called latent heat. If the\nwater vapor absorbs enough energy, they will begin to vibrate fast\nenough to break their molecular bonds and become individual\nwater molecules or gas. Evaporation is a cooling process because it\ntakes heat from the surrounding environment. The concept of\nlatent heat is essential to understand and will be revisited later when\ncloud formation and severe weather are discussed. 752 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\n\u201cEvaporation\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution\n2.0 Generic license.\nThe opposite must occur for water vapor to condense into liquid\nwater. For fast vibrating water molecules to condense into liquid, it\nmust release latent heat to the surrounding environment. Releasing\nenergy allows the water molecules to slow down their vibration and\nattach to other water molecules to become liquid. However, one\nstep is missing. For water vapor to become liquid, it needs\nsomething to condense onto condensation nuclei. Condensation\nnuclei consist of microscopic dust, smoke, salt particles, or even\nbacteria that float in the air. It is believed that bacteria make up\nnearly half of all condensation nuclei. To summarize, for water\nvapor to condense into small liquid or ice cloud droplets,\ncondensation nuclei must be present. 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 753\n\u201cDew\u201d is by Piklist.\nHumidity is defined as the amount of water vapor in the\natmosphere. There are several ways to classify humidity, but we will\nfocus on relative humidity for this course. Relative humidity is\nthe ratio of the atmosphere\u2019s actual water vapor content divided by\nthe amount of water vapor required for atmospheric saturation at\nthat temperature; it is usually expressed as a percentage. If the\nrelative humidity is 25 percent, the atmosphere is only holding a\nquarter of what it could hold. If the relative humidity is at 100\npercent, the atmosphere is saturated.\nThere are two ways to change relative humidity: moisture content\nand temperature. If the air temperature stays the same, but the\namount of water vapor increases or decreases, relative humidity will\nchange. Next, it should first be noted that warm air can \u201chold\u201d\nmore moisture than cooler air. If the water content stays the same,\nbut temperature increases, relative humidity will decrease. If the 754 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\nwater content stays the same, but the temperature decreases, relative\nhumidity will increase.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=622\nRelative humidity is just as the name implies; it is a relative\nmeasurement. A more direct measurement and analysis of\nhumidity is dew point; the atmospheric temperature air must cool\ndown to in order for it to condense into liquid water or solid ice\ncrystals. So if the dew point is 42 degrees Fahrenheit for a particular\ngeographic location at a particular time, then the current\ntemperature must fall to 42 degrees for the air to become saturated.\nThe higher the dew point reading, the less air must cool to become\nsaturated and condense. The lower the dew point reading, the more\nair must cool to become saturated; thus, the air is quite dry. Dew 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 755\npoint analysis is vital for weather forecasting in the summer to\ndetermine the likelihood of afternoon thunderstorms. If the\nhumidity is high, providing a high dew point measurement, then\nafternoon convection does not require the unstable moisture to rise\nas high in order for condensation and thunderstorms genesis to\noccur. Recall that condensation from water vapor to liquid water or\nice crystals releases latent heat is a crucial ingredient for the\nformation of thunderstorms.\nAtmospheric Pressure and Wind\nAtmospheric pressure is a force created by the weight of the\natmosphere. Because of gravity, air pressure is highest at sea level\nand decreases with height. There is also high pressure and low\npressure. High pressure, also called an anticyclone, occurs when\ndescending air molecules \u201cpile-up\u201d at the surface and spread\noutward in a clockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere. In\nthe Southern Hemisphere, the air within high pressure flows\ncounterclockwise. In either case, the descending air will warm,\nwhich prevents water vapor from cooling and condensing into\nclouds to produce storms. Instead, regions under high pressure\ntend to experience clear skies. Low pressure, also called a cyclone,\noccurs when converging air is forced upward (in a counterclockwise\nmanner in the Northern Hemisphere) where it cools and condenses\ninto clouds and possible storms. Ultimately, air flows from high\npressure to low pressure, and this is called wind. 756 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=622\nWhen atmospheric high pressure is near atmospheric pressure,\nthere is an imbalance between the atmospheric pressure. The force\nto balance these two pressure imbalances is called the pressure\ngradient force, which creates wind. Wind is the horizontal\nmovement of air from high pressure to low pressure to balance\natmospheric pressure.\nAtmospheric Stability\nTo have cloud formation, the air must be unstable. Stable air\nmeans air does not want to rise, cool, and condense. Thus, weather 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 757\nconditions tend to be clear skies with stable air. Unstable air means\nthe air wants to rise, cool, and condense into clouds and potential\nstorms. The forces that cause air to rise are convection, orographic\nuplift, convergence, and weather fronts.\nConvection occurs when air rises, much like a hot air balloon.\nBecause of albedo, some areas on the ground can get heated more\nthan other areas. Where the land heats up more, the air above also\nwarms, becomes less dense, and rises. If the air rises high enough, it\nmay cool and condense to create clouds and possibly\nthunderstorms.\nOrographic uplift is when mountains help destabilize air and\noccur when air must rise over a mountain range. As the air rises over\nthe mountain, the moisture within it may begin to cool and\ncondense to form thunderstorms. Often with orographic uplift,\none side of the mountain will be very moist from the storms, while\nthe other side is arid. The dry side of the mountain is called the\nrainshadow effect. Later we will discuss how this process can\ngenerate what is called dry thunderstorms and wildfires.\n\u201cRainshadow Effect Caused by Orographic Uplift\u201d is licensed as\nPublic Domain. 758 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\n\u201cMountains and Clouds\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic license.\nConvergence occurs when air is forced to rise because of low\npressure above, causing the rising air to cool and condense into\nclouds. One of the best examples of this is over Florida. Because\nFlorida is a peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides, the land\nheats up more than the surrounding water. This causes the air\nabove the land to rise. To replace this rising air, humid and cooler\nair from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean converges\ninward over Florida. This moist air is heated by the land and is\nforced upward to create powerful thunderstorms. Florida has more\nthunderstorms and lightning than any other state in the nation.\nAnother excellent example of convergence is the eye of a hurricane\nbecause winds and moisture are rotating around the eye until they\nconverge within the eye. 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE | 759\n\u201cHurricane Lester on Approach to Hawaii\u201d by NASA\u2019s Earth\nObservatory is licensed as Public Domain.\nFinally, weather fronts, such as cold fronts, warm fronts,\nstationary fronts, and occluded fronts, can force air to rise. For\nexample, a cold front occurs when a cold, dense air mass replaces a\nwarm, lighter air mass. The cold air mass plows through, forcing the\nwarmer air mass upward to cool and condense into clouds.\nCoriolis Effect\nAll free moving objects appear to be deflected to the right in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere,\nbecause of the rotation of the Earth. This apparent deflection is\ncalled the Coriolis effect. 760 | 8.3 CONTROLS OF WEATHER AND CLIMATE\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Free moving objects include airplanes, ocean currents,\nclouds, wind, hurricanes, or anything else that is not attached to the\nearth\u2019s surface. So how does this influence the atmosphere? As\nwinds flow from high to low pressure, it deflects to the right (in the\nNorthern Hemisphere) because of the earth\u2019s rotation. This\ndeflection is nonexistent at the equator and progressively gets\nstronger towards the poles. Because of this, hurricanes can only\nform 5-20 degrees north or south of the equator. Near the equator,\nthe water is warm enough, but the Coriolis effect is too weak to\nmake the hurricane rotate. Beyond 20 degrees latitude, the Coriolis\neffect is strong enough, but the waters are too cold. 8.4 MOISTURE AND\nHUMIDITY\nComing soon\u2026\nTypes of Precipitation\nFor precipitation to occur, a variety of atmospheric conditions\nmust occur. This includes a moisture source along with high and\nlow pressure. Next, atmospheric instability needs to occur so that\ncloud formation may develop. Finally, moisture in the air needs to\ncondense onto condensation nuclei so that the condensed moisture\ncan become large enough to fall from the clouds in the form of\nprecipitation. The atmosphere can produce a variety of\nprecipitation types.\nRain is liquid water falling from nimbostratus or cumulonimbus\nclouds. Many times, in the midlatitudes, precipitation will fall from\nclouds in the form of ice or snow, which then melts on its way down\ntoward the ground. 762 | 8.4 MOISTURE AND HUMIDITY\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Then\nthe updrafts through the ice pellet back up above the freezing point\nhardening the newly gathered water. The ice pellet will fall again to\ncollect liquid water and thrown back up to refreeze. This process\nwill continue until the hailstone\u2019s weight becomes too heavy for the\nupdrafts to hold it up. Once the hail becomes too heavy, the hail will\nprecipitate from the cloud.

An air mass originates from the source region and\ndetermines the moisture and temperature characteristics of an air\nmass. For an air mass to develop, the surface of the source region\nmust be relatively flat and uniform in composition (i.e., oceans,\ndeserts, glaciers.), but not a combination. If the air mass stays long\nenough within the source region, it will begin to develop the\ncharacteristics of that source region. An air mass is classified by its\ntemperature and moisture and is identified by using a \u201cletter code\u201d\nsystem.

When two\nair masses come into contact with each other, they do not like to\nmix well because of their different densities (much like water and\noil.) Along a weather front, the warmer, less dense air rises over the\ncolder, denser air to form clouds. There are several types of weather\nfronts: stationary fronts, cold fronts, warm fronts, and occluded\nfronts.

In many ways, the two air masses are stuck or at a\nstalemate until one of them begins to give ground to the other.\nTypically, but not always, stationary fronts produce mild but\nprolonged precipitation.\nCold fronts are zones separating two distinct air masses, of which\nthe colder, denser mass is advancing and replacing the warmer. The\ncolder, denser air pushes under the warm air, forcing the warm,\nlighter air upward. If the warm air rising is unstable enough,\nmassive thunderstorms are likely to occur. Cumulous and\ncumulonimbus clouds are common. 790 | 9.1 AIR MASSES AND WEATHER FRONTS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

When a warm air mass advances over a\ncold air mass, the warm air rises over, but at a gentler rate than a\ncold front. Since the warm air does not rise as fast as a cold front,\nmore stratus clouds form, and precipitation is not as heavy. 9.1 AIR MASSES AND WEATHER FRONTS | 791\n\u201cWarm Front\u201d by Kelvin Ma is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.\nFinally, occluded fronts occur when a cold front overtakes a warm\nfront, causing the warmer air to rise above, and meets up with\nanother cold air mass. 792 | 9.1 AIR MASSES AND WEATHER FRONTS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

It all\nbegins along the polar front at 60-65 degrees north, where two very\ndifferent air masses with different densities meet. Clockwise\nrotation along with the polar high air mass (cold, dense air) and the\nsubtropical high air mass (warm, less dense air) causes air to flow\nparallel to each other along the polar front but in opposite\ndirections. Where these two different air masses meet is called a\nstationary front, and cyclogenesis (formating a mid-latitude\ncyclone) has begun. 794 | 9.2 MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES\n\u201cLow-Pressure Area Over the United States\u201d by NOAA is licensed\nas Public Domain.\nThe wind shear, caused by air that flows parallel but in the opposite\ndirection, creates a wave rotating counter-clockwise along the polar\nfront where warm subtropical air begins to migrate northward, and\ncold polar air migrates southward. In the center of this rotating\nwave, a low-pressure system develops, rotating counter-clockwise.\nThe advancing boundary of the cold polar air is a cold front, and\nthe boundary of the advancing warm sub-tropical air is a warm\nfront. 9.2 MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES | 795\n\u201cNorwegian Model Stages 1-3\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nBy stage three, the midlatitude cyclone has a defined warm front\nand cold front. The up-lifting of air begins to occur at this stage as\nthe warmer, lighter, and moister air mass is forced to rise over the\ncolder, denser, and drier air mass. A massive amount of latent heat\nis being released as water vapor condenses to form clouds. This\nrelease of heat strengthens the low pressure (pressure drops more),\nand the atmosphere becomes more unstable. In front of an\nadvancing warm front, the air would be cool, and stratus-type 796 | 9.2 MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES\nclouds would begin to develop. As the weather front approaches,\nthe stratus clouds would lower until nimbostratus clouds were\noverhead.\n\u201cNorwegian Model Stages 1-3\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nTypically with warm fronts, the precipitation is light but may last a\nfew days. Once the front passed, it would feel warmer. In front of\nan advancing cold front, it would be warm at first with warm,\nsouthern winds blowing. Cumulus-type clouds would also begin to\ndevelop and lower as the cold front approached. Once the cold\nfront is overhead, expect powerful cumulonimbus thunderstorms\nwith the possibility of lightning and thunder, hail, strong winds,\nand intense precipitation in the form of rain or snow. Once the cold 9.2 MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES | 797\nfront has passed by, expect colder temperatures and winds from the\nnorth or northwest.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=626\nAs the days move on, the cold front might begin to \u201ccatch up\u201d to\nthe warm front and an occluded front forms. During this stage, the\ncold front forces the rest of the warm air from the warm front into\nthe upper atmosphere. Now, before the front passes, the air is cool,\nand afterward, the air is cold. This is when the storm is most intense\npowerful, as the pressure drops further, and the winds are most\nintense (indicated by the isobars). However, this also marks the end\nof the midlatitude cyclone\u2019s life cycle. Once the warm air is forced\nupward, there is less latent heat and less energy released into the\nstorm. Remember that weather fronts mark the boundary between 798 | 9.2 MIDLATITUDE CYCLONES\ntwo high-pressure air masses. So once the midlatitude cyclone\nmoves off, high pressure tends to follow. The results are clear skies,\nlittle wind, and pressure rising. (Dastrup, 2014)\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Worldwide there are over 40,000 thunderstorms every day\nwith the United States alone having 100,000 thunder-storms yearly.\nThe essential ingredients for a thunderstorm are warm, moist,\nunstable air that is forced to rise either through convection,\nconvergence, orographic uplift, or weather fronts. The rising parcel\nof air condenses into various types of cumulus clouds. (Dastrup,\n2014) 800 | 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=630\nThunderstorm Genesis\nAll thunderstorms go through a three-stage lifecycle. The first stage\nis called the cumulus stage, where an air parcel is forced to rise,\ncool, and condense, called the lower condensation level, to\ndevelop into a cumulus cloud. The process of water vapor\ncondensing into liquid water releases large quantities of latent heat,\nwhich makes the air within the cloud warmer, and unstable causing\nthe cloud continues to grow upward like a hot air balloon. These\nrising air parcels, called updrafts, prevent precipitation from falling\nfrom the cloud. However, once the precipitation becomes too\nheavy for the updrafts to hold up, the moisture begins to fall, creat-\ning downdrafts within the cloud. The downdrafts also begin to pull\ncold, dry air from outside the cloud toward the ground in a process\ncalled entrainment. 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS | 801\n\u201cThunderstorm Formation\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nOnce the precipitation begins to fall from the cloud, the storm has\nreached the mature stage. During this stage, updrafts and\ndowndrafts exist side-by-side, and the cumulonimbus is called a\ncell. If the updrafts reach the top of the troposphere, the cumulus\ncloud will begin to spread outward, creating a defined anvil. At the\nsame time, the downdrafts spread within the cloud and at first\nmake the cloud more extensive, eventually overtaking the updrafts.\nCold downdrafts form when precipitation and the cold air from\nentrainment are dragged down to the lower regions of a\nthunderstorm. It is also during the mature stage when the storm is\nmost intense, producing strong, gusting winds, heavy precipitation,\nlightning, and possibly small hail.\nOnce the downdrafts overtake the updrafts, which prevents the\nrelease of latent heat energy, the thunderstorm will begin to weaken\ninto the third and final stage, called the dissipating stage. During\nthis stage, light precipitation and downdrafts become the dominate\nfeature within the cloud as it weakens. Only twenty percent of the 802 | 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS\nmoisture within the cloud fell as precipitation, whereas the other\neighty percent evaporates back into the atmosphere.

You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=630\nTypes of Thunderstorms\nAir Mass Thunderstorms\nThere is a variety of thunderstorms, all with defined characteristics.\nAir mass thunderstorms, sometimes called ordinary\nthunderstorms, go through the defined lifecycle sequence\nmentioned earlier. As the word implies, air mass thunderstorms 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS | 803\noccur when a warm, moist (mT) mass of air from a source region\nsuch as the Gulf of Mexico migrates over the land like the Great\nPlains. However, rather than a large-scale storm system forcing the\nmT air mass upward, localized uplift such as convection, sea-\nbreezes, or orographic uplift forces the moist air within the air mass\nupward.\nMost thunderstorms can also create other thunderstorms when\ndowndrafts within a thunderstorm slam the ground and spread\noutward in an arc-shape. These rippling waves are called, outflow\nboundaries or gust fronts, because the cold air from the\ndowndrafts acts like a mini-cold front. These mini-cold fronts can\nforce warm air upward to generate new thunderstorms with\ncumulus development. On average, ordinary thunderstorms last\nabout an hour. Ultimately, because of these outflow boundaries, an\narea may have several thunderstorms in various stages of\ndevelopment. These complex systems of thunderstorms can last\nseveral hours and are usually called multi-cell thunderstorms.\nSevere Thunderstorms\nThe Storm Prediction Center classifies a severe thunderstorm as\nhaving winds that exceed 58 miles per hour or produces hail with a\ndiameter of 1.9 centimeters. Of the 100,000 thunderstorms that\ndevelop within the United States\u2019 experiences every year, about ten\npercent (10,000 storms) become severe thunderstorms. These can\ninclude air mass thunderstorms, squall lines, dryline\nthunderstorms, and supercells. 804 | 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS\n\u201cSquall Line\u201d by Piklist is licensed as Public Domain.\nSevere thunderstorms go through the same stages as air-mass\nthunderstorms, but with one significant difference; severe\nthunderstorms last much longer in the mature stage. Ordinary\nthunderstorms do not last much longer than an hour because the\ndowndrafts begin to cut off the updrafts. However, severe\nthunderstorms have vertical wind shear at different levels that keep\nthe storm in the mature stage longer. This occurs when fast upper-\nlevel winds, such as the jet stream, causes the updrafts to pull away\nfrom the downdrafts. This prevents the downdrafts from cutting\noff the updrafts. Severe thunderstorms are capable of producing\nbeautiful mammatus clouds, torrential downpours, flash flooding,\nlarge hail, lightning, and straight-line winds.\nSquall lines are thunderstorms that develop linearly over hundreds\nof miles along the leading edge of outflow boundaries and are called\ngust fronts. Though these large storm systems are quite powerful, 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS | 805\nthey do not tend to produce tornadoes. Rather, straight-line winds\nand precipitation form because of the powerful, horizontal\nmovement of the gust front.\n\u201cSquall Line\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as Public Domain.\nA squall line can also form along a boundary called a dryline.\nRecall from the section on mid-latitude cyclones, that the warm air\nin front of the cold front is usually an mT air mass. Sometimes a\ndry, warm cT air mass can penetrate the mT air mass and cP air\nmass. Drier air is denser than moist air, so when it infiltrates a storm\nsystem, it can cause the mT air mass to rise much like a cold front\nwithout the cold. The hallmark of a dryline is that the moisture\nwithin the air dramatically drops following the boundary. Drylines\ncan produce severe thunderstorms that are often more powerful\nthan the cold front behind it. 806 | 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS\n\u201cTornado Alley Diagram\u201d by Dan Craggs is licensed under the\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nSupercells\nThe most powerful thunderstorm is a supercell, which is oddly\nenough for a single-cell thunderstorm on steroids. The United\nStates alone has anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 super-cells a year.\nSupercells consist of a single powerful thunderstorm that can last\nseveral hours and grow to a height of 65,000 feet and last several\nhours in the mature stage with winds reaching over 100 mph and\nform the majority of all tornadoes. 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS | 807\nstructure supercell\nof a\nAnvil\nOvershoot\nAnvil Updraft\nbackshear\nRear flank Storm movement\ndowndraft Virga\nFlanking Forward flank\nline downdraft\nShelf cloud\nPrecipitation-free\nbase Rain curtain Hail\nWall cloud Tornado Heavy rain Light rain\n\u201cSupercell\u201d is licensed under the Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nLike severe thunderstorms, supercells may have upper-level winds\nthat can pull the up-drafts away from the downdrafts. Wind shear\nbetween the upper-level, mid-level, and surface winds can also cause\nthe air beneath a forming supercell to rotate. For example, if there\nare upper-level and mid-level winds flowing from the northwest and\nlow-level, warm southern surface winds converging together, a\ncorkscrew flow of air could develop. This rotating column of air is\nthen picked up by the thunderstorm\u2019s updrafts, causing the entire\nstorm to rotate vertically, called a mesocyclone. Sometimes, the\nrotating portion of the supercell, the mesocyclone, can extend\nbelow the thunderstorm base, creating a cloud feature called a wall\ncloud. 808 | 9.3 THUNDERSTORMS\n\u201cIdealized Supercell\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as Public\nDomain. 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nTornadoes\nOne of the most violent and destructive forces of weather are\ntornadoes.

They\nrange in size from 300 feet to over two miles wide, last minutes to\nhours, travel a few miles to over 250 miles, at speeds of 30-65 mph.\nAbout 75 percent of all the tornadoes in the world occur in the\nUnited States; the United States has more tornadoes than the rest of\nthe world combined.\nWhat makes tornadoes so destructive are the wind speeds within\nthem. Atmospheric pressure within a tornado can be 10 percent\nlower than the tornado\u2019s air, causing air to flow into the tornado\nfrom all directions. As the air flows into a tornado, the moisture\nbegins to cool and condense into a cloud, allowing it to be seen.\nDebris picked up by the tornado will also cause it to darken.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Geography also plays a\ncrucial role in determining where tornadoes can and can not form.\nThe majority of thunderstorms in the United States form in the\nMidwest, called Tornado Alley. This region is where cP air masses\nfrom Canada collide with mT air from the Gulf of Mexico. This\nwind shear creates unstable atmospheric conditions and a rotating\ncorkscrew column of air.\n\u201cTypes of Atmospheric Wind Shear\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is\nlicensed as Public Domain. 812 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\n\u201cTornado Alley Diagram\u201d by Dan Craggs is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0\nUnported license.\nAs the ground heats up through the day, updrafts pick up the\nrotating air into a portion of the thunderstorm to developing what\nis called a rotating mesocyclone. The updrafts stretch and tighten\nthe now vertical column of air, causing it to rotate faster, much like\nan ice skater tightens to spin faster. As the rotating updrafts rise, a\nrotating wall cloud begins to form from the base of a mesocyclone.\nSometimes a funnel cloud may begin to descend from the\nmesocyclone and may even be called a tornado if it reaches the\nground. 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS | 813\n\u201cTornadic Supercell\u201d by the NOAA National Severe Storm\nLaboratory is licensed as Public Domain. 814 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The Storm Prediction Center\nstates that the Fujita Intensity Scale\u2019s goal was to \u201ccategorize each\ntornado by its intensity and its area and estimate a wind speed\nassociated with the damage caused by the tornado.\u201d The scale\nranged from weak F0s to rare and obliterating F5s.\n\u201cEnhanced Fujita Scale Damage and Windspeed Estimates\u201d by the\nAir Force Medical Service is licensed as Public Domain.\nIn February 2007, a new classification system began called the\nEnhanced Fujita Scale, or the EF-scale. The scale still ranges from\n0-5 and is still an estimate of the tornado\u2019s wind speeds. However,\nthe new scale is based on the amount of damage to different\nstructures instead of actual wind speed. The stronger focus on the 816 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nactual damage caused is because some structures and objects are\nbuilt stronger than others.

Sometimes a tornado will pass through a\nneighborhood and destroy some houses while leaving others with\nlittle damage. Scientists have discovered that some massive, intense\ntornadoes might contain several smaller tornadoes within them\ncalled suction vortices that makeup what is called multiple vortex\ntornadoes.

The buildup\noccurs when charged atmospheric particles become segregated\nbetween a cloud and the ground, between clouds, or from a cloud\nand surrounding atmosphere. Scientists do not fully understand\nthe reason for charged particle separation. However, some believe\nthat ice crystals called graupel and supercooled raindrops interact\nwith each other through collision, creating positive and negative\ncharges that get separated within the cloud by updrafts and\ndowndrafts. Others believe that ice pellet formation within the\ncloud charges the particles. As an ice pellet forms, the outer shell\nfreezes first and becomes positively charged, and the liquid inner\ncore is negatively charged. As the interior begins to freeze and\nexpand, it breaks apart the positively charged outer layers. These\npositively charged fragments are taken into the cloud\u2019s upper\nregions, giving the top of the cloud a positive charge. The denser\nliquid water has a negative charge and is at the base of the cloud. 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS | 821\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=632\nOnce charged particles are separated, an electrical attraction exists\nbetween the negative and positive charges. The air between the\noppositely charged particles tries to keep them separated. However,\nwhen the air can not keep the two opposite charges separated any\nlonger, the negative charges move towards the positive charge in a\nzigzag manner called a stepped leader. As the stepped leader\napproaches the ground, the surface\u2019s positive charges will rise\ntoward the steeped leader. It may rise through trees, buildings, or\nhumans. When the steeped leader and the rising positively charged\nparticles connect, the negatively charged particles flow from the\ncloud to the ground. At the same time, an electrical discharge called\na return stroke, flows from the ground toward the cloud along the 822 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nsame path as the stepped leader. The return stroke is the part we see\nas lightning. When lightning flickers, it is because this process is\nrepeating itself along the same path. Eighty percent of all lightning\nstrikes occur cloud-to-cloud, but this process mentioned above can\noccur with cloud-to-ground, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-air.\n\u201cLightning Stages\u201d by NOAA Jetstream is licensed as Public\nDomain.\nLightning is only a few centimeters thick but travels at 60,000 mph\nwith a temperature of 54,000 degrees F (five times hotter than the\nsurface of the sun). Lightning causes the surrounding air to become\nsuperheated, causing the air to expand violently, creating a\nshockwave called thunder. To estimate how far you are from\nlightning, count the number of seconds between the flash of\nlightning and when you hear the thunder reach you, then divide by\nfive. However, if the lightning strike is more than 12 miles away,\nthunder will not be heard. 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS | 823\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

Dry thunderstorms typically mean storms that\nhave lightning, but little to no precipitation falling. Often this\noccurs when thunderstorms develop in dry atmospheric conditions.\nBecause the air is so dry, rising eddies of moisture must reach great\nheights before being able to condense. This creates thunderstorms\nwith very high cloud-bases. Any precipitation that does fall in these\ndry atmospheric conditions is likely to evaporate before reaching\nthe ground. Thus these thunderstorms can create lighting, which\ncan cause ignite wildfires, and the evaporating precipitation can\nproduce strong, dry winds that can \u201cpush\u201d the fires around. 824 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

When an\nice pellet falls within the cumulonimbus cloud, it enters the warm,\nliquid region and picks up moisture. Then the updrafts through\nthe ice pellet back up above the freezing point hardening the newly\ngathered water. The ice pellet will fall again to collect liquid water\nand thrown back up to refreeze. This process will continue until the\nhailstone\u2019s weight becomes too heavy for the updrafts to hold it up. 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS | 825\nOnce the hail becomes too heavy, the hail will precipitate on the\ndowndraft side of the cumulonimbus.

The National Weather Service states that\n\u201cflash floods are short-term events, occurring within 6 hours of the\ncausative event (heavy rain, dam break, levee failure, rapid,\nsnowmelt and ice jams) and often within 2 hours of the start of\nhigh-intensity rainfall. A flash flood is characterized by a rapid 826 | 9.4 WEATHER HAZARDS\nstream rise with depths of water that can reach well above the creek\nbanks. Flash flood damage and most fatalities tend to occur in areas\nimmediately adjacent to a stream or arroyo. Additionally, heavy rain\nfalling on steep terrain can weaken the soil and cause mudslides,\ndamaging homes, roads, and property.\u201d Urbanized areas are\nsusceptible to flash floods because soil and vegetation are removed\nand replaced by concrete, roads, and buildings.

Sometimes the moisture within\ndowndrafts falling from the thunderstorm evaporates as it enters\ndryer air below the cloud. As the moisture evaporates, the air cools\nbecause of latent heat, causing the air to become denser. This, in\nturn, causes the air to fall faster. As this denser air hits the ground, it\nspreads out laterally, producing cold winds reaching 100 miles per\nhour. Microbursts can uproot trees, damage property, and are very\ndangerous for airplanes taking off or landing.\n\u201cMicroburst Cross-Section\u201d by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration is licensed under Public Domain.\nWinds, crosswinds, and microbursts are all significant concerns for\naviation pilots, especially when are traveling over 200 mph and are\nonly 100-500 feet from the ground below.

Tropical cyclones go by different\nnames depending on their geographic location. In North and\nCentral America, they are called hurricanes. In the northwestern\nportion of the Pacific Ocean near China and Japan, they are called\ntyphoons. Furthermore, in the Indian Ocean and Australia, they\nare named cyclones. They all have winds exceeding 74 mph, can be\nhundreds of miles wide, and tower over 40,000 feet above sea level.\n(Dastrup, 2014) 9.5 HURRICANES | 831\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=635\nAnatomy of a Hurricane\nThe anatomy of a hurricane is relatively simple, though the\nprocesses involved are quite complex. As a low-pressure disturbance\nforms, the warm, moist air rushes towards the low pressure to rise\nupward to form towering thunderstorms. Around the low pressure,\ndisturbance in a wall of clouds called an eyewall. Within the\neyewall, the wind speeds are highest, the clouds are the tallest,\natmospheric pressure is at its lowest, and precipitation is most\nintense. 832 | 9.5 HURRICANES\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=635\nAt the center or heart of the hurricane is called the eye. Within the\neye of a hurricane, winds are light, precipitation is minimal, and the\nskies above are occasionally clear. It is the calm region of the\ntropical storm, but that is what makes it so dangerous. Many people\ntend to go outside as the eye moves overhead because they believe\nthe storm is over. However, what some do not realize is that \u201cround\ntwo\u201d is coming from behind. Moving away from the eyewall are\norganized, intense thunderstorms, called spiral rain bands, that\nrotate around and toward the storm\u2019s eyewall. (Dastrup, 2014) 9.5 HURRICANES | 833\n\u201cDiagram of a Northern Hemisphere Hurricane\u201d is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license.\nDevelopment of a Hurricane\nThere are several requirements needed for a hurricane to form.\nFirst, hurricanes must form over warm, moist oceans with surface\ntemperatures that are at least 80 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 150\nfeet deep. This allows for water to evaporate, causing the air to\nbecome warm and humid. The atmosphere must also be warm and\nhumid so that latent heat energy could be released as the moisture\ncondenses within a hurricane. The third ingredient is a low-pressure\ndisturbance, called an easterly wave or tropical wave, which is\nneeded for air to converge toward and ascend to produce powerful\nthunderstorms.\nOnce these storms form, most need to be 5-20 degrees north or\nsouth of the equator to develop into a hurricane. If the tropical\nstorm forms between 0-5 degrees north or south, the Coriolis effect\nis not strong enough to cause the storm to organize into a system\nand rotate. If the storm forms too far north or south, the water is 834 | 9.5 HURRICANES\ntoo cold to develop into a hurricane. Finally, in order for a\nhurricane to form in the Atlantic Ocean, there must be little to no\nwind shear. If the jet stream is too low and blowing eastward while\nthe trade winds are blowing west-ward, the wind shear will tear\napart the forming cyclone before it can strengthen into a hurricane.\nMost hurricanes form under large regions of high pressure within\nthe Atlantic Ocean. Recall that high pressure tends to have clear\nskies and mild winds.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=635\nNow there are five primary stages a hurricane goes through. The\nfirst stage goes back to the low-pressure disturbance or easterly\nwave. Where easterly waves develop is currently being debated.\nHowever, it is believed that they form either off the west coast of 9.5 HURRICANES | 835\nAfrica near the Canary Islands or eastern Africa near Ethiopia. At\nthis stage, warm, moist air begins to rise within the low-pressure\ndisturbance releasing vast amounts of latent heat because of\ncondensation, causing the storm to intensify. If the easterly\nwaveforms under the right conditions, the Coriolis effect may allow\nthe thunderstorms to organize and rotate, and it becomes a tropical\ndepression. If the tropical storm continues to organize and\nstrengthen with sustained winds between 39-73 mph, the storm is\nupgraded to a tropical storm and given a name by the National\nHurricane Center. If intense rotation continues, the storm grows\nwith winds reaching 74 mph or higher, it becomes a hurricane.\nThere are a variety of reasons why a hurricane will begin to die off.\nFirst, it could move in-to colder water, which does not supply the\nstorm with as much latent heat energy. The idea is that colder water\ncan not evaporate as easily, so no latent heat is released. Another\nway is if the storm moves over the land, causing it to lose its\nmoisture source below. Finally, a third way a tropical storm could\ndie-off is to move into an area where winds aloft begin to tear the\nstorm apart. 836 | 9.5 HURRICANES\n\u201cGlobal Tropical Cyclone Tracks\u201d by NASA is licensed as Public\nDomain.\nAn atmospheric event that can limit hurricane development occurs\nin the Pacific Ocean called El Nino. During an El Nino, the jet\nstream over the eastern United States migrates into lower latitudes.\nThis upper wind shear caused by the jet stream moving eastward\nand the trade winds moving westward tends to tear apart hurricanes\nbefore they can form.\nAnother phenomenon that can deduce or eliminate hurricane\ndevelopment is dust storms coming off the coast of the Sahara\nDesert and into the Atlantic Ocean. In the summer of 2006,\nfollowing the record activity of 2005 with Hurricane Katrina, the\nSahara Desert in Africa had several sandstorms coming off into the\nAtlantic Ocean. Now recall two things: hurricanes originate near\nAfrica, and the Atlantic Ocean must be over 80 degrees Fahrenheit\nfor them to form. It is believed that the sandstorms blocked the sun\nover the eastern Atlan-tic, which ultimately cooled the ocean\nenough to hinder hurricane genesis. (Dastrup, 2014) 9.5 HURRICANES | 837\nHurricane Classification and\nNaming\nThe Saffir-Simpson Scale was created to determine the strength\nand intensity of hurricanes. Just like the Fujita scale, it ranges from\n1-5, with category five being the strongest. The intensity of a\nhurricane increases as the atmospheric pressure near the eye\ndecreases and the pressure-gradient force becomes steeper\n(atmospheric pressure decreases rapidly towards the eye), causing\nthe winds to intensify, resulting in the potential for more damage.\n(Dastrup, 2014) 838 | 9.5 HURRICANES\n\u201cHurricane Strength Scale\u201d by Thomas Cizauskas is licensed as\nPublic Domain.\nFor many years, hurricanes were named based on where they struck\nland. For example, the Galveston Hurricane hit Galveston, Texas in\n1900. In the early 1900s, scientists started naming hurricanes using\nfemale names; clearly a sexist action by mostly white, male scientists\nat the time. But by the 1950s, the National Hurricane Center\nstarted naming hurricanes alphabetically, starting with the letter A,\nand based on male and female names. If the first year started the 9.5 HURRICANES | 839\nletter A with a female name, the following year, the first name\nwould be male. The names are also determined six years in advance\nso that politics do not get involved with the naming of these deadly\nstorms.\nHazards\nStorm Surge\nStorm surges, defined as rising ocean levels along a coastal area\nbecause of low atmospheric pressure within a tropical cyclone, are\nthe most dangerous hazard created by a tropical cyclone. They are\nblamed for 90 percent of all deaths and property damage. The\nheight of a storm surge is dependent on the strength of winds,\nwhich is dependent on the low pressure near the eye. The low\npressure does not \u201cpull up\u201d ocean water to create a storm surge;\ninstead, the wind blowing towards the low pressure causes the\nwater underneath to pile up near the hurricane\u2019s eye. 840 | 9.5 HURRICANES\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=635\nAs it approaches the shore, the piling causes the sea level to rise and\nflood the area near the eye and eyewall. Storm surges are most\ndamaging when the atmospheric pressure decrease, if the\ncontinental shelf rises slowly as it approaches the shore, or if the\nstorm surge arrives during high tide. The storm surge is also highest\non the right side of the eye as winds blow to-ward shore in a\ncounter-clockwise rotation. New Orleans was struck on the left side\nof the storm surge, so they did not receive the highest portion of the\nsurge. (Dastrup, 2014) 9.5 HURRICANES | 841\nWind Damage and Inland Flooding\nAnother hazard created by hurricanes is property damage caused by\nhurricane-force winds. Though property, such as mobile homes, is\nobvious, tall buildings are also susceptible to wind damage. People\nin tall buildings should get below the tenth floor because of\npowerful winds but should stay above the main floor in case of\nflooding. Hurricanes also produce tornadoes. It is believed that\nhurricanes Charley, Frances, Gaston, and Ivan that struck Florida in\n2004 produced nearly 300 tornadoes!\nFlooding, besides storm surges, is also a dangerous component of\nhurricanes. The 2004 hurricane season killed over 3,000. The\nmajority of the deaths occurred in Haiti from flash floods and\nmudslides caused by heavy precipitation. Category 5 Hurricane\nMitch in 1998 killed over 18,000 people, most in Central America,\ndropping nearly three feet of rain, causing massive flooding and\nmudslides.\nClick on the story map below to learn more about tropical cyclones\nin the United States. 842 | 9.5 HURRICANES\n\u201cTropical Cyclone Wind Exposure in the United States\u201d by NOAA is\nlicensed as Public Domain.\nHurricane Forecasting\nThe governmental agency that analyzes and monitors hurricanes is\nNOAA\u2019s National Hurricane Center. Most hurricanes move\nwestward as they approach North and Central America, then veer\nnortheast. The reason is relatively simple. At around 30 degrees\nnorth, there is a sub-tropical high called the Bermuda High. As\ntropical storm systems move across the Atlantic Ocean, they are\npushed westward from the underside of the subtropical high\u2019s\nclockwise rotation (a.k.a. the trade winds). As tropical storms move\nnorthward, the subtropical high\u2019s clockwise rotation (a.k.a. the\nwesterly winds) pushes the storms northwestward into colder water.\n(Dastrup, 2014)\nClick here to read about how the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) prepares for hurricanes\nseason. 9.6 ATTRIBUTIONS AND\nREFERENCES\nCreative Commons Attribution\nAn Introduction to Geology by Chris Johnson, Matthew D.\nAffolter, Paul Inkenbrandt, Cam Mosher is licensed under CC BY-\nNC-SA 4.0\nNatural Disasters and Human Impacts by R.

Climate is a statistical average of weather\nfor a specific location, over 30 years or more. Weather can change at\nany minute, but climate takes years, if not decades, to change. Like\nthe weather, the climate is a complex system involving the oceans,\natmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. (What is the\nDifference Between Climate and Weather? | NOAA Climate.Gov,\nn.d.) 10.1 CLIMATE SYSTEMS | 855\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=740\nMillions of years ago, during the early part of the Cretaceous\nperiod, dinosaurs roamed the Earth when temperatures were much\nwarmer than today. Geological evidence suggests that there were no\nice caps at the North or South poles. Earth\u2019s historic climates were\nclosely tied to changes in greenhouse gases, which make up the\ngreenhouse effect. Scientists have determined that changes in\ngreenhouse gas concentrations currently are due to human activity,\nrather than other national processes.\nHumans are causing climate change through their everyday actions,\nand the socioeconomic forces underlying those actions. At the same\ntime, people are feeling the consequences of climate change\nthrough various impacts on things they value and the responses\nthey make to address climate change. (Dastrup et al., 2019)\nAll around the world, tens of thousands of weather stations are\ncontinuously monitoring weather conditions for their location on\nthe planet. (How Do Weather Observations Become Climate\nData? | NOAA Climate.Gov, n.d.) The raw weather data is\ncollected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) at their National Center for\nEnvironmental Information (NCEI).\nOver time, this data can be overaged over the years and decades to 856 | 10.1 CLIMATE SYSTEMS\ndetermine what the climate is typically there. Climate norms are\ndetermined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) at the beginning of every new decade.\n(Climate Normals | National Centers for Environmental\nInformation (NCEI) formerly known as the National Climatic\nData Center (NCDC), n.d.) Climate data is critically important for\ndecision making for a variety of sectors of the economy and across\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations.\nThe Climate System\nThe climate system is comprised of five natural components:\natmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and biosphere.\nThe atmosphere is the envelope of gases that surrounds Earth,\nincluding the naturally occurring greenhouse gases that warm the\nplanet\u2019s surface. The hydrosphere includes all of Earth\u2019s liquid\nwater and gaseous water (water vapor), whereas the cryosphere\nincludes all frozen water (ice). Note that the cryosphere is\ntechnically part of the hydrosphere, but climate scientists usually\ntreat it as a separate component of the climate system because its\nphysical properties differ from those of water and water vapor.\nThe land surface does not include water- or ice-covered surfaces\nbut consists of all other vegetated and non-vegetated surfaces.\nThe biosphere is the realm of life and is found in all other natural\ncomponents, especially the hydrosphere and land surface. The biota\nis made up of and requires the presence of air, water, and mineral\nmatter \u2013 that is, material from the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and\nland \u2013 to exist. Several external forces influence the five climate\nsystem components, with radiation from the Sun being most 10.1 CLIMATE SYSTEMS | 857\nimportant. Climate scientists consider the impact of human\nactivities on the climate system another example of external forcing.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=740\nWhy Understanding Climate is\nImportant\nEverything in the lighter shading would be flooded in the transition\nfrom the ice age to the modern pre-industrial climate. However,\nwhat sort of effort would that have taken? It turns out that the\nnatural increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that led to the thaw\nafter the last Ice Age was an increase from 180 parts per million 858 | 10.1 CLIMATE SYSTEMS\n(ppm) to about 280 ppm. This was a smaller increase than the\npresent-time increase due to human activities, such as fossil fuel\nburning, which thus far have raised carbon dioxide levels from the\npre-industrial value of 280 ppm to a current level of over 400\nppm\u2013a level which is increasing by 2 ppm every year. So, arguably,\nif the dawn of industrialization had occurred 18,000 years ago, we\nmay very likely have sent the climate from an ice age into the\nmodern pre-industrial state.\nHow long it would have taken to melt all of the ice is not precisely\nknown, but it is conceivable it could have happened over a period as\nshort as two centuries. The area ultimately flooded would be\nconsiderably more significant than that currently projected to flood\ndue to the human-caused elevation of carbon dioxide that has taken\nplace so far. The hypothetical city of \u201cOld Orleans\u201d would have to\nbe relocated from its position in the Gulf of Mexico 100+ miles off\nthe coast of New Orleans to the current \u201cNew Orleans\u201d location.\nBy some measures, human interference with the climate back then,\nhad it been possible, would have been even more disruptive than\nthe current interference with our climate. Nevertheless, that\ninterference would merely be raising global mean temperatures\nfrom those of the last Ice Age to those that prevailed in modern\ntimes before industrialization. This thought experiment tells us that\nthe issue is not whether some particular climate is objectively\n\u201coptimal.\u201d The issue is that human civilization, natural ecosystems,\nand our environment are heavily adapted to a particular climate \u2013\nin our case, the current climate. Rapid departures from that climate\nwould likely exceed the adaptive capacity that we and other living 10.1 CLIMATE SYSTEMS | 859\nthings possess, and cause significant consequent disruption in our\nworld. 10.2 CONTROLS OF\nCLIMATE\nEarth\u2019s climate is composed of a complex system and interaction of\nother natural processes. To understand the current climate crisis, it\nis essential to understand the variables, controls, and systems that\ndirectly or indirectly affect it. (How Do Scientists Classify Different\nTypes of Climate? | NOAA Climate.Gov, n.d.)\nLatitude\nThe dominant control influencing the climate of a region is latitude\nbecause different latitudes receive different amounts of solar\nradiation. Depending on where the planet is on its revolution\naround the sun, the region between 23.5 degrees north and south\nreceives the most solar radiation. The image below is during the\nequinox when the Sun\u2019s direct rays are striking at the equator. 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 861\natmosphere\nsun's rays\nlong\na\ndistance\nlarge\narea\nEarth\nsun's rays\nequator\nb short\ndistance\n\u201cOblique Rays\u201d by Peter Halasz is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 Generic license.\nThe polar regions receive the least solar radiation because of the\ncurvature of the Earth. The night lasts six months during the\nwinter. Even in summer, the sun never rises high in the sky.\nSunlight filters through a thick wedge of atmosphere, making the\nsunlight much less intense. The high albedo, because of ice and\nsnow, reflects a good portion of the sun\u2019s light. (Climate Systems\nand Change | Earth Science, n.d.)\nSolar Energy Budget\nThe Earth\u2019s climate is a solar-powered system. So to truly\nunderstand Earth\u2019s climate, an understanding of the\nllams aera 862 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nplanet\u2019s energy balance is essential. Consider the image below\nfrom NASA on how incoming (yellow) and outcoming (red)\nenergy sources of shortwave and longwave radiation achieve a net\nbalance:\n\u2022 At the surface\n\u2022 Within the atmosphere\n\u2022 At the top of the atmosphere\n\u201cEarth\u2019s Energy Budget\u201d by NASA is licensed as Public Domain.\nNext, let us note that the above image represents average climate\nconditions that averaged over the entire Earth\u2019s surface, and\naveraged over time. However, in reality, the incoming distribution\nof radiation varies in both space and time. 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 863\nThe dominant spatial variation occurs with latitude. There is more\nincoming solar radiation arriving at the surface near the equator\nthan near the poles. On average, roughly 30 percent of this incident\nradiation is reflected out to space by clouds and reflective surfaces of\nthe Earth, such as ice and desert sand, leaving roughly 70 percent of\nthe incoming solar radiation to be absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe portion reflected by clouds and by the surface also varies\nsubstantially with latitude, owing to the latitudinal variations in\ncloud and ice cover.\nThe intensity of the incoming solar radiation that the Earth receives\nis not constant over time. Over the lifetime of the sun, 4.6 billion\nyears, energy output has varied considerably by roughly 30 percent.\nThe amount of energy the planet receives from the sun is called the\nsolar constant.\nEven more dramatic changes in solar insolation take place on\nshorter timescales \u2013 the diurnal and annual timescale. These\nchanges, however, do not have to do with the net output of the\nSun, but rather the distribution of solar insolation over the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. This distribution is influenced by the Earth\u2019s daily rotation\nabout its axis, which of course leads to night and day, and the\nannual orbit of the Earth about the Sun, which leads to our seasons.\nWhile there is a small component of the seasonality associated with\nchanges in the Earth-Sun distance during the course of the Earth\u2019s\nannual orbit about the Sun (because of the slightly elliptical nature\nof the orbit), the primary reason for the seasons is the tilt of Earth\u2019s\nrotation axis relative to the plane defined by the Earth and the Sun,\nwhich causes the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere 864 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nto be preferentially oriented either towards or away from the Sun,\ndepending on the time of year.\nThe consequence of all of this is that the amount of shortwave\nradiation received from the Sun at the top of the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere varies as a function of both times of day and season.\nSubtle changes in the Earth\u2019s orbital geometry (i.e., changes in the\ntilt of the axis, the degree of ellipticity of the orbit, and the slow\nprecession of the orbit) are responsible for the coming and going of\nthe ice ages over tens of thousands of years. (Overview of the\nClimate System (Part 2) | METEO 469: From Meteorology to\nMitigation: Understanding Global Warming, n.d.)\nGlobal Atmospheric Circulation\nCompared to the global circulation cells and wind belts, the\nposition of a region has a significant effect on its climate. In an area\nwhere the air is mostly rising or sinking, there is not much wind.\nIntertropical Convergence Zone\nThe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is the low-pressure\narea near the equator in the boundary between the two Hadley\nCells. The air rises so that it cools and condenses to create clouds\nand rain. The climate along the ITCZ is therefore warm and wet.\nEarly mariners called this region the doldrums because their ships\nwere often unable to sail because there were no steady winds. 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 865\n\u201cIntertropical Convergence Zone January-July\u201d by NASA is licensed\nas Public Domain.\nThe ITCZ migrates slightly with the season, following the relative\nmotion of sunlight between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of\nCapricorn. Land areas heat more quickly than the oceans. Because\nthere are more land areas in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ is\ninfluenced by the heating effect of the land. During the Northern\nHemisphere\u2019s summer, the ITCZ is approximately 5 degrees north\nof the equator, while in the winter, it shifts back and is\napproximately at the equator. As the ITCZ shifts, the dominant\nwind belts also shift slightly north in summer and south in winter,\nwhich causes the wet and dry seasons in this area.\nHadley Cell and Ferrell Cell Boundaries\nAt about 30 degrees north and south, the air is relatively warm and\ndry because much of it came from the equator where it lost most of\nits moisture at the ITCZ. At this location, the air is descending, and\nsinking air warms and causes evaporation. Sunny conditions, with 866 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nlittle precipitation, tends to occur.

Sailing ships were\nsometimes delayed for so long by the lack of wind that they would\nrun out of water and food for their livestock. Sailors tossed horses\nand other animals over the side after they died. Sailors sometimes\ndid not make it either. (Earth Science | Simple Book Production,\nn.d.)\nPrevailing Winds\nThe prevailing winds are the bases of the Hadley, Ferrell, and Polar 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 867\nCells. These winds influence a region\u2019s climate because they bring\nthe weather from the locations they come from. For example, in\nCalifornia, the predominant winds are the westerlies blowing in\nfrom the Pacific Ocean, which brings in relatively cool air in\nsummer and relatively warm air in winter. Local winds also\ninfluence the local climate. For example, land breezes and sea\nbreezes moderate coastal temperatures. (Earth Science | Simple\nBook Production, n.d.)\nLandmasses\nLocation of Continents\nWhen a location is near a large body of water, the local climate will\nbe directly affected, creating a milder, maritime climate.\nTemperatures typically vary only slightly across the day and year.\nFor a location to have an actual maritime climate, the winds must\nmost often come off the sea. (Climate Systems and Change | Earth\nScience, n.d.)\nWhen a location is not located near any large body of water, the\nregion will typically experience a continental climate. A continental\nclimate has more significant temperature differences between day\nand night and between summer and winter.\nAltitude and Mountain Ranges\nAtmospheric pressure and temperature decrease with altitude\nwithin the troposphere. The closer molecules are packed together, 868 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nthe more likely they are to collide. Collisions between molecules\ngive off heat, which warms the air. At higher altitudes, the air is less\ndense, and air molecules are more spread out and less likely to\ncollide. A location in the mountains has lower average temperatures\nthan one at the base of the mountains. In Colorado, for example,\nLakewood (5,640 feet) average annual temperature is 62 degrees F\n(17 degrees C), while Climax Lake (11,300 feet) is 42 degrees F (5.4\ndegrees C).\nMountain ranges have two effects on the climate of the surrounding\nregion. The first is something called the rain shadow effect, which\nbrings warm, dry climate to the leeward side of a mountain range,\nas described in the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere chapter. The second effect\nmountains have on climate systems is the ability to separate coastal\nregions from the rest of the continent. Since a maritime air mass\nmay have trouble rising over a mountain range, the coastal area will\nhave a maritime climate, but the inland area on the leeward side will\nhave a continental climate.\nOcean Circulation Patterns\nWhile we have focused primarily on the atmosphere thus far, the\noceans, too, play a crucial role in relieving the radiation imbalance\nby transporting heat from lower to higher latitudes. The oceans also\nplay a crucial role in both climate variability and climate change, as\nwe will see. There are two primary components of ocean\ncirculation. The first component is the horizontal circulation,\ncharacterized by wind-driven ocean gyres. 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 869\n\u201cOcean Gyres Ocean Currents\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe major surface currents are associated with ocean gyres. These\ninclude the warm poleward western boundary currents such as the\nGulf Stream, which is associated with the North Atlantic Gyre, and\nthe Kuroshio Current associated with the North Pacific Gyre.\nThese gyres also contain cold equatorward eastern boundary\ncurrents such as the Canary Current in the eastern North Atlantic\nand the California Current in the western North Atlantic. Similar\ncurrent systems are found in the Southern Hemisphere. The\nhorizontal patterns of ocean circulation are driven by the\nalternating patterns of wind as a function of latitude, and, in\nparticular, by the tendency for westerly winds in mid-latitudes and\neasterly winds in the tropics, discussed above.\nAn essential additional mode of ocean circulation is\nthe thermohaline circulation, which is sometimes referred to as\nthe meridional overturning circulation or MOC. The circulation\npattern is shown below. By contrast with the horizontal gyre\ncirculations, the MOC can be viewed as a vertical circulation 870 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\npattern associated with a tendency for sinking motion in the high-\nlatitudes of the North Atlantic, and rising motion more broadly in\nthe tropics and subtropics of the Indian and Pacific ocean. This\ncirculation pattern is driven by contrasts in density, which are, in\nturn, primarily due to variations in both temperature and salinity\n(hence the term thermohaline). The sinking motion is associated\nwith relatively cold, salty surface waters of the subpolar North\nAtlantic, and the rising motion with the relatively warm waters in\nthe tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian ocean.\n\u201cThermohaline Circulation\u201d is licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe image above is a highly schematized and simple description of\nthe actual vertical patterns of circulation in the ocean. Nonetheless,\nthe conveyor belt is a useful mnemonic. The northward surface\nbranch of this circulation pattern in the North Atlantic is\nsometimes erroneously called the Gulf Stream. The Gulf Stream, as\ndiscussed above, is part of the circulating waters of the wind-driven\nocean gyre circulation. By contrast, the northward extension of the\nthermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic is rightfully referred 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 871\nto as the North Atlantic Drift. This current system represents a net\ntransport of warm surface waters to higher latitudes in the North\nAtlantic and is also an essential means by which the climate system\ntransports heat poleward from lower latitudes. Changes in this\ncurrent system are speculated as having played a key role in past and\npotential future climate changes.\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text.

The closer\nmolecules are packed together, the more likely they are to collide.\nCollisions between molecules give off heat, which warms the air.\nThe air is less dense at higher altitudes, and air molecules are more\nspread out and less likely to collide. A location in the mountains has\nlower average temperatures than one at the base of the mountains. 872 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nIn Colorado, for example, Lakewood (5,640 feet) average annual\ntemperature is 17 degrees Celsius (62 degrees Fahrenheit), while\nClimax Lake (11,300 feet) is 5.4 degrees Celsius (42 degrees\nFahrenheit). (Climate and Its Causes | Earth Science, n.d.)\nComposition of the Atmosphere\nThe troposphere is composed of nitrogen (78 percent), oxygen (21\npercent), argon (less than 1 percent), and a variety of other gases.\nThere are a few outliers, which include ozone and methane. Ozone\nis primarily found in the stratosphere that creates the ozone layer.\nOzone is also found near the Earth\u2019s surface from photochemical\nsmog, from the emission of vehicles. Significant methane sources\ninclude the digestion of food from cattle, fracking of natural gas,\ncoal mines, and deforestation. Because these sources have\ngeographic locations where they occur, consistent sources on\nEarth\u2019s surface can be found.\nGreenhouse gases are composed of carbon dioxide, water vapor,\nmethane, and some other gasses in smaller quantities. These gasses\nare essential for scientists to monitor, analyze, and understand\nbecause of their ability to trap radiation in the lower atmosphere.\nThe greenhouse effect\u2019s strength and intensity will depend on the\natmosphere\u2019s temperature and the number of greenhouse gases that\nthe atmosphere holds. 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE | 873\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of\nthe text. You can view it online here:\nhttps:\/\/slcc.pressbooks.pub\/physicalgeography\/?p=742\nThe term \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d is an incorrect description of how\nenergy is retained within the troposphere. Greenhouses warm the\natmosphere within them by reducing airflow and circulation, not\nby \u201ctrapping heat.\u201d Nevertheless, the Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse\neffect is critical to supporting life. Human activities, such as\nburning fossil fuels and deforestation, have strengthened the\nnatural greenhouse effect and causing the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to\nwarm over a noticeably short period. 874 | 10.2 CONTROLS OF CLIMATE\nElevation\nAtmospheric pressure and temperature decrease with altitude\nwithin the troposphere. The closer molecules are, the more likely\nthey will collide into each other. Collisions between molecules give\noff energy and heat, which warms the surrounding atmosphere. At\nhigher altitudes, the atmosphere is less dense, the air molecules are\nmore spread out, and less likely to collide. On average, a location in\nthe mountains has lower average temperatures than at the base of\nthe mountains. Mountain ranges have two effects on the climate of\nthe surrounding region. The first is called the rain shadow effect,\nwhich brings a warm, dry climate to the leeward side of a mountain\nrange. The second effect mountains have on climate systems is the\nability to separate coastal regions from the rest of the continent.\nSince a maritime air mass may have trouble rising over a mountain\nrange, the coastal area will have a maritime climate, but the in-land\narea on the leeward side will have a continental climate. (Climate\nSystems and Change | Earth Science, n.d.) 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN\nCLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nA climate zone results from an area\u2019s climate conditions:\ntemperature, humidity, amount and type of precipitation, and\nseasonality. The significant factors that influence climate determine\nthe different climate zones around the world. In general, the same\nclimate zone will be found at similar latitudes and in similar\npositions on nearly all continents, both in the Northern and\nSouthern Hemispheres. The one exception to this pattern is the\ncontinental climates, which are not found at higher latitudes in the\nSouthern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere\nlandmasses are not broad enough to produce a continental climate.\nThe most common system used to classify climatic zones is the\nK\u00f6ppen classification system. This system is based on the\ntemperature, amount of precipitation, and the year when\nprecipitation occurs. Since climate determines the type of\nvegetation that grows in an area, vegetation is often used as an\nindicator of climate type.\nA climate type and its plants and animals make up a biome. The\norganisms of a biome share specific characteristics worldwide\nbecause their environment has similar advantages and challenges.\nThe organisms have adapted to that environment in similar ways\nover time. For example, distinct cactus species live on different 876 | 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\ncontinents, but they have adapted to the harsh desert in similar\nways.\nK\u00f6ppen Classification System\nThe K\u00f6ppen classification system was developed by the German\nclimatologist, Wladimir K\u00f6ppen in 1918. The classification system\nfocuses on the average monthly and annual temperature and\nprecipitation totals for a location. The K\u00f6ppen classification system\nrecognizes four major climate groups based on temperature values\n(identified by the capital letters A, C, D, and E), and the fifth based\non moisture (identified by the capital letter B), to create global\nclimate patterns. The major climate groups can then be subdivided\ninto more specific categories based on a combination of\ntemperature and moisture patterns for any region in the world. A\nnewer system called the modified K\u00f6ppen classification system is\nused today after several modifications by geographers and\nclimatologists over time. The modified version still has the five\nmajor climate categories, which are broken down into fourteen\nsubcategories. The modified version also has a new category for\n\u201chighland,\u201d represented with the capital letter H, and focuses on\nmountainous regions.\nThe modified K\u00f6ppen classification system is straightforward and\nquick to identify global and regional climates. The first letter\n(always a capital letter), represents the primary climate type. The\nsecond, lower-case letter identifies the precipitation patterns for a\nlocation. Finally, the third letter, again in the lower-case, is used to\nidentify the precipitation patterns for that location. 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM | 877\nClimatologists create climographs to identify and understand the\nprecise climate for a location visually. Each climograph visualized\naverage temperature and precipitation patterns for a location, over a\nsingle year. Temperature is represented as a continuous line, while\nprecipitation is represented as monthly bars.\nThere are a variety of resources available from NOAA to analyze\nclimate data. (Visualizing Climate Data | NOAA Climate.Gov,\nn.d.)\n\u2022 Data Snapshots\n\u2022 NOAA View Data Exploration Tool\n\u2022 The Climate Explore\n\u2022 Panopoly\n\u2022 NOAA Weather and Climate Toolkit\nTropical Climates (Group A)\nTropical climates are found between 15 to 25 degrees north and\nsouth of the equator. These climates tend to have warm\ntemperatures with every month averaging 18 degrees Celsius (64\ndegrees Fahrenheit), with abundant precipitation, approximately\n150 cm (59 inches) per year. This climate group is broken down\ninto three categories, based on precipitation.\nTropical Wet (Af)\nTropical wet climates are found between 10 degrees north and\nsouth of the equator. These regions have almost no annual 878 | 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\ntemperature variation and tremendous amounts of rainfall year-\nround, between 175 and 250 cm (65 and 100 inches). These\nconditions support the tropical rainforest biome, which is densely\npacked, broadleaf evergreen trees. These regions tend to have the\nhighest number of species or biodiversity of any ecosystem.\nTropical Monsoon (Am)\nTropical monsoon climates are defined by seasonal monsoonal\nwind patterns in southern Asia, northeastern South America, and\nwestern Africa. The monsoon tends to be strongest in regions\nwhere strong monsoonal winds blow from sea to land, such as\nIndia. These climates tend to have incredible amounts of\nprecipitation (over 75 centimeters or 30 inches) for two or three\nmonths, followed by drier conditions for the rest of the year.\nRainforests can still grow in these regions because most of the year\nsupplies abundant moisture.\nTropical Savanna (Aw)\nTropical savanna climates lie between about 5 to 20 degrees\nnorth and south latitude and are defined by dry winters and very\nwet summers. During the summer months, the Intertropical\nConvergent Zone (ITCZ) migrates into the region, bringing vast\nquantities of moisture (90 to 180 centimeters or 35 to 70 inches\nannually). During the winter months, the ITCZ migrates away\nfrom the region, bringing arid conditions. The average annual\ntemperature ranges are roughly 3 to 8 degrees Celsius (5 to 15\ndegrees Fahrenheit). 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM | 879\nDry Climates (Group B)\nDry climates have higher evapotranspiration than precipitation,\ncreating a moisture deficit. Transpiration is the movement of\nwater through a plant and evaporation from the plant.\nEvapotranspiration is the total between evaporation and plant\ntranspiration. Dry climates are found in more regions of the world\nthan any other climate group, covering roughly 30 percent of\nEarth\u2019s landmass. These regions tend to have abundant sunshine,\nhot summers, and cold winters. Precipitation tends to be irregular,\nbut less than total evaporation. Short-term droughts are frequent,\nwhich can last several years or even decades. Dry climates are\ndivided based mostly on the relationship between\nevapotranspiration and precipitation.\nArid Desert (Bw)\nArid deserts tend to be found between 15 and 30 degrees north\nand south, where warm, dry air sinks because of subtropical high\nzones. Vast deserts, such as the Sahara or Gobi deserts, make up\nroughly 12 percent of the Earth\u2019s landmass. The typical weather is\nsweltering summer days and chilly winter nights. Although annual\nrainfall is less than 25 cm (10 inches), precipitation tends to fall\nduring two seasons.\nSemi-Arid or Steppe (Bs)\nSemi-arid deserts, also called steppe, are found in continental\ninteriors or rainshadow regions. Semi-arid deserts receive between 880 | 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\n20 and 40 cm (8 to 16 inches) of rain annually. In the United States,\nthe Great Plains, portions of the southern California coast, and the\nGreat Basin are semi-arid deserts.\nTemperate Climates (Group C)\nTemperate climates have been described as a transition zone\nbetween tropical climates and polar climates. Winter months tend\nto be -3 to 18 degrees Celsius (27 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit),\nsummer months warmer than 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees\nFahrenheit), and plentiful annual precipitation. Temperature\nclimates have four seasons, with summer and winter being\ndominant.\nMediterranean (Cs)\nMediterranean climates are found on the western sides of\ncontinents between 30 to 45 degrees north and south. There are\nseveral characteristics of Mediterranean climates. Most of their\nannual precipitation occurs during the winter months with totals\nof 30 to 90 cm (14 to 35 inches) and hot and dry summer months.\nBecause of their relative location near the subtropical high-pressure\nzones, these climates tend to have plenty of sunshine during the\nsummer.\nHumid Subtropical (Cfa, Cwa, Cwb)\nHumid subtropical climates are found mostly on the eastern\nsides of continents. Precipitation occurs throughout the year with 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM | 881\nannual averages between 80 and 165 cm (31 and 65 inches).\nSummer days are humid and hot, from the lower 30s up to 40\ndegrees Celsius (mid-80 is up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit).\nAfternoon and evening thunderstorms are frequent as warm\ntropical air passing over the hot continent. Winters are mild, but\nmidlatitude storms, called cyclones, may bring substantial amounts\nof precipitation. The southeastern United States, with its hot\nhumid summers and mild, but frosty winters, is typical of this\nclimate zone.\nMarine West Coast (Cfb, Cfc)\nMarine west coast climates follow the coasts of continents,\nbetween 40 degrees and 65 degrees north. Common regions with\nthis climate include the Pacific Northwest in the United States,\nwestern and central Europe, New Zealand, and southeast Australia.\nOcean winds bring mild winters and cool summers, with daily and\nannual temperature ranges being relatively small. Precipitation\ntends to occur year-round, although summers are drier as the jet\nstream moves northward. Low clouds, fog, and drizzle are typical.\nContinental Climates (Group D)\nContinental climates are only found in the Northern\nHemisphere, between 40 and 70 degrees north. What defines\ncontinental climates is the lack of large bodies of water. These\nclimates are only found at midlatitudes, within large, continental\nlandmasses. All four seasons, rather than wet and dry seasons, are\nfound in continental climates. This climate group tends to have 882 | 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nwarm summer temperatures, with monthly averages over 10 degrees\nCelsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). However, the coldest months can\ndrop below -3 degrees Celsius (-27 degrees Fahrenheit). Their\nwinters tend to be cold and stormy, and snowfall stays on the\nground for extended periods is common. Trees grow in continental\nclimates, even though winters are frigid because the average annual\ntemperature is mild.\nHumid Continental (Dfa, Dfb, Dwa, Dwb)\nHumid continental climates are found around the polar front\n(roughly 60 degrees north) in North America and Europe. In the\nwinter, midlatitude cyclones bring chilly temperatures, snow, and\nprolonged winters. In the summer, westerly winds bring\ncontinental weather and warm temperatures. The average summer\ntemperatures are often above 20 degrees Celsius (70 degrees\nFahrenheit). The region typically has deciduous trees, which\nprotect themselves in winter by losing their leaves.\nThe two variations of this climate are based on summer\ntemperatures. Dfa climates tend to have long, hot summers with\ntemperatures over 38 degrees Celsius (over 100 degrees Fahrenheit).\nNighttime temperatures are warm, with temperatures roughly 31\ndegrees Celsius (56 degrees Fahrenheit). The long summers and\nhigh humidity foster plant growth. Dfb climates tend to have cool\nsummers and lower humidity levels. Winter temperatures can drop\nbelow -18 degrees Celsius for extended periods. 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM | 883\nSubpolar (Dfc, Dfd, Dwc, Dwd)\nSubpolar climates are dominated by continental polar air, over\nfrigid continents. Snowfall is light, but cold temperatures keep\nsnow on the ground for months. Most of the approximately 50 cm\n(20 inches) of annual precipitation falls during summer cyclonic\nstorms. The sun\u2019s rays\u2019 angle is low, but the sun is visible for most\nor all of the day during the summer. These continental regions have\nextreme annual temperature ranges. The boreal, coniferous forests\nin the subpolar climate are called taiga and have small, hardy, and\nwidely spaced trees. Taiga vast forests stretch across Eurasia and\nNorth America.\nPolar Climates (Group E)\nPolar climates are found across the continents that border the\nArctic Ocean, Greenland, upper Canada, and Antarctica. These\nclimates tend to have bitterly cold winters and cool summers\nbecause of the sun\u2019s low angle. The average temperature of the\nwarmest months tends to be less than 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees\nFahrenheit). Regions with this climate tend to be quite dry, with\nannual precipitation less than 25 cm (10 inches). Most of the\nprecipitation from this climate occurs during the summer months\nbut stay on the ground year-round. Data shows that the polar\nregions are warming faster than any other climate group because of\nanthropogenic climate change. This causes places like Greenland to\nmelt rapidly while creating a prolonged, ice-free North Pole during\nthe summer months. 884 | 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\nTundra (ET)\nTundra climates were first described by the type of vegetation that\ngrew in the region. Today, the climate is defined by the 10 degrees\nCelsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) isotherm, where the warmest\nmonth of the year exists for the region. This isotherm\u2019s importance\nis because it corresponds to the treeline, which is the farthest limit\nof where trees can grow because of limited moisture and\ntemperatures.\nTemperatures in tundra climates are so cold that a layer of\npermanently frozen ground, called permafrost forms below the\nsurface and can extend hundreds of meters below the surface. The\naverage temperature of the warmest months is above freezing, so\nsummer temperatures defrost the uppermost part of the\npermafrost, sometimes causing soggy conditions. In winter, the\npermafrost prevents water from draining downward. Although the\nprecipitation is low enough in many places to qualify as a desert,\nevaporation rates are also low, so the landscape receives more usable\nwater than a desert. Because of the lack of ice-free land near the\nSouth Pole, there is little tundra in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIce Cap (EF)\nIce cap climates are found mostly on Greenland and Antarctica\nand may be thousands of meters thick. Because of their latitude\nand the sun\u2019s continuous low angle, these climates have extremely\nlow average annual temperatures, around -29 degrees Celsius (-20\ndegrees Fahrenheit). Precipitation is low because the air is too cold 10.3 K\u00d6PPEN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM | 885\nto hold significant amounts of moisture. Because of the permanent\nice cover, no vegetation exits in ice cap climates\nHighland Climates (Group H)\nWhen climate conditions in a small area are different from those of\nthe surroundings, the climate of the small area is called highland\nclimates. Altitude mimics latitude for climate groups and was not\nconsidered in the original K\u00f6ppen classification system. Climates\nand biomes typically found at higher latitudes may also be found in\nother areas of the world at high altitudes. Other factors that will\ninfluence highland climates, specifically temperature and moisture\npatterns, include orographic uplifting, rainshadow effects, slope\nand aspect of mountains, and local wind patterns. 10.4 CLIMATE CHANGE IN\nEARTH'S HISTORY\nFor the past two centuries, the climate has been relatively stable.\nPeople placed their farms and cities in locations that were in a\nfavorable climate without thinking that the climate could change.\nHowever, the climate has changed throughout Earth\u2019s history, and\na stable climate is not the norm. In recent years, Earth\u2019s climate has\nbegun to change again due to human activities that release\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The effects of warming are\nalready being seen and will become more extreme as temperature\nrise.\nClimate has changed throughout Earth\u2019s history. Much of the time,\nEarth\u2019s climate was hotter and more humid than it is today, but the\nclimate has also been colder, as when glaciers covered much more of\nthe planet. The most recent ice ages were in the Pleistocene Epoch,\nbetween 1.8 million and approximately 10,000 years ago. During\nthe Pleistocene, glaciers advanced and retreated in cycles, known as\nglacial and interglacial periods. With so much of the world\u2019s water-\nbound into the ice, sea level was about 125 meters (395 feet) lower\nthan it is today. Climatologists think that we are now in a warm,\ninterglacial period that has lasted about 10,000 years.\nFor the past few thousand years, the climate has been mild and\nstable compared with most of Earth\u2019s history. That climate stability 10.4 CLIMATE CHANGE IN EARTH'S HISTORY | 887\nhas allowed the expansion of agriculture and the development of\ntowns and cities.\nSmall temperature changes can have had significant effects on the\nglobal climate. The average global temperature during glacial\nperiods was only about 5.5 degrees Celsius (10 degrees Fahrenheit)\nless than Earth\u2019s current average temperature. Global temperatures\nduring the interglacial periods were about 1.1 degrees Celsius\n(roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than today.\nSince the end of the Pleistocene, the global average temperature has\nrisen about 4 degrees Celsius (7 degrees Fahrenheit). Glaciers are\nretreating, and sea level is rising. While climate is getting steadily\nwarmer, there have also been hot and cool times in the last 10,000\nyears, and those changes have had severe impacts on civilization. For\nexample, the Medieval Warm Period from 900 to 1300 A.D. allowed\nVikings to colonize Greenland and Great Britain to grow wine\ngrapes. The Little Ice Age, from the 14th to 19th centuries, the\nVikings were forced out of Greenland, and humans had to plant\ncrops further south. 10.5 EL NINO AND LA NINA\nShort-term changes in regional and global climate are frequent,\nwith the largest and most important of these is the El Ni\u00f1o\nSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). The ENSO drives changes in\nclimate that are experienced around the world about every two to\nseven years.\nIn a typical year, the trade winds blow across the Pacific Ocean near\nthe equator from east to west (toward Asia). A low-pressure cell\nrises above the western equatorial Pacific, warming the ocean\nsurface water in the western Pacific Ocean, raising sea levels by one-\nhalf meter because of thermal expansion. Along the western coast\nof South America, Peru Current carries cold water northward and\nthen westward along the equator with the trade winds.\nConsequentially, upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters from\nthe deep sea to the surface near Peru.\nIn an El Ni\u00f1o year, when the water temperature reaches around 28\ndegrees Celsius (82 degrees Fahrenheit), the trade winds weaken or\nreverse direction and blow east (toward South America). Warm\nwater is dragged back across the Pacific Ocean and piles up off the\nwest coast of South America. With warm, low-density water at the\nsurface, upwelling ceases to occur, causing nutrients in the water to\nbecome scarce, causing plankton populations to decline. Since\nplankton forms the base of the food web, fish cannot find food, and 10.5 EL NINO AND LA NINA | 889\nfish numbers decrease. All the animals that eat fish, including birds\nand humans, are affected by the decline in fish.\nBy altering atmospheric and oceanic circulation, El Ni\u00f1o events\nchange global climate patterns. Some regions receive more than\naverage rainfall, including the west coast of North and South\nAmerica, the southern United States, and Western Europe.\nDrought occurs in other parts of South America, the western\nPacific, southern and northern Africa, and southern Europe.\nAn El Ni\u00f1o cycle lasts only a few years, with normal circulation\npatterns resuming. Sometimes circulation patterns bounce back\nquickly and remarkably, called La Ni\u00f1a. During a La Ni\u00f1a year, as\nin a typical year, trade winds move from east to west, and warm\nwater piles up in the western Pacific Ocean. Ocean temperatures\nalong coastal South America are colder than average (instead of\nwarmer, as in El Ni\u00f1o). Coldwater reaches farther into the western\nPacific than usual.\nOther significant oscillations are smaller and have a local, rather\nthan global, effect. The North Atlantic Oscillation mostly alters the\nclimate in Europe. The Mediterranean also goes through cycles,\nvarying between being dry at sometimes, and warm and wet at\nothers. (Dastrup, 2014) 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE\nCHANGE\nTo have an intelligent and fact-driven conversation about the\nplanet\u2019s current warming, one must have a strong understanding of\nthe natural causes, processes, and cycles of naturally occurring\nclimate change. Sophisticated climate models analyze these natural\nprocesses and cycles to analyze past, present, and future climate\ntrends and patterns.\nPlate Tectonics\nAs noted in the textbook regarding the theory of plate tectonics,\ntectonic plates are moving around the Earth\u2019s surface because of\nconvection within the mantle. This is the driving force of mountain\nbuilding, earthquakes, and volcanoes around the planet. However,\nthe movement of tectonic plates can also alter regional and global\nclimates. Over millions of years, as seas open and close, ocean\ncurrents may distribute heat differently across the planet. For\nexample, when all the continents are together as one supercontinent\n(such as Pangaea), nearly all location experiences a continental\nclimate. When the continents separate, heat is more evenly\ndistributed.\nPlate tectonic movements can also contribute or even start an ice\nage. When continents are near the poles, ice can accumulate, which 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE | 891\nmay increase albedo and lower global temperature to start a global\nice age.\nTectonic plate motions can trigger volcanic eruptions, which may\nrelease dust and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Frequent\neruptions, even large ones, have only a short-term effect on weather.\nHowever, massive volcanic eruptions can create lava plateaus,\nreleasing vast quantities of carbon dioxide that can change the\nclimate for years or decades. This type of eruption is exceedingly\nrare and has not occurred in human history.\nMilankovitch Cycles\nThe most extreme climate of recent Earth history was the\nPleistocene. Scientists attribute a series of ice ages to variations in\nEarth\u2019s position relative to the sun, known as Milankovitch cycles.\nThe Earth goes through regular variations in its position compared\nto the sun.\nThe shape of the Earth\u2019s orbit changes slightly as it goes around the\nsun, called eccentricity. The orbit varies from more circular to\nmore elliptical in a cycle lasting between 90,000 and 100,000 years.\nWhen the orbit is more elliptical, there is a more significant\ndifference in solar radiation between winter and summer.\nThe Earth also wobbles on its axis of rotation, called precession. At\none extreme of this 27,000-year cycle, the Northern Hemisphere\npoints toward the sun when the Earth is closest to the sun.\nSummers are much warmer, and winters are much colder than now.\nAt the opposite extreme, the Northern Hemisphere points toward 892 | 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE\nthe sun when it is farthest from the sun, resulting in cool summers\nand warmer winters.\nThe planet\u2019s tilt on its axis varies between 22.1 degrees and 24.5\ndegrees, called obliquity, which has a 41,000-year cycle. Seasons are\ncaused by the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, which is currently 23.5\ndegrees. When the tilt angle is smaller, summers and winters differ\nless in temperature. (Causes of Long-Term Climate Change |\nPhysical Geography, n.d.)\nSun Variation\nThe amount of energy the sun radiates is relatively constant over\ngeologic time but slightly fluctuates over the decades. Part of this\nfluctuation occurs because of sunspots, magnetic storms on the\nsun\u2019s surface that increase and decrease over an 11-year cycle.\nWhen the number of sunspots is high, solar radiation is also\nrelatively high. However, the entire variation in solar radiation is\ntiny relative to the total amount of solar radiation, and there is no\nknown 11-year cycle in climate variability. The Little Ice Age\ncorresponded to a time when there were no sunspots on the sun.\n(Causes of Long-Term Climate Change | Physical Geography, n.d.)\nChanges in Atmospheric\nGreenhouse Gas Levels\nClimatic data from ice core drillings rings within coral reefs and 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE | 893\ntrees, ocean and lake sediments, and other sources indicate that\nwhen greenhouse gasses increase in the atmosphere, global\ntemperatures rise. When greenhouse gasses decrease in the\natmosphere, global temperatures fall. In 1958, the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) began\nmeasuring carbon dioxide levels in real-time. What direct\nmeasurements of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere indicate is that\nevery year, the concentration of the gas increases globally every six\nmonths and decreases six months later. This has mostly to do with\nthe continents in the northern hemisphere, where the landmass and\ntrees are located. During the warmer months, the trees in the\nnorthern hemisphere begin photosynthesizing by taking carbon\ndioxide out of the atmosphere and uses sunlight to create\nchlorophyll. This causes global greenhouse gases to decrease for six\nmonths. When the northern hemisphere experiences fall and\nwinter, the trees stop photosynthesizing and become dormant,\ncausing global greenhouse gases to increase. However, even though\ncarbon dioxide levels increase and decrease every year, the global\ntrend is that carbon dioxide levels are growing every year. Current\nmeasurements from NASA show that carbon dioxide levels are at\n413 ppm, the highest the Earth has seen in nearly a million years.\n(NASA, n.d.)\nRecently, NASA has created ultra-high-resolution computer\nmodels, giving scientists a data-driven visualization of carbon\ndioxide as it flows around the world.\nGreenhouse gas levels have varied throughout Earth history. For\nexample, carbon dioxide has been present at concentrations of less\nthan 200 parts per million (ppm) and higher levels than today. 894 | 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE\nHowever, for at least 650,000 years, carbon dioxide has never risen\nabove 300 ppm, during either glacial or interglacial periods. Natural\nprocesses add (volcanic eruptions and the decay or burning of\norganic matter) and remove absorption by plants, animal tissue,\nand the ocean) carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When plants\nbecome a form of fossil fuel, the carbon dioxide in their tissue is\nstored with them, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n(NASA, n.d.)\nFossil fuel use has skyrocketed in the past few decades more people\nwant more cars and industrial products, releasing vast quantities of\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Burning tropical rainforests, to\nclear land for agriculture, a practice called slash-and-burn\nagriculture, also increases atmospheric carbon dioxide. By cutting\ndown trees, they can no longer remove carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere. Burning the trees releases all the carbon dioxide stored\nin the trees into the atmosphere.\nThe atmosphere currently holds over 40 percent more carbon\ndioxide than it did during the Industrial Revolution.\nApproximately 65 percent of that increase has occurred since the\nfirst carbon dioxide measurements were made on Mauna Loa\nVolcano, Hawaii, in 1958. Carbon dioxide is a critical greenhouse\nthat must monitor because of human activity. However, other\ngreenhouse gases are increasing as well. (The Causes of Climate\nChange, n.d.) The primary greenhouse gases include:\n\u2022 Water vapor (36 to 70 percent of total): is the most abundant\nand potent greenhouse gas on the planet and is part of the\nhydrologic cycle. 10.6 LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE | 895\n\u2022 Carbon dioxide (9 to 26 percent of total): released from the\nburning of fossil fuels.\n\u2022 Methane (4 to 9 percent of total): released from raising\nlivestock, rice production, and the incomplete burning of\nrainforest plants.\n\u2022 Tropospheric ozone (3 to 7 percent of total): from vehicle\nexhaust, it has more than doubled since 1976. 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nThe scientific consensus is clear, in that most scientists who directly\nstudy climates and climate change state that the current warming of\nthe planet is anthropogenic. Moreover, all the scientific evidence\nand vital planetary signs indicate that more greenhouse gases are\ntrapping Earth\u2019s heat, causing average annual global temperatures\nto rise. While temperatures have risen since the end of the\nPleistocene, roughly 10,000 years ago, most of the warming has\noccurred since 1900. The nine warmest years on record have all\noccurred since 1998, and NASA and NOAA reported in 2019 that\nthe year 2018 was the fourth warmest ever recorded on the planet.\n(2019 Was 2nd Hottest Year on Record for Earth Say NOAA,\nNASA | National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, n.d.)\nIt has now been determined that 2010-2020 was the warmest\ndecade on record, followed by 2000-2010.\nThe United States has long been the largest emitter of greenhouse\ngases, with about 20 percent of total emissions. As a result of\nChina\u2019s rapid economic growth, its emissions surpassed those of the\nUnited States in 2008. However, it is also essential to keep in mind\nthat the United States has only about one-fifth of China\u2019s\npopulation. What is the significance of this? The average United\nStates citizen produces far more greenhouse gases than the average\nChinese person. (Dastrup et al., 2019) 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE | 897\nPredicting Future Warming\nClimate change can be a naturally occurring process and has created\nenvironments much warmer than today, such as the early\nCretaceous period. During this time, life thrived even in regions,\nsuch as the interior of Antarctica, which is uninhabitable today.\nOne misconception is that the threat of climate change has to do\nwith the absolute warmth of the Earth. The concern more for\nscientists has to do with the rate of change of that temperature\nincrease. Living organisms, including humans, can quickly adapt to\nsubstantial changes in climate if the changes take place slowly, over\nthousands of years. However, adapting to changes that are taking\nplace on timescales of decades is far more challenging. The Earth is\nwarming at such a rate that most species will struggle to adapt and\nevolve quickly enough to the coming warmer climates.\nThe natural increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that led to the\nthaw after the last Ice Age was an increase from 180 parts per\nmillion (ppm) to about 280 ppm. This was a smaller increase than\nthe present-time increase due to human activities, such as fossil fuel\nburning, which thus far has raised carbon dioxide levels from the\npre-industrial value of 280 ppm to a current level of over 410 ppm,\na level which is increasing by 2 ppm every year. If the dawn of\nindustrialization had occurred 18,000 years ago, we might have sent\nthe climate from an ice age into the modern pre-industrial state.\nHow long it would have taken to melt all of the ice is not precisely\nknown, but it is conceivable it could have happened over a period as\nshort as two centuries. The area ultimately flooded would be 898 | 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE\nconsiderably more significant than that currently projected to flood\ndue to the human-caused elevation of carbon dioxide that has taken\nplace so far. (Dastrup et al., 2019)\nThe amount of carbon dioxide levels will continue to rise in the\ndecades to come. However, the impacts will not be evenly\ndistributed across the planet. Those impacts will depend on\nenvironmental and climate factors; other impacts will depend on\nwhether the countries are developed or emerging. Climatologists\nand other scientists use sophisticated computer models to predict\nthe causes, effects, and impacts of greenhouse gas increase on\nclimate systems globally, and for specific regions of the world.\n(Dastrup et al., 2019)\nIf nothing is done to control greenhouse gas emissions, and they\ncontinue to increase at current rates, the surface temperature of the\nEarth can be expected to increase between 0.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius\n(0.9 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2050, and between 2 to 4.5\ndegrees Celsius (3.5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, with carbon\ndioxide levels over 800 ppm.\nWhatever the temperature increase, it will not be uniform around\nthe globe. A rise of 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) would\nresult in 0.6-1.2 degrees Celsius (1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit) at the\nequator, but up to 6.7 degrees Celsius (12 degrees Fahrenheit) at\nthe poles. Climate change has affected the North Pole more than\nthe South Pole, but temperatures are still increasing in Antarctica. 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE | 899\nEffects of Anthropogenic\nClimate Change\nThere are a variety of possibilities and the effects of climate change\non human and natural environments. NASA has tried to list some\nof those potential effects and can be found here. NASA also has a\nwebsite called the Climate Time Machine, to help visualize Earth\u2019s\nkey climate indicators and how they are changing over time.\nHUMAN IMPACTS AND MIGRATION\nSpecies Mating and Migration\nThe timing of events for species is changing. Mating and migrations\nare starting to occur earlier in the spring months, and species that\nare more mobile are migrating to cooler temperatures and more\nabundant water. Some regions that were already marginal for\nagriculture are no longer farmable because they have become too\nwarm or dry.\nMelting Snowpack and Glaciers\nDecreased snowpacks, shrinking glaciers, and the earlier arrival of\nspring will lessen the amount of water available in some regions of\nthe world, including the western United States and much of Asia.\nIce will continue to melt, and sea level is predicted to rise 18 to 97\ncm (7 to 38 inches) by 2100. An increase this large will gradually\nflood coastal regions where about one-third of the world\u2019s\npopulation lives, forcing millions of people to move inland. 900 | 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE\nGlaciers are melting, and vegetation zones are moving uphill. If\nfossil fuel use exploded in the 1950s, why do these changes begin\nearly in the animation? Does this mean that the climate change we\nsee is caused by natural processes and not by fossil fuel use?\nOceans and Rising Sea Levels\nAs greenhouse gases increase, changes will be more extreme. Oceans\nwill become slightly more acidic, making it more difficult for\ncreatures with carbonate shells to grow, and that includes coral\nreefs. A study monitoring ocean acidity in the Pacific Northwest\nfound ocean acidity increasing ten times faster than expected, and\n10 to 20 percent of shellfish (mussels) being replaced by acid-\ntolerant algae.\nPlant and animal species seeking cooler temperatures will need to\nmove poleward 100 to 150 km (60 to 90 miles) or upward 150 m\n(500 feet) for each 1.0 degrees Celsius (8 degrees Fahrenheit) rise in\nglobal temperature. There will be a tremendous loss of biodiversity\nbecause forest species cannot migrate that rapidly. Biologists have\nalready documented the extinction of high-altitude species that\nhave nowhere higher to go.\nOne may notice that the numerical predictions above contain wide\nranges. Sea level, for example, is expected to rise somewhere\nbetween 18 and 97 centimeters by 2100. The reason for this\nuncertainty is that scientists cannot precisely predict how the Earth\nwill respond to increased levels of greenhouse gases. How quickly\ngreenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere depends\nin part on the choices we make. (Dastrup et al., 2019) 10.7 ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE | 901\nExtreme Weather\nWeather will become more extreme with heatwaves and droughts.\nSophisticated computer models predict that the Midwestern\nUnited States will become too dry to support agriculture and that\nCanada will become the new breadbasket. In all, about 10 to 50\npercent of current cropland worldwide may become unusable if\ncarbon dioxide doubles. Global monitoring systems help monitor\npotential droughts that could turn into famines if they occur in\npolitically and socially unstable regions of the world and if\nappropriate action is not taken in time. One example is the Famine\nEarly Warning System Network (FEWS NET), a network of social\nand environmental scientists using geospatial technology to\nmonitor these situations. However, even with proper monitoring, if\nnations do not act, catastrophes can occur like in Somalia from\n2010-2012.\nAlthough scientists do not all agree, hurricanes are likely to become\nmore severe and more frequent. Tropical and subtropical insects\nwill expand their ranges, resulting in the spread of tropical diseases\nsuch as malaria, encephalitis, yellow fever, and dengue fever.\nAn important question people ask is this: Are the increases in global\ntemperature natural? In other words, can natural variations in\ntemperature account for the increase in temperature that we see?\nThe scientific data shows no, natural variations cannot explain the\ndramatic increase in global temperatures.
