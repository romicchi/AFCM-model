Introduction\nWelcome to Writing in the Social Sciences!\nAuthor Biographies\nAcknowledgements\nThis content is provided to you freely by BYU Open Textbook Network.\nAccess it online or download it at https://open.byu.edu/writing/introduction.\n1 2 Welcome to Writing in the Social Sciences!\nCristie Cowles Charles\nAverage Reading Time: 9 Minutes\nWhen we decided to create a new textbook about Writing in the Social Sciences, we made one major goal: that it NOT\nbe boring. (We hope you agree!) So we chose this interactive online venue with cool tech we thought you'd enjoy:\nembedded videos inside the textbook, lots of images and graphics, embedded quiz and discussion questions, and even\nlive links so you don't have to leave the textbook to go to a web page. Plus, you can read it anywhere: on a computer,\ntablet, and even your phone!\nMy majestic office view. #nofilter (Image by the author.)\n3 But more importantly, we tried to talk to you like people. We know a lot of textbooks can sound dry and boring and far\naway, but we wanted to teach you like you're sitting right there in front of us. So we've added stories and analogies that\ncome from our lives and tried to make connections to culture and experiences that you'll relate to. Because, you know,\nwe're people, too. And isn't that why you're going into the Social Sciences? Because you dig people? So much so that\nyou want to study them?\nSo to help you reach your goals, we're going to give you a window into the world of good writing. Here's the actual view\nfrom my office window as I write this. Can you believe those mountains? We're going to be your guides as we climb the\nproverbial mountains of good writing to get the skills and knowledge you need to succeed as writers (cue song from The\nSound of Music). We hope you'll do like our motto here at Brigham Young University:\nEnter to Learn, Go Forth to Serve\nWe promise that if you'll work hard in this course, your efforts will pay off. You'll emerge from this journey stronger and\nwith a broader vision of how you can influence the world as a better writer, a better social scientist, and a better person.\nSincerely,\nCristie Cowles Charles, Editor\nCheck Out the Tech\nHere's some of the cool tech you'll encounter in this book. Check it out so that you know what to do when you see these\nthings later.\nEmbedded Videos\nVideos are embedded into the text so you can just click on them inside the textbook and watch them there with no ads.\nDon't worry, these are simply fancy links that make it so the creators of the videos still get to count your click for their\nstatistics. Here's a cool three-minute video about why these young men from inner-city Chicago choose to write. Try\nwatching it by clicking directly on it.\nNote: If you ever want to watch a video outside of the textbook itself, look at the bottom right corner and you'll see a link\nfor Vimeo or YouTube that you can click on. Or the video's URL will also be listed directly under the video.\n4 https://vimeo.com/137388474\nEmbedded Websites\nWhen we want you to go to a particular website, we'll always provide the actual URL address, but even better, we'll often\nput it in an iframe, which is a fancy embedded link. This is just like going to the actual website--you can access\neverything the same way you would normally--but you don't have to leave the textbook to do it. So convenient!\nHere's an iframe that connects to the Purdue Online Writing Lab OWL. The good people at Purdue University have spent\nyears compiling resources for college writers, so you can find answers to almost every question you have such as How\ndo headings work in APA format? or What are some good transition words? Scroll down and try browsing throught the\nsections or searching for a topic.\n5 Welcome to the Purdue Online\nWriting Lab\nWelcome to the Purdue OWL\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/purdue_owl.html\nHint: I always ask my students to bookmark this Purdue OWL page that lists good transitions words by type--it always\ncomes in handy. This is also an example of a hyperlink that's just embedded in the text as a resource but isn't turned\ninto a full-on iframe that you can access inside the textbook. Here's the actual URL:\nhttps://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/transitions_and_transitional_devices/transitional_devices.html.\nChapter Questions\nThroughout the book there are questions that ask you to think about what you're reading or ask you to try out some of\nthe writing techniques we're teaching. Your teacher might assign you to do these for credit, but even if not, they'll still be\nvaluable for your learning.\nAverage Reading Time\nAt the beginning of every chapter we've included the average time it takes readers to read the whole chapter. This\nincludes the time it takes to watch videos but doesn't include any writing activities, discussion questions, or quizzes.\nStudents find this really helps them plan their time.\nEnd-of Chapter Surveys\nHow often do you get to tell textbook authors what you think? Now you can. And we can take it--we really want to know\nwhat you liked and didn't like or what was confusing or helpful. (Hey, if we talk the talk of seeking feedback, we should\nwalk the walk, right?)\nSo please be sure to take the surveys at the end of each chapter so we can improve our own writing. It's for posterity!\n6 Spoiler Alerts\nPreviewing a book is a good way to get a feel for it and anticipate what's coming. In the olden days, we'd literally pick up\nour textbooks from the campus bookstore and physically leaf through the pages in anticipation, but that's not possible\nonline. So here are some spoiler alerts so you'll know what's coming in the rest of this book. We've divided this textbook\ninto three main units: Writing Tools, Academic Audiences, and General Audiences.\nUNIT 1: WRITING TOOLS\nIn Unit 1: Writing Tools, you'll get help understanding how writing in the Social Sciences differs from other types of\nwriting and learn the tools you need to get your message across.\nIn Chapter 1 Writing in the Social Sciences, we'll talk about how writing specifically in the social sciences represents a\ndiscourse community whose style, forms, and vocabulary you'll need to learn. Chapter 2 Writing Tools deals with the\nrhetorical strategies you learned in your first-year writing class and how we'll build on those strategies in this course.\nChapter 3 Writing Processes addresses the steps involved in creating a piece of writing and how best to approach a\nwriting assignment. Chapter 4 Grammar & Mechanics will review the most important grammar, spelling, and\npunctuation concepts that will convince your audience that you know what you're talking about. In Chapter 5 Style, we'll\nwill delve into the nuances of language that can take your writing from good to great. And finally, in Chapter 6 Design,\nyou'll learn about visual design and how to use images, fonts, color, and other visual elements to best get your message\nacross.\nUNIT 2: ACADEMIC AUDIENCES\nIn Unit 2: Academic Audiences, we'll focus on what writing is like in scholarly settings and how to create some of the\nmost useful types of documents.\nIn Chapter 7 Writing for Academic Audiences, we'll discuss how best to write formally for an academic audience and\nwhat is valued in an academic discourse community. Chapter 8 Finding and Evaluating Sources will help you see how\nresearch and evidence are the main currencies of academia and will teach you how to find and analyze sources using\nonline databases and other tools. Chapter 9 Discussing and Citing Sources deals with the best ways to talk about your\nsources (summary, paraphrase, and quotation) and how to give credit to others' work (using APA Format)--an essential\nskill that can also keep you out of trouble. In Chapter 10 What Is a Literature Review?, you'll learn the definition of a\nliterature review, how it differs from a typical research paper, and how literature reviews are used in the social sciences.\nChapter 11 How to Plan a Literature Review will go through the first steps for writing a literature review: taking good\nnotes, structuring, and outlining. Chapter 12 How to Write a Literature Review follows with the final steps for creating a\nliterature review: drafting, writing an abstract, and revising. And finally, Chapter 13 Proposals will cover the genre of the\nproposal and the best ways to formally ask for anything--especially money for research and other projects.\nUNIT 3: GENERAL AUDIENCES\nThe final unit, Unit 3: General Audiences, will deal with how to write for less academic, more general audiences and will\nalso cover different types of public writing.\nTo that end, Chapter 14 Writing for General Audiences will cover strategies for getting your message across to a\ngeneral audience and explain how that differs from academic writing. Chapter 15 Job and Graduate School\nApplications will delve into some specific genres for applying for jobs (such as resumes, cover letters, and online\nprofiles) and graduate schools (CVs and personal statements). In Chapter 16 Public Texts, you'll learn about other\ntypical genres for general audiences such as strategies for writing effective memos, emails, social media posts, blog\nposts, infographics, and opinion editorials. And finally, Chapter 17 Presentations will take you through the steps to\ncreating a killer presentation--whether it be a traditional oral presentation or a poster presentation.\n7 We believe this (hopefully not boring) textbook will give you the skills you need to succeed in your future at the\nuniversity, in your career, and in life.\nCristie Cowles Charles\nBrigham Young University\nCristie Cowles Charles teaches writing and literature courses at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.

Photo by joelogon on flickr\nHere you are in a class about Writing in the Social Sciences. Are you wondering what you're doing here? What's the\npoint of this class? Is it just another hoop to jump through before graduating? Didn't you already take a writing class as\na freshman? Haven't you already learned how to write papers in your other classes? Isn't that good enough?\nMy answer to that is, sure. It's good enough if you're okay with just being okay. If your favorite emoji is the \"meh\" emoji;\nif you want to spend your whole life jumping through hoops rather than calling the shots; if you never want to get a raise\nor win friends and influence people. Or if you identify with this baby (see awesome photo):\n18 Is this your Writing Spirit Baby? Photo by greychr on flickr\nBut wouldn't it be amazing if your words could actually change people's minds? (Like your boss's mind about that\nraise?) What about changing people's lives? What if you could not only find answers to real-life problems but also share\nyour work with others so they make a difference in the world? Or what if you just want to express yourself better to that\ncute student across the room? Or what if you want to convince your city to move a walking path that juts into your\nproperty because you want to install a fence and you don't have the tools or permission to move it? (This may or may\nnot be based on a real life example from my backyard.) All of these things and more can be yours if you learn how to up\nyour game as a communicator. And that takes practice\u2014thus, this class.\n19 Secret: Even babies know how important communication is. Photo by Andrew Bardwell on flickr\nLet me tell you a secret: you will spend most of your life communicating. Even those of you who chose your college\nmajor thinking that you wouldn't have to write a lot (geography, anyone?) will spend most of your work life\ncommunicating\u2014reading, speaking, and writing. Trust me; you might not believe it now, but go talk to someone who has\nthe job you want someday, and you'll find out just how much of their work life involves communication. (Spoiler alert: it's\na lot.)\nNot only that, but you'll probably spend much of your personal life communicating, too. What's that, you say? You plan\nto spend most of your personal life sitting on your couch at home in front of a screen and never seeing any people?\n20 Ah, Cat Memes! They're communication, too. Photo by Meme Binge on flickr\nWell, I have news for you: you still can't avoid communication. In fact, everything on that screen involves some form of\ncommunication\u2014that movie was written and produced by people for people. That video game, too. Even that cat meme\nyou're chuckling at was created by a person to make an impact. And the minute you click \"share,\" presto! You're\ncommunicating right back. You can't help it. Because you're human (I'm assuming you're human), and that's what\nhumans do. In fact, you might even say that communication is one of the main things that make us human.\nSo you might as well get good at it, right? And that's where this class comes in. If you'll dig in and work hard, you'll learn\nthose awesome communication skills we were talking about and you'll get lots of good practice communicating so you\ncan make a difference in this world. And then you can be a better human and help other humans be better humans, too.\nAnd isn't that what you came here to college study anyway? Humans? Are you sick of the word \"human\" yet? You'd\nbetter not be if you're going into the social sciences because that's what they're all about.\nI'm Majoring in Humans\nTo be more specific, this book is geared toward anyone majoring or minoring in the social sciences. What are the social\nsciences, you ask? They're just that: sciences (aka fields of study) that deal with social-ness (aka people and how they\nact or interact). Therefore, if your major has to do with people or if you're a person, you're welcome in this class. Here\nare some of the typical examples of social sciences.\n21 Anthropology\nArchaeology\nCommunication Studies\nEconomics\nEducation\nFamily Science\nGeography\nHistory\nLaw\nLinguistics\nPolitical Science\nPsychology\nSociology\nBut don't think we stop there. Many other fields involve the study of people and therefore fit into the social sciences\nwhile also overlapping with other fields such as the hard sciences or business:\nAdvertising\nCommunication Disorders\nExercise Science\nHealth Studies\nMarketing\nNutrition Science\nPublic Administration\nPublic Health\nOne easy test to see if you're part of the social sciences is if your field uses the APA Manual (aka the Publication\nManual of the American Psychological Association ) as its chosen Style Guide. (If you don't know what I'm talking about,\nno worries. We'll talk more about that later in Chapter 8). Not every single social science uses it\u2014some use the\nChicago Manual of Style or other guides\u2014but the majority use APA.\nWelcome to My Parlor\nNow that we've established that you're in the right place, let me tell you what your job is in this class. I know, I know,\nyou're going to say your job is \"to learn.\" And you're not wrong. But more specifically, we want to teach you how to join a\nconversation. And not just any conversation, but the particular conversation in your field. That's what makes this writing\nclass an \"advanced writing\" class as opposed to your first-year writing class. Your first-year writing class was all about\nwriting skills in general, but this one focuses on your field of study and the specific vocabulary, strategies, and tools\nsocial scientists use. To explain this, first, let me set the mood. (Feel free to turn down the lights for this section.)\nWelcome to my parlor:\n22 This is actually George Washington's Parlor. Photo by Matt Briney on Unsplash\nOr if you prefer this modern parlor . . .\n23 This parlor is preferred by hipsters. Photo by Sven Brandsma on Unsplash\nA famous scholar named Kenneth Burke (okay, famous mostly just to writing teacher nerds) came up with an equally\nfamous analogy for academic writing (also mostly writing-teacher famous, but still awesome). Note: It helps if you\nimagine Morgan Freeman's voice reading it. He said,\n\u201cImagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long preceded you, and they\nare engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it\nis about. In fact, the discussion had already begun long before any of them got there, so that no one\npresent is qualified to retrace for you all the steps that had gone before. You listen for a while, until you\ndecide that you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers; you\nanswer him [or her]; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself [or herself] against you, to\neither the embarrassment or gratification of your opponent. However, the discussion is interminable. The\nhour grows late, you must depart. And you do depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress.\u201d \u2014\nKenneth Burke, The Philosophy of Literary Form\nCool party, right? (Okay also mainly cool to writing teachers.) But still, Burke makes a great point. If you've ever been to\na party and wanted to join in on a conversation, you know that you had to first listen to what's going on, catch the lingo,\nnote who's taking which sides, and then finally put in your oar\u2014enter the conversation. This is the way knowledge is\ncreated and shared in the world of social science\u2014by figuring out what's come before, learning about what's going on,\nand then adding your two cents (to which someone else will respond, and the cycle continues). And it's by honing those\nskills that you'll become a master communicator in your field. So how do you \"listen\" to your field's conversation? By\njoining its discourse community.\n24 Can You Say Shibboleth?\nA discourse community means a group with shared knowledge, values, characteristics, genres, language, and/or style.\nYou're already part of many discourse communities. For example, your \"Friends\" on Instagram are a collection of\npeople who have something in common (you), who understand what a post is (the genre or the form writing usually\ntakes), who share a lingo (like LOL, BTW, and TMI), and who enter into conversations (by responding with words,\nemojis, or just cat memes).\nDo you remember the first time you visited a different family\u2014maybe the family of your significant other or your\nroommate or best friend? Did you notice that they talked and acted differently than the family you grew up in? Did they\nhave little nicknames or mannerisms or ways of responding that surprised (or even amused or annoyed) you? Did they\nhave inside jokes that you didn't understand? That's because they've developed a discourse community and you're an\noutsider. Here's hoping things worked out and now you've made it into their inner linguistic circle. But if not, that's okay.\nAt least your life wasn't on the line.\nHere's a great story about a discourse community with wild consequences for outsiders. It's from the Old Testament in\nThe Bible. (Again, try imagining Morgan Freeman's voice\u2014it really helps):\n\u201cAnd the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those\nEphraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an\nEphraimite? If he said, Nay;\nThen said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce\nit right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the\nEphraimites forty and two thousand.\u201d Judges 12:5-6\nWhat? Did you catch that? The Gileadites had a discourse community with a built-in test to see if someone was a\nmember of their group. They knew that people in their community could pronounce the sound \"sh\" in shibboleth, but the\nEphraimites couldn't\u2014it would always come out sounding like \"ssss\" for them. So the Gileadites tested everyone who\ntried to cross the river, and using that one word caught and killed 42,000 Ephraimites! Harsh. And now, to this day, the\nword shibboleth means \"any custom or tradition, usually a choice of phrasing or even a single word, that distinguishes\none group of people from another\" (\"Shibboleth,\" Wikipedia). In other words, this story was so compelling that the word\nshibboleth has come to mean anything that marks you as an outsider of a discourse community.\nSo, I'm not saying that you'll be killed if you don't learn the lingo of your discourse community, but I am saying that\nunderstanding your audience can help you get your voice heard and taken seriously. Your goal in this class is to learn\nhow to become an insider in your field of study so that when you do step into the river and enter the conversation, you\ndon't get your proverbial head chopped off. Here's a quick video that illustrates what happens when someone misreads\nthe situation and uses the language and style of one discourse community (business) in the wrong setting with the\nwrong audience (but still with an awesome accent).\nWhat happens when you use the wrong language for your discourse community.\n25 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/nqHIgzC14v4\nDon't be like these guys. Do your homework and learn what's appropriate\u2014and not\u2014in your field's discourse\ncommunity.\nHow to Listen\nSo how can you discern the characteristics of the discourse community in your particular field? By doing a bunch of\n\"listening\" first. Here are some places you can go to start learning how social scientists talk, write, and respond. The\nmore read and talk to people in your field, the faster you'll catch on and the faster you'll be able to contribute.\nPublications (journals, books, newspapers, websites)\nStyle Guides (APA Manual, Turabian, etc.)\nConferences/Societies\nWebsites\nEmail Listservs\nOnline forums\nConversations\nInterviews\nLinkedIn feeds\nFacebook/Instagram/Twitter\nPinterest\nNow let's get you started finding your field's discourse community.\n26 Discourse Community Activity\nSearch online for 2-3 publications or websites in your particular major/field of study. They can be written for an\nacademic audience, a general audience, or anything in between, but they have to be from your field. Now skim\nthrough the publications and list at least 3 things that stick out to you that they have in common\u2014either in their\nform (genre), look (design), writing style, vocabulary, etc. List those characteristics along with the field you\nlooked up. Voila! You've already started to recognize what distinguishes your discourse community.\nIs There Life After College?\nAll this talk about talk reminds me why we're here in the first place\u2014to become better communicators. So if you need a\nlittle more motivation to bring your A game, listen to this: when employers are asked about the top five attributes they\nwant in new hires coming out of college, they almost universally mention communication skills.\n\u201cIf you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer. . . . Clear writing is a\nsign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand.\nThey can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you\nwant in any candidate. Writing is making a comeback all over our society...Writing is today's currency for\ngood ideas.\u201d\n\u2014Jason Fried, Founder of Basecamp, Author of ReWork\nNot only will this book prepare you to succeed in your remaining college classes, it will also teach you skills necessary\nfor your career and life. So all I can say is sit down, buckle up, and hold on to your hats and glasses because you're in for\na wild ride!\nWhat if I have a question?\nSee this comic.\nSyllabus Activity\nRead your course's Syllabus and email your teacher with any questions you might still have about the course. If\nyou have no questions, then email your teacher a cat meme and/or a compliment about something you like so\nfar about their class.

Do they\nbring back memories of your first-year college writing class? Or maybe of high school English classes?\nYou're embarking on an advanced writing course, but I doubt this is your first encounter with being taught about writing.\nIn fact, I hope you've had many encounters with writing teachers and assignments, and it's important to note that you've\ngot a lot of experience with writing already under your belt. The purpose of this chapter is to lay a basic foundation of\nconcepts about writing (which we'll frame in terms that are usually associated with the study of Rhetoric). Much of what\nyou read in this chapter may sound familiar to you, especially if you took a first-year writing course at BYU and studied\nfrom the textbook commonly assigned in that course.\n29 But if this is your first writing class in college or if the mention of words like rhetoric or audience or genre make your\nheart race a bit and your palms sweat, don't worry! You're not coming at this as a complete novice\u2014you've had lots of\nexperience with the concepts of this chapter already. For instance, deciding whether to ask someone out via text\nmessage or in person, thinking about the best way to approach that roommate who always eats your food, biting your\ntongue in front of the cop who just pulled you over\u2013 in all these situations you're practicing the concepts we'll discuss\nhere because you're making decisions about how to use the available tools to best communicate.\nThe goal of this chapter is to give you some terms and definitions that will tap into both your previous writing instruction\nand your personal experience with communication in general. We'll explore some examples to help connect those ideas\nto real-world situations and, hopefully, to remind you of ways that you've applied these principles yourself. Then, the\nrest of the text will build on that foundation as we focus your attention on specific situations you\u2019ll likely encounter\nworking in the social sciences.\nRecall from FYW\nWhat do you remember learning in your first-year writing course? (Or, if you didn't have a first-year writing\ncourse, think about the last writing course you can remember.) What concepts stood out, what practices did you\nadopt as a result of this course?\n2.2 Fundamental Writing Tools\nLet me share with you one of my fundamental truths about writing: Good writing is about making good choices. What\ndoes that mean? You may have already noticed that this chapter has a different feel from the previous chapter\u2014that\n\"feel\" is something we sometimes call voice (which we'll get to more in a little bit when we talk about style later in this\nsection). My voice as a writer comes from the choices I make that would be different from the choices a different writer\nmight make. You'll notice this throughout this textbook, in fact: Each person who contributes to the book has a different\nvoice because we make different choices in our writing.\nThe best writers have a large tool chest available to them, and they make purposeful and effective choices about which\ntools to use in a given situation. Just as a good carpenter recognizes when a saw is needed versus a plane, a good\nwriter knows when to use an anecdote versus results from an empirical study.\nIn this section we want to review some of the tools we use to persuade, inform, or otherwise communicate with others.\nIn your first-year writing (FYW) class, it's likely that you studied these tools by examining how other people used them\nand then practiced using them yourself in your own writing. In many ways, you\u2019ll engage in similar work in this course,\nbut within the specific context of the social sciences.\nEvidence and Reasoning\nOne of the most important choices we make as writers in this discipline is related to the evidence we use to support our\nclaims and how we connect that Evidence. Many of the texts we read and write in the social sciences try to inform or\npersuade an audience and the kind of evidence we use is critical to that purpose. Strong writers rely on sound thinking,\nlogically connected claims and reasons, and clearly articulated assumptions that support this thinking. (Some of you\nmay have had teachers in the past use the term logos to talk about this kind of reasoning, which is a Greek word. We'll\nstick with the English terms in this book.)\n30 Photo by CDC on Unsplash\nThe role of evidence and reasoning is absolutely fundamental to so much of our communication in the world. Take the\nissue of vaccinating children, which lately has become an intensely debated issue. Those in favor of vaccinations base\ntheir arguments on scientific evidence and principles; their underlying assumption is that the methods of science build\nsolid knowledge that helps us control the world around us (i.e., prevent horrible diseases from infecting people).\nThose opposed to vaccinations (often called \"anti-vaxxers\") use a different kind of logic, attributing causal power, for\ninstance, to correlated events (my grandson was fine before the vaccine but then after was diagnosed with autism);\nthey assume that these coincidences prove causality and that the doctors and big vaccine makers are in cahoots. There\nexists a fundamental disconnect in the way most health care professionals reason about vaccines and the way anti-\nvaxxers do, and that's connected to the underlying assumptions both make about what constitutes knowledge you can\ntrust.\nDiscussion Question\nWhat issues or controversies (like the debates over vaccines) do you see today that include people using\nreasoning and evidence in different ways?\nCharacter\nIn looking at character, we\u2019re focused on the persona we build as communicators\u2013on our credibility as a writer or\nspeaker. (Some of you may be familiar with the Greek term ethos, which is how the Greeks referred to this idea of\ncharacter.) How do we convey a sense of expertise to an audience so they trust what we\u2019re saying? How do we connect\nwith our audience in ways that help us achieve our purpose? Our messages will be more effective if our audience has\n31 reasons to trust us. We build this trust through demonstrating that we\u2019re knowledgeable about a topic, presenting a\nbalanced view of the issue, and sharing personal experiences as appropriate that connect us with our audience.\nDon't make it so you have to wear a hat everywhere. Get your information from good sources. Photo by Allef Vinicius on\nUnsplash\nThis issue of character seems to be more and more important. One student I was working with searched the Internet\nlooking for solutions to an outbreak of acne on her forehead; in an online forum, she read a suggestion to use a Mr.\nClean cleaning pad on the affected skin. The result was a chemical burn on her forehead that was much worse (and\nmore noticeable) than the pimples. Why would this student put her trust in an unknown contributor to an online forum\nrather than a medical expert? I'm guessing she was probably in a hurry and paid a (painful) price for ignoring credibility.\nWhile good readers should work to assess the character of an information source, as writers we can help them and\nourselves out by attending to how to build our character.\nDiscussion Question\nWhere do you go online to find information that you think will be reliable? Why do you think that information is\nreliable or how has this source proven itself to be trustworthy?\n32 Emotion\nJoseph McCarthy (Public Domain)\nEmotions are powerful tools in communicating, and as such should be used carefully. Emotional appeals to an audience\nthrough specific stories and concrete details and specific word choices can evoke the proper feelings in an audience\nand propel them to action. (Again, some of you may be familiar with the term pathos, which the ancient Greeks used to\nrefer to these appeals to emotion.)\nHowever, these appeals to emotion can also be abused to manipulate an audience into wrong or inappropriate thought\nor action. Joseph McCarthy, a senator from Wisconsin in the 1950s, ruined many careers in and out of politics when he\naccused many people of being Communist sympathizers. He played on anxieties felt by many about the spread of this\nideology and the growing power of the USSR, but in the end there was little real evidence to prove either the veracity of\nhis claims or the threat that these alleged sympathizers posed. (In fact, so disgusted was the public with his\nmanipulative tactics that we now have the term McCarthyism to describe making accusations without real evidence.)\nAs a speaker and writer, it\u2019s up to you to ensure that you use rhetorical tools like emotional appeals ethically and\nresponsibly\u2014you don\u2019t want your name becoming associated with dastardly, underhanded deeds!\nDiscussion Question\nEmotion can be a powerful tool in situations where we're trying to convince or persuade others. How have you\nused emotion in the past in your interactions with others? Can you think of a moment when someone used\nemotional appeals to persuade you? In either case, were these appeals to emotion ethical? Why or why not?\n33 Style\nYour writing style is as unique as the way you dress. Photo by Amanda Vick on Unsplash\nFinally, there\u2019s the style of our message, or how we communicate a message\u2013the words and sentences we use. Just as\nmany of us choose to dress a certain way (to reflect our personality perhaps or influence the impression we have on\nothers), we \"dress\" our message in a certain way through our use of language. Remember my note earlier that the\ndifferent authors who contribute to this book make different choices with our language\u2014that gives each of us our style.\n(Case in point: Note that I chose to use a dash in that last sentence, which is not the same choice other writers would\nmake.)\nIt\u2019s important that we adhere to standard English conventions in our spelling and punctuation and sentence structure;\nwriting that\u2019s riddled with errors reflects poorly on the writer. How many flame wars have been started on the Internet\nbecause someone used your instead of you\u2019re or there instead of their? At the same time, we want to hone the power of\nour sentences by using sophisticated techniques that can impact a reader. We can enhance our style by studying the\nbest writers (both in our discipline and outside of it) and taking careful note of how these writers achieve certain effects\nwith the sentences they craft.\nWhile you'll read much more about style later in this text, it's worth noting here that many audiences value concise\nwriting that's not pretentious. This is especially true when we write for general audiences, and it's actually part of what\ninforms our character. As writers we should strive to make even complex ideas as intelligible as possible, and we\nshould attend to word choice and sentence structure as important tools in this goal. A great example of this actually\ncomes from government, where agencies are actually required by law to write plainly and clearly. Look at the two\nsentences below, taken from the government's guidelines for plain language:\nDon't Say Say\n34 These sections describe types of information that would satisfy the These sections tell you how to meet the\napplication requirements of Circular A-110 as it would apply to this requirements of Circular A-110 for this grant\ngrant program. program.\nNote how much more direct the second sentence is, and note the choices that are made to bring about that clarity (such\nas the choice in the second example to focus on the reader's action through using the pronoun \"you\"). Clear, concise\nwriting can be more appealing to audiences and can strengthen their opinion of you as a writer.\n2.3 The Rhetorical Situation\nWho's your audience for your journal? Photo by Jan Kah\u00e1nek on Unsplash\nWhen I was 11 and 12 years old, I was very good at keeping a journal; I wrote nearly every day. When I wrote in that\njournal, I'm not sure I ever expected anyone to read my daily entries, but I did hold on to the journal through the years.\nToday, my children like to read those entries and tease me about them (they are admittedly immature and pretty silly,\nbut then I was a kid, so what do you expect?). I like to complain to them that if I had known that my future children\nwould read it, I either would never have kept a journal or I would have tried to sound more mature in it.\nIf you keep (or have kept) a journal, perhaps you've wondered if anyone else would ever read what you wrote\u2013maybe\nyou've hoped that they wouldn't! It's an odd thing, keeping a journal: I started off many of my entries in that journal with\nthe phrase \"Dear Journal,\" and I wonder today if I really imagined some real audience on the other end of my writing. As I\nconsider the practice of journal writing, I wonder if we ever really write without an audience in mind\u2014even if we really\nthink we're just writing for ourselves, are we ever really unaware that others might read it?\n35 This little trip down memory lane suggests that no writing really occurs in a vacuum. There are always external forces\nacting on us and influencing the choices we make as writers. With the writing tools from the last section in mind, it's\nappropriate now to consider the context in which writing occurs.\nSuppose you\u2019re sitting in class and the professor starts talking about a midterm essay you have to write. Or it\u2019s near the\nend of the semester, you\u2019re running low on funds, and you need to ask Mom for a little extra to help see you through. Or\nyou\u2019ve graduated and your boss wants you to create an informational brochure for new employees to walk them through\nsome common tasks on the job. In each of these cases, and so many others we encounter daily, you find yourself in\nwhat we call a \"rhetorical situation\" where you can put writing skills to work in communicating something meaningful.\nThat situation has become so important to scholars of writing that we've invented several ways of thinking and talking\nabout it. One of the most common ways configures the elements of this situation as a triangle, like the one in the image\nbelow.\nThe Rhetorical Triangle\nGood writers will assess these elements before they commit themselves to written or spoken words. If you think back to\nother writing courses you've taken, you may have talked about something like this, even if you didn't use the same\ntriangle metaphor. (If you took first-year writing here at BYU, you might remember using the acronym GRAPE to learn\nabout these concepts.) The triangle we use in this text implies that these elements are interconnected and inform each\nother. We'll take each one in turn in the sections that follow and consider how they're connected through some\nexamples.\n36 2.4 Purpose\nIf you look at our triangle, you'll note that purpose sits squarely in the middle, surrounded by writer, audience, and\nmessage. Why do you think we situated it in the center like this? My idea is that placing purpose in the center suggests\nits central role in crafting the message; purpose is at the heart of the decisions we make as writers. Lots of students\nassume that we study writing in order to change people\u2019s minds, and that\u2019s certainly one of our purposes in\ncommunicating with each other. But we might also want to inform an audience, or even get them to simply feel\nsomething\u2013although even in these cases, there\u2019s often an implied sense that we want to change our readers\u2019 views or\nfeelings about something.\n37 A man with a purpose: FDR delivers a speech after Pearl Harbor (Public Domain)\nYour purpose is going to shape the choices you make as a writer. If you want to report on the results of a project, you\nmight choose to organize details in a chronological pattern since that will best convey the progress made during the\nproject. But if you\u2019re looking to convince investors to give you some money to develop a new mobile app, you\u2019ll probably\nwant to begin by talking about a common problem you see that your app can fix.\nSometimes we begin writing without really knowing what our purpose is, beyond wanting to finish the piece of writing\nand/or satisfy someone\u2019s demands. That\u2019s okay, really, and you shouldn\u2019t always let an unclear purpose stop you from\nwriting. Have you ever gotten two or three (or more!) pages into an assignment and there, in the last paragraph, you\nrealize that you\u2019ve finally discovered what you want to say? That happens to all of us, and writing is actually a powerful\nway for us to discover what it is we have to say about something. It\u2019s okay if your sense of what you have to say shifts\nas you compose, but take advantage of opportunities to revise your work and have others read it before submitting so\nthat you make sure your finished work has a strong sense of purpose woven throughout the piece.\nDiscussion Question\nThink about your discipline or area of specialty within the social sciences. What are some reasons why people\nin your field write or communicate? What drives people in your field to communicate?\n38 2.5 Writer\nEvery message has an author behind it. When you\u2019re interpreting or analyzing a message you receive from someone\nelse, it\u2019s a no-brainer to think carefully about who the author is. The author\u2019s values and views on the world can\ninfluence the message in important ways that we want to be aware of.\nBut as a student in this writing class, you\u2019re often going to be the writer, and it may seem silly to spend any time thinking\nabout yourself in relation to your message. Nevertheless, as we\u2019ll cover throughout this book, it\u2019s important to consider\nthings like your relationship to an audience and to the topic you're writing about.\nAnalyzing this relationship might lead you to uncover shared values or experiences that you can tap into as part of an\nargument. How does your audience perceive you? Considering this question can help you make choices to build your\ncredibility with an audience so they trust what you\u2019re communicating. Do you have implicit or unexamined biases\ntowards the topic you're writing on? Examining these can help you approach an audience more effectively as you\nrecognize those and acknowledge the ways they color your thinking.\n39 2.6 Audience\nYour message needs to be shaped in consideration of the audience to whom you send it. In fact, considerations of\naudience may be the most important forces shaping a message.\nIf your bank account is empty and you approach your parents for more cash, a sound knowledge of who they are and\nwhat they value will be critical to ensuring the success of your request. Do they respond better to emotionally rich\nrequests that draw on their relationship to you or are they more compelled by logical arguments about the rising costs\nof college life? It\u2019s likely you know your parents well and what will and will not work when it comes to convincing them\nto part with some money. The better you can come to know the audience you\u2019re writing or speaking to in a given\nsituation, the better you can craft your message to them.\nDiscussion Question\nThinking about your discipline or specialty within the social sciences, what kinds of audiences do you imagine\nyou will write to? How might you think about adjusting a message to one of these audiences?\nSometimes you\u2019re going to be writing to an audience you\u2019re unfamiliar with, and this will require you to do some\nimagining or some research. In the situation you\u2019re addressing with your writing, what will your audience care about the\nmost? What do they value that you can tap into to help change their minds? Rather than take guesses at this, many\nwriters will try to get to know an unfamiliar audience better by speaking to them or reading things they write. Even\n40 rudimentary research can give you valuable insights into those you want to communicate with and help you select the\nappropriate tools and approaches in your writing.\nIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s also true that we have to consider unintended audiences for our messages, especially when those\nConsider possible unintended audiences when sending out a public message. Photo by Kaboompics.com\nmessages are going out on a public platform like Twitter. In 2015, a woman employed in public relations sent what she\nthought was a humorous tweet to her 170 followers right before she boarded an international flight to Africa. While in\nflight, her tweet was picked up by a writer for a popular tech blog who retweeted it and posted about it on the blog; by\nthe time this woman landed, she had received tens of thousands of tweets condemning her for what was widely\nperceived as a racist joke. In addition to the public humiliation she and her family faced, she was fired from her job.\nWhether the public shaming this woman experienced was deserved or not, this is an important lesson in carefully\nconsidering audience\u2014intended and unintended.The fact that our words can be shared and transmitted to other\naudiences suggests we need to be careful in our communications when we\u2019re the writer, and perhaps also just a bit\nmore humble and open-minded as\nImage by Wikipedia\nlisteners.\n41 And we may have to consider computers\u2014or at least the algorithms written for them\u2014as part of our audience. For\nexample, let's say you've got a message that you want to promote on a platform like YouTube or Facebook and you want\nit to reach a wide audience. To do so, you'll have to consider how to leverage the algorithms that promote content: How\ncan you get your company's press release to be at the head of users' Facebook newsfeeds? Can you get your video to\nthe front page of YouTube? Figuring this out requires understanding how those platforms make decisions about what's\ngoing to be foremost in users' feeds.\n2.7 Message and Genre\nFor our purposes here, the message is the actual writing that we produce, whatever form it takes. One element of this\nmessage we'll pay attention to is its content. We make choices about content based on our purpose and our audience\u2013\nwill a personal story best move my audience or would statistics do a better job? What about a combination of the two?\nWe might also consider the words and sentence structures that will be most appropriate\u2013can we avoid using technical\njargon, for instance, or will our audience expect that?\nIn addition to thinking about content, we also need to pay attention to the form our message takes. As a student, you've\nprobably become familiar with a set of forms (or genres, which is the word we'll use more): the essay, the research\nreport, the short essay response on an exam, etc. But in the larger world, there are a multitude of genres we could use,\nranging from the opinion editorial to the press release or the political campaign speech. And new technologies are\nconsistently bringing us new genres: Facebook and Instagram posts, tweets, text messages, and so on.\n42 Discussion Question\nWhat kinds of genres have you written in as a student? What about outside of school?\nGood writers carefully consider which genre will be the most appropriate for their purposes and their audience.\nSometimes we don\u2019t get a choice in this area\u2013your boss wants a brochure for new employees or your professor assigns\nyou a research paper. Even if we don\u2019t have a choice, it\u2019s still critical to understand the role that genre plays in our\nwriting.\nScholars in the field of writing studies talk about genres as arising from social situations, and that means our writing is\ninfluenced by the context in which it takes place. Think about the wedding announcements you may have seen on\nInstagram or in your local newspaper and how those came to be. (You can see some from the New York Times or here's\nsome with more local flavor from the Daily Herald.) Imagine the first couple who, way back when, decided to announce\ntheir upcoming wedding in the newspaper so it would reach a larger audience. This hypothetical first couple had to\nmake decisions about what to include and how to phrase those details.\nThrough time, as these unique rhetorical situations recur, a certain set of expectations about the form the message will\ntake begins to solidify. To return to our example, after many couples follow that first, brave couple's lead, expectations\n(or conventions) start to emerge, leading to the recognizable genre of the engagement announcement that we see\ntoday. Certain patterns of organization might emerge as will certain phrases that help meet the needs of the context.\nYou know you're dealing with a formalized genre when you start to see lists with help on how to write in that genre (such\nas this tip sheet from Brides.com for writing up your wedding announcement in the newspaper or this one from Martha\nStewart about announcing your wedding on Instagram).\nAn example of a longer message posted as a series of tweets (credit: @BanburyRUFC)\n43 However, features that we come to expect in a genre aren\u2019t always fixed. For instance, the tweet\u2019s origins as a text\nmessage limited content to 140 characters, which might be enough for brief status updates (the original goal of tweets)\nto a group of friends, but isn't really suitable for conveying more complex ideas. But as Twitter became more widely\nused by corporations and governments, some of them started circumventing the 140-character limit by attaching\nscreenshots of typed press releases. Or you may have also seen some Twitter users use bracketed numbers at the end\nof each tweet in a series to let you know how many individual tweets make up the larger message. The needs of people\nusing Twitter have shaped the way it\u2019s used and have forced the genre itself to adapt; most users can now use 280\ncharacters in their tweets (which still isn\u2019t a lot).\nNot all forms are appropriate for every message and every situation, and a good writer will make careful choices about\nwhich genre to use in any given situation based on what each genre allows for. I\u2019ve heard friends complain about\nInstagram posts with lengthy captions; these complaints suggest that most people see this platform as a way of\nsharing images, and they open up Instagram to see things, not to read stuff. Similarly, we don\u2019t read obituaries\nexpecting to learn about the deceased person\u2019s weaknesses or failings in life; the expectations of this genre are that we\nextol a person\u2019s virtues and accomplishments, even though we know that nobody\u2019s perfect and the obituary\u2019s subject\ncertainly had flaws. An obituary that was brutally honest about its subject would really throw readers for a loop.\nsource: Minnesota Public Radio\nBut even in these cases where writers may have subverted the expectations, they\u2019re showing an awareness of the\ngenre and how it is typically used. One obituary that went viral recently was written by siblings whose mother had\nabandoned them. The beginning of this obituary followed the expected conventions, but it soon takes an unexpected\nturn with statements like \u201cShe will not be missed by [her children]\"\u2013ouch! You might question the appropriateness of\nthese choices (and many have, including the editors who published it), but it\u2019s hard to deny the powerful effect of\nauthors who understand the way a genre is supposed to work and who grab our attention by subverting it.\n44 Discussion Question\nThink about a genre you're familiar with (digital, visual, musical, or print) and consider if you've ever encountered\nan example of that genre that subverted or changed the expectations you have for that genre. Describe what\nwas different about this example\u2014just note a couple of examples\u2014and how you reacted to it. For example, I\nthink of the movie Shrek and how it subverted a lot of the traditional fairy tale tropes, especially in the end when\nthe princess Fiona decides to remain an ogre. I loved that twist because, instead of following the expectation\nthat she (like so many fairy tale heroes) would want to return to \"normal,\" that choice celebrated Fiona\nrecognizing something valuable and desirable in being an ogre.\nThe more you understand about genres (the form a message takes) and how they can be used, the more skilled you\u2019ll\nbe at communicating effectively. It\u2019s important, too, to recognize that each discipline often privileges certain genres for\nthe communication that takes place in that field. To become an expert in a field is to understand those genres and how\nto use them to share knowledge with other members of the field.\n2.8 The Context\nThis idea of the context (the circle around our triangle) is kind of a catch-all for everything else that might influence our\nwriting in a given situation. Part of this context is the social context surrounding writing that we just talked about with\ngenre. (See how all these elements are tightly integrated?) But there are other forces to consider as well.\n45 Something prompts the writing you do, sometimes before you even know what you want to say. For instance, after\nbeing late to class several times thanks to long lines in the campus food court, I feel like something has to change. That\ndesire to see change might come before even knowing what change needs to take place. (The ancient Greeks would\nhave called this desire the Exigence of the situation.)\nThis prompting can be external (your boss asks you to put out a press release) or it could be internal (you want to\nexpress your feelings to that special someone in a Valentine\u2019s Day card). The compulsion might be about something\nreally grand (there\u2019s injustice in the criminal sentencing guidelines and you want to make others aware of that so we can\nmake change) or something mundane (you\u2019re going to be late to the movies so you text a friend to have them save you\na seat). But the point is, some problem or need inspires us to craft some writing that we hope will address that need.\nWe can create a sense of urgency in our writing that not everyone might see (and that we then need to convince them\nof). A politician, for example, might see an emergency worthy of drastic action in the number of homeless people in a\ncity. That sense of emergency might not be shared by others, however, who may see these numbers as not so alarming\nor might see other issues as more urgent. So if that politician wants to see things happen, she will need to convince her\naudience that the numbers of homeless people do, in fact, represent a crisis worthy of her proposed actions. Most\npeople may not pay attention to her collection of ideas and solutions if they don't feel there's a real problem.\nGood writers don\u2019t take for granted that everyone else will see an issue or idea quite as compellingly as the writers do.\nPart of your job as a writer, then, may be to demonstrate the exigence of the moment that compels you to write, to\npersuade your audience that the time for action or change is, indeed, right now.\nWant more discussion about analyzing the rhetorical triangle?

We think of writing as a remedial activity. We think of it the way we think about\nlearning to ride a bike: Once we get the hang of it, we\u2019ve got it covered forever. University students routinely try to \u201cget\nout of\u201d taking first-year writing in part because they think they\u2019ve peaked as writers and there\u2019s nothing more to learn.\nNothing could be further from the truth. Learning to write is an iterative process. You get better at it as you practice,\npractice, practice.\nBut there\u2019s another problem: Not only is writing iterative; it\u2019s complicated. Writing is a social activity mediated by\ntechnology and the needs of writers and readers. Technology, writers, and readers are all complicated dimensions of\nthe rhetorical situation. As you learned in the last chapter, communication is embedded in social worlds of negotiated\nmeaning. So, writing has to respond to this situated but uncertain world.\nIn a very real way we\u2019re never done learning to write.\nAnother way we act as if writing is easy, to our detriment, is that we spend so little time on it. When get writing\nassignments, we put them off, procrastinating the day of our writing till the night before. Once we get words on the page\nand we've checked for errors, we hesitate to rethink them or revise them. So we don't.\nOne last way we assume writing is easy: We don\u2019t think about it at all. Writing expert Richard Lanham once said that\n\u201cAmericans use their language, spoken as well as written, in a chronic absence of mind.\u201d\n50 You could think of a number of ways this statement might be interpreted: We don\u2019t think, we don\u2019t plan, we don\u2019t\nstrategize, we don\u2019t scrutinize, we don\u2019t reflect, we don\u2019t take language seriously. We take it for granted.\nLearn to be a Mindful Writer\nIn this chapter, I invite you to leave these false assumptions behind, break from whatever habits you may have had in\nthe past, and develop a mindful disposition to writing.\nMindfulness guru Thich Nhat Hanh. Photo by Marloes on Flickr\nThe term \"mindfulness\" is trendy. The word might make you think of someone sitting criss-crossed on a yoga mat with a\nlook of vague stillness on their face. Scholars who study Buddhism, like the Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh or\nprofessor of medicine Jon Kabat-Zinn, think of mindfulness as a kind of still presence\u2014a way to be fully present in your\nbody, detecting sensation and feeling in order to calm and redirect the mind. This kind of mindfulness is essential for\nmental health.\nBut there is another way to think of mindfulness. Mindfulness, for me, is the art of being aware of the activity you are\nparticipating in and how you might do it better. This is usually how scholars define metacognition: the process of\nmonitoring and controlling our activity to maximize our efforts. I am suggesting here that mindfulness, as I've defined it,\nhelps us improve our writing tasks because it directs us to monitor and control the process from beginning to end.\nWhen you become a mindful writer, you take control of your own process in order to improve it, refine it. You become a\nphilosopher of your own learning.\nThat sounds mighty grand for a General Education class you might have been hesitant to take. However, mindful writing\nisn\u2019t just an esoteric, abstract academic exercise. Heaven knows you don\u2019t need any more of those, especially as you\n51 approach the last year or two of your undergraduate studies. If you can make metacognition central to your process as\na writer, you will find that writing, though hard, can be managed\u2014and improved. You\u2019ll feel more confident as you start\nto put words on the page. When you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll feel like you learned more about writing and yourself as a writer.\nYou\u2019ll feel more prepared for the next writing task you take on.\n3.2 The Mindful Writing Cycle\nWriting is not just a product but a process. Writers go through a process when they write. They think, they make notes\nin their heads and on scratch paper, they put words on the page/screen, they review those words and make changes.\nThey ask questions and go out looking for answers. If they\u2019re wise, they give their writing to someone else to review so\nthey can see if they\u2019re accomplishing what they set out to do. And then they make more changes.\nTry writing like someone crazy enough to try this dive. Photo by Julian Paul on Unsplash\nProcesses are also (a) idiosyncratic, and (b) socially contingent. By idiosyncratic, I mean that each person has a writing\nprocess that may or may not follow a logical step-by-step pattern. For example, the last time I taught first-year writing, I\nencouraged students in the early stages of writing to \u201clet the madman/madwoman out\u201d by writing quickly and sloppily,\nwithout worrying about where the writing would go or whether it would be any good. This \"mad writer\" method worked\nwell for some students. For others, letting the madman out made no sense if the madman was just going to run amok\nwith no clear aim.\nBy socially contingent, I mean that our writing processes fit the rhetorical situation in which we find ourselves (see\nChapter 2). If I\u2019m tapping out a light-hearted text message to my sister Amanda, I\u2019m not going to think too hard about\nthe quality of what I\u2019m typing. Sometimes one thoughtless draft gets the job done. But if you\u2019re planning to publish\n52 social science research for other social scientists who have high standards for research methods, data evidence, and\nwriting quality, then you\u2019re going to use a thorough writing process, starting with research questions and ending with\nmeticulous proofreading. The social situation in which we write influences our processes.\nFor the rest of this chapter, I will describe a process I\u2019m calling the mindful writing cycle. This cycle isn\u2019t just something I\ncooked up this morning and slapped up in a chart. This cycle is based on significant research into the way people write\nand the way people improve as writers. (Yes, there are people out there who study the activity of writing as a subject\nworthy of study in itself. They\u2019re wild at parties.) The cycle is in part based on the model of self-directed learners\ndeveloped by Susan Ambrose in How Learning Works.\nRemember from the previous section that I\u2019m using the word mindful to refer to the way we monitor and control our\nwriting process in order to improve our chances for social success through writing, no matter what writing situation we\nfind ourselves in. If we use a mindful writing cycle, we'll learn from our writing experience.\nThough I present this cycle in stages, I encourage you to use these activities in whatever way you see fit as you\nbecome the kind of writer you need to be. Your instructor may ask you\u2014nay, assign you\u2014to follow this cycle in specific\nways. The goal is to help you become a more mindful writer.\nHere\u2019s a quick tour of the cycle (Figure 1) before we get into specifics:\nPlan: A mindful writer will take time at the beginning of a writing task to assess the task and set goals. In the planning\nstage, you\u2019ll consider what your audience wants from you as a writer. You\u2019ll collect and study examples of the thing\nyou\u2019re supposed to write. You will decide when you\u2019ll write and how you\u2019ll discipline yourself write.\nPractice: In the practice stage, you come up with ideas, write out a draft using various rhetorical strategies appropriate\nfor your context, and ask for feedback from people whose judgment you trust. I know we often call this stage \u201cdrafting,\u201d\nand, sure, it\u2019s that. But the word practice reminds us that you are iterating\u2014you are beta-testing your ideas before you\nhave to send them out into the world.\nRevise: Revision happens throughout any writing process; you can\u2019t help but make little changes as you go. In the cycle\nof mindful writers, you receive feedback and then you make deliberate, meaningful changes to your work at all levels\n(from the whole argument to the puntuation) to prepare to hand it over to a teacher, editor, or some other audience.\n53 Reflect: To develop your metacognitive abilities as a writer, you\u2019ll need to think carefully about what you\u2019ve learned from\nthe writing process, what you\u2019ll take with you to future writing tasks, and what needs to change. Without this step, you\ncan\u2019t take control of your writing.\nOK, now that we\u2019ve set up the global picture of writing processes, I\u2019m going to go straight for the advice. In the next four\nsections, you'll find suggestions for each step in the cycle of mindful writers. This content can feel a bit list-y, but I've\ndesigned it that way to serve as a reference to help you build your metacognitive abiltities at each stage of the writing\nprocess. Dive in and out of this material as necessary.\n3.3 Plan\nRemember that in the planning stage, we (a) assess the task and (b) set goals.\nAssess the Task\nAny time you set out to solve a problem or complete a task, you want to step back and look at what needs to be done\nand make some plans.\n54 Which one would you want for a bike shelter? It helps to research the possibilities and make a plan before starting a big\nproject. Photo by Kon Karampelas on Unsplash\nOne time my wife asked me to build a shelter in our back yard for our bikes. I'd never built one. So I watched a few\nvideos on YouTube, talked to some neighbors, and went around my block taking pictures of other people's shelters to\ncatch the vision. My planning made the task easier when I finally bought lumber and started hammering it together. As a\nmindful writer, you should take time to plan out your project before sitting down to write.\nRead the assignment carefully. If you\u2019ve been given an assignment sheet, read it. Notice key terms for what you\u2019re\nbeing asked to do (like analyze or argue). If your assignment came with due dates (introduction, first draft), put those\ndates in your phone. If your instructor gave you a rubric or other evaluative criteria, review it.\nRecall what you already know about this kind of writing (prior knowledge). Ask yourself the following questions:\nHow is this assignment like those I\u2019ve completed before?\nHow is it different?\nWhich writing experiences can I draw from for this new assignment?\nAnalyze the genre. This is an important term that you learned from last chapter (yay, prior knowledge!). From the\nperspective of rhetoric, genres are more than just forms or categories of writing (e.g., romance novels). Genres are\nsemi-formal but adaptive text types that respond to a variety of social needs. In the social sciences, we use a variety of\ngenres to make knowledge: genres like literature reviews, research articles, grant proposals, oral presentations, or\nemail queries. To analyze a genre, try these three steps:\n55 1. Gather examples, either from your teacher or from online (from professional sources)\u2014it\u2019s good to have several\nquite different examples to show how genres vary, and it's even useful to have bad examples;\n2. Analyze the rhetorical situation of the genre: Who writes this thing? Who reads it? What kind of problem does it\nsolve? What is its purpose?; and\n3. Analyze the writing strategies you see in the examples: How is this genre organized, usually? What kind of style or\nargument or document design or evidence do I detect across examples?\nAssess your own rhetorical situation.\nWho is my audience?\nWhat do I know about them?\nWhat are their values, assumptions, or expertise as a discourse community (like economists or psychologists)?\nWhat do they want from me?\nHow should I think about them, construct and invent them, as I write?\nWhat is my role as writer?\nWhat do I want my audience to feel, think, or do as a result of reading what I write?\nAnticipate the value of the task.\nWhat am I going to learn from this project?\nWhat skills will it teach me?\nHow will it help me do the stuff I want to do in the future?\nHow will I make personal connections to this writing task so that I won\u2019t be bored or discouraged?\nSet Goals\nDecide what you want your paper to look like. Now that you've reviewed some examples, both good and bad (I hope),\ndescribe the kind of paper you want to write:\n\u201cIn my paper, I want to do X, Y, and Z because my audience . . .\u201d\nSuch goals are called product goals, and they help you anticipate a successful paper.\n56 Writing for just 15 mintues a day can make a significant dent in your paper. Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\nSet goals about when and where you\u2019ll write. Get out your phone, and plan some writing times. Block out time each\nday to write or even just think about your project. Even if it\u2019s for only fifteen minutes. Write every day. Write every day so\nthat when you get stuck, you won\u2019t need to worry as much about a looming due date. Choose your writing spot\ncarefully. Find a quiet, comfy place with few distractions.\nCommit to distraction-free writing. I know we\u2019re crazy about our phones and we can\u2019t live without them. FOMO is real.\nSo are the bad consequences of CPA\u2014continuous partial attention. Commit fully to the writer\u2019s life and shut off your\nphone, close all windows not related to your work, and disable all notifications. Get into deep focus mode, and the\nwriting will be easier.\nReward yourself. If you\u2019ve had a good writing day, go get yourself something sweet or savory. Or go watch an episode\nof that show you\u2019ve been bingeing.\nSet goals to share your work with others. Set a goal to share your work with a class member, a writing tutor (in the\nWriting Center), or a trusted friend or family member. Talk, annoyingly, about your project with anyone who will listen.\n3.4 Practice\nA few years ago, a friend of mine invited me to his wedding reception. In the middle of the meal, he stood up and started\nmaking a speech\u2014standard sappy stuff. A few minutes into it and without warning, he pointed to me and said, \"And now\nI'd like my friend Brian to come up and share a few words about our friendship!\"\n57 Is anything as awkward as an impromptu wedding speech? Photo by Inna Lesyk on Unsplash\nI stood up with icy fear in my veins. My mind folded up on itself like a camp chair. He gave me the microphone and I\nturned and looked at everyone, sitting there picking at cheesecake, and wanted to crawl into the center of the earth. I\nbelched out a few disconnected thoughts and sat down in disgrace.\nAnyway, enough about the worst day of my life. Let's imagine, instead, that I knew ahead of time that my friend would\ncall on me to speak. I followed the advice in the last section and studied the genre of wedding toasts (YouTube, of\ncourse, has good and bad ones). And then, long before the blessed day was near, and because you shouldn't\nprocrastinate a wedding toast, I started building the content of the speech. How should I do it?\n58 You're put in a similar position every time you are assigned to write. But unlike in my speech fiasco, you want to give\nyourself time to generate ideas. Once you've done your planning (assess the task, set goals), you need to generate\ncontent in a process we often call \"prewriting\" or \"invention.\" That's what this section is about. I've called it the practice\nstage because in this stage you can experiement with your content using invention strategies and get feedback\nthrough peer review before completing the project. Again, I've given you a list of strategies and quesitons you can ask\nyourself as a writer.\nInvention Strategies\nSelf-exploration. If you have flexibility on the topic, ask yourself (and answer in writing),\nWhat interests me?\nWhat do I care about?\nWhat\u2019s been on my mind?\nWhat am I curious about?\nWhat do I want to know more about?\nWhat is my \u201cwhat if\u201d?\nWhat do I want to study in grad school?\nWhat do I want to pursue as a career?\nInquiry. Ask questions. If you have a vague sense of a topic, jump on Google and read anything you can find. Consult\nWikipedia. Go to the library and find a book and read it (or at least \"around\" in it). Find key terms or authorities from an\ninformal search. Talk to experts about your topic. Use Google Scholar or academic databases to review expert research\nin social science. Review data from published experiments, surveys, or interviews; maybe you can do your own surveys\nor interviews.\nForm a hypothesis about your topic, like \u201cI think X influences Y, but I\u2019m not sure\u201d or \u201cI think X is the case, but I\u2019m not\nsure\u201d or \u201cI think X would be a solution to Y, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d It\u2019s so important to begin a writing task with questions and\nnot answers; don\u2019t do research merely to support your preconceptions. (In future chapters, you'll learn more about the\nresearch process.)\n59 An unstructured draft of someone's wedding speech\u2014I wish I'd had time to do this. Photo by Lars Plougman on Flickr\nUnstructured drafting. Some invention activities invite you to write without thinking much about where you\u2019re going.\nUnstructured invention activities can help you put ideas into sentences to explore what you\u2019re thinking. Make lists, draw\npictures, make clusters (by writing your topic in the middle of a page and then branching out from there with\nsubtopics/issues). Try freewriting: Just start writing about your topic without stopping, even if you feel like your ideas are\nbad. Don\u2019t stop until your fingers fall off.\nStructured drafting. For those of you less inclined to the free association of unstructured drafting, you can try the\nstructured kind. Use the journalist\u2019s questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Think about your topic in\ncategories: history, consequence, law, authority, value, location, cost, etc.\nOutlining. I know this sounds high school-y, but research shows that it\u2019s effective for early drafting. Additional research\nsuggests, though, that outlining works best if you've brainstormed ideas first. So, then, here's an order for outlining:\n1. Brainstorm by writing a list of concepts or ideas or questions or key terms or topics,\n2. Organize the list into concept clusters related by theme, and then\n3. Make an outline of your paper by mapping out these clusters into a sequence.\nWrite an outline for your project, even if you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll keep it. Anticipate how long each section will be, even if\nyou're not sure. Write the number 1 and then write a key term or phrase about what you\u2019ll do first, and so on. Use\nsubordination\u2014that\u2019s when you tab over for subtopics, like this:\n60 I. Operant conditioning\nA. History: Thorndike, Skinner\nB. Reinforcement and punishment\n1. Positive and negative reinforcement\n2. Positive and negative punishment\nII. Classical conditioning . . .\nOutlining is a helpful way to find what will become the subheads of your paper. If you\u2019re far enough in your inquiry\nprocess to know what you want to talk about, you can outline nearly every paragraph of your paper before you write it.\nI\u2019ve found it useful to outline a text and then write underneath the subcategories the names of sources I\u2019ve found that\nwill fit in that subcategory.\nGenre drafting. From my YouTube research on wedding toasts, I notice that many of them begin with a joke\u2014\nsometimes a wicked-cruel but still funny joke\u2014and then move to nostalgia about friendship, and maybe a little proase at\nthe end. Similarly, you can draft your paper by keeping your target genre in mind as you write, which is a particularly\nuseful exercise when you're working on a big research project.\nGenres are blueprints for social behavior. If you're writing a research project that begins with an introduction laying out\nprevious reserach, then start there. Often in social science writing, there is a \"methods\" section and/or a \"results\"\nsection. Use these sections as guides for your drafting (but make sure the genre you're writing fots your instructor's\nassignment!).\nAudience drafting. Related to genre drafting, audience drafting means only this: Think about your audience as you\nwrite. Remember their concerns, what they know and don\u2019t know, what they need from you to understand what you\u2019re\ntrying to say. If your audience is non-specialist\u2014if, for example, you\u2019re writing about social science research to the\npublic\u2014translate your specialist knowledge into clear, accessible language. Define your terms. Make reader-friendly\nmoves by providing clear transitions. Help them understand why your work is important.\nIgnore sentence-level issues. It\u2019s hard to ignore errors and clumsy sentences as we draft, but I\u2019d urge you to write as\nswiftly as you can at first and ignore sentence-level issues. There\u2019s no use polishing up a draft that you plan to revise\nafter receiving feedback. Turn off the grumpy editor who wants to tell you you don\u2019t know enough, your writing isn\u2019t\nworking, you have to make things perfect. Everyone is entitled to a lousy first draft. (But no professional writer is content\nwith a first draft!)\nWrite every day. I know I\u2019ve already said it in the section on planning, but let me say it again. If you write every day,\neven if it\u2019s for just 15 minutes, you\u2019ll have more material, more ideas, more text to work with.\nPeer Review\nBack to my worthless wedding toast: If I'd had the time to draft a speech before giving it, I would have been wise to give\na beta version to my wife or a trusted friend to see what they thought. I've been saved many times from being less\neffective in my writing by having someone else review it.\nRemember that writing is a social activity, a collaborative work of imagination. Plan to get feedback. Without feedback,\nyou cannot monitor and control your writing process, the primary activity of mindful writing.\nYour peer reviewers play the role of readers for your work. Review helps us become reader-centered writers rather than\nnarcissistic writer-centered ones. It gets us out of our own heads.\n61 Try writing your peer reviewer a letter. (You don't have to use a feather and ink.) Photo by Wallpaper Flare.\nWrite your peer reviewer a letter. As you prepare for peer review, write a \u201cDear Reader\u201d letter. Doesn\u2019t have to be long.\nAt the top of your draft, write \u201cDear Reader,\u201d and then explain what you\u2019re trying to do and why you\u2019re trying to do it.\nDescribe your imagined audience and their needs. Assess the draft by describing what makes it strong and where you\nthink it\u2019s weak. Maybe give them specific tasks as readers: \u201cI\u2019m concerned that on p. X I lose the thread of my\nargument,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d like you to look for places that could use more support\u201d or \u201cPlease ignore the third section; I\u2019m still\nworking on getting it right\u201d or \u201cPlease tell me where you feel most interested/bored with the paper.\u201d\nMany times getting a peer review involves giving one in return. As a peer reviewer, you\u2019ll want to follow whatever\nprotocol your instructor gives you. If you don\u2019t receive specific instructions for peer review, consider doing some of the\nfollowing:\nBe positive. Give the writer praise for the things you think he/she did well, and give him/her specific praise (with page\nnumbers) describing the strengths you see in the paper.\nUse shared criteria. If your instructor gave you a rubric, use its language to describe what you see in the paper. Use\nkey terms (like argument, organization, evidence).\nBe specific. Avoid vague \u201cgood job\u201d or \u201cit could be improved\u201d kind of talk. Be specific about the paper\u2019s strengths and\nweaknesses.\nStay focused on the macro. It\u2019s easy as a reviewer to get caught up in micro (sentence-level) issues, like mistakes.\nIgnore them, assuming that the writer will proofread before publishing. Focus on the rhetorical situation: the genre,\naudience, and purpose. Is the purpose clear? Is the genre appropriate for the situation? What is the overall feel of the\npaper?\n62 Ask questions. Sometimes the best feedback is a good question written in the margins: \u201cWhy is this here?\u201d or \u201cWhere is\nthe evidence of what you\u2019ve just said?\u201d\nRespond as a reader. Trust your instincts. You can tell things about the paper based on your own experience reading it.\nWhere did you disengage, get lost or confused, raise an eyebrow in skepticism? Are you convinced by the argument?\nDid the writer do something powerful with language? Tell them.\n3.5 Revise\nNow that you've drafted an essay and received feedback, you can revise\u2014the third stage of our mindful writing cycle.\nSince writing is hard, our natural inclination is to do less of it. When I sit down to write, I find myself shuffling papers\naround my desk or looking for something to eat or leaning back in my chair to look out the window. Sometimes I play\nPac-Man or online 8-Ball. That\u2019s when I know I\u2019m in full writing-avoidance mode.\nNovice writers struggle with these avoidance feelings once they have a draft written. Research shows that novice\nwriters revise very little of their drafts, making mostly cosmetic changes while proofreading. The more successful writers\nare thinking about their genre, audience, and purpose in the revision process. Moving commas around will come later.\nRevision is the process of re-seeing your work in an effort to make it as strong and effective as possible. And yes, it can\nbe painful as heck. Surely it will be less painful if you\u2019ve given yourself time to revise and if you\u2019re writing every day.\n(Got the message yet? Write every day! Think of yourself as a writer. It's what you do.)\n63 There's just no way to rock a hospital gown. Be okay with feeling vulnerable. Photo by National Cancer Institute on\nUnsplash\nRevision is a mindset. When you give your writing to someone else, you make yourself vulnerable, like that moment\nwhen the doctor comes in and you\u2019re wearing that little sheet that\u2019s open in the back, feeling like a weirdo and waiting\nfor the next embarrassing thing to happen. If you decide to take on a mindful learner disposition as a writer, you\u2019ll tell\nyourself the profound but often unspoken truth that All writers have more to learn. Even you.\nIn that sense, you won\u2019t feel like your writing is an embarrassment but a moment to explore your own thinking while\nyou\u2019re saying something important. When you receive feedback, listen attentively. Don\u2019t try to defend what you\u2019ve\nwritten; everyone knows it\u2019s a draft and you\u2019re entitled to write poorly in a draft. Ask good questions and take notes. Let\nthe peer review process instruct and refine you.\nWith feedback in hand, you\u2019re ready to re-see your work. The mindful writer now monitors and controls the process with\n\u201cuser\u201d (i.e., audience) perspective. As you review the feedback and your draft, start devising a revision plan. Your\nrevision plan will be composed of your own sense of the draft and the feedback you received.\nBecause writing processes are idiosyncratic, you\u2019ll find your own path through revision. Here are some questions you\nmight want to ask yourself as you revise:\n64 How can I make this text more aligned with the required genre?\nHow can I help my audience get the information they need?\nHow can I make more creative, innovative decisions that will engage the audience?\nWhere do I risk offending or boring my audience?\nHow can I make my purpose more clear?\nConsidering my audience\u2019s specialized social science knowledge, what do I need to do to support the argument I\u2019m\nmaking?\nHow could I more effectively organize this draft with subheads or topic sentences?\nHow will I revise my paragraphs to make them more focused on a single idea?\nWhere in the draft do I feel most excited about the writing?\nWhere in the draft do I feel like I\u2019m confusing or I\u2019m B.S.ing?\nWhere can I add more style\u2014examples, metaphors, humor, a clever turn of phrase?\nHow have I established my own credibility?\nOnce again, stay focused at first on getting the Big Picture in place before you start revising sentences for style or error.\nLearn to trust your instincts. Sometimes as we read our work carefully, if we read it carefully, we have these\nimpressions, a \u201cfelt sense,\u201d of how the writing is going. Listen to what your senses are telling you. Imagine a fellow\nsocial scientist (or whoever your audience is) reading your text. Read your text out loud to get some distance between\nyou and it, to hear it in a new way.\nThe Big Revision Checklist\nWhen you have a draft in good shape, you may want to look at The Big Revision Checklist (Google document) as you\nproofread and polish. Just keep in mind that this list is incredibly thorough, so focus on the areas that you need the\nmost.\nYou want your revisions to be purposeful. You want to be able to explain to someone how your revisions improve your\ntext. That\u2019s the goal: deliberate, purposeful changes to a text to make it more rhetorically powerful.\n3.6 Reflect\nI\u2019ve been trying to convince you in this chapter that writing is more than just doing a task. Mindful writing means\ndeveloping new powers, dispositions, and habits\u2014a new, more aware and deliberate writing Self, committed to\nimprovement. When we write, we project an identity to our audiences; by reflecting, we construct a learning identity for\nourselves.\n65 Research has demonstrated that reflective writing can help people overcome post-traumatic stress disorder, tragedy,\nanxiety, depression, racial prejudice, academic failures, and other ailments. In a more modest way, reflective writing can\nhelp us think through what we've accomplished when we finish tasks and how we're a different, wiser person as a result\nof it.\nAfter you turn in a final draft, you can build a healthy, mindful writerly identity by spending a little time reflecting on what\nyou've learned in the process. Ideally, your instructor will require you to do some of this reflection\u2014either in an informal\nwriting assignment or in class discussion\u2014so you can make this identity construction a social experience.\nI know it sounds corny, but reflection can make you a better person. When you look back at something you\u2019ve\naccomplished with something more deliberate and mindful than relief, you develop dispositions for writing success in\nthe future.\nSo: How should you reflect? You can start by answering the following questions:\nLooking Back, Measuring Progress\nHow did completing this writing task help me achieve outcomes A, B, C for this course?\nHow do I feel about my final draft?\nWhat did I do well? What would I revise if I had more time?\nWhat did I intend to do? What did I actually do?\nWhat did I learn about myself as a writer?\nWhat can I see in the drafts as evidence of my learning? Where specifically in the drafts?\nWhat do I wish I\u2019d learned but didn\u2019t?\nWhat writing strategies did I use to complete this paper? How well did they work for me?\nWhat rhetorical strategies did I use in this writing task, and why (genre, audience, purpose)?\nLooking Forward, Making Connections\nWhat will I need to change about my strategies in the future?\nWhen do I think I\u2019ll write a paper like this again?\nWhich writing strategies will I use in future writing tasks?\nWhich rhetorical strategies will I use in future writing tasks?\nHow will completing this writing task have helped me live my everyday life?\n66 Notice how these questions invite you to think about your completed task in a variety of ways related to the course, your\nassessment of the final product, your perception of your own growth, and your sense of what needs to change in the\nfuture.\nUse your newfound Reflection Powers to look backward and forward at the same time. Photo by Laurenz Kleinheider on\nUnsplash\nAnd now I hope you\u2019re seeing how the steps in the cycle for mindful writers are connected. There\u2019s always another\nwriting task on the horizon. These questions prepare you to move forward by looking backward. When you start a new\ntask, you start with the dispositions, experiences, and knowledge you already have; there\u2019s no shortcut to becoming the\nwriter you want to become. But after each task, you can consolidate your new powers to project yourself into the next\nwriting task, having become just a little bit better than you were before.\n3.7 Collaborative Writing\nWe've reviewed the mindful writing process and its stages. In this last section, we're going to talk about one more\nimportant social aspect of the writing process that every social science student should know: collaborative writing.\nIn my experience, students underestimate the amount of time they will spend as professionals\u2014no matter the\nprofession\u2014working on writing tasks with others. In a 2015 study on writing in the workplace, University of Wisconsin\nliteracy expert Deborah Brandt discovered that most workplace writing is co-authored, as is most published social\nscience scholarship. Does that surprise you? Considering some of your previous experiences with collaborative writing,\nit might do more than surprise you\u2014it might dismay you.\n67 A Common Sentiment about Group Writing. Photo on Creative Commons.\nWhy Group Work Fails to Spark Joy\nI don't want to start on a negative note here, but let's acknowledge that not everyone has a good experience working on\nprojects with others.\nSometimes we just don't get along. A common group anguish is with the freeloader, the group member who shows up to\nmaybe one meeting, disappears, won't respond to emails or texts, maybe shows up on the day of the group\npresentation to stumble through, and then takes credit for the final project. We all know this person. This person is on\nthe Naughty List. Don't be that person.\nDon't be the controller, either. That's the person who, from the beginning, and perhaps because this person is anxious\nthe rest of you won't pull your load, takes over the whole project and starts calling the shots. There's also the pleaser,\nwho just wants to do what everyone else wants to do and has no original ideas or suppresses his or her own valuable\nalternative ideas.\nMuch like what Leo Tolstoy says about families in the first line of the novel Anna Karenina, there are many ways\nunhappy groups are unhappy. Who can blame students for wanting to avoid them?\nIn spite of the somewhat popular but vague negative feeling about group projects, my guess is that many of you have\nhad positive experiences working in groups. And it turns out that all the research on collaborative learning has revealed\nthat students learn significantly from group projects. The Association of American Colleges and Universities labels\ncollaborative work a \"high-impact practice\" because of what students get from it. When you have to work together,\nespecially with folks you wouldn't normally associate with, you have to listen to others, learn from them, and test your\nideas against theirs, which can be a refining process. You'll find out that\u2014imagine!\u2014not everyone thinks the way you\ndo, and we're better off when we combine our ideas with the ideas of others.\nWhat do you do if you've been assigned a group writing project? How do you ensure that the end product is something\nyou can be proud of and that the process you take to get there is productive?\n68 Your writing group could be this happy if you follow the advice in this chapter. Photo by Jud Mackrill on Unsplash\nGetting Started\nGet to know each other. If your instructor has assigned you a group and you don't know the other members well, take\nsome time to get to know one another. Cover the standard ground about where you're from, what you're into, and what\nyou want to do later in life.\nSet up an easy communication system. Swap contact information. Group text messages work best for most people.\nTalk about how you're going to use a synchronous online system for collaboration. Google Docs works so much better\nthan trying to pass Word documents back and forth because you can edit documents simultaneously and the changes\nare automatically saved. Review your schedules with each other so you'll know when you might be able to meet.\nDiscuss past group work. Share with each other an experience or two about both successful and unsuccessful\ncollaborative projects you've been in before. Talk specifically about what made a project work, or not. Share your\nconcerns, if you have any, about group work. Talk about what you hope to get out of this project.\n69 A Group Contract can actually help set expectations for your project. Photo by Cytonn Photography on Unsplash\nDraft a Group Contract. If your group is up for it, you might want to draft a \"Group Contract\" that each person agrees to,\nwith statements like, \"I will come to all our group meetings and stay on task,\" \"I will be timely in my communication with\nmembers of my group,\" \"If I miss a meeting or class period, I will contact all my group members and make up for what\nI've missed,\" and so on.\nAssess the task and set goals. Review together the assignment you've been given. Review whatever assignment\nsheets, due dates, or rubrics you've received. Break down the task into parts: What needs to happen first, second,\nthird? Decide on a timeline for when you want to have pieces of the project completed.\nAssign group roles. The most productive groups I've been in have a very clear distribution of labor. Each of us knows\nwhat our assignment is. Everyone has a task. The easiest way to divide up a group writing task is to assign each\nsegment of the genre you're writing (introduction, literature review, etc.). However, that method might lead to a\nfragmented text. Instead, you may want to consider assigning roles related to project management: timekeeper,\nnotetaker, editor, communication director, reviewer, facilitator, etc.\nGet to Work\nStay in touch. I know that some of you would rather start on a task and be left alone for a while, but in my experience,\nthe stronger groups overshare with each other. I mean that they talk frequently, even if only for a few moments on a\ngroup text about this or that issue. It's easier to solve problems early when the entire group is open to this kind of self-\ncorrecting chatter. It would be even better if you could meet together face to face with open laptops and work together\nat the same time, talking and then writing and then talking and then writing.\n70 Value everyone's input and resolve differences amicably. Photo by Mark Adrian on Unsplash\nCompromise. I've had more than one experience writing in groups when another group member has cut some of my\nmaterial from the final product. Though I've never felt that the cut material was absolutely essential to the project, I have\nfelt that my work was undervalued or dismissed or misunderstood. In those instances, I've had to move forward with the\nnew changes knowing that each member will have to compromise material for the good of the project. If you feel like\npart of what you've produced is essential to the project, discuss the issue with all your group members.\nResolve differences. Sometimes groups don't get along. If so, don't assume your group is dysfunctional. It's a people\nthing to have static in close quarters. Some of these problems will be alleviated significantly with the kind of work I\nrecommended in the last section. Before you go to the teacher, try to work out the differences together\u2014all of you\ntogether (i.e., try to keep from pairing off in disagreement). Listen carefully to someone else's concerns. If things get\nunmanageable, visit with your instructor.\nWrite. Just throwing in my mantra again: Write, and write as much as possible. As a group member, don't wait till right\nbefore due dates to get things done. Get your work finished so you can then turn your attention to the work of others in\nthe group. Invite other group members to read your work and offer feedback.\nAll-in on finishing touches. Though you may select someone to be the final editor or proofreader, plan for each group\nmember to review the final product before turning it in. You want every member to sign off on the final project so the\nresponsibility is shared.\n71 As part of your afterparty, take time to reflect on how it went. Photo by Maxime Bhm on Unsplash\nThe Afterparty\nReflect. Once you've turned in your project, take a moment and think about what you've learned\u2014about writing, about\nyourself as a writer, about group projects, about the topic you wrote about. What went well? If you could go back to the\nbeginning, what would you change about the way your group handled the project? What did you learn from the group\nproject that you likely would not have learned working on your own? What will you do differently when you need to work\nin a group again?\nAssess. With any luck, your instructor will ask each group member to fill out a peer evaluation form to describe and\nassess the various efforts of the other group members. If you're not sure your instructor has set up a system like this, go\nask. On the better peer evaluation forms I've seen, the instructor asks you to rate both the quantity and quality of each\ngroup member. Final scores might depend on the way you evaluate your peers. It's hard sometimes to make such\njudgments on people you've worked closely with. But without this accountability, some people will do more work than\nothers.\nIn conclusion, I hope you can have more positive experiences working on collaborative writing tasks. Team projects and\ncollaborative writing are central to the work of many situations you'll find yourself in at college and in your career. If you\ncan learn to work effectively with groups, you'll have great success, no matter what you do.\n******\nAnd if you take only one thing away from this entire chapter, I hope I've at least convinced you to become a mindful\nwriter who thinks not only about what you write but how you write\u2014so that the next time you face a writing task, you're\neven more competent and confident than before.\n72 Brian Jackson\nBrian Jackson is from the mean streets of Kearns, Utah.

Haupt & Brittany Passmore\nLearning Outcomes\nIn this chapter you'll learn principles of grammar, spelling, and punctuation that will help you correctly and\neloquently get your message across.\nPrecise grammar and mechanics will convince your readers that you belong in their discourse community\nand that they should listen to you.\n4.1 Grammar Principles\nWelcome to the grammar chapter! This information is designed to help you in several ways. First, you may have had\nlingering questions during your high school and college education about where to insert punctuation or how to make\nsentences better constructed and less awkward. We hope that this information will help you fill in any missing gaps so\nyou can write even more effectively throughout your life.\nSecond, in today\u2019s world, we \u201cmeet\u201d many people through our writing before we are formally introduced in person. This\nwriting (via email or text, for example) may create a \u201cfirst impression\u201d and influence their expectations about our level of\nprofessionalism. Good composition and an understanding of grammar can make a positive impression and get\nimportant things done.\nFinally, we are writing about an important subject matter: people. The world needs the information we can offer. We are\nmore likely to be able to spread that message if we can convey it clearly. In addition, we may be able to publish it more\n75 widely or be seen as more credible if our writing is engaging, authentic, interesting, and well-edited. To accomplish good\nstyle, knowing the fundamentals is important.\nAs you proceed through each section, take time to read the information slowly and carefully. Make note of the examples\nand the ways they demonstrate the principle being discussed. Note sections for review that are new to you or where you\nmight need more practice.\nThis grammar instruction includes three major sections to share principles of\n1. Structure\n2. Power, and\n3. Polish.\nStructure represents the building block principles that help you understand the organization of sentences and teaches\nways to add punctuation to keep your meaning clear to the reader. The Power section contains rules that can help your\nwriting gain more convincing power by deliberately managing the placement of words and phrases. Finally, the Polish\nsection discusses principles to help you apply polishing touches that will help your writing go from good to great.\nNote: The rest of this chapter is contained in Google Documents that you access by clicking on the links below. This\nmakes it easier to get to the specific sections you're looking for.\nUNIT 1: STRUCTURE\nRule #1. Separate and Set Off Main Clauses Correctly\n1A. Choosing punctuation to fit your sentence.\n1B.

Why Does It Matter?\nOn the first day of class, I ask my students what good writing is. Once a student called out, \u201cNot boring!\u201d I appreciated\nthe bluntness because it\u2019s true: good writing is interesting\u2014or to use a less boring word\u2014good writing is vivacious.\nThis chapter will help you improve your writing style. What is style and why should you care about it? Style is the sum of\na writer\u2019s choices in vocabulary, sentence length, sentence structure, and more. Developing strong style turns a\nsufficient writer into a superb one. I love teaching style because most of my students are sufficient writers when I meet\nthem. They already know how to find information and craft an argument (substance), they can organize their thoughts\n(structure), but the wording itself (style) is often thick and clunky. If you think that sounds like you\u2014no worries! Your\nwriting should be thick and clunky\u2014in the first draft, anyway. Style is revision. Just as mastering style comes later in our\nwriting education, it comes later in a paper\u2019s progress.\nBefore we talk about how to apply that high-gloss finish to your masterpiece, here\u2019s a bonus reason to love style\u2014I bet\nyou\u2019re majoring in the social sciences because you want to help people. In your classes you\u2019ve studied how to solve\nproblems like preventing teen suicide, improving parenting skills, and reducing athletic injuries. Maybe you\u2019ve wished\nthese teens, parents, or athletes could learn what you have. Unfortunately though, these people aren\u2019t likely to read\n79 textbooks or academic journal articles because they\u2019re . . . not exactly not boring. How can you get these solutions into\nthe hands of the people who need them? The answer is style. A scientist who can transform stacks of dense research\ninto a concoction as clear as oxygen and as gripping as a mystery novel can change the course of history. My proof?\nWe\u2019ll meet her at the end of this chapter.\n5.2 How to Use This Chapter\nThis note is more for your instructor than for you, but reading this chapter in one sitting or covering the material in one\nclass period would be a mistake. First, style is a broad concept that concerns everything you are writing this semester.\nSecond, this chapter requires the mastery of skills, not just knowledge. The exercises ask you to rewrite sentences, and\nsometimes paragraphs, so budget your time accordingly.\nThis chapter will focus on two principles of style, clarity and vivacity, and several strategies to achieve each. One way to\ndivide the material is to teach clarity early in the semester or during lessons about writing for an academic audience and\nto teach vivacity later in the semester or during lessons about writing for a general audience.\n5.3 Clarity\nAn old hidden picture puzzle--can you find the silhouettes of the rulers of Europe? (Public Domain)\nLately I've enjoyed hidden picture puzzles. At first I thought they would be child's play\u2014I mean, I've known what a\nbanana looks like for some time now. But many are challenging (at least for a word nerd with no spatial skills). As I\nplayed, I realized the three qualities that make a hidden picture puzzle hard to crack (which is good) also make a piece\n80 of writing hard to read (which is bad). A hidden picture disrupts clarity for the amusement of the viewer, but as writers,\nwe don't want our meaning to be hidden. We want to give our readers a clear picture.\nConcision\nSo what ingredients create a tough hidden picture, and conversely, what strategies create clear writing? First, the\npuzzle requires you to find about ten objects, but the picture is a complete junk heap\u2014it might depict fifty objects or\nmore. All the clutter makes it difficult to spot the object you need. This relates to the first component of clarity: concision.\nUnlike a hidden picture puzzle, we don't want unneeded or wordy material to confuse, distract, or slow down the reader.\nCoherence\nSecond, the picture puts objects where you don't expect them to be. If I'm looking for a shoe, I may instinctively look at\nthe ground first because that's where my shoes usually are. Of course, the picture is not real life and tricks me by\ndangling the shoe from a chandelier. Can't say I've ever put my shoes there. By contrast, we want ideas to be where\nreaders expect them. We want coherence, meaning logical order. For example, research articles often use the IMRAD\nformat (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion). I suppose scientists could try a \"MARDI\" format or describe\ntheir studies in rap lyrics, but those genres wouldn't best help us understand their findings. Furthermore, publishers and\nreaders would wonder why the writers don't seem to grasp the expectations of a research article (Are they not\nintelligent?) and question their credibility. So save any poetic chaos for creative writing class and keep your social\nscience papers shipshape.\nCohesion\nThird, hidden picture puzzles blend and camouflage an object, so even if you see it, you don't recognize it. For example,\na blonde's ponytail can look a lot like a banana. We don't want our ideas to have the blurry haze of a hidden picture.\nCohesion is all about forging links: you want to glance backward and forward, showing how your second idea connects\nto your first idea and how the second will connect to the third. Sometimes we're so happy to be done writing the meat of\na paragraph we neglect to cap it with a transition. But it's our job, not the reader's, to put the pieces of our paper\ntogether. Make sure your writing comes \"no assembly required.\"\nTo sum up, clarity consists of concision, coherence, and cohesion. To preview the other half of this chapter, vivacity vies\nfor variety and voice. I'm sorry, but alliteration is alluring\u2014which brings me to my final point about clarity. \"Clarity trumps\neverything\" (Harrison, 2012, p. 164). It doesn\u2019t matter how beautiful or clever (or alliterative) a sentence sounds if your\naudience doesn\u2019t know what it means. Our chief goal as we revise is to make the phrasing clearer. If we can also make\nit more interesting, so much the better. Clarity is for the brain; vivacity is for the ear\u2014and the heart.\n5.4 Concision\nConcision means getting the most power from the fewest words (Harrison, 2012). It doesn\u2019t mean being brief at all costs\nor neglecting detail (Strunk, 2004). It means every word must be doing work. Here\u2019s a comparison.\nImagine an Apple engineer hands you the latest iphone. You are intrigued because it has not one button but two. \u201cWhat\ndoes this button do?\u201d you ask. \u201cOh,\u201d the engineer mumbles. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anything. We had some plans for it, but they\ndidn\u2019t pan out. I guess we should have removed it.\u201d You probably feel embarrassed for Apple and use your new iphone\nto join the internet\u2019s mockery of its design flub. The inspiration for this example came from The Elements of Style, a\nwriting guide Time named one of the best and most influential books. It compares writing to design this way: \u201cA\n81 sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a\ndrawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts\u201d (p. 23). The term composition can be\na synonym for both design and writing.\nSo take pride in your writing\u2014aspire to the same standards of artisanship as when you bake a cake, build a robot, or\nshoot free throws. Now that we\u2019ve defined concision, let\u2019s address some qualms students may have about writing\nconcisely.\nComplicated \u2260 Intelligent\nMany students believe \u201cthe more words we use, or the more elaborate our language, the more intelligent we sound\u201d\n(Fiske, 2006, p. 43). In fact, the opposite is true, as this Stanford University study found. People who understand their\ntopic can communicate it simply. Remember\u2014\"clarity trumps everything\" (Harrison, 2012, p. 164). So don\u2019t let the\ndesire to sound professional (which is good) end up making you sound dull or murky. This became such a problem in\ngovernment publications that Congress passed the Plain Writing Act in 2010. Our government even maintains a website\nabout good style. Government employees have won the No Gobbledygook Award with fantastic revisions like this one\n(scroll down to see it). So concision isn\u2019t just wise; it\u2019s the law.\nDon't Inhale the Wordiness Surrounding You\nOnce a student doubted concision could be so important when his textbooks, he pointed out, were not concise.\nUnfortunately that\u2019s true\u2014many things we read are models of information more than models of writing. And we tend to\nimitate what we read, so beware of poor models. Always read critically, whether that\u2019s questioning information or the\npresentation of it.\nThoughts Count, Not Word Counts\nFinally, students may inflate their wording because they\u2019re thin on material and need to fill a page count. Unconcise\nwriting \u201cmakes a little thought go a long way\u201d (Lanham, 1981, 21:41). Here we can see how higher-level writing skills\n(like research and process) can influence sentence-level skills like concision. Students who have solid substance don\u2019t\nneed to be wordy. Students who plan well have time to revise.\nSome students hope the teacher won\u2019t notice a little padding here, a little padding there. I notice. Your English teacher\nnotices. Your teachers in other disciplines notice too, if only subconsciously. The word concision may not enter their\nminds, but if they breeze through your paper (when they must trudge through so many in their grading pile) their\nsupreme gratitude will likely boost your grade.\nNow that we\u2019ve discussed the value of concision, let\u2019s look at some wordy sentence patterns and learn how to fix them.\nWordy Sentence Patterns\nNear Synonyms\nThe first type (and the one people are most familiar with) is simple redundancy. The writer uses words that are similar or\nvery much the same. See what I did there? I didn\u2019t need to say similar and very much the same. Try revising this\nsample on your own:\nMany of the concepts and principles early psychology taught have not withstood later research and study.\n82 Show Answer\nYour revision may vary, but I hope you caught both pairs of near synonyms. Now, is there a shade of difference\nbetween concepts and principles? Yes, concept sounds like a pure idea while principle sounds more like a guideline or\neven a moral belief. The question is, are these terms different enough to justify asking the reader to process more\nwords? Will the reader sense something is missing if I don\u2019t use one? Often the answer depends on context. As for\nresearch and study, they can be synonyms if I mean consuming information. Perhaps research is a subset of study:\nresearch impliesstudy but study doesn\u2019t necessarily imply research. If my only meaning is scientific experimentation, I\nwould keep research and cut study. When faced with near synonyms, pick the one that best fulfills your purpose.\nStudents often use synonyms to round the sentence out by ear. They\u2019re afraid of short sentences. Don\u2019t be. You\u2019ll have\nplenty of opportunities to write in a variety of sentence lengths. Some wonder if an extra word or two can truly damage a\nsentence much. One instance often goes unnoticed; the danger is creating unconcise habits. An unneeded word in\neach sentence will soon bloat a paper drastically.\nCircumlocution\nThe next type is circumlocution, which means to talk around. This is using a phrase for which we already have a word.\nOften, that phrase defines the word itself. My mind once tripped over this sentence (see if you can find the\ncircumlocution):\nThe researchers quickly identified the problem and what the desired result of fixing it would be.\nWhy does that last part sound so funny? The desired result of fixing a problem sounds like a solution to me. In fact, if\nwe looked up solution in a dictionary that\u2019s roughly what it would say. Now revise this sentence:\nIn the event that the foundation does not renew our grant, we will not add any new staff in 2020.\nShow Answer\nSo don't dance around your meaning. Locute; don't circumlocute.\nWords Implied by Other Words\nIn the case of words implied by other words, the writer has found the right term but tacked on unneeded specifiers. Take\na look at this example:\nLaurel, one of my fellow classmates, combined the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide together (Fiske, 2006, p.\n107).\nCan we combine the materials separately? No, by definition combine means together, so we can cut together. We can\nalso use the singular classmate to imply one of. Is it possible to have an unfellow classmate? Well, that sends my\nsarcastic imagination spiraling in all sorts of directions, but that\u2019s probably not the writer\u2019s intention. So here\u2019s the\nrevision:\nMy classmate Laurel combined the hydrogen peroxide and potassium iodide (Fiske, 2006, p. 107).\nSome students even cut My classmate. Again, context should dictate that decision. Does the reader need to know\nLaurel is a classmate? That will depend on if we\u2019re writing a lab report (then probably not) or a blog post to interest\n83 parents in trying chemistry experiments with their children (then why not?). Now remove the implied words in this\nsentence:\nMy friends and I decided that the Cannon Center is where we would dine on one particular night.\nShow Answer\nYou may have noticed the original sentence wasn\u2019t long or unclear. If spoken, it wouldn\u2019t strike you as rambling. Since\nconversations are impromptu and writing can be revised, the standard of concision in print is much higher.\nThe first three strategies treated the word level. The next three eliminate weak sentence structures. Doing so will\nautomatically make them more vivacious.\nSmothered Verbs\nSmothered verbs is a friendlier term for nominalization\u2014meaning to turn into a noun. Most words can take several parts\nof speech:\nThe crew completed the building four days early. (verb)\nThe building was completely finished four days early. (adverb)\nThe completed building was four days early. (adjective)\nThe building was brought to completion four days early. (noun)\nEach example stresses a different component. The first highlights the crew\u2019s action while the second emphasizes\ncompleteness (a nominalization from the adjective complete) with the doubled completely finished. As is usually the\ncase, our verb form here is probably the best while the noun form is probably the worst. Other considerations being\nequal, use the verb form.\nI see a lot of nominalized verbs in this sentence:\nColleges now have an understanding that yearly tuition increases are impossible because of strong parental resistance\nto the soaring cost of higher education (Williams, 2010, p. 40).\nSmothered verbs get ridiculous quickly. For some reason, we\u2019re not allowed to understand\u2014we have to have an\nunderstanding. Resist isn't good enough either, but resistance of is. It sounds pompous and pointless, not professional.\nHow about this instead\u2014\nColleges understand they cannot increase tuition yearly because parents resist (Williams, 2010, p. 40).\nYou can keep the soaring cost of higher education if you want, but I resisted it. In this sentence, turn as many nouns as\nyou can into verbs:\nWith the recent reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone, helpful changes in the ecosystem have occurred, such as\na decrease in the elk population, changes in the plant life, and overall the restoration of the natural ecosystem.\nShow Answer\nWhoa\u2014that sentence became much shorter and clearer by using verbs (and more specific ones). Beware of generic\nverbs like change and affect. I affected my sister today sounds wacko. Worse, you could use the nominalization I had\n84 an effect on my sister today. A normal person would get to the point by saying I cheered up my sister today or I annoyed\nmy sister today.\nThe following sentence doesn\u2019t sound wacko, but it should:\nExcessive media consumption affects language development.\nUm, how? Not good, I\u2019m guessing? Understandably, studies often use affect because researchers don\u2019t yet know how\ntheir variables interact. You, however, know the conclusion and can use a dynamic verb. \u201cPlus and minus\u201d verbs work\nwell, such as increases/decreases or helps/hinders. We could rephrase to\u2014\nExcessive media consumption slows language development.\nWithout such a verb, we\u2019ll need another sentence:\nExcessive media consumption affects language development. Children do not progress as quickly.\nSpeed up this tentative momentum with precise verbs. Don\u2019t smother them. Now watch this video to solidify your anti-\nsmothering skills:\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/82MHOBvovmo\n85 Too Many \"To Be\" Verbs\nFirst, I need to give props to my colleague Julie Haupt for contributing this section. One trap that can slow the pace of\nwriting or weaken sentences can be the overuse of the pesky \"to be\" verbs. Though these words have a place in your\nwriting, overusing them can stifle your writing and leave it flat or unclear. To be verbs include any form of the word be.\nHere's a list of all the to be verbs:\nBe Was\nIs Were\nAm Been\nAre Being\nThink about it: When you say that your subject \u201cis\u201d something, all you\u2019re really telling your audience is that the subject\nexists. It simply is. That\u2019s a pretty obvious and unnecessary statement most of the time. Using be verbs isn\u2019t a crime,\nbut replacing be verbs with stronger, more specific verbs will add depth and variety to your writing.\nYou\u2019ll solve half of your to be verb problems by fixing any weak subjects that you have, which we have just discussed.\nSpotting other to be verbs that you can replace with a more vibrant choice may be harder, but with a little practice, you\u2019ll\nstart noticing these to be verbs all over the place!\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example.\nNo: Budgeting is an important way to be financially responsible.\nNow, you\u2019ve probably already noticed that this sentence doesn\u2019t have a weak there or it subject. However, we\u2019ve still tied\nour subject to a weak to be verb, \u201cis,\u201d that only states a simple, obvious fact. Not only that, but another to be verb, \u201cbe,\u201d\ncomes later on in the sentence.\nWe can improve this sentence to make it a little more lively in a few different ways depending on what we want to\nemphasize. Look at the more descriptive use of the verbs (highlighted in red) in these sentences:\nYes: You can become more financially responsible by budgeting.\nYes: Budgeting allows couples and families to remain financially responsible.\nYes: When families budget consistently, they learn to take responsibility for their finances.\nEach of these solutions has a slightly different emphasis, but they all convey the same general message without using\nany to be verbs. Notice as well how all of these sentences encourage a deeper thought than the original sentence.\nRather than just stating an obvious fact, these three other sentences make a connection between a specific action and\na desirable outcome.\nHere\u2019s another example with some potential solutions:\nNo: Exercising is the best antidepressant, so many health professionals say.\nYes: Many health professionals advocate for exercise as an effective antidepressant.\nYes: Many health professionals agree that exercise can alleviate some depressive symptoms more effectively than\nsome antidepressant medication.\n86 Again, these potential solutions emphasize different parts of the original ideas, but that\u2019s the beauty of using strong,\nvibrant verbs; your meaning can instantly become clearer and gain more depth. You\u2019ll find that you start saying a lot\nmore with fewer words as you pair strong subjects with strong verbs. To see some ideas of more vibrant verbs that can\nbetter articulate your ideas, check out this list of \u201caction verbs\u201d provided by BYU\u2019s Marriott school.\nIndoor plumbing is a commodity that many of us take for granted and is still spreading to third-world countries in places\nlike Africa and Asia.\nShow Answer\nVerbs Too Far From Subjects\nAgain, thanks to Julie Haupt for this section. Strong subjects and verbs might not do very much for you if you don\u2019t\nplace them where they can work together. Subjects and verbs communicate clearest when they sit close together in a\nsentence, and leaving interruptions between them can add confusion and introduce clumsy wording.\nWhen possible, avoid letting long phrases interrupt the flow of your sentence by placing them between your main\nsubject and your main verb. These interruptions between your subject and verb usually appear after helping words like\nif, because, and while. You might remember that these helping words are also known as subordinate conjunctions.\nHere\u2019s an example of this kind of an unnecessary interruption in the vicinity of the verb and its subject:\nNo: Some families, because they gather each night for family dinner, grow closer together.\nIn essence, these interrupting phrases make your readers mentally hold their breath until they finally get to the verb,\n\u201cgrow.\u201d Simply moving this detour before or after the subject-verb pairing can help your readers get to the point of your\nsentence faster as in this revised sentence:\nYes: Some families grow closer together because they gather each night for family dinner.\nWhen you rearrange your sentences like this, take extra care that you haven\u2019t accidentally created a misplaced modifier\n(see chapter 4). You may also need to reword a sentence somewhat if you\u2019re having trouble moving the interrupter\nelsewhere in the sentence.\nAlthough keeping your subject and verb close will usually strengthen your writing, it is not a hard and fast rule. In fact,\non occasion, you might find that an interruption between your subject and verb is the best way to write your sentence to\nadd some important emphasis. Even then, keep these interruptions as short as possible so your readers can process\nyour sentence easily.\nYes: Kind actions, when motivated by charity, bless others lives.\nIn this example, the interrupting phrase was short and helps to emphasize a key element of the meaning of the\nsentence. As you might imagine, the principle of keeping subjects and verbs close is particularly important when\nsentences get long and sometimes complicated. Let\u2019s look at a final example.\nNo: Competition, although it can be very motivating and invigorating for many individuals, can also bring contention\namong even the closest of friends.\n87 Here, we see an interruption that can easily be moved elsewhere in the sentence and will help the reader to process the\nsentence faster.\nYes: Although competition can be very motivating and invigorating for many individuals, it can also bring contention\namong even the closest of friends.\nYes: Competition can bring contention among even the closest of friends, although it can also be very motivating and\ninvigorating for many individuals.\nYou can review the principle of keeping subjects and verbs close with this short video:\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/oHA7hu9WeXsCaption\nStaying organized, which is not always an easy task considering the demanding nature of the principle, is not my\ncousin\u2019s best attribute.\nShow Answer\nPassive Voice\nPassive voice sentences tend to be longer, dryer, and harder to understand. The most typical sentence structure is\nsubject/object/verb:\nDean kicked the ball.\n88 This is active voice. Passive voice arranges it object/verb/subject:\nThe ball was kicked by Dean.\nThat\u2019s a formula for recognizing passive voice:\n\"To be\" verb + past tense verb + \"by\" subject.\nUse active voice as much as possible. To change passive voice into active voice, set the subject where it belongs\u2014in\nthe driver\u2019s seat since it\u2019s driving the sentence.\nOriginal: Since one of the best libraries in the country is owned by our university, a library science program should be\nstarted.\nRevision: Since our university owns one of the best libraries in the country, it should start a library science program.\nTry improving this sentence:\nMany violations of this policy have been committed by these employees.\nShow Answer\nSometimes fixing passive voice is trickier because the subject of the sentence is missing; it\u2019s implied instead. To fix\nthese, ask Who is doing the action of the sentence? Who is using the verb?\nOriginal: The woman was questioned for two hours before being arrested.\nRevision: Police questioned the woman for two hours before arresting her.\nThe first sentence would be okay if the writer wants to focus on the woman (we\u2019ll discuss this more soon). Rephrase the\nfollowing sentence on your own. It explains campus meal plans but hides the true subject. Can you find it?\nThe money to be used must be spent by the end of the semester or the remaining amount will be forfeited.\nShow Answer\nTo review active vs. passive voice, watch this video:\n89 Watch on YouTube\nCaption\nSometimes the passive voice is appropriate when the subject is unknown or less important than the object. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m\na 1960s journalist reporting on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. My first headline might say Three\nGunshots Fired at JFK. It\u2019s passive, but perhaps I don\u2019t yet have the shooter's name. Even if I did, the president is\narguably more important. By the same principle, JFK Pronounced Dead would be better than Dr. Clark Pronounces JFK\nDead.\nIn years past, studies have used this form of the passive voice to describe methods: Pairs of five-year-olds were\nobserved. However, APA Style now permits and even encourages authors to refer to themselves as I or We: We\nobserved pairs of five-year-olds or From the data I have concluded . . .\nHere's a great video to explain how to decide if passive voice is appropriate:\n90 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/WzHHYpq0aYs\nSo for the most part, stay active! And don't allow yourself to be weighed down by the passive voice. Or rather, don't let\nthe passive voice weigh you down.\nFalse Starts\nA false start is the opposite of making a good first impression. The opening phrase of the sentence says nothing,\ncreating what scholar Richard Lanham calls a slow wind-up. (He made a brilliant style video called Revising Prose.\nPerhaps your teacher would let you view it in class). One kind of false start is the \u201cblah blah is that\u201d opening (also\nLanham\u2019s term). Here's a sample:\nIt is clear that only a huge tax increase will make the program feasible.\nThis snarky guy calls this saying you\u2019re saying something.\n91 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-LLFR\nThe technical term for saying you're saying something is metadiscourse. Some types of metadiscourse are helpful like\nusing transition words and phrases to smooth out your writing. However, metadiscourse can easily become a false start\nwhen it's redundant or used as a filler. These sentences are easy to revise\u2014just chop off the beginning:\nOnly a huge tax increase will make the program feasible.\nThe other type of false start usually begins with the phrases It is, There is, or There are. Can you identify the subject\nand verb of this sentence?\nThere was a fight between Curtis and Miles at the basketball game last Saturday.\nMany students guess the subject is Curtis and Miles and the verb is fight. That\u2019s not correct, but it should be. The\nanswer is actually There was. Wow\u2014that\u2019s about the least specific, least vivacious subject-verb combo possible. Some\ncall these openers dummy subjects and verbs since they shunt the true subject and verb later in the sentence. To\nrevise, pull the true subject and verb up:\nCurtis and Miles fought at the basketball game last Saturday.\nNow reword this sentence:\nThere are a lot of articles for the committee to read before the budget review.\n92 Show Answer\nAs with the passive voice, sometimes the subject of a false start is missing. Who is doing the action in this sentence?\nThere has been a change in the graduation requirements for Exercise Science majors.\nWell, the administration or department probably did the actual changing:\nThe department has changed the graduation requirements for Exercise Science majors.\nIf you wanted to emphasize the change itself, perhaps the original sentence is okay. If you wanted to emphasize the\nconsequences for students, you could say this:\nExercise Science majors have new graduation requirements.\nInfer a subject for this sentence and adjust it accordingly:\nThere can be considerable controversy about the appropriate amount of homework for middle schoolers.\nShow Answer\nI\u2019m guessing we use false starts as a formula to get drafting. Don\u2019t know how to start a sentence? There is is there for\nyou. False starts are fine in a first draft, but be sure to clean them up for the final. If false starts are a habit for you, use\nthe search function (Control + F) to locate instances of There are, There was, There can, There would, etc. Try this trick\nfor finding any phrase you overuse. False start constructions can also begin a phrase, so don't let them slip by in the\nmiddle of a sentence:\nEven if we finish manufacturing the product this month, there is a lot of testing to complete before we can release it.\nWatch this video to learn how to get rid of \"There is\"-type false starts:\n93 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/eWBohA7uiBA\nYou made it\u2014you now have many tools to condense a sentence. I hope you\u2019re not overwhelmed because, ironically,\nconcision is the largest section in this chapter. I think that\u2019s because it\u2019s the most basic principle of style, and as I\nmentioned earlier, some of the strategies incidentally energize sentences (we could have discussed them in the vivacity\nsection too) as they shorten them. While concise writing does conserve the reader's time, more importantly, it conserves\nthe reader\u2019s energy. This is crucial in a long piece (such as a literature review) or a piece aimed at a general audience\n(such as a blog article). The more energy your sentences have, the less energy the reader depletes in processing them.\n5.5 Coherence\nThe next strategy for creating clarity is coherence. Broadly speaking, coherent means logical. In writing, it usually\nmeans logically organized. The best order to put your writing in is the one your audience expects. For most genres,\nthat\u2019s an introduction that presents the main idea, supporting paragraphs that substantiate it, and a conclusion that\nreiterates it.\nMost college students have mastered this macrostructure (I rarely ask students to move entire sections or paragraphs)\nbut need practice with microstructure: ordering within a paragraph. Often students build their microstructures by ear\u2014\ndoes it sound good? That\u2019s an accurate principle, but remember it\u2019s secondary: first clarity, then vivacity. Order your\nsentences by function instead. For academic papers, I use the acronym A BEAST to remember the elements my\nparagraph needs. After all, you want your paper to be a beast\u2014tough to reckon with.\n94 A BEAST\nArgument\nBackground\nEvidence\nAnalysis\nSummary\nTransition\nArgument\nA is for argument. Your previous teachers may have called this a topic sentence, but I prefer argument because your\nfirst sentence should do more than mention a subject\u2014it should state what the paragraph will prove. Even in an\ninformative (rather than persuasive) paper, you must give evidence that verifies the facts you want your readers to\nknow.\nThe best argument sentences encapsulate the entire paragraph: remember\u2014no slow wind-ups. Based on the argument\nsentence, a reader should know exactly what to expect from the paragraph. Let\u2019s take a look at an opening sentence\nthat doesn\u2019t do that. What do you predict the next sentences will be about?\nEvery person on this planet is unique.\nHmm . . . I think the paragraph might be about DNA since that\u2019s what makes us unique. Maybe the paragraph will\nencourage readers to identify and use their strengths. I hope the paragraph isn\u2019t about self-esteem\u2014by second grade I\nwas tired of hearing about that. So what is this paragraph really about? In this case, the answer comes in the last\nsentence of the paragraph (six sentences later):\nWhat if we implemented a literacy program that challenged children while they could still read books that interested\nthem?\nOh, so the writer mentioned uniqueness to lead up to the idea of a more customized reading curriculum. I understand\nthe intention now, but I want to understand from the beginning. In Western culture, we expect point-first writing: we want\nauthors to disclose their objective upfront. So make sure your argument sentence doesn\u2019t merely warm up to your point.\nNail it. If you notice you\u2019re a point-last writer, you can often find a later sentence that captures the whole paragraph\nbetter. For this example, I asked the student to make the last sentence the first and phrase it as a statement:\nI propose we implement a literacy program that challenges children yet allows them to read books that interest them.\nAnd the former first sentence isn't wasted effort\u2014it may be usable elsewhere.\nSome students are tempted to lead with background information or their best piece of evidence. This buries the\nargument in sentence three or four. Don\u2019t do it\u2014we can wait just a moment for background and we\u2019ll process your\ninformation better if we understand why you\u2019re telling it.\nBackground\nAfter argument comes background: this is nonargumentative (or less argumentative) material that prepares the reader\nfor your research. Sometimes the introduction provides sufficient background and you can move straight to E: evidence.\n95 Evidence\nYour reader is now ready to hear all the specific statistics, experiments, case studies, interviews, etc. you\u2019ve gathered.\nThe key word is specific. As a reader, I want to experience your research journey. I want to become as much of an\nexpert as you are. Describing the methods behind your most important findings will convince me more than\nsummarizing conclusion after conclusion. But we can\u2019t let evidence do all the work\u2014we need to add our own analysis.\nAnalysis\nAnalysis is your commentary on the evidence. You further explain how your research bolsters your argument. I find\nmany students tend to favor one or the other\u2014either evidence or analysis. The first group sticks closely to their articles,\nletting the scholars say everything. The second group prefers to skim over the studies in their own words, but this\ndoesn\u2019t permit the reader to experience the evidence firsthand. Balance evidence and analysis as much as you can.\nYou can also alternate between evidence and analysis as many times as you need. That means a paragraph might\nactually look like this: ABEAEAEAST.\nSummary\nS is for summary\u2014I wish it were P for Point, but that doesn\u2019t spell anything. I say that because it\u2019s much more important\nto echo your argument than rehash every bit of the paragraph. Often, the summary can state your point even more\nstrongly and specifically than the argument sentence because your reader already has all the details.\nTransition\nThe final element is T for transition. Although a single word is often sufficient (note final from the last sentence), I prefer\nconceptual transitions, meaning you show how the previous paragraph and the next relate. I could write this instead:\nJust as a summary sentence gives readers closure, a transition sentence primes them for the next.\nNow you know the entire A BEAST model. My goal isn\u2019t to lock you into a formula but to help you remember to order\nsentences by function first. For this exercise, identify the function of each sentence then reorder it accordingly. The\ncomputer has scrambled them randomly, but a first draft might look more like this:\nRight now, BYU has two terms during the spring and summer months instead of one semester. I had a spring term\ncourse and I noticed that many students were absent, would nod off, or leave class early. It\u2019s just too much all at once.\nSince students have to learn a semester of material in half the time, the classes are longer. The spring term and\nsummer term should be combined into one summer semester. According to one study, the most productive people work\nfor fifty minutes then take a break. A summer semester would optimize learning with manageable class periods of fifty to\nseventy-five minutes. People also don\u2019t retain what they learn as well, as I will discuss later. Classes can last three\nhours! Students can\u2019t focus for that long.\nPeople also don\u2019t retain what they learn as well as I will discuss next.\nGuideposts\nAlong with smart sequencing, guidepost words, which are transitional words anywhere in the paragraph, can help the\nreader know where you\u2019re going. Perhaps you\u2019ve gone hiking, wondered if you were still on the right trail, and a\nsignpost reassured you that you were. We can use words like for example, however, and consequently to signal our\nintentions to the reader (Harrison, 2012). This is where brief metadiscourse is not only appropriate but very helpful. Try\nreading the following paragraphs. The first offers no guideposts:\n96 Jazz bands began to split into two main categories: black and white. Black bands (bands made up entirely of African-\nAmericans) were known as \u201cbig bands.\u201d Solos were encouraged among all of the band members, not just the leader of\nthe band. These bands played mostly for the poorer, lower class blacks of the era. These big bands began writing their\nown music. The music performed by jazz bands had been made up entirely of arrangements of the day\u2019s popular music.\nMusic was written specifically for a band (Harrison, 2012, pp. 166-167).\nThis revision gives us several trail marks (set in italics):\nJazz bands began to split into two main categories: black and white. Black bands (bands made up entirely of African-\nAmericans) were known as \u201cbig bands\u201d and were characterized by a number of things. First, solos were encouraged\namong all of the band members, not just the leader of the band. Second, these bands played mostly for the poorer,\nlower class blacks of the era. And third, these big bands began writing their own music. Up until this time, the music\nperformed by jazz bands had been made up entirely of arrangements of the day\u2019s popular music. It wasn\u2019t until this time\nthat music was written specifically for a band (Harrison, 2012, p. 167).\nThe first paragraph feels a bit fragmented\u2014almost more like a list of facts than a paragraph. In the second, the writer\u2019s\nexpressions direct our attention. We mentally place the first pieces of information under characteristics. The next\nphrases tell us we\u2019re moving into historical development. Like a GPS, signal phrases save readers energy and worry by\nalerting them to turns in advance.\nOld to New Information\nAnother tactic for creating coherence is starting with information the reader is likely to know then moving to less\ncommonly known information. This gives the reader a foundation to build on. For example, I\u2019m guessing most of you\nhave heard of The Wizard of Oz story. I bet many of you have also seen the film. Very few, though, would be familiar\nwith the literacy criticism it\u2019s prompted. Thus, my audience will feel most comfortable beginning with old information, like\nthe characters, and then progressing to new information, like the story\u2019s possible symbolism. Rewrite the following\nparagraph based on that principle:\nThe Wizard of Oz may be a political allegory, which many fans of this beloved book and film do not know. For example,\nthe scarecrow represented farmers, who didn\u2019t have a brain because farmers of the era weren\u2019t looking after their\npolitical interests. Industry was represented by the tinman. The Industrial Revolution was making humanity heartless, so\nthe tinman didn\u2019t have one. Finally, the drought in the western United States was embodied by the Wicked Witch, who\ncould only be killed by water (Taylor, 2005).\nShow Answer\nAs with concision, don\u2019t worry about coherence as you\u2019re drafting. Your first version need only be a brain dump. Write\nthe way you played as a child. If I handed a group of adults an enormous box of Legos and asked them to make\nsomething, they would probably pick through the first layer of pieces, fretting about what to do first. A group of kids\nwould turn that box upside down. They instinctively know it\u2019s easier to sort the parts when they\u2019re all on the table.\n5.6 Cohesion\nSome use coherence and cohesion interchangeably, but I see coherence as putting ideas in a logical order whereas\ncohesion is linking (or sticking\u2014as in adhesive) ideas smoothly. For example, the following paragraph is completely\ncohesive yet completely incoherent:\n97 On my fridge I keep a collection of magnets. Magnet rhymes with Dragnet. Dragnet, a true crime television series, took\nplace in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the second most populous city in the United States.\nYou can see how I moved from one idea to the next, but the paragraph says nothing significant (although I highly\nrecommend Dragnet).\nSentence Linking\nThe best paragraphs are both coherent and cohesive. The following sentences are in a good order, but I think I can\nmake the links between sentences more graceful. The writer introduces the problem with a story then advocates for\nchange:\nOriginal: Many ducks roam around my neighborhood. When they have new ducklings, I love to watch them. The mother\nleads the ducklings, and sometimes she walks over the storm drains. The ducklings fall right through the slats of the\ndrain because their feet aren\u2019t big even though their mother\u2019s are. Then residents or city personnel must get into the\ndrain, catch the ducklings, and lift them out. We should put mesh nets over the storm drains so they don\u2019t fall in.\nThe paragraph makes sense, but notice how it flows better when I make a phrase near the end of one sentence\nconnect to a phrase early in the next sentence. The pairings are in red and blue:\nRevision: Many ducks roam around my neighborhood. My neighbors and I enjoy watching them, especially when they\nhave new ducklings. They are adorable as they waddle behind their mother so faithfully. But sometimes the mother\nwalks over a storm drain and the ducklings fall right in! Their tiny feet just aren\u2019t big enough to span the drain\u2019s slats.\nThese drains wouldn\u2019t trap the ducklings if the city spread mesh nets over them. If we don\u2019t, residents or city personnel\nmust continue to get into the drains, catch the ducklings, and lift them out.\nNow make this already-coherent paragraph more cohesive with sentence linking:\nSalt Lake City should build a new theatre for two reasons. Broadway producers know the Salt Lake area is a good\nmarket because we have many singers and dancers. Recent shows from New York will really attract this crowd.\nFurthermore, many seats at Capitol Theatre don\u2019t have a decent view of the stage. In 1903, the principles of good sight\nlines weren\u2019t as well known, which is when the theatre opened. However, the city hesitates to rebuild Capitol Theatre\nbecause it\u2019s a historic structure.\nShow Answer\nSide note\u2014these sentences came true. Salt Lake City built a new theatre, the Eccles, in 2016. Capitol Theatre\nrenovated its seating in 2019.\nSubject Aligning\nAnother method of creating cohesion is subject aligning. This means keeping the main idea of the paragraph at the\nbeginning of sentences as much as possible. This reworking of the duckling paragraph is also cohesive:\nMany ducks roam around my neighborhood. They are fun to watch, especially when they have new ducklings. They are\nadorable as they waddle behind their mother so faithfully. But sometimes the ducklings follow their mother over a storm\ndrain and fall right in! Their tiny feet just aren\u2019t big enough to span the drain\u2019s slats. The ducklings then have to be\nrescued by residents or city personnel who get into the drains, catch them, and lift them out. The poor creatures could\nbe spared if the city spread mesh nets over the drains.\n98 For the sake of example, I aligned the subject of every sentence, but that isn\u2019t necessary. A little variation is refreshing\nand won\u2019t disrupt the cohesion. I also had to use the passive voice in the last two sentences, which could be okay if I\nwant to focus on the ducklings.\nTry subject aligning this paragraph. Use the passive voice as little as possible.\nBody image is usually decreased by viewing advertisements. When presented with ideals that are difficult or impossible\nto achieve and maintain, people become less secure. This spurs the growth of profits as consumers buy product after\nproduct to improve appearance. Over the last few decades, research has confirmed the harm ads wield over female\nbody image. Whether this harm is equal on males, however, is a more recent question.\nShow Answer\nIf cohesion seems nitpicky\u2014you\u2019re right. But in another sense it\u2019s the crowning achievement of clear writing. If you take\ntime to be cohesive, don\u2019t be surprised if people ask you how you write so well. Your audience will be pleasantly\nsurprised when reading your work feels as frictionless as ice skating. Sadly, we\u2019re used to reading being as \u201cfrictionless\u201d\nas say\u2014wrestling an alligator. Level every obstacle for your reader. Use cohesion to lull them into a lovely rhythm.\nExcellent work\u2014you\u2019re now equipped to make your sentences clearer. If you do, they\u2019ll also become more interesting.\nIn the next section you\u2019ll acquire even more tools to animate your writing.\n5.7 Vivacity\nPermit me to have a hipster moment\u2014I liked Harry Potter before it was cool. Nobody I knew was hep to the series until\nthe release of book four. Once at lunch a friend complained she didn\u2019t like how the storyline was unfolding. I realized I\nalmost didn\u2019t care about the plot. I read because I loved simply being in J. K. Rowling\u2019s magical world. Reading felt like\nliving there. The characters felt alive to me. Even today, all I want to know is, will I go to Hogwarts when I die?\nThat\u2019s the power of lifelike\u2014or vivacious\u2014writing (the Latin root viv means life as in revive or survive). Vivacious writing\ntransforms reading from the Dementor-like torture of passing eyes over print to extract information to conversing with a\nreal live human being (as pleasant as a bite of Professor Lupin's chocolate). The first requires great patience and gives\nlittle satisfaction in return. The second feels a lot like listening to a story.\nAlthough your teachers won\u2019t let you write a novel instead of your literature review, you can use the techniques of\ncreative writing in any genre much more than you would expect. We will learn about two: voice and variety.\n5.8 Voice\nVoice refers to the writer\u2019s attitude or personality. Some use voice to include choices like vocabulary, sentence length,\nand sentence structure although I feel those belong to the broader term style. However, style certainly influences voice:\ndescribing the babbling of a brook as mellifluous would establish an elevated, elegant tone. Using a fragment like \"No\nway!\" would create a playful, conversational voice.\nThe appropriate voice for a text depends on its genre and audience. For example, we expect a lot of voice in a poem\nand very little in a health history. This semester you\u2019ll write for both academic and general audiences in assignments\n99 like the literature review and magazine spread. Both will have a similar goal, such as reducing television viewing for\nchildren under two, but the audience will determine the content you include.\nIn an academic paper, you might address a government agency, citing studies that prove frequent television viewing\nreduces the parent-child interaction necessary to build language skills. You might ask the government agency to make a\nbrochure about child media guidelines for pediatricians to give to parents. In a magazine article, you might address\nparents directly with a bulleted list of activities they can enjoy with their children besides watching TV.\nRegardless of the genre, two strategies, story framing and sentence-as-action, will help you enhance your voice.\nStory Framing\nHumans think in stories. You know that when a presenter begins telling a story, your attention perks up. I definitely\nrecommending using stories in your pieces for a general audience. Should we use stories in an academic paper?\nPossibly\u2014some research includes interviews or case studies. Even if we don\u2019t tell a story, we can frame anything as a\nstory. The audience probably won\u2019t know you\u2019re doing this, but they will be more engaged.\nLet\u2019s start by framing this semester as a story. What do we need to tell a story? I give my creative writing students the\nacronym COOT to remember.\nCharacter\nObjective\nObstacle\nTactic\nThis Semester: Your Story\nA story needs a character who has an objective, encounters obstacles, and uses tactics to overcome them. So who is\nour hero this semester? It\u2019s you! Your objective for this class is probably to get a good grade. Your obstacles might be\nprocrastination, wanting to spend more time with friends, or meeting family obligations. Your tactics might include\nsetting a schedule, studying with friends, or video chatting with your little sister instead of driving the hour home. That\u2019s\nnot a bad story\u2014most importantly, I hope you now think of yourself as a hero\u2014but I think we can go bigger.\nAs an example, we'll discuss the work of McCall Booth, the student who wrote the paper about reducing television\nviewing in children under two. McCall is a Human Development major . Let\u2019s go bigger\u2014McCall wants to help people\n(objective). She wants to overcome the obstacle of speech disorders so children can communicate well. McCall's\nchoosing to study this problem this semester because she wants to face the enemy\u2014what prevents children from\ndeveloping language? One answer is excessive television. Now McCall knows her nemesis. What tactics will she use to\ndefeat it? McCall realizes parents have the power to direct their child\u2019s behavior. She wants to write to them. But how\nwill parents get the message? McCall may need another tactic. In her research, she learns that behavior interventions\nwith medical professionals work best\u2014people believe and follow the advice of their doctor. So McCall's strategy is to\nget pediatricians to tell parents about media guidelines for children. McCall's everyday school drudgery is now a story.\nI hope you\u2019ll frame your semester this way more than the first way. You are the hero of this project. You\u2019re here to\ndestroy your archenemy: a social problem. Your sidekicks are ready to help\u2014your teacher, your review group, even the\nscholars whose material you cite. Your superpowers are your research, your persuasion, and your writing skills. What\nyou write could help eradicate the problem. What you say could convince those in power to implement your\nrecommendations. (Remember I promised to tell you about a scientist who did just that? She\u2019s still coming.)\n100 Research as a Story: Make a Movie for Your Readers\nYou can frame the problem you\u2019re studying this semester the same way for your audience. When I was studying for a\ncollege entrance exam, my teacher told me, \u201cWhenever you read, make a movie in your mind.\u201d Watch how McCall\nmakes a movie for her reader in the introduction of an article she geared to Parents magazine:\nAlex sighs in frustration as he enters the living room. Toys scattered on the floor, books yanked from shelves, and his\nkids pay no mind to the chaos they\u2019ve created. He needs to help cook dinner, but first he needs a way to distract the\nchildren from their havoc-wreaking. The instant Alex turns on the television the kids gravitate toward the bright screen,\nand he can work in peace. But he can\u2019t stop the little voice in his head that asks when was the last time he played with\nhis children rather than letting a screen babysit them.\nWho is our hero now? Alex, or more broadly, parents. What is the objective? To help cook dinner\u2014more generally, to\naccomplish tasks at home. What is the obstacle? The children are asking for attention too. What is the tactic? Television\n\u2014it will absorb the children\u2019s attention instead. McCall then hints this tactic may have serious consequences. In the rest\nof the article she will explain these consequences and suggest better tactics.\nFraming the social problem as a story accomplishes two things: first, the audience is more interested. Of course, McCall\ncould have started the article this way: \u201cToo much television delays language development.\u201d That sounds like a\nsentence straight from her research paper, and we expect more pizzazz when we read a magazine. We pick up a\nmagazine for a break, not a lecture. Second, she relates to her audience. In a magazine, her research paper sentence\ncould sound like an accusation. Subtext: Why are you such a bad parent? You\u2019re making your kid dumb. Never watch\nTV again! Instead, her story sympathizes with parents by showing she understands the stressful choices they face.\nHow could McCall frame the story for an academic paper? Her audience will be other experts who care about the\nproblem, with scholars and speech pathologists as the primary audience. Educators and social workers could be a\nsecondary audience. Inevitably, peers in the class and the teacher will \u201coverhear\u201d her paper. Others who can help fix the\nproblem, like medical professionals and government employees, might be a tertiary audience. You should use your\nvoice in an academic paper, but it will be subdued. The trick is to be spirited enough to interest your reader and not so\nspirited you lose your credibility (Harrison, 2012). Perhaps it\u2019s like wearing your best suit to a job interview but throwing\nin a stylish necktie or necklace.\nTo sound professional, students often use abstract nouns as the subjects of their sentences. In McCall's case those\nmight be language development, interaction, speech delay, and screen media consumption. Unfortunately, when it\ncomes to making a movie in the mind, inanimate concepts aren\u2019t very lively actors. If you can make the subject of your\nsentence a person, do it. You won\u2019t sound less professional, and the audience will pay attention and understand you\nbetter. McCall can use subjects like parents, children, speech pathologists, and pediatricians throughout her paper.\nHere is a sample introduction for an academic paper:\nSpeech pathologists and other professionals who work with children know the American Academy of Pediatrics\nrecommends that children under two do not use screen media. In treating clients, many of us have probably seen a\nparent hand an underage child a smart phone or tablet while they wait for the older child\u2019s appointment to finish. Should\nwe say something? Yes. We know premature and excessive media consumption can contribute to many problems,\nincluding language delay. Since parents need to hear this message early and regularly, I advise speech pathologists to\npartner with pediatricians, who meet with a family about nine times during a child\u2019s pre-toddler years.\n101 This paragraph features action, not concepts, by using story framing: We have characters (speech pathologists) who\nhave an objective (sharing media guidelines to avoid language delay). To overcome the obstacle (usually treating\nchildren already two years old) they develop a tactic (teaming with pediatricians).\nShow Your Hero Succeeding\nEspecially in texts for a general audience, be sure to finish the story. You\u2019ve painted a \u201cbefore\u201d picture that illustrates the\nproblem. Now paint an \u201cafter\u201d picture that shows the benefits of implementing the solution. Show your hero (the\naudience) succeeding. This could be McCall\u2019s conclusion of her magazine spread:\nWhen Alex enters the living room tonight, things are much the same: toys scattered on the floor, books yanked from\nshelves, and his kids pay no mind to the chaos they\u2019ve created. He needs to help cook dinner, but now television isn\u2019t\nhis first strategy for engaging the children. Instead, he scoops up an armful of play food among the toys and leads his\nchildren to the kitchen. He puts a pot on the floor for his three-year-old, hands her some play food, and asks her to cook\nsomething. He sends his five-year-old son to get salt from the pantry. He knows chatting about cooking (real or pretend)\nwith his children contributes much more to their development than watching television, and he feels good about\nspending time with them.\nHere's a prewriting exercise to experiment with story framing on your own:\nThink about the next assignment you will write for this class. How can you use story framing to make the piece\nmore interesting? Either jot down some plans here or try writing the introduction itself.\nStory framing is Mary Poppins\u2019s spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down. After all, many of us can breeze\nthrough fifty pages of a novel in the time it takes to decode five pages of a research article. Well here\u2019s the irony: a\nspoonful of sugar was only in the film, not the book. See\u2014those filmmakers know what they\u2019re doing. Make a movie for\nyour reader.\nSentence as Action\nSometimes I\u2019ve asked myself, Can I shortcut all this revision by writing a solid sentence in the first place? I think the\nanswer is yes and no. No, we rarely write a sentence the best way the first way. And yes, a few tricks can help us know\nif we\u2019re on the right track during drafting. First, we need to shift the way we think about a sentence. When you were\nyounger, you probably learned that a sentence is a complete thought. As a college student, you likely read many\nsentences that are overloaded units of information. I define a sentence as a unit of action: A subject verbed an object.\nSomething happened\u2014that\u2019s a story. And remember, we can frame anything as a story.\nFrom the sentence-as-action paradigm, I\u2019ve created a formula for a good sentence. I hesitate to say formula\u2014writing is\na fascinating blend of art and science and thus never formulaic\u2014but I hope it can be a handy yardstick on the go. For\ncontrast, let\u2019s look at the bad formula first. I\u2019ve included pictures so you can see what a bad sentence feels like.\n102 Bad Sentence Formula\nVague subject +\nPhoto by WandererCreative\nWeak verb or\nPassive verb or\nUnnecessary \"to be\" verb +\nPhoto by Spoba\nEverything else you need to say but didn\u2019t because you wasted your\nsubject and verb\nPhoto by Ben Kerckx\nHere's a bad formula sentence to muck through. Can you tell what it means? Hint: It's the plot of a well-known movie.\nI've formatted it as a \"question\" below, just so you can click the answer when you're ready.\nA difference of opinion was undertaken by two opposing parties in which the surprising fact of one party\u2019s paternity was\nrevealed by the other party.\nShow Answer\nNaturally, the opposite is the good sentence formula:\n103 Good Sentence Formula\nConcrete subject (human if possible) + forceful verb + the result (what happened when the subject verbed the object?).\nTake this bad formula sentence about McCall's topic and give it a concrete subject and a forceful verb.\nA meeting should take place in which media guidelines are gone over at pediatric offices so harmful exposure does not\noccur.\nShow Answer\nA thesaurus is your best friend when it comes to pinpointing the powerful verb you need. I used one myself to write that\nlast sentence\u2014instead of pinpointing I had finding. This is a perfect case to illustrate what a thesaurus can do: often our\nworking memory can't promptly retrieve all the vocabulary we know. Searching for the right synonym can trigger that \"on\nthe tip of the tongue\" feeling. A thesaurus can bring the ideal word to mind much more quickly. Many word processors\nhave a built-in thesaurus\u2014try right-clicking the word.\nA final tip\u2014only use words you already know from the thesaurus. Choosing a scholarly-sounding word you have only a\nvague notion of can be tempting, but it may not fit your context or have connotations you didn't anticipate. Now that you\nhave the framework for a compelling sentence, let's look at some troubleshooting.\nSmoothing Sentences with Parallelism\nIn oral presentations, we worry about stumbling over our words. In writing we can't literally stutter, but sentences\nsometimes sound awkward. The culprit is often problems with parallelism (for more on parallelism, see chapter 4,\nsection 5A under STRUCTURE). The following sentence is not parallel:\nKara's hobbies include reading, sewing, and dance.\nMaybe your ear gagged on that last bit. Why not say dancing so it matches the others? Parallelism means keeping\nequal parts of a sentence in the same form: for example, all verbs or all nouns\u2014not a mix.\nFix the parallelism mistake in this sentence:\nOur college helps students land careers in computer programming, software development, service technicians, and IT\nmanagers.\nShow Answer\nParallelism also means making sure the first part of the sentence tallies with the last. Look at this sentence:\nThe English teacher said Alicia needed to improve her grammar and coming to class late.\nThe verb improve has two nouns phrases attached to it: grammar and coming to class late. Let\u2019s separate the parts of\nthe sentence to check if each works on its own:\nThe English teacher said Alicia needed to improve her grammar.\nOkay, that sounds normal. What about the second part?\n104 The English teacher said Alicia needed to improve her coming to class late.\nThat sounds funny. We can fix it by using a different noun phrase that gels better with improve:\nThe English teacher said Alicia needed to improve her grammar and punctuality.\nOr we could add a verb that fits with class:\nThe English teacher said Alicia needed to improve her grammar and come to class on time.\nMake the following sentence parallel:\nCrooning saxophones and trumpets that blare can be heard at Jake's Jazz Joint, which also sells sheet music and\ntuning.\nShow Answer\nThe best way to find clumsy sentences is to read your paper out loud. That probably sounds like nerdy overachieving.\nDo it anyway. If it sounds good reading aloud, it will sound good to the reader.\nA vibrant voice pops the topic right off the page. Help your readers visualize your research journey by framing it as a\nstory and packing your sentences with action.\n5.9 Variety\nJust as we can spice up our writing with voice, we can use the spice of life\u2014variety. This section will specifically discuss\nsentence length and sentence structure.\nVarying Sentence Length\nHave you ever driven from Provo to St. George? This trip has the perfect conditions for highway hypnosis. With not\nmuch to see (unless you\u2019re a sagebrush expert), a constant speed limit, and very few traffic maneuvers to vary the\npace, drivers can suddenly realize they\u2019ve been zoned out for ten or twenty minutes\u2014they\u2019ve been driving without\nconscious effort.\nI hope my readers are pretty conscious when I\u2019m with them, so I vary the pace by varying sentence length. For the most\npart, our sentences are too long and too similar (Lanham, 1981). How can you determine a good length? Sometimes\ncontent influences the pace: I may use some staccato sentences for my hard-hitting statistics, then stroll leisurely\nthrough a touching story. Here are other factors to consider:\nShort sentences (1\u201310 words) keep the reader\u2019s attention and are easy to understand. However, they may sound\nchoppy or immature if overused. Long sentences (20\u201330 words) have plenty of room to show connections between\nideas, but they risk boring or confusing the reader. Medium sentences (10\u201320 words) combine the benefits of both:\nthey\u2019re short enough to be readable but long enough to develop ideas. And we\u2019ve already discussed the drawback of\ntoo many medium sentences\u2014highway hypnosis.\nEvery sentence in the following paragraph is of medium length (13\u201316 words). Revise for more variety. Be as creative\nas you wish (keep the meaning but change anything else):\n105 Good writers and good boxers are alike because they try to vary their moves. A boxer who always gave two quick jabs\nthen one uppercut would be laughed at. The opponent would probably win the fight because the rhythm is too\npredictable. Writers try to create sentences of different lengths so they keep the attention of their audience.\nShow Answer\nOne way to control length is to coordinate (combine) sentences well. First we must learn to combine them logically, then\nwe can learn to switch up our habitual sentence patterns. (In case we have any editing minors in the house, some\nexamples will technically subordinate rather than coordinate, but for simplicity\u2019s sake I\u2019m putting both under the\ncategory sentence combining.)\nCombining Sentences Logically\nOften, writers don\u2019t combine sentences with much variety. And becomes the default coordinating word. Writers merge\nmany short sentences with and for no reason except to get that medium length the ear likes. Remember\u2014not every\nsentence needs to be round; use many lengths so the paper feels on average round.\nHere are two strategies for coordinating sentences better. First, coordinate only when you need to. Don\u2019t combine\nsentences unless they have a direct relationship. Second, use a coordinator more specific than and if possible. The\nfollowing sentence uses illogical coordination:\nEvery Christmas I open a new pair of pajamas, and my grandpa\u2019s birthday is the next day.\nThe relationship between the parts is tenuous (Which are we going to talk about\u2014pajamas or Grandpa?) so the writing\nsounds juvenile\u2014more like impromptu speech. These ideas belong in separate sentences, possibly separate\nparagraphs. When you write, if you determine the ideas do belong in the same sentence, then make sure you're using a\nsuitable coordinator.\nA good coordinator accurately defines the relationship between the two parts. The relationship may be contrast (but,\nalthough), cause and effect (because, consequently), or order (after, third). Notice how these sentences sound more\nlogical with proper coordination:\nOriginal: Cassie stayed up late to study the night before the test, and Colin gave his brain plenty of sleep.\nRevision: Cassie stayed up late to study the night before the test, but Colin gave his brain plenty of sleep.\nOriginal: She brought a toy to school, and her parents had to talk to the teacher.\nRevision: Because she brought a toy to school, her parents had to talk to the teacher.\nOriginal: To make macaroni and cheese, boil and drain the noodles and add butter, sauce, and milk.\nRevision: To make macaroni and cheese, first boil the noodles. When they are tender, drain the water. Finally, add\nbutter, sauce, and milk.\nImprove this paragraph with more appropriate coordination. Be sure to separate sentence parts that don't have a direct\nrelationship.\nMy family has many Christmas Eve traditions. We watch a movie and we usually disagree about it. My brother Reid\nlikes comedies like Elf, and my brother Ryker prefers classics like It\u2019s a Wonderful Life. We also make treats. Caramel\npopcorn is our favorite, and we play card games. We eat the popcorn and the cards get sticky.\n106 Show Answer\nNow that you know how to fix faulty coordination, let\u2019s try combining sentences in more interesting ways.\nCombining Sentences Creatively\nWe tend to default to the most common English sentence structure: subject, verb, object. And that\u2019s okay\u2014we want\nplenty of those because the reader expects them and understands them easily. Writers also have their unique sentence\npattern habits. For example, I love introductory phrases\u2014and I can\u2019t resist finishing with a dashy punch (or\nparenthetical phrase). You should embrace your quirks too, but how do we expand our stylistic repertoire?\nResearch has proven that practicing combining sentences and imitating the way master writers do so reliably improves\nyour writing style (Graham & Perin, 2007). BYU professors Brian Jackson and Jon Ostenson created Style Academy,\nwhich is packed with sentence combining and sentence imitating exercises. Let\u2019s sample one of each. Below are two\nvideos and two exercises. In the videos, Professor Jackson will do one example with you then give you one to do on\nyour own. Be sure to pause the video when indicated so you can write your paragraph, which will be the answer to the\naccompanying question.\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/C46WGj85ix8\n1.1 This happened in the late 1990s. 1.2 I could no longer see my feet. 1.3 I made an appointment with a Paris eye\ndoctor. 1.4 The doctor ran some tests. 1.5 The doctor sent me off to buy some glasses.\n2.1 I'd like to blame my choice of frames on the fact that I couldn't see them clearly.\n107 3.1 I'd like to say they were forced upon me. 3.2 Neither excuse is true.\n4.1 I made the selection of my own free will. 4.2 I chose them because I thought they made me look smart. 4.3 I chose\nthem because I thought they made me look international.\n5.1 The frames were made of dark plastic. 5.2 The frames had rectangular lenses. 5.3 The lenses were not much larger\nthan my eyes.\n6.1 There was something vaguely familiar about them. 6.2 I could not put my finger on what was vaguely familiar about\nthem.\n7.1 I spent a great deal of time in front of the mirror. 7.2 This was after I picked them up. 7.3 I pretended to share\nintelligent comments regarding the state of Europe.\nShow Answer\nIf you need content for your sentence, consider writing about your research.\nOption 1: Sometimes, according to Edwin Teale, a gall gnat larva, which does not resemble the adult in the least, and\nwhich has certainly not mated, nevertheless produces within its body eggs, live eggs, which then hatch within its soft\ntissue.\nOption 2: There is nothing better that students can take home over summer vacation than a sense that what they have\nlearned the previous year has meant they were able, with the help of lots of other people, including that alienated girl\nwith the green hair and that kid who counts on his fingers, and lots and lots of people beyond the walls of the school, to\nmake something important happen, to meet a challenge.\nShow Answer\nHave you ever noticed how rearranging the furniture can make a room feel completely new? The same goes for\nsentences, but sometimes we don\u2019t rearrange them because revision, like furniture, can be heavy. With practice though,\nthe task becomes lighter\u2014maybe more like rearranging flowers.\n5.10 Grammar & Mechanics\nAs a side note before we conclude, things like spelling, grammar, and punctuation (I\u2019ll lump them under the terms\ngrammar and mechanics) are also components of style (see Chapter 4 Grammar and Mechanics). Grammar and\nmechanics are the lowest level concern, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should neglect them. I know they can be annoying\u2014\nsome rules of English make sense; many don\u2019t. But anytime we make an error, the reader\u2019s attention may be drawn away\nfrom the message and dwell on the mistake.\nAs a comparison, imagine you attend a Hollywood party where celebrities are wearing couture like Armani tuxedos and\nDior gowns. You\u2019re very impressed with your conversation partner\u2019s ensemble\u2014and then you notice a zipper that\u2019s not\nquite, well, zipped. It\u2019s hard to ignore. Even though the outfit comes from one of the most prestigious designers on the\nplanet, something\u2019s just a little off, a little embarrassing. Don\u2019t let that happen to your paper.\nHere are two tips for proofreading. First, read the paper aloud. The brain often autocorrects typos when reading silently.\nYou'll also be more accurate if you use a hard copy. Second, read the paper backwards\u2014not directly backwards, but\n108 read the last sentence first, then the next-to-last sentence, etc. Reading forward, the mind concentrates on the text\u2019s\noverall meaning and may overlook technicalities like mechanics. As a teacher I really appreciate (and reward!) papers\nthat contain few to no errors, especially in citation. Usually this means the student has managed time well to refine the\npaper so thoroughly.\n5.11 Help Them Hear You\nLet\u2019s get back to where we started: not boring. Does a 350-page book about pesticides sound not boring to you? Me\nneither, but that book, Silent Spring, has sold more than six million copies in the United States alone since 1962\n(Palacio, 2012).\nThe video below tells the story of the author, or if you prefer the short version, I\u2019ll list out her story frame too:\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Ipbc-6IvMQI\nCharacter: Rachel Carson, marine biologist.\nObjective: Establish the responsible use of pesticides.\nObstacle: The public doesn\u2019t know how dangerous pesticides can be. Many only know the pesticide DDT saved millions\nof lives during Word War II by eradicating malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Apparently, pesticides are the greatest liquid\nsince H O (hardly an exaggeration\u2014see 4:56).\n2\nTactic: Inform the public by writing a book.\n109 Of course, many books don\u2019t succeed. What made Silent Spring different? First, Rachel Carson had the goods. Her\nbook\u2019s reference list was fifty pages long (and you thought your bibliography was a pain). One pesticide manufacturer\nfeared Carson\u2019s research so much it threatened to sue the New Yorker (which published Silent Spring serially) for libel\nunless the final installment of the book was cancelled. The magazine\u2019s legal counsel replied, \u201cEverything in those\narticles has been checked and is true. Go ahead and sue\u201d (Sherman, 2001, p. 53). Do you have that kind of confidence\nin the quality and quantity of your research? I know it\u2019s a high standard for a college paper, but it\u2019s a standard that can\nmobilize the public to solve a problem.\nCarson\u2019s second success secret was style, of course. She could have started her book with this sentence: Pesticides\nare chemicals that kill or repel unwanted organisms. But she didn\u2019t. In fact, I bet you can guess how she did start it.\nRead the next paragraph to check your answer:\nThere was once a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in harmony with its surroundings. The town\nlay in the midst of a checkerboard of prosperous farms, with fields of grain and hillsides of orchards where, in spring,\nwhite clouds of bloom drifted above the green fields. In autumn, oak and maple and birch set up a blaze of color that\nflamed and flickered across a backdrop of pines. Then foxes barked in the hills and deer silently crossed the fields, half\nhidden in the mists of the fall mornings (1).\nYes, she started with a story\u2014woven with gorgeous language, as I\u2019m sure you noticed. The first chapter is even called\n\u201cA Fable for Tomorrow.\u201d Carson goes on to describe how the town changes: suddenly livestock die off, crops won\u2019t\ngrow, and even humans fall ill. She explains that while this town is fictional, each individual disaster has actually\noccurred in a community.\nWhile subsequent chapters slide from this literary style to a more general style peppered with academia, the wording\nstays sharp. Plus, the stories\u2014true ones\u2014stick around (you can read one at the New Yorker). Carson knew case\nstudies not only hook the reader, they evidence an argument: come for the story; stay for the social change.\nSilent Spring\u2019s style enchanted me so much, by the time I finished the book, Carson had me easily remembering that\nendrin is more toxic than dieldrin, that the recommended application of DDT is one pound per acre, and that 100 parts\nper million of DDD in body tissue is enough to kill birds and fish. And I was a teenage English major.\nIn response to Silent Spring, John F. Kennedy assigned the Presidential Science Advisory Committee to conduct its\nown studies on pesticides (Michaels, 2003). Twelve of the pesticides Carson deemed most harmful were either more\ncarefully regulated or completely outlawed (\"The Powerboat and the Planet,\" 1999). Many people credit her as the\ncatalyst of the modern environmental movement.\nLike Rachel Carson, you as a social scientist have knowledge that would alleviate many of the world\u2019s ills. Make us\nhear you. Well, I guess we can\u2019t make people listen, but a strong style can make it easier\u2014even fun. Even pesticides.\nReferences\nCarson, R. (2002). Silent Spring.

You\u2019ve got some nice words to say about something important. You\u2019ve successfully accomplished\nstep one, that is, having something to say and saying it well. Step two is how you present your writing. Is it readable? Is\nit easy to scan and understand? Basically, does your writing convert a viewer into a reader? Visual design is the key to\nturning someone into a reader. Just as there are principles in writing that establish structure and appeal such as\ncharacter (ethos), emotion (pathos), and evidence and reasoning (logos), visual design is no different. There are three\nmain principles to consider when visually designing your text: font choice, space, and scale or hierarchy.\nQuote\n\u201cOnly when the design fails does it call attention to itself; when it succeeds, it\u2019s invisible.\" --\ntypographer John D. Berry.\n113 We\u2019ll discuss how these three design principles will make your visual design invisible, and in so doing, succeed at\nconveying the weight of your words.\n6.2 PRINCIPLE 1: FONTS\nThe word font is often synonymous with the word typeface today. A typeface, however, is a design of type like Times\nNew Roman or Arial, whereas font refers to the various styles of a typeface, like bold, 16pt, italicized, etc. For the\npurpose of this section though, we will use the word font to refer to different styling of written words.\nFonts are to written language as accents are to audible speech. Oftentimes, the accent carries more communicative\npower than the content being verbalized. The same goes for fonts. Fonts are conduits to convey tone before a word is\never read. And in today\u2019s world, people don\u2019t like to read too much, so font choice is pretty important. As Roger Black,\nfounder of the Font Bureau, boldly stated, \u201cMake it easy to read.\u201d\nThere are two common families of fonts that many people have heard of at some point\u2014serif and sans serif.\nSans serif shown in Neue Helvetica 48 pt. Serif shown in Bodoni 48 pt.\nSerif\nSerif fonts have been used in print for centuries. The serif, or tail that extends from the main stroke, leads the eye to the\nnext letter, helping to group letters to become words more easily. It has traditionally been used for body copy or the\ncopy that makes up a paragraph, however, this trend has evolved with the advent of the internet. You\u2019ll notice this book\ndoesn\u2019t use serif fonts for paragraphs (We\u2019ll discuss this more in the sans serif section). When using serif fonts, viewers\nimmediately get a sense of historicity, professionalism, and formality. Use serif fonts to elevate your words if you want\nthem to appear more sophisticated.\n114 Serif font with serifs highlighted.\nSans Serif\nThese are fonts without tails, or serifs (the word \u201csans\u201d literally means \u201cwithout\u201d). If fonts wore clothes, sans serifs\nwould be buck naked. The first sans serif font made its appearance in the early 19th century and then caught on with\npopularity in headlines and poster advertisements. For this reason, sans serif fonts tend to carry a sense of modernity\nwith them. They connote \u201cprogress and emphasize the future, which is why aerospace, technology, medicine, and\nbiotech companies adopted sans serifs early on.\u201d (Monotype)\nIf you want to communicate a sense of modernity, sleekness, boldness or even approachability in your words, a sans\nserif would make a great choice.\nWeb Fonts\nFonts eventually were translated from print to web, which were technically sans serif due to low pixel count. As screen\nresolution increased with denser pixel count, more detail could be added to web fonts. This took years though, which is\nwhy sans serif fonts are so ubiquitous on the web. However, today both serif and sans serif are used extensively on the\nweb. It\u2019s a great time to be a Typophile! As co-founder of Fonts in Use, Stephen Cole noted, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a good\ntypographer if you aren\u2019t a good reader.\u201d I would also argue that you become a more effective writer as you become\nmore knowledgeable about typography. There are other font types including display and script. Display fonts are often\ncustom and carry unique personalities.\n115 The font used for the word Jump is considered a display font. This type of font would not be good to use in a paragraph\nat small scales. It is meant to be displayed at larger sizes. Logo and card design: Brian Collier\nScript fonts originate from handwriting, both print and cursive and can be quite useful and beautiful.\n116 A proper use of Script Font in a logo (wordmark). Custom Script designed by Brian Collier\nHowever, if you use poorly crafted script fonts to express a very generic phrase or idea and apply it in vinyl on the wall of\nyour home, I will fail you. This is simply tacky and you\u2019re better than that.\n117 This is a poor use of a script font. It is illegible, the space between words is too great and it looks tacky. Yes, I know, this\nis the opinion of this chapter's author. I want you to know there are better options out there. Photo source.\nHere are some great resources for finding and becoming familiar with fonts of all kinds.\n1. Typewolf: What\u2019s trending in type.\n2. Google Fonts: A vast library of free fonts. It\u2019s hard to find a horrible font here.\n3. Font Squirrel: Free quality fonts. Beware, not all fonts are created equal here.\n4. Typographica: A blog for seeing how type is analyzed.\n5. I Love Typography: Another blog for lessons on type.\nGeneral Rules for Using Fonts\nNow that we\u2019ve introduced where to find some good fonts, let\u2019s talk about the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of using them.\n1. Don't use too many fonts. Our brains like simple. Our cerebral organ loves to find shortcuts to free up space to\ncompute new ideas. Fonts help train our brains. Too many fonts force us to try to find associations with the font's use\nthat may not be there.\n118 2. Keep it consistent. This goes hand in hand with not using too many fonts. Of the fonts you do use, keep their usage\nconsistent. This creates a pattern. Again, the brain functions on patterns. Good user experience involves establishing\npatterns.\n3. Mix your styles. This follows the principle of contrast. Contrast is just one principle to help provide context. Mix a\nserif with a sans serif for best contrast. Mix fonts too similar to one another and it will only cause confusion. People\nneed to be told what is important.\n4. Don\u2019t be blind to the color blind. This is called accessibility. Can those who have color blindness still read what\nyou\u2019ve written? When using color, use this checker to verify there is sufficient contrast in the colors you\u2019ve chosen.\n5. Watch your weight. That\u2019s not a negative comment on body image. Fonts have weights too. Some are thin and some\nare thick. And yes, they are called weights. When you bold a font, that would be considered a heavier font. As a rule of\nthumb, don\u2019t deviate from 'normal' on body text, to ensure you keep text readable. Reserve heavier weights for headlines\nand emphasizing certain words in a paragraph (like the bolded words in this paragraph).\n6. Be aware of the accent. Remember, fonts are like accents. They carry distinctive communication before a word is\never read. Take a look at some of these words in fonts that don\u2019t necessarily match personalities.\n119 For example, \"formal dinner\" wouldn't usually be written in a casual, handwriting font--the font choice creates a\ndisconnect. Or more interestingly, the tone of \"Wrestling Match's\" font is what most people would consider a\nstereotypical, girl-oriented, frilly font and might create a disconnect with some people who consider wrestling a beefy,\nmacho, male-oriented sport. As you can see, fonts can even reveal societal biases!\nWhen Bill Dawson was asked why we need so many typefaces, He replied, \u201cDo we need so many books? Do we need\nanother painting? Do we need so many songs? Do we need another movie?\u201d The answer is yes. Type is what meaning\nlooks like. It will add an extra layer of communication and intention to your writing. To use type well is to truly\nunderstand what you are trying to convey.\n6.3 PRINCIPLE 2: SPACE\nSpace defines relationships. Basically, the amount of space between two elements defines the relationship between\nthem. The closer two objects are to each other, the more likely they are related to each other. When designing your text,\nyou must be aware of the space between letters, between words, between paragraphs, between headlines, and even the\nmargins and gutters. Knowing how to utilize these spaces intentionally will communicate to your reader how to\nassociate and process the information provided.\nThis is Dave Matthews of the Dave Matthews Band. He comments on spacing between words. Listen to his song\n\"Space Between\":\n120 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Wi9HjkJ3L5Y\nThanks, Dave, for teaching us the design principle of proximity. :) How about now I just show you what I\u2019m talking about.\nReady? Here we go!\nThe small space between lines makes the whole lines look like a single group (leading)\nToo much space means no relation\n121 Space can separate or connect elements. Icons on the card together make it seem like a group of actions. Icon isolated\nmake it seem more important (Empashis) than the other actions\n122 Space can add clarity instead of confusion.\nAdd space and it defines the relationship\nSpace can make things more legible. A general rule for space between lines (aka line height) is 130%-150% of the font\nsize. For example, if I have a font size of 16 pt, I might want to set my line height to 24pt. Also, please set your body\ncopy to 16pt. Your mobile readers will thank you.\n123 Space can create hierarchy. Space can attract the eye to more important info.\n124 Learn to see space first if you want to control it. Don\u2019t focus on the elements, focus on all the area around it and the\nrelationships it creates.\nWant to see the importance of space? Tryremovingit,amirite?\n6.4 PRINCIPLE 3: SCALE\nSize. Creating hierarchy is the process of using scale or size of multiple elements in a composition. In writing, you\ndevelop a hierarchy of ideas such as stories, chapters, paragraphs, and sentences. How will you visually treat these\nideas to clearly communicate the separation or association of common ideas, or the ideas within a larger idea? Scale,\nof course. You thought I wasn\u2019t going to give you the answer? Come on, who do you think I am?\nHeadings as Navigational Tools\nWe\u2019ve been trained to have shorter attention spans for reading. Therefore, depending on the what and to whom you\u2019re\nwriting, you\u2019ll want to consider creating an easily skimmable document. You can typically do this by using headlines.\nTypically in website design, there is a hierarchy of headings used: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5. H stands for header.\nHere\u2019s an example of the scale of each header.\n125 Example of website typographic hierarchy of different sized headlines.\nExample of multiples Headers being used in context. Layout Design and Yoda artwork by Brian Collier\nWhat if words aren\u2019t enough? What if you need to communicate with numbers?\n126 6.5 Communicating with Numbers\nSo far you\u2019ve learned how to format and stylize your words. Words are just a collection of individual glyphs. A glyph is a\ncharacter or symbol. Letters are glyphs. Numbers are also glyphs, as they are symbols for separate, distinct ideas.\nHere\u2019s an example of every glyph that has been designed in the Helvetica font.\nFull Glyph Set for Helvetica Font designed by Monotype\nRemember, English isn\u2019t the only language a font has to be designed for. Characters exist in other languages that don\u2019t\nbelong to the English speakers' character set, but numbers are a bit more universal between languages. Let\u2019s dive into\nhow to use numeric glyphs effectively.\nTable and Figures\nTables and figures are common ways to showcase a numeric data set. According to APA Guidelines, tables are\n\u201cnumerical values or text displayed in rows and columns.\u201d A figure is \u201cany type of illustration (chart, graph, photograph,\ndrawing maps...) other than a table.\u201d\nHow to Choose\nRemember, clarity above all. If it\u2019s hard to write, it\u2019s hard to read. If it\u2019s hard to display, it\u2019s hard to compare and digest. Do\nnot use tables and figures to simply decorate your presentation. Decoration is not design because it lacks purpose or\nintent. The visualization of data should always punctuate the point you are trying to make with credible information.\nTables are ideal for showing raw data, or data that has not been analyzed in a way to imply a comparison or conclusion\nof relationships between data variables. Though it requires more analytical brainpower, readers can more liberally draw\n127 their own conclusions from tables.\nFigures are ideal when visualizing data results that have been analyzed for relationships between variables. They come\nin the form of graphs, charts, drawings, photos, or maps. Figures tell more explicitly what the reader should deduct from\nthe data presented.\nBecause figures are so varying, here are a few guidelines to follow when using them.\n1. Pick the right graph\nHere are a few examples of popular graph types and the pros and cons of using them.\nPie Charts\n128 great for categorical data.\nA circle is divided into segments, with each segment representing a category of data adding up to 100%.\nNot great if there are too many categories or the category percentages are too similar.\nBest used when you have 5 or fewer categories to showcase with greater variation in segment percentages.\nPictographs/Infographics\nGraphs for comparing data using pictures.\nGreat for general audiences as they simply convey trends.\nNot great for scientific data as it\u2019s hard to convey minute differences in numbers.\nThese graphs tend to generalize numbers to show larger trends.\nLine Graphs\nThese are some of the most popular graphs because they are easy to make and easy to understand.\nLine graphs are great when portraying change in magnitude over time.\nThe X-axis usually represents time with data points plotted and connected with a line.\nThe Y-axis can represent a number of data, but always when showing change in magnitude.\nBar Graphs\nThese are similar to line graphs in that they show time-series data, but using bars instead of lines.\nBar graphs are great for comparing data and can be displayed with vertical or horizontal bars.\nVertical bar graphs are best used for time comparison and frequency data.\nRemember they typically don\u2019t leave room for text labels though.\nHorizontal bar graphs accommodate longer text labels.\n2. Don\u2019t use legends unnecessarily\nQuote\n\"Remember kid . . . Heroes get remembered; legends never die.\u201d --The Great Bambino to Benny \u201cThe Jet\u201d\nRodriguez in the movie The Sandlot\nWell, Mr. Bambino, we say sometimes you need to kill the legend, especially if there is only one category. Legends\nrequire more eye jumping, more association, more mental work. If you have multiple categories, consider using a\nlegend. Many times, you can label categories right next to the data, like in a line graph.\n129 3. Highlight supporting details and suppress others.\nHighlights provide contrast. Mitch Hedberg, the stand-up comedian, once astutely observed, \u201cI got highlights because I\nthink some of my hairs are more important than others.\u201d When working with graphs, it\u2019s typically because you\u2019re trying\nto make a point. If the data helps support it well, highlight that detail to contrast obvious differences in data\ncomparison. Using color is a great way of highlighting data.\n4. Don\u2019t introduce unnecessary complexity.\nKeep it simple. Don\u2019t use more lines than necessary and don\u2019t highlight frames, just the data.\n130 Conclusion\nIt\u2019s not enough to be a great writer. You must be a great presenter if you are to increase the chances of people reading\nyour words or understanding your ideas. Visual design is essential in accomplishing this goal. Remember, if it\u2019s hard to\nwrite, it\u2019s hard to read. If it\u2019s hard to look at, it\u2019s hard to read. Your job is to uncover the unseen and articulate it. Part of\nthat is to learn how to choose good fonts, utilize space intentionally, and establish hierarchy of information by using\nscale.\n131 Brian Collier\nNuvi\nBrian Collier currently works as Vice President of Marketing & Brand at Nuvi, a social marketing software\ncompany in Lehi, UT.

Haupt\nLearning Outcomes\nIn this chapter students will learn\nthe difference between academic audiences and general audiences.\nhow to observe and understand the discourse community of a certain field\nthe characteristics of academic writing including\nacademic genres\nstyle guides\nscholarly voice\n135 7.1 How to Write for Academic Audiences\nHere comes the sad bride. Photo from Picqsels.com.\nI promise, my husband and I didn't try to ruin his brother's wedding. In our defense, Andre and Emily [names have been\nchanged to protect the people who are still mad] got married five days after us, and in all the hubbub with two weddings\nin the family, no one actually remembered to give us their formal wedding invitation. Let me add that my husband and I\neven decided to postpone our honeymoon and stay in the local area for a whole week just so we could attend their\nwedding, so we should get some points for that.\nWell, we stayed in a town in the mountains that was a lot farther away from downtown Salt Lake City than we'd realized.\nSo by the time we arrived at the wedding, everyone had been sitting there waiting for 45 minutes\u2014and they'd just sent\nthe oldest brother Mike down the hallway to do one last check to see if we'd finally shown up. (You've probably figured\nout that these were the days before cell phones.)\nWe ran around the corner in the nick of time, yelled out to Mike, and followed him, running our fastest down the hallways\nand stairs to the wedding even though I was wearing a fitted pink dress and heels and my husband was in a fancy, dark\nsuit. We ran into the room huffing and puffing and looked around apologetically only to see all our family members\u2014\ndressed completely in white. Apparently, Andre and Emily had decided it would be a beautiful idea to have everyone\nwear white to their wedding, but no one had thought to tell us\u2014so there we were for the rest of the ceremony, looking\nlike two ugly weeds in a field of exquisite flowers. And because we were late, we had to walk past everyone and sit in\nthe front row, invading everyone's view including the bride and groom's. To this day, Andre and Emily think we ruined\ntheir moment on purpose out of jealousy for having our weddings so close together, but I promise it was just that we\nwere ill-informed. You've got to believe me!\n136 We stuck out worse than this flower. #weddingfail Photo by Rupert Britton on Unsplash\nWhy do I bring up this painful story, you ask? Because it illustrates the point of this chapter. Remember in Chapter 1\nwhen we talked about discourse communities and the word \"shibboleth\" as an indicator that someone doesn't belong to\na group? You guessed it. My husband and I obviously didn't belong in the \"apparently-now-it's-okay-to-wear-white-to-a-\nwedding\" group and wished we'd been better informed. If only we'd done our homework (read the invitation and looked\nat a map) and learned to say the proverbial \"sh\" in shibboleth before we were socially obliterated that day with mean\nglares and long, sad sighs in our direction.\nIt turns out academic audiences care about style, too. If everyone else in your field uses careful, formal language and\nrigid organizational formats and you waltz in with casual slang and ideas that don't always make sense, you're not going\nto go very far. Now don't get me wrong\u2014in academic writing, some diversion from the norm is tolerated, but you have to\nearn it.\n137 Before developing this unique style, Picasso studied conventional painting techniques at the best art school in Spain.\nViolon (Violin) by Pablo Picasso.\nDid you know the artist Pablo Picasso went to the best art school in Spain and learned how to paint very traditional\npaintings before developing his unique, convention-altering style? (Google \"Picasso early paintings\" if you don't believe\nme.) He first needed the skills and understanding of what the norm was in his field in order to break those conventions\nand create a new style in response. You, too, should spend time listening to and observing the conversations going on in\nyour field so you can learn the lingo\u2014the jargon\u2014and understand the conventions people use. Not because you want to\nsimply conform, but rather, so that you can understand your audience and know the best ways to get your message\nacross and be heard. And if you want to change the conventions along the way, go for it. But you're more likely to have\nan influence if you first learn what the standards are.\nIt's All About Character\nThe trick to writing for academic audiences resides in the concept of Character. For more on character, see Chapter 2:\nWriting Tools. When you want to contribute to an academic discourse community, they have to believe that you know\nwhat you're talking about, that you're trustworthy, that you're logically minded, that you have good character. Some\npeople have an advantage with things like PhD's and publications that indicate they can be trusted. But what can an\ninexperienced undergrad do to convince other academics to listen? I think the best answer is to act like a spy.\n138 Learning about your field is a lot like being a spy. Photo by Nathan Dumlao on Unsplash\nGood spies gather intel before going out in public. They listen to the conversation stream, observe, practice. Then once\nthey're out in the field, they fake it 'till they make it. As they go, they learn the tricks and language that bring them to be\naccepted into a group. In fact, spying and writing are so similar that some of the world's best writers were spies and\nsome of the best spies became writers (see Ernest Hemingway, John Le Carre, Ian Fleming, and W. Somerset\nMaugham, for example).\nSo start your observations. Notice the language and structure as you read research articles for a class assignment.\nNote the levels of formality in the scholarly articles and books you read in your field. Join LinkedIn and start following\nbig names in your field. Listen to the way your professors talk and write. Keep a \"Jargon journal\" where you list words\nyou notice are specific to your field.\nAnother way to learn is by doing\u2014by writing all those beloved research papers you've been assigned in the past. It turns\nout all those assignments to gather reliable sources and use formal language were an effort to prepare you for\nacademic writing. Can you believe the reason that your teachers have been assigning you research papers for years\nwas not because they hate your guts but because they actually care about your guts? It turns out research papers are\ndesigned to help you practice the most important characteristics of academic writing. Let's talk more about those\ncharacteristics.\n139 7.2 What Sets Academic Writing Apart?\nI love this picture from 1962 of researchers collaborating at the National Cancer Institute. Photo by National Cancer\nInstitute on Unsplash\nWriting for Academic Audiences is also known as \"scholarly writing\" and is, therefore, meant to be read by scholars in a\nparticular field. It usually involves research of some kind\u2014whether it's written to record the data in an experiment (like a\nlab journal), or to request research funding (a grant proposal), to review what's been done in the field (a literature\nreview), or to compose a final write-up of one's experimental results (a research article).\nAnother way to define academic writing is to talk about what it's not. It's not the kind of writing found in popular\nsources such as online newspapers, blogs, magazines, Instagram, or Twitter\u2014those are all intended for a \"general\naudience\" or a \"popular audience\" composed of people in general, not in a specific field.\nHere's a comparison of how writing for a general audience differs from academic writing:\nGeneral Audience vs. Academic Audience\nShort paragraphs vs. Long paragraphs\nEngaging, friendly tone vs. Serious, academic tone\nLogical progression/light referencing vs. Synthesized claims, heavy\nreferencing\nClever wording to encourage insight vs. Clarity to avoid misunderstanding\n140 Focus on practical application vs. Focus on knowledge and scientific\nadvancement\nPassionate writing with conviction vs. Objective writing with solid backing\nFocus on narrative and relevance to vs. Focus on data, methods, and results\naudience\nMost appeals are to emotions and vs. Most appeals are to logic and\nauthority/character authority/character\nHyperlinks or endnotes for vs. In-text citations and reference lists in\nreferences APA format (or another style guide)\nAcademic vs. General Audiences\nGive an example of something you've read recently that was written for an academic audience (like a research\narticle, lab report, scholarly book, etc.). Now explain at least three ways the academic text was different than\nsomething you've recently read that was written for a general audience (online newspaper, blog, Instagram,\netc.).\n141 7.3 Shortcuts in Academic Writing\nScholars have developed shortcuts to make it easier to share information in their field. Haven't you always wanted a\nshortcut like this? #bookshelfdoor Photo by Stefan Steinbauer on Unsplash\nAs scholars have communicated over the years, people in specific fields began using shortcuts like shared vocabulary\nwords (jargon) or uniform organization to make it easier to understand and/or access the most important information\nin their field. These shortcuts have developed when a discourse community has needed a standard way of doing\nsomething.\nGenre\n142 A message in a bottle: probably not the best format for a letter of recommendation. Photo by Charlotte Noelle on\nUnsplash\nMany of these agreed-upon shortcuts have now turned into their own Genres or expected ways of formatting a\ndocument. For example, if you ask your professor to recommend you to a graduate program, you expect them to write a\nformal letter of recommendation rather than, say, a text message or a message in a bottle. And, in fact, the formality\nand rigid organization of the letter of recommendation themselves signal to the audience that this is an official\nstatement, that it should be taken much more seriously than a text message (or bottle message), and that the author\nhas put significant thought and time into the document. The choice of genre alone is a sign to the audience of the\ndocument's context and purpose.\nSo just like you keep a \"jargon journal,\" start paying attention to and noting the genres you see used most in your field as\nwell. For instance, you might have noticed that the typical format for a research article follows the IMRAD Format:\nIntroduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This format was developed by the scientific community to report\nresearch results because it makes it very easy to find information fast. Scholarly readers know they'll always find the\nreview of literature in the Introduction section and a summary of the data analysis in the Results section. This also\nmakes it easy to compare across several articles like to analyze the techniques reported in the Methods section of\nseveral articles. For more tips on reading and interpreting IMRAD articles, see Chapter 8: Finding and Evaluating\nSources.\nPeer-Reviewed Journals\nAs people began reporting on their research, they needed venues in which to show others what they learned. So groups\nof scholars created specialized journals where people could publish their research for others to see. Every field has\nmany academic journals like The Journal of Neuroscience, Progress in Human Geography, or The Annual Review of\n143 Public Health where the main scholarly conversations are happening today\u2014and most have very high standards. To\nkeep their standards high, the editors of journals use the peer review process where all articles are reviewed by two or\nmore experts who give feedback on such things as the quality of the research, the caliber of the methodology, the\naccuracy of the results, and even the style of the writing. This feedback then goes back to the authors who revise and\nresubmit their articles until they're accepted for publication. (I hope this reminds you of the revision process we talked\nabout in Chapter 3: Writing Processes.)\nStyle Guides\nNot that kind of Style Guide\u2014style as in writing. Photo by Alexandra Gorn on Unsplash\nThese journals also brought about another shortcut for scholars: a set standard for the style of writing. When people\nsubmit articles for review to be published in an academic journal, they have to make a lot of decisions about the style of\ntheir writing. (See Chapter 5: Style for a thorough discussion of the stylistic decisions writers make.) How would you\nknow if you should include an Oxford Comma\u2014a comma in a list after the word \"and\"\u2014or if headings should be bolded\nor if you need to include a title page and an abstract? Many of these decisions are arbitrary (they don't matter very much\nin the grand scheme of things), but not all of them are\u2014and either way, a decision still has to be made.\nLuckily, academic journals started publishing the answers to these questions in \"Style Guides\" so people wouldn't have\nto ask all the nitpicky questions. One of the most famous style guides came in 1929 from the American Psychological\nAssociation (APA). This guide has gone through many editions (the 2019 7th edition is the most recent) and has\nbecome the standard for most of the social sciences today. (For more information on APA style, see Chapter 9: Talking\nAbout Sources). The APA Manual delineates all the minute as well as the major standards they've decided on for the\nsocial sciences including everything from a specific way to cite sources (year first, then the author's name, etc.) to\nwhether or not to use the Oxford Comma (yes) to an entire section on how to avoid biased language. In fact, it was a big\ndeal when the lastest edition announced a change from requiring two spaces after every period to one. (You can see\nhow nerdy things can get over at the APA!)\n144 And even though the APA decided on certain standards, that doesn't mean all style guides are the same. For example,\nthe Chicago Manual of Style (CMS) (or the closely related Turabian style) is used in some social sciences like history,\nand the American Sociological Association Style Guide is used in\u2014you guessed it\u2014sociology. Even businesses and\nuniversities can have a style guide to keep things standardized in all their publications. For instance, here's a link to my\nuniversity's style guide for how to use their logo properly. So my point isn't which style guide is better, but rather, that you\nshould figure out which style guide is used most in your field and follow that. It will provide many of the shortcuts to\nyour discourse community.\nAnd don't forget that teachers can have their own preferences when it comes to style. If you've ever written a paper and\ndidn't know whether or not you needed a title page, then you know what I'm talking about. The best way to figure out\nwhat your teacher expects stylistically is to read the assignment instructions; they probably tell you which style to follow\nfor citations (APA, Turabian, ASA, etc.). And if you can't find the answer, just ask your teacher.\nScholarly Voice\nOne final note on writing for academic audiences is to pay attention to the formality of your language. Again, much of\nwhat you need to know about writing style is covered in your style guide and in Chapter 5: Style. But I just want to\nemphasize one last thing that sets apart academic writing: voice.\nLinguist Averil Coxhead at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand compiled The Academic Word List, a list of the\n570 word families that appear most frequently in academic texts but not in general texts. Here's a list of the top 60\nwords from that list of academic words. Read through them and ask yourself why these words are used much more in\nscholarly works than in general texts.\nAnalyze, Approach, Area, Assess, Assume, Authority, Available, Benefit, Concept, Consist, Constitute,\nContext, Contract, Create, Data, Define, Derive, Distribute, Economy, Environment, Establish, Estimate,\nEvident, Export, Factor, Finance, Formula, Function, Identify, Income, Indicate, Individual, Interpret, Involve,\nIssue, Labor, Legal, Legislate, Major, Method, Occur, Percent, Period, Policy, Principle, Proceed, Process,\nRequire, Research, Respond, Role, Section, Sector, Significant, Similar, Source, Specific, Structure, Theory,\nVary\nAcademic Word List\nChoose 3 words from the Academic Word List (above) and explain why you think they specifically are used\nmuch more frequently in academic texts than in general texts.\nI hope you can see that precision, clarity, and formality are favored in academic writing. Each of those words helps\nwriters describe something very specific. You probably don't use the word \"method\" much in your daily life but when\nyou're describing how you set up an experiment, it would come up frequently. I hope you're getting a feel for how much\nmore specific and formal academic writing is than other kinds of writing.\n145 Ready for prom, not a pool party. Photo by Nqobile Vundla on Unsplash\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean that you need to lose your \u201cvoice\u201d when you write for an academic audience; rather, you\nsimply need to elevate your language, formalize it. Just as you wouldn\u2019t wear a tuxedo to a pool party, you wouldn\u2019t wear\na swimsuit to the prom (at least, I hope you wouldn\u2019t). But no matter what you wear, you're still you.\nThe same goes for writing. You can still be you and write in a more formal style\u2014it just means that you need to take\nadvantage of higher-level skills like using vocabulary from your field, adding strong transitions between sentences and\nparagraphs, and incorporating reliable evidence. (For more help with this, again see Chapter 5: Style). But be careful; this\nsophistication can be done to a fault.\nI had a friend in high school who would write with the biggest, most abstruse words she could find (like the word\n\"abstruse\") and put them in long, complicated sentences\u2014and it paid off in the form of good grades on papers. Her high\nschool teachers were impressed by her vocabulary and sophistication compared to her peers, but when she got to\ncollege, she was surprised to find out that it didn\u2019t impress her college teachers. That\u2019s because they could see through\nit\u2014her writing was inauthentic. They could tell that she was adding complication to sound sophisticated but it actually\ngave the impression of trying too hard. This friend had to learn to keep her own voice and focus more on clarity and\ncohesion rather than complication. Similarly, to be a good academic writer, you need to focus on precise writing, not\ncomplex writing.\nCan You Use \"I\" in Academic Writing?\nAlong with the tendency to be complex comes the tendency to obscure your voice through the Passive Voice (\"It was\ndone\" rather than \"I did it\") and Third Person (using he/she rather than first person \"I\"). Although older professors still\nbelieve that you should not refer to yourself as \"I\" in formal papers, this standard has been changing. It's now accepted\nand sometimes encouraged in most fields to use the term \"I\" (see the APA Manual of Style).\n146 7.4 A Word About This Textbook\nNow before you go accusing us of talking the talk and not walking the walk, please note that we deliberately wrote this\ntextbook in a casual, conversational style that's also decidedly not \"academic.\" In Chapter 14: Writing for General\nAudiences, we'll talk in depth about why we made this choice, but we hope that by now you can tell that this textbook is\nnot in an academic, scholarly, serious style. We would hate for you to model your academic papers after our casual\nstyle\u2014instead, please recognize that when you're reporting on research, you have a different Rhetorical Situation than\nwe have in this book.\nYour purpose in an academic paper is to make a formal, logical argument for your professor to show how well you've\nresearched a topic while our purpose in this book is to teach college students about writing in an engaging manner that\nhopefully doesn't put you to sleep. So please look to texts in your field, your professors' assignment instructions, and the\nstudent examples in this book to help you gauge the right level of formality for your academic writing. But once you go\non Instagram or Twitter, feel free to be as casual as you want!\nLooking Ahead\nIn high school you did baby research. Photo by Janko Ferlic on Unsplash\nThe chapters in this unit about Writing for Academic Audiences revolve around analysis and research because\nacademic writing usually revolves around\u2014guess what? Analysis and research. In high school and in your first-year\ncollege writing course, you most likely learned how to write a basic research paper. You learned how to think of an\nargument, turn it into a thesis statement, find quotes that matched your thesis statement, and restate your thesis in your\nconclusion. Maybe you even learned how to write the infamous \"five-paragraph essay.\" You probably also figured out\nhow to write in a more formal tone. Those are all good skills you've honed. But they're baby skills.\n147 Now you should do grown-up research. Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\nNow that you're an adult, we want to take your research and analysis skills to the next level. The tragic flaw of typical\nresearch papers is that they actually don't teach you how to do good research. Instead, they teach you how to make an\nargument and justify your argument with quotes you find to support that argument. You don't actually have to know\nwhat's going on, what the state of the field is\u2014you just have to find sources that match what you're trying to say. But\nthat's not how real-world research works.\nMature scholars start their research by looking at what's been done, they analyze what's out there and figure out where\nthe gaps and limitations are in current research, then they make their arguments and plans for future research based on\nwhat they found. FYI, this is something undergraduates are notoriously bad at.\nSo we're going to focus the rest of this Unit 2: Writing for Academic Audiences on skills that will flex the most important\nresearch and writing muscles you're missing. Chapters 8-12 will focus on finding and evaluating sources, talking about\nsources, learning about the genre of the literature review\u2014a specific kind of research paper, and following the steps for\ncreating a sophisticated literature review. Then in chapter 13, we'll show you how to propose a research project that will\nfill in gaps in current research.\nSo don't be like my husband and me and embarrass yourself in a big way; do your homework and get informed before\nputting yourself out there so that when you have something to say, you can confidently enter the conversation and\npeople will not only admire your style, they'll listen to what you have to say.\n148 Cristie Cowles Charles\nBrigham Young University\nCristie Cowles Charles teaches writing and literature courses at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. She\nenjoys sparking a love for writing in her students--or at least a love for having had written (it's always worth it in\nthe end, right?). She thinks pumpkin pie counts as a vegetable, is married to a super hot mechanical engineering\nand neuroscience professor (yes, they exist), and adores her five magnificent children.\nJulie H.

(Public Domain)\nI live in the high desert mountains of the West surrounded by ranchers and cowboys. Cowboys and cowgirls are tough.\nFinding and evaluating sources is tough. So I'm going to teach you how to find and evaluate sources western style, like\na cowboy or cowgirl. So you can be tough, too.\n8.1 Why Research?\nIf a cowgirl wants to buy a horse, she first decides what kind she wants\u2014there's a big difference between a hard-\nworking quarter horse and a tall, speedy thoroughbred. Then she finds out who's selling, checks out the horse's\ncondition, learns about its heritage, tries it out, and sees how it behaves in different situations. In other words, she does\nher research. We, too, spend our lives doing research\u2014whether we realize it or not. For example, between Yelp!,\nRotten Tomatoes, Consumer Reports, and Amazon reviews, it seems like we're always trying to find the best products\nand the best deals. When we have questions, we go to Wikipedia or ask Siri or Alexa for answers. Never in the history\nof the world have we had so many resources literally at our fingertips.\nQuote\n\"Google is turning 18 years old this year. I cannot believe it was just 19 years ago that I never\nresearched anything ever.\"\n\u2014Comedian Kellen Erskine, \"Composed\" Dry Bar Comedy on VidAngel\n152 The trick is, how do you know you're getting the best answers to your questions? How can you tell if you're using the\nbest sources of information or if the information you find is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date? These days you even\nhave to ask yourself if the information you find has been planted by Russian hackers trying to influence your political\nopinion. The problem with a glut of resources is that it's become increasingly hard to find reliable information, which is\nwhy doing good research is becoming a necessary life skill, not just a school skill. It's especially true in the social\nsciences that if you know how to conduct good research, you will be more influential no matter which field you go into.\nAnd so I give you The Cowboy and Cowgirl's Guide to Finding and Evaluating Sources with all the steps you'll need to\nfind solid answers to your questions.\n8.2 Step One: Choose Yer Horse (Select a Topic)\nA Cowgirl wants to choose the best horse for the job, just like you should choose your best topic. (Public Domain)\nMy kids call their grandpa \"Cowboy Phil\" because he wears a big custom-made hat, likes to go on cattle drives, and\ntaught my kids how to ride a horse. He also taught them that it matters what kind of horse you choose.\n153 Quote\n\"You pick your horse based on the work at hand. But above all, you've got to really know your horse and make\nsure it knows you're the boss.\"\n\u2014Cowboy Phil\nNow stop for a second and turn on this authentic cowboy music by Brenn Hill called \"Equine\" about the importance of\nhorses in a cowboy's life. Keep this on as background music as you read on. It'll really give you the cowboy/cowgirl\nspirit.\nWatch on YouTube\nAuthentic Cowboy Musician Brenn Hill sings \"Equine.\" https://youtu.be/QPiWJzfqejY\nOn a ranch, when the summer days get shorter and the weather turns chilly, that means it's time for the Fall Roundup.\nThe cows pasture for the summer in the mountains eating the delicious grass and breathing the clean air. But once it\ngets colder, they need to be rounded up and brought back down to the ranch.\nYou can't round up cattle without a good horse, so the first step of a roundup is to gather all the horses together from\nthe remuda (all the horses on a ranch) so everyone can collect their horses. Each cowboy or cowgirl has their string\u2014or\ngroup\u2014of five or six horses that eachhave different strengths and weaknesses. This string of horses has a lot of\nimportant jobs to do along the way\u2014some are better at long distances, some are better at bursts of speed\u2014but in the\nend, the horse you choose is the most important because it has to be your partner on your journey. As Cowboy Phil\nsays, you choose your horse based on the task at hand. You consider your horses' strengths and weaknesses\u2014their\npotential\u2014and then choose the best one to take on the road.\n154 How do you choose the best horse for your journey? Photo by Vidar Nordli-Mathisen on Unsplash\nChoosing your topic for the journey of writing any kind of research paper should begin with similar consideration and\ncare. You want to choose your research topic wisely; you don't want to invest a lot of time, energy, and resources into\nresearching a topic for a long paper unless it has a lot of potential and is something you like enough to stick with for the\nlong haul.\nQuote\n\"A good horse costs just as much to feed as a bad one.\" \u2014Cowboy Wisdom\nIn a typical advanced writing class, you'll probably be asked to spend a significant amount of time on this topic: you'll\nlikely create an extensive literature review looking at what others have said about your topic. You'll perhaps write a\nproposal based on it and/or give an oral presentation or poster presentation explaining this topic to your peers.\nSo find something you love, because it won't be worth investing in unless you really love yer horse, er, topic. So what's\nthe best way to choose a topic? Just like on a ranch, you need to do some gathering work first. Gather your string of\nideas to the corral to take a good look at the possibilities.\n155 Background Research\nFirst, get a birds-eye view of your topic. (Public Domain)\nOne of the most overlooked and underrated parts of the research process is doing background research. Students often\nwant to just jump right in to finding sources on a topic\u2014grabbing the first horse they see\u2014but the problem is that no\none can know how good their topic is\u2014especially how wide or narrow it is\u2014until they take a good look at the bigger\npicture.\nGetting a bird's-eye view of your topic will help you understand the context of how your topic fits into your field in\ngeneral and even how important it is to the bigger world. It'll also help you discover what questions are being asked,\nwhat the hot topics are in your field, and where the most promising research is going. All this will help you create a\nbetter research question and streamline your database searches down the road. Watch this quick video on starting the\nresearch process and then we'll talk about options for doing background research.\n156 Watch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/9vkpCvGxgqw\nBrainstorming\nMaybe you're like many of my students and don't even have an idea of what to research or don't really know where to\nstart. Background research is also perfect for exploring topics and thinking about how your interests can morph into a\ngreat research question. For example, here are some questions you can ask yourself as part of the brainstorming\nprocess:\nWhy did you choose your major in the first place--what topics most excited you?\nCan you think of problems you've heard about in your field that you want to solve?\nCan you remember something you recently heard in a class that sparked your interest?\nWhat's a controversy or question you want to know more about but you don't know the answer to?\nIf you think back on personal problems and questions you've had in your life, how they might relate to your\ndiscipline of study?\nIf you want to be more creative or free in your topic exploration, consider these next strategies:\nFreewriting\nAn easy way to generate ideas is to do a good ol' freewrite\u2014get out a piece of paper or open a blank document on your\ncomputer and time yourself for 5 minutes.\n157 You can do a freewrite on anything from a post-it note to a napkin to a retro typewriter. Photo by Jen Theodore on\nUnsplash\nStart writing about topic ideas and don't let yourself stop writing until the timer goes off. No erasing, no judgment, just\nkeep writing. If you run out of things to say, then write, \"I can't think of anything to say\" until something pops into your\nhead. The trick is to keep writing. You'll often find that ideas start to flow when you suspend judgment like this and just\nlet whatever comes to mind flow out of your pen/keyboard. This is also a good technique to use if you get stuck in the\ndrafting process. Studies have shown that freewriting unlocks the creativity of your brain and helps you think of\nconnections you wouldn't normally make. In fact, some studies have shown it can actually improve your health (see, for\ninstance, Murray, 2002 ), so try it!\nMindmapping\nMindmapping has also been shown to jumpstart your creative juices and help your brain make new connections.\nThere's something about thinking visually rather than just linearly that allows you to explore relationships between\ntopics in a fresh way. In fact, we'll revisit this idea later when we talk about generating ideas for paper organization.\nMindmapping can be done on a piece of paper (the old-school preferred way) or using mindmapping apps or software\nlike Trello, FreeMind, or XMind (new school). In the middle, write a general idea for a topic in the middle and circle it.\nThen draw a line to branch off that idea and write something related to it, etc. Using different colors for different\nbranches can help you visually organize your information. You might be skeptical of this method at first, but just try it.\nYou might be surprised what kind of ideas pop into your head when you see them visually mapped rather than simply\nlisted in a row.\n158 Here's a mindmap for exploring the topic of Digital Storytelling.

Photo by Cristina Gottardi on Unsplash\n159 As basic as it sounds, sometimes just talking out your ideas with another person can help you make connections and\ndiscover new possibilities. Find a buddy, go to one of your professor's office hours, or even ask someone out and talk\nabout topics you're interested in. You can either do like the freewrite and explore ideas with little judgment or you can\nask the other person to give you honest feedback. Sometimes you'll be surprised what you can come up with simply by\narticulating your ideas to another person and hearing feedback from them.\nWikipedia and Google\nWikipedia has more pages than all these books put together. Photo by Ajda Berzin on Unsplash.\nAnother good place to start exploring general topics is probably already one of your go-to sources: Wikipedia. In case\nyou've been living in a cave, Wikipedia is a huge online encyclopedia containing pages that summarize millions of\ntopics. A Wikipedia search can give you a quick sense of the history of a certain topic, who the majors players are, and\nwhat the sub-areas of research are. It can also lead you to related ideas and areas of research you hadn't though of\nbefore. Wikipedia's structure can be helpful to you as well because it breaks down larger discussion into bite-sized sub-\nissues and links out to other related articles. Consider how this organization can help you choose and narrow a topic.\nBecause Wikipedia's not a peer-reviewed publication, you can't use it as a main source for your paper, but most\ninformation on Wikipedia includes references to the original, primary sources, so you can use their references section to\nhelp you locate reliable, peer-reviewed sources that you can use in your paper.\n160 Feel free to spell out the word \"Google\" in M&M's for extra inspiration. Photo by lalo Hernandez on Unsplash\nDoing some general Google searches will also help you see what popular sources and commercial sites address your\ntopic and if it's been in the news lately. Trade journals by professionals in your field are also a good resource. They\nmight have a \"magazine\" feel to them but deal with specific issues within an area of study.\n161 Libraries\nLibraries are buildings that hold books. Try one! You might like it. Photo by Shunya Koide on Unsplash\nAnother option is to (wait for it . . .) physically walk into the library! Did you know people publish field-specific\nencyclopedias and bibliographies and even subject list books\u2014rich resources that are often overlooked (because, you\nknow, you have to walk into the library to see them). Do it!\nThese field-specific books can answer questions that a general internet search can't\u2014questions like these:\nWhich books and articles about a certain topic are the most influential?\nWhat's the current thinking in your field on a particular issue?\nOr what are some synonyms for specific search terms that can make database searching more fruitful (like finding\nout you should be searching for \"emerging adult\" along with \"young adult\")?\nIt's like finding a research shortcut just by taking a walk! You can usually find these in the social sciences section of the\nlibrary in their reference section. Or you can ask any librarian to direct you to these and other rich background sources\nthat are great for exploring topics in your field. Plus, you might get in a few extra steps for the day.\nNote-taking\nAs you explore ideas about your topic, don't forget to take notes about which key words come up, how many references\nare listed, what sub-topics emerge, whose names you see repeatedly, and which areas of research seem especially\nfruitful. You'll thank yourself later in the research process when you use those notes and keywords in your database\nsearching or if you decide you want to change your focus to a different angle or even a different topic.\n162 Quote\n\"A good background researcher sketches out main arguments, sub-topics, and specific language\nthat\u2019s popping up within a wider discussion during the background research stage. This language\nwill become important later when the researcher opens up a database\"\n\u2014Elise Silva, BYU Writing Programs Librarian\nStay organized. If you want to collect your notes into a giant pink heart, go for it. You do you. Photo by Adam Kring on\nUnsplash\nHere's an example of how background research helped Justin, one of my students. At first, Justin decided he wanted to\nstudy the effects of exercise on diseases or aging. But then as he did some background research, he found that there\nwere already tons and tons of articles on that topic. So he brainstormed other ideas, talked to his peers and professors\nabout possibilities, and even sought the help of the Economics subject librarian.\nAfter more exploration, Justin decided to change his focus to the influence of China on the economies of African\ncountries. There were a lot fewer articles on that specific topic, so he knew it was a more fruitful place to put his\nresearch energy. Plus, by changing his topic early on before he spent too much time gathering sources, he saved\nhimself a lot of time in the long run.\n163 A Word on Changing Topics\nRemember: the earlier you change your topic, the less work for you. If your horse is tired or you don't get along, that's\nokay. You can choose another horse from your string\u2014that's why you brought them along. But the sooner you change\nthe better. At a certain point, it becomes too late in the day and you have to just ride your horse to the end of the trail,\ntired or no. By doing good background research now, you can find that great topic fit that will take you all the way into\nthe sunset.\nDo good background research now so you can ride your topic into the sunset. Photo by Helena Lopes on Unsplash\nBackground Research\nNow it's your turn. Brainstorm some ideas and choose a general topic that interests you. (Note that for the\npurposes of this class, your topic should be related to your major or at least fall under the social sciences\numbrella.) Do some background research: read about it on Wikipedia, search it on Google, see if it's been in the\nnews. Pay attention to what sub-areas emerge and who the major players are. Maybe do a freewrite or create a\nmind map to generate more ideas. Then write two or three possibilities for a research topic you want to explore\nfurther in this class.\n164 8.3 Step Two: Saddle Yer Horse (Create a Research Question)\nLike a saddle, a good research question is a helpful tool that can help you rein in your topic. Photo by Jonathan Cosens\nPhotography - JCP on Unsplash\nResearch always starts with a question. It might not always be stated outright, but every time you look something up on\nyour phone, you have a question\u2014there's a gap in your knowledge that you want to fill. Once you have a general sense\nof a topic you're interested in, that's when you're ready to saddle your horse--formulate a more specific research\nquestion. Trust me, you want your horse (topic) to be saddled and ready before you get on the road or you'll be in for a\nbumpy ride.\nQuote\n\u201cYou have to find a better reason than \u2018it\u2019s an assignment\u2019 to devote weeks to your research and\nfor your readers to spend time reading your article. You\u2019ll find that better reason when you can ask\na question whose answer solves a problem that you can convince readers to care about. That\nquestion and problem are what will make readers think your research is worth their time.\u201d from\nThe Craft of Research (Booth, Colomb, and Williams, p. 35)\nIn academia and even in industry, there's a pattern to research:\n165 1. Read what's been done on a topic\n2. Figure out where the gaps of knowledge are (secondary research)\n3. Fill one of those gaps with some kind of action that creates new knowledge\u2014be it a survey, experiment, analysis,\nlongitudinal study, product, etc. (primary research)\n4. Publish the results of that action or create a prototype\n5. Start the process over again\nYour job right now is to do steps 1 and 2\u2014the Secondary Research part of this process: read what's been done on a\ntopic and figure out where the gaps of knowledge are. Then later you might even be asked to propose some primary\nresearch that could fill one of the gaps you find (although there most likely won't be time in this class to actually do the\nprimary research, just to propose it).\nEven this dog has a question.

You might be tempted to skip this step, but if you can take the time\nnow to saddle your horse (by devising a narrow, specific research question), the next stretch of the research process\njourney\u2014database searching\u2014will be much, much easier.\nWatch this quick video about research questions:\n166 Watch on YouTube\nHypothesis\nAlthough, we use the term \"research question,\" it doesn't necessarily have to be in question format; your research\nquestion can be as simple as testing a hypothesis like this one:\n\"I expect that smartphone usage at a young age will increase a child's likelihood of developing anxiety.\"\nEven though this isn't in question format, it's an implied question\u2014we assume that by making this statement, you'll next\ntry to figure out whether your hypothesis is correct. So really, your research question turns into this:\n\"Does smartphone usage at a young age increase a child's likelihood of developing anxiety?\"\nA hypothesis means that you predict the answer to your research question will be \"yes.\" You can create a more open\nended approach where you adopt a posture of openness and curiosity like this:\n\"I wonder if a teacher's appearance has an effect on their students.\"\n167 Will this child's smartphone usage increase his anxiety? Photo by Diego Passadori on Unsplash\nThe \"I wonder\" phrase is also an implied question because presumably the way you'll learn about this topic is to find\nanswers to questions about teacher appearance and student learning. In other words, you don't have to stick to an\nexact formula when developing a research question, but you do need to have a specific area of inquiry in mind.\nWATCO Question\nIf, on the other hand, you like to use formulas, one helpful way to create a research question is to formulate what my\ncolleague Dr. Grant Boswell calls a \"WATCO question.\" WATCO stands for What are the consequences of? Or to be\nmore precise, What are the consequences of something (A) on something else (B)? This format can be very helpful\nbecause it forces you to narrow your topic\u2014and I find students almost always need to narrow their topics more than\nexpand them. As you will see as you begin to search databases for articles and books, the narrower or more specific\nyour research question, the easier it'll be to find answers. Here are some examples of WATCO questions previous\nstudents have asked (they were assigned to come up with three possible questions).\n168 Do you like formulas? Then WATCO Questions are for you. Photo by ThisisEngineering RAEng on Unsplash\nWATCO (what are the consequences of) childhood obesity on:\n1. Self confidence?\n2. Adult health outcomes?\n3. Society?\nWATCO narcissism on:\n1. Adolescent populations?\n2. Adult populations?\n3. Relationships?\nWATCO educational funding on:\n1. Student Performance?\n2. Extracurricular Activities?\n3. School Resources?\nWATCO meritocracy on:\n1. Social mobility?\n2. Higher education?\n3. Relationships?\nWATCO bilingualism on:\n169 1. Infants' differentiation abilities (Between the two languages)?\n2. Cognizant skills as compared with their monolingual peers?\n3. Infants' social skills?\nWATCO a high sugar diet on:\n1. Carcinogenesis?\n2. Metastasis and tumor growth?\n3. Cancer mortality?\nHere are three different but related questions from one student:\n1. WATCO dyslexia on the encoding processes?\n2. WATCO early intervention with autism on ability to develop Theory of Mind?\n3. WATCO speech/language therapy on patients who have suffered left-lateralized strokes?\nAs you can see these students are starting to narrow a large topic into smaller areas of focus. The more specific the\nWATCO questions, the easier it'll be for them to start the next step in the process.\nFeedback\nAt this point, getting feedback can be very helpful. Seek feedback on your research question from your peers, your\nteacher, or other professors. It's likely that if they think something sounds interesting, it'll be interesting to other people\nas well. They can also give you ideas of ways you can narrow your topic or different avenues you can take.\nResearch Question & Feedback\nTry to formulate three possible research questions based on the topic you've selected. If you want to use the\nWATCO format, you can choose at least one A term and three B terms or write three separate questions.\nNarrow your terms as much as possible. Post your own research question then comment on 3 of your peers'\nquestions by clicking \"Reply.\" Here's what to comment on for each question:\n1. Rate your peer's questions on a scale of 1-10 based on how much you would want to read a paper about\nthat topic.\n2. Explain what interests you about that question.\n3. Add suggestions for improvement.\nOnce you've gotten feedback on your questions, choose the topic that resonates the best with others and that you\nbelieve will be the most fruitful and interesting to you. Now you're ready to move on to the next stage: finding and\nnarrowing sources (or in cowboy terms, getting the lay of the land).\nMore Resources\nIf you'd like more help doing background research or choosing a topic, watch Modules 1 and 2 in the iframe below (you\ncan click directly in this frame like a website). https://ysearch.lib.byu.edu/\n170 8.4 Step Three: Get the Lay of the Land (Search & Narrow)\nIn order to understand the state of your field on a topic, you need to step back and get the lay of the land. (Public\nDomain)\nWhen people started exploring the West, they started with the big questions: How big is this country? Where are the\nmountains and rivers? What's the best path to the ocean? Then as people moved into certain areas, they narrowed their\nscope as their knowledge grew: Where's the most fertile soil in this valley? Where can I build my ranch to be out of the\nwind? Where are the best trails to take my cattle?\nResearchers in every field also start big and get more narrow as they go. They begin by asking big questions, and as\npeople make discoveries throughout the years, they narrow their scope to create new knowledge.\n171 The progression of research goes from bigger questions to narrower. (Public Domain)\nSo the first researchers who discovered cancer asked the big questions like \"What is cancer?\" \"How does it affect the\nhuman body?\" But then as they began to answer those questions, they narrowed their scope to create new knowledge.\nFor example, cancer researchers branched their research into looking at\ndifferent types of cancer (e.g., What is lung cancer? What is skin cancer?)\nor different populations (e.g., How does cancer affect people with low socioeconomic status?)\nor different age groups (e.g., How does cancer affect children?).\nBy adding new factors to their research questions, they narrowed their scope and continued to create new information.\n172 Too many choices, like too big a topic, can be paralyzing. Use strategies to narrow your options. Photo by Megan\nMarkham on Unsplash\nYou'll follow a similar path when looking for sources about a topic: you'll start with a topic or research question, then as\nyou search for sources, you'll probably find that you need to narrow your scope until you find that sweet spot\u2014a\nmanageable number of sources to take a closer look at.\nHere's a real life example: my husband is a professor here at BYU in Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience. He\nstudies Traumatic Brain Injury, but if he just types \"Traumatic Brain Injury\" into the Web of Science Database, he\ngets over 38,000 results: clearly too many to handle! Then if he adds another factor to narrow the scope--say,\n\"Traumatic Brain Injury\" AND \"Rehabilitation\"--he gets 4,800, still too many, but getting better. Finally, when he adds a\nthird narrowing factor \"AND Robotics,\" he gets 32 results--the Sweet Spot! That's a manageable herd. Later you'll be\nfinding your own Sweet Spot, so stay tuned.\n173 You want to narrow until you find the Sweet Spot of Research: 30-50 sources. Image by the author.\nFinding Sources\nSo now it's your turn to get the lay of the land and start rounding up sources the way a cowboy rounds up his cattle.\nWhere do you search? If you're a college student, you're lucky! Your university library most likely gives you free online\naccess to specialized databases, subject guides, and hundreds of other resources, and it's all free of charge! If you're\nnot in college, you can still check out your local library and Google Scholar for many resources. Here's where to start:\n174 Keywords\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/3Y0dceYcRH8\nAs you saw in the video, you'll need to use keywords to search for sources that fit your topic. Don't forget to use Boolean\nOperators (AND, OR, NOT) to get the best results. I hope you noted some good keywords as you did your background\nresearch\u2014especially pay attention to the keywords listed after the Abstract of an article because these are the best\nterms for database searching. Remember that another good place to find synonyms for keywords is the field-specific\nsubject encyclopedias mentioned in the last section. Sometimes if you can't find very many sources on a particular\nsubject, it's not because no one's published on it but because you're using the wrong keywords.\nLibrary Research Assignment Part 1\nComplete the parts of this assignment to get started navigating the library website and searching databases for\nyour research topic.\n1. Write down your narrowed research question or topic (it should be related to your major or minor).\n2. List 3-5 possible keywords that will help you research your Research Question/Topic.\nLibrary Research Guides\nSpeaking of resources, I want to give extra attention to probably the best resource for preliminary research: Library\nResearch Guides. Subject Librarians are librarians who specialize in a specific field of study and have a master's degree\nor PhD in that subject area plus a master's degree or PhD in library and information science. They really know their stuff.\n175 These subject librarians usually work at university libraries and gather resources about specific majors or fields and find\nthe best databases and resources for locating sources in those specific fields. In other words, they do the heavy lifting\nfor you, so all you have to do is follow their recommendations.\nHere's how to do it: Look on your university's main Library website under \"Research Guides.\" Here's an example below\nfrom BYU that is free for anyone to use. Click on the button \"Research Guides\" and read through the different subjects\navailable. https://lib.byu.edu/\nNow find your major or your field of study and click on it (you can do this right inside the iframe above). For example, if\nyou're a Geography major, click on the Geography link, or if you're a Latin American Studies major, click on Latin\nAmerican and Iberian Studies. If your major isn't listed or if your research topic is outside of your major, then find the\nclosest subject to your topic. Once you click, you'll see tabs for finding the best types of sources like articles, books,\nstatistics, etc. in that field. The top item in a list is the best and/or most used database in your field. There's usually even\na picture and contact info for your particular Subject Librarian and a place where you can email them or set up an\nappointment in case you have further questions. They've thought of everything!\nLet's take my student Justin as an example. Justin was a Social Science Teaching major, but even though his major falls\nunder the category of Education, the topic he chose to research was the influence of China on African economies.\nTherefore, the Research Guide he clicked on was Economics. If you go to the Research Guide for Economics (see\nbelow), you'll find an amazing page written by the Subject Librarian with tabs listing resources for finding articles, books,\nstatistics, and other valuable tips\u2014resources you wouldn't have found simply typing your topic into Google or even\nGoogle Scholar.\nIf you click on the Articles tab, you'll see that in the field of Economics, there are several databases that are used the\nmost: EconLit for articles more under the general economics umbrella and Business Source Premier and ProQuest\nBusiness Collection for more business-related articles. These databases keep your search inside the relevant field and\nweed out the irrelevant junk you'd find just searching on Google or even Google Scholar. The librarians have already\ndone the hunting for you, so take advantage!\nLibrary Research Assignment Part 2\n1. Go to the BYU Library home page at lib.byu.edu and click on \u201cResearch Guides.\u201d From the \u201cSubject Guide\u201d\nlist, choose which subject fits your topic. List the subject and subject librarian (you might need to click on an\nextra tab like one that says Get Help).\n2. List the top indexes or databases for journal articles that the Subject Guide recommends you use for this\ntopic. (List 3-5)\nKey Takeaways\nYou'll learn more about finding sources if your class attends a live Library Session with a Subject Librarian, but here are\nsome of the most important takeaways:\n176 Always go through your university library website to search in databases (or even to use Google Scholar) because\nonce you're logged in, you should have automatic access to thousands of databases. If you're not logged in, you\ncould be locked out of many journals and other publications or be required to pay for them. If you ever have trouble\naccessing databases or RefWorks, contact your librarian or teacher for help.\nWhen you come across a perfect source that really fits your topic and you wish you had more like it, read the\narticle's Introduction (aka Literature Review) section and check out their References page to see which articles\nthey're citing. If they spend a lot of time talking about a certain article, you'll know it's important to their topic. You\ncan easily search for those sources on your university library page or on Google Scholar. This is a great way to\nquickly find relevant sources.\nIn a lot of databases, you can filter for \u201cmost cited articles\u201d and \u201cmost cited authors\u201d The ones that are cited the\nmost are usually the most important sources to look at because they've had the most influence. Pay the most\nattention to those.\nAlso note that if you have questions, you can click on the Get Help tab to find the subject librarian's picture and contact\ninformation so you can request extra help.\nLibrary Research Assignment Part 3\n1. Do a thorough search of the Subject Guide. Explore several of the tabs. Look for resources you can use to\nget background information, bibliographies, statistics, and other research in your field. Note the resources\nyou can use in future research projects. List three sources BESIDES indexes and databases that could\nhelp you in this project. Wise students use specialized background sources as well as articles and books\nduring the research process.\n2. What is a new resource that you learned about in this search?\nFinally, lest you think that Subject Guides are only helpful for doing research in your field, I want you to take some time\nto explore a subject totally unrelated to your major or research topic so you can see what's out there. In your personal\nlife, you'll probably need to research topics that you've don't know anything about, so take a few minutes and see how\nmuch you can learn.\nLibrary Research Assignment Part 4\nSpend a few minutes researching a subject guide in a field very different from your major. Turn up your curiosity,\nopen up tabs, and browse. List two things you learned in your browsing.\nNow you're ready to get started on your search for sources. If you're lucky, your class will be meeting with a Subject\nLibrarian. Even if not, you can try contacting a subject librarian at your library. Bring your narrowed research question,\nyour list of keywords, and the databases you plan to explore. It's helpful to try some preliminary searches with your\nkeywords before this meeting so you know generally how many sources are available on your topic and whether you\nneed to narrow your scope (which is most likely). If you still have too many sources appearing, you can narrow your\n177 search by adding more factors (AND) or by leaving out some results (NOT). If you use OR, then that will expand your\nsearch, but that can be helpful if there is more than one accepted term for one of your keywords.\nYour goal in the end will be to find that sweet spot where you have just the right-sized herd. For a literature review where\nyou'll probably need 15-20 sources in the end, I tell my students to gather about 30-50 sources to take a closer look at.\nYou'll inevitably throw some out once you read them more thoroughly, so this way you can still have enough in the end.\nFor a proposal or an infographic assignment, you might only need 5-10 sources, so gather about 20 to start with. Catch\nmy drift? Bring any questions or problems you've had in your preliminary searches to your meeting with the Subject\nLibrarian, and you should be ready to ride.\nMore Resources\nIf you still feel lost or would like more detailed guidance about finding sources or evaluating what you find, you can\nreview Modules 3 and 4 here (scroll down). https://open.byu.edu/-mia\n8.5 Step Four: Round 'Em Up (Gather & Annotate)\nNow's the time to gather your herd and decide which sources are the best. (Public Domain)\nNow that you've set your sights on the sweet spot (usually between 30-50 sources), you want to start gathering like a\ngood cowboy. Don't just randomly grab whatever you see\u2014you need to be selective, look at many, but only gather the\nbest sources. The first step is to make sure you have a good rope\u2014in other words, the right tools.\nGrab Yer Rope\n\"A Cowboy's most important tool is his rope.\" \u2014Michele Morris in The Cowboy Life (p. 71)\n178 If you don't already have a RefWorks account (or other citation software), now's the time to get one. Citation Software is\nan easy way to save articles and other sources you find in one electronic location. The beauty of doing this is that once\nyou've incorporated your sources into your paper, you can quickly create a References list from the software. Although\nyou'll still need to double-check the entries it generates (always double-check!), this will still save you a lot of time. You\ncan also use it to organize your sources and even save .pdf versions of them in your account.\nThere are many options for citation software, so if you have one you already know and use, you can stick with that.\nSome options are EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley, EasyBib, and Citation Machine. If you're a BYU student, you have free\naccess to RefWorks, and the library has made it very easy to save items straight to your RefWorks account, so I\nsuggest you start there.\nHere are instructions on how to set up your own RefWorks Account: https://open.byu.edu/-oTid\nHere are instructions for sending documents to RefWorks: https://open.byu.edu/-hyrH\nIf you'd like more instruction on how to use RefWorks. here's a nifty playlist of tutorial videos on YouTube:\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-QJM\nShould you Read It?\nNow comes the process of reading and evaluating your sources and deciding whether they fit your paper or not. You\ndon't want to waste time reading articles you obviously won't need. Here are some things to quickly consider to help you\ndecide if you should go deeper into an article. (We'll talk more about this in the next section.)\nIs it credible?\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/ioRGnTOqFMY\n179 Is it reliable and relevant?\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/4-I8vNdNlnI\n180 How to Read Online\nEven cowgirls read online. Photo by Sincerely Media on Unsplash\nReading research online is very different from reading print sources; however, more of us are reading online than ever\nbefore. Before you whip out those articles, make sure you understand how to mentally prepare yourself for the online\nreading experience. If you're reading an e-book or an academic article in PDF format, make sure to create a helpful\nreading environment for yourself by mitigating distractions, and spending a pre-determined length of time\nreading/annotating before jumping to the next task. Screens distract us, but deep reading, the kind you need to do when\nresearching, does not work when you're distracted. Turn off your phone, and concentrate.\nYou can also take advantage of software that allows you to Annotate (write notes directly on) articles and take notes as\nyou go. You can do this by hand or digitally. Hypothes.is provides pretty cool software that allows you to write notes\ndirectly on online webpages and articles and also share your annotations with peers or others.\nHow to Read a Journal Article\nFinding sources is different than understanding them\u2014especially because academic jargon can make these texts\nharder to access than than what you're used to reading. Whether you're reading an academic article or an academic\nbook, make sure you\u2019re strategic in your approach to reading. Good researchers don't read articles cover-to-cover, so\nit's important to learn how to approach a source so you don't waste precious time.\n181 Reading academic sources can be frustrating. Use smart strategies. Photo by Siora Photography on Unsplash\nFirst, as you're searching, look only at titles and abstracts to figure out which sources are the most relevant to your\ntopic. Sources don't need to address all aspects of your topic to be relevant, but they should address at least one\naspect that relates. When you find a source you want to take a closer look at, mark it by adding it to a RefWorks list or\nrecording it somehow. Then don't just read straight through each article you find\u2014that will take hours and is extremely\ninefficient. Instead, follow this advice from an expert:\nBYU Professor Dr. E. Jeffrey Hill from the School of Family Life spoke with Wes Burr (one of the most prolific authors in\nthe family studies field) about how to efficiently read journal articles. He offered the following suggestions (adapted and\nused with permission):\n1. \"First, read the title carefully. The author(s) likely spent many hours deciding on a title. Try to get the most\nunderstanding out of it that you can.\n2. Next, read the abstract. It should contain about 50% of what you need to know from the article. Have a sheet of\npaper ready and draw out all of the relationships mentioned in the abstract, so you get a conceptual idea of what is\ngoing on.\n3. Now read the first paragraph of the introduction. Much of what they couldn\u2019t fit into the abstract will be in the first\nfew paragraphs of the introduction.\n4. Next read the Conclusion/Summary. This should be the take home message of the article and will give you an idea\nof the main points.\n5. After reading the Conclusion/Summary, read each heading and first sentence of every section. You may read more\nif something seems particularly interesting. You may also look at figures and tables to see a succinct summary of\nresults.\n\u0000. Next read the entire discussion section. This is where the author tells what the important findings were and the\nmeaning of those findings.\n7. Finally, if you have any time left, read the rest of the introduction to get a better idea of the background.\n182 You almost never need to read the methods or results sections in their entirety unless you have a specific reason like if\nyou're setting up an experiment using similar methodology (though it can be helpful to briefly look over any tables or\nfigures). The idea is to be efficient and recognize which aspects of the article are relevant to your topic. Throughout the\nprocess, highlight key ideas and take notes. And always record which source a quote or idea comes from because you'll\nneed that information later.\"\nRemember that many of the conclusions any given author makes will be questioned by another source, so it\u2019s fine if you\ndon\u2019t agree with what the author says\u2014you simply need to understand the main points and how their article relates to\nyour research and the other sources you've read.\nNote-Taking\nOne of the most important aspects of cowboy/cowgirl life is keeping good records. It's crucial to know how many cows\nyou have and which ones are the best.\nQuote\n\"Record-keeping is as much a part of ranch life as roping and riding.\" \u2014Michele Morris, author of The Cowboy\nLife (1993, p. 147)\nJust like there's an art to rounding up cattle, there's an art to sorting through sources. The goal of annotating and note-\ntaking is for you to self-regulate\u2014or make sure you\u2019re understanding the piece while you\u2019re reading it\u2014but it\u2019s also to\ncreate a helpful list that you can consult later as you\u2019re writing your paper. One of the best strategies to make your life\neasier is to take notes as you go. You can take notes electronically on apps like Trello, on paper, on index cards, or\neven go old school and print out articles and highlight and write directly on them. No matter the method, you need to\nstay organized and be sure to keep track of which sources belong to which notes.\nWhile simple highlighting might be your preferred method of annotating, it doesn\u2019t tell you much about the content of\nwhat you're reading. Focus on summarizing and noting what will be helpful as you return to the article later in the writing\nprocess. For example, if you've recorded the article's major findings as you go, it'll be much easier to sort through all\nyour sources later when you're trying to find a detail you remember reading but don't remember where. Or if one\nresearcher's methods are similar to another's, make note of that so you can compare and contrast them later. If you\nknow you'll be writing a certain kind of paper like a Research Grant Proposal or a Literature Review, then keep in mind\nthe goals of that assignment as you go. (For example, see the section on note-taking in Chapter 11: How to Write a\nLiterature Review).\n183 Color-coding your notes will keep you organized and save you time later. Photo by You X Ventures on Unsplash\nOne of the best ways to stay organized (especially if you'll be writing a Literature Review on this topic in the future), is to\nuse a color-coding system where you assign one color to each source you've gathered. Then as you read that source,\nsummarize the most important points in your own words. As you write your summaries, record them individually and use\nthat source's assigned color\u2014either by writing it on a colored card/paper/post-it note, writing with different colors of ink,\nor if you're using electronic software, by tagging all your notes with the assigned color. This will also help you later as\nyou try to compare or synthesize sources. It's true that you can just copy and paste good quotes as you go, but trust me\nthat summaries will be the most valuable notes you take. Don't forget to record which page each summary/quote came\nfrom so you can easily cite it later.\nShould you accept or reject it?\nLest you think that you need to keep every source you find, watch this tutorial to see how to decide whether to accept or\nreject a source:\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-iMg\nWrite an Annotated Bibliography\nOne of the most useful forms of note-taking is writing an Annotated Bibliography. Your teacher might ask you to do this\nin preparation for writing a longer paper. Even if it's not required, an Annotated Bibliography can be an easy way to\nkeep track of the most important information from sources you find.\n184 You already know the definition of a bibliography (a list of the sources you use in a paper, also known as a References\npage). To \u201cannotate\u201d simply means to summarize, comment on, or explain more about something (especially a text). So\nan annotated bibliography is a bibliography that also includes a summary and/or evaluation of each source. The\nannotated bibliography is so helpful that it has become a legitimate genre on its own: you can find formal annotated\nbibliographies on key topics published in many academic journals.\nAn annotated bibliography may seem like busy work, but it's actually a really important part of any research writing\nprocess. If done well, it helps you to gather, cull, and organize source material, get it cited correctly, and evaluate its\nquality. It also helps you make connections between sources and practice the art of summary and synthesis. This helps\nyou begin to put all of these sources into conversation with one another before you actually start to compose.\nRecent research[1] has shown that college students have major difficulty summarizing articles and books (as opposed\nto simply paraphrasing or quoting from them). (See Chapter 9 Talking About Sources.) Summary is an important skill,\nand writing an Annotated Bibliography will give you fantastic practice summarizing sources. The beauty of this is that\nyou can also use those summaries later when you write your paper and want to refer to a source. It will also help you\nkeep track of which sources addressed which topics. In fact, if you are assigned to write a Literature Review (which you\nprobably will be in this class), you will use summary almost exclusively.\nYou might also analyze and evaluate the sources in your Annotated Bibliography. These evaluations of the strengths\nand weaknesses of a source as well as any connections you make to other sources will help you see the bigger picture\n(the lay of the land) as you write. This will also come in handy as you write your paper because you can incorporate your\nanalysis into your paper as well.\nKeep the big picture in mind as you write your annotated bibliography. Here's a good explanation of what your end goal\nis: to eventually synthesize your sources.\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/7r5bQ5ncbyQ\n185 How to Write an Annotated Bibliography\nGenerally, these are the steps for writing an Annotated Bibliography:\n1. Write the source alphabetized and in its full reference format (follow the appropriate documentation style such as\nAPA, Turabian, MLA, etc.). For more help on citation formats, see Chapter 9: Talking About Sources.\n2. Write a short paragraph (5-7 sentences)\na) summarizing the source,\nb) evaluating its strengths and weaknesses, and\nc) explaining how it's relevant to your specific topic.\nFor more specific information on how to best summarize sources, see Chapter 9: Talking About Sources\nAdditional Resources\nIf you\u2019d like more guidance on writing an annotated bibliography (including examples), see Purdue Online Writing Lab\u2019s\nGuide to Annotated Bibliographies (scroll down):\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-tBF\n[1] Several internal BYU studies as well as R.M. Howard, T. Serviss, & T. K. Rodrigue. (2010). Writing from sources,\nwriting from sentences. Writing & Pedagogy, 2.2, 177-192.\n186 8.6 Step Five: Corral 'Em (Analyze & Evaluate)\nCorralling your cattle is the last step in your research roundup. (Public Domain)\nCorralling cattle is an exhilarating practice that requires both quick thinking and strong skills on the part of the herder.\nFor a cowboy or cowgirl to do their job right, the cattle must be found, rounded up, inspected carefully, earmarked, and\nthen corralled\u2014much like your sources.\nEvaluate Sources\nWhy is this an issue?\nWhy do you even need to evaluate information? In the olden days (not that long ago, actually) there were texts that\neveryone agreed were authoritative. Maybe your parents own some old encyclopedias that they've displayed on a\nbookshelf. These were pretty much accepted as standard texts\u2014you could look at them and trust the information that\nwas printed.\n187 In the past, encyclopedias were simply accepted as good sources of information. We can't say as much for everything\npublished on the internet. Photo by James L.W on Unsplash\nThen came the internet. So much information began to be produced, it was hard to know what was credible. This has\ncreated civic debates about who believes what and what information (as people, a nation, and as communities), we\nshould or shouldn't believe. One thing that is good about the way information is produced today is that it allows for\npeople from all walks of life, and from all over the world to have a voice and to share it online. It's a way of\ndemocratizing access to, and the sharing of, information, points of view, and narratives that have been left out of\nmainstream discussions in the past.\nBut there is a downside: there are no longer gatekeepers of information\u2014the editors, librarians, and experts who would\nfact-check information before it was produced into the encyclopedias of yester-year. This means that no matter what\ninformation you are consuming, you need to become information savvy yourself, and learn good fact-checking\nbehaviors. This is especially true when engaging with information online, which we'll get to later in this section.\nHow do I evaluate scholarly material?\nScholarly material is, by its very nature, refereed before it is published. This is why academics hold it up as the \"gold\nstandard\" of academic communication, and many journals engage in what is known as the Peer Review Process. Like\nwhen you peer review in class, scholars engage in a similar practice, except for instead of having a classmate review\ntheir work, academics have their work reviewed by experts in their disciplines who recommend the work be published,\nrevised, or not published at all. This rigorous exercise is put into place to ensure strong standards in academic\ncommunication. You can find peer-reviewed journal articles through most major databases, and if you are ever\nconfused as to whether something is peer reviewed or not, make sure to look up the journal itself online, where you can\nusually tell in its description whether it is the result of peer review practices.\n188 But just because something is peer reviewed doesn't mean it's the best material for your information need. Depending\non your topic, you may need to find peer reviewed material that is published within a certain time frame. It is generally\naccepted that the more recent the publication, the better, but this really depends. The academic conversation moves\nrapidly in some fields, like technology and media, and you'll need to find information published in the last 3-5 years for it\nto feel current. Other historical topics might allow for information to be older before it becomes dated. Seminal texts\u2014or\ntexts that are really important to the field\u2014might have been published quite a while ago, but they may still be relevant to\nyour conversation and are worthwhile to consult.\nRelevance is also an important factor in determining whether scholarly information is good for your information need.\nThis requires you to have a good sense of what you are writing about and why you are writing about it\u2014so you can\ngather the best information out there. Some students fall into the \"good enough\" category where they just collect the\nfirst 20 sources that are good enough for them to sound somewhat educated on their topics. By so doing, they undercut\nthe joy of the research process which is finding the best sources for their needs. But knowing what these best sources\nare is tricky: not every source, you see, needs to address every aspect of your exact topic to be highly relevant. Realize\nthat every source might not talk about your whole topic--but they might talk about sub-issues within a wider topic or\neven related issues.\nHere is an example: say you are examining the way social media interactions affects teenage girls' behavior towards\none another in person. You may find highly relevant sources that are on parts of this issue like an article on teenage\nsocial media usage, teenage social interactions, and how social media affects the brain. You might also find a few\narticles about sub points in your paper like cognitive development for females in teenage years. As you research, it is\nbest to corral as many sources as you can at first, but as you cull the herd, be intentional about which ones you keep\nand which ones you cut loose. This will help you choose the best sources, and not just ones that are good enough.\n189 Choose the most high-quality sources (livestock) for your herd. Photo by Pixabay from Pexels\nFinally, consider other forms of scholarly communication like scholarly books. Many books published by academic\npresses (you can see what venue published the book in its first few pages) are peer reviewed and undergo a very\nrigorous editing process. To evaluate books, I'd suggest looking at who published it (a university press will carry the\nmost clout in the scholarly communication world) and who wrote it, or contributed to it. Finally, the publication date will\nmatter to those reviewing your bibliography.\nLess scholarly sources are trade journals (like Psychology Today) which are meant for practitioners in a field. Though\nthey're not peer reviewed, you may still find relevant research in these publications. Make sure to double check the\ninformation against the peer-reviewed research in your field before citing these sources, but do realize that they can\nprovide a good starting point in timely, academic conversations.\nHow do I evaluate information I find online?\nHere's where we get to the meat of it (sorry, cows!). The difficulty with information online is there is such a variety of it.\nWe find a spectrum from highly reputable sources like the research done by the Pew Research Center\u2014a non-\ngovernmental, not for profit, entity which studies issues relating to the United States\u2014to enraged rantings on blog posts\nabout the latest immigration scandal. The .org/.com tests no longer work to distinguish between \"iffy\" information types\nas just about anyone can get a .org nowadays. With opinion forums, open-access encyclopedias (read: Wikipedia) and\ncloak websites which hide behind layers of misinformation disguised as legitimate research to push political agendas,\neven the most educated of people feel wary when approaching information online. Many people would rather throw up\ntheir hands in disgust, and decide to make personal decisions about what to believe, rather than carefully learning how\nto evaluate information they find online for themselves, and become thoughtful researchers.\n190 Don't know what to believe? Hone your source evaluation behaviors. Photo by JESHOOTS.COM on Unsplash\nIn the past we've relied on acronyms (like CRAAP: Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose) to help give\nus rules of thumb about how to evaluate information; however, the information we find online often defies such\ndefinitions and quick tests of credibility. Instead, we need to learn two important lessons when interacting with\ninformation online:\n1. Define your information need. This means that you need to think very carefully about what information you are\nseeking and go to the right places to find that kind of information. If you don't fully understand what information will fill\nyour need, chances are you'll be looking willy-nilly for information and your information may end up coming from\nsketchy places. For instance, you wouldn't go to the same place to find information about a health concern you had as\nyou would to find information about a TV you were thinking of buying. The same is the case for finding information you'll\nuse in a paper. What is your paper about? Where would experts on this issue (either scholars, or others) be publishing?\nDefining your information need helps you decide where to search in the first place for good information\u2014rather than\nsorting through bad information later.\nFor example, if you are writing about the psychology of self-driving vehicles and are trying to find a book on the subject,\nbe warned: those may not have been written yet. Articles, which have a quicker publication rate, might be where to look\nfor such information.\n2. Act like a fact-checker. This means that you should read information online very differently than you do traditional\nprint material. Generally folks who read a book or a print newspaper read pretty traditionally: from top to bottom/left to\nright. When those same people approach a web page to decide if it is credible or not, they often do the same thing: read\nvertically\u2014up and down. But professional fact checkers do something very different: they read laterally. This means that\ninstead of focusing on the content of the website or publication they are verifying\u2014they focus on the verification. They\n191 open tabs, they double check claims\u2014they google the folks who are behind the information and where it came from.\nThis horizontal reading means they jump off the source to check it, rather than staying on the source and trusting what\nit's telling them.\nFact checkers also tend to look further down on Google results lists than students would\u2014they realize that the first few\nresults in a Google search can be easily manipulated, so that's why they look at results further down and look at\nmultiple source materials about a particular issue or source before believing its claims.\nFact Checking Behaviors\nFind a website or article you don't know much about on a social media feed. Practice expert fact checking\nbehaviors to decide if the information is credible or not. Record a reflection on your experience.\nMany recent studies show that students really struggle to act like fact checkers. In fact, the Stanford History Education\nGroup recently found that when students were evaluating a politically polarizing Tweet, about half of them did not click\non the link provided in the tweet to corroborate the information found therein (p. 23). This is an issue because it shows\nthat students get caught in superficial information evaluation acts: they might notice the hyperlink is there and think that\nthe fact that it is there alone gives the source credibility without actually clicking on it and checking it out.\nStanford History Education Group's suggestions for engaging with information online. Learn more at:\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-CeP\n192 Self-Evaluation: Check Yourself\nPerhaps the hardest thing we need to check is ourselves and our own biases. Confirmation bias plays into source\nevaluation behaviors for all of us. We all have confirmation bias, which means we are drawn to and tend to\nsupport/believe sources that reinforce our preexisting thoughts. Why is this an issue while evaluating information\nonline? Well, it's an issue because we may struggle to seek out and fairly consider sources who support points of view\nthat are not our own.\nOne way to deal with this is to proactively consume online material (especially news sources) that span the ideological\nspectrum. For example, check out this chart below that was created by a fact-checking organization. It shows the levels\nof bias of most news outlets today\u2014and its results might surprise you.\nLevels of bias and fact checking in news sources. (Used with permission.)\nAs you can see, many news sources lean one way or the other\u2014but a whole lot are neutral and might be considered\n\"mainstream.\" Such mainstream sources employ vigorous fact-checking and fact-based news reporting and are\ngenerally trustworthy.\nNo matter where your favorite news outlet falls on this chart, one of the best ways to avoid bias is to to double check\ninformation across several reports. When you get your information from only one source, you risk getting stuck in an\necho chamber where what you hear only amplifies what you already believed. When you read more than one source,\nyou are more likely to hear different points of view and get a more balanced view of a topic or situation. Similarly, it\nhelps to realize that genre differences (like opinion vs. news feature) could change how you interact with the information\nyou encounter. In sum, keep your fact-checking guard up when you read online\u2014as Mad-Eye Moody says, \"Constant\nvigilance, Harry!\"\n193 As Mad-Eye Moody says, you need \"Constant Vigilance\" when reading online. Photo by Artem Maltsev on Unsplash\nA second way you might deal with the issue of confirmation bias is by practicing intellectual humility. That is to say,\nbeing willing to reevaluate your beliefs, assumptions, and biases in the face of compelling, reliable, evidence. Practicing\nintellectual humility is not distrusting yourself or your gut, but instead, is realizing that you are a budding thinker and\nscholar, and you have a lot to learn. Intellectual humility is approaching research as an exercise in learning, exploring,\nand growing. It is an exercise in curiosity.\nRevisiting one major principle: How did this information come to be?\nAt this point you might be a little frustrated and be thinking, \"Well what can I trust? I guess I can't trust anything or\nanyone!\" Distrust of the media is a bit of a scary phenomenon since it seems to give license for individuals to believe\nwhatever they want rather than becoming informed on salient issues. That is why I advocate an informed approach to\ninformation consumption rather than an approach which is self-defeating. If there is one idea I want you to walk away\nfrom this section with, it is this: in order to really evaluate information, you need to figure out how that information was\ncreated; in other words, figure out how it came to be.\nSuch a question as \"How was this information created?\" hits on many points: who is behind this information? Who\nwrote it? Who published it? What kind of a publication process did it go through? Was it vetted? Was it reviewed and\nedited? By answering these questions you'll be able to construct a picture of the process this information went through\nin order to come to you. You might even be able to surmise if someone had an agenda or motivation that seemed\nhidden at first. As with everything, you'll need to make some value judgments along the way. For example, some kinds\nof information will help you establish your credibility in a paper, whereas other kinds of source material will lend humor\nor pathos to an argument. As you engage with such sources consider your audience and what kind of information they\nwould expect you to use for your writing. It all comes back to context when you make the decision to trust a source or to\nuse it purposefully in your writing.\n194 Conclusion\nNow that you've evaluated, analyzed, and started to synthesize your sources, you're ready to learn how to cite them. In\nother words, now that you've rounded up and corralled your herd, you're finally ready to incorporate those sources into\nyour writing. You're living the dream!\nThis could be you living the research dream.

Photo by PHGCOM.\nWe live in a world where we're constantly bombarded by information. We hold in our hands the ability to google any\nquestion we can think of and get thousands, if not millions, of answers. Thanks, Siri and Alexa!\nIt's become increasingly important to know not only how to sift through all the junk to get to the good answers but what\nto do with that information once you've found it. How can you share information you find in an ethical and convincing\nway? How can you make it so your writing is easy to fact-check so people will trust what you say? The answer: properly\nciting your sources. (Or in other words, telling us where you got your information.)\nBut it goes deeper than that. Before we start, we need to define some key types of source citation.\nDefinitions\nQuotation Copying the exact words of a text.\nSummary Restating the main ideas of a large or small text in your own words while significantly reducing\nthe length.\nParaphrase Rewriting a sentence or a short passage into your own words while keeping a similar length.\nPatchwriting Taking a text and changing some words or substituting synonyms or changing some grammar\nbut not changing it enough to be considered your own words.\n200 The key to properly citing sources is knowing which of these citation techniques to use (or not use) and how to do it.\nSome students think that all they need to do is slap a name and a year in parentheses after the quotes in their paper\nand then they're all good. But citing sources runs much deeper than that, and these four terms\u2014Summary, Paraphrase,\nQuotation, and Patchwriting\u2014have a lot to do with it. We'll talk more in depth about each of these techniques in the next\nsection. But first, we need to look at what's actually going on in college papers.\n9.2 How Do Students Cite Sources? Badly.\nYou might not know this, but you're probably bad at summarizing texts. How do I know? Because I'm guessing if you're\nreading this, then you're probably a college student, and college students are almost universally bad at summarizing\ntexts. How do I know that? Research.\nRebecca Moore Howard and Sandra Jamieson are fantastic researchers famous for The Citation Project\u2014a major\nstudy to find out how college students typically cite sources (2013). Howard and Jamieson looked at 174 student\nresearch papers from 16 different colleges. They tried to represent all types of schools and populations from ivy-league\nto private religious universities to public community colleges and from all areas of the country so their data could be\ngeneralized.\nHoward and Jamieson's team spent months checking every single source listed in each student's References page and\ncompared the original source to how the information was cited in the student's paper. (How would you like that job?)\nTheir findings were surprising and revealing:\nThe Results\nNow back to those key terms: Of the 1,911 citations of 930 sources they looked at, guess how many of those citations\nwere direct quotations quoted word-for-word from the source?\n46%\nHow many were paraphrases?\n32%\nAnd how many were considered patchwriting?\n16%\nNow what about summary?\nOnly 6%\nThat means that only 6% of the time did students choose to summarize their sources in their papers (p. 123). Why\nshould we care? What's so great about summaries, you ask? Hold that thought\u2014I'll tell you in the next section. For now,\njust remember that 94% of the time students chose not to do it.\nBefore we move on, there's one more surprising finding from Howard and Jamieson's study that I want to point out to\nyou. When the researchers checked the students' sources and their citations, they also looked at which part of the\nsources\u2014mostly articles and book chapters\u2014students took their citations from.\n201 Guess which page of the sources 46% of citations came from?\nPage 1\nYou're not on vacation. If you only cite from the first two pages of a source, you're probably being a lazy researcher.\nPhoto by Sincerely Media on Unsplash\nYou read that right. Almost half of all citations came from the first page of the source! If you think about it, the first page\nusually doesn't contain much more than an abstract and maybe an introductory paragraph or two. So it's not exactly the\nmost meaty part of a paper with the most felicitous quotes.\nAnd 23% more of the students' citations came from guess which page?\nPage 2\nYep. That means that about 70% of citations came from the first two pages of a source\u2014before most sources have\ngotten beyond the Introduction. Why is this significant? Because our job as writing teachers is to help you engage with\nyour sources\u2014to get to know them, to understand what their results mean, to make connections with other sources. But\nyou can't get to know your sources in just the first two pages. This suggests that students are reading superficially,\nlooking for the first decent quotes they can find, and not taking the time to understand what the paper's main points are\nor what their results mean. To be frank, this shows that students are being lazy. And this is a problem\u2014which is where\nSummary comes in. Read on to find out how Summary can save the research day.\n202 9.3 A Citation DTR: Summary, Paraphrase, Quotation, and\nPatchwriting\nSummary, I love you!\nSummary = Love! Photo by Ben White on Unsplash\nSummary is the most felicitous type of citation and the most sophisticated. The reason most students choose not to\nsummarize when citing sources is that summary has the highest degree of difficulty of all the types of source citation\u2014\nand for good reason: you have to actually understand your source in order to summarize it. You can quote anything you\nwant to without ever understanding what it means, but in a summary, you not only translate the text into your own\nwords, you also shorten its length and provide just the highlights. That means that you have to understand what the\nmost important points are. That is definitely harder than just quoting all the time, but if you add more summary to your\npapers, they will also increase in sophistication and probably in grade as well.\nBy learning how to summarize, you can show your research prowess and make better, more insightful points when you\nwrite\u2014and your readers (and teacher) will notice. If I were having a DTR (Define the Relationship talk) with Summary, I\nwould say,\nSummary, I love you!\nNot only can summary help you make better points, there is an advantage to putting things into your own words: you\ncan control the language and match your writing style. And you can also highlight the parts of the sources that are the\nmost relevant to your own paper, the parts you want your audience to notice. You can also talk about ideas and findings\nin general instead of sticking to shorter, individual points.\n203 If you like more technical terms, here's the way Howard and Jamieson defined summary in their study:\nThe author\nwrites from a paragraph or more (technically at least 3 sentences)\nrestates and condenses the text by at least 50%\nemploys \u201cfresh language,\u201d or in other words, only uses 20% or less of the language from the passage (Howard, et\nal., 2010, p. 181)\nBecause summary is so powerful, I tell students to make a goal to summarize 50-70% of the time in their papers. If\nthey're writing a Literature Review, I say to use summary almost exclusively, often summarizing more than one article in\nthe same sentence. One of the best ways to add summary to your papers is if you've already written a good Annotated\nBibliography during your source-gathering phase (see Chapter 8). In any case, my advice is to try to strengthen your\nrelationship with summary. When you summarize a shorter passage, you should cite the page number where you found\nthe information as well as the author and year, but when you talk about the ideas in a source in general, you don't need\nto list a page number\u2014just the author and year.\nParaphrase, I like you!\nParaphrase is an acceptable form of citation and has a medium degree of difficulty. It's similar to summary because\nyou're also translating information into your own words. This comes with the same advantages of being able to control\nthe language of your sentences and match your own writing style. By using your own language, you can also point out\nwhat's most relevant to your paper, so that's good. And by putting it in your own words, you prove that you at least\nunderstand what's being said by the author(s) in that particular passage. However, the problem is that when you\nparaphrase, you only work with a short passage at a time (usually only a sentence or two). I know this might sound\nalarming, but for this reason, paraphrasing can actually be dangerous.\nParaphrase = Like! (Public Domain)\nWhen you work sentence-by-sentence, you run the risk of doing what I did in my 6th grade report about Penguins. I\nopened the Encyclopedia book labeled \"P\" (yes, I was very old school) and read a sentence about penguins. Then I\nwould turn to my (really old school) computer and try to write the same sentence in my own words, but I would think to\nmyself, \"The Encyclopedia said it so well, I can't really think of a different way to say that.\"\nSo I would substitute a few synonyms for some of the words or rearrange the order of the sentence, but I kept most of\nthe Encyclopedia's wording and all of the ideas. Not cool. Technically, that's considered plagiarism\u2014taking someone\n204 else's words or ideas and calling them your own\u2014and I'm lucky I didn't get into trouble in 6th grade. But I was 11 at the\ntime, and my teacher probably recognized that I was an emerging writer still very new to writing about research. She\nknew I would eventually learn how to cite my sources.\nThe trick is that now that we're all adults, we're expected to know how to cite sources, so the stakes are much higher.\nWhen plagiarism is detected\u2014even if it was unintentional\u2014you can get into trouble, fail a paper, or even fail a class or\nlose your job. Many well-regarded people have gotten in big trouble for plagiarizing\u2014even when it was unintentional.\nThe consequences are serious, so take your citations seriously as well.\nPlagiarism is like taking the words out of someone else's mouth. Photo by Christian Gertenbach on Unsplash\nSo if you want to avoid the dangers of unintentional plagiarism, try not to work sentence-by-sentence and stick as much\nas you can to summary (oh, Summary, you're so beautiful!). But there are definitely times you'll need to paraphrase, so\nhere's Howard and Jamieson's definition of paraphrase to make things more precise:\nIn a paraphrase, the writer\ndeals with a short passage [up to a paragraph]\ndoes not condense much\nemploys \u201cfresh language,\u201d but sometimes keeps key words, (again, 20% or less) (Howard, et al., 2010, p. 181)\nI tell students to paraphrase around 20-30% of the time. When should you choose to paraphrase? When you're talking\nabout a specific idea or point that an author made that you want to refer to but that doesn't need to be quoted because\nthe wording itself isn't important. Just be sure to cite the page number(s) where you found that information as well as\n205 the author and year. I like to tell my students that if their instinct is to quote something, look at the wording and decide if\nit is really special, really unique. If the specific wording doesn't matter, try paraphrasing.\nQuotation, I just want to be friends.\nA little quotation goes a long way. Photo by Flow Graphics on Unsplash.\nLike jalape\u00f1o peppers, quotations should be used sparingly. I know, I know, you're probably thinking, \"But I thought I was\nsupposed to pepper my papers with quotes!\" You've got the wrong kind of pepper. Quotes are not the salt and pepper\nyou sprinkle all over your food\u2014instead think, jalape\u00f1o pepper. A little goes a long way.\nObviously, quotation has the lowest degree of difficulty of all the citation styles because all you have to do is take an\nauthor's words exactly. But if you just use quote after quote, it will seem like you can't speak for yourself or that you\ndon't actually understand your sources.\nSo put quotations in the Friend Zone and hang out with them only occasionally. Save your quotes for those times when\nan author says something in a unique or special way and you want to highlight their language. Or if you want to\nhighlight an expert's authority, you can include a poignant quote. Again, with quotes, you're working sentence-by-\nsentence, so in order to use them, you don't have to understand the context of a quote or how it fits into the bigger\npicture. Try to avoid Paparazzi Syndrome\u2014don't take things out of context. It can be all too tempting to find a quote that\nsupports your point without understanding the context or including all sides. Here's Howard and Jamieson's details\nabout quotation:\n206 Quotations should stay in the Friend Zone. (Public Domain)\nIn a Quotation, the writer\ncopies the wording exactly\nputs quotation marks around all copied words (please!)\nLong quotes (more than 40 words) are cited differently (indented as a block, see APA Manual)\nI tell my students to use quotation only 5-10% of the time when you're citing sources; use summary and paraphrase the\nrest of the time. Wait until you have that \"killer quote.\" If you're writing a Literature Review\u2014especially in the social\nsciences\u2014then you should almost never quote. If you do need to quote, put quotation marks around all words that\nbelong to that author and cite Author's name (use only their last name) and year. More importantly, you need to cite the\npage number each time you quote. In APA, it should look like this: (Charles, 2019, p. 345).\nI also like to challenge my students to always introduce a quote (and usually also a paraphrase) and also comment\nabout it afterward. If it's by a famous person, say so in your paper instead of just listing their name in the citation at the\nend. Comment on how the quote is relevant. We'll talk more about using evidence in your paper in Chapter 10 on\nLiterature Reviews.\nOne caveat is that if you're writing a paper that analyzes a literary text like a poem or novel (rare in the social sciences),\nyou are supposed quote often from the literary work itself as part of your analysis. But the reason you're supposed to\nquote in this case instead of paraphrase is that the wording is literary\u2014which by definition means the language is\nspecial and unique. So it still follows the rules of when to quote vs. paraphrase\u2014quote when the specific wording\nmatters. But remember that literary analyses are the only time when a lot of quoting is considered felicitous.\n207 Patchwriting, I'm getting a restraining order!\nGo away, Patchwriting! Photo by Jonathan Sharp on Unsplash\nPatchwriting is so 6th Grade. The penguin paper I described above was really an instance of patchwriting. Patchwriting\nis where a writer\u2014whether intentionally or unintentionally\u2014takes a text, changes some words or substitutes synonyms\nor changes some grammar but doesn't change it enough to be considered their own words. The degree of difficulty is\nextremely low because you don't have to understand the text well or even quote well to do it. You can be sloppy. But\nbeware: the consequences can be as dire as if you plagiarize outright.\nHoward\u2019s definition:\n\u201cCopying from a source text and then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-for-\none synonym-substitutes\u201d (Howard, 1993, p. 233)\nIn fact, most schools and institutions have a plagiarism code, and you should review yours so you understand what can\nhappen. For example, BYU's statement on Academic Honesty refers to patchwriting as \"plagiarism mosaic\" and lists\nmany of the consequences that can occur to writers if they intentionally or unintentionally plagiarize. Patchwriting and\nother types of plagiarism disrespect the research process and negate the work of others. Ethics are very important at\nuniversities and in the workplace and are one of the keys to creating new knowledge, so you should maintain high\nethical standards in your research and writing. Commit now to being precise in your use of sources and never\ndeliberately plagiarizing. Not only will this keep you out of serious trouble, it will also earn you respect now and in the\nfuture.\nIf you want to see how patchwriting and a laxity about sources\u2014even if inadvertent\u2014can get you bad attention, read this\narticle about Melania Trump's Republican National Convention speech that many people believe was patchwritten from\nMichelle Obama's previous Democratic National Convention speech. Or watch this side-by-side video and judge for\n208 yourself if you think Ms. Trump's speech was original enough or if it should be considered plagiarism/patchwriting.\nEither way, she got much more attention for the plagiarism question than she did for her message. Don't let there be a\nquestion about your citations\u2014cite responsibly, and you'll avoid problems like these.\nhttps://youtu.be/RcbiGsDMmCM\nA Word on Intentional Plagiarism\nOn a final note, it should go without saying, but just so I'm perfectly clear, it is never okay to take credit for someone\nelse's words. It doesn't matter if you've been sick and have a scary deadline or if your roommate bought a paper off the\ninternet and turned it in with no consequences or if you don't get an A in this class, you'll lose your scholarship\u2014if you\ndeliberately take credit for someone else's work, you're effectively stealing and could lose much more than your\nscholarship. Not only could you fail the assignment, fail the class, or even get kicked out of school, you will most\ndefinitely lose your dignity. (Cue Whitney Houston song \"The Greatest Love of All\" and listen for the line \"They can't take\naway my dignity!\") Don't give away your dignity!\nAnd now that there are many kinds of plagiarism-checking software readily available (like TurnItIn that's used at BYU),\nit's extremely likely that you will get caught. Resolve now to never fall into the temptation to turn in someone else's\nwork. If you get caught doing so in the workplace, you'll most likely lose your job. And you'll also lose your credibility and\nrespect. And don't forget that you could also get into trouble with the author you took from.\nHere's what famous author Nora Roberts had to say when she discovered another author had stolen some passages of\nher writing:\n\"If you plagiarize, I will come for you. If you take my work, you will pay for it and I will do my best to see\nyou don\u2019t write again.\"\nfrom Locus Magazine https://open.byu.edu/-sun\nDon't lose your integrity for a relationship with plagiarism. It will end badly. Have a DTR with your sources and decide\nthat you will love summary, like paraphrase, be friends with quotations, and run far, far away from patchwriting and\nplagiarism. If you can do this, you'll write happily ever after.\n9.4 How to Cite Sources\nNow that you've committed to citing your sources properly, let's make sure you know how to do so. Generally speaking,\nyou need to give enough publication information that the person reading your paper can easily go find your source and\nsee where your information came from. You also need to make sure it's clear which information comes from the source\nas opposed to your own ideas or words. I spent one semester working as a Documentation Editor for BYU's Honors\nProgram journal called Insight. My entire job was to go through the articles that were being published and look up every\nsingle citation, find the actual book or article, and make sure everything was cited properly. It was tedious, but it taught\nme how important good citation is.\nYou probably know that when you summarize, paraphrase, or quote from someone else, you need to include\ninformation to acknowledge the author. How do you know which information to cite? How can you tell what format you\nput this information? You need to follow a style guide. All publishers, news outlets, academic journals, universities, and\neven most companies have a style guide. They do this to make sure all their publications are consistent and clear and\nreflect the right image. Here's a link to BYU's Style Guide.\n209 To be honest, the rules of different style guides can be arbitrary\u2014is it really important if you capitalize every word in a\ntitle or only the first word? No. What's important is that you follow the rules of your style guide so your writing matches\nyour readers' expectations and so they can easily find where your sources came from. It's important to note that other\ncountries that value collectivism over individualism might have different ideas about citation and what belongs to an\nindividual or not, but in this class, you need to follow standard American rules.\nAPA Format\nThis is the recently published 7th edition of the APA Manual. Photo from Wikimedia.\nIn the social sciences, most writers follow the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 7th Edition\n(2019), often called the APA Manual for short. The 6th edition was used for nine years, but in 2019, a new 7th edition\njust came out. The manual consists of the formatting rules that a governing board has decided upon to keep their\npublications consistent. They not only list rules for citations but also for clarity, avoiding bias, and even for where to put\nthe page number on the page.\nIf you ever have a question about how to cite something, look it up in the APA Manual. There you can find in-depth\nanswers to questions of format, style, punctuation, etc. However, sometimes you just need the basics as a reference.\nHere is a link to the Purdue OWL (Online Writing Lab)'s pages on APA Formatting I suggest you bookmark these and\nrefer to them often as you write. Use these as a guide but only under that assumption that any detailed questions you\nhave should be looked up in the actual manual. Please note that when you generate a References or Bibliography page\nfrom citation software like RefWorks, you'll still need to go through and double check each source because the citation\nsoftware often puts items in the wrong places or misses details like italics or capitalization. I've found this to be\nespecially true with book chapters.\nIt's important to know the difference between in-text citations\u2014citing sources inside the sentences of your paper\u2014and\ncitations in your References list. Generally, in-text citations occur inside parentheses, include the author's name, the\npublication year, and the page number if necessary. These in-text citations are there so your readers can refer back to\n210 your References page where the full publication information should be. See the Purdue OWL APA Formatting pages\nand the APA Manual for all the information on creating References pages.\nHow to Summarize\nEven when you're summarizing an entire study that was published, you still need to cite your source. If what you're\nsummarizing can be found on a specific page of a publication, then include the page. Otherwise, follow the APA\nguidelines for in-text citations. You also need to make it clear where your writing and ideas stop and your source's start.\nIf you mention the author's name in your sentence, you don't need to repeat it in the parenthetical reference and you\nshould add the year right after their name; however, if you don't mention the author's name, everything goes at the end\nin the parenthetical reference.\nHow to Paraphrase\nLike summary, you should follow the APA guidelines for in-text citations. However, because a paraphrase comes from a\nshort passage, you need to include the page number(s) as well. If your source is a webpage, you can include paragraph\nnumbers instead.\nHow to Quote\nQuoting is much like paraphrase where you need to cite the page number with your in-text citation (or paragraph\nnumber for a webpage). Use quotation marks to make it clear which exact words come from your source versus which\nones are your own and double-check that you quoted correctly.\n9.5 Let's Practice\nNow we're going to do an activity that Howard and Jamieson reference in their article on student citation practices (add\nreference): you're going to summarize, paraphrase, and quote from Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.\n211 Now It's Your Turn\nPresident Abraham Lincoln. (Public Domain)\nFirst, read the Gettysburg Address all the way through\u2014don't worry it's short. Note the most important points and any\nparticularly poignant phrases. If you need to look up how to cite this source inside your text, go to the APA Quick-\nReference Guides or look it up in the APA Manual (2019).\nFour score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in\nLiberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\nNow we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so\ndedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a\nportion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It\nis altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\nBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate\u2014we can not consecrate\u2014we can not hallow\u2014this ground.\nThe brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to\nadd or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what\nthey did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who\nfought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task\nremaining before us\u2014that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which\nthey gave the last full measure of devotion\u2014that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have\ndied in vain\u2014that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom\u2014and that government of the\npeople, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n212 https://open.byu.edu/-ANX\nSummary\nNow you're going to practice summarizing. Often the way you summarize will depend upon your audience. If you're\nexplaining something to your 5-year-old cousin, you'll use different language than if you're summarizing the address for\nan academic paper. Choose a specific audience and/or context for your summary before you begin.\nTry Summary\nYour turn. Please summarize the Gettysburg Address in 2 sentences. You may choose a specific\naudience/context for your summary. Include proper in-text citation.\nDo you see how in a summary you must distill the most important ideas into a much shorter length? This is hard\nbecause you need to understand what the most important ideas are, but it also allows you to explain things in your own\nwords and adjust to your audience.\nParaphrase\nThis time you're going to practice paraphrasing. To get practice adjusting your wording to a different situation, choose a\nnew audience and/or context for your paraphrase. Remember that you should choose only a short passage to\nparaphrase, and your text should be about the same length as the original just in your own words. Because a\nparaphrase should come from a short passage, any in-text citations should include the page number(s). Since the\nGettysburg Address is so short, use the paragraph number like this: (para. 2).\nTry Paraphrase\nNow paraphrase 1-3 sentences from the Gettysburg Address. Choose a new audience/context for this\nparaphrase. Include proper in-text citation.\nDo you see how summary and paraphrase allow you to change your wording and approach based on your audience?\nFor example, if you were simply quoting, it would be much harder to explain something to a 5-year-old.\nQuotation\nNow I want you to choose a quote from the Gettysburg Address where the wording really sticks out as beautiful or\npoignant or illustrates a point well. This is the trick with quoting\u2014you don't want to just quote large chunks. You need to\nbe selective. In fact, if you'd like, you can write a sentence that is mostly in your words but adds short quotations inside\nyour sentence. Quotes work best if you introduce them in your own words and/or give commentary about them after. In-\n213 text citations are the same as with paraphrases. Include the page number(s), or in the case of the Gettysburg Address,\nuse the paragraph number.\nTry Quotation\nChoose a particularly meaningful or beautiful part of the Gettysburg Address to quote. Don't forget to introduce\nthe quote and/or comment on it afterward. Choose a new audience/context again. Include proper in-text\ncitations.\nConclusion: Choose Your Own Adventure\nNow that you know how to cite sources, you're ready to start focusing on writing your paper. Your teacher has probably\neither assigned you to write a Literature Review or a Proposal next. So choose the corresponding chapter (Chapter 10\nfor Literature Reviews or Chapter 13 for Proposals), and you can continue your research journey.\nReferences\nHoward, R.

Photo by Frank Schwichtenberg\nThe straightforward answer is that a literature review is a review or synthesis of all the research published on a certain\ntopic. But I'd rather explain it from a skateboarder's perspective:\nOne of my favorite movie series is the 1980s classic Back to the Future trilogy where the bodacious skater Marty McFly\ntime-travels to the future and sees the coolest thing I could imagine: a hoverboard. As a kid, I was a dabbling\nskateboarder at the time I saw this movie and thought if I could just have one of those rad, flying hoverboards, all my\ntroubles would disappear. It was an optimistic time.\nTrouble is, hoverboards are really hard to make. We've already passed the year 2015 when the \"Future\" of Back to the\nFuture Part 2 takes place, and guess what? No hoverboards. I know what you're thinking: you've seen a skateboard-\nlike, two-wheeled device marketed with the name \"Hoverboard\" that teenagers ride around parks, sidewalks, and their\nparents' basements. But you're wrong: that's just an electric, no-handled scooter that occasionally catches on fire and\nburns people's houses down. I'm not satisfied.\n218 Is this a real hoverboard? I think not. Photo by Soar Boards\nI want a real hoverboard. That you ride in the air. So how can we know when real hoverboards will be available? How\ncan we know where the technology is now? Will we know a real hoverboard when we see one? Tony Hawk, the best\nskateboarder of all time (whose face was incidentally taped to my wall in the '80s) recently filmed a 2-minute video of\nhow far real hoverboard technology has come\u2014filmed on the very day Marty McFly supposedly went to the future:\nOctober 21, 2015:\n219 Tony Hawk and the cutting edge of hoverboard research\nWatch on YouTube\nTony Hawk and the cutting edge of hoverboard research. https://youtu.be/wCZiEtduSQg\nAlthough this \"hoverboard\" was really a huge black rectangle the size of Delaware floating only an inch off the ground,\nand although Tony Hawk fell off a lot, he was technically in the air, so I'm taking that as a good sign. Then recently, a\nprofessional jet ski rider broke the world record for longest time \"hovering\" in the air with a highly dangerous jet-engine-\npropelled contraption called Flyboard Air. It's also definitely a step in the right direction, but there's a big problem\n(beside extreme danger): it's projected to cost around $250,000. Sadly, not in my price range.\nThe good news is, now we've found the point where hoverboard research actually is. The bad news: we have to face\nthe sad truth that it might still be a while before we get real Marty-McFly-approved flying hoverboards that non-\nbillionaires can ride. But at least now we know. Because knowing is half the battle.\nThe State of a Field on a Topic\nThat leads me to literature reviews. Whenever you want to know the state of a field of research like how far hoverboard\ntechnology has come, the best way to find out is probably not YouTube videos. It turns out you can do something much\nmore reliable: conduct a literature review. In this case, \"literature\" doesn't mean the Victorian novels you read in English\nclass, it means all the research published on a certain topic. So a literature review is simply a review or a synthesis of\nthe research published on a topic.\n220 Standing on the Shoulders of Giants (Public Domain)\nResearchers and companies today don't just start projects out of the blue\u2014they do their homework first by finding out\nwhat others have already done. So if you want to make a hoverboard, you don't just go to Home Depot and buy random\nparts\u2014you research what already exists and talk to the experts so you don't have to reinvent the wheel (get it?).\n\"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" \u2014Sir Isaac Newton (and the motto of\nGoogle Scholar)\n221 Find the gaps in research. Photo by Jeremy Bishop on Unsplash.\nBefore good researchers set up any surveys or experiments, or even write a proposal for funding, they figure out\nexactly which research questions have already been asked and answered. Same goes for anyone wanting to make a\nproduct that will sell. But more importantly, they look for the gaps in the research or marketplace where answers have\nyet to be found. And then they focus their own work on filling in some of those gaps. That'll be your job, too.\nIn other words, the goal of a literature review is to find the sweet spot where the most promising research is happening\nnow\u2014we call that the cutting edge. (The Cutting Edge is also a cheesy '90s movie about ice skating, so be sure not to\nget them confused.) As Marty McFly would say, finding the cutting edge is pretty gnarly because that's where the\nadventure begins. So grab the closest thing you have to a hoverboard, and let's go.\n10.2 How is a Literature Review different from a typical\nResearch Paper?\n*Suggestion: Just for fun, as you read this next section, set the mood by playing one of these songs called \"Old\nFriends.\" You'll see how it's relevant in a minute.\n222 1. Simon & Garfunkel \"Old Friends\"\u2014old-school classic\n2. Ben Rector \"Old Friends\"\u2014w/ high school band Euromart, in the garage of the house he grew up in\n3. Willie Nelson, Roger Miller, Ray Price \u201cOld Friends\u201d \u2014country Western style\nYou've probably been writing research papers most of your life\u2014you know, starting from the five-paragraph essay you\nlearned in high school to the term paper you wrote last semester that had a thesis statement and lots of quotes. So it\ncan seem daunting to switch gears to writing a literature review, but there are some distinct advantages to making the\nswitch (that I'll get to later). The trick is first understanding the difference between the two.\nResearch Papers are Thesis Driven\nThe difference between a typical research paper and a literature review is your purpose and strategy. Tell me if this\nsounds familiar: when you're assigned to write a research paper, you start with a thesis or argument that you'd like to\nmake. Your thesis has to do with a new way to look at something or a change you'd like to see in the future. Then you\nsearch for sources that support your point. You might adjust your thesis if you come across sources that challenge your\nclaim, but generally, the sources you've gathered become evidence for your thesis and you use them to support your\npoint. In other words, your argumentative research paper is driven by your thesis.\nLiterature Reviews are Source Driven\nIn contrast, when you write a Literature Review, the sources themselves dictate what you'll say in your paper.\nRemember, your goal is to tell your audience the state of the field on a topic\u2014what's been happening in the published\nresearch\u2014so you can find the cutting edge and where the research gaps are. Therefore, you need to find and evaluate\nthe most relevant sources surrounding a topic and then write a review based on what you find. You can't decide on a\nthesis statement or know what points you'll make before you start because you have to find out what researchers are\ndoing before you can report on that. Simply put, your literature review is driven by your sources.\nYou'll still have an overarching point/thesis that controls your literature review paper structure, but it will be a claim\nabout what patterns you found in the research\u2014not an argument about a change you want to see in the future or a new\nway to look at something. And you'll decide on your thesis much later in the writing process. Here's a table that\ncompares the writing process of a traditional research paper with that of a literature review:\nTraditional Research Paper Literature Review\nThesis-driven Source-driven\nStep Conduct background research on a Research Conduct background research on a Research Question\n1 Question\nStep Choose an argument/thesis Find, evaluate, & annotate sources\n2\nStep Find sources for evidence to match your Look for patterns in the sources, find gaps\n3 argument\n223 Step Look for counterarguments and evidence to refute Develop a thesis based on where researchers agree &\n4 them disagree in the field\nStep Outline the points of your argument Write an outline based on the patterns and gaps you\n5 found\nStep Write paragraphs that support your thesis with Write paragraphs that support your thesis by\n6 evidence/quotes synthesizing sources\nStep Revise Revise\n7\nLiterature Reviews: Catching up with Old Friends\nHere's where the song comes in\u2014another way to think about the difference between literature reviews and the\ntraditional research papers you're used to writing (with props to Professor David Taylor from the University of Maryland).\nWhat do you do when you meet an old friend? You ask,\nLiterature reviews are like getting filled in by an old friend. (Public Domain)\n\"How are you?\n224 What have you been up to?\nFill me in!\"\nLiterature Reviews are like getting filled in by an old friend. Only this time, you're explaining how a field of research has\ngotten to the present (like how far hoverboard technology has come). But like a conversation with an old friend, you\nwant to review only the details most relevant to the situation. You don't usually give a moment-by-moment chronology of\nwhat you've done in your life (no one has time for that); rather, you talk in terms of categories\u2014work, family, travel, etc.\nThis is like the synthesis that happens in a Literature Review. As you read sources about a specific topic, you'll look for\nthemes, for similarities and differences, for points of agreement and disagreement, for gaps in the research that haven't\nbeen filled in yet. Those themes become the categories you'll talk about in your literature review so your audience will\nunderstand the big picture about your topic.\nIn contrast, a traditional research paper is like what happens after you've reviewed the past with your friend\u2014only then\ndo you talk about the future. What are your old friend's future plans? Do they have a big trip in the works or a change in\ncareer? Are there goals in their life plans they still want to accomplish? Do you agree or disagree with them? This is like\nthe argumentative thesis statement in a research paper about what changes you think should happen in the future or a\nnew way to look at something. A typical research paper talks about how we should look at a problem differently or how\nwe should fill in the gaps in research. It's forward thinking rather than talking about what's happened up until now.\nAnd as you might have realized by now, you could even call the introduction section of a traditional research paper a\n\"mini literature review\" because in it you explain the background behind your topic before you make your argument\nabout the future. So it's safe to say that in order to get to the future (research or change), we usually first have to go\nback in time (see what's come before). Marty McFly would approve.\nWhy Literature Reviews?\nThere are some huge advantages to trying out this new genre of a literature review as opposed to a traditional research\npaper. We learned in Chapter 9 Talking About Sources that most college students do not engage with their sources\u2014\nmost students merely find quotes to fit their argument and plug them into their papers without actually understanding\u2014\nor perhaps even reading\u2014their sources. Many even quote directly from the abstract, not even bothering to read past\nthere. Even more telling is that in the Howard and Jamieson study mentioned in Chapter 9, the number of students who\nsummarized their sources in their papers was only 6%. That's probably because summary is a higher-level task that\nrequires actually understanding the sources instead of merely extracting one quote at a time. And without summary, you\ncan't have synthesis\u2014the cornerstone of a good literature review. It's as if students are spending a lot of time exercising\ntheir research muscles, but have completely missed their most essential summary and synthesis muscles\u2014their core, if\nyou will.\n225 Summary and synthesis are like your core muscle exercises\u2014essential skills that will make all writing and headstands\neasier. (Wikimedia Commons)\nBecause of findings like this, many instructors are now assigning literature review papers rather than traditional\nresearch papers in order to isolate those core muscles that need exercise the most\u2014the summarizing and synthesizing\nmuscles. Because Literature Reviews are source-driven and require understanding and summarizing many sources,\nthey are the perfect assignment for strengthening the missing skills in your writing repertoire. We've found that when our\nstudents write literature reviews, they learn (sometimes for the first time) the true steps of the research process; how to\nread, understand, and summarize sources; and even more importantly, they can finally see the big picture and\nsynthesize those sources to understand the state of a field.\nAnd by strengthening your ability to evaluate and synthesize sources, you'll actually strengthen your other writing skills\nas well, including your traditional research paper writing skills. You'll find after you focus on the literature review that\nfinding and evaluating any type of source will be much easier\u2014just like strengthening your core muscles will help you\nwith all types of exercise.\n226 Literature Reviews can help you develop rock hard research abs. Image by FelixMittermeier on Pixabay\nThis might sound crazy, but I actually get emails every semester from former students thanking me for assigning them a\nliterature review because it's helped them with research projects in their next classes or jobs. You, too, can get rock\nhard research abs by learning how to write a literature review!\n10.3 Literature Reviews in the Social Sciences\nIn case you're not convinced enough to take on the task of writing a literature review, I thought I'd mention that literature\nreviews come up in the social sciences in many different venues that you'll encounter in your schooling and career.\nYou'll see that they often follow similar patterns and purposes:\nGrant Proposals\nAny grant proposal submitted to request research funding begins with an extensive literature review to justify the need\nfor the research funds. If you can prove there's a gap in knowledge, it makes it that much easier to convince your\naudience to give you funding to fill that gap. More on that in Chapter 12: Proposals.\n227 IMRAD Articles\nThe Introduction of an IMRAD article includes a literature review. Photo by Tom Toyosaki on Wikimedia Commons\nIMRAD (pronounced \"im-rad\") stands for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion and is the most common\ngenre published in the social sciences and sciences. Most of the sources you gather will likely be IMRAD-format\npapers. The \"I\" in IMRAD stands for Introduction and usually consists of a review of the literature on the authors'\nresearch topic. The author(s) usually use the Introduction section to report on the published literature about their\nresearch topic and reveal the trends and gaps in current research. An added benefit to beginning an article this way is\nthat by showing the gaps in the research, the author(s) can justify their own research and explain the significance of the\ntopic they chose to examine. Clever!\n228 Research saves the day! Photo by Yogi Purnama from Pexels\nIt's kind of like a superhero moment when someone publishes that they have a problem (e.g., turns on the Bat Signal or\nyells \"Help!\"), and Batman or Superman or Wonder Woman swoops in and saves the day. The authors lay bare a\nproblem or gap in current research, and then they reveal the research they did to solve that problem, fill that gap. Ta da!\nResearch saves the day.\nAs you might guess, the sections following the Introduction (Methods, Results, Discussion) describe the primary\nresearch the author(s) conducted to answer their research question. First they report on their quantitative and/or\nqualitative Methods (M in IMRAD) including statistical analyses. Then they publish their Results (R in IMRAD). Finally,\nthe author(s) embark on a Discussion (D in IMRAD) of their results in the context of the greater field of research and\nmake suggestions for future research. This starts the research cycle over again as someone else reads their article as\npart of their own review of the literature and discovers a gap in the research that can be filled by new primary research.\nPublished Literature Reviews\nIn the world of science and social science, literature reviews can also be published on their own. For example, if\nsomeone does an extensive investigation into an important topic, the publishers of academic journals will often publish\nthat literature review on its own to help other researchers understand that topic better.\nMarket Analyses\nIn the business sector, when someone wants to sell a product or service, they usually conduct a market analysis first to\nfigure out how their product/service could fill a niche in the market. Entrepreneurs know that it's worth spending time\nresearching existing products as well as potential competitors to find potential gaps in the market. They know that in\norder to convince people to buy their product/service, they have fill a customer's need. Conducting a market \"literature\nreview\" helps them pinpoint those gaps in the current market so their product will have the biggest impact and their\nbusiness will succeed.\n229 Popular Literature Reviews\nImage by Wikimedia Commons\nLest you think nerdy academics and business gurus are the only ones who rely on literature reviews, recall the last time\nyou went on Wikipedia. If you think about it, Wikipedia is really just a giant literature review on millions of topics.\nAlthough the information on Wikipedia is not formally peer-reviewed like the reviews published in academic journals,\nthey do cite all their sources and frequently revise to keep the information current. Clearly there's a market for relevant\ninformation. If you really want your mind to explode Inception-style, look up \"Wikipedia\" on Wikipedia and you'll find a\nliterature review about a literature review. Crazy.\nAll this is a long way of saying that literature reviews are a part of life. They're a huge part of any field\u2014especially the\nsocial sciences\u2014any successful business, and even our basic human desire for knowledge. So if you're ready to learn\nhow to tackle your own literature review, let's talk about the first steps in Chapter 11 How to Plan a Literature Review.\n230 Cristie Cowles Charles\nBrigham Young University\nCristie Cowles Charles teaches writing and literature courses at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.

Photo by Elijah Hail on Unsplash\nRemember back in Chapter 3: Writing Processes where we introduced you to the steps of the writing process? And do\nyou remember that the first step is to Plan? I hope so. Because for a big paper like a Literature Review, the more you\nprepare and plan, the better your paper will turn out. Trust me; you don't want to jump into this one the night before it's\ndue. Or even the week before it's due. The key to a good Literature Review is finding the patterns and connections\nbetween sources and synthesizing those sources rather than just talking about them individually. Therefore, before you\nbegin writing or even planning what to write, you need be sure you've done your homework and have good notes to\nwork with. For the purposes of this section, I'm going to assume that you've already done the steps in Chapter 8:\nFinding and Evaluating Sources: you've created a research question, gathered many relevant and reliable sources,\nannotated your sources, taken good notes, and hopefully even written an Annotated Bibliography.\nRecall from Chapter 1 that any publication is written as part of an ongoing conversation. So it helps to view all the\nsources you've found as contributions to the larger conversation in your field. Your job is to figure out the most important\nthreads of that conversation. For this reason, a good Literature Reviewer synthesizes the sources\u2014compares them and\nshows them in a larger context\u2014rather than just talking about them individually. Like Marty McFly, your readers need\nthe big picture.\n\u201cA literature review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it usually has an organizational\npattern and combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of\nthe source, but a synthesis is a re-organization, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new\ninterpretation of old material or combine new with old interpretations. Or it might trace the intellectual\n234 progression of the field, including major debates. And depending on the situation, the literature review may\nevaluate the sources and advise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant.\u201d\n\u2014The Writing Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nI know in Chapter 10 we talked mostly about looking at what's been done before. But the truth is, even though the past\nis your focus in a literature review, like in the movie Back to the Future, you'll also want to keep in mind the present and\nfuture.\nMap out the past, present, and future of research. Feel free to use a time-traveling Delorean. Photo by Jason Leung on\nUnsplash\nImagine you're getting into your time-traveling Delorean so you can figure out\nthe past\u2014how far research has come\nthe present\u2014where researchers are currently focusing their research, and\nthe future\u2014where gaps in knowledge appear that can be filled by tomorrow's researchers.\nWhat is Synthesis?\nThroughout the rest of this section you'll be going through a tutorial created by superstar research librarian Emily\nSwensen Darowski and illustrious associate professors Nikole D. Patson and Elizabeth Helder Babcock to take you\nthrough the process of synthesizing sources. Have your notes from your sources ready and follow the instructions after\neach video.\n235 Watch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D. Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock.

If you've already color-coded your summaries from your sources, then\nyou're one step ahead. If not, don't worry. Just watch this video and follow the steps. Remember, you can use paper\ncards or electronic note-taking software like Trello.\nWatch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D. Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock. (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://youtu.be/Zcp0bov2svo\n237 Step 2: Look for Patterns\nCan you see patterns? Photo by James McDonald on Unsplash\nNow you're going to take your note-taking to the next level as opposed to just writing general summaries like you did for\nan Annotated Bibliography. This time as you read through your notes and sources, you'll be looking for patterns and\nthemes that emerge.\nIf you're writing a stand-alone literature review, then you don't need to look for all the items listed in the video. (A stand-\nalone literature review means the kind that's published on its own and is not the introduction to a bigger empirical\nresearch project report or IMRAD format paper. Most students will be writing a stand-alone literature review). In that\ncase, you just need to look for things that help you see what's happening in the field, what researchers are doing. So\nyou can ignore the items in the video such as \"Methodology that you might 'borrow' for your proposed materials or\nprocedures\" because you won't be conducting any experiments or primary research in this class. Your teacher might\neventually ask you to propose research in a grant proposal, but that's the most you'll have time for. So for now, just\nfocus on the items relevant to a literature review as you organize your notes.\n238 Watch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D. Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock. (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://youtu.be/7bDVx3iicbE\nI tell my students to ask four questions as they look through their sources and notes:\n1. What do researchers agree and disagree about?\n2. How are researchers narrowing or changing their focus to create new information?\n3. What are each study\u2019s limitations and strengths?\n4. What\u2019s the next step in research\u2014what should be studied in the future? (The research gap)\nRevisit your sources from your Annotated Bibliography. Look through them again looking for these patterns:\nSimilarities/Differences\nRelationships\nAreas of inquiry\nAreas of controversy\nGaps\nAnother way to think of these groups is to think heat: Where are the hottest areas of research? What are the most\nheated debates? Which studies are the hottest\u2014most cited? Which are only lukewarm because they have major\nlimitations/weaknesses? Where does the research go cold (where are there gaps that need to be filled)?\n239 Step 3: Organize and Group\nGroup your notes into themes or umbrellas. Photo by Alex Blajan on Unsplash\nNow you can group your notes into themes or umbrellas based on the four questions you've been asking yourself. Or if\nyou notice similarities or connections between sources, feel free to make an umbrella based on that. This process\ndoesn't have to be perfect, so don't get caught up in making things match perfectly. The point is that you're starting to\norganize your notes based on your own agenda.\n240 Watch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D. Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock. (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://youtu.be/TJNoymVkqlI\nHere's what you can consider about each of the four questions from above:\n1. What do researchers agree and disagree about?\nMany students are tempted to simply report on what's been established and agreed upon in their field, but the problem\nwith this is that if everyone in your field agrees about something, then it becomes common knowledge and no longer\ncounts as a gap in knowledge. So if you only report on what is commonly agreed upon, you're actually writing a\ndescriptive report rather than a synthesized literature review. Students in fields like Public Health where reports are\ncommon need to pay extra attention to avoiding this tendency. Reports are great when explaining something like the\ndifference between symptoms of the common cold versus the coronavirus\u2014you want to focus on the most agreed-upon\ninformation in that case. But a literature review has a different purpose: to unearth the gaps and disagreements where\nthe most fruitful areas for future research are.\nIf most researchers seem to agree, all is not lost; that information can become background information for your\nliterature review. So take note of common knowledge in your field, but focus your search on areas of disagreement.\n2. How are researchers narrowing or changing their focus to create new\ninformation?\nRemember as well that researchers are constantly trying to create new information. They do this in two ways:\n1. by narrowing or shifting their focus or\n2. by taking something that's been done before and doing it in a new way as a type of re-vision.\nIt's your job to point out how researchers in the field are currently creating new information and where you think the field\nis going next (aka the gaps in research). If you notice, for instance, that researchers have started to look at specific\n241 geographic areas but they haven't yet looked at different age groups, then this could be an area for further research. It's\nvaluable to show a trajectory of how variables are being narrowed because that helps us know where things are bound\nto go in the future as well.\n3. What are each study's limitations and strengths?\nWhen I have a student who's struggling with synthesis, I often tell them to go through each source and simply write out\nthe strengths and weaknesses. It's a great way to start because it gets their analysis juices flowing. Perhaps a limitation\nis in methodology\u2014is the study reporting on a small number of participants? That usually allows for richer data (a\nstrength) but at the cost of being able to generalize to a bigger population (a weakness). Is the study only quantitative in\nnature? That allows for easily measurable results about larger populations (a strength), but perhaps they are missing\nthe richer data interviews or qualitative surveys could produce (a weakness). Does someone's interpretation of results\nseem to miss what another research group published? Ta da! You've found a gap that can be filled with future research.\nOne more way to take note of limitations and strengths is to pay attention to which sources are cited the most and have\nhad the most influence in your field. You can generally assume that the more a source is cited, the \"stronger\" the\nresearch.\n4. What\u2019s the next step\u2014what should be studied in the future? (The research gap)\nAll of this is leading to the ultimate goal of a literature review, which is to show where researchers should go next. As\nyou analyze your sources and find places where further research would add knowledge to your field, take note. You can\norganize these \"gaps\" into themes or umbrellas as well and include them in your literature review. In terms of\nhoverboards, the point of a literature review is to figure out what's been done\u2014and more importantly, what hasn't\u2014so\nyou can pinpoint where the best place is to take the next step and remain on that cutting edge.\n242 Make a Map\nMake a map of your sources. Photo by oxana v on Unsplash\nAs you compare sources and group your notes, you'll be able to figure out the main paths that the conversation is\ntaking. This is why Literature Reviews are generally organized around themes rather than simply a list of information\nabout each source separately. In fact, most Literature Reviews are organized in one of these four structures:\n1. Similar concepts or themes\n2. Similar methods\n3. Chronological development\n4. Controversies\nMy students often find it helpful to literally make a map of their sources to show where themes are emerging. This is\nsimilar to the creative mindmapping we talked about in the brainstorming section earlier. As with brainstorming, it often\nhelps to physically draw the connections because it encourages your creativity and your ability to see relationships.\nHere's an example of my awesome geography student Carly's paper on the uses of Social Media during Crises and\nDisasters. Making a map of her topic and what she found in her sources allowed her to visually see where the areas of\ninquiry are in her field. This map could easily be used to create themes for her notes or even to structure her outline for\nher literature review.\n243 A student's mindmap for her paper showing areas of inquiry around the topic of social media use during disasters.\n(Used with permission)\nStep 4: Assess Groupings\nIt's time to look through the way you've grouped your notes and see where your sources are landing. Make sure you\nhave multiple sources under each theme/umbrella so you'll be able to synthesize once you get to the drafting stage. If\nyou don't have enough sources under a theme/umbrella, this is a good time to either look for more sources or decide\nthat this particular theme is not important enough to include. Once you feel like you have enough sources under each\ngroup, you can probably see how your paper's outline will emerge from this organization. (We'll talk all about outlines in\nthe next section.)\n244 Watch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D. Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock. (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://youtu.be/E0AsfD4ih2I\nStep 5: Write a Paragraph\nNow you can try writing a paragraph that synthesizes the sources under one of your groups of notes. If you can include\nsynthesized paragraphs like this throughout your paper, your literature review will be much more sophisticated than a\nsimple annotated bibliography or descriptive report\u2014you will show that you understand the areas of inquiry in your field\nand how researchers are approaching your topic.\n245 Watch on YouTube\nBy Emily Swensen Darowski, Nikole D.

Patson, and Elizabeth Helder Babcock. (CC-BY-NC-SA)\nhttps://youtu.be/zjzm99oNf5E\nNow that you've started organizing your notes into themes, patterns, and idea umbrellas, you're ready to start thinking\nabout the structure of your paper. So we'll take a break from working with notes and think through the structure of a\nliterature review.\n11.2 Structure Your Paper\nA Literature Review follows a general structure. As you start organizing your ideas and formulating what you want to\nsay, think about how and where your ideas will fall into this basic structure:\nTitle Page\nAbstract\nIntroduction (with Thesis Statement)\nBody Paragraphs (with Headings)\nDiscussion/Conclusion\nReferences\nIn addition, your teacher might ask you to include other elements like a Table of Contents, List of Tables and Figures, or\nan Appendix.\nI'm going to cover each of the main elements of Literature Review structure, but instead of talking about them in the\norder they go in your paper, I'm going to talk about them in the order you should tackle them. Trust me, it'll make your\nlife easier.\n247 Thesis Statement\nNow that you've grouped your notes and seen patterns emerge, you're ready to create the crux of your literature review:\nthe thesis statement. But don't be fooled into thinking that you're writing a typical research paper with an argumentative\nthesis statement where you take a position on an issue. In contrast, your position in a literature review is simply what\nyou believe to be the state of the field on an issue. Some people call it an expository thesis statement because it\nexposes or announces your topic rather than taking a position or arguing your opinion. So any claim you make will be\ndetermined by the sources that you've been organizing and grouping and the trends or patterns you found. One way to\nthink of a literature review thesis statement is in two parts:\nThesis = Main Areas of Inquiry + Future Research Directions\nAreas of Inquiry\nIn other words, you will describe what you think the main areas of inquiry are concerning your topic. This is the new\nknowledge you're personally bringing to the table and that justifies writing a literature review\u2014now that you've read and\nanalyzed your sources, you can tell us your findings. And your findings consist of the fact that researchers in your field\nare congregating in certain arenas\u2014also known as areas of inquiry. Your job is to point out where those areas are.\nGo back to your notes from the Synthesis activities in the last section and also do some mind mapping until you have\ndecided on 3-5 main areas of inquiry you want to talk about in your paper. If you're organizing your Literature Review\nchronologically or by methodology instead of by theme/area of inquiry, then you can divide your ideas in to 3-5 sections\nbased on those perspectives. Either way, you can even write out the headings you would use for each section.\nFuture Research Directions\nAnd because there are still limitations or gaps in knowledge, you're also in a position to explain where you think future\nresearch should go. These are your main findings or \"results\" in a Literature Review. So your thesis statement\u2014or main\npoint\u2014is a combination of your main sections and your findings. You'll eventually put this statement at the end of your\nIntroduction.\nLength\nAnother difference between a typical research paper and a literature review is that in the former, a thesis statement is\nshort\u2014one or two sentences\u2014and makes a claim; in contrast, a literature review thesis statement can be as long as a\nparagraph. In fact, the thesis statement can serve two purposes: it can explain your main point and it can indicate the\norganization of your paper. (Be sure to list everything in the same order you'll talk about them in your paper.)\nFor example, my student Justin's thesis statement is actually a paragraph long and sets up the organization of his\npaper. (This came at the end of his Introduction.)\nIn this paper, I will give an overview regarding the history of Africa\u2019s relationships with their traditional\ninvestors and then compare that to China\u2019s relationship with Africa now. I will then cover the three main\nways that China is involved with Africa which are FDI, trade, and aid and discuss what researchers have\nfound both China and Africa have to offer in all of these interactions. Then I will synthesize how current\nresearchers agree and disagree regarding both the positive and negative effects of China\u2019s interaction on\nAfrica from a macroeconomic and microeconomic level. I will then end this review by offering what\nresearchers say is the future of Africa based on their relationship with China.\n248 As you can see, this is very different than a typical thesis statement. It's long and doesn't take a stand on an issue. But\nit still serves the purpose of delineating the main points of his paper\u2014areas of inquiry and research gaps\u2014and setting a\ndirection for where he'll go.\nWrite a Thesis Statement\nNow it's your turn to try creating a preliminary thesis statement to go at the end of your Introduction. List the 3-5\nmain Areas of Inquiry that you've found based on your topic. Then list the main gaps you've found in the\nresearch and where you think further research should go. Now write these things out into a few sentences that\ncould go at the end of your Introduction. You might have to revise this later, but it will be a good start.\nOutlining\nOutlines are like topiaries. Photo by Dean Moriarty from Pixabay.\nOnce you have a basic thesis statement\u2014or even as you're trying to create one\u2014you can start organizing your ideas\ninto an outline. Your notes should already be grouped under umbrellas, so it shouldn't be too hard now to make a\ngeneral outline of the rest of your paper. There are two types of outlining you can choose for setting up your paper: the\nformal outline (aka the structured outline) or the organic outline (aka the unstructured outline). Dr. Matt Baker (2019), a\nBYU Linguistics professor, has studied the way students create outlines and likes to compare the two types of outlining\nto making a topiary\u2014you know, those shaped trees or bushes that often look like animals (they're especially prevalent\nat Disney resorts).\n249 Organization-Only Outlines are like the topiary wire frames that a bush will grow into. Photo by Mike Atkinson on Flickr.\nBaker calls the formal/structured type of outline an Organization-Only Outline and says this is similar to the formal way\ngardeners create topiary bushes. The formal way is to create a metal wire frame first and then grow the bush into the\nframe until it's shaped beautifully. This is like the types of formal outlines you're probably most familiar with that use\nRoman numerals:\nI. Introduction\nII. Main Point #1\nI. Sub-topic A\nI. Sub-sub-topic i\nII. Sub-sub-topic ii\nII. Sub-topic B\nIII. Main Point #2\nI. Sub-topic A\nII. Sub-topic B, etc.\nIf you already have a good sense of where you're going with your literature review, then this can be a great way to start\nfilling in the details. You can make your major umbrellas/areas of inquiry your main sections\u2014the first level of Roman\nnumerals (I, II, III, etc.)\u2014and start adding subsections underneath. Your notes should help you a lot with this.\nThe second type of outlining is more organic. Baker calls this type a Content-Exploration Outline. This involves many of\nthe idea-generating activities we've done like brainstorming, mind mapping, and grouping as well as just plain writing\nsentences and paragraphs. This is like the type of topiary where a gardener sees a full-grown bush and starts trimming\nit from the outside-in to create a shape. You can group ideas and work on one area and then another as your paper\ntakes shape. You can write the sentences and paragraphs that feel the most fruitful and then work on another preferred\nsection next.\n250 Organic Content-Exploration Outlines take shape as you develop your ideas and even start writing. (Public Domain)\nYou can even write a whole rough draft and then create an outline in reverse to see the bigger picture of how you\norganized your ideas and revise from there. Many students don't recognize these activities as types of outlining, but\nthey are because they help organize your ideas, which is the whole point of a formal outline as well.\n\u201cOver the course of my 17-year writing career, I began to give up on outlining \u2014 that is, before I write. I\u2019ve\ncome to prefer a more organic approach to creation, first laying out my raw material on the page, then\nsearching for possible patterns that might emerge.\u201d\n\u2014Writer Aaron Hamburger (2013) in NY Times article \u201cOutlining in Reverse\u201d\nOf course, you can also have a combination of both types of outlines, which is what most students do. As you may have\nnoticed, the activities we've done earlier in this chapter have had the purpose of helping you to organize your ideas into\nthe shape of a paper. You might be tempted to skip this stage of the writing process, but research shows that if you take\nthe time to organize your ideas, your writing will be\nmore efficient (Kellogg, 1988),\nhigher quality (de Smet, Broekkamp, Brand-Gruwel, & Kirschner, 2011; Kellogg, 1987),\nand more satisfying in the end (Torrance, Thomas, & Robinson, 2000).\nThose are pretty good benefits!\nHere is an example of a Literature Review outline for one of my student's papers. Pay attention to the content but more\nimportantly, notice the structure of her paper.\nHome-Based Therapy for Children with Autism\n251 I. Introduction\nA. Autism Spectrum Disorder\n1. Definition\n2. Occurance\nB. Autistic children\n1. Current research/study methods\n2. Current treatments\na. In-home or in-school?\nII. How the environment affects autistic children\nA.

Effect on family\n2. How effective it is for the child\nC. Maybe quickly reiterate the future research needed?\n**I honestly could use any suggestions on how to organize this better. I've spent hours trying to organize my\nsources/info better but could use any thoughts y'all have on how to make it better!\n252 My favorite part about this outline is the comment at the end that this student invites any suggestions for improvement.\nThat shows exactly the right attitude when writing\u2014be open to feedback. The beauty of creating some type of outline\nnow is that you can get feedback on your ideas and organization before you go through the work of writing out all your\nbeautiful sentences and paragraphs.\nCreate an Outline\nNow start creating a rough outline of your paper. You can do this by making a detailed formal outline with\nRoman numerals or you can do the more organic approach and start writing out ideas, sentences, and\nparagraphs. But if you choose the second option, you also need to show that you're starting to organize those\nideas into a structure. You can read Chapter 12 if you want more details about the specific parts of a literature\nreview. Ask for feedback on your outline before you do more writing work.\nNow that you have a sense of the structure for your own Literature Review, you're ready to start drafting your paper.\nLuckily, Chapter 12 is all about drafting.\nReferences\nBaker, M.

But never fear! They will all lead to\nwriting a better paper.\n12.1 Draft and Synthesize\nFirst, I want you to watch this 10-minute video because it both reviews what we talked about in the last chapter and\nprovides great ways to get started on the actual writing of your paper. Here are some highlights to pay attention to:\n255 questions to ask as you take or review your notes that will guide your writing\nsuggestions for how to organize your notes. (Or actually, I should spell it \"organise\" with an \"s\" since the video\ncomes from Australia.)\nways to add interpretation to what you say about your sources\nlanguage to use to comment on the studies you're summarizing and synthesizing\nexamples of literature review synthesis\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/70n2-gAp7J0\nVideo Review\nWhat three strategies or elements from the video do you plan to incorporate into your own Literature Review?\nStart Drafting\nNow it's time to start drafting your paper. Follow the structure from your outline and start filling in the missing parts. Get\nout your notes and remind yourself of the sources you plan to talk about. You don't have to write your paper from\n256 beginning to end in order\u2014you can go to the parts that feel the easiest and start there. Here are some places you can\nstart:\nBullet-Point Draft\nWriting your Bullet Points should be as fast as this Bullet Train. Photo by Fikri Rasyid on Unsplash\nI often have my students start with a Bullet-Point draft that takes the ideas they've been outlining and fills them in with\nmore details but only in bullet-point form. The beauty of bullet points is that they keep you from getting caught up in the\nlanguage and style and allow you to focus simply on your main points. You can smooth out the sentences and\ntransitions later, but for now, just get your ideas on the page.\nWrite the Introduction\nAnother way to get started is to just write the Introduction. You already have a thesis statement that can go at the end,\nso now you can start introducing your topic and its importance, setting up your Literature Review. See below for more\nspecific help with Introductions.\nWrite a Body Paragraph\nOr a third place to start is to jump into writing a body paragraph that synthesizes your sources\u2014the way you did in that\nsynthesis activity earlier. Take your notes and choose one set to talk about in paragraph form.\nDon't think too hard about getting things perfect when you're drafting\u2014that's what revision is for. Just focus on getting\nstarted and filling in some of the missing pieces. If you get stuck, do some brainstorming activities to get your creative\n257 juices flowing. Once you have something written, I suggest seeking feedback to make sure you're going in the right\ndirection. In fact, I recommend getting as much feedback as possible along the way.\nStart Writing\nNow it's your turn to choose somewhere to start writing\u2014choose either a bullet-point draft, the introduction, a\nbody paragraph or something else. Then write the equivalent of at least one paragraph.\nHow to Write Each Section\nNow that you've jump-started the writing process, we'll go through each of the parts of your paper more in depth to help\nyou fill out a complete draft.\nIntroduction\nOnce you know what your main points will be, you're ready to introduce your ideas. As in any paper, you can't just jump\nright into your thesis statement and points; you need to set the stage first. Here are the elements of a good introduction\nto a literature review:\nA good introduction\nintroduces the topic and indicates its importance (impact on individuals)\ngives a context for the research question\ndefines key terms, concepts, and/or theories\nexplains what search methods were used and how many and what types of sources were reviewed (this is\nsometimes optional)\nsuggests the organization of the rest of the paper\nRemember in some style guides like the APA Manual, you don't need to title your Introduction \"Introduction\"\u2014you\nsimply center the title of your paper at the top of your page (bolded and in title capitalization format) and then jump right\ninto your first paragraph.\nTip: You don't always know where you're going when you start a paper, so just get a good draft of an introduction down.\nThen when you finish writing a first draft of your paper, read your conclusion and consider using some of it in your\nintroduction instead. I often tell my students that conclusions make good introductions because you finally know exactly\nwhere you went in your paper. Either way, you'll want to revisit your introduction once your paper's done so you can\nadjust it to better match where your paper went.\nIntroduction\nGet a start on your introduction by writing an opening sentence that introduces your topic and/or indicates its\nimportance. Then you can use that to jump start the rest of your introduction.\n258 Body\nThe body of your paper is where you can develop your points and use your newfound synthesis skills. Remember the\nsynthesis activity with the videos you did in the last chapter? As you create a draft, you can start composing paragraphs\nusing your awesome notes just like you practiced with those videos. Try to incorporate several sources into each\nparagraph to be sure that you're synthesizing and not just summarizing or listing without making connections. Your\ncolor-coded notes can help you be sure that each paragraph contains multiple sources.\nIn the body of your paper, you should\nsynthesize previous studies to inform the reader of the state of research\n\u201cidentify relations, contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the literature\u201d (APA Manual, p. 8)\ngroup your points into major headings and subheadings (You choose the arrangement based on what you\u2019ve\nfound: similar concepts or theories, similar methods, chronological development, controversies, etc.)\nsupport all points with sound reasoning or evidence drawn from sources and in which all borrowed information is\ndocumented\nsummarize sources most of the time, paraphrase sometimes, and use quotations very sparingly\u2014only when\nspecific wording is poignant or can\u2019t be said in any other way.\nOne way to talk about your sources is known as the CEC Method: Claim-Evidence-Commentary.\nClaim + Evidence + Commentary\nJust like any paragraph, you should start with a Topic sentence that acts as a mini-Thesis statement or a general claim\nabout your topic. Then you need to give evidence to support that claim. In a literature review, your evidence comes in\nthe form of studies that have been done\u2014all those brilliant notes you've been taking. This is where you can synthesize\nyour sources and show that they are related under the umbrella of a topic. However, just listing or summarizing sources\ndoes not make the connection between them and your topic sentence clear. This is where commentary comes in. Your\njob is also to comment on and interpret the significance of your \"evidence\" so your audience can understand the\nconnections between them. In synthesis, your language is the key.\nIn the next chapter, we'll talk more about how to do this, especially how to incorporate metacommentary into your\nparagraphs.\nAdd Metacommentary\nMetacommentary is the key to synthesis. metacommentary (aka metadiscourse) is a type of commentary that guides\nyour reader and helps them interpret the sources and evidence you're presenting. Think of it as really powerful\ntransitions. First, let's remind ourselves what transitions are. Transition words act like signposts\u2014they guide your reader\nthrough your points. They can also glue your ideas together so they feel more cohesive. Beware that transitions can\ndefinitely be overdone, but I'd say most students in general could use more transitions in their papers rather than fewer.\n259 Add signposts to your writing to guide your reader. Photo by Dallas on Flickr.\nHere's an awesome list of transition words (also linked in the frame below) that are grouped by category from the\nfamous Purdue OWL (Online Writing Lab\u2014scroll down to see the list). You can also download a great handout from the\nUniversity of Maryland here.\nI always suggest that my students keep a categorized transition list like this handy as they write so that when they know\nthey want to connect ideas in a certain way (e.g. to show contrast), you can easily find a good list of options (e.g. in\ncontrast, conversely, etc.). Not only will transitions help your ideas feel more connected, they will also smooth out your\nwriting style like butter.\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-xpEK\nhttps://open.byu.edu/-wzm\nYou might think you can just stop at transition words, but metacommentary is much more than just sprinkling some\n\"therefores\" and \"howevers\" throughout your paper\u2014metacommentary actually takes your synthesis to the next level.\nRemember the Claim-Evidence-Commentary pattern I've mentioned? The commentary part of that sandwich is where\nyou should focus right now. What do you comment on? You can either highlight why a source is important or connect it\nwith other sources. This is your chance to point out the answers to the four questions you looked for in your note-taking:\n1. What do researchers agree and disagree about?\n2. How are researchers narrowing or changing their focus to create new information?\n3. What are each study\u2019s limitations and strengths?\n4. What\u2019s the next step in research\u2014what should be studied in the future? (The research gap)\nYou can think of metacommentary as a sandwich with your name on it. If my student's name were Alisa, here's what an\n\"Alisa sandwich\" would look like:\nALISA\u2014SOURCE\u2014ALISA\n260 First, Alisa starts with a claim about what's happening in the field or about a particular subsection or focus of the\nfield. This could serve as a topic sentence for a paragraph, for example.\nSecond, she sets up the source with guiding language like transitions and references to her past points or sources.\nThird, she talks about the source itself and summarizes pertinent information.\nLastly, Alisa comments on the source and/or connects it to her main point or to next source.\nThis metacommentary is a lot like the interpretation mentioned in the video at the beginning of this chapter. This type of\n\"sandwich\" can occur several times in a paragraph as you synthesize your sources. Here's a sample paragraph from\nChris, a Public Health student, (check this) who wrote a paper called \"The Causes of a Behavioral Pandemic: Screen-\ntime Addiction and Consequent Depression Among Adolescents.\" I've bolded the metacommentary Chris had added to\nguide his readers and to connect his points together.\nEven though there have been far fewer studies on adolescents than adults, adolescent studies have\nconsistently shown that those who are more physically active experience less depressive and associated\nsymptoms, as well as a greater overall state of well-being (Kremer 2014). These studies have also shown\nthat low levels of vigorous exercise in youth can independently cause depressive symptoms. One\nlongitudinal study revealed that over 30% of children who participate in high levels of screen-time use\nexperience moderate to high levels of depressive symptoms (Kremer 2014). Additionally, another study\nof children in the United States demonstrated that those who participated on a sports team were less likely\nto exceed recommended screen-time limits established by the US Department of Health. This study also\ndemonstrated that as the number of total physical activity sessions increased among youth, both during\nfree time and at organized events, children were less likely to exceed recommended screen-time limits\n(Carlson 2010). In this study, children who were more physically active consistently showed lower rates of\ndepression and other emotional disorders. Therefore, evidence across multiple studies suggests that\nparticipating in screen-time activity may not be the direct cause of depressive symptoms, but rather the\nsedentary lifestyle and lack physical activity it causes among youth. With this recent evidence, experts\nare beginning to search for ways to replace screen-time participation of adolescents with physical\nactivities.\nNote how the last few sentences of this paragraph consist entirely of metacommentary\u2014points that connect to the\nbigger picture of Chris's literature review. Also notice how Chris uses transition words and phrases to glue his points\ntogether so it doesn't come out of the blue when he brings up a new study. Chris also talks about more than one study\nin this paragraph, demonstrating his ability to synthesize and not just summarize. Without the metacommentary, it\nwould be much harder to see the connections between the studies and how they fit into the bigger picture. Finally, Chris\nindicates the implications of these studies and points to what researchers are doing next. This has a dual purpose of\nreminding readers why this topic is important as well as indicating where he will go in his next paragraph (about\nphysical activities). Metacommentary is powerful!\nMetacommentary takes practice, but you can do it! And it will not only make your points stronger, it will make it easier\nfor your audience to read and understand\u2014which should always be your goal.\nIf You Get Stuck\nLiterature reviews can be hard. If you get stuck, I have a little trick I tell my students. For your first draft, try starting\nevery sentence with \"Researchers . . .\" I know this seems formulaic, but if you can keep your focus on what particular\n261 researchers did or what they agree or disagree on, you'll avoid the most common pitfalls of literature reviews: sounding\nlike a typical argumentative research paper. If your focus is always on what researchers are doing or what they've\nfound, then at the very least you'll stay in the realm of the literature review genre. Later you can go back through and\nchange up your sentence structure, but I've found that this is an easy way for students to get through a first draft.\nA Quick Word on Verb Tense\nStudents often ask about verb tense in relation to literature reviews\u2014do you say that someone \"conducted a study\" in\npast tense? But then what if you're saying that \"researchers agree\" about something? That's in present tense. I use this\nrule of thumb: if you're talking about something specific that was completed in the past, use the past tense. If you're\ntalking about a current attitude or something currently accepted in a field, then use present tense. For example, if you\nsay that you conducted a review of the literature, then that's over and done with, so you should use the past tense. Or if\nyou want to talk about a particular study that was done, then use the past tense, too. But if you want to say that\nresearchers in general currently agree about something, then you can use the present tense.\nThings get a little trickier when you talk about what's happened by researchers in the field in general rather than talking\nabout a specific study. For example, if many people have studied hoverboard technology, then you should talk about it in\nthat same tense\u2014they \"have studied.\" That's called the present perfect tense (the verb \"to have\" + past participle). You\ndon't need to remember the name\u2014just the fact that you can use this tense when you want to say that researchers in\nthe field \"have done\" something in general or that a review of a topic \"has been done.\" So here's a table based on the\nwork of Feak and Swales (2009) to sum this up:\nTense Reference Example\nPast Tense A Single Study or Event McFly (1989) investigated the usefulness of hoverboards in a chase.\nGenerally Accepted One of the most promising areas of hoverboard technology is the use of\nPresent Tense\nKnowledge of the Field electromagnets (Allain, 2015).\nPresent Perfect The usefulness of skateboards in a chase has been widely researched\nAn Area of Inquiry\nTense (McFly, 1985; McFly, 1989; McFly, 1990).\nVerb Tenses to Use in Literature Reviews\nDiscussion/Conclusion\nYour last section will either be called discussion or conclusion (or will possibly not have a heading depending on your\nteacher's preferences or the style guide you're following). In an effective Discussion (aka Conclusion) section you\nshould\ndo more than sum up what you have said (though you should do that as well)\nexplain where there are gaps and limitations in the previous research done\nindicate recommendations for future research based on those gaps\nAt the end of this section,\n262 restate your position (thesis statement)\nshow the implications of your findings\nReferences\nYou must also include a list of your References (also known as a Bibliography or Works Cited page depending on the\ndocumentation style) showing all the sources you referred to in your paper. Your references page must be in\nalphabetical order and formatted according to your chosen style guide (see Chapter 9: Talking About Sources).\nOther Elements\nYour teacher might require you to include these other elements in your Literature Review paper. Be sure to follow the\nformat from your style guide.\nTitle Page\nI've waited until now to talk about titles because it's wise to wait until you have a good draft before you choose a title.\nWhy? Because you often don't know exactly where your paper will go until you've written it out. Your title is your\nreaders' first entry into your paper, so you want it to be interesting and also reflect what's inside. Your title should also\ninclude as much information as possible while remaining appropriately short and sweet. For example, the APA Manual\nrecommends not using extraneous words but sticking to the main point of your paper. My student Justin's title follows\nthis model:\nImplications of Chinese Involvement on Africa's Economy\nHe basically summarizes his main point in one succinct statement\u2014the ultimate summary. APA would be proud.\n263 The Mullet. Business in the front, party in the back. Image on Wikimedia\nHowever, depending on your sub-field in the Social Sciences, many scholars like to do what I call a \"reverse mullet.\" As\nyou might know, the rad '80s mullet haircut that's short on top and long in the back has been described as\nThe Mullet: Business in the front, party in the back\nA mullet starts with the serious and ends with the fun. But academic titles often do the reverse: they have an interesting\nintroductory phrase, then a colon, and then the standard, more serious title. That's why I call them the\n264 Reverse Mullet: Party in the front, business in the back. Photo by Weidmaier\nThe Reverse Mullet: Party in the front, Business in back\nA reverse mullet title gets the reader's attention before adding the serious explanation. For example, one of my students\nnamed Katelyn wrote her Literature Review on how much high school students' perception of their teachers was\ninfluenced by their teachers' apparel. Her title included a Reverse Mullet structure:\nKeeping it Class-y: How Formality of Teacher Apparel Affects\nStudent Perceptions of the Teacher in the Classroom\nBecause her field is education (Social Science Teaching), this second type of title structure is appropriate and adds\ninterest. You can talk to your writing teacher or the professors in your major to find out which type of title would be most\nappropriate for you to use in your field. If you want to just play it safe, stick with a plain title, but know you might be\nmissing a chance to draw your readers in.\nWhat else should go on your title page besides your title?\nYour Name (centered)\nYour Teacher's Name (centered on the next line)\nA Page Number (in the top right corner that's continued throughout the paper)\nOptional: the Name of the School or Department\nOptional: the Name/Number of Your Course (e.g., English 315)\nOptional: the Date\n265 Your title and these additions should go in the middle of the page. Of course, your teacher is the best person to ask\nabout formatting requirements and will usually give you clear instructions. If you have questions, ask.\nAbstract\nYou should save writing your abstract until after you've completed your paper because it's a summary of the main points\nof your paper. You can try writing a preliminary abstract now as a type of outline, but you run the risk of finding out that\nonce you're done with your paper, you actually went in some different directions. My advice is to hold off and wait to\nwrite the abstract until the end. You can create a page after the title page where your abstract will go, but to emphasize\nthat you should write this last, we'll wait to cover the details of writing an an abstract until the next section.\nAppendix\nIf you have tables or figures ( or formulas or other data) that are too big to be added inside the text of your paper, you\ncan put them at the end. If you only have oneAppendix, you can call it just that. But if you have more than one, call\nthem Appendix A, Appendix B, etc. and refer to them as such in the text of your paper.\nTables and Figures\nOne more element that could be helpful to your paper is to include tables and/or figures. You're probably familiar with\nTables (you know, the boxes with lots of horizontal and vertical cells). A Figure is any type of image, graph, or chart\nbesides a table. You can use tables or figures from your sources as long as you cite them properly. You can also create\nyour own table or figure either from existing data or to explain a concept. See Chapter 6: Design for the details of how\nto create, use, or format tables and figures. Just remember to check your style guide; for example, in APA Format, you\nneed to title and number your tables and figures separately.\nI hope you feel like you have a better sense of the structure for your own Literature Review paper. In the next chapter,\nwe'll talk about how to draft and revise your paper.\n12.2 Write an Abstract\nWe're not talking about this kind of abstract! (Public Domain)\nNot that kind of abstract! As great as abstract art is, what you need now is the abstract of your paper. (Note: some\nteacher's won't require an abstract, so you can skip this section in that case.) Why do you think we've saved the\nabstract for last even though it's the first thing your audience will read (after your title)? You guessed it: it's because the\n266 abstract is a summary of everything you've talked about in your paper, so if you haven't written your paper yet, it's pretty\nhard to summarize it.\nA lot of students think that the abstract is a preview of your paper that simply invites the reader to learn more. But that's\nnot the purpose of the abstract, that's the purpose of the Introduction. If your paper were a movie, your abstract would\nnot be the movie trailer. A movie trailer is an invitation to see more without giving away too much; that's the point of your\nIntroduction. Instead, your abstract would be the movie plot synopsis. It would have a big SPOILER ALERT sign in front\nof it because in it you want to give away all the punchlines from your paper. In fact, the more you include your most\nimportant points or findings, the better. Because readers might only ever read your abstract, you want the most\nimportant information there. Then just like you did in your own database searching, they will decide based on the\nabstract whether they should open your paper and read more details. Your job is to make sure they have the best\ninformation to do that.\nAn abstract has a few main parts that mirror the parts of your paper but in miniature. First, in 1-2 sentences, you should\nintroduce the topic, its importance, and the problem or question you tried to answer. Then you should succinctly explain\nyour methods (database searching) and the scope of your project. The last and largest part should consist of your main\nfindings such as the main areas of inquiry where researchers are congregating. You should include the major strengths\nand limitations (gaps) you found in your review. Finally, you should explain any implications of your study and suggest\nwhere future research should go. See? A miniature paper. It should be so miniature, that the APA Manual says an\nabstract should not exceed 250 words. At the end, you can also list a few Keywords to make it easy to search for your\npaper on databases.\nTo solidify your understanding of how to write an abstract, watch this 3-minute video from the University of Melbourne\nthat takes you through a good example. Try not to get distracted by their awesome Australian accents.\n267 Watch on YouTube\nNow if you would like more details, you can refer to this explanation.\n12.3 The Real Last Step: Revise (and Revise and Revise)\nRevision means re-vision. Photo by pine watt on Unsplash\nThe best writers revise (and revise and revise). Think back to Chapter 3: Writing Processes and the section on\nRevision. You need to think like your audience, which means you have to get out of your own head and think mindfully.\nOne way to do this is to revise with purpose or in other words, with specific goals in mind.\nYou can't revise without a decent draft, so don't blow off the first draft deadline. The better your first draft, the better your\npaper will be in the end because you'll have enough time to really look at your paper. Actually re-look at your paper, or\nin other words, re-vise. Get it? Re-vision?\nSo how can you get out of your own head? Two ways: people and levels. The first way to get a fresh perspective is\naudience-oriented revision: peer review, teacher conferences, writing center appointments, and other outside feedback\nfrom real, live people.\n268 Get Feedback!\nSeek feedback! Photo by Jon Tyson on Unsplash\nWhen you find out how other people react to your paper, it will give you invaluable perspective into what's working and\nwhat's not. This is feedback and is extremely valuable. Your teacher should help you do these kinds of peer reviews and\nrevisions in class.\nFeedback can also come from anyone\u2014friends, teachers, relatives, Writing Center tutors, roommates\u2014just be sure to\nchoose someone you trust who also knows about good writing and won't hesitate to tell you where you can improve. I\ndon't know your grandma, but if she's the type of grandma who will tell you your paper is great no matter what's in it\nbecause you're just so nice, then run away! Okay, don't really run away from your grandma\u2014she's probably very loving\nand supportive. Give her a hug instead. However, don't give your paper to your grandma to critique in that case. My\ngrandma is actually a fantastic writer and wouldn't be afraid to tell me where I can improve. Do give your paper to\nsomeone like my grandma.\nHere's a tip: Most universities have a Writing Center where you can take your paper to a Writing Tutor for\nhelp and feedback for free. Do it! It's free! And they can even meet with you online.\nWe're lucky at BYU that we even have our very own Social Science-specific Writing Center: the FHSS Writing Lab.\nThey know Literature Reviews well and can help you with any stage of the writing process from selecting a topic to\nciting sources to synthesis. If you have more general writing questions (or if you need an appointment after 5pm), you\ncan also go to the main BYU Research & Writing Center. They also offer online appointments. If you're not on our\ncampus, look up your school's writing center.\nAs an undergrad, my husband didn't start out with the best writing skills, so he used to take his papers to the BYU\nWriting Center over and over and over. I think they made the rule that you can only go once a day because of him. And\n269 guess what? It helped! His grades went up! That was his secret to success that I'm passing on to you. Your teacher\ndoesn't have time to personally meet with each student over and over and over, but the Writing Tutors are literally paid\nto do just that. Well, maybe keep your visits to only one per day, but you get what I mean. Take advantage! Make an\nappointment right now! Did I mention that it's free?\nIf you need more motivation to just do it, watch this \"motivational\" video by Shia Le Boeuf.\nRevise by Levels\nThe second way to improve your paper is to go through a layered revision process focusing on global and then local\nissues. As you re-see your paper, take my advice and tackle Global Revision before you focus on Local Revision. What\ndo I mean by that? Let me tell you a quick story.\nA Revision Story Involving Cats\nWhen my family and I were moving to our town, we looked at a lot of houses online. We fell in love with a beautiful old\nhouse that had been totally renovated but was selling at a shockingly low price. When we finally visited the house with\nour realtor, we discovered why it had been on the market for so long: it smelled like cat pee. Like really, really smelled. It\nturns out the house had been occupied by what many people would call a \"crazy cat lady\"\u2014an older woman who lived\nwith at least 50 cats. Then tragically, a fire completely destroyed the house (I'm pretty sure the woman and her cats\nsurvived).\nTo protect the innocent, this is not the infamous cat house but is close to what it looked like. Photo by Jessica Furtney\non Unsplash\n270 The home owner used $400,000 of insurance money to beautifully restore the house. They rebuilt the intricate wooden\nstaircase, restored the stately crown molding, installed lush carpet, and added upgrades to a gorgeous kitchen. The\nonly problem was that they did their restoration in the wrong order\u2014they took care of the local issues of paint color and\ncarpet thickness while ignoring the more global issue of the smell. Eventually, they had to rip up all their work in the\nbasement in order to treat the floor with a special enzyme that combated cat urine. If they'd just treated the cat smell\nfirst, then they could have saved themselves thousands of dollars, hours of work, and could have sold their house for a\nmuch higher price.\nThe Moral of the Story\nAlways get rid of the cat pee (global issues) first! Photo by Andrew Umansky on Unsplash\nWhat does all this have to do with revision? You've got it\u2014treat the global issues first! Get rid of the cat pee! Don't worry\nabout local issues like flowery language or sentences that connect perfectly to each other if you're just going to have to\ncompletely renovate that section later. Work on the global issues like ideas, logical order, and evidence first and wait\nuntil those are intact before focusing on the details. Put another way, whole-paper and paragraph-level revisions should\ncome before sentence-level and word-level changes.\nAs a final gift, fantastic BYU Family Science professor Julie Haupt offers the following path for doing four purposeful\nrevisions\u2014two global revisions and two local revisions. If you really want to improve your literature review, follow these\nsteps.\n271 GLOBAL REVISION\u2014The Forest\nFirst, look at the forest, not the trees. Photo by Frederico Bottos on Unsplash\nLevel 1: Structural Review (Global)\nPurpose: The structural review examines the document as a whole to see if all requirements are met and the\ndocument\u2019s organization is sound.\nMeet Assignment Requirements. Ask yourself if your paper meets all the requirements of the assignment? Look at your\nstructure and make sure you have all necessary sections such as the following:\nTitle Page\nAbstract\nIntroduction (with Thesis Statement and/or Organizing Statement)\nBody with Headings\nConclusion/Discussion\nReferences\nInclude a Thesis and an Organizing Statement. Does the current version of the thesis statement match the tone, scope,\nand organization of the body text? Does an organizing statement after the thesis introduce the major topics and the\norder they will appear in the body (e.g., \u201cIn this review, I will first discuss . . . then . . . and finally . . .)\n272 Use Headings. Is the body text subdivided in a logical way with evidence-based information located in appropriate\nsections? Are the major sections roughly symmetrical (in terms of length)? Are the headings brief, yet descriptive? If\nsubheadings are used, does the major section contain at least two? Are all levels of headings separated by text?\nLevel 2 (Global): Paragraph/Logic Review\nPurpose: The Paragraph/Logic Review is designed to review each paragraph for cohesion and compliance to the CEC\n(Claim-Evidence-Commentary) format.\nSequence Paragraphs Effectively. When reading only the first sentence of each paragraph, does the logical pattern of\nthe paper emerge? Do the claims made in these topic sentences coordinate well with the thesis of the paper?\nCheck Topic Sentences and Cohesion. Does the topic sentence or claim provide an effective overview of the\ninformation that is located in the paragraph? Is the claim supported by several points of synthesized evidence, rather\nthan a single study? Does each paragraph seem well directed and cohesive? Do the sentences build one upon another\nwithin the paragraph in a logical way?\nEvaluate Paragraph Length. Are any paragraphs too long (longer than approximately \u00bd page)? Are any paragraphs too\nshort (approximately three sentences or less)? Do paragraphs transition well from one to the next and use transitional\nwords to connect ideas?\nLOCAL REVISION\u2014The Tree\nIn Local Revision, you'll pay more attention to the details of the \"tree.\" Photo by Petr Kratochvil on Pixabay\n273 Level 3 (Local): APA Formatting Review\nPurpose: The APA Formatting Review is designed to make sure all APA conventions are explicitly followed to help the\npaper reflect a high level of professionalism.\nCheck Document Formatting. Do the title page, abstract, body text, and reference page appear in the correct page\nformatting as required? (Use the APA Manual if you have questions.)\nExamine the Reference List Closely. Are all references in the reference list ordered alphabetically? Is the reference list\ndouble spaced entirely (with no extra gaps between paragraphs)? Are all references (e.g., journal articles, internet\nresources, or books) listed in the correct format? Is every reference on the reference list cited at least once in the body\nand does each in-text citation have a corresponding reference in the reference list?\nMake a Final Check of the In-Text Citations. Is all information properly cited with an in-text citation when needed? Do\nall in-text citations include the year next to the author(s)? When more than one citation is listed within parentheses are\nthey separated by semi-colons and ordered alphabetically by first author\u2019s last name? If included in parentheses, do\nstudies with multiple authors use ampersands (\"&\" rather than the word \"and\") before listing the last author?\nUse \u201cet al.\u201d Correctly. If a study has three or more authors, do you include only the first author\u2019s last name + et al. +\npublication year in in-text citations? Do you include all authors up to 20 in the References page? For any publications\nwith 21 or more authors, do you include the first 19 authors' name, then insert an ellipsis ( . . . ), and then the last\nauthor's name?\nLevel 4 (Local): Finishing Review\nPurpose: The Finishing Review is an opportunity to look closely at sentence construction, language, hedging (qualifying\nstatements), and grammar/punctuation.\nReview Phrasing with a Read-Aloud Session. Read your paper aloud. Since having to read a sentence twice to get its\nmeaning or \u201ctripping over\u201d phrasing can be an indication of awkward construction, are all sentences easily read aloud?\nAre any sentences so long that they have become difficult to comprehend, but could be split without changing the\nmeaning?\nUse Non-Biased, Non-Absolute Language. Do all references to people comply with the \u201cpeople first\u201d designation and\navoid inappropriate uses of terms for various groups? Are the findings and summary statements in the review properly\n\u201chedged\u201d?\nCheck Punctuation and Grammar.

But as I started falling for Jason, my desire for\nwritten flirtation was left unanswered\u2014my windshield wipers and mirrors were perpetually empty. As a words gal (I\nteach writing for a living; you can guess my primary love language), I craved words on a page as a final persuasion that I\nshould fully dive into a relationship with a guy who had me smitten in just about every other way.\n279 The two of us about an hour after I accepted my now-husband's written marriage proposal. (Courtesy of the author.)\nLuckily for me, and our two girls who wouldn\u2019t be here without us, Jason knew his audience. And so on the night he\nproposed, while we sat cozy on the bench seat in a truck parked on the side of the road, he gave me the first and only\nlove letter that I\u2019ve ever received from him. The letter genuinely detailed his feelings and what he hoped for our future.\nHe loosely outlined a problem\u2014racing-heart, weak-knees, dizzy-head love\u2014and a solution\u2014his hope that I would agree\nto a life-and-beyond partnership and commitment. I said yes. I\u2019m oversimplifying the decision just a bit, but essentially,\nthe love letter sealed the deal.\nWhen we face life\u2019s sticky issues, whether they be, ahem, marriage relationship decisions, or more broadly\u2014civic\nproblems, community projects, research ideas, social concerns, or heck, even a lengthy school essay, it's often difficult\nto tackle a complex project alone. As we start to visualize solutions to problems, we often discover we need buy-in from\nsomeone else (or a group of someones) to make stuff happen.\nA proposal is one way to get buy-in from the people you need to make things happen. We write proposals to persuade\nan audience to support a suggested action plan. You\u2019ll find proposals that ask for dollars to finance a project, skills and\nresources to boost a venture, or simply permission to proceed. A proposal asks a specific audience to address a\nspecific problem by supporting your efforts on a specific course of action. Specificity is key.\n280 Local school districts submit proposals to receive federal government funding for Head Start, a research-backed\nprogram for early childhood education\nThe uses of a proposal document are as diverse as the problems they address. To flood you with examples\u2014charity\norganizations submit grant proposals to various donors asking for funding to initiate a new projects or sustain efforts;\ncontractors submit bids (proposals) to complete work on construction projects; city councils file proposals asking for\nfunding to improve city infrastructure; entrepreneurs request investment money for business start-ups; teachers write\ngrant proposals asking for additional classroom equipment; venues pitch their location for an event; employees suggest\nideas for solving company problems to higher-ups; academics submit proposals seeking permission to present at\nprofessional conferences; researchers seek funding to conduct research; graduate students ask for go-ahead from\nfaculty to proceed with a large project.\nAt times, proposals are submitted as part of a competitive process\u2014only the best proposals are given the nod. Other\ntimes, proposals are a stepping stone to ensure preparation and readiness before the wish is granted. Proposals can be\nsolicited as part of an official process or program to award funding or support. Or they are sometimes submitted to an\naudience unsolicited, delivered on the guts and prayers of the writer.\nProposals in Your Life\nConsider a time when you\u2019ve requested something specific from someone\u2014 a proposal of sorts. How did you\nask for the support?\nProposals in the Social Sciences\nAs a social scientist, proposal documents will help you rally support from the right people as you move from a question\nor gap in the literature into experimentation, from uncovered research into papers or presentations, and from\nestablished conclusions into real-life applications. Social science is social. Use proposals to bring the social, the right\n281 people and resources, to your science. There are many types of proposals, and the categories blend and blur, but here\nare a two broad types of proposals you might encounter in the social sciences: research grants and prospectuses.\nResearch Grants\nDiscovering and documenting ideas has a cost, and often that cost can be measured in dollars and cents. In the social\nsciences, thinkers (students, faculty, researchers, etc.) often request funding to complete a research project through\ngrants. The money can be used to subsidize time, travel, materials, experts, and other resources needed. Research\ngrants are offered by universities, by invested organizations, and government agencies. For example, see grants.gov for\nlists of federal funding grants.\nUndergraduate Research Grants\nBudding student social scientists can submit proposals to apply for research grants specifically available for\nundergraduate research within colleges and departments and/or through university libraries. Many of these\nopportunities require collaboration with a faculty member, which deepens the possibilities and enriches the experience.\nHave a good idea for a project? Find a faculty member who is willing to back you up, write a solid proposal using this\nchapter, and you have a decent chance of getting funds to make it happen.\nA recent BYU student research project looked at shyness and its effects on romantic relationship expectations and\nsatisfaction. The funding for the project was achieved through submission of a proposal.\nTalk to faculty, college advisers, and librarians to discover these undergraduate opportunities for project funding. Be on\nthe lookout for posters and emails within your college department advertising deadlines and requirements. Even\nuniversity libraries often offer research funding for using their materials to complete a project.\n282 You can find Brigham Young University's Harold B. Lee Library undergraduate research grant information here. And to\naccess specific examples of undergraduate-faculty collaborative research projects completed with grant funding at\nBrigham Young University, visit the Journal of Undergraduate Research, which publishes the final write-ups of funded\nprojects in each department.\nProspectuses\nA proposal to write a substantive research paper or book is often called a prospectus. Social scientists write this type of\nproposal when dealing with written research projects or books.\nA prospectus is a proposal that pitches a research project, often written to seek approval from a faculty mentor.\nAt its heart, a prospectus is about getting on the same page with faculty who will support your project. It's the same with\nproposals as a whole\u2014getting on the same page with those who have the power to support your project.\nIn graduate programs and upper-level undergraduate courses, you might find students working on prospectus\ndocuments that detail their ideas and plans to complete a large research project, a master\u2019s thesis, or doctoral\ndissertation. These prospectuses pitch a topic and plan for the larger writing/research project.\nA prospectus document is usually submitted to a faculty member or committee who has the power to approve project\nplans and give the student go-ahead and support. A prospectus is used to ensure student preparation, determine\nstudent focus on a significant issue worth researching, and establish student/faculty agreement on a feasible plan\nbefore a student is released to dive headlong into databases and drafting.\nAs subsets of proposals, we'll talk about both research grants and prospectuses under the broader title, proposals, in\nthe rest of the chapter.\nCreating a Proposal\nEach opportunity to write a proposal will be distinct. Some calls for proposals will have specific templates; some won\u2019t.\nThey will differ in expectations regarding page count, section headings, and detail level. We can\u2019t tackle\u2014nor do I know\u2014\nall the nuances and requirements of each and every proposal.\n283 But this I do know: as a proposal writer, you\u2019re expected to uphold specific expectations and comply with any diverse\nspecifications that might be required by your audience, the people with the power to bestow a blessing of resources,\nfunding, or permission. Your ability to meet and exceed an audience\u2019s unique expectations will determine how willingly\nthey say yes.\nSo don\u2019t write a proposal before doing homework: read all provided instructions, use the provided template if given one,\ntalk to those with experience on the specific proposal, and scrutinize successful proposal examples in each unique\ncircumstance to determine your audience\u2019s expectations.\nProposals are written in the mode of problem and solution. Your job is to demonstrate that there is a problem for which\nyou have a unique solution. And then your job is to present the solution\u2014propose and pitch the solution and course of\naction\u2014to the specific problem.\nSo, identify a specific problem or question in your area of interest. Then design a plan, study, or project to address it.\nAnd finally describe the plan and method in detail in a proposal for the big-wigs.\nUnderstanding Proposal Requirements\nWhich of the following options are good ways to find out and meet the specific requirements of a proposal\nopportunity?\nReview examples of past successful proposals for the specific opportunity.\nTalk with decision-makers who will review the proposals to discover their expectations for the\ndocument.\nFind and mimic any provided templates for the specific proposal opportunity.\nAsk those who have submitted proposals in the past for advice.\nRead and re-read the posted \"call for proposals\" information to understand decision-maker\npriorities.\nAll of the above.\nProposal Sections\nAs I've said, proposal formats vary widely. But more than likely, most proposal specifications will ask you to create a\ndocument with sections to address the main core questions. Let\u2019s consider some of the common sections you might\nencounter and how they address questions that you need to answer. Obviously, order and specific headings will vary in\neach proposal depending on the listed requirements.\n284 Title\nMost proposals ask you for a title. Create a vibrant, engaging title with specific, clear articulation of your problem and/or\nsolution to make your audience want to learn more. Think of your title as the hook to get your audience to continue.\nTwo-part titles with a colon allow more space for specificity. Be sure to follow capitalization rules for titles in the\ndesired writing style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.).\nIntroduction/Purpose\nWhat is the proposed action or solution? What does the writer want to\ndo?\nThe authors of a research proposal at BYU wanted to look at the role of genes in how individuals cope with stress. This\nwas the aim of their exploration as presented in their proposal.\nHere you include a brief overview of the purpose of the proposal. You establish the proposed action or solution in\ngeneral terms\u2014your goal at the outset. Sometimes, this section doesn\u2019t have an obviously marked header, but is rather\nthe first paragraph(s) to launch the document.\nWhen writing a proposal for a possible research paper (a prospectus, as we discussed earlier), you likely won't know the\nfull nuance of your thesis or conclusions exactly. But you should have questions about your topic that have narrowed\nyour scope of exploration. Announce an aim, goal, and/or scope as a starting point.\nSet-up your stylistic voice and tone right away. While you should write appropriately for the circumstance and audience,\navoid dull or diluted writing. Be clear, vibrant, and direct. In a competitive proposal process, reviewers may only read the\ntitle and introduction before deciding whether to give more consideration to the proposal. Be interesting; don\u2019t let them\nstop reading.\n285 Problem/Question\nWhy is it proposed? What is the problem, question, need, or goal to\naddress? And how is it important to both the writer and the decision-\nmakers?\nThis section establishes the need and importance for the proposal\u2014a why for the proposal.\nIn this section, explain how you recognized a question begging for an answer, a problem itching for a solution. If\npersonal reasons are driving your question or problem, in some proposal circumstances it is appropriate to detail these\nmotives in this first section. Read through sample proposals in similar circumstances to see if personal motives are\nappropriate to include in yours.\nYou will also want to use this section to demonstrate your understanding of the conversation surrounding the question,\nproblem, need or goal; show that you've reviewed the literature/research/conversation surrounding your topic. You can\ndo this by incorporating ideas and context from other researchers or thinkers on the issue. As you do, suggest how your\nproject is distinct from others, but how it fits in the context of a larger conversation. If you\u2019ve written a review of\nliterature around a certain question or topic prior to drafting a proposal (which you can read more about in the Literature\nReview chapters of this book), you would incorporate an overview of your literature review conclusions in this section.\nBe aware that proposals might ask you to include more than just an overview of your literature review conclusions in\nyour proposal. Some proposals require a separate, more lengthy literature review discussion as part of your submission\nto demonstrate a more thorough understanding of context. If so, it is likely to be included earlier or later in the proposal\ndocument as a separate section and thus would be less likely to be included here in this section. As always, follow the\nspecific guidelines for each unique proposal opportunity to decide how to include literature review content. Include a\nreference page in the appropriate citation style as necessary.\nBy seeking to understand the relationship between punk music and activism specifically in Belfast, Ireland, one proposal\nwriter sought to illuminate how music generates and motivates activism generally.\nAnd as a final, most important, step in this section, persuade the audience that the question, problem, need, or goal is\n(or should be) important to them. As with all good writing, a writer is most effective when writing toward the values and\nconcerns of their audience. This is especially important when the audience holds power to determine your (or your\nproject's) fate. In providing your audience with a statement or narrative of the problem, present convincing evidence that\nthe problem matters now and the time to address the problem is now. Make a solid case that the problem is ripe, ready\nto be addressed\u2014and you are the one for the job.\n286 Objectives/Solutions/Outcomes\nHow will the proposed action/solution effectively solve the problem,\nanswer the question, meet the need, or achieve the goal that the\naudience now agrees is important?\nIn this section, identify what you plan to produce, specifically any tangible outcomes you anticipate. Outline the\nspecifics of your end product, contribution, or solution, which might be a publication, presentation, performance,\ninvention, new metric achievement, lecture, physical object, or a paper. For starters, as an undergraduate proposing a\nresearch paper, you might anticipate presenting your project at an undergraduate research conference\u2014many\nuniversities have them in each department.\nIf you are writing a proposal for a paper (a prospectus), you will likely outline the thesis, organization, and contents of\nyour eventual project. Some writers incorporate a traditional outline here\u2014roman numerals and all. For a longer project,\nyou might break-down a book chapter-by-chapter with summaries. Or this section simply might be a single paragraph\nwith sentences addressing each sub-topic of your project. Show your audience that the output of your efforts will make\nan impact in resolving the specified need.\nMethod/Schedule\nIs the writer capable of planning, managing, and completing the\nproposed action?\nWe\u2019ve come to the broadest section\u2014and the most varied in style and requirement across the proposal spectrum. This\nsection asks you to breakdown a plan to generate your end product, using concrete information such as method,\ntimelines, data, steps, cost, equipment or facilities needed, wages or personnel required, feasibility, consequences or\nexpected results. Graphs, charts, bulleted schedules or timeline goals, and budgets are not unusual here. Show how,\nwhere, and when the work will be completed.\nCommitting to a timeline will demonstrate your ability to complete the proposed project.\nFor a proposal that pitches a large project or paper, you will likely outline a timeline estimating your agenda for\ncompleting the phases of research and drafting. As you draft your timeline, consider prior commitments you\u2019ve made in\n287 other areas of your life and plan accordingly. Write a month-by-month, week-by-week, or day-by-day schedule with how\nyou plan to complete your project, depending on the scope. The timeline must be a realistic vision of your ability to\ncomplete the work in the time. You might consider giving deadlines for the following intermediate steps: beginning\nresearch, assembling a preliminary bibliography, taking notes, writing a first draft, gathering feedback, and writing a final\ndraft.\nIncluding a task timeline is especially helpful if your research is complicated with interviews, surveys, data collection,\nand other primary research methods. In research and statistics classes within your field you will learn various methods\nfor creating quantitative and qualitative data. Outline your specific, statistically-sound plan for generating data within\nthis section. Get down to the nitty-gritty of how you\u2019re going to get the job done.\nQualifications\nDoes the writer have qualified personnel involved?\nYou don\u2019t need to be Einstein; you don\u2019t need to be brilliant (well, more than you already are). As a student in your field,\nyou are qualified to address a problem, question, need, or goal in your field. Briefly list your education and directly\nrelevant previous experience. It might be just a sentence or two. This section may or may not be necessary when\ndrafting a proposal for a fairly straightforward project.\nIf you are engaging in complex statistical research or another project that demands technical skills or specific abilities,\nyou might need to persuade your audience that you are qualified by noting any specific background, training, or\nexpertise you have (or will get) that will help you do your work well.\nYou will also want to briefly introduce other people who might be involved in your action plan. If you are writing a\nproposal for a collaborative project, address your colleagues' qualifications and abilities briefly as well. Some\nundergraduate research grants require the participation of a full-time faculty mentor. You will outline their position,\ncollege, department, and research interests here.\nResources\nDoes the writer have the necessary resources, background context,\nand/or knowledge to begin? Is the cost (if any) of the proposed action\nreasonable considering potential benefits?\nA solid plan and qualified personnel are not the only two ingredients for a successful project. Projects might also\ndemand materials, instruments, travel, equipment, and compensation.\nOften, it comes down to money. When discussing resources in a proposal, prepare a proposed resource and cost\nbudget down to the dollars. Budget fairly to show a close estimate of costs you will face and/or resources you will\nneed. Demonstrate good planning by identifying accurately what\u2019s needed, where the resources are available, and what\nit will cost. Your audience will be looking to see if the costs seem reasonable considering the anticipated results of the\nproject. Often, this section might include a spreadsheet or list showing how resources will be allocated and applied.\nLiterature Review/Bibliography\nBecause you likely won\u2019t need more than articles, journals, and books to begin a major research paper, the literature that\nyou annotate, summarize, and incorporate is the primary resource to consider in your proposal for that paper. Thus, you\nmight be asked to include additional literature review (a survey of relevant sources\u2014the \u201cliterature\u201d) or a bibliography of\nsources, which may or may not be annotated with the sources\u2019 argument and your anticipated use. Your review of the\n288 literature will also support the Problem/Question section, as detailed above. Literature reviews are discussed at length\nin a prior chapter.\nOutlining your supporting documents in the proposal, wherever your literature review content is included, will\ndemonstrate you have access to the solid, relevant sources, the resources you need to begin. Any sources that you cite\nin your earlier sections should be included in this review of the literature or annotated bibliography. As with any time you\ncite sources in a formal document, use a consistent and appropriate citation style which fits the audience\u2019s\nexpectations (APA, MLA, Chicago, Turabian, etc.).\nConclusion\nWhile some proposals won\u2019t ask you for a conclusion, when they do, use your conclusion to summarize your main\npoints and create a final appeal to your audience. Reiterate the established need and your proposed solution. Ask\nclearly for the desired course of action: dollars to finance a project, skills and resources to boost a venture, or simply\npermission to proceed. Emotionally emphasize the vision. Make it personal for your audience at your close.\nUnderstanding Proposal Structure\nTrue or False: Proposals rigidly follow the sections listed above. You should always plan to include each and\nevery section, in the order listed above.\nTrue\u2014exactness matters with proposals and you should always seek to follow the above sections\nexactly.\nFalse\u2014each unique proposal circumstance will demand different sections and topics to address in\nvarying orders, which may or may not include some of the sections above.\nFinal Considerations\nAs you finish your proposal, here are some final things to consider.\nBe consistent and clear as you design your headings and structure. Make sure your design fits with the expected\nlook for the specific situation and audience. Look at examples to see what looks best to you.\nRevise and edit carefully to establish your credibility. Your audience wants to trust your abilities and they will see\nthem reflected first in your attention to detail in the proposal. Submit a proposal with clean grammar and close\nadherence to the specifications provided.\nBefore you submit a proposal, seek feedback. If you can, ask for reviews from people who have evaluated similar\nproposals or prospectuses as decision-makers. Or, at the least, ask for feedback from peers who may have been\nsuccessful before. Ask them to read it quickly, even skim it. Does it make sense? More than likely, your audience\nwill be reading a pile of proposals rapidly. You want the clarity and vibrancy of yours to stand out right away.\nWithout alternate instructions, the default is to submit by official email as a PDF\u2014always as a PDF to avoid\nformatting hiccups.\nDon\u2019t miss deadlines for submission. They often come just once a year.\n289 For me, a written paper proposal given with a glittery ring in a small wooden box marked the end (the start!) of a pretty\nmagical love story. Yes, yes, and again yes, I said to by now-husband in response to the most important proposal I\u2019ve\ngotten to date. My husband and I teamed up to tackle life\u2019s roller coaster, and thus far, it\u2019s been thrilling. Yes, I\u2019m\nstretching a bit putting my engagement story into the mix. But I\u2019m convinced that like a one-knee, shaky-hands, big-kiss\nproposal, written proposals have the power to link the right people and resources to a project, even a marriage in this\ncase.\nLikewise, if we think about the proposals we write as vibrant documents written about actual problems or questions to\nreal people who can make decisions (not to face-less bureaucratic organizations), we\u2019ll be more likely to make profitable\nconnections with an audience who has the extra boost of power to make things happen. With the right resources sent\nto the best projects, we see questions answered, problems solved, needs met, and goals achieved. I have to admit, it\nfeels a little bit like magic.\nLaura Dutson\nLaura Dutson teaches writing courses and creative writing workshops at Brigham Young University in Provo,\nUtah.

Haupt, & Jill Larsen\nLearning Outcomes\nUnderstand the difference between writing for a general audience versus an academic audience\nRecognize the benefits of analyzing your audience\nDefine and evaluate your purpose, context, and message\nLearn strategies for designing and presenting a message so that it is successfully understood by a general\naudience\nWhat the Heck Are General Audiences?\nThis might come as a surprise to you, but when you graduate, you won't always be working with people in your field.\nDon't get me wrong\u2014you'll still be expected to communicate in the specialized language of your discipline to people\ninside your discipline, but people outside your field will also need to understand your work\u2014people like your manager,\nyour customers or clients, and maybe even your significant other. You'll need to learn how to translate complicated\ntopics for these General Audiences, also known as Public Audiences, in order to get your message across.\nIn fact, just because most of you are young, people will automatically assume that you're tech savvy and an expert at\nposting on social media. And this will most likely lead to you being tasked with writing posts and blogs for your\ncompany, program, or department\u2014even if you've never done it before. But don't panic. Instead, get good at it!\n293 And despite what people assume about youngsters, even if you're skilled at following celebrities on Twitter or posting\ncat memes on Instagram, that doesn't mean that you know how to represent your company online or report on research\npublished by your favorite professor. So we want to arm you with strategies to tackle the tricky task of writing for people\nnot in your field because there are actually tried-and-true strategies you can use to make the biggest impact. And\nunderstanding these strategies could make or break your job search, your career, or possibly even your love life.\nI'm serious about the love life thing. If you need more convincing, watch what happened when Jimmy Fallon failed to\nunderstand the rhetorical situation when he met Nicole Kidman a few years ago. (Watch at least through minute 3:00.)\nWatch on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/qtsNbxgPngA\nRemember the good ol' rhetorical triangle? Well, Jimmy made some classic mistakes when he analyzed the rhetorical\nsituation before meeting Nicole Kidman. He clearly didn't understand his audience (a sophisticated, talented woman\nwho was interested in him), he clearly misinterpreted the purpose and context (movie meeting vs date), and he clearly\nblew the message (wearing sweats and playing video games). No amount of brie cheese could salvage that meeting,\nand even years later he had to ask, \"Did I date Nicole Kidman?\"\n294 What your staunchest, most serious professor might look like at a dinner party. Photo by ThePlaz on Wikimedia\nCommons\nDon't be like Jimmy\u2014recognize when you're on a date! You've learned tools for analyzing your situation; use them! It\npays to learn the best tools for translating your message to a general audience. It turns out even your staunchest, most\nboring, serious professor\u2014you know the one who has a monotonous voice and always puts you to sleep\u2014has to be able\nto explain their job to their next-door neighbor or at a dinner party or to their significant other (unless their significant\nother is also an expert in the same field, which means they probably have really boring, serious children. But I digress.).\nIf, on the other hand, the love of your life is in a different field from you like, say, the field of mechanical engineering and\nneuroscience while you teach English literature and writing classes (just to pick a random example), then you need to\nlearn how to translate the work you do to a more general audience in order to keep your relationship strong and show\nthat you care. And that takes a new set of strategies that help bridge the gap between you and your general audience\nsuch as adding stories, using an engaging voice, and even including humor. See, I told you this chapter would be good\nfor your love life!\nIn addition, if you want your work in your field to make a big difference and get attention, you need to know how to\nhighlight it so that people will listen. That's why these days so many people post articles on LinkedIn and Medium.com\nand even Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter\u2014to highlight what they do for the greater public to understand, which in turn\nincreases their reputation and personal brand. You, too, can get the attention you deserve! But you have to learn how to\nappeal to a general audience. And that's where we're going to start: audience.\nAudience in the Real World\nThe most important thing we can teach you about writing for general audiences is to analyze your audience. Companies\nspend millions of dollars a year analyzing their audiences to convince people to buy their products. They've learned that\nunderstanding their audience's preferences, motivations, and values is a key to good sales. This is often called Market\n295 Research. For example, here's a one-minute ad from IBM for an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Marketing platform\nwhose sole purpose is to try to help companies understand their audience better:\nWatch this video to see how you become a company's target audience.\nIt makes you re-think how you spend your time (and clicks) online, doesn't it? Or at least how many times you post on\nsocial media about eating waffles. The bottom line from IBM and this section on audience is that audience matters\u2014if\nyou can really understand who you're presenting to, you can make your message appealing to them and in turn effect\nthe change you'd like them to make.\nSo when you think about your audience, spend some time trying to imagine them. Consider demographics. Age. Gender.\nSocioeconomic status. What other companies would your target audience follow? Consider where your audience gets\ntheir social media content. Do they spend their time on Facebook? Or do they prefer Instagram or Twitter? Do they use\nthe Google App or the News App on their iPhone? Consider \"problems.\" What problem are you providing a solution for?\nYou should empathize with their dilemmas and provide an answer to their issues. Let's practice.\nAudience Analysis\nNike Audience Analysis\nFor this assignment, let's look at Nike. Go to nike.com and see if you can answer the following Audience\nAnalysis Questions. Note that you might not be able to answer all of them. Thinking through all of this\ninformation, write a short paragraph 3-4 sentence analysis of Nike's audience.\n1. What is the approximate size of Nike's audience? Are they addressing a small population or a sizable\ngroup?\n2. Who, specifically, are they targeting? (Think demographics)\n3. What is the demographic makeup of Nike's audience (age, gender, education level, ethnicity), and how\nmight they use that information to develop and shape their content?\n4. What personal and professional traits does Nike have in common with the members of their audience?\n5.

You can and should analyze your audience in\nsimilar ways before you communicate to them\u2014which leads me to this textbook.\n296 Under the Hood\nPhoto by Hosea Georgeson on Unsplash\nI'll let you in on a secret. When we decided to write this textbook, we had a dilemma: should we model academic writing\nby using a formal, serious, and scholarly tone? Or should we as authors use a less formal, conversational voice that\nwould appeal more to a general audience?\nTo answer this, the first thing we authors did was analyze you\u2014our audience. We talked about what type of textbook\nwould appeal to you, what kind of content we should include, what kind of strategies we should use in our approach,\nand what kind of language to choose. We looked at previous textbooks, talked to our students, consulted other\ninstructors, and even read a book explaining recent research scholars have done specifically about your generation.\nHow does it make you feel to know your textbook authors are thinking about you so much? We hope that rather than\nfeeling creeped out, you feel flattered and happy that we care. Because we do. But either way, our audience analysis of\nyou was very enlightening.\nWe came to the conclusion that even though lots of other textbook writers choose to model a stiff, academic tone, you\nprobably wouldn't like that. Instead, we thought you'd appreciate if we wrote to you in our own voices as if we were\nhaving a conversation, as if you were sitting right there. So we threw caution (and typical textbook conventions) to the\nwind and chose to treat you more like a general audience rather than an academic one in this book.\nAnd even though some of our colleagues worried that you'd mistake our conversational tone as the way you should\nwrite your academic papers, we've found that you're smarter than that\u2014that you can do your own audience analysis and\nrecognize that we're writing like this because our purpose (to teach college students about writing) is different than\nyours in an academic paper (to make a logical argument for your professor to show how well you've researched a\ntopic).\n297 When writing this textbook, we tried to imagine what college students like you would want. Photo by Naassom Azevedo\non Unsplash\nIn that vein, we determined that in this textbook, you'd want us to keep the paragraphs short, include personal stories,\nadd images and videos, incorporate lots of white space and headings, and perhaps most importantly of all, make the\ntextbook open source and free of cost. We did all this for you! Because we care. So far, we've had very positive\nfeedback about our choice of conversational voice and interactive elements (not to mention the fact that it's free). But if\nyou think of ways we can improve, please feel free to tell us in the end-of-chapter surveys. The beauty of an online\ntextbook is that we're continually revising it, so bring on the feedback!\nLike our audience analysis of you, your analysis of your own audience will help you develop effective strategies to get\nyour message across. And asking for feedback will help you figure out if you're hitting the mark. Now that you know\nyour audience, let's talk about what else to consider when writing for general audiences.\nPurpose, Context, and Message\nAs Jimmy Fallon taught us, when we communicate, it helps to think through the rhetorical situation first. When you're\nwriting to general audiences, once you have a sense of your audience and their values, you also need to think about the\ncontext you're writing in and delineate your purpose\u2014why are you communicating? Generally, most public\ncommunication falls into three categories:\n298 1. Informative\u2014like reporting on the latest research coming out of computational linguistics\n2. Persuasive\u2014like convincing your city to install a stoplight at a dangerous intersection\n3. A mix of the two\u2014like explaining how germs are spread during flu season in order to persuade your audience to get\na flu shot.\nAsk yourself, What exactly do I want my audience to think after reading/hearing my message?\nInformational Writing\nIf your goal is to inform, your focus will be on clarity. Keep the language simple and think through how much\nbackground information you need to give your audience. You can quote from experts\u2014general audiences love appeals\nto character\u2014as long as you keep the jargon to a minimum and explain where your information is coming from.\nYou'll probably want to draw your reader/listener in with some kind of hook or interesting fact that introduces the topic\nand catches their attention. Then as you proceed, make sure there's a logical progression through your points. One way\nto test this is to have people read it and give you feedback\u2014find people who fit the demographics of your audience if\npossible.\nChoose clear diagrams, tables, figures, and/or images to illustrate your point. Image in Public Domain\nYou also want to use strong visuals\u2014especially if you want to portray data. Informational writing relies on facts, data,\nand statistics, but these need to be portrayed in easy, understandable ways, and visuals really help with that. Choose\nclear diagrams, tables, figures, and/or images to illustrate your point. Document design can also help\u2014things such as\nbullets, headings and subheadings, bolded key terms or definitions, call-out boxes, color, and even white space.\nEven in informational writing, you can appeal to the emotions of your audience. For instance, consider including some\ntype of story, example, or case study that connects with your audience because it will help them see the relevance of\n299 your point. You can even consider whether adding some humor would be appropriate. When you conclude, try to tie in\nyour conclusion to your introduction and leave your audience with something memorable. Ask yourself, \"What do I want\nmy audience to remember?\" End with that.\nPersuasive Writing\nAs opposed to informational writing, if your goal is to persuade or get your audience to do or think something, then\nyou're making an argument. There's a whole field of study called Rhetoric that goes back to ancient times where people\nexamine the best ways to persuade or influence others. When writing an argument, your objective is to propose a\nsolution to a current problem, to have your audience see your opinion, point, or research claim as valid, true, and\nvaluable. In other words, your purpose is to persuade, convince, motivate, or move readers toward a certain point of\nview or action. In fact, a lot of persuasive writing ends with a \"Call to Action\" where you overtly ask your audience to\u2014\nyou guessed it\u2014take some kind of action.\nIn academic circles, persuasion is best done through published articles or presentations that focus on methods, data,\nresults; but when it comes to general audiences, the focus changes first, to catching people's attention and then\nto convincing them with a mix of appeals to logic, character, and emotion.\nA Word on Narrative\nOne particularly poignant tool to use in general audience writing is narrative\u2014especially personal stories. As mentioned\nin Chapter 5: Style, we as humans are hard-wired to remember stories. Narratives that are personal, detailed, and\ninteresting can be a point of convincing evidence that has the power to mold and change your readers' thinking much\nmore than statistics or data alone can.\nWatch this 3-minute video about the power of storytelling from one of the greatest group of storytellers in modern\ntimes: Pixar.\nWatch on YouTube\nThe Power of Storytelling https://youtu.be/1rMnzNZkIX0\n300 Harness the power of storytelling by adding global storytelling (having an arc to your writing with a beginning, middle,\nand end, etc.) and local storytelling elements (like including an incident that happened to you). Review Chapter 5: Style\nfor more ideas.\nContext and Genre\nOne last consideration to keep in mind is the context in which you're communicating and whether there's an established\ngenre or form your writing needs to fit into. To review the concepts of genre and context, see Chapter 2: Writing Tools.\nWhether it be an online blog post, a resume, a poster presentation or a tweet, you need to understand the conventions\npeople usually use when communicating. In fact, sometimes knowing the genre is all the information you need to\nunderstand the message.\nFor example, in the town where I live, there's an odd tradition that when high schoolers ask someone to a school dance,\nthey usually do so in a creative way. Like, really creative. Like, Instagram-worthy. So one day, my family found this\nmessage on our doorstep.\nMy son understood this date invitation because he knew the genre and context. Photo by the author, used with Abby's\npermission.\nEven though the words of Abby's message themselves weren't intelligible, we immediately understood the message\nbecause we understood the genre (unusual items left on doorsteps are usually dance invitations) and the context\n(we've seen the movie The Guardians of the Galaxy, so we caught the reference to the plant creature who speaks using\nonly one phrase: \"I am Groot.\"). In fact, by referencing a popular movie and challenging the typical genre of dance\ninvitations, Abby made a better\u2014and funnier\u2014invitation than if she'd simply said her message straight out. This is why\nunderstanding genre and context can really help you get your own message across\u2014even in your love life.\nThe rest of this Unit of the textbook (General Audiences) will be devoted to specific genres of general audience writing,\nso for help with particular types of communication like resumes, blog posts, or presentations, go to those chapters. In\nthe meantime, let's finish our discussion with the best strategies for connecting with general audiences.\n301 Strategies for General Writing\nWhere academic audiences are made up of people who generally study the same things as you, general audiences are\njust that\u2014general. You can assume that your readers/listeners have generic knowledge about many different subjects,\nbut they don't know any particulars about your field, so you'll have to fill in those gaps. But be careful not to use\njargon from your field because they'll get lost in the language and ignore your message. The best way to figure out what\nstrategies work best for general audiences is to see this kind of translation writing in action.\nAcademic vs General Audiences: Reporting on Research\nWe're going to use our analytical skills again to figure out what characteristics are best used in general writing. Here's\nan example of how writers have translated academic research into the public sphere. First, read the abstract of this\nacademic article called \"There's No Place Like Home: The Associations Between Residential Attributes and Family\nFunctioning\" (click on the link or scroll down below). Then skim through the article. You don't have to read everything\u2014\njust understand what it's about and notice how the authors use academic language to portray their message.\nNext, read this newspaper article that introduces this research to a general audience (click on the link or scroll down\nbelow). Note the tools the author uses to appeal to this broader, less academic audience.\nMake the Connection\nList 2-3 strategies that the author of the newspaper article used to translate the academic research article to a\nmore general/public audience? Which strategies do you think are the most helpful and that you can use when\nyou write for a general audience?\nI hope you noticed things like the use of good visuals to draw the reader in, the conversational tone, the easy\nexplanations of the research, the lack of jargon, and the use of direct quotes from the article's author himself. This made\nit feel like the wrtier was telling the story of how the research came to be rather than just reporting on data. These are\nall strategies that can come in handy when you're translating something academic into something for the public.\nHere's a table that sums up the contrasting strategies generally used in Academic versus General Writing.\nAcademic Audience Writing General Audience Writing\nLong paragraphs Short paragraphs\nSerious academic tone Engaging, friendly tone\nSynthesized claims/heavy referencing Logical progression/light referencing\nClarity to avoid misunderstanding Clever wording to encourage insight\nFocus on knowledge and scientific\nFocus on practical application\nadvancement\nObjective writing with solid backing Passionate writing with conviction\n302 Focus on data, methods, and results Focus on narrative and relevance to audience\nMost appeals are to logic and Most appeals are to emotions and\nauthority/character authority/character\nAPA in-text citations and reference lists Hyperlinks or endnotes for references\nAs you can see, when you change audiences, you need to change your strategies. Some of these differences might not\nbe as pronounced in some genre outlets; for example, some blogs operate more like academic outlets, are serious in\ntone, and require heavy, scholarly referencing. However, this table generally represents good rules to follow.\nTop Seven Hints for Writing for General Audiences\nHere are some last tips that will help your writing shine.\n303 Anchor each new point, taking the reader on a journey. Use the first part of the sentence and subject skillfully to\nkeep your audience engaged (sometimes flip the order of the sentence to achieve this level of engagement); be\naware of the same principle as you transition from paragraph to paragraph. Use one-sentence zingers and varied\nsentence and paragraph length to maintain high interest from point to point.\nAx anything unessential. Look at writing through the metaphor of finding a pot of gold in the woods. It can be\nfound within 400 feet, but in the searching for it, you walk a mile. Which does your audience want\u2014the 400 feet or\nthe mile? When you have to cut things out, you are often cutting out the mile. These parts are hard to cut because\nthey were personal to you and to the journey of finding the pot of gold, but the audience is not part of that journey.\nThey generally want your message in the 400 feet.\nAttribute sources with very short, but impressive elements. When citing a source and choosing what to include\n(e.g., author\u2019s name, credentials, affiliation with an institution, professional background, name of recent article or\nbook, etc.), try to include no more than two attributions and use those that are most impressive for the audience of\nyour piece. Add quotes in places that are consistent with the original text to not misuse another author\u2019s intent.\nAngle your insights to help readers gain a new perspective. Know the point you are driving towards, even if the\nreader does not see it from the beginning. Consider starting with some of the most interesting parts of the idea or a\nstory or place them closer to the first of the article (once interested, the reader can better deal later with the less\ninteresting parts of the topic if they are already \u201chooked\u201d on the article). Refine the ending to make sure readers\nfinish with an unstated invitation to continue to think about your point. Don\u2019t \u201coverstay your welcome\u201d by doing too\nmuch of a summary.\nAllow authentic use of narrative to be real and to touch readers. Paint a picture by using great adjectives; don\u2019t be\nafraid to add emotional words to human experience to bring it to life. At times, this means that you slow down the\npacing in order to give rich detail. If you begin or end with examples or stories, make sure that the tone stays\nconsistent throughout, so the story is woven into the piece, rather than used as a stand-alone piece. Carefully\nconsider the use of \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d since this speaks directly to the reader. When you choose to speak \u201csecond\nperson\u201d be sure you are speaking generally enough to include all of your audience, that you don\u2019t inadvertently\noffend them by putting on a label or suggesting a belief or behavior they have that might not be very complimentary\n(to avoid making sweeping or inaccurate judgements). With a call to action, also be aware of how this might be\ntaken by your audience.\nAnalyze or interpret data or statistics to guide readers. When describing research, simplify (it may help to think of\na friend or neighbor); state findings in present tense and explain the conducting of a study in the past tense. Be\ncareful about \u201cdumbing down the research\u201d so much that it confuses terms or overgeneralizes findings (e.g.,\nconsider whether the original researchers would be happy with your clarity and accuracy in describing their work).\nFor your most important points that hinge on research or when introducing charts or graphs, take time to guide\nreaders through complicated findings with helpful analysis, rather than assuming they will get the point if you only\njust mention the presence of findings in this area.\nApply good APA protocols & hyperlinks to build transparency and trust. Use a good variety of resources that\nwould be considered credible by your audience. Where you can, hyperlink to the original, using a key word or two to\nhyperlink the resource. In those cases and in other cases where the source is not internet based (e.g., a book),\nprovide an endnote. (See this video, for example, with a brief information about how to insert endnotes in Word.)\nKey points need good references to build credibility, but in public scholarship pieces, synthesis is not generally\nneeded, nor is it necessary to be obtrusive about a heavy focus on naming or explaining sources in general\u2014just be\ntransparent and wise in the selection of sources (e.g., if all your sources are blogs that no one has heard of, the\npiece may not feel very authoritative).\nRepresenting a Company or Group\nIn some cases you will be writing under your own name; other times you'll be writing for a company or group. You\nalways want to consider what your writing tells the reader about yourself and if you're building and protecting your\nreputation. But once you're writing on behalf of a company or group you have the added responsibility of representing\nthem as well. If you can consciously keep your purpose, audience, genre, and context in mind every time you send out\nan email or text or post or reply on Slack, you will become much more adept at using the rhetorical situation for your\n304 and their benefit. Try to use the mindful writing techniques from Chapter 3 and imagine you're reading your piece from\nyour audience's perspective. Or even better, test your piece on actual readers and get feedback. Either way, you'll want to\nmake sure you follow any Style Guides or standards that your company has.\nRead an Example\nFinally, one of the best ways to learn how to write for a general audience is to read pieces written for general audiences.\nShocking, I know. As a last exercise, choose of these examples of articles by undergraduate students in BYU's School\nof Family Life written and published for a general audience. Notice the strategies they use to make their article more\nappealing for a general audience, even when they're reporting on academic research that's been done on their topic.\nOption #1: Love: The Greatest Motivation to Change\nOption #2: Longevity Secrets of Utah Centarians\nGeneral Audience Examples\nWhich article did you read?

Or go to grad school? Or maybe get into a professional school? This chapter will give you the\ntools you need to create a killer application. Remember that the rhetorical situation surrounds everything\u2014it even\nsurrounds the pursuit of your dreams. So before you even start writing your application materials, you must assess the\nsituation. In this chapter, you'll look at the genre of various application materials and consider how your character will\nbe presented to your audience. You will make sure your purpose is clear and the message is compelling. But, primarily,\nyou\u2019ll be focusing on audience. After all, how can you expect to land a job if you don\u2019t understand the group or\ncompany? How can you show an admissions committee why you're a good fit for their department and they're a good fit\nfor you if you don't even know what research they conduct? How can you convince your boss to give you perks if you\ndon't know what your boss values?\n15.1 Professional Audience Analysis\nBefore you begin writing any application document you need to know to whom you are writing. Hopefully at this point\nyou have narrowed your list of potential employers or schools. If you haven\u2019t yet\u2014jot down a pro and con list. Compare\nand contrast each company/school's requirements and preferences. Dig in to their websites. See if their values align\nwith yours and if you like the work they're doing. Once you have decided on a winner, you should perform an in-depth\nanalysis of the company/department. The following discussion questions are rather . . . thorough . . . so get\ncomfortable and get answering.\n310 Audience Analysis\n1. Look at the company, program or employer's website to see how the organization describes itself.\n2. Create a list of key terms from the ad and the website.\n3. Briefly answer the Audience Analysis Questions. Note that you might not be able to answer all of them\nbased on the audience.\n4. Using all of this information, write a brief analysis of your audience.\nAUDIENCE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS\n1. What is the approximate size of your audience? Are you addressing just one or two people or a sizable group?\n2. Who, specifically, are you writing to? A Hiring Manager or department? A specific person?\n3. What information do you have regarding the demographic makeup of your audience (age, gender, education level,\nethnicity), and how might you use that information to develop and shape your writing?\n4. What personal and professional traits do you have in common with the members of your audience?\n5. What common values do you share with your audience?\n\u0000. Are there any cultural considerations that may influence how your audience responds to your writing?\n7. Will your audience expect to be entertained as well as informed?\n\u0000. Will you be targeting certain members of your audience, and if so, which members? (Think name-dropping, more on\nthat later)\n9. How will you have to earn your audience\u2019s trust? How will you demonstrate your knowledge or expertise?\n10. What preconceptions or biases might be held by some members of your audience?\n11. What expectations will your audience have regarding your application materials?\n12. What expectations will your audience have regarding the format of your application materials?\n13. What key questions will your audience expect you to answer?\n14. What key objections are audience members likely to raise?\n15. What particular appeals should you include in your application materials to connect to the needs and interests of\nyour audience?\nAfter you have completed the activity you should have a pretty good picture of your audience. You will also want to\nspend a bit of time closely reading the position posting and/or description. See if you find similar keywords, or words\nthat have a similar connotation, in your Audience Analysis and in the position posting. Make note of any you find, as\nthey will come in handy when you are crafting your application. Now, let\u2019s start with the resume.\n311 15.2 Rules of the Resume\nResumes are essential whether on paper or online. Image via Amtec Photos\nEven with LinkedIn, Facebook, and online application systems, the resume is still king. It is your chance to quickly show\nall of the really great accomplishments you've made and how well equipped you are for the job at hand. The trick is that\nyou only have one page. Oh . . . and about 10 seconds to seal the deal.\nConventions of the Genre\nOne Page\nThe first rule of the resume is that it must be only one page long. No more, no less. (There are some exceptions in\ncertain fields that allow two pages, but these are very rare.) If you go over, you\u2019ve broken the rules of the genre. If you go\nunder, you tell your audience that you don\u2019t have much experience. This one page is golden space\u2014use it wisely.\nGolden Triangle\nSpeaking of \"golden space,\" the \"Golden Triangle\" is the space which occupies the top left-hand corner of the resume\nand branches out to form a triangle from there. This space is where your reader is most likely to look first. That means\nwe should put all of the most valuable information within that space. If you choose to break this rule (like putting your\nname on the right side of the paper), do so carefully and with thought. Your audience should be able to get the\ninformation they need quickly. Remember, a prospective employer only gives about 7-10 seconds per resume before\ndeciding if it lives to the next stage in the application process.\n312 Your Golden Triangle\nWhat information will you place in the golden triangle?\nWhite Space\nIf you have a bit of extra white space on your resume (usually due to a lack of relevant work experience) you should\nfocus on your school experience. List the accomplishments you have achieved during your time at university: Teacher\nAssistantships, Projects, Lab Work, Courses Completed, Scholarships, Club Memberships, etc.\nNarrative\nYour job is to create a story for your audience. Make sure you are answering who you are and why you are a great fit for\nthis position within both the resume and cover letter or statement of intent. Every paragraph in your cover letter and\nevery bullet point in your resume should be there for a reason. Take a look at your past and current experience and\nmatch it up to what the company is looking for.\nWhat to Include and In What Order\nRemember that your goal is to tell a story about why you are a great candidate for this particular job or internship. And .\n. . we only have one page in bullet-point format to share that story. That means that we should only include the most\nrelevant and current information for that specific job. Generally speaking, that excludes your high school days. Based\noff of your Audience Analysis, give the information that matters most to your audience. Are they more concerned about\nyour educational experience? Or your work experience? Put the one they care about most at the top. Make sure your\nbullets are in reverse chronological order. Your audience is interested in the really cool stuff that you are doing now, not\nwhat you did when you were 14.\nReligious Volunteer Experiences\nReligious Experiences\nMany students ask if they should include their religious volunteer or mission experience and the very clear answer is \"it\ndepends.\" Like everything else in your resume, your experience must be there to tell a story and link directly to the\ncurrent job for which you are applying. BYU Career Services has an excellent handout which helps job and grad school\ncandidates work church service into \u201ctransferable skills.\u201d\nInterests\nSome companies pay close attention to the interest section. You are not required to include this section, or a section\nlike it, but it is a great way to fill in some of the golden space if you may not have extensive work experience. Spend a bit\nof time researching those you\u2019ll work with. If you find out they like the outdoors and you are a kayaking enthusiast\u2014write\n313 that down. It will show that you are a good fit not only in the office, but socially as well. However, make sure that you are\ngenuine in your responses. Don\u2019t write that Shakespeare is your favorite author (because you think it makes you sound\nsmart) when all you remember is watching Leonardo DiCaprio play Romeo during movie day in your sophomore English\nclass. You may find yourself in a very uncomfortable position when your interviewer asks which of the Bard's sonnets is\nyour favorite.\nBullet points help readers speed through your resume. Photo by Dean Page on Pixabay\n15.3 Bulleted Sections\nOnce you have nailed down which experiences you want to highlight, based on your Audience Analysis, you need to\nlook at how you will organize that information into bulleted sections. Within every section, each bullet point is a phrase\n\u2014not a complete sentence. And each phrase begins with a verb. If you find that you are using the same verb in many of\nyour bullets, you may want to google \u201cAction Verbs\u201d or head to BYU\u2019s Career Services website to see their Action Verbs\nhandout.\nLook at each of your bullet points. Do they begin with a verb-first phrase? After you have revised your verb-first phrases\nyou need to look closely at the information you are providing your readers. You should move from task-oriented phrases\nto phrases which provide quantifiable data, indicate the motivation behind the task, and show the impact on others.\nMove from\nTested operating systems\nto\nTested 5 operating systems daily\nand ending up with something like this\nTested 5 operating systems daily to minimize errors for customers\n314 Bullet Points\nNow you do it. Revise each of your bullet points to include quantifiable data, motivation, and impact.\nBest=Longer?\nRight now you might be thinking \u201chow can I create the \u2018best\u2019 bullet points and stay within the one-page limit?\u201d The best\nway to do so is to head back to your Audience Analysis. Make sure that each section has a purpose and links to your\nnarrative. Adapt the sections to highlight the information your audience wants to know. Get comfortable with the delete\nbutton and get rid of irrelevant bullet points (we really don\u2019t need to know the stuff you did in high school). Only include\nand highlight the most current and impressive and relevant bullet points.\n15.4 The Master\nIt is good practice to keep a \u201cmaster\u201d resume as you progress through your career. A master resume contains all of the\nawesome things you have done. Each time you complete a new task or project in your current job, you will head over to\nthis master resume and either add more bullet points under your current job or create a new bulleted section. Your\nmaster resume will be multiple pages long. If you are faithful to this process, you will have an up-to-date working\ndocument that is always ready to use for a job application process.\nHow to Use It\nAfter you have completed the Audience Analysis for your prospective job, you will head to your master resume. Copy\nand paste (or adapt) only the information that is pertinent for this new job into your new resume. Basically, you are\nplagiarizing yourself. Which is the only cool way to plagiarize.\n315 15.5 Cover Letters\nCover letters allow you to highlight your best points. Photo by Resume Writing Lab\nThe cover letter is a weird thing. The very name implies that it comes first in the application process. However, it\nsometimes only comes into play after your resume has made the cut. And many jobs don\u2019t ask for a cover letter\nanymore or ask for an email instead. That being said, your cover letter is the place where you can emphasize or\nhighlight certain aspects of your resume or explain some of the holes your resume might have. It should introduce,\njustify, and explain your resume. And, if you are one of the lucky ones who do not have to submit a cover letter, still write\none. Use it as a place to practice your PAR story for your interview--PAR stands for problem, action, result. Try to frame\nyour experience in cover letters and interviews by showing a problem you encountered, an action you took, and the\nresults of that action.\nConventions of the Genre\nThe cover letter looks and smells like a traditional formal letter. It must have a heading, opening salutation, body\nparagraphs, and a closing salutation. It should be one page long with lots of white space.\n316 Heading: Your heading should match the heading found on your resume. Make sure to include your address,\ntelephone number, and email address. You can include your LinkedIn information. We also need the date and the\naddress of person to whom you are writing.\nOpening Salutation: Please avoid using \u201cTo Whom It May Concern.\u201d It is outdated and shows that you didn\u2019t care\nenough to seek out the person your letter is going to. Use Google and see if you can figure out your point of\ncontact. If that fails, give the company a call. \u201cHi! My name is Bob Lob and I\u2019m applying for the student intern\nposition in the pediatric research department. I\u2019d like to personalize my cover letter. Could you tell me who\u2019s\nresponsible for potential interns?\u201d Not only does it provide you with the information you need, but it could also get\nyour name circulating. If all of the above fails, you can broaden your field a bit and address the role or the\ndepartment (e.g., \u201cDear Hiring Manager,\u201d or \u201cDear Applications Department\u201d)\n1st paragraph: How did you find out about the job? What connects you to the company? \u201cName drop\u201d in this\nparagraph. Do you have any mentors that work there? Did a current employee suggest the job to you? What position\nare you applying for?\n1st Paragraph Activity\nAnswer the above questions in paragraph form.\n2nd and 3rd paragraphs: Why are you interested in their company? How will you add value to the company? What is\nunique about you? Highlight the awesome items that are in your resume. Mention education and experience. You\ncan mention why the company is good for you, but focus mostly on how you are good for the company. Show them\nhow much you want to work for them. If you need to explain why you may have sub-par grades or experience, this is\nthe place to do so. Make sure that you own your flaws, but use them to show your character. If something made\nyour grades fall a bit short, show what you learned from the experience.\n2nd and 3rd Paragraph\nAnswer the above questions in paragraph form. Make sure you are keeping your audience in mind. Also, it\nwouldn't hurt to use the PAR method (problem, action, result).\n15.6 The Interview\nThanks to all your hard work on your resume and cover letter your foot is in the metaphorical door, but your rhetorical\nwork is far from done. Now we need to prepare for the interview.\n317 Prepare\nInterviewers like to ask behavioral questions to figure out how you react to challenges. Be prepared to convince them of\nyour skills by using the keywords you found during your Audience Analysis to prepare personal stories that show\nproblems you faced, actions you took, and changes you effected. Not only will this exercise help with your interview, but\nit will help with crafting your cover letter or statement of intent. Each of the stories we share should be brief, engaging,\nand job related. Make a table of PAR stories (problem, action, result) like the one below, with column heading for key\nwords, problem, action, and result.\nType caption for image (optional)\nJust like you\u2019ll be adding experiences to your Master Resume, make sure to add to your PAR table throughout your\ncareer when you conquer a tough challenge. You\u2019ll be instantly ready to prep for your next interview, cover letter, or\nstatement of intent. Look over this sample PAR table. Read some of the example stories to get ideas.\nPractice\nAfter you've done your research, grab a smart person and practice, practice, practice. Hand them a copy of your resume\nand something to eat. Get them to ask you behavioral questions so that you can practice answering smoothly and\nconfidently with PAR stories.\nYou may feel uncomfortable asking someone to practice an interview with you, but practicing your PAR stories at least\nthree times will give you a level of confidence that sets you apart from your competition. Ask for candid feedback. Be\nopen and appreciative. Video record yourself to see if your mannerisms, posture, and voice all support the image you\nare trying to portray.\nInterview Formats\nInterviews are conducted in various formats (in-person, video call, recorded video, phone), depending on an\norganization's resources, the job level, an location.\nIn-person Interview\nFace-to-face interviews are still the gold standard. Lots of information (most of it non-verbal) flows back and forth in\nthis sort of interview. When you're offered a seat, take out a pen and paper to take notes. Taking notes helps you look\nalert and capable. it also helps you remember points you'd like to bring up.\n318 Your interviewer will probably start with an \"ice-breaker\" question. Be prepared for the classic \"Tell me about yourself.\"\nGive a brief personal pitch that you've practiced so many times you don't even need to think about it. Connect your\nbackground and strengths to your target job.\nOnce you get talking, remember to breathe. Your interviewer wants you to succeed. Help them discover that you're the\nperfect candidate; that will make their job much easier.\nVideo Call or Remote Interviews\nVideo call interviews are becoming much more common. They're an inexpensive way for companies to quickly assess\nthe capabilities, suitability, and fit of candidates. In addition to the tips above, follow these steps to improve your video\ninterview performance.\nSet up\nBecome familiar with the technology so you won't be flustered if it fails. Try out at least two services so you can\nswitch if necessary.\nCompose a backdrop. Make sure your interviewer sees you in a clean, simple environment.\nOrient the light toward your face or to your side, (not above or behind you.) Strong overhead light can make you look\nspooky. Natural light is the most flattering, so try to sit facing a window.\nMake sure the camera is at eye level or slightly above. Place your laptop on a stack of books so that your\ninterviewer isn't looking up your nose.\nDouble check the interview time and time zone.\nOn the day\nChoose a solid-colored shirt and make sure it's pressed. Wrinkles show up more on camera. If you need to wear a\nwhite shirt, wear a suit jacket over it. If you want a few pointers on how to dress, read this article by Monster.\nMaintain a fairly constant distance from the webcam.\nDon't drum your fingers or use the keyboard to type notes during your call. Sensitive microphones will magnify\nevery sound.\nLook at the camera, not the screen. Don't try to stare at it constantly, but do look directly into it when you want to\nemphasize a point or convey sincerity.\nSmile! Exude energy, confidence, and optimism.\nPhone Interviews\nPhone interviews are a little nerve-wracking because of limited feedback from your interviewer. You can't see a\nreassuring nod or smile to tell if you are on the right track. In addition to securing a quiet spot and double-checking your\ninterview time, these two simple tricks will make a big difference in helping you come across as calm, confident, and\nupbeat.\n1. Remain standing and walk around\n2. Smile (even if no one's in the room)\nEven if people can't see you, you will sound better if you're smiling, moving, and well-dressed than if you're slouched on\nthe couch in your pajamas. Also, moving helps you shed stress.\nInterview Day\nYou've done your preparation and the big day is finally here. Don't worry. You'll rock this. Having confidence will improve\nyour performance, so do what you can to feel invincible. Read through your PAR stories to remind yourself how\nawesome you are, press your shirt (details make a differences), and leave an extra half hour for traffic.\n319 15.7 The Aesthetics of the Application\nSome jobs will only ask for your resume; others will ask for a cover letter or a written statement in addition to your\nresume. If your potential place of employment asks for multiple documents, you must make sure they present a unified\nfront. Basically, both the content and visual elements should tell the same story.\nJust like you dress the part for an event, you need to dress up your application materials. If you are trying to impress a\ndate, you probably aren\u2019t going to wear your grandpa\u2019s Hawaiian shirt with your sister\u2019s pleather pants. Just a guess.\nMost likely, and probably without even thinking, you\u2019ll be cultivating an image of yourself. Maybe you want to exude\n\u201cHey, I like the outdoors and I smell like pine trees,\u201d so you wear brown boots and a plaid shirt. Maybe you want your\nvibe to be \u201cI\u2019m a cultured person who enjoys the finer things in life,\u201d so you wear dark jeans, a crisp white oxford, and a\nblazer. If the date is to a concert, you know you'll wear jeans and a t-shirt . . . unless it is a philharmonic concert. Then, to\nborrow words from Justin Timberlake, \u201cI be on my suit and tie.\u201d You are considering the genre (what type of date is it),\nthe audience (your date), and your character (how you want the world, or your date, to perceive you).\nThis is what you need to do with your application materials. You want those documents to say that you are smart, with-\nit, bright, mature, and detail oriented. And all parts should look like they belong together (remember the Hawaiian shirt\nand pleather pants?). The easiest way to do this is through colors and fonts. Make sure that you have the same font on\nyour cover letter as you do on your resume. Yes, chances are that they won\u2019t look at those two documents at the same\ntime, but what if they do? You don't want them to wonder why your resume has a Hawaiian vibe while your cover letter\nlooks like it\u2019s from a bad Britney Spears\u2019 music video. That\u2019s bad news.\nComparison\nOpen your two documents (resume and cover letter) side by side on your screen. Do they jive? do they look like\nthey go together? If now, fix them. Make them cohesive. Just like you dress the part, you need to dress up your\napplication materials.\nAs a reminder, always keep your audience in mind. What are they expecting your application materials to look like?\nCheck out the standards in your field. Generally speaking, the same rules apply for all fields; however, they might look\nslightly different. For example, imagine what application materials would look like for someone going into graphic\ndesign. Now think about someone going out for a CPA job. BYU Career Services has collated sample student resumes\nfrom many different fields. Use them as a resource. You can also use other legit online sources to find appropriate\nexamples.\n320 15.8 Graduate School Applications\nThis could be you if you get into graduate school. A killer application will help you get there. Photo by Frits de Jong from\nPixabay\nSo you are one of those who want to slave through a few more years in academia? Before you start dreaming about the\nhallowed halls of academia, you need to get your application materials in order. In addition to submitting your resume or\nCV and transcript, you\u2019ll most likely be asked to provide a personal statement about why you want to attend the school's\nparticular grad program. You also need to be thinking about who you'll ask to write your letters of recommendation.\nCurriculum Vitae\nAs opposed to a traditional one-page resume, a curriculum vitae, or CV, is an academic document that showcases your\nentire academic and professional career and can be multiple pages long. You should include professional contact\ninformation and relevant details of your educational training, coursework, professional training, special\naccomplishments, and skills while focusing on those most relevant to academia\u2014teaching, researching, publishing, and\npresenting. If you\u2019re applying to medical school or a professional school, you should emphasize your specific medical,\ndental, law, PT, etc. experience and training as well.\nFormat\nYour format can include large headings and a generous amount of white space. Create relevant sections with headings\nthat keep this information clear and accessible, and highlight the most important items (from the school\u2019s perspective).\nYour CV should generally be single spaced, 10-12 pt font.\nStyle\nYour style should be fairly formal. Although you do not need to use complete sentences, your style should be clear,\nconcise, and precise. Keep your formatting and wording consistent and parallel.\n321 Examples\nCheck out this site for examples of CVs including tips for writing them.\nPersonal Statement\nAlthough sometimes daunting to write, a personal statement (aka statement of intent or letter of intent) gives you the\nspace to tell your specific audience why you should be admitted. You get to tell what talent, skills, and perspective you\nbring to the incoming class in an interesting and engaging way. Sometime you\u2019ll receive a bit of a prompt, other\nprograms will just ask you to write a \u201cPersonal Statement\u201d or \u201cStatement of Intent\u201d or \u201cLetter of Intent.\u201d\nPersonal Statement Questions\nRespond to the following: (Yes, there are a lot of questions, but these will help you create a really fantastic and\nspecific statement)\nWhat is your purpose in graduate study?\nWhat is the area of study in which you wish to specialize? (Use the language of the field)\nWhat is your intended future use of your grad study?\nWhat is your unique preparation and fitness for study in the field?\nDo you have any problems or inconsistencies in your records/scores?\nDo you have any special conditions that are not revealed elsewhere in your application?\nWhat did you learn from the problems or inconsistencies or special conditions?\nHow have those experiences made you into the person you are today?\nThese should be made into positive statements about your abilities and future.\nWhy do you want to attend their university? Be specific.\nConventions of the Genre\nBe conservative with your design and writing style\nIf no page requirement is listed\u2014stick to 2 pages max, singled-spaced.\n12 point in a conservative font like Garamond, Calibri, or Times New Roman\nYour essay must emotionally engage the reader and directly link to the narrative you created with your resume or CV. It\nshould show a unique point of view and reinforce all of the rest of your application materials. It should unfold the story\nof what have you done in your life up to this point that uniquely positions you to be a top candidate for this particular\nprogram.\nNo opening or closing salutation\nYour essay should begin\nATTN: Graduate Selection Committee (unless you are posting your work in a text box)\nThe beginning of your essay should have a hook. You can grab the reader\u2019s attention with a spellbinding anecdote,\ncounter-intuitive statement, or shocking one-liner.\n322 The essay should be written in the first person as it creates an intimacy between the writer and the reader. We want our\nwork to be emotionally appealing.\n1. Begin with personal details outlining the \u201cWHY\u201d: the why of your academic and career plans\nTell how you first became interested in the subject you plan to study\nProvide anecdotes from childhood, early academic life, travel, service, or other experience\n2. Present some recent experience and accomplishments in the field\nCourse work you've excelled in\nAwards you've received\nAspects of the field that inspire you\nClubs you've participated in\nConferences you've presented at\nPapers you've published\n3. Goals for the Future\nYou should explain why attending THEIR university matters to the achievement of your goals. Notice the difference\nbetween the following\n\"I want to attend X University because I want to study women\u2019s health\u201d\n\"As you can see, from the time I was 16, I\u2019ve dedicated myself to researching the impact of the environment on\nwomen\u2019s health in 3rd world countries. My time spent studying under Dr. MacKenzie has taught me the value of\nworking alongside someone who not only excels in academia but also gets their boots dirty, so to speak. X\nUniversity\u2019s reputation for providing onsite training and fieldwork, in addition to preparing its students to hold their\nown in the academic setting is unparalleled. I would be honored to be among those students. I would also love the\nopportunity to study with Professor Ludlow, given her groundbreaking research on microplastics and women\u2019s\nhealth in India. Her article found in...\u201d\n4. Conclusion\nSummarize what you've already written\nPerhaps touch back on the hook from your intro\nExpress interest in THEIR program\nThank them for their consideration\nA quick note about educational or work foibles from Vana C. Koutsomitis (it's corny, but true):\n\"Maya Angelou famously said, 'We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has\ngone through to achieve that beauty.' This is true of your professional evolution. You might feel like you are\nnot where you want to be\u2014or not where you thought you\u2019d be by now\u2014but your journey will evolve. There is\nnothing wrong with revealing the bumps along the way, as long as you can articulate where you want to\ngo. The most important exercise . . . is defining your values, goals, and mission and working consistently\nin that direction.\"\nMentors\nMany students cruise through university without taking advantage of all that the university has to offer. No, I\u2019m not\ntalking about renting out the cinema room on the 4th floor. I\u2019m talking about the potential to find a mentor in one or two\nof your professors. Take advantage of this opportunity. Seek out a professor with whom you have a connection. And,\nfrankly, if you are in a class of 350 students, it\u2019s going to be hard to make a connection during class time. Office hours\nprovide a great opportunity to get to know your professors, and they'll be happy to answer any questions you have.\n323 So, just like in an interview, come prepared! Ask them how they got to be where they are. Ask them about their\nexperiences in grad school. Ask them how they knew they were on the right career path. Ask them about their specific\nfield. Ask. Ask. Ask. Listen and take notes. Be engaged and courteous. Tell them what your current plans are and ask for\nadvice. Ask if they know of anyone in the field that might be willing to talk with you or let you shadow them. Then, a day\nor so later, shoot them an email thanking them for their time. Be specific on why their interview was helpful to you. You\nalso can do this type of interview in the workplace with people who have the job you want someday. It can be a great\nway to make connections and find out what it takes to reach your goals.\nThis is only one way of finding and creating a mentor. Sometime it happens organically. Sometimes you have to go out\nand make it happen. Mentors can encourage and guide us. They can connect us with others that can further our career\nand enrich our lives. Go the extra mile and make these connections.\nLetters of Recommendation\nMost grad programs will ask for multiple letters of recommendation. That means that you have the opportunity to show\ndifference aspects of your personality and work ethic. Your boss, your mentor, and your professors have all had different\nexperiences and interactions with you. Give careful thought to which qualities you want highlighted in your letters, and\nconsider which of your contacts will best be able to showcase those qualities. Your professor and your boss will have\ndifferent experiences with you and will be able to highlight various qualities you possess. Don't procrastinate this\ndecision; you want to give your recommenders several weeks' notice.\nWhen you approach your letter-writers, make sure to ask if they can write a strong recommendation\u2014you want to know\nnow if they have any hesitation and why. If everything still seems golden, go ahead and provide them with your due\ndates, application materials (resume or CV, personal statement), and a list of your attributes, accomplishments, and\nexperiences. You can even tell them what the other letter writers will talk about. Don't hesitate to remind them of the\nlooming deadline if they haven't submitted their letter yet.\nBe sure to drop by with a small token of appreciation (chocolate, office plant, etc.) and thank them for their work. They\nare taking time out of their busy schedule to provide a free service for you.\n324 15.9 Personal Branding\nYou need a presence online so potential employers can find you. Photo by FirmBee on Pixabay\nOnline Presence\nJust like you were concerned about your narrative in your application materials, you need to worry about what story is\nfound in your online presence. It's important to make sure that what you've been putting out to the world is what you\nwant your potential employers to see. It is also important to ensure that what you are putting out there is authentic and\nuniform across all platforms. Not only do you want the narrative in your resume and cover letter to match, you want to it\nmatch across Facebook and Instagram and Twitter. Revisit the narrative you created in the Interview section and create\na 2-3 sentence-long description of yourself. You can use this for your \"elevator pitch\" when you meet someone, in\ninterviews, or your tagline on social media.\n325 Image by Washington & Lee University\nNote how the first bullet point asks for a professional photo. It's because it's important. But it doesn't mean that you\nhave to break the bank. Ask your roommate or a friend to take a picture of you in natural light. Wear professional\nclothes; pick a neutral background. Then upload that picture to each site. Just don't use a selfie or crop a vacation pic.\nYour Personal Brand\nYour Personal Brand Review what Washington & Lee University has said about personal branding (above). Go\nthrough your Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter and make necessary changes. Write a quick\nparagraph detailing some of the changes you made.\nLinkedIn\nLook over your LinkedIn profile and make sure that it reflects best practices in your target industry. Different industries\u2014\nand even different functions within industries\u2014have different standards and expectations. Modify your headline and\nsummary to point toward the job you want. Make sure your profile is \u201csearch optimized\u201d by including key skills and\nphrases in your descriptions of accomplishments at former positions. If you have done a thorough job of the Audience\nAnalysis earlier in this chapter, you\u2019ll be set to hit the ground running. If you are new to LinkedIn, do a little genre\nresearch. Find people who have the job you want and let their LinkedIn profiles inspire you content, formatting, etc. If\n326 possible, connect with these people and seek their advice. Join groups in your industry and begin engaging with the\nmembers. You could even interview one of these people to find out more.\nResearchGate\nCheck out this Science article about the role the social networks ResearchGate or Academia.net can play in your online\npresence. It gives great information about how to connect to others in academia and filter out information and research\nyou don't want.\nCommencement\nDon't forget to enjoy the moment. Photo by Baim Hanif on Unsplash\nThinking about life after college can be one of two things: absolutely thrilling or absolutely mind numbing. There are so\nmany choices and options. If you\u2019ve known you were going to be a dentist since the time you were three, good for you.\nGo after your tooth (ful)filling dreams. If you are still trying to decide what to do with your life (and you graduate this\nsemester), good for you. Keep waiting tables until you decide. Life is long and it often twists and turns in unexpected\nand beautiful ways. Although this chapter isn\u2019t about helping you decide what path to take but how to put your best foot\nforward once you begin down that road, it\u2019s helpful to take a minute to think of where you\u2019ve been, where you\u2019d like to be,\nand enjoy where you are in this moment.\nOnce you're ready to take the first step toward life after undergrad, know that you have the tools to create really stellar\napplication materials. Start small, start early, and start with the basics. Make sure you know your audience well. Get\nready to write and revise and revise and revise and . . . you got it--revise! You\u2019ll want to get everything as near to\nperfection as you can. Make plans to ask trusted people (mentors, professors, people in the field, etc.) to make sure that\nyou are presenting your character the way you want and that your message is persuasive. Get comfortable with helpful\n327 criticism. Begin looking at your online presence through the eyes of a potential employer or grad school mentor. Ask\nyourself if you need to revisit some of the content you\u2019ve posted online. If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d then take the time now to\nspruce up your image.\nTake your time with your application materials and put the effort in. You\u2019ve got what it takes to do what you love!\nWith a good application, you, too, can end up doing what you love!

But despite how\ncommon email is, it's deceptively hard to write a really good email. You want your messages to be clear, correct,\nconcise, and to-the-point. You want to get the the meat of your message quickly but at the same time keep a light,\nprofessional tone. Focus on these Do's and Don'ts:\nThe Do's of Email\nBe polite and considerate.\nAlways be a bit more formal if you are writing to your superior or someone in a position of authority. It's smart to err\non the side of being too formal.\nBegin with an appropriate salutation. Find out how your professor/boss/peer would like to be addressed. Or if you\ndon't know, notice how they sign their emails or refer to themselves. If they live in academia-land, stick with\nProfessor or Dr. If they live in the real world, use Mr. for men and Ms. for women. (Mrs. and Miss are out-dated\nterms that unnecessarily emphasize women's marital status--don't use them unless someone specifically requests\nit.)\nUse the subject line. It should clearly and concisely state what the email is about. Don\u2019t use a vague subject line or\nstart a sentence in the subject line and finish it in the body. In a professional setting, don't make bad puns or jokes.\nBe careful when using the Reply All option. Read the article. \u2018Nuf said about that. But only say \"'Nuf said\" if you're\nwriting to your best bud and not your boss.\nSign your emails with a friendly closing salutation like \"Sincerely,\" or \"Best regards.\" And think twice before using\nemail signatures.\n332 The Don'ts of Email\nDon\u2019t email your professor/boss if you can find the answer to your question elsewhere (e.g., it\u2019s in the syllabus, the\ntextbook, online, or ask a classmate or coworker).\nDon\u2019t ask, \u201cDid I miss anything important when I didn\u2019t come to the meeting/class yesterday?\u201d\nDon\u2019t use emoticons or emojis and don\u2019t overuse exclamation points.\nDon\u2019t be overly informal (e.g., avoid slang or spellings like \"thx\"). Capitalize sentences and the word \"I\" like normal\n(this is not a text message) but don't use ALL CAPS (that's the email equivalent of yelling).\nDon't send GIFs in professional settings.\nAvoid being snaky, rude, or curt. It might be funny and sarcastic, but your audience may not read it that way. It's\nmuch harder to convey feeling through email, so don't assume your reader will understand if you're joking.\nDon\u2019t try to deal with a problem in an email that would be better served by a phone call or an office visit.\nWith all of these things, Think: what does this question or situation imply about me?\nNow, I can hear some of you saying \u201cMy boss uses emojis!\u201d That\u2019s cool. Your boss can use emojis, and you can, too, as\nlong as you let your boss make the first move to informality. The same thing goes with salutations. Always use the\nproper format and formal names, but let them drop the salutations before you do. Let your boss/professor sign their\nfirst name before you address them as such. Let your boss use slang or emojis before you do.\nRemember, you\u2019d rather be slightly overdressed to a party than under dressed. Same thing goes for workplace writing.\nIt's better that your writing be slightly over-formal than sloppy and ill-mannered.\nWhat's Wrong With This Email #1?\nHey, I lost my syllabus because someone stole my notebook so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s do tomorrow. Can you tell\nme what we need to do for class? Thxs!!! Hildegard <3\nSent at 11:59pm\n16.3 Memo\nA memo is a weird thing. It lives in the space between an old-school letter and an email. The great thing about a memo\nis that it forces us to get to the meat of our message quickly. And, being that it is slightly more formal than an email, it\nimmediately tells our audience that this information is important.\nSo when do we send a memo?\n333 If it is part of the company protocol.\nWhen the message is too long to be contained in an email.\nIf the document is going to be printed out and placed, say, on a bulletin board.\nWhen we need to convey detailed and complex information to those outside of our workplace.\nConventions of the Genre\nMemos look a lot like email--if the email were written out in a Word document. Follow this format to create a memo (you\ncan also use a template from Word or Google to begin with):\n\u201cMemorandum\u201d or \"Memo\" as the title (flushed left)\nTo: (readers' names and job titles) From: (your name and job title) Date: (complete and current date) Subject: (what the\nmemo is about, highlighted in some way)\nBlock format (flushed left, with no indentation for new paragraphs)\nNo salutation\nNo signature\nMake sure that you get to the main point of your memo quickly. That means that the first sentence is your purpose\nstatement. The content should be short and to-the-point and provide the context or background information briefly. The\nlast sentence should be a clear action request.\nMemo Examples\nGoogle \"Memo Examples\" and peruse the examples that come up to get an idea of what memos look like and\nthe kind of language and style they typically use. Now think of 3 possible instances when you might be asked to\nwrite a memo in your future career.\n16.4 Multimodal Writing\nNow we're going to talk about different types of writing that use more than words. We call this multi-modal. You will\ndiscover how image, video, color, and other design choices can forward the argument you are making with your words.\nIn fact, the various modes should be an argument by themselves. When you create a multi-modal argument, you will\nbring all modes together into one cohesive, unified, effective ensemble.\n16.5 Social Media\nYou're probably very familiar with how to navigate and use social media to promote your own image and purposes, but\nhow can you do this on behalf of a company or group? Just because you were born during a certain time frame (Hello\niGen'ers!) you *might* be asked to write the social media content for the company you work for. Let's do what we've\nbeen taught to do when we are tasked with something new and analyze the genre.\nGENRE ANALYSIS\nLet's use a single company to analyze the social media genres you might be writing. Let's \"just do it\" and use Nike.\nSpend a bit of time scrolling through Nike's website, Instagram, and Twitter feed.\n334 Website\nInstagram\nTwitter\n335 Genre Analysis 1\nWhat are the differences between the three genres? It might help to create a table to organize your findings.\nLook at both the visual aspects as well as the writing.\nGenre Analysis 2\nWhat are the similarities between the three genres? And how does Nike keep their branding similar across the\nthree genres?\nImages\nSprout Social found that 58% of consumers prefer \"visual-first content, with graphics, images and produced video taking\nthe lead.\" Or, as my students say, the images hook and then the words inform. Look at the images found on the various\nplatforms. Notice that the images are cohesive and visually appealing. It might seem superficial, but many of our\nreaders will make snap judgement just by looking. Our goal is to present a professional product and we need to do that\nthrough both the visual and compositional element. If you need a refresher on visual rhetoric, see Chapter 6 Design.\n336 Hashtags\nBe strategic with your use of hashtags. (They act almost like the keywords found in your literature review.) You want to\nattract potential customers or users by using appropriate hashtags that describe your product or company or enhance\nthe narrative you are trying to tell. Avoid cultural appropriation. And avoid hashtag overkill.\nTakeaways\nLook at other successful companies that are similar to yours. What does their social media content look like? What\nlessons can you learn from their feed?\nReview your company's mission statement, values, narrative, and purpose.\nAsk yourself who, specifically, is your audience? The wrong answer is \"the entire world.\"\nConsider your audience's expectations. What are they expecting to see or to learn from your posts or tweets?\nAdhere to genre conventions:\nBlog\u2014concise paragraphs with carefully cultivated images.\nTweet\u2014280 characters to get your message across. Choose wisely.\nInstagram and Facebook post\u2014short and sweet messages with cohesive visual elements.\nBrainstorm ways in which you can quickly and efficiently highlight the purpose of the post or tweet\n16.6 Online Writing\nWritnig online can be harder than it looks. Photo by Scott Graham on Unsplash\nIt is highly likely that you will be asked to write a blog post or online article for the future company you work for. Even if\nyou go into academia, most departments expect their professors to have an online presence. Often, these online writing\nis persuasive and informative. They ask the reader to reconsider previously held ideas or to take action. Like all of the\nother genres we've discussed in this textbook, an understanding of audience is extremely important.\n337 One of the worst things you can do when writing online is to write in a manner inconsistent with your target medium.\nJust as you adopt a different tone in letters asking Mom for money than you would in a letter to your bank asking for a\nloan, you also must know the conventions of the place where your writing will be read.Your tone must be balanced and\nconsistent and your voice unique\u2014humorous or cynical, angry or sorrowful, objective or contemplative--but definitely the\nvoice of the writer. If you're writing for your job, remember that you are not writing as a private individual, but as an\nemployee. You are an extension of the company and must write as such.\nAs you'e writing, follow these steps. First, state the issue at hand. Good pieces evolve from current issues concerning\nand intriguing the intended readers. Next, state a position on the question or issue. The best and most effective pieces\nthen go on to state the opposite position's best argument, which is then knocked down by the writer's better argument.\nBack your position with evidence, data and stories. Last, provide a call to action or restate the issue you want your\naudience to reconsider. Remember the tips for writing for General Audiences in Chapter 14.\nOpen strong\nStart with an attention-grabbing opening line that cuts to the heart of your key message and encourages people to read\nfurther. Online articles are meant to be read quickly. If an article is not interesting, readers generally will not bother\nfinishing it. Therefore, it is crucial that you begin with a good lead, an opening sentence or story that \"hooks\" readers\nimmediately and makes them want to read on. A good lead tantalizes, informs, and sets the tone for the piece. It can\neven be creative.\nFor instance, an editorial on gambling in the Wall Street Journal began with a paraphrase of Dr. Seuss: \"I do like\ngambling, Sam-I-Am, I really like it, and I can. For I can do it in a plane, on a boat, at the track, and in the rain. I can do it\nin a casino, with the lottery, or with Keno.\" This type of beginning immediately evokes an emotion reminiscent of books\nfrom childhood but with a grown-up theme. This leads to curiosity and reading on. Readers make decisions on whether\nor not to read an article by how they respond to the headline and the first sentence. In other words, the first line is the\ndisplay-window for all the goodies you have inside; waste no time in getting to your point.\nUse active and conversational voice\nEmphasize active verbs. Don't overuse adjectives and adverbs, which only weaken writing. Write to the level of your\naudience.\nKeep paragraphs short but variable\nIn general, paragraphs should be no more than 3-5 sentences. Keep sentences short. If a sentence is overly long, your\naudience will get lost (and bored).\nIf you want to deliver a really punchy point, remember\u2014single sentence paragraphs rock!\nThe reason is \"gray space,\" the way a long block of text tends to turn gray upon glancing. The most important\nconsideration about shorter paragraphs is that they're easier for readers to read. Long unbroken blocks of text are\ndaunting to most readers. Frequent paragraphs promise a sort of \"rest stop\" to readers. One advantage to this is that\nyou don't need to keep your paragraphs wholly unified and long as in academic writing.\nFind the story\nWe all love dazzling our friends with great data and facts, but to really make an impact with your piece wrap your data in\na story. Refer to real world events or personal experiences that you and your audience have likely encountered. Don\u2019t try\njust to teach your readers, touch them emotionally.\nInclude Images\nImages are often the first things that hook the reader. Make sure that your images promote your message and are there\nfor a purpose. Make sure that the images you use create a cohesive aesthetic for the article, post, or overall blog. Just\nlike your words tell a story about the content and the writer, so do your images. A word of caution\u2014provide proper\n338 attribution for each image you include. If you don't know if an image is copyrighted, don't use it. Instead go to Creative\nCommons or my personal favorite: Unsplash where you can find thousands of beautiful, copyright-free images.\nYou can also do an Advanced Search in google imge search to find copyright-free images. Under \"Settings,\" click\n\"Advanced Search\" and then at the bottom look for \"Usage Rights.\" Click on the drop-down menu and choose \"Free to\nUse or Share.\" Now all the images that come up in your search will be free to use.\nGive Credit\nBeware that even if an image is free to use or share, you still need to say where you got it. Look through this textbook\nand notice that all the images are copyright-free or have a Creative Commons copyright. Note also that we always say\nwhere the images some from--that's called Attribution and is often required, so just get used to doing it. Be a\nresponsible online writer! Give credit!\n16.7 Infographics\nAn information graphic is a document that uniquely displays information and data in a compelling way. The use of\ngraphics, images, and symbols allows readers to download information much more quickly than text alone. You have\nprobably seen them used for advertising or public service ads. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the\nsponsoring institution of BYU) even has a collection of infographics in their Newsroom which communicate complex or\ncontroversial topics in an easy to read format.\nCheck out this infographic of infographics to get a look at the genre.\nCreating infographics\n339 As rhetorical masters you are ready to go beyond writing documents; now you can design them. Now you get to use the\nrhetorical principles we have discussed throughout this textbook in an even more engaging way. There are many\ndifferent modes of rhetoric\u2014remember, everything is rhetoric\u2014but each mode has its own rhetorical strengths and\nweaknesses.\nYour audience will be anyone who is interested in the information you are presenting in your infographic. You need to\ncreate a document that will engage and inform them quickly, and inspire them to seek out further knowledge. Because\nof its easy access and shareability, your infographic will pull in a much larger secondary audience. So, be sure to create\na document that less-informed audience members will understand and appreciate.\nIn addition to Photoshop, InDesign, and Powerpoint, there are many online infographic generators to choose from.\nCheck out the following generators and find one the suits your needs:\nCanva\npiktochart\nVenngage\nVisme\nFormatting an infographic\nFormatting is entirely up to you. A good rule of thumb is to use around 250 words of text in your document and a\ncombination of images and charts/graphs. Simplified images are usually better than actual photos. Just remember:\nyour visual rhetoric should make your argument as effectively as your written rhetoric does.\nBeware of including information that comes from only one source, since this can unfairly drive the facts towards a\nparticular conclusion. In the social sciences, this is called single-source bias. Look at your infographic the same way\nthat you would a research paper or a university essay. The more sources you have, and the more building blocks you\nhave to tell an interesting story, and the more credible that story is.\n340 341 16.8 Opinion Editorials\nDon't be like this. Use a convincing argument instead! Photo by Steve Johnson on Unsplash\nA good opinion editorial (aka op ed) offers a perspective on a current item of interest to the readers of a specific\npublication. Hence, an understanding of audience is extremely important. Moreover, opinion pieces are the product of\nan individual, not a committee. That means that the author must insure his or her voice shines through and that the\ntone is appropriate for the topic of the piece.\nAlso, while it may seem obvious, it bears repeating: the best opinion pieces are lively, informative, and good pieces of\nwriting.\nOpinion editorials and other newspaper and magazine articles have very short paragraphs. In general, no more than\ntwo or three sentences make up a typical paragraph. Like other online writing, don\u2019t feel you need to keep your\nparagraphs unified and long. In opinion writing it is perfectly legitimate to begin new paragraphs often, even if it means\ncontinuing a thought begun in an earlier paragraph.\nAnother consideration about op ed writing is that you must grab the reader\u2019s attention quickly. Articles are meant to be\nread quickly, and rarely are they ever read again. And if an article is not interesting, readers generally will not bother\nfinishing it.\nA final consideration for op-ed pieces is that it must be short and concise. Although lengths of op-ed pieces in real\nnewspapers vary\u2013those in the New York Times may be longer than those in smaller papers, for example\u2013you should\nwaste no time in getting to your point.\n342 What aspect of your research topic would make a good opinion piece?\nChoose something you discovered from your research and that you have a strong opinion about. What could be\na good argument you could make about that topic?\n16.9 A Few Final Words\nBy now, you should know the importance of getting to know your genre. If you know what the genre constraints are\nbefore you begin writing and you are keeping your audience expectations in mind, you will save yourself a huge\nheadache and avoid heavy usage of the delete button. Also, make sure that you are considering your own character--\nwhether you are writing as yourself or as a spokesperson for your company--and how your voice and tone could be\nperceived by your audience. Using images are powerful, but make sure they are consistent with the message and\nnarrative you are attempting to deliver.\nYou\u2019ve been doing all of these steps for a long time. Since you began asking mom or dad for a few bucks for the\nweekend or your boss for some time off. Since convincing a certain someone to date you. Since you started creating\nyour perfect Instagram or TikTok persona. See . . . you are a natural. Now, go out and change the world!\nReferences\nThe 2018 Sprout Social Index: realign and redefine.

You'll demonstrate your ability with presentation media and with public speaking skills, including\nfocusing a topic,\nadapting it to the understanding of a particular audience,\norganizing main points coherently and supporting them with adequate detail, and\ndelivering a message effectively using appropriate audio and visual aids.\n347 17.1 Zen and the Art of Oral Presentation\nAs important as it is to write clearly in today's professional world, speaking clearly is equally essential\u2014in meetings, on\nthe phone, in formal presentations, in conversations with supervisors and subordinates, at conferences, in elevators,\nand even when asking for a raise. It turns out there's an art to speaking clearly just as there's an art to writing clearly,\nand many of the same tools you use in writing can help you create exceptional presentations.\nOften when I introduce the concept of presentations, my students tell me this fills them with dread. One of the reasons\nfor this dread is past bad presentation experiences. For every amazing oral presentation in this world, there are oodles\nof terrible ones. You've probably sat through one yourself\u2014the kind that's either endlessly boring or excruciatingly\nembarrassing or just misses its audience completely. So it\u2019s my job to teach you the life-and-death skill of creating an\nawesome oral presentation so no one ever has to suffer from what\u2019s commonly known as \u201cDeath by PowerPoint.\u201d I, too,\nhave suffered from a bad presentation experience.\nBad Presentations\nWhen I was eight years old, my family moved from the urban, diverse, fairly dangerous South Side of Chicago . . .\n348 . . . to suburban, much-less-diverse, very-non-dangerous Provo, Utah.\nAs you can imagine, I had some culture shock. For example, I was used to a very small group of children in my church\ncongregation in Chicago where I felt confident and at home. That all changed when I walked into my new children's\nchurch room bursting with dozens of kids all staring at me\u2014the New Girl. Soon I was asked to give a two-minute talk in\nfront of this group. What would have seemed like a simple task in Chicago now loomed like the scariest monster in\nProvo. How could I possibly give a talk with all those eyes staring at me\u2014the New Girl?\nMy mom devised a solution: she found a big picture from a scripture story and taped my talk to the back of it so I could\nhold the picture up in front of my face while I spoke. So that's what I did: I stood at the mic, held on to that picture in\nfront of my face like a battle shield, and read my talk word-for-word off the back. This, clearly, was a low point in my\npresentation history.\n349 Luckily, it got better. As I grew older, I got more and more comfortable speaking in front of an audience and even gave a\nfew successful presentations in high school and college. I learned how to take my notes and morph them into bullet\npoints on a PowerPoint slide (like the one below), sometimes with a picture or two added for interest. And I eventually\ngot by just fine.\nMy Old, Text-Based, Me-Oriented Format\nBut it wasn't until I began teaching at BYU that I found my presentation zen. Literally. A colleague of mine (Brian\nJackson, the author of Chapter 3), gave me a book called Presentation Zen Design by Garr Reynolds that changed my\nwhole outlook on presentations. I had imagined my presentations in class as a way to portray my points one-by-one on\na screen (me-oriented), but Reynolds made me think from my audience's point of view and decide what would appeal\nmost to them (audience-oriented). The result was slides like this new, zen one.\n350 My New, Zen Audience-Oriented Slide Format\nPresentation Zen\nReynolds who lives in Japan, offers the Buddhist Zen ideas of simplicity, restraint, and naturalness as a model for re-\nthinking the genre of presentations. In other words, like a beautiful and peaceful Japanese Zen Garden, slides should\nbe cleared of clutter and instead point solely to the essence of the message.\nA zen garden\u2014and a good presenter\u2014focuses on restraint, simplicity, and naturalness. Photo by Paul Mannix on Flickr.\nZen Presentations utilize \"restraint in preparation, simplicity in design, and naturalness in delivery.\" \u2014Garr\nReynolds (p. 22)\n351 Reynolds insists that presentations encourage the audience to focus on the person presenting--not on the slides. For\nexample, he encourages his readers to get rid of \"Death by PowerPoint\" (badly designed, bullet-point-based slides that a\npresenter reads word-for-word) and instead focus on a clear message and slide simplicity--in other words, zen design.\nBut enough reading! I believe the best thing you can do to learn about all this is to experience other people's excellent\nones, so I think we should start by hearing from Garr Reynolds himself from a TEDx Talk he gave in Kyoto, Japan. Don't\nworry; it's (mostly) in English. I want you to pay attention to both what he says as well as how he presents it since he is,\nof course, also a master presenter. It's 15 minutes long, but trust me, you want all the information in it, so please watch\nthe whole thing.\nWatch on YouTube\nGarr Reynolds's TEDx Talk \"Why Storytelling Matters\" https://youtu.be/YbV3b-l1sZs\nGarr Reynolds's TEDx Talk\nDescribe the top 2-3 presentation principles you learned from Garr Reynolds's TED Talk. What strategies do\nyou plan to incorporate into your own oral presentation?\nDid you notice how relaxed Reynolds seemed in his presentation? Did you notice the simplicity of his slides\u2014or the fact\nthat the camera focused on him personally most of the time and not on his visuals? What about the clarity of his\nmessage? Could you write down his main point in one sentence? What about the flow? Did it feel organized? Did the\n352 count from 1 to 10 help you know where he was and where he was going? Did you like his additions of humor? Did you\nlearn something? I hope your answer to all these questions is yes.\nSimple but captivating images give your audience breathing room. Image by Hong Zhang from Pixabay.\nIn the rest of this chapter, we're going to explore the elements that go into two types of presentations: the traditional\noral presentation and the poster presentation. There might even be some stories and a video or two. So take a deep,\ncleansing breath, put on some soothing music, and get ready to find your presentation zen.\n353 17.2 The Oral Rhetorical Situation\nBy aki.sato (aki sato) - https://www.flickr.com/photos/neco299/5320569712/, CC BY-SA 2.0,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=12819363\nJust like when facing any writing task, the first step to creating a strong oral presentation is to analyze the rhetorical\nsituation. Garr Reynolds used the example of the art of Kamishibai Japanese storytelling to explain the three-part\nharmony of an oral presentation:\n1. A master storyteller uses\n2. Visual elements (they used hand-drawn slides) to tell a story to\n3. An engaged audience.\nSounds like the rhetorical triangle, right? Remember, a Speaker (aka Writer) gives a Message to an Audience (see\nchapter 2). We'll talk about all these elements, but when it comes to oral presentations, I suggest you think about the\naudience first.\nAudience\nProbably the most important thing to consider in creating an oral presentation is your audience. You might have the\nbest message in the world, but if you don't understand your audience, they'll miss or at least dismiss your message.\nNancy Duarte, owner of a successful presentation design company, gave a famous TED Talk about what makes the best\npresentations. She asserted that you as the presenter might think that you're Luke Skywalker\u2014that you are the hero of\n354 your talk, but you're not. The audience is the hero. You are Yoda\u2014the guide. Or should I say, \"Luke you are not. Yoda you\nare.\"\nWho's your audience?\nAs your audience's guide, you need to understand them, and the best way to do this is to put yourself in their shoes.\nMost presentation experts agree that the concept of empathy is paramount (Duarte, Reynolds, Stinson); if you can really\nunderstand your audience, you'll be much more successful at portraying your message. For example, it's most likely that\nin this class you'll be presenting in front of your fellow classmates. Part of your grade may even come from your peers.\nWhat an Audience Wants\nThink about when you've watched someone else's presentation. What elements did you appreciate about it?\nBeautiful images? Good data? Humor? A compelling story? Confident delivery? Did anything not go well? How\ncan you apply all this to your own presentation? In other words, what do you think your audience wants from\nyou?\nAs you prepare, ask yourself these questions about your your audience:\nWhat do they already know? This determines how much background info you must provide.\nWhere do they stand on the issues related to your topic? Do you think they'll be sympathetic about your topic\ncoming into your presentation? Try to put yourself in their shoes: anticipate their objections or concerns, answer\ntheir questions, play to their passions. If you don't know where they stand, you can ask a sample of them as you\nprepare your presentation. In the business world, this is called market research and involves surveys and focus\ngroups.\nWhat kind of language style or formality will they best respond to? You'll use a different level of formality and\nvocabulary when addressing your professor versus talking to your four-year-old cousin. Similarly, if you aim too\nformal or too high in your vocabulary, your audience either won't understand or will see you as a snob (or both). If\nyou aim too casual, they'll dismiss you as uninformed or will think you're insulting their intelligence. Strike a\nbalance.\nWhat entertains them; what do they find interesting? This can help you figure out something that will grab their\nattention. Most college students respond well to visuals and videos as well as compelling stories. But you can also\nget their attention by stepping away from the technology and doing something offline like a demonstration,\ndescription, or discussion. Just make sure that whatever you choose is short, sweet, and relevant to your\npresentation--no random SpongeBob dances! (Unless that's relevant, then go for it.)\nWhich appeals will they best respond to? Think about the three different rhetorical appeals mentioned in Chapter\n2: Writing Tools and how you might use them to further your argument:\nEvidence and Reasoning\u2014stay organized; use data and evidence to back up your points; set up a clear, logical\nprogression from point to point.\nCharacter\u2014show through citations that you've done your homework, tastefully name-drop, use language that\nwill convince them you're knowledgeable without being full of yourself, dress like a professional.\nEmotion\u2014tell stories, show pictures or videos that demonstrate the impact on people, show vulnerability, pull\nat their heartstrings.\nZen Connection\nGarr Reynolds did a fantastic job of connecting to his audience in the video you watched. He showed that he was aware\nof his Japanese audience at the TEDx Conference in Kyoto by using examples from Japanese history (like Kamishibai\n355 storytelling), by talking about how he's lived in Japan for many years, and by sometimes throwing in Japanese words or\nphrases. This emphasized that he was aware that he could seem like an outsider to them but he also understood a lot\nabout their culture and what would appeal to them. As you prepare your own oral presentation, think of similar details or\nshared experiences or even inside jokes that would appeal to your classmates. What do you have in common?\nTo really solidify the takeaways about knowing your audience, watch this three-minute video from a presentation design\ncompany Stinson who has researched what audiences are (and are not) looking for in presentations.\nWatch on Vimeo\n10 Things your Audience Hates About your Presentation https://vimeo.com/179236019\n356 Purpose\n(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Gabrielle Joyner/Released)\nNow that you've considered your audience, another essential question to ask yourself is What\u2019s the purpose of your\npresentation? In other words, what's your main message? Can you boil it down to just one sentence?\nGenerally, oral presentations fall into one of three categories of purpose:\n1. To inform\n2. To persuade\n3. To both inform and persuade.\nSo a community health worker might give a presentation to inform new mothers about how to care for their baby's\nneeds while a political candidate might give a speech to persuade you to vote for him or her. Generally in this class,\nyou'll be designing a presentation that's meant to both inform and persuade. In other words, you'll most likely be\ninforming your audience about the topic you've studied all semester, but in the end you'll also want to persuade them to\ndo something related to that topic. This \"something\" is often referred to as a \"Call to Action.\"\nCall to Action\nNancy Duarte (the presentations expert mentioned earlier) says that every presentation should end with a Call to Action.\nShe studied thousands of presentations and discovered that the best ones move in a similar pattern:\n1. First, they talk about a problem (the status quo),\n2. Then they introduce a solution (the new bliss) and\n3. Shift back and forth throughout the presentation between the \"status quo\" and the \"new bliss.\"\n4. Finally, they end with a call to action.\nTo see Duarte's full TED talk, click here. Minutes 5:00-9:00 are especially good.\n357 Imagine your audience asks you the question at the end of your presentation \u201cSo what? What do you want me to do\nabout it?\u201d What is your answer?\nPurpose and Call to Action\nTake a minute and think of your own Presentation topic and write some ideas of what your main message could\nbe. (You should try to distill it down to one sentence.) What kind of problem and solution can you present? Now\nwrite a potential Call to Action you can make at the end of your presentation. What do you want to convince\nyour audience to do?\nGenre\nOne last aspect of the rhetorical situation that's valuable to consider is this question: What are the conventions of the\ngenre\nJust like other types of writing (research papers, proposals, resumes, etc. ), presentations tend to follow a specific\nformat. These conventions have been developed over time as people have had success using certain formats and then\nother people adopt those same formats in their own presentations.\nFor example, in the last decade, a whole new type of oral presentation has become wildly popular: the TED talk. You've\nalready watched one earlier in this chapter. Technology, Entertainment, and Design (TED) is a non-profit, non-partisan\norganization dedicated to spreading of ideas to change the world (cite website). And in order to spread ideas, the TED\n358 organization chose one specific method they thought would be the most powerful. You guessed it: the oral\npresentation.\nThe TED organization believes in \"the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world\"\n(TED Webiste). TED chose one specific method to change the world: oral presentation.\nAnd, in fact, it's worked. The best TED presentations have been watched by millions of viewers, have spread iconic\nmessages across the world, and have made the best speakers famous and/or skyrocketed their careers. That's a lot of\npower in 18 minutes!\nIf you've watched many TED talks, you've probably noticed that most of them have a similar structure beyond the\nobvious beginning, middle, and end. You probably expect a TED presenter to\n1. Start with an attention-getting opener,\n2. Give background information that includes why the topic matters,\n3. Explain a problem (including evidence),\n4. Suggest a solution (including evidence),\n5. Perhaps go back and forth between these, and finally,\n\u0000. Call the audience to some kind of action.\nWithin the talk, you probably expect to see visuals and/or videos, hear stories\u2014especially personal stories that reveal\nsome vulnerability and relatability, laugh at additions of humor, feel a surge of emotions related to the problem, and\u2014if\nthe presenter does their job right\u2014desire to act as part of the solution. And you expect all this to fit into the strict 18-\nminute time limit.\nThe reason most presenters have gravitated toward these conventions is because they work.The most influential\npresentations follow this structure. See, for example, Steve Jobs' 2007 iphone launch . . .\nSteve Jobs right before getting the most applause probably ever given by an audience of Techies. Photo by Miquel C. on\nFlickr\n. . . and Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream Speech\". Not surprisingly, these elements are also good strategies for you\nto use in your own oral presentations. That's where we're going in the next section.\n359 Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech is known as one of the greatest speeches of all time. Photo in Public\nDomain\n360 17.3 Presentation Structure\nNow it's time to plan your structure. Following the conventions of great oral presentations is a great place to start:\n1. Beginning\nStart with an attention-getting opener\nGive background information that includes why the topic matters\n2. Middle\nExplain a problem (including evidence)\nSuggest a solution (including evidence)\nPerhaps go back and forth between these\n3. End\nCall the audience to some kind of action\n361 1. Beginning\nSurprise! It's become part of the genre of oral presentations to begin with an attention-getter. The reason for this is that\npeople generally decide within the first 30 seconds whether they think a presentation will be good or not and whether\nthey'll listen in or tune out. First impressions matter, so take advantage of the moment. This doesn't mean you need to\ndo a wild interpretive dance or a stand-up comedy routine or throw out piles of money for people to take notice. You\nsimply need to do something interesting that's relevant to your topic. This could be as simple as telling a story or\npresenting a surprising statistic, showing a poignant picture, or asking a rhetorical question.\nNancy Duarte began her famous TED Talk with the bold statement, \"I believe you have the power to change the world.\"\nIn contrast, Garr Reynolds talked about his job as a presentations consultant (introducing an appeal to character) and\nadded a promise that he would share the 10 most important things he's learned for improving presentations.\nDo something surprising. I remember one of my students started her presentation speaking to us in Japanese for\nabout 15 seconds. This immediately caught our attention because we wondered why she would do something so out of\nthe ordinary. She went on to talk about second language learners and the best strategies for teaching children to learn a\nsecond language. By speaking in Japanese, she helped her audience feel how uncomfortable it is not to understand the\nlanguage being spoken, which made her audience sympathetic to her cause.\n362 \"Motherese\" is good for babies and presentations on speech pathology. Photo by Torbein Ronning on Flickr\nDo a demonstration. Another student brought a small blanket, wrapped it up and held it like a baby. She began talking\n\"baby talk\" to the blanket for a few moments. She then introduced the concept of \"motherese\" (the exaggerated \"baby\ntalk\" mothers often use with their children). This student explained that although baby talk was discouraged in the past\nas immature and coddling, motherese was actually beneficial to children's language development because it turns out\nmothers naturally exaggerate the sounds the babies first attempt to make. It was fascinating, and I still remember it. I\nalso proudly use baby talk whenever I hold a baby.\nSometimes you can surprise your audience by waiting until after the beginning to really catch their attention. I had a\nMath Education student who started in a typical fashion describing what she had researched about a certain way to\nteach the concept of dividing fractions. Then she stopped her presentation, grabbed a marker, and proceeded to teach\nus a concept\u2014in this case a math concept\u2014the way she would in a classroom by writing it out on the whiteboard. She\ndid such a good job teaching the concept that it was like a lightbulb went off in everyone's brains\u2014suddenly we\nunderstood how to divide fractions! By showing rather than telling, this student proved her point that the new teaching\nmethod was effective.\nThe point is that if you think outside the box and find a way to add interest to your topic, your audience will be more\ninterested in your presentation and will keep listening. Think of how you can involve your audience in your presentation.\nTell a Story\nOne universal way to add interest to a presentation is to add some kind of story. (You can also refer to the section in\nChapter 5 Style that talks about story.) According to Harvard psychologist Jerome Bruner, a person is 22 times more\nlikely to remember a fact when it's told as part of a story (Harrison, 2015). 22 times! Here's a two-minute video of Nancy\nDuarte talking about the power of story:\n363 Watch on Vimeo\nNancy Duarte on the Power of Story https://vimeo.com/20652285\nYou can add storytelling elements to your presentation in two ways: globally and locally.\nGlobal Story\nIf you can take your presentation's message and treat it like a story with a beginning, middle, and end, then you're\nhalfway there. Your presentation itself can feel like a story or a journey you take us on if you start with a theme, develop\nit with strong points and good examples, and end with excitement and closure. Think of the solution you offer like a\n\"happily ever after.\"\n364 Local Story\nA story about two sisters became very personal for one presenter. Photo by Ben White on Unsplash\nYou can also add specific stories about people into your presentation to demonstrate a concept or show an example of\nsomeone affected by the problem you're talking about. I remember a student talking about a migrant worker named\nCharles he met while serving as a volunteer in Spain. Charles's picture and personal story of leaving his wife and\ndaughter in his home country in order to work in Spain and send them money stuck with me and added an emotional,\nhuman element to a presentation on the economics of migration.\nOne of the most powerful types of story is a personal story because it shows vulnerability and helps your audience\nidentify with you. Most TED Talks include some kind of personal story for this reason. I still remember when one of my\nstudents showed a picture of a family and talked about how the older sister's chronic health problems affected the\nfamily. She specifically mentioned the consequences the older sister's illness had on the younger, healthy sister--things\nlike feeling neglected, lonely, and scared. She then revealed that the younger sister was herself and went on to talk\nabout her research about the effects of children with chronic illnesses on their healthy siblings. As you can imagine,\nthese presentations that include a story (whether at the beginning or somewhere else) become more memorable and\npowerful because of them.\nGive Background\nIf your attention-getter is relevant to your topic, it will naturally serve as background on your topic; however, it's also\nimportant to explain why your topic is important. You can do this the way you often do in the Introduction of research\npapers\u2014by providing statistics, giving context, and showing implications surrounding this topic.\n365 Indicate Your Organization\nBecause your presentation is oral, it will be harder for your audience to understand the logical flow of your paper, so do\nthem a favor and indicate in your introduction where you plan to go in your presentation. Explain your purpose so your\naudience knows exactly what your point is and then refer back to it in every section. If you use directional words like\nfirst, second, next, finally, etc., you can cue your listeners to your organization and help them understand the progression\nof your points. Similarly, good transitions between sections and sentences will also help your audience follow your\norganization. You can also add headings to your slides that indicate where you are in your presentation.\nAlthough you'll spend much effort planning your Beginning, it should only take up about 10-20% of your presentation\ntime, so for a 10-minute presentation, that's no more than 1-2 minutes.\n2. Middle\nIf you've done your job at the beginning, your audience should be interested in your topic, understand your purpose, and\nbe ready to hear your main points. In a short presentation (15 minutes or less), you only have time to make about 2-4\nmain points before it's time to conclude\u2014it generally takes up to two minutes to make a point. Even in a longer\npresentation (up to an hour), you still want to focus on only about five main points total, spending a little more time on\neach than you would in a short presentation. So use your time well. It helps to create an outline of this section to keep\nyourself organized.\nEach point you make should refer back to your overall purpose as you go. Focus on the problem that you're trying to\nsolve and the solutions you're offering your audience. Generally, you want to order your points like this:\nsecond strongest point first\nthe rest of your points in the middle\nstrongest point last\n366 This is because your audience will remember your last point best and your first point second best. This section is where\nyou want to cite lots of sources to provide evidence for your points and increase your credibility. You can also appeal to\nyour audience's emotions as you go and include attention-grabbing elements and stories here as well, although your\nstrongest appeal will be logical: whether your examples and evidence are convincing. Again, transitions and directional\nwords (first, second, etc.) will help you guide your audience on your logical journey. The middle section should take up\n60-80% of your presentation.\nWatch this two-minute video on Presentation Structure from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands where they\nreally like seafood:\nMiddle Points\nThink about your purpose and the middle of your own presentation. List 2-4 main points you could make about\nyour topic to inform and persuade your audience. List them in order of second best, your other point(s), then\nyour best point last.\n3. End\nAt the end of your presentation, as in a typical paper's conclusion, you should briefly summarize your main points\u2014\nremind your audience of the journey you took them on. If you started with a story or attention-getter, bring it full circle by\nmentioning it again in the context of the solutions you've offered. Remind your audience of your purpose, then bring it\n367 home with your Call to Action. Answer the question your audience will inevitably be asking: So what? What does this\nhave to do with me? The answer is your invitation to take action to help solve the problem you've introduced. Here are\nsome examples of Calls to Action from my students' class presentations:\nDonate $1 to a fund to stop World Hunger\nAdd the phone number for the suicide prevention hotline to their phones and if they suspect a friend is\ncontemplating suicide, commit to asking them about it directly\nAttend an event during maternal health week at our university\nCall their legislator about an immigration issue\nBe more sympathetic when listening to someone who stutters\nAs in the beginning, the end should also take up between 10-20% of your presentation. Often you'll take questions at the\nend of a presentation, so be sure to plan for that in your timing.\nTiming\nThe only way to have impeccable timing is to practice. Photo in Public Domain\nA word on timing. If your presentation has a time limit, DO NOT GO OVER THE TIME LIMIT! Your audience will\nimmediately stop paying attention when your time is up, and if you're presenting for a class, you'll probably lose points\non your grade.\nPractice giving the presentation, and have a backup plan for how to wrap up if things take longer than anticipated. There\nare various reasons you could run out of time\u2014technical difficulties, the previous presenter going long, a schedule\nchange, etc. Pinpoint places where you could cut or condense your points. I tell my students that when they hit the one-\nminute-left mark, they should start their conclusion whether or not they've made it through all their other points. Timing\nis more important than getting through everything\u2014and mentioning any of your middle points is much less important\nthan ending with a strong conclusion!\n368 References\nHarrison, Kate.

Remember presentation zen and don't get caught up in adding lots of bullet\npoints or images to your slides. You can use this popular software to create your slides:\n369 Microsoft Powerpoint\nKeynote\nGoogle Slides\nPrezi\nBut the most important thing to remember is that you don't need anything fancy\u2014on the contrary, because the focus\nshould be on you not your slides, any slide software should allow you to create simple, clutter-free, message-oriented\nslides.\nKeep presentation zen in mind and don't add something just because you can: don't use fancy swipes or animations,\nand if you really need to refer to notes, put them in the \"Notes\" section of the presentation (seen only by the presenter)\nor use good old-fashioned index cards. See Chapter 6 Design for more instruction on designing beautiful slides. You\ncan also watch David JP Phillips's TED Talk on \"How to Avoid Death by PowerPoint\" where he makes the following\nexcellent points based on what our brains can handle:\nHave only one message per slide\nUse contrast and size to highlight the most important information\nDon't put full sentences on slides (unless you're showing a quote)\nNever include more than 6 items on a slide\nHow Will You Improve?\nName one presentation tool\u2014concerning visuals or delivery\u2014that you've used poorly in the past that you want\nto improve in this presentation. Explain how you'll do better this time around.\n370 Images\nPhoto by H\u00e9ctor J. Rivas on Unsplash\nVisuals should be visual. Relevant images are a powerful way to transmit meaning in a presentation; however, you must\nbe careful that your images enhance what you're saying and don't detract. One way to do this is if you're using a photo,\nhave it take up the whole space of the slide, touching the edges. You can add text to your slide, but keep it very simple.\nYou also need to think about copyright. When you're presenting solely for educational use in a classroom, most images\nand videos will fall under the fair use act and are allowed. However, as soon as you present publicly outside the\nclassroom\u2014even online\u2014you need to be sure you're following copyright guidelines.\nA great way to look for images is go to my favorite website for beuatiful, copyright-free images (where most of the\nimages from this book come from): Unsplash.com. Or you can do a Google Search, click on \"Settings,\" then \"Advanced\nSearch,\" then scroll down to \"usage rights\" and choose \"free to use or share.\" This will bring up images that are generally\nfree to use as long as you attribute who the author is in your text (like a citation). Note: even if you use a copyright-free\nimage, you usually need to attribute the creator in the caption with a link to the online location of the image. For more\ninformation on copyright, go to https://copyright.byu.edu/.\nVideos\nVideos can be very compelling, but make sure they're relevant and that you only show the essential parts. No video\nshould be longer than 20% of the presentation, so in an 8-10 minute presentation, it should be no longer than 2-3\nminutes. If possible, embed videos into your document instead of just having a link that you click on. That said, watch\nout for copyright violation. Linking to a document is not a problem, but if you have to download someone else's video in\norder to embed it, that can be a copyright violation.\n371 If you use links instead, be sure to go in before your presentation and open each video once so no ads pop up at the\nbeginning during your presentation\u2014super annoying! Even if you embed your video, sometimes it doesn't work when you\nclick on it, so I recommend opening the original videos in a different window to have as a backup. Videos are the #1\ntechnology problem in presentations, so have a contingency plan. Incidentally, whenever you introduce a clip\u2014it helps to\ntell your audience something to look for so they watch with a purpose.\nTechnical Difficulties\nI had a French teacher in college who had an anti-talent with technology. Unfortunately, he taught a class on French\nHistory where almost every day he had to show art on a slide projector and play music on a CD player (yes, those were\nthe olden days). Inevitably he could never even get a simple CD player to work and would call out, \"Est-ce qu'il y a un\ntechnicien dans la classe?\" Is there a technician in the class? We lost a lot of time in that class due to technical\ndifficulties (and secretly made fun of him outside of class). Don't be like my French teacher--be prepared!\nIs there a technician in the class?\nWhen you only have 8-10 minutes to make a point, you can't afford time-consuming technical glitches. So make a\nbackup plan! Come early to set up! Test out your presentation and links before you actually get up to present. Email your\npresentation to yourself so you can always access it from another computer if your computer dies. Even better, make a\ncopy on a desktop or thumb drive that you can plug into someone else's computer if the internet suddenly stops\nworking.\nYou can't plan for all technical difficulties--I had a student who wanted to make a point by throwing a glass plate on the\nground (it was safely in a ziplock bag). Unfortunately, the bag split open and actually shattered all over the carpeted\nclassroom floor. After a call to the janitor and a lot of distraction, we got it cleaned up, but not without scaring a lot of\npeople and losing valuable presentation time. Here are some tips with dealing with technical difficulties:\nHave a backup plan (or two)\nTry not to get flustered\nIf something doesn't work twice in a row, calmly move on\nIf you do miss a video, etc., explain what the point of that part of your presentation would have been\n372 Delivery\nDress\nIs this a good look for your presentation? Image by Brian Sawyer on Flickr\nYou\u2019re not Lady Gaga. Don\u2019t wear a dress made out of meat. Dress professionally. I tell my students to think about their\naudience and dress one notch more formally than them. A safe bet is to dress as if you're going to a job interview\u2014that\nwill lend credibility to your presentation. You can't foresee all issues, but you can usually control what you wear. Usually.\nAs an undergraduate, I once presented a paper at a conference, and several of my colleagues and friends came to\nwatch in the audience. I walked up to the podium, gave my presentation, and walked back to my seat. I thought it went\ngreat! Until we walked out of the room and I felt a draft.\nI was wearing a long fitted skirt that had a seam up the back, and unbeknownst to me, the seam had split open almost\nall the way up the back, showing my underwear! It turns out my presentation was much more revealing than I'd meant it\nto be. It was like living that nightmare where you show up to school in your underwear! And no one told me about it until\nafter the conference session!\nAvoid wardrobe malfunctions like mine by choosing professional clothes and practice giving your presentation in them\nso you can find out at home rather than in front of a crowd that your outfit has a weak seam.\n373 Is this a good look for your presentation?\nPractice\nI can't emphasize enough the importance of practicing your presentation before your give it. It's almost impossible to\nget the timing right on the first try, but after practicing it several times with a timer, you'll have a sense of how long each\nsection takes. Find your most honest friend to give you feedback\u2014especially on your delivery.\nA lot of people have ticks or habits or gestures that they don't know they do in front of people. For example, I took an\nacting class and got the feedback that apparently, whenever I'm trying to seem serious or angry, I plant my feet and\nsway back and forth. When I received my first set of student evaluations as a teacher, one of them said I touch my hair a\nlot. I had no idea. Nor did I realize it would bug someone throughout the semester. I just wish they'd told me earlier! By\npracticing your presentation, you can work out all those ticks before you present instead of finding them out in the\ncomments afterward.\n374 Be Confident\nPresent confidently like this. https://flic.kr/p/egvm3w [Public Domain]\nFinally, present confidently! And if you don't feel confident, act confident! Research shows that audiences can't\ndifferentiate between someone who is confident and someone who's just pretending to be. Look your audience in the\neye and speak slowly and clearly. Most novices speak too quietly and way too fast. If you're using a microphone, you\nneed to speak even slower than you think to be understood. I once spoke at a graduation ceremony and the main note I\nreceived during the practice was that I needed to speak half as fast into the microphone! This felt very unnatural, but\nwhen I saw the recording afterward, I realized they were right.\nIf you're nervous about presenting, see Amy Cuddy's TED Talk about how you can increase your confidence in front of\npeople simply by focusing on your posture.\nConclusion\nI hope that now you know that an oral presentation doesn't have to fill you with dread like mine did when I was eight.\nYou just have to find your presentation zen. Simplify, focus on the most important things, stay organized, appeal to\nlogic, character, and emotion, use your resources wisely, practice, and be confident, and you will be on the path to\ncreating inspiring presentations.\n375 Now you're on the path to your presentation zen. Photo in the Public Domain\n17.5 Poster Presentations\nOften, academic and professional conferences include poster sessions, which is a different kind of oral presentation.\nFor most of us the term \"poster\" conjures images of our second grade science fair where we bought a piece of poster\nboard (okay, Mom or Dad bought us a piece of poster board) and then we cut and pasted relevant pictures to help the\nother kids in our class understand the science principle we had researched. It seems counter-intuitive to use such an\nold school technology in today's tech heavy world. But, many of our second grade skills still work beautifully in an\nacademic conference setting.\n376 What is an academic poster session?\nhttps://byrdnick.com/archives/11346/classroom-poster-sessions\nMost academic conferences include workshops, panels, and posters. The poster session of the conference is generally\nheld in a large hall with aisles and aisles of posters reporting current research geared toward conference attendees.\nPoster sessions are loud and chaotic. Dozens of presenters and audiences asking and answering questions and\ngenerally engaged in lively research discussions.\nWhy present a poster instead of a presentation?\nYou could present your research in a presentation format\u2014and many times you will; but, a poster session allows a much\nmore personal interactive engagement with your audience. According to Colin Purrington, photographer and blogger,\n\"Research shows that people who are standing are more engaged listeners than people sitting in chairs.\" Audiences can\nalso view your poster when you aren't present.\nWhat is a conference poster?\nAn academic poster is generally a large paper mounted on the wall with a short engaging title, a prompt to your\nresearch question, a little about your research findings, and a short list of published research from experts in the field all\npresented in a visual graphical format, bright colors, and limited text. Your academic poster should invite an interested\naudience to come over and learn more.\nWhat are the academic poster requirements?\nMost academic posters are approximately 3'x4', professionally printed, and organized into columns (usually 3 or 4) and\nsections or boxes to help readers quickly access research information. Posters usually have a banner heading\ncontaining the poster title, the presenters/researchers name or names and the sponsoring body or\ninstitution/school. Blogger Colin Purrington shares some templates to make this process easier.\n377 Design Choices\nWhat template or software did you use to create your poster? Why?\nHow do I avoid making common poster mistakes?\n1. Avoid wordiness. Try to limit text to 1000 words or less.\n2. Maintain adequate white space or negative space. Avoid making your poster look crowded.\n3. Use a sans-serif font for titles and headings and use a serif font for text (see Chapter 6 Design).\n4. Use list format when appropriate\u2014avoid large blocks of text.\n5. Use italics or bold, rather than underline, for emphasis. Underline is generally reserved for hyperlinks.\n\u0000. Use consistent single spacing.\n7. Avoid hyphenating words.\n\u0000. Use consistent contrast. Avoid dark or bright or busy backgrounds behind black text.\n9. Avoid crazy color schemes. make your color palette pleasing and appropriate for your research topic.\n10. Label graphic elements figure 1, figure 2, and so forth. Give your graphics titles and captions. Provide the source for\nany graphics and visuals you don't create yourself.\n11. Use graphics and pictures. Visual elements draw and inform viewers more than text alone.\n12. Make sure viewers can see and read text and visuals comfortably from 3-6 feet away.\n13. Format references in the correct format for your field and position the references section at the bottom or bottom\nright on your poster.\n14. Have a colleague proof your poster.\n15. Don't plagiarize.\n378 https://health.mil/News/Articles/2019/02/11/Call-for-abstracts-open-for-2019-Military-Health-System-Research-\nSymposium?type=Technical+Documents (licensed for reuse)\nHow do I present a poster?\n1. At most academic poster sessions you stand next to your poster and guide the reader through it; but, it should be\ndesigned so that a viewer can understand your research if you aren't there.\n2. Give viewers a SHORT 3-4 minute well-rehearsed overview of your poster and your research and then invite\nquestions. The value of a poster session is that it is interactive.\n3. Dress Professionally. Avoid chewing gum and keep your hands out of your pockets.\n4. Maintain comfortable eye contact.\n5. Thank viewers for visiting.\nSteven M. Block of Princeton University warns, \"Remember that when it comes to posters, style, format, color,\nreadability, attractiveness, and showmanship all count. Take the time to get things right.\"\nPoster Design Revolution\nOne last note is that there's a grass-roots revolution going on in academic poster design led by Mike Morrison who was\na frustrated PhD student who spent a year researching better poster design ideas to try to improve the cluttered, text-\nheavy conference posters that made conference sessions overwhelming and exhausting. He provides clean, easy-to-\nlook-at templates for his \"better design[ed]\" posters and explains and why's and how's in this 20-minute video. You don't\nhave to watch it, but it's backed by good psychological research and represents a current trend that could make your\nposter much more likely to be noticed and read.\n379 17.6 The Concluding Conclusion\nCommunicating to others is one of our most human traits, and now you know how to best present your ideas to other\nhumans. If you remember to analyze your audience, keep yourself organized, use smart design, and act professionally,\nyour presentation will be listened to and make a difference.\nWe've reached the end of our journey together in this chapter and this book.

May include a list of keywords to aid database searching.\nAcademic Audiences\nAudiences whose focus is on scholarly research, logical arguments, convincing evidence, and a formal style.\nAnnotate\nWrite notes on, summarize, and/or evaluate a source such as an article or book.\nAnnotated Bibliography\nA document that lists the bibliographic information for each source on a topic and also includes a summary and/or\nanalysis of each source.\nAppendix\nExtra pages at the end of a paper for anything that is too big or complicated to be contained inside the paper such as\nTables, Figures, and Data.\nArgumentative Thesis Statement\nA sentence that sums up the crux of a typical research paper where the author makes an argument such as proposing a\nnew way to look at something or a change they'd like to see in the future.\nAssumptions\nAn assumption is a value or belief that connects the claim and the reasons given to support that claim. Sometimes\nthese are unspoken and subtle, other times we need to be explicit about them and perhaps even persuade our audience\nto accept the assumptions that underlie our argument.\n383 Audience\nThe audience is the group of people to whom you intend to address your message. The better you know them and their\nvalues, the more effectively you can make choices in your writing to persuade or inform them.\nBody\nThe body of the paper consists of all the inner paragraphs between the Introduction and Conclusion. The body is usually\ndivided into sections and is where all your points will go (including evidence and commentary).\nCharacter\nThe character of a speaker or writer describes how that author is perceived by an audience. Also known as authority or\nethos.\nClaim\nA claim is an assertion you make, something you propose to be true. We use reasons (or evidence) to support our\nclaims and convince or persuade others to change their views or feelings to match what we assert in our claim.\nCommentary\nCommentary means a writer's comments in a paper (as opposed to the claims, evidence, etc.). It usually involves\nanalysis or interpretation and can also include opinion or explanation depending on the type of paper.\nCommon Knowledge\nKnowledge that's generally agreed upon. This usually refers to things an average, educated audience would know like\nthat water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. This also refers to knowledge agreed upon by members of a certain group or\nfield. For example, Agency Theory is a theory acknowledged in the field of economics. Things considered Common\nKnowledge do not have to be cited but you have to remember who your audience is. Agency Theory would not have to\nbe cited for an audience of economists who know the term but would have to be cited for a general audience.\nConclusion\nThe Conclusion section of a paper comes at the end and usually sums up your main points, restates your position\n(thesis statement), and indicates the implications of your findings. Depending on the type of paper, you may also give\nrecommendations for future research. Also known as the Discussion section.\nContent-Exploration Outline\nThis type of outline involves idea-generating activities like brainstorming, mind mapping, grouping, and writing\nsentences and paragraphs. The point is to look for patterns and find the structure in your ideas but in a less formal\nmanner. You can even write a rough draft and then create a more formal outline in reverse that can then be revised. Also\nknown as an organic outline or an unstructured outline.\n384 Context\nContext is a catch-all term we use to describe all the factors that influence our writing, including the moment that\ninspires our writing, the timing with which we deliver our writing, and other external factors related to our writing.\nDiscourse Community\nA group with shared knowledge, values, characteristics, genres, languages, and/or style.\nDiscussion\nThe Discussion section of a paper comes at the end and usually sums up your main points, restates your position\n(thesis statement), and indicates the implications of your findings. Depending on the type of paper, you may also give\nrecommendations for future research. Also known as the Conclusion.\nEmpathy\nUnderstanding, being aware of, or even feeling the feelings or experiences of others.\nEvidence\nThis is a broad term that we might use to suggest all kinds of support for a claim, from scientific evidence to personal\nexperience to appeals to emotions and shared values. Also known as reasons or logos.\nExigence\nThe exigence is what prompts us to see change come about, and it inspires our decision to take up pen and paper (or\nset our fingers to the keyboard) and write.\nExpository Thesis Statement\nA statement that sums up the crux of a literature review (as opposed to an argumentative research paper) where the\nauthor exposes or announces their topic rather than taking a position or making an argument. It usually consists of two\nparts: main areas of inquiry about a topic and future research directions.\nFigure\nAny type of image, graph, or chart besides a table.\nGaps\nIn terms of research, gaps are the questions that haven't been answered or the areas where further research is needed.\nIn business, gaps are the niches in the marketplace that haven't yet been filled.\n385 General Audiences\nPeople who are not members of your field and who have general knowledge about topics but not specific knowledge,\nalso known as public audiences.\nGenre\nA genre is a kind or type or form or writing. It emerges from repeated situations in which we communicate in specific\nways. We also talk about how a genre has certain conventions: An audience expects a specific genre to do things in\nspecific ways (e.g., a letter will have a greeting and a farewell).\nGlobal Revision\nGlobal Revision in a paper is like looking at the foundation and framework of a house: the big ideas, the structure, the\nlogical order you put things, the headings and bigger transitions such as from section to section, etc. Global Revision\nshould generally come before Local Revision.\nGRAPE\nGRAPE is an acronym used in BYU's first-year writing classes to help you remember the main elements of the rhetorical\nsituation. The G stands for genre (the form or type of writing we choose to use in the situation); the R for rhetor (the\nspeaker or writer); the A for audience (to whom the speaker and writer is addressing their message); the P for purpose\n(what the rhetor or writer intends to accomplish with the message); and the E for exigence (the reason why this\nmessage needs to be given by this speaker to this audience at this moment).\nHedge\nHedging means adding conditional statements or qualifying a statement in order to allow for more possibilities. For\nexample, the statement \"All forests have pine trees\" means no exceptions are allowed. But if you say \"Most forests have\npine trees,\" it's okay if there are exceptions.\nIMRAD Format\nThe standard form for a research article consisting of Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion.\nIntroduction\nAn introduction is the first part of a paper where you introduce your topic, give background information, and usually\ndelineate your thesis and suggest the organization of the rest of your paper.\nJargon\nSpecialized language that is used by a specific group of people but is not understood by the general public.\n386 Literature Review\nA literature review is a review or synthesis of all the research published on a certain topic. It shows the \"state of the\nfield.\" A literature review can be part of the introduction of a bigger paper or can be a longer stand-alone document.\nLocal Revision\nLocal Revision in a paper is like looking at the finish work on a house: the style, formatting, sentence-to-sentence\ntransitions, grammar, language, etc. Local Revision should generally come after Global Revision.\nMessage\nThe message is, quite simply, what you have to say to other people through your writing or speaking. It's connected to\nour discussions about argument: The message often contains a claim support by reasons (and underpinned by\nimportant assumptions).\nMetacognition\nthe practice of monitoring and controlling your own process in order to improve; thinking about thinking\nMetacommentary\nMetacommentary is the words and phrases you use to comment on something you've written. Metacommentary helps\nwith interpretation, clarification, and elaboration. Transition words can act as metacommentary as can phrases such as\n\"In other words . . .\" and even whole paragraphs.\nMindful Writing Cycle\nA sequence of steps (plan, practice, revise, reflect) used when completing a writing task that improve performance and\nmetacognitive abilities\nMindfulness\nThe state of being deliberate in how you approach writing tasks, using metacognition and a mindful writing cycle\nOrganization-Only Outline\nA typical outline that organizes a paper into sections and subsections, often using Roman numerals and letters to\nindicate levels. Also known as a formal outline or a structured outline.\nPassive Voice\nA sentence structure that emphasizes the object rather than the subject of a sentence, i.e., the subject is acted upon\nrather than doing the action. The passive voice is appropriate when the subject is unknown or less important than the\nobject. Otherwise, try to use active voice as much as possible.\n387 Peer Review Process\nThe process whereby an article, book, or other piece of writing is formally evaluated by qualified scholars in the same\nfield as the author. These reviewers evaluate the quality of the research and determine whether or not to recommend\nthe work for publication. Peer review can also be done less formally with less formal writing as between classmates.\nPlan\nAssessing the writing task and setting goals\nPractice\nUsing strategies to generate content, draft, and receive feedback from peers and instructors\nPresentation\nAn address given verbally to a public audience, often with visual aids. Also known as an oral presentation.\nPrimary Research\nResearch you conduct yourself such as surveys, experiments, or observations (as opposed to secondary research\ninvolving the analysis of existing sources).\nPublic Audiences\nPeople who are not members of your field and who have general knowledge about topics but not specific knowledge,\nalso known as general audiences.\nPurpose\nPurpose is the driving reason why we're writing. It's what we hope to accomplish by writing to this audience.\nReasons\nThis is a broad term that we might use to suggest all kinds of support for a claim, from scientific evidence to personal\nexperience to appeals to emotions and shared values. Also known as evidence or logos.\nReferences\nThe References section is where you provide all the information necessary about your sources such as authors' names,\nyear, title, publisher, etc. These are usually in alphabetical order and should follow the format of your chosen style guide.\nReflect\nLooking back on a completed writing task to see what you've learned and what needs to change\n388 Revise\nMaking mindful changes to a draft after receiving feedback.\nRhetoric\nAt its most basic level, rhetoric is the study of how we communicate effectively with people. It encompasses a study of\nthe tools we might use as well as the way the context of our communication may impact the way we use those tools.\nRhetorical Situation\nWe use the term rhetorical situation to describe the context in which you engage an audience through writing or\nspeaking.

We analyze a rhetorical situation in order to guide our decision-making as we\ncompose a written or spoken message.\nRhetorical Triangle\nAn image that describes a rhetorical situation where the three connected points of the triangle are the Writer, the Speak,\nand the Message. These surround a purpose and exist inside the context or the situation.\nRunning Head\nA shortened version of a paper's title that runs across the top of the pages of a manuscript. According to the new APA\nManual (2019), this is no longer needed in student papers.\nSecondary Research\nResearch involving the analysis of existing sources (as opposed to primary research that you conduct yourself). Most\nundergraduate research papers are based on secondary research.\nShibboleth\nA word, phrase, custom, or other indicator that someone is part of a particular group. It can also refer to jargon in a\ndiscipline. From Judges 12:5-6.\nStyle\nStyle in writing is the manner in which we communicate. It involves how we structure sentences, which words we\nchoose, and other sentence-level choices that support the content of our message.\nTable\nA box with horizontal and vertical cells used to organize data.\n389 Thesis Statement\nThe main point of a paper summed up as a brief statement. In a typical Research Paper, it's usually an argumentative\nthesis statement while in a Literature Review, it's usually an expository thesis statement\nThird Person\nWriting from the perspective of he/she/it/they rather than first person (I/we) or second person (you).\nTransitions\nTransitions are words or phrases that help link ideas together. Transitions can be one word, one sentence, or a whole\nparagraph.\nWriter\nThe writer is you--the person composing the message. But don't be complacent and think you don't need to think\ncritically about who you are as a writer. We should consider our own emotions, our biases and preferences, and our\nrelationship with the audience when we consider our role as writers.\nThis content is provided to you freely by BYU Open Textbook Network.\nAccess it online or download it at https://open.byu.edu/writing/glossary.\n390"
