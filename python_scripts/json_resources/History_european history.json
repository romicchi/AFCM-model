This period began with a demographic\ndownturn at the end of the Roman imperial era, with European populations shrinking and\nmany cities and rural estates abandoned. A cooling climate, disease, and political disorder\neach played a part in this opening period which saw Classical Mediterranean civilization\neclipsed. Across Europe, there emerged smaller, more localized hybrid societies combin-\ning Roman, Christian and Germanic or Celtic barbarian influences. By the 9th and 10th\ncenturies, populations had reached their minima, and Europe became a largely rural and\nsomewhat backward region. Commerce and learning flourished in the Islamic world, China\nand India during this the same period. Islamic armies conquered Spain during the 7th and\n8th centuries, but were defeated by the Frankish kingdom in 732 when they attempted to\nenter France.\nThe turn of the first millennium saw renewed growth and activity, as kings and cities\nconsolidated their authority and began to repopulate lands left empty by Rome\u2019s decline.\nWarmer weather after 900 allowed more land to be brought into food production. The\nfeudal system of agriculture, where peasants were tied to their estates by obligations to\nlocal lords or to the church, provided a degree of economic stability. This was aided by\nthe arrival in Europe of the horse collar from Asia, which increased crop yields by allowing\nplows to be drawn by horse, rather than by slower oxen. Commercial towns flourished in\nEngland, France and the Low Countries. German rulers dispatched monks and peasants\nto clear forests and settle in Eastern Europe and the Baltic regions. The city-states of\nnorthern Italy rose in wealth and influence. Islamic Spain became a center of learning and\nculture where Christians, Muslims and Jews coexisted in relative amity. Despite many local\nwars and disputes between knights, the High Middle Ages, from 1000-1250, saw growing\npopulations and prosperity enough to build great cathedrals and send European armies\nabroad on crusades.\nAfter 1250, demographic stagnation emerged. Population growth slowed or stopped as the\nlimits of medieval agriculture were reached. Major conflicts between powerful kingdoms,\nsuch as the Hundred Years\u2019 War between England and France, became more frequent. The\nChristian church, previously secure in its spiritual authority, was racked by schisms and\nincreasing financial corruption. The year 1348 saw a catastrophe as the virulent bubonic\nplague (the \u201dBlack Death\u201d), entered Italy, carried by ships from Asia. It spread across the\ncontinent over three years killing, by some estimates, one-third of all Europeans. Many\nbelieved it was the end of the world foretold by Christian myth. Along with its suffering,\n3 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\nthe plague wrought economic havoc, driving up the cost of labor and making the old feudal\nsystem untenable, as surviving peasants scorned its demands.\nThe following century and a half transformed Europe from a patchwork of feudal fiefdoms,\nunder loose royal and church control, into a collection of newborn but increasingly unified\nnational states. Towns became centers of resistance and dissent to the old royal and church\nauthorities. Former noble and knightly influence declined, and rulers realigned themselves\ntowardtheincreasinglywealthyandinfluentialburgherandmerchantclasses. Emergenceof\nthe printing press and spreading literacy, increased religious and political conflict in many\ncountries. By 1500, Christopher Columbus had sailed across the ocean to the New World,\nandMartinLutherwasabouttotakemuchofEuropeoutoftheorbitoftheRomanchurch.\nThesedevelopmentsopenedthemoderneraofhistory,andbroughttheMiddleAgestotheir\ntrue end.\nAnumberofmoderninstitutionshavetheirrootsintheMiddleAges. Theconceptofnation-\nstates with strong central governmental power stems from the consolidation of powers by\nsome kings of the Middle Ages. These kings formed royal courts, appointed sheriffs, formed\nroyal armies, and began to collect taxes - all concepts central to modern government. A\nleading example was the French kingdom, ruled by the Capetian dynasty from 987 until\nthe early 14th century. French provincial nobles and their castles and knights were brought\nunder effective royal control during this time, and national unity benefited. Conversely\nGermany, which had strong kings in the 10th and early 11th centuries, suffered a series\nof political conflicts during the High Middle Ages between rulers and the Church, which\nweakened national cohesion and elevated regional lords to great influence.\nDuring the Middle Ages, Kings originally called Parliaments to explain their policies and\nask for money. Parliaments at this time represented the three collective estates - the clergy,\nnobles, and merchants - not individuals.\nThe idea of limited government also arose, challenging the traditional notion at the time\nthat rulers were all-powerful (such as a Roman emperor or an Egyptian pharaoh). The\nmost substantial occurrence was in 1215, when the nobles of England asserted their rights\nagainstKingJohnintheMagna Carta. Inaddition, thenotionofparliaments, asexplained\nabove, came into existence, and the reciprocal nature of the feudal and manorial contracts\nlaid the most basic groundwork for the concept of the social contract.\nInaddition, theformationofgovernmentalbureaucracybeganduringthistime, astheroyal\ncouncils of medieval kings evolved into modern government departments.\nFinally, the regulation of goods and services became increasingly prominent during the\nMiddle Ages, as guilds protected the consumer from poor products.\nThinkers of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment tended to look at the Middle Ages with\nscorn, but the Middle Ages were essential in laying the groundwork for the times to come.\n4 New Forms of Art\n1.2 New Forms of Art\nBoth painting and literature received a new burst of life as the Early Middle Ages1 came\nto an end.\n1.2.1 Painting\nGiotto2 began to express the Human3 form more realistically. Although his forms seem\nprimitive compared to those of the Renaissance artists, he was the first to attempt to bring\nback the realism of Roman4 art. He also began to develop techniques of perspective in\npaintings to achieve depth. Most of his art was in the form of plaster-based frescoes on the\nwalls of chapels and churches.\n1.2.2 Literature\nAs the prestige of the Papacy began to decline, national consciousness began to increase;\nthis nationalism was manifested in literature written in national languages, or vernacular5,\ninstead of traditional Latin6. This use of the vernacular opened up such that cultural\npeculiaritiescouldbemorenaturallyexpressed. Thisallowedliteraturetofeelmorerealistic\nand human to the readers, and is why pieces such as The Canterbury Tales7 are considered\ndepictions of life in the times in which they were written.\nWhiletheliteracyoflaypeopleincreasedasaresultofincreasedvernacularwritings, society\nwas still largely based on oral culture8.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early%20Middle%20Ages\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vernacular\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Canterbury%20Tales\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oral%20culture\n5 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\nDante Alighieri (1265-1321)\nFigure 1 Dante Alighieri - detail from Luca Signorelli\u2019s fresco, Chapel of San Brizio,\nOrvieto Cathedral (1499-1502)\nI am the way to the dolent city\nI am the way to eternal sorrow\nI am the way to a forsaken people\nAbandon all hope ye who enter here.\n-- Canto III, Inferno\n6 New Forms of Art\nDante Aligheri9 was born in 1265 in Florence10, Italy11. His family was not rich but was\nconsidered an aristocratic line. He was taught by Brunetto Latini12, who trained him in\nthe classical liberal arts, including Latin13 and Greek14. Yet, Dante set out to embrace his\nvernacular language and began to write The Divine Comedy15 in his local Tuscan dialect.\nToday he holds a place in history as the first author to do so. Alighieri considered his\nwork a comedy16 due to the differences between his Italian writing style and the great Latin\ntragedy17. Histhree-partepicpoem18 sarcasticallycriticizedtheChurchandcommentedon\na variety of historical and contemporary individuals. The most important of these figures is\nVirgil19, the Latin poet, who plays the role of Dante\u2019s guide through the afterlife20. Dante\u2019s\npersonal feelings towards many people are also evident in his writing. In the deepest layer\nof hell he punishes those for whom he personally had the greatest disdain. Much of this\npersonal disdain came from his position as a politician in Florence. One of the victims of\nhis deepest layer of hell is Boniface VIII21, a pope whose political policy of expansion he\nopposed. Each of the poem\u2019s parts portray degrees of salvation, with \u201dInferno\u201d being Hell,\n\u201dPurgatorio\u201d being Purgatory, and \u201dParadiso\u201d being Heaven. Inferno includes many of the\narchetype22 depictions of hell including the River Styx23, and the ferry man Charon who\ncarries people across the river.\nGeoffrey Chaucer (1340-1400)\nChaucer24\u2019s The Canterbury Tales25 , a collection of stories, exposed the materialistic,\nworldly interests of a variety of English people.

In particular, the\nnationsfoughtovercontrolof theGasconyregion inFrance, rebellionssupported byBritain\nin French cloth production towns, and English claims to the French throne after the death\nof Charles IV.\nThe war, initially sparked by a dispute over who would become King of France after the\ndeath of King Charles IV, quickly became an amazingly complex and multi-faceted war.\nKing Edward III and his son Edward, commonly known as \u201dThe Black Prince\u201d, invaded\nAquitaine, a huge region in southwest France claimed by England. As time went on, the\nKings of England and France involved themselves in many more operations, ranging from\na civil war in Brittany, trade disputes in what became Belgium, even a war in Castile.\nThe three major battles of the Hundred Years War, Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, were\nresounding English victories, the flower of French nobility being cut down at every battle.\nHowever, even though the English won every major battle and many of the smaller ones,\nrelatively poor England was never able to subdue southern France, by far the wealthiest\nportion of France, which eventually led to the English losing the war.\n1.4 The Rise of Towns and Commerce\nFrom the 6th to 10th centuries, there were few commerce centers and only small merchant\nclasses in Europe. What long-distance trade there was usually focused on luxury goods for\nthe nobility and church elites, and was mediated by traveling merchants such as Syrians\nor Jews. Crafts were carried on locally in manors. Populations were not large enough to\nsupport further economic developments, and Viking and Arab attacks made trade routes\nhazardous.\nDuring the High Middle Ages of 1000-1500, long distance trading became safer and thus\nmore profitable. As a result, craftsmen moved into growing centers of trade, forcing lords\nand serfs to have to get their goods from these centers of trade. Towns formed leagues\nand urban federations31, or communes, that worked together to fight crime or deal with\nmonarchs and nobles. Guilds also arose, allowing for the collective supervision of affairs\n- the work was done by reliable people, and the guilds provided for vocational education.\nThe spirit of the medieval economy, however, was to prevent competition.\nThe rise of towns had an emancipating effect. They forced the lords to offer freer terms\nto the peasantry. Often, peasants earned freedom in return for an annual payment to the\nlord. Allowing large numbers of people to move from agricultural to industrial work in the\ntownsbroughteconomicacceleration. Indeed, asortofhandicraftindustrialrevolutiontook\nplaceduringthe12thand13thcenturies, especiallyintheLowCountrieswheregreatcloth-\nmaking centers such as Ghent and Bruges accumulated much wealth and stimulated growth\nin Western Europe generally. The Hansa, a widespread league of North Sea, Norwegian and\nBaltic trading towns, emerged in this period, opening up Scandinavian resources to supply\nWestern Europe with furs, timber, beeswax, and fish.\n31 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/urban%20federation\n9 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\nThe High Middle Ages also saw Europeans returning from Crusades in the Middle East,\nwheretheyhaddevelopedtastesforgoodsnotproducedathome. Thesehomecomingsintro-\nduced medieval Europeans to exotic spices, silks, fruits, drugs, and other eastern products\nfor the first time. Cities around the Mediterranean took part in the trade that developed,\nwith Venice becoming the richest port of entry for Asian goods, the base from which Marco\nPolo and his companions set forth on their journey to China.\n1.5 Growth of National Monarchies\nDuring this same time period, the monarchies began to grow, and as a result people began\nto see the formation of unified nation-states. Kings sent executive orders and began to\ninstitute royal courts, and they lived off of money from the manors that they owned and\nfees from their vassals. The king\u2019s royal council was a group of his vassals that advised him\nonstatematters,whichresultedintheformationofbasicdepartmentsofgovernment. When\nrepresentatives of towns began to meet, this was an early formation of basic parliaments.\nThese parliaments didn\u2019t have the ability to dictate to the king, but could state grievances\nand the king could act upon them. This was a basic sort of legislation.\nInaddition, theformationoftheseparliamentsledtotheestablishmentofthethreeestates:\nthe first estate, which was encompassed by the clergy; the second estate, made up of the\nlanded and noble class; and the third estate, or the burghers of chartered towns. England\nhad two houses of parliament - the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House\nof Commons allowed lesser landholders to become members.\n10 The Black Death\n1.6 The Black Death\nFigure 3 Spread of the Black Death in Europe.\nBlack Death, or Bubonic Plague, hit Europe in 1347. Transmitted primarily by fleas and\nrats, the bacteria Y. Pestis swept across the continent, killing one third of the population\nby 1351. The bacteria is thought to have been endemic among rodent populations on the\nAsian steppes, and jumped to humans in Europe with great virulence. The onset of the\ndisease was sudden; the symptoms were fever, weakness, delirium, lung distress, and dark-\ncolored swellings (buboes) in the neck, armpit and groin areas. Quite often, those infected\ndied within 1-2 days, including young and previously healthy individuals.\n1.6.1 Causes of the Plague\nThe revival of trade and commerce increased the potential for the spread of communicable\ndiseases. Europe had not suffered a continent wide plague since the plague of Justinian in\n535, and the unexposed populations of 1348 had no inherited immunity. Though prosperity\nhadrisen,nutritionandsanitationformostEuropeanswereverypoorbymodernstandards,\ndecreasing immune resistance in general. Many adults had also suffered as young children\nin the Great Famine of 1316-1321, when several years of cold and wet weather caused crops\nto fail across the continent. This experience in childhood may also have compromised their\nresistance to the plague bacillus in later life.\nThe plague is thought to have been brought to Europe during a Mongol attack on Kaffa (in\nthe Black Sea); when sickness forced the Mongols to abandon their attack, they catapulted\n11 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\na few plague victims into town before leaving. Ironically, this became a common practice\nfor Europeans in castle siege. From there, merchants spread the disease to Constantino-\nple, where it propagated throughout Europe, first by ship to Mediterranean ports such as\nMessina and Genoa, and then by land in all directions.\nA shortage of wood fuel, due to cutting of forests for agriculture, resulted in the shutting\ndownofbathhouseswhichreliedonburningwoodtoheatthewater. Particularlyinwinter,\nonly the rich could afford to bathe. This further contributed to poor hygienic conditions.\nCities were also very poorly designed for hygiene. Citizens commonly dumped waste into\nthe street which attracted rats, and thus fleas. Living in cities was also very close, which\nmeant that fleas had little area to travel to infect another person.\nThe plague was blamed on many things in particular the Jews were a common scapegoat\nfor the plague, including city leaders claiming that members of the Jewish community had\npoisoned the water supply, or spread a poisonous salve on the gates of the city.\nIt is important to understand that Europeans did not understand the real cause of the\nplague. To them the plague was a curse brought on them by their lack of piety, or the\nfailings of the church, the cities\u2019 Jewish population, or even the configuration of the stars.\nOthers even attributed the plague to bad air. To combat it, they carried kerchiefs or bags\nof \u201daromatics\u201d that they could hold to their noses as needed. (The opinion of Europe\u2019s\nleading medical faculty, at the University of Paris, was that the outbreak was brought on\nby an unfavorable astrological alignment in the year 1345). Lacking the real facts, many\nEuropeans\u2019 attempts to quell the disease actually helped it spread.\n1.6.2 Responses to the Plague\nSome people thought the plague was punishment by God against sinners. The flagellants32\naroseasaresult. Flagellantswhippedthemselvestobleed,prayedformercy,andcalledupon\ntheir congregations to repent sins. Wandering over plague-stricken central Europe, many\ngroups of flagellants turned to banditry and violence. Towns and feudal lords eventually\nprohibited them or even tried to wipe them out. In addition, violence against Jews broke\nout, and mobs killed all who refused baptism. Many Jews were forced to flee their homes.\nPhysiciansinmedievalEuropeusedamixtureoftrial-and-errormethodsandclassicalGreek\nor Roman sources to care for their patients. Without knowledge of microorganisms, or the\nrole of rats and fleas in spreading the infection, doctors were unable to cure infected victims\nor limit the spread. As a result, plague sufferers survived or perished according to the\ngeneral state of their health, and whatever genetic resistance they happened to possess.\n1.6.3 Consequences of the Plague\nMassive death opened the ranks for advancement in society, and as a result landlords made\nmoreconcessionstoobtainnewtenantfarmers.

Peasants and artisans now had more luxuries and a\nbetter diet, and production shifted from manufacturing for a mass market to a small luxury\nmarket. However, the monetary disparity grew, as fewer people possessed proportionately\ngreater money.\nFinally, Europeans saw that the church\u2019s prayer did not cure the plague, and that even\nleaders of the church were dying. This caused the general populace to lose a great deal\nof faith in the church, and opened the door to many new and local religious movements\nwhich had previously been suppressed, a factor which helped prepare the coming of the\nReformation a century later.\n1.7 Challenges to Spiritual Authority at the End of the\nMiddle Ages\nTheMiddleAgesprovidedmanyfoundationstotheReformationofthe16thcentury. During\nthe time, the church provided order, stability, and a framework for the medieval world. The\nmost essential foundation of medieval life was salvation - and the ultimate life goal of all\npeople was to obtain salvation. As people lost faith in the church and its ability to provide\nsalvation, the church began to lose its hold on the populace.\n1.7.1 Plague\nAs explained earlier, the plague contributed to the people\u2019s loss of faith in the church.\nHowever, some more ardent believers would have regarded such a plague as being sent from\nGod to punish the world for its sins. The church of the day would have played upon such\na notion so as to encourage more ardent belief and to attack any dissenters.\n1.7.2 Heretical Movements and People\nA number of movements and people challenged the authority of the church during the end\nof the Middle Ages.\nFree Spirits\nThe free spirits believed the church was not meeting the spiritual needs of the people, and\nadvocated mysticism33, or the belief that God and humans are of the same essence.\n33 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mysticism\n13 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\nJohn Wycliffe (1328\u20131384)\nJohn Wycliffe, an English priest and professor at Oxford, founded the Lollard movement.\nThe Lollards argued that salvation didn\u2019t have to come through the pope, and that the\nking was superior to and more important than the pope and religion. He said that Bible\nreading and prayer were important to religion, not the interpretation by priests. He was\none of the first to set out to translate the Bible into a vernacular34 language rather than\nusing the Latin Vulgate35. He also objected to the extreme wealth of the church and clergy.\nJan Hus (1369-1415) in Bohemia\nJanHus36,byformingtheHussites37,attemptedtobringaboutreformslikethoseattempted\nbyWycliffinEngland. HuswasapriestinBohemia38 whenhelearnedofWycliff\u2019steachings.\nWhile the people around him thought them heretical and forbade them, Jan thought they\nhad a right to be taught. Through his various disagreements and dealings, Hus came to\nthink the church corrupt, and left his native land to pen On the Church39 , a work which\ncriticized the manner in which it was run. His teachings appealed to the masses, and he\ndeveloped a group of followers known as Hussites40. In 1413, Hus was invited to a council\ndesigned to reform the church, but when he arrived he was arrested for his views. The\nfollowing trial was in many ways just a formality, as he was guilty the moment he stepped\nin. Hus was burned at the stake on July 6, 1415.\n1.7.3 Corruption in the Church\nThe vast corruption in the church also led many to doubt and question its authority. The\nexcess wealth of clergy and the frequency of clergymen having mistresses and illegitimate\nchildren was a major concern. The people also questioned the church\u2019s sale of indulgences,\nor receiving payment to forgive people of their sins; nepotism; simony, or the sale of church\noffice; pluralism, or holding multiple church offices; and the extreme luxury of cathedrals.\n34 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vernacular\n35 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin%20Vulgate\n36 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan%20Hus\n37 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussites\n38 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemia\n39 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On%20the%20Church\n40 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussites\n14 Challenges to Spiritual Authority at the End of the Middle Ages\n1.7.4 The Great Schism\nFigure 4 Allegiances during the Great Schism of 1378.\nIn 1305, the King of France invited the Pope to move the headquarters of the Church away\nfrom Rome, a city plagued by warring local factions, to Avignon in the Rhone Valley. After\nPope Gregory XI\u2019s return of the papacy to Rome in 1377, elections were convened for a\nnew Pope. The citizens of Rome, demanding the election of an Italian Pope, forced the\nCardinals to elect Urban VI. Dissenting French Cardinals reconvened in Avignon and on\ntheir own elected their own pope, Clement VII. The French popes of the Great Schism,\nreferred to by historians as antipopes , held papal power in some regions of Europe, and for\n39 years there were two Popes. In an attempt to reconcile this Schism, Conciliarists held\na conference at Pisa to elect a new Pope, but could not depose either of the two in power,\nresulting in a threefold split in the papacy. Not willing to give up, the Pisan convention\nelected yet another Pope, to the same result.\nFinally the Council of Constance (1414-1418) stepped in and called for the abdication of\nthe three popes in power. With the support of the Holy Roman Emperor, the three popes\nwere deposed and Martin V was elected as a single pope, ending the Great Schism. The\nCouncil of Constance also took action against John Wycliffe and John Huss, two reformers\nwithin the Catholic Church.\n15 Chapter 01 - The Crises of the Middle Ages\npt:Hist\u00f3ria da Europa/Crises da Idade M\u00e9dia41 vi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Cu\u1ed9c kh\u1ee7ng ho\u1ea3ng c\u1ee7a\ngiai \u0111o\u1ea1n cu\u1ed1i Trung C\u1ed542\nhttp://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria%20da%20Europa%2FCrises%20da%20Idade%20M%\n41\nC3%A9dia\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FCu%E1%\n42 BB%99c%20kh%E1%BB%A7ng%20ho%E1%BA%A3ng%20c%E1%BB%A7a%20giai%20%C4%91o%E1%BA%A1n%20cu%\nE1%BB%91i%20Trung%20C%E1%BB%95\n16 2 Chapter 02 - Renaissance Europe\n2.1 Introduction\nFigure 5 Vitruvian Man by\nLeonardo Da Vinci\nThe Italian Renaissance of the 13th and 14th centuries spread through the rest of Europe,\nrepresenting a time when Europe sought knowledge from the ancient world and moved out\nof the Dark Ages. A renewed interest in science and experimentation, and a focus on the\nimportance of living well in the present as opposed to the afterlife as promoted by the\nChurch. The Renaissance brought on an explosion in art, poetry, and architecture. New\ntechniques and styles developed as these art forms moved away from the colder and darker\nstyles of the Middle Ages. This period, in this view, represents Europe emerging from a\nlongperiodofbackwardnessandtheriseoftradeandexploration. TheItalianRenaissance1\nis often labeled as the beginning of the \u201dmodern\u201d epoch.\nHowever, it is important to recognize the countless modern institutions that did have their\nroots in the Middle Ages2, such as nation-states, parliaments, limited government, bureau-\ncracies, and regulation of goods and services.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian%20Renaissance\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle%20Ages\n17 Chapter 02 - Renaissance Europe\n2.2 Origins\nInthewakeoftheBlackDeath3,whichdecreasedinincidencein1351,faithinthepowerand\nsignificance of the church declined. The multitude of deaths (approximately 25-30 million\nbetween 1347 and 1351) signaled the need for a revival in art, education, and society in\ngeneral. A large decrease in workers led to demands for higher wages, and thus uprisings\nwere staged in several countries throughout Europe, particularly Germany, France, and\nItaly.\nThe Renaissance began in northern Italy in the early 1300s. Although it was not inevitable,\nseveralfactors\u2014nationalism(duetoanincreasedprideinthedaysofearlyRome), theCru-\nsades4, revivalof trade\u2014helped to bringabout reform. Throughout Italy(Florence, Genoa,\nRome, Naples, and Milan in particular) scholars revived their studies of early Greek and\nLatin literature, derived from archived manuscripts. Upon examining these early works,\nthey realized that culture was essential to living a meaningful life, and education (especially\nhistory) was important in understanding both the world of yesterday and contemporary\ntimes, as well as gaining insight into the future. Thus, Italian scholars called for a \u2019Renais-\nsance\u2019 (French for rebirth) in European education and culture.\n2.3 Social Order and Cultural Change\n2.3.1 Florentine Social Divisions\nThe denizens of Florence fell into one of four main social classes. These included the grandi\n(the great), the rulers of the city; the popolo grosso (big people), the capitalist merchants\n(these challenged the grandi for power); the smaller businesspeople, and the popolo minuto\n(little people), the lower economic classes, such as the paupers, who, despite constituting a\nthird of the Florentine population, had no wealth at all.5\nThis division of society was prone to conflict, and eventually resulted in the successful\nCiompi Revolt6 of 1378. The Ciompi Revolt was that of the poor, who revolted because of\nthe constant feuds between the grandi and the popolo grosso , the anarchy from the Black\nDeath, andthecollapseofbanks, whichmadethepopolo minutoevenpoorer. Afterawhile,\nthe Ciompi Revolt led to a four-year reign by the popolo minuto until Cosimo de\u2019 Medici\ncame into power in 1434 and restored the stability of Florence.\n2.3.2 The Household\nThe plague resulted in more favorable working positions for women, although the overall\nparticipation of women in public life varied with class as well as region. Married couples\nworked together frequently, and most men and women remarried quickly if their spouse\ndied.\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%20Death\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades\n5 Kagan,Donaltetal.

Women\nwerefeaturedprominentlyintheunderclass,andmanypoorwomenfoundprostitutiontheir\nonly option. Male violence forced women into prostitution as well, as rape resulted in the\nstripping of a woman\u2019s social respectability and prospects for marriage.\n2.3.4 Hard Times for Business\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War7 resulted in the various governments in Europe borrowing a great\ndeal of money that they could not pay back. Thus, merchants were less likely to take risks,\nand instead invested in government bonds. The result of this was an overall decrease in\ntrade.\n2.4 The Birth of Humanism\nFigure 6 Pico della Mirandola ,\n1463-1494, one of the most famous\nhumanists of the Renaissance. By an\nunknown artist, in the Uffizi, Florence.\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred%20Years%27%20War\n19 Chapter 02 - Renaissance Europe\nAt the time, Italy was the center of culture in Europe. Middle class writers were supported\nby noble patronage, and as a result, during the beginning of the Renaissance literature\nblossomed alongside classic revival. This resulted in the rise of humanism, an intellectual\nmovementthatadvocatedthestudyofhistoryandliteratureasthechiefmeansofidentifying\nwith the glories of the ancient world. Humanism advocated classical learning and active\nparticipation of the individual in civic affairs.\nRenaissance scholars advocated the concept of \u201dreturning to the sources,\u201d attempting to\nreconcilethedisciplinesoftheChristianfaithwithancientlearning. Inaddition,theconcept\nof civic humanism8 arose, which advocated participation in government. Civilization was\ninspired by the writings of Roman emperors, and by the end of the 1400s intellectuals had\na command of the Latin language.\nIn the 1440s, Johannes Gutenberg9 created a printing press with movable type. This revo-\nlution in communication greatly assisted in the spread of Renaissance ideals throughout\nEurope, allowing the ideas to be printed for mass circulation, for the first time in history.\nGutenberg was the first European ever to create a printing press with a movable type,\nthough the Chinese had long before innovated this technology.\nThe Renaissance conception of life and man\u2019s role on earth was more secular than in the\npast, but in no way was it nonreligious. It was now believed that God holds people above\neverything else, and that the greatest thing about being human is the human\u2019s free will to\nchoose.

People believed\nthat life on Earth was intrinsically valuable, and that citizens should strive to be the best\nthat they can. The emphasis of the Renaissance was on the individual rather than the\ncollective.\n2.4.1 Italian Humanists\nFrancesco Petrarch10 (1304-1374) was an Italian scholar, poet, and early humanist. In\nhis sonnets, he created the image of real people with personality, debunking the typical\nMedieval conceptions and stereotypes of people.\nGiovanni Boccaccio11 (1313-1375) wrote The Decameron12 , a short story about the lives\nof people living during the Black Death. The book focused on people\u2019s responses to the\nplague rather than God\u2019s wrath. In this sense, the book was not about religion, but rather\nabout people, a relatively new concept at the time.\nPico della Mirandola13 (1463-1494) was an Italian Renaissance humanist philosopher and\nscholar. He authored the \u201dOration on the Dignity of Man,\u201d which has become known as\nthe \u201dManifesto of the Renaissance.\u201d In this, he explained that man has unlimited potential,\nand with his free will can be anything he wants to be.

Finally, he explained that people should live their\nlife with virtue, or the quality of being a man - shaping their own destiny, using all of their\nopportunities, and working aggressively through life.\n2.4.2 Northern Humanists\nSir Thomas More14 was an English lawyer, writer, and politician. He was a devout Catholic\nwho wrote Utopia15 , a novel that depicted Christian Humanist16 ideals producing an ideal\nfictional society. In his utopia, there was no crime, poverty, nor war. Much of the novel is\na conversation that criticizes European practices, especially capital punishment.\nDesiderius Erasmus17 was a Dutch humanist and theologian. He was also a Catholic. In\nhis Handbook of a Christian Knight , he argued that through education, society can be\nreformed in the pious Christian model. He believed faith, good works, and charity were the\ncore Christian values, and that elaborate ceremonies were superfluous. In his The Praise of\nFolly , Erasmus claimed that the true Christian table of virtues, namely modesty, humility,\nand simplicity, had been replaced by a different, perverted value system of opulence, power,\nwealth, and so on.\n2.5 Arts\nRenaissance art tended to focus on the human body with accurate proportions, and the\nmost common subjects of art were religion, mythology, portraits, and the use of classical\n(Greco-Roman) subjects. Artisans of the Renaissance used oil paint to add shadow and\nlight, and the use of the vanishing point18 in art became prominent during this time.\nArtists of the Renaissance depended on patronage, or financial support from the wealthy.\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%20More\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia%20%28book%29\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20Humanism\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderius%20Erasmus\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vanishing%20point\n21 Chapter 02 - Renaissance Europe\nFigure 7 da Vinci\u2019s Mona Lisa.\n2.5.1 Leonardo da Vinci (1452\u20131519)\nLeonardo da Vinci19 of Florence was known as one of the great masters of the High Renais-\nsance, as a result of his innovations in both art and science. Leonardo is often viewed as\nthe archetype of the \u201dRenaissance Man\u201d or \u201dpolymath\u201d because of his expertise and interest\nin many different areas, including art, science, music, mechanics, architecture and the arts\nof war and philosophy.\nLeonardo is best known for his paintings, the most famous of which are The Last Supper20\nandTheMonaLisa21.

He also left several important drawings of\nwhich the \u201dVitruvian Man\u201d is the most famous and probably the most reproduced drawing\nin the world. Leonardo left many note books of studies of many subjects, often profusely\nillustrated. Much of his work was intended for publication but only a small percentage of\nhis work was published, relating to art and mathematics.\nIn science, Leonardo practised meticulous observation and documentation. He dissected\nthirty corpses in order to study human anatomy and produced detailed drawings of the\nhuman skeletal, muscular, and internal organ systems including human fetuses. He made\ndiscoveries in anatomy, meteorology and geology, hydraulics, and aerodynamics. This led\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo%20da%20Vinci\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Last%20Supper\n21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona%20Lisa\n22 Arts\nto his devising of many ingenious plans, including an underwater diving suit and non-\nfunctioning flying machines. He also sketched plans for elaborate killing machines. Many\nof these projects have proved impossible to create.

While the Southern\nRenaissanceemphasizedartandculture, theNorthernRenaissanceemphasizedthesciences\nandnewtechnology. ThisfailedtooccurinthesouthprimarilybecausetheRomanCatholic\nChurch stunted learning and the sciences. While the Northern Renaissance was religiously\ndiverse, with the rise of Protestantism and a great deal of religious division, the Southern\nRenaissance was entirely Roman Catholic. The Southern Renaissance saw far fewer univer-\nsities, while the Northern Renaissance saw more universities and education. Also, Northern\nRenaissance humanists pushed for social reform based on Christian ideals.\n2.8 The New Monarchies\nWith the Renaissance came the rise of new monarchs. These new monarchs were kings who\ntook responsibility for the welfare of all of society. They centralized power and consolidated\nauthority - the kings now controlled tariffs, taxes, the army, many aspects of religion, and\nthe laws and judiciary.\nIn the way of the rise of new monarchs stood the church and nobles, who feared losing their\npower to the king. In addition, these new monarchs needed money, and they needed to\nestablish a competent military rather than mercenaries.\nThe middle class allied themselves with the new monarchs. The monarchs desired their\nsupport because their money came from trade, and this trade provided a great source\nof taxable revenue. The middle class supported the monarchs because they received the\nelimination of local tariffs, as well as peace and stability.\n2.8.1 France\nFrom the tenth century onwards France had been governed by the Capetian dynasty. Al-\nthough the family ruled over what might be, in theory, considered the most powerful coun-\ntry in Europe, the French monarchs had little control over their vassals, and many parts\nof France functioned as though they were independent states. The most powerful vassals\nof the French kings were the Plantagenet dynasty of England, who, through their Angevin\nancestry, ruled large parts of western France. The ensuing conflicts, known as the Hundred\nYears War, helped to solidify the power of the French monarchs over their country.\nIn France, the Valois dynasty31 came to the throne in 1328.\nCharles VII32 expelled the English and lowered the church\u2019s power under the state in 1422.\nLouis XI33 expanded the French state, laying the foundations for absolutism, in 1461.\n31 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valois%20Dynasty\n32 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20VII%20of%20France\n33 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis%20XI%20of%20France\n25 Chapter 02 - Renaissance Europe\n2.8.2 England\nEdward IV34 began the restoration of royal authority, but the strengthening of the crown\ngained momentum only after the Tudor family35 came to power.\nHenryVII36 manipulatedtheParliamenttomakeitatooloftheking. HecreatedtheRoyal\ncourt and the Star Chamber37, in which royalty had the power to torture while questioning;\nthis legal system allowed the king to limit the power of the aristocracy. He also promoted\ntrade in order to gain the support of the middle class.\nHis son, Henry VIII38, took this process still further when, as a result of his desire to have a\nmale heir, he founded the Anglican Church39 in England and broke away from the Catholic\nChurch40. After Henry married Catherine of Aragon41, she failed to produce a male heir,\nandHenrydesiredtodivorceherinordertomarryanewlady,AnneBoleyn42,whohehoped\nwould be able to produce a son. The Catholic Church strictly prohibited divorce, however,\nand Henry found that the only way to sever his marriage was to separate from the Pope\u2019s\njurisdiction. As a result, he withdrew England from the Catholic Church, establishing the\nChurch of England, and in the First Act of Supremacy43 he established the monarch of\nEngland as the head of the Church.\n2.8.3 Spain\nWith the success of the Spanish reconquista 44, Spain expelled the Jews and Muslims. The\nmarriage of Queen Isabella I of Castile45 and King Ferdinand II of Aragon46, the Catholic\nmonarchs (Spanish:Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos ), was the final element which unified Spain. They\nrevived the Spanish Inquisition47 to remove the last of the Jews.\n2.8.4 Holy Roman Empire\nIn the Holy Roman Empire48, which occupied Austria and Bohemia49, the Hapsburg Dy-\nnasty50 began.

The\ncourt became the center of politics and religion in their respective nations.\nNobles were required to live in the courts, and were as a result under constant watch by the\nking. Thus, themostimportantfunctionofthecourtwasthatitallowedthekingto control\nthe nobles and prevent coup. In addition, however, the courts served an important social\nfunction, as the king\u2019s social circle was the nobles, and the court allowed him to interact\nwith them.\nCourt life was incredibly lavish, with events including hunting, mock battles, balls, parties,\ndances, celebratory dinners, gambling, and general socialization. The middle class loved\nthis, and frequently copied the behaviors of the nobility from the courts.\n2.10 References\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Th\u1eddi k\u1ef3 Ph\u1ee5c H\u01b0ng55\n51 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor\n52 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman%20Turks\n53 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%20Empire\n54 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall%20of%20Constantinople\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FTh%E1%\n55\nBB%9Di%20k%E1%BB%B3%20Ph%E1%BB%A5c%20H%C6%B0ng\n27  3 Chapter 03 - Exploration and Discovery\n3.1 Introduction\nFigure 9 The Portuguese Empirea.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese%20Empire\nFigure 10 The Spanish Empirea.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%20Empire\nDuring the fifteenth and the sixteenth century the states of Europe began their modern\nexploration of the world with a series of sea voyages. The Atlantic states of Spain and\nPortugal were foremost in this enterprise though other countries, notably England and the\nNetherlands, also took part.\n29 Chapter 03 - Exploration and Discovery\nTheseexplorationsincreasedEuropeanknowledgeofthewiderworld,particularlyinrelation\ntosub-SaharanAfrica1 andtheAmericas2.

The earliestexplorations, round\nthecoastofWestAfrica3, weredesignedtobypassthetraderoutesthatbroughtgoldacross\ntheSaharaDesert4. TheimprovednavaltechniquesthatdevelopedthenallowedEuropeans\nto travel further afield, to India and, ultimately, to the Americas.\nThe early explorations of Spain and Portugal were particularly aided by new ship designs.\nPrior to the fifteenth century Spain and Portugal largely relied on a ship known as the\ngalley5 . Although galleys were fast and manoeuvrable, they were designed for use in the\nconfined waters of the Mediterranean, and were unstable and inefficient in the open ocean.\nTo cope with oceanic voyages, European sailors adapted a ship known as the cog6 , largely\nused in the Baltic7 and North Sea8, which they improved by adding sail designs used in\nthe Islamic world. These new ships, known as caravels9 , had deep keels, which gave them\nstability, combined with lateen sails10, which allowed them to best exploit oceanic winds.\nThe astrolabe11 was a new navigational instrument in Europe that borrowed from the\nIslamic world, which used it in deserts. Using coordinates via the sky, one rotation of the\nastrolabe\u2019s plate, called a tympan12, represented the passage of one day, allowing sailors to\napproximate the time, direction in which they were sailing, and the number of days passed.\nTheastrolabewasreplacedbythesextant13 asthechiefnavigationalinstrumentinthe18th\ncentury. The sextant measured celestial objects in relation to the horizon, as opposed to\nmeasuring them in relation to the instrument. As a result, explorers were now able to sight\nthe sun at noon and determine their latitude, which made this instrument more accurate\nthan the astrolabe.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sub-Saharan%20Africa\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West%20Africa\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara%20Desert\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cog%20%28ship%29\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic%20Sea\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%20Sea\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravel\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lateen%20sails\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/astrolabe\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tympan\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sextant\n30 Portuguese Roles in Early Exploration\n3.3 Portuguese Roles in Early Exploration\nFigure 11 The Treaty of Tordesillasa divided the entire globe in\nhalf. The result, pictured , would result in incredible gains in wealth\nby Spain, who controlled the gold-laden continent of South America\nand the resource-rich Amazon River Basin.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas\nIn 1415, the Portuguese established a claim to some cities (Ceuta, Tangiers) on what is\ntoday the Kingdom of Morocco14, and in 1433 they began the systematic exploration of\nthe west African coast. In August 1492, Christopher Columbus15, whose nationality is\nstill today subject to much debate, set sail on behalf of Ferdinand16 and Isabella17 whose\nmarriage had united their crowns forming what is still today the Kingdom of Spain, and on\nOctober 12 of that same year, he eventually reached the Bahamas thinking it was the East\nIndies18. In his mind he had reached the eastern end of the rich lands of India and China\ndescribed in the thirteenth century by the Venetian explorer Marco Polo.\nAs a result, a race for more land, especially in the so-called \u201dEast Indies\u201d arose. In 1481,\na papal decree granted all land south of the Canary Islands19 to Portugal, however, and\nthe areas explored by Columbus were thus Portuguese territories. In 1493, the Spanish-\ndescendant Pope Alexander VI20, declared that all lands west of the longitude of the Cape\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher%20Columbus\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella%20of%20Castile\n18 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East%20Indies\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary%20Islands\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope%20Alexander%20VI\n31 Chapter 03 - Exploration and Discovery\nVerde Islands21 should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would\nbelongtoPortugal.

HisroleinthematterisstilltodayamatterofstrongcontroversybetweenEuropean\nhistorians of that period.\nThe resolution to this occurred in 1494 at the Treaty of Tordesillas22, creating, after long\nand tense diplomatic negotiations between the Kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, a dividing\nline 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands. Portugal received the west African Coast\nand the Indian Ocean route to India, as well as part of the Pacific Ocean waterways, while\nSpaingainedtheWesternAtlanticOceanandthelandsfurthertothewest. \u00abUnknowingly\u00bb,\nPortugal received Brazil. King John II of Portugal, however, seems to have had prior\nknowledge of the location of that Brazilian territory, for in the difficult negotiations of the\nTreaty of Tordesillas he managed, in a move still open for debate amongst historians of the\nperiod today, to push the dividing line further to the west, making it possible to celebrate\nthe official discovery of Brazil and the reclaiming of the land only in 1500, already under\nthe auspices of the treaty.\n3.4 Important Portuguese Explorers\n3.4.1 Prince Henry (1394\u20131460)\nPrince Henry \u201dthe Navigator\u201d financially supported various voyages. He created a school\nfor the advancement of navigation, laying the groundwork for Portugal to become a leader\nin the Age of Exploration.\n3.4.2 Bartolomeu Dias (1450-1500)\nBartolomeu Dias23, the first European to sail around the Cape of Good Hope24, also found\nthat India was reachable by sailing around the coast of the continent. As a result, trade\nwith Asia and India was made considerably easier because travellers would no longer have\nto travel through the Middle East. Thus, there was a rise in Atlantic trading countries and\na decline in Middle East and Mediterranean countries.\n3.4.3 Vasco da Gama (1460\u20131524)\nVasco da Gama25 was the first to successfully sail directly from Europe to India in 1498.\nThis was an important step for Europe because it created a sea route from Europe that\nwould allow trade with the Far East instead of using the Silk Road Caravan route26.\n21 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape%20Verde%20Islands\n22 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty%20of%20Tordesillas\n23 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartolomeu%20Dias\n24 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope\n25 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasco%20da%20Gama\n26 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk%20Road\n32 Early Spanish Explorers\n3.4.4 Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral (1467\u20131520)\nOn April 21, 1500, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral accidentally discovered Brazil while seeking a\nwestern route to the Indies.

He\nhad served as the Governor of Puerto Rico when he started his own expedition in 1513,\ndiscovering Florida on March 27 of the same year and reaching its eastern coast on April\n2. He called the land Florida (Spanish for flowery), either because of the vegetation he\nsaw there, or it was Easter (Spanish: Pascua Florida ) that time. De Leon then organized\nsubsequent voyages to Florida; the last one occurring in 1521 when he died.\n3.6 English Explorers\n3.6.1 Sir Francis Drake (1540-1596)\nSir Francis Drake44 was a letter of marque, one who is a privateer, for Britain during the\ntime of Queen Elizabeth I45. Though he is most remembered for helping command the\nEnglish fleet against the Spanish Armada46, he also spent many years in the Caribbean and\nsuccessfully circumnavigated the world between 1577-1580.\n3.6.2 John Cabot (1450-1499)\nJohn Cabot, originally Giovanni Caboto was born in Genoa, Italy.\n3.7 French Explorers\n3.7.1 Rene-Robert de La Salle\nLaSalle was born in Rouen, France.

He died when his men revelled in about 1687.\n3.7.2 Father Jacques Marquette\nMarquette was born in Laon, France, in the summer of 1637. He joined the Jesuits at age\nseventeen. The Jesuits told him to go be a missionary in Quebec. He founded missions all\nover the place. He explored many rivers.

Duringthisjourneyhediscovered\nwhat is today Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya, also known as Bear Island.\nLater in the journey, Barentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, and followed it\nnorthward before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. Although they did\nnot reach their ultimate goal, the trip was considered a success.\nSettingoutonJune21595,thevoyagewentbetweentheSiberiancoastandVaygachIsland.\nOn August 30, the party came across approximately 20 Samoyed \u201dwilde men\u201d with whom\nthey were able to speak, due to a crewmember speaking their language. September 4 saw a\nsmall crew sent to States Island to search for a type of crystal that had been noticed earlier.\nThe party was attacked by a polar bear, and two sailors were killed.\nEventually, the expedition turned back upon discovering that unexpected weather had left\nthe Kara Sea frozen. This expedition was largely considered to be a failure.\nIn May of 1596, he set off once again, returning to Bear Island. Barentsz reached Novaya\nZemlya on July 17. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he in-\ntended to head for the Vaigatch Strait, but became stuck within the many icebergs and\n36 Dutch Explorers\nfloes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice, along with\ntheir young cabin boy.\nProving successful at hunting, the group caught 26 Arctic foxes in primitive traps, as well\nas killing a number of polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened\nits grip on the ship, the scurvy-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea on\nJune 13. Barentsz died while studying charts only seven days after starting out, but it took\nseven more weeks for the boats to reach Kola where they were rescued.\n3.8.2 Henry Hudson (1565-1611)\nIn 1609, Hudson was chosen by the Dutch East India Company to find an easterly passage\nto Asia. He was told to sail around the Arctic Ocean north of Russia, into the Pacific and\nto the Far East. Hudson could not continue his voyage due to the ice that had plagued his\nprevious voyages, and many others before him. Having heard rumors by way of Jamestown\nand John Smith, he and his crew decided to try to seek out a Southwest Passage through\nNorth America.\nAfter crossing the Atlantic Ocean, his ship, the Halve Maen (Half Moon), sailed around\nbriefly in the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, but Hudson concluded that these waterways\ndid not lead to the Pacific.\nHe then sailed up to the river that today bears his name, the Hudson River. He made it as\nfar as present-day Albany, New York, where the river narrows, before he was forced to turn\naround, realizing that it was not the Southwest Passage.\nAlong the way, Hudson traded with numerous native tribes and obtained different shells,\nbeads and furs. His voyage established Dutch claims to the region and the fur trade that\nprospered there. New Amsterdam in Manhattan became the capital of New Netherland in\n1625\n3.8.3 Willem Janszoon (1571-1638)\nEarly in Willem\u2019s life,1601 and 1602, he set out on two trips to the Dutch possessions in\nthe East Indies. On November 18, 1605, he sailed from Bantam to the coast of western\nNew Guinea. He then crossed the eastern end of the Arafura Sea, without seeing the\nTorres Strait, into the Gulf of Carpentaria, and on February 26 1606 made landfall at the\nPennefather River on the western shore of Cape York in Queensland, near the modern\ntown of Weipa. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent.\nWillem Janszoon proceeded to chart some 320 km of the coastline, which he thought to be\na southerly extension of New Guinea.\nWillem Janszoon returned to the Netherlands in the belief that the south coast of New\nGuinea was joined to the land along which he coasted, and Dutch maps reproduced this\nerror for many years to come.\nJanszoon reported that on July 31, 1618 he had landed on an island at 22\u00b0 South with a\nlength of 22 miles and 240 miles SSE of the Sunda Strait. This is generally interpreted\nas a description of the peninsula from Point Cloate to North West Cape on the Western\n37 Chapter 03 - Exploration and Discovery\nAustralian coast, which Janszoon presumed was an island without fully circumnavigating\nit.\n3.8.4 Abel Tasman (1603-1659)\nIn 1634 Tasman was sent as second in command of an exploring expedition in the north\nPacific. His fleet included the ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen. After many hardships For-\nmosa (now Taiwan) was reached in November, 40 out of the crew of 90 having died. Other\nvoyages followed, to Japan in 1640 and 1641 and to Palembang in the south of Sumatra in\n1642, where he made a friendly trading treaty with the Sultan. In August 1642 Tasman\nwas sent in command of an expedition for the discovery of the \u201dUnknown Southland\u201d, which\nwas believed to be in the south Pacific but which had not been seen by Europeans\nOnNovember24,1642TasmansightedthewestcoastofTasmanianearMacquarieHarbour.\nHe named his discovery Van Diemen\u2019s Land after Anthony van Diemen, Governor-General\nof the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and\nturned north-east until he was off Cape Frederick Hendrick on the Forestier Peninsula. An\nattempt at landing was made but the sea was too rough; however, the carpenter swam\nthrough the surf, and, planting a flag, Tasman claimed formal possession of the land on\nDecember 3, 1642.\nTasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable\nhe steered east. On December 13 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South\nIsland, New Zealand. After some exploration he sailed further east, and nine days later\nwas the first European known to sight New Zealand, which he named Staten Landt on the\nassumption that it was connected to an island (Staten Island, Argentina) at the south of\nthe tip of South America. Proceeding north and then east one of his boats was attacked by\nM\u0101ori in waka, and four of his men were killed.\nEn route back to Batavia, Tasman came across the Tongan archipelago on January 21,\n1643. While passing the Fiji Islands Tasman\u2019s ships came close to being wrecked on the\ndangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the Fiji group. He charted the eastern tip of\nVanua Levu and Cikobia before making his way back into the open sea. He eventually\nturned north-west to New Guinea, and arrived at Batavia on June 15, 1643.\nWith three ships on his second voyage (Limmen, Zeemeeuw and the tender Braek) in 1644,\nhe followed the south coast of New Guinea eastward. He missed the Torres Strait between\nNewGuineaandAustralia,andcontinuedhisvoyagealongtheAustraliancoast. Hemapped\nthe north coast of Australia making observations on the land and its people.\nFrom the point of view of the Dutch East India Company Tasman\u2019s explorations were a\ndisappointment: he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping\nroute. For over a century, until the era of James Cook, Tasmania and New Zealand were\nnot visited by Europeans - mainland Australia was visited, but usually only by accident\n38 Results of the Age of Exploration\n3.9 Results of the Age of Exploration\nThe Age of Exploration led, directly to new communication and trade routes being estab-\nlished and the first truly global businesses to be established. Tea, several exotic fruits and\nnew technologies were also introduced into Europe.\nIt also led to the decimation and extinction of Natives in other nations due to European\ndiseases and poor working conditions. It also led indirectly to an increase in slavery (which\nwas already widely practised throughout the world), as the explorations led to a rise in\nsupply and thus demand for cotton47, indigo48, and tobacco49.\nFinally, as a result of the Age of Exploration, Spain dominated the end of the sixteenth\ncentury. The Age of Exploration provided the foundation for the European political and\ncommercialworldwideimperialismofthelate1800s. From1580to1640Spainwouldinherit\nthe right to reign over Portugal, whose interests where now in the hands of its political and\ngeographical neighbour. Spain\u2019s power, under Spanish leader Philip II50, was bigger than\never before and renewed and financed the power of the Papacy to fight against Protestant\nReformation. However, in the seventeenth century, as the explorations were coming to an\nend and money was becoming scarcer, other countries began to openly challenge the spirit\nof the Tordesilas treaty and the power of Spain, which began to lapse and lose its former\npower.\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Nh\u1eefng cu\u1ed9c ph\u00e1t ki\u1ebfn \u0111\u1ecba l\u00fd51\n47 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cotton\n48 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigo\n49 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tobacco\n50 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip%20II%20of%20Spain\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FNh%E1%\n51\nBB%AFng%20cu%E1%BB%99c%20ph%C3%A1t%20ki%E1%BA%BFn%20%C4%91%E1%BB%8Ba%20l%C3%BD\n39  4 Chapter 04 - Challenges to Spiritual\nAuthority\n4.1 Introduction\nFigure 12 Spread of Protestantism During\nthe 1500s\nDuring this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and\npowerful, came under scrutiny. For over a thousand years the Christian religion had bound\nEuropean states together despite differences in language and customs. Its all-pervading\npower affected everyone from king to commoner. One of the main Christian tenets is that\n41 Chapter 04 - Challenges to Spiritual Authority\nwealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the\nchurch are there specifically for that reason. The central authority of the church had been\nin Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money led many\nto question whether this tenet was being met. In many respects, the northern European\ncountries felt as though the Papal power was now a Papal business. However it must\nbe noted that the Catholic church has always been the dominant institution in southern\nEuropean countries and in that respect the Reformation can be described as the rise of\na uniquely northern European form of Christianity. Whether its aim was to return the\nchurch to Christ\u2019s message or simply a politically motivated and regional response to the\nconcentration of Papal wealth and power is still a question that divides people.\n4.2 Causes of the Protestant Reformation\n4.2.1 Accusations Of Corruption\nThe purchase of church offices (benefices) and the holding of multiple offices (pluralism)\nhad become common during this period. As was the selling of indulgences, or forgiveness\nfrom God. To some Christians this was proof that the church had become corrupt. Popes\nand bishops were accused of being preoccupied with acquiring wealth rather than tending\nto ecclesiastical matters. The legal exemptions from taxes and criminal charges that they\nenjoyed led many to believe that they could exploit their position for their own benefit.\nClergy were accused of ignoring the church\u2019s message on priestly celibacy and poverty\ntherefore weakening the church\u2019s moral authority. These accusations eventually turned into\na \u201dprotest\u201d against Papal power and clerical abuses.\n4.2.2 Reactions to Church Corruption\nThese allegations of abuse of authority led some to call for a change. Some clergy and\nmonarchs resented the tithes (a proportion of the sum collected by the church) that they\npaid to the central Catholic Church in Italy. The Catholic Church had become a major\nlandowner all over Europe and this ownership of extensive areas of land by religious orders,\nchurches, monasteries and cathedrals had not gone unnoticed. With land comes political\npower, and for any king or lord whose own clergy deferred to a foreign authority the issue\nwasnowpoliticalratherthanreligious. TheissuealsoaroseabouttheuseoftheLatinBible.\nIt was standard practice for masses to be conducted in Latin though by this period Latin\nhad achieved the archaic nature of a dead language. Though Latin was still the language of\nscholarly publications, its use in the mass was questioned on evangelist grounds. Christ\u2019s\nmessage would be better served using the language of the congregation. The invention of\nthe printing press, the decline in Latin and the need to allow the congregation to hear mass\nin the vernacular led to a break with Christian tradition. John Wycliff initiated the first\nEnglish translation of the Bible and this is cited by many as the precursor to the Protestant\nReformation.\n42 Key Persons of the Reformation\n4.3 Key Persons of the Reformation\nFrom 1521 to 1555, Protestantism spread across Europe. The Reformation started as a\nreligious movement, but became political, and as a result had economic and social impacts.\nFigure 13 Luther at age 46 (Lucas\nCranach the Elder, 1529)\n4.3.1 Martin Luther (1486-1546)\nAlthough there were some minor individual outbreaks such as that of John Wycliffe1, a\nyoungGermanmonk,calledMartinLuther2 wasthefirsttoforcetheissueoftheimmorality\nof Church corruption. Disillusioned with the Church, Luther questioned the idea of good\nworks 3 for salvation, including prayers, fasting, and particularly indulgences4.\n95 Theses\nIn 1517, Luther posted his 95 Theses 5, though it is debated whether these were nailed\nto Wittenburg\u2019s All Saint\u2019s Church6, known as Schlosskirche , meaning Castle Church, or\nhis church door. These theses attacked the ideas of salvation through works, the sale of\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wycliffe\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_works\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgences\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95_theses\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Church\n43 Chapter 04 - Challenges to Spiritual Authority\nindulgences, and the collection of wealth by the papacy7. He formally requested a public\ndebate to settle the issue.\nExcommunication\nPope Leo X8 demanded that Luther stop preaching, which Luther refused. He was ex-\ncommunicated because he did not recant his statements and allegations about indulgences\nand immoral salvation. He said only scripture can show what the pope has done is ok.\nexcommunicated9 in 1520; he burned the announcement in front of a cheering crowd.\nDiet of Worms\nLuther was demanded by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles to appear before the Diet of\nWorms10 in 1521; Luther did not back down from his stance, and was declared a heretic11.\nThe Edicts of Worms declared Luther an outlaw and heretic, giving anyone permission to\nkill Luther without recourse. Due to Luther\u2019s popularity in Germany, this could not be\nenforced.\nLutheranism\nLutheranism12 stresseseducationforall,includingfemales. AccordingtoLutherandoctrine,\nmarriage is important, and gender roles should be enforced: women belong in the home and\nshould control the economy, while men should control the household. Clergy can marry.\nSalvation13 is attained by faith14 alone, instead of through works. Religious authority is\nfound in the Bible instead of from the Pope; each man can be his own priest. Religious\nservices are held in vernacular instead of Latin. Only two sacraments are followed: Bap-\ntism, and the Lord\u2019s Supper. Lutheranism teaches neither \u201dtransubstantiation\u201d (the Roman\nCatholic view that the wine and bread change into the body and blood of Christ) nor\n\u201dconsubstantiation\u201d (the view that the body and blood mingle with the bread and wine to\nbecome a third substance), but instead teaches that the Lord\u2019s Supper is the true body and\nblood of Jesus Christ, \u201din, with and under the bread and wine,\u201d given to believers to eat\nand drink. The benefits of receiving the sacrament come not from the physical eating and\ndrinking, but from Jesus\u2019 spoken promise and assurance. In this sense, the sacrament is a\nproclamation of the Gospel. It is God\u2019s Word that makes the Lord\u2019s Supper a sacrament,\nand Luther taught that this means of grace is to be received in faith.\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papacy\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_X\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excommunicated\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_of_worms\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heresy\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salvation\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/faith\n44 Key Persons of the Reformation\nJustification by Faith\nChief among Luther\u2019s doctrines is Justification by Faith. In it, he attacks the Church\u2019s\nview that good works can get a Christian into heaven. For Luther, because humans are\ninherently flawed, they can only rely on God\u2019s grace to get to heaven, not their own works.\nTherefore only faith in the grace of God was necessary (and sufficient) to obtain entry to\nheaven.\nThe Bible as Supreme Authority\nLuther said, \u201d... when the Word accompanies the water, Baptism is valid, even though\nfaith be lacking.\u201d\nLuther challenged the role of the Pope as the supreme temporal authority for interpreting\nGod\u2019swill. ForLuther, theBiblewasthesupremeauthorityofGod. Asanextensionofthis\nphilosophy, Luther believed that all Christians should be able to interpret the Scripture (in\neffect, acting as their own priest). This led Luther to place a heavy emphasis on universal\nliteracyamongChristianssothattheycouldreadtheBibleandattainsalvation(adoctrinal\npoint which, along with the advent of the printing press barely more than half a century\nearlier, led to profound implications for Western society). It also led to Luther\u2019s translation\nof the Bible into German, which he did while in hiding from the wrath of the Holy Roman\nEmperor. This edition of the Bible became massively popular and made Luther\u2019s dialect\nof German the standard to this day. It also had the intended effect of moving Protestant\nliturgy into the vernacular.\nThe Sacraments\nTheCatholicChurchatthetimeofLutherhadsevensacraments(withlittlechangetoday):\n\u2022 Baptism -- The dousing of infants with water to induct them into the church.\n\u2022 The Eucharist (Holy Communion) -- Taking bread and wine in remembrance of the Last\nSupper.\n\u2022 Matrimony -- Marriage.\n\u2022 Holy Orders -- Becoming a priest.\n\u2022 Penance -- Making contrition for your sins.\n\u2022 Confirmation -- a kind of coming-of-age rite in which young people are indoctrinated to\nthe church\u2019s teachings.\n\u2022 Last Rites of Extreme Unction (Last Rites) -- At that time an anointing with oil to heal\nthe sick, now more commonly a death rite.\nLuther considered all but two of those to be unnecessary, and out of the two he accepted\n(Baptism and Holy Communion) he considered only baptism to be doctrinally sound. The\npresent Roman Catholic view of the Holy Communion (transubstantiation) developed in\nthe scholastic period. According to this understanding of the Eucharist, Roman Catholic\npriests were primarily responsible for the bread and wine of the Eucharist becoming the\nbody and blood of Christ. Luther did not believe that the bread and wine changed into the\nflesh and blood of Christ, but rather that the flesh and blood of Christ was invisibly present\n\u201din, with, and under\u201d the bread and wine in the ritual. This \u201dReal Presence\u201d is caused by\nGod and not by a priest thus undercutting the Catholic authority over the sacrament.\n45 Chapter 04 - Challenges to Spiritual Authority\n4.3.2 Ulrich Zwingli (1484-1531), Zwinglianism\nZwinglianism originated in Switzerland, introduced by Ulrich Zwingli. Zwinglism believed\nin the two sacraments of baptism and communion. The religion advocated most of the key\nProtestant beliefs. It believed that the Church is the ultimate authority, and it rejected\nrituals such as fasting and the elaborate ceremonies of Catholicism. Finally, it advocated\nreform through education.\n4.3.3 John Calvin (1504-1564), Calvinism\nJohnCalvinfoundedCalvinisminGeneva,Switzerland;CalvinismlaterspreadtoGermany.\nCalvin was the leading reformer of the second generation of the Reformation, succeeding\nMartin Luther at the forefront of theological debate and discussion. His most important\nwork was Institutes of the Christian Religion, published in 1541 at the age of 26. At the\ntime,ithadatremendousimpact,andmanyconsideredCalvintobeaProtestantequivalent\nof Thomas Aquinas. In it, Calvin outlined the central premises of the religious doctrine\nwhich was to bear his name.\nPredestination\nForemost among these is Calvin\u2019s assertion of Double Predestination (often simply referred\nto as predestination). Single predestination was the doctrine held by most orthodox the-\nologians, including Luther. It said, in essence, that the elect were predestined for heaven.\nHowever, they pointed out that those who went to hell went there on their own free will.\nCalvin objected to this, saying that because all mankind was born in sin, and God had cho-\nsen a specific few to go to Heaven through His grace, he must have also chosen an elect who\nare doomed to damnation. This assertion is based on the commonly accepted view of God\nas: Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and All-Loving. From these premises, Calvin\nconcluded that not only is there an elect destined for Heaven, but also an elect destined for\nHell, and that no one could know with certainty their destination.\nThe Sacraments\nLike Martin Luther, Calvin believed that there were only two sacraments in the church:\nthe Eucharist (Holy Communion) and Baptism. With regard to the Eucharist (Holy Com-\nmunion), Calvin tried to eke out a middle path between the positions which had led to the\nschism of the Marburg Colloquy. While Luther insisted that the body and blood of Christ\nweremademateriallypresentinthebreadandwineofthecommunion, andZwingliinsisted\nthat the communion was merely a symbol of communion, Calvin said that participating in\nThe Eucharist raised the heart and mind of the believer to feast with Christ in heaven.\nCalvin\u2019s view never took root within the Reformation and it was eventually overshadowed\nby Luther\u2019s and Zwingli\u2019s views.\n46 The Counter-Reformation\n4.3.4 Huguenots\nFrench Calvinists that were persecuted because of their religion. The Edict of Nantes gave\nthem the freedom of worship, however during the reign of Louis XIV, the Edict of Foun-\ntainbleu was passed. The Edict of Fountainbleu revoked the rights given to the Huguenots.\n4.4 Chart of Key Religions\nThe below chart offers a simple summary of key details of the major Protestant religions\nthat came to formation, as well as Catholicism.\nReligion KeyBeliefs/Documents Sacraments KeyPeopleandLocations Church/StateRelationship\nLutheranism Two: Thestateismoreimportantthan\n\u2022 Savedbyfaithalone 1.

The Catholic Church worked to reform, reaffirm their key\nbeliefs, and then defend their ideology. It is important to recognize that they changed\nnothing about their core beliefs.\n4.5.1 Council of Trent (1545-1563)\nPope Paul III and Charles V Hapsburg of Austria convened a general church council at\nTrent that met sporadically between 1545 and 1563. The Council reasserted the supremacy\nof clerics over the laity. It did, however, establish seminaries in each diocese to train\npriests. They reformed indulgences, though the process was continued. They did, however,\neliminate pluralism, nepotism, simony, and other similar problems from the church.

In Spain and Rome, Inquisitions, or institutions within the Roman Catholic\nChurch charged with the eradication of heresy, were used to root out heretics. In addition,\nthe Church established the Index of Prohibited Books, which banned books they considered\nheretical. Finally, the Church sent missionaries around the globe to spread its beliefs and\nfaith.\n4.5.3 Jesuits\nTheSocietyofJesus,orJesuitsasitwasknown(foundedonAugust15,1534inFrance),was\na new religious order that arose as a result of the Counter-Reformation. It was founded by\nformerSpanishsoldierandpriest,St. IgnatiusofLoyola(1491-1556),toconvertProtestants\nand non-Christians to Catholicism and add lands to Christendom. The Jesuits vigorously\ndefended the papal authority and the authority of the Catholic Church, thus their title as\nthe \u201dfootmen of the Pope\u201d.\n4.5.4 Missionaries\nMissionaries visited other distant nations to spread the ideals of Catholicism.\n4.5.5 Major Figures\nThethreemostCatholicnationsinEuropeatthetimeweretheHolyRomanEmpire,Spain,\nand France.

Eventually all Jews were forced to leave Spain in 1492\nby Ferdinand and Isabella. Their converso descendants became victims of the Spanish\nInquisition.\n4.7 Religious Qualms in England\nIn 1547, 10 year old Edward VI, son of Henry VIII and Jane Seymour, took the throne. He\nwas cold, serious, and cruel, and although he was incredibly intelligent and exceptionally\ncapable for his age, he was represented by a regent who controlled the nation. From 1547\nuntil 1549, the regent was Edward Seymour. From 1549 to 1553, the regent was John\nDudley. Before Edward\u2019s death in 1553, he signed a will leaving the throne to Lady Jane\nGrey out of fear that his sister Mary would convert England back to Catholicism.\nLady Jane Grey ruled for nine days, but she and Dudley were soon arrested because Mary\nTudor began to gain support since she was the rightful heir to the throne upon Edward\u2019s\ndeath.\n\u201dBloody\u201d Mary Tudor thus took the throne in 1553 and ruled until 1558. She was proud,\nstubborn, vain, vulnerable to flattery, but most of all, she was highly Catholic. In 1554,\nshe converted England back to Catholicism and burnt hundreds of Protestants at the stake,\nthus earning her nickname \u201dBloody\u201d Mary. She married Philip II of Spain. However, as a\nresult of her illness from ovarian cancer, she was forced to recognize her Protestant sister\nElizabeth as the heir.\nes:Historia de Europa/Las reformas religiosas16 vi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Phong tr\u00e0o c\u1ea3i c\u00e1ch t\u00f4n\ngi\u00e1o17\n16 http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Historia%20de%20Europa%2FLas%20reformas%20religiosas\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FPhong%\n17\n20tr%C3%A0o%20c%E1%BA%A3i%20c%C3%A1ch%20t%C3%B4n%20gi%C3%A1o\n49  5 Chapter 05 - Religious Wars in Europe\n5.1 Introduction\nDuringtheperiodof1525until1648,Europewasplaguedbywarsofreligion. Itisimportant\nto recognize, however, that while religion was given as the reason for war, there were many\nother reasons as well. These included land, money and economics, political power, natural\nresources, and more.\nThese wars included the Peasants\u2019 War of 1525 in the Holy Roman Empire, the Schmal-\nkaldic War of the 1540s through 1555, an ongoing fight between the Holy Roman Empire\nand the Turks, the Reconquista of the Spanish versus Muslims, the Hussite rebellion, and\nmissionaries and conquistadors versus Native Americans.\n5.1.1 Warfare\nReligious fighting and warfare spread with Protestantism. The radical new doctrine in Ger-\nmany brought other simmering social tensions to a boil; peasant revolts flared in 1525, re-\nsultinginchaosandbloodshedacrossAustria,SwitzerlandandsouthernGermany. Wealthy\nlandowners were the target of downtrodden rebels demanding social equality and sharing\nof wealth in common. Armies loyal to ruling princes suppressed the revolt, and the leaders\nwere executed. Martin Luther, chief initiator of the Reformation, turned against the rebels\nand defended the authorities\u2019 moves to put them down.\n51 Chapter 05 - Religious Wars in Europe\n5.1.2 Peace of Augsburg\nFigure 14 Henry IV Bourbon of\nFrance by Frans Pourbus the youngera.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans%20Pourbus%20the%20younger\nThe Peace of Augsburg in 1555 declared the Prince\u2019s religion to be the official religion of a\nregion or country (cuius regio, eius religio ). This resulted in the acceptance of toleration\nof Lutheranism in Germany by Catholics. When a new ruler of a different religion took\npower, large groups had to convert religions. Most people found this to be realistic, and\nthe process did not end until 1648.\nIn northern Europe (north Germany, Netherlands, and France), the middle class tended to\nbe Protestant, which corresponded with their work ethic and philosophy. Peasants readily\nconverted religions in order to obtain jobs.\n5.1.3 Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis\nWiththeTreatyofCateau-Cambr\u00e9sisin1559,SpainandFranceagreedtostopfightingwith\neachotherinordertouniteagainsttheircommonProtestantthreat,particularlyCalvinism,\nwhich was considered more of a threat than Lutheranism.\n52 Spanish Conflict with the Dutch\n5.1.4 French War of Religion\nIn France, religious civil war took place from 1562 to 1598 between Catholics and Protes-\ntants. The crown usually supported the Catholics but occasionally shifted sides, while the\nnobility was divided among the two camps. The three leading families in the nation com-\npeted for control of France. These families were the Valois family, which was currently in\npower and was Catholic, the Bourbon family, which consisted of Huguenots (French Protes-\ntants), and the Guise family, who was also Catholic. Ultimately, the Bourbon family won\nthe war, but its leader Henry of Navarre was unable to be crowned because the strongly\nCatholic city of Paris shut itself down. Henry put Paris under a year of siege before finally\ndeciding to convert to Catholicism himself in 1593. The civil war in France was ended\nby the Edict of Nantes in 1598, which reaffirmed that Catholicism was the official reli-\ngion in France, but also granted a significant degree of religious and political freedom to\nProtestants.\nHenry IV could be described as a politique , or one who cares more about his nation\u2019s peace\nand prosperity than he does the enforcement of religious toleration.\n5.2 Spanish Conflict with the Dutch\nIn 1566, on the Assumption of the Virgin day, a group of Calvinists in the Netherlands\nstormed Catholic churches, destroying statutes and relics in a town just outside of Antwerp.\nDutch Calvinists resented the Catholic religion and their conflicts with the religion, as well\nas Spanish King Philip II\u2019s deep devoutness and close-mindedness toward other religions.\nThe high nobility pleaded with him for more tolerance but some of them were put to death\nfor their insolence. One of the underlying reasons was that Philip wanted to establish an\nabsolutemonarchyintheNetherlandsandthereligiousissuegavehimawaytoputpressure\non the parliament. William of Orange escaped to Germany from where he tried to incite a\nrebellion from 1568 onwards but with little success at first. In 1570 the coastal regions got\nhit by a weather-related disaster, the All Saints flood that left many regions devastated and\nthe Spanish authorities showed little compassion. William of Orange, then encouraged Sea\nBeggars, or pirates, to invade the ports of the coast. In 1572 the small town of Brielle was\ntaken by what were no more than outlaws, greeted enthusiastically by the population. The\ntown declared itself for the prince of Orange and this example was followed by a number of\nother towns in the relatively inaccessible provinces of Holland and Zeeland.\n53 Chapter 05 - Religious Wars in Europe\nFigure 15 William of Orange, or William\nthe Silent.\nPhilip sent Spanish troops in response. They took Naarden and Haarlem and inflicted\nhorrible suffering on the population. Other towns proved far harder to take and this caused\nPhilip to run out of money. In what became known as the Spanish Fury, in November of\n1576, Philip\u2019s unpaid mercenary armies attacked the city of Antwerp killing 7,000 in 11\ndays. Antwerp was by far the richest city at the time and the influential merchants got the\nparliament to convene and raise money to pay off the marauding mercenaries. By doing\nso the parliament basically took over control from the king in far Madrid and this was the\nlast thing the king wanted. He sent more troops with an ultimatum to the parliament to\nsurrender or else and appointed the Duke of Parma as the new governor of the Netherlands.\nIn 1579, the southern ten provinces of the Netherlands, which were Catholic, signed the\nUnion of Arras, expressing loyalty to Philip. During that same year, William of Orange\nunited seven northern states in the Union of Utrecht, which formed the Dutch Republic\nthat openly opposed Philip and Spain. In 1581, the Spanish army was sent to retake the\nUnited Provinces of the Netherlands, or the Dutch Republic, who had just declared their\nindependence.\nOn July 10, 1584, William of Orange was assassinated, and after his death, the Duke\nof Parma made progress in his reconquest, capturing significant portions of the Dutch\nRepublic. However, England, under the leadership of Elizabeth I, assisted the Dutch with\ntroopsandhorses, andasaresultSpainwasneverabletoregaincontrolofthenorth. Spain\nfinally recognized Dutch independence in 1648.\n54 The Spanish Armada\n5.3 The Spanish Armada\nFigure 16 Defeat of the Spanish Armada.\nCatholic Philip II of Spain desired to remove Elizabeth I of England from the throne after\nher rise to power following \u201dBloody\u201d Mary Tudor\u2019s fall to illness. Philip was primarily angry\nover Elizabeth\u2019s actions against English Catholics, but he was also upset as a result of\nattacks by English privateers upon Spanish vessels, Elizabeth\u2019s assisting enemies of Spain\nsuch as the Netherlands, and the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots.\nPhilip devised a plan to invade England. The four components of this plan were to bring a\nlargearmyintotheNetherlandsundertheleadoftheDukeofParmaandgetthemprepared\nto invade England. In addition, the Duke of Medina-Sardonia would prepare a large fleet\nwith extra men, and equip the men to join up with the Duke of Parma\u2019s army. Then, Spain\nwould use its fleet to win control of the English Channel and protect the Duke of Parma\u2019s\ninvading force as it crossed. Finally, the troops would invade England and force Elizabeth\nto agree to Spain\u2019s demands: to allow English Catholics to worship in the way that they\nwanted, to stop assisting Protestant Dutch rebels in the Spanish Netherlands, and to pay\nreparations for the cost of the invasion as well as English damage to Spanish ships. Philip\ndid not, however, have any intent to conquer England - he simply desired Elizabeth to\ncede to Spain\u2019s demands. Although on 29 July 1587, Pope Sixtus V had granted Papal\nauthority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been declared a heretic by Pope Pius V, and\nplace whomever he chose on the throne of England.\n55 Chapter 05 - Religious Wars in Europe\n5.3.1 Initial Problems with the Plan\nThere were a number of problems with Philip\u2019s plan. First, the Duke of Medina-Sardonia\nwas appointed leader of the operation. He had no naval experience and was fatalistic.\nMoreover, the Duke of Parma refused to cooperate, as he wanted to be the commander.\nAs a result, he did not assemble enough vessels. In addition, during the preparations, Sir\nFrancis Drake of England raided the city of Cadiz and sank 30 Spanish vessels and burnt\nbarrel staves, resulting in the food for the armada becoming spoiled. Finally, the invasion\nconsisted of 131 ships, resulting in difficult communications.\n5.3.2 The Attack\nTheArmadaarrivedinlateJulyof1588, andwasspottedimmediatelybyEnglishlookouts.\nAt this time, the Duke of Parma still needed a few more days to prepare the troops. On\nJuly 20, Admiral Howard of England devised a plan using fireships, or ships filled with\ncombustibles,toattacktheSpanishfleet. TheseattacksresultedintheSpanishfleetcutting\nitsanchors. OnJuly29, themajorconfrontationtookplace, calledtheBattleofGravelines.\nThe Spanish tactics were outdated - they were to sail in close, fire one volley at the English\nships,andthenproceedtoboardtheEnglishvessels. However,theEnglishnavyhaddevised\nnew tactics, using smaller, more maneuverable ships with longer range, movable cannons.\nBut this new tactic was not decisive, because little damage was done to ships in formation.\nOn the other hand all attempts to leave the formation led to immediate destruction by\ncombined fire of the English ships. When the English fleet was able to scatter the Spanish\nformation with burners, the Armada decided to retreat. This, coupled with the so-called\n\u201dProtestantWind\u201dthatblewtheSpanishshipsthroughtheEnglishChannel, resultedinthe\nSpanish defeat. On May 28, 1588, the Armada had set sail with 131 ships and 30,000 men.\n67 ships and around 10,000 men returned. Many ships sank along the Irish coast, about\n5000 men died from starvation and others were executed in Ireland by English authorities.\n5.3.3 Results of the Spanish Armada\nTheSpanishfleetwasabletorecoverfromthisdefeatinnumbers,butmoralewasshattered.\nThe events marked the rise of English naval power. In addition, they resulted in Dutch\nindependence since Spain could not defeat England. The events were thus a blow to the\nCounter-Reformation, leading to an overall decline in the Counter-Reformation\u2019s effects.\n5.4 The Decline of Spain\nItisacommonmisconceptionthatthefailureofthearmadaresultedinthedeclineofSpain.\nAfter the failed invasion of England, Spain soon began to enter a period of decline. This\noccurred for a number of reasons. The Counter-Reformation had drained considerable\nSpanish resources. Moreover, many of the resources of the Spanish colonies had been\nexhausted. Additionally, only one-third of Spain\u2019s population actually worked - one-third\nof the population belonged to the clergy and another one-third belonged to lower nobility -\n56 The Thirty Years\u2019 War\nand there was no middle class in Spain, and a small higher class. Finally, inbreeding caused\ninept leadership in the monarchy.\n5.5 The Thirty Years\u2019 War\nFigure 17 The victory of Gustavus Adolphusa at the Battle of\nBreitenfeld (1631)b.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus%20Adolphus%20of%20Sweden\nb http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Breitenfeld%20%281631%29\nThe Thirty Years\u2019 War was sparked by the Defenestration of Prague1, at which Protestants\nthrew Catholic ambassadors out of a window in the city of Prague.\nThe Thirty Years\u2019 War had started as a war along religious frontlines. In the end it was\nno more a war of religion. The Catholic French funded and traded the Protestant Dutch,\nProtestant Princes in the Holy Roman Empire, as well as other non-Catholic nations such\nas Sweden, Denmark, and Turkey, since all of these nations were fighting the Hapsburgs.\nFrance, led by Cardinal Richelieu, regent for Louis XIII, desired to reduce the power of\nAustria by funding Austria\u2019s enemies. The war was essentially a fight between the two\npowers to determine which would become the main power in Europe.\nAlthough a high member of the Catholic Church, Richelieu can be described as a politique\n, as he put his nation\u2019s interests ahead of his religion. Indeed, Richelieu openly funded\nProtestant groups in his fight against Austria.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestrations%20of%20Prague\n57 Chapter 05 - Religious Wars in Europe\n5.5.1 Precursors to the War\nThe Schmalkaldic Wars and the Peace of Augsburg of the 1540s through 1555 created a\nnumberofissuesforCharlesVHapsburgofAustria. ThedebateoverwhatreligionGerman\nstates could adopt had not been resolved, as the Peace of Augsburg provided for the states\u2019\nprinces to adopt either Catholicism or Lutheranism, but not Calvinism. The issue of the\nGerman princes\u2019 power and sovereignty was also at bay, as the princes increasingly desired\nmore power. Finally, the princes had been seizing Church land, angering Charles V.\n5.5.2 Bohemian Phase (1618-1625)\nProtestant Bohemians rebelled for religious freedom and independence from Hapsburg rule.\nThe Defenestration of Prague, in which rebels threw two of the Holy Roman Emperor\u2019s,\nFerdinand II, Catholic officials from a castle window, initiated the war in 1618. After\nruthless retaliation by Ferdinand, Bohemia was completely converted to Catholicism and\ndefeated.\n5.5.3 Danish Phase (1625-1630)\nKing Christian of Denmark supported north German Protestants. Catholic general Albert\nWallenstein was hired to defeat Protestant forces and restore Catholic land lost. As a result\nof Austrian victories, Ferdinand II issues the Edict of Restitution in 1629, ordering that\nno longer could Protestants seize and secularize Catholic land. In the Siege of Madgeburg,\nWallenstein\u2019s mercenary force, out of control, massacred the entire town of Madgeburg,\nincluding both Protestants and Catholics. Again, Austria is victorious, and Denmark is\nrelatively easily defeated.\n5.5.4 Swedish Phase (1630-1635)\nSwedish King Gustavus Adolphus, devout Lutheran, came to Germany\u2019s aid. Austria ulti-\nmately defeated Sweden, and it looked like peace was likely. The Edict of Restitution was\nthus withdrawn.\n5.5.5 French/International Phase (1635-1648)\nThough a Catholic state, France had felt threatened by the strengthened Hapsburg Empire,\nand joined the war in 1635 on the side of the Protestants, thus ending the strictly religious\ncharacterofthewar. AcombinedFrench/SwedishalliancetriumphedoverHapsburgforces,\nwhile the Dutch, also allied to France, finally won their formal independence from Spain.\nIn 1648, with all sides exhausted, a final series of peace treaties were prepared.\n58 The Thirty Years\u2019 War\n5.5.6 Peace of Westphalia (1648)\nFigure 18 Map of Europe in 1648, after the Thirty\nYears\u2019 War\nThe Treaty of Westphalia ended the last major religious war in Europe.

Mercantil-\nism became the primary form of economy of the day, and the issue of religion disappeared\nin European wars, now replaced by the issue of the balance of power.\n6.2 Louis XIV (1638-1715), Model of Absolutism\nFigure 19 Louis XIV\nKing of France and of Navarre\nBy Hyacinthe Rigauda (1701)\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthe%20Rigaud\nLouis XIV Bourbon of France rose to power in 1643.

Indeed, he advised his heir, Louis XV, \u201dDo not imitate me in my taste for war.\u201d\nHis aggressive policy demanded to finance the largest European army of 280,000 men.\nLouis\u2019warsresultedinhorrendousresultsandpovertyfortheFrenchpeople,andProtestants\ndespised Louis. His economic policy was headed by Colbert, and his nation was a model in\nenacting mercantilism. During his reign, France became the dominant country in language,\nculture, and dress.\nLouis allegedly famously declared, \u201dL\u2019etat c\u2019est moi,\u201d or \u201dI am the state,\u201d and his reign\nexemplifies absolutism. French Bishop Bossuet declared that it was the divine right of\nmonarchs to rule, concluding that kings were God\u2019s anointed representatives on earth.\nLouis acted upon this belief, governing France as if he were placed on earth by God to rule.\nOverall, Louis\u2019 foreign goals were territorial expansion and the spread of Catholicism.\nLouis was highly successful in his domestic ambitions to achieve absolute power through\ncentralized bureaucracy. He successfully controlled rebellious nobles and made himself the\ncenter of French power and culture. People depended upon him for advancement and\nthrived on his goodwill. Louis also established the palace at Versailles, which took fourteen\nyears to construct. Versailles was modeled by every other major European country, and\nit successfully kept nobles occupied, distracting them from the desire to have a say in\ngovernment. In 1685, Louis revoked the Edict of Nantes, stripping Calvinists of their rights\nin France.\n62 The War of Spanish Succession\n6.3 The War of Spanish Succession\nFigure 20 Charles II in his twenties\nPhilip IV Hapsburg of Spain married Marianna Hapsburg of Austria, and the two of them\nproduced Charles II, the physically and mentally retarded ruler of Spain. Since Charles was\nincapable of producing heirs, upon his death bed he was left to decide who would rule Spain\nafter his death. France argued that they had the best claim to the throne, since they were\nCatholic, strong, and Charles\u2019 half-sister was married to Louis XIV. As a result, Charles\nleft the throne to Philip V Bourbon, the grandson of Louis XIV. War broke out as a result,\npitting a coalition led by William III Orange of the Netherlands against France in an effort\nto maintain the European balance of power. The war resulted in the Peace of Utrecht (via\nthe Treaty of Utrecht1), at which it was agreed that the ruler of Spain had to give up his or\nher claim to the French throne. Thus, Philip was recognized as the King of Spain, but the\nunification of France and Spain was barred. Spain also lost its territories in Belgium and\nItaly at the Peace of Utrecht, a source of much resentment of Spaniards towards their new\ngovernment.\n6.4 The Balance of Power in Foreign Policy\nThe balance of power was a system in which European nations sought to maintain the\nnational sovereignty of all European states. The concept was that all European nations\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty%20of%20Utrecht\n63 Chapter 06 - Absolutism in Europe\nhad to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments\noften changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance. The War of Spanish Suc-\ncession marked the first war whose central issue was the balance of power. This marked an\nimportant change, as European powers would no longer have the pretext of being religious\nwars. Thus, the Thirty Years\u2019 War would be the last war to be labeled a religious war.\n6.5 The Economics of Mercantilism\nThe overall purpose of mercantilism was that mercantilist policies enriched the economy,\nthus resulting in prosperous citizens, higher tax revenues, and in the end funds for military\nand war. During the 1600s, mercantilist policies were adopted by most European nations.\n6.5.1 Key Characteristics\nBy exporting more goods than your country imports, gold and silver will flow into your\ncountry. The government should found colonies, gaining raw materials, and then the na-\ntion should sell finished goods back to the colony. The government should impose high\nexternal tariffs, helping to keep competing goods from other nations out and to protect\nnative manufacturing, thus raising money for the government. The government should\neliminate all internal tariffs, keeping goods flowing freely within the country. Finally, the\nnation should become self-sufficient in all of its needs.\n6.6 The Rise of Prussia (1701-1740)\nPrussia became the power in northern Germany, as opposed to Austria which lay in the\nsouth. The issue of German Dualism arose - specifically asking the question, which of the\ntwo would unite Germany?\n6.6.1 Problems During Prussia\u2019s Rise\nPrussia faced a number of problems during its rise to power. One major issue was that\nPrussia was divided into three sections that needed to be united - the central part, Bran-\ndenburg, which contained Berlin; the eastern part, called Prussia, and western territories.\nIn addition, Prussia had few natural resources, a much smaller population than the other\nmajor powers in Europe, and was still suffering from the effects of the Thirty Years\u2019 War.\n6.6.2 Prussia Rises\nUnder Frederick William \u201dThe Great Elector\u201d, Prussia became highly militaristic, with all\naspects society entirely bent toward the needs of the army. He doubled the army to 80,000\nsoldiers. It was still small compared to other powers, but it was the most well-trained and\nthe most efficient on the continent.\n64 Stuart England 1603-1714\nFrederick William strengthened the Prussian army by enlisting Prussian citizens rather\nthan mercenaries in what was known as the Canton system (not to be confused with the\nChinese trade system). He cut all royal expenses, especially court life, and imposed high\ntaxes on the lower and middle class. State service was required for the nobility, known as\nJunkers, and they frequently served as army officers while the peasants served as infantry.\nTherewasverystrictsocialstratification. Government-subsidizedtextileindustriesresulted\nin standardized uniforms, and all members of the military were also required to maintain\nstandardized hair and facial hair. Frederick established the first efficient bureaucracy in\nEurope, and was especially religiously tolerant, welcoming 20,000 Huguenot refugees after\nLouis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes.\n6.7 Stuart England 1603-1714\nIn 1603, Elizabeth I died without leaving an inheritance and her nephew, James VI of\nScotland (who was also the son of Mary Queen of Scots who was ordered to be executed\nunderElizabeth\u2019sordersin1589)tooktheEnglishthroneasJamesI,makingbothScotland\nand England ruled under the same monarch, and establishing the Stuart dynasty. However\nthe two nations were anything but united - they each had different religions, laws, courts,\nparliaments, churches and customs, not forgetting a 700 year old mistrust and hatred.\n6.7.1 James I 1603-1625\nJames I Stuart ruled as an absolute monarch, who despised Parliament. He went as far\nas to dissolve parliament, and ruled without the voice of the people. He declared that the\nmonarch was God\u2019s Lieutenant, his emissary, and reigned supreme over the land. He began\nthe absolute rule of England, followed by his family for the next several generations. James\nadvocated the divine rights of kings, and in turn wrote a book advocating the divine right\nof kings entitled The Trew Law of Free Monarchies in 1598.\n6.7.2 Charles I 1625-1649\nWhen Charles took the throne, he inherited a very angry Parliament, but he shared his\nfather James I\u2019s beliefs in autocracy. He appointed Archbishop Laud to make the Anglican\nchurchmoreceremonial,likeCatholicism,instillingfearsamongthepopulaceaboutareturn\nto Catholicism.\nIn 1628 the Parliament issued the Petition of Right. This document declared that Charles\ncould not enact taxes without Parliamentary consent. Charles proceeded to levy the ship\nmoney tax without Parliamentary consent, ordering all towns to pay taxes to support the\nEnglish navy. This angered most of the populace as ship money was traditionally paid\nby coastal towns. The Parliament of 1640, dominated by Puritan landowners, fired Laud\nand repealed taxes imposed by Charles. These occurrences resulted in the outbreak of the\nEnglish Civil War.\n65 Chapter 06 - Absolutism in Europe\n6.7.3 English Civil War 1642-1649\nThe war pitted supporters of the Parliament against supporters of the king, and at stake\nwere both political power and control of English economics. The war also pitted Puritans,\nknownas\u201droundheads,\u201dagainstAnglicans,or\u201dcavaliers.\u201dThesupportersofParliamentwere\nled by Oliver Cromwell.\nOther movements sprang up during this time, including Baptists, Quakers, and diggers,\nseekers, and ranters, who equated the clergy with nobles.\nCharles I was captured, and members of Parliament were torn. Presbyterians opposed the\nkilling of the king, while Independents advocated the regicide, or the killing of the king.\nIn \u201dPride\u2019s Purge,\u201d Cromwell forcibly removed all members of Parliament who opposed the\nkilling of the king.\n6.7.4 The Governments of Cromwell\nAfterwards, Cromwell formed a new government called the Commonwealth, which lasted\nfrom 1649 until 1653. This government was a democratic republic. However, in 1653,\nCromwellformedtheProtectorate, whichwaseffectivelyamilitarydictatorship. Hecreated\nthe New Model Army, a paid force of devoted Puritans. His reign involved very strict laws,\nincluding no playing cards nor dancing. He, like many English monarchs, found Parliament\ndifficult to control, it was when he disbanded Parliament, the only English Constitution\nwas written, \u201dInstruments of Government.\u201d\n6.7.5 Stuart Restoration and Charles II Stuart\nIn 1660, Cromwell resigned, resulting in the restoration of Charles II Stuart and thus the\nStuart line to the throne. Charles II is commonly known as the \u201dMerry Monarch\u201d because\nhe engaged in highly festive court life and encountered many mistresses. He did, however,\ndriveEnglanddeeplyintodebt,andcontinuedawarwiththeDutchstartedunderCromwell\nfromthe1650suntilthe1670s. Hepractisedmercantilistpolicies.

In 1673\nhe signed the Declaration of Indulgence, which stated that Catholics could hold political\nand military office. Parliament responded that same year, issuing the Test Act, that stated\nthat citizens would have to profess Anglicanism to join the Parliament and military by\ntaking Anglican communion.\n66 Stuart England 1603-1714\n6.7.6 James II 1685-1688\nFigure 21 James II Stuart of England\nJames II, an overtly Catholic monarch, took the throne in 1685. With his first wife he bore\ntwodaughters, MaryandAnne, whowerebothProtestant, butwithhissecondwifehebore\na son, James, who was baptised Catholic. He upset Parliament at his demand to repeal\nthe Test Act, and instituted the Declaration of Indulgences, which allowed for freedom of\nworship. Angry Protestants would call in William the Stadholder and Mary to bail them\nout.\n6.7.7 Glorious Revolution of 1688\nOut of fear of James\u2019 open Catholicism and the birth of a male Catholic heir, Parliament\ninvited Mary Stuart and William Stuart of Orange to rule England in 1688. Known as the\nGlorious Revolution or Bloodless Revolution because it was peaceful, William and Mary\ntook the throne and signed the Bill of Rights. The bill guaranteed that the king would\ncall Parliament every three years and not dismiss them, and that taxation and war must\nbe approved by Parliament. England was no longer an absolute monarchy but rather a\nconstitutional monarchy.\nIn 1701, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement, stating that all future monarchs of\nEngland must be Protestant above all other characteristics.\n67 Chapter 06 - Absolutism in Europe\n6.7.8 Queen Anne Stuart and the End of the Stuart Line\nQueenAnneruledfrom1702until1714, andissuedtheActofUnionin1707, creatingGreat\nBritain by combining Wales, Scotland, and England. Under her, the House of Commons\ntookdominanceinParliament. WhenshediedinAugust1714,shewassucceededbyGeorge\nI, the first of the Hanoverian line to rule in Britain. The expansion of parliamentary power\nat the expense of the Crown that had taken place since 1688 would continue under the\nHanoverian monarchs, with the first Prime Minister, Sir Robert Walpole, taking office in\n1721. By the accession of George III in 1760, the Crown had very little ability to influence\nnational politics, and largely left the formation of governments to the parties that were\nslowly evolving in Parliament.\n6.8 The Glorious Dutch Republic\n6.8.1 Culture and Economy\nFigure 22 Dutch possessions\nFor a period in the 1600s called the Dutch Golden Age , the Dutch were the commercial,\nshipping, and financial leaders of Europe. They were also recognized for creating one of the\nmost urbane and tolerant societies in Europe. Amsterdam became a centre of commerce,\nlargely because of the sacking of Antwerp, and the Bank of Amsterdam led the entire\nEuropean world in banking.\nAsaresultoftheirtrade, theDutchwerethewealthiestandmostprosperousnation. There\nwas a vast appreciation for the arts, and some of the most famous Baroque artists were\nDutch, such as Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Reubens. Dutch society promoted freedom of\nexpression and religious tolerance, with a wide array of religions from atheists to Catholics.\nThere was a large and well-established middle class, and an excellent educational system.\n68 The Glorious Dutch Republic\nFinally, the Dutch had a confederative republic with a large amount of freedom for self gov-\nernance of its provinces while most other European nations were still undergoing absolutist\nregimes.\n6.8.2 Overseas Colonies\nThe Dutch East India Company began immediately to prise away the string of coastal\nfortressesthatatthetimecomprisedthePortugueseEmpire. Thesettlementswereisolated,\ndifficult to reinforce if attacked, and prone to being picked off one by one, but nevertheless\nthe Dutch only enjoyed mixed success in its attempts to do so. Amboina was captured from\nthe Portuguese in 1605, but an attack on Malacca the following year narrowly failed in its\nobjective to provide a more strategically located base in the East Indies with favourable\nmonsoon winds. The Dutch found what they were looking for in Jakarta, conquered by Jan\nCoen in 1619, later renamed Batavia after the Latin name for Holland, and which would\nbecome the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Meanwhile, the Dutch continued to drive\nout the Portuguese from their bases in Asia. Malacca finally succumbed in 1641 (after a\nsecondattempttocaptureit),Colomboin1656,Ceylonin1658,Nagappattinamin1662and\nCranganoreandCochinin1662. Goa, thecapitalofthePortugueseEmpireintheEast, was\nattacked by the Dutch twice in 1603 and 1610, on both occasions unsuccessfully. Whilst the\nDutchwereunableinfourattemptstocaptureMacaufromwherePortugalmonopolisedthe\nlucrativeChina-Japantrade,theJapaneseshogunate\u2019sincreasingsuspicionoftheintentions\nof the Catholic Portuguese led to their expulsion in 1639. Under the subsequent sakoku\npolicy, for two hundred years the Dutch were the only European power allowed to operate\nin Japan, confined in 1639 to Hirado and then from 1641 at Deshima.\nBy 1650, the Dutch had overtaken Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk\ntrade, and in 1652 founded a colony at Cape Town on the coast of South Africa, as a\nway-station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia.\nIn the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip\non the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on\ntheirhomewardboundvoyage. BahiaonthenortheastcoastofBrazilwascapturedin1624\nbut only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition.\nIn 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast\nfortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its\nshareholders a cash dividend of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other\nsuccessesagainsttheSpanish. In1630,theDutchoccupiedthePortuguesesugar-settlement\nof Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations\nthat surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required,\nan expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of\nElmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. By 1650,\nthe West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had\noccupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Cura\u00e7ao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to\nguarantee access to the islands\u2019 salt-pans.\nUnlikeinAsia,DutchsuccessesagainstthePortugueseinBrazilandAfricawereshort-lived.\nYears of settlement had left large Portuguese communities under the rule of the Dutch, who\nwere by nature traders rather than colonisers. In 1645, the Portuguese community at\n69 Chapter 06 - Absolutism in Europe\nPernambuco rebelled against their Dutch masters, and by 1654, the Dutch had been ousted\nfrom Brazil. In the intervening years, a Portuguese expedition had been sent from Brazil\nto recapture Luanda in Angola, by 1648 the Dutch were expelled from there also.\nOn the north-east coast of North America, the West India Company took over a settlement\nthat had been established by the Company of New Netherland (1614-18) at Fort Orange at\nAlbany on the Hudson River, relocated from Fort Nassau which had been founded in 1614.\nThe Dutch had been sending ships annually to the Hudson River to trade fur since Henry\nHudson\u2019s voyage of 1609. In order to protect its precarious position at Albany from the\nnearby English and French, the Company founded the fortified town of New Amsterdam\nin 1625 at the mouth of the Hudson, encouraging settlement of the surrounding areas of\nLong Island and New Jersey. The fur trade ultimately proved impossible for the Company\nto monopolise due to the massive illegal private trade in furs, and the settlement of New\nNetherland was unprofitable. In 1655, the nearby colony of New Sweden on the Delaware\nRiver was forcibly absorbed into New Netherland after ships and soldiers were sent to\ncapture it by the Dutch governor, Pieter Stuyvesant.\nEver since its inception, the Dutch East India Company had been in competition with its\ncounterpart, the English East India Company, founded two years earlier but with a capital\nbase eight times smaller, for the same goods and markets in the East. In 1619, the rivalry\nresulted in the Amboyna massacre, when several English Company men were executed by\nagentsoftheDutch. TheeventremainedasourceofEnglishresentmentforseveraldecades,\nand in the late 1620s the English Company shifted its focus to from Indonesia to India.\n6.8.3 Anglo-Dutch Wars\nIn 1651, the English parliament passed the first of the Navigation Acts which excluded\nDutch shipping from the lucrative trade between England and its Caribbean colonies, and\nled directly to the outbreak of hostilities between the two countries the following year. The\nwar would prove to be indecisive, but the English had failed to replace the Dutch as the\nleader of World trade.\nThe Second Anglo-Dutch War was precipitated in 1664 when English forces moved to cap-\ntureNewNetherland. Aftertwoyearsofwar,theDutch,ledbyMichieldeRuyter,destroyed\nor captured much of the British fleet at Medway, and England was forced to sue for peace.\nUnder the Treaty of Breda (1667), New Netherland was ceded to England in exchange for\ntheEnglishsettlementsinSuriname, whichhadbeenconqueredbyDutchforcesearlierthat\nyear.\n6.8.4 Wars With France\nIn 1672 the French invaded the Republic, starting the Franco-Dutch War and were only\nstopped when they reached the Dutch Water Line. England and France had secretly agreed\nto split the Netherlands between themselves, but after defeats at sea, and unable to cross\nthe waterline, the French Army began a slow and cautious retreat out of the Republic.\nPeace was signed in 1678.\n70 Peter Romanov the Great of Russia (1689-1723)\nThe Glorious Revolution of 1688 saw the Dutch William of Orange invade England, and\nascend to the throne, ending Fifty years of rivalry between the Netherlands and England,\nand brought the two countries into the Nine Years\u2019 War against France the same year. The\nAnglo-Dutch fleet(mostly Dutch) dominated the seas, and France was unsuccessful.\n6.9 Peter Romanov the Great of Russia (1689-1723)\nPeter installed an absolute monarchy in Russia, with absolutely no concept of the social\ncontract. Serfdom still remained strong in Russia, with no middle class nor urbanization.\nIn Russia, advancement was based upon merit rather than birth or blood line.\nThe ultimate goal of Peter\u2019s foreign policy was to obtain warm water ports for his nation,\nwhich were essential for trade, naval power, and access to the west. He battled Sweden\nfor a port on the Baltic and with the Ottoman Turks for a port on the Black Sea. In the\nGreatNorthernWaragainstSweden, Russia defeatedtheSwedisharmyin Poltavabyusing\nthe scorched earth policy2, in which the Russians retreat, burn the crops or villages in the\ntown, and wait for winter to take its toll upon the enemy troops. As a result, the Russians\nsuccessfully obtained their warm water port on the Baltic, which was named St. Petersburg\nand known as the \u201dwindow to the west.\u201d\nPeter enacted the \u201dGreat Embassy,\u201d which was a tour of Peter and his nobles through\nmany Western European nations. The ultimate goal of the Great Embassy was to use the\ninformation collected to westernize Russia, as Peterwas afraid of increasing Western power.\nThrough the Great Embassy, Peter acquired many important technological skills, especially\nmilitary technology, such as naval instruments, army tactics, ship building techniques, and\nnavalstrategy. Heimportedforeignworkerswithtechnologicalskillsaswell,andintroduced\nnew attire that was being worn across the rest of Europe. He implemented the Julian\ncalendar, which although was not the modern Gregorian calendar at the time, was more\nmodern than what was being used in the past. He established much better education, and\nhe also established the first modern Russian army with 200,000 men. Nobles were required\nto perform state service in either the army or the bureaucracy.\n6.10 Baroque Art\nBaroqueArtcametoexistenceduringthe1600sandlastedthroughthemid-1700s. Baroque\nart was used by Catholics in the Counter-Reformation. Baroque Art can be characterized\nby its rich and vibrant colors, its intense use of light, great drama, and exuberance. Unlike\nRenaissance art, which usually depicted mellow scenes, Baroque Art captured the climax\nof a scene. It used dynamic lighting to create a \u201dspotlight\u201d effect on the canvas.\nBaroque art was used in archetecture, art, and even music. This form of work was included\nin the building of St. Petersburg.\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scorched%20earth%20policy\n71 Chapter 06 - Absolutism in Europe\n6.10.1 Caravaggio\nCaravaggio was a famous Italian painter for the Catholic Counter-Reformation, painting\nsuchworksasJudith Slaying HolofernesandThe Incredulity of St. Thomas. Heintroduced\ndramatic light and dark effects, and he helped transition from mannerism to new Baroque\nstyles.\n6.10.2 Bernini\nBernini was a famous Italian sculptor, who perhaps most famously created The Ecstasy of\nSt. Theresa . This sculpture was of the mystic nun in a trance in the height of religious\nrapture. Bernini was one of the first masters to realize the importance of the effect of light.\nes:Historia de Europa/El absolutismo3 vi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Ch\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed9 qu\u00e2n ch\u1ee7 chuy\u00ean ch\u1ebf \u1edf\nch\u00e2u \u00c2u4\n3 http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Historia%20de%20Europa%2FEl%20absolutismo\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FCh%E1%\n4 BA%BF%20%C4%91%E1%BB%99%20qu%C3%A2n%20ch%E1%BB%A7%20chuy%C3%AAn%20ch%E1%BA%BF%20%E1%\nBB%9F%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u\n72 7 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and\nEnlightenment\n7.1 Introduction\nThe Age of Science of the 1600s and the Enlightenment of the 1700s, also dubbed the Age\nof Enlightenment, introduced countless new concepts to European society. These ideas con-\ntinuetopermeatemodernsociety. Manymoderninstitutionshavemuchoftheirfoundations\nin the ideals of these times.\n7.2 An Era of Enlightened Rulers\nAnewformofgovernmentbegantoreplaceabsolutismacrossthecontinent. Whilstmonar-\nchs were reluctant to give up their powers, many also recognized that their states could\npotentially benefit from the spread of Enlightenment ideas. The most prominent of these\nrulers were Frederick II the Great Hohenzollern of Prussia, Joseph II Hapsburg of Austria,\nand Catherine II the Great Romanov of Russia.\nIn order to understand the actions of the European monarchs of this period, it is important\nto understand their key beliefs. Enlightened despots rejected the concept of absolutism and\nthe divine right to rule. They justified their position based on their usefulness to the state.\nThese rulers based their decisions upon their reason, and they stressed religious toleration\nand the importance of education. They enacted codified, uniform laws, repressed local\nauthority, nobles, and the church, and often acted impulsively and instilled change at an\nincredibly fast rate.\n7.2.1 Catherine the Great 1762-1796\nCatherinetheGreatcametopowerbecausePeterIIIfailedtobearamaleheirtothethrone\nand was killed.\nHer enlightened reforms include:\n\u2022 Restrictions on torture\n\u2022 Religious toleration\n\u2022 Education for girls\n\u2022 1767 Legislative Commission, which reported to her on the state of the Russian people\n\u2022 Trained and educated her grandson Alexander I so that he could progress in society\nbecause of his merit rather than his blood line\n73 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment\nShe was friends with Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire. However, Catherine also took a number\nof decidedly unenlightened actions. In 1773 she violently suppressed Pugachev\u2019s Rebellion,\na massive peasant rebellion against the degradation of the serfs. She conceded more power\nto the nobles and eliminated state service. Also, serfdom became equivalent to slavery\nunder her.\nForeign Policy\nCatherine combated the Ottoman Empire. In 1774, Russia gained a warm water port on\nthe Black Sea.\n7.2.2 Frederick II the Great 1740-1786\nFrederick II Hohenzollern of Prussia declared himself \u201dThe First Servant of the State,\u201d be-\nlieving that it was his duty to serve the state and do well for his nation. He extended\neducation to all classes, and established a professional bureaucracy and civil servants. He\ncreated a uniform judicial system and abolished torture. During his tenure, Prussia in-\nnovated agriculture by using potatoes and turnips to replenish the soil. Also, Frederick\nestablished religious freedom in Prussia.\n7.2.3 Joseph II Habsburg 1765-1790\nJoseph II Habsburg (also spelled as Hapsburg) of Austria could be considered perhaps the\ngreatest enlightened ruler, and he was purely enlightened, working solely for the good of\nhis country. He was anti-feudalism, anti-church, and anti-nobility. He famously stated,\n\u201dThe state should provide the greatest good for the greatest number.\u201d He created equal\npunishment and taxation regardless of class, complete freedom of the press, toleration of\nall religions, and civil rights for Jews. Under Joseph II a uniform law code was established,\nand in 1781 he abolished serfdom and in 1789 ordered the General School Ordinance, which\nrequired compulsory education for Austrian children. However, Joseph failed because he\nangered people by making changes far too swiftly, and even the serfs weren\u2019t satisfied with\ntheir abrupt freedom.\n7.2.4 England\nAs a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England already had a Parliament and thus\nthe concept of enlightened ruler did not take hold in England.\n7.2.5 France\nAfter Louis XIV the \u201dSun King,\u201d Louis XV took control from 1715 until 1774. Like his\npredecessor, he was an absolute monarch who enacted mercantilism. As a result of the\ninfluence and control of absolutism in France, France also did not encounter an enlightened\nruler. In order to consummate an alliance between his nation and Austria, Maria Theresa\n74 A War-Torn Europe\nof Austria married her daughter, Marie Antoinette, to Louis XV\u2019s heir, Louis XVI. Louis\nXV recognized that the fragile institutions of absolutism were crumbling in France, and he\nfamously stated, \u201dApr\u00e8s moi, le d\u00e9luge\u201d , or \u201dAfter me, the flood.\u201d\n7.3 A War-Torn Europe\n7.3.1 War of Austrian Succession\nThe war of Austrian Succession of 1740 to 1748 pitted Austria, England, and the Dutch\nagainst Prussia, France, and Spain. Upon Maria Theresa\u2019s acquisition of the Austrian\nthrone, Frederick the Great of Prussia attacked Silesia, and war broke out. In 1748 peace\ncame at the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle. The treaty preserved the balance of power and the\nstatus quo ante bellum . Austria survived but lost Silesia, which began \u201dGerman Dualism\u201d\nor the fight between Prussia and Austria over who would dominate and eventually unite\nGermany.\n7.3.2 The Seven Years War\nThepeacein1748wasrecognizedastemporarybyall,andin1756AustriaandFranceallied\nin what was known as the Diplomatic Revolution. The reversal of the traditional France\nversusAustriasituationoccurredasaresultofbothnation\u2019sfearofarising,militantPrussia.\nTo consummate the marriage, Louis XVI married Marie Antionette. The Seven Years War\nengaged Austria, France, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Saxony against Prussia and England.\nThe purpose of the war was to annihilate Prussia, and took place at a number of fronts:\nin Europe, in America (where American citizens know it as the French and Indian War)\nand in India. At the Peace of Paris in 1763, the war concluded, and Prussia retained all\nof its territory, including Silesia. France ceded Canada to Britain and the North American\ninterior to Spain, and removed its armies from India. It did, however, get to keep its West\nIndies colonies.\nAt this point, Great Britain became the supreme naval power and it began its domination\nof India.\n7.3.3 The Partitioning of Poland\nPoland was first partitioned on February 19, 1772, between Russia, Austria, and Prussia,\nin an agreement between them to gain more land and power in Europe. Poland was able to\nbe partitioned because it was weak and had no ability to stop the larger and more powerful\nnations. The balance of power was not taken into consideration by France or England\nbecause the partitioning did not upset the great powers of Europe. The second partition\ninvolvedRussiaandPrussiatakingadditionallandfromPoland. Afterthesecondpartition,\nwhichoccurredonJanuary21,1792,themajorityoftheirremaininglandwaslosttoPrussia\nand Russia.

Russiaendedupwith120,000square\n75 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment\nkilometres, Austria 47,000 square kilometres, and Prussia 55,000 square kilometres. This\ntook Poland off of the map.\n7.4 Science and Technology\nThe Enlightenment was notable for its scientific revolution, which changed the manner in\nwhich the people of Europe approached both science and technology. This was the direct\nresult of philosophic enquiry into the ways in which science should be approached. The\nmost important figures in this change of thinking were Descartes and Bacon.\nThe philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes presented the notion of deductive reasoning - that is, to\nstart with a premise and to then discard evidence that doesn\u2019t support the premise. How-\never, Sir Francis Bacon introduced a new method of thought. He suggested that instead\nof using deductive reasoning, people should use inductive reasoning - in other words, they\nshould gather evidence and then reach a conclusion based on the evidence. This line of\nthought also became known as the Scientific Method.\n7.4.1 Changes in Astronomy\nThe Scientific Revolution began with discoveries in astronomy, most importantly dealing\nwith the concept of a solar system. These discoveries generated controversy, and some were\nforced by church authorities to recant their theories.\nFigure 23 Aristotle\nPre-Revolution: Aristotle and Ptolemy\nThe geocentric (earth-centred) view of the universe had been taught since the days of\nAristotle. Ptomely\u2019s \u201dAlmagest\u201d (c.2nd century CE) was the standard text used to teach\nstudentsastronomyandremainedsoforhundredsofyears. Ptolemy\u2019stheoriesareamixture\nof science and religion and to modern readers may come across as unusual though it must\nalways be borne in mind that Ptolemy was building upon the works of earlier astronomers.\nSurprisingly a Greek philosopher called Aristarchus (310 BC - ca.230 BC) suggested that\nthe earth moved around the sun and though this was common knowledge amongst all who\n76 Science and Technology\nstudied astronomy it would be over a thousand years before he was proved right. The\nearly christian church (c.4th century CE) adopted the Ptolemaic system since it was in\naccord with biblical teaching. A universe without the earth at its center would negate\ndivine purpose and Ptolemy\u2019s idea of the spheres in harmony strengthened the creationist\nargument. The Enlightenment, which is also referred to as the Age of Reason, was a period\nwhen European philosophers emphasized the use of reason as the best method for learning\nthe truth.\nNicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543)\nFigure 24 Heliocentric solar system\nDuring the Renaissance, study of astronomy at universities began. Regiomontanus1 and\nNicolas of Cusa2 developed new advances in mathematics and methods of calculation.\nCopernicus, although a devout Christian, doubted whether the views held by Aristotle and\nPtolemy were completely correct.

He used Brahe\u2019s body of data to write Kepler\u2019s Three Laws\nof Planetary Motion, most significantly noting that planets\u2019 orbits are elliptical instead of\ncircular.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann%20M%C3%BCller%20Regiomontanus\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal%20Nicolas%20of%20Cusa\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism\n77 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment\nGalileo Galilei (1564-1642)\nGalileo is generally given credit for invention of the telescope; although the device itself is\nnot of Galileo\u2019s design, he was the first to use it for astronomy. With this tool, he proved\nthe Copernican Theory of the Universe.\nGalileo spread news of his work through letters to friends and colleagues. Although the\nChurch forced him to recant his ideas and spend the rest of his life under house arrest, his\nworks had already been published and could not be disregarded.\nFigure 25 Sir Isaac\nNewton\nIsaac Newton (1642-1727)\nNewton is often considered the greatest scientific mind in history. His Principia Math-\nematica (1687) includes Newton\u2019s Law of Gravity, an incredibly ground-breaking study.\nNewton\u2019s work destroyed the old notion of an Earth-centred universe.\nNewton also had a great influence outside of science. For example, he was to become the\nhero of Thomas Jefferson.\n7.4.2 Developments in Medicine\nAndreas Vesalius (1514-1564)\nVesalius studied human cadavers, a practice forbidden by church doctrine.

He was a doctor and an anatomist.\n78 Society and Culture\n7.5 Society and Culture\nAs a result of new learning from the Scientific Revolution, the world was less of a mystical\nplace, as natural phenomena became increasingly explainable by science. According to\nEnlightened philosophers:\n\u2022 Theuniverseisafullytangibleplacegovernedbynaturalratherthansupernaturalforces.\n\u2022 Rigorous application of the scientific method can answer fundamental questions in all\nareas of inquiry.\n\u2022 The human race can be educated to achieve nearly infinite improvement.\nPerhaps most importantly, though, Enlightened philosophers stressed that people are all\nequal because all of us possess reason.\n7.5.1 Precursors\nThere were a number of precursors to the Enlightenment. One of the most important was\nthe Age of Science of the 1600s, which presented inductive thinking, and using evidence to\nreachaconclusion. TheideasofLockeandHobbesandthenotionofthesocialcontractchal-\nlenged traditional thinking and also contributed to the Enlightenment. Scepticism, which\nquestioned traditional authority and ideas, contributed as well. Finally, the idea of moral\nrelativism arose - assailing people for judging people who are different from themselves.\n7.5.2 The Legacy of the Enlightenment\nThe Enlightenment began in France, as a result of its well-developed town and city life, as\nwell as its large middle class that wanted to learn the ideas. The Enlightenment promoted\nthe use of one\u2019s reason, rather than accepting tradition. It rejected the traditional attitudes\nof the Catholic Church. Many \u201dphilosophers,\u201d or people who thought about subjects in an\nenquiring, inductive manner, became prominent. Salons were hosted by upper-middle class\nwomen who wanted to discuss topics of the day, such as politics.\nThe Enlightenment stressed that we are products of experience and environment, and that\nwe should have the utmost confidence in the unlimited capacity of the human mind. It\nstressed the unlimited progress of humans, and the ideas of atheism and deism became\nespecially prominent. Adam Smith\u2019s concept of free market capitalism sent European eco-\nnomics in a new direction. Enlightened despots such as Catherine the Great and Joseph\nII replaced absolute monarchs and used their states as agents of progress. Education and\nliteracy expanded vastly, and people recognized the importance of intellectual freedoms of\nspeech, thought, and press.\n7.5.3 Conflict with the Church\nAlthough the ideas of the Enlightenment clashed with Church dogma, it was mostly not a\nmovement against the Church. Most Enlightened philosophers considered themselves to be\nfollowers of deism, believing that God created an utterly flawless universe and left it alone,\nsome describing God as the \u201ddivine clockmaker.\u201d\n79 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment\n7.5.4 Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)\n\u2022 dies before the enlightenment\n\u2022 English Revolution shapes his political outlook\n\u2022 Leviathan (1651) - life is \u201dnasty, brutish, and short\u201d - people are naturally bad and need\na strong government to control them.\n\u2022 may be considered to be the father of the enlightenment: because of all the opposition\nhe inspired.\nFigure 26 John\nLocke\n7.5.5 John Locke (1632-1704)\n\u2022 specifically refuted Hobbes\n\u2022 humanity is only governed by laws of nature, man has right to life, liberty, and property\n\u2022 there is a natural social contract that binds the people and their government together;\nthe people have a responsibility to their government, and their government likewise has\na responsibility to its people\n\u2022 Two Treatises on Civil Government justified supremacy of Parliament\n\u2022 Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690) - Tabula rasa - human progress is in the\nhands of society\n7.5.6 Philosophers\nVoltaire (1694-1776)\n\u2022 stressed religious tolerance\nBaron de Montesquieu (1689-1755)\n\u2022 Spirit of the Laws - checks and balances on government, no one group having sole power\n80 Society and Culture\nFigure 27\nJean-Jacques\nRousseau\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)\n\u2022 social contract\n\u2022 \u201dgeneral will\u201d - government acts for the majority\n7.5.7 Rococo Art\nFigure 28 Diana Leaving her Bath by Fran\u00e7ois Bouchera.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boucher\n81 Chapter 07 - Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment\nThe Rococo Art movement of the 1700s emphasized elaborate, decorative, frivolous, and\naristocratic art.

It marks the rise of the 3rd class after centuries of paying high tax\nto the King. The revolution centred around (at its peak) the weak King Louis XVI and\nthe immature Queen Marie Antoinette , as the public saw them, and their lavish lifestyle\nhidden away at Versailles. The people of France at the time of 1789 were being influenced\nby the media, which did not help the situation. The press would make up stories of their\n\u201dWicked Queen\u2019s\u201d lavish spending of public money, and her many love affairs which made\nher extremely unpopular among the French public. The 6 October 1789 marks the start of\nthe Revolution when 100s of market women (and men dressed as women) marched on the\nPalaceOfVersaillesdemandingtheQueen\u2019sheadandtheKing\u2019simmediatereturntoParis.\nThe women were successful in bringing the Royal family back to Paris, even if the queen\nhad not been killed as intended. The situation worsened once in Paris as the \u201dReign of\nTerror\u201d came to power, and as Marie Antoinette famously said \u201dNow they will make proper\nprisoners of us.\u201d\n8.2 Diplomatic Revolution\nThe Diplomatic Revolution is a term applied to the reversal of long standing diplomatic al-\nliancesinthewakeofthePeaceofAix-la-ChapellewhichconcludedtheWaroftheAustrian\nSuccession in 1748. The traditional alliances of France and Prussia against Great Britain\nand Austria changed to France and Austria against Great Britain and Prussia. In order\nto cement the alliance, Maria Theresa of Austria married her daughter, Marie Antoinette,\nto Louis XVI, heir to the French throne. Despite hope that this alliance would create an\nunbeatable power bloc in Europe, it failed to win the Seven Years\u2019 War (fought in Europe\nfrom 1758-1763, known in America as the French and Indian War), as both Austria and\nFrance failed to stop the rising power of Prussia under Frederick the Great. Furthermore,\npublic opinion on both sides was very sceptical of this alliance, for Austria and France had\ntraditionally been enemies since the Habsburg-Valois wars of the 16th century.\nThe Austrian alliance, including the marriage of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette is com-\nmonlyconsideredoneofthecentralcausesoftheFrenchRevolution. TheQueenwaswidely\ncondemned for her extravagance, extreme even for a queen, and the most quoted remark\nnever said; when told that the peasants of France were so poor that they could not put\nbread on the table, she was said to have replied, \u201dlet them eat cake,\u201d which supposedly\n\u201dproved\u201d that she was out of touch with the general populace. Although it is unlikely that\nthe queen ever said such a thing, it is still an example of the French citizens\u2019 opinion of\n83 Chapter 08 - Revolution in France\ntheir royalty, that they would create such a story. As the historian Munro Price suggests,\nthough, much of the criticism of Marie-Antoinette came from the fact that there was no one\nelse to blame for bad policies. Under Louis XIV and Louis XV, both of whom were prolific\nwomanizers who had many official mistresses during their respective reigns, public opinion\noftenleveledtheblameforsociety\u2019sillsattheKing\u2019scurrentministerswho,moreoftenthan\nnot, owed their position to the royal mistress (such as the Duc de Choiseul and Madame\nde Pompadour in the 1750s). When there was no mistress, however, as was the case with\nLouis XVI, opinion turned on the Queen, who was widely perceived, and to some extent\ncorrectly, to exercise influence with the King in the choice of ministers, as had happened\nwith the intermittent appointments of the Baron de Breteuil (a favorite of the Queen\u2019s) to\nthe royal council.\n8.3 Neoclassicism\nFigure 29 Death of Marat by\nJacques-Louis David (1793)\nNeoclassicism isa genre ofart thatwasprevalentmainlyin the18th and intothe early19th\ncenturies that was based on the Greek style of decoration such as columns. Neoclassical art\nuses sharp colors as a replacement for more pastel colors. Neoclassicism was influenced by\nThe Enlightenment, which took place in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was the thought\nof more individualization of the community. It emphasized reason rather than emotion.\nOne of the more popular french artists during neoclassic age was Jacques-Louis David. He\nwas born August 30th 1748 and died on December 29th 1825. He painted the painting\n84 Precursors to the French Revolution\ncall \u201cTennis Court Oath\u201d in 1792 of the Tennis Court Oath during the French Revolution.\nDuring the French Revolution, he became good friends with Maximilien Robespierre, the\nhead of the Committee of Public Safety.\n8.4 Precursors to the French Revolution\nCountlessideasfromtheEnlightenmentcontributedtotheFrenchRevolution. Locke\u2019sideas\nof overthrowing government that does not respect the social contract, as well as Rousseau\u2019s\nideas of the general will and the French government\u2019s failure to represent the general will of\nthepeople,weremajorfactors. TheEnlightenmentalsostrippedawayatreligion,especially\nCatholicism, directly attacking the divine right theory that Louis XVI of France used to\njustify his position.\nAdditionally, there were massive food shortages across France, there was a constant war,\nanger over social inequality, and a weak queen and king. Moreover, a harsh winter had\nresulted in no harvest and the lack of food, especially bread, causing poverty, death, and\ndestruction.\nThe immediate spark of the French Revolution, however, was the financial crisis in France.\nThis problem stemmed from a number of issues. One of the most prominent of these issues\nwas the fact that the nobles were tax-exempt, and the nobles resisted any attempt by\nLouis to tax them. In addition, France had accrued massive debt from assisting in the\nAmerican Revolution, as well as from the Seven Years War. Finally, French tax collectors\nwere corrupt. As a result, Louis called the Estates General for assistance and advice to\nresolve the financial crisis.\nThe Estates General consisted of three estates: the first estate was made up of clergymen,\nthe second estate was made up of nobles, and the third estate was made up of commoners,\nwho represented at least 95% of the populace. The third estate, angry over their dispro-\nportionate representation and their inability to act according to their needs, rebelled, and\ndeclared itself the National Assembly. Three days later members of the third estate took\nthe Oath of the Tennis Court, swearing allegiance to the French nation and drawing up\na list of grievances (cahiers de dol\u00e9ances) against the king. They aimed to democratically\nrepresent the will of the people and give the people a constitution, and they were clearly\nmotivated by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England.\n8.5 End of a royal family\nTheterrifiedKingLouisXVI,QueenMarieAntoinettetheirtwoyoungchildren(11yearold\nMarie Therese and four year old Louis-Charles) and the King\u2019s sister, Madam Elizabeth, on\nthe 6th October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.\nIn a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a mob of people screaming and\nshouting threats against the King and Queen. The mob of people forced the King And\nQueen to have their carriage windows wide open. At one point a member of the mob waved\nthe head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen. Despite Marie\n85 Chapter 08 - Revolution in France\nAntoinette\u2019s best efforts to please the mob in giving out bread from the carriage, it was\nthrown back, as the people refused to eat it as \u201dIt is sure to be poisoned.\u201d\nThe next four years of the Royal family\u2019s lives were to be of misery and hope although\nthe efforts of Queen Marie Antoinette\u2019s Austrian family, and close friends of the King and\nQueen such as Count Ferson and Count Mercy, and despite one failed rescue attempt, the\nroyalfamilywereimprisoned. TheRoyalfamilysawtheterroroftheFrenchRevolution,the\nQueensnephewby1792wasnowEmperorofAustriaandfeltnoneedtorescuehisAuntwho\nhe had never met before. In 1792 the crown was abolished in favour of a republic making\nthe now former Royal family of France to be nicknamed \u201cThe carpets\u201d. Louis Carpet, the\nformer King, stood trial in January of 1793 and was found guilty of treason and sentenced\nto death by Guillotine. An emotional scene followed in which the King said his goodbye to\nhisdevastatedfamily. \u201cAndyoucametoFranceforthis!\u201dLouisexclaimedtohiswife, Marie\nAntoinette, dressed in black upon hearing that her husband had been executed from that\ndayon. Howevermoresadnessfollowedwhenthe\u201cWidowCarpet\u201dMarieAntoinette\u2019s8year\nold son Louis-Charles was to be taken away. Marie Antoinette leaped into his arms and\ndid not let go for a full hour, despite threats to her life. It was not until they threatened to\nkill her Marie Therese that she let go. The boy who was hailed as King by Royalist around\nFrance and Europe was integrated and turned against his mother. The former Queen was\nalso taken from Madam Elizabeth and her daughter, \u201cTreat her like a second mother\u201d Marie\nAntoinette told Marie Therese before departing form the tower. As Marie Antoinette was\nled down form the tower she hit her head on the last pillar of the staircases \u201cDid that hurt\nMadam?\u201daskedaguard\u201cNoIfeltnothing\u201drepliedtheformerQueendrenchedinblack. The\nwidow Carpet was taken to a Woman\u2019s Prison. A man waiting a the reception was woken\nup by a guard (The man had worked at Versailles once as a pastry maker and instantly\nrecognised the former Queen) \u201cName Please\u201d he asked, Marie Antoinette replied blankly\n\u201cLook at me\u201d. Deprived of everything the former Queen spend days in her hot cell, reading\nbooks, making clothes for her daughter, and playing with a ring on her finger passing it on\nto finger to finger. Every now and then the Queen would look up when hearing of what\nsounded like a harp being played, reminding her of distant days long gone. The existence\nof the Royal family was a weak one of suffering and pain, Marie Antoinette\u2019s sister wrote\n\u201cMaybe natural death is the best fate\u201d about Marie Antoinette. Finally in October 1793 a\nfull 4 years into the French revolution Antoinette was trailed and found guilty of Treason\namong other things. She was executed on the 16th October 1793 by Guillotine, Before\nleaving for her death it was rumoured she said \u201cNow I shall take my place in hell, with my\nmother and two emperor brothers, and as for my fat pompous of a husband, I want nothing\nmore to do with him\u201d. However Marie Antoinette properly did not say this, just another\npublic stunt form the media. Her final words were simply \u201csorry mousier I did not do it on\npurpose\u201d after stepping on the executioners foot. Madam Elizabeth followed her brother\nand sister in law foot steps to the blade a year later. Louis-Charles died alone in his cell in\n1795. Marie Therese however out lived the revolution and lived until the 1850s becoming\nQueen of France for 20 minutes, and holding the title her mother made so iconic \u201cDauphine\nof France\u201d. She died in Austria, places of exile (In which she spent most of her life) include,\nScotland, Kent and Austria. Returning to France for a brief period of time before being\nforced to leave by Napoleon who said \u201cShe was the only man in her family\u201d when Marie\nTherese gathered an army and refused to leave France.\n86 Storming of the Bastille\n8.6 Storming of the Bastille\nFigure 30 The storming of the Bastille, July 14 1789\nOn July 14, 1789, the revolting Paris mob stormed the Bastille. While only seven prisoners\nwere housed behind its walls, none of whom could be considered political in any way,\nthis event was essential because it symbolized that the people were no longer standing\nfor the power of the nobles and the king, or the rising of the people against the tyranny\nof absolutism. The fall of the Bastille was also the first time, but certainly not the last,\nduring the Revolution that popular mobs would rise up and take action outside of the\nlegislature. These later risings, known in French as journees, would prove to be both\nextremely influential on public opinion and a cause for major hand-wringing on the part of\nthe legislature, who did not want to risk a massive popular revolution as opposed to the\ncontrolled \u201dbourgeois\u201d revolution.\n8.7 New Governments\nThe revolutionaries in France established a new government in order to accomplish what\nthey desired.\n87 Chapter 08 - Revolution in France\n8.7.1 National Assembly 1789-1791\nThe members of the National Assembly came from the members of the third estate in the\nEstates General. These members tended to be from the upper middle class, or bourgeois,\nandwereoftenreferredtoas\u201dJacobins\u201dsincetheyfrequentlymetinJacobinclubstodiscuss\nthe revolution.\nThelowerthirdestate, ortherestofthecitizenry, ledthefightingarmoftherevolutionand\nthe National Assembly at this time. They did not, however, take part in the government.\nThe urban middle class led the storming on the Bastille and the march on Versailles.\nEfforts to Remake Society\nThe National Assembly took a number of actions to remake society. They established\nsocial equality, and signed the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, which was a\nsocial contract. It provided for freedom of religion, taxation of equality, legal equality, and\nfreedomofpressandexpression. Theywroteaconstitutionthatestablishedaconstitutional\nmonarchy with a parliament. The parliament was to be run by the bourgeois, who were\nconsidered \u201dactive\u201d citizens, while the rest of the citizens were considered \u201dpassive\u201d citizens\nandwouldnotbeallowedtotakepartingovernment. Peopleingovernmentweretoprogress\nbased upon merit. Finally, the National Assembly established the Civil Constitution of the\nClergy (1790), which clergymen would eventually be required to swear an oath to in 1791.\nIn addition to nationalizing church property, the Civil Constitution also abolished religious\nvows and turned all Church clerics (including monks and nuns) into civil servants who\nreceived their pay and assignments not from Rome, but from Paris. While this was initially\nwell-received by many Frenchmen who applauded the \u201dbringing home\u201d of the church, the\nsubsequent punitive measures taken against clergy who did not swear the oath (also known\nas the refractory clergy) would be a cause of great resentment in the Western provinces,\nand was one of the causes behind the Vendee rising in 1793.\n8.7.2 Legislative Assembly 1791-1792\nThe provisions of the National Assembly established what was supposed to be a permanent\nconstitutional monarchy, the Legislative Assembly, with Louis XVI as the monarch. How-\never, the Legislative Assembly failed very quickly for a number of reasons. The lower third\nestate felt abandoned by the bourgeois politically. In addition, the Legislative Assembly\nfailed to fix the food and unemployment problems. As a result, the working men of France,\nor the sans-culottes, rose against the Legislative Assembly.\n8.7.3 War with Austria and Prussia\nEmigres, or nobility that had fled France during the Revolution, in Austria wanted the\nAustrian government to crush the Revolution. Other nations feared revolution in their own\ncountries. Austria signed the Declaration of Pillnitz (1791), which stated that if the other\npowersattackFrance,sowouldAustria. TheFrenchinterpretedthisasavirtualdeclaration\nof war.\n88 New Governments\nThe Brunswick Manifesto (1792) by Prussia stated that the Prussians would punish the\ncitizens of Paris if they did anything to harm Louis XVI or Marie Antionette. Prussia and\nAustria allied for the balance of power, in order to weaken France. The draining of war on\nthe newly formed government also contributed to its downfall.\n8.7.4 Convention 1792-1795\nFigure 31 Anonymous Portrait of Maximilien de\nRobespierre c. 1793 (Carnavalet Museuma).\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnavalet%20Museum\nThe Convention was an emergency republic with universal male suffrage. The leading body\nof the Convention was the Committee of Public Safety, who worked to suppress dissent\nand protect the revolution. The Committee was composed of twelve members, of whom the\ndominantindividualwasMaximiliendeRobespierre. TheleadershipoftheConventionsplit\ninto two factions: the Montagnards (or \u201dMountain\u201d), who was more radical and included\nRobespierre, and the Girondin, which was more middle class.\nThe Convention had a number of issues to address. First, and perhaps most importantly,\nthey were actively engaged in war with Prussia and Austria. They instituted the first draft,\n89 Chapter 08 - Revolution in France\ncalled the levee en masse , and a nationalist feeling rose among troops. In 1794, the French\narmy invaded Austria and was successful.\nIn addition, the Convention needed to remake society. Members instituted \u201ddechristianiza-\ntion,\u201d which was essentially the purging of Christians in France.\nThe Convention also needed to address the food problem, and established the \u201dGeneral\nMaximum\u201d that controlled bread prices and wages.\nFinally, the Convention needed to stop the counter-revolution and write a new constitution.\nDuring a period known as \u201dThe Terror,\u201d Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety\nutilized the newly invented guillotine to kill tens of thousands of counter-revolutionaries.\nThe Convention successfully wrote a new constitution, establishing a government known as\nthe Directory as a permanent republic.\nOn 27 July (\u201d9 Thermidor\u201d in the Revolutionary Calendar) 1794, Robespierre himself was\narrested, and was executed the next day. The resulting \u201dThermidorian Reaction\u201d was a\nresponsetoFrance\u2019sswingtotheleft,duringwhichthegovernmentbrieflywenttotheright,\nand finally back to the center. The Jacobins and other Montagnards were replaced with\nthe more moderate Girondins (Bourgeois), and many Montagnard members were executed.\n8.7.5 Directory 1795-1799\nThe Directory was the first constitutional republic, which had an executive body of five di-\nrectors, as well as a bicameral legislative body consisting of the Council of Ancients and the\nCouncilof500. In1797,thefirstfreeelectionswereheld,andthepeopleofFranceastonished\nmembers of the Directory by electing a majority of royalists to the legislature. Unwilling\nto risk the reversal of everything achieved since 1789, left-wing members of the legislature,\ncombined with support from the military, purged the Directory of rightist members in the\ncoup of 18 Fructidor, which established a dictatorship controlled by left-wing Directors.\nHowever, people grew fearful of a possible return of the Terror, thus, when Napoleon Bona-\nparte and Abbe Sieyes launched the coup of 18 Brumaire to end the Directory and instead\nestablish the Consulate, there was little opposition.\npt:Hist\u00f3ria da Europa/Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o na Fran\u00e7a1 vi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/C\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng t\u01b0 s\u1ea3n Ph\u00e1p2\nhttp://pt.wikibooks.org/wiki/Hist%C3%B3ria%20da%20Europa%2FRevolu%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20na%\n1\n20Fran%C3%A7a\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FC%C3%\n2\nA1ch%20m%E1%BA%A1ng%20t%C6%B0%20s%E1%BA%A3n%20Ph%C3%A1p\n90 9 Chapter 09 - Napoleon Bonaparte and the\nRise of Nationalism\n9.1 Introduction\nFigure 32 Napoleon I of France, by\nJacques-Louis David.\nIn a better attempt to prevent freely elected royalists from taking control of the Directory\nin 1799, members of the bourgeois sent Napoleon Bonaparte and his army to defend the\nDirectory and the annulment of the elections. However, Napoleon took advantage of this\nsituation and in the Coup of Brumaire took control of the nation.\n91 Chapter 09 - Napoleon Bonaparte and the Rise of Nationalism\n9.2 The Consulate 1799-1804\nNapoleon seized control and initially installed an enlightened despotism known as the Con-\nsulate. During this time, Napoleon instituted a number of important Enlightened reforms.\nThe most important of these is his Napoleonic Code, which provided freedom of religion,\na uniform law codes, social and legal equality, property rights, and end feudal dues. He\nalso implemented a state-wide compulsory education, known as the University of France.\nIn 1801 he ended dechristianization.\n9.3 The Empire 1804-1814\nFigure 33 Napoleonic Empire, 1811: France in dark\nblue, satellite states in light blue\nNapoleon declared himself French Emperor and became a military dictator. Napoleon\nwas undefeated against his three main continental enemies, defeating Austria, Russia, and\nPrussia multiple times. During his tenure, he took control of large amounts of mainland\nEurope. However, Napoleon failed to subdue England, and was defeated in his attempt to\ncrushtheEnglishNavyattheBattleofTrafalgarbyAdmiralNelson. Asaresult, Napoleon\nemployed the Continental System, a method of economic warfare. He prohibited trade with\nthe British by blockading all coasts of Europe from English export. Unfortunately for\nNapoleon, this failed, as the British still were able to smuggle goods into Europe, and were\nalso able to trade with their colonies, Asia, and the United States. Napoleon eliminated\n92 The Congress of Vienna 1814-1815\nthe Holy Roman Empire, and in 1806 consolidated it into 40 states and named it the\nConfederation of the Rhine.\nAfter Alexander I of Russia withdrew from the Continental System, Napoleon invaded\nRussia in 1812. For the first time, Napoleon failed, as the Russian army employed scorched\nearth tactics to defeat Napoleon\u2019s army. However, Napoleon quickly raised a new army, but\nthis army was crushed by the Quadruple Alliance of England, Austria, Russia, and Prussia\nat the Battle of Nations/Leipzig in 1813. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba, but\nhe managed to escape and return in 1815 in a period known as the Hundred Days. The\nQuadruple Alliance again crushed his new army at the Battle of Waterloo, led by the great\nBritish General Wolsey (Duke of Wellington). Napoleon was then exiled to the island of\nSaint Helena where he died in 1821.\n9.4 The Congress of Vienna 1814-1815\nThe Quadruple Alliance assembled at the Congress of Vienna to create a post-Napoleonic\nEurope. Their representatives were Castlereagh of England, who assembled the Quadruple\nAlliance, Talleyrand of France, Metternich of Austria, and Alexander I of Russia.\nThe Congress of Vienna was incredibly lenient toward France. It simply restored the old\nboundaries and restored Louis XVIII to the throne. It imposed no reparations. This was\ndone because the allies desired a stable, prosperous France that would not threaten them\nwith revolution or invasion.\n9.5 The Restoration of Louis XVIII Bourbon\nLouis XVIII did not wipe out the gains of the Revolution. Rather, out of fear of revolution,\nhe signed the Charter of 1814 that provided legal equality, offices open to all men, a two\nchamber parliament, Napoleonic civil code, and the abolition of feudalism.\n9.6 A Shift in Foreign Policy\nAfter Napoleon\u2019s fall, European foreign policy took a major shift. While preserving the\nbalance of power was still important, now much more prominently featured in war would\nbe advocates of liberalism (revolutionaries, republicans, nationalists) versus conservatism\nor the \u201dOld Regime\u201d (the monarchy, aristocrats, clergymen).\nOldRegimemonarchs,ledbyKlemensWenzelvonMetternichofAustria,usedtheCongress\nSystem, also known as the Concert of Europe, to prevent revolution and war. At the\nCongress System the leading of nations of Europe worked together to prevent the outbreak\nof revolution in each nation.\n93 Chapter 09 - Napoleon Bonaparte and the Rise of Nationalism\n9.7 A New Nationalism\nMany of the territories occupied by Napoleon during his Empire began to feel a new sense\nof nationalism. During the occupation, Napoleon destroyed and disallowed many nation\u2019s\nindividual cultures, and the people of these nations greatly resented this. As a result,\nNapoleon\u2019s conquests spurred a new nationalism in the occupied nations, particularly in\nGermany and Italy, at a level that had never previously existed.\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Napoleon Bonaparte v\u00e0 s\u1ef1 ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n c\u1ee7a Ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a d\u00e2n t\u1ed9c1\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%\n1 2FNapoleon%20Bonaparte%20v%C3%A0%20s%E1%BB%B1%20ph%C3%A1t%20tri%E1%BB%83n%20c%E1%\nBB%A7a%20Ch%E1%BB%A7%20ngh%C4%A9a%20d%C3%A2n%20t%E1%BB%99c\n94 10 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\n10.1 Introduction\nTheearlynineteenthcenturywasdominatedbytheaftermathoftheFrenchRevolutionand\nNapoleonic Wars. Although Napoleon was defeated in 1815 and the Bourbon monarchy\nrestored to France, many European states were transformed by the 25 years of conflict.\nStatessuchasPrussia,AustriaandtheNetherlandsfoundthemselvesexpandedbythepeace\nsettlement of 1815. Conversely, other countries, most notably Poland, were dissolved in this\nprocess of state consolidation. These national upheavals were accompanied by a heightened\nsense of nationalism amongst the population of many states, which had been encouraged\nby Enlightenment ideas, spread throughout Europe by the Napoleonic conquests.\nIn the decades following the peace of 1815 many European countries were beset by social\nconflicts as the populations sought to assert their rights against the often autocratic rulers\nof their states. This was to produce what the historian Eric Hobsbawn has dubbed the\nAge of Revolutions , as the tensions within states were to frequently erupt into large-scale\npolitical upheavals, such as the French revolutions of 1830 and 1848.\n10.2 Europe in the Age of Revolutions\nEurope was a turbulent continent in the period after the Napoleonic Wars. Although the\nTreaty of Vienna had tried to restore many European states to their pre-war states, the\ninfluence of the war years was significant, particularly the Enlightenment ideas that were\nspread throughout Europe by Napoleon\u2019s armies. The result was an age of revolutions.\nA distinctive feature was the manner in which waves of revolutions could sweep through\nEurope,mostnotablyin1830and1848,whenpopularrevoltinFranceinfluencedthepeople\nof other states to rebel against their rulers.\n10.2.1 Belgium\nPrior to the nineteenth century the southern part of the Netherlands had been dominated\nby foreign powers, most notably the Hapsburg states of Spain and Austria. However, the\ncritical geographical position of the area led the major powers of Europe, in the Treaty of\nVienna, to cede the territory to the Dutch Republic in 1815, to create the United Kingdom\nof the Netherlands. This caused resentment within the region; local liberals resented the\nautocratic nature of the Dutch king, whilst conservative Catholics disliked the dominance\nof Dutch Protestantism.\n95 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nThese tensions were to lead to the revolution of 1830, when the region declared itself in-\ndependent, taking the name Belgium in reference to the Celtic tribes who had lived in the\narea in ancient times. The response of the Dutch government came in August 1831, when\nthe Dutch Army set off on a so called \u201dTen Days Campaign\u201d. It was very successful, as the\nDutch army pushed into the heart of Belgium within just a few days, also capturing the key\ncity of Antwerp. However, after a desperate Belgian appeal for French help, French troops\ncrossedtheborderintoBelgium. WithRussiatoobusytoguardtheDutchback, bothsides\nagreed to a ceasefire. On December 20, 1830, the European powers recognized Belgium\u2019s\nde facto independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was not until April 19,\n1839 however, that the Treaty of London signed by the European powers (including the\nNetherlands) recognized Belgium as an independent and neutral country.\n10.2.2 France\nThe Treaty of Vienna saw the Bourbon monarchy restored to France. Although the first\nkingafterthisrestoration, LouisXVIII,managedthecountrywell, hissuccessor, CharlesX,\nproved to be unpopular. An autocratic ruler, Charles passed a number of acts that stripped\naway power promised by Louis to the people. This concluded in the July Ordinances, which\ndissolved Parliament. As a result, the people of France broke into revolution, known as the\nJuly Revolution, replacing Charles X with Louis-Philippe Orleans in what is known as the\nJuly Monarchy.\n96 Europe in the Age of Revolutions\nThe 1848 Revolution and Louis Napoleon\nFigure 34 Louis Bonaparte\nIn February 1848, the citizens revolted again, this time forming a provisional government\nled by two men, Lamartine, a political republican who advocated freemarket, and Blanc, a\nsocial republican, who advocated socialism. Blanc created a system known as the national\nworkships that provided employment to the masses in France.\nThe National Assembly of 1848 established universal male suffrage, and the people that\nyear elected virtually no socialists. The new government threw out the national workshops,\nresulting in a revolt by the people. The people, looking to the former glory of France,\ninstalled Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, relative of Napoleon Bonaparte, the throne.\nPresident Louis Napoleon Bonaparte rebuilt central Paris, installing new apartments,\nstraight, long, and wide streets, sewage, and sanitation. He also widened the streets in\nParis, in an attempt to subvert future revolution, since in the past, revolutionaries in\nFrance had used the streets to barricade themselves.\nEmperor Napoleon III is often referred to as the socialist emperor because he gave many\nsocialized programs to the citizens. He gave hospitals, socialized medicine, the right to\nunionize and strike, shorter hours, injured worker homes, a revamped prison system, and\nmore.\n97 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nHowever, Napoleon III was also militarily inept. He chose to get involved in wars which\nhe didn\u2019t have to, trying to live up to the glory of Napoleon I. He was defeated in his\ninvolvement in the Italian unification movement where he sent troops to Rome to protect\nthe Pope, in his involvement with the Mexican Empire from 1862-1867, and in the Franco-\nPrussian War from 1870-1871, during which he was actually captured by the Prussians.\n10.2.3 Great Britain\nWhilstreforminmanyEuropeanstateswasonlyachievedwiththeaidofbloodyrevolution,\nBritish parliamentary democracy meant that Great Britain managed to reform and mod-\nernise relatively peacefully. The most notable instance of this is the Reform Act of 1832,\nwhich reallocated seats in the House of Commons to address the new industrial cities of\nBritain, and increased suffrage from 500,000 men to 800,000 men. This was to be followed\nthirty years later by the Reform Act of 1867 granted suffrage to 1/3 of British men. By\n1884, 2 to 4.5 million men had suffrage in Britain, including urban workers.\nBritain saw other reforms, such as the 1833 Factory Act, which outlawed the employment\nof children under the age of 9 and limited the workdays of all children. The Mines Act of\n1842 was a similar piece of reformist legislation, formally prohibiting women and children\nfrom working underground.\nBritish Corn Laws\nFigure 35 British Prime Minister Robert\nPeel\n98 Europe in the Age of Revolutions\nOne of the most entertaining pieces of political reform during this era was not related to\nworkinglife, buttotheeconomicmanagementofBritain. TheCornLawsweretaxesplaced\non imported goods to protect Britain\u2019s own goods. They forced the British people to buy\nthe more expensive and lower quality British grain by putting a tariff on French grain,\nwhich tended to be less expensive and higher quality. The goal was to keep British money\nin Britain, rather than being spent on importing French grain.\nThe Corn Laws were passed by the members of the Tory party in Parliament. The Tories\nwere populated by the Landed Gentry. The Whigs, which represented the working class,\nmerchants, factory owners, and so forth in Britain, were opposed to the Corn Laws, but\nbecause the Tories controlled Parliament, they were unable to stop the passage of the Corn\nLaws. The expensive price of British grain necessitated a rise in wages, and factory owners\nsuch as David Ricardo were forced to pay higher wages so that their workers could afford\nthe food. Ricardo thus concluded that the Corn Laws simply redistributed wealth from the\nindustrialists to the landowners.\nIn 1819, 80,000 people gathered in Manchester demanding the repeal of the Corn Laws.\nBritishsoldiersopenedfire, killing11demonstrators, inwhatbecameknownasthePeterloo\nMassacre. As a result, the Anti-Corn Law League was established in Manchester, and used\npamphlets, mass demonstrations, and torchlight parades to protest the Corn Laws.\nIn 1846, the Corn Laws were repealed under Prime Minister Robert Peel. The government\nwas still led by Tories, but the Irish Potato Famine led to the repeal, demonstrating the\nnew power of the industrialists in England.\n10.2.4 Spain\nSpain was a country in turmoil during the age of revolutions. Occupied by Napoleon from\n1808 to 1814, a brutal \u201dwar of independence\u201d was waged against the occupiers that led to an\nemergent Spanish nationalism. An era of reaction against the liberal ideas associated with\nrevolutionary France followed the war, personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII and\u2014to\na lesser extent\u2014his daughter Isabella II. Ferdinand\u2019s rule included the loss of the Spanish\ncolonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s. A\nseries of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans\nagainstconservatives,culminatingintheCarlistWarsbetweenthemoderateQueenIsabella\nand her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos. Disaffection with Isabella\u2019s government\nfrom many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several\nrevolutionaryattemptsagainstthegovernment. Twooftheserevolutionsweresuccessful,the\nmoderate Vicalvarada or \u201dVic\u00e1lvaro Revolution\u201d of 1854 and the more radical la Gloriosa\n(Glorious Revolution) in 1868. The latter marks the end of Isabella\u2019s monarchy. The brief\nrule of the liberal king Amadeo I of Spain ended in the establishment of the First Spanish\nRepublic, onlytobereplacedin1874bythepopular, moderateruleofAlfonsoXIIofSpain,\nwhich finally brought Spain into a period of stability and reform.\n10.2.5 1848 Revolutions in the Rest of Europe\nIn Italy unemployment, demands for land, and higher wages led to revolts. King Charles\nAlbert led a military campaign against Austria, while Mazzini attempted to organize a\n99 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nrepublic in Rome. The movement largely failed, however, because different groups of na-\ntionalists could not agree on goals. The Austria defeated the campaign, and Napoleon\nBonaparte sent troops to Rome.\nIn Germany revolts started in order to achieve more liberal rights, but the goals were soon\nreplaced with nationalistic sentiments. The Constituent Assembly, under the direction of\n800 delegates from the German states, offered Frederick William IV, King of Prussia, the\ncrown of a unified Germany. However, this movement failed as well, as the Constituent\nAssembly had no actual power and Frederick would not accept a crown \u201dfrom the gutter\u201d.\nPrussian troops put down revolts in Berlin as well as other revolts throughout Germany.\nIn Austria, demands for political reform and nationalism created demands for autonomy.\nMetternich fled to England, and Emperor Ferdinand fled in favor of Franz Joseph. Revolts\noccurred in Vienna, Prague, and Hungary. A Slavic congress was set up in Prague, Hun-\ngarians demanded autonomous rule. Eventually, with the aid of Russia, Austria was able\nto suppress the revolutions.\n10.2.6 The Era of Realpolitik\nBefore 1848, idealism and reason were at the forefront of people\u2019s minds. However, after\n1848, the concept of Realpolitik and action arose. This new toughness of mind rejected\nhigh-minded ideology for action, and marked the end of the Enlightenment.\nOn the right, Otto von Bismarck of Germany took Realpolitik actions, manipulating the\nEms Telegram in order to spur war with France (Franco-Prussian War) and thus assist the\nprocess of German unity. Emperor Napoleon III also did so, widening the streets of Paris\nduring his reconstruction of Paris in order to prevent barricading in the case of revolution.\nFinally, Cavour of Italy is an excellent example of a practitioner of Realpolitik, as he got\nNapoleon III to attack Austria over Lombardy-Venetia.\nOn the left, Marx was a practitioner of Realpolitik, advocating violent revolution among\nthe proletariat in order to install a new communist system.\n10.3 Industrial Revolution\nThe shift that precipitated many of the conflicts of the early nineteenth century was the\nindustrial revolution. The growing industrial base of many European countries was to\nencourage urbanization, often at the expense of the living conditions of the workers. This\nwas coupled with new agrarian technologies which required fewer people to work the land,\nwhilstproducinggreateragriculturalyields. Insomecountriesthisprecipitatedanindustrial\nrevolution,whereurbanindustryplayedanincreasinglydominantroleintheeconomy. This\nprocess was first seen in Britain, Prussia and the Netherlands in the late eighteenth and\nearly nineteenth century whilst other countries, such as France, Italy and the United States\nof America were to industrialize in the late nineteenth century. Some states, such as Russia\nand Austria, failed to industrialize significantly in this period, a factor that would lead to\nlater difficulties during the First World War.\n100 Industrial Revolution\n10.3.1 The Prefiguration of Industry\nThe first evidence of industrial production can be found in the large cities of early modern\nEurope. Even the modest size of European capitals at the beginning of the modern period\nallowed for a specialization of trade and, as the cities grew, production increasingly took\nplace in specialist workshops. Tradesmen, who had previously taken only one or two ap-\nprentices, began to take larger teams of workers, a process that transformed itself into the\npaid employment of labor in industrial enterprise. A similar shift took place in rural areas,\nwith what was known as \u201dputting out\u201d or \u201dcottage industry\u201d, where agricultural workers\nwould take raw materials from contractors and use them to produce finished goods.\nDespite these developments little could be done without a proper transportation system,\nwhich would allow goods to be moved and marketed. At the beginning of the eighteenth\ncentury the cost of transporting goods overland was prohibitively expensive for all but the\nshortest journeys.\n10.3.2 Beginnings of Industry\nThe age of industry for Europe began with slow progress in the 1780s. Western Europe\ntended to advance more quickly than the east. Britain initially led the way. Progress\nremained slow until the 1850s, because most people continued to use old methods, and\npopulation increases reduced the benefits of industrialization. As a result, the industrial\nage did not start in continental Europe until after 1815, and was not complete in Britain\nuntil 1850.\nIn 1750, Britain was only slightly ahead of France in its industrial production. By 1830, its\nindustrialization was at twice the level of France, and by 1860, three times. Other countries\nwerefurtherbehind; muchofEurope\u2019sprogresswasretardedbypoliticalandsocialturmoil,\nas well as constant warfare. Industrialization also was limited by lack of transportation,\nreluctance to cease traditional business practices, and lack of technology.\nStephenson\u2019s rocket, a train engine, allowed wagons to be pulled along railroad tracks,\nallowing for the quick transportation of materials, goods, people, and communication. Pop-\nulation increased rapidly across Europe. Finally, the steam-powered engine was invented\nand improved, allowing for mechanization in industry.\nBy1815,continentalEuropehadstartedtoseeprogress. Itsindustrializationwasfacilitated\nby a large skilled labor force, strong governments, and no need to develop new ideas as\nBritain had already set a precedent for other nations to follow. European governments\nbecame much more involved in industrialization, building an infrastructure of railroads and\ncanals. The German government created the Zollverein1, a customs-free trade union, which\nallowed goods to move freely within the German states without being hampered by tariffs.\nGovernmentsalsoplayedaroleinbanking, andtheyallowedbankstobecomecorporations,\nsuch as Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of Paris.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein\n101 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nBy 1851, Britain was the \u201dworkshop of the world.\u201d Britain had 2/3 of the world\u2019s known\ncoal supply, and 1/2 of its iron. Centers of continental industrialization included Belgium,\nFrance, and Germany.\n10.3.3 Social Impact of the Industrial Revolution\nFigure 36 Over London by Rail Gustave Dor\u00e9a c\n1870. Shows the densely populated and polluted\nenvironments created in the new industrial cities\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9\nThe Industrial Revolution resulted in poor urban living conditions with no sanitation. Ur-\nbanandindustrialgrowthwentbeyondthestate\u2019scontrol. Publicdrunkennessasareaction\nto the dismal lifestyle became prominent, and the cities were filthy and living conditions\ntight. Life expectancy was very short, and disease was rampant. New social classes, par-\nticularly the industrial middle class and urban workers, emerged as well. The standard\nof living decreased for many, with low wages and high prices, as well as horrible working\nconditions and the employment of children.\nNoticing the poor crowded city conditions and impoverished workers in industrial Europe,\nseveral economists expressed their pessimistic predictions on the future of the industrial\nsociety.\nThomas Malthus (1766\u20131834)\nThomasMalthus2 wasanEnglisheconomistwithagrimpredictionforthefuture. An Essay\non the Principle of Population3 stated that the population was outgrowing the food supply,\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%20Malthus\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%20Essay%20on%20the%20Principle%20of%20Population\n102 Industrial Revolution\nand that this would inevitably cause a \u201dgreat hunger,\u201d or massive food shortage. Malthus\nsuggested,asasolutiontothisproblem,marryinglaterinlifetoslowthepopulationgrowth,\nbut he was not optimistic that this plan would ever come to fruition.\nDavid Ricardo (1772-1823)\nDavid Ricardo4, in his Iron Law of Wages5 , predicted that the income of wage-earning\nworkers would remain below or just near subsistence levels, despite any attempts to raise\nwages.\n10.3.4 British Working Class Responses to Industrialisation\nLuddism\nThe Luddites6 were a group of workers opposed to the effects of the mechanisation of\nindustry, particularly in textiles. The advent of large scale spinning and weaving machines\nmeant that textiles could be produced at lower costs than previously, undercutting the\nprices of the traditional cottage industry of handloom weavers.\nThe attacks of the Luddites began in 1811 and were targeted at the machinery of factory\nandworkshopowners. ThecampaignsoftheLudditeswereoftencloselytargetedatspecific\nforms of machinery and, despite the modern connotations of the name, the group were not\nopposed to progress in principle.\nThe name of the group is derived from its fictional leader, Ned Ludd. This figure was used\nasafocalpointfordemonstrations, andtodistractattentionfromtherealleadersofvarious\nprotests.\nThe Luddites were followed some years later by the Swing rioters who, following a mythical\nleader, Captain Swing, opposed the mechanization of agriculture. The Swing riots mostly\noccurred during the early 1830s and were put down with often severe force.\nTrade Unionism\nThe Luddites were, in essence, part of a reactive movement, fighting against the moderniza-\ntion of methods of production. An alternative, and often more effective, method of action,\nwas the organisation of workers into trade unions, where rights could be secured through\ncollectivebargainingandthethreatofstrikes. Whilstsuchmovementswereoftennotillegal\nin themselves, many of their actions were. It was, for instance, considered a criminal of-\nfenceforaworkmantobreakhiscontractandstrikingworkerscouldbechargedforoffences\nrelating to conspiracy or breaches of public order.\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David%20Ricardo\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%20Law%20of%20Wages\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddites\n103 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nDespite this there was a sustained demand on the part of the workers that their rights be\nrecognizedandthepersistentcampaignsofworkerseventuallyachievedthelegalrecognition\nof unions.\nChartism\nChartism7 was the first large-scale working class political movement.\nThe London Working Men\u2019s Association8 wrote reform goals in a charter, with six points:\n1. Universal male suffrage\n2. Annual election of House of Commons\n3. Secret ballots\n4. Equal electoral districts (to prevent \u201drotten boroughs\u201d)\n5. Abolition of property requirements for the House of Commons\n6. Salaries of members of the House of Commons\nAlthough the Chartist movement did not see immediate success in its aims, all of the main\npoints of the charter, with the exception of annual elections, were adopted by the early\ntwentieth century.\n10.4 Society and Culture\n10.4.1 Capitalism\nIndustry of Britain, western Europe, and the United States developed within the system\nof capitalism9. \u201dCapital\u201d is a medium of exchange for property or services that are valued.\nCapitalist systems require the laissez-faire10 principle of minimal government intervention.\n10.4.2 Republicanism\nRepublicanismadvocatedliberty, fraternity, andequality, andwasinfavorofConstitutions,\nParliaments, and democracies. It opposed the monarchy, aristocracy, and the church. Re-\npublicans tended to be students, writers, members of the intelligentsia, and also workers.\nRepublicans were supporters of the French Revolution and its ideals.\n10.4.3 Liberalism\nLiberalism11, or classic liberalism, at the time advocated free trade, laissez faire, constitu-\ntions, parliaments, andnoviolence. Itdidn\u2019tadvocatedemocracy, butratherconstitutional\nmonarchy. Liberals tended to be middle class merchants and professionals.\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartism\n8 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London%20Working%20Men%27s%20Association\n9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capitalism\n10 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laissez-faire\n11 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism\n104 Society and Culture\n10.4.4 Conservatism\nConservatism12 rose as a reaction to the liberal ideas that began with the violence, terror,\nand social disorder of the French Revolution13. It was supported by the traditional ruling\nclass, as well as by the peasants. Conservatives believed in order of the society and state,\nbased on faith and tradition. Metternich14 was the champion of Conservatism and tried to\npreserve its ideals and the Old Regime through the Congress System. Conservatives were\nopposedtotheEnlightenmentanditseffects, andwereanti-revolution, anti-democracy, and\nanti-nationalism. They preferred tradition, gradual reform, and the maintenance of the Old\nRegime.\n10.4.5 Socialism\nSocialism15 is the theory or system of social organization in which the means of productions\nand distribution of goods are owned collectively or by a central government authority. The\nidea was fostered to combat the industrial society that allowed millions to toil endlessly\nwhile a few owners reaped all the benefits of their labor. Socialists argued that liberalism\nwas fragmenting society, and that socialism would reunite it. After 1815, socialism became\nthe new radical doctrine, especially in France. Socialists fought to protect the interests\nof the workers rather than capitalists, and argued that wealth is unfairly distributed and\nthat thus workers deserve a larger share. Socialism was a diverse political philosophy and\nencompassed the views of many different thinkers, such as Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen.\nHenri de Saint-Simon\nHenry de Saint-Simon16 believed that the elite of society lacked the skills necessary to\nbe valued so highly. He believed that rewards should be in proportion to one\u2019s social\ncontribution,andthatsocietyshouldberunbyqualifiedtechnocrats,oratechnicallyskilled\nelite.\nCharles Fourier\nCharles Fourier17 was a French merchant, whose experiences of the French Revolution led\nhim to believe that free market capitalism in general, and speculation in particular, was\ndamagingtothewelfareofall. Hissolutionwastosuggestaplannedeconomy,basedaround\nidea communities known as phalanstries , where 1,620 people would live in a single building\nsurrounded by 5,000 acres of land. By centralising production, efficient agriculture and\nindustry could be achieved. Although his plans were never put into practice, his utopian\nsocialism was an important influence on later thinkers.\n12 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism\n13 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French%20Revolution\n14 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metternich\n15 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism\n16 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%20de%20Saint-Simon\n17 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%20Fourier\n105 Chapter 10 - Age Of Revolutions\nRobert Owen\nRobert Owen was a Welsh manufacturer. In his mills at New Lanark in Scotland he proved\nthat investing in the welfare of employees could be profitable. He provided his workers\nwith schools and free accommodation. By doing this Owen was rewarded with a hard-\nworking and loyal workforce, and his mills were some of the most profitable and productive\nin Britain.\nOwenwaslaterto investhisprofits in the communityof New Harmonyin the UnitedStates\nof America. The community was heavily reliant upon the leadership of Owen and quickly\nfoundered. AlthoughOwen\u2019scommunitiesdidnotlongoutlasthislifetime, histhinkingwas\nhighly influential amongst later socialists, and the term communist was originally coined to\ndescribe Owen\u2019s followers.\nKarl Marx (1818-1883)\nProbably the most important socialist thinker of the nineteenth century was the German\nwriter Karl Marx. Marx\u2019s rise to prominence began in the Year of Revolutions, 1848, with\nthe publication of The Communist Manifesto , a volume which he wrote with the help of\nFrederick Engels. The book was an attempt to create political tension between economic\nclasses around the world. He also wrote Das Kapital , a critique of capitalism that argues\nas to why Marx believed capitalism should fail. He sought to incite the violent revolution\nof the proletariat against the bourgeois. The proletariat described the working class, while\nthe bourgeois described the middle and upper classes that owned the means of production.\nThisrevolutionwouldbecausedbywhatMarxdescribedasahistoricclassstrugglebetween\nthesetwogroups. Afterthisrevolution, Marxarguedfortheformationofaclasslesssociety,\nin which no private property, religion, or government existed.\nMarx also advocated the concept of dialectical materialism. The theory states that history\nis driven by economic conditions and material private property inequality. This theory\nwas based on Hegel\u2019s dialectic theory, in which a thesis and antithesis are resolved into a\nsynthesis. The end of Marx\u2019s concept of dialectical history is the synthesis of communism\nbecause private property is prohibited. Marx believed that the rise of the proletariat was\ninevitable, even if he had never existed and written his book. This is what separates\nMarxism from Utopian Socialism - Utopian Socialism required the benevolent and peaceful\nsurrender of the means of production by capitalists.\n10.4.6 Utilitarianism\nProposed by Bentham, it suggested that the best form of government does the most good\nfor the greatest number of people.\n10.4.7 Nationalism\nNationalism was spawned by Napoleon\u2019s empire, and emphasized pride in one\u2019s language,\ntradition, culture, and religion. Nationalism caused conflict over boundaries in Europe.\nNationalists frequently looked to folktales, poems, songs, grammar, and dictionaries for\n106 Society and Culture\nsources of traditional culture in a nation. Nationalism especially came to rise in Germany,\nItaly, Ireland, Poland, and Hungary.\n10.4.8 Romantic Art\nThe romantic art movement took place in the 1800s, especially emphasizing emotion, imag-\nination, drama, disorder, and dark colors. Romantic art typically portrays the mystical\ncommunion of art and nature, typically using picturesque or exotic subjects. Romantic art\nreinforced individualism.\nFrancisco Goya (1746-1828)\nFigure 37 Francisco Goyaa. The Third of May 1808: The\nExecution of the Defenders of Madrid . 1814. Oil on canvas.\n345 x 266 cm.

To a large extent this was the product of the formation of new\nstates in Germany and Italy, and political reformations in older, established states, such\nas Britain and Austria. This internal stability, along with the technological advances of\nthe industrial revolution, meant that European states were increasingly able and willing to\npursue political power abroad.\nImperialism was not, of course, a concept novel to the nineteenth century. A number of\nEuropean states, most notably Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands, had carved out large\noverseas empires in the age of exploration. However, the new technologies of the nineteenth\ncentury encouraged imperial growth. Quinine1, for instance, allowed for the conquest of\ninland Africa, whilst the telegraph enabled states to monitor their imperial possessions\naround the world. When the value of these new technologies became apparent, the states\nof Europe began to take control of large swathes of territory in Africa and Asia, heralding\nin a new era of imperialism\n11.2 The States of Europe\n11.2.1 France\nAfterFrance\u2019sdefeatintheFranco-PrussianWar,BismarckrequiredFrancetoholdelections\nso that he could negotiate a peace. Elections were held for a provisional government,\nand monarchists were elected, which was unacceptable to revolutionaries of Paris. Paris\nresponded by forming its own government, a 40 member council or \u201dcommune\u201d with its\nown national guard. The commune established the equality of all citizens, promotion of\nwomen\u2019s rights, and communalworkshops. On May21, Adolph Theirs, leader of the French\nprovisional government, sent in troops to \u201drestore order\u201d in Paris. Members of the commune\nkilled the Archbishop, packed the Tuileries with gunpowder, and blew it up. When it was\nall over, however, 20,000 Parisians had been killed by the troops.\nThus began the 3rd Republic of France from 1871 until 1940. The 3rd Republic consisted\nof a ceremonial President and a two chamber Parliament with universal male suffrage.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine\n109 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\n11.2.2 Germany\nFigure 38 Otto von Bismarck\nThe idea of a German state had existed since the formation of the Kingdom of Germany in\nthe early Middle Ages. The kingdom was succeeded by the Holy Roman Empire, but the\nauthority of the emperors was weak, and the power of the central state declined until its\nfinal abolition in 1806. In 1815 the German-speaking territories were divided into around\n40 states, many of them small.\nThe beginnings of popular nationalism in Germany can be traced to Napoleon\u2019s invasion\nof German territory in 1806. Whilst this act helped precipitate the dissolution of the\n110 The States of Europe\nHoly Roman Empire, Napoleon\u2019s political machinations helped to encourage nationalist\nfeeling. Many people within the German heartlands wished to escape the influence of\nforeign autocrats, such as the emperors of France and Austria, and build their own state.\nThis broad feeling was encouraged by the works of eighteenth century German writers and\nphilosophers, such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and particularly Johann Gottfried von\nHerder. With his work on aesthetics, gothic art, and folk poetry, Herder encouraged an\nidea that the Germans had a rich common cultural heritage. Although Herder glorified the\nGermans, he was well travelled, feeling that every country had its unique features, and was\nworthy of some admiration.\nHowever, the unification of Germany was not solely due to nationalism. It is worth noting\nthat, in an era when Europe was increasingly dominated by large empires, many German\nstates were small to the point of insignificance. Most German rulers understood that there\nwasstrengthinworkingtogether. Thisunderstandingwastoleadtointer-stateco-operation\nacross the region, the most notable example being the Zollverein , the customs union that\nencompassed most of northern Germany by the early 1830s.\nThis variety of factors, both nationalistic and economic, were exploited by the conservative\nKing of Prussia, William I, and his chief minister, Otto von Bismarck. Both understood\nthe value of a unified German state, particularly one which excluded Austrian influence.\nWars of Unification\nWhilsthehadaclearideathattheunificationofGermanyshouldbehisgoal, Bismarckwas\na shrewd politician and exploited, rather than initiated, events. The complicated dynastic\nsuccessions within the German confederation proved to be a useful tool to this end.\nThe first such conflict was triggered by the Schleswig-Holstein problem. Schleswig and Hol-\nstein were German duchies whose ruler was also the Danish king, Frederick VII. Frederick\u2019s\ndeathin1863causedconsternationamongstGermannationalistsashissuccessor, Christian\nIX, decided to annex Schleswig and Holstein, and make the German duchies into part of\nthe Danish state. The Diet of the German Confederation demanded that this be prevented\nand encouraged Prussia and Austria, the only German states to have significant military\nstrength, to invade Denmark.\nThe war between Denmark and the Germany states was short and decisive and the Danes\nwere defeated in 1864. In the resultant peace treaty, the Danish king renounced his rights\nto the disputed territories of Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia and Austria respectively.\nThe occupation of Schleswig and Holstein was to prove the catalyst for the next German\nwar, the Seven Weeks War of 1866. Whilst control of these provinces was regulated by the\nGasteinConventionof1865, BismarckwasabletoprovoketheAustriansintodeclaringwar.\nThis was as decisive as the previous conflict. The meticulously planned Prussian advances\noutmaneuvered the Austrians, who were forced on the defensive, and quickly defeated.\nIn1867,PrussiaestablishedtheNorthGermanConfederation,madeupof21smallnorthern\nstates with a constitution and Kaiser Wilhelm as king. The small states were still in a\nvacuum, however, and needed some form of encouragement to join with Prussia.\n111 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\nIn 1870, Prince Leopold Hohenzollern was asked to take the crown in Spain, and France\ndemanded that the Prussians agree that no Hohenzollern ever take the Spanish throne in\nthe so-called \u201dEms Dispatch.\u201d Bismarck manipulated the telegram; his modifications made\nFrance and Germany appear more hostile than they actually were. After he released it\nto the press in Europe, France declared war on Prussia, and the remaining German states\njoined Prussia for protection.\nThe Franco-Prussian war lasted from 1870 to 1871, and resulted in the defeat of Emperor\nNapoleon III2. He was captured on September 2, 1870 at the Battle of Sedan. On January\n18, 1871, the German Empire was proclaimed at Versailles as a major snub to the French.\nOn May 1871, the Treaty of Frankfurt was signed, and France ceded Alsace-Lorraine and 5\nbillion gold francs to Germany.\n11.2.3 Italy\nThroughout the Middle Ages and early modern period Italy consisted of a patchwork of\nsmall states. Its urbanization and position in the Mediterranean meant that Italy was a\npoliticallyimportantregionand,formuchofthisperioditwasdominatedbyforeignpowers,\nmost notably the Bourbon dynasty which, during the eighteenth century, provided kings\nfor both France and Spain.\nThedominanceofforeignpowerswasbroughttoanendbytheNapoleonicwars. Napoleon\u2019s\nattempts to dominate the peninsula failed, and the monarchies of France and Spain were\nweakened by long years of war. Moreover, Napoleon had attempted to conglomerate much\nof Italy into a single state, a process that encouraged a sense of the Italians belonging to a\nnation. It is notable, for instance, that Napoleon provided Italy with its national flag, the\ngreen, white, and red tricolore .\nAlthough the Treaty of Vienna restored many of the small Italian states, nationalist feel-\ning remained, and was preserved by nationalistic and revolutionary groups, such as the\nCarbonari in southern Italy. These groups were inspired by revolutionary activity in other\nEuropean states. As a result, the early nineteenth century saw numerous small insurrec-\ntions against the autocrats ruling the Italian states, most notably with the French-inspired\nrevolts of 1831, which afflicted the Papal States. Such revolts were frequently small in scale,\nhowever, and were easily dealt with by the rulers of Italy.\nThe Italian Unification movement was led primarily by two central figures: Count Camillo\nBenso di Cavour, who supplied much of the ideology for the movement, and Giuseppe\nGaribaldi, who led the fighting of the movement. Cavour was the Prime Minister of\nPiedmont-Sardinia and served King Victor Emmanuel II. He built up the strength of\nPiedmont-Sardinia, establishing a strong army, a healthy economy, and political freedoms,\nsuch as freedom of the press. He gained the support of Napoleon III by promising him\nSavoy and Nice. Austria invaded Italy, but the Italians, aided by French troops, defeated\nthe Austrians at the battles of Magenta and Solferino.\nGaribaldi led the Red Shirts, or guerrilla fighters in Italy. He was a supporter of a repub-\nlic but conceded to a monarchy. He took his forces into southern Italy and successfully\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon%20III\n112 The States of Europe\nconquered Naples and the two Sicilies. Cavour sent troops south to stop Garibaldi from\ninvading Rome, which was occupied by French troops, but both sides met in Naples and\nsurprisinglybecameallies. In1861,theKingdomofItalywasdeclaredwithPiedmont\u2019sVic-\ntor Emmanuel as king. However, Italy\u2019s agrarian south and industrial north had difficulty\nuniting, and the unification was not complete until 1870, at the end of the Franco-Prussian\nWar.\n11.2.4 Russia\nFigure 39 Tsar Alexander II, his wife Marie and son, the future Alexander III\n113 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\nDuring the late 1800s, Russia began to work to increase its power and to overall westernize\nitself. The state was considered weaker in military terms than other nations and had lost\nto Britain and France in the Crimean War3 of 1853\u20131856. It had an autocratic tsar with\nno social contract, and serfdom still existed in Russia. There was a small middle class with\nmuch less industrialization.\nNicholasIcametopowerafterthedeathofhisbrother,AlexanderI.Hisreignbeganmarred\nby the Decembrist revolt of 1825 among the soldiers, some of whom supported his other\nbrother. Thus, Nicholas ruled through police action and use of the army.\nAlexander II came to power, using the defeat in the Crimean War as the major impetus to\nreform. He believed that Russia needed to follow the European model in order to become\nmore powerful. As a result, in 1861, he gave the serfs freedom. However, the serfs were still\nbound in many ways to their formal feudal dues. The former serfs were given only half of\nthe land, and the nobles were allowed to keep the other half. In addition, former serfs had\nto pay a communal redemption fee to their former lords.\nIn addition, Alexander II ended the secret police started by Nicholas I, and he created\npublic trials that had professional judges with state salaries as well as juries. Zemstvos\nwere created, which were local provincial councils, elected by the people, that dealt with\nlocal governmental issues such as roads and schools. Finally, Alexander reduced the draft\nfrom 25 years to 6 years.\nDespite Alexander\u2019s actions, unrest continued in Russia. Peasant revolutionaries resented\nthe redemption fees, and two new groups arose in Russia. The first, the nihilists, believed\nin nothing but science and rejected traditional society and culture. The second, the anar-\nchists, led by Mikhail Bakunin, set out to destroy any government, even a reformist tsar\nlike Alexander II. In 1881, an anarchist group known as the \u201dPeople\u2019s Will\u201d assassinated\nAlexander II with a bomb.\nRusso-Japanese War 1904\u20131905\nIn1860, theRussiansfoundedthecityofVladivostokonthePacificOcean, andbeganwork\non the Trans-Siberian Railroad to connect the East to the West. The Russo-Japanese war\nwas caused by the imperialist ambitions of Russia and Japan in Manchuria and Korea. In a\nnumber of key battles, the war resulted in a surprise victory for Japan in a peace agreement\nbrokered by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905.\nThe war resulted in the establishment of Japan as a major world power. Japan modeled\nEuropean industrialization and militarism, and increased its focus on China, gaining do-\nminion over Korea and establishing a claim to Manchuria. This expansion helped to cause\nWorldWarI.Thewarmarkedthefirstmajorvictoryofanon-westernpoweroverawestern\npower. As a result of the failure of the war in Russia, there was considerable discontent at\nhome, and this discontent led to the Revolution of 1905. Finally, as a result of the defeat,\nRussia turned its interests back to the West and the Balkans.\n3 Chapter11.3.2onpage117\n114 International Relations\nThe Revolution of 1905\nUnder Czar Nicholas II, who ruled from 1896 to 1917, the people believed that \u201dpapa czar\u201d\ncould hear their grievances and he would fix them. However, the people soon learned that\nthe czar could not be trusted.\nOn what has become known as \u201dBloody Sunday,\u201d June 22, 1905, a peaceful march of thou-\nsands of St. Petersburg workers to the Winter Palace by Father Gapon took place. The\nmarchers desired an eight hour work day, the establishment of a minimum wage, and a con-\nstitutional assembly. However, the Czar was not in the city, and Russian troops panicked\nand killed several hundred of the marchers.\nAs a result of Bloody Sunday, riots erupted throughout the country during 1905. Soviets\nformed the councils of workers in St. Petersburg and Moscow. Demands for representation\nincreased, and the moral bond between the people and the czar was broken. As a result,\nthe October Manifesto4 was granted to stop the disturbances. The October Manifesto\nprovided a constitution, a parliament called the Duma, and some civil liberties. The Duma\nactually possessed little power, however, and was primarily intended to divide and subdue\nthe revolutionaries.\nStolypin\u2019s Reforms\nPyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin was appointed minister by the Czar to address the problems\nof 1905. At Stolypin\u2019s recommendation, the czar ended redemption payments by the serfs,\nincreasedthepowerofthezemstvos, andallowedthepeasantstoowntheirlandoutrightfor\nthe first time. Peasants were now allowed to buy more land to increase their holdings, and\nwere even given loans. In some sense this was a sincere attempt at reform, and it created\na new class of prosperous, entrepreneurial peasants called Kulaks. However, for the most\npart this was again an attempt to subdue revolutionaries, as the ulterior motive of the plan\nwas to create a new class of peasant farmers who would be conservative and loyal to the\nczar. Under Stolypin\u2019s lead, revolutionaries and dissenters were brutally punished in what\nbecame known as \u201dStolypin Neckties.\u201d Stolypin was assassinated in 1911.\n11.3 International Relations\n11.3.1 Imperialism\nIn 1871, political stability of European nations resulted in renewed interest in imperialist\nendeavors. Britainbecameheavilyinvolvedincolonialism. Thenewly-unifiedGermanysaw\nexpansion as a sign of greatness. France also became involved in imperialist affairs due to\nforeign competition.\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October%20Manifesto\n115 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\nFigure 40 The white man\u2019s burden - a satiric take\nEurope\u2019s political, military and economic domination of the world gave birth to the British\nnotion of the white man\u2019s burden5. The white man\u2019s burden held that the white man had\nan obligation to forcefully spread their ideas and institutions with others. This, of course,\nwas utilized by some European governments as moral justification for their imperialistic\nforeign policies.\nIn addition, as a result of European industrialization, nations had an increased need for\nvarious resources, such as cotton, rubber, and fuel. Moreover, a high level of nationalism\nwas at the time being experienced across Europe, particularly as a result of Napoleon\u2019s\nEmpire. As nationalism grew at home, citizens began to desire more troops for their army,\nand thus colonies were needed to provide more troops, as well as naval bases and refueling\npoints for ships.\nBythelate1800s,anumberofnationsacrossEuropepossessednewcolonialterritories. Bel-\ngium had taken the Congo in central Africa. France controlled Algeria, and Italy controlled\nSomalia.\nIt was said that \u201dThe sun never sets on the British Empire.\u201d By this time, Britain\u2019s colonial\nterritories spanned the world, and during the late 1800s Britain expanded their territorial\npossessions to include Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.\n5 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white%20man%27s%20burden\n116 Science and Technology\nIn Asia, the British, Dutch and French all established or expanded their colonies.\n11.3.2 Crimean War\nThe Crimean War found its roots in the so-called \u201dEastern Question,\u201d or the question of\nwhat to do with the decaying Ottoman Empire.\nThe Crimean War was provoked by Russian tsar Nicholas I\u2019s continuing pressure on the dy-\ning Ottoman Empire, and by Russia\u2019s claims to be the protector of the Orthodox Christian\nsubjects of the Ottoman sultan.\nBritain and France became involved in order to block Russian expansion and prevent Rus-\nsians from acquiring control of the Turkish Straits and eastern Mediterranean, and to pre-\nvent Russia from upsetting the European balance of power.\nThe Crimean War is considered one of the first \u201dmodern\u201d wars and it introduced a number\nof \u201dfirsts\u201d to warfare. The Crimean War marked the first time railroads were used tactically\nto transport troops and to transport goods to troops over vast distances. The War also\nmarkedthefirsttimesteampoweredshipswereusedinwar. Additionally,newweaponsand\ntechniques were used, including breech-loading rifles, which loaded from the rear, artillery,\nand the deployment of trenches. The telegraph was used for the first time as well, allowing\nfor the first \u201dlive\u201d war to be broadcast in the press.\nThe conflict marked the end of Metternich\u2019s Concert of Europe. At the end of the war,\nRussia was defeated and as a result looked weak. The shock of the defeat in the Crimean\nWar in Russia led to Alexander II enacting sweeping internal reform. Alexander recognized\nthat in order to compete with other nations, it would have to industrialize and modernize.\nAs a step toward this, Alexander liberated the serfs in 1861. Finally, the Ottoman Empire\nwas kept intact, and it would continue to decline until World War I.\n11.4 Science and Technology\n11.4.1 Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution\nIn his book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , Charles Darwin\n(1809-1882) wrote that creatures experience genetic mutations prior to birth. Some of\nthese random mutations are beneficial, and some are not. He wrote that in the world, the\ncreatures who are the \u201dmost fit\u201d are most likely to survive and thus pass on their genes.\nThis process, known as natural selection6 results in the strongest creatures thriving and the\nweak dying off.\nOne of the most massive results of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution was that it was another\nmajor challenge to the Catholic Church. This, coupled with the Reformation, Renaissance,\nthe Enlightenment and its subsequent rise of deism, and other related movements, caused\nthe Church to lose even more influence in society.\n6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural%20selection\n117 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\nAlso, Darwin\u2019s theory led to the rise of the concept of social Darwinism7, or \u201dsurvival of\nthe fittest.\u201d The theory was fathered by Herbert Spencer. Social Darwinism espoused the\nidea that consensual economic interaction and property rights enabled societies to progress\nby allowing productive members of society to flourish and unproductive members to be\npunished by poverty. Accordingly, the theory of social Darwinism had a large impact on\nclassicalliberalandlibertariantheory. However,innon-libertariancircles,socialDarwinism\ndid not enjoy a favorable reputation, as it was perceived to have espoused apologism on\nbehalf of the rich, while condemning the poor.\n11.4.2 New Mental Sciences\nAs a result of Darwin\u2019s theory, a new group of mental sciences arose. People now began\nto believe that life is a struggle, and they began to try to explain these struggles. These\nnew mental sciences supported the concepts of real politik and capitalism, and rejected the\nnotion that life is orderly, harmonious, predictable, or reasonable.\nDuring this time, Sigmund Freud founded what is known as the psychoanalytical school\nof psychology. He argued that people are not creatures of reason, as the Enlightenment\nsuggested, but rather that people act because of subconscious motivations. He broke these\nmotivations into three areas:\nId\nThe id produces unconscious desires and is the most primitive of the three. The id desires\ninstant gratification. Freud argued that people will use defense mechanisms and rational-\nization to justify acting upon the id.\nEgo\nThe ego is the reality principle or the conscious self. It attempts to suppress the id and\nits intense desires.\nSuperego\nThe superego is a person\u2019s conscience.\nLombroso argued that you can tell criminals by their appearance. Pavlov argued that\npeople\u2019s actions are a response to being conditioned by stimuli in an environment. Finally,\nBinet devised IQ tests, arguing that intelligence is a measurable quotient. As a result,\neugenicists used this to try to prove that some people were more fit to live than others.\n11.5 Society and Culture\nThe Victorian Age was a period in which appearances were critical to social status. The\ndominating social class was the middle class, or bourgeosie. High moral standards and\nstrict social codes, especially of etiquette and class status, were followed. This era also saw\na middle-class interest in social reform for the lower classes.\n7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social%20Darwinism\n118 Society and Culture\nModern life was often unsettling to Europeans, as their old ways were being replaced by\nurbanization, industrialization, socialism, imperialism, and countless other new \u201dways.\u201d\nThepopulationwasrising, withtheAgriculturalRevolutionaswellasadvancesinmedicine\nallowing the citizens to live longer. This resulted in a portion of the rising population\nmigrating to other locations, including emigrating to other nations. Europeans migrated\nfrom the country to the city in search of industrial jobs. In addition, many Europeans fled\nto the United States, South America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand for a number of\nreasons - to escape anti-semitic persecution, to flee the Irish potato famine of 1840, and as\na result of a general overcrowding in Italy.\nHowever,atthesametime,therewerefallingbirthratesasaresultofmassivesocialchanges\nin Europe. Child labor laws were being enacted across the continent, and compulsory\neducation was enacted. Thus, the value of children to families fell since they could not\ngenerate income, and the overall cost of having children was now bore much more upon the\nparents.\nWhite collar workers now arose in society, and Europe saw the entrance of educated females\ninto clerical jobs in business and government. Disposable income became more common,\nand thus department stores and other similar stores began to open. People spent their\nextra income on fashion, home furnishings, cameras, and various other items. New leisure\nactivities became popular, including hunting, travelling, and bicycling, as well as team\nsports, including polo, cricket, and soccer.\n11.5.1 Impressionist Art\nFigure 41 Monet\u2019sa Water Lily Pond (Le\nbassin aux Nympheas ) (1889)\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude%20Monet\n119 Chapter 11 - European Imperialism and Nationalism\nImpressionism was a 19th-century art movement that began as a loose association of Paris-\nbasedartistsexhibitingtheirartpubliclyinthe1860s.

Theybegan\nby giving colours, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing inspiration from the work of\npainters such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix. They also took the act of painting out of the studio and\ninto the world. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes had usually been\npainted indoors. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and\ntransient effects of sunlight by painting en plein air. Painting realistic scenes of modern life,\nthey emphasized vivid overall effects rather than details. They used short, \u201dbroken\u201d brush\nstrokes of pure and unmixed colour, not smoothly blended, as was customary, in order to\nachieve the effect of intense colour vibration.\n11.5.2 Post Impressionist Art\nFigure 42 Vincent van Gogh\u2019s Starry Night ,\nJune 1889 (The Museum of Modern Art, New\nYork)\nPost-Impressionists extended Impressionism while rejecting its limitations: they continued\nusing vivid colours, thick application of paint, distinctive brushstrokes and real-life subject\nmatter, but they were more inclined to emphasize geometric forms, to distort form for\nexpressive effect, and to use unnatural or arbitrary colour.\nThe Post-Impressionists were dissatisfied with the triviality of subject matter and the loss\nof structure in Impressionist paintings, though they did not agree on the way forward.\nGeorges Seurat and his followers concerned themselves with Pointillism, the systematic use\nof tiny dots of colour. Paul C\u00e9zanne set out to restore a sense of order and structure\nto painting, to \u201dmake of Impressionism something solid and durable, like the art of the\nmuseums\u201d. He achieved this by reducing objects to their basic shapes while retaining the\n120 Society and Culture\nbright fresh colours of Impressionism. The Impressionist Camille Pissarro experimented\nwith Neo-Impressionist ideas between the mid 1880s and the early 1890s. Discontented\nwith what he referred to as romantic Impressionism, he investigated Pointillism which he\ncalled scientific Impressionism before returning to a purer Impressionism in the last decade\nof his life. Vincent van Gogh used colour and vibrant swirling brush strokes to convey his\nfeelings and his state of mind. Although they often exhibited together, Post-Impressionist\nartists were not in agreement concerning a cohesive movement. Younger painters during\nthe 1890s and early 20th century worked in geographically disparate regions and in various\nstylistic categories, such as Fauvism and Cubism.\n11.5.3 Christianity and Religion Questioned\nNew scientific theories such as Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution and Sigmund Freud\u2019s psycho-\nanalysis threatened traditional values. Historical scholarship, especially archaeology, led to\nquestioning the veracity of the Bible, and philosophers like Marx and Nietzsche cast doubt\nonthemoralityofChristianity.

A many-sided rivalry developed between Germany and Britain, intensifying when\nthesometimes-bellicoseWilhelmIIassumedpowerandbeganbuildingastrong,ocean-going\nnavy.\nSeeking to balance the rise of German power, Britain and France began to draw closer\ntogether diplomatically as the 20th century began. Germany, meanwhile, had allowed an\nimplicit alliance with Tsarist Russia to lapse, and faced ongoing French resentment over\nthe provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which Germany had annexed in 1871. The perceived\ndanger of \u201dencirclement\u201d by hostile nations began to loom in the minds of German leaders.\nThese factors together formed some of the tinder which would ignite the outbreak of war\nin 1914.\nIt is interesting to note, however, that all the ruling families of Europe were related to each\nother in some form or fashion. This led to many Europeans feeling that it was a family\naffair that they had been dragged into and forced to endure.\n12.1.1 The Road to War\nWorld War One is one of the most hotly contested issues in history; the complexity and\nnumber of theorized causes can be a major cause for confusion. One of the main reasons\nfor this complexity is the long period over which this war\u2019s tension built, beginning with\nthe unification of Germany by Bismarck, and escalating from there on. There is no doubt\nthat Germany\u2019s misguided foreign policy contributed to the outbreak of war, however the\nextent to which it contributed is the contended issue.\nSome historians suggest that Germany willed the war and engineered its outbreak, and\nothers even suggest that Germany felt compelled to go to war at that time. However, some\nsuggestthatthewarwasbroughtaboutbypoorleadershipatthetime,othersarguethatthe\nwar was brought about by accident - that Europe stumbled into war due to tension between\nalliance systems. Finally, some historians argue that World War I was the culmination of\nhistorical developments in Europe. This argument states that war was inevitable between\nAustria and Serbia, that imperial expansion by Russia eastward was also likely to provoke\nwar, and that the French were still furious over their loss of Alsace-Lorraine in the Franco-\nPrussian war.\n123 Chapter 12 - World War I\nThere was certainly a general rise in nationalism in Europe, which played a major role\nin the start of the conflict. The war became inevitable when the so-called \u201dblank check\u201d\nwas created when Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph sent a letter to German Kaiser\nWilhelm II, asking for German support against Serbia. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg,\nKaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s Imperial Chancellor, telegrammed back that Austria-Hungary could\nrely on Germany to support whatever action was necessary to deal with Serbia.\n12.1.2 The Alliance System\nOnefactorwhichhelpedtoescalatetheconflictwasthealliancesystemofthelatenineteenth\ncentury. Although there had always been alliances between different European nations, the\ndiplomatic trend during the nineteenth century was to have secret alliances, committing\nstates to defensive military action. These were encouraged by Bismarck who, in the process\nof unifying Germany, sought to pacify those surrounding states which might proved hostile.\nAlthoughGermanyhadoriginallyallieditselfwiththeempiresofAustriaandRussiaatthis\ntime, by the beginning of the twentieth century alliances had shifted. Germany found itself\nalliedwithAustria-HungaryandItaly,theso-called\u201dCentralPowers\u201d; togetherthecountries\nformed what was known as the \u201dTriple Alliance\u201d. Meanwhile, France, desperate for allies\nafter the Franco-Prussian war, had cultivated a friendship with Russia. Great Britain,\ntoo, felt isolated in the increasingly factionalised European environment, and sought out\nan alliance with another of Europe\u2019s great powers. This led to the Entente Cordial with\nFrance, which was to develop into the \u201dTriple Entente\u201d between Britain, France and Russia.\nBy 1914 most of the smaller European states had been drawn into this web of alliances.\nSerbia had allied itself with Russia whilst its enemy, Bulgaria, chose the patronage of\nGermany. Anumberofsmallstatesmaintainedtheirneutralityinthiscomplicatednetwork\nof alliances. Belgium, for instance, was a neutral state, its independence guaranteed by\nBritain, France, and Germany.\n124 The War\n12.2 The War\n12.2.1 The Schlieffen Plan\nFigure 43 Map of the Schlieffen Plan and planned French counter-offensives\nThe Schlieffen Plan was designed by Field Marshall Count Alfred von Schlieffen, who\nbecame Chief of the Great General Staff in 1891 and submitted his plan in 1905. Out of\nfear of a two front war, which Germany was nearly certain it could not win, it devised the\nplan to eliminate one of the fronts of the war before the other side could prepare. The\nplan called for a rapid German mobilization, sweeping through Holland, Luxembourg and\nBelgium into France. Schlieffen called for overwhelming numbers on the far right flank, the\nnorthernmost spearhead of the force with only minimum troops making up the arm and\naxis of the formation as well as a minimum force stationed on the Russian eastern front.\nSwift elimination of the French threat would in theory allow Germany to better defend\nagainst a Russian, or a British force. However, the British involvement was not looked for\nunder the Schlieffen plan, not at the commencement of action at least.\nIn 1905 Count Schlieffen expected his overpowering right wing to move basically along the\ncoast through Holland. He expected the Dutch to acquiesce and grant the army the right to\ncross their borders. Schlieffen knew that navigating around the Belgian fortress at Liege in\n125 Chapter 12 - World War I\nthis way would speed the advance while still defeating the fortress simply by encirclement.\nSchlieffen retired from his post in 1906 and was replaced by Helmuth von Moltke. In 1907-\n08 Moltke adjusted the plan, reducing the proportional distribution of the forces, lessening\nthe crucial right wing in favor of a slightly more defensive strategy. Also, judging Holland\nas unlikely to grant permission to cross its borders the plan now called for a direct move\nthrough Belgium but expected the French force to officially invade neutral Belgium first\nin an attempt to take the advantageous position at Meuse. Moltke\u2019s variation called for\nan artillery assault on Liege, but with the rail lines and the unprecedented firepower the\nGerman army brought what he did not expect any significant defense of the fortress.\n12.2.2 August 1914: War Erupts\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austria-Hungary throne, was\nassassinated in Sarajevo. As a result, Austria declared war on Serbia. Germany declared\nwar on both Russia and France. On August 4, Germany invaded neutral Belgium before\nthe French. This precipitated in Great Britain\u2019s declaration of war on Germany.\nEnacting the Moltke variation of the Schlieffen Plan, German forces entered Belgium, at-\ntacking the fortress of Liege. Although they could not stop the large invading force, Bel-\ngian troops fought bravely, and the siege lasted 10 days, arguably upsetting the German\ntimetable and allowing for mobilization of the French and the British Expeditionary forces.\nDuring the second half of August, however, a hasty French counteroffensive in Lorraine\ncollapsed, with heavy casualties in the face of German machine-gun fire. French armies fell\nback in disarray as the Germans crossed from Belgium into France on a wide front.\nKeeping its alliance with France, Russia\u2019s armies invaded Germany\u2019s easternmost province,\nEast Prussia, in August. The German high command dispatched General Paul von Hin-\ndenburg to defend the province. Hindenburg took command and defeated the Russians at\nthe Battle of Tannenberg, ending the hope of a Russian advance to Berlin.\nThe end of August was marked by near-panic in northern France as the German offensive\nrolled south toward Paris, seemingly unstoppable. On the German side, however, a gap\ndeveloped between the westernmost army corps, and the rapid advance was exhausting the\ntroops. TheFrenchrushedreinforcementsfromParis--someintaxicabs--tothefront, and\nby the first week of September, amid heavy fighting, the Germans had been halted along\nthe River Marne. This marked the beginning of the static trench lines which would define\nthe front in Western Europe for four years.\n12.2.3 1915-1916\nOn February 4, 1915, Germany declared a submarine blockade of Great Britain, stating\nthat any ship approaching England was a legitimate target. On May 7, 1915, Germany\nsank the passenger ship Lusitania, resulting in a massive uproar in the United States, as\nover 100 U.S. citizens perished. On August 30, Germany responded by ceasing to sink ships\nwithout warning.\nThe front in France became the focus of mass attacks that cost huge numbers of lives, but\ngained very little. Britain became fully engaged in France, raising a large conscript army\n126 The War\nfor the first time in its history. 1915 saw the first attacks with chlorine gas by the Germans,\nand soon the Allies responded in kind. During much of the year 1916, the longest battle of\nthe war, the Battle of Verdun, a German offensive against France and Britain, was fought\nto a draw and resulted in an estimated one million casualties. On July 1 through November\n18, theBattleofSomme, aBritishandFrenchoffensiveagainsttheGermans, againresulted\nin approximately one million casualties but no breakthrough for either side.\n12.2.4 1917-1918: Final Phases\nOn February 1, 1917, Germany again declares unrestricted submarine warfare. The Ger-\nmans believed that it was possible to defeat the British in six months through this, and\nassumed it would take at least one year for America to mobilize as a result of the actions.\nThus, they banked on the hope that they could defeat Britain before America would enter\nthe war.\nA mood of cultural despair had settled over much of Europe by this time, as an entire\ngeneration of young men was fed into the maw of combat. French armies came close to\nmutiny in 1917 when ordered into an attack they knew would be hopeless. Germany,\nblockaded from overseas trade, saw hunger and deprivation among the population, with\nlaborstrikesandpoliticaldiscontentgrowing. Russiaunderwentcollapse,itsarmiesdefeated\nand the Tsar ousted in favor of a liberal-socialist regime.\nOn April 6, 1917, the United States entered the war by declaring war on Germany. This\nwas in part due to the sinking of the Lusitania and the Zimmerman Telegram, which\nwas a ploy to convince Mexico to attack the United States in exchange for the return\nof Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona should the United States enter the war. From July\n31 through November 10, 1917, the Third Battle of Ypres, also known as Passchendaele,\nresulted in minor gains for the British, but there was still no breakthrough of the well-\ndeveloped German defenses. During this time, on November 7, Bolsheviks, led by Lenin,\noverthrew the post-Tsar Russian government.\nAs a result, in March 1918, the new Russian government, represented by Leon Trotsky,\nsignedanarmisticetreatywithGermany,removingtheeasternfrontofthewarforGermany.\nOn March 21, Germany thus launched what is known as the Ludendorff offensive in the\nhope of winning the war before American troops arrived. The final German effort, however,\nfared no better in the end than the previous ones; the Germans pushed closer to Paris than\never before, but by the end of summer they had exhausted themselves against the Allied\ndefenses, now including fresh American armies.\nOn September 29, 1918, allied troops broke through the German fortifications at the Hin-\ndenbergline, andtheendofthewarcameintoview. OnNovember9, 1918, KaiserWilhelm\nII abdicated, and on November 10 the German Weimar Republic was founded. On Novem-\nber 11, 1918, at eleven o\u2019clock on the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, the war\nended as Germany and the Allies signed an armistice agreement.\n127 Chapter 12 - World War I\n12.2.5 The War in Italy\nFigure 44 Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol\nItaly had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part\nof the Triple Alliance. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in\nProvince of Trento, Istria and Dalmatia. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, ef-\nfectively nullifying its alliance. At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops,\narguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive in nature, and that Austria-Hungary was an\naggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutral-\nity, offeringtheFrenchcolonyofTunisiainreturn. TheAlliesmadeacounter-offerinwhich\nItalywouldreceivetheAlpineprovinceofSouthTyrolandterritoryontheDalmatiancoast\n128 The War\nafter the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the Treaty of London. Further\nencouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente\nand declared war on Austria-Hungary on May 23. Fifteen months later Italy declared war\non Germany.\nMilitarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not\nonly because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the\nstrategies and tactics employed. Field Marshal Luigi Cadorna, a staunch proponent of the\nfrontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the Slovenian plateau, taking Ljubljana and\nthreatening Vienna. It was a Napoleonic plan, which had no realistic chance of success in\nan age of barbed wire, machine guns, and indirect artillery fire, combined with hilly and\nmountainous terrain.\nOn the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain,\nwhichfavouredthedefender. Afteraninitialstrategicretreat,thefrontremainedlargelyun-\nchanged, while Austrian Kaisersch\u00fctzen and Standsch\u00fctzen engaged Italian Alpini in bitter\nhand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counter-attacked\nin the Asiago towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916, but made little progress.\nBeginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the Isonzo\nfront along the Isonzo River, north-east of Trieste. All eleven offensives were repelled by\nthe Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians\ncaptured the town of Gorizia. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over\na year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving\nsituation on the Eastern front, the Austrians received large numbers of reinforcements,\nincluding German Stormtroopers and the elite Alpenkorps. The Central Powers launched\na crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved\na victory at Caporetto. The Italian army was routed and retreated more than 100 km\n(60 miles) to reorganise, stabilizing the front at the Piave River.

The British Royal\nNavy systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from\nits inability to protect Allied shipping.

It took place on 31 May\u22121 June 1916, in the North Sea off Jutland. The Kaiser-\nliche Marine\u2019s High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, squared off\nagainst the Royal Navy\u2019s Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The engagement\nwas a standoff, as the Germans, outmaneuvered by the larger British fleet, managed to\nescape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically,\nhowever, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface\nfleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.\nGerman U-boats attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.8\nThe nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving\nthe crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.10 The United States launched a\nprotest, and Germany modified its rules of engagement. After the notorious sinking of the\npassenger ship RMS Lusitania in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners,\nwhile Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the \u201dcruiser\nrules\u201d which demanded warning and placing crews in \u201da place of safety\u201d (a standard which\nlifeboats did not meet).11 Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of unrestricted\nsubmarine warfare, realizing the Americans would eventually enter the war.12 Germany\nsought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas.\nThe U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships entered convoys escorted by\ndestroyers. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly\nlessened losses; after the introduction of hydrophone and depth charges, accompanying\ndestroyers might actually attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success.

Contrary to\npopular belief, however, there were in fact two specific and unique revolutions that took\nplace during 1917 - a true Marxist revolution as well as a revolution led by Lenin that was\nnot a true Marxist revolution.\nMarch Revolution of 1917\nThe peasants were unhappy with the czar as a result of losses from World War I, the lack\nof real representation and the czar\u2019s dismissal of the Duma, the influence of Rasputin upon\nAlexandra, hunger, food shortages, and industrial working conditions.\nAs a result, on March 8, 1917, food riots broke out in St. Petersburg; however, the soldiers\nrefusedtofireupontherioters. Atthistime,twoforceswereincompetitionforcontrolofthe\nrevolution. Members of the Duma executive committee called for a moderate constitutional\ngovernment,whileSoviets,membersofworkercouncils,pushedforrevolutionandindustrial\nreform.\nOn March 15, 1917, the Czar attempted to return to Russia by train, but was stopped by\nthe troops and was forced to abdicate.\nFrom March through November, a provisional government was led by Alexander Kerensky,\na socialist, and Prince Lvov. However, this government was destined to fail because it\ntook no action in land distribution, continued to fight in World War I, and failed to fix\nfood shortages. General Kornilov attempted a coup, but Kerensky used the Soviets and\nBolsheviks to put down the coup. However, this action showed the weakness of Kerensky.\nThe March Revolution marked the first time that the class struggle predicted by Karl Marx\ntook place. Thus, the March Revolution was a true Marxist revolution based upon the\ntheories of Marx in The Communist Manifesto .\n133 Chapter 12 - World War I\nNovember Revolution of 1917\nFigure 47 Vladimir Lenin\nVladimir Lenin realized that the time had come to seize the revolution. He authored the\n\u201dApril Theses,\u201d in which he promised peace with the Central Powers, redistribution of the\nland, transfer of the factories to the owners, and the recognition of the Soviets as the\nsupreme power in Russia. In this sense, the November Revolution was led by Lenin rather\nthan being an overall coup by the workers, and thus the November revolution cannot be\ndubbed a true Marxist revolution.\nThe Revolution may never have happened had not the Prime Minister of the Time, Alek-\nsandr Kerensky19, destroyed the power of authority within the Army and Navy by allowing\nthe Bolshevik and Menshevik committees greater powers. Kerensky effectively disarmed\nthe Man who could have prevented the Revolution ever happening. The man in question,\nwas the Commander-in-Chief, General Lavr Kornilov20 who attempted to bring to heel the\npopulist Government of Kerensky and instill some authority back in to the state and the\nArmy. Kerensky seized the opportunity to relieve Kornilov of his office and effectively gave\n19 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr%20Kerensky\n20 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavr%20Kornilov\n134 References\nthe Bolsheviks, namely the Red Guard within the ranks of the Petrograd sailors, a Carte\nBlanc to take up arms in the so called defense of the Provisional Government.

Lenin attempted to maintain Marxism, hoping to\nreach Marx\u2019s state of a propertyless, classless utopia. However, the pursuit of communism\ngenerally failed and the economy declined. Accordingly, Lenin enacted the New Economic\nPolicy in March 1921, which compromised many aspects of communism for capitalism\u2019s\nprofits.\n12.4.2 Modern Art\nThe 1900s led to the creation of the new, modern art movement. Fauvism is a type of\nmodern art that emphasized wild, extreme colors, abstraction, simplified lines, freshness,\nand spontaneity. Cubism is another form of modern art, which utilizes a geometrical de-\npiction of subjects with planes and angles. The modern art movement arose because, with\nthe advent of photography, art subjects no longer needed to be a realistic portrayal.\nPerhaps the most famous modern artist is Pablo Picasso, a Spanish painter and sculptor.\n12.5 References\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Chi\u1ebfn tranh th\u1ebf gi\u1edbi th\u1ee9 nh\u1ea5t21\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FChi%\n21\nE1%BA%BFn%20tranh%20th%E1%BA%BF%20gi%E1%BB%9Bi%20th%E1%BB%A9%20nh%E1%BA%A5t\n135  13 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\n13.1 Introduction\nThe end of World War I saw the European combatant nations exhausted, an entire gener-\nation of young men dead on the battlefield, and political conditions vastly changed from\nthose before the war. The German, Austrian and Russian monarchies had been driven from\npower and replaced with democratic or revolutionary governments, and many European\nethnic groups which had been subject to these three states seized the chance to obtain in-\ndependence. It was against this background that the victorious powers attempted to bring\npermanent peace to Europe. The victors of the war were quick to blame Germany for start-\ning the war and resolved to punish her, and this is exactly what took place at the Treaty\nof Versailles in 1919. the treaty was so harsh on Germany mostly because France and Italy\nwere angry with them.\n13.2 The Treaty of Versailles of 1919\nFigure 48 Woodrow Wilsona and the American\npeace commissioners during the negotiations on\nthe Treaty of Versailles.\na http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow%20Wilson\nAt the Peace of Paris or Treaty of Versailles, the \u201dBig Four\u201d convened to discuss what\nthe result of the end of the war should be. The big four consisted of the United States,\nrepresented by President Woodrow Wilson; Britain, represented by Prime Minister Lloyd-\nGeorge; France, represented by Clemenceau, who wanted most of all to get revenge against\nGermany; and Orlando of Italy. Germany and Russia were not invited, as Germany was\ndefeated, and Russia had made a separate peace with Germany in 1917, and was feared\nbecause of the rise of the revolutionary Bolsheviks there.\nAt the discussions, many taking part looked to President Wilson for leadership, as the\nUnited States was the least damaged and seemingly the most neutral victor, and because\nthe members saw Wilson\u2019s 14 Points plan provide an idealistic road map to a new future.\n13.2.1 Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points\nWilson\u2019s Fourteen Points were democratic, liberal, enlightened, and progressive - a new\ntype of treaty designed to make peace forever secure. The key aspects of his propositions\n137 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\nwere to disallow secret treaties in the future, allow freedom of the seas, provide for arms\nreduction, allow the self-determination of nations, and to establish the League of Nations,\nwhich Wilson saw as a key instrument to prevent future war.\n13.2.2 The Treaty\u2019s Treatment of Germany\nIn contrast to Wilson\u2019s idealism, the Treaty of Versailles was harsh, brutal, punitive, and\nretributive, especially because France still had lingering anger over the Franco-Prussian\nwar. The aspects of the Treaty were designed to attempt to prevent Germany\u2019s ability\nto wage war in the future. It ordered that France would control the Saar valley, rich in\ncoal and iron, for 15 years, and that France would have Alsace-Lorraine returned. The\nRhineland between France and Germany would be demilitarized as a buffer zone between\nthetwonations. Germany\u2019scoloniesweredividedbetweenFranceandBritain,andGermany\nitself lost all together 13.5% of land and 12.5% of her population. The German navy was\nconfiscated and the German army was limited to 100,000 members, and no submarines,\nplanes, or artillery were permitted. Germany was forced to pay brutal war reparations in\nthe amount of 132 billion gold marks. Finally, Article 231, or the War Guilt Clause, was a\nstrictly retributive measure, ordering Germany and her allies to bear full responsibility for\nthe war.\n13.3 Problems of Germany After World War I\nGermany\u2019s new democratic government, the so-called Weimar Republic, faced serious prob-\nlems following the Treaty of Versailles. Though Kaiser Wilhelm II had abdicated and the\nwartime military leadership had lost its authority, Germans widely refused to admit that\ntheir army had lost the war. A significant number believed that Germany could have con-\ntinued to fight and eventually gotten the upper hand, and that surrender was a \u201dstab in the\nback\u201d of an army capable of winning the war.\nWhile this severely undermined the credibility of the new republic, the notion that the Ger-\nman army could have continued the war and eventually won is rejected by most historians,\ndue to the introduction of fresh U.S. forces and Germany\u2019s weakness after four years of\nbattle. In fact, in late 1918 the German High Command, facing a powerful Allied offensive\ntowardGermansoilandexhaustionoftheirowntroops,turnedindesperationtoGermany\u2019s\ndemocratic politicians and asked them to form a government which the Allies would find\nacceptable for negotiations.\nImmediately after the war, the Weimar Republic encountered severe economic problems.\nMillions of demobilized soldiers arrived home to find little or no work. Hunger was\nwidespread. In addition, France and Britain owed war debts to the United States, and\nin order to pay them demanded reparation from Germany. Germany was unable to pay, so\nFrance seized the industrial towns of the Ruhr valley. The German response was to print\nmoneytopaytheunemployedworkersoftheRuhr, whichresultedinmassivehyperinflation\nin Germany.\nPolitically, there was near-chaos for several years, as fringe political groups on both the left\nand the right openly and violently battled each other and the central government. The\n138 German Prosperity Returns\nSpartacists, or communists, staged uprisings in Berlin and other cities and briefly seized\npower in Bavaria. The Freikorps, various bands of demobilized soldiers who did not want to\nlay down their arms, crushed the Bavarian coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. However, the Freikorps also sought\nto overthrow the Weimar Republic\u2019s government with a coup of their own in 1920, which\nfailed when German workers responded with a general strike.\nThis was the atmosphere in 1919 when a small right-wing party in Munich took in a new\nmember, an army corporal named Adolf Hitler. A skilled orator and politician, Hitler\nrapidly rose to head the National Socialist German Worker\u2019s Party, known as the Nazis.\n13.4 German Prosperity Returns\nIn the late 1920s, prosperity returned to Germany, primarily as a result of U.S. efforts\nthrough the Dawes Plan of 1924 and the Young Plan of 1929. These plans provided loans\nto the Weimar Republic and gave the Republic a realistic plan for reparation payments,\nhelping to restore economic stability.\nThis prosperity had a diminishing effect on the radical groups of the right and left. The\nappeal of these groups was reduced as a result of a prosperous Germany.\n13.5 The Rise of Pacifism and Isolation in the 1920s\nDuring the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations was that of pacifism\nand isolation. After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations\ndesired to avoid such a situation again in the future. Thus, Europe took a number of steps\nto ensure peace during the 1920s.\nAt the Washington Naval Conference in 1921, the United States, Great Britain, France,\nJapan, and Italy agreed to build no new battleships for ten years and to reduce the current\nsize of their navies.\nDuring the Locarno Treaties of 1925, Germany unconditionally guaranteed the borders of\nFranceandBelgiumandpledgedtoneverviolatethebordersofCzechoslovakiaandPoland.\nIn 1926, Germany joined the League of Nations. The League was one of the major means\nthat Europeans ensured peace during the time.\nIn 1928, 65 nations signed the Kellogg Briand Pact, rejecting war as a means of policy. In\n1934, Russia joined the League of Nations.\n13.6 Democracies in Europe from 1919 through 1939\nWhilefascismroseinEurope,theliberaldemocraciesintheBritainandFrancewereencoun-\nteringisolationismandpacifism,asexplainedabove,aswellasproblemswithunemployment\nand colonial struggles. As a result of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the concept that\ngovernment is responsible for meeting the social needs of its citizens became increasingly\npopular.\n139 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\n13.6.1 Britain\nBefore WW1 The Old-Age Pensions Act 1908 of the United Kingdom, passed in 1908 is\noften regarded as one of the foundations of modern social welfare in the United Kingdom\nand forms part of the wider social welfare reforms of the Liberal Government of 1906\u20131914.\nThe Act provided for a non-contributory old age pension for persons over the age of 70. It\nwas enacted in January 1909 and paid a weekly pension of 5s a week (7s 6d for married\ncouples) to half a million who were eligible. The level of benefit was deliberately set low to\nencourage workers to also make their own provision for retirement. In order to be eligible,\nthey had to be earning less than \u00a331. 10s. per year, and had to pass a \u2019character test\u2019; only\nthose with a \u2019good character\u2019 could receive the pensions. You also had to have been a UK\nresident for at least 20 years to be eligible and people who hadn\u2019t worked their whole life\nwere also not eligible.\nAlsoexcludedwerethoseinreceiptofpoorrelief, \u2019lunatics\u2019inasylums, personssentencedto\nprison for ten years after their release, persons convicted of drunkenness (at the discretion\nof the court), and any person who was guilty of \u2018habitual failure to work\u2019 according to one\u2019s\nability.\nAfter World War I, Britain faced a number of problems. One of the most serious was\nunemployment, with approximately 2 million people on the \u201ddole,\u201d or Britain\u2019s welfare\nsystem. This resulted in the rise of the Labour party. The Labour party created a modern\nwelfare state in Britain, creating an old age pension, medical care, public housing, and\nunemployment relief.\nThe British industries, now antiquated and falling behind, were selling less as the United\nStates stepped up to the industrial plate.\nMembers of British colonies, such as Ireland, Egypt, India, and Palestine, were finding the\nideals of the Enlightenment appealing and were beginning to resist British rule.\nFinally, the Great Depression caused massive problems in Britain.\nPrime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, a member of the Labour Party, enacted a policy of\n\u201dretrenchment,\u201d which cut social spending, disallowed employment for women, and installed\n100% tariffs on foreign goods. He enacted the ideas of Keynesian Economics1, authored by\nJ.M. Keynes, which advocated increased government spending during a depression in order\nto put money into the economy.\n13.6.2 France\nThe Third Republic of France was the governing body from 1870 until 1940. Although it\nwas widely disliked for its political instability and corruption, it did manage to deliver a\ngolden age, what became known as the belle epoque , for Paris. The city acquired many\ndistinctive new monuments and public buildings, foremost among them the Eiffel Tower,\nconstructed for the World Exhibition of 1889. It was renowned as a centre for the arts, with\nthe Impressionists taking their inspiration from its new vistas. At the same time, Paris\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian%20economics\n140 Challenges to Democracy in the 1930s\nacquired a less savoury reputation as the \u201dsin capital of Europe\u201d, with hundreds of brothels,\nrevues and risqu\u00e9 cabarets such as the famous Moulin Rouge. The city also acquired its\nmetro system, opened in 1900.\nIn 1877, President MacMahon tried to dissolve parliament out of disgust with the premier\nand to seize more power. However, the French people elected the same deputies to Parlia-\nment. The French people clearly wanted to prevent another dictator from taking power.\nIn 1886-1889, General Boulanger came close to overthrowing the government. He gained\nlarge support among monarchists, aristocrats, and workers, pleading to fight Germany.\nHowever, he lost his courage at the moment of the coup, and he fled to Belgium and\ncommitted suicide.\nIn 1894, a French Jewish army officer named Alfred Dreyfus was falsely accused of treason\nin what became known as the \u201dDreyfus Affair,\u201d showing that anti-Semitism was still strong\nin France, especially in the army and the Catholic Church. \u00c9mile Zola wrote the famous\nletter \u201dJ\u2019Accuse!\u201d which helped raised support for Dreyfus, who was eventually pardoned\nand restored to rank. Thus, in 1905 France enacted the separation of church and state.\nAfter World War I, France encountered a number of problems. They had difficulty with the\ncost and burden of rebuilding the nation, and they lost all of their investments in Russia as\na result of the Russian Revolution. The reparations were not paid by Germany as expected.\nAdditionally, tax evasion was common in France at the time.\nBy the late 1920s, prosperity had been restored. However, the Great Depression of the\n1930s triggered political unrest and social turmoil. In 1934, the socialists and communists\nfought the fascists in the Chamber of Deputies, one of the houses of parliament, and threw\nink at each other. As a result of the unrest, the people elected a \u201dPopular Front,\u201d a coalition\nof socialists, liberals, and communists, to govern. The leader of the Popular Front was\nLeon Blum, who during his tenure enacted family subsidies, welfare benefits, two weeks of\nvacation, a forty hour work week, and collective bargaining. Leon Blum was replaced in\n1938 by Eduard Daladier.\n13.7 Challenges to Democracy in the 1930s\nAs a result of the Great Depression, fringe groups such as fascists and communists became\nmore appealing to the general populace of Europe.\n13.7.1 Causes of the Great Depression\nThe Great Depression occurred because of a number of reasons. Low wages at the time\nresulted in less purchasing power. An agricultural depression and falling prices resulted in\nincreased agricultural output but decreased demand. Overproduction in the factories, and\noverexpansion of credit, as well as the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 also contributed\ngreatly. Actions pursued when the Great Depression was still in its infancy involved the\nFed2\u2019s untimely raise in interest rates (in hopes to lure foreign investment), and later on,\n2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed\n141 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\nthe Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff3 created immediate tariff backlash across the world and collapsed\na great majority of world trade.\n13.7.2 Effects on the Colonies\nThese changes in Europe resulted in more calls for autonomy in the colonies, and the\ninfluence of Woodrow Wilson\u2019s proposed \u201dself-determination\u201d of nations grew.\nIn 1931, the Statute of Westminister created the \u201dCommonwealth of Nations\u201d consisting of\nCanada, New Zealand, Australia, the Irish Free State, and South Africa. These nations\nwere given autonomy but were linked to Britain through trade.\nIn the 1930s, India began yearning for autonomy. The Muslim League and the Indian\nNational Congress called for a greater role of Indians in their government. Gandhi\u2019s \u201dcivil\ndisobedience\u201d led to an end to British rule, and in 1935 the Government of India Act\nprovided India with an internal self-government. In 1947 India gained its independence and\nsplit with Pakistan.\nIn 1908, \u201dYoung Turks\u201d overthrew Abdul Hamid II of Turkey and ruled the nation until\n1918. After World War I, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk took the leadership of Turkey. In 1923 he moved\nthe capital from Constantinople to Ankara, beginning the Republic of Turkey. Finally, in\n1930, he changed the name of Constantinople to Istanbul. Atat\u00fcrk established western\ndress, the Latin alphabet, and banned polygamy from Turkey. In 1936, women were given\nsuffrage and were allowed to serve in parliament.\n13.8 Fascism in Germany and Italy\nItaly experienced a turn to fascism after World War I, and Benito Mussolini took control as\ndictator of the nation. Soon afterward, Germany under Hitler took the same turn. Fascism\nwas a new form of government, initiated by Mussolini, that promoted extreme nationalism\nand national unity; an emphasis on masculinity, youth, aggression, and violence; racial\nsuperiority; onesupremeleaderwithsuperhumanabilities; therejectionofindividualrights;\nthe use of secret police, censorship, and propaganda; a militaristic and aggressive foreign\npolicy;strictcentralcontroloftheeconomy;andtheholdingoftheindividualassubordinate\nto the needs of society as a whole.\n3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley%20Tariff%20Act\n142 Fascism in Germany and Italy\n13.8.1 The Italian Fascist Regime\nFigure 49 Benito\nMussolini\nThe liberal establishment of Italy, fearing a socialist revolution inspired by the ideas of the\nRussian Revolution, endorsed the small National Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini.\nAfter several years of struggle, in October 1922 the fascists attempted a coup (the \u201dMarcia\nsuRoma\u201d, i.e. MarchonRome); thefascistforceswerelargelyinferior, butthekingordered\nthearmynottointervene,formedanalliancewithMussolini,andconvincedtheliberalparty\ntoendorseafascist-ledgovernment. Overthenextfewyears,Mussolini(whobecameknown\nas \u201dIl Duce\u201d, the leader) eliminated all political parties (including the liberals) and curtailed\npersonal liberties under the pretext of preventing revolution.\n13.8.2 The Rise of Fascism and Hitler in Germany\nFigure 50 Adolf Hitler\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, Germany was not far from a civil war. Paramilitary troops,\nwhich were set up by several parties, intimidated voters and seeded violence and anger\namong the public, who suffered from high unemployment and poverty. Meanwhile, elitists\nin influential positions, alarmed by the rise of anti-governmental parties, fought amongst\n143 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\nthemselves and exploited the emergency authority provided in the Weimar Constitution to\nrule undemocratically by presidential decree.\nAfter a succession of unsuccessful cabinets, on January 29, 1933, President von Hinden-\nburg, seeing little alternative and pushed by advisors, appointed Adolf Hitler Chancellor of\nGermany.\nOn 27 February, the Reichstag was set on fire. Basic rights were abrogated under an\nemergency decree. An Enabling Act gave Hitler\u2019s government full legislative power. A\ncentralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the rule of democratic\nlaw, a policy that Hitler had outlined in his biography \u2019Mein Kampf.\u2019 The new regime\nmade Germany a one-party state by outlawing all oppositional parties and repressing the\ndifferent-minded parts of the public with the party\u2019s own organisations SA and SS, as well\nas the newly founded state security police Gestapo.\nIndustry was closely regulated with quotas and requirements in order to shift the economy\ntowardsawarproductionbase. Massivepublicworkprojectsandextensivedeficitspending\nbythestatehelpedtosignificantlylowerthehighunemploymentrate. Thisandlargewelfare\nprogrammes are said to be the main factors that kept support of the public even late in the\nwar.\nIn 1936, German troops entered the demilitarised Rhineland in an attempt to rebuild na-\ntionalself-esteem. Emboldened, Hitlerfollowedfrom1938onwardsapolicyofexpansionism\nto establish Greater Germany, that is, one German nation state, starting with the unifica-\ntion with Austria (called \u201dAnschluss\u201d) and the annexation of the Sudetes region in Bohemia\nfrom Czechoslovakia. The British Prime Minister realized that his policies of appeasement\ntowardsGermanywerebeingtakenadvantageof. Toavoidatwo-frontwar,Hitlerconcluded\nthe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact4, a treaty of non-aggression, with the Soviet Union.\n13.9 The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939\nIn 1923, a coup led by General Miguel Primo de Rivera formed a new government in\nalliance with King Alfonso XIII Bourbon. In 1930, opposition to Primo de Rivera\u2019s right\nwing government led to his resignation. Out of a desire for democracy and socialism by\nthe populace of Spain, Alfonso was overthrown in 1931 and a republic declared. In 1936, a\nPopularFrontofleftistsforceswaselectedtoParliamentandtookcontrolofthegovernment.\nAnticlerical actions of leftists and their direct attacks on Catholic churches and monasteries\nangered all conservative Spaniards. Left and right-wing political militants clashed on the\nstreets. In July of 1936, rebellion broke out among a big part of army units. It was\nsupported by conservative forces of all kinds of social background and the fighting began.\nThe nation broke into two factions. The Republicans, or \u201dLoyalists,\u201d consisted of commu-\nnists, socialists, anarchists, and liberals, and received some international support as well\nas big military and financial aid from Stalin. The \u201dNationalists\u201d consisted of monarchists,\nangered Catholic believers, landowners, the army, members of the \u201dFalange\u201d party, tradi-\ntionalists and received a great deal of direct aid from Italy and Germany.\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov-Ribbentrop%20Pact\n144 Again to War, the Outbreak of World War II\nIn1936,GreatBritain,France,andtheUnitedStatessignedanon-interventionpactregard-\ning the civil war. In 1937, the town of Guernica, a civilian town, was attacked and bombed\nby the German airforce. In 1939, nationalists took Barcelona and Madrid, and General\nFrancisco Franco announced the end of the Civil War. From 1939 until 1975 Franco would\nrule as dictator in Spain.\n13.10 Again to War, the Outbreak of World War II\nThe Treaty of Versailles produced so-called \u201drevisionist\u201d powers. Germany, who was the\nloser of the war, had harsh reparations imposed against them. Italy got nothing out of the\nPeaceofParis. HungarylosttwothirdsofherterritoryandeachthirdethnicHungarianwas\nplaced under foreign rule. Japan didn\u2019t receive the racial equality clause they desired, even\nafter defeating the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War. The Soviet Union was snubbed at\nthe Peace of Paris as well, as it was not invited to attend.\n13.10.1 Aggressive Actions by the Axis Powers and Western Response\nIn 1933, Germany left the League of Nations. In 1934, Germany attempted to annex\nAustria. In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia while Germany reoccupied the Saar valley and\nbegan conscription and open rearmament. In 1936, Germany remilitarized the Rhineland.\nIn 1938, Germany annexed Austria and the Sudetenland.\nThe prevalence of pacificism in the 1920s in Europe meant that European nations were\nreluctant to interfere in the actions of the revisionist powers. In addition, the nations of the\nTreaty of Versailles began to feel guilt for their treatment of Germany, and believed that\nthey had wronged Germany. Moreover, the areas that Germany initially invaded were all\nof German heritage, and the leaders of the nations wondered if perhaps Germany should be\nallowed to take those territories. The leaders met at the Munich Conference in 1938, and\nHitler promised to take no more aggressive actions.\nIn 1939, however, Germany seized the rest of Czechoslovakia, showing that war was in-\nevitable and that appeasement had failed. Poland and Hungary also participated, taking\nsections of Czech and Slovak territory adjacent to their borders. During the same year,\nItaly and Germany signed the \u201dPact of Steel\u201d alliance.\nBritish Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain responded to the occupation of Czechoslovakia\nby giving a guarantee to Poland that Britain would go to war against Germany if Germany\nattacked Poland. The Polish government had not requested this alliance. Many historians\nhave seen the guarantee as Chamberlain opening his eyes to Hitler\u2019s aggressive plans, but\nsome others hold that it foolishly made war much more likely, by encouraging Poland to\ndefy Germany in any negotiations over the Polish Corridor and the city of Danzig.\nPossibly in response to Chamberlain\u2019s action, Germany and the Soviet Union shocked the\nWestern powers by signing a non-aggression pact. This pact showed that war was imminent\nbecause two systems mutually pledged for the other\u2019s destruction came to agreement.\nOn September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland with its new war machine using what was\ncalled lightning warfare or Blitzkrieg. As a result, on September 3, 1939, Great Britain and\n145 Chapter 13 - Europe: 1918 to 1945\nFrance declared war on Germany. On September 17, 1939, the U.S.S.R. invaded Poland.\nIn 1940, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Treaty, forming the Axis powers.\n13.10.2 The Second World War\nAfter the invasion of Poland on September 1st 1939, between the fall of 1939 and the spring\nof 1940 the Allies did not directly attack Germany in the west, but rather they engaged in\nharassing operations which had become known as the \u201dphony war.\u201d This allowed Germany\nto finish the mobilization of its forces. In April of 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and\nNorway. The next month Belgium, the Netherlands, and France were attacked. Within six\nweeks, France had surrendered.\nWinston Churchill became Prime Minister of Britain in May 1940. Churchill was dedicated\nto the destruction of Hitler, whatever the cost and using any means necessary. Churchill\nopened a new era in warfare by launching an unprecedented bombing campaign against\nciviliantargetsinGermany. TheGermansretaliated, andtheheroicBritishdefensebecame\nwhatisknownastheBattleofBritain. LondonandmanyothercitiesinEnglandwerehard-\nhit with large civilian casualties.\nIn 1941, Germany invaded Russia in an attempt to destroy communism, enslave the Rus-\nsians, and get oil that was desperately needed to power the German war machine. However,\nthe invasion failed, and winter hit Russia, causing massive death and destruction among\nGermany\u2019s army.\nIn 1942, Germany attempted to siege the Russian city of Stalingrad, but the attack ulti-\nmatelyendedinSovietvictoryandthedefeatoftheGermans. Alsoduring1942, theBritish\nand the United States defeated German forces in North Africa.\nBy 1943, the Allies had landed in Italy and were beating back Mussolini\u2019s forces. During\n1943, the Battle of Kursk, the largest armored engagement of all time, also took place on\nthe Eastern Front. Again, the Soviets were highly victorious against German forces. On\nSeptember 8, 1943, Italy surrendered to the allies.\nBy 1943, an immense bombing campaign by the U.S. and Britain was under way to break\nGermany\u2019swilltofightbydestroyinghercitiesandmakingherpopulationhomeless. Almost\nevery major city was devastated with huge loss of life, but postwar studies showed that the\nbombing had little effect on industrial production, and may have strengthened Germans\u2019\nwill to fight.\nOn June 6, 1944, Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy on what has become\nknownasD-Day. TheoffensivewassuccessfulfortheAllies,andtheAlliessufferedfarfewer\ncasualties than expected. This marked the beginning of the end of the war. In December\n1944, the Battle of the Bulge, the German\u2019s last major offensive in Western Europe, took\nplace in Belgium. The result of this battle was a victory for the Allies and the crushing\nof much of the remainder of Germany\u2019s forces. On May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe Day\noccurred as the Russians took Berlin.\n146 Again to War, the Outbreak of World War II\n13.10.3 Conclusion of the War\nAs the war neared the end, two major conferences took place to discuss how to most\neffectively terminate the war.\nThe Yalta Conference\nThe Yalta Conference began on February 11, 1945. In attendance were U.S. President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and the Soviet leader\nJoseph Stalin. Yalta resulted in a number of essential provisions.\nThefirstwastheestablishmentoftheUnitedNations,aninternationalorganizationthatde-\nscribesitselfasa\u201dglobalassociationofgovernmentsfacilitatingcooperationininternational\nlaw, international security, economic development, and social equity.\u201d The United Nations\nreplaced the League of Nations, and was given the capacity to enforce itself militarily.\nYalta called for a four part dismemberment of Germany, with a portion going to each the\nUnited Kingdom, France, the United States, and Russia. This was based upon the fact that\nwhile Germany was not unified it did not present nearly the threat that it did as a unified\nnation.\nWar criminals were tried at Nuremberg, marking the first time that members of an army\nwere held to international standards.\nPoland was reconstituted, albeit with large territorial changes and placement in the Soviet\nsphere of influence. Reparations were enforced against Germany, and it was agreed that\nRussia would enter the war against Japan after the defeat with Germany.\nFinally, the parties agreed to the Declaration of Liberated Europe. This provided that\nliberated countries would be given the right to hold free elections and choose their own\ngovernment. This was an attempt to keep Stalin from annexing eastern Europe, but this\nattempt obviously failed.\nThe Potsdam Conference\nThe Potsdam Conference took place from July to August of 1945. In attendance were\nPresident Harry S. Truman, replacing President Roosevelt as a result of Roosevelt\u2019s death,\nBritishPrimeMinisterAttleeoftheLabourparty, whorepresentedBritainafterChurchill\u2019s\nConservative Party\u2019s defeat in Britain, and Joseph Stalin. The Conference provided for\nGerman disarmament, demilitarization, and denazification. Poland was shifted to the west\nto reward the Soviet Union and to punish Germany, and as a result there was a massive\npost-war migration.\nFinally, Japan was threatened with destruction by a \u201dpowerful new weapon\u201d which turned\nout to be the atomic bomb.\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Ch\u00e2u \u00c2u t\u1eeb 1918 \u0111\u1ebfn 19455\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FCh%C3%\n5\nA2u%20%C3%82u%20t%E1%BB%AB%201918%20%C4%91%E1%BA%BFn%201945\n147  14 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\n14.1 Introduction\nAs Europe enters a new era, with two world wars still residing in the collective memory,\npeaceandprosperityseemslikelytocontinue. TheSovietUniondissolvedin1991, resulting\nin a europe whose countries and borders have returned to their pre-WW2 state. Its nations,\nhowever, are faced with ageing populations and falling birthrates, making it increasingly\nchallenging to sustain expensive programs of social services. As the twenty-first century\nbegan, the continent is redefining itself with multiculturalism, a strengthening of europe\u2019s\ncommon economic policies and the formation of a European parliament. The Europe of\nNations, whose nationalistic sentiments led to two world wars during the last century, is\nviewing the federalism of the USA as a possible solution to forging a United Europe.\n14.2 Western Europe 1945-Present\nAfter World War II the countries of Europe were faced with finding ways to reconstruct\ntheir economies. Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland and Spain who had all remained neutral\nduring the war fared slightly better. Sweden and Switzerland had provided banking and\nmaterials for the Nazi war effort and this meant that both countries had come out of the\nwar relatively unscathed. Neutrality has its benefits but for those countries who were at the\nvanguardofmilitaryactionthesituationwasfarworse. Britain\u2019sindustrieshadbeenalmost\nexclusively dedicated to the war effort and coupled with the loss of economic and political\ninfluence amongst its former colonies the outlook for a quick recovery seemed unlikely. The\ncountries that had been occupied by Germany had seen their industrial output directed\nto the German war effort and the influx of money and goods from occupied countries into\nthe German economy meant that the shortages and austerity of war were not felt by the\nGerman population until the last year of the war. All over Europe the expectations was one\nof a return to normality and economic strength though it soon became obvious that this\ncould only be achieved with American aid. In a speech given at Havard in 1947 by George\nC. Marshall, the American Secretary of State, proposed that the rebuilding of europe\u2019s\neconomies including Germany\u2019s should in part be funded by American grants.\n\u201dThe truth of the matter is that Europe\u2019s requirements for the next three or four years\nof foreign food and other essential products - principally from America - are so much\ngreater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial additional help or\nface economic, social, and political deterioration of a very grave character.\u201d\nExcerpt from the Havard Speech given by George C. Marshall.\n149 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\nTheMarshallPlanwaspassedintolawbyPresidentTrumaninApril1948undertheformal\nnameofthe\u201dEuropeanRecoveryProgram\u201d. TheMarshallPlanwastoapplytoalltheareas\nof Europe that had been ravaged by war regardless of whether the recipient had been an\nAlly or member of the Axis. Stalin rejected the plan therefore ensuring that East Germany,\nPoland, Romania, Yugoslavia and other countries then under post-war Soviet occupation\nor influence were excluded.\n14.2.1 Britain\nFigure 51 British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher\nBritain after the war was heavily in debt. The bombing of major urban centers and ex-\nhaustion of manpower due to war casualties further added to the financial difficulties. The\ndamage to the economy led to rationing being extended into the next decade. From 1945\nuntil 1951, the Labour Party and Prime Minister Attlee replaced the Conservative Party.\nWinston Churchill was considered by the general populace to be a \u201dWar Prime Minister\u201d\nandthoughhavinglostthefirstpost-warelectiondidserveafurthertermasPrimeMinister\nfrom 1951 to 1955. In August 1947, India became independent of Britain. From 1950 to\n1980Britain,nowwithoutthefulleconomicbenefitofitscolonies,embracedthefree-market\ncapitalism advanced by the USA though more emphasis was given to social programs and\nstate ownership of major utilities. In many respects America\u2019s involvement in the war had\nbeen conditional on Britain dismantling its colonial power base with the USA viewing it as\n150 Western Europe 1945-Present\nan obstacle to their own ideas of trade and free-market capitalism. This had first been pro-\nposed by Roosevelt to Churchill at the August 1941 meeting where the future of post-war\neurope was being discussed. America had viewed Britain\u2019s colonial trade as monopolistic\nand though it was Pearl Harbour and Japanese aggression that led to the USA entering the\nwar; the agenda for colonial independence remained. America the Colony who had fought\na war against the English for independence was pre-disposed culturally and economically\nto make this request.\nMargaret Thatcher, leader of the Conservative Party, became Prime Minister from 1979\nuntil 1990. She was the first Western female leader of the modern era, and was faced with\ndepressionand\u201dstagflation\u201d-highunemploymentandinflationresultingfromhighoilprices.\nThatcher was closely allied with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and employed \u201dtrickle-\ndown\u201d supply-side economics, cutting taxes on the wealthy in hopes that they would spend\nthe additional money to hire new workers and endorsing privatization and deregulation.\nThatcher cut many other social programs including education, health care, and welfare,\nand sold off nationalized industries such as BritOil and British Airways. She also broke the\npower of the unions in Britain.\nThatcheralsodeployedataskforcetoregaincontroloftheFalklandIslands(Malvinas)after\nthe invasion of the islands by Argentina in 1982.\nJohn Major was the Conservative Prime Minister from 1990 until 1997.

The coalition of Conservatives\nand Liberal Democrats have formed the government since the general election of 2010, with\na rumbling about possible Scottish independence from the UK and now possible departure\nform the EU.\n14.2.2 France\nThe Vichy regime installed by the Nazis after their invasion of France during World War\nII was replaced in 1946 by the Fourth Republic, which lasted until 1958. The Fourth\nRepublic consisted of a strong Parliament with a Premier chosen by the majority party.\nThere was also a weak ceremonial President. Charles De Gaulle, who led the Free French\nResistance movement against the Nazis during their occupation of France in World War\nII, was elected but refused to participate and thus resigned. After World War II, France\ndecolonizedIndochina, Morocco, Tunisia, andtherestofWestAfrica. TheFourthRepublic\nalso allowed women\u2019s suffrage.\nViolentconflictaroseinAlgeria, stillafrenchcolony. Bombings, terrorism, andthedeathof\nnearly one million people during anti-french actions led to this conflict taking center stage\nin French politics. When senior officers of the French military in Algeria rebelled in May of\n1958 and fears of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat spread among the members of the government, the latter\ncalled upon Charles De Gaulle to resolve the problem. De Gaulle refused to take power\nunless the government would allow for a stronger Presidential position.\nThe people of France conceded, and in 1958 the Fifth Republic was formed with a strong\nauthoritarianPresident. However,DeGaulle\u2019ssolutiontotheproblemwastosimplyfreeAl-\ngeria. In 1968, university students protest over their conditions, leading to a mass working-\n151 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\nclass strike. After the failed \u201dr\u00e9gionalisation\u201d referendum, De Gaulle resigned in 1969. He\nwas followed by two right wing presidents: Georges Pompidou (elected in 1969 and de-\nceased in 1974), and Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing (elected in 1974). Abortion became legal\nunder Giscard\u2019s rule.\nFrom 1981 until 1995, Fran\u00e7oisMitterand served as President of France. He was a Socialist,\nand implemented numerous social programs. He abolished the death penalty. He instituted\nnationalized banks, insurance industries, and defense industries. Workers\u2019 wages increased\nduring his tenure and working hours were reduced. However, when the French economy\nlagged, he abandoned socialism in 1984 and the French economy revived. In 1986, the\nright won the parliamentary elections, leading to the first \u201dcohabitation\u201d period, where the\npresident and prime minister were not from the same political side. Jacques Chirac, mayor\nof Paris and founder of the RPR Gullist party, was chosen as prime minister. Mitterrand\nwas re-elected in 1988, but had to face a second \u201dcohabitation\u201d from 1993 to 1995, with\n\u00c9douard Balladur as a prime minister.\nIn 1995, Jacques Chirac, became President. He also had to face the third \u201dcohabitation\u201d,\nwith the socialist Lionel Jospin as prime minister from 1997 to 2002. Chirac was easily\nre-elected in 2002 against the extreme-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had unex-\npectedly reached the runoff, eliminating Lionel Jospin at the first round. Jacques Chirac\nthen founded a new party, the UMP, uniting the majority of the right wing. Jacques Chirac\nwas followed by Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP in 2007.\nIn 2012, Nicolas Sarkozy, very unpopular and having to deal with the economic crisis, was\ndefeated by a socialist candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n14.2.3 Germany\nFigure 52 Allied occupation zones in post-war Berlin\n152 Western Europe 1945-Present\nAfter World War II, Germany was divided into zones according to agreements reached\nbetweentheallypowers. WesternzoneswereplacedunderAmericanandWesternEuropean\ncontrol, while the eastern zones came under the control of the Soviet Union. Germany was\nto be occupied by the allies until some point in the future; how this was to be achieved\nitself became a source of conflict between the allies. This division of Germany also mirrored\nthe presence of Allied troops in the now liberated countries of Europe. The Soviet army\nmaintained a military presence in Poland, Romania and other eastern european states.\nAmerican troops were still stationed in many western european states. With the war at an\nend the concord between the USA and Russia was now faltering and Germany and many\nof its neighbours were soon to become the center stage for an ideological battle between\nthese once allies. The division of Berlin was a precursor to the Cold War; the first post-war\narena for the entrenched differences between Russia and the USA and an ominous sign for\nthe later conflicts of Vietnam and Korea.\nIn 1948, the Berlin Airlift took place. Berlin was in the eastern part of Germany admin-\nistered by the Soviets though the city itself was administered by France, America, Britain\nand the Soviets. The western Allies had merged the three occupation zones they possessed\nafter the end of World War II. The prelude to the blockade involved a gradual escalation\nof tension. At first the Soviets moved troops to borders and this itself prompted Ameri-\ncan intelligence to consider that the Soviets may be seeking further territorial expansion.\nThe Russians then issued orders to General Dratvin (Russian command in Berlin) that\nall trains entering Berlin would now need to be inspected and the appropiate paperwork\nmust be present. This was relayed to General Clay (US command in Berlin) who cabled\nthe letter to Washington. The Washington administration came to the conclusion that im-\nminent invasion of West Germany was highly unlikely and that the purpose of the recent\nRussian movement was aimed at removing the Allied powers from Berlin itself. The Rus-\nsians increased the pressure with new inspection posts on roads and canals into Berlin. In\nMarch 1948 nine British registered barges were held at Buchhorst and in April British and\nAmerican military trains were detained at Marienborn on the basis that the Russians had\nnot been allowed to inspect them. The autobahns also came under pressure with the Rus-\nsians insisting that Britain evacuate two Emergency Aid stations on the Belin to Helmstedt\nautobahn. On the 18th June 1948 the Allies issued a new currency called the Deutsche\nMark which replaced the Reichsmark and on the same day Russia suspends all road and\ntrain travel to and from Berlin. On the 4th August the Allies officially started the airlift to\nsupply Berlin.\nIn 1949, the two areas were formally split into the Federal Republic in the West and the\nGerman Democratic Republic (GDR) in the East. In addition, the Basic Law, Germany\u2019s\nconstitution, came into effect in 1949.\nFrom 1949 until 1963, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, a member of the Christian Democrat\nParty (CDU), came to power in West Germany and pursued a policy of integration with\nNATO and the US led Western alliance. Adenauer successfully resisted domestic politi-\ncal pressures for Germany to adopt a policy of neutrality between the Cold War blocs as\na path to reunification. Under him West Germany encountered the Wirtschaftswunder ,\nor Economic Miracle, with great recovery throughout the nation. The country underwent\ndenazification which involved censoring of fascist ideas and the showing of films taken at\nDachau and other concentration camps to German cinema audiences. The education sys-\ntem in Germany was also subject to denazification with text books discarded due to their\n153 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\ninclusion of Nazi propaganda. The Nuremberg Trials is the most visible example of de-\nnazification during this period since it involved the highest Nazi party members though\nthousands were tried at a local level by the Allies. One of the problems the Allies faced\nwith denazification was that to remove all Nazis would have left a Germany struggling to\nreconstruct itself. In many respects Germans who had been complicit in Hitler\u2019s pogroms\nhad escaped retribution because either they hadn\u2019t come to the attention of the Allies or\nthey were part of the balancing act of German reconstruction.\nIn 1961, East German authorities, with Soviet backing, erected the Berlin Wall to stop the\nfloodofrefugeesescapingtothewest. BothAdenauerandhisparliamentaryopponents, the\nSocial Democrats, considered the GDR to be an occupied part of a legally unified German\nnation, but were not in a position to change these circumstances because of the Cold War\nconfrontation between the US and USSR. Berlin\u2019s importance as the first arena of the Cold\nWar is reflected in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Released classified documents about the\nCuban Crisis show an American administration worried that any sign of weakness during\nthe Cuban Crisis may lead to Soviet aggression in Berlin. The zones of 1945 had become\na border by 1962 and Berlin had a wall of concrete and barbwire. This is where the Cold\nWar started and this is where it would have to end.\nFrom 1963 until 1966, Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of the CDU served, followed by Kurt\nGeorg Kiesinger.\nFrom 1969 until 1974, Chancellor Willy Brandt, of the Social Democrats (SPD) came to\npower. He enacted Ostpolitik , a policy of economic friendship and trade with the eastern\nbloc and East Germany. Though he supported the NATO alliance, Brandt\u2019s overtures to\ntheeastearnedhimsuspicioninsomeWesterncirclesthathemighttradeoffthealliancefor\nGerman unification. Ironically, Brandt\u2019s government fell in a scandal over an East German\nspy within his office. His successor as chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, was also from the SPD\n(1974-1982).\nFrom 1982 through 1998, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the CDU served. In 1989 he was in\noffice when the Berlin Wall fell, as Gorbachev abandoned the Brezhnev Doctrine of Soviet\nprotectionforothercommunistregimes. In1990thetwoportionsofGermanyreunified,but\nthe East German economy lags far behind that of West Germany, even today. Chancellor\nKohl, styling himself a conservative in a similar mold to Ronald Reagan and Margaret\nThatcher, cut welfare spending and taxes, helping the economy.\nFrom 1998 through 2006, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of the SPD served. He is most\nprominently known for his adamant opposition to the US led invasion of Iraq as well as for\nlargely abolishing unemployment insurance benefits in the so-called Hartz reforms.\nAfter elections in 2006, Angela Merkel became Chancellor and is a member of the CDU.\n154 The European Union\n14.3 The European Union\nFigure 53 Flag of the European Union\nThe Franco-Prussian War, World War I, and World War II have left an indelible mark on\nmodern Europe. The ferocity and destruction of these wars has led to a concerted effort by\neuropean leaders to secure a lasting peace in Europe. At a political level it was agreed that\nthe best method would be to unite the nations economically and politically. Thus began\nthe European Union (EU).\n14.3.1 Members\nThere are currently 28 members of the European Union. The original six members were\nFrance, (West) Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Between 1973\nand 1986, Denmark, Ireland, Britain, Greece, Portugal, and Spain1 joined the EU. The\nemblem of the European Union is a blue flag with twelve gold stars on it. In 1995, Austria,\nFinland, and Sweden joined the EU. Nine years later ten countries were admitted - Poland,\nCzech Republic, Slovak Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta\nand Cyprus. The number of EU members rose again in January 2007 with the addition\nof Romania and Bulgaria and in July 2013 when Croatia joined. Macedonia, Montenegro,\nSerbia, and Turkey are currently in talks about future possible membership of the EU.\n14.3.2 Background\nIn 1944 the Bretton Woods agreement created the World Trade Organization (WTO) that\nfightstoeliminatetariffsandpromotefreetrade. ItestablishedtheWorldBank, whichpro-\nvides loans to less-developed countries, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which\nprovides loans to countries in economic crisis to prevent the collapse of their government.\n1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain\n155 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\nThe agreement also fixed exchange rates for currencies, which became floating exchange\nrates in 1971.\nIn 1945 the United Nations was established.\nIn 1951, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established with Belgium,\nWest Germany, Luxembourg, France, Italy, and the Netherlands as members.\nIn 1957, the Treaties of Rome established the European Atomic Energy Community (EU-\nRATOM) and the European Economic Community (EEC). The members removed trade\nbarriers between themselves and formed a \u201dCommon Market.\u201d\nIn 1992, the Treaty of Maastricht provided for cooperation in law enforcement, criminal\njustice, civil judicial matters, and asylum and immigration.\nIn 2004, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slove-\nnia, Malta, and Cyprus were admitted into the EU.\nIn 2007, Romania and Bulgaria were admitted as members of the EU.\nIn 2013, Croatia was admitted as a member of the EU.\n14.4 The Soviet Union\nThe Soviet Union after the war found itself in a position to secure its borders and to\nadvance its own economic and political ideology into neighbouring states. They rejected\nthe Marshall Plan and set up an alternative solution known as the Cominform. Russian\ntroops had been first to enter Berlin and Stalin for all his faults was an astute politician\nwho saw in this situation the chance to turn Russia into a world power. The Red Army was\nto maintain a presence in many of the countries it had liberated. The Americans who had\nwanted to extricate themselves from Europe\u2019s arena now found themselves drawn further\ninto the tangled borders of Europe. The Cold War had started.\n14.4.1 Nikita Khrushchev 1953-1964\nKhrushchev reversed many of Stalin\u2019s policies through a process which became known as\n\u201dDestalinization\u201d. This time period is known as \u201dThe Thaw\u201d, since tensions between the US\nand the USSR became more relaxed. The theory of peaceful coexistence, which believed\nthatthecommunistnationscouldliveinpeacewiththedemocraciesoftheWest,wasspread\nthroughout the Soviet Union by Khrushchev, who attended peace summits in Geneva and\nCamp David. In addition, Khrushchev attempted to modernize Russia and to give its\ncitizens more freedom. He rid the USSR. of purges and eliminated show trials, replacing\nthem with actual court systems. He gave more latitude to the 6 Eastern European states,\nand also allowed more freedom of speech and criticism of Stalin. At the 1956 XX Party\nCongress, Khrushchev announced that Stalin had indeed made many mistakes during his\nreign.\nKhrushchev tried to reform collectivized agriculture and to shake up the Communist Party\nin order to remove inefficiency, so the Party forced him out in 1964.\n156 The Soviet Union\nThe West regards Khrushchev as generally unpredictable, especially considering his actions\nin the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\n14.4.2 Leonid Brezhnev (1964-1982)\nAfter Khrushchev\u2019s removal from office, Leonid Brezhnev came to power. He was widely\nseen as humorless, colorless, and unimaginative. He brought an end to destalinization and\nis blamed for bringing an era of stagnation to the Soviet Union.\nBrezhneviswellknownfor hisBrezhnevDoctrine, whichpromised tointerveneifa socialist\nregimewasthreatened. DuringBrezhnev\u2019sreign,in1968,therewasrevolutioninCzechoslo-\nvakia. Alexander Dub\u010dek was elected leader of the communist party, and he called for free\npress, democracy, and other parties. In this sense he curbed repression, and he advocated\n\u201dSocialism with a Human Face\u201d in what has become known as the \u201dPrague Spring\u201d - that is,\nmore rights, more consumer goods, and more freedom. However, the Soviets invaded the\ncountry and crushed this new government in August 1968.\nUnder Brezhnev, the United States and the Soviet Union underwent D\u00e9tente , which was\nin essence a relaxation of tensions between the two nations. This occurred primarily be-\ncause both countries recognized the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction , which stems\nfrom a realisation that the proliferation of nuclear arms had ensured that each nation had\nenoughwarheadstoguaranteeeachother\u2019sdestruction. Itwasduringthisperiodthatmany\ncountries witnessed the rise of campaigns for nuclear disarmament by the general public.\nThesecampaignsformedadefiningsocialphenomenaduringthedecadesofthe60sand70s,\nespecially within the NATO countries, and in some part must have helped in the \u201dthaw\u201d of\nthe Cold War.\nIn 1975 both NATO and Warsaw Pact members signed the Helsinki Accords. In these,\nthe West recognized the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe, and the Soviets promised to\nrespect the civil rights of people living in the occupied territories.\nBrezhnevhadagreatdealoftroubleduringhisrule. In1977Czechdissidents, ledbywriter\nV\u00e1clav Havel, signed a manifesto called the Charter 77 that demanded human rights, free\nexpression, freedom of religion, and the right to organize. Then, from 1980 until 1989, the\nSoviet Union was engaged in military action in Afghanistan in support of the communist\ngovernment who were fighting a war with Muslim anti-communists. The USSR eventually\nwithdrew their troops after a stale-mate was reached and russian casualties had mounted.\nBrezhnev presided over the USSR for longer than any other but Stalin, and there was never\na plot to take his position. He was allowed to grow old in office, and died on November 10,\n1982 at the age of 75. He was succeeded by Yuri Andropov, then Konstantin Chernenko,\nboth of whom ruled for only around a year, and had little real impact on the Soviet Union.\nBoth were very physically unhealthy, died soon after being in office, and Chernenko was\nsucceeded by the reformist Mikhail Gorbachev.\n157 Chapter 14 - Europe: 1945 to Present\n14.4.3 Mikhail Gorbachev (1985-1991)\nFigure 54 Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.\nWith the Soviet Union on the verge of economic collapse, a young, vigorous, and creative\nGeneral Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power. Gorbachev created the policy of\nGlasnost,or\u201dOpenness,\u201dwhichallowedcriticism(albeitlimited)ofthesystem,examination\nof past mistakes, rehabilitated victims of the purge, and changed textbooks in the nation.\nHe also implemented Perestroika , or \u201dEconomic Restructuring.\u201d He decentralized the econ-\nomy, offered incentives to managers for increased production and quality and allowed them\nto make more decisions, introduced elements of \u201dworking place democracy\u201d, and allowed\npeasants to lease their own land.\nHowever, these economic policies actually failed, and the situation became increasingly\nworse. The Soviet Union encountered massive problems in the 1990s, including alcoholism,\ndivorce, a high abortion rate, low life expectancy, and no consumer goods.\nRevolutions of 1988-1990\nIn 1988 Lithuanian liberation movement - Sajudis, Latvian - Tautas fronte, Estonian -\nRahvarinne were created and soon they started struggle for independence of the Baltic\nstates.\nIn 1989, a number of Eastern bloc states began to revolt against Soviet authority.\nThe spark of it all occurred in 1989, when declining conditions in Poland forced Poland\nto legalize Lech Walesa\u2019s \u201dSolidarity\u201d Party. The party won control of the government in\na landslide election. Gorbachev then told the Eastern Bloc satellite states that he cannot\nenforce the Brezhnev Doctrine. As a result, other nations followed Poland\u2019s lead. Hungary\nheld elections, relaxed economic controls, and opened its door to the West. The Czechoslo-\nvakian and Bulgarian communist governments collapsed without bloodshed in what has\n158 The Soviet Union\nbecome known as the \u201dVelvet Revolution.\u201d In East Germany, Germans flooded to Hungary\nand then to the West. The Communist leader of East Germany, Honecker, was forced to\nstep down, and the Berlin wall was torn down on November 9, 1989. In Romania, Nicolae\nCeau\u015fescu, a brutal Stalinist dictator, was executed on December 25th 1989. Ceau\u015fescu\nwas the only leader to be executed during the Eastern Bloc uprising and Romania itself the\nonly country to violently overthrow its Communist regime.\nThe Break Up Of The Soviet Union\nThe failure of Glasnost and Perestroika to revive the situation in the Soviet Union resulted\nin its demise.\nIn 1989, the first competitive elections since 1917 were held for the Soviet Congress of\nPeople\u2019s Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was elected and became a leader of the opposition in the\nU.S.S.R. In 1990, other parties became officially tolerated, and in June 1991 Yeltsin was\nelected President of Russia. On August 19 - 21, 1991, a coup of communist hard-liners\noccurred while Gorbachev was in the Crimea. Yeltsin led non-violent resistance to the\ncoup, which ultimately prevailed and saw all the coup leaders arrested or commit suicide.\nOn August 24, 1991, the Communist Party was banned in Russia. December 31, 1991, the\nSoviet Union officially ceased to exist and was replaced with 15 independent states.\nvi:L\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u00e2u \u00c2u/Ch\u00e2u \u00c2u t\u1eeb 1945 \u0111\u1ebfn hi\u1ec7n t\u1ea1i2\nhttp://vi.wikibooks.org/wiki/L%E1%BB%8Bch%20s%E1%BB%AD%20ch%C3%A2u%20%C3%82u%2FCh%C3%\n2\nA2u%20%C3%82u%20t%E1%BB%AB%201945%20%C4%91%E1%BA%BFn%20hi%E1%BB%87n%20t%E1%BA%A1i\n159  15 Glossary\nA1 B2 C3 D4 E5 F6 G7 H8 I9 J10 K11 L12 M13 N14 O15 P16 Q17 R18 S19\nT20 U21 V22 W23 X24 Y25 Z26\n15.1 A\n\u2022 Absolutism27 - Political theory that one person should hold all power; in some cases\njustified by \u201dDivine Right of Kings.\u201d\n\u2022 Act of Supremacy28 (1534) - Act of Parliament under King Henry VIII of England\ndeclaring the king as the head of the Church of England, making official the English\nReformation; (1559) reinstatement of the original act by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\u2022 Adam Smith29 (1723-1790)-Scottisheconomistandphilosopher, authorofThe Wealth\nof Nations , thought of as the father of capitalist economics.\n1 Chapter15.1onpage161\n2 Chapter15.2onpage163\n3 Chapter15.3onpage164\n4 Chapter15.4onpage167\n5 Chapter15.5onpage168\n6 Chapter15.6onpage169\n7 Chapter15.7onpage170\n8 Chapter15.8onpage171\n9 Chapter15.9onpage172\n10 Chapter15.10onpage172\n11 Chapter15.11onpage173\n12 Chapter15.12onpage174\n13 Chapter15.13onpage174\n14 Chapter15.14onpage176\n15 Chapter15.15onpage177\n16 Chapter15.16onpage177\n17 Chapter15.17onpage179\n18 Chapter15.18onpage179\n19 Chapter15.19onpage181\n20 Chapter15.20onpage182\n21 Chapter15.21onpage183\n22 Chapter15.22onpage183\n23 Chapter15.23onpage184\n24 Chapter15.24onpage184\n25 Chapter15.25onpage184\n26 Chapter15.26onpage185\n27 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutism\n28 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act%20of%20Supremacy\n29 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%20Smith\n161 Glossary\n\u2022 Age of Enlightenment30 - An intellectual movement in 18th century Europe marked\nby rational thinking, in contrast with the superstition of the Dark Ages.\n\u2022 Albert Einstein31 (1879\u20131955) - Physicist who proposed the theory of relativity and\nmade advances in quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and cosmology.\n\u2022 Alexander Kerensky32 (1881-1970) - The second prime minister of the Russian Pro-\nvisional Government, immediately before the Bolsheviks and Lenin came to power.\n\u2022 Algeciras Conference33 - Took place in 1906 in Algeciras, Spain.

Both\ncovers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front\ncover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.\nYou may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the\n199 GNU Free Documentation License\ncovers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can\nbe treated as verbatim copying in other respects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the\nfirst ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto\nadjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you\nmust either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,\nor state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\nnetwork-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a\ncomplete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\ncopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the\nstated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy\n(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before\nredistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an\nupdated version of the Document.\n19.5 4. MODIFICATIONS\nYou may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions\nof sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely\nthis License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing\ndistribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In\naddition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\n1. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the\nDocument, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be\nlisted in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a\nprevious version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\n2. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for\nauthorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five\nof the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer\nthan five), unless they release you from this requirement.\n3. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the\npublisher.\n4. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.\n5. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other\ncopyright notices.\n6. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public\npermission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form\nshown in the Addendum below.\n7. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover\nTexts given in the Document\u2019s license notice.\n8. Include an unaltered copy of this License.\n200 4. MODIFICATIONS\n9. PreservethesectionEntitled\u201dHistory\u201d,PreserveitsTitle,andaddtoitanitemstating\nat least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on\nthe Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201dHistory\u201d in the Document, create one\nstating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title\nPage, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous\nsentence.\n10. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a\nTransparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the\nDocumentforpreviousversionsitwasbasedon. Thesemaybeplacedinthe\u201dHistory\u201d\nsection. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four\nyears before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to\ngives permission.\n11. For any section Entitled \u201dAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201dDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of\nthe section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the\ncontributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.\n12. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in\ntheir titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section\ntitles.\n13. Delete any section Entitled \u201dEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in\nthe Modified version.\n14. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201dEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title\nwith any Invariant Section.\n15. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.\nIf the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as\nSecondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your\noption designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to\nthe list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be\ndistinct from any other section titles.\nYou may add a section Entitled \u201dEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorse-\nments of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review\nor that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a\nstandard.\nYou may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up\nto 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified\nVersion. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added\nby (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes\na cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the\nsame entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the\nold one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.\nThe author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to\nuse their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.\n201 GNU Free Documentation License\n19.6 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS\nYou may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under\nthe terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the\ncombination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and\nlist them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you\npreserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\nInvariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\nSections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section\nunique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to\nthe section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\nInthecombination,youmustcombineanysectionsEntitled\u201dHistory\u201dinthevariousoriginal\ndocuments, forming one section Entitled \u201dHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled\n\u201dAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201dDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections\nEntitled \u201dEndorsements\u201d.\n19.7 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS\nYou may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under\nthis License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with\na single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this\nLicense for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually\nunder this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document,\nand follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n19.8 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT\nWORKS\nA compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent\ndocuments or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\u201daggregate\u201difthecopyrightresultingfromthecompilationisnotusedtolimitthelegalrights\nof the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document\nis included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate\nwhich are not themselves derivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\nappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n202 8. TRANSLATION\n19.9 8. TRANSLATION\nTranslation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the\nDocument under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations\nrequires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations\nof some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant\nSections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in\nthe Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original\nEnglish version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In\ncase of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a\nnotice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled \u201dAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201dDedications\u201d, or \u201dHistory\u201d,\nthe requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing\nthe actual title.\n19.10 9. TERMINATION\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly pro-\nvided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute\nit is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copy-\nright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly\nand finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to\nnotify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the\ncopyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\ntime you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright\nholder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\nterminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same\nmaterial does not give you any rights to use it.\n19.11 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Doc-\numentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to\nthe present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201dor any later version\u201d applies\nto it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\n203 GNU Free Documentation License\nversion or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nDocument specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be\nused, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Document.\n19.12 11. RELICENSING\n\u201dMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201dMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web\nserverthatpublishescopyrightableworksandalsoprovidesprominentfacilitiesforanybody\nto edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.\nA \u201dMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201dMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of\ncopyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.\n\u201dCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published\nby Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of\nbusiness in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license\npublished by that same organization.\n\u201dIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of\nanother Document.\nAn MMC is \u201deligible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that\nwere first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently\nincorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,\nand (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.\nThe operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-\nSA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for\nrelicensing.\n204 20 How to use this License for your\ndocuments\nTo use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the\ndocument and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:\nCopyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME.\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3\nor any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;\nwith no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.\nA copy of the license is included in the section entitled \u201dGNU\nFree Documentation License\u201d.\nIf you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the\n\u201dwith...Texts.\u201d line with this:\nwith the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the\nFront-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.\nIf you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three,\nmerge those two alternatives to suit the situation.\nIf your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing\nthese examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU\nGeneral Public License, to permit their use in free software.\n205  21 Contributors\nEdits User\n31 Adrignola1\n1 Ajraddatz2\n2
