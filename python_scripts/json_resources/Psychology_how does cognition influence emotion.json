Attention and feeling are two processes that play a role\nwith any thought a person may have. A feeling could encourage or inhibit a thought or\nan attentional process (or both). There are many questions to ponder about thoughts,\nfeelings and how they work in the mind. - For instance, how does the content of the\nthought influence the experience of the thought? If you think a happy thought does\nthat always bring up a happy feeling, or does it bring up a negative one? Does it make\nyou think faster or slower? How does it change your experience of time and emotion?\nFinally, if a thought is harder or easier to understand, how does that change the\nnature and experience of the thought (or thought process)?\nExecutive functioning is by definition how the mind manages its own cognitive\nprocesses. Executive functions (also known as cognitive control and supervisory\nattentional system) is an umbrella term for the management (regulation, control) of\ncognitive processes1, including working memory, reasoning, task flexibility, and\nproblem solving2as well as planning and execution.3\nIs Attention Necessary for Consciousness?\nThis question is related to executive functioning because you could say that a humans\nmind pays attention to all of its cognitive processes, and that this attention is part of\nthe same attention capacity that a human notices it has. People can notice what they\nare looking at, if they are focused on their emotions or thoughts, or what they are\ndoing and if they are paying attention to that.\nThe type of attention peoplehave that they aren't aware of is the more scientific\ncognitive abilities their mind has that it is doing while they are doing something they\ncan notice themselves. For instance if your mind is inhibiting a feeling you might not\nnotice that, or if you are pulling up information or experiences from memory you\nmight not notice that either.\nA more complex cognitive ability that uses attentional resources is thinking. You might\nbe using words consciously or unconsciously to think about something. You might also\nbe using experiences or memories or visions (all consciously or unconsciously) to think\n1.Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin.

People use a term psychologists and cognitive scientists termed\n'schema' to help think (schema are sort of the 'already learned' aspect of thinking):\nSchema\n\u2022 In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or schemas)\ndescribes an organized pattern of thought or behavior that organizes categories\nof information and the relationships among them.4It can also be described as a\nmental structure of preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect\nof the world, or a system of organizing and perceiving new information. 5\nSchemata influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are\nmore likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while re-interpreting\ncontradictions to the schema as exceptions or distorting them to fit. Schemata\nhave a tendency to remain unchanged, even in the face of contradictory\ninformation. Schemata can help in understanding the world and the rapidly\nchanging environment. People can organize new perceptions into schemata\nquickly as most situations do not require complex thought when using schema,\nsince automatic thought is all that is required.6\n\u2022 People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a framework for\nfuture understanding. Examples of schemata include academic rubrics, social\nschemas, stereotypes, social roles, scripts, worldviews, and archetypes. In Piaget's\ntheory of development, children construct a series of schemata to understand the\nworld.\n\u2022 Through the use of schemata, a heuristic technique to encode and retrieve\nmemories, the majority of typical situations do not require much strenuous\nprocessing. People can quickly organize new perceptions into schemata and act\nwithout effort.7\nSo basically people use preconceived notions of the world (termed 'schema') to help\nthemselves think. It makes sense that it is easier to think if you have the experience or\nthought (or some of the experience or thought) already thought out.\nImplicit Processesing and Attention\nDual process theories often have a controlled (or explicit) process and an automatic\n(or unconscious, implicit process). Here is Jan De Houwer and Agnes Moors (Houwer,\nMoors):\n\u2022 We propose implicit processes are processes that possess features of\nautomaticity. Because different automaticity features do not necessarily co-occur,\nwe recommend specifying the automaticity features one has in mind when using\nthe term implicit.\n\u2022 The starting point of our analysis is the postulate that the meaning of the term\nimplicit is identical to the meaning of the term automatic.\n4.DiMaggio, P. (1997). Culture and cognition.

According to this view, it is relatively easy to diagnose a process as\nautomatic. It suffices to demonstrate that the process possesses one of the\nautomaticity features. If it has one of the features, it can be assumed to have all\nother automaticity feature and thus to be fully automatic.\n\u2022 It became clear, however, that the different automaticity features do not always\ncooccur. Evidence from Stroop studies, for instance, suggests that the processing\nof word meaning is automatic in that it does not depend on the intention to\nprocess the meaning of the word. At the same time, word processing is non-\nautomatic in that it depends on the allocation of attention to the word\nRainer Banse and Roland Imhoff outline some social cognitive dual process theories:\n\u2022 Unlike the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious as a powerful monitoring\nsystem that strategically decides whether pieces of information are allowed to\nbecome conscious or not, contemporary social cognition theories rather assume\nthat implicit content can operate outside of awareness because it is automatically\nactivated. Contemporary dual-process theories postulate two distinct information\nprocessing systems. For example, the Reflective- Impulsive Model of social\nbehavior by Strack and Deutsch (2004) distinguishes a reflective and an impulsive\nsystem of information processing. The reflective system is based on propositional\nknowledge representations (i.e., information in the form of declarative sentences\nthat are either true or false) and can perform complex, logical operations. This\nsystem is flexible and powerful, but it requires cognitive resources and allocation\nof attention. The impulsive system is based on an associative network and\noperates by the principle of spreading activation. Unlike the reflective system the\nimpulsive system operates in an automatic fashion and does not require\ncognitive resources or the allocation of attention. However, the fact that\nautomatic or implicit processes do not require attention does not imply that the\ncontent or outcome of implicit processes are ipso facto unconscious.\nThey mention that the impulsive system (which would be the unconscious) \"operates\nin an automatic fashion and does not require cognitive resources or the allocation of\nattention\". However, if your mind is doing something then in a way you are giving it\nattention. It really depends on how you define attention. They say it doesn't require\ncognitive resources or the allocation of attention because they mean conscious\nattention that people notice. And by 'cognitive resources' they mean conscious\ncognitive resources, which are more limited than unconscious resources.\nUnconscious resources are more limited than cognitive resources because when you\nthink consciously it requires more effort then if you just do something unconsciously.\nTo make a process conscious you have to think about it more consciously and\ndeliberately to yourself. If your mind is doing something by itself and it comes easily\nand naturally then you don't have to think about it as much and it is then more\nautomatic, faster, and requires less resources. - However, that doesn't mean that you\naren't paying attention to it. In experiences where basketball players get a 'hot hand'\nand experience what is termed 'flow' in psychology, then they are operating more\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 1 4\nunconsciously because the unconscious is more efficient than conscious processes.\nThey can ignore things bothering them or disrupting a high performance better.\nSo when they say 'the impulsive system operates in an automatic fashion and does\nnot require cognitive resources or the allocation of attention' they really mean it just\ndoesn't require as much, if you think about how such processes would play out in\nreality - then they clearly use cognitive resources and the allocation of attention - the\nimpulsive system never acts alone, conscious effort is always involved with any action,\njust not as much or maybe only a little when the impulsive or unconscious system is\nengaged.\nSo if a human mind is using explicit and implicit processes (by that I mean conscious\nand unconscious processes) how much attention is the person giving the process, and\nare they consciously or unconsciously directing it (in other words, how 'meta' or how\nmuch are they consciously thinking about their unconscious and conscious cognitive\nprocesses)? Here is Sun and Matthews on metacognition and dual- process theories:\n\u2022 Thus, combining these two points of view, we may argue that both implicit and\nexplicit cognitive processes are involved in metacognition. Reder (1987) took a\nview similar to this, in that she posited that a two-stage process was involved in\njudgment that invoked implicit similarity-based processes first and then a more\nexplicit, deliberative, and analytical process that examines individual dimensions\nof stimuli. Narens et al (1996) also appeared to indicate that metacognitive\njudgments (such as feeling of knowing) might be the result of both explicit and\nimplicit processes, because such judgments are equally predictive of explicit and\nimplicit memory.\n\u2022 Norman and Shallice's (1986) view is more akin to our view here. They posited the\ncoexistence of two kinds of processes: (1) fast, automatic processes, which are\ntriggered by stimuli and are inflexible; (2) slow, conscious processes, which are\nindependent of stimuli and are flexible. The former is used in skilled\nperformance, while the latter deals mostly with novel situations. In the former,\ndifferent schemata can be triggered by stimuli and, through lateral inhibition,\ncompete to be activated (which is termed \"contention scheduling\" by Norman\nand Shallice). In novel (nonroutine) situations, however, a supervisory attentional\nsystem decides on schemata selection and overrides automatic processes and\ntheir contention scheduling. Shallice and Burgess (1991) divided supervisory\nprocesses into four cate- gories: (1) plan formulation and modification, (2) marker\ncreation and triggering, (3) goal articulation, and (4) memory organization. (These\naspects are encompassed by our model.)\n\u2022 Note that our view of top-down influences here is opposed to the view of Reder\nand Schunn (1996), which believes that metacognitive strategy selection cannot\nbe taught explicitly. Our emphasis of bottom-up influences is also contrary to the\nview that metacognitive activities are necessarily implicit. Our view is that\nmetacognitive processes are implicit in a variety of circumstances: such as during\ninitial learning of such skills through trial and error, when such processes are well\npracticed (so that no explicit deliberation is necessary), or when cognitive load is\nhigh (so that explicit metacognitive processes may interfere with regular\nprocesses and degrade performance). In other circumstances, they may become\nexplicit.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 5\nThe last three quotes about dual-process theories explained that there are\nunconscious processes that are not controlled - when first learning a skill or a\nmaterial, conscious direction and metacognitive processes are more necessary,\nhowever as it becomes more automatic it becomes more unconscious.\nBut what does it mean when they say that 'metacognitive processes are are implicit in\na variety or circumstances'? What does that mean exactly? I would say that thinking\ndirectly about something too much interferes with processing - it is clearly easier and\nmore efficient to do something more unconsciously. However, you aren't necessarily\nlearning as much or you might not understand what is going on as much if you are\ndoing something unconsciously.\n1.1 How the Mind Works\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThrough a discussion of schema and dual-process theories I introduced a little of how\nthe mind thinks. The mind conceives notions of the world and stores these notions or\nideas in their mind as schema. The mind also works consciously and unconsciously -\nfrom the ideas of dual process theories 'system 1' is the unconscious; which is low\neffort, large capacity, rapid, automatic, non-verbal and non-logical while 'system 2' -\nbasically the conscious mind - is the opposite.\nI guess the question is when exactly is system 1 and system 2 engaged? Are some\nthoughts strictly 'unconscious' while other thoughts strictly 'conscious' - or can a\nthought have unconscious components? Similarly, can a performance or action have\nconscious and unconscious aspects?\nWhenever a behavior is more automatic it is then more learned and unconscious\nbecause you don't have to think about it as much as when you learned it or are\nthinking about it in a new way or something. I already mentioned how this is similar to\nunderstanding what in psychology is termed 'flow' or in sports is simply termed being\nin the 'zone'. Conscious thinking and feeling can be difficult or easy - it is probably\neasier when you are using unconscious processes and influences because then the\nthinking or feeling is more automatic.\n1.1.1 How the Mind Thinks\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nPeople automatically use metaphors and analogies to compare and contrast ideas and\ninformation in their mind. Obviously visions or images are going to be used to help\ndescribe some of the concepts that are being compared. A concept might not need a\nvision; however, if it doesn't have a simple vision tied to it. For instance if you think of\na person then the vision of a person might be connected; however your description of\nthat persons personality - if they a nice or mean, smart of stupid - wouldn't have a\nsimple vision tied to it because you are describing behavior. You might pull up various\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 1 6\nvisions of them being nice or stupid in order to reinforce the concepts - however they\nare probably less tied to vision than concepts that are more simply visual.\nHumans minds use schema to store complex sets of information or ideas. In this way\nunderstanding of the world can build and change when your current ideas and\nconcepts are challenged by new information. Schema are not likely to change easily,\nhowever, as people are biased and more likely to notice things that fit into their\ncurrently held ones.\nMy guess would be that some schema are more unconscious and some are more\naccessible to consciousness - probably depending on what you were doing recently\nand if it related to some of the schema you hold. In this way your thinking can be\ninfluenced by the ideas that you learned and formed in your mind into schema.\nYour unconscious mind holds many preconceived notions ('schema') and uses\nmetaphors and analogies and visions all of the time. Depending on the circumstance\ndifferent aspects of the world are going to be more accessible to consciousness. In\nthis way the unconscious mind and conscious mind work together to help guide\nthoughts and feelings - depending on how unconscious a thought or feeling is helps to\ndetermine if it is logical, verbal, or easy to process (all of those are aspects of 'system\n1' or the unconscious) or not.\n1.2 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Houwer, J. + Moors, A.

I could say that it uses images to think,\nand that these images are mostly unconscious. That would be similar to having a\ndream, in a dream simple images represent larger psychological ideas and life\nexperiences. The images your mind uses to think are probably basic, similar to how a\ncomputer works with simple switches at the most simple level. The most basic and\nimportant mental images are used to represent more significant psychological 'code'\nor life experiences (like body images - since social interaction is important humans\nwould be broken down in the mind into simple visualizations).\nSo I think that the mind basically thinks by breaking down the psychological factors of\nlife into more simple images. If you have an interaction with someone, then that\ninteraction is broken down into more simple body-images and other images that\nrepresent what occurred in the interaction. These images are probably unconscious,\nyou would not notice in what order your mind is going through them or what they are\nexactly.\nThis means that your minds cognitions (such as images and thoughts) are going to\ninfluence your emotions. The real world is broken down into thoughts and\nvisualizations (or psychological 'symbols') in your mind, and these mental processes\ninfluence your emotions.\n2.1 Introduction (Part 2)\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThere are two major types of emotional experience - one is the obvious one which\npeople experience daily and that is the major emotions they are experiencing as a\nresult of their activities. The other type of emotional experience is one that is driven\nby deep unconscious factors, and it relates to your strong inner motivations, hopes,\nfears, expectations for the future, and how you perceive reality.\nIf you think about it, this makes sense. Emotion is generated by obvious factors - such\nas person A causes an emotional reaction in person B - and less obvious factors - such\nas person A has a strong inner desire to save lives, so when they see things that\nremind them of this, strong emotions are invoked. Emotions that are generated by\nstrong, possibly hidden inner desires are much less obvious than emotions that are\nthe direct result of experiences.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 8\nIt is hard to measure emotion in both cases though. You can guess that if someone is\ndoing a fun activity they are going to experience the emotion of 'fun' or other 'happy'\nemotions, but guessing what someones inner desires and motivations are is probably\ngoing to be much more\nThis relates to important concepts that influence how you perceive life, and how your\nemotions are generated. If you think about it, it makes sense that there are going to\nbe emotional reasons you do things that you aren't aware of the motivation for all of\nthe time. One of these important factors is a concept called \"consciousness\" -\nsomething could feel differently to you simply because you became more aware of it.\nThe thing is new or different now. This concept of consciousness applies to all\nemotional things, you can become more conscious of one thing or feeling, or more\nconscious of yourself as a person as a whole.\nI would say that how someone is processing their emotions changes how time feels, -\ntheir perception of time. If you are more conscious of certain emotions or just more\nconscious in general it could make any activity more difficult because you have to\nwork to attain that consciousness. This is similar to saying that you should do an\nactivity that is hard when it is least hard for you to do it. There are going to be certain\nconditions when things are going to be easier - - then your perception of reality and\ntime might be\nAnother way of describing consciousness is just how clear a feeling or something is to\nyou. If a feeling is more clear, then you are more conscious of it. This is like\nunderstanding why you like some things more than others, some things you know\nbetter how much you like after you spend time\nI guess the question then is how is someone supposed to know when something\nemotional is more clear to them. Your emotions could be making you feel a lot of\nthings that you aren't aware of you are experiencing.\nThis is similar to having a hidden bias against someone or a group of people that you\naren't aware of you have. I would say that you can observe these emotional\nphenomena through behavior, probably subtle behavior. That is similar to a painters\nstrokes being influenced by their emotions. You can see how the painter is feeling by\nhow they paint - their unconscious emotions are probably going to influence how they\nare feeling about the painting.\nThere are ways of interpreting cognitive information emotionally. Something can be\nimaginative, logical, happy, persuasive, or other ways in nature. For instance,\nsomething imaginative is going to make you feel differently from something that\npersuades you to do something by force. The 'imaginative' art or whatever it is is\nprobably going to be much more pleasant than when your emotions and thoughts are\nforced or persuaded to think and feel a certain way. With imagination the thoughts\nseem more pleasant because your basically creating whatever it is you want to feel by\nimagining something. Even if you are imagining a nightmare the emotional process is\nstill something you created and therefore subject to your personal bias (and people\nnaturally want themselves to be happy). However, someone can easily repeat painful\nexperiences to themselves, however that is different from imagination. With\nimagination you create the experience or magnify a real one. Magnifying a real\nexperience emotionally is a part of what imagination is - maybe my point was just that\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 9\nthings you create yourself and are more imaginative and probably going to be more\npleasant.\nThere are other factors that make unconscious operations more complicated.\nkfkkkkffkdldkflldlkfkfk\n2.2 Decision Making, Memory and Emotion Regulation\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nEmotion regulation refers to the set of processes used in response to emotional\nexperiences and how we express our reactions to emotions (Gross, 1999). - This\nmeans that decision making and memory are going to be used in the emotion\nregulation process. A humans decision making ability and his or her ability to use their\nmemory is going to be affected by the emotional nature of their experiences.

If your\nmind uses images to think, then a human's perception of the visual world is going to\ninfluence their mental thought processes.\nOr maybe you don't need a visual representation, if someone feels something around\ncertain nature scenes, like a pond, you don't necessarily need to visualize the pond.\nBeing near the pond is enough to evoke the emotions that scene brings up because\nthe pond creates a certain atmosphere, it changes the humidity in the air, and the life\naround the pond is different. So perhaps vision doesn't create most of the strong\nemotions people experience anyway.\n2.3.1 Is it Simple?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThere is a way a human's mind prioritizes information. Certain objects in life represent\ndifferent things and trigger different emotions for people.\nPeople are also sensitive to different types of emotional information. For example\nthere might be something difficult to understand emotionally that someone\nunderstands unconsciously because it is important or more obvious to their\nunconscious mind.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 10\nWhat types of information are understood unconsciously vs. consciously then? Clearly\nthere is going to be a difference - I can think of many examples off the top of my head.\nThere are simple things in life people do like knowing their schedule for a day, that\ncould be considered to be emotionally simple, and there are more complex ideas\nemotionally that people consider during a day like how to handle a debate or\nargument.\nIs there a type of 'emotional speculation' where someone guesses what something\nmight feel like? You could say that people do this all the time when they make any\ntype of emotional assessment (for instance how cool or uncool something is, or if they\nlike or dislike someone). What is emotional subtlety then? It is defined by levels of\nconscious and unconscious importance, and degree of difficulty in understanding and\nabsorbing the information.\n2.3.2 What information is absorbed consciously vs.\nunconsciously?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThat is a critical question because there are many different types of emotional\ninformation. Something can be more important emotionally if the person simply cares\nabout it more, or they could have a better understanding of the information because\nthey have experience in that field.\nWhat would be 'emotionally complex' pieces of information then? If the information is\ncomplex is it easier to understand consciously or unconsciously? Dogs often\nunderstand beforehand when their owner is going to go on a vacation, or many other\ncomplex ideas about social interaction. Dogs also understand if a person is being nice\nor cruel to them - does that mean that a humans understanding of kindness is at the\nsame level as that of a dog? There must be more complicated ways a human\nunderstands what 'kindness' or 'cruelty' means than the understanding a dog has.\nMaybe information that is 'subjective' is information that is consciously speculated.\nUnconsciously you simply get a feel for things, but you can guess about a lot of things\nverbally - are those guesses instinctual, 'gut' guesses or are they measured\nassessments? Is anything subjective a measured assessment? Saying 'that coat looks\nnice on that person' is subjective - the person isn't doing an analysis of who likes the\ncoat on the person and who else thinks it looks good. They think it looks good - they\ndidn't do a study of what type of person thinks it looks good. The information is\nsubjective, it was triggered by their own emotions and motivations.\n2.3.3 Is Conscious Understanding Subjective or Objective?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhen someone thinks something is funny, how accurate are they?

That information also\nmeans that all conscious understanding is subjective - when someone thinks they\nunderstand something, they are going to bias it in some way.\nWhat if someone tries to be as objective as possible when making all of their\ndecisions. Then possibly all decisions that are objective in the first place (non-\nemotional decisions) and not subjective might be fairly non-biased. But then what\ntypes of assessments are non-emotional and which types are emotional? Math isn't\nemotional - scientific fact isn't emotional. That isn't to say that there isn't a type of bias\nsomeone has when they do addition. Maybe they are thinking about something else at\nthe same time and this biases possible interpretations of the objective data.\nSo it is clear that something objective is objective, and something subjective is\nsubjective, however how could someone measure differences in how subjective\nsomething is?\n2.3.4 What Classifies Material as Conscious vs. Unconscious?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nTheoretically all the information someone absorbs is going to be consciously vs.\nunconsciously absorbed to different degrees. I would say that if the information is\neasier to remember then you are using your unconscious mind (like how songs are\neasy to remember). Songs are easy to remember because they are fun, a persons\nemotions are evoked and that helps increase mental processing of the song so they\ncan recall it. The emotion 'fun' from the song (even if it is a sad song the fact that it is a\nsong is positive) or just emotion from the song helps you to remember it.\nInformation that you don't need to think about that much consciously is unconscious\ninformation as well. If you think about it, if you have to do a lot consciously - like think\nof this and that in order to remember something or think or do something, then it is\nmore conscious. If it is done more automatically then it is more unconscious.\nI would say that all emotional information is more unconscious. Dreams are emotional\nbecause you are not conscious during them. That is why they don't make sense,\nbecause you are not thinking (lol). Does this mean that someone thinking a lot is going\nto be less emotional? That is hard to say because you can't really define when\nsomeone as thinking a lot or not. If someone is watching a movie, they are probably\nthinking less then when during a history exam.\nSo my theory is that knowing how emotional something is can help classify if it is\nintellectually intense or not. For example - which would use more thought, a math test\nor a history test? In history you use emotional information to help remember the\nfacts. What happened in history is emotional and social. Math is logical, it is clear how\nto get the result if you understand how things work in a concrete, straightforward way.\n(I am not saying that calculus is straightforward, I am just saying that it makes sense\nwhy it works that way because math makes sense). History is a social subject,\nhowever, so ones understanding of emotion and human interaction is going to\ninfluence your ability to do well in that field.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 12\nSo which subject uses more unconscious processes? History or math? I would say that\nhistory does since it is emotional, and math doesn't necessarily engage any emotions.\nI mean, you are just doing numbers, it could cause someone to become emotional if it\nbrings up something indirectly, but that would not relate directly to the math problem\nlike how historical fact relates to social interaction.\n2.3.5 Emotional Material is Unconscious and Factual Thinking\nis Conscious\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nSo therefore emotional material is unconscious and factual thinking is conscious. This\nis so because when you think about something you are thinking consciously, and that\nis a single point of information that you think as a 'thought'. If it is emotional or\nimportant it is unconscious because you can't think about your emotions, when\nemotions occur, they are physical processes that cause feeling. Thoughts can cause\nfeeling, but only because they trigger emotions. So math is very logical, you can have a\nlot of thoughts about it but none of those thoughts necessarily have to trigger\nemotions because they aren't directly related. Historical fact is social, so it is probably\ngoing to be more emotional because it is more directly related to social interaction.\nSo a process like memory retrieval can be unconscious. When you are helped by your\nmind to remember a song, that is unconscious memory retrieval. When you try to\nremember something, that is more conscious. What is the line between unconscious\nand conscious then? Historical fact relates to a lot of things in your unconscious mind.\nIf it relates to a lot of unconscious things, like emotional things or other things in your\nlife you don't think about immediately, then it is more of an unconscious process. If it\nrelates to things you easily remember then it is more of a conscious process.\n2.4 Representation in the Mind\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nSince different objects represent different things to different people, and there are\ndifferent types of emotional speculation (like deliberative decisions vs. instinctual\nones), and various degrees of cognitive load (how intellectual or how emotional\nsomething is) then it isn't clear to me how these would function in the mind - which\nimages, objects or experiences in life would do what to someone emotionally and\nintellectually?\n2.5 Points made in this essay\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Mental images are possibly more simple in the mind than the full experience of\nthem in reality.

This\nrelates to having to do work to attain consciousness of something. If something is\nobvious or more significant, it is probably going to be more accessible to\nconsciousness (how 'clear' something is).\n\u2022 Someones memory and decision making ability is going to be influenced by their\nemotional reactions and their personality type.\n\u2022 A persons perception of the visual world is going to influence those mental\nprocesses (decision making and memory) because vision is a large factor in how\nemotion is generated, though not necessarily that significant.\n\u2022 People are sensitive to different types of emotional information and absorb some\nthings better consciously vs. unconsciously. Some things are also more or less\nemotionally complex, in addition to being unconscious or conscious.\n\u2022 Unconsciously people can get a feel for things - that is what the unconscious is -\nmore automatic - you could have a more conscious feeling for something but it is\neasier to respond instinctively. This relates to understanding information\nconsciously or unconsciously, if feelings are involved it could be considered to be\nan unconscious understanding, like how dogs understand if someone is being\nnice. If it is conscious then you aren't necessarily correct, you are using intellect to\nguess at something. You could be using your unconscious feelings as well,\nhowever.\n\u2022 Information that is emotional (such as historical fact) isn't necessarily conscious\nthinking. One can think objectively about emotional information, and therefore it\nwould be non-emotional to them. However, it makes sense that someone would\nuse emotional information to help remember historical fact, since history is\nrelated to life and social interaction information (which are both emotional\nphenomena).\n2.6 A Related Article\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nChris Fields (2010) wrote an article explaining about 'hyper-systemizers' - \"Hyper-\nsystemizers are individuals displaying an unusually strong bias toward systemizing, i.e.\ntoward explaining events and solving problems by appeal to mechanisms that do not\ninvolve intentions or agency.\". And how they are different from their opposites\n'mentalizers'. That relates to this article because I described how some information is\nmore emotional than other information. It seems that some people process more\nemotional information, and other people process information more subjectively or are\njust less sensitive to emotional cues:\n\u2022 Scientists, technologists, engineers and mathematicians rely heavily on a\nproblem-solving and explanatory strategy or orientation, termed \u201csystemizing\u201d by\nBaron-Cohen (2002, 2008), that is characterized by appeals to natural laws,\nphysical mechanisms, algorithms, formal inference rules, or other concepts of\ncausation that do not involve autonomous agency or intentions. Systemizing or\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 14\n\u201cmechanizing\u201d (Crespi and Badcock, 2008) solutions and explanations are\nexplicitly distinguished from \u201cempathizing\u201d or \u201cmentalizing\u201d solutions and\nexplanations, which do appeal to intentional, 2 autonomous agency and to\nactions guided by beliefs, desires, goals, fears, worries and other \u201cfolk\npsychological\u201d attributes associated with agency by a theory of mind (ToM)\nsystem (Frith and Frith, 1999; 2003).\nFields describes the proposition of his paper:\n\u2022 Based on a review and synthesis of relevant literatures, the present paper\nproposes that pre- existing personality and cognitive demands interact to\nprogressively sensitize the attentional and motivational systems of some\nindividuals toward systemizing and away from mentalizing, resulting in hyper-\nsystemizers who are not deficit in mentalizing capability, but rather relatively\ninsensitive to cues that ordinarily induce mentalizing.\nSo some people are more driven by emotional processes - and their thoughts are\ninfluenced by emotion - but with other people this is less the case. I mean if your\nactions are being guided by beliefs, fears, goals, worries, etc. then it would seem to me\nthat the person would be more emotional. That isn't necessarily the case, however.\nSomeone could have their thoughts be driven by those things, but not be an\nemotional person. Would that person be thinking with more unconscious emotional\nprocesses, but not actually be more emotional? Emotion can be present in thought\nand used to assist thought, but might not actually make the person more emotional\nthan someone whose thinking is more objective. Maybe they are emotional for a\ndifferent reason.\n2.7 Theory of mind\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nTheoryofmind(often abbreviated \"ToM\") is the ability to attribute mental\nstates\u2014beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.\u2014to oneself and others\nand to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different\nfrom one's own. (Premack, D. G.; Woodruff, G. (1978)).\nIn my view, ToM relates significantly to how emotional people and their thoughts are.\nIf someone's actions are being guided by beliefs and desires (a 'mentalizer'), then it\nmakes sense that their understanding and assessments of other people and\nthemselves are going to be influenced by beliefs and desires. If someone has greater\ndesires when making assessments (so the emotion would be related to their thoughts)\nwould they be a more emotional person? Someone might be capable of thinking non-\nemotionally, even if they have greater desires and beliefs, though I would think that in\ngeneral someone with more emotional thoughts would be a more emotional person.\nIt probably depends what they are more emotional about, etc.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 15\n2.8 Consciousness?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nA theory of consciousness is outlined by (De Luca, A Tony and Stephens, Newman L\n(2010)) - this is what they postulate - \"To understand consciousness we have to\nunderstand the mechanism of its function, which is to effectively organize sensory\ninputs from our environment. Consciousness is the outcome of the process of\norganizing these sensory inputs. This implies that organization is an act which\nprecedes consciousness:\n\u2022 My hypothesis is that consciousness is the emergent outcome of several linked\nprocesses (outcomes for sensory systems) which are organized to form specific\nneuronal architectures. The most elemental of these processes is the\nelectrochemical input to the brain cells which originated as external stimuli on\nspecific receptors that in turn generate electrophysiological phenomena such as\naction potentials to occur in specific areas of the nerves system. These ascend to\nmultiply loci in different parts of the brain. According to some investigators, i.e.\nCrick and Koch, it is the synchronization of these actions that results in\nconsciousness. Crick termed this the \u201cAstonish Hypothesis\u201d In this book and\nsubsequent articles awareness and perception were used interchangeably with\nconsciousness. However, my hypothesis states that perception is different\nphysiological construct from that of awareness and are elements of the\nsubconscience and consciousness is the process of organizing awareness; its\nmanifestation is the emergence outcome from this process.\nIn my view, it makes sense that perception is different from awareness. Perception is\nfast because vision is fast. Vision seems to me to obviously be linked to different\ncognitions than awareness. To figure out how awareness and perception are different,\nhowever, we first need to figure out what 'awareness' is (though I would think that an\nadvanced cognitive process is slower than a fast visual process, as it takes a long time\nto think complex thoughts). When someone is aware of their environment, is that\nawareness emotional? A deer or other animal doesn't necessarily need to engage\nemotionally with other species in order to be aware of its environment. Even frogs\nposses basic emotional processes (I noticed a from responding emotionally - when\nyou go near it you could possibly try to be nice and not scare it away). What is\nawareness then? Is it just awareness of ones environment, or awareness of the social\ncues needed to interact with other species? This is in the abstract of the paper by\nDeluca and Stephens:\n\u2022 Consciousness is \u201csomething\u201d which the majority of humans know that they\nposses, they use it when they want to understand their environment. However,\nno individual human knows whether other humans also posses consciousness.\nunless some tests such as she is looking at me, he is talking etc., are performed.\nWe are caught in an intellectual sort of recursive carousel \u2013 we need\nconsciousness to understand consciousness.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 16\nSo awareness is complex - you have to be aware of other people, what they are doing,\nwhat is going on in your environment. Vision, however, is simple. First people need to\nsee their environment in order to reach conclusions about it (or whatever the\nequivalent that is that a blind person would do). If someone stops thinking, they could\nstill be able to see. I am just saying it seems to me that vision is a more simple process\nthan advanced awareness. First you see your environment, then you think about it. I\nwould guess that when you aren't thinking, you are still looking around and\nresponding to more simple cognitions that enable you to behave normally. Advanced\nemotional and intellectual thinking is probably slower than simple thinking and vision.\nSo no wonder Crick and Koch used the words sensation and perception\ninterchangeably, when someone fist is able to see their environment, when they wake\nup or whatever, it is as if that is when they are first aware. (Vision being the 'baseline'\ncognition). This relates to emotional and intellectual complexity, some things are\nsimply more advanced than others to think about. When a baby is born can it think? It\ncan see, and it understands how to interact, but then again, a frog also knows how to\ninteract and I notice they can respond emotionally.\n2.9 Consciousness in the brain\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWallace, Dr. Rodrick (2011) sums up an argument by Atlan and Cohen (1998) about\nhow information systems work in the mind:\n\u2022 Atlan and Cohen (1998) argue, in the context of a cognitive paradigm for the\nimmune system, that the essence of cognitive function involves comparison of a\nperceived signal with an internal, learned or inherited picture of the world, and\nthen, upon that comparison, choice of one response from a much larger reper-\ntoire of possible responses. That is, cognitive pattern recognition-and- response\nproceeds by an algorithmic combination of an incoming external sensory sig- nal\nwith an internal ongoing activity { incorporating the internalized picture of the\nworld { and triggering an appropriate action based on a decision that the pattern\nof sensory activity requires a response.\nWhen someone sees something does it 'require a response'? Seeing another human\nbeing might require a response, but what about biological or neural responses? What\nobjects trigger which responses? Are there sets of 'brain wirings' that sort out different\nactivities? Here Wallace cites a model - (Baars, 2005):\n\u2022 ...it is clear that different challenges facing a conscious entity must be met be\ndiferent arrangements of basic cognitive faculties. It is now possible to make a\nvery abstract picture of the brain, not based on its anatomy, but rather on the\nlinkages between the information sources dual to the basic physiological and\nlearned unconscious cognitive modules (UCM) that form Baars' global workspace/\nglobal broadcast. That is, the remapped brain network is reexpressed in terms of\nthe information sources dual to the UCM. Given two distinct problems classes\n(e.g., playing tennis vs. interacting with a significant other), there must be two\ndifferent `wirings' of the information sources dual to the physiological UCM,\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 17\nIt is fairly obvious that there are different ways of responding to the world - social,\nemotional, intellectual, etc. - but the important question is: what are the similar ways\nin which different aspects of the world cause similar or different feelings? That way\nyou could say - this is that are grouped in the mind because they have the same\nfeeling (physical) response. Or is there \"no room in any model for feeling\" (Harnad,\nStevan (2011))? I could use a emotional / intellectual division of world responses. While\nintellectually thoughts may cause feeling, it makes more sense that the mind is divided\ninto emotional groupings not intellectual ones. That is because thoughts trigger\nfeelings - a feeling can cause someone to have a thought, but that is only because you\nrealized you had that feeling or it motivated you in certain way (while thoughts cause\nfeelings directly). So it isn't someone's knowledge that causes feelings, I think the mind\nworks by a more simple division of the world and biological responses - simple\nemotional groupings. That makes sense since humans evolved from lesser animals\nwhere that is more obvious. When an ape interacts with his friends, the emotion he\nfeels is a simple one that derived from simple aspects of the world and the interaction\nhe in engaged in. So while simple feelings might be the logical result of their\ncorresponding thoughts, deeper emotional aspects of the mind are probably simple\nresponses to the persons environment i.e., you went to a movie so you feel happy, etc.\nSo my theory is basically only a few emotions are the end result of all our activities,\nand from these basic emotions more complex intellectual responses can be formed.\nHarnad, Stevan (2011) seems to feel that humans have little room for feeling in their\nintellectual responses:\n\u2022 And perhaps it is indeed not worth fretting about the fact that, at the end of the\nday, the successful total explanation of our know\u2010how will always be equally\ncompatible with the presence or the absence of feeling. For unless we are\nprepared to be telekinetic dualists, according a separate, unique causal power to\nfeeling itself (\u201cmind over matter\u201d ) \u2010\u2010 for which there is no evidence, only\noverwhelming evidence against it \u2013 there is no causal room in any model for\nfeeling. Yet, although it may be an illusion that some of the things I do, I do\nbecause I feel like it, it is certainly not an illusion that it feels like some of the\nthings I do, I do because I feel like it. And that feeling is as real as the feeling that I\nhave a toothache even when I don\u2019t have a tooth.\n2.10 My Theory\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nPaul Ekman did a study that found that when participants contorted their facial\nmuscles into distinct facial expressions (e.g. disgust), they reported subjective and\nphysiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research\nfindings led him to classify six emotions as basic: anger, disgust, fear, happiness,\nsadness and surprise.1\nSo there is a physiological correlate for each of the 6 basic emotions - my theory is\nthat from different stimuli, different intellectual cognitions (such as thoughts, dreams\netc.), and one or more of those 6 basic emotions (or possibly other feelings)\n1.Handel, Steven. \"Classification of Emotions\".

It doesn't necessarily have to be right away, it could take hours\nfor neural centers to respond (in that way more complex emotional responses can be\nformed since they are possibly a build up of a few hours of mental experience).\nThis way, from a simple emotionally triggered response (not just emotional, but also\nintellectual stimuli and external stimuli) in the brain complex feelings arise. The\nanswer must be that different chemicals are stored up over time. In that way only a\nfew basic emotions could give rise to a rich conscious emotional and intellectual\nexperience. Emotions trigger thoughts, thoughts are triggered from external stimuli (in\nany order thoughts, emotions and external stimuli can trigger each other) (which was\ntriggered by such and such stimulus) could trigger this and that feeling over the next\nfew hours.\nHumans must develop a way of organizing the three inputs of emotion, external\nstimuli, and thought (the intellectual input) over time, and the way their mind\norganizes the data forms their 'consciousness'. - For instance, if you respond to seeing\nthis object this way emotionally and intellectually - then that was how your mind\norganized your emotional/intellectual response. It is subjective to decide whether or\nnot you were 'aware' of your response - humans respond to things all the time and\nthey aren't necessarily aware of those responses.\nSo someone emotions could be sending signals to the part of the brain or body that\nregisters those feelings. Your mind (thoughts, etc. - the intellectual part of your brain)\ncould also be sending similar or different signals about emotion (i.e. 'I want to be\nhappy' or 'I don't want to be angry'). As a third input, the person could be getting\nsignals from their external environment telling their emotions to be happy, sad, etc.\n2.10.1 How can Intellect in the brain be categorized?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nIt is more clear how emotion works in the brain than intellect - the different 'main'\nemotions are obvious mentally and physically.

There must be certain types of attributes it associates with itself,\nand some of these are going to be more intellectually 'stimulating' to your mind than\nother attributes. This might also be true of other animals with less intellectual\nfunctioning than a human, however it is probably very different.\nJust like how different types of sensory information can be stimulating to someone,\ndifferent types of intellectual information are probably also stimulating to various\ndegrees. School can be academically (or intellectually) rigorous, but what pieces of\ninformation from academic material are more rigorous?\nThe same information probably is just as rigorous outside of a school environment.\nCan I separate out information that is accompanied or 'forced' into someone by other\nemotional stress like if someone was under pressure at school to do well, or under\npressure to figure out a solution otherwise?\nDifferent types of information must be associated with different emotional\narchitectures - i.e., when I think about this I feel this way. Some types of information\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 19\nare going to be more or less emotional or related to your personal identity. That is\ndifferent from if the information uses more unconscious emotional processes.\nInformation could use emotion to help to think about it (like my historical fact\nexample), or the information could be emotional to the person or not as well.\n2.11 Subjectivity and Emotion\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n(Vaknin, Sam) Proposes that emotions are either sensory or internal:\n\u2022 Actions are sense data and motivations are internal data, which together form a\nnew chunk of emotional data.\n\u2022 If more sense data (than internal data) are involved and the component of\ninternal data is weak in comparison (it is never absent) \u2013 we are likely to\nexperience Transitive Emotions. The latter are emotions, which involve\nobservation and revolve around objects. In short: these are \"out-going\" emotions,\nthat motivate us to act to change our environment.\n\u2022 Yet, if the emotional cycle is set in motion by Emotional Data, which are\ncomposed mainly of internal, spontaneously generated data \u2013 we will end up with\nReflexive Emotions. These are emotions that involve reflection and revolve\naround the self (for instance, autoerotic emotions). It is here that the source of\npsychopathologies should be sought: in this imbalance between external,\nobjective, sense data and the echoes of our mind.\nSo obviously emotions are going to be generated by either one or both inputs -\ninternal and external. If you feel like (or are) responding to your internal motivations\nand feelings, then you are responding more internally. If someones environment is\nputting pressure on them (people in the environment, or other sensory inputs), then\nthey would by definition be responding more externally.\nWhat makes an emotion subjective? People feel emotions all the time, its just how\nthey are - \"Thats just how I feel\" someone might try to communicate. It is too hard to\nassess where the emotion came from, if it was a logical one that made sense or an\nemotion that was subjective. What would an example of a 'subjective' emotion be vs. a\n'logical' emotion?\nAn emotion that is strongly influenced by a motivation or desire is probably subjective.\nAn emotion that is sensory, like a physical emotion, is more objective because you\naren't influencing the emotion with your mind. People respond differently to different\nsituations because they are different people and have different background beliefs,\nideas, feelings, experience, etc.\nI suppose you could say that some people respond to social situations more 'logically'\nthan other people. If they aren't as influenced by their internal beliefs - earlier in this\npaper I cited the definition of 'mentalizers' - people who have their actions guided by\nbeliefs, desires, goals, fears, etc. vs. 'systemizers', who rely on a problem solving\nstrategy instead of intentions - then does that mean they are responding more\nlogically? Someones emotions could be influenced by logical data just as much as\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 2 20\nsomeones emotions could be influenced by internal intentions (though I would guess\nin general the mentalizers are more emotional).\nDo emotions arise from a persons problem solving strategy? One that is logical\n(systemizers) or one that is based on internal motivations (mentzlizers)? If that were\nthe case, then systemizers would be distinctinly different emotionally than\nmentalizers. Or do emotions arise from perceiving external actions differently?\nPerceiving actions would be learned from experience, while someones problem\nsolving strategy is based upon what they are thinking about. - So emotions could arise\nfrom perceptions of bodily changes (which is Damasio's theory) which I suppose could\nbe observing other people in your environment, or they arise from a more internal,\nmental process which is based upon what you are thinking about, how you are\nthinking, etc. (systemizers vs mentalizers for example).\n2.12 Observation vs. Inference\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhen someone observes their environment they think about it in some way. This type\nof thinking is different from thinking that isn't based off of immediate vision. How do\nthe two types of thinking differ? What is different when you think from when you are\nobserving your environment, versus when you think about things that aren't\ndependent on what you are looking at (a more 'inferential' type of thinking)? Fodor\n(Fodor, Jerry (1990)) states - \"For one thing, observationally fixed beliefs tend, by and\nlarge, to be more reliable than inferrentially fixed beliefs.\"\nBased upon the same visual observations, will two organisms reach the same\nconclusions? Why don't I try to compare a deer and a human. There is a similar way in\nwhich both species process basic information about the environment (along with the\nanimals in it), for instance if someone is attacking them both species recognize that as\na threat. And i'm sure both species process data about environments without other\nanimals or humans in it in a similar fashion as well. They both need to function in the\nenvironment, to look at the flora and fauna and decide what they want to eat, etc. It\nmust be more complicated or 'theoretical' ideas that humans hold which separate our\nthinking from that of other animals (like deer). Here Fodor states that two organisms\nwill reach the same observational beliefs 'however much their theoretical\ncommitments may differ':\n\u2022 The claim, then, is that there is a class of beliefs that are typically fixed by\nsensory/perceptual processes, and that the fixation of beliefs in this class is, in a\nsense that wants spelling out, importantly theory neutral. A a first shot at what\nthe theory neutrality of observation comes to: given the same stimulations, two\norganisms with the same sensory/perceptual psychology will quite generally\nobserve the same things, and hence arrive at the same observational beliefs,\nhowevermuchtheirtheoretical commitmentsmaydiffer.\nIs there a difference between perception and cognition? How someone perceives the\nworld is based off of - and influenced by - how they think of the world. Perception is\nthe organization, identification and interpretation of sensory information in order to\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 21\nrepresent and understand the environment2. Cognition is how our minds use sensory\ndata, in addition for being a name for all of a humans intellectual faculties - language,\nlearning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. So what is the exact\nrelationship between perception and cognition? Here again is Fodor:\n\u2022 Precisely parallel to the philosophical doctrine that there can be no principled\ndistinction betweenobservationandinferenceis the psychological doctrine that\nthere can be no principled distinction betweenperceptionandcognition. The\nleading idea here is that \"perception involves a kind of problem solving--a kind of\nintelligence (Gregory 1970). Perception, according to this account, is the process\nwherein an organism assigns probable distal causes to the proximal stimulations\nit encounters. What makes the solution of perceptual problems other than mere\nroutine is the fact that, as a matter of principle, any given pattern of proximal\nstimulation is compatible with a great variety of distal causes; there are, if you\nlike, many possible worlds that would project a given pattern of excitation on the\nsensory mechanisms of an organism. To view the mental processes which\nmediate perception as inferences is thus necessarily to view them as\nnondemonstrativeinferences. \"We are forced ... to suppose that perception\ninvolves betting on the most probable interpretation of sensory data, in terms of\nworld objects\" (Gregory 1970). It is worth stressing the putative moral: what\nmediates perception is an inference from effects to causes. The sort of mentation\nrequired for perception is thus not different in kind - though no doubt it differs a\nlot in conscious accessibility - from what goes on in Sherlock Holmes' head when\nhe infers the identity of the criminal from a stray cigar band and a hair or two. If\nwhat Holmes does deserves to be called cognition, perception deserved to be\ncalled cognition too, or so, at least, some psychologists like to say.\nSo observation is similar to perception, and inference is similar to cognition. When\nsomeone interprets or infers information, they are thinking - and when someone\nobserves the world around them they could likewise be viewed as just seeing (or\n'perceiving').\nWhich visual objects generate which cognitions? Or, which visual environments\ngenerate which types of cognitions? My guess would be there are visual environments\nthat put a high cognitive demand on someone, or alerts them to a higher degree than\nless threatening or stimulating environments. It is interesting that vision plays such a\nlarge role in what a human or other animal might be thinking. For instance, a forest\nenvironment might make a human feel like it was under threat, or at least more so\nthan a grassy environment where the human could see far around itself.\nFrom the Fodor quote I concluded that it seems like the observations and conclusions\nreached from perception or vision are simple ones. Investigation into what is going on\nvisually is just linking the vision of a scene (like a crime scene in the Holmes example)\nand with the knowledge you need to make the proper links. An understanding of of\ndeep human emotional factors isn't necessary. However, a complex understanding of\nhuman motivation might be needed to understand complex ideas. Complex ideas\nmight be linked to vision, however most things that people just see visually they don't\nneed a complex emotional background to understand. There are many 'worlds' that\n2.Daniel (2011).

Those are also simple, however. In the\nvisual field there are simple things like effects and causes (this causes that, etc). To\nunderstand the environment, much of the information of what is happening doesn't\nhave to pass through consciousness since it is usually fairly simple. A deeper\nreflection, esp. a deeper emotional reflection is capable with complex thought,\nprobably at a separate time from when one reaches the immediate conclusions they\ndo about the environment.\n2.13 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Atlan, H., I.

Someones feelings may be guiding them person or leading\nthem to think a certain thing - and that person could be completely unaware that their\nmind is doing that.\nJohn Heil maintains that conscious thinking need not be linguistic but is imagistic or\n'pictorial'.\nTake the two ideas that people are subject to emotion and that conscious thinking is\npictorial and I arrive at the conclusion that that is why people like going to movie\ntheaters. The images there are large and that helps make it a different experience -\nthe movie overrides their thinking with images and sounds. That is the difference\nbetween going to the theater and just watching the movie on your home television\nanyway.\n'Understanding'\nJohn Campbell maintains that the ability to know the reference of our singular and\ngeneral terms is based, ultimately, on our ability to focus our conscious attention on\nobjects and properties.\nI think that that isn't saying much, however (or that it is rather obvious). I mean that is\nsort of by definition how people gain experience or understanding - by having a better\nor more developed understanding of the objects involved with whatever the\nknowledge is of.\nI don't know if this means that understanding is visual or verbal - it is probably a\ncombination of both and varies depending on what the understanding is of.\nUnderstanding is also emotional - conscious and unconscious emotions, visions and\nwords all assist the understanding of ideas and objects.\n'Deciding'\nPeople make decisions based on two factors - what they want and what they are most\nlikely to actually get (or is actually going to happen).\nSo if someone wants something a lot, and it is very likely that they can get it; then it is\na very easy decision.\nDifferent emotional properties might interfere with a logical decision making process.\nIf someone is very aroused they might not be able to reach logical decisions - it might\nhelp with the speed of the decision - but not necessarily its accuracy.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 25\n'Truth'\nWhat is the 'truth'? It might be the truth to find out what someone wants the most -\nthat is one thing that someone could be true or accurate about. Or finding out\nsomeones motivation behind a behavior - 'person a did this because they were\nmotivated by factor x and y' - could be something else someone might try to be\naccurate about.\nSo human motivation is a subjective topic that is very important in understanding\nordinary, daily events. It therefore is probably important behind a lot of the thinking\npeople do. If you think about when you think about anything, or even the stream of\nsomeones thoughts is going to be influenced by current motivations and drives.\nWhat else might make thinking emotional? Motivation obviously generates emotion,\nbut motivations are cognitively triggered more so than emotions that simply lie in your\nbody - such as moods and background feelings (background feelings were described\nby Damasio as the feelings people have when they wouldn't be feeling anything else).\nThose feelings are going to be less tied to motivation because they aren't as\nconnected to goals.\nFeeling and motivations are also going to be tied to emotional biases (heuristics) and\nthinking biases (schema). Basically humans can be biased from more emotional drives\nor drives that are more related to goals and certain thoughts they may have.\n3.1 Is Thinking Automatic?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nHow much of thought or feeling is consciously derived vs. derived from a persons\nenvironment? Humans don't 'create' the world around them - the world around them\ngives inputs for their minds (not the opposite).\nDepending on the input (or the situation) a human mind could interpret the inputs in\ndifferent ways. They could cause the person to feel emotions that they didn't expect to\nfeel or that they didn't ask for. Their mind also biases the information that it thinks. It\nseems like the mind could structure new ways of thinking about things and how the\nfeelings are generated when thinking about those things by practicing new ways of\nthinking.\nOld habits die hard; however. When thinking about things feelings are automatically\ntriggered - and these feelings have real sources in the world (which is perhaps why it is\nhard to change how they make you feel).\nIt probably depends if the thinking is context independent or context dependent - for\ninstance if you are thinking in a different environment or have different emotions\nwhen you do the thinking. The context I am talking about here must be more\ncomplicated than 'background' feelings because the content is highly informational.\nThere are a only a few background feelings someone could experience however there\nare many more ways of feeling in your mind if you combine the feelings with thoughts\nor specific situations.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 3 26\n3.1.1 Unchangeable Feelings\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nA person could practice going into a situation repeatedly - then the experience for\nthem would gradually become more understood and the feelings generated more\nautomatic. But how could their mind influence what feelings are felt? Maybe if they\nfocused on different aspects of the situation or thought about different aspects\ndifferently they could change the feelings involved.\nSo feelings aren't entirely based on the environment or external stimuli - what the\nperson thinks or who they are probably influences the feelings to a great degree.\nHow does that work exactly; however? It probably depends on what the situation is\nand what the inputs and thoughts are. Also, what aspects are unchangeable from\nsituation to situation - or how does the mind construct feeling and thought from an\nenvironment?\n3.1.2 Engaging Stimuli\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThe human mind responds to stimuli - it is for that reason that zombies aren't\npossible because zombies don't respond highly to stimuli - however that is how the\nhuman mind functions, by responding, recognizing and adapting to stimuli.\nStimuli from thoughts, emotions and the environment all help keep the mind active\nand alive. That doesn't necessarily mean that a person needs strong motivations all of\nthe time, however. In order for the brain to function a complex set of inter-actions\nneeds to be occurring. Emotions, thoughts and stimuli must be continuously triggering\ncomplex feelings that form a sort of 'feeling base' for the unconscious.\nThat is different from Damasio's 'background feelings' which could be viewed as just\nbeing simple feelings. The feeling the unconscious mind generates is complex and\nconstantly dependent on stimuli and also (necessarily) constantly feeds the mind with\nits own stimuli.\n3.2 Implicit Knowledge\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nSome knowledge that people have is unreportable - that is, they know or have the\nknowledge but are unable to report it verbally.\nSometimes there is a mismatch between conscious understanding and unconscious\nunderstanding.

How much they\nunderstand is going to vary depending on the object and how much they think about\nit. Their unconscious and conscious understanding of course is going to influence\ndecisions made related to the object. Unconscious and conscious understanding also\nwould help form how the feelings are related to the object and how decisions are\nformed related to the object.\nHow do thoughts and emotions work to trigger a mental experience? They must\ncombine in some sort of 'cognitive architecture' or brain wiring. The total workings of\nthe different processes the human brain brain uses is termed in cognitive science a\n'cognitive architecture' (Thagard, Paul):\n\u2022 A cognitive architecture is a general proposal about the representations and\nprocesses that produce intelligent thought.\n\u2022 A cognitive architecture is a proposal about the kinds of mental representations\nand computational procedure that constitute a mechanism for explaining a broad\nrange of kinds of thinking.\n\u2022 A complete unified general theory of cognition would provide mechanisms for\nexplaining the workins of perception, attention, memory, problem solving,\nreasoning, learning, decision making, motor control, language, emotion and\nconsciousness.\nThinking seems fairly simple; however. Everyone thinks, and humans didn't need to\nstudy what thought was in order to understand how to think - so it couldn't be that\ncomplicated. Thoughts influence our view of the world, however (and therefore help\nshape our reasoning and decision making). - Here is (Prinz, Jesse):\n\u2022 Thoughts are mental episodes that require the use of concepts. Thoughts may be\nunbidden or automatic, but they are not merely copies of the stimuli that impinge\non our senses. They go beyond mere sensations and present the world as being a\ncertain way. Thoughts can occur through processes of deliberation and can be\naffected, in many cases at least, by reasoning.\nThoughts can cause emotions. Typical thoughts that might cause emotions are\nappraisals and evaluations. If someone has a strong attitude about a thought it will\nprobably generate more emotion than a thought that is more neutral. Thoughts are\ncognitive; however. Non-cognitive causes of emotion are primarily perceptual states\nlike a smell causing disgust or a sudden change in vision (since perceptual is by\ndefinition what we 'perceive'). The non-cognitive correlates of emotion is theorized to\nbe physiological arousal (like taking drugs or listening to music for example (other\nexamples are weather and exercise)) (however some theories attach a cognitive\ncomponent to the physiological aspect (Spinoza for example says every emotion\ncomprises both a judgment and either pleasure or pain)).\nSo a lot of things cause and affect emotions in the brain. It is important to understand\nthese causes (especially thoughts - since those are most under your control) if\nsomeone is to understand how your emotions influence your decisions and how your\ndecisions influence your emotions. - (Prinz, Jesse):\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 3 28\n\u2022 In sum, we have seen that there are several possible candidates for the\nconstituents of emotions: cognitive states, such as appraisals, levels of arousal,\nemotional valence, perceptions of bodily change, action tendencies, or some\ncombination of these.\n3.3 Consciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nConsciousness is hard to define - it arises from perception of the stimuli generated\nfrom an environment, the stimuli generated from our senses and the stimuli\ngenerated from our thoughts and feelings.\nBut what is the 'perception' of our own internal states and feelings? That would be a\nhigher-order theory of consciousness. Higher order theories state that one is only\nconscious of a state when one reflects on that state. So if someone was constantly\nmore reflective, then they could be considered to be more conscious in general.\nConsciousness is obviously highly related to how people make decisions then. - If\nsomeone is conscious of a certain thing, or how they are conscious of that thing is\ngoing to determine how it feels for them and how they are going to make decisions\nfrom that conscious awareness.\n3.3.1 Perceptual vs. Action Consciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nPerceptual consciousness suggests that consciousness arises from our perceptions -\nthis would include things like imagination and vision. Action consciousness suggests\nthat consciousness arises from awareness of bodily actions - and thoughts can fall\nunder that species of consciousness - or are our thoughts perceptions?\nTwo chapters on that debate are in the book \"Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of\nMind\" Mclaughlin, B and Cohen, J (Eds). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. One chapter is by\nJesse Prinz - \"All consciousness is perceptual\" and the other chapter is by Christopher\nPeacocke \"Mental Action and Self Awareness\".\nPeacocke writes about action-awareness with schizophrenics:\n\u2022 What the schizophrenic subject lacks in the area of conscious thought is action-\nawareness of the thoughts that occur to him. To enjoy action-awareness of a\nparticular event of thinking is to be aware non-perceptually of that thinking as\nsomething one is doing oneself.\nPeacocke postulates an idea about intentions:\n\u2022 Is a thinker's knowledge of what he is doing really explained by his knowledge of\nhis intentions in acting?\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 29\nPrinz mentions that \"there are conscious feelings associated with action\". He talks\nabout if Peacocke's view that action-awareness is different from perceptual\nawareness, and he talks about what Peacocke means by 'action'.\nI would say that the debate is just a matter of defining the terms. The debate cannot\nreally be solved empirically either. It is subjective to decide if something is a\nperception or is an action. I would say that there is a type of physical awareness of\nones body and a type of mental awareness - awareness of ones own thoughts and\nemotions.\nSo that is it - there is the physical world and there is a mental world, and awareness or\nconsciousness of both I would say is almost equally divided. That makes sense if you\nconsider that if the physical overwhelmed the mental, physical feelings would\ndominate and vice versa.\nPeople with left brain damage might have their emotions dominate (since the right\nbrain is theorized to be more emotional). And similarly, emotional and intellectual;\nphysical and mental are constantly in or out of balance.\n3.4 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Prinz, Jesse.

There are other terms that define\nconsciousness as being merely first order or not representational or higher order and\nonly being representational. By 'representational' I mean that an object or experience\nis only conscious when someone has a higher order perception, thought or\nrepresentation about it in ones mind.\nMaybe consciousness isn't really like anything anyway. If you think about it - if it can\nbe argued that lesser animals like dogs and cats can be conscious - then what makes a\nhuman a human isn't really that big of a deal.\nLesser animals think and feel.

Certain things might be done\nto make the emotions involved more or less salient however, and that could be\ncomplex to achieve.\nThere is a difference between the real world and how ones mind represents the world\nto itself. This concept is called intentionality (not to be confused with the word\n'intention') which is like the word intention, only so far as it implies that a mind has an\nintent to capture the essence of something in the world. It is defined by the Stanford\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 31\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy as \"the power of minds to be about, to represent, or to\nstand for, things, properties and states of affairs\"1.\nThe question that then follows after hearing the definition of intentionality is - what if\nsomeone misrepresents the world? That doesn't really make much sense; however.\nThe way your mind 'biases' or 'represents' the world is by definition how you are\nperceiving it. Over time you can perceive the world differently, and then it could cause\ndifferent emotions in you. Because the color red doesn't necessarily have a strict bio-\nneurological reaction, it is dependent on your emotional and intellectual perception of\nthe world.\nWhat are the factors of perception, then, of perception and representation in\nconscious experience - and can someone 'misrepresent' the world? Here is Robert\nBrandom:\n\u2022 For what an organism is doing to be intelligible is representing, there must be\nroom also for misrepresenting, for representation that is incorrect. One of the\nhallmarks of the normativity of intentionality is that what one commits oneself to\nin applying a concept outruns in principle what one takes oneself to be\ncommitted to. The norm of correctness one thereby binds oneself by goes\nbeyond both the dispositions of those understaking those commitments and\nwhat they consciously envisage themselves as committing themselves to thereby.\nBecause it does, a question arises about how to understand the features of the\nintentional state or meaningful utterance that settle which determinate\nconceptual norm one is bound by - exactly which standards for the assessment of\ncorrectness or success one has implicitly put in play - by being in that state or\nproducing that utterance. If what one is committed to is not settled by what one\nconsciously envisages (because one never so envisages enough), nor by what one\nis disposed to accept as such (because one can be wrong), how is it settled?\nHe brings up a couple of points in this passage. If someone is misrepresenting the\nworld, how would that change what the feelings are vs if they represented it\naccurately? What does that mean anyway - to misrepresent the world? It isn't like\npeople can expect how exactly something is going to or supposed to feel, or\nunderstand completely how something feels. It seems there is a conscious filter of\nsorts that is conscious in the sense that it is unique to humans because humans have\nsuch a developed sense of emotion and breadth of feeling, but is unconscious in the\nsense that it is how their mind naturally functions (how it interprets and feels\nemotions, thoughts, experiences etc).\n4.1.1 Phenomenal or 'Experience\" Consciousness vs Functional\nConsciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhat if someone only had phenomenological experiences without consciousness?\nNed Block distinguishes between what he calls 'access' consciousness and\n1.http://seop.illc.uva.nl/entries/intentionality/ Retrieved 12/16/2014.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 4 32\n'phenomenal' consciousness. He states that A- consciousness is representational and\nhas direct control of thought and action (A-consciousness is the functional aspect of\nmind while P-consciousness is the experiential aspect). If A=P then information\nprocessing theories are right and the mind can be made that way. If, however, a\nhumans realizations matter then there is a more subjective element and experience\ncannot be described or programmed. Something with only A-consciousness would be\na zombie or robot - since it would be functioning like a human but it would have no\nexperience or sensation of experiences.\nThat makes sense, if someone only had feelings and had no rationality (similar to an\nanimal) then it would only be phenomenally aware. If someone had direct control over\ntheir consciousness, and didn't experience things very much then it would be easy to\ncreate a machine that duplicated that behavior since machines don't feel. Searle, 1990\nmentions Blocks theory of access consciousness and criticizes it for confusing levels of\nattention and consciousness:\n\u2022 There are lots of different degrees of consciousness, but door-knobs, bits of\nchalk, and shingles are not conscious at all... These points, it seems to me, are\nmisunderstood by Block. He refers to what he calls an \"access sense of\nconsciousness.\" On my account there is no such sense. I believe that he ..\n[confuses] what I would call peripheral consciousness or inattentiveness with\ntotal unconsciousness. It is time, for example, that when I am driving my car \"on\nautomatic pilot\" I am not paying much attention to the details of the road and the\ntraffic. But it is simply not true that I am totally unconscious of these phenomena.\nIf I were, there would be a car crash. We need therefore to make a distinction\nbetween the center of my attention, the focus of my consciousness on the one\nhand, and the periphery on the other ... There are lots of phenomena right now of\nwhich I am peripherally conscious, for example the feel of the shirt on my neck,\nthe touch of the computer keys at my finger-tips, and so on. But as I use the\nnotion, none of these is unconscious in the sense in which the secretion of\nenzymes in my stomach in unconscious.\nIt makes sense that there are lots of degrees of consciousness - that is fairly obvious\nactually. What makes it more complicated is to find out what exactly is going on - i.e.\nhow emotionally focused are you on one thing, how much of the focus is intellectual,\nhow much of it is planned or intended vs automatic.\nI mean if you are unconsciously focused on something then is it more emotional since\nthe unconscious is more animal-like? How much does it matter if it easy to process or\nis high in information? Those concepts relate to system 1 and system 2 dual process\ntheories and how those theories relate to consciousness vs. unconsciousness (which I\ntalk about in another articlem51859(http://cnx.org/content/m51859/latest/)).\nThe unconscious mind gives largely the experience or feeling of life because when you\nthink you can only focus on a little compared to how much you can focus on\nunconsciously - of course you can't really 'focus' on something unconsciously because\nby definition it is unconscious - so you could be doing more automated activities\nrelated to it but not really focus on it clearly like when you consciously focus on\nsomething.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 33\nSo in my view theories of consciousness can be described by how conscious or\nunconscious various aspects of them are. This includes functions of the mind and how\nthe mind experiences life - both are either conscious or unconscious, or some\ncombination of both.\nThe mind is often described as an iceberg with only a small portion on the surface.\nThe surface part is what people are conscious of, and beneath the water lies the\nunconscious. The important question then is what does an unconscious experience\nfeel like? Dreams are entirely unconscious because you are sleeping - but what\naspects of experience and functioning are unconscious when a person is awake?\nAll automatic mental processes are unconscious - all non-automatic ones that need\nconscious thought are conscious, though they may have unconscious aspects of\nexperience. So a conscious thought can guide an unconscious experience. How do you\ndefine if a feeling is conscious or not, however? Feelings are a large part of experience,\nand the conscious mind can guide them, trigger them or inhibit them.\n4.1.2 Conscious vs. Unconscious \"Consciousness\"\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nSo there is a big difference between the unconscious and the conscious mind. This\ndifference is outlined with system 1 and system 2 dual process theories. It seems like\nthe unconscious mind is more emotional and animal-like, while the conscious mind is\nmore logical and human.\nThe function of the unconscious is regulate physical activity, and give your mind the\nfeelings related to this physical action. People aren't ever completely using their\nconscious mind since there are always automatic processes occurring. Those could be\nconsidered to be being done unconsciously.\nFeelings and thoughts are the primary things that are either conscious or unconscious\n- but all a minds processes are conscious or unconscious to different degrees.\nIn another article I talk about what processes are conscious or unconscious in any\nenvironmentm51883(http://cnx.org/content/m51883/latest/). People can be aware of\nthe world physically or mentally, and this difference also relates to the different\nmental processes (which each could be considered to be conscious or unconscious,\nphysical or mental).\n4.1.3 Physical vs. Mental Consciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhat is the difference between a type of 'physical' consciousness and a sort of\n'mental' consciousness? Is it strictly the difference between being physically aware of\nyour body - or experiencing thoughts or other cognitions that don't pull up a physical\nfeeling? Are some thoughts more 'physical' than other thoughts? Here is (Davidson,\nDonald):\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 4 34\n\u2022 On the proposed test of the mental, the distinguishing feature of the mental is\nnot that it is private, subjective, or immaterial, but that it exhibits what Brentano\ncalled intentionality. Thus intentional actions are clearly included in the realm of\nthe mental along with thoughts hopes and regret (or the events tied to these).\nWhat may seem doubtful is whether the criterion will include events that have\noften been considered paradigmatic of the mental. Is it obvious, for example, that\nfeeling a pain or seeing an afterimage will count as mental? Sentences that report\nsuch events seem free from taint of nonextensionality, and the same should be\ntrue of reports of raw feels, sense data, and other uninterpreted sensations, if\nthere are any.\nI guess there are some sensations people 'interpret' to themselves and thus think\nmore about the physical. However, all thinking could be considered to be physical\nsince sensations are the minds inputs and all thought is visual to some degree. Maybe\nit is a constant mental balance, where a sensation triggers or balances a thought that\nis free of the physical and makes it more physical or emotional.\nIt could be that physical sensations are much more emotional than thoughts that are\ntied to mental representations (vs thoughts that are tied to physical feelings).\nHowever, which thought would be tied to a physical feeling vs a thought tied to a\nmental idea or concept? Or is there some sort of mix? People can internalize things\nand that is perhaps thinking more mentally and not physically = how could someone\ninternalize a physical feeling? That doesn't seem to make sense - a person could\nexperience a physical feeling, but the deep aspects of mental reflection seem more\ncognitive and not necessarily tied to the physical (if it is even possible for a thought to\nbe entirely physical (even though it is a thought of a sensation, which is physical)).\n4.2 The Nature of Consciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhat are the roles of the different mental processes in the nature of consciousness?\nWhat is the role of vision in thinking? If vision is a large part of thought processes, how\ndoes that change the nature of how an experience feels?\nJudgements require concepts, however visual representations don't necessarily use\nconcepts - you could just represent something in the world to yourself without\nthinking about it - so they don'trequireconcepts but they probably use them in most\ncases. That is - most visual representations require thought, which means that they\nwould require concepts. I would think that when concepts are used would be when an\nattitude is triggered - then you might start thinking about how you feel towards certain\nconcepts. How does an image get conceptualized? Fodor asks that question here but\ndoesn't offer an explanation (Fodor, 2007):\n\u2022 Judgement requires conceptualization even if (as I suppose) representation\ndoesn't; and, of course, there's no conceptualization without concepts. The\nquestion how (for example, by what computational process) iconic\nrepresentations might get conceptualized is, of course, very hard and the answer\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 35\nis unknown for practically any of the interesting cases. On the way of looking at\nthings of which I've been trying to convince you, that is a large part of what the\npsychology of perception is about.\nPhenomenal states are perceptual - their vehicles belong to one of the 5 senses. So\nwhen you experience something, it is physical and sensory in nature. However, a\nmental image is inside your head and that is different from physically seeing\nsomething. In this quote (Prinz, 2007) says that \"perceptual formats may have a kind\nof content that is not representational\" that means that \"conscious states comprise\nmental representations, but notice that it does not entail representationalism\":\n\u2022 I will define a perceptually conscious mental state as a mental state that is\ncouched in a perceptual format. A perceptual format is a representational system\nthat is proprietary to a sense modality. To say that phenomenal states are\nconceptual is to say that their representational vehicles always belong to one of\nthe senses: touch, vision, audition, olfaction, and so on. This assumes that\nconscious states comprise mental representations, but notice that it does not\nentail representationalism, the thesis that every difference in phenomenal\nqualities is a difference in representational content. Perceptual formats may have\na kind of content that is not representational, such that two perceptual\nrepresentations can represent the same thing even though they are\nphenomenally distinct. With Peacocke (1983) I suspect that this is right. For\nexample, I think we can phenomenally represent the feature of being located to\nthe left of us, by vision, audition, touch, and probably smell. There is very good\nevidence that there are multiple modality-specific spatial maps in the brain (e.g.,\nGross and Graziano, 1995), and these may underwrite distinct phenomenal\nqualities even if they sometimes represent the same spatial features. So, in my\ndefinition on perceptual consciousness, I am committing only to the thesis that\nperceptually conscious states comprise mental entities that are in the business of\nrepresenting. This definition would need to be amended only if we discovered\nthat perceptual format includes components that are not representational in\nnature. It is sometimes suggested that there are words in languages that don't\nserve a referential function. Some expletives, particles, and logical operators may\nfall into this category. Perhaps perceptual symbol systems contain such things as\nwell, and perhaps these things can contribute to the phenomenal quality of an\nexperience. I am willing to accept that possibility. The key point about perceptual\nconsciousness is the claim that perceptually conscious states have a perceptual\nformat.\nWhat does he mean in the final line of the passage - \"perceptually conscious states\nhave a perceptual format\". That is being a little redundant - I mean, if the input from\nthe world is perceptual then it makes sense that it is going to be perceptual in your\nmind. How the mind interprets, biases, thinks about, changes etc sensory inputs is an\ninteresting question. Also does the mind convert sensory inputs into conceptual\nideas? How does the vision of something outside the mind change when you think\nabout that same vision independent of the stimulus? Does the mind use the same\nrepresentations for different stimuli? - How are representations categorized,\nidentified, utilized and felt by the mind?\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 4 36\n4.3 Categorizing Functions of the Mind\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThe mind has many functions, and thinking takes many forms.\nThe mind thinks with words, visions and feelings. Any combination of those things\ncould be used in thinking.\nSome feelings the mind thinks with are strong feelings, and these probably\ncommunicate more information to the person. In fact, unconsciously there could be\nmany strong feelings that are felt to some degree that are also informative.\nSo I would think that simply a simple sequence of feelings is what lies behind how the\nmind thinks - and each feeling could trigger thoughts, visions or other associated\nfeelings.\nSo an example of this would be - 'feeling of friend' followed by 'image of friend'\nfollowed by the words 'my friend is coming to visit'.\n4.3.1 How are stimuli expressed in the mind?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nHow are external stimuli expressed in the mind? Thoughts, feelings and words are all\nused to express ideas and feelings for internal thinking. How then does internal\nthinking differ from thinking that is the result of sensory inputs? Is a visual input\nbroken down into categories and each of those categories expressed differently in the\nmind?\nSo if someone sees a white dog they can categorize it at least two ways - 'an object the\ncolor white' and 'a dog'. Each of those properties of the dog might trigger a category in\nthe mind.\nHow is that different than when you just think of a white dog to yourself, however? Are\nthe same mental nodes triggered or does it have a different mental reaction?\nThe difference between real world stimulation and internal thinking could be\ncompared to hearing someone speak versus thinking or reading the same material.\nHow the persons mind responds differently might be explained by how their brain\nprocesses external vs internal stimuli.\n4.3.2 Recalling Experience\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThinking must be more complicated than a series of thoughts, words and\nvisualizations that are either internal or external, however.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 37\nWhen an experience is recalled those things might be brought up - but each\nexperience has a different character and that could bring up or trigger a different\nreaction entirely (that might be separate from the individual stimuli related to the\nexperience).\nOf course the stimuli in the experience help make that experience feel like what it\nfeels like - however there are more complicated things occurring. For instance if three\nvisions come from the experience maybe your mind would generate another vision\nthat would be an internal representation of those three images from the experience.\nSensory inputs and internal outputs all are going to combine to form an experience,\nand the physical inputs might be recalled at various times to assist internal thinking.\n4.3.3 Mental Reality and Physical Reality\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThat means that there is a mental reality and a physical reality. Each has inputs and\noutputs from the mind.\nMy guess would be that each input or output has a 'experiential' quality and a\ncognitive quality. The cognitive quality would be how the factor is understood by your\nthinking and the experiential quality would be how the factor is understood by your\nfeelings.\nSo experiences are understood by the mind more unconsciously and understood with\nfeelings, while more temporary inputs from sensory stimulation are felt and\nunderstood by a persons thoughts.\nFeelings are unconscious - so that is why the complicated aspects of the physical and\nmental world are going to be experienced and understood there (unconsciously).\nCognition and thought is more simple, so more temporary processes are going to be\ncognitive such as images and words - however the experience of an event and its\nexperiential qualities are going to felt and processed unconsciously.\n4.4 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Brandom, Robert.

When a person knows what strategies\ntheir mind is using, or knows what they are thinking or how they are thinking - then\nthey are thinking about their own thinking - and that is 'meta-cognition'.\nNelson and Narens (1990) proposed a conceptual framework that has been adopted\nby most researchers. According to them, cognitive processes may be divided into\nthose that occur at the object level and those that occur at the meta-level: The object\nlevel includes the basic operations traditionally subsumed under the rubric of\ninformation processing \u2013 encoding, rehearsing, retrieving, and so on. The meta-level is\nassumed to oversee object-level operations (monitoring) and return signals to\nregulate them actively in a top-down fashion (control). The object-level, in contrast,\nhas no control over the meta-level and no access to it.\nSo the object level does the automatic processes that are directed or monitored by\nthe conscious mind. For example - text-processing is automatic and therefore it is at\nthe object or unconscious level - however (obviously) the text is also understood\nconsciously. This is because there is a difference between what someone understands\nunconsciously and what someone is understanding consciously.\nEverything the mind does without conscious awareness is by definition unconscious.\nTherefore, most of the mind and its functions are unconscious. For instance you may\nremember many things you don't know about - or even understand many things you\ndon't know consciously (but at times that knowledge might rise to consciousness).\n5.1 Meta-Representations\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nIf meta-cognition is thinking about thinking, then meta-representation is thinking\nabout your representations.\nStrictly speaking a meta-representation is a representation about another\nrepresentation. In this article I use examples of representations and meta-\nrepresentations, but that is subjective. Someone could label any detail as being a\nmeta-representation of another detail it represents - it just depends what you think is\nrepresenting what.\nFor instance if you say 'my dog is green' then you could say that is either a\nrepresentation of your dog or a meta-representation since you are thinking about the\nrepresentation of your dog being green.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 39\nRepresentations are basically something in the world that is represented in your mind\nin some way \u2013 Here Sam Scott explains Von Eckardt's definition of representations:\n\u2022 I will use the term \u201crepresentation\u201d to mean mental representation as defined in\nVon Eckardt's (1999) MITECS entry. Her definition of mental representation is (I\nhope) sufficiently broad and uncontroversial to be acceptable to most of the\nvarious competing currents in cognitive science. According to Von Eckardt, a\n(mental) representation has four important aspects: \u201c(1) it is realized by a\nrepresentation bearer; (2) it has content or represents one or more objects; (3) its\nrepresentation relations are somehow \u2018grounded\u2019; (4) it can be interpreted by (will\nserve as a representation for) some interpreter.\u201d (p. 527) Points (1) and (4) in the\nabove establish that a (mental) representation requires a subject that both bears\nand can interpret the representation.\nSo meta-representation is actually a type of meta-cognition then (unless it is about an\nexternal representation (I explain more about this later) - it is really just a matter of\ndefining the terms) because someone is thinking about their own thoughts. You have\na representation in mind, and when you think more about this representation it\nbecomes a meta-representation. For instance, if you think the thought 'I have a dog'\nthen you have a representation of 'having' your dog. If you think 'I am thinking about\nthe fact that I have a dog' then you are thinking about your representation of your\ndog, so it is more 'meta' then just having the simple representation of your dog.\nThat makes it sound confusing, however. It seems like all representations are 'meta'\nbecause a representation is a representation that a person thinks about to themself -\nand whenever someone has a representation they automatically think about it to\nthemselves. Some representations are more second- hand, however, and these are\nmore considered to be 'meta' representations.\nHybrid metarepresentations are representations of external objects, like a drawing on\na piece of paper. Here Sam Scott references Dennett's theory:\n\u2022 Following Dennett (1998), it stands to reason that if a representation exists as an\nobject in the world, then it too can be represented. Dennett's examples of\nmetarepresentation tend to be of a hybrid nature. For instance a drawing on a\npiece of paper is a type of non-mental representation, which is represented in the\nmind of the person viewing it. The mental representation is of the drawing, but\nsince the drawing is itself a representation, the viewer has a (mental)\nmetarepresentation of whatever it is that the drawing represents.\nWhen someone 'believes' something they don't necessarily have to think about it -\nthey don't have to say to themselves 'I believe this'. When someone does say to\nthemselves 'I believe this' then they are forming a meta-representation because they\nare thinking about some belief they have - they are forming a meta- representation of\nit. The belief is the representation, however when they think about it they become\naware of it and form a higher - 'meta' representation of it.\nFor instance if you think 'I believe I have a dog' then you are thinking about the\nrepresentation of your dog and your belief of that - so you formed a meta-\nrepresentation of a representation (your dog).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 5 40\nThat example also shows what I said previously - that metarepresentations are a type\nof metacognition. That is because they are thoughts about your own thinking (the\nthinking being representations). Unless it is a representation of an external object\nsuch as a drawing, in that case you aren't really thinking about your own thinking you\nare thinking about something that doesn't necessarily require that much thought or is\nalready represented.\nSo it seems there could be some confusion with the terms 'metacognition' and\n'metarepresentation' then. For instance, what exactly is the difference between a\nthought and a representation? When exactly is someone thinking about their own\nthoughts? When exactly is a representation a representation of another\nrepresentation if they are both just individual thoughts in the mind by themselves?\nCould a meta- representation be a thought of another thought?\nWhenever someone thinks they could be considered to be forming representations\nand meta- representations (or cognitions and meta-cognitions). If you think about it,\nas a natural part of the thought process some representations or thoughts are going\nto be capable of being thought about more or in another way - and those could be the\n'meta' cognitions or representations about the original thoughts or representations.\n5.1.1 What is the difference between representing beliefs vs\nother thoughts?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nIs there a difference between belief and thought? Beliefs are more like attitudes\nbecause they are propositions - hence the term 'propositional attitude' - A\npropositionalattitudeis a mental state held by an agent toward a proposition.\nPropositional attitudes are often assumed to be the fundamental units of thought and\ntheir contents, being propositions, are true or false. An agent can have different\npropositional attitudes toward the same proposition (e.g., \u201cS believes that her ice-\ncream is cold,\u201d and \u201cS fears that her ice-cream is cold\u201d).\nSo propositional attitudes are different from propositions - what a proposition is, is\none thing. How we feel about it, or how we regard it, is another. We can accept it,\nassert it, believe it, command it, contest it, declare it, deny it, doubt it, enjoin it, exclaim\nit, expect it. Different attitudes toward propositions are called propositional attitudes,\nand they are also discussed under the headings of intentionality and linguistic\nmodality.\nSo when assertion differs from belief is a topic of concern. For example, we frequently\nfind ourselves faced with the question of whether or not a person's assertions\nconform to his or her beliefs. Discrepancies here can occur for many reasons, but\nwhen the departure of assertion from belief is intentional, we usually call that a lie.\nSo any proposition is a thought, and any thought could be considered to be a\nproposition. What role does attitude or beliefs play? If you believe something, then it is\nlikely you have an attitude about it. That is probably why you came up with the\nproposition in the first place - because you had an attitude or desire to think or do\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 41\nsomething. So all propositions really have attitudes attached, but thoughts that aren't\npropositions don't necessarily have.\nSo what is the difference between a representation that is of an object in the world, an\ninternal representation, a belief or other thoughts? Here Sam Scott references\nDennett:\n\u2022 In Dennett's Making Tools for Thinking (Dennett, 1998), he invites us to speculate\nalong with him on the difference between what he terms \u201cflorid\u201d and \u201cpastel\u201d\nrepresentations. Florid representations are those that become explicit as objects\nin the world, by being encoded in language or some other physical medium\n(drawings on paper, for instance.) He notes that the capacity to form florid\nrepresentations seems to imply the ability to manipulate the representations\nthemselves, which leads him to raise the slogan \u201cno florid representation without\nmetarepresentation.\u201d He further speculates that \u201cbelief about belief\u201d may not be\nthe same thing at all as \u201cthinking about thinking\u201d \u2013 that is, having the ability to\nself-consciously reflect, compare notes with other thinkers, and so on.\nI would say there is a big difference between thinking thoughts that are emotional and\nhave attitudes attached, between representing things that are emotional, and\nbetween representing and thinking things that don't have much to do with beliefs or\nemotion.\n5.2 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Nelson, T.

What is meaning in\nthe mind anyway?\nAn example would be an expression or any saying basically - say someone says 'red\napples taste good'. That statement has a certain significance for both the listeners and\nthe person making the statement. Depending on their experience and understanding\nof how red apples taste their understanding of the statement is going to differ.\nThat was just a verbal example, however. The mind also gets meaning from its\nsurroundings and physical phenomena. The red apples by themselves, for instance,\nmight give the person an experience from just seeing the apples but probably more of\none when they eat one of the apples.\nSo there is verbal or intellectual experience and physical or phenomenal experience -\nthe important question then is how do these two types of experience relate to each\nother - here Heil states Davidson's theory (Heil, J):\n\u2022 Davidson argues that ... every mental token is identical with some physical token.\nYour being in pain at midnight is (let us imagine) identical with some physical\n(presumably neurological) event occurring in your body at midnight, although\nthere is no prospect of translating talk of pain into neurological talk.\nThat theory received a lot of criticism, and I can see why. It doesn't seem like that\nwould ever be literally true - as a guideline it might make some sense that mental\nevents or states correspond with what is going on physically with the body at any time,\nhowever they probably aren't exact because different factors are going to be\ndetermining someones mental cognitions than the factors determining their physical\nbiology.\n6.1 Concepts\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nAccording to the classical theory of concepts, concepts have are complex mental\nrepresentations that have a definitional structure (the concept fits properties\naccording to its definition).\nOther theories developed such as the prototype theory and the dual theory. The\nprototype theory suggests that concepts fit a stereotypical prototype (kind of like\nJungian archetypes). The dual theory developed later and suggests that concepts have\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 43\na 'core' and an 'identification procedure'. However 'Conceptual Atomism' suggests that\nconcepts don't have any structure and they just correspond with what they represent -\nbe that casual or historical.\nIn another article of minem52492(http://cnx.org/content/m52492/latest/)I reference\nJames Sully (1892) who points out that concepts have three parts - abstraction,\ncomparison and generalization. That suggests that people go through a process of\nthinking for each concept - they compare the concept to other concepts, generalize\nthe concept - but first just have an abstract picture of the concept.\nHis simple explanation basically just points out that concepts involve thinking 'more'\nabout each concept - including generalizing it. The other theories of concepts all have\nvalid points as well however. The prototype theory suggests generalization is involved\n(as prototypes are generalized). And the dual theory suggests that identification is\ninvolved (which is similar to comparison). While the atomism theory suggests that it is\njust a simple thought process - which would be the 'abstraction' phase of\nunderstanding the concepts.\n6.1.1 Concepts and experiential qualities\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nSo how would a thought process of a concept occur in the mind? First you would think\na little about the concept - an abstraction - then you would think more about the\nconcept and possibly compare it to other concepts or even the real experiences\ninvolving the concept (such as when the concept occurred in a real life situation) and\nthen you would come to a conclusion about the concept and generalize it as this or\nthat type of concept (It doesn't necessarily occur in that order, however - these are my\ntheories).\nHow might someone know when a concept is being thought about? Humans probably\nthink about a lot of advanced concepts all the time. They might only know about their\nthoughts or concepts some of the time however, and certainly not the full implications\nor experiential aspects of them (much of this must be unconscious).\nSome Questions about the Mind\n\u2022 One question is about perception - is its aim to provide accurate perceptions?\nWhen you consider how the unconscious mind thinks versus how the conscious\nmind thinks then the answer is no because many things you simply want a feel\nfor and therefor couldn't possible have an accurate perception of.\n\u2022 What is the relationship between attention to action and awareness of mind?\nClearly being aware of ones physical actions gives a sense of self or agency - and\nthat that therefore is a part of 'being present' or getting a feel for yourself and the\npeople around you.\n\u2022 How subjective is pain introspection and emotional introspection? Are pain and\nemotion second hand representations that come from thoughts of the original\npain or are they direct feelings? Is a model of pain or emotion needed in mind in\norder for these feelings to be processed?\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 6 44\n\u2022 Are there different levels to representations? Is a meta-representation a\nrepresentation of another representation or is it the same representation just\nthought about more? What happens when someone thinks more about a\nrepresentation or compares it with other representations? Can the mind be\ndivided up that way - based on individual representations or do representations\n'merge' into each other (i.e. the feeling or thought of one representation\ninfluencing the feeling or thought of another).\nSome Questions about Concept and Image Associations\n\u2022 When a concept is thought about more than its initial abstraction, is it thought\nabout verbally or non-verbally - or some combination of both?\n\u2022 When a concept is compared with other concepts that are related or similar - or\nnot related and dissimilar - is it compared by using words or by using\ncomparative images?\n\u2022 I would think that when a concept is thought about 'more' it is automatically\ncompared to similar concepts because similar things in life are naturally\nassociated with each other.\n\u2022 Is visual processing (processing of visual images or visual thinking) unconscious or\nconscious? That is, when the mind uses images to think does it do so\nunconsciously or consciously?\n\u2022 Images naturally accompany thought all of the time, both consciously and\nunconsciously. It is hard to figure out or explain how exactly this occurs, however.\n\u2022 For instance, there could be fast, more unconscious images or slow, deliberate\nand conscious images that accompany thoughts.\n\u2022 Would the unconscious images be as useful or informative as conscious images?\nHow is it even possible to 'partially' visualize an event or idea or experience?\n6.1.2 Words provide management of images\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWords manage and direct the imagination process. It would be hard to go through a\nsequence of thinking about one or multiple things simply by visualizing their\noccurrences. Here (Paivio, 1979) talks about the two processes of images and words\nand how they relate:\n\u2022 One important hypothesis concerning the interaction of the processes is that\nimages are particularly effective in promoting rapid associations while verbal\nprocesses give them direction. something of this kind has been suggested, for\nexample, by Rugg in connection with the requisites of the creative act, which are\nsaid to include \"a well filled storehouse of imagery to guarantee richness and\nfreedom of association, and of ordered key concepts to guarantee organization of\nthought\" (1963, p. 311). Imagery is characteristic of autistic thinking in general\nand in that context is free of logical restraints; verbal processes superimposed on\nsuch imagery presumably contribute order and direction. These hypothesized,\nmutually supportive functions of images and words can be viewed as a\nconsequence of the relative weighing of parallel processing and sequential\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 45\nprocessing features in the two systems: Imagery having both spatially and\noperationally parallel properties, is likely to be characterized by freedom and\nspeed of association, whereas the sequentially organized verbal system is capable\nof providing organization to the associative process.\nSome Questions about Representations, Images and Abstraction\n\u2022 Are there different levels of the complexity of mental images?\n\u2022 Can an image be thought about more by making a more complex or sequentially\nnext image of it?\n\u2022 If one image fits one representation, then it could be said that there are 'images'\nand 'meta- images (or visualizations)' and that those are comparable to\nrepresentations and meta-representations.\n\u2022 How do visualizations and images relate to the concreteness or abstractness of\nmental concepts?\n\u2022 Would an abstract concept be harder to visualize or easier than a concrete\nconcept?\n\u2022 For instance, visualizing numbers might be simple but visualizing an abstract\nconcept might be challenging if its symbol is difficult to understand (but it might\nbe 'understood' unconsciously.\n\u2022 So visions or images can take on a simple, unconscious form perhaps like in\ndreams with dream symbols and images.\n\u2022 I guess that unconscious image processing is more simple than conscious\nprocessing - like how the images in dreams are more simple than images people\nhave when they are conscious.\n6.1.3 Conclusion\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nImages are used to compare and contrast conceptual information. People think about\ntheir experiences with these unconscious images and thoughts. A concept could be a\nsummary or example of a certain type of experience, and using images would\nprobably create more detail for the concept. Words obviously trigger and direct\nconceptual thinking, however the content of conceptual thinking comes from feelings\nor visualizations. Visualizations might be tied in with fast thinking or slow, emotional\nthinking. Doing math doesn't require emotional processes but would require complex\nvisual processes but not necessarily complex conceptual thought - since most\nadvanced thought is actually emotionally based and might or might not use emotional\nprocesses when thinking.\nThe question then would be when is an emotional process used in thinking. I\nmentioned that math doesn't require emotional processes and was just visual. Many\nconcepts are just visual even if they are emotional concepts, however - so this could\nbe difficult to figure out.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 6 46\n6.2 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Heil, J.

Consciousness uses the functions of\ncognition and emotion to operate the mind. Cognition is basically all of a minds\nmental abilities related to knowledge and thinking. While sensing and feeling physical\nfeelings are the more emotional functions of the mind.\nPeople use their cognitions to understand the world around them. Emotions can\nassist in understanding as well, however they often slow down or inhibit cognition\n(such as when someone is drunk). Here is (Trigg, J and Kalish, M):\n\u2022 In a nontechnical sense, perceiving, remembering, believing, and judging are\nexamples of cognition; imagining, idle thinking, wondering, and intending are not.\nIn this sense, cognition is what happens when someone takes in how things are\nor becomes cognizant of some thing, event, or fact. Conversely, if something is\ncognized it becomes known somehow to someone. To say of someone that his\ncognitive faculties were impaired by drunkenness on some occasion would be to\nsay that his capacity to attend to, take in, or get to know his surroundings was\nimpaired by drunkenness on that occasion.\nJames Sully wrote in a book published in 1892 titled \"The Human Mind\" that there are\nthree different mental functions - knowing, feeling and willing:\n\u2022 By help of such a process of analysis carried out on a variety of psychological\nphenomena psychologists have come to distinguish between three radically\ndifferent mental functions. These, which are pretty clearly recognized in our\neveryday distinctions, are known as Feeling, Knowing, and Willing.\n\u2022 In order to illustrate the difference between these modes of mental\nmanifestation, we may select almost any example of a familiar mental\nexperience. For instance, I see an apple on a tree. I may be affected by the beauty\nof its colour glowing in the midst of its cool green surroundings. Such a mental\nstate of delightful admiration would be properly described as a feeling or\naffective state. Or, again, if I happen to be a connoisseur of apples my mind may\nbe stimulated by the site of the object to note its peculiar characteristics with a\nview to characterize the particular variety to which it belongs. Such a direction of\nmental activity would come under the head of knowing, cognitive process of\nintellection. And, lastly, if I happen to be hot and thirsty the sight of the apple may\nvery likely insight a desire to pluck and eat it and prompt the corresponding\nactions. And in this case what goes on in my mind would be a process of willing,\nvolition or conation.\n\u2022 It can easily be seen that there is no mental process which cannot be brought\nunder one or more of these three heads. Whatever state of mind we happen to\nbe in, we shall always find that it is fully described by help of these three\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 7 48\nfundamental or primary functions. To be affected by some feeling, as wonder,\nlove, or grief, to be following out some process of intellectual inquiry, or to be\nactively engaged in doing something or preparing to do something, this seems to\nexhaust all known forms of mental operation.\nWhat he said about the three states of mind makes sense - of course there is more to\nmental functioning than knowing, willing or intention and feeling however those three\nfunctions could describe most of the surface functions of the mind - that is, what is\nsimply going on not necessarily how the mind is doing it.\nLater in the book he talks about concepts - it is important to point out that concepts\nare first simple and then they move to being more complex concepts as one thinks\nmore about them. The three stages he talks about are abstraction, comparison and\ngeneralization:\n\u2022 The common account of conception here followed, as made up of a sequence of\nthree stages, comparison,abstraction and generalization, rather describes the\nideal form of the process as required by logic than the mental process actually\ncarried out. As we saw above, a vague analysis or abstraction precedes that\nmethodical comparison of things by which the abstraction becomes precise and\nperfect, that is to say, definite points of likeness (or unlikeness) are detected. With\nrespect to generalisation, is has already been pointed out that this is to some\nextent involved in abstraction. To see the roundness of the ball is vaguely and\nimplicitly to assimilate the ball to other round objects. It is to be added that an\nimperfect grasp of general features as such commonly precedes the methodical\nprocess here described. The child realises in a measure the general function of\nthe name 'horse' before he carries out a careful comparative analysis of the\nequine characters. At the same time the use of the word 'generalisation' is\nimportant as marking off the clear mental grasp of the class-idea as such, that is,\nthe idea of an indeterminate number of objects, known and unknown, answering\nto a certain description.\nThat is a simple explanation of concepts, however. Concepts that involve the self are\nmore complicated, and concepts also have personal intentions involved and\nassociated with them. In this next quote Don Perlis talks about intending with\nexpressions and intentions (such as when coining an expression and using self-\nreference). When someone says an expression they are intending it to refer to\nsomething (its referent), and they also intend for the listener to understand that they\nintend the intending. They also are referring to themselves - to their present, past and\nfuture activity:\n\u2022 What is it then, for an agent to \"take\" one thing to \"refer\" to another? Consider a\nprimitive case: coining an expression, explicitly linking a symbol s to a referent r.\nThis would seem to be no more nor less than an intention to use s as a stand-in\nfor r in certain contexts. Following this trail, we now ask what it is to intend\nsomething, and we are smack-dab in the middle of both philosophy of language\nand philosophy of mind. And to reinvoke Grice, every utterance is a case not\nmerely of intending, but also of intending listeners to understand that the utterer\nintends that intending. Can all this happen in the absence of a fairly sophisticated\n(and quite possibly conscious) cognitive engine? Moreover, the natural languages\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 49\nthat we use for expression of intentions are-as noted- their own metalanguages,\nallowing loopy self-reference made possible by our intentions to so refer: We\nspeak of ourselves, not just past or future, but our immediate present self and\npresent activity including the activity of noting that activity.\n\u2022 So, once again, does meta have a me? If meta involves reference, and if reference\ninvolves agency with intentions, including intentional self-referring activity, and if\nthat in turn is at least a hint of a self, then yes.\n7.1 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Perlis, D.

How could one carve out the mental faculties and processes responsible for\nbelief formation and revision? Here is (Goldman, A):\n\u2022 An initial phase of this undertaking is to sharpen our conceptualization of the\ntypes of cognitive units that should be targets of epistemic evaluation. Lay people\nare pretty vague about the the sorts of entites that quality as intellectual virtues\nor vices. In my description of epistemic folkways, I have been deliberately\nindefinite about these entities, calling them variously \"faculties,\" \"processes,\"\n\"mechanisms,\" and the like. How should systematic epistemology improve on this\nscore?\n\u2022 A first possibility, enshrined in the practice of historical philosophers, is to take\nthe relevant units to be cognitive faculties. This might be translated into modern\nparlance as modules, except that this term has assumed a rather narrow,\nspecialized meaning under Jerry Fodor's (1983) influential treatment of\nmodularity. A better translation might be (cognitive) systems e.g., the visual\nsystem, long-term memory, and so forth. Such systems, however, are also\nsuboptimal candidates for units of epistemic analysis. Many beliefs are the\noutputs of two or more systems working in tandem. For example, a belief\nconsisting in the visual classification of an object (\"That is a chair\") may involve\nmatching some information in the visual system with a category stored in long-\nterm memory. A preferable unit of analysis, then, might be a process, construed\nas the sort of entity depicted by familiar flow charts of cognitive activity. This sort\nof entity depicted by familiar flow charts of cognitive activity. This sort of diagram\ndepicts a sequence of operations (or sets of parallel operations), ultimately\nculminating in a belief -like output. Such a sequence may span several cognitive\nsystems. This is the sort of entity I had in mind in previous publications (especially\nGoldman 1986) when I spoke of \"cognitive processes.\"\n\u2022 Even this sort of entity, however, is not fully a satisfactory unit of analysis. Visual\nclassification, for example, may occur under a variety of degraded conditions. The\nstimulus may be viewed from an unusual orientation; it may be partly occluded,\nso that only certain of its parts are visible; and so forth. Obviously, these factors\ncan make a big difference to the reliability of the classification process. Yet it is\none and the same process that analyzes the stimulus data and comes to a\nperceptual \"conclusion.\" So the same process can have different degrees of\nreliability depending on a variety of parameter values. For purposes of epistemic\nassessment, it would be instructive to identify the parameters and parameter\nvalues that are critically relevant to degrees of reliability. The virtues and vices\nmight then be associated not with processes per se, but with processes operating\nwith specified parameter value.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 51\nSo various mental faculties might be responsible for belief formation like memory and\nvision. I would think that emotional processes also would obviously be responsible as\nwell (as beliefs are emotional). Unconscious or conscious processes could help form\nbeliefs, and that in turn could determine what the persons goals and drives are like.\nHow does the mind process sensory inputs? Sensory experiences in the mind have the\nlabel 'qualia' (Kim, J):\n\u2022 Sensations have characteristic qualitative features; these are called \"phenomenal\"\nor \"phenomenological\" or \"sensory\" qualities-\"qualia\" is now the standard term.\nSeeing a ripe tomato has a certain distinctive sensory quality that is unmistakably\ndifferent from the sensory quality involved in see a bunch of spinach leaves. We\nare familiar with the smells of roses and ammonia; we can tell the sound of a\ndrum from that of a gong; the feel of a cool, smooth granite countertop as we run\nour fingers over it is distinctively different from the feel of sandpaper. Our waking\nlife is a continuous fast of qualia- colors, smells, sounds and all the rest. When we\nare temporarily unable to taste or smell properly because of a bad cold, eating a\nfavorite food can be like chewing cardboard and we are made acutely aware of\nwhat is missing from our experience.\nHow do these sensory qualities determine how we feel overall? Does the physical\nmatch up with the mental? (Kim, J):\n\u2022 On the functionalist account, mental states are realized by the internal physical\nstates of the psychological subject; so for humans, the experience of red, as a\nmental state, is realized by a specific neural state. This means that you and I\ncannot differ in respect of the qualia we experience as long as we are in the same\nneural state; given that both you and I are in the same neural state, something\nthat is in principle ascertainable by observation, either both of us experience red\nor neither does.\nSo some aspects of mental states are physical and some are mental - here is another\nquote from the same author (Kim, J):\n\u2022 In any case, is seems plausible that there are conscious mental states with no\nspecial phenomenal character. In general, mental occurrences that we call\n\"experiences\" appear to be those that possess phenomenal properties. Sensing\nand perceiving are experiences, but we do not think of believing and thinking as\nexperiences. If this is so, the idea of phenomenal character and the idea of there\nbeing something it is like may come apart, though only slightly. For it certainly\nseems that there is something it is like to believe something, to suspend\njudgment about something, to wonder about something, or to hope for\nsomething. But as we saw, at least many instances of these states do not seem to\nhave any phenomenal character.\nHow does someone know when they are conscious of something or in a conscious\nstate? A good way to answer that would be to compare animals to humans, as that\nmight illustrate how humans are more conscious. - Can you attribute intentionality\nwithout attributing consciousness? Here (Gennaro, R) asks that question:\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 8 52\n\u2022 Can significant explanatory power be achieved by making intentional attributions\nwithout attributions of consciousness? It seems to me that the answer is clearly\nyes, as the animals' case in the previous paragraph shows. We would, I suggest,\nstill rightly attribute all unconscious intentional states to such animals. would or\nshould we withdraw intentional attributions to an animal if we later come to\nagree that it is not conscious? I don't think so. Such attributions are useful in\nexplaining and predicting animal behavior, but it does not follow that they have\nmerely \"as-if\" intentionality. In some cases, we may not know if they are\nconscious. The same i suggest, would hold for advanced robots. This is not\nnecessarily to embrace some kind of antirealist Dennetean \"intentional stance\"\nposition (Dennett 1987). For one thing, we might still agree that those systems\nhave genuine internal mental representations.\nI would say that animals have perceptions or even higher-order perceptions (HOP) but\ndon't have thoughts or higher-order thoughts (HOT). A perception or thought is higher\norder when it takes another perception or thought as its object - such as you being\naware of your thought or perception on a certain thing. Animals might have thoughts\nor perceptions then, but probably not higher order ones since they are basically\nfunctioning unconsciously if you were to compare them to humans.\nYou could say that animals don't really have 'conscious' thoughts since they don't\nthink about what they are thinking about. They don't really have higher-level thoughts\nsince they just have simplistic thoughts or thoughts that don't involve complex\nrepresentations (or they don't make the representations complex).\nFor instance when someone thinks 'I just did this' then they are thinking more\nconsciously about what they did and the thoughts that were involved. That enables\nfurther action or introspection that animals don't have.\n8.1 Is the mind physical or mental?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nPhysicalism is a philosophical position holding that everything which exists is no more\nextensive than its physical properties; that is, that there are no kinds of things other\nthan physical things.

However, when someone 'infers' something it isn't simple\nat all. They are making a guess as to what that concept is like and how it might be like\nother concepts.\n'Inferring' then is basically analyzing levels of emotional subtlety. You get an idea of an\nidea or concept and this idea triggers you to think more about it and guess or infer\nother properties related to it.\nIs understanding that simple then? How much of this 'inferring and relating' process is\nemotional? someone could do mathematical calculations, which would involve\nactivating networks like a computer does - but it wouldn't process the information\nexactly like a computer at all. The nodes connecting the mathematical equations\nwould be emotional nodes or nodes with feeling and the consequences of feelings\nattached, not like a computer that is programmed with 1s and 0s.\n8.3 Concept aquisition\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nA concept can be an association between a mental representation and a perceptually\nrepresented object, or a concept could be an association between a feeling and an\nobject (both are basically the same thing).\nConcepts are formed when unconscious feelings become linked to an object - this\nmakes the object more able to be verbally described and conscious.\nIf animals formed concepts then they would be able to adapt their behavior in more\ncreative fashions because they would be capable of more complex thought. The\nconcepts they form are merely unconscious - A leads to B,, so don't do A - which is less\nsophisticated than a humans ability to manipulate concepts which goes something like\n'maybe I can do this instead of that because of this or that reason'.\n8.4 Concept categorization\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nConcepts are going to be categorized differently.

That also explains\nhow brains can function without the organs being fully developed in a 'final' state -\nbecause a lot of the brain can still work just with less functionality.\n8.5 Bibliography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Gennaro, R.

I could say that mental states have been determined by the\nminds representations of all internal and external data.\nAt any time humans are in some various mental state - i.e. happiness, curiosity, anger,\nexcitement, dread, or passiveness. I guess a question could be why is it hard to have a\nmix of some mental states - such as a combination of happiness and anger? Some\ncombinations of mental states are common and make sense, while others (like being\nhappy and sad at the same time) are hard on a person or difficult to acquire.\nThat is why concepts and consciousness has a scope and a limit - because there are\nonly so many combinations of mental states, and it is hard to achieve many of these\nstates.\n9.1 Concepts, Perceptions and Beliefs\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nHow are concepts, beliefs and perceptions related?\nI suppose it depends on which type of each of those is being referred to. For instance\n'perception' could mean just simple visual perceptions or it could mean how the mind\nperceives emotional or conceptual phenomena. 'Belief' could mean beliefs that are\nindependent of stimuli (that you think about at a random time) versus beliefs a person\nforms from current incoming stimuli.\nConceptual phenomena can vary considerably. There are simple concepts like\nunderstanding the purposes of objects - those are definitional concepts. Other\nconcepts concern human or animal behavior and an understanding of how they\nachieve certain goals. Other concepts are more emotional and concern beliefs and\nmotivated goals, or abstract emotional concepts like in politics, history or the news\n(such as human events and affairs).\nI guess the important question to ask then is how do those three ideas - conceptual\nthinking, perceptions and beliefs relate to each other considering the differing topics\ninvolved.\nFor instance, for any perceptual stimuli a concept, belief or abstract perception could\nbe formed.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 10 56\nChapter 10 An Idea of Mental\nAbilities Cognition, Language and\nDeveloptnent\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhat is the relationship between cognition and language, and how do those\nprocesses develop?\nWhen someone learns something new they are going to think about it in some way.\nWords assist learning, and the choice of words that someone uses is going to\ninfluence the meaning behind what is learned.\nThat isn't necessarily the case, however. It could be that your unconscious mind has\nan emotional understanding of the knowledge, and the words you use simply point to\nthis understanding - and if you happened to use different words it could point to the\nsame understanding.\nWords Assist Learning\n\u2022 Words assist learning everything - for whatever topic in life you think about with\nwords, the fact that you use words to think about the experience or whatever it is\nhelps understanding.\n\u2022 Although that doesn't mean that in every case if you think more with words you'll\nunderstand something better.\n\u2022 Life is about various types of emotional understanding, and words can assist or\neven possibly hinder this understanding.\n\u2022 So when a baby uses a word like 'goed' - that has an emotional understanding for\nthe baby.

Harr\u00e9 (1981a) claims that in\nthe 'real' world, explanations are functional in a self-presentational sense. They\nfunction as a ritual display, as rhetoric, as show: they are designed to impress, and\naffect others impressions. And that people operate in a 'rhetorical impression\nmanipulating manner'. There is a self-presentational motivation for peoples\nexplanations (that is, someone has in mind their own presentation of themselves,\nwhat they look like, how they are perceived by others, etc when they make any\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 57\nexplanation). Here Harr\u00e9 (1981b) tries to subsume all human affairs into a self-\npresentational motive:\n\u2022 What sort of statements are being made in concrete social activities, such as\nstrikes, riots, parties, working breakfasts, overtaking in the inner lane and so on?\nStarting with these as rough guides: modern strikes can hardly be seriously taken\nto be economically motivated. They are best understood as claims to recognition\nand dignity, as displays of worth: riots too may be something like that: look at me,\nand take me seriously.\nSo when people think in social situations, their thoughts are probably mostly\nemotionally driven by self- presentational goals. This doesn't mean that all thought is\ndriven by emotion, it simply means that a lot of thought is motivated. So I have\nbrought up a slightly different question here - how much of thought is emotional?\nWhat is it like to have a thought be motivated by feeling vs. not?\n10.2 Classifying types of mental information\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nWhat are the different types of mental information? There are abstract concepts and\nobjective facts - which relates to emotional information and numerical ability\nrespectively. There is reasoning ability, and there is associative memory (which is\nbasically linking similar objects together for faster recall). Reasoning ability doesn't\nnecessarily relate to the amount or speed of someones memory - reasoning is\nsomething someone can think about by choice, while memory is less under someones\ncontrol. A person could think of this or that in order to help remember something,\nhowever that wouldn't effect their measured I.Q. memory. Reasoning, however, is very\nsubjective and someone could do a lot to increase reasoning ability.\nWhat is subjective about reasoning information? It is that the information is about\nemotional material. Historical fact is about emotional material, and you could be\nconsidered to be using your reasoning ability when thinking about history. In fact, any\nidea related to human motivation is emotional and therefore subjective and subject to\nsomeone's reasoning ability. Unless someone uses reason to solve a math problem, or\nsomething objective, then reasoning is using emotional information and is subjective.\n10.3 Bibiography\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Harr\u00e9, R. 1981a.

This would suggest that whatever engine is\nengineering, or designing the dreams is a weird and/or stupid one. Things in dreams\noften don\u2019t make any sense in reality, but dreams are often incredibly sophisticated at\nthe same time. This would suggest that dreams are emotional, not logical. Emotion is\nvery complicated, but it often doesn\u2019t make any logical sense. Dreams convey feelings\nvery well, they amplify feelings, they don\u2019t amplify logic.\nFor example, say you were thinking about a toothbrush that day, or had a lot of\nthoughts about brushing your teeth, or had some trouble with the dentist and it was\nbothering you. In your dream that night, you wouldn\u2019t think about the events of the\nday, or logically think about how you could fix your tooth problem. In fact the logical\nthing would probably never occur in your dream, that would be out of character since\ndreams are more emotional, you\u2019d probably never dream thinking \u201cah I should brush\nmy teeth more thoroughly\u201d. Instead you\u2019d dream of a really big toothbrush or\nsomething immature, childish, and extremely emotional. Or maybe get a large\nsensation of your teeth being brushed. See how one is more emotional than the\nother?\nDreams are so emotional that there is little room for anything logical, it\u2019s as if all your\nbrain power is being converted into it\u2019s emotional essence. This is easy to prove, think\nof any dream you\u2019ve ever had, or ever heard of, whatever it was, it didn\u2019t make\ncomplete sense. The fact that NO dream EVER makes complete sense must mean that\nthe higher, logical part of your brain is shut off during sleep. That makes sense since if\nyou were actually thinking, you\u2019d want to experience real emotions and move your\nbody around to get that experience, not just think about them.\nThis might make dreams more sexual or Freudian, but more importantly anything that\nis most strongly emotional to the person having the dream. Take this dream for\nexample \u201cI was at a type of arena-ish thing but it had balconies like a theater would.\u201d\nNotice first off that it doesn\u2019t make sense, arena\u2019s don\u2019t have balconies like a theater\nwould. Clearly if the person was thinking clearly she/he wouldn\u2019t have been able to put\ntheater balconies in an arena. Now there sometimes are balconies in an arena, but\nthis person must have been referring to balconies that were pretty like they are in\ntheaters with strong contrast to the arena, say like a stone arena with pretty wooden\nbalconies in pink and stuff in them. That description I gave sounds like a typical dream\nbecause it doesn\u2019t make sense, and due to the contrast/mix of the arena and the\ntheater, it is very emotional.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 59\nThe mix of the two things makes it more emotional because it is something which you\nwouldn\u2019t find anywhere in reality. Things that stand out tend to be more emotional,\nand anything that doesn\u2019t make sense, like doesn\u2019t make ANY sense, is going to be\nemotional because it stands out from your everyday experience. Something like a\ngiant gumball rolling over and over in your head, that doesn\u2019t make any sense, and its\nemotional. But why is it emotional? It is because you never find giant gumballs (that\nare chewed just standing around outside) so if you found one, you\u2019d be in shock, and\nvery emotional.\nThere are things that are emotional and can be found in real life of course. Take this\ndream \u201cI was a warrior in a med-evil battle with Mel Gibson and we fought some kind\nof beasts with our golden swords lol Mel got his head chopped off and I awakened\nwhen I was being choked by a med-evil beast. ...\u201d It would probably be more emotional\nfor the dreamer to be doing something with Mel Gibson, since it\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll ever\ndo something with Mel and therefore would find it rare when he did, so it\u2019s a not\nrealistic, out of the ordinary, emotional experience. Furthermore they are using gold\nswords, how often are gold swords used? Gold is a more emotional color than steel as\nwell. Color is emotional, so color, a dramatic color, or large color contrasts are often\nfound in dreams to further amplify emotion.\nTake this dream, see how emotional it is, emotional, not realistic, and amplified for\ndramatic content.\n\u201cI am the best student in a hard science class of some sort. Every day before class I\nhold study sessions. Everyone fails the first test but me. We are all milling about in the\nhall after class. The teacher and some other students express interest in the study\nsessions, but I say I don't really need them. They seem disappointed. Then I tell\neveryone \"Hey, all those study sessions that I've been having... BY MYSELF... will still be\nthere next week\" inviting them. The professor asks anyone with a disease to hang\naround and see her in ten minutes, saying she has the shakes. She's very concerned\nwith her health, which has been strange for some time. I think about staying, but I\nleave. I see Joe Horvath in the hall and hug him, but I see that he has a finger the looks\nlike it was smashed and healed flattish and deformed. There are flecks of blue paint or\nnail polish or the nail is flecked blue. When I ask him about it he says he didn't even\nnotice and doesn't know what happened, but it doesn't hurt.\u201d\nThe dreamer thinks he is the best in the class, not just any class, but a hard science\nclass. He is so much better than anyone else, that he has \u201cstudy sessions\u201d by himself.\nOf course that doesn\u2019t make any sense, the people were asking him about a study\nsession, implying that a study session would involve more than one person, like they\nusually do. But in his dream he forgets logic and all of a sudden he is the only person\nneeded for a study session, in real life he wouldn\u2019t have said that because it just\nwouldn\u2019t be a proper thing to say - he wouldn't say something that silly in real life. To\nmake the dream even more emotional another out of the ordinary event is occurring:\nthe teacher is feeling sick, and her health has been \u201cstrange for some time\u201d not bad\nfor sometime, but strange for some time, the word strange would imply something\nreally out of the ordinary going on, like an extraterrestrial disease or something weird,\nthe weirdness and out of the ordinariness being added for extra emotional content, of\ncourse. Does this mean that the dreamer is afraid of a strange disease? No it just\nmeans he is trying to entertain himself in his sleep by adding extra dramatic content\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 11 60\nby using the word strange, instead of bad. (it\u2019s extremely rare to use the word strange\nwhen describing that one is sick, so what I suggested about extraterrestrial\nimplications makes more sense). When you say, \u201coh I\u2019ve been feeling strange lately\u201d\nyou are implying that something really weird is going on with you (or in this case your\nhealth) which would bring up further rise for concern, or a further rise in emotional,\ndramatic content!\nTake this dream \u201cWe\u2019re in a hotel. We all have rooms, but we\u2019re in Steve\u2019s room. There\nare multiple beds that may be stacked. We are trying to make music. A boy starts\nplaying guitar and it\u2019s fantastic. Steve holds up my cell phone, it\u2019s recording, he hands\nit to me. Steve asks me to play it back. There is a lot of music. One song my clarinet is\nso sharp. Steve says \u2018if you can\u2019t hear that\u2026\u2019 condescending. Steve leaves the room.\nWe are competing for his attention, girls and boys. I am on a bed that is high. I know\nI\u2019m the favorite and they\u2019re asking me about it and I decide to leave. I slide off the bed,\nthen reach up under the rail and grab a black candle (handmade) and a cigarette and\nsomething else.\u201d That is also very out of the ordinary, in fact that would probably\nnever actually happen in real life because everyone in the hotel would hear the music.\nThe dreamer obviously wasn\u2019t logically, clearly thinking. If she/he was then the dream\nwould have ended with the people next door complaining about the noise, or there\nbeing somewhere in the dream something about checking to see if the hall was clear,\nbut even then someone might walk down it. The point is it is very out of the ordinary,\nwhich, since it is rare, is probably more emotional solely because it\u2019s a new and\nexciting experience that you furthermore can\u2019t have in real life, so it also has that \u201cI\nwant it since I can\u2019t have it\u201d emotional feel. This is the real kicker, you can sense that\nthe dream wouldn\u2019t have made any sense if they actually checked to see if there were\nother people in the hall. It is only an ordinary, regular dream, if it doesn\u2019t make sense.\nAnd you can sense that that is true.\nLet\u2019s see how out of the ordinary this dream is. (All this so far proves that dreams are\nout of the ordinary, probably just to add emotional content because of the contrast\nwith reality). \u201cWe are rehearsing. Instead of a lyrics sheet there is a flat piece of 3D art.\nIt\u2019s a series of concentric circles. One of the circles is made to look like a brick wall.\nThat\u2019s the verse I am supposed to sing. I get singled out and have to sing the verse\nalone. It\u2019s about life going around and down forever. There\u2019s an infinity symbol.\u201d\nFor starters there is no such thing as a flat piece of 3D art, 3D is 3D, but you can see\nhow that would be fun for the dreamer to think about, entertaining for him to think\nabout how it could be 3D, yet not 3D at the same time. This emphasizes the emotional\ncontent, but it low on the logical content. Why is the emotional content emphasized?\nBecause dreams are for entertainment, you\u2019re trying to have fun in your dream. So he/\nshe mixes the lyrics sheet, 3D art, and flat together. That\u2019s a fun thing to do. Dreams in\ngeneral are going to be more on the fun side, less on the logical, ah this makes sense\nside. Take the line \u201cone of the circles is made to look like a brick wall\u201d. That just doesn\u2019t\nmake any sense. Exactly, that\u2019s what is fun about it, trying to imagine something that\ndoesn\u2019t make any sense. Trying to put together in reality, things that just can\u2019t be put\ntogether. It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying and trying to do something that just can\u2019t be done.\nThat\u2019s behavior typical of an immature child that just won\u2019t give up. It\u2019s fun to try and\nbreak reality and put things together that don\u2019t belong together. That way you create\nsomething new and different, something you\u2019d want to dream about.

See things they\u2019ve never seen, and experience emotions that\nthey aren\u2019t going to be able to experience in other places.\n11.1 Dreaming and the Brain\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\"Although the details of human hopes are surely beyond the imagination of other\ncreatures,\" writes Jaak Panksepp in Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of\nHuman and Animal Emotions (1998), \"the evidence now clearly indicates that certain\nintrinsic aspirations of all mammalian minds, those of mice as well as men, are driven\nby the same ancient neurochemistries.\"\nPanksepp describes the SEEKING system as follows:\n\u2022 This emotional system is a coherently operating neuronal network that promotes\na certain class of survival abilities. This system makes animals intensely interested\nin exploring their world and leads them to become excited when they are about\nto get what they desire. It eventually allows animals to find and eagerly anticipate\nthe things they need for survival, including, of course, food, water, warmth, and\ntheir ultimate evolutionary survival need, sex. In other words, when fully aroused,\nit helps fill the mind with interest and motivates organisms to move their bodies\neffortlessly in search of the things they need, crave, and desire. In humans, this\nmay be one of the main brain systems that generate and sustain curiosity, even\nfor intellectual pursuits. This system is obviously quite efficient at facilitating\nlearning, especially mastering information about where material resources are\nsituated and the best way to obtain them. It also helps assure that our bodies will\nwork in smoothly patterned and effective ways in such quests.\nWhen the mesolimbic pathway from the dopamine-producing VTA to the nucleus\naccumbens is stimulated, SEEKING behavior ensues. Panksepp writes: \"For instance,\nstimulated rats move about excitedly, sniffing vigorously, pausing at times to\ninvestigate various nooks and crannies of their environment. If one presents the\nanimal with a manipulandum, a lever that controls the onset of brain stimulation, it\nwill readily learn to press the lever and will eagerly continue to 'self-stimulate' for\nextended periods, until physical exhaustion and collapse set in. The outward behavior\nof the animal commonly appears as if it is trying to get something behind the lever.\"\nThe mesolimbic pathway is activated trans-synaptically by normal rewards (food,\nwater, copulation) but it can also be activated directly by the induced rewards of\nintravenous drugs or electrical or chemical brain stimulation (Wise). 1The mesolimbic\npathway is one of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain that modulates behavioral\nresponses to rewarding stimuli. It originates in the VTA and connects to the limbic\nsystem via the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex. A\nnumber of drugs are rewarding when they are injected into the nucleus accumbens\n1.Wise RA. \"Brain Reward Circuitry: Insights from Unsensed Incentives.\" Neuron. 2002; 36:229-340\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 11 62\nand act as mesolimbic dopamine terminals, 2and the axons of the mesolimbic\ndopamine system have high thresholds for stimulation (Wise).\nPanksepp points out that when animals are in an appetitive state, anticipating a\nreward such as food or sex with a receptive mate, dopamine levels increase. But once\nan appetitive state turns into a consummatory state, dopamine levels immediately\nbegin to decrease. So increasing levels of dopamine are not associated with\nconsummatory, pleasurable activity. Rather the opposite is true. Pleasure is associated\nwith decreasing dopamine levels. This does not mean that \"reward\" circuitry does not\nexist. Panksepp writes: \"Temporal and frontal cortices contain an abundance of\nneurons that fire only in response to stimuli that have acquired meaning by being\npredictably associated with rewards.\"\nThat just means that once someone gets a reward they are satisfied. Most types of\nreward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, however pleasure apparently\ndecreases dopamine levels.\nSince humans think less when they are dreaming, it makes sense that dreams are\nemotional and not logical. I could say that they are driven by their 'reward system'\nwhen they are dreaming - the higher intellectual functions of their brain are shut off.\nThey retreat into a more simplistic emotional state where they turn normal daily\nactivity into some sort of silly movie.\nDuring dreams, connection to your voluntary muscles is disabled. However, the\nperson you are in your dream can move and it is as if then you can move your\nmuscles in your mind. - REM sleep, the stage of sleep during which dreaming occurs, is\ncharacterized by paralysis of the voluntary muscles. Why? The phenomenon is known\nas REM atonia and prevents you from acting out your dreams while you're asleep.\nBasically, because motor neurons are not stimulated, your body does not move.\nWhile dreams are often heavily influenced by our personal experiences, researchers\nhave found that certain themes are very common across different cultures. For\nexample, people from all over the world frequently dream about being chased, being\nattacked or falling.\nSo not only are dreams emotional, they also have a physical presence. - In your\ndreams you are really there and you can feel what is happening to you. That is why\ndreams of being chased, attacked or falling are fun, because you can 'feel' those\nsensations.\nSo in your dreams, not only are you using your imagination to run or move around,\nyou are using your imagination to create worlds to run and move around in.\nFurthermore, these generated worlds are mostly from life events that are easily\nrecalled in memory or simply more emotional.\nSo why does your mind make the dreams it makes? Does it select more emotional\nthings to dream about or things that are simply more fun to dream about? (Apparently\nit does both)\n2.Lassen et al. \"Brain Stimulation Reward is Integrated by a Network of Electrically Coupled GABA Neurons.\" Brain\nResearch. 2007 ; 46-58.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 63\nSo dreams are more emotional, and I think they also achieve stimulation from a more\nbasic, reward based brain chemistry. The nature of emotion is reward based and\nsimplistic, so it makes sense that dreams are that way since you aren't thinking.\n11.2 Images in Dreaming\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nHow does the mind construct images in dreams? What do dream images look like?\nThis is a much more complicated question than simply asking if someone dreams in\ncolor or black and white. The mind could reconstruct video - like if you watched a\nmovie clip and then your mind replayed it in your dream. But how would your mind\nreconstruct the movie clip? It would surely alter it in a way similar to how dreams are\ndifferent from ordinary experiences.\nFigure 11.1Loch Leven and Pap of Glencoe mountain By Mark Pettinelli\nThe above image represents what seems to me dream images are like. They are\ndulled down - since in dreams you are thinking less - but they are more emotionally\npotent. So the glowing colors make this image more emotional (similar to how gold is\nan emotional color), and they make it easy to see the image without thinking, as if\nseeing something glow in the dark.\nMy guess would be that when someone closes their eyes the patterns people can see\non their eyelids (kind of like glowing outlines of abstract objects) help them to go to\nsleep because they are similar to dream images - it is dark because your eyes are\nclosed and the faint lines or colors are very abstract so this low level of abstraction -\nsimilar to a dream - helps induce relaxation and sleep.\nDreaming and sleeping unlocks and uses the power of the unconscious mind.

How does self-help or\ntherapy work? Those two questions are similar because through many self-help or\ntherapy exercises someone gains a greater understanding of psychology. Therapy and\npsychology can help someone because they reflect more on their thoughts and their\nemotions and this helps to change them. There isn't any advanced psychology in non-\ncivilized populations (at least I don't think since they don't have any education system),\nhowever they also don't have the same mental health problems.\nBut psychological information can be used for self-improvement as well. I should say\nthat I am not a licensed psychologist, however I have a lot of knowledge and\nexperience related to this. Clearly people learn from thinking about their emotions.\nTherapy or self-help is a focus on things you find important, like your mental\ncondition. You could say that meditation works the same way - when you focus on\nyourself you can benefit.\nAttitudes can take a long time to change. Emotion is complicated and dynamic. If you\nthink about it, so is experience. But an attitude is simple - it is an attitude, everyone\nunderstands what an attitude is. It is a display of some bias or opinion about\nsomething. You have an attitude about something - you are displaying how you feel\nabout that thing. You feel strongly about something, that is an attitude.\nSo it would seem to me that things can go wrong mentally, resulting in a mental\nproblem, if the feelings you have toward certain things are too large. You could say\nthat the person has an 'attitude problem'. But attitudes are simple. How the mind\nfunctions is much more complex. But people don't care about how the mind\nfunctions, they only care about things that are important to them like attitudes.\nIt is like when someone has a psychological problem, their attitude is too large. This\nlarge attitude causes the emotions that the person is experiencing to go out of\nbalance. Emotions need to work properly, if you are feeling too strongly about one\nthing this could disrupt how you feel in general.\nSo the important question is - how could an understanding of psychology possibly\ndecrease a strong attitude? That doesn't seem to make any sense, it would seem like\nthe only way to decrease an attitude would be to show the person the opposite\nattitude, which isn't really that deep an understanding of psychology, it is just a basic\nsimple idea.\nSo then you could really call anyone that understands that 'exposure to the proper\ninfluence over time decreases dangerous attitudes and feelings' is a psychologist.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 12 66\nIs psychology really that simple though? I know that there are lots of subtleties, but\nwhat are these subtleties about? People can be nice or mean in the wrong way.\nDepending on the circumstances, there are many different ways that someone can\nact. Each different way of acting socially could be analyzed and the person could work\non that.\nIt seems simple when I say it that way, but that is basically what this is about. You go\nthrough an experience of practicing exposure to the proper behavior. You need to\nalso consider the reason the person developed the strong attitude in the first place as\nwell, however. The person probably wants that attitude to be strong, that is why he or\nshe developed it in the first place, you need to consider that the person doesn't want\nto change and likes being violent.\nI am not suggesting that everyone with a mental condition is violent. Maybe they are\nthe opposite, it is just more clear when I use violence as the example.\nThat is why I said before that the emotions need to be properly balanced - because\nsomething like someone getting too violent can throw how they feel out of function.\nBut surely there is an aspect of self-improvement that an understanding of psychology\ncan give you. It might help you understand emotion better. The question then is,\ncouldn't someone get an understanding of emotion naturally or by doing practically\nany type of other work?\nBy studying psychology you make your natural understanding of psychology more\nconscious. For instance you might notice to yourself certain points of observation\nwhen you are in the real world observing how emotion functions. You might be able to\ndescribe with words better the nature of emotion or an emotional response instead of\njust simply having a feeling for it.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 67\nChapter 13 Psychology for Self Help\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 People have a certain understanding of their own actions. This is true for specific,\nindividual actions where you can understand to different degrees what you are\ndoing and if you are conscious of what you are doing - and this is true with more\ncomplicated actions and behaviors (such as a behavior that you have to think\nabout or reflect on in order to understand what your action was.\n\u2022 People have various beliefs about themselves, about the world, about what they\nare doing in the present time. These beliefs can influence your actions at any\ntime. A certain belief can be brought up consciously (recalled or a new belief\ninitiated) or a belief could have an unconscious influence on what you are doing.\nFor instance a belief that you forgot you had or some bias you have.\n\u2022 There are only a few basic personality traits that people can have. There is their\nmoral disposition - if they are nice or mean. There is their energy level, their\nnervousness, their type of intellect or way of thinking. There is their social\ndispositions - extroverted, agreeable, etc.\n\u2022 You can try and measure emotions in social interactions. For instance the\nemotion of love might only be present between two people who are in love\noccasionally. You could also try to measure it over a longer period of time, and try\nto observe certain indicators that point to if that emotion is occurring.\n\u2022 Furthermore, in every social interaction there are going to be various emotions\ninteracting with each other. This is a part of the 'mood' or 'atmosphere'. For\ninstance there could be a humorous mood or a romantic mood, or maybe those\ntwo emotions/moods are interacting with each other during the interaction.\n\u2022 This brings up the point that there are various ways someone can be conscious of\ntheir emotions. Someone may have an emotion, but that doesn't mean that it is\neasy for them to feel or understand that it is occurring.\n\u2022 A mood or emotional state consists of a certain set of feelings (happy, sad,\nexciting, etc), in addition to having its own unique feeling.\n\u2022 Emotion can cloud intellect. The various ways of thinking can be related to\nsomeones social disposition (if they are an introvert or an extrovert). Jung\ndiscussed the introverted type of thinking - '\"this kind of thinking easily gets lost\nin the immense truth of the subjective factor... the extraordinary impoverishment\nof introverted thinking is compensated by a wealth of unconscious facts.\" (Carl\nJung, \"Psychological Types\".) He seemed to think that introverted thinking was\ndefective somehow, yet more internal and possibly deeper unconsciously.\n\u2022 Your thinking (conscious and unconscious) determines who you are and what you\nfeel.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 14 68\nChapter 14 Unconscious Thinking and\nFeeling - And Cognitive Behavioral\nTherapy\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psychotherapeutic approach that\naddresses dysfunctional emotions, behaviors, and cognitions through a goal-\noriented, systematic process. The name refers to behavior therapy, cognitive\ntherapy, and to therapy based upon a combination of basic behavioral and\ncognitive research.1\nA major aspect of CBT is to use an analysis of someones thoughts and feelings - how\ntheir feelings lead to thoughts and how their thoughts lead to feelings - as a way to\nhelp the person understand how they can change their thoughts and how this might\nhelp them change their feelings. Obviously they also analyze how thoughts and\nfeelings relate to behavior as well.\nBut how much of someones thinking is unconscious? Someone can have a thought\nthat they aren't aware of. They could have some belief, attitude, or thought process\nthat they aren't aware of. A belief is something you are thinking that isn't a fact - which\nwould be something you know to be true (or think you know to be true). So when I say\nthat you might have some belief you aren't aware of that means anything you think\nthat you aren't certain of. I would say that everything in the mind that you think is\neither a fact or a belief, or a more complicated thought that is more like a paragraph\nwhich would be describing something.\nSurely when you are interacting with someone there is potentially a lot of unconscious\nbeliefs and ideas you might form about the other person. You could be biased against\nthem and not know it very easily. In fact, there might be subtle shifts in how you are\nbiased against them many times during a conversation.\nBut is that what the unconscious is about - beliefs, facts, and ideas that you have that\nyou aren't aware of? Or is it about deep motivations and powerful emotions that are\ninfluencing your feelings, thoughts and behaviors?\nThere is a lot of mystery behind what is happening in your mind unconsciously. That is\nwhy it might take a lot of work thinking about your own thoughts and feelings in order\nto change them. If you have some strong attachment or drive that needs to be\nchanged - it is a powerful unconscious one, and you would need to do a lot of work\nover a long time in order to change how you feel.\nI am not a licensed psychologist, but it is obvious that certain behaviors or ways of\nbeing can only be changed over a long period of time.

People get used to acting a certain way and this can only\nbe changed by showing them or practicing new ways of acting. They have deep\nunconscious beliefs and attitudes that are strong and reflected in many aspects of\ntheir actions. Such complicated and subtle behavior cannot change instantly because\nit is too complicated to change instantly- if a behavior is complicated then it is going\nto take a long time to change because there are many things that need to be changed\nabout it.\nYou might not notice all of the things that change, however if you think about it an\nattitude is probably going to have many associated beliefs and unconscious drives\nthat need to be addressed. This is what experience is. It isn't simply that an attitude is\nlarge and needs to be decreased over time - there is also a learning process.\nWhat can be said about this? If a motivation is large, then why does it take so long to\nchange? It seems to me that if you describe the motivation as 'unconscious' it shows\nthat it is very large, because most of the mind is unconscious. What does the word\n'unconscious' bring up anyway? Is it merely a way of saying something is more\nsignificant than you would think because you aren't aware of its full impact?\nHuman beings aren't aware of a lot of things about themselves, that is why saying\n'unconsciously' brings up so much.

The ICS model is based on Barnard and\nTeasdale\u2019s theory that the mind has multiple modes that are responsible for receiving\nand processing new information cognitively and emotionally. Barnard and Teasdale\u2019s\n(1991) theory associates an individual\u2019s vulnerability to depression with the degree to\nwhich he/she relies on only one of the mode of mind, inadvertently blocking the other\nmodes. The two main modes of mind include the \u201cdoing\u201d mode and \u201cbeing\u201d mode. The\n\u201cdoing\u201d mode is also known as the driven mode. This mode is very goal-oriented and is\ntriggered when the mind develops a discrepancy between how things are versus how\nthe mind wishes things to be.1The second main mode of mind is the \u201cbeing\u201d mode.\n\u201cBeing\u201d mode, is not focused on achieving specific goals, instead the emphasis is on\n\u201caccepting and allowing what is,\u201d without any immediate pressure to change it. 2\nBased on Barnard and Teasdale\u2019s (1991) model, mental health is related to an\nindividual\u2019s ability to disengage from one mode or to easily move among the modes of\nmind. Therefore, individuals that are able to flexibly move between the modes of mind\nbased on the conditions in the environment are in the most favorable state. The ICS\nmodel theorizes that the \u201cbeing\u201d mode is the most likely mode of mind that will lead to\nlasting emotional changes. Therefore for prevention of relapse in depression,\ncognitive therapy must promote this mode. This led Teasdale to the creation of MBCT\n(Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy), which promotes the \u201cbeing\u201d mode. 3\nThe idea is that in the \"doing\" mode someone is trying to get to a better state.\nTherefore tension is caused and they are likely to spiral back downward into a\ndepression. If someone is in the \"being\" mode they let their negative thoughts flow\nand ignore the negative state. That way they can pass out of it easily.\nI this that this theory behind MBCT is very interesting in terms of how emotion and\ncognition interact. If you think about it, your emotional state of being upset about\nsomething is driving you to be in a state that is seeking out an answer. I think this\nmethod of therapy is basically just telling the person to say to themselves, \"its ok, i\ndon't need to react to my feeling upset, I can let this feeling and the unwelcome\nthoughts it generates or wants to generate pass\".\nBut is that the full mystery behind what is going on when your mind enters one of\nthese states? Each of these states is responsible for your way of thinking and feeling\n1.Segal, Z., Teasdale, J., Williams, M. (2002). Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression.

They can be in a mode where they just want sex, for example. Is this just a\ndifferent way of acting? It isn't. When someone is in a different mode, they want\nsomething, their feelings and their entire state is different, it is like they are a different\nperson (for example 'bitch' mode).\nSo I guess then a different mode could be characterized by what happens in this\nmode. There are thoughts and attitudes that are characteristic of each mode. It is\nalmost like a different personality, maybe sometimes someone acts nice, and in this\nmode they are really very different. But surely there are more modes than that.\nI would say that there is a mode where you expect pleasure from other people. There\nis a mode where you are abusive, etc. Your attitude can change in many ways, and, in\neach of these ways, you are really in a different \"mode\" or are a slightly different\nperson.\nThis is really a social thing then - you can be in a nice or mean mode, a mode where\nyou are getting along with the people around you in a certain way. When someone is\nin the 'driven' mode of MBCT the person wants to satisfy whatever it is they are upset\nabout. My point is that is just one mode of many different modes that a person can\nenter. People want satisfaction in other ways, maybe it is just in this mode that you\nare in a more extreme state such that it is directing your thoughts and feelings it is so\npowerful.\nEmotion is powerful - these 'modes' are so powerful that they direct and influence\nyour thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Emotion causes people to do things they didn't\nthink about all of the time. Emotion itself communicates information - if you are in this\nemotional state, you are being informed by your emotions that you feel that way, so\nyou might learn why you might be feeling that way.\nYou could say that the unique feeling of each emotion communicates a unique\nunderstanding. Some emotions are so strong they make you go crazy and you really\nare in a different mode. I think this shows how emotion influences your thinking.\nPeople are motivated by their emotions, they think differently because in these\nmodes, when they are experiencing different emotions, they want different different\nthings, their desires and preferences are different for that short, emotional, possibly\nmoody time period.\nSo in the \"being\" mode it is like you are just being, and letting the emotional power\nflow through you instead of having it control you and influence your thoughts and\nfeelings and behaviors. You are not driven, you are simply being.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 16 72\nChapter 16 What is Thinking - or as\nScientists name it - 'Cognition'?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 In science, cognition is a group of mental processes that includes attention,\nmemory, producing and understanding language, solving problems, and making\ndecisions. Cognition is studied in various disciplines such as psychology,\nphilosophy, linguistics, science and computer science. The term's usage varies in\ndifferent disciplines; for example in psychology and cognitive science, it usually\nrefers to an information processing view of an individual's psychological\nfunctions. It is also used in a branch of social psychology called social cognition to\nexplain attitudes, attribution, and groups dynamics.1\nThere are various things people can do mentally that have been labeled as aspects of\ncognition such as processes like memory, association, concept formation, pattern\nrecognition, language, attention, perception, action, problem solving and mental\nimagery. Traditionally, emotion was not thought of as a cognitive process.\nMost of those seem obvious - it is clear how memory functions, you simply bring up a\nmemory. Well, you might need to be in the right emotional state in order to bring up\nthe proper memory. Sometimes certain memories are easier to recall than at other\ntimes, this is probably because you were thinking of closely associated things that\nhelped you to recall the similar memory. Sometimes people might need to spend\nsome time trying to pull up a memory.\nActually, now that I think about it, you could probably go into great detail describing\nhow memory functions - however on the surface and for the most part it is simple and\neasily understood. People use their memories all of the time, so in a way everyone\nunderstands how memory works.\nHowever, when you think anything aspects of memory are probably used because it is\nrelated to what you did earlier that day. When you say 'hi' to someone, or do anything\nreally, you use your memory to compare that event to previous events in your life or\nearlier that day. Your mind is like a computer, there are lots of things it is comparing\nand contrasting all of the time.\nHow does this process work? It probably works emotionally as well as intellectually.\nYour emotions help you bring up other similarly emotional memories and associated\nthoughts. Each emotion means something - it has a symbolic representation like\nsaying hi brings up the emotion for people or the idea you have of people in your\nmind.\nBut the interesting thing is how memory or thought relates to mental imagery. I said\nthat emotion can be used to compare different thoughts and memories, but is mental\nimagery also involved there? There are going to be mental images associated with\nmemories, thoughts and emotions. Therefore your mind is really comparing and\n1.Retrieved from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition 9/8/2012\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 73\ncontrasting lots of different thoughts, sensations, images, memories, and feelings all\nof the time.\nAn image means something. This is obvious if you think about art. People can 'think'\nvisually basically. People can also think with their emotions, as it is clear that emotion\ncan be informative. A thought could be of an event, a memory, a group of related\nideas, a group of not related ideas, an emotion. How could a thought be of an\nemotion? All emotions mean something, a thought that is of an emotion is just then\nan emotion with special significance that you have drawn more attention to in the\nform of a thought.\nSo a conscious thought is something that is clear to you. An unconscious thought is\nsomething that simply means something to you - it could be anything really. Anything\nthat communicates information to your mind. Thought is really then informative, and\nthe function of emotion then is simply to experience feeling.\nBut what kinds of information does thought communicate? It can communicate visual\ninformation, mathematical information, emotional information, various ideas and\nconcepts, sensations, experiences, physical feelings and actions, mental feelings and\nactions, sounds - everything there is in existence that your mind can understand.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 17 74\nChapter 17 Some Points on Emotion\nTheory\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\n\u2022 There are two types of observations in emotion theory, one type is general\ncommon observations (such as sex is good for someones emotional health) and\nthe other type is functional observations (when an emotion stops at one second\nand another one takes its place, what is happening there, what are the emotions,\nwhy do they stop and start, etc (for example, if someone thinks a happy thought it\nmight stop the negative thought completely) also, what are the degrees to which\nthe emotion or thought is felt, is it completely gone etc.\n\u2022 Emotions stop and start all the time, this stopping and starting might occur as\nsudden transitions or slow transitions, one emotion gradually fading into the\nother. That is not a complete explanation for how emotion functions, however.\nHumans would probably have several emotions occurring at one time, each\nemotion interacting with one or more other emotions and potentially causing\nthem to stop, start, fade or increase.\n\u2022 For instance, the emotions hate, love, painful emotions, sexual emotions, hopeful\nemotions, and humorous emotions are probably all constantly interacting with\neach other and being felt to some degree all the time. Those are only a few of the\nemotions/feelings that are probably felt a lot everyday.\n\u2022 There are going to be observable patterns that occur with those emotions, for\ninstance pleasure might relieve pain and make painful feeling go away.\n\u2022 Life is intense and ongoing, so therefore intense emotion is probably maintained\nin humans all the time. These emotions might stop and start, someone could go\nfrom brief periods of intensity to periods of low intensity, but the point is there is\nthat intensity that is felt and the continuous flow of emotional processing is\nongoing.\n\u2022 There are different emotional states that can change your outlook on life or how\nyou might respond to a situation. Fear, anger, kindness and admiration are all\nemotional states that change how you might respond to events. You can also be\nin a state of readiness for certain emotions, you could be prepared to experience\npain or pleasure or be in one of those states.\n\u2022 Emotions are experienced consciously and unconsciously, the extent to which\nsomeone clearly feels an emotion is the extent to which it is conscious. If an\nemotion is being experienced but isn't under the awareness of the person\nexperiencing it, by definition it is mostly an unconscious emotion because they\nare not conscious of it. Someone can experience a large emotion but that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that the emotion is going to be completely under the awareness\nof the person experiencing it. They might describe the emotion as feeling like it is\nvery large, but they might not be in touch with it (making it mostly unconscious). It\nis in this world of \"seemingly larger emotions\" that emotional processing takes\nplace. Unconsciously there are many more emotions experienced than you are\ncompletely aware of that are being experienced. Therefor it is there, in the\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 75\nunconscious mind, that emotions interact in great depth and complexity, barely\nbeing felt consciously at times and with the person possibly only slightly aware\nthat something emotional might be going on (unconsciously).\n\u2022 Emotion is experienced differently for each person. An emotion evokes a certain\nemotional response in a person because that person is who they are, however we\nall share the same world and there are going to be significant psychological things\nin it that are generally considered to be significant by most people, such as death\nor love. Any individual has peculiarities and specifics about what might trigger a\nlarge emotional response, it wouldn't necessarily just be something that they \"like\na lot\" but mostly things they consciously or unconsciously find to be significant.\n\u2022 When emotion can stop and start, and there can be periods of intensity and low-\nintensity, it makes one wonder just how many different emotional states there\nare. For every mood in a social situation you could say is an emotional state. If\nthere is a certain mood present, then the people are going to be feeling certain\nthings and responding in a way that is correspondent to that mood. But that is\njust social moods, there are many other ways people's emotional state can\nchange, if you are working on something you enjoy working on you could be in a\ncertain emotional state for that.\n\u2022 An emotional state implies a certain set of feelings that come up with a certain\nactivity or under certain circumstances.\n\u2022 An important observation to note in emotion theory is that pain can stop the\ncurrent flow of emotion or feeling and alert the person. Pain and anxiety are\ndifferent from the other emotions because they are unpleasant. How often is an\nemotion like hope or fun tainted by the emotion of pain? Is fun even an emotion\nor is it an emotional state? Fun would imply that you are experiencing a set of\nemotions that makes that circumstance fun, joy is an emotion, \"fun\" is more of an\nemotional state.\n\u2022 The flow of someone's feelings can stop suddenly, for instance, say you are\nrelaxing in bed after waking up, then your alarm clock goes off - you went from\nfeeling happy, relaxed emotions to those suddenly ending. Emotions and feelings\nstop and start like this all the time. In a conversation, for example, someone could\nbe happy and the other person could show or adopt a negative expression and\nthat could suddenly end the other persons happiness. There are many emotions\nsomeone could adopt in a conversation such as shyness, or an emotion\nexpressing a thought or an idea, and these emotions could influence (or start and\nstop) emotions that the other person is experiencing. It should be clear that the\nmany emotions someone experiences throughout the day changes all the time,\nstops, starts, transitions, and changes in complicated ways all the time. These\nchanges may or may not be observed, however if you pay attention to these\nfeelings and their behavior you could certainly notice a lot more.\n\u2022 Emotion can motivate thought. People go into different states or 'modes' where\nthey are driven to think a certain type of thought or do a certain type of behavior.\nWhen someone enters a different mode, such as a pleasure seeking mode, that\nmode in particular is motivated by emotion. It is clear that with pleasure someone\nis feeling more, so you would say that it is motivated by emotion. However, every\nstate someone is in, every different subtle social emotional state or emotional\nstate when someone is doing work is going to have some emotion or set of\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 17 76\nfeelings behind it. But it isn't just a set of feelings, the feeling is unique each time,\nand this uniqueness communicates certain information that is also unique. The\nfeeling tells you what you like and what you don't like, that would probably be the\nprimary emotions (pleasure and pain). But each other emotion communicates\nsomething - if you feel guilty you know what that feeling means, maybe that\nfeeling in combination with other feelings is communicating something different\nor unique based upon the set of feelings it is and what it means in that context.\n\u2022 Therefore someone could enter into a mode such as an abusive mode, where,\nemotionally, they are being abusive. It makes sense that since this is a mode, it\ntakes a reasonable period of time to experience. It isn't an expression or a\ngesture, which takes a couple of seconds, but a mode like this my guess would be\nat least a few minutes long. Another mode could be a humorous mode. Maybe\nthat is clear by the person being observed as being amused - but maybe\nemotionally they are amused for a certain period of time before and after your\nobservation of them being that way.\n\u2022 That isn't to say that someone couldn't experience amused feelings for a few\nseconds. Clearly when someone laughs the feelings mostly only last for the\nperiod of the laughter. But they would probably still be amused for a period\nafterwards. You just laughed - and you become happy or amused for a short\nperiod after that. My point about the modes is that there are certain powerful\nsets of feelings that last for a while - like a pleasure seeking set of feelings. That is\ndifferent from laughter or amusement, this is a strong specific mode that brings\nup a set of feelings for someone. Maybe someone else has a different sort of\nmode - maybe they have a strong mode where they feel guilty, and they have a\nunique set of feelings and thoughts that are with this mode.\n\u2022 Some of these modes might be a reflective mode, where you are in period that is\nreminiscent of the activity you were just doing. Other modes might be powerful\nones, abusive ones, submissive or dominant ones, calm ones. It is as if someone\ngets in a 'mood' for these modes. Moods are more quiet however, and there are\nonly a few moods that people recognize. However, there could be many different\nunique moods as well. What then is the difference between a mood and a mode?\nIn a mood you have different emotions, maybe someone gets in an abusive\nmood. That would be like getting in an abusive mode. I think it is just a matter of\nhow strong the mood or mode is. Moods are probably less strong than modes,\nand modes are also ways of acting, not just ways of feeling. In a mode the\nemotions are so strong that they influence your behavior - the emotion motivates\nthought.\n\u2022 One emotion can lead or transition into another emotion. For instance, someone\ncan rage, then become angry instead of being in a rage over a certain thing, and\nthen the emotion could die to down to the person just being hateful at whatever\nthe cause is. That is similar to if someone is punched, they might be at first angry,\nthen upset, and then depressed or sad. Anger can lead to hate, or 'being upset' -\nand then after that the emotion might transition into sadness or whatever might\nfollow someone being hateful. Maybe the lesser emotion of hate is bitterness. So\nthey would go from being hateful to being bitter. Or maybe if someone is talking\nto them positively, they could go from being hateful to being happy or optimistic.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 77\n17.1 An explanation for this chapter:\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nAn emotional state is a very complicated thing.

Feelings are more like sensations,\nwhen you touch something you get a feeling. Therefore feelings are faster than\nemotions and thought, because when you touch something there is a slight delay\nbefore you can think of something about it (thought), or feel something deeply about\nit (emotion). Emotion is therefore just unconscious thought. Actually it would better be\ndescribed as unconscious feeling (so a feeling is like a conscious emotion because you\ncan \"feel\" it better and easier but emotion is a deeper, more unconscious experience\nsimilar to unconscious thought, but emotions are also more similar to conscious\nthought because thought is a deep experience while feelings are intense or shallow,\nbut not deep).\nOne definition of emotion can be \"any strong feeling\". From that description many\nconclusions can be drawn. Basic (or primary) emotions can be made up of secondary\nemotions like love can contain feelings or emotions of lust, love and longing. Feelings\ncan be described in more detail than emotions because you can have a specific feeling\nfor anything, each feeling is unique and might not have a name. For instance, if you\nare upset by one person that might have its own feeling because that person upsets\nyou in a certain way. That feeling doesn't have a defined name because it is your\npersonal feeling. The feeling may also be an emotion, say anger. \"Upset\" is probably\ntoo weak to be an emotion, but that doesn't mean that it isn't strong like emotions are\nstrong in certain ways. Cold is also just a feeling. There is a large overlap between how\nfeelings feel and how emotions feel, they are similar in nature. So there are only a few\ndefined emotions, but there are an infinite number ways of feeling things. You can\nhave a \"small\" emotion of hate and you could say that you have the feeling hate then,\nif it is large you could say you are being emotional about hate, or are experiencing the\nemotion hate. You can have the same emotion of hate in different situations, but each\ntime the feeling is going to be at least slightly different.\nYou can recognize any feeling, that is what makes it a feeling. If you are sad that is a\nfeeling, but if you are depressed that isn\u2019t a feeling it is more like an emotion. You can\u2019t\nidentify why you are depressed but you can usually identify why you are sad. Feelings\nare more immediate, if something happens or is happening, it is going to result in a\nfeeling. However, if something happened a long time ago, you are going to think about\nit unconsciously and that is going to bring up unconscious feelings. Otherwise known\nas emotion. So emotions are unconscious feelings that are the result of unconscious\nthoughts. Feeling defined there as something you can identify. So you can\u2019t identify\nthe unconscious thought that caused the unconscious feeling, but you can identify the\nunconscious feeling (aka emotion).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 19 80\nAnother aspect of unconscious thought, emotion, or unconscious feeling (all three are\nthe same) is that it tends to be mixed into the rest of your system because it is\nunconscious. If it was conscious then it remains as an individual feeling, but in its\nunconscious form you confuse it with the other emotions and feelings and it affects\nyour entire system. So therefore most of what people are feeling is just a mix of\nfeelings that your mind cannot separate out individually. That is the difference\nbetween sadness and a depression, a depression lowers your mood and affects all\nyour feelings and emotions, but sadness is just that individual feeling. So the reason\nthat the depression affects all your other feelings is because you can no longer\nrecognize the individual sad emotions that caused it. The feelings become mixed. If\nsomeone can identify the reason they are sad then they become no longer depressed,\njust sad. Once they forget that that was the reason they are depressed however, they\nwill become depressed again.\nThat is why an initial event might make someone sad, and then that sadness would\nlater lead into a depression, is because you forget why you originally got sad. You\nmight not consciously forget, but unconsciously you do. That is, it feels like you forget,\nthe desire to get revenge on whatever caused the sadness fades away. When that\nhappens it is like you \u201cforgetting\u201d what caused it. You may also consciously forget but\nwhat matters is how much you care about that sadness. It might be that consciously\nunderstanding why you are depressed or sad changes how much you care about your\nsadness, however. That would therefore change the emotion/feeling of sadness. The\nmore you care about the sadness/ depression, the more like a feeling it becomes and\nless like an emotion. That is because the difference between feelings and emotions is\nthat feelings are easier to identify (because you can \u201cfeel\u201d them easier).\nThe following is a good example of the transition from caring about a feeling to not\ncaring about a feeling. Anger as an emotion takes more energy to maintain, so if\nsomeone is punched or something, they are only likely to be mad for a brief period of\ntime, but the sadness that it incurred might last for a much longer time. That sadness\nis only going to be recognizable to the person punched for a brief period of time as\nattributable to the person who did the punching, after that the sadness would sink\ninto their system like a miniature depression. Affecting the other parts of their system\nlike a depression.\nIn review, both feelings and emotions are composed of unconscious thoughts, but\nfeelings are easier to identify than emotions. Feelings are faster than emotions in\nterms of response (the response time of the feeling, how fast it responds to real world\nstimulation) and it takes someone less time to recognize feelings because they are\nfaster. Feelings are closer to sensory stimulation, if you touch something, you feel it\nand that is a fast reaction. You care about the feeling so you can separate it out in\nyour head from the other feelings. \u201cYou care\u201d in that sentence could be translated\ninto, the feeling is intense, so you feel it and can identify it easily. That is different from\nconsciously understanding why you are depressed or sad. You can consciously\nunderstand why you are depressed or sad, but that might or might not affect the\nintensity of that sadness.\nIf the intensity of the sadness is brought up enough, then you can feel that sadness\nand it isn\u2019t like a depression anymore, it is more like an individual feeling then\nsomething that affects your mood and brings your system down (aka a depression).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 81\nAlso, if you clearly enough understand what the sadness is then it is going to remain a\nsadness and not affect the rest of your system. That is because the feeling would get\nmixed in with the other feelings and start affecting them. The period of this more clear\nunderstanding of the sadness mostly occurs right after the event that caused the\nsadness. That is because it is clear to you what it is. Afterwards the sadness might\nemerge (or translate from a depression, to sadness) occasionally if you think about\nwhat caused it or just think about it in general.\nThe difference between emotion and feeling is that feelings are easier to identify\nbecause they are faster, a feeling is something you are feeling right then. An emotion\nmight be a deeper experience because it might affect more of you, but that is only\nbecause it is mixed into the rest of your system. That is, a depression affects more of\nyou than just an isolated feeling of sadness. In other words, people can only have a\nfew feelings at a time, but they can have many emotions at the same time. Emotions\nare mixed in, but to feel something you have to be able to identify what it is, or it is\ngoing to be so intense that you would be able to identify what it is. Emotions just feel\ndeeper because it is all your feelings being affected at once.\nSince emotion is all your feelings being affected at once, emotions are stronger than\nfeelings. Feelings however are a more directed focus. When you feel something you\ncan always identify what that one thing is. When you have an emotion, the emotion is\nmore distant, but stronger. All your feelings must feel a certain way about whatever is\ncausing the emotion. So that one thing is affecting your entire system. Feelings can\nthen be defined as immediate unconscious thought, and emotions as unconscious\nthought.\n\u2022 When you care about an emotion, you could say that you have a higher attention\nfor emotion or that emotional event during that time. You are probably going to\nbe in a higher state of action readiness, that is, you are probably more alert and\ngoing to be able to respond faster to whatever it is you are focusing on, or just\nrespond faster in general. You also are going to have a better understanding of\nthe emotion if you care about it more - you make an assessment of the emotions\nstrength and its nature when you think about the emotion (or the event that\ngenerated the emotion).\n\u2022 Feelings are more direct than emotions and thought because they are more\nsensory \u2013 when you touch something you get a feeling. That shows further how\nemotions are really about things in the real world, only it more like you are\nthinking about them instead of feeling them in real time. Things that come from\nmemory are going to be emotions and/or thoughts, not feelings because feelings\nare things which are more tangible, those memories might result in new feelings,\nbut the memories themselves are not feelings because they are just thoughts.\nThat shows how you can feel some things more than others, that thought and\nfeeling are indeed separate and intelligence is sometimes driven by feelings and\nemotions, and sometimes it isn\u2019t. You can think about things and not have\nfeelings guiding those thoughts Or your feelings could be assisting your thoughts.\n\u2022 If you care about a feeling then it becomes easier to identify it \u2013 that shows how\nyour feelings can help you to identify other feelings, so your emotions contribute\nto your emotional intelligence.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 19 82\n\u2022 If a certain emotion is larger than others then to your intellect it is going to be\neasier to recognize, and easier to think about (that is why a depression feels like it\ndoes, because you don\u2019t know the individual emotions contributing to it so you\ncannot feel a specific emotion of sadness from it.\nAn explanation for this chapter:\nSo feelings are easier to \"feel\" than emotions, that is probably why they are called\nfeelings, because you \"feel\" them better. Maybe someone else thinks you can feel\nemotions easier, I don't know, the point is you can feel emotions and feelings with\ndifferent levels of intensity and in more than one way, a feeling could be not intense\nbut clear to you. So how conscious you are of the feeling or emotion influences the\nintensity of it and your conscious experience of it. A feeling could be more intense\nthan an emotion if it is the only thing you are feeling as well. That makes sense, if an\nemotion is very complicated, then you probably couldn't feel the entire thing as clearly\nin a brief period of time. So my theory is that feelings are more simple, and therefore\nthere are more shallow but possibly more intense than emotion because you can\nfocus on a simple thing easier.\nIf you are having a deep emotional experience (experiencing an emotion) then it\nmakes sense that you aren't as in touch with all of those feelings that are occurring.\nWhen you touch something you get the feeling \"cold\" - that is simple to understand.\nWhen you are in a depression you don't understand all the complicated emotions that\nyou are experiencing. You could experience sadness all day. When you can say \"oh, I\nreally \"felt\" that\", then you know you feel it and it is a feeling. When you feel\nsomething, it is a feeling. When you are emotional about something, those are feelings\ntoo, but it is more powerful and deeper, you aren't as in touch will all of it because it is\nmore complex. You could be in touch with something complex and feel that too, I\nguess. Though I would argue that a feeling is easier to focus on if it is simple and clear\nto understand and feel to your conscious mind.\nThe significance of this chapter:\nIf someone is emotional, then they are feeling a lot. I could say that the emotions\nsomeone is experiencing could be brought up at different times and felt more -\ntranslated from somewhere in your strong emotions to something you feel more\nclosely. So you can feel some things but that doesn't mean that the feeling is intense\nor clear - those things might become clear however at some point.\nWhen those emotions become clear and you 'bring them up' - either by caring about\nthe emotion or the thought that represents it or it just emerges by some other\nmethod (such as by doing an evaluation of your emotional state) - then they become\nfeelings because you can feel them easier. These feelings are more clear, similar to\nwhen you touch something you get a feeling that is simple and tactile. That is why\nfeelings are called the result of emotions, because emotions are like the basis for\nfeelings (at least non-tactile ones). You might have a feeling that has a shallow source\nhowever as well I would say. It doesn't have to be that a feeling is first felt deeply, and\nthen you feel it more clearly later on (the feeling being the result of an emotion).\nMaybe the feeling is simple at first and then it becomes more complex later.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 83\nWhat role does attention have to play? Being emotional or feeling something can\nmake you pay more or less attention to things, including other feelings. Your attention\ncan naturally rise just because of your emotional state.\nPeople feel emotions, and they can feel feelings. Emotions are strong and the\npowerful source of human behavior, and while feelings are also powerful they are also\ndiverse, curious, and unique - 'old feelings returning'.\n19.1 How to Change Emotions and Feelings\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nAn appraisal is when you assess something. People make appraisals or assessments\nof emotion all of the time, however they aren't aware most of the time that they are\ndoing this. How much someone cares about an emotional stimulus is something that\nis probably thought about frequently during the experience. If you think about it\npeople frequently are going to naturally analyze what is going on in every situation\nthey are in and think about what the emotions occurring are.\nI said in the previous paragraph that people make appraisals of emotional things but\nthey aren't aware of themselves doing that. How is that possible or what does that\nmean exactly? If people care about emotion, which they clearly do, then they are going\nto want to know what is going on in the situations they encounter in life. So clearly\npeople make assessments of how much emotion the things around them are\ngenerating, the only question is can they do this in a way that is beneath their\nawareness.\nPeople surely must make assessments since they often work on inducing or inhibiting\nfeelings in order to make them \"appropriate\" to a situation. If you are going to be\nchanging feeling, then obviously you are going to need to measure and assess it first.\nSometimes people think this process through consciously, and sometimes they don't.\nIt makes sense to me that people are going to \"know\" how valuable certain things in\ntheir environment are. This is clear when you realize that people focus on some things\nvery quickly - such a thing would clearly be something of interest to that person or\nsomething that generates emotion - which would make it interesting.\nSo you could say that a person whose attention gets alerted to something around\nthem made an assessment about the stimulus or responded to it, the stimulus (the\nthing in their environment they paid sharp attention to) was clearly emotional for\nthem. It could have generated any feeling - disgust, surprise, happiness, - or maybe an\nintellectual reaction such as 'that person has a bright coat'.\nDoes that mean that the person assessed if the bright coat generated emotion for\nthem? What would it mean if it generated emotion? Could they respond in a fast way\nwithout being interested? Someone could respond quickly to something and not be in\na mood that is very caring at that time, in which case maybe little emotion was\ninvolved. However if someone was interested in something then it makes sense that it\nis going to cause them to have feelings.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 19 84\nIs something someone is interested in going to cause them to have deep emotions or\nshallow feelings? What types of stimuli result in deep or shallow feelings? Just because\nsomething generates more emotion for you doesn't necessarily mean that it is going\nto cause you to respond to it faster or you would be more interested in it. Maybe your\ninterest is more intellectual or maybe you are interested or responding to it quickly\nbecause you have to.\nUnder what circumstances do people care more about feelings? This relates to\nappraisals - if you care about something then you are going to make more\nassessments during the experience about how much emotion is being generated\nprobably. People can care more about feelings but that doesn't mean that they are\naware that they care more during that time. This is similar to people going into modes\nwhere they are seeking pleasure. My theory here is that people have levels of desire\nand need that fluctuate constantly.\nThis means that there are many different levels someone can experience an emotion\nor feeling. It is more complicated than simply saying that the feeling has a certain\nstrength - each feeling or emotion is going to have a unique nature, represent unique\nideas and objects, and have a unique significance on your psyche.\nMaybe you can say that there are shallow feelings and deep emotions, and that there\nare certain properties that shallow feelings have and certain properties that deep\nfeelings have. For instance you probably care more about deep feelings (unless the\nfeeling is negative) and therefore they probably cause you to have a faster reaction\ntime. However if the feeling is deep, sappy, and emotional then maybe your reaction\ntime is slower because the emotion is weighing you down.\nThis relates to the 'emotions and feelings and the difference between them' section\nabove because I am outlining further that deep feelings/emotions or shallow feelings/\nemotions are different and things happen to humans differently with each one. It\nshows that clearly emotion can make someone be different physically, as when you\nare motivated by emotion you often move faster.\nThis is just bringing up ideas of depth - some feelings are simple and some are\ncomplex - that is obvious, however I think people could notice a lot more if they\ngrouped their emotions into a categories of strength and shallowness or depth and\nhow they responded differently to each different category. - Also the person should\nnote what the interest was, the reaction time, the negative or positive valence of the\nemotion.\nGoffman suggests that we spend a good deal of effort on managing impressions - that\nis, acting. Your impression of other people makes you feel in different ways, and you\ntry to manage this in a social situation. So therefore all of your strong feelings you try\nto influence by thinking about what caused those feelings - such as your impressions -\nand how you can change them.\nSo people are basically \"emotion-managers\", constantly thinking about their feelings\nand what caused them and how they can change them. Whenever you change an\nimpression of someone, you are also changing your feelings. When you think about\nyour own feelings you are changing them because you are changing how much you\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 85\ncare about them. You set goals for yourself about your own feelings - 'if I do this I am\ngoing to become happy'.\nWhen you think about your feelings you can make insignificant feelings large or large\nfeelings small. When a feeling is small, you could say that it is more unconscious or\nbeneath your awareness. Something (including yourself) could trigger this small\nfeeling and it could emerge into something you feel more closely and more\nconsciously.\nSo the question is, what circumstances and what type of thinking warrant that feeling\nof 'that sort'.\nWe assess the 'appropriateness' of a feeling by making a comparison between the\nfeeling and the situation. We also have goals for how we want to feel that we don't\nknow we are thinking, and we have goals for how we want to act as well. Is there a\n'natural attitude' or a natural way of behaving and thinking? Not really - especially\nwhen you consider that you are unconsciously constantly creating goals, drives,\nthoughts and behaviors that are not fully under your control.\n\u2022 Insecondaryreactiveemotions, the person reacts against his or her initial primary\nadaptive emotion, so that it is replaced with a secondary emotion. This \"reaction\nto the reaction\" obscures or transforms the original emotion and leads to actions\nthat are not entirely appropriate to the current situation. For example, a man that\nencounters danger and begins to feel fear may feel that fear is not \"manly.\" He\nmay then either become angry at the danger (externally focused reaction) or\nangry with himself for being afraid (self-focused reaction), even when the angry\nbehavior actually increases the danger. Listening to this reaction, someone is\nlikely to have the sense that \"something else is going on here\" or \"there's more to\nthis than just anger.\" The experience is something like hearing two different\nmelodies being played at the same time in a piece of music, one the main melody\nand the other the background or counterpart.\n\u2022 Secondary emotions often arise from attempts to judge and control primary\nresponses.\n\u2022 Thus, anxiety may come from trying to avoid feeling angry or sexually excited, or\nit may arise from guilt about having felt these emotions.\nWhen someone rejects what they are truly feeling, they are likely to feel bad about\nthemselves. Feeling or expressing one emotion to mask the primary emotion is a\nmetaemotional process. Feelings about emotions need to be acknowledged and then\nexplored to get at the underlying primary emotion.\nExperiential therapists see clients emotional processing as occurring on a continuum\nwith five phases (Kennedy-Moore + Watson, 19991):\n1. prereflective reaction to an emotion-eliciting stimulus entailing perception of the\nstimulus, preconscious cognitive and emotional processing, and accompanying\nphysiological changes\n2. conscious awareness and perception of the reaction\n1.Kennedy-Moore, E., + Watson, J.C.

It is a baseline\nemotion of great importance - the action tendency of interest involves intending,\norienting, and exploring. Interest is felt very frequently, probably without being\nnoticed. If you think about it, to some degree interest is going to be present with each\nreaction to stimuli. With every response someone has, they are interested to some\ndegree. You can look at interest further when you consider secondary emotional\nresponses - what was the interest that came from the response that had some other\ntype of interest?\nThrough each stage of evaluation of a response, or simple evaluations that aren't a\nresponse to things, there is interest involved as well. This 'interest' induces caring, and\nthe interest and caring is going to change your emotions - emotions are going to be\nbrought up, intensified, changed based off of your interest or caring or evaluations.\nWhen you think and make evaluations, you change the nature and intensity of the\nemotions that are related to what you are doing or processing.\nAre people going to be more interested in clear, primary emotions or feelings that\nthey aren't in touch with? When someone is interested in a feeling, how is that\ndifferent from being interested in the source of the feeling? If someone is feeling sad,\nthey might not care about the sadness if the feeling is unclear to them or they don't\nknow they are sad. If someone is going to try to change a feeling of sadness, it clearly\nwould be beneficial if they knew when the feeling is occurring.\nIs it possible to experience deep emotions without being aware at all that these\nemotions are occurring? Yes it is, but there are times when people are conscious of\nthose emotions - say when they are recalling them - that the deep emotions are more\nclear. There could be a deep emotion that occurs over a long period of time - say\nanger at someone, this anger could be in your body for a long time, during being the\nperson, or while away from the person; the point is the anger is reflected upon or it\noccurs more deeply at certain points - and then you are going to be aware of the\nemotion.\nThat anger is a significant, primary feeling. The feeling is significant because it shows\nhow large the emotion is that is behind it. People can feel feelings that are shallow or\nintense at the time, but these feelings don't necessarily mean more than that or are\ndeeper than that because they aren't deep or primary - they don't mean anything else\nor occur at other times you aren't aware of (indicating that this feeling is significant).\nThe feeling of shallow feelings is still potent (because you are feeling them in real\ntime), but they aren't as powerful as feelings that have a special meaning or\nsignificance for you (which would make you feel deeper in real time and feel more\neffected).\nIf you think about it, people change their feelings by thinking all of the time. The way\nthey could help manage this is probably by making assessments of their emotional\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 87\nstate. If people think about what just made them happy or sad, then they might be\nable to do something or think something to change that. Some emotional responses\nare going to be more noticeable, and that is when people might try to figure out what\nwent on.\nThere are subtleties of emotion as well. People probably respond in many ways that\nthey aren't aware of consciously, but they might have responded because something\nbeneath their notice occurred emotionally. You could say that the emotional world\nbeneath your notice is the \"unconscious\" mind or the unconscious world.\nYour emotions change all of the time, only sometimes are you going to notice when an\nemotion changes or when you are experiencing one. Furthermore, you might want or\nexpect to experience one emotion but you are actually experiencing a different one\nbecause unconsciously that is how you are responding. For instance, maybe you have\nan unconscious bias against a group of people so you feel hate when you interact with\nthem, but you consciously think that you like those people and feel like you should be\nhappy and positive towards them. A feeling might be important to your unconscious\nmind, or a feeling might be important to your conscious mind - in which case you\nwould probably 'care' about it.\nYour attention is constantly divided between various things in your environment, your\nown internal thinking and your own emotions. Your emotions are going to determine\nand assist what you pay attention to. For instance, if something is emotional in your\nenvironment for you, then more of your attention is probably going to spent thinking\nabout or focusing on that thing.\nOr maybe something in your environment is just more interesting than something\nelse, the point is something in your environment or something in your head\n(emotions, thoughts) caused an intellectual or emotional reaction in you, and that\nthen caused you to pay more attention to it. That doesn't mean that you notice it\nmore after you pay attention - this type of paying attention might be unconscious - i.e.\n- more of your attentional resources or just more of the focus that people have (not all\nof which they are aware of) is going to be directed at it.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 20 88\nChapter 20 What is Reasoning Ability?\n- A Subjective Article Relevant to the\nstudy of Cognition and Emotion\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nIs reasoning ability emotional intelligence, or is it mathematical intelligence?

For each topic, category, job, etc in life\nthere is a different type of intellect or way of analyzing the material for that subject. Is\nthere a generic 'reasoning' ability that applies to all of these categories or does one\nneed to be defined?\nIntelligence is very subjective, so it is hard to define emotional intelligence. However, I\npersonally have found useful various tools that help my thinking:\n\u2022 Categorize the information and make lists outlining the significant phenomena.\n\u2022 That means that if you are thinking about something emotional, what the\nsignificant phenomena are is going to be subjective, it might be useful to make\ntwo lists, a list with the significant subjective factors and a list with the significant\nobjective factors.\n\u2022 Then you can analyze the information and say, \u2018well that is pretty subjective, I\ndon\u2019t know if that is true, however if I consider this and that objective factors I\nrealize that this and that subjective factors are more like x\u2019.\nHow could someone figure out how subjective vs. objective something is? Facts are\ntheoretically objective if it is a concrete fact that isn't, well, subjective. That is what\nsubjective means by definition - something that is subject to opinion.\nSo therapy is subjective. When a psychologist assesses that someone has a problem,\nthat is subjective. How is someone supposed to know if they are overly emotional in a\ncertain way. Bipolar is a mental condition. If someone is bipolar they experience\nemotional swings from extremely happy to extremely sad. Does that mean that\nsubjectivity is just about someones ability to measure emotion?\nWhen someone says, 'this soda tastes good' you are measuring how much emotion\ndrinking the soda causes you. That shows that a lot of the things that people say are\nsubjective.\nSo subjectivity and objectivity relate to how the mind works, and the study of cognition\nand emotion. When people think things that are opinions of emotional states, or\nopinions of how much emotion something causes them, they are changing their\nthinking and possibly making their thinking emotional.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 89\nWhy would it matter if a thought or just the words someone used was emotional or\nnot?

Here1 they reference a theory of Rosenthals:\n\u2022 According to Rosenthal\u2019s higher-order thought theory (1986, 1997, 2005), a\nmental state is conscious when there is a higher-order thought about it. I am\nconscious of the pain in my knee when I have a thought to the effect that I am in\nthat very pain state.\n\u2022 ... A third important feature of higher-order thoughts on Rosenthal\u2019s account is\nthat they are assertoric and occurrent. The higher-order thought must assert,\nrather than hope, fear or speculate that I am in a particular mental state.\nMoreover, the higher-order thought must occur at roughly the same time as the\nmental state it represents. The content of the higher-order thought should be, for\nexample: \u201cI am now feeling pain,\u201d not \u201cI might have felt pain yesterday\u201d or\n\u201cPerhaps I will feel pain in a few minutes.\u201d Rosenthal (1997) has argued that\nhigher-order thoughts must be occurrent in order to distinguish between non-\nconscious and conscious states. If the mere disposition to produce a higher-order\nthought were sufficient for a mental state to be conscious, it seems that all one\u2019s\nmental states would always be conscious.\nOf course if someone has a thought about the pain they are experiencing the pain is\ngoing to be more conscious. It obviously depends on the situation if the thought\nmakes the pain worse or less. I suppose a thought could make the pain less, but it\nwould also make you more conscious and more aware of this lessened, (but more\nconscious) pain.\nA model is proposed in the below image (B. Timmermans, et all), this is in the abstract\nof their paper:\n\u2022 Metacognition is usually construed as a conscious, intentional process whereby\npeople reflect upon their own mental activity. Here, we instead suggest that\nmetacognition is but an instance of a larger class of representational re-\ndescription processes that we assume occur unconsciously and automatically.\nFrom this perspective, the brain continuously and unconsciously learns to\nanticipate the consequences of action or activity on itself, on the world and on\nother people through three predictive loops: an inner loop, a perception\u2013action\nloop and a self\u2013other (social cognition) loop, which together form a tangled\nhierarchy.\n1.Higher-Order Theories of Consciousness.

When\nthe brain thinks about the stimuli it forms meta-cognitions and has a secondary\nresponse from its initial response.\nThe 'inner loop' or their first-order network, is basically the brain thinking about the\nstimulus, and part of the meta-cognition (the 'thinking about the thinking') is two other\nloops, a perception-action loop and a self-other loop (social cognition). This means\nthat the brain thinks more deeply about everything a second time, basically. Two of\nthe things that it thinks more deeply about are perceptions of actions, and general\nsocial cognitions about the self and other people.\nIt makes sense that the mind has different levels of thinking. There is a more simple\nway of thinking about the world and there is a more complicated way of thinking.\nWhen anything is thought about, there is a more simplistic way of thinking about it\nand a more complicated way of thinking about it. It might be that a human cannot\nunderstand the idea or whatever you are thinking about if it is too complicated, in\nwhich case the simple level of your mind would be the only level that understands it.\nI would say that the lower level of mind which isn't as intelligent or sophisticated as\nthe its higher level is the initial, more animalistic response. What does that mean for\nsensation versus thought, however? Is there are lower level of feeling pain and a\nhigher level? When someones mind is in the lower mode, how would it think different\nfrom its higher mode? It would probably have its higher-level social cognitions shut\noff. - So it wouldn't be capable of responding intelligently to other people, etc.\nTwo types of consciousness\nSo there are two different types of consciousness - one type is awareness of physical\nsensations, and the other type is high-order or lower-order thought. So the mind\ncould not be thinking clearly and not be responding intelligently to other people, and it\ncould not be aware of the pain, pleasure (other physical sensations, etc) that it is\nexperiencing. In that case it would be in a lower level state.\nSo it makes sense that pain medication would also make someone think less clearly -\nthat is because they are in a lower physical and mental state (both physical sensations\nand mental thinking are dulled).\n21.1 Types of Thinking\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThe two different levels of mind (a dulled, more simplistic level and a sophisticated,\nhigher order thought level) mean that in each level, a person is thinking differently.\nHow does a person think differently when they are drunk, on pain medication, or\notherwise not thinking clearly vs when they are thinking clearly? Is their thinking more\ntop-down or bottom-up?\nOr I could just simply ask the question - is an animals thinking (such as a dogs) more\ntop-down or bottom- up compared to a humans?\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 93\nDoes that statement make sense? A dog doesn't necessarily look at any details, so you\ncouldn't say that dogs look at broad conclusions first and then analyze down to the\ndetail or vice versa (top-down vs. bottom-up thinking).\nI am proposing that some peoples thinking is more top-down or bottom-up in general\nthan another persons. It isn't clear what that means exactly though. Top-down or\nbottom-up thinking usually refers to a specific way of analyzing something, not to how\nsomeone thinks in general. Though if you consider how someone might think if they\naren't being as intelligent, it makes me wonder if they might be more abstract and\nreach broad, not supported by any evidence conclusions first ('top-down') and ignore\ndetails. I could say that some people do that without thinking less than they usually do\nas well, however.\nWhat are the higher levels of thought that are shut off when someone can't think\nclearly? I mentioned before that they might not respond as intelligently to other\npeople (social cognition). But is that the full mystery behind the differences in these\nlevels of thinking or is more analysis necessary?\nWhen the higher intellectual functions of a humans brain are operating less efficiently,\nor are more shut off, (such as when someone is drugged, drunk or on pain\nmedication) they are less under control of their cognition. In this way they are more\nlike lesser animals since they cannot think as well.\nMaybe when people can't think as clearly they make statements that don't necessarily\nmake sense, or aren't supported by facts. I could say that those statements are a more\ntop-down type of thinking because they reached conclusions first without looking at\nthe details.\nMaking conclusions without looking at supporting details is both related to top-down\nthinking and subjective thinking. If you analyze the details of an idea or argument, you\nare probably making it less subjective and more scientific and objective.\n21.2 A Thinking Consciousness\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nLevels of thinking is going to be related to consciousness.

The question I want to bring up is - which mental processes influence our\nconsciousness and in what way do they do so?\nHow does a belief someone has influence what they are thinking or how they are\nthinking? Similarly, what does having an attitude do to someones thoughts, 'thinking'\nor consciousness?\nWhen you are talking to someone else, you could have an 'attitude' that they are\nworthless, be thinking that they are worthless and not have an attitude about it, etc.\nSo, obviously, attitudes are influenced by beliefs and emotions (thought and feeling).\n21.3 Higher order representations\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nDoes a humans mind make representations of the world? I would say that your minds\nbiochemistry determines what you are going to feel when you experience anything.\nYou see the color red, and your minds biology determines how that makes you feel,\nnot necessarily what you are thinking about it. However, since emotions and feelings\nare very complex then what influences your feeling when you see the color red might\nbe mental, psychological factors. For instance, you get mad when you see red because\nit reminds you of blood, or something.\nThe internet encyclopedia of philosophy also has a good entry on \u201cConsciousness\u201d.\nThey talk about higher order representation \u2013 which is basically a person being aware\nof their own consciousness at any given time, or aware of anything at any given time.\nFor instance, if I am aware of my feelings on a certain matter, then I am more\nconscious of that matter. That seems fairly obvious, I mean if you think about\nsomething more you are going to be more conscious of it. This relates to the two\ndifferent levels of thought and feeling \u2013 the lower level is more unconscious and\nimmediate and less under control, and the higher level of consciousness is part of\nconscious experience and people are more aware of because it isn\u2019t \u2018unconscious\u2019 it is\n\u2018conscious\u2019. So what separates out the two different levels of consciousness is one is\nmostly beneath awareness and would be defined as being unconscious, and the other\nis largely in awareness and would be defined as being conscious. There is clearly an\noverlap between conscious thoughts and feelings and unconscious thoughts and\nfeelings, however \u2013 there are degrees that someone\u2019s awareness is \u2018awake\u2019 and \u2018clear\u2019.\nHave I presented here a theory of consciousness? It is obvious that there are degrees\nto awareness, and all I have said is that consciousness is basically a combination of\nfeelings and thoughts - that is a rather simple explanation of consciousness. Is there\nmore explanation that is needed in order to answer what consciousness really is?:\n\u2022 As we have seen, one question that should be answered by any theory of\nconsciousness is: What makes a mental state a conscious mental state? There is a\nlong tradition that has attempted to understand consciousness in terms of some\nkind of higher-order awareness. For example, John Locke (1689/1975) once said\nthat \u201cconsciousness is the perception of what passes in a man\u2019s own mind.\u201d This\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 95\nintuition has been revived by a number of philosophers (Rosenthal, 1986, 1993b,\n1997, 2000, 2004, 2005; Gennaro 1996a, 2012; Armstrong, 1968, 1981; Lycan,\n1996, 2001). In general, the idea is that what makes a mental state conscious is\nthat it is the object of some kind of higher-order representation (HOR). A mental\nstate M becomes conscious when there is a HOR of M. A HOR is a \u201cmeta-\npsychological\u201d state, i.e., a mental state directed at another mental state. So, for\nexample, my desire to write a good encyclopedia entry becomes conscious when I\nam (non-inferentially) \u201caware\u201d of the desire. Intuitively, it seems that conscious\nstates, as opposed to unconscious ones, are mental states that I am \u201caware of\u201d in\nsome sense. This is sometimes referred to as the Transitivity Principle. Any theory\nwhich attempts to explain consciousness in terms of higher-order states is known\nas a higher-order (HO) theory of consciousness. It is best initially to use the more\nneutral term \u201crepresentation\u201d because there are a number of different kinds of\nhigher-order theory, depending upon how one characterizes the HOR in question.\nHO theories, thus, attempt to explain consciousness in mentalistic terms, that is,\nby reference to such notions as \u201cthoughts\u201d and \u201cawareness.\u201d Conscious mental\nstates arise when two unconscious mental states are related in a certain specific\nway; namely, that one of them (the HOR) is directed at the other (M). 2\nSo a mental state can be unconscious or conscious. If someone is sleeping and\ndreaming, then their mental state would be considered to unconscious. I would say\nthat there is a lot to say about how \u2018aware\u2019 someone is at any time. If someone is\ndrugged or drunk, are they less aware of their interactions with other people? I said\npreviously that they might not be responding as intelligently to other people. I\nwouldn\u2019t guess as to how exactly their cognitions or emotional response is dulled \u2013\nthere could be a wide range of emotional, personality and intellectual dispositions that\nsomeone could have that could be affected. That shows how awareness in general,\nnot necessarily when someone has lower general awareness like when they are\nsleeping or drunk, is influenced to different degrees.\nWhat is the difference between our unconscious awareness and our conscious\nawareness then? Here again is the internet encyclopedia of philosophy \u2013 they address\nthe question of differences between HO (high order) and LO (lower-order) mental\nstates, which I have said is basically the difference between conscious states and\nunconscious ones:\n\u2022 A fourth important objection to HO approaches is the question of how such\ntheories can explain cases where the HO state might misrepresent the lower-\norder (LO) mental state (Byrne 1997, Neander 1998, Levine 2001, Block 2011).\nAfter all, if we have a representational relation between two states, it seems\npossible for misrepresentation or malfunction to occur. If it does, then what\nexplanation can be offered by the HO theorist? If my LO state registers a red\npercept and my HO state registers a thought about something green due, say, to\nsome neural misfiring, then what happens? It seems that problems loom for any\nanswer given by a HO theorist and the cause of the problem has to do with the\nvery nature of the HO theorist\u2019s belief that there is a representational relation\nbetween the LO and HO states. For example, if the HO theorist takes the option\n2.Consciousness. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Entry by Rocco J. Gennaro.

On the\nother hand, if the resulting experience is greenish, then the LO state seems\nirrelevant. Rosenthal and Weisberg hold that the HO state determines the\nqualitative properties even in cases when there is no LO state at all (Rosenthal\n2005, 2011, Weisberg 2008, 2011a, 2011b). Gennaro (2012) argues that no\nconscious experience results in such cases and wonders, for example, how a sole\n(unconscious) HOT can result in a conscious state at all. He argues that there\nmust be a match, complete or partial, between the LO and HO state in order for a\nconscious state to exist in the first place.\nThe mind must have an unconscious understanding of the world and a conscious\nunderstanding of the world, and that is what accounts for differences in higher-order\n(conscious) and lower-order (unconscious) mental states. Or I could say that there is\nsimply a difference between how a human responds unconsciously, and how a human\nresponds consciously to experiences and stimuli.\nWhat is the difference between an unconscious response and a conscious response\nthen, however? Unconscious responses are affective - they are faster and more\nimmediate than conscious responses. Unconscious responses are also what your\nbrain has programmed in from previous development. Conscious responses,\nhowever, are more so under your control and thoughts can help to change a\nconscious response.\nWhat if someone\u2019s conscious response differs from their unconscious response? What\nwould be an example of that happening? All responses are unconscious unless\nsomeone tries to change their response. For example, people often try to change their\nfeelings by inhibiting them or encouraging them.\nSaying all responses are higher-order or conscious doesn\u2019t make sense, because\npeople are constantly influenced by natural emotional processes. First comes natural\nunconscious responses, and if you want to change or think about your situation, you\n\u2018think\u2019 and make the response more conscious.\nSo basically humans have emotional and intellectual responses to experience and\nstimuli. It is hard to influence your emotions with thought; however people attempt to\ndo this all the time (consciously and unconsciously).\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 97\nChapter 22 What is Logical or\nRational Thinking, and how does it\nrelate to Reasoning, Heuristics,\nBiases and the Rationality Debate?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThere are two different types of intelligence - one type can be measured objectively\n(i.e. perceptual speed and memory), and the type of intellect is subjective and,\nalthough it can be measured, is still subjective. The subjective type of intellect consists\nof things like reasoning ability and verbal comprehension.\nI stated that something like verbal comprehension is subjective; however that\nstatement is actually a big idea (if you think about it). It is basically saying that every\nwords definition is up for debate, or subject to opinion. That is true, however - for\ninstance the meaning of each word for each person may be different. When someone\nsays the word 'dog' maybe they mean to use the word as a metaphor and really mean,\n'that person is like a dog' not 'that is a dog'. Maybe even when someone says 'that is a\ndog' they are making a subjective statement, even though it seems pretty objective. - I\nmean a dog has a strict definition and most people have the same thing in mind when\nthey think of that word, therefore making its meaning rather straightforward.\nMy point is that different kinds of emotional understanding (which are largely things in\nlife that are 'subjective') make up life, the words people use, and common human\nunderstanding. Therefore nothing is ever really 'objective' because it is subject to\nhuman biases. Mathematical equations are objective, however if an animal were to\nlook at a math problem they might not understand it as being objective - they might\ninterpret the problem to mean something else (since it wouldn't mean anything to\nthem mathematically).\nPeople have beliefs of various sorts. These beliefs influence their thinking and how\nthey feel.\nWhat else is to be said about subjective reasoning?\nWhat else is to be said about what I have called 'subjective reasoning'? I am labeling\nreasoning ability as being biased and subjective in any case where emotional\ninformation is handled, which is all the time unless something is completely objective.\nHowever, nothing is completely objective because even a math problem is going to\ncause someone to be emotional or process it emotionally in some way. That is why I\nam saying that all reasoning ability is actually a sort of 'subjective reasoning'.\nI mean, if you think about it, most if not all of life involves dealing with your own\npersonal feelings - whether you are aware of it or not.

Some goals can\nbe brought into conscious awareness at various times for various reasons. Simon\n(1967)1reasoned that emotions are calls for reprioritization: that emotion regarding a\ngoal that is out of awareness eventually induces people to give that goal a higher\npriority. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the claim for higher priority. Affect\npulls the out-of-awareness into awareness.\nSimons analysis was just referring to goals. However, if you think about it, all of\nsomeones thoughts might follow a similar logic - the logic being that the most\nemotionally relevant thought has the highest claim to priority.\nSo if someone wants something, then they are emotionally motivated to think certain\nthings because thinking those things will generate more pleasurable emotions.\ncomputational components underlying intelligence\nWhat are the computational components underlying intelligence?\nTo begin, I ask the question - is thinking straightforward or is it complicated?\nWhen people think, they are constantly making emotional assessments of various\nsorts. They think about their own motivations, i.e. how they feel about different things,\nand what their goals are going to be based on those motivations.\nIndividual thoughts also mean something emotionally. Anything someone thinks is\ngoing to be associated with different feelings and preferences.\nDoes this mean that thinking is simple and logical? People think all of the time, what\nguides their thoughts are emotional preferences that were formed from previous\ndevelopment or at birth.\n22.1 Semantics versus Cognitive Representations\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nLouis Narens2presents the idea that there is a difference between descriptive\nsemantics (the words people use to describe something) and cognitive\nrepresentations (which is basically the image or idea your mind makes up in your\nhead (kind of like an abstract thought)) in evaluating evidence for judgments:\n1.Simon, H. A. (1967). Motivational and emotional controls of cognition. Psychology Review, 74, 29-39.\n2.A New Foundation for Support Theory. (2004) Louis Narens.

It explains these results in terms of subjective evaluations of\nsupporting evidence. It assumes that events are evaluated in terms of subjective\nevidence invoked by their descriptions, and that the observed numerical\nprobability judgments are the result of the combining of such evaluations of\nsupport in a manner that is consistent with a particular equation. The processes\nof evaluation are assumed to employ heuristics like those of Kahneman and\nTversky, and because of this, are subject to the kinds of biases introduced by such\nheuristics.\n\u2022 This article provides a New Foundation for Support Theory. The New Foundation\nmakes a sharp distinction between semantical representations of descriptions as\npart of natural language processing and cognitive representations of descriptions\nas part of a probabilistic judgment. In particular, judgments of probability employ\na complementation operation that has no counterpart in the semantics. The\ncomplementation operation is used to construct cognitive events that are\nemployed in the computation of the estimated probability.\nSo when someone evaluates a piece of information, they describe it in their mind\n(unconsciously or unconsciously) with words. Then they probably come to a\nconclusion from the evidence that the description provided.\nSo describing something with words would be something like, \"Linda is a bank teller\",\nor \"Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement\" Here is the\nexplanation from Narens:\n\u2022 Kahneman and Tversky found that over 85% of participants believed it was more\nlikely that Linda was both a bank teller and a feminist than just a bank teller. This\nis an example of what has become known as the conjunction fallacy. According to\nKahneman and Tversky, it is due to representativeness: \u201cbank teller and is active\nin the feminist movement\u201d is more a \u201crepresentative\u201d description of Linda than\njust \u201cbank teller.\u201d\nSo a humans mind has the verbal description given to them in words, and then their\nmind forms a representation based off of what they heard (i.e. - possibly an idea of\nLinda in their minds).\nSo that means that there must be lots of words use people use to describe things, and\nalso lots of cognitive 'ideas' or 'representations' they have in their mind that might\nassist these words.\nSo words, ideas and representations are all things a human's mind uses to think. I\ndon't know when exactly a human mind might use words instead of abstract, non-\nverbal thoughts - that would be getting unnecessarily detailed into how thinking\nworks, I would say.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 22 100\n22.2 So what exactly is a 'Subjective Evaluation'?\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nA subjective evaluation is exactly what those words describe - an assessment or\nevaluation of something that is biased, opinionated, and even possibly highly\ninfluenced by the persons feelings.\nSubjective evaluations are important because people make them all of the time,\nwhether or not they are aware of it. For instance anytime you see another person your\nmind makes an opinionated assessment of them. You might or might not be aware of\nyour unconscious assessment - maybe you make a conscious assessment of the\nperson that is different from your unconscious one, in which case you could feel\nconfused about the person or something.\nSince earlier in this paper I stated that everything in life is actually subjective, that\nmeans that people are constantly making subjective evaluations whenever they think\nabout anything. Any thought about something could be subjective in some way.\nIf you see a photograph maybe you have an unconscious opinion of that - or even if\nyou think about something you wouldn't typically consider to be emotional your mind\ncould still have a strong unconscious feeling or interpretation.\n22.3 How to develop a logical reasoner\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nThe human mind (and animal minds, though the process is different) comes to\nconclusions by weighing evidence. This process could be done unconsciously or\nconsciously; for instance people might make if - then statements to think about\nmaterial. Part of that might be considering evidence from examples that easily come\nto mind (this is called the 'availability' heuristic), or examples that are harder or take\nlonger to come to mind.\nPeople often have a tendency to rely on the first piece of information gathered, this\nheuristic is called 'anchoring and adjustment' - During decision making, anchoring\noccurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent\njudgments. People might adjust away from the anchor to get their final answer, which\nwould be the logical thing to do; however studies show people tend rely on the first\npiece of information - whether it is right or not (instead of using it as evidence and\nexplain away from it when the information is false)\nSo it depends on the circumstance if people try or don't try to explain (adjust) away\nfrom an incorrect piece of evidence. They might try to justify the first piece of\ninformation offered (the anchor) even though it wouldn't be the logical thing to do.\nSo this relates to thinking logically - when weighing evidence, people need to consider\nif they are being falsely influenced by information and are biasing different pieces of\ninformation in their mind. They might be biasing the first piece of information offered\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 101\n'the anchor' and be relying too heavily on that instead of looking more objectively at\nall of the evidence.\nSo how exactly does the human mind weigh different pieces of information or\nconstruct an argument based off of evidence? It uses mental models to 'model' an\nargument, I would say. So there are different ways material or evidence can be\nconsidered by your mind, and these mental models weigh this evidence differently\neach time. Depending on the set of material or evidence, your mind might consider it\ndifferently (a 'mental model').\nHow could someone learn to reason more logically? I just explained two heuristics and\nhow they effect thinking - by the speed and order of information made available to\nyour mind. People bias the information they are given or don't consider it logically in\nmany cases, but all that could be done about that to become a more logical thinker\nwould be to be aware of your personal biases and be more reflective.\nHypothetical reasoning\nWhat is hypothetical reasoning? It is creating imaginary worlds to test out our thinking.\nHere Stanovich 3explains this type of reasoning in terms of carrying out goals, though\nI would say this type of thinking is critical for more complex thought as well:\n\u2022 When we reason hypothetically, we create temporary models of the world and\ntest out actions (or alternative causes) in that simulated world. In order to reason\nhypothetically we must, however, have one critical cognitive capability\u2014the ability\nto distinguish our representations of the real world from representations of\nimaginary situations. For example, in considering an alternative goal state\ndifferent from the one we currently have, we must be able to represent our\ncurrent goal and the alternative goal and to keep straight which is which.\nLikewise, we need to be able to differentiate the representation of an action\nabout to be taken from representations of potential alternative actions we are\nconsidering. But the latter must not infect the former while the mental simulation\nis being carried out.\nIf you think about it, humans must have a large imaginary world in their minds where\nthey think and test out what they are thinking. This probably applies to everything - if\nyou are trying to figure out which team is going to win a soccer match you might\nsimulate the game in your head. If you are thinking about anything, you simulate the\nemotions, actions, behaviors, mathematical equations, or whatever it is - and this\nhelps you think about it.\nHeuristic vs. Rule-based processing\nHeuristic processing is low-level, more unconscious and doesn't require as much\nthought as systematic processing. 4Systematic processing requires active, careful\nscrutiny of relevant information and is more cognitively taxing.\n3.Stanovich, K. E., + Stanovich, P. J. (2010). A framework for critical thinking, rational thinking, and intelligence. In D. Preiss\n+ R. J.

However, even though that type of processing makes use\nof rules, it is a lower-level processing than when rules are used by the systematic type\nof processing - which is more cognitive and leads to attitude change that is more\nenduring (because it is more conscious).\nThese different ways of processing are related to conscious and unconscious\nprocessing, or what is called in psychology a 'dual process theory' which provides an\naccount of how a phenomenon can occur in two different ways, or as a result of two\ndifferent processes. Often, the two processes consist of an implicit (automatic),\nunconscious process and an explicit (controlled), conscious process.\nSo rule-based processing usually refers to higher-level logic and casual inference. It\nfollows rules, instead of merely conforming to them like how weight conforms to the\nlaw of gravity. So the unconscious could be considered to be doing its own thing,\nhowever the conscious mind actively thinks and therefore 'consciously' follows rules\nor thinks more about rules, more so than simply using a rule as a guideline. An\nexample would be the rule-based decision rule example I used before to explain\nheuristic processing. If the rule or thought is 'analysts are always right' then your mind\nmight unconsciously follow that when listening to an analyst and then you would\nbelieve that he or she is right. However if the process is more conscious then you\nmight think 'well maybe this person is wrong'. The rule wouldn't be as unconscious.\nAnyone could really define 'heuristic processing' as being conscious or unconscious,\ncontrolled or automatic actually. Different people have termed the processes of the\nconscious mind and the processes of the unconscious mind differently - these are\ncalled 'dual process' theories. Here Moshman5lists all the combinations of the\ndifferent types of processing as possibilities:\n\u2022 Central to S+W\u2019s analysis is a distinction between automatic heuristic processing\n(characteristic of what they call System 1) and explicit rule-based processing\n(characteristic of what they call System 2). I believe this dichotomy confounds two\northogonal distinctions. Specifically, the distinction between automatic and\nexplicit processing is conceptually orthogonal to the distinction between heuristic\nand rule-based processing. Crossing automatic versus explicit with heuristic\nversus rule- based suggests four possible types of processing: (a) automatic\nheuristic processing (System 1), (b) automatic rule-based processing (not\nrepresented in the Stanovich/West analysis), (c) explicit heuristic processing (also\nnot represented), and (d) explicit rule-based processing (System 2).\nThe two types not represented probably weren't because they don't make complete\nsense - rule-based processing is more conscious and controlled, so saying it is\nautomatic would be putting it in the unconscious category - which is possible, however\nthat is not how it is defined. Explicit heuristic processing doesn't necessarily make\nmuch sense either because heuristic processing is defined as being automatic and not\ncognitively taxing, however explicit or controlled processes are cognitively taxing\nbecause they are more deliberate and conscious.\n5.Diversity in reasoning and rationality: Metacognitive and developmental considerations.

In the article 'System 1' is more unconscious, forms intuitions, and the\nconscious mind then acquires these intuitions. They give the example of a statistics\ninstructor who, though initially draws conclusions about students and infers\nprobability about their personalities ('for whom the basic probability axioms are not\ntransparent'), he or she eventually becomes no longer able to emphasize with them.\nBasically the unconscious, intuitive mind helps form our conscious understanding of\npeople and of the probability judgments we make:\n\u2022 We agree with Kahneman that some people may make more nuanced System 1\njudgments than others, and that individual differences in this capability are of\nsome importance. This is related to Teigen\u2019s point that when System 2 analytic\nabilities fail, well-framed intuitions may come to our assistance in narrowing the\nnormative/descriptive gap, and the better those intuitions are the narrower the\ngap. But, following Reber (1992a; 1992b; 1993), we would conjecture that the\nvariance in these System 1 abilities might well be considerably lower than the\nmore recently evolved structures of System 2. Note, however, that this variability\ncould become larger through the mechanism discussed above \u2013 instantiating of\nautomatic System 1 algorithms through practice strategically initiated by System\n2. Thus, some of the \u201cwell framed intuitions\u201d referred to by Teigen may well be\nacquired intuitions \u2013 having their origins in capacity- intensive serial processing,\nyet now having the encapsulated, automatic characteristics of modular processes.\nSome statistics instructors, for example, become unable to empathize with their\nstudents for whom the basic probability axioms are not transparent. The\ninstructor can no longer remember when these axioms were not primary\nintuitions.\nIt is obvious that the unconscious mind helps forms our conscious understanding.\nPeople have two ways of thinking about the world, one is unconscious and one is\nconscious. These two systems must interact all of the time and influence each other in\ndifferent ways.\nWays of thinking\nThe algorithmic level of analysis of mind is the level that just analyzes the details of\nwhat is occurring - it doesn't reflect and ask 'why' questions. There are different types\nof thinking dispositions, or ways people think - these ways of analyzing how someone\nthinks can help determine if a person is thinking rationally or irrationally. Here is\nStanovich + Stanovich (2010):\n\u2022 The difference between the algorithmic mind and the reflective mind is captured\nin another well- established distinction in the measurement of individual\ndifferences\u2014the distinction between cognitive ability and thinking dispositions.\n6.Stanovich, K. E., + West, R. F. (2000). Individual differences in reasoning: Implications for the rationality debate?\nBehavioral and Brain Sciences, 23, 645-665.\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 Chapter 22 104\nThe former are, as just mentioned, measures of the efficiency of the algorithmic\nmind. The latter travel under a variety of names in psychology\u2014thinking\ndispositions or cognitive styles being the two most popular. Many thinking\ndispositions concern beliefs, belief structure and, importantly, attitudes toward\nforming and changing beliefs. Other thinking dispositions that have been\nidentified concern a person\u2019s goals and goal hierarchy. Examples of some thinking\ndispositions that have been investigated by psychologists are: actively open-\nminded thinking, need for cognition (the tendency to think a lot), consideration of\nfuture consequences, need for closure, superstitious thinking, and dogmatism\n(Cacioppo, Petty, + Feinstein 1996; Kruglanski + Webster, 1996; Norris + Ennis,\n1989; Schommer- Aikins, 2004; Stanovich, 1999, 2009; Sternberg, 2003; Sternberg\n+ Grigorenko, 1997; Strathman, Gleicher, Boninger, + Scott Edwards, 1994).\n\u2022 The literature on these types of thinking dispositions is vast and our purpose is\nnot to review that literature here. It is only necessary to note that the types of\ncognitive propensities that these thinking disposition measures reflect are the\ntendency to collect information before making up one\u2019s mind, to seek various\npoints of view before coming to a conclusion, to think extensively about a\nproblem before responding, to calibrate the degree of strength of one\u2019s opinion\nto the degree of evidence available, to think about future consequences before\ntaking action, to explicitly weigh pluses and minuses of situations before making a\ndecision, and to seek nuance and avoid absolutism. In short, individual\ndifferences in thinking dispositions include assessing variation in people\u2019s goal\nmanagement, epistemic values, and epistemic self-regulation\u2014differences in the\noperation of reflective mind. They are all psychological characteristics that\nunderpin rational thought and action.\nSo there are bunch of subjective things a human's mind does that determine how it\nthinks. I mean in any single situation how could someone think about their entire 'goal\nhierarchy' or their 'belief structure'? Does that matter if the person is open-minded?\nHow much do you need to think about the future consequences of your actions or\nweigh the pluses and minuses of a situation? All of these processes are very subjective\nand hard to measure on standard IQ tests; however they are all 'psychological\ncharacteristics that underpin rational thought and action'.\n22.4 The Nature of Reasoning\nAvailable underCreative Commons-ShareAlike 4.0 International License(http://creativecommon\ns.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).\nDeductive reasoning is the same as top-down reasoning, where someone looks at\ngeneralizations first and then figures out what the details of those would be.\nOften it could just be a guess what the details are since you might be inferring the\ndetails instead of finding evidence.\nI would say that this type of logic can apply to any type of thinking. For instance, even\nif I am just moving the mouse of a computer I could think of it in two ways (deductive\nor inductive). The deductive way of thinking would be something like 'I am moving the\nmouse of the computer, my arm causes it to move and those are the movements it\nDownload for free at http://cnx.org/contents/e9870125-e711-4b95-b8a1-46ba7f0fbf48@19.1 105\nmakes' and the inductive way would be 'these are the movements my computer\nmouse is making, I must be deciding to move the mouse - I am directing its\nmovements'. With the deductive method, the idea of you came before the realization\nyou were making detailed movements, and with the inductive method the opposite\noccurred.\nMy example is different from more obvious or straightforward examples of deductive\nand inductive reasoning, where it is clear what the generalization is and what the\ndetails are. I would say that it is still a good example, however, it is just more\nsubjective. The idea 'I am moving the mouse' is the main idea, and the detail is 'the\nmouse is moving, those are the movements it is making'. The reason the movements\nof the mouse are the details is because that is where more description can be\ndescribed.\nThat example of deductive reasoning is subjective, however. A more typical example\nwould be one with a concretely broad idea and it would be clear that detail was\ninferred from it. With my example, however, you could say that the opposite is true\nand that the general idea is that 'the mouse is moving', and the detail is that 'I am\nmoving the mouse' (instead of the opposite). It looks like it depends on which idea\ncomes first. Whichever idea comes first the human mind would assess is the more\ngeneralized idea that needs to be supported. - That idea itself is significant because\npeople could form delusions, or imagine what the details are or what the other side of\nthe story is simply because they heard one idea first.\nThings can be viewed in more than one way\nA fundamental element of reasoning is that a different idea can be viewed many\ndifferent ways. This is different from simply listing the significant factors - viewing\nsomething differently means changing the subjective perspective you have on\nsomething, while listing significant factors could be categorized under one\nperspective. Therefore the two elements of information is content and angle\n(subjectivity).
