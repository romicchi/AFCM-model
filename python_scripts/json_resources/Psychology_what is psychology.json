What do you hope to learn? If you were asked this\nquestion, what was your response? Generally, the range of responses which surface\nin class to this question are truly bewildering. Most students give inane responses,\nlike they want to know what others are thinking. But then one also comes across\nsuch responses as knowing oneself, knowing others or more specific responses like\nknowing why people dream, why people go out of their way to help others or beat\neach other up. All ancient traditions have engaged themselves with questions about\nhuman nature. The Indian philosophical traditions, in particular, deal with questions\nrelating to why people behave in the manner in which they do. Why are people\ngenerally unhappy? What changes should they bring about in themselves if they\ndesire happiness in their lives? Like all knowledge, psychological knowledge too\nis intended to contribute to human well-being. If the world is full of misery, it is\nlargely due to humans themselves. Perhaps, you have asked why a 9/11 or war\nin Iraq happened. Why innocent people in Delhi, Mumbai, Srinagar or in the North-\nEast have to face bombs and bullets? Psychologists ask what is in the experiences\nof young men which turn them into terrorists seeking revenge. But there is another\nside to human nature. You may have heard the name of Major HPS Ahluwalia,\nparalysed waist down because of an injury he suffered in a war with Pakistan,\nwho climbed the Mt. Everest. What moved him to climb such heights? These are not\nonly questions about human nature which psychology addresses as a human\nscience.

Psychology\ncannot claim that answers have been found to these complex questions. But it\nsurely has improved upon our understanding and how we make sense of these\nphenomena.

It is treated as a\nnatural as well as a social science.\n\u2022 The major schools of psychological thought are structuralism, functionalism, behaviourism,\nGestalt school, psychoanalysis, humanistic psychology and cognitive psychology.\n\u2022 Contemporary psychology is multivocal as it is characterised by many approaches or\ndiverse views, which explain behaviour at different levels. These approaches are not\nmutually exclusive. Each provides valuable insights into the complexities of human\nfunctioning. The cognitive approach uses thought processes as central to psychological\nfunctions. The humanistic approach views human functioning as characterised by a desire\nto grow, be productive and fulfill human potential.\n\u2022 Today psychologists work in many specialised fields which have their own theories and\nmethods. They make efforts to develop theories and solve problems in specific domains.\nSome of the major fields of psychology are: cognitive psychology, biological psychology,\nhealth psychology, developmental psychology, social psychology, educational and school\npsychology, clinical and counselling psychology, environmental psychology, industrial/\norganisational psychology, sports psychology.\n\u2022 More recently a need is felt to have multi/interdisciplinary initiatives to arrive at a better\nunderstanding of reality. This has led to a collaboration across disciplines. Interests of\npsychology overlap with social sciences (e.g., economics, political science, sociology),\nbiosciences (e.g., neurology, physiology, medicine), mass communication, and music and\nfine arts. Such efforts have led to fruitful research and application.\n\u2022 Psychology is a discipline not merely contributing to the development of theoretical\nknowledge about human behaviour, but contributing to the solution of problems at different\nlevels. Psychologists are employed to help in diverse activities in a variety of settings\nincluding schools, hospitals, industries, training institutes, military and government\nestablishments. Many of them are doing private practice and are consultants.\nRRRRReeeeevvvvviiiiieeeeewwwww QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1. What is behaviour?
