Runners, for example, must\nhave a strategy to win a race. They must decide how fast to start\nout, when to pass someone, and how to pace themselves so they\nhave some energy left for the last stretch of the race.\nHere's another example. When we decide we are interested in\nsomeone, we devise a strategy to attract that person\u2019s attention and\nwin their affection. What kinds of strategies might someone use to\nattract another person\u2019s attention? (Possible answers include,\nmake ourselves look attractive, try to impress the person, try\nto be helpful, considerate, polite, etc.) Can you think of other\nsituations that require a strategy?\nSkilled reading also requires strategies. We use strategies to figure\nout words we do not know. In this lesson we are going to learn\nabout some strategies for reading (decoding) words we do not\nrecognize by sight.\n2.

For example, someone can recover from a coma\nand no longer be able to read and\/or write.\nUnderstanding What Reading Is All About 75 NCSALL Teaching Materials\n3. A learning disability is something that can be cured by taking\nmedicine.\nNo. Taking medicine cannot cure a learning disability.\nUnfortunately, learning disabilities do not go away even with\nappropriate instruction. A person with a disability can,\nhowever, learn to work around their disability. The following\nanalogy is often helpful: Think of someone who has poor vision\nand needs to wear glasses. When they wear their glasses they\ncan see as well as anyone else. Their limited vision is not a\nproblem. The poor vision, however, has not gone away. As\nsoon as they take off the glasses, vision becomes problem.\n4. People with learning disabilities cannot get well-paid jobs.\nNo. People with learning disabilities can be as successful as\nanyone else.\nMany people with learning disabilities have very high-paying\njobs. (Add some examples here.) The key is learning how to\nwork around your disability. This is called \u201ccompensating.\u201d\n5. Learning disabilities are inherited (passed down from one family\nmember to another).\nYes, usually. Learning disabilities often run in families.\nLearning disabilities are usually inherited just like eye color or\nheight.\n6. The brains of people with learning disabilities work differently.\nYes.\nWe are now able to take pictures of the brain while a person is\ndoing an activity like reading. These pictures show us that, in\nfact, the brains of people with learning disabilities do work\ndifferently. This means that sometimes it may take a little\nlonger for someone with a disability to do a particular task like\nread a word, remember someone\u2019s name, or understand\ndirections given by a supervisor.\nRemember, however, that learning disabilities have nothing to\ndo with intelligence!\n76 Understanding What Reading Is All About Teaching Materials NCSALL\n7. People with learning disabilities are protected against discrimination\nby the law.\nYes. The Americans with Disabilities Act makes it illegal to\ntreat someone with a physical or a learning disability unfairly.\nAn employer cannot refuse to hire someone because he or she\nhas a learning disability, as long as he or she can perform the\n\u201cessential function\u201d of the job. And schools cannot refuse to\nprovide services to someone solely on the basis of a learning\ndisability.\nThe federal definition of learning disability (which applies to\nchildren and adults) says that, to be eligible for services and\naccommodations, a person must have a significant difference\nbetween what an intelligence test indicates he or she can do and\ntheir actual academic performance.\nA person with a learning disability is allowed to have certain\n\u201caccommodations\u201d (adjustments) in school and on the job.\nAccommodations include:\nNote to Teacher\nIn order to get these\n\u2022 extra time for tests or to complete job assignments\naccommodations,\nhowever, persons with\n\u2022 a private room for taking tests disabilities must have\na report (evaluation)\nfrom a doctor that\n\u2022 the use of a tape recorder\nsays that they have a\nlearning disability and\n\u2022 large print materials or note takers request specific\naccommodations.\n\u2022 job coaches (someone that helps them on the job)\n3. Define \u201clearning disabilities\u201d\n\u2022 Discuss the definition of \u201clearning disability.\u201d A \u201clearning\ndisability\u201d usually means that a person is experiencing\nsignificant difficulty with one or more learning skills. For\nexample, a learning disability may affect one\u2019s ability to\nread, write, spell, understand what one reads, do math, pay\nattention, or establish relationships with other people.\n\u2022 Explain: Each of us is good at some things and struggles with\nother things. We all have strengths and weaknesses. (Present an\nexample from your own life.) Just because something is\nUnderstanding What Reading Is All About 77 NCSALL Teaching Materials\ndifficult for you, however, doesn\u2019t mean you have a learning\ndisability. A difficulty becomes a \u2018learning disability\u2019 only when it\nmakes it extremely difficult for you to accomplish your goals or\nrealize your potential. If you are unable to accomplish your goals\n(e.g., get a better job, help your children with their homework, pass\nthe citizenship test or the GED) AND you have been to school, you\nmay have a learning disability.\n\u2022 Refer back to the statements on the quiz and elaborate on\neach point. Learners should be encouraged to ask questions\nat any time. If you do not know the answer, it is perfectly all\nright to say: I don\u2019t know but I will try to find out. One good\nsource of information is the LINCS Literacy and Learning\nDisabilities Special Collection found at:\nhttp:\/\/ldlink.coe.utk.edu\n4. Explain testing for learning disabilities\n\u2022 Describe the process for being tested for a learning\ndisability.\nAsk: How do you know if you have a learning disability? Can\nyou take a test?\n\u2022 Explain: You can get tested for a learning disability by taking\ncertain tests. These tests measure your general intelligence level\nand measure your ability to do certain things like read, write, solve\nmathematical problems, or understand (comprehend) what you\nread. The doctor will also ask you questions about your past\nexperiences in school, about your health, and about your family.\nIn order for the doctor to decide that you have a learning disability,\nthere must be a gap between what you could do (your potential),\nwhich is measured by the intelligence tests, and how you are\ncurrently doing (what you have already achieved), which is\nmeasured by tests in reading, spelling, math, and other academic\nskill areas.\nIf you are diagnosed with a learning disability, you would be able\nto get the accommodations we talked about earlier.\nGetting tested for a learning disability can be very expensive\n(ranging from $300 to $1,500!). It is expensive because a doctor\n78 Understanding What Reading Is All About Teaching Materials NCSALL\nmust have special training to give the intelligence tests. It is a\ngood idea to see if your health insurance will cover the costs of the Note to Teacher\ntesting. Medicaid, which is the federal program that provides free You may want to list\nthe phone number of\nmedical care to people with low incomes, may cover the costs of LD\nsome testing\ntesting.

Demonstrate \u201cpoker chip\u201d strategy\n\u2022 Explain that the \u201cpoker chip\u201d strategy is for spelling\nphonetically regular words. Hand out five same-colored\npoker chips to each learner. These poker chips will\nrepresent the consonant sounds. Each learner also receives\none poker chip of a different color. This poker chip will\nrepresent the vowels. Learners should have a clear work\nspace to lay out their chips.\n\u2022 Explain: I am going to say a word and I want you to pull down\none (mention the color of the same-colored chips) chip for each\nsound you hear. The word is \u201czup.\u201d How many sounds do you\nhear? There are three sounds so you should pull down three chips.\nNow I want you to find the vowel sound and replace the chip with\ndifferent-colored chip that will represent the vowel sound. (Make\nsure that learners replace the \u201cconsonant\u201d chip with the\n\u201cvowel\u201d chip.) The total number of sounds (and chips) remains\nthe same. Now you are ready to spell the word. Write the letter\nthat corresponds to each chip and let me know when you are ready\nfor me to check your work.\n\u2022 Give learners an opportunity to practice using the \u201cpoker\nchip\u201d strategy for spelling phonetically regular words.\nDictate the following words:\nstart slip smelt fond trust\n\u2022 Have learners use the chips to identify the sounds before\nthey assign letters to the sounds.
