{"text":"CHAPTER 1\nWhat is the Western World?\nThis course is Geography of the Western World. So, what is the Western World?\nThis course is a Regional Geography course. When geographers create regions, they strive to incorporate as\nmany similarities as possible in order to develop a recognizable region, while keeping out differences. So, what\nare the similarities of the Western World?\nWe could begin with the word \u201cWestern.\u201d Would this include every place that is west of the zero line \u2013 0\u00b0\nlongitude westward to 180\u00b0 longitude? This zero mark is the prime meridian that passes through Greenwich,\nEngland. Thus, we would include Great Britain, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, (Norway\u2019s Svalbard Islands), and\nAndorra from Europe, plus Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ghana, Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Cote\nD\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, the Gambia, Cape Verde, and Senegal in Africa. All of the\nAmericas are included. The 180\u00b0 longitude line intersects the easternmost corner of Russia. Going westward to\nthat line would cover much of the Pacific Ocean and a number of islands up to Fiji. Correctly used, all of this\n0\u00b0-180\u00b0 is the Western Hemisphere; however, often this hemispherical reference is wrongly shortened to mean\nthe Americas.\nAnyway, is that set of countries what we mean by the Western World? No.\nSometimes one of the shared characteristics is a feature of the physical landscape. Since the Western World\nwould seem to consist of half of the world, while the Eastern World is the other half, this is a huge array of lands\nthat would have to share common features. Indeed, the Western World has many different landscapes, as does\nthe Eastern World. Europe is known for islands, peninsulas, and mountains, but not deserts. South America has\nthe Andes Mountains, the Amazon Rainforest, and the world\u2019s driest desert (Atacama). North America has a full\narray of landscapes, even tundra in Canada and Alaska. Australia is famed for its dry Outback. Russia is enormous\n1 2 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nand leads the world in coniferous forest and in permafrost. Is there some way to identify the typical landscape of\nthe Western World? No.\nNevertheless, there is one important element of countries\u2019 landscapes as they relate to the understanding of\nregions. Are the lands contiguous? That is, does a country of the region share an international border with\nanother country of the same region? Normally, this too is a requirement (or being nearby for island states) for\ninclusion in the region. However, the Western World is a region comprising half the world; surely, contiguity\ncannot be maintained throughout the whole western half of the world. This is correct. That means that we\nneed to consider each of the sub-regions of the Western World. Do all the countries of North America border\nanother country in North America? Yes, that is easy, as the only two countries in North America are the United\nStates and Canada. Do all the countries in Europe border another country or countries in Europe? Yes, with\nthe understanding the Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Malta are island states within the same realm\nand nearby to continental states of Europe. The Pacific Realm is a host of island countries plus the continent of\nAustralia. We count all of those islands as within the same realm. Russian Domain countries \u2013 yes. Latin American\nand Caribbean countries (LACAR) \u2013 yes, either continental or in the shared island realm. So, our rule of contiguity\nis acceptable when we assess it based on the sub-regions of the Western World.\nThat brings us to the human or cultural landscape. Are there\nshared features of the Western World when we consider the\npeople of these lands? Economic development is a key indicator of\nquality of life in the human landscape. Many economies in the\nWestern World have been very fruitful. The Human Development\nIndex, measuring life span, education, and income as features of\nsuccessful societal advances, is dominated by countries of the\nWestern World. For 2019, the only non-Western placeholders in\nthe top fifty are Hong Kong #4, Singapore #9, Japan #19, Israel tied\nwith South Korea #22, UAE #35, Saudi Arabia #36, Qatar #41,\nBrunei #43, Bahrain #45, Oman #47. However, it also is true that\nnot all Western World countries are greatly developed. Haiti ranks\n#169 out of 189 countries, while some Pacific island states\n(Solomon Islands #153) and other Latin American and the\nCaribbean (LACAR) countries (e.g., Guatemala and Nicaragua, tied\n#126) score poorly. Therefore, this measure also does not fully\nwork for creating the Western World as a region. Some capitalist\neconomies of the Western World have produced strong economies\nand developed societies, but other Western countries haven\u2019t and\nsome Eastern countries have.\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\nLanguage is a core feature of culture. Indo-European languages include a number of Romance languages such WHAT IS THE WESTERN WORLD? 3\nas French and Italian, a set of Germanic languages including English and German, and several Slavic languages\nsuch as Russian and Czech. That list goes on, consisting of many other languages too \u2013 Greek, Latvian, Romanian,\nDutch, \u2026 . English settlement of Australia included bestowing its language on this land down under. Note that\nseveral languages in this Indo-European family were brought to the Americas to become the dominant languages\nthere \u2013 English, Spanish, Portuguese, French. For instance, in Nicaragua over 4.3 million people speak Spanish,\nwhereas the top native language Miskito is spoken by only 154 thousand.\nThere are some problems with this formula. In Europe, there are only a few national languages that are not\nin this family, but Hungarian, Finnish, and Estonian are in the Finno-Ugric family. In Latin America, there are\ncountries where the Indo-European language is spoken by large numbers of people, but a native language is\nspoken by similarly large numbers. For instance, in Paraguay, Spanish and the native language Guarani each are\nspoken by nearly 90% of the population. In Sub-Saharan Africa, there are a few countries that feature an Indo-\nEuropean language as an official language, though mixed with several to many native languages. In Liberia,\nEnglish is an official language, spoken by over 80% of the population, yet there are many languages spoken, as\nKpelle is most common at 20%. Also, it should be noted that some national languages are in the Indo-European\nfamily, yet we do not count those countries in the Western World. Hindi in India, Persian (Farsi) in Iran, Urdu\nin Pakistan, and Bengali in Bangladesh are examples. In sum, the national languages of the Western World are\nalmost uniformly in the Indo-European family, but the Western World does not have an exclusive hold on this\nlanguage family.\nReligion is a key element of culture. It is immediately\napparent that Christianity is a shared feature throughout the\nWestern World. Not necessarily an official national religion,\nChristianity is the majority religion of the modern histories of\nthe Americas, the Russian Domain, and Australia and New\nZealand. Among those professing religious faith, Christians\ndominate nearly all European countries, except the small states\nof Albania, Kosovo, and Bosnia & Herzegovina. Sometimes,\nChristianity is the majority religion in countries on other\ncontinents: in Asia \u2013 the Philippines, in Africa quite a few \u2013\nNigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and others. In the Western\nWorld, Christianity is the predominant religion, although it can\nbe noteworthy in some countries of the Eastern World too.\nIf a country\u2019s society speaks an Indo-European language,\nBorgund Stave Church, Norway \u2014 Photo by Stephen\npredominantly and historically professes the Christian faith,\nRoth on Unsplash\nand borders another country in the Western World (or if an\nisland, then is nearby), then it is in the Western World.\nA few countries are included in the Western World even while not meeting all three criteria, but especially due\nto geographic contiguity. This is where landscape, in this case the continent, makes a difference. There is no\nother reasonable regional fit for these countries. Admittedly, this is awkward. Yet, this is one of the challenges of\nGeography in constructing regions.\nSome countries do not meet the religion requirement, but must be counted by contiguity. Kosovo, Albania, and\nBosnia & Herzegovina are Muslim countries, but must be counted in Europe. Other countries do not meet the\nlanguage requirement, but must be counted by contiguity. As mentioned, Estonia, Finland, and Hungary do not\nfeature dominant Indo-European languages, but must be counted in Europe. The same is true for Paraguay in\nLACAR.\nIn a twist, there are countries that would seem to fit into the Western World by criteria, but are not accepted.\nIn Sub-Saharan Africa, in Liberia over 80% of the population are both Christian faithful and English speakers. 4 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn Nigeria, there is a similar majority. However, in Sub-Saharan Africa the only two Christian-believing, Indo-\nEuropean-speaking countries that border each other are the small lands of Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. So\nwhile some African countries have our criteria for religion and language, they fail the contiguity test of aligning\nnext to sets of other Western World countries.\nThat took a lot of effort. To sum up again, it is location, language, and religion that are the keys to determining\nwhich countries are in the Western World.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nIf Turkey ever is added to the European Union, then it will be counted in Europe, but until then, Turkey is best counted in the Middle East\n(sometimes called Southwest Asia). With Turkey in the Middle East, could Kosovo or Albania or Bosnia & Herzegovina be counted as part of the\nMiddle East? Any of those choices seems jarring to the concept of Europe. Furthermore, Turkey is not contiguous to any of those three small\ncountries. Albania and Kosovo share a border, but neither touches Bosnia & Herzegovina.\nCompare that to the location of Azerbaijan. The Soviet Union included the republic of Azerbaijan. With the breakup of the Soviet Union,\nAzerbaijan became an independent country. Given its Muslim population with a moderate and oil-based economy, it seems reasonable to\nplace it in the Middle East. Given that Azerbaijan borders Iran, another Middle Eastern country, this is not at all jarring.\nIn Norwegian and Swedish languages, the word spr\u00e5k means language.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\u201c2019 Human Development Index Ranking | Human Development Reports.\u201d 2019.

CHAPTER 2\nWhat is Regional Geography?\nWHAT IS REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY?\nThe field of Geography can be divided into various sub-groups,\nas Geography seeks to answer questions of Where? What? How? Why? Who?\nMost people understand that one piece is Physical Geography, the study of the physical landscape of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface. Some colleges and universities house this portion of Geography quite naturally within their Geography\nDepartments; however, other schools have separate Earth Science Departments to study these topics. Essentially,\nEarth Science is the same as Physical Geography.\nWithin this sub-field of Geography, there are additional categories of study. Geomorphology examines the\nEarth\u2019s landmasses and the forces that build and change the lands. Oceanography considers the Earth\u2019s oceans\nand seas, while climatology and meteorology address the world\u2019s climates and weather\nrespectively. Biogeography studies the distribution of life on the planet. All of these sub-fields of Geography\ninteract with each other to cover the land, water, and life on Earth. There are additional sub-fields of these sub-\nfields.\nThe other main piece of Geography is Human Geography, though sometimes this field is called Cultural\nGeography or Social Geography. This is the study of people in places. Human Geography examines the features\nof individuals and the characteristics of groups of people in order to describe and explain the dynamics of human\nlife in the varied and many locations of the planet. The sub-fields of Human Geography largely are obvious:\n5 6 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n\u2022 Population Geography\n\u2022 Political Geography\n\u2022 Economic Geography\n\u2022 Historical Geography\n\u2022 Urban Geography\n\u2022 and more.\nWhile Physical Geography basically overlaps completely with Earth Science, the sub-fields of Human Geography\nclearly overlap at times and partially with other disciplines. Obviously, Political Geography overlaps at times and\npartially with Political Science, and so on. In all cases, it is important to understand that Human Geography is\ninterested in describing people\u2019s characteristics at a given location, hopefully to be able subsequently to explain\nhuman activity at that location. Every time, location matters.\nRegional Geography utilizes both Physical Geography and Human Geography. In order to create meaningful\nregions, geographers look to find places (usually countries) that share numerous characteristics and have few\nnoteworthy differences. Do Country A and Country B have the same basic physical landscape? Perhaps they could\nbe included in the same region. Do Country C and Country D share the same dominant religion? If so, then this\nelement of Cultural Geography suggests a possible pairing in the same region. Do the people of Country E and\nCountry F speak the same common language? They might belong together. When doing the work of Regional\nGeography, scholars seek to put many similarities together to form a region. While that is the main structural\npattern of Regional Geography, there are a couple of additional factors to consider. A region could have only a\nfew countries, but generally these countries would cover a large area. For instance, North America consists only\nof Canada and the United States. A region may have numerous countries, perhaps of smaller sizes.\nCountries that belong together in a region must be contiguous, or for islands, adjacent. That is, for a country\nto be in a specific region, it must border another country that too is in the same region. While New Zealand does\nshare elements of culture with its colonizer \u2013 the United Kingdom, New Zealand is thousands of miles distant from\nthe UK; thus, these two lands must not belong to the same region.\nOccasionally, a country meet the threshold of adjacency, but is not a good match in many elements of the\nphysical and human landscapes. It seems like this country should fit, but it doesn\u2019t fit well. In this case, the\nregional geographer must consider whether or not there are other possible regions that could include this ill-\nfitting country. If there is no other regional fit, then the country must be included in the adjacent region, even if\nawkwardly. For example, in many ways Israel is not similar to other countries of the Middle East; however, it is\nunreasonable or even ridiculous to include Israel in other regions; therefore, Israel must be fitted into the Middle\nEast as a region.\nCreating regions is not a simple task, but the study of Regional Geography is fascinating. Learning everything\nabout the people and places of a region is a great and enjoyable challenge.\nTo complete the picture of Geography, we can add two overlays. One case is place identification. In all cases\nof Geography and certainly in Regional Geography, knowing where places are located is valuable. Perhaps\nexpressed through map quizzes, locational awareness can affect choices of policy and action.\nAnother overlay on top of Geography is cartography. Geographers use maps in all sorts of ways, in all sorts of\nsub-field, and inherently in Regional Geography. While people have been making maps for thousands of years, the\ncontemporary approach to mapmaking is Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS creates maps, but also uses\nvarious techniques within the computer software in order to develop answers to questions and to demonstrate\npatterns and solutions.\nThus, Regional Geography uses maps, rules, and geographic patterns of people and places to create coherent\nregions melding similarities together. WHAT IS REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY? 7\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThis textbook is about Regional Geography, but for Geography as a whole, here are two definitions that we like.\n1. \u201cGeography is the art and science of location.\u201d \u2013 George Demko\n2. \u201cGeography is the study of the spatial distribution of phenomena.\u201d CHAPTER 3\nCultural Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\n\u201cThe study of geography is about more than just memorizing places on a map. It\u2019s about understanding the\ncomplexity of our world, appreciating the diversity of cultures that exists across continents. And in the end, it\u2019s\nabout using all that knowledge to help bridge divides and bring people together. \u201c\n\u2022 Barack Obama\nThe term culture refers to collective, learned human behavior. It\nis \u201ccollective\u201d in that is shared among a group of people. Individuals\nhave a personality. A group shares a culture. It is also \u201clearned,\u201d as\nopposed to being instinctive. All humans, for example, must eat.\nThat is instinctive. What we eat, when we eat, how we eat, and who\nwe eat with, however, is learned.\nSome cultural behavior is learned formally, in schools, from\nbooks, or in temples, churches, or mosques. Much of it is learned\ninformally, such as the rules of behavior instilled in us by family and\ncommunity. Much culture, however, is learned subconsciously.\nFrom a very young age, humans absorb the behavior of those\nThe Louvre Art Museum in Paris \u2014 Photo by Alex around them and imitate it. Put simply, culture is what a person\nHolyoake on Unsplash considers to be \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. This is why travelers to foreign\nlands often experience \u201cculture shock\u201d when they discover that\ntheir normal behavior is perhaps not so normal after all.\nCultural geography is an examination of the spatial variation in cultural traits, and the effect of culture on\nparticular places. All of the world\u2019s cultural variations would take more than a lifetime to discover. In this book, we\nwill focus on three fundamental elements of culture \u2013 religion, language, and ethnicity.\nRELIGION\n8 CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 9\nA religion is a set of spiritual beliefs and practices shared by a\ngroup of people. Many religions seek to understand the origin of existence, to comprehend the meaning of life,\nto decide what actions are moral or immoral, to explain what happens when we die, and to answer many more\nmoral and existential questions.\nThe world\u2019s four largest religions \u2013 Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism \u2013 collectively account for more\nthan three-quarters of the world\u2019s population. These and other religions will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\nA religious sect or denomination is a subset of a particular religion. While various sects or denominations may\nagree on fundamental issues of their faith, they may interpret it in very different ways. In Europe, for example,\nChristianity is divided into three primary sects: Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant. Some sects or\ndenominations are further subdivided into yet more subsets, such as the Protestant fragmentation into Lutheran,\nAnglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist traditions, to name just a few.\nA universalizing religion is one that actively seeks or accepts new members through conversion. An ethnic\nreligion is one that does not actively seek out new converts. Such distinctions have an important impact on the\ngeography of a religion. An example can be found in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the three related faiths\nknown as the \u201cAbrahamic\u201d religions. The first to evolve was Judaism. Judaism is an ethnic faith. Although it is\npossible for non-Jews to convert and join most sects of Judaism, this is not something that Jews actively seek\nout. Put simply, one is usually either born Jewish, or one is not. By contrast, Judaism\u2019s two Abrahamic relatives,\nChristianity and Islam, are universalizing religions. Christians and Muslims believe that their faiths are universal,\nand apply to all of humanity. Both have a long history of actively seeking out new converts. As a result, Judaism\ntoday accounts for less than one-half of one percent of the world\u2019s population, while Christianity and Islam\ncollectively account for more than half the world\u2019s population.\nSecularism refers to belief systems that do not fit into the conventional definition of religion. Among the world\u2019s\nsecular population, some identify with atheism, which is the disbelief in the existence of a god or gods, or similar\nsupernatural phenomena. Others identify with agnosticism, the belief that the existence of a god or gods can\nbe neither proven nor disproven. Some simply identify as nonreligious, meaning that they do not adhere to any\nparticular religion.\nLANGUAGE 10 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA language is a mutually agreed-upon system of communication. A dialect is a variation within a language.\nSpeakers of different dialects may pronounce certain words differently, and may use entirely different words\nto describe the same object, idea, or action. Still, speakers of different dialects of the same language would\nstill be able to read the same words, and carry on at least a basic conversation. In other words, despite their\ndifferences, mutual comprehension is still possible. Speakers of two different languages, however, cannot carry on\na conversation. This lack of mutual comprehension is what distinguishes separate languages from one another.\nMost languages are members of a language family. A language family consists of a number of languages\nthat have a common ancestral language, and thus share some common traits. An example is the Indo-European\nlanguage family, which originated about 10,000 years ago in what is now Turkey. As this Indo-European language\ndiffused from its place of origin, it evolved into many separate dialects, and eventually into many separate\nlanguages. Today, nearly half the world\u2019s population speak a descendant of the original Indo-European language.\nMany language families include sub-families, sets of closely related languages within the larger family. Examples\nof sub-families within the Indo-European family include Germanic languages (German, Dutch, English, Swedish,\nNorwegian, Danish, Icelandic), Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainians, Belarusian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Serbo-\nCroatian, Slovene), and Romance languages (Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Romanian).\nOther prominent language families include the Sino-Tibetan family (which includes languages of China and\nBurma), the Niger-Congo family (which includes languages of Sub-Saharan Africa), the Afro-Asiatic family (which\nincludes languages of North Africa and Southwest Asia, notably Arabic), and the Turkic family (which includes\nTurkish and languages of Central Asia).\nA political, economic, or social environment that features speakers CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY 11\nof many different languages often necessitates the use of a lingua franca. A lingua franca is a language adopted\nas a common means of communication among speakers of other, different languages. India, for example, is home\nto ten different major languages, and many more minor ones. Although English is spoken as a first language\nby relatively few Indians, it is a common second language for many, and often serves as the lingua franca of\neconomics, academics, politics, and the media. English serves a similar function in Nigeria, as does French in much\nof West Africa.\nRACE AND ETHNICITY\nThe terms \u201crace\u201d and \u201cethnicity\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they are not synonymous with one another.\nRace is a term that has historically been used to describe physical variations among human populations. The\nconcept of race is problematic in many ways, not the least of which are the racial biases and discriminations\nthat have afflicted human history, and that persist today. It is also scientifically problematic. The term \u201crace\u201d\nimplies that humans can be easily separated into tidy biological categories, which is not actually possible. Race is\na cultural construct, not a biological fact. While a person\u2019s ancestral background may influence their height, skin\ncolor, hair color, eye color, and other physical features, the idea that \u201crace\u201d affects human thinking and behavior\nis scientifically inaccurate. That said, as long as humans continue to assign meaning to race, it will remain an\nimportant element of human cultural identity, whether it should or not.\nEthnicity is a cultural term. It refers to a person\u2019s fundamental cultural identity (and is closely related to the\nterm nationality). While a person\u2019s ethnicity certainly does not determine their behavior, it may have a significant\ninfluence, since a person\u2019s ethnic background often influences what they consider to be culturally \u201cnormal.\u201d A\nperson\u2019s ethnicity may influence where they live, their social circle, their profession, who they marry, what they\neat, their religious and political beliefs, and much more.\nOne\u2019s ethnic identity can be formed by many different traits. Shared physical characteristics, shared ancestry,\nshared customs and experiences, shared language, and shared religion are examples of common bonds within\nethnic groups.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww?? 12 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe term \u201clingua franca\u201d means \u201clanguage of the Franks.\u201d It originated in the Ottoman Empire during the late medieval period, when the\nOttomans referred to western Europeans as \u201cFranks.\u201d The original \u201clingua franca\u201d was a trade language between by Italian and Ottoman\nmerchants. It was basic Italian, with a number of words borrowed from French, Greek, Turkish, Arabic, and Spanish. CHAPTER 4\nEconomic Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\nEconomic geography is the study of the spatial dynamics of the economy, and the role that economic forces play\nin shaping places. Some key economic themes in world regional geography include economic activity, economic\ndevelopment, economic power, globalization, and trade.\nECONOMIC SECTORS\nThe world\u2019s population is engaged in thousands of different kinds\nof businesses and occupations, but most economic activity can be placed in one of four sectors. The primary\nsector of the economy involves the extraction of raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, fishing, and the timber\nindustry. The secondary sector of the economy is manufacturing, and includes the production of relatively simple\nproducts, such as cloth or copper wire, to far more complex goods, such as cars, electronics, or aircraft. The\ntertiary sector of the economy is the service sector, in which workers provide a service to consumers. Examples\nof the tertiary sector include transportation, retail, entertainment, and tourism. The quaternary sector is the\ninformation sector, and involves the generation, dissemination, management, and interpretation of information.\nExamples of the quaternary sector include finance, research, publishing, media, and education.\n13 14 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nDEVELOPMENT\nEconomic development refers to the material conditions of people in a particular place. There are some countries\nwith generally high standards of living. These More Developed Countries (MDCs) feature low poverty rates, low\nrates of unemployment, high levels of education, high incomes, long life expectancies, and opportunity for upward\nmobility. The United States, Canada, most of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Australia\nare examples of MDCs. Other countries have generally low standards of living. These Less Developed Countries\n(LDCs), tend to feature higher rates of poverty and unemployment, lower incomes and levels of education, shorter\nlife expectancies, and fewer opportunities for upward mobility. Some regions that feature numerous LDCs include\nSub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.\nIt is important to think of MDCs and LDCs as ends of a spectrum of development, rather than as two distinctly\nseparate categories. Some very wealthy countries, such as Norway, Canada, and Japan, are obviously located on\nthe more-developed end of the spectrum. Some very poor countries, such as Niger, Yemen, and Cambodia, are\nobviously located on the less-developed end of the spectrum. Other countries, however, can be somewhat difficult\nto categorize. One example of an \u201cin-between\u201d country is Mexico. When compared to two of its neighbors, it could\nbe labeled as either an MDC or LDC. Mexico has a relatively low standard of living when compared to the United\nStates, but has a relatively high standard of living when compared to Haiti. Similarly, Turkey, which straddles the\nborder between Europe and Southwest Asia, is relatively poor by European standards, but relatively rich when\ncompared to its Asian neighbors. It also important to remember that significant developmental differences often\nexist within countries as well. Even the poorest countries on earth contain some very wealthy individuals, and even\nthe world\u2019s wealthiest countries often contain significant populations who are relatively poor.\nMMeeaassuurriinngg DDeevveellooppmmeenntt\nIn the regional overviews, we will examine the development differences among countries and some of the causes\nof those differences. There are many different ways of measuring economic development. A common one is per\ncapita GNI. Gross National Income (GNI) is the combined annual income of all citizens in a country. Per capita\nGNI is determined by dividing a country\u2019s GNI by its population. (The term \u201cper capita\u201d means \u201cper person,\u201d or,\nliterally, \u201cper head.\u201d) The resulting number reflects the number of dollars that each person in a country would\nreceive annually if the country\u2019s wealth was divided up evenly. Per capita GNI varies widely from country to\ncountry. The United States\u2019 per capita GNI is over $60,000 dollars, while China\u2019s is just over $18,000, which is close\nto the world average. Burundi has the dubious distinction of possessing the world\u2019s lowest per capita GNI, at under\n$800.\nPer capita GNI is a useful statistic because it is meaningful to most people. One can imagine what it would be\nlike to survive on $60,000, or $18,000, or $800 per year. The problem with per capita GNI is that a country\u2019s wealth\nis never divided evenly among the population. Significant income variations can exist among a country\u2019s regions\nand social classes, and can also vary significantly by age, ethnicity, and gender. For example, while $60,000 per\nyear may be close to the annual income for a good many Americans, a lot of people in the United States earn well\nmore than $60,000 per year, and a larger number of people earn significantly less. Here is a sampling of GNI per\n1\ncapita statistics. ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY 15\nGROSS NATIONAL INCOME (GNI) PER CAPITA STATISTICS\nCountry Gross National Income (GNI)\n#1 \u2013 Qatar $94910 per capita \u2013 2018\n#5 \u2013 Norway $70,530\n#9 \u2013 USA $63,780\n#12 \u2013 Netherlands $58,140\n#20 \u2013 Australia $49,440\n#32 \u2013 Malta $40,120\n#37 \u2013 Estonia $35,340\n#51 \u2013 Russia $27,840\n#70 \u2013 Mexico $19,870\n#84 \u2013 China $15,320\nLast \u2013 Burundi $780\nThere are other ways of measuring development. The infant mortality rate reflects the number of children\nper one thousand live births who die before their first birthday. In Japan, the infant mortality rate is 2\/1000. In\n2\nAfghanistan, it is 110\/1000.

Countries in the global economic core are those with\ntremendous economic power. Such countries are the drivers of the global economy, and set the terms of\ninternational investment and trade. Economic growth in a core country can stimulate economic growth\nthroughout the world, and an economic downturn in a core country can, likewise, cause economic stagnation ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY 17\nthroughout the world. Countries in the global economic periphery have much less economic power, and have the\nterms of international investment and trade dictated to them. Economic growth and decline in these countries\nmay have a ripple effect on other countries, particularly their regional neighbors, but these changes don\u2019t typically\nhave the same global ramifications that economic changes in core countries do.\nThe countries of the economic periphery are also LDCs, such as Yemen, Chad, Haiti, and Bolivia, and the\ncountries of the economic core are usually MDCs, such as Australia, the United States, Canada, France, Germany,\nSouth Korea, and Japan. It is possible, however, for a country to be considered both a core country and an LDC.\nChina, India, and Indonesia, for example, possess moderate to low levels of economic development, but are still\nat the core of the global economy because of the sheer size of their respective markets.\nGLOBALIZATION AND FREE TRADE\nOne of the most significant trends in the global economy over the last eight decades has been globalization.\nGlobalization refers to the unification of the world\u2019s economy into a single economic system. One could certainly\nargue that globalization has been occurring for centuries. Two thousand years ago, the \u201csilk road\u201d trade routes\nacross Central Asia were already connecting South and East Asia to the Mediterranean. Centuries later, global\ntrade would accelerate rapidly during the European age of exploration. Still, the full integration of the global\neconomy largely began in the 1940s, and accelerated dramatically in the 1990s. Globalization was enabled by\nthe development of rapid transportation and communications technologies, and has led to the evolution of large\ntransnational corporations. Accompanying economic globalization has been cultural globalization (the increased\nexchange of ideas across international boundaries), and a dramatic increase in international migration.\nOne cornerstone of globalization has been the emergence of free trade agreements. For years, many countries\nembraced anti-free trade measures known as protectionism. Protectionism is an attempt to block trade from\nforeign countries in order to protect domestic industry. There are a wide variety of protectionist measures, but\nthe most common is a tariff. A tariff is a tax or similar fee placed on imports in order to make them artificially\nexpensive and, therefore, less appealing. A country might, for example, place a tariff on foreign cars to encourage\nits citizens to purchase cars made in their own country, thus protecting domestic companies and their workers\nfrom foreign competition.\nFree trade agreements seek to eliminate such protectionist measures. A free trade agreement can be bilateral,\ninvolving two countries, or multilateral, involving many countries. One of the world\u2019s largest multilateral free trade\nagreements is shared by the members of the European Union (EU). Consumers and companies within the EU can 18 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ntrade across the international borders of the EU community with little or no restriction. In other words, it is as easy\nto trade between France and Germany as it is to trade between Illinois and Indiana.\nAdvocates of free trade cite multiple benefits. One argument is that free trade benefits consumers by giving\nthem access to a wider variety of products, and that it allows companies to access a larger pool of potential\ncustomers. Free trade also, in theory, allows each country to specialize in what it can produce most efficiently,\nand to avoid those economic activities at which they are not particularly efficient. Such efficiency, it is argued,\nwill lead to higher living standards. Put simply, as more countries embrace free trade, more countries will be\nable to specialize in what they do best, making for more efficient economic production, higher profits, greater\nreinvestment, more innovation, and higher overall standards of living. Furthermore, advocates of free trade argue\nthat it prevents conflict, since countries that are economically connected to one another are less likely to go to war\nwith one another.\nFree trade is not without its critics. Environmental activists argue that free trade encourages the shipping of\nproducts over longer distances, which increases the consumption of energy. Also, free trade can be responsible\nfor the shift of manufacturing and raw material extraction from wealthier countries with strict environmental laws\nto poorer countries with far more relaxed environmental standards. Similarly, labor activists argue that free trade\nencourages a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d in which corporations shift jobs from countries with higher wages and stronger\nlabor standards to countries with lower wages and poorer working conditions. Others are troubled that free trade\nencourages the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of the relatively few people who control major\ntransnational corporations. Finally, it is argued that free trade can lead to artificial economic specialization, in\nwhich a poorer country\u2019s economic \u201cspecialty\u201d is having low wages, poor working conditions, and high rates of\npollution.\nIn recent years, there has been significant pushback against globalization. Part of it is a reaction against\nthe environmental, labor, and social issues created by free trade, but also against cultural globalization and\ninternational immigration. One example is the emerging trade war between China and the United States.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nBrexit is the coined term for the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\n\u201cGNI per Capita, PPP (Current International $) | Data.\u201d 2019.

CHAPTER 5\nHistorical Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\n\u201cThe peculiar value of geography lies in its fitness to nourish the mind with ideas and furnish the imagination with\npictures.\u201d\n\u2022 Charlotte Mason, English educator and reformer, 1842-1923\nA place\u2019s geography and history are inseparable. Each world region has\nbeen shaped by its own unique historical forces, which will be discussed in the following regional chapters. Here,\nwe will examine some historical processes of the last few centuries that have had global ramifications.\nEUROPEAN EXPLORATION, INDUSTRIALIZATION, AND COLONIZATION\nth\nIn the 15 century, Europe emerged from the Middle Ages. The era that followed, known as the Renaissance,\nwas characterized by significant technological, artistic, scientific, and economic progress, as well as a shift from\nfeudalism to capitalism. This new economic system inspired European governments and a rising merchant class\nto seek faster trade routes to markets and resources, particularly those in Asia. In 1488, Portuguese ships rounded\nthe southern tip of Africa, opening an era of European sea trade with Asia via the Indian Ocean. Four years later,\n19 20 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSpanish ships arrived in the Americas, leading to the establishment of the first permanent European colonies\nthere.\nThis Age of Exploration would mark the beginning of five centuries\nof European dominance of global economics and politics. Portugal colonized Brazil, and Spain colonized much\nof the rest of mainland Latin America. Britain and France established colonies in North America, while Spain,\nFrance, Britain, the Netherlands, and Denmark colonized the Caribbean. These same growing European empires\nincreasingly controlled global trade, with a number of them establishing colonial footholds in Africa and Asia.\nThis era had devastating consequences for much of the world\u2019s population, notably the millions of Native\nAmericans who died as the result of warfare, displacement, and the introduction of Old World diseases to the\nAmericas. This era also marked the beginning of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, in which millions of Africans were\nforcibly removed from their homelands to serve as labor in colonial America.\nEurope, however, reaped enormous benefits during this period. Control of global trade, easy access to\nresources, and the colonization of the Americas flooded the coffers of European governments and merchants,\nmaking Europe by far the world\u2019s wealthiest region. Industrialization would further cement Europe\u2019s position as\nthe center of global economic, political, and technological power. Beginning in Britain in the early 1700s, the\nIndustrial Revolution represented a shift away from traditional production methods, in which manufactured\ngoods were produced in small quantities, and largely handmade (the term \u201cmanufactured\u201d literally means\n\u201chandmade\u201d). After industrialization, manufactured goods were produced in much greater quantities using\nmachines. Characterized by the rise of the factory and significant advances in metallurgy, chemistry, and\nengineering, the Industrial Revolution enabled Britain to produce goods at a scale previously unimaginable.\nIndustrial production soon spread to much of the rest of western Europe. Within a century, the region dominated\nglobal manufacturing.\nThe wealth and technology of the Industrial Revolution would create an appetite in Europe for yet more markets\nand resources, and it would also give Europe the ability to obtain them, this time through colonization in Africa\nand Asia. By 1900, those continents had been almost entirely colonized by European empires. Britain, France, the\nNetherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Russia were the leading imperial powers.\nFORMS OF COLONIZATION HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 21\nThe European colonies took on different forms. One form of\ncolonization was the settler colony. As its name implies, a settler\ncolony is one to which Europeans permanently migrated. The\nUnited States, Canada, southern South America, South Africa,\nAustralia, and New Zealand are all examples of former settler\ncolonies. Although these countries contain indigenous populations\nand people whose ancestors were not European, they are still\nsometimes referred to as Neo-Europes, because the socially,\npolitically, and economically dominant groups were, and largely still\nare, of European descent. Because many of the original European\nimmigrants to these places were farmers, they were interested in\nsettling in areas that had climates and soils similar to those found\nin Europe. As a result, the settler colonies were typically located,\nlike Europe, in the mid-latitudes.\nAnother form of European colonization was the mercantile\ncolony. While, Europeans did, of course, reside in their mercantile\ncolonies, these places would never become the permanent homes\nfor millions of European settlers. Instead, these mercantile colonies\nwere primarily exploited for their natural resources and labor. The\nmercantile colonies tended to be located in the tropics and\nsubtropics, largely because they could produce crops such as\ncotton, tobacco, tea, coffee, sugar cane, and other agricultural\nproducts that could not be easily produced in Europe. Examples of\nCartography by Steven Banas.\nEuropean mercantile colonies include British India (India, Pakistan,\nand Bangladesh), French Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos),\nthe Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), as well as much of China and mainland Latin America, and nearly all of the\nCaribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nMany mercantile colonies were formal colonies, directly controlled by a European empire. Some mercantile\ncolonies were informal colonies, which remained nominally independent, but which fell under the economic and\npolitical sway of one or more foreign powers. A prominent example of an informal colony was China in the late\nth th\n19 and early 20 centuries. Although China had a sovereign government which maintained a modest level of\ncontrol over its own territory, vast sections of the country were informally governed by British, French, German,\nJapanese, and Russian forces.\nOf course, history and geography often defy tidy categorization. Some countries, such as Canada and New\nZealand, are clear-cut examples of settler colonization. Others, like Jamaica and Nigeria, are prototypical examples\nof mercantile colonization. Some countries, though, are not so easily categorized. For example, southern Brazil,\nwith its history of mass European immigration, resembles a settler colony. Northern Brazil, however, with its\nlegacy of slavery and the mass export of tropical agricultural products, might better be defined as a mercantile\ncolony. Even the United States, a prime example of settler colonization, demonstrated some characteristics of a\nmercantile colony, particularly in the slave plantation economy of the antebellum South. 22 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nTHE LEGACY OF COLONIZATION\nth th\nMost of Europe\u2019s major American colonies gained their independence in the 18 and 19 centuries. A second\nth\nwave of decolonization occurred in the mid-20 century, with most of Europe\u2019s African and Asian colonies gaining\nth\ntheir independence. By the end of the 20 century, the age of colonization was largely over.\nStill, the legacy of colonization plays an outsized role in shaping the current global structure of wealth and\npoverty. By the end of the colonial period, most countries could be put into one of three categories: European\ncountries, former settler colonies (or Neo-Europes), and former mercantile colonies. Most European and Neo-\nEuropean countries are today generally wealthy. Most former mercantile colonies are today relatively poor.\nEurope\u2019s wealth is not surprising. The intent of colonization was to enrich the colonizer, not the colony.\nFor centuries, colonization provided European merchants unfettered access to cheap resources, cheap labor,\nand vast markets. It also filled the treasuries of imperial governments. Meanwhile, emigration to the settler\ncolonies allowed Europe to reap the benefits of industrialization while suffering comparatively little fallout from\nthe resulting population explosion. Even those European countries that did not build large overseas empires\nbenefitted indirectly from colonization. Sweden, for example, was never a serious imperial power outside of\nEurope, but Sweden\u2019s neighbors were. Wealth generated in British, French, Dutch, Belgian, and German colonies\nenabled merchants from those imperial countries to purchase more Swedish goods.\nMost Neo-Europes today are also quite wealthy. Although the settler colonies attracted scores of relatively\npoor immigrants, many of the initial European settlers were privileged, arriving with the advantages of European\nwealth, technology, and trade connections. More importantly, these settler colonies also had imperial ambitions.\nExamples can be found in three of Britain\u2019s most prominent settler colonies. Just as Britain built up wealth and\npower by conquering and subjugating indigenous people to exploit their land and resources, so did the settlers\nin the United States, Canada, and Australia. All three of these countries expanded across entire continents,\nconquering and subjugating indigenous people to exploit their land and resources, creating vast land empires of\ntheir own.\nOn the other end of the economic spectrum are former mercantile colonies, which account for most of the\nworld\u2019s poorest countries. While colonized, these places exported cheap raw materials to their colonizer, while\nimporting far more expensive manufactured goods from their colonizer. This, of course, put the mercantile\ncolonies at a serious economic disadvantage. Today, even though most of these countries have been independent\nfor more than a half century, many of them remain mired in the same economic relationship that subjugated\nthem during the colonial period. They still primarily export cheap raw materials to wealthy countries, and they still\nimport many of their manufactured goods. This is a situation known as neo-colonialism. HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY 23\nA notable exception in this era of European and neo-European dominance was Japan. Because of Japan\u2019s self-\nimposed isolationism from early 1600s to the mid-1800s, European powers were unable gain a colonial foothold\nin that country. As a result, Japan was able to avoid the pitfalls of mercantile colonization. In fact, by the early\nth\n20 century, Japan was joining the ranks of the world\u2019s most powerful countries by industrializing and building a\nformidable mercantile empire of its own.\nTHE WORLD WARS AND THE COLD WAR\nth\nAt the dawn of the 20 century, Europe was the unquestioned center of global political, military, industrial, and\neconomic power. Fifty years later, the era of European dominance was over, largely as a result of two costly world\nwars. World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) cost millions of lives, and left much of Europe in ruins.\nThe human and economic carnage of the wars left most of Europe\u2019s major imperial powers unwilling or unable to\nmaintain their colonial possessions. Although the traditional powers of western Europe would recover and remain\nwealthy, influential countries, they are no longer globally dominant.\nThe end of World War II ushered in the Cold War, a geopolitical struggle between two superpowers that\nwould dominate global political affairs for the next fifty years. The United States emerged from World War II as a\nsignificant economic and military power. Its ambition was to be at the center of the global economic order, which\nhad been dominated for centuries by a capitalist economic system. The United States\u2019 primary adversary during\nthe Cold War was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), commonly known as the Soviet Union. Based\nin the old Russian Empire, the Soviet Union was the world\u2019s first communist state. Unlike capitalism, which is\nrooted in private property and a free economic market, communism is based on the idea of communal ownership\nof property and the workers\u2019 control of the economy. In Soviet-style communism, the government controlled all\nproperty and means of production (farms, factories, businesses, etc.). Just as the United States wished to be at the\ncenter of a global capitalist economic system, the Soviet Union wished to be at the center of a global communist\neconomic system.\nBerlin, Germany, was often seen as the metaphorical heart of the Cold War. In the wake of World War II, the\ncity was divided into an American-affiliated capitalist west and Soviet-dominated communist east, eventually to be\nseparated by the infamous Berlin Wall. Berlin was a microcosm of Germany, which was similarly divided between\na communist east and capitalist west. Germany was, in turn, a microcosm of Europe, which was divided between a\ncapitalist West, aligned with the United States, and a communist East, dominated by the Soviet Union. This division 24 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nbetween competing capitalist and communist interests would soon spread throughout much of the rest of the\nworld.\nThe Cold War took its name from the fact that there was never a serious military engagement between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union. This was a very good thing, of course, considering that both superpowers\nwould construct nuclear arsenals large enough to annihilate human civilization. Nevertheless, the term \u201cCold War\u201d\nis misleading. Although it was fought with limited violence in places like Berlin, it resulted in plenty of bloodshed.\nThe Cold War would kill millions of people, most of them in what are known as \u201cproxy wars.\u201d\nA proxy war is a conflict in which the combatants are supported by larger, more powerful outside forces.\nA typical Cold War proxy war involved an American-backed, pro-capitalist government fighting Soviet-backed\ncommunist revolutionaries. In other cases, a Soviet-armed communist government would be fighting American-\nbacked rebels. From 1945 to 1991, Cold War-fueled conflicts raged throughout the world, with the fiercest fighting\noccurring in East Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa and Southwest Asia, Central Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean. American troops were occasionally involved in these conflicts, notably in Korea and\nVietnam, as were Soviet troops, notably in Afghanistan. But these wars were largely fought with American and\nSoviet money and weapons, rather than manpower.\nThe Cold War ended between 1989 (the fall of the Berlin Wall) and 1991 (the collapse of the Soviet Union).\nNevertheless, the last three decades have been deeply influenced by the governments, strategic alliances and,\nunfortunately, the animosities that were formed and shaped by the Cold War. It is quite likely that the next few\ndecades will continue to feel its chill.\nAMERICAN HEGEMONY\nIf the Cold War was defined by the clash of two superpowers, the post-Cold War era has been defined by the\ndominance of the one superpower that survived. In many ways, the United States got what it wished for. It\nemerged from the Cold War at the center of a global capitalist economy. Its political, economic, and military power\nis unequalled by any other country. This age of American dominance, or hegemony, may well extend through the\ntwenty-first century and beyond.\nStill, this unprecedented power is not without its liabilities. American military interventions, particularly in\nIraq and Afghanistan, have led to deep-seeded resentment of American foreign policy in much of the world.\nAdditionally, many Americans have grown increasingly isolationist, questioning the benefits of America\u2019s global\nmilitary commitments. And the United States\u2019 continued dominance is by no means guaranteed. A unified Europe,\na resurgent Russia, and an emerging China are all examples of potential checks on American power.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe United States Navy\u2019s dominance of the world\u2019s oceans was a decisive advantage during the Cold War. It permitted the U.S. to project its\nmilitary power anywhere in the world, and to protect (and sometimes disrupt) global trade routes. This advantage continues. The United States\nhas twenty aircraft carriers, more than all of the other navies in the world combined, and its total ship tonnage is twice that of China\u2019s navy,\nwhich is the world\u2019s second largest.

CHAPTER 6\nPhysical Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\nPhysical geography is the study of the spatial distribution of\nenvironmental features, like landforms, climate, soils, and organisms, and the processes that shape them. Each\nplace on earth possesses its own unique physical characteristics. Here we will look at some basic facts about the\nearth, and some fundamental concepts of physical geography.\nLATITUDE AND LONGITUDE\nAs anyone who has taken a basic geometry class knows, the location of a point is defined by the intersection of\ntwo lines. What is true in geometry is also true in geography. The location of any place on earth can be defined by\nthe intersection of two lines\u2014a parallel of latitude and a meridian of longitude.\nThe earth is rotating around an imaginary line called the rotation axis. The northern end of that axis is called\nthe north pole, and the southern end of the axis is called the south pole. The halfway point between the north\nand south poles is known as the equator.\n26 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 27\nA place\u2019s latitude describes its location relative to the equator, and\nis an angle defined by two lines\u2014one running from that particular place to the center of the earth, and the other\nrunning from the center of the earth to the equator. If you trace a line from Chicago straight down to the center\nof the earth, and another line from the center of the earth to the equator, the angle created by those two lines is\nabout 42\u02da. Because Chicago is north of the equator, its latitude is 42\u02daN, the \u201cN\u201d standing for \u201cnorth.\u201d\nThe equator is at 0\u02da. Everything north of the equator is in the northern hemisphere. As locations get farther\naway from the equator, their latitude increases. New Orleans, for example, is closer to the equator than Chicago,\nand is at 30\u02daN latitude. Minneapolis is farther from the equator than Chicago, at 45\u02daN latitude, halfway to the\nnorth pole.\nIt works the same way in the southern hemisphere, which consists of all areas south of the equator. Quito,\nEcuador, just south of the equator, is located at 2\u02daS (south) latitude. A little bit farther away from the equator is\nLima, Peru, at 12\u02daS latitude. Even farther away from the equator is Buenos Aires, Argentina, at 34\u02daS latitude.\nAs you move toward the equator, you are moving to a lower latitude. As you move away from the equator, you\nare moving to a higher latitude. The north and south poles are the highest possible latitudes, at 90\u02daN and 90\u02daS.\nThe equator is at the lowest possible latitude. Chicago (42\u02daN) is at a higher latitude than New Orleans (30\u02daN), but\nat a lower latitude than Minneapolis (45\u02daN). Lima (12\u02daS) is at a higher latitude than Quito (2\u02daS), but at a lower\nlatitude than Buenos Aires (34\u02daS).\nKeep in mind, the terms \u201chigher\u201d and \u201clower\u201d latitude don\u2019t always mean \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d on a map. New Orleans\nis at 30\u02daN. Buenos Aires is 34\u02daS. New Orleans is above Buenos Aires on a map, but Buenos Aires is at higher\nlatitude, because it is farther from the equator.\nParallels of latitude are lines that run east and west on a map, and that connect all places that are at the same\nlatitude. Parallels, as their name implies, are always the same distance from one another, and parallels decrease\nin length as latitude increases. The equator is the longest parallel of latitude. 1\u02daN and 1\u02daS are slightly shorter than\nthe equator. 2\u02daN and 2\u02daS are slightly shorter than that, and so on up to 89\u02daN and 89\u02daS, which are very short. The\npoles, at 90\u02daN and 90\u02daS, have no length\u2014they are points.\nIn addition to the equator and the poles, there are four other important parallels of latitude. The Tropic of\nCancer is located at 23.5\u02daN latitude. The Tropic of Capricorn is located at 23.5\u02daS latitude. These two parallels are\nthe northern and southern boundaries of a region known as the tropics. The Arctic Circle is located at 66.5\u02daN\nlatitude. The Antarctic Circle is located at 66.5\u02daS latitude. These two parallels are the boundaries of the polar\nregions, which extend from these two parallels up to the poles. All places that are not in the tropics or polar\nregions are known as the midlatitudes.\nLatitude\u2019s counterpart is longitude. While latitude has a naturally occurring reference point\u2014the equator\u2014the 28 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nreference point for longitude is arbitrary. The internationally agreed-upon reference point for longitude is based\non Greenwich, England, home to Britain\u2019s Royal Observatory. An imaginary line running from the north pole to the\nsouth pole, and passing through Greenwich, was established as the prime meridian in 1884.\nA location\u2019s longitude is determined by its position relative to Greenwich. If you were to start in Greenwich (or\nany other location on the prime meridian), and head due west, longitude would increase. When you got a quarter\nof the way around the world, you\u2019d be at 90\u02daW (west) longitude. When you got exactly halfway around the world\nfrom Greenwich, out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, you\u2019d arrive at 180\u02daW longitude. The same is true if you\nhead east from the prime meridian. If you left Greenwich heading due east, longitude would increase. When you\ngot a quarter of the way around the world, you\u2019d be at 90\u02daE (east) longitude. Once again, when you were halfway\naround the world from Greenwich, you\u2019d be at 180\u02daE longitude (which is the same as 180\u02daW).\nChicago is located at about 88\u02daW longitude, not quite a quarter of the way around the world from the prime\nmeridian. Honolulu located at 158\u02daW longitude, nearly halfway around the world from Greenwich. Heading the\nother way from the prime meridian, Baghdad is located at 42\u02daE longitude, while Tokyo is located at 139\u02daE\nlongitude.\nMeridians of longitude are lines that run north and south on a map. They connect all points at the same\nlongitude. All meridians run from pole to pole. Meridians are not parallel to one another. They are farthest apart\nat the equator, and get closer and closer to one another as they move into the higher latitudes. Meridians and\nparallels always interest one another at right (90\u02da) angles.\nIf you look at world map, you might discover that a several of the\n\u201crules\u201d of latitude and longitude don\u2019t always hold true. The parallels and meridians don\u2019t always intersect at\nright angles, the equator is not always longer than the other parallels, and the meridians might not converge\nat the poles. This is because the earth is a sphere. A globe will accurately reflect the rules of latitude and\nlongitude, but a flat world map cannot. Whenever you look at a world map, something is, by necessity, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 29\ndistorted. Direction, distance, shape, area, or sometimes a\ncombination of all four, will always be distorted to some degree, since its impossible to accurately display the\nwhole of the spherical earth on a two-dimensional surface. For instance, compare and contrast the world maps\npinning this paragraph.\nEARTH\u2019S MOVEMENTS\nThe earth is continually making two major movements\u2014revolution and rotation. First, the earth is revolving\naround the sun, once every 365.25 days (that extra quarter of a day is cashed in every four years for February\n29th). The major effect of revolution is seasonality, which will be discussed below.\nThe earth is also rotating on axis, turning eastward, and making\none rotation per day. This causes the daily alternation of day and\nnight, and causes the sun, the moon, and the stars to appear to rise\nin the east and set in the west. Rotation, coupled with the\ngravitational pull of the moon, also creates the alternation of high\ntide and low tide along the world\u2019s coastlines. The rotation of the\nearth also causes the Coriolis effect. As air masses travel through\nthe atmosphere, they appear to change direction because they are\npassing over a spinning earth. In the northern hemisphere, the\nCoriolis effect causes air masses to deflect to the right. In the\nCoriolis Effect. Photo by quapan on Flickr.\nsouthern hemisphere, air masses deflect to the left. The effect\nincreases with the latitude\u2014the deflection is greatest at higher\nlatitudes, and much less pronounced at lower latitudes. The Coriolis effect is negated if an air mass is travelling\nstraight down the equator.\nELEMENTS OF CLIMATE\nWeather is the state of atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, in a given place at a\ngiven time. Climate refers to the usual patterns of weather in a given place. Put another way, climate is the 30 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nlong-term average of weather. Most climates can be reduced to three basic elements. The first element is\ntemperature\u2014whether a location is relatively hot, mild, or cold. The second element is precipitation\u2014whether a\nplace is humid (receiving a lot of precipitation), arid (receiving little precipitation), or something in between. The\nthird element of climate is seasonality\u2014how the characteristics of temperature and precipitation typically vary\nover the course of a year.\nTTeemmppeerraattuurree\nThere are a number of factors that affect the temperature of a location, but the most important factor is sunlight,\nor more specifically, the angle at which the sun\u2019s rays strike the earth. Imagine you\u2019re standing in a dark room, a\nfew feet from a wall, holding a flashlight. If you hold the flashlight perpendicular to the wall, so that the beam from\nthe flashlight strikes the wall at a 90\u02da angle, it will create a small, intense pool of light. Now, if you tilt the flashlight\nto a 45\u02da angle, you\u2019ll notice that the pool of light on the wall gets bigger and dimmer. The same amount of energy\nis coming out of the flashlight, and it\u2019s the same distance from the wall, but the change in angle has caused the\nlight to spread out over a larger area, and decrease in intensity.\nBecause the surface of earth is curved, the sun\u2019s rays strike different parts of the earth at different angles. In\nthe lower latitudes, closer to the equator, the sun\u2019s rays strike the earth at, or something close to, a 90\u02da angle.\nThe solar energy is concentrated, like our flashlight pointed directly at the wall, so temperatures are hotter. At\nhigher latitudes, closer to the poles, the sun\u2019s rays strike the earth at a lesser angle, and the effect is like our tilted\nflashlight. The sun\u2019s energy is spread out over a larger area, the solar energy is diluted, so temperatures are lower.\nThis is why Sweden is colder than Libya. Sweden is at a higher latitude, where light strikes the earth at a lesser\nangle. Libya is at a lower latitude, where the sunlight strikes the earth at a greater angle. This is also why Minnesota\nis colder than Illinois, why Illinois is colder than Tennessee, and why Tennessee is colder than Florida. The effect\ncan be found at relatively small scales. On a typical day, Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs will run a degree or two cooler\nthan Chicago\u2019s southern suburbs, all because of the angle of the sun\u2019s incoming rays.\nSSeeaassoonnss\nThe major cause of seasonal changes is the inclination of the\nearth\u2019s axis. The axis around which the earth rotates is not perpendicular to the plane in which it orbits the sun. PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 31\nThe earth\u2019s axis is tilted 23.5\u02da off center, like a buoy listing in a lake. As the earth makes its way around the sun,\nthe northern hemisphere leans toward the sun for part of the year, and the southern hemisphere leans toward\nthe sun the other part of the year.\nFrom March to September, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun. As a result, the northern\nhemisphere stays illuminated for a longer period of each day, meaning that the days grow longer. The sun\u2019s most\ndirect rays also drift into the northern hemisphere, bringing greater heat. During these months, the northern\nhemisphere experiences spring and summer. At the same time, the southern hemisphere is leaning away from the\nsun. Days in the southern hemisphere get shorter, and temperatures decrease. From March through September,\nthe southern hemisphere experiences fall and winter.\nThe situation reverses itself from September to March, as the southern hemisphere tilts into the sun. The\nsouthern hemisphere has its longest and hottest days of the year, experiencing spring and summer. The northern\nhemisphere is now leaning away from the sun, experiencing shorter days and colder temperatures, passing\nthrough fall and winter.\nSeasonal variations tend to be the greatest at higher latitudes, while seasons don\u2019t change much in the lower\nlatitudes. Honolulu, for example, receives about thirteen hours of daylight in June, and about eleven hours in\nDecember, not a tremendous difference. Chicago, on the other hand, receives fifteen hours of daylight in June,\nand only nine hours of daylight in December, a much more noticeable difference. Anchorage, Alaska, receives\nnearly twenty hours of daylight in June, and only about five hours of daylight in December. Meanwhile, locations at\nthe equator receive about twelve hours of daylight every single day of the year. Places in the Arctic and Antarctic\ncircles receive twenty-four hours of daylight in summer, and twenty-four hours of darkness in winter.\nPPrreecciippiittaattiioonn\nPrecipitation\u2014rain, snow, sleet, etc.\u2014is an intensely complicated process. Very smart people with very expensive\nequipment still have trouble accurately predicting it. That said, the fundamentals of precipitation are relatively\nsimple. Almost all precipitation processes begin with an air mass being lifted. As air rises, it begins to cool down.\nAs air cools down, it approaches its dew point. If it does reach its dew point, the moisture in the air condenses\nto a liquid state, and a cloud is formed. If enough condensation occurs, then the water falls to the earth as\nprecipitation.\nThere are different mechanisms that cause the air to lift. Convectional precipitation occurs when the earth\u2019s\nsurface heats the air above it, causing that air to rise, and is most often associated with brief, isolated summer\nstorms. Frontal precipitation (sometimes called cyclonic precipitation) occurs when air masses with different\ntemperature characteristics collide with one another. A cold front is the leading edge of a cold air mass. If the\ndense cold air along this front collides with a warmer air mass, it forces the more buoyant warm air aloft. Cold\nfronts are often associated with violent storms. A warm front is the leading edge of a warm air mass. If the buoyant\nwarm air collides with a cooler air mass, it will often rise up over the dense cold air. 32 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nOrographic precipitation is associated with highland areas. As\nair masses strike a topographic barrier, like a mountain range, the\nair rises, which can create precipitation. The side of the mountain\nrange where orographic precipitation takes place is known as the\n\u201cwindward\u201d side. On the mostly dry continent of Australia, the east\ncoast gets rain largely due to orographic precipitation.\nA side effect of orographic precipitation is the rain shadow\neffect. The leeward, or \u201cdownwind\u201d side of the mountain range is\noften much drier than the windward side. This is because air\nmasses often dump much of their available moisture on the\nwindward side, but also because air masses are descending and\nCaught in the rain in Sydney, Australia. Photo by warming on the leeward side, and therefore are less likely to\nNomad Tales on Flickr. produce precipitation.\nThe rain shadow effect can be found at relatively small scales, as\nis the case on many Caribbean islands, where the windward side of\nan island receives more precipitation than the leeward side. Or, it\ncan exist on massive scales. In the American West, the Sierra\nNevada, Cascade, and Rocky Mountains cast rain shadows that\nextend for hundreds of miles.\nGGlloobbaall PPrreessssuurree SSyysstteemmss\nVariations in air pressure are the means by which air masses are\nmoved about the earth. Air pressure is the amount of atmospheric Eastern Washington, the dry side of the Cascade\nmass exerted on the earth\u2019s surface, and it varies from place to Mountains. Photo by thomas alan on Flickr.\nplace. Put simply, if there is higher air pressure in Phoenix than in\nDes Moines, then there is literally more air in Phoenix than in Des\nMoines.\nAir flows from areas of high pressure toward areas of low pressure, and is manifested as wind. If the difference\nin pressure between two places is great, then the air will move faster, as in a gusty wind. If the difference in air\npressure between to places is slight, then the air will move slowly, as in a gentle breeze. Because air moves away\nfrom areas of high pressure, reducing the chances of collision and lifting, those places tend to be relatively dry.\nBecause air is drawn toward areas of low pressure, increasing the chances of collision and lifting, those places tend\nto be relatively wet. In most places, air pressure shifts constantly, which is why meteorologists keep an eye on the\nbarometer, which measures air pressure. A rising barometer decreases the likelihood or precipitation. A falling\nbarometer increases the likelihood of precipitation.\nOn the global scale, there are a few major pressure systems that have a tremendous impact on the world\u2019s\nweather. The first are subtropical highs. The subtropical highs are a series of high-pressure systems that are\nfound at approximately 30\u02daN and 30\u02daS latitude. These massive ridges of high pressure cause dry conditions\nwherever they are found. A quick look at a map of the world\u2019s most significant deserts reveals that many of them\nare located at about 30\u02daN latitude, such as the Mojave, Sahara, Arabian, and Great Indian Deserts, or at about\n30\u02daS latitude, such as the Atacama, Kalahari, and Australian Deserts. Note that the subtropical highs are a periodic\nsequence of pressure systems, not a continuous belt of high pressure. Not all places at 30\u02da latitude are under\nsubtropical highs. New Orleans, for example, is at that latitude, and is rain-soaked much of the year.\nThe subtropical highs also generate enormous amount of wind. They push air off toward the higher latitudes, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 33\ncreating the westerlies. The westerlies are located between approximately 30\u02da and 60\u02da north and south latitude.\nAs the subtropical highs push air poleward, the Coriolis effect causes them to bend to the right in the northern\nhemisphere, and to the left in the southern hemisphere. The result is a circulation of air in both the northern and\nsouthern midlatitudes from west to east. Much of the continental United States, southern Canada, Europe, and\nthe Russian Domain receive their weather from the west, which has a significant impact on climate patterns there.\nThe subtropical highs also push air to the lower latitudes. In the\nnorthern hemisphere, these winds bend slightly to the right because of the Coriolis effect, creating the northeast\ntrade winds. In the southern hemisphere, these winds bend slightly to the left, creating the southeast trade\nwinds. So, in the southern tropics, air tends to flow equatorward from the southeast. In the northern tropics, air\ntends to flow equatorward from the northeast. The trade winds collide near the equator, in a region known as\nthe intertropical convergence zone, or ITCZ. The collision of these warm, often very moist tropical air masses\ncreates extremely wet conditions. Just as some of the world\u2019s great deserts are associated with the subtropical\nhighs, many of the world\u2019s great rainforests are found near the equator, such as the Amazon rainforest, and the\nrainforests of central Africa and southeast Asia.\nTwo more high-pressure systems, the polar highs, are located in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, creating very\ndry conditions. Antarctica, although covered in snow and ice, is technically a desert, receiving very little annual\nprecipitation. The polar highs push air off toward the lower latitudes, and the Coriolis effect deflects them to the\nright in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern hemisphere. In the polar easterlies, air circulates\nfrom east to west, usually above 60\u02da north and south latitude.\nAll of these pressure features shift seasonally. When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, they slide north.\nWhen it is summer in southern hemisphere, they slide south. For some places, this can cause significant changes\nin the weather. Los Angeles, for example, spends much of the year under a subtropical high, and receives very\nlittle precipitation. In the wintertime, though, that subtropical high shifts south. The westerlies also shift south,\nand carry a significant amount of moisture off the Pacific Ocean, bringing rainy winters to Los Angeles.\nOOtthheerr CClliimmaattee FFaaccttoorrss\nElevation has a significant impact on temperature. That is discussed in Chapter 68. The presence of absence or\nlarge bodies of water can also have a tremendous impact on temperature. The difference between maritime and\ncontinental climates is discussed in Chapter 41. 34 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nThe earth\u2019s climate has been changing for millions of years, with temperature periodically increasing or\ndecreasing. Fifteen thousand years ago, much of the earth was covered in massive sheets of ice, so it is obviously\nmuch warmer now than it was then. Climate change is a natural process. That said, when people use the term\nclimate change today, they are usually referring to anthropogenic climate change, or climate change caused by\nhuman activity. The earth is currently in a warming phase, but a preponderance of evidence suggests that humans\nare accelerating that warming at an alarming rate.\nIncreased planetary temperatures are associated with the\ngreenhouse effect. That term takes its name from greenhouses\u2014buildings constructed primarily of glass that\nare utilized to grow and sustain plants in cold climates. The glass in a greenhouse allows vital sunlight to reach\nplants, but prevents heat from escaping the building.\nIf you don\u2019t own a greenhouse, but do own a car, you have probably experienced the greenhouse effect. If you\npark your car in a lot on a sunny summer day, and return to it an hour or two later, you will likely find that the\ninterior of your car is extremely hot. This is because sunlight, with its relatively short wavelength, has easily passed\nthrough the glass in your car. As your car absorbs that energy, it begins to radiate it back off as thermal radiation,\nor heat. Because thermal radiation has a longer wavelength, it has more trouble passing back through the glass of\nyour car. So, light continues to pour in, but relatively little heat escapes, and the inside of your car gets hotter and\nhotter.\nThe same thing happens in the atmosphere. Instead of glass, there are greenhouse gasses, like carbon dioxide\nand methane. These gasses allow sunlight to pass through the atmosphere with relative ease. When the earth\nradiates heat, it has trouble escaping through the greenhouse gasses. So, the earth\u2019s atmosphere stays relatively\nwarm.\nLike climate change, the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon, and is, in fact, vital for life on earth.\nWithout the greenhouse effect, the earth would quickly shed its heat, and would be a very cold place. Humans did\nnot create the greenhouse effect, but we are enhancing it. By various means, but primarily through the production\nand consumption of fossil fuels, humans are pumping large volumes of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.\nIn doing so, we are amplifying the greenhouse effect. The more greenhouse gasses we put in the atmosphere, the\nmore heat is trapped, and the warmer the earth gets.\nClimate change has varied spatially and seasonally. Some places are warming faster than others, and some\nyears are hotter than others, but the earth\u2019s overall temperatures are certainly increasing. Of the ten hottest\nyears on record, nine have occurred within the last decade, and all of them have occurred within the last fifteen PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 35\nyears. Polar regions are being dramatically altered, since ecosystems based on ice and snow are going to be\ndeeply impacted by even the slightest temperature increase. Precipitation patterns are being amplified. Wet areas\nare getting wetter, while dry areas are getting drier, wreaking havoc on agriculture in many parts of the world.\nSea levels are rising. While it is unlikely that West Virginia will be oceanfront property anytime soon, coastal\nareas are experiencing increased erosion and dramatic flooding. Plant and animal extinctions are on the rise, as\nmany species have trouble adjusting to the new normal. Climate scientists vary in their predictions for the future,\nbut they generally range from deeply concerned to extremely gloomy. The vast majority of scientists agree that\nhumans must find a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions to prevent a global environmental catastrophe.\nPPllaattee TTeeccttoonniiccss\nThe outer crust of the earth is not one solid piece, but rather a collection of interlocking tectonic plates\u2014a sort\nof three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. These tectonic plates can and do move independently of one another, albeit\nat a very slow pace. Tectonic plates generally move about as fast as your fingernails grow. Given millions of years,\nthough, the movement of these plates can dramatically rearrange the world map. Brazil used to border Nigeria,\nPortugal used to border Greenland, India used to border Australia, and the United States used to border Morocco\n(their territories, that is\u2014this was, of course, millions of years before these countries actually existed).\nPlate tectonics play a major role in global landforms and natural hazards. There are a few different types\nof tectonic boundaries, such as transform boundaries, where one plate is sliding alongside another one, and\ndivergent boundaries, where one plate is moving away from another one. Of greatest interest to world regional\ngeography is the convergent boundary, where one plate is colliding with another.\nThe most important result of a convergent boundary is folding.\nImagine a throw rug on a floor. If you took a push broom and\nshoved it against the edge of that rug, the rug would wrinkle up,\nfolding into ridges and valleys. The same thing can happen to the\nsurface of the earth. About 80 million years ago, India began to\ncollide with Asia. Using our metaphor, India would be the push\nbroom, and Asia would be the rug. As a result of this collision, the\nHimalayas and many other mountain ranges folded upward, while\nvalleys and basins sank downward. This \u201cwrinkling\u201d of the fabric of\nImage by OpenClipart-Vectors on Pixabay.\nAsia is ongoing, and its effects have been far flung. India\u2019s collision\nwith Asia has caused the upward folding of mountain ranges as far\naway as Siberia. 36 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nFor a visualization of this imaginative metaphor, look here.\nConvergent boundaries are also associated with major\nnatural hazards. All around the Pacific Ocean is a zone known\nas the Ring of Fire. The tectonic plates beneath the eastern\nPacific are moving east, colliding with the plates that make up\nthe Americas. The tectonic plates beneath the western Pacific\nare moving west, colliding with the plates that make up East\nAsia. This collision has not only created numerous mountain\nranges along the Pacific Rim, such as the Andes of South Photo by Scott Campbell\nAmerica, but also volcanoes and earthquakes.\nAs one tectonic plate slips below another one\u2014a process\nknown as \u201csubduction\u201d\u2014the tremendous pressure involved melts the rock of the subducting plate. Some of the\nlava, ash, and gasses released by the melting plate find their way to the surface in volcanic eruptions. The Ring of\nFire includes scores of volcanoes, such as Mt. Fuji in Japan, Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines, and Mt. St. Helens in\nthe United States. And every time these tectonic plates slip, the surface shudders. If they make a significant\nmovement, the tremors can amplify into massive earthquakes. The entire Ring of Fire is highly susceptible to this\nhazard. Japan, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, the United States, and the Philippines are some of the most earthquake-\nprone countries on the planet.\nEErroossiioonn aanndd DDeeppoossiittiioonn\nTectonic plates are not the only forces that shape the world\u2019s landscapes. Two other important forces\u2014erosion\nand deposition\u2014are constantly reshaping the face of the earth. Erosion refers to forces that remove material\nfrom a landscape. Deposition refers to those same forces depositing that material elsewhere. Running water,\nfreezing and thawing, gravity, coastal waves, wind, and glaciers all pick up bits of earth, both large and small, and\ndeposit them someplace else. A river erodes its banks, ice crystals and plant roots break up rocks, gravity carries\nmaterial downslope, waves beat at seaside cliffs, wind carries away soil, and glaciers scour out lakes and valleys.\nAnd then rivers deposit sediment in deltas and floodplains, rocks come to rest in a valley floor, cliffs crash into the\nsea, wind-blown sediment settles onto the ground, and glaciers melt, leaving their eroded material behind.\nAnother name for this process is weathering, and different landscapes are at different stages of weathering.\nSome landscapes are at early stages of weathering, meaning that they are relatively new, and that erosion and\ndeposition haven\u2019t had much time to alter them. Other landscapes are at very advanced stages of weathering,\nmeaning that they are quite old, and have been deeply altered by erosion and deposition. For example, the Great\nLakes, and much of landscape of the upper Midwest, were formed by glacial erosion and deposition about 14,000\nyears ago. That\u2019s relatively new. A few hundred miles away are the Ozark Highlands of Missouri and Arkansas,\ndeeply eroded hills that are more than 200 million years old.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nMany people know that the Coriolis effect causes toilets flush clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 37\nhemisphere. Unfortunately, many people are wrong. Toilets do not flush different ways in the two hemispheres, and whichever direction they\nflush, it has nothing to do with the Coriolis effect. So, if you\u2019re planning to fly to Australia just to watch the toilets flush the other way, save your\nmoney.\nA fascinating book about the importance of longitude in the Age of Exploration is Longitude by Dava Sobel.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nalan, thomas. 2014.

CHAPTER 7\nPolitical Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\nPolitical geography is the study of the spatial distribution of political entities and systems, and the effect that\npolitics has on particular places.\n\u201cGeography should be the ultimate deciding factor for every political dilemma, for proximity to an ailing land is\nbound to result in one\u2019s infection.\u201d\n\u2022 Aysha Taryam, the first Middle Eastern female Editor-in-Chief of an English language newspaper \u2013 The\nGulf Today\nDEMOCRACY AND AUTHORITARIANISM\nDemocracy is a system of government in which political power is\nheld by the people, who form their government through free elections. Authoritarianism is a system of\ngovernment in which political power is held by a small minority, often against the will of the people. These are not\nnecessarily two separate categories of government, but two ends of a political spectrum. Some countries, such as\n38 POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY 39\nNorway, are highly democratic. Other countries, such as North Korea, are highly authoritarian. Many countries,\nthough, fall somewhere in between, with some elements of both democracy and authoritarianism.\nA full democracy is a country that regularly holds free, multi-party elections, permits political dissent and a\nfree press, and where the rule of law and individual civil rights are respected. Examples include the countries\nof the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Of course, many of these democracies\nare not without their flaws. Nearly every democracy has had some experience with corruption involving elected\nofficials, and sometimes free elections are not entirely fair. In the United States, for example, the electoral college,\ngerrymandering, and the influence of wealthy political donors are often cited as being somewhat undemocratic.\nA partial democracy is country with democratic institutions, but\nwhich has some undemocratic traits, such as weak opposition parties, rampant corruption, election fraud,\nsignificant limitations on free speech and the press, and frequent constitutional changes. Examples include\nNigeria, Turkey, Pakistan, and Thailand, which fall on the political spectrum somewhere between democracy and\nauthoritarianism.\nAuthoritarian governments come in many different forms. Some feature military rule, or rule by a single\npolitical party. Others are dictatorships or absolute monarchies, where political power rests with a single\nindividual. Such government do not hold fair elections, have little respect for law or civil liberties, and little\ntolerance of free speech or a free press. Examples include China, Russia, Algeria, Iran, and Cuba. Many\nauthoritarian countries are nominal democracies, or democracies \u201cin name only.\u201d In fact, all but two of the\nworld\u2019s independent states claim to be democracies, and some of the most authoritarian regimes regularly hold\nsham elections. It is said that nobody loves elections more than dictators, because the outcomes of those elections\nare predetermined.\nNATION AND STATE\nNations and states are the fundamental building blocks of international political geography. These terms can be\nsomewhat confusing for Americans. In the United States, we think of states, such as Illinois, New York, or Oregon,\nas pieces that make up a whole, which we often refer to as the \u201cnation.\u201d In the context of American politics, this\nusage is not incorrect. But the terms \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cstate\u201d mean something different in the context of world regional\ngeography.\nNation is a cultural term, referring to a large group of people who share a common cultural identity. For\nexample, the Japanese nation consists of all those people who identify as Japanese. State is a political term, 40 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nreferring to an independent government, and the territory it governs. The State of Japan, therefore, refers to the\nJapanese government and its territory.\nOften, nations and states share a geography. A nation-state refers to a state that is dominated by one national\ngroup. Examples of nation-states include Armenia, Egypt, and Japan, each where more than 98% of the state\u2019s\npopulation belong to a single national group. Some nation-states contain significant minority populations, but if\none national group is still demographically, culturally, and politically dominant, it is still considered a nation-state.\nExamples of nation-states with significant minority populations include Turkey, France, and Israel.\nA multinational state is state that contains two or more national groups, where no single group is dominant\ndemographically, culturally, and politically. Examples of multinational states include Indonesia, Afghanistan,\nNigeria, and Belgium.\nIllustration by Daniel Arrakis\nThere are some countries that fall somewhere between the definition of a nation-state and multinational state.\nSuch evolving nation-states often contain a mixture of indigenous populations and populations of immigrants\nand their descendants. The United States is an example of such a state. The U.S. could be considered a nation-\nstate, since most people in the country consider their nationality to be \u201cAmerican.\u201d That said, many Americans\nhave a \u201chyphenated\u201d identity. They are American, but also perhaps African-American, Irish-American, Italian-\nAmerican, or Chinese-American, to name a few. This ethnic diversity also makes the United States something of a\nmultinational state. Other examples of evolving nation-states include Canada and Brazil.\nFinally, there are also stateless nations. A stateless nation is defined as a large group of people who share POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY 41\na common cultural identity, and who occupy their traditional homeland, but who do not enjoy political\nindependence, often finding themselves divided geographically among multiple states. Examples include the\nKurds, whose homeland spills across Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria; the Yoruba, whose homeland is found in parts\nof Nigeria, Benin, and Togo; and the Palestinians, whose homeland is divided among Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Israel,\nand the Israeli-occupied territories known as the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nAUTONOMY AND SOVEREIGNTY\nThe terms autonomy and sovereignty both refer to political independence. If a state is sovereign, that means\nit has ultimate political authority within its own territory. In sovereign states, there is no higher political power.\nAutonomy refers to limited independence. An autonomous region is a part of a country that enjoys some political\nindependence at the local level, but which is still subject to a higher political power. Examples of autonomous\nregions include Scotland in the United Kingdom, the Basque Country in Spain, and Greenland, an autonomous\nterritory of Denmark.\nThere are some states, known as satellite states or puppet states, that possess nominal sovereignty, but\nwhich, in reality, are subject to the political rule of a foreign power. Prominent examples from the past include the\nSoviet satellite states of eastern Europe. From 1945 until the late 1980s, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,\nHungary, Bulgaria, and Romania were officially sovereign states, but they were, in reality, under the control of the\nSoviet Union.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThere are currently 196 sovereign states in the world. That number includes Taiwan, which is officially part of China, but which has been a\nde facto sovereign state since 1949, and Kosovo, which has been a sovereign state since 2008, although not all members of the international\ncommunity recognize its independence.\nIn Political Geography, the word ssttaattee,, meaning country, can be confusing for Americans who know that their country includes fifty states\n\u2013 meaning fifty political sub-divisions of the United States, a country. Thus, sometimes geographers will use the term State to mean country\nand the term state to mean political sub-division.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nArrhakis, Daniel. 2016.

It includes studies of population growth and decline, as well as the\nmigration of people from one place to another.\nGLOBAL POPULATION DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION DENSITY\nThe current world population is approximately 7.8 billion, and that population is very unevenly distributed among\nthe world\u2019s 193 independent countries that are members of the United Nations. The world\u2019s two most populous\ncountries, China and India, collectively account for over a third of the world\u2019s population. The world\u2019s seven\nmost populous countries, China and India along with the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, and Nigeria,\ncollectively account for more than half the world\u2019s population. The population of some countries is, by comparison,\nvery small. The Republic of Ireland, for example, has a population of just under five million, or about half that of\nthe Chicago metropolitan area.\nA useful statistic when examining population distribution is population density, which is the population of a\n42 POPULATION GEOGRAPHY 43\ncountry divided by its land area. This statistic is somewhat tricky when used to rank countries. Microstates, city-\nStates, and small island countries typically have high population densities due to the limited areas available. Cities\ninherently are more crowded than rural areas; thus, a country that is precisely one city is intensely crowded \u2013\nMonaco and Singapore, for instance. Therefore, if you exclude microstates, city-States, and small island countries,\nthen Bangladesh is the most densely populated country on Earth, with a population density of more than 3,200\n1\npeople per square mile. In contrast, Russia is sparsely populated, but as the world\u2019s largest country by area, it\nhas a density of just over twenty-three people per square mile. Remarkably, Russia, which is more than a hundred\ntimes the size of Bangladesh, has about twenty million fewer people.\nPOPULATION DENSITY OF SELECTED COUNTRIES\nPopulation Density,\nSelected Countries\nas people per square mile\nBangladesh 3277\nNetherlands 1316\nIndia 1202\nHaiti 1072\nJapan 898\nChina 397\nUnited States 93\nEstonia 81\nBrazil 65\nNorway 38\nRussia 23\nCanada 10\nAustralia 8 44 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nPOPULATION CHANGE\nA primary tool geographers use when analyzing population change\nis the population pyramid. A population pyramid is a graph depicting the distribution of a population across\nvarious age brackets. If a country\u2019s pyramid has a wide base and narrow top, such as Niger (https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/\nnigerpoppyr), that indicates that a large proportion of the population is relatively young. Such countries are\nexperiencing rapid population growth. If a country has a narrow base and a wide top, such as Japan (go to\nhttps:\/\/tinyurl.com\/poppyrJapan), that indicates that a large proportion of the population is relatively old. Such\ncountries are facing long-term population decline. If the pyramid resembles a column, such as the United States\n(https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/usapoppyr), that indicates that population is distributed relatively evenly across the age\ngroups, indicating slow or no population growth.\nRate of natural increase is a statistic that examines population change through births and deaths. It is\ncalculated by subtracting a country\u2019s death rate from its birth rate. A birth rate indicates the number of children\n2\nborn every year per thousand people in a country\u2019s population. The United States\u2019 birth rate is 12\/1000, meaning\nthat, for every thousand people in the country, twelve are added through births each year.\nBIRTH RATES OF SELECTED COUNTRIES\nCountry Region Birth Rate 2018\nAngola Africa 43.7\nAfghanistan Asia 37.5\nGuatemala LACAR 24.6\nSolomon Islands LACAR 24.5\nIreland Europe 13.8\nUSA North America 12.4\nGeorgia Russian Domain 12.1\nPortugal - lowest in the Western World Europe 8.2\nJapan - lowest in the world Asia 7.5\n3\nA death rate indicates the number of people who die each year per thousand people in a country\u2019s population. POPULATION GEOGRAPHY 45\nThe United States\u2019 death rate is 8\/1000, meaning that, for every thousand people in the country, eight die each\nyear.\nDEATH RATES OF SELECTED COUNTRIES\nCountry Region Death Rate 2018\nSouth Sudan Africa 19.3\nAfghanistan Asia 13.2\nCuba LACAR 8.9\nTuvalu Pacific Realm 8.4\nLithuania Europe 14.8\nUSA North America 8.2\nUkraine Russian Domain 14.3\nSolomon Islands - lowest in the Western World Pacific Realm 3.8\nQatar - lowest in the world Asia 1.6\nNatural increase is the comparison of the birth rate to the death rate. Births are added, while deaths are\nsubtracted to the base population. So, the United States\u2019 rate of natural increase is 4.2\/1000 (or 0.42% increase).\nAnother statistic used in the study of population change is total fertility rate, or TFR. A country\u2019s TFR is similar\nto its birth rate, and is based on the same data. Countries with high birth rates have high TFRs, and countries with\nlow birth rates have low TFRs. TFR reflects the number of children that an average female in a country will have\nduring her lifetime. TFRs vary widely from country to country. Niger has a TFR of about 6.35. Taiwan has TFR of\nabout 1.13. So, it is typical for a female in Niger to have six children during her lifetime. In Taiwan, a typical female\nhas just one. Again, microstates and similar regions may have exaggerated numbers, in this case especially low \u2013\n4\nSingapore = 0.84. The table below shows the high points of TFR for regions of the world.\nTOTAL FERTILITY RATE (TFR) OF SELECTED COUNTRIES\nCountry Region Total Fertility Rate 2018\nNiger Africa 6.35\nAfghanistan Asia 5.02\nSolomon Islands Pacific Realm 3.09\nGuatemala LACAR 2.87\nFrance Europe 2.06\nUSA North America 1.87\nArmenia Russian Domain 1.64\nTo maintain zero population growth, or long-term population stability, a country generally must have a TFR of\nabout 2.1. If a country\u2019s TFR is higher than 2.1, it is likely to experience population growth. If it is lower than 2.1, a\ncountry is likely to experience population decline. 46 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA country\u2019s population can also be affected by immigration and emigration. Immigration refers to the entrance\nof migrants, while emigration refers to the exit of migrants. The net migration rate refers to the difference\nbetween annual immigrants and emigrants per one thousand people in a country\u2019s population. The United States\nhas a net migration rate of 2.9\/1000, meaning that the U.S. gains about three net migrants per thousand people\neach year. El Salvador, by contrast, has net migration rate of about -8\/1000, meaning that the country loses\nabout eight net migrants per thousand people each year. Here are a sample of net migration rates by country\n5\n2015-2020. Oil states often have high net migration rates, as workers flow into the country.\nNET MIGRATION FOR SELECTED COUNTRIES\nCountry - 2015-2020 Net Migration Rate\nBahrain - #1 in world 31.1\nAustria - #1 in Europe 7.4\nCanada - #1 in North America 6.6\nAustralia - #1 in Pacific Realm 6.4\nChile - #1 in LACAR 6\nUSA 2.9\nRussia - #1 in Russian Domain 1.3\n\u00ca \u00ca Bottom three\nVenezuela - economic chaos -22.3\nSyria - war -24.1\nPuerto Rico - natural disasters -31.4\nTHE POPULATION EXPLOSION AND THE MALTHUSIAN SCENARIO\nThe graph of historic human population growth is often referred to as the \u201cJ-curve.\u201d It reflects that fact that\nhuman population has not grown at a consistent rate over the last several thousand years. Instead, human\npopulation grew very slowly for centuries and then exploded upward. This population explosion began in the POPULATION GEOGRAPHY 47\nth\n1700s, and accelerated dramatically in the 20 century. Human population is estimated to have been\napproximately 300 million in the first century CE. By 1650, it had grown to just 500 million. By 1900, it was more\nthan a 1.5 billion. In 1950, it was 2.5 billion. By the year 2000, it was over 6 billion, and is projected to reach nearly\n9 billion by the year 2050.\nSuch growth rates cannot be sustained indefinitely. Thomas Malthus, an 18th-century English priest and scholar,\nwas among the first to address overpopulation. Malthus noted that earth\u2019s capacity to sustain human population\nwas finite, and warned that unchecked human population growth would lead to a demographic collapse \u2013 that is,\nthe deaths of millions of people. In this Malthusian scenario, human population exceeds the earth\u2019s capacity to\nsustain it, and famine, war, or disease lead to increased death rates. Malthus argued for a positive alternative to\nthis population catastrophe \u2013 that humans voluntarily reduce their birth rates, leading to stable and sustainable\nglobal population.\nTThhee DDeemmooggrraapphhiicc TTrraannssiittiioonn\nThe J-curve and the Malthusian scenario raise two fundamental questions. First, what caused the population\nexplosion? Second, will the population explosion continue toward a Mathusian scenario, or will it eventually come\nto an end? Both questions are addressed by a population model known as the demographic transition. Go to\nhttps:\/\/populationeducation.org\/what-demographic-transition-model\/ to view the model.\nThe demographic transition examines birth rates and death rates in societies before, during, and after the\nindustrial revolution. There are four (or some say, five) stages in this model: the pre-industrial, the early industrial,\nthe late industrial, and the post-industrial. It isn\u2019t appropriate to put exact dates on these four stages, since\ndifferent parts of the world experienced them at different times. Great Britain, the birthplace of the industrial\nrevolution, began to move through this transition in the 1700s. By contrast, much of Sub-Saharan Africa wouldn\u2019t\nth\nbegin the transition until well into the 20 century.\nThe pre-industrial stage (Stage 1) represents the majority of human history, extending from the dawn of\nhuman civilization until the industrial revolution. During this stage, the vast majority of humans lived in rural areas\nand farmed for a living. Living standards were poor, and technology was extremely limited. Birth rates in the pre-\nindustrial stage were extremely high. It was common for families to have at least eight children, and many families\nwere much bigger than that. A primary reason for this high birth rate was the economic status of children. Children\nwere viewed as an economic asset. A child, from a very young age, could provide labor on the family farm. The\nmore children, the more labor. Additionally, children served as a sort of retirement plan, providing elder care for\ntheir aging parents. And in an era of extremely high child mortality rates, when a famine or epidemic could take\nthe lives of scores of children in a short time, parents felt compelled to have larger families as a sort of insurance\nagainst that possibility. Children were also relatively cheap. They were fed with food from the garden, not from the\nsupermarket. For the vast majority of history, farm children didn\u2019t attend school, and they didn\u2019t go to the doctor\nor dentist. There was no health insurance or college tuition to pay for. Factories didn\u2019t exist in the pre-industrial\nstage, so there were few possessions that parents could provide for their children, let alone afford. Additionally,\nthe reproductive window for parents was relatively long. People got married at very young age, and had children\nearly and often. Another major reason for high birth rates was the lack of modern contraceptives.\nWith such high birth rates, it is tempting to conclude that this was the era of the population explosion. It wasn\u2019t.\nRather, the pre-industrial stage represents the long, flat part of the J-curve. Although birth rates were extremely\nhigh, so were death rates. Even on farms, diets were often inadequate, and always at the mercy of the seasons and\nthe quality of the harvest. People also lived in comparatively unhygienic conditions, without refrigeration, treated\ndrinking water, or modern sanitation. As a result, people got sick more often, and there was no modern medicine\nto prevent or treat health problems. With the very high birth rates checked by high death rates, human population\ngrew very slowly, and sometimes not at all, during the pre-industrial stage. 48 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe beginning of the early industrial stage (Stage 2) was marked by the advent of the industrial revolution\nand all the developments that came with it \u2013 modern factories, modern agriculture, modern science, and modern\nmedicine. During this period, human population began a slow transition away from rural areas toward urban\nones. The mechanization of agriculture reduced the need for labor on farms, and the rise of the factory increased\nthe need for labor in cities.\nBirth rates during this stage remained relatively high. Although urbanization was underway, the majority of the\npopulation remained in rural areas. In the United States, for example, industrialization was in full swing by the\nmid-1800s, but the country would not have a majority urban population until the 1920s. Although birth rates\nbegan to dip slightly on the farms, they were still comparatively high, for the same reasons they were high in the\npre-industrial stage. Even in industrial cities, where having large families was less practical, family sizes remained\nrelatively large due to cultural conventions. Most parents from this era came from large families and, as such,\nwere more likely to have large families themselves.\nIronically, even though the early industrial stage saw a slight\ndecline in birth rates, it was the beginning of the population explosion. The population explosion was not\ncaused by an increase in birth rates, but rather by a decline in death rates. New technologies that accompanied\nthe industrial revolution \u2013 modern medicine (in particular, vaccines), improved sanitation, refrigeration, water\ntreatment, and modern agriculture, among others \u2013 caused death rates to plummet. As the gap between birth\nrates and death rates widened, the rate of natural increase soared, and population exploded upward.\nDuring the late industrial stage (Stage 3), the majority of the\npopulation shifted away from the farm to the city, technology\ncontinued to advance at a rapid pace, and standards of living\nimproved dramatically. In this period, birth rates declined\nsignificantly. A primary reason is a change in the economic status\nof children. On the farm, children were considered an economic\nasset. In cities and their suburbs, children began to be viewed as an\neconomic liability. In modern cities, children are no long able to\nprovide significant income for their family. Additionally, children\nbecome far more expensive. Health care costs increase. Children\nspend more years in school, and therefore remain financially\nHoniara, Solomon Islands. Photo by Adii Wahid on\ndependent on their parents for a longer period of time. Most\nUnsplash.\nimportantly, cultural standards for children rose, and parents were POPULATION GEOGRAPHY 49\ninclined to spend more money on them. Large families began to seem unaffordable. Accompanying this change\nin the economic status of children was a change in the economic situation of their parents. During this period,\nparents were likely to finish high school, and possibly college, before starting a career. And they often chose to\nwork for a few years before starting a family. As a result, the reproductive window for parents began to contract,\nand family size along with it. Death rates remained relatively low during this period. As the gap between birth rates\nand death rates narrowed, population growth rates declined.\nWealth and technology continue to grow during the post-industrial stage (Stage 4). In this period, agricultural\nand industrial output continues to expand, but the majority of the population shifts toward employment in the\nservice and information sectors. Birth rates continue their steep decline as children become very expensive, and\nas more people, particularly women, choose to complete a college education. Marriages are further delayed, and\nthe reproductive window closes even more. Cultural norms shift toward smaller and smaller families. While it\nmight have been \u201cnormal\u201d to have a dozen children during the pre-industrial stage, and perhaps four, five, or six\nduring the industrial stages, the new normal for children during the post-industrial stage becomes two, or one, or\nnone. Death rates remain low as birth rates plummet. As a result, population growth rates become very low. In\nfact, birth rates might even slump below death rates during this period, leading to long-term population decline. Is\nthis form of population decline a new stage of the Demographic Transition or simply a facet of the post-industrial\nstage? Some argue that a consistent pattern of more deaths than births marks something new, thus a Stage 5 of\nthe Demographic Transition.\nWhat does this mean for the future of human population growth? Some places, such North America, Europe,\nthe Russian Domain, and East Asia are clearly in the post-industrial stage, with TFRs already below 2.1. Other\nplaces that were rapid-growth regions a generation ago, such as Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, are\nexperiencing significant declines in birth rates as urbanization surges and cultural attitudes change. A few places,\nnotably Sub-Saharan Africa, continue to experience rapid population growth. Still, the global TFR is now about 2.5,\nand is projected to drop below 2.1 by the middle of this century. The population explosion, then, is expected to\ncome to a close by the end of the century.\nMIGRATION\nPopulation geography also examines the movement of people, and\nsignificant migration patterns will be discussed in the regional overviews. In general, the two most significant\nmigration flows in recent years has been from rural to areas to urban ones, and from poorer countries to wealthier\nones. 50 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nWhen examining migration, geographers analyze the migration decision, which are the factors that motivate a\nperson to move. Any time a person decides to change residence, be it a move across town, or across the country,\nor around the world, that decision is informed by push factors and pull factors. A push factor causes a person\nto choose to emigrate away from the current location. Some common push factors include high unemployment,\nlow wages, high rates of poverty or crime, land or housing shortages, war, natural disasters, or poor government\nservices. A pull factor causes a person to immigrate to a particular destination. Some common pull factors include\na greater availability of jobs, higher wages, a chance for upward economic mobility, better government services,\nthe opportunity to provide remittances (money sent back home to one\u2019s family), or, simply, a desire for a more\nexciting lifestyle.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nJapan\u2019s TFR is about 1.4, well below the 2.1 required to maintain population stability. Japan\u2019s current population of 126 million is projected to\ndecline to less than 100 million by the year 2053. This fact may force Japan to reconsider its long-standing stance against immigration.\nThe number of countries of the world, set at 193 members of the United Nations, does vary by other levels of recognition. Non-member\nobserver States \u2013 Vatican City and Palestine \u2013 could be counted. The figure of 193 does not include Taiwan, the island considered by some\nas part of mainland China. That number does not count Abkhazia and South Ossetia \u2013 see Chapter 86 \u2013 and several other regions generally\nunrecognized by nearly all countries of the world.\nDid you notice the numbers for the Solomon Islands in the birth and death rate tables? With a birth rate of 24.3, the Solomon Islands ranked\nhighest in the Pacific Realm, only 0.1 from being the highest birth rate in the Western World. This country has the highest total fertility rate\nin the Western World at 3.09. For death rates, the Solomon Islands did have the lowest death rate (3.8) in the Western World! These number\nmean that this country has a natural increase of 2.05% per year, quite high in population standards. This rapid increase may explain the islands\nmigration rate of -2.5%.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\nStatisticsTimes.com. 2019. \u201cCountries by Population Density 2019.\u201d Statisticstimes.Com. 2019.\nhttp:\/\/statisticstimes.com\/demographics\/countries-by-population-density.php.

Geographers examine the factors that lead to the location and relative\nsize of cities, and also the complex processes that shape the nature of individual urban areas.\nTHE HISTORY OF URBANIZATION\nHumans took their first step toward urbanization over 12,000 years ago with the development of agriculture. As\nthe domestication of plants and animals grew more and more sophisticated, a food surplus began to develop\nin some societies. This surplus allowed a few members of these societies to step away from agriculture and\ndevelop specialized occupations. The first non-farmers were likely political and religious leaders, soldiers, artisans,\nmerchants, and scholars. Whatever their occupations, they began to live in concentrated settlements around 4000\nBCE, and the first cities were born.\nA city was (and still is) a dense settlement of people working in specialized occupations. The rural area\nsurrounding a city is known as its hinterland. Hinterlands have long been focused on the primary sector \u2013\n51 52 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nagriculture, timber, mining, and other forms of raw materials extraction. The hinterland supplied these raw\nmaterials to the city, and the city provided goods and services for its hinterland. Over time, cities grew larger\nand more complex, as civilizations linked multiple cities and their hinterlands to form larger states and empires.\nSince the dawn of urbanization, cities have evolved into centers of trade, invention, commerce, education, politics,\nreligion, and culture.\nStill, for most of human history, the bulk of labor was needed in the primary sector, so the vast majority of\nhumans remained rural. As late as 1800, fewer than 5% of humans lived in cities. A century later, the global\nurbanization rate was still under 20%. But the process that would create an urban world was well underway.\nThe Industrial Revolution had two profound impacts on urbanization rates. The first was the mechanization of\nagriculture, which slowly reduced the need for labor in rural areas. The second was the rise of the factory. It has\nalways made good economic sense for factories to cluster together, which means that factories were best suited\nfor large urban areas.\nUrbanization accompanied industrialization throughout the world. The industrialization of the United States was\nin full swing by 1920, when its urban dwellers first accounted for more than half the population. Since then, the\nU.S. labor market has increasingly shifted from manufacturing to services and information, but these jobs are also\nprimarily located in cities. At the same time, jobs in the primary sector, such as agriculture, have continued to\ndwindle, furthering rural-to-urban migration. By 2010, the U.S. population was more than 80% urban.\nth\nThe rest of the world has followed the same trend. By the close of the 20 century, the world was nearly half\nurbanized. In 2007, for the first time in human history, more people worldwide lived in cities than in rural areas.\nSince more developed economies have more jobs in manufacturing, service, and information sectors, they tend to\nhave more urbanized populations. The five countries with the highest standards of living (according to the Human\nDevelopment Index) are Norway, Australia, Switzerland, Denmark, and the Netherlands. These countries are, on\naverage, about 84% urban. Less developed economies tend to feature more jobs in the primary sector, and are\nthus more rural. The five poorest countries on earth are Niger, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Chad, and\nBurundi. These countries are, on average, only about 23% urban.\nEven though less developed countries tend to be less urban, some of the fastest growing cities are found in the\ndeveloping world. This is because nearly all economies on earth are seeing a decline in jobs in the primary sector,\nand because the most rapid population growth is happening in developing countries. Two cities in Africa illustrate\nthis rapid trend. Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was home to just 450,000 people in 1960. By 2000,\nits population had swelled to 4.6 million. Over the next decade, the population nearly doubled, to 9 million. Lagos,\nNigeria, had a population of 230,000 in 1950. By 1960, the population had quadrupled to 1 million. In 2000, the\npopulation stood at 11 million. URBAN GEOGRAPHY 53\nURBAN REGIONS\nA city is as an area of dense settlement that falls within\nlegally defined municipal boundaries. Cities are often\nsurrounded by suburbs. Suburbs are generally\ndefined as smaller municipalities and settlements of\nmedium population density that are adjacent to a large\ncity, and part of its economic market. Some suburbs\nare primarily residential. Such bedroom\ncommunities are home to those who commute to\nChicago Skyline \u2013 Photo by Pedro Szekely on Flickr.\nwork in the city or in another suburb. Some suburbs,\ncalled edge cities, are more economically complex.\nThey are usually relatively new developments, and contain residential areas, but also the same kinds of economic\nlandscapes traditionally associated with urban centers, such as office buildings, shopping and entertainment\ndistricts, and even factories. A metropolitan area, or \u201cmetro area\u201d is the urban region occupied by a large city and\nits suburbs.\nA metropolitan conurbation (also known as a metropolitan agglomeration) is an area where two or more\nmetropolitan areas grow large enough to overlap one another. Examples of prominent metropolitan conurbations\nin the United States include the overlapping metro areas of New York and Newark; Washington and Baltimore;\nBoston and Providence; and San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland.\nA megalopolis is an urban region where several metropolitan areas and conurbations form a large, nearly\ncontinuous urban region. One example of a North American megalopolis is found along the lower Great Lakes.\nExtending roughly from Milwaukee to Buffalo, it includes such metropolitan areas as Chicago, Detroit, Windsor,\nToronto, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. Another megalopolis is located in the American Northeast. Sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cBoswash,\u201d it extends from Boston to Washington, and includes such metro areas as New York,\nBaltimore, Philadelphia, and Providence.\nSITE AND SITUATION\nA city\u2019s location and relative size are often determined by its site and situation. A city\u2019s site refers to the properties\nof its physical environment. A city\u2019s situation refers to its spatial relationship to other places. Examples of the\nimportance of both site and situation can be found in the northeastern United States. Four of the largest cities in\nthat region \u2013 New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore \u2013 are located on large harbors. These excellent harbor\nsites stimulated economic activity that enabled these cities to become important commercial and transportation\ncenters. But of all of them, New York had the best situation. Located at the mouth of the Hudson River, New York\nhad easy access to upstate New York and, with the completion of the Erie Canal, the Great Lakes. New York\u2019s\nsituation enabled it to tap into the growing economy of the Midwest. Its situational advantage over other east\ncoast cities is the primary reason for its eventual economic and demographic dominance of the region. 54 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nURBAN FORM\nA significant focus of urban geography is urban form. This is the examination of the geographic distribution\nof people, activities, and landscapes that make up a city. A city\u2019s physical environment may play a large part in\nshaping its urban form. For example, cities situated in lowlands will often take different forms than those situated\nin hilly or mountainous areas. The presence of a major river, a lake, or an ocean will also have a significant\nimpact on a city\u2019s form. History plays a role as well. Cities that have existed for hundreds or even thousands of\nyears will obviously look different from much newer cities. In some cities, newer developments are constructed\nseparately from older parts of the city. In others, some of the newest buildings rise alongside some of the oldest.\nCultural patterns will often manifest themselves on the urban landscape, with certain sections of a city bearing\nthe imprint of particular ethnic groups. Politics will also shape urban forms. In Europe, feudal governments, fascist\ngovernments, and communist governments all left unique urban imprints, and European empires left their unique\ncolonial imprint on cities all over the world. Population density is one of the most easily detected variations in\nurban form.\nSprawling Phoenix, Arizona, with a population density of about\n3,100 people per square mile, certainly has a different form than\njampacked Manila, the capital of the Philippines, which is home to\nmore than 107,000 people per square mile.\nProbably the most important force that shapes urban form is\neconomics. The heartbeat of a city is found in its trade, commerce,\nand manufacturing. The distribution of these activities, along with\nthe transportation networks that connect them to one another, and\nto their customers and workers, are some of the defining\ncharacteristics of a city. Likewise, the distribution of wealth, both\nwithin and among cities, plays an enormous role in shaping urban\nform. A wealthy city will, of course, look different from a poor one.\nPhoenix \u2013 Photo by Antoine on Flickr. Singapore, a rich city, is almost infamous for its fastidious\ndedication to tidiness and order. Poorer Lagos, Nigeria, would\nstrike many native Singaporeans as being absolute chaos. Of course, many cities are both wealthy and poor,\ndepending on the neighborhood. In some cities, the very rich live right alongside the very poor. In other cities,\nthere are distinct income gradients, with the wealthy living as far away from the poor as possible. Additionally, the\ntypical distribution of income relative to a city\u2019s center will vary from country to country. In some American metro\nareas, older industrial cities have fallen on difficult economic times, and are largely dominated by poor or working-\nclass neighborhoods, while the suburbs have become the domain of the wealthy and the middle class. Conversely,\nin many African cities, wealthy areas are still largely found in the core of the city, while the outskirts of the city are\ndominated by informal squatter settlements occupied by the very poor.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe words \u201cmetropolis\u201d and \u201cmetropolitan\u201d are derived from two Greek words: meter, meaning \u201cmother,\u201d and polis, meaning \u201ccity.\u201d The large city at\nthe center of a metropolitan area can be thought of as the metropolis \u2013 the \u201cmother city,\u201d surrounded by her offspring \u2013 the suburbs.

CHAPTER 10\nMedical Geography\nConcepts and Terminology\nWhat is Medical Geography? As we know, Geography often\noverlaps with other fields of study. This textbook is designed to present several of the sub-fields of Geography. As\n2020 marks the Year of the Coronavirus, it is appropriate to consider the sub-field of Medical Geography too.\nMedicinenet.com defines Medical Geography as \u201ca hybrid between geography and medicine dealing with the\ngeographic aspects of health and healthcare.\u201d Indeed, this is how Geography usually overlaps with other fields of\nstudy or endeavor, by examining the geographic aspects of that other field.\nThe medical geography of a population is affected by a variety of factors at any given location. In fact, it\nhas been said that the single most effective determinant of life expectancy in the United States is zip code.\nThat is not to say that the location of your post office influences your health and well-being. However, various\ngeographic features of your location (zip code) very clearly impact your health. These features include average\nincome, crime rate, pollution levels, access to medical care, and a number of other variable circumstances where\nyou live. Geographers study these sorts of things, often statistically determining relationships and correlations\nbetween life expectancy and other human variables, between rates of disease and levels of poverty, between\ncancer rates and pollution levels, and so on.\nAdditionally, Medical Geography considers the implications of demographic patterns on medical circumstances\nin a location, region, or country. The stages of the Demographic Transition occur in part due to advances in health\ncare, sanitation, and food supply. These contribute to lowering the death rate, thus triggering movement from\n56 MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY 57\nstage one to stage two in the Demographic Transition. By the time that countries reach stage four (and stage five)\nin the transition, their populations have grown old, as life expectancies increased with corresponding advances\nin medicine and agriculture. However, with older and older populations, medical needs change substantially.\nIn America\u2019s stage four, long term care facilities for elderly population have grown rapidly in number and\nsize. America\u2019s older population places pressure on the Social Security system and drives political debate on the\nhealth care system in the United States. Numerous European countries, some with more deaths than births, face\nnoteworthy challenges. Medical Geography examines these issues.\nYet the year 2020 brings more attention to Medical Geography because of the coronavirus. The maps that\nyou see in the newspaper or online show how Medical Geography uses GIS (Geography Information Systems)\nto display patterns of the spread of disease. GIS not only shows where outbreaks of disease are located, but\nalso can be used to predict sizes and paths of outbreaks. This link goes to a map was created using the popular\nArcGIS software and pictures current locations of positive cases of the COVID-19 virus in the Milwaukee area.\nhttps:\/\/www.arcgis.co\/home\/item.html?id=90194541588449b4bbd82b780fe33596 This map from May 2020 is\none example of many applications of GIS by news agencies and government organization.\nThe famous historical example of using maps to counter disease concerned the 1854 cholera outbreak in on\nBroad Street in London, England. Physician John Snow mapped the outbreak. The geographic patterns on the\nmap pointed to a waterborne disease contaminating a city water pump, counter to the contemporary belief that\ncholera was an airborne disease. The author Stephen Johnson chronicled this history very well in his book, \u201cThe\nGhost Map.\u201d\nNow the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) uses maps, of course; however, the CDC and current geographic\nstudy charts disease through the maps and analysis of GIS.\nSome scholars seek to divide this sub-field into two categories \u2013 Medical Geography and Health Geography.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nA scene in the Syfy series Helix showed a CDC official speaking inspirationally at a staff meeting in describing the resolution of the cholera\noutbreak in London.\nThe medical geography term vector borrows from mathematics. A medical vector is the carrier that delivers the disease, but not the disease\nitself. Thus, the mosquito is the vector that carries the disease malaria.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nJohnson, Steven. 2006.

So, what is the\nPacific Realm?\nThis course is a Regional Geography course. When geographers\ncreate regions, they strive to incorporate as many similarities as\npossible in order to develop a recognizable region, while keeping\nout differences. So, what are the similarities of the Pacific Realm?\nPhoRecall how we defined the Western World. We stated, \u201cIf a\ncountry\u2019s society speaks an Indo-European language,\npredominantly and historically professes the Christian faith, and\nborders another country in the Western World (or if an island, then\nis nearby), then it is in the Western World.\u201d\nSo, given that definition, we move to the Pacific Realm.\nObviously, the next required criterion is that the country or island\nPhoto of island in the South Pacific \u2013 Photo by\nmust at least border the Pacific Ocean, preferably is surrounded by\ndriver Photographer\nthe Pacific Ocean.\nOf course, by itself that simple Pacific criterion eliminates many\ncountries from consideration, but it still leaves in a number of countries that should not be counted in the Pacific\nRealm.\nFirst, we need to exclude countries that very apparently belong in other regions. The United States and Canada\nboth have Pacific coastal regions, yet represent their own region \u2013 North America. Russia\u2019s eastern border\nsplashes with Pacific waters, but Russia is the main piece of the region that we are characterizing as the Russian\nDomain. Chile and several countries of South America do not belong in the Pacific Realm region. Mexico and most\nCentral American countries have Pacific coastal areas, but along with South America are key parts of the Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean region.\nSecond, we must apply our religious and linguistic criteria. The Philippines has thousands of islands surrounded\nby the Pacific Ocean, has a dominantly Christian population, but does not have an Indo-European language. Out,\nthe Philippines goes to Southeast Asia. South Korea borders the Pacific Ocean and has a noteworthy Christian\npopulation, but like the Philippines, it does not feature an Indo-European language. South Korea is in East Asia.\nWe eliminate a number of countries with these tests.\n58 PACIFIC REALM 59\nWe do have an unusual situation with the island New Guinea. The whole island is the second largest island\nin the world, yet it is divided politically into two rough halves. The western side is the Irian Jaya or West Papua\nprovince of Indonesia. Like its eastern neighbors, the peoples there are dominantly Christian (about 83%), but as\nwith other examples noted above, this place does not have a main Indo-European language (although it has a\nfew hundred languages!). The eastern half of the island is the main portion of the country Papua New Guinea\n(PNG). Here 95% of the people are Christian, including a surprising number of Lutherans. Although there are over\n800 languages spoken in PNG, English is an official language. Thus, we do count Papua New Guinea in the Pacific\nRealm.\nAlthough PNG has a large land area, it is manifestly apparent that the areal leader of the Pacific Realm is\nAustralia. With about 25 million people, Australia also is the clear frontrunner in population size. Australia\u2019s\neastern coast and part of its northern coast feature the Pacific Ocean, though Australia also borders the Indian\nOcean and the Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean. Its historical links with Britain provided Australia with its non-native\npopulation\u2019s heritage, language, and religion. Although the early characteristics of Britain\u2019s link with New Zealand\nvary from those with Australia, again we find the British influence over the non-native population\u2019s heritage,\nlanguage, and religion. So, we easily add Australia and New Zealand to the Pacific Realm.\nAs you will read in the essay on Melanesia, geographers created\nthree sub-regional groups of the Pacific Realm \u2013 Melanesia,\nMicronesia, and Polynesia. These three island groups added to\nAustralia and New Zealand comprise the Pacific Realm. We also\nshould note that some of the islands of the Pacific Realm still are\ncolonial pieces of European powers; however, we still include them\nas in the Pacific Realm, at times with a footnote or asterisk\nexplaining their territorial status. See Hawaii, Easter Island, and\nFrench Polynesia for instance.\nHaving thus made the list of countries and territories of the\nPacific Realm, what else is typical of these places?\nPacific Realm.\n1. Colonial legacy. From biggest \u2013 Australia \u2013 to the host of very small\nCartography by James McGinty.\nislands, these islands are or were held by European or American\npowers \u2013 Britain, France, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, and the\nUnited States. 60 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n2. Tourist economies. Tourism is a big industry in Australia and often a key economic component of the\nisland nations of the Pacific Realm. Fiji, Tahiti, and others are well-known for tourism. Tropical beaches\nappeal to many tourists.\n3. Tropical agriculture. Given their locations, these islands often have the opportunity to produce\nagricultural products than cannot be cultivated in the mid-latitude locations of large agricultural regions,\nsuch as in the USA. Hawaii\u2019s pineapple crop is an example.\n4. Occasionally surprising natural resources. Don\u2019t count Australia in this category. The vast area of\nAustralia contains large quantities of a variety of natural resources. However, the modestly-sized New\nCaledonia has a huge store of nickel ore and other resources, quite out of proportion to its land area.\nth\nFor most of the 20 century, phosphate mining produced large quantities in the small island Nauru (from\ncenturies of bird droppings).\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe Pacific Ocean is the world\u2019s largest and deepest ocean. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan named the ocean for its calm\nappearance .\nAs seen in the map above, some geographers include the whole island of New Guinea in Oceania.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\ndriver Photographer. 2016.

College of DuPage GIS class. Instructor Joseph Adduci. CHAPTER 12\nPacific Realm: Regional Example\nMelanesia\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive region. A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared characteristics over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nSo, what is Melanesia? The Pacific Realm includes Australia, New\nZealand, and many other islands. Most of those other islands are\nquite small, with a noteworthy exception of New Guinea. However,\nonly the eastern half (a bit more than 50% of the land) of the island\nNew Guinea is in the Pacific Realm. The western portion is the\nIndonesian region of Irian Jaya. Melanesia has some of the largest\nlands among the Pacific Islands, not counting Australia (continent)\nand New Zealand (separate). The country Papua New Guinea, the\neastern side of the island New Guinea, is larger than all of New\nZealand and bigger than any other Pacific island. Melanesia as a\nMelanesia. Cartography by Cruickshanks.\nwhole totals one million square kilometers of land area. Of the\nremaining islands of the Pacific Realm, Melanesia does have most\nof the largest islands. New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Vanuatu are substantial; each is larger than\nthe big island of Hawaii (Polynesia). Tonga is similarly sized, a bit smaller, more like Oahu in Hawaii, but usually is\nconsidered as part of Polynesia, though some maps place it in Melanesia.\nNevertheless, the main reason for naming Melanesia as a sub-region of the Pacific Realm is not land size. An\nexamination of the landscapes of Melanesian islands shows mountainous regions with thick tropical forests.\n\u2022 Fiji \u2013 Mt. Tomanivi \u2013 4341 feet in elevation\n\u2022 New Caledonia \u2013 Mont Panie \u2013 5344 feet\n\u2022 Papua New Guinea \u2013 Mount Wilhelm \u2013 14793 feet\n\u25e6 New Ireland (separate island of Papua New Guinea) \u2013 Mt. Taron \u2013 7805\n\u2022 Solomon Islands \u2013 Mount Popomanaseu \u2013 7651 feet\n\u2022 Vanuatu \u2013 Mount Tabwemasana \u2013 6165 feet.\nPapua New Guinea features long stretches of mountains, along with extensive valleys between them. The\nprominent islands of Melanesia are not the low coral islands that are common elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean. As\n61 62 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ngeographers understand that the physical landscape affects, but does not determine, human behavior, certainly\nthe landscapes of Melanesian islands influenced the cultures of Melanesia. Perhaps the naming of Melanesia was\na bit prompted by the darkness of forested mountains.\nIn Greek language, \u201cmelan\u201d or \u201cmela\u201d means dark or black, while \u201cnesia\u201d refers to islands. So, Melanesia\nrefers to the dark or black islands. Again, this might have some reference to the physical landscape; however,\npredominantly the natives of these islands possess very dark skin and hair. Thus, the understood connection of\nthe place name is with the physical appearance of the native peoples. Of course, skin tone does not suggest a\nsingle culture. Instead, the cultures of Melanesia are diverse and numerous. One of the most striking features\nof Melanesia is the vast number of different languages spoken there. Papua New Guinea alone holds over 800\ndifferent languages, causing it to be Earth\u2019s most linguistically diverse location. Perhaps an ideal setting for use\nof a lingua franca, Papua New Guinea has Tok Pisin, an English-based Creole language, as its most common\ntongue. Certainly, the diversity of language there is related to the mountainous physical barriers that separated\nvalley or coastal peoples from other valley or coastal peoples. Historically and without modern transportation\nand communication, that separation over centuries caused languages to develop and evolve independently of one\nanother. The relative isolation of the Pacific Realm, in particular in regard to European exploration and settlement,\nled to belated understanding and discovery of the peoples of Papua New Guinea. Basically, it was an unknown\nland until 1840.\nIn sum, Melanesia is composed of relatively large islands north of Australia. Commonly, these islands are\nmountainous. The separation of these mainly dark-skinned natives historically created a plethora of languages\nand cultures.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nGiven that \u201cnesia\u201d refers to islands, for the other macro-level island groups of the Pacific, \u201cMicronesia\u201d means the \u201csmall islands,\u201d while\n\u201cPolynesia\u201d means \u201cmany islands.\u201d\nOne of the key locations for observation and analysis in the bestselling \u201cGuns, Germs, and Steel\u201d by Jared Diamond is Papua New Guinea.\nWhere would Germany rank among colonial powers? Certainly (not in ranked order) behind Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and the\nNetherlands. Nevertheless, by 1884 Germany did share New Guinea as colonial territory with Britain. Germany lost that territory due World\nWar I, but some of the effects of those years of control still remain today. Germany\u2019s Lutheran missionary work was successful, so that today\nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea holds nearly a million baptized members, cited as 18% of the citizen population of the\ncountry, second only to Catholicism.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCruickshanks. 2014. \u201cMelanesia.\u201d Wikipedia. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Oceania_UN_Geoscheme_-\n_Map_of_Melanesia.svg.

CHAPTER 13\nPacific Realm: Cultural Geography I\nAustralia as Melting Pot\nA melting pot is a metaphor for a population that assimilates a\nvariety of different peoples \u2013 ethnicities and races. Historically, the United States often has been characterized as\na melting pot society, though many question how well contemporary America fits into that model. More recently,\nAmerica often is characterized as an ethnic salad bowl. The salad bowl metaphor portrays a society where many\nethnicities are mixed together, but largely maintain their separate identities. Sometimes the salad bowl concept\nis described with a different picture \u2013 the mosaic. Overall, a multicultural country has a mixture of peoples\nand ancestries. Before modern transportation made international migration much easier, countries, especially\nin Europe, often had a homogenous ethnic population. Everyone in Greece was Greek and all Greeks were in\nGreece. Now 7% of Greece consist of non-Greeks. Now there are Greeks living in countries around the world. The\nmulticultural spectrum assesses a range of acceptance of the benefits of diverse cultural ideas and offerings, while\nalso looking at the levels of assimilation and pride in the majority culture and citizenship of that country.\n63 64 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nContemporary Australia likely is a better example of a melting pot society than present day America, less so a\nsalad bowl. This was not always so for Australia, as British exploration and settlement installed a powerful white\nracial advantage. Even so, it may be that Australia\u2019s geographic isolation helps a melting pot society become more\nlikely than a salad bowl.\nLong before there was a country Australia, there was a vast empty land. People crossed from nearby islands,\nso that now-called aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples sparsely populated the continent. Eventually, the\nBritish and other Europeans came to explore, but the British took over. Later a variety of peoples from across\nthe globe reached Australia, but were assimilated into the melting pot. Now multiculturalism has allowed more\nretention of ethnic differences, so that while the salad bowl metaphor has not been certified, it has gained ground.\nFollowing sea captain James Cook\u2019s exploration of the eastern shores of Australia, the British claim and\nsettlement of Australia famously began with the transportation of convicts from the Britain to this new land.\nOver time (1788-1868) more than 160,000 white prisoners sailed to Australia, accompanied by another 200,000\nfree white settlers who performed various roles in the creation of a new British society in an otherwise lightly\npopulated yet huge land.\nOf course, the native peoples had sailed to Australia much earlier, originally about 50,000 years ago, crossing\nfrom New Guinea and nearby islands. Numbering between 400,00 and 750,000 in population upon European\narrival, the aborigines were divided into many communities, speaking about 700 different languages.\nAs was frequently true throughout the world of conquest and colonialism, the British easily dominated the\nnative peoples in military might, seizing control of territory with little difficulty. Aboriginal populations not killed by\nbetter weaponry were decimated by disease and through habitat loss.\nThe large flow of migrants that next followed the stream of convicts to Australia was the gold rush. From 1851\nto 1861, about 600,000 people came to Australia to seek their fortunes. While most of these settlers were from\nthe British Isles, notable flows came from a few countries, including 42,000 from China.\nth\nNevertheless, the 20 century brought constraints to immigration. First, the so-called and now infamous White\nAustralia policy limited in-migration. For instance, for the first half of that century, Asian migration to Australia was\nbanned. Second, World War I placed several countries on the enemies list. An example is that Turks were barred\nas migrants to Australia until 1930. However, small flows of Greeks, Italians, and Jews did move to Australia.\nThird, World War II reclassified the enemies list. Now Italians were not welcome. After WWII, Australia graciously\naccepted refugees and displaced persons from Europe. This policy brought 171,000 people such as Estonians,\nBelgians, Danes, and others. As these migrants of those fifty years were almost exclusively white Europeans, their\nassimilation into Australians was not too difficult.\nth\nThe second half of the 20 century introduced reform to the White Australia policy, including its repeal and the PACIFIC REALM: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 65\nsubstitution of multiculturalism in 1973. Soon, people were arriving from a variety of countries around the world\nst\n\u2013 China, India, Vietnam, South Africa, and other lands. The 21 century has continued this pattern of a diverse\nrange of origins for migrants to Australia.\nWhat is Australia now? For Australia\u2019s current population of 26 million people, there are approximately 800,000\naboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people; accordingly, that is about 3% native ancestry. The Guardian reported\nresults of the 2016 Australian national census, that \u201cThe top five most commonly reported countries of birth\namong the 26% of Australians born overseas were England (14.7%), New Zealand (8.4%, down from 9.1% in 2011),\nChina (8.3%, up from 6%), India (7.4%, up from 5.6%) and the Philippines (3.8%). In the same news article, The\nGuardian also indicated that \u201cNearly half (49%) of all Australians were either born overseas (first generation) or\nhave at least one parent born overseas (second generation). The remaining 51% were at least third generation \u2013\n1\nborn in Australia to Australian-born parents.\u201d\nClearly, Australia\u2019s ethnic mix is becoming more diverse and colorful. Government and society have rejected the\n\u201cwhite only\u201d idea, replacing it with ideas of openness. So now, melting pot or salad bowl? That\u2019s not an easy call.\nHowever, Australia\u2019s relative isolation still may have an impact.\nGeographically, it makes sense that there are two main factors in affecting ease of or resistance to assimilation\ninto the majority national culture. 1) How easy is it to live within your own ethnic enclave and still succeed\neconomically? As different ethnic groups migrated to America, typically they initially stayed within their own ethnic\nenclaves, but as these enclaves were not large enough to sustain significant economic success and even the\nAmerican Dream, the second-generation and overwhelmingly the third-generation ethnicities spoke the English\nlanguage and assimilated into the American culture. As ethnic groups in America have increased in size and\nas globalization has increased economic opportunities with foreign connections, perhaps it is easier to resist\nassimilation in America. 2) How easy is it to travel to and communicate with the ethnic homeland? Again,\nin America when the first generation Irish or Italian or Norwegian migrants came to the USA, it was costly\nto travel back to the European homeland and costly to telephone home as well. Modern transportation and\ncommunication is much easier, so perhaps this too has reduced the urgency of assimilation in America. This is a\ngood geographic discussion, but some now argue that America is more like a salad bowl than a melting pot. 66 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSo what about Australia? Considering both of the factors in the previous paragraph, Australia\u2019s relative location\nsuggests higher likelihood of assimilation. 1) How easy is it to live within your own ethnic enclave and still succeed\neconomically? As historically Australia shows a very modest population, certainly it would be difficult for any\nethnic group of migrants to reach a critical mass needed to succeed outside of the main culture. 2) How easy is it\nto travel to and communicate with the ethnic homeland? Well, Australia is noted for its isolation and separation\nfrom the rest of the world. Certainly, as it developed through British colonization and its successor Australia\u2019s\ngrowth, Australia\u2019s position on the periphery of the world\u2019s landmasses made it difficult more migrants from other\nlands to travel back to or communicate with the homeland. For both of those factors, it has been overwhelmingly\neasier to assimilate, more so than in America even. Now though, as in America, the modern world of globalization,\ntransportation, and telecommunication has shrunk the world, so in Australia too it is newly somewhat comfortable\nto keep that separate ethnicity while mixing with the majority Australian identity. In both cases of America and\nAustralia, it seems that the movement from melting pot to salad bowl is a natural evolution, but more advanced\nin America than in Australia.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nA pure melting pot society is portrayed by the Borg in various Star Trek episodes. The Borg assimilate all other species, taking their\ntechnological and cultural singularities and incorporating these features into the Borg collective. The Borg mantra \u201cYou will be\nassimilated. Resistance is futile\u201d is presented as an ultimatum. In human societies, melting pot societies sometimes present varied levels of\ncoercion in assimilation.\nAustralia celebrates Harmony Week as they commemorate the country\u2019s cultural diversity but also its sense of belonging together.

CHAPTER 14\nPacific Realm: Economic Geography I\nExclusive Economic Zones\nWhose water is it? Because water is a liquid that flows and moves over and across the Earth\u2019s surface, it can be\ndifficult to determine the answer to that question. When trying to adjudicate rights over a river, often the midpoint\nof the stream, known as the thalweg line, is used as the divider. Even this may vary from what seems to be obvious\nto a point of contention, depending on whether the deep channels of the stream or its two banks are selected as\nthe points of reference. Coastline provides access to ocean waters, especially for island countries like Fiji, outlined\nin the icon to the left.\nWhen dividing lakes jurisdictionally between states or provinces or along international boundaries, again the\nmidpoints of the lake generally are the preferred border demarcations.\nBut what of open waters? Oceans, seas, gulfs, straits, etc. Here we have the United Nations Convention on the\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS), approved in 1982 by this international organization, entering into force in 1996. Initially\ndue to concerns over deep seabed mining, the United States did not join the treaty. Although reaching a separate\nagreement on deep seabed mining in 1994, the USA remains a non-signee, but acknowledges the provisions of\nUNCLOS by informally following the practices of the treaty.\nPrimarily, the Law of the Sea recognizes two essential jurisdictions that are integral interest of coastal countries.\nOne, as a form of safety and national security, a protected zone known as territorial water guarantees the national\n68 PACIFIC REALM: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 69\nright to restrict movement or presence of ships from other countries. UNCLOS establishes a twelve nautical\nmile zone of territorial waters, pushed from each country\u2019s coastline. Historically, countries or coastal peoples\nasserted control over their seacoasts but with varying means of control and measure. At times, coastal waters\nwere claimed as far as the eye could see. As a practical measure, one approach was to claim waters as far as a\ncannon could shoot.\nOccasionally, the open water distance between two countries is shorter than twenty-four nautical miles, thus\npreventing either country from pushing out to the twelve nautical mile standard. In this case of a narrow\nwaterway between landmasses, the definition of a strait, while given the frequent need for passage of cargo\nships (and even passenger vessels) through these straits, the Law of the Sea proclaims such passages to be\ninternational waters open for free transit. An example is the Strait of Gibraltar, where these waters connecting the\nMediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean are not ten nautical miles across at the narrowest. Similarly, \u00d8resund\nbetween Denmark and Sweden is this type of passageway.\nExclusive Economic Zones. Cartography by B1mbo.\nTwo, ocean water is not simply water. Oceans contain resources such as fish in the water, minerals on the\nsea floor, and oil beneath the seabed. Obviously, countries have vested economic interests in maintaining and\nsecuring rights to these maritime riches. The Law of the Sea delineates a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic\nzone (EEZ), extending outward from that coastline. Fish in those waters belong to that country. Manganese\nnodules on the ocean floor, petroleum below the ocean bed, and whatever type of resource there, all belong\nto that coastal country. Beyond the territorial waters, the ocean surface within the EEZ is considered to be\ninternational water; therefore, any ships have the freedom and right to sail through these waters. 70 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSome countries benefit more than others do from the Law of the\nSea. Landlocked countries by definition lack coastline and thus\nhold neither territorial waters nor EEZ. Countries with long\ncoastlines (USA, Brazil, Canada, Russia) naturally have expansive\nEEZ. Island countries are defined by their coastlines, thus having\ncorresponding territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.\nFor a small island country, its EEZ may hold much greater surface\narea and its land does.\nIn this way, countries of the Pacific Realm have rights to vast\nocean territories. Australia\u2019s land area is about 7.7 million square\nkilometers (3 million square miles), but its basic EEZ is about six\n2\nmillion km . Counting the EEZ of Australia\u2019s small islands adds\n2 2\nanother two million km . That eight million km exceeds Australia\u2019s\nland area. (This does not even include Australia\u2019s claim to an EEZ of\n2\ntwo million km that is adjacent to the Australian Antarctic\nTerritory.) In sum, Australia\u2019s EEZ is the third largest in the world.\nIt is safe to say that every island country of the Pacific Realm claims\ngreater areas of the ocean than they hold land mass. Usually, the\nratio of ocean-to-land is large; for instance, for the Solomon\nIslands, this ratio is 43:1. For New Zealand, the ratio is 14:1. In fact,\nNew Zealand has the world\u2019s ninth largest EEZ at four million km2.\nSometimes the ratio is extreme, such as with Nauru measured at\n7523:1.\nTrawler Base Road, Portsmouth, Queensland,\nNot all of the Pacific islands are wholly or parts of an independent\nAustralia Photo by David Clode on Unsplash\ncountry. Some islands still have colonial links. Of course, Hawaii is\npart of the United States. The American territory of the Northern\nMariana Islands has an EEZ that is larger than the American EEZ along the Gulf of Mexico. France maintains\noverseas departments and territories across the globe, including numerous islands in the Pacific Realm. All of\nthese holdings combine to give France the world\u2019s largest exclusive economic zone. Oddly, the EEZ of France in\nEurope is only 3.3% of the country\u2019s overall EEZ.\nGiven the prominence of fishing industries throughout the islands of the Pacific, the UNCLOS rights within the\nexclusive economic zones are financially significant, if not crucial, for the Pacific Realm.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\n2\nThe exclusive economic zone of the United States is dominated by Alaska. Alaska\u2019s EEZ is 3.77 million km , which is more than the EEZ of\nthe American mainland (West Coast, East Coast, and Gulf Coast) and the main islands of Hawaii combined. America\u2019s total EEZ is the second\nlargest in the world.\nIf the expansive exclusive economic zones of distant islands are excluded, as are any claims to Antarctic waters, then the country with the\nlargest EEZ is Russia. Perhaps this is fitting, since Russia has the world\u2019s largest land area too.\nThe Spratly Islands and the South China Sea around it host numerous jurisdictional disputes, even with UNCLOS.

BOLYANATZ\nThe Austronesian Expansion was perhaps the greatest human exploratory achievement until astronauts landed\non the moon in 1969. Over the span of a few thousand years, oceangoing horticulturalists in open vessels sailed\nacross hundreds of miles of open sea, and relying on courage, resolve, and not a little bit of luck, colonized islands\nacross the Pacific Ocean.\nIn some of their voyages, these seafaring farmers encountered people whose ancestors had already been there\nfor thousands of years \u2014 perhaps up to 50,000 years, as in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Melanesia. In other\nlocations like Tahiti, New Zealand, and Hawai\u2019i, these explorers were the first humans to ever occupy these lands.\nPerhaps a bit paradoxically, the Austronesian (\u201csouthern island\u201d) Expansion began north of the Equator, in what\nis now Southeast China around 5000 years ago (3000 BCE). This was when cultivators of rice, along with root crops\nlike taro and yams (who spoke a language that linguists have partially reconstructed and call Proto-Austronesian)\nrowed across the 75-mile-wide Taiwan Strait and began farming on Taiwan.\nFrom Taiwan, the diaspora moved south to the Philippines and then the islands of central Indonesia. By around\n1400 BCE, the southbound expansion forked into a \u201cright turn\u201d heading west and a \u201cleft turn\u201d heading east. The\ndescendants of those who headed west sailed across the Indian Ocean and eventually colonized Madagascar, just\noff the southeast coast of Africa. Those whose ancestors took the \u201cleft turn\u201d ended up discovering and settling\nmany of the islands of the vast Pacific Ocean.\n72 PACIFIC REALM: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 73\nThis \u201ceastbound\u201d group discovered and settled some\nof the islands of eastern Micronesia by perhaps as\nearly as 2000 BCE (Guam) and, hundred of years later,\nPalau. (It is striking that the archaeological evidence\npoints to these Austronesians on Guam long before\nthey were on Palau. This would have required a\nvoyage west from the Philippines to Guam across more\nthan 1000 miles of open sea.)\nOther \u201ceastbound\u201d groups veered more to the\nsouth. Tracking the progress of this branch of these\nChronological dispersion of Austronesian people across the Pacific\nProto-Austronesian speakers and their descendants\nhas been relatively straightforward. Many of them\nrelied consistently on an easily recognizable form of pottery called Lapita, known for being decorated using\nsomething like a comb. This makes it easy for archaeologists to follow the Lapita \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d and track with\nsome precision the timing and locations of the Austronesian presence from eastern Melanesia to Samoa between\n1600 and 500 BCE.\nHere is a photo of a fragment of Lapita pottery, as found in\nMus\u00e9e Maritime in New Caledonia. By 1300 BCE, Lapita pottery\ncould be found in much of the Bismarck Archipelago, and as far\nas the previously unpopulated islands of Fiji by 900 BCE and\nSamoa by 800 BCE. Also by 1300 BCE, rice-growing had ceased,\nwith newfound crops such as New Guinea\u2019s breadfruit,\ncoconut, and banana taking its place.\nUsing round numbers, these Proto-Austronesian-speaking\nsea-faring farmers had expanded nearly 5,000 miles in just\nover 2000 years. In the 2000 years starting with the discovery\nand settlement of the Samoan Islands, they would go nearly\ntwice as far in about the same span of time. What accounted\nfor the rapid acceleration of an already speedy\u2014by human\nPhoto by g\u00e9rard on Flickr. migration standards\u2014expansion?\nIn short, it is the size of the islands. For much of the first half\nof the Austronesian Expansion, cultivators found themselves\non relatively large islands (Taiwan is larger than Maryland; the biggest Philippine island\u2014Luzon\u2014is larger than\nTennessee). So there was little need to expand to another island when there was so much room (relatively) on the\nisland already occupied.\nIt is worth remembering that these Proto-Austronesian-speaking farmers did not see themselves as part of one\nof the grandest population shifts in human history. Rather, they were people like us who made the best decisions\nthey could, based on the alternatives before them. And since they were farmers, the need for expansion was\nnecessarily built in.\nImagine a farm, owned and operated by a family with two offspring. Each one inherits half of the family farm.\nA generation later, and again assuming two offspring each, the original family farm is now in quarters\u2014a size that\nmay not be enough to support a household. This means that somebody has to move on in order for the original\nfarm to be sustainable. If a territory is large enough, a family moving on can pioneer a new plot of land not too far\naway. There could be a skirmish or two with local hunter-gatherers who don\u2019t like the incursion, but the farmers 74 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nhave enough people behind them to win in the end. (Diamond, 1997, pp. 85\u201392. Of course, this is also the story\nof the westward expansion of mostly Europeans across the middle of North America.)\nStill, even on large islands like Taiwan and Luzon\u2014and later, the Bismarck Archipelago and the island chains of\nthe Solomons and Vanuatu\u2014eventually, the pressure to find another place to farm would be too much. And once\nthe move to the much smaller islands of Micronesia beyond Guam and Polynesia beyond Samoa began, the need\nto find places to plant was accelerated.\nAs of 500 BCE, Many of the small Micronesian islands had been discovered and settled, even as far west\nas Kiribati. In general, Micronesia was settled before the Polynesian region; the earliest known Polynesian\nsettlement was Tonga by around 900 BCE, followed by Samoa shortly after. The most distant Polynesian islands\nwere discovered within a 500-year period\u2014roughly 700\u20131200 CE, starting with the Cook Islands, Tahiti, and the\nMarquesas; then the Hawaiian archipelago (about 900 CE), and concluding with Rapa Nui (Easter Island) and New\nZealand, just a few hundred years before Europeans arrived.\nWhile some scholars disagree on the routes taken by these explorers, genetics (Li, et al, 2008; Yong, 2009)\nconfirm the migratory account described here. Linguistically, cognates found in different Austronesian languages\ncorroborate the same story:\nAUSTRONESIAN EXPANSION AND LANGUAGE\nEstimated Date of\nModern Language hand coconut pig woman fish\nAustronesian Settlement\n2250 BCE Tagalog (Philippines) lim\u00e1 niyog baboy babae isda\n1250 BCE Malay lima nylur babi wanita ikan\nSursurunga\n1250 BCE lim\u00e1n ngin bor wak isu\n(New Ireland)\n800 BCE Samoan lima pop puaa fafine i'a\n900 CE Native Hawaiian lima niu pua'a wahine i'a\n1250 CE Maori rima niu poaka wahine ika\nThe Austronesian Expansion took place long before compasses and sextants, and its voyages were powered\nby wind and ocean currents\u2014and, of course, a lot of paddling. We will never know, naturally, how many sailing\ncanoes of unsuccessful voyagers rest at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, but we know they are there, and they are\nall a testament to the heroism of these explorers over the past 5,000 years.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nIn the year 1500, the Austronesian language family wrapped more than halfway around the globe\u2014a greater distance than any other until\nEuropean Expansion.\nThe Austronesian Expansion may have even reached the New World! Cotton in Hawai\u2019i and sweet potatoes in the Cook Islands have South\nAmerican origins that seemto have occurred before European contact (Allaby, 2007).\nThe Republic of Kiribati is in all four hemispheres: some of its 30-plus islands are north of the Equator and some are south; and some of\nthem are east of the International Date Line and some are west.

CHAPTER 16\nPacific Realm: Physical Geography I\nMonoliths\nThe word monolith derives from the Greek words meaning single and stone. Mono is found in numerous English\nwords, such as monopoly (a single company that dominates a resource, commodity, or product) and monorail (a\ntram that runs on a single rail, like in Seattle). Lith is less common, but lithosphere refers to the rocky outer layer\nof the Earth.\nWhile monolith refers to a single stone, it does so not in the casual mundane way. You can pick up a single\nstone off the street, but it is not a monolith. There are innumerable grains of sand and millions of pebbles on the\nbeach, but those are not monoliths. In this context, perhaps a better word for mono is singular. A monolith is a\nstone of great size set distinctly alone in a striking location. A monolith is a rocky singularity on the Earth\u2019s surface.\n76 PACIFIC REALM: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 77\nIt seems most logical that a monolith has been thrust upward in\nsome ancient geological movement. While this may be true in\ncertain cases or to some degree, it is best understood that the\nmonoliths remain on the landscape due to erosion. Or more\nclearly, as single masses of particularly hard metamorphic or\nigneous rock, monoliths remain on the landscape while adjacent\nrock or soil material over eons of time has been subjected to\nsufficient water or wind erosion to be moved away. The massive\nstrongly resistant rock endures.\nThere are monoliths all across the world. In America, the well-\nknown monoliths are Stone Mountain outside of Atlanta, Devil\u2019s\nTower in Wyoming, and El Capitan in Yosemite National Park.\nMonoliths in Australia.\nCartography by Steve Wiertz.\nNevertheless, Australia is particularly known for its\nfew monoliths. Perhaps this recognition is due to\nAustralia highlighting its large barren Outback, while\nPhoto of Kata Tjuta by Steve Collis on Flickr. having only a small set of low mountains. A cluster in\nthe Northern Territory originally was named by the\naborigines as Kata Tjuta, meaning many heads \u2013 see\nthe aerial and satellite photos below. Later rediscovered by the British, it was renamed \u201cthe Olgas.\u201d Under current\nAustralian law of dual naming, it is known by both names. 78 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nKata Tjuta: NASA Satellite Image\nThe most famous monolith in Australia was named Uluru by the aborigines. Later rediscovered by the British,\nit was renamed Ayers Rock. Both Kata Tjuta \/ the Olgas and Uluru\/Ayers Rock have distinctive orange hues that\nresult from oxidation of iron material in the rock. Given appropriate sunrises or sunsets and when viewed from\na particular angle, Uluru may appear to glow. In 1985, as part of a series of land recoveries by the aboriginal\npeoples, legal title of Uluru was restored to the local Pitjantjatjara group. Tourism is an important feature of Uluru,\nthough climbing of the monolith has now been banned as of the end of October 2019. PACIFIC REALM: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 79\nPhoto of Uluru by Holger Link on Unsplash\nThe world\u2019s largest monolith is in Australia, but is it Uluru or is it Mount Augustus? The latter sits in Western\nAustralia and is twice the volume as Uluru. The dispute focuses on whether or not Mount Augustus is a monolith.\nIn the casual use of the term monolith, Mount Augustus is included in this rocky set of places. In tourist literature\nin Western Australia, Mount Augustus is promoted as the world\u2019s largest monolith. However, in geologic study,\nMount Augustus is cited as a monocline. A monocline is an asymmetrical series of folded rock layers. Indeed, this\ncreated Mount Augustus in an ancient geologic buckling movement, likely over a billion years ago. It is safe to\nsay that Mount Augustus is the world\u2019s biggest surface rock. If Mount Augustus is excluded from the monolith\ncategory, then Uluru is the world\u2019s biggest monolith. Either way, Australia has the title holder.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nMegaliths are large standing stones set vertically in the ground by people. The famous cluster known as Stonehenge is a set of megaliths.\nThe word monolith can have other meanings in different contexts. A monolith can be a massive structure, not necessarily a natural rock\nformation. A monolith can be a singularly powerful or unified force.\nPerhaps because of these other meanings, some scholars prefer to include formations like Uluru under the term inselberg. 80 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCollis, Steve. 2016.

CHAPTER 17\nPacific Realm: Political Geography I\nWhy is Hawaii in Polynesia?\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive\nregion. A region is defined to be an area with multiple shared characteristics over a range of categories, including\nboth physical and human geographic characteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct\nnot a naturally begotten unit, is to cluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic\ndifferences.\nSo, what is Polynesia? The Pacific Realm includes Australia, New Zealand, and many other islands. Most of those\nother islands are quite small. If you consider surface area, then Polynesia is the largest sub-region of the Pacific\nRealm, with its surface area overwhelmingly being water.\n81 82 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn Greek language, poly means many while nesia refers to islands. So, Polynesia refers to the many islands.\nThese many islands, simplified, are located east of Micronesia and Melanesia. Some of these islands are volcanic\n\u2013 Hawaii is, while many are coral-based low islands.\nEven so, Polynesia mainly is a culturally-based region that commonly featured matrilineal societies. Their\nlanguages fall in the Austronesian language family, but are in a sub-group distinct from Melanesia and\nMicronesian sub-groups. Skilled navigation using outrigger canoes propelled natives throughout islands in the vast\nocean spaces of Polynesia. Following the arrival of Christian missionaries in 1820, Christianity spread quickly and\nwidely throughout the region.\nThe native presence on Hawaii extends back at least to 800AD,\nperhaps longer. European arrival was initially chronicled with the\nlanding of British ships led by Captain James Cook in 1778. King\nKamehameha I ruled from 1782 to 1819 and succeeded in unifying\nthe islands.\nAfter a controversial coup overthrowing the Hawaiian Queen\nLili\u2019uokalani in 1893, the United States annexed Hawaii by treaty in\n1898. It remained a territory of the United States, until joining the\nth\nunion as the 50 state on August 21, 1959. Obviously, in political\nterms this means that Hawaii is in the region of North America, as\nPolynesia. Cartography by Cruickshanks.\nit politically is part of the United States. This inclusion of Hawaii in\nNorth America is plausibly, for nothing but ocean exists between\nthe American mainland and the Hawaiian Islands. PACIFIC REALM: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 83\nAlthough there are many volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean,\nHawaii\u2019s formation is unusual, being the \u201chot spot.\u201d A weakness in\nthe Earth\u2019s mantle, a hot spot, releases molten rock material from\nthe ocean\u2019s floor. This volcanic material accumulates as long as the\nhot spot remains open. If that time frame is long enough, the hot\nspot constructs a volcanic island. Additionally, continental drift\nkeeps happening. The hot spot builds an island, but eventually\nseals off. Continental drift moves the island along. Staying in the\noriginal location, the hot spot reopens and builds another island.\nAnd so on, over long geologic time frames. Thus, Hawaii is a string\nof volcanic islands of different ages.\nFor a handful of European colonial powers, it is difficult to accept\nthat their far distant holdings are part of Europe. For instance,\nBathymetric map of Hawaii. USGS.\nFrench Guiana remains a part of overseas France, but lies on the\nPublic Domain.\nmainland of South America. It would seem geographically\nunacceptable to include French Guiana as part of Europe, even as\nthe European Space Agency\u2019s launch site is located there. Similarly, the islands of French Polynesia are part of\nFrance, but are halfway around the world from Europe.\nAs well, could the Falkland Islands of the coast of Argentina be considered in Europe, because they belong to\nBritain? Or Pitcairn Island in Polynesia?\nLike Hawaii, Easter Island in Polynesia also possesses a dual identity that is geographically palatable. Easter\nIsland, famous for its stone statues \u2013 moai \u2013 is located in the far southeastern corner of Polynesia, fitting the usual\nelements of this region. However, the island was annexed by Chile in 1888, though the Chilean mainland is over\n2000 miles away over unblocked Pacific waters (similar to Hawaii and the American mainland).\nThe United States has additional territories among Pacific islands. For instance, Guam and the Northern Mariana\nIslands are US territories; therefore, they are like Hawaii with dual identities.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nWhat other places might be considered to have dual identities? With plausible regional inclusion?\n\u2022 Greenland is an autonomous piece of Denmark and thus Europe, while sometimes being considered part of North America due to\nits physical landscape location.\n\u2022 Ecuador\u2019s Galapagos Islands are over 500 miles west of the mainland, but are not considered part of Polynesia.\n\u2022 The Canary Islands of Spain are directly west of Morocco and thus are in North Africa, but politically belong in Europe, being part\nof Spain.\n\u2022 Alaska clearly is separate from the main portion of the United States, thus lacking contiguity. However, by bordering Canada as\npart of the continental land mass, Alaska clearly is part of North America. It simply is an exclave of the United States. 84 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCruickshanks. 2014. \u201cPolynesia.\u201d Wikipedia. https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Oceania_UN_Geoscheme_-\n_Map_of_Polynesia.svg.

CHAPTER 18\nPacific Realm:\nPopulation Geography I\nIs Urban Australia Overcrowded?\nWith a population density of nine people per square mile, Australia is the third least crowded country in the\nworld, after Mongolia (4.9) and Namibia (7.5), not counting dependent territories of other countries (Greenland\n(Denmark) 0.08 people per square mile). Australia is overcrowded.\nWhat! Australia is overcrowded? In 1997, the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggested that 25 million would be\na likely leveling off point for the country\u2019s population. The country is there now. Crowded? How can a population\nof 25-26 million people living on a whole continent, the world\u2019s sixth largest country by area, be overcrowded?\nThe United States has over 300 million more people than Australia, while being 20% larger in area. Is the United\nStates overcrowded? Some scholars and a noteworthy percentage of the American population suggest that, yes,\nAmerica is overcrowded. This is expressed in terms of immigration debates and of environmental concerns.\nSo, if America might be overcrowded with 330 million people, could Australia be overcrowded with its nearly\n26 million people? As expressed in the essay on urban centralization in Australia, the country\u2019s population is\ndominantly compressed into a handful of cities. So first, we should ask whether or not Australia\u2019s cities are\novercrowded or not.\n85 86 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n1\nLet\u2019s take a look at Australia\u2019s five most populated cities, ranked among cities of the world.\nAUSTRALIA'S TOP FIVE CITIES, AS RANKED WORLDWIDE\n2017 Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Adelaide\nApproximate Population Density,\n1900 1500 1000 1000 1300\npeople per square km\nPopulation Density Rank,\n936 955 996 986 965\namong cities of the world\nPopulation Rank, among cities of the world 104 106 250 284 442\nArea Rank, among cities of the world 43 32 47 68 152\n2020 Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Perth Adelaide\nDensity Rank, among cities of the world 935 968 1004 989 979\nBy worldwide standards, Australian cities are stunningly not crowded. In the short term, at least 2017-2020,\nAustralian cities tend to be comparatively less and less crowded. In 2020, Sydney ranks as Australia\u2019s most\ncrowded city with 5499 people per square mile. To find a match in North America, we select Winnipeg, Canada, at\n#939 and 5361 people per square mile. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anyone out there who is troubled that Winnipeg\nis too crowded.\nNaturally, cities are more crowded than rural areas, as clearly can be seen on this map \u2014\nhttps:\/\/www.businessinsider.com.au\/australia-population-density-fastest-growing-regions-2019-3\nA fascinating statistical study of urban crowdedness across the world attempts to refine the statistic by\nmeasuring and analyzing population-weighted density. This study of Australian, European, Canadian and New\nZealand cities found that Australian cities ranked at the bottom of the list, as charted here \u2014\nhttps:\/\/chartingtransport.com\/2015\/11\/26\/comparing-the-densities-of-australian-and-european-cities\/#jp-\ncarousel-2781 . Again, it appears that Australian cities are not particularly crowded urban realms.\nnd\nBy comparison, consider the cities of nearby New Zealand. Auckland ranks 892 in 2020 with 6585 people per\nsquare mile. The most similar North American city is #839 Toronto, Canada, at 7139 people per square mile.\nHow much population increase will be coming to Australia\u2019s cities? Well, for the country as a whole, from 2005\nto the present, net overseas migration into Australia has been greater than the country\u2019s natural increase. The\ndestinations for these migrants, even more so than for internal migrants, has been the capital cities. This means\nthat capitals of the six states of Australia \u2013 Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales,\nVictoria, and Tasmania, plus Northern Territory, as well as the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) that is Canberra.\nFor now, note that by most standards of population growth or density, Australia is not at all overcrowded; rather,\non worldwide comparisons, Australia is quite low on population density. Even so, there are other considerations\nof the contentious question about the number of people appropriate for Australia. Could Australia\u2019s population\nbe inappropriately large, even though not overcrowded? This concern is the topic of a longer answer or answers,\nseeking to determine how many people can be supported on a dry continent. How well does Australia stack up\nwhen considering its carrying capacity, sustainability, or water supply?\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??

At the northwestern corner of Africa, this\nregion is claimed by Morocco, but also asserts its own autonomy. If counted as a country, though not so in this essay, with a population density\nof six people per square mile, it would be less crowded than Australia.\nIn the Demografia statistics reported above for Australian cities, the most crowded urban area in the world is Dhaka, Bangladesh.

CHAPTER 19\nPacific Realm: Urban Geography I\nCentralized Australia\nAmong the world\u2019s countries, there are many that are very highly urbanized. Some of these very urban locations\nare thus by definition. Monaco as a city-State is 100% urban. The same is true for Singapore. There are small\nislands that are all or nearly entirely urban \u2013 Malta is 94% urban. Other lands are small with few choices \u2013 Kuwait\nas a desert land is 100% urban.\nConsider the most populated cities of Australia.\nTOP TEN CITIES OF AUSTRALIA\nRank City Population in millions Coastal? Which side?\n1 Sydney 5.2 yes eastern\n2 Melbourne 4.9 yes eastern\n3 Brisbane 2.4 yes eastern\n4 Perth 2.0 yes western\n5 Adelaide 1.3 yes southern\n6 Gold Coast 0.6 yes eastern\n7 New Castle-Maitland 0.4 yes eastern\n8 Canberra 0.4 almost eastern\n9 Sunshine Coast 0.3 yes eastern\n10 Woolongong 0.3 yes eastern\nNotice that this makes Sydney the residence of 20% of Australia\u2019s population. With 85% of Australia\u2019s population\nbeing urban, Sydney has about 25% of all of the country\u2019s urban dwellers. Commonly, if a city possesses 20% or\n89 90 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nmore of a country\u2019s urban population, then it likely is a primate city \u2013 that is, a city that dominates its country in\nall urban ways. However, Melbourne is nearly as large as Sydney; thus, not being dominated by Sydney in simple\nnumbers. Canberra, though over ten times smaller than Sydney in population, is the political focus, as the planned\nnational capital city.\nWhile we may not say that Sydney dominates the\nAustralian urban life, we can argue that eastern\nAustralia dominates all urban Australia. Adelaide sits\non the southern shore, but slightly on the eastern half\nof the Australian continent. Melbourne is positioned\non the southeastern corner of the landmass. Perth\nwith two million people anchors the western side of\nAustralia. Modest-sized Darwin holds port on the\nnorthern edge, but only with 150,000 residents. The\ninterior of Australia holds a scattering of towns, such\nas Alice Springs of about 25,000. The lion\u2019s share of the\nnational population is on the eastern coastline.\nToo much so? At the turn of the century, Australia\nhad the most centralized population of any country in\nSydney. Photo by Jamie Davies on Unsplash. the world. Seven out of every ten Australians lived in a\ncity of at least 750,000. Less than two decades later in\n2018, 74% of Australian urban dwellers lived in the five largest cities alone.\nLet\u2019s evaluate this measurement of centralized population. As noted above, this is not the same as a primate\ncity. There are a number of countries in the world where one city dominates and has a high share of the urban\npopulation. For instance, Montevideo in Uruguay has over 50% of the country\u2019s urban residents living in that one\ncity. Here though I am taking centralized population to mean something else. I am looking for countries that have\nseveral highly populated cities \u2013 at least five cities of at least one million citizens each. Compare the sum of the\npopulation of those five cities to the total urban population of the country.\nCOUNTRY POPULATION SHARE PER FIVE LARGEST CITIES\nCountry Urban population in five cities, in millions % of all urbanites in those five cities\nAustralia 16 74%\nPakistan 39 50%\nSouth Korea 21 50%\nTurkey 27 44%\nRussia 23 21%\nJapan 24 21%\nNigeria 18 18%\nMexico 17 17%\nBrazil 25 14%\nIndonesia 19 13%\nIndia 56 12%\nChina 79 10%\nUSA 20 7% PACIFIC REALM: URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 91\nThirteen countries qualify by these measures. Australia is far and away the highest on this standard. These are\ncountries that have considerable urban development, but broadly geographic. It is understandable that hugely\npopulated countries like China and India will have numerous cities of at least one million people each. Yet, their\nextraordinary population size means that the people are distributed very widely. Countries with small areas like\nSouth Korea often have a primate city; in fact, Seoul with about ten million people may be a primate city. For\nmany countries, having a primate city will mean that there are not enough other cities over a million people, so\nthat such a country does not qualify for the centralized population category. Here we see that only South Korea\nand Japan fit this small area focus. All the other countries on the list above have large to huge areas, so that we\nwould expect a wide range of cities by population and by distribution over space. Thus, it is difficult for large area\ncountries to have only a few cities tally a big share of the nation\u2019s urban population.\nYet, Australia does. Three-fourths of urban Australians live in just five cities. Historically and geographically, we\ndo find explanation. Since the arrival of British sea captain James Cook to the eastern shores of Australia in 1770,\nthe focus of European population was on the eastern Australia. Cook\u2019s exploration and detailed examination of\nthe eastern side of Australia revealed a number of attractive locations for settlement. The coastal plains there\noffered flat lands for development, agriculture, and population. Moving westward from these plains soon there\nare the main mountains of Australia \u2013 the Great Dividing Range. On worldwide standards these mountains are\nrather low, at best a bit over 7000 feet (Mt. Kosciusko), but they do cause orographic precipitation to fall on\ntheir eastern slopes \u2013 that is, into the coastal plains. Given the dry continent of Australia, Cook\u2019s discovery of\ncoastal plains with regular precipitation was like finding treasure. Additionally, Cook\u2019s sails revealed several useful\nharbors along the eastern shores. Given Britain\u2019s interest in colonization and trade around the world, access to\nuseful ports also was coveted. These advantages propelled the east coast of Australia to develop several port\nlocations into towns that evolved into several of the main cities of the land. This gives us Sydney, Melbourne, and\nBrisbane of Australia\u2019s top five cities. Adelaide is the key southern port, while Perth is the dominant west coast\ncity. The east has the best settings, but having Adelaide and Perth as well led to Britain claiming all of Australia.\nThe physical geography of Australia provides additional cause for the country\u2019s centralized urban pattern.\nWith the famed Outback as the best-known means of referring to Australia\u2019s desert and near-desert settings, the\nrugged environment of the interior yields few locations for large urban settlements. The Australian center has\nterritory for sheep and cattle ranches, but the livestock far outnumber the human population. The interior has\nsubstantial natural resources ranging from key industrial elements such as iron ore to specialized materials such\nas opals. These raw materials bring miners to the resource sites, but the harsh environment does not encourage\nmany other people to settle there as well.\nThe five cities that got their impetus from early British colonization developed into appealing urban realms with\njobs, culture, and beaches. However, some argue that these cities now have become overcrowded; for instance,\nthey could use better transportation infrastructure to reduce traffic woes. In any case, these urban patterns of\nAustralia give it this distinctive centralization, the most so in the world.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nNote that this is not the same as the Rank-Size Rule. The United States follows the rank-size rule, but its top five cities together only account\nfor 7% of America\u2019s urban population.\nMaps can be funky.

CHAPTER 20\nPacific Realm: Cultural Geography II\nReligion and the Lutheran Faith in Papua New Guinea\nFRANKLIN ISHIDA\nLike in many parts of the world, Christianity arrived with the colonial powers in what is now Papua New Guinea,\nthough even that presence was late in coming compared to other lands.\nHumans have inhabited New Guinea Island for about 40,000 years. Little was known in Europe about the island\nuntil the 19th century. It was only in 1884 that Germany colonized the northeastern portion of the island (called\nNew Guinea) and Great Britain the southeastern portion (Papua). The western half of the island was occupied\nby the Netherlands and later this was annexed into Indonesia. And while Australia, on behalf of Great Britain,\ncontrolled the eastern half for much of the modern era, Papua New Guinea only gained its independence in 1975.\nThe religious scene followed these colonial markers, with the first German Lutherans establishing themselves\nat Finschhafen along the east coast of the German Protectorate of New Guinea in 1886. In the southern half,\nthe London Missionary Society (Reformed tradition) arrived in 1889. These two Protestant streams continued to\ndominate in these two parts of the county, while the Catholic mission started making inroads in the 1880s. Most\nGerman missionaries were allowed to remain when Australia took over the German colony after World War I. In\nthe early 1930s Lutheran missionaries were among the first Europeans to move into the highlands.\nToday, Lutherans make up about 20% of the population, United Church (originating from the London Missionary\nSociety) 11.5%, Catholics 27%, and Seventh Day Adventists 10%. With other smaller denominations in the mix, a\n93 94 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nlarge majority of Papua New Guineans identify themselves as members of a Christian church (96% in the 2000\ncensus). However, many continue to combine their Christian faith with traditional indigenous beliefs and practices,\nwhile in places there are strong remnants of what is called Cargo Cult.\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea grew out of the work of the Neuendettelsau Mission\nSociety (1886) and the Rhenish Mission Society (1887), both from Germany. During World War II all missionaries\nleft the area, as many mission stations, churches, schools and hospitals were damaged. In spite of this, the\nindigenous church leaders and local Christians stood firm in the work of the church.\nAfter the war the Lutheran churches in Australia and North America were asked to help reconstruct the church\nin Papua New Guinea, working together as the Lutheran Mission New Guinea. In 1956 expatriate missionaries and\nindigenous church leaders gathered and formed the Evangelical Lutheran Church of New Guinea (ELCONG) as an\nindigenous church. The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod established a separate Gutnius Lutheran Church in the\nhighlands in 1948.\nAt the time of its founding, ELCONG bishops were expatriate missionaries from the American Lutheran Church.\nThe first indigenous bishop was elected in 1973. In 1975, on the eve of the country\u2019s independence, the name of\nthe church was changed to Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea (ELCPNG). In 1977 the church was\nofficially declared autonomous and another local Lutheran church organized by the Australian Lutheran Mission\njoined with the ELCPNG.\nSince before independence, different churches have operated roughly half of the educational and medical\ninstitutions in the country and, to this day, receive government subsidies to provide these services. The ELCPNG\noperates 170 primary schools and 11 secondary schools, which function on behalf of the government and as\npublic schools. The church also has a teacher training college, (which sends teachers throughout the country), a\nnursing school, a couple church leadership training colleges, and three theological seminaries. PACIFIC REALM: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 95\nIn response to the rugged and often inaccessible\nlandscape of PNG, Lutherans helped start some key\ntransportation networks. In 1934 a Lutheran mission\nbought a plane and pioneered mission aviation. While\ncommercial airlines now connect major towns, Mission\nAviation Fellowship (MAF), which took over from\nLutheran Aviation, continues to link many more\nremote places.\nMission groups early on also started Lutheran\nShipping as a major carrier of cargo and passengers\nalong the north and northeast coasts. Luship, as it was\ncalled, ceased operations in 2014, but Lutheran\nShipping Services was established by the ELCPNG to\ncontinue key shipping routes.\nWith some 830 different languages in PNG, another\nPapua New Guinea. Cartography by Steve Wiertz.\nchallenge is unifying the functions of the church. Like\nthe country at large, Tok Pisin (Pidgin) and English are\nthe common languages of the church, though local indigenous languages are also widely used for worship and\nteaching.\nAlthough there is no state religion, the preamble to the PNG\nconstitution mentions \u201cthe Christian principles\u201d upon which the\ncountry is founded. This constitution establishes freedom of\nreligion and religious practice, provided that it does not infringe on\nthe rights of others or of the public interest. Several prime\nministers and speakers of parliament have been Lutheran. And\nwith a strong Christian backdrop for the country, the government\nhas pursued programs to increase the partnership between\nchurches and the state, including subsidies to churches and the\nestablishment of church councils to assist in local governance.\nGermany had few colonies, but one of those colonial pieces was\nLutheran church service in Papua New Guinea. part of the island of New Guinea.

An albatross is a somewhat large seabird whose wingspan often is about ten\nfeet across. Presumably, an albatross would like to have easy access to food such as small fish. The bird also\nwould need a place to roost, rest, and breed. Theoretically, any coastal landscape could work. An island might\ndo well. However, many coastal locations, islands or otherwise, have human populations. Let\u2019s go find places to\navoid predators, including no human predators. Historically, we are going back in time, past modern times where\nhuman settlements often have large quantities of garbage that might provide easy pickings for any birds, even\nthose that usually eat fish. Isolated islands sound like good choices. Certainly there are islands throughout the\noceans of the world. Even so, location still makes a difference. Frozen polar islands probably are not the best\nsettings, although penguins do live at Antarctica. Fish do live in cold waters, but perhaps more abundantly in\ntropical zones. In the Pacific Ocean there are many tropical islands. Often these islands are uninhabited or at\nleast spent thousands and thousands of years uninhabited before the Austronesian Expansion brought people to\nthese Pacific isles.\nTherefore, for at least some Pacific islands, seabirds like albatrosses lived on small Pacific islands, over\ngenerations of birds and for eons on these rocky sites. The birds ate fish from the water and pooped excrement\nfrom the skies. Some of this poop landed in the ocean, but other bits plopped onto the islands themselves. Or,\nthe birds defecated while they walked on the land.\n97 98 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nWho knows when animal manure first began to be use as fertilizer? Certainly, cow manure long ago, centuries\nago, was tossed onto fields of crops. This dung aids the structure of the soil, but in particular adds nitrogen that\npromotes plant growth. Chicken poop contains nitrogen and phosphate, both aiding crop growth. Of course,\nboth elements have other industrial uses as well.\nSo, however many, many years ago albatrosses, terns, gannets,\nfrigate birds, and many other seabirds found Pacific islands. Many,\nprobably most, descendants of those birds found it easy to stay\nright there on the same islands. Over a number of generations, the\nbird populations increased sizably. Fish in the adjacent waters\ngenerally remained abundant. The birds ate and pooped.\nFor some islands, the hundreds or thousands or however many\nyears of bird poop or guanodeposits created mountains of\nphosphate. But, so what?\nWell, here we have the story of the island of Nauru. Nauru is a\ntiny island; in fact, it is the smallest island country in the\nworld. Naturally, it is part of the sub-region called Micronesia. The\nFrigate bird, Nauru. Photo by Sean Kelleher on\ncountry has eight square miles and ten thousand people.\nFlickr.\nIn 1899, while Nauru was a German colony, the story of\nphosphate extraction begins. As the tale goes, Australian\nprospector Albert Fuller Ellis noticed a large rock that was being used as a doorstop, for the natives had now\nparticular use for it. Ellis determined that it was phosphate, thereby setting in motion a chain of events that\nbrought prosperity and then collapse to Nauru.\nThe phosphate on Nauru quite naturally was on the surface in\ngreat depths, so that it easily was extracted through strip mining.\nGermany began this mining in 1906, but after losing World War I,\nGermany lost jurisdiction over Nauru. Australia, New Zealand, and\nthe United Kingdom took over as trustees. During World War II,\nNauru was one of many Pacific islands taken by Japanese forces,\nbut after the war, Nauru was returned to Australia, New Zealand,\nand the United Kingdom as trustees. In 1968 Nauru became an\nindependent country. Given their small population and the\nconsiderable income that came from the mines, the people of\nNauru became some of the richest people in the world, certainly\nwhen measured as income per capita. However, given that the\nNauru no longer is an uninhabited island favored by bird species,\nPhosphate loaders, Nauru. Photo by Sean Kelleher\nthe phosphate deposits were a non-renewable resource. The\non Flickr.\nsupply was exhausted and the mining income disappeared.\nReplacing some of the income through other sources, in\n2001-2007 Nauru served as a detention center for refugees rejected by Australia. Nauru sought to become a tax\nhaven. Nauru\u2019s wealth was gone, but bad habits remained. Nauru is cited as the most obese country in the world,\nno doubt linked to its #1 rate of type-2 diabetes.\nAlthough Nauru has the most jarring economic story of guano deposits, a number of other Pacific (and\nCaribbean) islands have noteworthy supplies of guano\/phosphate. In 1856, the United States Congress passed\nthe Guano Islands Bill.

Right there! On the corner of the world. Look at most world maps. Usually Australia is in the bottom\nright corner of the map. Certainly, on any standardly used world map, this is true. But is that really where Australia\nis located? Sort of. Is little Australia always in the corner? Is Australia little? Compared to any of the other\ncontinents, Australia is pictured much smaller. But, how big is Australia actually? I want to investigate these issues\nhere by considering the topic of map projections.\nThe planet is a sphere, almost. A mathematical sphere is a smooth ball with every point on its surface being the\nsame distance from the center point of the sphere. In actuality, the Earth is not quite a sphere. When you pause\nto consider this concept, you realize that, of course, the Earth is not a smooth equal surface. There are mountains\nand valleys. A few locations are below sea level, while mountains, buttes, mesas, monoliths and other landscape\nfeatures push up from the surface.\nLess well known is that the Earth bulges in areas around the equator, due to centrifugal force. The planet is\nabout 27 miles wider west to east than it is north to south. Therefore, this shape is not quite a sphere, but a rough\nsurfaced oblate spheroid.\nEven so, a globe is a fine representation of the Earth. However, there are limits to the usefulness of a globe. A\nglobe doesn\u2019t fit in a desk drawer or in a briefcase or on a wall. It is not possible for a person to see all sides of a\nglobe at the same time. For these and other reasons, over several centuries geographers and other scholars have\n100 PACIFIC REALM: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 101\nstriven to create useful world maps on flat paper surfaces, usually as rectangular maps. In doing so, cartographers\nattempt to meet five criteria; basically, the cartographer seeks to maintain scale and proportionality across the\nmap, even though this is not 100% possible. Probably the most apparent criteria are size and shape.\nIn 1569, Gerardus Mercator created a map projection that bears his name still today. This Mercator projection\nwas very useful at that point in history, for it created rhumb lines (or loxodromes) that are straight lines of\nnavigation as they follow compass headings. At that point in the world\u2019s history, this feature was wonderful\nfor sailing across oceans. However, the glaring flaw of the projection is that these maps distort the sizes of\nland masses, as the distance from the equator increases. The infamous example of this flaw is the depiction of\nGreenland as an enormous shape roughly the same in appearance as Africa, whereas Africa actually is fourteen\ntimes larger than Greenland. So, how big is Australia?\nBig. How big? Well, certainly we can measure Australia in term of square miles (or square kilometers, as the rest\nof the world does). It has 2.97 million square miles (7.69 million square kilometers). That is rather mundane, but\nhow is it portrayed on a map?\nAustralia rests between 12\u00b0S and 43\u00b0S latitude. Northern Australia\u2019s closer proximity to the equator means that\nits area is quite accurately displayed. Error increases as distance from the equator lengthens; however, Australia\u2019s\nlocation is not extreme, so its area is not greatly distorted. It is shown about a quarter share too large on the\nMercator map.\nSome maps choose to address the equal area issue, while accepting error in other categories. There are many\nexamples of this type of map, among them the Hammer projection (Ernst Hammer in 1892) and the Hobo-Dyer\nprojection (2002). These maps distort the shapes of countries and continents. By definition, Australia\u2019s area on\nthis type of map projection correctly reflects its actual land area.\nSome maps are compromise maps that might not be quite correct on any of the criteria of map projections,\nbut do provide a sense of being reasonable accurate, especially on size and shape. One such map projection is\nthe Dymaxion projection, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1944. Note the bizarre shape of the map \u2013 not a\nrectangle! Clearly, distances and directions on this map are not odd and not calculable. However, the areas and\nshapes of landforms are close to correct. Other interrupted projections also choose to cut the map in the oceans\nin order to help with area and shape of land. So, on these maps Australia\u2019s area is very close to correct. 102 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBut where is Australia? On the Dymaxion projection,\nAustralia is in the bottom left corner. Is that okay?\nRecall that one most standard world maps, Australia is\nin the bottom right corner. Let\u2019s go back to the oblate\nspheroid. Where is up or down, as well as left or right,\non the oblate spheroid? Actually, these terms \u201cup,\ndown, left, or right\u201d are artificial when considering our\nplanet in the solar system. Our planet in space has no\nreal \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown.\u201d The planet is a spheroid in galaxy,\nin open space.\nDymaxion projection. Drawn by Justin Kunimune.\nConsider that astronauts in a space shuttle could maneuver the shuttle anywhere around the planet to provide\nany number of viewpoints. All of those potential viewpoints would be valid perspectives to look at Earth. However,\nfor centuries maps like the Mercator projection have placed North America and Europe at the top of the map.\nThus, Australia is placed near the bottom of the map. In contrast, a few so-called upside-down world maps put\nthe southern hemisphere at the top of the map, with the northern hemisphere at the bottom. For these maps,\nAustralia is on the upper half of the map, sometimes even in the center of the top half.\nWhat could happen if Australia was the central focus of the map? For a look, go to\nhttp:\/\/www.maths.adelaide.edu.au\/matthew.roughan\/img\/azimuthal.png\nFor geographers, all of these elements of maps are fascinating; however, there may be societal implications as\nwell. Many social scientists contend that the centuries-long practice of placing North America and Europe at the\ntop of the map at least subliminally implies that these places are better than places at the bottom of the map.\nThink about how many other ways in our culture we consider top better than bottom. Given the colonial power\nof various northern countries subjugating various southern lands and peoples, some scholars argue that these\nmaps, even a little bit, helped justify this dominance.\nWhere is Australia? Right where it\u2019s always been, but sometimes in different placements on world maps. How\nbig is Australia? The same size that it\u2019s always been, but sometimes appearing in varying relative sizes and shapes\non world maps.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??

CHAPTER 23\nPacific Realm: Physical Geography II\nNew Zealand Compared\nIs New Zealand the Norway or Iceland of the Southern Hemisphere?\nNew Zealand often is cited as one of the most beautiful countries in the world and deservedly so. Its physical\nlandscape is diverse and stunningly beautiful. Compared to locations in the Northern Hemisphere, New Zealand\nprobably is most like Norway or Iceland. Let\u2019s examine the similarities and differences between New Zealand and\nits possible comparative regions in the north.\n104 PACIFIC REALM: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY II 105\nIn physical beauty, certainly the beaches and shorelines of New\nZealand are noteworthy. As an island realm, obviously it has\ncoastline. Comprised of two main islands, unimaginatively named\nth\nNorth Island and South Island, New Zealand ranks 9 in the world\nth\nin length of coastline. Iceland, also an island realm, ranks 25 , but\nNorway, a mainland country while having many very small islands,\nnd\nranks 2 , trailing Canada by far. Mixed sand and gravel beaches\nare common in New Zealand, though some locations feature black\nsand beaches, economically valuable for gold and iron elements.\nDue to the mid-latitude (the capital Wellington is at 41\u00b0 S latitude)\npresence, a number of beaches are available for swimming, though\nsome beaches and some conditions can present dangerous tides\nand waves. In Iceland, Reykjavik\u2019s geothermally-heated lagoon\n(Ylstr\u00f6ndin at Nautholsvik) offers summer swimming with a water\ntemperature of 60\u00b0F, but otherwise Iceland\u2019s ocean shores present\nbeautiful and varied settings of sand and rock, but not swimming.\nSouthwestern Norway, for instance at Orrestranda Beach at\nStavanger, does see summer swimmers. Note that while the\nAtlantic Ocean\u2019s warm Gulf Stream does pass between Iceland and\nNorway, bringing moderate temperatures with it, for these two\ncountries their far northern latitudes \u2013 Iceland (at its capital\nReykjavik) 64\u00b010\u2019 N and Norway (at its capital Oslo) 59\u00b055\u2019 N \u2013\nth\ninherently yield cold climates. In fact, Norway is the 4 coldest\n(average temperature 34.7\u00b0F) country in the world, while Iceland\nranks #7 (35.15\u00b0F) on that measure. Meanwhile, New Zealand\naverages 51\u00b0F.\nPhoto by Tyler Lastovich on Unsplash\nCountry Coastline\nNorway 38,351 miles\nNew Zealand 9,404 miles\nIceland 3,088 miles\nFor these three countries, often coastline also means fjords. Fjords are narrow paths of ocean water stretching\nand twisting inland where ages ago glacial retreats tore out the land. Fjords can present spectacular views of\nheights, water, and land. Fjords can be found in several countries \u2013 Canada, USA (Alaska), Iceland, Chile \u2013 but most\nfamously are in Norway and New Zealand. In New Zealand, typically fjords are called sounds, as is Milford Sound\nin the photograph below. For a look at the famed Milford Track, watch this short video:\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https:\/\/cod.pressbooks.pub\/\nwesternworlddailyreadingsgeography\/?p=107 106 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nDirect Link to Milfrod Trek Video by College of DuPage (New Tab)\nNew Zealand\u2019s southwestern side of South Island includes Fiordland, where are fourteen of the country\u2019s fjords\nare located. Both Doubtful Sound and Dusky Sound are the longest at 25 miles. While not numerous in New\nZealand, the inherent beauty of fjords is picturesque. Milford Sound is a popular tourist destination, actually the\nonly one of the sounds accessible by road.\nIceland\u2019s fjords are more in number and length. Of the 109 fjords there, Eyjafj\u00f6r\u00f0urextends the farthest out to\n37 miles. Norway truly is renowned for fjords, justifiably so, counting 1190 of these waterways, with Sognefjord\nextending an impressive 127 miles.\nAs fjords were carved by glacial retreat from the Ice Age, it may\nnot be surprising that glaciers remain in these countries today.\nClearly, Iceland sounds like it should have glaciers and it does.\nHowever, New Zealand has many more glaciers, more than Norway\nas well; yet, these tend to be very small, averaging 2.5 acres in\narea. Norwegian and Icelandic glaciers are larger. As around the\nworld, glaciers in these three countries are shrinking in size \u2013\nsurface area and volume.\nNUMBER OF GLACIERS\nMilford Sound \u2013 Photo by Amy Workman on\nUnsplash\nArea of largest glacier\nCountry # of Glaciers Largest Glacier\nin square miles\nIceland 269 Vatnajokull 3204\nNew Zealand 3144 Tasman 39\nNorway 1600 Austfonna (in Svalbard) 3248\nGlaciers, large bodies of ice moving under its own weight by gravity and melting, often are associated with\nmountains that provide slopes and colder elevations. The mountains of North Island, but especially the Southern\nAlps of course on South Island, are the consequence of New Zealand\u2019s location astraddle the line where the\nAustralian tectonic plate meets the Pacific tectonic plate. The resulting subduction created high mountains and\nvolcanoes in New Zealand. As pictured below, Mount Cook is New Zealand\u2019s highest peak at 12, 218 feet. The\nSouthern Alps include a number of other peaks above 10,000 feet. While Norway has numerous mountains\nas well, its location does not hit an active line between tectonic plates, thus its mountains do not reach as far\nskyward. Galdh\u00f8piggen extends the farthest up to 8100 feet. Iceland\u2019s complicated geology, noted in its own\nessay, produced its peak of Hvannadalshnj\u00fakur at 6952 feet. PACIFIC REALM: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY II 107\nIn sum, New Zealand features higher mountains, more but small\nglaciers, fewer yet gorgeous fjords (or sounds), and warmer\nbeaches than Norway and Iceland do. All three countries\nincorporate beautiful scenery into enticing location for tourist\nvisits. New Zealand\u2019s far distant location is a disadvantage\ncompared to Norway\u2019s and Iceland\u2019s respective proximities to\nAmerica and Europe.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nPakistan has the most glaciers in the world.\nth\nThe 17 of May is Norway\u2019s\nnational day.

CHAPTER 24\nPacific Realm: Political Geography II\nMicronesia\nWhat do doctors call it when someone has a little bit of memory problems? Micronesia!\nOk, that was a pathetic joke. However, micro does mean small, appropriately so for a set of islands in the Pacific\nOcean.\nMicronesia is a set of quite small islands within our region, the Pacific Realm. There are eight countries\/\nterritories in Micronesia, roughly located north of Melanesia (Chapter 13). One of the territories is called the\nFederated States of Micronesia. Links to the United States are common.\n\u201cGood things come in small packages.\u201d \u201cSmall is beautiful.\u201d There are some well-known proverbs that suggest\nthat small can be a fine thing. \u201cThe bigger they come, the harder they fall.\u201d Yes, there are sayings that suggest that\nbigger isn\u2019t necessarily better. Nevertheless, being a tiny island country\/territory doesn\u2019t have a lot of advantages.\nSometimes you get lucky. Read about the rise and fall of tiny Nauru in Chapter 21.\n108 PACIFIC REALM: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 109\nWouldn\u2019t it make sense for tiny islands to work cooperatively\ntogether? That is the approach taken by the Federated States of\nMicronesia (FSM). These islands are centered in the archipelago of\nthe Caroline Islands. The 607 islands that comprise FSM are\ngrouped into four sets \u2013 Yap, Chuuk, Ponhpei, and Kosrae. It is\nlikely that fewer than 1% of people of the world have ever heard of\nthose four island names. Again, tiny. In fact, the whole Federated\nStates of Micronesia includes only 270.8 square miles of land. The\narea of the city of Chicago is 234 square miles. The average size\nisland, measured by the mathematical mean, is about half a square\nMicronesia. Cartography by Cruickshanks.\nmile. In contrast, FSM includes over one million square miles of\nocean. That ocean surface area is about the same size as the land\narea of Alaska, Texas, and Wisconsin combined.\nChuuk Lagoon, Federated States of Micronesia. Photo by Marek Okon on Unsplash.\nAs an individual island, any of these dots of land would struggle, so it is logical to work cooperatively together\npolitically and economically. The national government is based on Pohnpei. Historically, Spain, Germany, and\nJapan held territory among these islands, but after World War II, the United Nations established the Trust\nTerritories of the Pacific Islands (TTPI). That trust included the island sets now in FSM, as well as the Marshall\nIslands, Palau, and the Northern Mariana Islands. In 1978 referendum, residents voted to create the Federated\nStates of Micronesia, so that this union was formed the following year. Largely due to the American presence,\nEnglish is the official language, though there are eight major indigenous languages spoken there too. 110 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nPolitically, the Northern Mariana Islands were part of the TTPI,\nbut did not join the FSM. Instead, they formed a commonwealth\nunder the jurisdiction of an American territory. Only 22 islands as\ncompared to the 607 of the Federated States of Micronesia, these\nislands are somewhat larger, totaling 464 square miles. Ninety\npercent of the commonwealth\u2019s 50,000 people live on the island of\nSaipan.\nIn 1979, the Marshall Islands gained independence, but in 1986\nestablished a free association with the United States, whereby the\nUS provides defense and other services. The Federated States of\nMicronesia have the same connection with America.\nSteam plume from volcano on Pagan Island in the In 1994 out of the TTPI, Palau secured its status as an\nNorthern Mariana Islands. independent country, but like the Marshall Islands, for its benefit in\nNASA Earth Observatory. political and economic terms, it created a free association with the\nUnited States.\nGuam is the largest island in Micronesia. It was a Spanish\nterritory that was ceded to the United States in 1899.\nKiribati has a somewhat different colonial history, being British subjects until independence in 1979. Maintaining\nits connection with the United Kingdom, Kiribati is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Nauru (Chapter\n21) too is in the Commonwealth of Nations.\nEight of the United State Minor Outlying Islands complete the set of islands in Micronesia. These are:\n\u2022 Baker Island,\n\u2022 Howland Island,\n\u2022 Jarvis Island,\n\u2022 Johnson Atoll,\n\u2022 Kingman Reef,\n\u2022 Midway Atoll,\n\u2022 Palmyra Atoll (the largest at 4.6 square miles),\n\u2022 Wake Island.\nThe islands have no permanent residents and are grouped together for statistical convenience. (In the Caribbean\nSea, Navassa Island, Bajo Nuevo Bank, and Serranilla Bank complete the list of the United State Minor Outlying\nIslands.)\nOverall, the islands of Micronesia are too small to be successful economically and politically alone. Thus, all of\nthese islands maintain broader connections. The Federated States of Micronesia chose to agglomerate, melding\nover 600 islands into one federation, while also linking with the United States. Palau and Guam have similar\nassociations with America, while Kiribati and Nauru share other countries\u2019 ties with Britain as members of the\nCommonwealth of Nations. Trade, tourism, and security are bolstered by these connections.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nBecause of the International Date Line, Guam experiences dawn as the first piece of American territory to enter each new day.\nOne of this textbook\u2019s authors is Professor Joel Quam, no relation to Guam.

CHAPTER 25\nPacific Realm:\nPopulation Geography II\nCOVID-19 in New Zealand\nSometimes there are advantages to being an island country. Of course, there may be disadvantages too. You\ncan\u2019t drive to the islands that are Japan nor to Iceland nor Fiji nor New Zealand. (Now you can drive through the\nChunnel (the tunnel under the English Channel) from France to England. Cost of living often is higher on islands,\ndue to the additional costs of transporting products to an island. Islands face the factor of isolation.\nNevertheless, isolation can be a good thing. In the global pandemic of COVID-19, isolation can be a positive\nfactor. At least theoretically, island countries or territories have the possibility of blocking all travel to and from\ntheir island. As you will read in Chapter 76, attempts to close an island may fail, as they did for Puerto Rico. Clearly\nfor a pandemic, land borders are much more difficult to monitor than are sea and air borders. As we see from\nAmerica\u2019s current attempt to build a wall along its border with Mexico, land borders may be crossed in a variety of\nmeans. To arrive in an island country, you need a boat or an airplane.\n112 PACIFIC REALM: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 113\nNew Zealand is an island country, featuring two\nmain islands for nearly all of the populace. It has a\npopulation of nearly five million people. In addition to\nthe inherent isolation of being an island country, New\nZealand\u2019s remote location places it far distant from\nalmost every other place on the planet. To fly to\nnearby Australia is to travel nearly 2600 miles. Yes,\nthat\u2019s right, the proximity of its nearest prominent\nneighbor is like the distance from Los Angeles to New\nBanks Peninsula, New Zealand \u2013 Photo by Bernard Spragg on York City.\nFlickr. This makes New Zealand an ideal location for a\ndemographic and medical experiment. How would a\ncontagious disease spread through an island country of five million people? Naturally, no one would set this up\nas a real experiment. Computer simulations could be run. However, COVID-19 made this a reality.\nThe first documented case of COVID-19 in New Zealand was on February 28, 2020. The initial cases of the\nvirus were travelers who had returned from Iran or Italy. New Zealand\u2019s government instituted a nearly complete\nshutdown of the country for March 24 to April 9, followed by very gradual relaxation of restrictions. International\ntravel was highly regulated, so that New Zealand citizens could return to the homeland but would face a two-week\nquarantine upon arrival. Foreigners were not allowed to enter the country. New Zealand instituted very active\nmeasures for virus testing and in contact tracing. The country tallied 1504 cases, but only 22 deaths. New Zealand\nnow has no new cases of the coronavirus, in fact, no new cases for over two weeks.\nth\nAccording to worldometers, on June 11 , 2020, New Zealand was the second most populated country that has\nno active cases of COVID-19 (Papua New Guinea was the most populated such country.). Of the 22 countries\/\nterritories with no active cases of the virus, 19 are islands. The exceptions are Laos, Montenegro, and the\nmicrostate of Vatican City. 114 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is very popular in her\ncountry, actually the most popular there in the past century. In\nmid-May 2020, a Newshub poll asked people if they felt that the\nnationwide lockdown was the right call. The poll revealed that\n91.6% of respondents said \u201cYes.\u201d I doubt if we could find any\nnational political action to have 90% support of Americans.\nAs revealed in Chapter 23, in several ways Iceland is northern\nhemisphere\u2019s version of New Zealand.

CHAPTER 26\nPacific Realm: Urban Geography II\nCapital Cities\nCountries have capital cities. The cities are selected for a variety of reasons, generally based on the social,\neconomic, and political assets that those cities hold. Sometimes countries change the locations of the capital\ncities. Let\u2019s consider the capital cities of the Pacific Realm, with particular attention to Canberra, the capital of\nAustralia. Let\u2019s do so by examining geographic concepts relating to capital cities.\nFor many countries, the capital city is an obvious choice, because that country has a primate city (see Chapter\n54). A primate city dominates its country in all urban ways, including politically. The predominant development of\nthat city may be predicated partly upon its securing and early historical designation as the capital city. Or, perhaps\nthe city already possessed so much authority and power that it became the capital city almost automatically.\nSome countries have these obvious capital cities \u2013 how else could it be? Certainly, across the world there are\nexamples, such as Bangkok, Thailand. In the Western World, here is a list of several primate cities.\n116 PACIFIC REALM: URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 117\nCountry Primate City\nArgentina Buenos Aires\nAustria Vienna\nEl Salvador San Salvador\nEngland London\nFrance Paris\nHungary Budapest\nIceland Reykjavik\nLatvia Riga\nMexico Mexico City\nNicaragua Managua\nPeru Lima\nHowever, in the Pacific Realm, the major countries of Australia and New Zealand lack primate cities, while Papua\nNew Guinea (Port Moresby) and other small islands may have primate cities \u2013 Samoa (Apia).\nIn a few cases, countries have changed their capital cities. In fact, the initial Congress of the United States held\nits session in New York City, deciding there to build a new city as the national capital \u2014 Washington in a special\ncapital territory \u2013 the District of Columbia. While this new city was being constructed, Philadelphia served a decade\nas the national capital. The designated site would be roughly centered among the new states that stretched along\nthe Atlantic sea coast.\nBrazil followed a similar course of action. Originally, Salvador was Portugal\u2019s colonial capital in the New World,\nbeginning in 1549. The ascendancy of Rio de Janeiro brought economic, demographic, and political power,\nculminating in acquisition of the colonial capital in 1763. Rio retained the capital upon Brazilian independence in\n1822. Eventually, Brazil sought to diversity political power and created the planned city of Brasilia, opening as the\ncapital city in 1960.\nOther countries such as Myanmar, Nigeria, and Pakistan have moved their capital cities as well.\nFor the Pacific Realm, Australia followed this course\ntoo. In Australia, Sydney and Melbourne both grew in\npopulation and in social, economic, and political power\nth\nand distinction. In 1901, Australia opened the 20\ncentury by declaring itself a commonwealth, a country\nand no longer a British colony, though it has retained\nits commonwealth connection with Britain to this day.\nCanberra. Photo by Greg Schechter on Flickr.\nAt that time, Sydney and Melbourne were rivals for the\ntitle of national capital; however, the newly defined\ncommonwealth established a plan to build a new city as the national capital. A piece of territory was ceded from\nNew South Wales for the construction of this planned city Canberra in the new Australian Capital Territory.\nMelbourne served as the temporary capital until 1927 when the legislature first met in Canberra. The site was\nchosen to be roughly between Melbourne and Sydney. Additionally, the decision to be somewhat inland reflected\na desire to be secure from any potential future naval attack. Clearly, there are similarities with the planned city of\nWashington, DC.\nIn certain cases, capital cities are moved or are originally sited in so-called forward locations. These forward\ncapitals are placed away from the dominant national cities, due to economic, strategic, symbolic, and diversifying\nmotivations. In these cases often the new capital city is located quite a distance inland, away from other major\ncities, and into otherwise less utilized areas. Definitely, Brasilia meets this model in Brazil, as do Eastern World 118 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ncapitals of Islamabad in Pakistan and Naypyidaw (Nay Pyi Taw) in Myanmar. For the Pacific Realm, Australia\u2019s\nCanberra is located along the string of prominent eastern coastal cities. Canberra was required to be over 100\nmiles from Sydney, but it doesn\u2019t stand out as a forward capital in the way that perhaps Alice Springs would have.\nPlanned cities are numerous across the world, but are noteworthy when chosen for design as the national\ncapital. Washington, DC, and Canberra, ACT, are similar in that regard.\nWellington was name the capital of New Zealand in 1865. It has an excellent location at the southern tip of the\nNorth Island; thus, it is very nearly at the geographic center of the country.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nA capitol is the building(s) where government happens, typically a state legislature operates there. A capital is the city where the national or\nstate government resides.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nSchechter, Greg. 2009. Canberra. https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/canberra2009.

CHAPTER 27\nPacific Realm: Overview\nIn the various essays about the Pacific Realm in this\ntextbook, there are many facts presented and many\nways of life understood. After reading the textbook,\nstudents or other readers should know and\nunderstand many things about the Pacific Realm. Also,\nPerth. Photo by Pedro Szekely on Flickr. as has been stated, it is not the point of this textbook\nto attempt to convey every possible bit of knowledge\nabout the Pacific Realm. However, there are a number\nof features of the Pacific Realm that the reader should know, whether picked up in previous chapters or not.\nPhysical Geography: Australia & New Zealand\nThe Pacific Realm is dominated in land area by Australia. Papua New Guinea and New Zealand feature large\nislands, but Australia is a continent. The rest of the Pacific Realm is made up of small and tiny islands. Actually,\nthe most common surface of the Pacific Realm is water \u2013 the Pacific Ocean.\n119 120 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSunrise Over the Pacific Ocean. NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center.\nAustralia and New Zealand share similar cultures and histories, but their landscapes couldn\u2019t be much different.\nAustralia is the world\u2019s flattest continent, dominated by the vast, flat, dry outback. The only significant mountains,\nthe Great Dividing Range, stretch north-south just inland from the southeastern coast. It is a relatively low\nmountain range, with peaks rarely exceeding 3,000 feet. New Zealand, on the other hand, is spectacularly\nmountainous, with some peaks exceeding 12,000 feet.\nAustralia and New Zealand are in the southern hemisphere, so their seasonal calendar is the opposite of the\nUnited States, as is the north-south distribution of temperatures. In Australia and New Zealand, temperatures\ndecrease as you head south. Sydney is located at around 34\u02daS latitude, a similar latitude as Atlanta, Georgia, and is\nrelatively warm. Melbourne, is at 38\u02daS latitude, similar to Louisville, Kentucky, and temperatures run a little cooler.\nChristchurch, New Zealand, is at about the same latitude as Chicago, and will remain quite a lot cooler. If you head\nnorth, things get warmer. Darwin, on the north coast of Australia, is in the tropics, at 12\u02daS latitude, approximately\nthe same distance from the equator as Managua, Nicaragua.\nThere are five major climate zones in Australia and New Zealand. The marine west coast climate is found in\nsouthwestern Australia, where the large cities of Sydney and Melbourne are located, and covers all of New Zealand\nas well. It features relatively high rates of precipitation and mild temperatures year-round. If you\u2019re wondering why\nthe east coast of Australia has a \u201cwest coast\u201d climate, look at a map. Notice that the coastline of southern Australia\nbows northward \u2013 this is called the \u201cGreat Australian Bight.\u201d Southeastern Australia is in the westerlies, where\nwinds move from west to east. These winds blow across the waters of the Great Australian Bight before they arrive\nin Sydney and Melbourne, and keep those locations relatively wet and mild. Up the east coast of Australia, toward PACIFIC REALM: OVERVIEW 121\nBrisbane, is a humid subtropical climate. It is similar to the climate of Sydney \u2013 wet year-round, but it runs a little\nwarmer, since it\u2019s closer to the equator.\nThe vast majority of Australia\u2019s interior is dominated by steppe and desert climates. This region is popularly\nknown as Australia\u2019s \u201coutback\u201d or \u201cbush.\u201d The heart of Australia is a desert, receiving less than ten inches of\nrainfall per year. It is ringed by the semi-arid steppe. These climates are dry because of a huge subtropical high\nthat hangs over much of Australia year-round. The Mediterranean climate is found in found on parts of the\nAustralia\u2019s southern coast, near Adelaide, and its southwestern coast, near Perth. In the summertime, Australia\u2019s\nsubtropical high shifts south, creating dry conditions. During the winter, the subtropical high shifts north, as\ndo the westerlies, bringing rainy conditions. It\u2019s a maritime climate, so temperatures are relatively mild year-\nround. A tropical savanna climate is found along Australia\u2019s north coast. In the summertime, the intertropical\nconvergence zone (ITCZ) shifts south, bringing very wet conditions. In wintertime, the subtropical high shifts north,\nbringing dry conditions.\nPhysical Geography: The Pacific Islands\nThe Pacific Islands have historically been grouped together into three subregions. As discussed in Chapters 12,\n15, 17, and 24, these are Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.\nMelanesia consists of large, elongated islands with a central mountain spine. They were created by the same\nforces of tectonic folding and volcanism that created the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines.\nThe islands of Micronesia and Polynesia are all relatively small, and of volcanic origin. They consist of three\nvarieties\u2014high islands, low islands, and atolls. These islands are all created by the same process. They\u2019re simply\nin different stages of their lifespan. High islands are characterized by a central volcanic mountain. Often, coral will\nattach to the side of the volcano. As the volcano erodes, earth piles on top of the coral reef, creating a narrow, flat\ncoastal ring.\nOver the next few thousand years, the dormant volcano slowly erodes away, forming a low island. Eventually,\nthe volcano may erode away entirely, leaving only the narrow coastal ring. These circular or semi-circular islands\nthat surround a central lagoon where the volcano used to be are known as atolls.\nHistorical and Cultural Geography: Australia and New Zealand\nAustralia\u2019s indigenous population, the Aborigines, arrived on the continent 50,000 years ago. New Zealand\u2019s\nindigenous people, the Maori, are comparatively recent arrivals, having moved in from Polynesia less than 1,000\nyears ago.\nThe first Europeans began arriving in the 1500s. Famously, some of the first British settlements in Australia\nwere penal colonies \u2013 places where debtors and criminals were exiled. Convicts did not account for the majority\nof British colonizers, for many others came for different reasons, in particular a gold rush. As European settlers\ndid in the Americas, the they slaughtered, displaced, and marginalized the indigenous population. The Aborigines,\nwhich most people associate with the Outback, primarily lived along the southeastern coast where Sydney and\nMelbourne now are. Just as Native Americans were herded onto undesirable reservations in the Great Plains and\nDesert Southwest in the U.S., the Aborigines were forced into the Outback. Today, Aborigines account for about\n1-2% of Australia\u2019s population. The Maori account for 17% of New Zealand\u2019s population, probably aiding them in\ngaining a relatively more significant role in their respective lands.\nBoth Australia and New Zealand are now mainly British in language, religion, politics, and ethnicity, as indicated\nby the presence of the British Union Jack on the flags of both countries. Because of their isolated location, these\ncountries received much less immigration in the 1800s than did the United States, although some immigrants did\ntrickle in from Ireland, Italy, Germany, Greece, and the Netherlands. Today, Australia is about 95% white, and New\nZealand is about 64% white.\nFor years, both countries had racially biased immigration policies. Until the 1970s, it was difficult for non-white\nimmigrants to move to either country. Since then, there has been more migration from Asia. Australia\u2019s population 122 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nis about 4% Asian, primarily Chinese and Indian. New Zealand is about 12% Asian, primarily Chinese, Indian, and\nFilipino. Additionally, about 8% of New Zealand\u2019s population are Pacific Islanders.\nHistorical and Cultural Geography: The Pacific Islands\nThe Austronesian Expansion was covered in Chapter 15. The majority of these islands\u2019 people are indigenous,\nmaking up 80% of the overall population. Only 13% of the population are the descendants of more recent arrivals\nfrom Asia. About 7% of the population is of European ancestry.\nMost of the indigenous people speak languages from the Austronesian language family, while French and\nEnglish are common lingua francas. Christian missionaries, mainly from the United States and Europe, began to\narrive on the islands in the 1700s and 1800s. The vast majority of the region\u2019s population adopted Christianity, and\ncontinue to practice it, although it is common to find Christianity fused to traditional indigenous religious beliefs.\nThe role of the Lutheran Church in Papua New Guinea was explained in Chapter 20. In some locations, indigenous\nreligions continue to be practiced exclusively. Hinduism is the largest non-Christian religion, specifically the leading\nreligion in Fiji, where it arrived with Indian tea plantation workers in the 1800s. Small pockets of Buddhism and\nIslam are found where other Asian groups have settled.\nPopulation Geography: Australia and New Zealand\nth th\nAustralia ranks about 50 in the world among country populations, with New Zealand about 125 . Australia\nis one of the four least densely populated countries on Earth, along with Namibia, Iceland, and Mongolia. New\nZealand is not so extreme, but still is not at all crowded, being similar to Norway and Finland with about 18\npeople per square kilometers. Australia has a land area of 3 million square miles, about the same size as 48\nconterminous U.S. states, but its population is almost 25 million, which is smaller than Texas. New Zealand\u2019s land\narea is 104,000 square miles, about the same as Colorado, but its population is just 5 million, about the same as\nAlabama. Australia\u2019s highest population densities are found along the southeastern coast, while New Zealand\u2019s\nhighest densities are on its northern island.\nBoth countries are highly urbanized. Australia\u2019s high urban centralization was highlighted in Chapter 19. New\nZealand is 86% urban, with 31% of its population living in the largest city, Auckland.\nAustralia and New Zealand have low birth rates. New Zealand\u2019s TFR is 1.9, and Australia\u2019s is 1.7, both below\nreplacement rate. Like the United States, Canada, and Europe, Australia and New Zealand have aging populations\nand declining population growth rates. They face similar economic issues related to the decline in labor,\nconsumers, and the tax base. Although both countries eliminated the racial biases in their immigration policies\nyears ago, those policies are still pretty restrictive. Both countries might have to consider liberalizing their\nimmigration stances to boost population growth.\nPopulation Geography: The Pacific Islands\nThe Pacific Realm is a vast region, but most of it is water. Excluding Papua New Guinea, the total land area of\nall the islands adds up to just 87,000 square miles, which is smaller than Oregon. The total population of all the\nislands is about 3 million, which about the same as Arkansas. The largest city is Suva, Fiji, which has a population\nof 180,000, a little smaller than Springfield, Illinois. PACIFIC REALM: OVERVIEW 123\nPopulation growth rates are moderate in the Pacific Realm. Three\ncountries have TFRs that are above the world average: the Solomon\nIslands (3.0), Tuvalu (2.9), and Tonga (2.9). Five countries have TFRs\nat or below the world average, but above replacement rate:\nVanuatu (2.8), Nauru (2.7), Fiji (2.3), the Federated States of\nMicronesia (2.3), and Kiribati (2.3). Only one country is below\nreplacement rate, and that\u2019s Palau (1.7).\nPolitical and Economic Geography: Australia and New\nZealand\nThe official head of state of both Australia and New Zealand is\nQueen Elizabeth II of Britain, although that relationship is largely\nsymbolic. Both countries have been full democracies since their\nMataso Island, Vanuatu.\nindependence from Britain in the early 1900s, and their\nPhoto by David Stanley on Flickr.\ngovernments rate as some of the least corrupt in the world.\nBoth countries enjoy high standards of living. According to the\nHuman Development Index, Australia is tied for the sixth best level of development (or generally, standard of living\nor quality of life), while Neew Zealand ranks fourteenth. This might be surprising, given the historic nature of the\nregion\u2019s economies.\nFor years, the economies of Australia and New Zealand were based on the export of raw materials. New Zealand\nhas abundant pasture land, and Australia has the greatest non-oil mineral wealth per capita of any country on\nearth. As is discussed in Chapter 4, countries with economies that depend on raw materials are usually poor. In\nAustralia and New Zealand, however, the resources were so vast, and the populations so small, that there was\nplenty of wealth to go around.\nAgain given the larger landmass, Australia\ndominates the region in terms of raw materials. As of\n2012, Australia had:\n\u2022 51% of the world\u2019s antimony\n\u2022 34% of the world\u2019s bauxite\n\u2022 38% of the world\u2019s black coal\nKalgoorlie Mining in Western Australia. Photo by Tor Lindstrand on\nFlickr. \u2022 51% of the world\u2019s cobalt\n\u2022 28% of the world\u2019s copper\n\u2022 55% of the world\u2019s diamonds\n\u2022 42% of the world\u2019s gold (see the so-called Super Pit, pictured above)\n\u2022 34% of the world\u2019s iron ore\n\u2022 45% of the world\u2019s lead\n\u2022 55% of the world\u2019s lithium\n\u2022 72% of the world\u2019s manganese\n\u2022 39% of the world\u2019s molybdenum\n\u2022 90% of the world\u2019s opals\n\u2022 67% of the world\u2019s rare earths 124 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n\u2022 36% of the world\u2019s silver\n\u2022 48% of the world\u2019s tantalum\n\u2022 61% of the world\u2019s tin\n\u2022 51% of the world\u2019s tungsten\n\u2022 34% of the world\u2019s uranium\n\u2022 50% of the world\u2019s zinc.\nNow in 2020, Australia leads the world in exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG), a means of selling their natural gas\noutput without using pipelines (under the ocean?).\nThe extensive land area also is heavily utilized in agriculture, sometimes for crops such as wheat and sugar\ncane, but significantly for ranching \u2013 cattle and sheep. Comparatively, New Zealand has significant dairy and sheep\nfarming.\nWith this wealth, Australia and New Zealand invested heavily in infrastructure and education, which gave rise to\nthriving service and information sectors. What\u2019s also unusual about this region\u2019s economies is that they essentially\nskipped the industrial phase of economic development. Neither is a major manufacturer.\nFinally, tourism has become a significant component of both countries\u2019 economies. For years, they were too\nremote to attract many tourists, but as airplanes got bigger, faster, and more efficient in the 1980s, Australia\nand New Zealand were suddenly within reach of the rest of the world. The famously attractive scenery of both\ncountries began to draw millions of tourists. The fact that Australia and New Zealand could serve up summer\nweather during the northern hemisphere\u2019s winter was also a major boost, as was the fact that both countries\nserved as the backdrop for some wildly popular movie franchises.\nPolitical and Economic Geography: The Pacific Islands\nMost of the Pacific Islands were colonized between 1840 and 1900. The major colonial powers were Britain,\nFrance, Germany, the United States, and Japan. Most of the countries achieved independence between 1960 and\n1990. Today, most of the countries are democracies, with a few exceptions. The Solomon Islands and Fiji are\npartial democracies, with recent histories of instability and corruption. Tonga is a monarchy, with few democratic\ninstitutions.\nThere are few remaining colonies in the Pacific Realm. New Caledonia, French Polynesia, and the Wallis Islands PACIFIC REALM: OVERVIEW 125\nare colonies of France. Guam, the Mariana Islands, and American Samoa are colonies of the United States. The\nCook Islands are a colony of New Zealand.\nThe Pacific Realm is a relatively poor region. Palau and Tonga have standards of living that are close to the\nworld average. Fiji, Nauru, Vanuatu, and the Federated States of Micronesia are below the world average. The\npoorest countries are Kiribati, the Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu, where standards of living are well below the world\naverage. Much of the region\u2019s population live in small villages, dependent upon root crops, tree crops, pig farming,\nand fishing.\nFor the small islands of the Pacific Realm, the random chance of having noteworthy raw materials is low. As\ndescribed in Chapter 21, Nauru had the odd circumstance of huge phosphate deposits from bird droppings. New\nCaledonia does beat the odds with raw materials, especially in heavy deposits of nickel ore.\nOne reason that these countries are relatively poor is because they lack investment capital. It is difficult to fund\neconomic development if you don\u2019t have any funds. Many of the islands also lack valuable raw materials. But the\ngreatest economic problem is distance. These are some of the most remote places on earth, and that is a huge\neconomic liability that bogs down the potential of almost every economic activity in the region.\nTourism is an important industry, for obvious reasons. For many, the climate and landscapes of the Pacific\nislands are the stuff of dreams. But these islands are so far away from the major population centers of the world\nthat tourism potential remains limited. Plantation farming and mining are also important activities, but again,\ndistance limits their profitability, since producers in other parts of the world are closer to potential markets. About\nthe only industries that benefits from the remoteness of the Pacific Realm are military and maritime services.\nSome islands are home to major naval bases and shipping terminals, since they are sometimes the only dry land\naround for hundreds of miles.\nOverall: Isolation\nA dominant element of the Pacific Realm is its\nrelative isolation. Hawaii and Easter Island are some of\nthe most remote places on the planet. Isolation makes\nthe Austronesian Expansion even more impressive.\nWhen compared to other parts of the globe, Australia\u2019s\nisolation led to its late European discovery and\nsettlement. Nevertheless, this isolation meant that\nAustralia was relatively empty, a feature that the\nBritish utilized in their colonization and eventually\nclaim of all of the landmass. Strikingly, this settlement\nmainly began with the shipping of convicts to Australia\nto settle that new land. The original settlers of\nDigital rendering of the satellite view of the Pacific Ocean. Australia brought with them the English language;\nhowever, the isolation of this place, both in distance\nand in separation from British civilization, endeavored\nthe language to evolve, so that modern Australian English has a distinctive accent and numerous words that do\nnot fit into British English nor into other regional variations of English (such as American English). Similar linguistic\nchanges happened in New Zealand, as seen in \u201cZealand speak.\u201d 126 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn addition, isolation created a unique set of wildlife in Australia with some unusual animals and others that can\nbe found only in Australia. This land down under is famous for the kangaroo and certainly known for the platypus\nand the koala. Wallace\u2019s Line and Weber\u2019s Line are two scholars\u2019 works to delineate the separate Asian animal\nspecies (fauna) from Australian animal species.\nBeautiful Pacific islands in tropical settings offer very appealing tourist destinations; however, the isolating\ndistances to these islands is a deterrent to some potential tourists choose not to overcome. Similarly, Australia\u2019s\neconomy includes a major tourist sector, partly existent because of exotic elements present because of its\nisolation, while at the same time partly diminished because of the costs of distance as created by the same\nisolation.\nOverall, the Pacific Realm is a fascinating region, largely dominated by Australia, and strongly influenced by its\nisolation.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe koala is not a bear. Although the koala looks like a cuddly teddy bear, it is in the marsupial category and not at all related to bears.\nWe compared Norway and New Zealand in Chapter 23. As noted above, the countries also compare well in terms of population density. Is\nthat a curious coincidence or do their similar landscapes have the same impact on human habitation?\nThe word conterminous, as used in the text above, means \u201chaving a common boundary.\u201d The nearly identical word coterminous can mean\nthe same thing, but also may mean \u201cbeing of equal duration, extent, or scope.\u201d Additionally, the word contiguous means \u201csharing a common\nborder.\u201d Thankfully, there is no word cotiguous.\nHot Off the Press\nFor a spectacular map of the languages of New Guinea, go to: https:\/\/www.muturzikin.com\/cartesoceanie\/oceanie2.htm PACIFIC REALM: OVERVIEW 127\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nChen, Jackson. 2020. \u201cAustralia Takes Crown as World\u2019s Top LNG Exporter | U.S. & International.\u201d JWN Energy.\nJanuary 8, 2020. https:\/\/www.jwnenergy.com\/article\/2020\/1\/australia-takes-crown-worlds-top-lng-exporter\/.\nGeoscience Australia. 2014. \u201cResources.\u201d Www.Ga.Gov.Au.

CHAPTER 28\nNorth America\nHow do we define this region?\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive region. A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared characteristics over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nDefining North America is both simple and yet not quite meeting a consensus. North America is comprised by\nCanada and the United States. Both of these countries were British colonies with a touch of French influence.\nBoth countries rank in the top five countries of the world by area, as each stretches from Pacific Ocean to Atlantic\nOcean. These countries share the longest international land border in the world. Their cultures, economies, and\npolitics are similar, though not quite the same. The countries are friendly allies.\n128 NORTH AMERICA 129\nAs a landmass, the North American continent extends from\nnorthern Canada to Panama. This fact leads to the argument that\nthe North American region includes Mexico and maybe other\ncountries. As you will read in Chapter 63, most geographers assert\nthat the cultural and linguistic similarities within Central America\nmatch well as part of Latin America, instead of pairing the\ncontrasting cultures and languages of Central America against the\nBritish cultural ties and English language of the United States and\nCanada.\nEuropean Colonies in North America, 1763.\nCartography by Steven Banas.\nThe island of Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark, while being a part of the North American\ncontinental formation.

CHAPTER 29\nNorth America: Regional Example\nThe American Midwest\n\u201cWhat geography can give all Middle Westerners, along with the fresh water and topsoil, if they let it, is awe for an\nEdenic continent stretching forever in all directions. Makes you religious. Takes your breath away.\u201d\n\u2022 Kurt Vonnegut\nWhen I grew up in Minnesota, it was quite apparent to me that the Midwest region of the United States was\na set of five states \u2013 Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. When I later moved away\nfrom Minnesota, I was surprised to learn that other Americans had different definitions of the Midwest than I\ndid. Furthermore, these other definitions were not all the same, but offered multiple variations.\nSo, how do we define the American Midwest? Well, the US Census Bureau cites the Midwest as those five states\nlisted above, plus Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas \u2013 thus, twelve states in total.\n130 NORTH AMERICA: REGIONAL EXAMPLE 131\nIn 2014, the website fivethirtyeight.com used a SurveyMonkey Audience of self-selected Midwesterners to\ndefine the region. Indiana, Illinois, and Iowa received the highest scores with over 70% of respondents indicating\nthat these states are in the Midwest. A few, about 10%, voters let Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado into the\nMidwest, choices that I consider felonious. Similarly, a few offered Midwestern status to Pennsylvania and West\nVirginia. No!\nSo, here is Rule #1. Midwestern states do not have mountains!\nSouth Dakota comes close, but its Black Hills are called hills after\nall. Colorado\u2019s Rocky Mountains disqualify it (and Wyoming and\nMontana too) as a Midwestern entry, as do the Appalachian\nMountains for Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\nIn 2019, Citylab.com also attempted to settle this question of\nMidwestern membership. Their survey appears to be open still for\nsubmissions. The pattern of their respondents\u2019 opinions matches\nwell with the US Census Bureau\u2019s twelve states, for all these states\nare marked with counties showing 80% or higher self-designation\nas Midwestern. Several other states showed a bit, but scant\nsupport. Shockingly, Texas, Georgia, and Rhode Island had more\nThe Midwest.\nthan zero support. Wrong! Rule #2 \u2013 Midwestern states do not\nCartography by Melissa Jankovic.\nborder the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, or the Gulf of Mexico.\nMidwestern states may, but are not required to, border one or\nmore of the Great Lakes.\nThis is a popular and divisive topic. In 2016, Vox.com also gave it a shot. Over 34 thousand readers voted.\nIowa won, receiving 95% of the vote as a Midwestern state. The Census Bureau\u2019s dozen were the top twelve vote\ngetters, with North Dakota coming in twelfth with 45% of the votes.\nWhat else is true about the Midwest?\nA \u2013 Farming. 132 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture, \u201cin 2018, the top 10 agricultural producing States in terms of\ncash receipts were (in descending order): California, Iowa, Texas, Nebraska, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas, North\nCarolina, Wisconsin, and Indiana.\u201d Seven of these states are in the Midwest. This is not to say that everyone in the\nMidwest is a farmer. No, even in Iowa where 85% of the land is farmed, only 5% of the people are farmers. Instead,\nwe understand that farming is economically important, if not crucial, in Midwestern states. Wisconsin is renowned\nfor its dairy industry. Iowa leads the United States in hogs and corn. North Dakota and Kansas lead in wheat.\nB \u2013 Glacial landscapes. NORTH AMERICA: REGIONAL EXAMPLE 133\nAs noted, Midwestern states do not have mountains nor do they\nhave deserts. The Ice Age\u2019s Laurentian Ice Sheet stretched from\nwhat is now Canada into what is now the United States. As shown\nby Idaho State University\u2019s map at https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/midwest-\nregion , the glacial maximum reached all the Midwestern states,\nincluding full coverage of Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and\nMichigan. The thousands of lakes in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and\nMichigan were carved by glaciers as they receded.

In the Midwest we find the largest shares of Northern European\nancestry and other somewhat northern European ancestries. It is noteworthy that these ethnic patterns are\ngenerally uncommon in the rest of the United States. (Note that California, due to its very large population of\nabout forty million people, has lots of peoples of many ethnicities.) 134 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn sum, the American Midwest is larger than my childhood vision\nunderstood. The list of twelve states, as provided by the US Census\nBureau, is best. Midwestern states lack mountains and ocean\ncoastlines, but feature an emphasis on farming, glacial landscapes,\nand atypical European heritage.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nFormerly there was an American Mideast Conference made up of collegiate\nsports teams in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and Massachusetts.

CHAPTER 30\nNorth America: Cultural Geography I\nReligion in the United States, part one\nIn this essay, we\u2019ll examine the religious geography of the United States, including a look at the origin and\ntraits of some denominations and movements that are particularly common in the U.S. For a more general\nlook at religion, see Chapter 3. The origins and traits of Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and\nProtestantism are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 48. The origins and traits of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism,\nand Buddhism are not covered here for they predominantly are found in the other half of the world \u2013 the Eastern\nWorld.\nPROTESTANTS\nAbout 71% of Americans identify as Christian, and there are many different denominations of Christianity in\nthe United States. Protestants account for just under half the U.S. population (47%), and the single largest\nProtestant denomination are the Baptists (15% of Americans). The Baptist movement began when a group of\n135 136 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nEnglish reformers broke from the Anglican Church. It was a relatively small movement in England, but flourished\nin the United States.\nAnother 15% of Americans identify with various churches that are sometimes collectively referred to as Mainline\nProtestant. The term \u201cMainline\u201d is not strictly defined, but it implies a few things. First, Mainline churches\nare usually theologically moderate, rather than fundamentalist. That means that most members of Mainline\nchurches look to the Bible for truths, but agree that some of the stories, particularly those of the Old Testament,\nmight be symbolic parables, rather than a strict record of facts. This makes them distinct from some of the\nmore conservative or fundamentalists denominations, such as some Baptist, Pentecostal, Evangelical, or non-\ndenominational churches. Second, mainline churches tend to be fairly traditional in their worship, and have not\ngenerally embraced the more contemporary approach of some Evangelical churches. Third, Mainline churches\ntend to be somewhat apolitical, although many have actively promoted social justice and civil rights movements.\nFinally, Mainline churches might be thought of as \u201cnational\u201d churches. Although some of them tend to be more\nnumerous in certain parts of the country, Mainline churches can typically be found in nearly any city of even\nmodest size anywhere in the United States.\nFour Protestant denominations account for the largest numbers\nof Mainline Protestants: Methodists (5% of the U.S. population),\nLutherans (4%), Presbyterians (2%), and Episcopalians (1%).\nMethodism began as a reform movement within the Church of\nEngland, and soon spread to much of the British Empire, with its\ngreatest success coming in the United States. Lutheranism was\ninitially an immigrant Church, associated with Germans and\nScandinavians, but as German-Americans became the single\nlargest ethnic group in the country, and spread to nearly every part\nof it, Lutheran churches were soon found nationwide. The\nPresbyterian Church is a Calvinist church that was founded in\nScotland, and made its way to the U.S. with Scottish immigrants.\nThe Episcopal Church is essentially the Church of England in the\nUnited States. After the Revolutionary War, Anglicans in the U.S.\ncould no longer accept the King of England as the official head of\ntheir Church. So, they separated to form their own organization,\nalthough Episcopalians are still part of the global Anglican\ncommunion.\nIn stark contrast to the Mainline churches is the Pentecostal\nChurch, which accounts for about 4% of the U.S. population.\nOriginating in Kansas in the early 1900s, Pentecostalism is a\nfundamentalist movement. Fundamentalists tend to view the Bible\nas strictly factual and unerring. And while most Mainline churches\ntend to feature formal liturgical services, in Pentecostal churches,\nImage by Ricarda M\u00f6lck from Pixabay.\nsermons and prayers are to be extemporaneous expressions of the\nHoly Spirit, and the services can therefore be pretty lively. The\nPentecostal movement is often seen as the predecessor of the later Evangelical movement.\nAbout 14% of Americans are non-denominational Protestants. They are members of churches that are part of\nthe Protestant lineage, but which don\u2019t adhere to the doctrine of any larger church organization. Such churches\ndevelop their doctrine, for lack of a better term, \u201cin house.\u201d There have long been non-denominational churches\nin the United States, but their popularity rose sharply in the 1970s, particularly in large urban and suburban\n\u201cmegachurches.\u201d Many of the converts to this new movement in Christianity had grown up in Mainline Protestant NORTH AMERICA: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 137\ndenominations. Frustrated or bored with the traditionalism of the Mainline, they sought churches that were more\ncontemporary in their worship and personalized in their approach. Often times, these churches would crystalize\naround a particularly popular pastor. Many of these churches are closely connected to the modern Evangelical\nmovement.\nROMAN CATHOLICS AND ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS\nThere are more than twice as many Protestants as Catholics in the United States, but because Protestants are so\nhighly fragmented, the Roman Catholic Church is actually the single largest religions organization in the country,\naccounting for about 21% of all Americans. Eastern Orthodox Christians account for a much smaller share, about\n1%.\nOTHER CHRISTIAN GROUPS\nMormons, who account for about 2% of the U.S. population, are followers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter\nDay Saints (sometimes abbreviated as the LDS Church). Founded in western New York state in the 1830s, LDS\nbeliefs are based on the Christian Bible, but also on the teachings of the church\u2019s founder and prophet, Joseph\nSmith. Smith attempted to establish a Mormon community in western Missouri, but was driven out of the state.\nSmith and his followers retreated to Illinois, where Smith was murdered by a mob for some of his controversial\nteachings. In the 1840s, the Church\u2019s new leader, Brigham Young, led his followers to Utah, where the largest LDS\norganization is still based. Mormons are well-known for their missionary zeal, and LDS churches are now found\nthroughout the United States and the world. Another church with origins in New York state, and likewise famous\nfor its missionary proselytizing, are the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, who account for about 1% of the U.S. population.\nFor a map showing the distribution of American religious affiliations by county, go to https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/\ncountyreligion. 138 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nEVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY\nThe term \u201cevangelism\u201d in Christianity simply refers to spreading the word of Christ, and has been used by\nChristians for centuries. One of the largest Lutheran groups in the United States is called the \u201cEvangelical Lutheran\nth\nChurch of America.\u201d Since the middle of the 20 century, however, the term \u201cEvangelical Christian\u201d has come to\nrefer to a specific movement within Christianity.\nTo begin, it is a trans-denominational movement, meaning that members of multiple Christian denominations\nidentify as Evangelical. Some Mainline Protestants, and even some Catholics, have adopted the term. But those\nidentifying as Evangelical are far more likely to be Baptist, Pentecostal, or non-denominational. Because it is a\ncultural movement, and not a specific church organization, a concise definition is difficult, but it usually implies\nfour things. First, Evangelical Christians are likely to be fundamentalists \u2013 believing in the strict historical accuracy\nof the Bible. Second, Evangelicals believe that one must renew their faith in Christ, which is why they are\nsometimes referred to as \u201cBorn Again\u201d Christians. Third, Evangelicals take seriously the traditional definition of the\nterm, and make significant efforts to convert non-believers to Christianity. Finally, Evangelicals usually believe that\ntheir religious lives should intersect with every aspect of their personal lives.\nThe term Evangelical has also taken on three other connotations, which are true of many, but certainly not\nall, Evangelicals. First, Evangelical worship often reflects traditions established by the Pentecostal movement\n\u2013 it tends to be contemporary and lively. Second, some Evangelical movements preach a \u201cprosperity gospel,\u201d\npromising rewards not only in heaven, but in this life as well. Third, Evangelical Christianity has generally been\nassociated with conservative politics. It has been said, somewhat sarcastically, that the most accurate definition\nof an Evangelical is \u201cwhite, Christian, and Republican,\u201d and Evangelicals are certainly a force to be reckoned with\nin Republican politics. That said, the political ideology of the movement may be shifting somewhat. Many younger\nEvangelicals tend to be far less conservative than their parents and grandparents, particularly regarding such\nissues as gay rights and climate change.\nNON-RELIGIOUS AMERICANS\nAbout 23% of Americans do not identify with any particular religious group. Of the three categories of non-\nreligious individuals, 16% identify as unaffiliated, 4% as agnostic, and 3% as atheist. NORTH AMERICA: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 139\nOTHER RELIGIONS\nJudaism has long been the largest non-Christian religion in the United States. About 40% of the world\u2019s Jews live in\nthe U.S., and they make up about 2% of the country\u2019s population. Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus each account\nfor about 1% of the population. All other religions collectively account for around 2%.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nChokshi, Niraj. 2013. \u201cReligion in America\u2019s States and Counties, in 6 Maps.\u201d Washington Post.

CHAPTER 31\nNorth America:\nEconomic Geography I\nGeography of the Post-Industrial Era\nIn Chapter 4, we defined the four sectors of the economy: the primary sector (raw materials extraction), the\nsecondary sector (manufacturing), the tertiary sector (services), and quaternary sector (information). During\nthe preindustrial era, the American economy revolved around the primary sector. In the industrial era, the\nAmerican economy was focused on the secondary sector. In the current postindustrial era, more and more\nAmerican livelihoods are dependent on the tertiary and quaternary sectors.\nEach era has reshaped the geography of the United States. During the preindustrial phase, the American\npopulation was mostly rural, and the country\u2019s geography was highly dependent upon the location of raw\nmaterials. In the primary sector, mining has to take place where the minerals are; fishing has to take place where\nthe fish are; timber has to take place where the trees are, and farming is heavily dependent upon the geography\nof soils and climate. As discussed in Chapter 32, American cities evolved along coasts, lakes, rivers, canals, and\nrailroads in order transport and process those raw materials. Those same cities blossomed during the industrial\nera, when manufacturers found them to be convenient places to accumulate raw materials and components, and\nto distribute finished products, as in the Steel Belt.\n140 NORTH AMERICA: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 141\nHere, we will examine the geography of the postindustrial era. How has the rise of employment in the tertiary\nand quaternary sectors changed the geography of the country?\nTHE TERTIARY SECTOR\nThe tertiary sector is the service sector, in which workers provide services to businesses and consumers.\nExamples of the tertiary sector include transportation, retail, wholesale, food service, telecommunications,\nproperty maintenance, health care, live entertainment, and public services like police and fire departments, social\nwork, and the military. Because much of the service sector revolves around proximity to potential consumers, the\ntertiary sector largely reinforced the geography that already existed in the United States \u2013 it did little to rearrange\nit.\nth\nOne major exception is tourism, which is one of the largest components of the tertiary sector. In the 20\ncentury, as incomes rose in America and around the world, and as modes of transportation became cheaper\nand faster, more and more people engaged in recreational travel. Some of that travel was to cities that grew up\nduring the industrial era. New York, Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, Washington, Boston, and Nashville are\nall particularly popular destinations, and tourism is integral to the economies of those and other American cities.\nStill, there are many towns and cities around the country that grew up almost entirely around the tourism\nindustry. The evolution of places like Las Vegas, Nevada; Orlando, Florida; Sedona, Arizona; Branson, Missouri;\nNapa, California; and Aspen, Colorado is tied almost entirely to tourism. The same can be said for hundreds of\ncities and towns along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts, along the upper Great Lakes, in the hills and mountains\nof the Northeast and the Upland South, in the mountains and canyonlands of the West, and on the islands of\nHawaii. 142 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nTHE QUATERNARY SECTOR\nThe quaternary sector deals with generating, managing, and interpreting information. Finance, media,\ntechnology, education, consulting, engineering, and research are just a few examples of this sector. It is the fastest-\ngrowing sector of the American economy, and is emerging as a leading employer for college-educated Americans.\nThe quaternary sector enjoys much more geographic freedom than the other three economic sectors. This\ninformation sector is essentially a \u201cweightless\u201d economy. Theoretically, information sector jobs can be performed\njust about anywhere. If you\u2019re designing software, or analyzing risk for an insurance firm, you don\u2019t rely on raw\nmaterials or transportation. Still, there is some geography to the quaternary sector. The quaternary sector has\nthrived in four kinds of places: large metropolitan areas, places near large university complexes, in places with\nspecialized labor pools, and in places with attractive topography and climates.\nLike the secondary sector, the quaternary sector tends to favor large metropolitan areas. Workers in this sector\nare often highly educated, and different firms will actively compete with one another for the most talented\nemployees. Large metropolitan areas offer more amenities to potential employees, meaning that they offer more\ninteresting stuff to do. If two firms are competing for the same employee, and one firm is located in New York City,\nand the other is located in Wichita, the firm in New York is likely to win that battle. Also, large cities have a bigger\npool of potential employees, which makes labor cheaper.\nThe quaternary sector is also thriving near large university complexes \u2013 places that have several prestigious\ncolleges or universities. Such places offer a larger pool of college graduates to recruit from. Also, universities\nare the epicenter of cutting-edge research, and quaternary sector firms often consult and partner with these\nuniversities, so being in close proximity to them is beneficial. Universities are to the Information Age what coals\nmines were to the Industrial Revolution.\nA prime example of this is Silicon Valley, just south of San Francisco. Its proper name is the Santa Clara Valley,\nand it falls right between Stanford University and Cal-Berkeley, two global leaders in software design and research.\nRoute 128 is another example. A globally prominent research corridor, Route 128 is located in Boston, the home\nof Harvard, MIT, and many other leading colleges and universities. Chicago is yet another example. Unlike many\nother Midwestern industrial cities, Chicago has made a smoother transition to the post-industrial era, largely\nbecause it is bookended by Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, two of the most prestigious\nresearch universities in the country. NORTH AMERICA: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 143\nThis economic importance of colleges and universities can be\nfound throughout the country. If you examine any state, and ask which city is doing the best economically, it\u2019s\noften home to a flagship university. Ohio and Michigan, for example, are two states that have suffered from\nsignificant industrial decline. Still, places like Columbus (home of Ohio State), East Lansing (Michigan State), and\nAnn Arbor (Michigan), have fared pretty well because of their universities.\nAdditionally, highly specialized fields within the quaternary sector are often already concentrated in a particular\ncity. Those wishing to work in that field are wise to move to that city, and firms in the field are practically required\nto locate there if they want to find employees. Examples include advertising in New York, auto engineering in\nDetroit, software development in Boston and San Francisco, food research and marketing in Chicago, and different\nsegments of the entertainment industry in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Nashville, and Austin.\nFinally, and somewhat ironically, environment has played a major role in the quaternary sector\u2019s reshaping of\nAmerican geography. It is ironic because the information sector is largely divorced from environmental needs.\nBut just as large cities can lure potential employees, so can attractive environments. This is known as amenity\nmigration \u2013 migration driven by preferences for certain kinds of natural environments. Often, amenity migration\nis driven by topography \u2013 a lot of Americans prefer mountainous environments and the recreational opportunities\nthat go along with them. This explains the recent population boom in states like Colorado and Utah. But the\nfar more important factor has been climate. Given the choice, more Americans prefer to live in places with mild\nwinters. A college graduate who is offered one job in Buffalo, and another in San Diego, is far more likely to choose\nthe job in San Diego. 144 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThis subset of amenity migration is known as\nSunbelt migration. Definitions of the Sunbelt vary,\nbut it is most often associated with states in the\nAmerican South, Southwest, and West Coast.\nCalifornia, Texas, Georgia, Florida, Nevada, and\nArizona best exemplify the Sunbelt. Sunbelt migration\naccelerated in the 1950s with the evolution of the\nquaternary sector, and shows few signs of slowing\ndown. The effects of Sunbelt migration can be seen in\nthe table below, which shows the twenty largest\nAmerican metropolitan areas in 1950, and again in\n2010:\nSELECTED AMERICAN CITIES, RANKED BY\nState Growth Rates between 1950 and 2010.

CHAPTER 32\nNorth America:\nHistorical Geography I\nTransportation and Urban Location\nThe history of the United States, and its current geography, have been deeply influenced by transportation,\nand nothing has shaped the American map more than water transportation. Water was far and away the most\nimportant means of domestic transport until the late 1800s, and is still a primary means by which products\nare shipped into, out of, and around the country. Because of this, water was by far the most important factor\ndetermining the location of major American cities, particularly in the eastern half of the country. More often than\nnot, the initial economic activity that created these cities was shipping on an ocean, lake, canal, or river. Water\ntraffic was essential to the founding of major American cities in five different regions:\n\u2022 The Atlantic Coast (the East Coast): For years, most American imports and exports came into and\nwent out of the country via the Atlantic Ocean. So, it\u2019s not coincidental that some of the country\u2019s\nmost important cities evolved as major ports on the East Coast. Such cities include New York, Boston,\nPhiladelphia, and Baltimore. For years, the American South was far less industrialized than the Northeast,\nso its Atlantic ports were not nearly as important. Still, many major southern cities began life as an Atlantic\n146 NORTH AMERICA: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 147\nport, such as Miami, Norfolk, and Jacksonville.\n\u2022 The Mississippi Valley (the Central Coast): As the interior of the country was opened to non-native\nsettlement, the Mississippi River and its tributaries were the primary means of moving people and goods\naround the central U.S. You can think of the Mississippi Valley as being a sort of \u201cCentral Coast.\u201d The\nprimary Mississippi River ports were Minneapolis, St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans. The cities of\nPittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Louisville sprang up as ports along the Ohio River (as did Nashville via the\nCumberland River), and the cities of Kansas City and Omaha began as ports on the Missouri River.\n\u2022 The Great Lakes (the North Coast): The Great Lakes were integral to the development of the Steel\nBelt, the United States\u2019 most important manufacturing region. Several major industrial cities originated as\nports on the \u201cNorth Coast,\u201d including Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Buffalo, and Duluth.\n\u2022 The Gulf Coast (the South Coast): As mentioned above, the ports of the American South were less active\nthan those of the rest of the country early on, but over time, particularly as trade with Latin America\nincreased, the ports of the Gulf Coast (or \u201cSouth Coast\u201d) became some of the most important cities in\nthe region. Such cities included Houston (via Galveston Bay), Mobile, Tampa, and New Orleans (which\noverlapped with the Mississippi Valley).\n\u2022 The Pacific Coast (the West Coast): Most of the major cities of California, Washington, and Oregon\nbegan as ports on the Pacific Ocean, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, San Diego, Sacramento\n(via the Sacramento River), and Portland (via the Columbia River).\nAn early ambition of the United States was to link\ntogether the four \u201ccoasts\u201d (Atlantic Coast, Mississippi\nValley, Great Lakes, and Gulf Coast) in the eastern half\nof the country. Of course, the Atlantic is naturally\nconnected to the Gulf, and the Gulf is naturally\nconnected to the Mississippi River. The real trick was\nfinding a way to link, by water passage, the Great Lakes\nwith the rest of the country.\nFor Americans, the biggest geographic problem with\nthe Great Lakes is the way they empty into the Atlantic\nOcean. Even after Canada completed the Welland\nCanal, bypassing Niagara Falls, in 1829, it was hardly\nhelpful for the U.S., since Canada was still a colony of\nBritain, and the U.S. was not yet on particularly good\nterms with the British. And even if they had been, Lake\nTransportation and Urban Location. Cartography by Kelly\nOntario connects to the Atlantic via the St. Lawrence\nMcFadden.\nRiver, which enters the ocean hundreds of miles north\nof the United States\u2019 major East Coast cities. 148 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSo, the United States dug its own canal. Completed in 1825, the\nErie Canal cuts across Upstate New York, connecting Lake Erie at\nBuffalo to the Hudson River at Albany. The Hudson River then flows\nto New York City. This shipping route finally connected the\neconomy of the Atlantic Ocean to the economy of the Great Lakes,\nand is the primary reason why New York became the most\nimportant city on the East Coast.\nThe United States then sought to create a direct link between the\nGreat Lakes and the Mississippi Valley. It accomplished that in 1848\nwith the completion of the Illinois & Michigan Canal. The I&M\nconnected Lake Michigan at Chicago with the Illinois River at\nMorris. The Illinois River then flows south to the Mississippi River\nnear St. Louis. Just as the Erie Canal cemented New York\u2019s position\nLock of the Erie Canal in Lockport, NY.\nas the most important city on the East Coast, the I&M cemented\nPhoto by Mitch Barrie on Flickr.\nChicago\u2019s position as the most important city in the Midwest.\nThe second-most important form of transportation in shaping the geography of the United States was the\nrailroad. The first practical steam locomotive was invented in the 1830s, and became an important mode of\nshipping in the United States around the 1860s. Most of the major cities in the eastern half of the United States\nhad already been established by that point, and the railroads of the east largely reinforced the importance of\nestablished transportation routes and cities. Chicago, for example, became the most important rail hub in the\nMidwest, and soon rail traffic would dwarf that of the city\u2019s canal, but the reason that Chicago became the rail hub,\nrather than, say, Kenosha, Wisconsin, is because the canal had already established Chicago\u2019s importance. Similarly,\nas railroads decreased the importance of the Erie Canal, most of the rail traffic connecting the Steel Belt to the\nEast Coast still passed through cities that became important because of the canal \u2013 cities like Buffalo, Rochester,\nSyracuse, Utica, Schenectady, Albany, and, of course, New York City.\nThat said, a few eastern cities owe their importance to the railroad, and one major example is Atlanta. Since it\nwas difficult to build railroads across the Appalachians, many rail lines went around the mountains. Since Atlanta\nis located at the southern tip of the Appalachians, almost all major rail lines in the South passed through there,\nmaking Atlanta the most important southern city, as it remains today.\nIt was a different story in the American West. West of Kansas City and Omaha, the climate becomes quite dry,\nwhich means there are few rivers that carry enough water year-round to be of much use for shipping. So, a lot NORTH AMERICA: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 149\nof Western cities got their start because they were located along a major rail route. Dallas, Albuquerque, Denver,\nPhoenix, and Salt Lake City are all cities that became prominent once the railroad arrived.\nFinally, railroads reinforced the importance of three West Coast cities. The first railroads to reach the Pacific\nOcean terminated at San Francisco-Oakland, Los Angeles, and Seattle. It is not a coincidence that the first three\nPacific ports to be connected by rail to the eastern U.S. are today the three largest metropolitan areas on the West\nCoast.\nUnlike waterways and railroads, highways had little to do with creating large urban areas. For the most part, they\nsimply reinforced the existing geography of the United States. They did, however, reshape the internal geography\nof American cities. The reason why highways had such little impact on shaping the national map of the United\nStates is because they came along relatively late, well after the major urban areas were well-established. Prior to\nthe 1920s, outside of cities, highways were rare, poorly maintained, and usually unmarked.\nAlmost all passenger and freight transport was still done by\nwater and rail. To drive from Chicago to Los Angeles, or even from\nChicago to St. Louis, took a very long time, and was usually done\nonly by adventurous spirits. Like highways, airlines had little to do\nwith reorganizing the geography of the country, although they\ncertainly aided in the development of such tourism-rich cities as\nLas Vegas, Honolulu, and Miami.\nDDIIdd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe name Chicago is derived from \u201cChecagou,\u201d the French version of the Native\nAmerican word shikaakwa, a plant commonly known as a ramp or leek.

CHAPTER 33\nNorth America: Physical Geography I\nThe Canadian Shield\nPETER MESERVE\nMany \u2013 if not most \u2013 regions of continents have a physical basis and in\nNorth America, the Canadian Shield exemplifies this. The Shield is a three million square mile (eight million square\nkilometer) area of ancient geology, directly linked with Canada\u2019s landforms, climates, and cultures. Ringing Hudson\nBay, the Shield is the fundamental surface for nearly all of Labrador, Quebec, and Ontario, before extending\ninto parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest and Nunavut Territories. These same Precambrian era\n(beginning 4.5 billion years ago) rocks extend for hundreds of miles under the sedimentary strata of surrounding\nregions, such as the Great Plains and Central Lowlands.\n151 152 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe Shield\u2019s location \u2013 globally and within North America \u2013 not\nonly has affected its landforms, but also its climate and therefore\nits soils and vegetation. In turn, human activities can\u2019t be separated\nfrom the Shield\u2019s physical characteristics because resource\navailability and exploitation, transportation and accessibility,\nsettlement patterns and growth, and even cultures and lifestyles\nare so strongly affected by this environment.\nMost of the rocks exposed in the Shield are over 600 million years\nold; some are older than four billion years. Their formation during\nthe Precambrian period (sometimes referred to as the Cryptozoic\nor \u2018hidden life\u2019 eon) means that in the Shield there are virtually no\nfossil fuels (or fossils) but instead it holds an abundance of metal\ndeposits. Native copper (pure copper) was found and used long\nago by the indigenous peoples around Lake Superior (especially\nMichigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula) while more recent mines were critical\nto the development of both countries. Gold, silver, nickel, and iron\ndeposits have been major economic activities for two centuries; the\niron deposits in Minnesota\u2019s Mesabi Range supported the\nAmerican steel industry from the late 1800s through the\nth\n20 century, while Ontario\u2019s Sudbury mines did the same for\nThe Canadian Shield.\nCanada.\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nErosion over millions of years exposed Shield rocks by removing\nmountains of soil and rock. Not only did this expose the deeper\nolder rocks and allow easier access to mineral resources (including diamonds in recent decades), but also it helps\nexplain the hydrology of the region. First, the rocks of the Shield are mostly igneous (often granitic) and are\nrelatively impermeable. The surface works like a \u201cshield\u201d in blocking water from passing through the rock,\nsnowmelt and rain tend to either runoff downslope (rivers) or be trapped in lower areas as lakes. Second, glacial\nactivity, either through erosion or deposition, has created \u201cderanged\u201d (random) stream patterns and depressions\nfor thousands of lakes. Minnesota may be the \u201cLand of 10,000 Lakes\u201d \u2013 check the license plate \u2013 but Manitoba is\nthe land of 100,000 lakes! (Canada claims to have the greatest amount of lakes in the world; Finland disagrees.)\nThe role of lakes and rivers created by glaciers and\nthe Shield has changed over the centuries, but these\nwaterways have always been vital to the inhabitants.\nDuring France\u2019s early colonization of Canada, access to\nthe interior was either on foot or by canoe and the\nFrench voyageurs were famous for their travels to\nobtain pelts from the natives (now known in Canada as\nFirst Nations). Settlers, especially in Quebec, used the\n\u2018long lot\u2019 system where property included river-\nGeorgian Bay, Canadian Shield \u2013 Photo by Michael Beckman on\nfrontage for access and then extended onshore. In the\nFlickr.\nlast century a \u201ccottage culture\u201d developed where\nhaving a summer place on the water was part of the NORTH AMERICA: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 153\nCanadian dream, for the wealthy at first, but then for the middle class. Fishing in Canadian waters now attracts\nmillions of tourists each year and hydropower facilities provide over half of Canada\u2019s electricity.\nWinters in the Canadian Shield range from cold (averaging -48\u00b0F) around the Great Lakes to extremely cold\n(averaging -30\u00b0F) near the Arctic Ocean, but summers \u2013 though short \u2013 can be warm to hot. Despite the lakes and\nrivers, Shield climates are classified as \u2018continental\u2019 so that seasonal extremes are the rule. The extreme northern\nlatitudes are a factor. Winter days are extremely short (sometimes nonexistent) and the long summer days (up to\n24 hours) allow vegetation to exist at the Arctic, attracting insects and the migrating birds that feed upon them\n(e.g., Canada Geese and Tundra Swans.) The early fur trade in the Shield relied on the heavier pelts of those\nanimals that live through the brutally cold winters.\nTrue tundra occurs in a climate that is found only on the northern shores of the Shield and lacks the forests that\ndominate the rest. Since most of the air masses in the Shield lack moisture, there is surprisingly little precipitation\n(and also little evaporation) but the remaining Shield climates can support pines, firs, and some deciduous trees.\nIn Canada two climates \u2013 Taiga and Boreal Forest \u2013 dominate the Canadian Shield; taiga forests are shorter, less\ndense and to the north of boreal forests. The harsh weather of the Shield limits the variety of trees and has\nresulted in huge expanses of spruces and firs \u2013 the best trees for the pulp mills that cover Ontario and Quebec.\nMost Shield soils are relatively thin, relatively infertile, and relatively acidic. The glaciers of the last Ice Age\nremoved the existing soils and the development of new soils has been slowed by the climate. In short, agriculture\nis limited to the few places where rivers or lakes have deposited fertile silt, such as the Clay Belt south of Hudson\nBay (where the former Lake Ojibway once stood.) Farther north in the Shield much of the soil is frozen year-\nround (permafrost), which creates huge problems for construction during summer, melt. In the summer peat bogs\n(containing decayed vegetation) and swamps appear in the Shield and are a major concern for global warming; the\nincreased decomposition of peat from higher temperatures adds even more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.\nThe geology of the Canadian Shield, combined with the history of\nthe rise and fall of the Ice Age and with the northern latitudes of\nCanada, creates a large swath of Canada that has a plethora of\nmineral resources exploited for wealth, a network of waterways\nused for transportation and tourism, and a landscape better suited\nfor forests than for agriculture.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nDuring the Cold War following WWII, the US was concerned about a nuclear\nPhoto by Francis Mariani on Flickr.\nattack by the Soviets (Russians). Since the shortest air route for Soviet bombers to\nreach America was across the North Pole and Canada, to monitor this potential\nSoviet threat, a system of radar stations was placed across the Shield. This DEW Line (Distant Early Warning Line) has since been \u2018transitioned\u2019\nto the North Warning System, but the relative location of the Shield means it remains important to US defense strategies.\nHudson Bay wasn\u2019t a bay before the last Ice Age and eventually in the future it won\u2019t be a bay either. This is due to isostatic rebound, the\ngradual rise of land after the departure of glaciers or ice sheets. 154 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nLeckman, Michael. 2016.

CHAPTER 34\nNorth America: Political Geography I\nPolitical-Ideological Regions\nIn the 2016 presidential election, the votes in Claiborne County\nand Wayne County were not at all close. In Claiborne County, 87%\nof voters selected Hillary Clinton. In Wayne County, 84% of voters\nchose Donald Trump. This might not surprise many people, given\nthe apparent polarization of the American political map. What\nmight surprise them, however, is the location of those two\ncounties. The heavily Republican Wayne County is in Illinois. The\nheavily Democratic Claiborne County is in Mississippi.\nEach presidential election generates a new map. States won by\nthe Democratic candidate are shaded blue, and states won by the\nRepublican candidate are shaded red. For the past several\nelections, many of those states have always been solid blue, while\nothers remain solid red. These maps are useful, given the winner-\ntake-all nature of the electoral college, but they can create\nsomething of a political mirage. These maps might leave\nsomeone with the impression that nearly everyone in Texas,\nGeorgia, and Missouri is a Republican, while nearly everyone in\nCalifornia, New York, and Illinois is a Democrat. That is not the\nElections by Bartosz Kapka from Pixabay.\ncase. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received a significant share of the\nvote in Texas (43%), Georgia (46%), and Missouri (38%), while\nDonald Trump received a significant share of the vote in California (32%), New York (37%), and Illinois (39%). While\nnone of these states were terribly competitive, it is important to note that there are plenty of Democrats in red\nstates, and plenty of Republicans in blue states. It is rare for the losing presidential candidate in a state to receive\nless than a third of the vote.\n155 156 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThat said, there are certainly areas of the country\nthat tend to lean heavily toward one party or the other,\nwhile other parts of the country are extremely\ncompetitive. Here, we will look at nine essential facts\nabout America\u2019s political-ideological geography. We\nwill examine the places where Democrats or\nRepublicans do well in elections, as well as those\nplaces that are competitive. The first three facts will\ninclude brief examinations of the traditionalistic,\nmoralistic, and individualistic American political\nsubcultures, which were first defined by political\nscientist Daniel J. Elazar in 1966.\n2016 Presidential Election by County (Red-Blue-Purple View, where\n1. Republicans Do Well in the Traditionalistic South.\ndarker shades show higher percentages). Map by Ali Zifan.\nThe Southern political region roughly corresponds to\nthose states that were once part of the Confederacy: South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,\nTexas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The region also includes West Virginia, Kentucky,\nOklahoma, and southern Missouri, which were not part of the Confederacy, but which have traditionally shared\nthe South\u2019s political ideology. Florida was part of the Confederacy, but is its own unique political region, and will\nbe discussed below.\nThe South is the birthplace of the traditionalistic American political subculture, and is still dominated by it. This\nsubculture is built on three foundational beliefs. First, respect for traditional religious, family, and social values are\nprofoundly important, and politicians are expected to share those values. Second, government should be small\nand limited to basic operations; it should not be expansive or innovative. Third, taxation and spending should, as\na result, be limited.\nThe South was once solidly Democratic, but the political emphasis on small government, low taxes, and\ntraditional values much more closely aligns with the Republican Party today. For the last forty years, the South has\nbeen solidly red. As we\u2019ll see below, Virginia has drifted somewhat from these traditionalist values, as has North\nCarolina. There are even signs that Texas and Georgia are shifting from the traditionalist subculture, and could NORTH AMERICA: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 157\nturn blue in the next decade or so. The rest of the South, however, shows few signs of abandoning their loyalty to\nthe Republican Party anytime soon.\n2. Democrats Do Well in Moralistic New England and the West Coast.\nNew England was the birthplace of the moralistic political subculture. This subculture is the polar opposite of the\ntraditionalistic subculture. It believes that government can and should be a positive agent promoting the collective\nwell-being, and that politicians should be driven by progressive issues. Government should not be limited, but\nlarge and innovative, and taxation and spending should be utilized to promote the public good.\nThese ideals closely align with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. New England was, for many years, a\nRepublican stronghold. The abolitionist movement was born in New England, and drove the early evolution of\nthe Republican Party. Over time, however, as Republicans grew more conservative, the region began to drift away\nfrom the party, and is now mostly Democratic. Two standard-bearers of the moralistic subculture, Senators Bernie\nSanders and Elizabeth Warren, are from Vermont and Massachusetts, respectively. In 2016, Donald Trump did not\nwin a single county in either of those states.\nThe moralistic subculture is also strong on the West Coast, particularly in liberal bastions like San Francisco,\nPortland, and Seattle. This region was the political hearth of a number of progressive ideals, including the gay\nrights and environmentalist movements. Democrats usually dominate statewide races in California, Oregon, and\nWashington.\n3. Much of the Individualistic Midwest is Competitive.\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri all have a tendency to lean Republican in\npresidential elections, but each of those states has elected a Democratic governor or U.S. senator at some point\nin the last two decades. Minnesota and Illinois tend to lean Democratic in presidential elections, but both states\nhave elected Republican senators and governors over the last two decades. 158 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe rest of the Midwest \u2013 Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio \u2013 along with neighboring Pennsylvania,\nare some of the most competitive states in presidential elections. They are classic swing states. They are\ndominated by the individualistic political subculture, which originated among German and English settlers in\nthe Mid-Atlantic states. They carried their ideals across the Appalachians to the Midwest, where the subculture\nis strongest today. The individualistic subculture falls between the moralistic and traditionalistic subcultures,\nboth geographically and ideologically. Unlike traditionalistic Southerners, Midwesterners are not obsessed with\nmaking government as small possible. They typically favor good schools, a solid infrastructure, safe streets, and\na strong military, and they are willing to pay taxes to maintain them. That said, Midwesterners often find that the\nmoralistic subculture of New England and the West Coast takes things too far. Individualistic voters don\u2019t believe\nthat government is a bad thing, but also don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s government\u2019s job to solve all of the world\u2019s problems.\nEssentially, individualistic voters view government as a business. It should be practical and utilitarian. Taxes are\nan investment, and voters expect a return on that investment. Government spending should emphasize economic\ngrowth. Voters in this subculture are generally unconcerned with a candidate\u2019s personal life \u2013 they\u2019re not expecting\npoliticians to be saints or crusaders, they simply want pragmatism. Extremely liberal or extremely conservative\nideologues have a tough time in the Midwest\u2019s swing states. Voters there have demonstrated that they are willing\nto swing from one party to the other, provided the candidate is moderate and practical.\n4. Hybrid Florida is Very Competitive.\nFlorida is an unusual mixture of voters. The northern part of the state is an extension of the South\u2019s traditionalistic\nregion, which heavily favors Republicans. Florida is a popular destination for retirees, most of whom are older,\nwhite, and middle or upper-class, which also favors Republicans. However, Florida is also home to numerous large\ncities and a significant immigrant population, which strongly favors Democrats. Additionally, much of the state\nhas been settled by migrants from the individualistic Midwest and Mid-Atlantic, who might favor moderates of\neither party. As a result, margins between Republicans and Democrats tend to be razor thin in Florida. That fact,\ncoupled with the state\u2019s large allotment of electoral votes, makes it one of the most hotly contested states in each\npresidential election.\n5. Republicans Do Better with White Voters; Democrats Do Better with Voters of Color.\nAccording to exit polls in 2016, Donald Trump won 58% of the white vote, compared to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 37%, a NORTH AMERICA: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 159\nhuge margin. Clinton, however, did far better among the three primary non-white populations, trouncing Trump\namong Black voters (88% to 8%), Latinx voters (66% to 28%), and Asian voters (79% to 17%).\nThese numbers do not bode well for Republicans. The percentage of non-white voters in the United States is\nsteadily increasing, and it stands to shift the political map significantly if party loyalties remain the same. Nowhere\nis this more apparent than the Interior West. The region has traditionally been a Republican stronghold, and some\nof Trump\u2019s biggest margins of victory came in states like Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, and Utah \u2013 he won each of\nthose states by more than ten percentage points. They are also predominantly white. 78% of Utah\u2019s population is\nwhite, and in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, that number tops 80%. Hillary Clinton, however, won states where\nthe white population was smaller, including Colorado (68% white), Nevada (48% white), and New Mexico (37%\nwhite). Trump won by just four points in Arizona, which is 54% white. Arizona, usually solid red, might turn blue in\n2020.\n6. College-Educated Voters are Trending Democratic.\nFor years, the Republican Party\u2019s policies have favored business owners and managers, while the Democrats were\nlargely the party of the working class. As a result, Republicans have traditionally fared better among voters with\na college degree. That pattern has been reversing for several years, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton defeated Donald\nTrump among college-educated voters, 52% to 43%. This trend explains North Carolina\u2019s shift from a solid-red\nstate to a swing state. As cities like Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham have morphed into major centers of finance and\nresearch, North Carolina has experienced a significant increase in the number of voters who are college graduates.\nThis trend was also reflected in 2016\u2019s national electoral map. The ten states with the highest percentage\nof college graduates are Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, Vermont, New\nHampshire, New York, and Minnesota. All ten of those states were won by Hillary Clinton. The ten states with\nthe lowest percentage of college graduates are Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Alabama,\nOklahoma, Indiana, Tennessee, and Wyoming. All but one of those states were won by Donald Trump.\n7. Democrats Do Well in Cities\nCities are big, complex places, often requiring big, complex government programs. Compared to rural areas and\nsmall towns, cities also tend to be younger, more ethnically diverse, and better educated. Urban populations tend\nto be progressive on social and cultural issues, like race, gender, and sexuality. City dwellers are also likely to\nrecognize the societal codependence required of living in a densely populated area. All of these traits strongly\nfavor Democrats. This is why Democrats usually do well in places like the Northeast, the West Coast, and the Steel\nBelt, all home to large urban agglomerations.\nState by state, large and mid-sized urban areas tend to be blue. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won in just twelve of\nIllinois\u2019 102 counties, but they were all densely populated counties, allowing her to carry the state comfortably: Six\nof them were in the Chicago metro area, one was in the St. Louis metro area, and the remaining five contained\nthe mid-sized cities of Champaign-Urbana, Carbondale, Peoria, Moline, and Rockford. Cities lean Democratic even\nin deep-red states. In Utah, which was easily won by Donald Trump, Clinton still won in Salt Lake County, home of\nthe state\u2019s largest city.\n8. Republicans Do Well in Rural Areas\nDemocrats do well in some rural areas. Claiborne County, Mississippi, mentioned at the top of this chapter, is a\nvery rural area of only about 9,600 people. In 2016, Hillary Clinton received 87% of the votes in Claiborne County, 160 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nwhich is, not coincidentally, 84% African-American. Similarly, Zapata County, Texas, home to just 14,000 people,\ndelivered 66% of the vote to Hillary Clinton. Zapata County is 85% Latinx.\nMost rural counties in the United States, however, are predominantly white, and lean heavily Republican. Wayne\nCounty, Illinois, where Donald Trump received 84% of the vote, is 98% white. As mentioned above, Wayne is one\nof the ninety Illinois counties, mainly rural and white, won by Trump. In deep-blue California, Donald Trump failed\nto receive even a third of the statewide vote, but cruised with 72% of the vote in Lassen County, which is located\nin the remote, rural northeastern corner of the state.\nIn addition to being whiter than the national average, rural areas also tend to be older and have a lower\npercentage of college graduates. They also tend to adhere to traditional views of cultural, religious, and social\nissues, all of which favor Republicans. Unlike big and complex cities that highlight societal codependence, life in\nrural areas often features a good deal of personal independence. State and federal governments are often seen\nas a distant nuisance, at best. Many rural voters prefer that problems be solved by families, churches, or local\ngovernment. This also very much favors Republicans.\n9. The Suburbs are Increasingly Competitive\nLike North Carolina, Virginia used to be a solidly conservative, but it has drifted toward the political center in recent\nyears. It now leans Democratic in presidential elections, and a major part of that shift has come from northern\nVirginia, in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.\nThe suburbs have traditionally been white and middle or upper-class. As a result, they have also traditionally\nbeen predominantly Republican. That is changing. Suburban Republicans often do not share some of the deeply\nconservative values of rural Republicans. On cultural, environmental, and social issues, as well as on the issue\nof immigration, suburban voters tend to be relatively moderate. The suburbs are also becoming more ethnically\ndiverse. Most importantly, suburbs tend to have very high concentrations of college-educated voters. All of these\ntrends favor Democrats. While suburban voters are unlikely to flock to extremely liberal candidates anytime soon,\nthey are increasingly turned off by extremely conservative candidates as well. Donald Trump, in particular, has\nbecome deeply unpopular in the suburbs, particularly among college-educated women. In 2016, Donald Trump\nwon the suburban vote, 49% to 45%. Polls in mid-2020 have him losing 60% to 35%, a massive collapse. Suburban\ncounties will be among the most closely watched in the 2020 election. NORTH AMERICA: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 161\nDid You Know?\nth\nMissouri, now a reliably red state, was once the ultimate swing state. In the 20 Century, Missouri voted for the winner in all but one presidential\nelection. In 1956, Missouri was won by Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, who lost the general election to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. CHAPTER 35\nNorth America:\nPopulation Geography I\nThe Immigration Debate\nWhen Donald Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2015, he shocked\nmany Americans, and delighted many others, with a stridently anti-immigrant message:\n\u201cWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\u2019re laughing at us, at our stupidity\u2026. The U.S. has become a\ndumping ground for everybody else\u2019s problems\u2026. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best\u2026.\nThey\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing\ndrugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s message catered to those who feared that immigration rates were at a dangerous and unprecedented\nlevel, and upset those who believed his message was unprecedented in its divisiveness. Of course, any student of\nAmerican history knows that current rates of immigration to the United States are not unprecedented, and that\nugly and divisive debates about immigration are also nothing new.\nImmigration to the United States has ebbed and flowed over the years, largely due to changes in American\nimmigration policies, as well as to fluctuations in both the American and the global economy. As a result, the\npercentage of foreign-born residents of the United States has risen and fallen over the years. It peaked in 1890,\nwhen 14.8% of Americans had been born in a foreign country. It fell to its lowest level in 1970, when just 4.7% of\nAmericans were foreign-born. Throughout much of American history, that number has usually hovered around\n162 NORTH AMERICA: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY I 163\n11%. As of the 2010 census, 12.9% of Americans were born in a foreign country, just a little above the historic\naverage.\nImmigration is nothing new, nor is resistance to it. Every March, millions of Americans deck themselves out in\ngreen, and flock to parades, festivals, and parties to celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day. They are celebrating Irish culture,\nand the contributions of Irish immigrants to American culture. The Irish were not always so celebrated in America.\nThis cartoon, entitled \u201cThe Usual Irish Way of Doing Things,\u201d was published in 1871, and drawn by Thomas Nast.\nIt depicts an Irishman as an unruly, apelike creature, waving a liquor bottle as he sets off a powder keg. Nast\nwas infamous for his anti-Catholic, anti-Irish sentiments, but he was not, in his time, regarded as a dangerous\nradical. Nast was one of the most popular political cartoonists of his day, and his anti-Irish attitude was shared\nby millions of Americans. Irish-Americans were not the first group to face an anti-immigrant backlash, and they\ncertainly wouldn\u2019t be the last. Immigrants from Poland, Italy, Japan, China, Mexico, and dozens of other countries\nhave faced similar discrimination.\nHere, we will examine anti-immigration and pro-immigration arguments. It is a nuanced debate. Some are\nhardliners in their anti-immigrant sentiments, believing that immigration should be greatly reduced, or even\neliminated entirely, and that all undocumented immigrants should be deported. Others agree that immigration\nis necessary and inevitable, but that immigration rates should be reduced and immigration rules more strictly\nenforced. On the other end of the spectrum, many argue that immigration is beneficial to the United States, and\nthat current immigration rates should be at least maintained, and perhaps even increased. Many believe that\nundocumented immigrants should be given a clear pathway to citizenship.\nTHE ANTI-IMMIGRATION ARGUMENT 164 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nWe\u2019ll begin with two very common anti-immigration arguments\nthat don\u2019t hold up under scrutiny. Many anti-immigration advocates argue that immigration leads to increased\ncrime rates (as evidenced in the excerpt from the Trump speech above), and that immigrants are a drain on public\nfunds, utilizing many public services, but paying few taxes.\nOf course, it would be ridiculous to argue that immigrants commit no crimes. That said, the evidence suggests\nthat not only does immigration not lead to an increase in crime, but that immigrants are, in fact, less likely\nto commit crimes than those born in the United States. As for the public funding debate, a sudden influx of\nimmigrants into a place can indeed put a strain on public resources. This is particularly true in public education.\nStill, in the larger picture, immigrants are hardly a drain on the tax base. They most certainly pay taxes. Everyone\nis obligated to pay sales taxes \u2013 there is no way around that \u2013 and immigrants pay property taxes, either directly\nthrough property they own, or indirectly through property they rent. Documented immigrants must pay federal\nand state income taxes, just like everyone else. The widely held belief that undocumented immigrants do not pay\nincome taxes is untrue. Hoping to avoid a crime that may lead to their deportation, and to create a paper trail\nthat may aid in their eventual citizenship, most undocumented immigrants do file a tax return. In 2015, it was\nestimated that undocumented immigrants paid $13.6 billion in federal income taxes.\nA far more sound argument against immigration can be found in the labor market. Increased immigration\ninevitably leads to increased job competition and wage deflation. It is often argued that immigrants take jobs that\nnative citizens are unable or unwilling to take, and there is certainly some merit to that argument. Still, there is no\ndenying that increased immigration means that many native citizens will eventually find themselves competing for\na job with an immigrant. Since many immigrants come from countries that are poorer than the United States, they\nare often willing to work for much lower wages than native citizens, and are thus more attractive to employers.\nAdditionally, increased immigration will drive wages down because of fundamental economic laws. If the supply\nof anything increases, its value decreases. This is why gold is more expensive than cardboard \u2013 one is rare,\nthe other is not. As immigration increases the supply of labor, it becomes cheaper, and its value declines. Put\nsimply, more immigration means more labor, which means lower wages. This has long been true in the blue-collar\nworkforce, and is becoming increasingly true in white-collar fields as well.\nFinally, cultural forces play a very important, although often unspoken, role in the anti-immigration movement.\nGeographers often use two terms when examining the cultural forces involved in immigration: acculturation and\nassimilation. Acculturation is a process in which immigrants shed some of their ethnic traits, while absorbing\nsome traits of the mainstream culture. Assimilation is complete acculturation, where immigrants shed all of their\nethnic traits, and fully adopt the traits of the mainstream.\nIn America, acculturation is inevitable. The children and grandchildren of immigrants will shed some of their\nethnic traits, and replace them with the traits of classmates, coworkers, friends, and neighbors who are not part NORTH AMERICA: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY I 165\nof their ethnic group (often to the dismay of their parents and grandparents). Total assimilation by ethnic groups,\nhowever, is rare. And if it does happen, it often takes many generations. As a result, a place that receives lots\nof immigrants will inevitably look different. The civic, religious, economic, and political institutions of the place\nwill change. The faces, the food, the music, and dozens of other cultural traits will never be the same. For many\nAmericans, this is a source of tremendous dismay. They see their towns and neighborhoods become less and less\nrecognizable. That is why older Americans are more likely to be anti-immigrant than younger Americans. They\nhave longer memories and often a greater sense of cultural change and loss.\nTHE PRO-IMMIGRATION ARGUMENT\nCulture also plays a role in the pro-immigration argument. Advocates of immigration argue that the United\nStates is a multicultural mosaic created by immigration, and that further immigration only serves to enrich\nthat mosaic. They might also argue that the anti-immigrant movement is hypocritical, since the vast majority of\nAmericans are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. But perhaps the strongest pro-immigration\narguments are based on profound economic and demographic realities of modern America.\nFirst, there is the labor market. As mentioned above, immigration makes labor cheaper, and while that is not\npopular with workers, it is quite popular with employers. Some blue-collar industries, notably agriculture and\nfood processing, would simply not be profitable in their current forms without access to cheap immigrant labor.\nAnd, as mentioned above, immigrants are increasingly filling white-collar jobs as well. It is difficult, if not almost\nimpossible, to go to an American hospital, university, research lab, or engineering firm, and not find an immigrant\nworking as a doctor, nurse, technician, professor, scientist, or engineer. Among the immigrants who have arrived\nin the United States since 2010, 50% have held college degrees. That is significantly higher than the native-born\npopulation of the United States, among whom only 30% have college degrees. This process is known as a brain\ngain, in which wealthy countries successfully draw the best and brightest from the world\u2019s poorer countries.\nImmigrants are important to the current U.S. economy, and they will only grow more vital over time. The current\ntotal fertility rate in the United States is 1.87, meaning that the average American woman has just under two\nchildren. That is below the replacement rate of 2.1. Without immigration, the population of the United States\nwill eventually begin to decline. Low birth rates are also leading to a rapidly aging population. It is extremely\ndifficult for a country to maintain economic growth without population growth, and an aging population leads to a\ndiminished tax base, as well as decreased rates of production and consumption. Immigration provides a new pool\nof young workers, consumers, and taxpayers to offset declining birth rates. 166 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nYears from now, people may find our current immigration debate profoundly ironic. Today, many people are\narguing about how to keep immigrants out of the country. In the not-too-distant future, the United States may very\nwell be trying to figure out how to get more immigrants into the country.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThomas Nast is widely regarded as the founding figure of American political cartooning. He invented or popularized national icon Uncle\nSam, the donkey and elephant mascots of the Democratic and Republican parties, as well as the modern face of Christmas \u2013 Santa Claus. His\nreputation has been tarnished by his anti-immigrant views. Ironically, Nast was himself an immigrant, having migrated with his family from\nGermany to New York at the age of six.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nNast, Thomas. 1871. The Usual Irish Way of Doing Things.

PEARSON\nIn 1974 the French author Georges Perec sat in the place Saint-Sulpice in Paris for three days and recorded\neverything he saw. His quirky essay \u201cAn Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris\u201d reads like a laundry list of\nmundane observations. But as one progresses through the text a kind of rhythm is slowly revealed. Through\nhis observations of the mundane, Perec brings to life the spirit of a place, its rhythms, pulsations, and attributes\nthat makes real places and spaces memorable. Perec himself said that his attempt was to describe \u201cthat which\n1\nis generally not taken note of, that which is not noticed.\u201d By observing the often overlooked aspects of everyday\nlife, a deeper understanding of a place emerges.\nWhat Perec was doing was making a kind of map. Not necessarily a literal map like we might think of, but\nrather a deep observation and record of a place. Architects are interested in the ways in which they can come to\ntruly understand places and spaces in the built environment. Mapping, the act of recording and observing, is one\nmethod we can employ to understand and see places more clearly.\nArchitecture students are encouraged to use mapping as an analysis tool before beginning any design work.\nThe idea is to look deeply at a place, observe, record, and analyze. This is an essential first step in the design\nprocess that occurs before any concept sketch or design gesture has been considered. The idea is that a deeper\nunderstanding of place and space will lead to more authentic and sensitive design responses to a given place.\n167 168 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nStudents in the Architecture 2201 Design I class use mapping exercises as a part of site analysis research before design begins. Photos\nby Mark A. Pearson.\nTaking Chicago as a model, mapping can reveal and help us see and understand a place. It can also raise\nimportant questions for a designer to consider.\nArchitects often use types of maps known as figure grounds. Figure ground maps are graphically beautiful.\nSimplifying an urban environment into buildings (figure) and space (ground) can reveal patterns of development,\nscale and density. Overlay this same type of map with highlights of public parks and open space can reveal another\ntype of pattern. These mapping activities also raise questions. Where are the public spaces in a city? Who has\naccess to them? NORTH AMERICA: URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 169\nFigure ground maps created using open source data from the Chicago Data Portal. 170 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nTraffic maps can reveal the movement and flow of people and products (and also tell you where not to drive),\nbut have you ever looked at illustrative maps of fitness tracker activities? These beautiful maps reveal an\nentirely different pattern of use, leisure, and fitness within an urban environment. For an example, go to\n2\nhttps:\/\/flowingdata.com\/2014\/02\/05\/where-people-run\/#jp-carousel-33724 By slightly shifting the way we look\nat a city, we can begin to see anew. The maps equally force us to ask questions about who has access and\nproximity to public parks, trails, and open space.\nMapping can also help us understand deeper social justice issues and reveal uncomfortable histories. In June\n2020, WBEZ Chicago public radio published an essay on where banks have invested money through lending\n3\n(mortgages) in the city, and where they have not. The centerpiece of this article is a striking data visualization\nmap which overlays the inequities of lending practices over neighborhood racial data. With striking clarity, it\nreveals the disparities that exist. Shockingly, these are not redlining maps from the 1930s and 1940s, rather, these\nmaps reveal contemporary data collected from 2012 to 2018 which illustrate the lack of investment in poor and\nminority neighborhoods. Mapping, in this sense, is an activity that reveals. It forces us to encounter difficult truths\nabout structural inequities within the urban environment.\nThe City of Chicago has an open source data portal tool that you can use to view and create your own mapping\n4\nanalysis projects. In the Chicago Data Portal you can find maps illustrating datasets on everything you can NORTH AMERICA: URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 171\nimagine from crime to fire station locations, bike racks, abandoned vehicles, green roofs, grocery stores, urban\nfarms, libraries, parks, red-light cameras, pothole repairs, and so on. You can use the data set tools to create your\nown mapping combinations and analysis. For example, draw a map that compares farmers\u2019 market locations\nto affordable rental housing, thus linking two things that are fundamental to human life, the needs for shelter\nand food. Unsurprisingly, there is a visible disconnect between affordable housing locations and access to fresh\nproduce in the City of Chicago, such that areas with lower cost housing often are food deserts that lack fresh fruits\nand vegetables. Mapping in this way can help us understand the concept of food deserts by revealing spatial\ninequities. Mapping can help us ask the right questions. Who has access to fresh produce? Who does not? Why?\nSo what does this have to do with Architecture and Design? Well here are a few examples.\nIn 2012 Chicago Architect Katherine Darnstadt, in partnership with Architecture for Humanity Chicago,\n5\ntransformed a decommissioned CTA bus into a mobile produce market. Called \u201cFresh Moves,\u201d this project\ntransformed a city bus into a mobile farmers\u2019 market on wheels. It was designed to both raise awareness to the\nissues of food deserts within the City of Chicago, as well as to provide access to fresh produce for communities\nthat lack that access to fresh nutritious food.\nBen Kolak, Courtesy Borderless Studio. This map of Chicago is painted in the parking lot of the former Anthony Overton Elementary\nSchool, highlighting 45 CPS school closures by neighborhood.\nChicago based designer and educator Paola Aguirre Serrano, founder of the firm Borderless Studio provides\nanother example. In her project titled \u201ccreative grounds\u201d, Aguirre Serrano addresses the issue of repurposing\n6\nclosed Chicago Public Schools. Part design project, part installation art, this project features a larger than life map 172 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nof Chicago that was painted in the parking lot of the former Anthony Overton Elementary School, highlighting the\nneighborhood locations of over 45 CPS schools that have closed since 2013 due to budget cuts. This larger scale\ninteractive map (you can walk on it) is a tool used to reveal. It is also used by the design team as a tool to spark\ndialogue about the topic of school closures and to solicit inclusive responses regarding the future repurposing\n7\nof these structures. In this project, a map becomes the catalyst and a key element of a project that attempts\nto instigate inclusivity and collaboration around the difficult and politically charged topic of school closures. This\nmap, and the resulting dialogue sessions, had the added benefit of creating a network of community partners.\nAnthony Overton school is located in the heart of the Bronzeville neighborhood in Chicago. In 2020 when\nthe combination of pandemic and protest shut down many community grocery stores, this community partner\nnetwork was leveraged to set up a rapid response food distribution center in the former school to assist neighbors\nwho had no access to food in close proximity. Architecture firms like Borderless studio believe that design\nprofessionals should be discussing issues of design justice and asking questions like \u201cWho benefits from design?\n8\nWho gets the burden?\u201d\nMaps are not just static illustrations. They are reflections of those who create them, and at best can be used\nas active tools to see and understand. The act of mapping can reveal, raise questions, illustrate, provide analysis,\nand ultimately help us to see, like George Perec, that which might otherwise remain unseen. For designers (and\nfuture design professionals), this ability to see and understand the spirit of a place is an essential component to\nthe creation of meaningful, authentic design solutions, especially those solutions that attempt to make the built\nenvironment we all share a better place for everyone.\nDDIIdd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe city of Chicago is organized like a giant piece of graph paper, with the zero-zero point located at the intersection of State and Madison\nStreets. State and Madison streets are also the dividing line between North and South and East and West Street addresses. This giant Cartesian\ngrid helps make the city logical and navigable. A typical Chicago city block is 660 feet. Every 800 street addresses (8 city blocks) equals a mile.\nGoing North, Chicago Avenue (800 N) is one mile north, North Avenue (1600N) is two miles north, and Fullerton Ave (2400N) is three miles north\nof the city center. The same pattern works going west, with Halsted, Ashland, and Western Avenue each located at one mile intervals. There\nare some anomalies to this grid system, but for the most part Chicago, like the entire Midwest, is organized on a mathematical grid system\nbased on one mile squares.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\nGeorges Perec, and Marc Lowenthal. 2010.

CHAPTER 37\nNorth America: Medical Geography I\nCOVID-19\nDERRICK WILLIS\nThe circumstances of COVID-19 are anthropologically and geographically striking now in early June 2020.\nSpread of the disease has not produced a randomized pattern, but instead has affected Americans differently\nbased on location and on social, racial, and ethnic patterns.\nThroughout the country, governors issued stay at home restrictions and other strategies of mitigation, including\npublic health responses that involve testing and contact tracing, quarantining, and treating the infected.\nSignificantly, there has not been a national testing and contact tracing strategy for addressing COVID-19, even\nthough over 100,000 Americans have died from this pandemic. It is shocking to know that we have had more\nAmericans die in a little over two months than we lost in Viet Nam (58,000) and the Korean War (36,000) combined.\nColumbia University issued a report that if the US had closed one week earlier and began mitigation, then 36,000\nAmerican lives could have been saved. Over 40 million jobs were lost in the US by May 28, 2020.\nDue to the ease of infection in places of high population density, early hot spots were Los Angeles, San Francisco,\nand Seattle on the west coast and New York City, New Jersey, and Boston on the east coast. New Orleans became\na hot spot after the Mardi Gras festival. Detroit and Chicago were hot spots in the Midwest. Approximately half\nthe country still has uncontrolled cases of COVID-19 but all the states have entered some phase of reopening the\nstate and economy.\n174 NORTH AMERICA: MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY I 175\nThe strength in the US response has been its governors and local leaders across most of the nation. New\nYork (Governor Chris Cuomo), California (Gavin Newsom), Washington (Jay Inslee), Michigan (Gretchen Whitmer),\nand Illinois (J. B. Pritzker) are but a few examples of governors and local leaders who let science be the primary\nreference when addressing their constituents.\nOther states have taken less scientific approaches. Officials in Georgia manipulated statistics to fraudulently\nreport improvement in COVD-19 cases over time. Federal leadership also chose to avoid science when it\ncontradicted their personal hopes for better news. President Trump fired the Health and Human Services\nInspector General Christi Grimm after she issued a report observing the shortage of protective personal\nequipment (PPE) to properly respond to this pandemic. Scientist Dr. Nancy Messonnier of CDC was demoted\nafter alerting the public that the upcoming pandemic would disrupt our lives. Whistle-blower scientist Dr. Rick\nBright who headed BARDA, the division in CDC responsible for developing vaccines, was demoted after he would\nnot recommend hydroxychloroquine, as otherwise touted by President Trump for treating COVID-19. Silencing\nand ignoring the advice of Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, and the CDC left the public with misleading and\nincomplete information.\nThe impact of the virus socially, demographically, and economically has varied. African Americans, Latinx, and\nNative Americans have been the hardest impacted communities. They are more likely to live in urban centers or\nwhere there is considerable dense population, thus in settings where this virus more easily spreads. They are at\nincreased risk for being underinsured and malnourished than white Americans are. This impact is tied to the socio-\neconomic inequalities that exist within these communities. Health disparities among these minority populations,\nsuch as greater rates of pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and obesity, put\nthese populations at increased risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19. Individuals who are 65 and\nolder are among the groups with the highest rates of mortality from the virus. 176 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nEconomically we find that African Americans, Latinx, and Native\nAmericans are more likely to be defined as essential workers who\nare not allowed to work remotely from their homes, but need to\nwork on site. These workers are disproportionately people of color\nand immigrants. Smithfield Foods in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is\none such meat factory that had a noteworthy outbreak of\nCOVID-19. Concerned about maintaining the supply of meat across\nAmerica, on April 29, 2020, President Trump issued an executive\norder citing the Defense Act of 1950 to keep meat processing plants\nopen to delay possible shortages of beef, pork, chicken and other\nmeats. Oddly, President Trump did not use this act to increase\nproduction of personal protective equipment (PPE) for essential COVID-19 sign in Arlington County, Virginia. Photo\nworkers. by dmbosstone on Flickr.\nWorking on the\ndisassembly-line these workers are in close quarters, practically shoulder to shoulder from each other preventing\nthem from socially distancing. Needed masks would be hard to wear for long periods given the strenuous fast-\npaced nature of their work. Consequently, meat processing plants have been among the main vectors for\ntransmitting the COVID-19 virus.\nThe close proximity in which individuals live and work can easily prompt the spread of COVID-19. A number\nof nursing homes across the country have reported numerous deaths, while prisons, such as in Marion, Ohio,\nand in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, face challenges to halt the virus. For a look at which jobs place workers at greater\nrisks, examine the excellent diagram at https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/\ncovid-19-occupational-risk-scores.html\nFederal, state, and local governments continue to search for ways to balance the health and economic\nchallenges. For instance, many hotels that are no longer booking rooms could serve as places to isolate\/\nquarantine individuals who test positive or who have had contact with someone who is positive when they live in\nwith others. Hotel rooms could serve as places for first responders to live temporarily, otherwise worried about\nbringing the virus home to their families. The government could pay a per diem for these services, thus generating\nincome for the hospitality industry that has been so gravely impacted by the shutdown of the national economy.\nInternational comparisons are interesting and perhaps a topic for an additional essay. Countries that are\neffectively controlling the COVID-19 threat have done so be demonstrating strong political leadership that stresses NORTH AMERICA: MEDICAL GEOGRAPHY I 177\nscience in response to this pandemic. Examples include New Zealand \u2013 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern \u2013\npopulation of 4.8 million, Germany \u2013 Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2013 83.0 million, South Korea \u2013 President Moon Jae-in\n\u2013 51.6 million, and Taiwan \u2013 Tsai Ing-wen \u2013 23.7 million.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nOther countries, including the United States, have done poorly in containing the virus.

Once the dominant force in\nAmerican religious life, their position has eroded steadily over the last fifty years. Not all of them are experiencing\na decline in absolute numbers, but none are growing faster than the overall American population. There are\nfour major reasons for this. First, every decade sees a slight uptick in America\u2019s non-religious population, and\nmany of these Americans come from families that have been members of the Mainline denominations. Second,\nthe number of Americans attending non-denominational churches has soared in recent decades, and many of\nthose attendees have \u201cemigrated\u201d from the Mainline churches. Third, many Mainline Protestants are from white,\nmiddle-class America, a group that has relatively low birth rates, so each generation of Mainline Protestants is the\nsame size, and sometimes smaller, than the generation before it. Finally, much of America\u2019s population growth in\nrecent decades has come from immigration, and very few immigrants are Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, or\nEpiscopalian.\nIn recent decades, the number of non-denominational Protestants has grown rapidly, as has the number of\nnon-religious Americans. Other fast-growing religious groups in America include Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus,\nlargely because of increased immigration from Asia.\n179 180 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBoth Jews and Roman Catholics have seen their share of the American population hold relatively steady. Jews in\nAmerica are demographically similar to Mainline Protestants \u2013 with low birth rates, low rates of immigration, and\na decrease in religious participation among younger people. That said, because the surveys that supply us with\nthese percentages are based on identity, not activity, a good number of non-practicing Jews still identify as Jewish,\nbecause it is an ethnic identity as well as a religious one.\nMany Americans would be surprised to find that the number of Catholics in the United States is holding\nsteady, but they would be surprised for different reasons, depending on what part of the country they\u2019re from.\nIn some areas, the number of Catholics is declining. This is due, in part, to the slow but steady decline in the\nnumber of Americans who identify as religious. This trend has been exacerbated in the Catholic Church by long-\nstanding and sometimes bitter debates over the Church\u2019s policies on abortion, birth control, female clergy, and\ngay parishioners. The abuse scandals that rocked the Church over the last two decades certainly haven\u2019t helped.\nA counterbalance to this trend has been immigration. The single largest source of immigrants to the United\nStates for the last half-century has been Latin America, an overwhelmingly Catholic region. Put simply, in regions\nof the country that have seen significant immigration from Latin America (or from other Catholic countries,\nlike Poland or the Philippines), the Catholic Church has been growing. In places that have not received such\nimmigrants, the number of Catholics is declining. Interestingly, these two dynamics have balanced out nationally,\nand the percentage of Americans who are Catholic has stayed about the same.\nSPATIAL DYNAMICS OF AMERICAN RELIGION\nAs we saw on the earlier chapter addressing part 1 of this topic, the webpage https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/\nblogs\/govbeat\/wp\/2013\/12\/12\/religion-in-americas-states-and-counties-in-6-maps\/ shows the largest religious\ngroup in each American county as of 2010. It is a little misleading, as many maps of this type are. It suggests the\noverwhelming dominance of a particular group across wide swaths of the map. In reality, most of the country is\nreligiously diverse. There are Baptists in Boston, and Catholics in Mississippi. You\u2019ll find Muslim mosques in the\nMissouri Ozarks, and Hindu temples in Salt Lake City. In large metropolitan areas like Chicago, you can find just\nabout every religious denomination you could imagine.\nWith that map open, examine the colors and patterns of the highlighted religious denominations. Certain\ngroups are pretty strongly represented in certain areas. One of the most striking is the prevalence of Baptists in\nthe U.S. South (red on the map). Another that is not quite as obvious, but still noticeable, is the preponderance of\nMethodists across the lower Midwest (green). One reason for the distribution of these two groups was the nature\nof religion on the American frontier. Two of the largest religious groups in colonial America were Anglicans (later\nto be Episcopalians) and Catholics. Both of these churches have strict rules about who can be a priest, and how\na parish is established. As Americans moved west of the Appalachians, these churches were ill-equipped for a\nfast-moving, inaccessible, and disorganized frontier. The Methodists and Baptists had, at least then, far less strict\nrules about who could establish a church and preach there. As such, these denominations were better equipped\nto move with the frontier, and quickly became the dominant groups in the South and lower Midwest.\nTwo years later the Washington Post expanded their coverage of the geographic distribution of the religious\nfaithful in the United States. Look at the different maps here to see these patterns.\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/govbeat\/wp\/2015\/02\/26\/the-religious-states-of-america-in-22-maps\/ NORTH AMERICA: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 181\nThe rest of America\u2019s religious geography is also a story of\nmigration. The orange areas on the map in the upper Midwest\nrepresent Lutherans, which is the result of historic immigration\nfrom Scandinavia and northern Germany. In Chapter 30, you read\nabout the migration of Mormons to Utah (gray on the map), from\nwhere they fanned out to dominate much of the Great Basin. The\nblue color on the map indicates the Catholic Church. German-\nAmericans are the largest ethnic group in the United States, and\nmany German immigrants to the U.S. were Catholic. That explains\nmuch of the geography of Catholicism in the U.S., particularly in\nplaces like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan, which\nhave especially large German-American populations. Many of the\nrest of the Catholic areas on the map are the result of immigration\nfrom other Catholic countries \u2013 think of the large of number of\nIrish-Americans in Boston, Italian-Americans in New York, Polish-\nAmericans in Chicago, Cuban-Americans in Miami, French-\nAmericans in New Orleans, and Mexican-Americans throughout the\nsouthwest.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nMormon tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Utah.

CHAPTER 39\nNorth America\nEconomic Geography II\nThe Free Trade Debate\nFree trade has been one of the most hotly contested political and economic issues in the United States over the\nlast three decades. It\u2019s an unusual debate, because it doesn\u2019t pit the usual blocs of conservatives and liberals or\nRepublicans and Democrats against one another. Instead, the strongest proponents of free trade have been those\nat the political center \u2013 moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans. The greatest critics of free trade have\ncome from the left and right \u2013 liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, making for some rather strange\npolitical bedfellows. In this chapter, we\u2019ll look at the nature of free trade and examine the arguments of free trade\u2019s\nproponents and its critics.\nPROTECTIONISM VS. FREE TRADE\nTo make sense of free trade, it\u2019s helpful to understand what came before it. For a long time, many countries\nembraced an economic policy known as protectionism \u2013 policies that inhibit international trade. Countries that\nembraced protectionism still traded with one another, of course, because it was often necessary. If a country\n182 NORTH AMERICA ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 183\ncouldn\u2019t produce something \u2013 you can\u2019t grow cotton in Sweden, for example, and there is little coal in Japan \u2013\nthen that country was forced to important that product from elsewhere. However, if a country could produce a\ngood, the reigning economic theory was that governments should protect their domestic industries from foreign\ncompetition by placing a tariff, or import tax, on foreign products. For example, Germany can produce steel,\nand in order to protect German steelmakers, the German government would place a tariff on French, British,\nItalian, American, or Swedish steel. In addition to providing beneficial tax revenue, this tariff would make foreign\nsteel more expensive, and encourage German companies to buy their steel from German steelmakers. This would\nbenefit the shareholders of German companies, and protect the jobs of German workers.\nTariffs could be placed on any kind of import \u2013 wheat, cars, glass, coal, chemicals, textiles, etc. And there were\nother protectionist measures beyond tariffs. A government could place a quota on imports, saying that only so\nmuch of a given product could be imported from abroad in a given year. A government could pay subsidies to\ndomestic companies to keep their products cheap, and therefore more competitive against foreign imports. A\ngovernment could require foreign companies to have a license to sell a product, and limit the number of licenses\nit handed out. It could enforce trade calendars, banning the import of a certain product during a certain time\nof the year (this was a popular measure in agriculture). Governments could also manipulate health and safety\nregulations to keep foreign products out of their country.\nth\nThroughout the second half of the 20 century, many countries, including the United States, began to abandon\nprotectionism in favor of free trade. Free trade agreements eliminated tariffs and other trade barriers between\ncountries. In 1988, the United States signed a free trade agreement with Canada. In 1994, this agreement was\nexpanded to include Mexico, and was known as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In 2005, the\nUnited States entered into CAFTA (the Central American Free Trade Agreement) with Costa Rica, the Dominican\nRepublic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Additionally, the United States has bilateral free\ntrade agreements (those that involve just two countries) with Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Israel, Jordan,\nSouth Korea, Morocco, Oman, Panama, Peru, and Singapore.\nAmerican protectionism has made something of a comeback in the last few years, particularly since the election\nof Donald Trump. One of Trump\u2019s first directives in office was to remove the United States from the Trans-Pacific\nPartnership, a landmark agreement that would have created a free trade zone that included the United States,\nAustralia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.\nThe Trump administration has also been particularly fond of tariffs, slapping an import tax on a wide range\nof foreign products, from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines. Many of these tariffs have\nbeen aimed at China, with which the United States has a large trade deficit, but they\u2019ve also been levied against\ntraditional American allies, such as Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Argentina, and the European Union. This\nhas sparked a trade war, in which these countries have retaliated with tariffs on American products. 184 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nPROPONENTS OF FREE TRADE\nA primary argument for free trade is that it creates a larger market for companies and consumers. Even before\nit embraced free trade, the United States long benefited from a large home market. It is home to more than\nfive million individual companies and 333 million people. This is beneficial for both companies and consumers. As\nis discussed in Chapter 31, the more competitive a market is, the better its products will be. Because American\nconsumers live in such a large country, they have a wide range of producers to choose from, and therefore\ngenerally have access to a wide variety of cheap, high-quality goods and services. And businesses, of course,\nbenefit from having access to a large base of consumers as well as a large network of suppliers.\nBecause of its large market, the United States was relatively slow to embrace free trade. That began to change\nas larger markets emerged around the world. The European Economic Community was formed in 1958, and would\nlater evolve into the European Union, a twenty-seven member free trade area that is home to nearly 450 million\npeople. The ASEAN Free Trade area, a bloc made of ten countries in Southeast Asia, is home to more than 660\nmillion people. Mercosur, a five-member South American free trade area, has a population of nearly 300 million.\nThese free trade agreements, coupled with the economic emergence of China and India, home to more than a\nbillion people each, threatened the economic supremacy of the American market. So, the United States began\nto scramble to assemble its own free trade agreements. The combined population of NAFTA, CAFTA, and the\ndozen countries with which the U.S. has bilateral agreements is greater than 800 million people. These free trade\nagreements have more than doubled the size of the American market, providing a broader consumer and supplier\nbase for American companies, and greater choice for American consumers.\nProponents of free trade also argue that it leads to greater economic efficiency. Free trade theory centers on\nthe idea that some countries have a comparative advantage when it comes to producing certain products. In\nother words, some countries are really good at producing certain things, and maybe not so good at producing\nother things. Advocates of free trade argue that countries should specialize in what they are good at producing.\nAt the same time, they should avoid the production of goods they can\u2019t make efficiently. If Country A is in a position\nto efficiently produce steel, but not textiles, and Country B is in a position to efficiently produce textiles, but not\nsteel, it makes sense that Country A should specialize in steel, Country B in textiles, and that they should offset\nthose differences by trading with one another. By allocating more resources to the products for which they have a\ncomparative advantage, and by freeing up resources by not producing goods that take too much effort, production\nbecomes more efficient. In short, free trade means increased efficiency, which means greater profits for everyone.\nProponents of free trade argue that it has even loftier benefits. They argue that free trade prevents wars. It is\ndefinitely true that countries that are economically invested in one another (i.e., that trade extensively) are less NORTH AMERICA ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 185\nlikely to go to war with another. Advocates of free trade also argue that it is key to lifting vast segments of the\nearth\u2019s population out of poverty. If more countries embrace free trade, then more countries will specialize in what\nthey are comparatively good at, which will lead to greater efficiency, and greater profits. Those profits will then be\nreinvested into new technologies, which will lead to more innovation, which will lead to higher standards of living\nfor everyone.\nCRITICS OF FREE TRADE\nA leading concern about free trade is the effect of outsourcing. Outsourcing is the movement of jobs (mostly in\nmanufacturing) from higher wage countries to lower wage countries. Free trade agreements enable corporations\nto move these jobs with little disruption to their supply chain.\nThis creates environmental concerns. Production is often outsourced from countries with relatively strict\nenvironmental regulations to countries with much weaker environmental standards. This, of course, damages\nthe local environment in poorer countries, with increased air, water, and soil pollution. It also has negative\nconsequences for the entire planet, since poorer countries often have fewer regulations restricting carbon\nemissions, which contribute to climate change. Additionally, outsourcing often moves production of manufactured\ngoods thousands of miles away from their markets, increasing fossil fuel consumption through longer-distance\ntransportation.\nOutsourcing also creates labor issues. Manufacturers will often seek out the cheapest labor they can get away\nwith, creating what labor activists refer to as a \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d Workers in high-wage countries suffer because\ntheir jobs disappear, something that Midwestern industrial cities are painfully familiar with. But their loss is not\nnecessarily a poorer country\u2019s gain. The same manufacturing jobs that leave a wealthy country will pay dirt-cheap\nwages, and often feature unsafe conditions, when they arrive in a poorer country.\nWhen it comes to poorer countries, critics of free trade often speak of artificial specialization. Theoretically,\neach country benefits from free trade because it gets to specialize in what it does best. The reality for a lot of\npoorer countries, however, is that their \u201cspecialty\u201d is having extremely low wages and a poisoned environment.\nAs mentioned at the start of this chapter, the leading critics of free trade tend to be either very liberal or very\nconservative. American liberals criticize free trade because it exploits workers both at home and abroad, and\nbecause of the environmental damage associated with it. American conservatives believe that free trade weakens\nthe United States by making it too dependent on other countries, and often promote economic nationalism \u2013 186 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\npolicies that encourage Americans to exclusively invest in, and purchase from, American companies. It is not a\ncoincidence that President Trump\u2019s trade policy was named \u201cAmerica First.\u201d\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe collective GDP of the three NAFTA countries is $25 trillion. That\u2019s about ten times larger than the combined GDP of every country in\nAfrica. CHAPTER 40\nNorth America:\nHistorical Geography II\nHousing Discrimination in the Twin Cities\nNATHAN DEXTER\nIn the 1930s in President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, the United States federal government created the\n\u201cHome Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation\u201d (HOLC). What the HOLC is perhaps most famous for today is the creation of\n\u201cHOLC maps,\u201d which assigned various residential areas of cities grades for risk to mortgage lenders. Grading\ncriteria included property values, age of properties, depreciation, and racial\/ethnic makeup as well as economic\nclass of the residents. Throughout the country, black neighborhoods were assigned D grades, meaning that they\nwere considered hazardous for lending purposes. Though these maps were originally intended to be used for\ninformation on housing stock, they frequently also were used as guides for urban planning decisions, even for\nuprooting longstanding neighborhoods in favor of freeway construction.\nOne important example can be found in St. Paul, Minnesota. The zones D3 and D4 on the HOLC map cover two\nareas that were subject to extensive urban renewal and freeway building in the subsequent decades. Each zone in\neach city had a written description to accompany the grade. Here are some quotes from the descriptions:\nD3:\n\u2022 \u201cItalians, colored people, Jews of the lower strata and other people of foreign descent of the lower\n187 188 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nclasses reside here.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cVery heavy racial encroachment throughout the entire district is prominent. The only redeeming\nfeature is its accessibility to the downtown district.\u201d\nD4 (This neighborhood was known as Rondo, a largely African-American neighborhood):\n\u2022 \u201cThe laboring class with a large percentage of negroes live here.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe class of colored people in this area are somewhat better than other districts, many of them, due to\nthe City of St. Paul being the General Headquarters for the Northern Pacific and Great Northern Railroads,\nare pullman porters who do acquire ownership of their homes.\u201d\nIn the following decades, Interstates 94 and 35E were routed directly through these two areas. Rondo still exists\nas a neighborhood to some extent, but the area covered by D3 is largely devoid of any residential neighborhoods,\nreplaced with freeways, big box stores and light industrial zones.\nThese redlining practices and freeway construction projects served to enforce legalized racism in several ways.\nFirst, by labeling predominantly black districts as dangerous from a mortgage lending standpoint, black people\nwho may have been able to afford a home were often not able to get a mortgage in their neighborhoods. Second,\nblack residents of St. Paul were prevented from moving to other areas of the city by the use of racial covenants.\nRacial covenants are provisions in home deeds or titles that restrict sale of a property to non-white people. They\nwere commonplace in the 1920s-1950s in what were considered the most desirable neighborhoods, the As and\nBs on the HOLC maps. The University of Minnesota\u2019s \u201cMapping Prejudice\u201d project is working on mapping their\nprevalence in the Twin Cities.\nDue to these factors, black Minnesotans were both prevented from acquiring mortgages in the neighborhoods\nthey already resided in and were boxed out of neighborhoods they could have afforded and moved to. As a\nresult, they were prevented from enjoying the boom in home equity and wealth creation that middle-class white\nAmericans were able to take advantage of in the 1950s and 1960s. When people look back to these decades\nwith nostalgia, much of that comes from the home equity wealth that was new to many families at that time.\nThe financial security present in many white families today is the direct result of economic benefits that African-\nAmericans were not permitted to enjoy.\nIn these areas of St. Paul, the discrimination went further. The\nHOLC maps were used to aid in the planning of the interstate highway system. The route that was chosen for I-94 NORTH AMERICA: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 189\nthrough St. Paul was specifically intended to drive a literal rift through Rondo (D4). That this route was chosen\ncan at best be described as disregarding the thousands of residents in the neighborhood and can at worst be\nconsidered a deliberate effort to push black people out. This didn\u2019t have to be, however. St. Paul city planner\nGeorge Herrold expressed grave concern about the social impacts of the proposed freeway route. He suggested\nan alternate route using the railway corridor one mile to the North (go to https:\/\/3kpnuxym9k04c8ilz2quku1czd-\nwpengine.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/i94.jpg to see a map of these options). Herrold\u2019s efforts\nwere unsuccessful. It\u2019s worth noting that everything he predicted became true. Rondo was split with huge social\nconsequences, and the resulting creation of a concrete moat cut downtown St. Paul off from the rest of the city.\nHerrold\u2019s plan would have required a negotiation with the railroads to place the freeway in that zone, and railroad\ncompanies were frequently reluctant to negotiate such terms. This meant it was politically more viable to displace\nthousands of residents than to negotiate with a railroad.\nThough these practices happened decades ago, they still matter today for multiple reasons. First, many people\nalive today saw what happened to Rondo and still remember what it was like before. I-94 wasn\u2019t completed\nbetween the two cities until 1968. The resulting decline of Rondo led to a loss in property wealth for its residents,\nprompting widespread poverty. As mentioned above, African-Americans elsewhere were legally prevented from\nparticipating in the wealth generation that white Americans utilized in the middle of the 20th century. This\ndisparity in housing wealth is a critical reason why there is such a wealth gap between white Americans and black\nAmericans today. The government of the United States put in place a legal framework permitting the ghettoization\nof black people; moreover, in some cases the system extended a step further in allowing those neighborhoods to\nbe destroyed. In its broadest sense, racial tension in America is present today because equality has never been\nachieved. In a specific and profound way, this inequality has been facilitated by a complex legal and social system\nof discriminatory housing patterns.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nJosh Wilder\u2019s play \u201cThe Highwaymen\u201d examines the politics of St. Paul\u2019s city hall in 1956, particularly regarding the planning for the I-94\nhighway.\nHere is a HOLC map for Chicago in 1940: 190 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nHot off the Press\nThe online edition of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports that for\nall American metro areas of at least one million people, Minneapolis\nhas the lowest rate of African-American home ownership.\nPalmer, Kim. 2020. \u201cConfronting the Black Homeownership Gap in\nMinnesota.\u201d Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

CHAPTER 41\nNorth America: Physical Geography II\nMaritime and Continental Climates\nTwo of the most important influences on the temperature of a location are discussed elsewhere in this book.\nIn Chapter 6, we examine the relationship between latitude and temperature. Generally, places at lower latitudes\n(closer to the equator) tend to be warmer than places at higher latitudes (closer to the poles). In Chapter 68, we\nanalyze the relationship between elevation and temperature. Places at higher elevations are usually cooler than\nplaces at lower elevations. There is a third important influence on temperature \u2013 whether or not a location has a\ncontinental climate or a maritime climate.\nContinental climates are found in locations that take on the temperature characteristics of a large land mass.\nThey are characterized by extreme variations in temperatures throughout the year, featuring hot summers and\ncold winters. Maritime climates are found in locations that take on the temperature characteristics of a large\nbody of water. They are characterized by much less extreme annual temperature variations, featuring relatively\nmild summers and winters. Maritime climates are sometimes called \u201cmarine\u201d climates. Both terms are derived\nfrom the Latin word mare, which means \u201csea.\u201d\n191 192 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nTo get a sense of the difference between continental\nand maritime climates, we\u2019ll examine the temperature\npatterns of three American cities: Seattle, Fargo, and\nBoston. Seattle, Washington, is located in the\nnorthwestern U.S., situated on Puget Sound, just\ninland from the Pacific Ocean. Fargo, North Dakota, is\nSeattle. Photo by Manuel Bahamontez H on Flickr.\nin the north-central U.S., close to the dead center of\nthe North American continent. Boston, Massachusetts,\nis located in the northeastern U.S., on the Atlantic Ocean. Seattle is the northernmost of the three cities, and\nBoston the southernmost, but they\u2019re all located within a few degrees of latitude of one another. None of them\nare at significantly high elevations. So, based on latitude and elevation, they should have relatively similar climates.\nBut one of them is quite different from the other two \u2013 Seattle has a maritime climate, while Fargo and Boston\nhave continental climates.\nCITY TEMPERATURES\nCity Avg. January\u00caLow Record Low Avg. July High Record High\nSeattle 36\u00b0F 16\u00b0F 75\u00b0F 96\u00b0F\nFargo -2\u00b0F -48\u00b0F 82\u00b0F 114\u00b0F\nBoston 22\u00b0F -30\u00b0F 82\u00b0F 104\u00b0F\nIn the table above, you can get a sense of Seattle\u2019s relatively mild maritime climate. Its average January low is\n36\u02daF, which is not terribly cold, particularly given the city\u2019s northerly location. The coldest it has ever gotten in\nSeattle is 16\u02daF, a temperature most Midwestern cities plunge below every single winter, often for days at a time.\nNow, consider Fargo. On a typical January day, Fargo drops to a frigid -2\u02daF, usually running about 38\u02da colder than\nSeattle. And Fargo can get much colder than that. Its record low is a stunning -48\u02daF, which is 64\u02da colder than\nSeattle\u2019s record. The pattern is reversed in the summer. In July, Fargo is usually running several degrees warmer\nthan Seattle, and regularly approaches or exceeds 100\u02daF. Seattle has never broken the 100\u02daF mark. The difference\nbetween a typical January day in Seattle and a typical July day is only 39\u02daF, while the difference in Fargo is 84\u02daF.\nThe difference between Seattle\u2019s record high and low is just 60\u02daF, while the difference in Fargo is a whopping\n162\u02daF.\nWe\u2019ll consider Boston\u2019s numbers in a moment. But first, to get a sense of why Fargo and Seattle have such\ndifferent temperature patterns, let\u2019s take trip to the beach. Imagine that you are in Chicago in May, and you head\nto one of the beaches along Lake Michigan. It is the first truly hot day of the year, with plenty of sunshine. You take\noff your shoes and start walking across the sand. Even though it\u2019s been cold for months, you find that the sand is\nblazing hot. You go sprinting across the sand, wade into the water, and get quite a shock. Even though it\u2019s a hot\nday, the water is freezing cold.\nNow, imagine that you return to the beach a few months later. It\u2019s a cloudy, chilly day in late September. You\ntake off your shoes and start walking across the sand. Even though it\u2019s been hot for months, the sand is cool. You\nstroll across the sand, and wade into the water. Even though it\u2019s a cool day, the water is relatively warm, much\nwarmer than it was back in May.\nWhat your two trips to the beach have taught you is that the sand tends to heat up very quickly in the spring,\nand cool down very quickly in the fall. The lake tends to heat up very slowly in the spring, and cool down very\nslowly in the fall. On a global scale, continents behave like the sand on the beach, and oceans behave like the\nwater in the lake. Both Seattle and Fargo are located in the westerlies, so most of the air in these cities arrive from\nthe west. That means that the air in Seattle arrives directly off the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific heats up very slowly NORTH AMERICA: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY II 193\nin the spring and summer, keeping temperatures in Seattle relatively cool. Then, in the fall and winter, the Pacific\nloses its heat very slowly, keeping temperatures in Seattle relatively warm.\nFargo is located more than a thousand miles from\nthe Pacific.

CHAPTER 42\nNorth America: Political Geography II\nThe Electoral College and Swing States\nIn most elections, the winner is determined by the popular vote. The popular vote is the sum of all ballots\ncast by voters in an election. The word \u201cpopular,\u201d in this sense, refers to population. The popular vote is the\npeople\u2019s vote. Senators, congressional representatives, governors, and nearly every other elected official in the\nUnited States is selected by popular vote. There is one major exception. Americans elect a president every\nfour years, and it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote, but lose the election. This has happened\nfour times in American history, most recently in 2016, when Hillary Clinton received nearly three million more\nvotes than Donald Trump. Trump, however, won the election because he was victorious in the electoral college.\nFor a terrific dot-density map of the election results, go to https:\/\/carto.maps.arcgis.com\/apps\/webappviewer\/\nindex.html?id=8732c91ba7a14d818cd26b776250d2c3\nThe electoral college is a group of people chosen by voters to elect the president. Here\u2019s how it works:\nEach state is assigned a certain number of electoral votes. The distribution of electoral votes is determined by\ncongressional representation, with each state receiving one electoral vote for every member who represents them\nin Congress. There are 100 members of the U.S. Senate, and 435 members of the House of Representatives, for\na total of 535. The District of Columbia has no representation in Congress, but is constitutionally allotted three\nelectoral votes, bringing the total number of electors to 538.\nIllinois, for example, has two senators and eighteen representatives, so it is\n195 196 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nallotted twenty electoral votes. California has the most electoral votes, with fifty-\nfive. Since each state has two senators and at least one representative, the\nminimum number of electoral votes a state is allotted is three. Alaska, Montana,\nWyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont (along with D.C.) are each\nare allotted the minimum. The candidate who accumulates more than half of the\nelectoral votes, at least 270, wins the presidential election.\nThe states\u2019 electoral votes are, with few exceptions, winner-take-all. If a presidential candidate wins Illinois by a\nmillion ballots, they receive all twenty of the state\u2019s electoral votes. If a presidential candidate wins Illinois by one\nballot, they still receive all twenty of the state\u2019s electoral votes. The margin of victory doesn\u2019t matter.\nOnly two states \u2013 Maine and Nebraska \u2013 are not winner-take-all. In those states, the winner of the overall\npopular vote automatically receives two electoral votes. The remaining electoral votes are assigned based on\nwhich candidate wins in each congressional district. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won in Maine, but lost one of its two\ncongressional districts, so she received three of Maine\u2019s electoral votes, while Donald Trump received one.\nThe winner-take-all nature of the electoral college means that a handful of states, known as swing states, receive\nnearly all of the attention during presidential campaigns. A swing state is a state where presidential elections\ntend to be relatively close. Because of that, these states have a tendency to \u201cswing\u201d from one party to the next\nover the course of a few elections. Presidential candidates tend to pour most of their time and money into swing\nstates, since they are key in determining the outcome of an election.\nTo better understand swing states, we\u2019ll look briefly at the last\nfour presidential elections. In 2004, President George W. Bush, a\nRepublican, was running for reelection against Senator John Kerry,\na Democrat. Senator Kerry won several states that were rich in\nelectoral votes, such as New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and\nCalifornia, but it was not enough to overcome President Bush, who\nwon the electoral college 286 to 251.\nThe 2008 election\npit two senators\nagainst one another\n\u2013 Democrat Barack\n2004 Presidential Election \u2013 Swing States.\nObama and\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nRepublican John\nMcCain. Senator\nMcCain did not have to reinvent the wheel in this election. There\nwas no need for him to pick up any states that Democrats had won\nin 2004. He simply needed to recreate the electoral map that had\nelected George W. Bush. Likewise, Senator Obama did not need to\ncompletely rearrange the electoral map. He simply needed to\n2008 Presidential Election \u2013 Swing States.\nswing enough states out of the Republican column and into the\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nDemocratic column. He did just that. Nine states that had voted for\nBush in 2004 swung to the Democrats in 2008 \u2013 Nevada, Colorado,\nNew Mexico, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida \u2013 giving Obama 365 electoral votes to\nMcCain\u2019s 173.\nOne of the peculiarities of the electoral college can be seen in the 2008 election. The two biggest prizes in the\nelectoral college \u2013 California, with fifty-five electoral votes, and Texas, with thirty-four electoral votes \u2013 received NORTH AMERICA: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 197\npractically no attention from either candidate. This is because of the winner-take-all nature of the electoral college.\nMcCain received 37% of the popular vote in California. If McCain had spent millions of dollars and done weeks\nof campaigning in California, and managed to raise his share of the popular vote up to 45%, how many more\nelectoral votes would he have received? Zero. Likewise, if Obama had poured resources in Texas, and raised his\npopular vote share from 45% to 49%, he wouldn\u2019t have gained any additional electoral votes. If a candidate has\nlittle hope of winning a state, it makes little sense to campaign there. Time and money are better spent on states\nwhere victory is possible \u2013 that is, in the swing states.\nIn 2012, the Republicans nominated former Massachusetts\ngovernor Mitt Romney to take on President Obama. Obama was\nlooking to recreate his 2008 victory map, while Romney attempted\nto nudge some of 2008\u2019s swing states back into the Republican\ncolumn. Romney was able to swing two of them \u2013 North Carolina\nand Indiana \u2013 but that was not enough to get the Republicans back\nto 270, and Obama won reelection with a 332-206 margin in the\nelectoral college.\nIn 2016,\nDemocratic\nnominee Hillary\n2012 Presidential Election \u2013 Swing States.\nClinton was looking\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nto maintain the\nObama victory\nmap, while Republican nominee Donald Trump sought to flip some\nof the Obama swing states.

Each party selects these electors long before the\nelection. After the election, the electors from the winning candidate\u2019s party travel to their state capital and cast their ballots for president. In\nmost states, the electors are required to vote for the candidate who won their state\u2019s popular vote. In some states, that is not a requirement,\nand occasionally electors have gone rogue. They are known as \u201cfaithless\u201d electors, and there were seven of them in 2016. Five electors\nabandoned Hillary Clinton, and two abandoned Donald Trump. As a result, Colin Powell, John Kasich, Ron Paul, Bernie Sanders, and Faith\nSpotted Eagle each received electoral votes. It did not affect the outcome of the election. On July 6, 2020, the US Supreme Court unanimously\nruled that state laws allowing faithless electors are constitutional. 198 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nHot Off the Press\nVisual Capitalist\nIn this animated feature from November 2, 2020, the Visual Capitalist displays the trends of statewide voting in presidential elections from\n1976 to 2016.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nWandersen, Jeff. 2016 Presidential Election \u2013 Swing States.

That model examines the process through which\nsocieties transform from rural to urban, from preindustrial to postindustrial, and from an era that features high\nbirth rates and high death rates, through a population explosion, to eras that feature low birth rates and low death\nrates. As a society undergoes these monumental demographic transformations, it is only natural that cultural\nattitudes and behaviors will transform with them. And as these attitudes and behaviors change, they give rise to\nculture wars. Culture wars are conflicts related to things like marriage, family, sex, and gender. While these are\nusually \u201cwars\u201d only in the metaphorical sense \u2013 taking place in the social and political arena \u2013 they sometimes do\ndevolve into actual violent conflict.\nIn the United States, the debate over these cultural conventions has divided governments, political parties,\nreligious organizations, communities, and families, and remain a leading source of divisiveness in the country.\nThese debates are by no means unique to the United States. All areas of the world that go through the\ndemographic transition have experienced, are experiencing, or will experience these culture wars.\nAt the core of these conflicts is a battle between social conservatives \u2013 those who adhere to the traditional\ncultural values established in the preindustrial era \u2013 and social liberals, who welcome the more modern cultural\nvalues established in the industrial and postindustrial eras. In this chapter, we\u2019ll examine traditional cultural\nvalues, the trends in society that threaten those values, and how these trends were created by the demographic\ntransition.\n199 200 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA primary cultural convention in traditional societies was the idea that marriage was the central institution in\nsociety. Marriages in traditional societies typically ended only in death \u2014 divorces were rare and, in many cases,\nnearly impossible to obtain. Securing a spouse was considered to be the most significant moment in a person\u2019s\nlife. In preindustrial societies, a wife was necessary for a man\u2019s livelihood, because most men were farmers, and\nchildren were a vital source of farm labor. In these societies, a husband was even more necessary for a woman\u2019s\nlivelihood, because there were so few educational and career opportunities for women. People got married at a\nyoung age \u2013 often in their late teens \u2013 and had children as soon and as often as possible.\nAnother cultural convention in traditional societies was an extremely conservative attitude toward sex. In these\nsocieties, the prevailing belief was that sexual activity should be confined to marriage, with reproduction as its\nprimary goal. Premarital, extramarital, and gay sex were culturally unacceptable, as was any form of birth control.\nSex was a private matter, and any overt displays of sexuality were culturally unacceptable.\nFinally, a key cultural convention in traditional societies can be summarized in the old phrase, \u201ca woman\u2019s place\nis in the home.\u201d In modern societies, such an idea seems not only old-fashioned, but offensive. In traditional\nsocieties, however, it was generally accepted as fact. Married women were expected to confine themselves to the\ndomestic sphere. Their jobs were to be wives and mothers, and little else. Men were in charge of the public sphere.\nThings like business and politics were exclusively male domains.\nTo understand this cultural attitude, it is important to consider both the demographics and technology of the\npreindustrial era. In 1850, the United States\u2019 total fertility rate was 7.9, meaning that the average American\nwoman had about eight children. Being a mother is still not easy, but in the 1850s it was practically tortuous.\nImagine raising eight children without the modern conveniences of supermarkets, mass-produced clothing, indoor\nplumbing, electricity, hot water heaters, washing machines, dryers, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, dishwashers,\ndisposable diapers, and microwave ovens, to name a few. If a woman\u2019s place was in the home, it was because she\nhad little time to be anyplace else.\nBy 1920, the demographic transition in the United States was in full swing. That was the first year that more\nAmericans lived in cities than in rural areas. A century later, the lifestyles of the preindustrial era have largely\nfaded into the past, but the cultural conventions established during that era are alive and well in the minds of\nmany conservative Americans. It is notable that American social conservatives are most prominent in rural areas\nand small towns, where cultural connections with the preindustrial past are strongest, and social liberals are most\nprominent in large cities, where cultural connections with the preindustrial past are weakest.\nThe culture wars are complex, but four cultural trends have been particularly distressing for social\nconservatives: women\u2019s liberation, the increased divorce rate, premarital and extramarital sex, and the LGBTQ\nmovement. NORTH AMERICA: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 201\nWomen\u2019s liberation refers to the movement of women into the public sphere. Over the last century, women\nhave increasingly carved out space for themselves in the political, economic, and social arenas traditionally\ndominated by men. It would be difficult to argue that this movement is complete. Women still typically earn\nabout 20% less than their male counterparts, and the boardrooms of American corporations are still largely male.\nWomen still make up less than a quarter of the U.S. Congress, and the United States has never had a female\nth\npresident or vice president. Still, there has been progress. Remember, the 19 Amendment to the Constitution \u2013\nallowing women to vote throughout the United States \u2013 was not enacted until 1920. While it would be unfair to\nsay that social conservatives universally oppose women\u2019s liberation, it would also be a stretch to argue that they\u2019ve\nbeen the most ardent supporters of it. One of the most popular figures among social conservatives is the radio\nhost Rush Limbaugh, who has the infamous habit of referring to feminists as \u201cfemi-Nazis.\u201d\nSocial conservatives often cite the increased divorce rate as another alarming indication of the erosion of\ntraditional cultural values in America. As mentioned above, divorces were discouraged, if not impossible, in\ntraditional societies. In 1890, fewer than 1% of American marriages ended in divorce. By 1990, about 45% of\nmarriages ended in divorce.\nAnother commonly cited sign of the decay of traditional cultural attitudes is an increased acceptance of\npremarital sex and extramarital sex (premarital refers to sex before marriage, and is a subset of extramarital\nsex, which is any sex that takes place outside of marriage). In traditional societies, people generally waited until\nthey were married to have sex. If they didn\u2019t wait, they certainly didn\u2019t advertise that fact. Today, sex outside\nof marriage is much more widely discussed and accepted. In response to this, many social conservatives have\npromoted abstinence education, encouraging young people to abstain from premarital sex, and in some states,\nthey\u2019ve been able to make such programs part of the public-school curriculum. 202 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nFinally, many social conservatives had been alarmed by the LGBTQ\nrights movement (LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning). In traditional\nsocieties, only heterosexual sex was considered morally permissible, and a person\u2019s gender was expected to\nconform to their biological sex at birth. Like the women\u2019s rights movement, the LGBTQ movement has come\na long way, and has a long way to go. In 1962, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality.\nEighteen more states decriminalized it by 1980, but being gay would not be technically legal throughout the United\nStates until a 2003 Supreme Court decision. That same year, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize gay\nmarriage. Marriage equality would not come to all states until a Supreme Court decision in 2015, and LGBTQ\nindividuals would not be considered a protected minority under the Civil Rights Act until a Supreme Court decision\nin 2020. Despite these legal advances, LGBTQ rights remain a deeply divisive issue.\nAmericans will likely debate these cultural changes for years to come, but there is little doubt about what is\ndriving them \u2013 the demographic transition. First, women\u2019s liberation. In traditional societies, women started having\nchildren at a very young age, and had a lot of children over the course of their lifetimes. Coupled with shorter life\nspans, this meant that women spent the bulk of their adult lives as the mothers of young children.\nToday\u2019s situation is quite different. To begin, women are having far\nfewer children. Women are also getting married later, and are much more likely to get an education and start\na career before having kids. The average American woman has two children, usually about three years apart.\nThat means that, by the time the second child enters school, only eight years have passed. That represents only\n10% of the average American woman\u2019s lifespan. So, many women reenter the workforce after their second child NORTH AMERICA: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 203\nenters school, if they ever left the workforce at all \u2013 many women continue to work as they raise small children.\nAs mentioned above, women in traditional societies had little time to invest in anything outside of the domestic\nsphere. That is not true for modern women, and as a result they have staked their claim to the traditionally male-\ndominated public sphere.\nThe demographic transition is also behind the increased divorce rate. It is worth noting that there have always\nbeen unhappy marriages. But marriages used to be an economic necessity, particularly for women. That is not the\ncase anymore, since women have access to educational and career opportunities that didn\u2019t exist a century ago.\nThose opportunities arose because of the declining birth rates associated with the demographic transition. The\nlack of economic necessity has removed a powerful stabilizing force from marriage.\nFor a century, social conservatives have attributed the increased acceptance of premarital and extramarital\nsex to all kinds of things \u2013 movies, jazz, rock and roll, television, the internet \u2013 but the real driving force behind\nthis cultural change has been the demographic transition. That, and some basic math. On average, children\nenter puberty at the age of twelve. The process usually takes about four years, meaning that most people reach\nsexual maturity around the age of sixteen. In traditional societies, people often got married in their late teens,\nso the window between sexual maturity and marriage was often only a couple of years. As such, asking people\nto abstain from sex before marriage was somewhat reasonable. Today, because of the social changes created\nby the demographic transition, the average American gets married when they are twenty-eight years old. That\nmeans that, for most Americans, a dozen years pass between sexual maturity and marriage. That makes sexual\nabstinence a lot less likely.\nAs premarital and extramarital sex became more common \u2013 and more commonly accepted \u2013 Americans began\nto think and talk about sex in a different way. Sex was no longer something to be hidden away in marriage with\nreproduction as its primary goal. In a sense, sex was culturally \u201cdecoupled\u201d from marriage and reproduction. This\nallowed for discussions of gay sex \u2013 long a taboo topic in the United States \u2013 to enter into the mainstream cultural\nconversation. Attitudes and conventions began to shift. As a result of that, open discussions about gender identity\nalso began to enter into mainstream culture. And all of these conversations were sparked by the demographic\ntransition.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nIn 1890, Annie White Baxter of Carthage, Missouri, was elected Clerk of Jasper County. She was the first woman to hold elective office in the\nUnited States. CHAPTER 44\nNorth America: Urban Geography II\nGentrification\nMany urban neighborhoods in the United States began to\ndecline in the 1950s, and many of them have never recovered.\nBut some have. Gentrification is the economic revitalization of\na once troubled urban neighborhood. Lower income residents\nare replaced by higher income residents, and older housing is\nrenovated or replaced. Old industrial landscapes, like\nwarehouses and factories, are renovated as, or replaced by,\ncondos, galleries, clubs, restaurants, theaters, offices, or similar\nupscale commercial activities.\nAll major American cities have experienced some\ngentrification. In Chicago, gentrification has largely been\nfocused on the North Side, although some neighborhoods just\nsouth and west of the Loop have gentrified as well. Here is a\nphoto from Chicago Avenue by Eric Allix Rogers.\nGentrified street in Chicago.\nA major cause of gentrification was simple real estate\nPhoto by Eric Allix Rogers on Flickr.\neconomics. By the 1980s, real estate in the suburbs had\nbecome extremely expensive. At the same time, urban real\nestate values had collapsed. Magnificent old buildings in the inner city could be purchased for next to nothing. It\nwas only a matter of time before someone rolled the dice and took a chance on redeveloping a decayed inner-city\nneighborhood. Of course, the city and county governments of these depressed neighborhoods were more than\nhappy to help. Governments gave economic grants and tax incentives to developers willing to revitalize an urban\nneighborhood. Governments also helped to fund the construction of parks, stadiums, and concert venues to serve\nas anchors for gentrification.\n204 NORTH AMERICA: URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 205\nPortland, Oregon \u2013 Photo by Anna Holowetzki on Unsplash\nOther important factors were new environmental laws and the deindustrialization of American cities. Many\npeople fled to the suburbs to avoid the smoke, filth, and crowds of industrial cities. Because of stronger\nenvironmental rules, closed factories, and decades of flight to the suburbs, cities had become cleaner and less\ncrowded. They could be a much more pleasant place to live.\nChanging cultural conventions in the United States also helped to spur gentrification. One involved sexuality.\nPrior to the 1960s, it was uncommon for people to be openly gay. In fact, it was illegal. Gay sex was a crime in\nIllinois until 1962, and remained illegal in many other states for several years after that. Even after legalization, gay\nAmericans continued to face discrimination. Gay bars and clubs were discouraged in the suburbs and in upscale\nurban neighborhoods, so they often located in economically depressed urban areas. These bars, clubs, and other\ngay-owned or gay-friendly businesses served as anchors for evolving gay neighborhoods, many of which became\nsome of the first gentrified neighborhoods in their respective cities. New York\u2019s Chelsea, Boston\u2019s South End,\nWashington\u2019s DuPont Circle, and Chicago\u2019s Boystown are all examples of early gentrification, and all have strong\nties to the gay community.\nAnother important cultural change of the last few decades has been the age at which Americans get married and\nhave children. In the 1950s, most Americans got married shortly after finishing high school or college, and usually\nhad their first child not too long after. The suburbs were, and still are, designed to cater to the needs of the nuclear\nfamily \u2013 a married couple with children. Compared to cities, the suburbs usually offer larger houses with larger\nyards. Crime rates are usually lower, and schools are generally better-funded. These are, of course, all things that 206 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nparents are interested in. So, in the 1950s, middle-class Americans typically finished school, got married, moved\nto the suburbs, and started a family.\nBy the 1990s, however, cultural conventions were changing. More people were attending college, and thus\ngetting married later. More women were starting careers, and having children later, or having no children at all.\nThis meant that more people were spending their 20s and early 30s, and perhaps their entire adult life, living\noutside of a nuclear family. Because of that, the suburbs became less appealing to many people. At the same\ntime, cities were becoming more appealing places to live. Young, college-educated Americans began moving to\ngentrifying urban neighborhoods.\nPerhaps the most important force in gentrification were the DINKs. DINK is an acronym for \u201cDouble Income, No\nKids,\u201d a term that was popularized in gentrifying neighborhoods in the 1980s. A DINK is someone who lives with\nhis or her boyfriend, girlfriend, or spouse, and does not have children. DINKs are often synonymous with \u201cyuppies\u201d\n\u2013 another 1980s term derived from \u201cyoung urban professional.\u201d DINKs are young college graduates with white-\ncollar jobs and good incomes.\nBecause they share the cost of housing, don\u2019t have kids, and make good money, DINKs have loads of disposable\nincome. If you walk through a gentrifying neighborhood and glance in the windows of the trendy restaurants and\nshops, and wonder who on earth has money to spend on that sort of thing, it\u2019s the DINKs. Not everyone who lives\nin a gentrifying neighborhood is a DINK, of course, but since the 1980s, gentrifying neighborhoods have evolved\naround the tastes, and wallets, of DINKs.\nTraditionally, DINKs who eventually had kids would move off to the suburbs. That\u2019s changed over the last decade\nor so. As gentrified neighborhoods have become cleaner and safer, many former DINKs have decided to raise their\nchildren there. Oddly, many American parents now have a reverse commute, working in the suburbs, but raising\na family in the city, turning the suburban model on its head.\nThere is no denying the positives of gentrification. It\u2019s great to see historic neighborhoods spring back to life\nafter decades of economic decay. But gentrification has some serious downsides. As soon as a neighborhood\nbegins to gentrify, property taxes and rents spiral upward. Many working-class families who have lived in the same\nneighborhood for generations suddenly find themselves priced out of it. Neighborhood institutions like churches\nand ethnic clubs dwindle as their members are forced to move away. Long-standing neighborhood shops, bars,\nand restaurants close down because rents and property values are too high, or because they don\u2019t cater to the\ninterests of the DINKs.

CHAPTER 45\nNorth America: Overview\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY: THE UNITED STATES\nLLaannddffoorrmm RReeggiioonnss\nThere are three major alpine regions in the United States, each of them running roughly north-to-south. One\nconsists of a pair of ranges near the Pacific Ocean. The Coast Ranges are a relatively low mountain range that\nrun the length of the Pacific Coast. A few hundred miles inland is a much more significant mountain range, known\nas the Cascades in central Oregon and Washington, and as the Sierra Nevada in eastern California. These are\nextremely rugged mountains with very high elevations, some of them rising above 14,000 feet. A few major valleys\nare interspersed between the Coast Ranges and the Sierra Nevada\/Cascades, notably the Central Valley, a very\nflat, elongated plain occupying some 18,000 square miles of California.\nA second major alpine region is the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies extend south out of Canada, occupying parts\nof Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. Like the Sierra Nevada\/Cascades, elevations are\nhigh and the landscapes are dramatic.\n208 NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 209\nBetween the Sierra Nevada\/Cascades and the\nRockies, extending from eastern Washington to\nsouthern New Mexico, is a region known as the\nIntermountain West. It is an area of short, rugged\nmountain ranges separated by basins, plateaus, and\nplains. The southern part of this region is well known\nfor the rugged beauty of its highly eroded landscapes,\nincluding the Grand Canyon of Arizona.\nThe United States\u2019 third major alpine region is the\nZion National Park.

The Appalachians are\nmuch older than the mountains of the west, and have\nbeen weathered to significantly lower elevations, with\nthe highest peaks topping out just above 6,600 feet. Although low, the Appalachians are steep and thickly forested.\nMuch of the region possesses a remarkably orderly sequence of ridges and valleys. Extending east from the\nAppalachians is a rolling plateau known as the Piedmont, which runs from southeastern Pennsylvania to northern\nGeorgia.\nThe flattest region of the country is the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain. It begins as a very narrow strip along the\ncoast of New England. The plain then broadens in southern New Jersey, sweeping across the eastern thirds of\nVirginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. All of Florida is on the Coastal Plain, as is southern Alabama and Arkansas,\neastern Texas, and all of Louisiana and Mississippi. The coastal plain slopes very gradually toward the sea,\nsometimes at a rate of only a few feet, or even a few inches, per mile. Because of this, the region has historically\nbeen very swampy, since flat landscapes do not shed water very quickly. Many of those swamps have been\ndrained by vast networks of ditches and canals. Unlike the West Coast, where mountains run right up to the ocean,\nthe transition from land to sea along the Gulf-Atlantic Coast Plain is far more gradual, and the shoreline is dotted\nby bays, bayous, and flat islands.\nDominating the heart of the country is another flat region\nknown as the Interior Plains. This vast region is bordered on\nthe east by the Appalachians, on the south by Ohio River, on\nthe north by the Great Lakes, and on the west by the Rockies.\nThe dry, grassy western section of the Interior Plains is\nsometimes called the Great Plains.\nSome parts of the Interior Plains are remarkably flat, but\nmuch it has a gently rolling surface. There are a few areas of\nlow hills scattered about the region, such as the Flint Hills of\nKansas, or the Sand Hills of Nebraska. The northern sections of\nGreat Plains. Photo by Schnitzel_bank on Flickr.\nthe Interior Plains were scoured during the last ice age, the\nmost notable result being the presence of numerous lakes,\nincluding the Great Lakes, and the thousands of smaller lakes that dot Wisconsin and Minnesota. 210 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThere are a few highland regions in the central part\nof the country, including some hilly, deeply eroded\nplateaus in central Kentucky and Tennessee. The\nSuperior Uplands, located in northern Minnesota and\nWisconsin, are a hilly extension of the Canadian Shield.\nThe most rugged landscapes in the central United\nStates are found in the Ozark Highlands of southern\nOzark Mountains and White River.

Areas south and east of Wichita possess\na humid subtropical climate. This climate features a very long warm season. Summers are quite hot, and\nextraordinarily muggy. The cold season is comparatively short. Winters are generally mild, although the region\ndoes experience brief spells of cold weather. Precipitation is heaviest in summer, since warmer air typically\ncontains more water vapor than cooler air, although this region is generally wet year-round.\nAreas north and east of Wichita possess a humid continental climate. As a continental climate, its\ntemperatures are defined by seasonal extremes. Summers tend to be quite hot, and winters tend to be quite cold.\nPrecipitation levels are relatively high in summer. Winter precipitation rates are lower, although this area regularly\nreceives significant snowfalls.\nMuch of the American West is dominated by a steppe climate. Steppe climates are characterized by hot\nsummers and cold winters, but the most dominant trait is aridity. Although not quite a desert, steppe climates are\nsignificantly drier than the humid climates found in the eastern half of the United States. The transition is clearly\nmanifested on the landscape as you head west\u2014trees give way to grasslands, corn gives way to wheat, and the\ntowns become fewer and far between. This climate is found in many of the lowland areas between Wichita and the\nSierra Nevada, and also in California\u2019s Central Valley. These relatively arid climates are the result of rain shadows\ncast by the Coast Ranges, the Sierra Nevada\/Cascades, and the Rockies. NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 211\nDeserts can be found in the southwestern United States, from\nsoutheastern California to southwestern Texas, including much of\nArizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and southern Utah. In lowland\nareas, this climate generally features extremely hot summers and\nvery mild winters. At higher elevations, temperatures can get quite\ncold, particularly in winter. Precipitation rates are low year-round,\na result of the almost constant presence of high air pressure.\nAlpine climates can be found throughout the Rockies, Sierra\nNevada, and Cascades. This is not a climate in and of itself, but a\ncomplex region of thousands of microclimates. Generally speaking,\nthough, these mountains tend to be colder and wetter in the north,\nand drier and hotter in the south.\nCoastal California is home to a Mediterranean climate. It is a\nArizona. Photo by Mary Fairchild on Flickr.\nmaritime climate, so temperatures are generally mild year-round.\nThe spring and fall tend to be dry, and the summers can be virtually\nrainless, due to the presence of high air pressure. Winters can be relatively rainy, as the high pressure shifts south,\nand the westerlies carry moisture in off the Pacific. Coastal Oregon and Washington are home to a marine west\ncoast climate. This is another maritime climate, so temperatures tend to be relatively mild year-round. Since the\nwesterlies are constantly pushing moisture in off the Pacific, this region is wet throughout the year, with maximum\nprecipitation occurring in winter.\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nMany of Canada\u2019s landform regions are extensions of those\nfound in the United States. The high elevations of the Pacific and\nRocky Mountain systems extend northward into British Columbia\nand the Yukon. The flat, fertile Interior Plains extend northward\ninto southern Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and\nAlberta. The low Appalachian Mountains extend northward into\nNew Brunswick, eastern Quebec, and Newfoundland. Much of the\nrest of Canada is dominated by the Canadian Shield (see Chapter\n33).\nThe humid continental climate dominates much of Canada,\nfeaturing moderate precipitation, warm to hot summers and cold\nwinters, with temperatures in both summer and winter declining as\nlatitude increases. The rainy, mild marine west coast climate is Moraine Lake, Banff, Alberta, Canada. Photo by\nfound along the coast of British Columbia.

Although it is a relatively small region, the Northeast\nis densely populated, containing 20% of the country\u2019s population.\nOne of the most prominent features of the Northeast is the Bos-Wash Megalopolis, a string of nearly\ncontinuous metropolitan development along the Atlantic Coast from Boston to Washington. This is the most\ndensely populated region of the United States. It is home to one-sixth of the U.S. population, and includes four of\nthe country\u2019s ten largest metropolitan areas: New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston. It also includes the\nmid-sized metropolitan areas of Baltimore, Providence, and Hartford. It is the second most heavily industrialized\ncorridor in the U.S., and contains the country\u2019s political capital, Washington, and its unofficial economic capital,\nNew York. As is discussed in Chapter 32, most of these cities evolved around excellent natural harbors. For years,\nnearly all of the country\u2019s imports, exports, and immigrants passed through these ports. They were a natural\nlocation for factories, banks, and corporations. NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 213\nBecause New York had the easiest connection to the\ninterior of the country (also discussed in Chapter 32), it\nbecame the most prominent city in the Northeast, and\nin the country. It was already the United States\u2019 largest\ncity in 1790, and today, with 19 million people, it\nremains the most populous metro area in the country\nby a fairly wide margin. It is the world\u2019s largest financial\ncenter, contains more corporate headquarters than\nany other city on earth, and is home to one of the\nworld\u2019s busiest ports.\nTThhee MMiiddwweesstt\nManhattan, New York. Photo by Florian Wehde on Unsplash.\nThe Midwest includes Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana,\nWisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. It is a large region, and\nhas a large population\u2014it is home to 22% of the American population. See Chapter 29.\nThe Midwest is one of the world\u2019s most productive agricultural\nregions. In the early 1800s, thousands of small-scale family farms\nwere established from Ohio to Nebraska, in a region known as the\nCorn Belt. The dominant agricultural practice there has long been\nlivestock fattening. Corn, and later soybeans, were grown as a feed\ncrop for animals, which were exported to the cities of the\nMississippi valley. Although this region is still carpeted with corn\neach summer, its rural population has declined significantly as a\nresult of farm mechanization. During the 20th century, the Corn\nBelt\u2019s rural population declined by more than 80%.\nFurther west is the Wheat Belt of the Great Plains, where\nIowa. Photo by Kelcy Gatson on Unsplash. conditions are too dry for corn production. It is a very productive\nregion\u2014the yield of the annual wheat crop is more than twice the\ndomestic demand. The rest is exported to the global market.\nProduction is also highly mechanized, with much of the work done by migratory crews. As a result, population\ndensities in the Wheat Belt are extremely low. The combined population of North and South Dakota is just 1.4\nmillion\u2014smaller than that of metropolitan Milwaukee. 214 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe Midwest is also synonymous with manufacturing,\nparticularly in the large cities along the Great Lakes. Between the\n1870s and the 1970s, the Great Lakes Steel Belt emerged as one of\nthe world\u2019s most productive manufacturing regions. The lakes\nprovided an avenue for the cheap transport of bulky raw materials.\nIron ore was mined on northwestern end of the Great Lakes, while\ncoal was mined near the southeastern end. Coal and iron ore are\nthe two fundamental ingredients of steel, and this made the Great\nLakes an ideal setting for steel production. Steel was integral to the\nIndustrial Revolution, used in the production of rails, industrial and\nagricultural machinery, buildings, transportation equipment, and\nmuch more. Steel is expensive to ship, so it made sense to Hull-Rust-Mahoning Mine, Hibbing, Minnesota.\nmanufacture things made out of steel right next to the steel mills. Photo by James St. John on Flickr.\nAs a result, the Steel Belt became synonymous with American\nindustrial might.\nAlthough it contains numerous mid-sized metro areas, including\nDetroit, Minneapolis, Cleveland, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus,\nKansas City, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati, only one Midwestern\nmetro area ranks in the country\u2019s top ten. Chicago is the country\u2019s\nthird-largest metropolitan area. Located in an advantageous\nposition in the center of the Midwest, and on the most direct route\nbetween the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes, Chicago\nemerged in the late 1800s as the Midwest\u2019s undisputed economic\ncapital. It became a trade and marketing center for the Corn Belt.\nBy 1900, about half of all the animals slaughtered in the United\nStates met their demise in the Union Stockyards on Chicago\u2019s South\nSide. Chicago became a distribution point for the timber of the\nGreat Lakes, and a major steel producer. Its economy was red hot\nat about the same time that immigration to the United States was\npeaking, and as a result Chicago became the most ethnically\ndiverse city in the country. Today, Chicago remains the most\nimportant city in the U.S. interior. It is a major manufacturer, and\nan international center of trade, marketing, banking, and finance.\nChicago.

NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 215\nTThhee SSoouutthh\nThe South consists of Virginia, North Carolina (seen in the icon to the left), South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,\nMississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas. It is another large region, and contains\na large population. About 19% of Americans live in the South. The South consists of two distinct sub-regions\u2014the\nLowland South (or Deep South), which occupies the Piedmont and the Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain, and the Upland\nSouth, which occupies the Appalachians and Ozarks.\nSome of the first white settlers in the Lowland South were wealthy British immigrants who acquired enormous\nfarms known as plantations. Plantations featured the intensive production of a single luxury crop, usually tobacco\nor cotton. These farms were infamously associated with slavery, utilizing the forced labor of African Americans.\nThe slave plantation culture established three enduring traits in the Lowland South: a lack of ethnic diversity, a\nlack of major urban areas, and a lack of a significant middle class. As we\u2019ll discuss below, these traits have faded\nin recent decades, but have not disappeared altogether.\nFor years, most inhabitants of the Lowland South were descendants of British settlers, or of African slaves. Until\nrecently, the region attracted very few immigrants from other places. The lack of available farmland, the lack of\nmanufacturing jobs, and the lack of major ports and railroads made the region unattractive to immigrants, as did\nthe social climate.\nThe wealthy land-owning classes of the region simply imported their manufactured goods from elsewhere, and\nhad little incentive to invest in new economic enterprises like factories. The rest of the region\u2019s population was\nrelatively poor, so they had no money to invest or spend. This lack of manufacturing and commercial activity\nstunted the growth of Southern cities.\nPerhaps the most distinctive trait of the Lowland South was its lack of a significant middle class, an unusual\ntrait in the United States. The plantation economy produced a small, extraordinarily wealthy white ruling class, but\nmost of the region\u2019s white residents were poor subsistence framers eking out a living on marginal, unproductive\nland that had been passed over by the plantation owners. And, of course, most Black slaves were essentially\nmoneyless. After the Civil War, the poor white subsistence farmers remained poor. The wealthy landowners\nremained wealthy. Emancipated slaves, lacking other economic opportunities, became sharecroppers, and largely\nremained poor. 216 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe first white settlers to the Upland South arrived\nfrom Pennsylvania, flowing down the grain of the\nAppalachian valleys, then on to the hills of Kentucky\nand Tennessee, and eventually to the Ozarks. In this\nhilly country, these settlers developed an economy and\nculture very different from that of the Lowland South.\nMost of them did not own slaves, not because they\nwere necessarily opposed to slavery, but because the\nGreat Smoky Mountains, Tennessee. Photo by skeeze from poor soils and steep slopes made the land unsuitable\nPixabay. for large-scale commercial agriculture. The topography\nalso made transportation difficult, further limiting\neconomic opportunities. The Upland South became, and remains, a region of low population density, high rates of\npoverty, and few large cities.\nOne economic bright spot for the Upland South has been tourism. It is a poor region, but a beautiful one. In the\n1880s, with the Industrial Revolution in full roar, many wealthy city dwellers of the Midwest and Northeast were\nseeking refuge in nature, particularly in the summertime. Tourism accelerated in the 1900s as a number of rivers\nin the Upland South were damned to create enormous artificial lakes. Vacation homes, retirement communities,\nmarinas, and theme parks are now some of the most significant industries in the Upland South.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, many Southerners, anxious to leave the haunting legacies of slavery,\npoverty, segregation, and cultural isolation behind, began to speak of the evolution of a New South. The region\nhas, indeed, undergone many changes over the past several decades. In the 1960s, the region began to develop a\nmore diverse economy. Low wages and taxes made it an inviting place for businesses. NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 217\nThe region\u2019s warm climate attracted Sunbelt migrants. Some of\nthe most important changes resulted from the Civil Rights\nmovement, which led to an improved social climate. In the 1980s,\nfor the first time since Emancipation, more African-Americans were\nmoving to the South than were leaving it. Compared to the\nNortheast and Midwest, it is still a region of relatively few large\nmetropolitan areas, although Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Nashville\nand, in particular, Atlanta, have experienced explosive growth in\nrecent years.\nTThhee IInntteerriioorr WWeesstt\nThe Interior West includes Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana,\nNevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Outside of Alaska, it is\nthe most sparsely populated area of the United States.

Beginning in the\n1940s, the population of the region began to grow, and the\neconomy expanded. The region has a large military presence, and\nas the military expanded exponentially during World War II and the\nCold War, the economy of the Interior West expanded with it.\nTourism also boomed in the second half of the 20th century, with\nscores of tourists attracted to the region\u2019s national parks and ski\nresorts, and to the desert playgrounds of Reno and Las Vegas,\nNevada.

Both of these states were\nsettled by non-Native Americans relatively late. Texas was originally\npart of Mexico, and its distance from Mexico\u2019s population and\neconomic cores limited economic opportunity there. Throughout\nmuch of the 1800s, Oklahoma was reserved for Native Americans.\nIn the 1820s, a newly independent Mexico opened Texas to\nsettlement from the United States. In 1836, Texas achieved\nindependence from Mexico. It would join the U.S. in 1845.\nOklahoma was opened to white settlement in 1889, and became a\nDouble rainbow and Texas sign. Photo by Alan state in 1907.\nBerning. Through the first half of the 20th century, the economies of both\nstates were based primarily on raw materials, particularly\nagriculture and the oil and gas industries, and their cities were relatively small. Beginning in the 1960s, Texas\nbegan to boom. The Dallas and Houston metro areas now rank among the United States\u2019 ten largest. San Antonio\nand Austin are smaller, but their populations have also expanded rapidly. Texas\u2019s economic boom resulted from\na dramatic increase in trade with Mexico, a growing energy industry, the rapid expansion of high-tech industries,\nand Sunbelt migration. Oklahoma\u2019s growth has been more modest. Its largest metropolitan area is Oklahoma City,\nst\nwhich ranks 41 nationally.\nTThhee WWeesstt CCooaasstt\nCalifornia, Oregon (seen in the icon to the left), and Washington make up the West Coast states, which contain\n15% of the country\u2019s population. White settlement in Oregon and Washington, an area often referred to as\nthe \u201cPacific Northwest,\u201d began relatively early, in the 1840s with the Oregon Rush. Farmers from the east were\nattracted to the region\u2019s climate, which features mild winters and plentiful rainfall. Eventually, the timber industry\ncame to dominate the rural economy of the Pacific Northwest.\nCalifornia began to grow rapidly at about the same time. In 1848, control of California was transferred from\nMexico to the United States, just as gold was discovered in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The following year,\nthousands of \u201849ers\u2014Americans hoping to make their fortune in the gold rush\u2014poured into California. Some NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 219\nmade the trek overland, but most arrived by sea, and San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate became the major point of\nentry.\nCalifornia\u2019s economy subsequently focused on agriculture in the Central Valley. Farming there was initially\nlimited by physical geography. As snow in the Sierras melted each spring, vast sections of the valley would flood.\nThen, in the summer, when the flood waters receded, there would be no rain for weeks at a time. Beginning\nin the 1900s, massive private, local, state, and federal water projects transformed the landscape. Dams were\nbuilt to trap spring snowmelt, and the water was doled out via thousands of miles of canals during the dry\nsummers. Agriculture rapidly expanded throughout the valley and, by the 1930s, California was the country\u2019s\nleading agricultural producer.\nThe West Coast is now home to numerous large cities, including the huge metropolitan areas of Los Angeles,\nSan Francisco, and Seattle, and the mid-sized metros of Sacramento, Portland, and San Diego. As discussed in\nChapter 32, the region\u2019s three largest cities benefited from the arrival of railroads which linked the Pacific to the\neastern United States.\nAnother transformative event was World War II. After Japan attacked the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor in 1941, the\nensuing war increased the flow of materials through West Coast ports, and the federal government rushed to\nestablish a military and industrial presence along the Pacific. The West Coast\u2019s naval bases were expanded, and\nthe aircraft and defense industries thrived. After the war, increased trade with Asia further expanded the West\nCoast\u2019s industrial base.\nBut perhaps the most important factor in the West Coast\u2019s population boom was Sunbelt migration. For\na century, people have been attracted to the mild climates along the Pacific, particularly those of southern\nCalifornia. In the 1960s, California became the most populous state. In the 1980s, Los Angeles passed Chicago to\nbecome the country\u2019s second largest metro area. Today, nearly one in eight Americans lives in California.\nFFlloorriiddaa\nOver the course of the last century, Florida has transformed from an isolated, sparsely-populated backwater\ninto the country\u2019s third most populous state. Today, 6% of the Americans live there. The United States purchased\nFlorida from Spain in 1819. When it became a state in 1845, it had a population of just 70,000. Northern Florida\nbecame an extension of the Lowland South\u2019s slave plantation culture, and northern Florida remains the most\n\u201cSouthern\u201d part of Florida. Swampy peninsular Florida would remain sparsely populated for decades. 220 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn the 1920s, Florida\u2019s economy began to boom with the emergence of the tourism industry. It also became a\nretirement haven for Americans. Today, nearly 20% of the state\u2019s population is over sixty-five. Overall, few states\nexemplify Sunbelt migration quite like Florida. From 1920 to 2000, the state\u2019s population doubled every twenty\nyears. Three of its metropolitan areas\u2014Tampa, Miami, and Orlando\u2014now rank among the country\u2019s twenty\nlargest.\nAAllaasskkaa aanndd HHaawwaaiiii\nHawaii is small, and thus has a relatively small population. Alaska is enormous, by far the largest state in the\ncountry, but it is very sparsely populated. Collectively, the two states account for less than 1% of the country\u2019s\npopulation. Both achieved statehood in 1959. Hawaii\u2019s economy largely revolves around the military, tourism, and\nagriculture. Alaska\u2019s economy is dominated by raw materials extraction, such as oil and gas, mining, fishing, and\ntimber.\nHISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nCanada\u2019s indigenous population, the First Nations, arrived on the\ncontinent about 15,000 years ago. In the 1500s, the first English colonies were established in Atlantic Canada. In\nthe 1600s, French settlers moved into the St. Lawrence valley, and more English settlements were established\nnorth of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. In the 1700s, France ceded control of its Canadian territories to the British.\nIn the 1840s, all of the European settlements of Canada were unified into a single British colony. At about\nthe same time, the Oregon Treaty with the United States established Canada\u2019s southwestern border, increasing\nwhite settlement in the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia. Canada was granted home rule in 1867, and\nofficially gained full independence in 1931, although the British monarch remains the symbolic head of state.\nNewfoundland would remain a British colony until joining Canada in 1949.

English has long been the majority language of the United States, and 82% of Americans speak it as their\nfirst language. Spanish is the second most prominent language in the U.S., with 11% of Americans speaking it\nas their first language. All other languages account for 7% of Americans\u2019 first languages, with Chinese languages,\nTagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, French, and Korean being particularly prominent among them.\nEEtthhnniicciittyy\nThe original inhabitants of what is now the United States were a diverse group of peoples commonly referred to\nas Native Americans. After the 1600s, this indigenous population was decimated by warfare, displacement, and\ndisease, and they were overwhelmed by immigrants from the Old World. From the 1600s through the mid-1800s,\nthese immigrants largely came from northern and central Europe, and also from Africa\u2014involuntary migrants\nwho arrived in North America via the slave trade. From the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, the largest stream NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 223\nof immigrants was still from Europe, although now primarily from Europe\u2019s east and south. Since the mid-1900s,\nimmigrants have primarily arrived from Latin America and Asia.\nEvery ten years, the United States Census Bureau collects racial data on American citizens, and the four most\nprominent racial groups are white\/Caucasian, Black\/African-American, Asian, and Native American. Additionally,\nthe census asks respondents of all races if they identify as Hispanic (or Latino\/Latina). As of the 2010 census, 66%\nof Americans identify as white and Non-Hispanic. The largest minority populations are Hispanic (15%), Black (12%),\nAsian (4%), and Native American (1%). About 2% of Americans identify as multi-racial.\nThe ten most common places of ancestral origin for Americans are Germany (15%), Africa (12%), Ireland (11%),\nEngland (9%), Scotland (8%), Mexico (7%), Italy (6%), Poland (3%), France (3%), and Scandinavia (3%).\nRReelliiggiioonn\nFor a detailed discussion of religion in the United States, see Chapters 30 and 38.\nCULTURAL GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nLike the United States, Canada was long inhabited by diverse groups of indigenous peoples, known as the First\nNations in Canada. Eventually these groups were displaced by immigrants from Europe, mainly from the British\nIsles and France. Today, about two-thirds of Canadians trace their ancestry to those two places. Most of the\nremaining third of Canada\u2019s population trace their ancestry to other European countries, to the First Nations or,\nincreasingly, to Asia and Africa.\nThe language patterns of Canada reflect its ethnic patterns. About 57% of Canadians speak English as their\nfirst language, while 21% speak French as their first language. A myriad of other languages\u2014prominently Punjabi,\nSpanish, Tagalog, Arabic, German, Italian, Hindi, Urdu, and the languages of China\u2014account for the first languages\nof 22% of Canadians.\nChristians account for 67% of Canada\u2019s population, with the most prominent groups being Roman Catholic\n(39%), Protestant (24%), and Eastern Orthodox (2%). Other prominent religious groups include Muslims (3%),\nHindus (2%), Sikhs (1%), Buddhists (1%), and Jews (1%).\nPOPULATION GEOGRAPHY: THE UNITED STATES\nSix major trends have defined the population geography of the United States over the course of its history:\nwestward migration, rural-to-urban migration, declining population growth, an aging population, Sunbelt\nmigration, and immigration.\nThe westward drift of American population can be seen in the movement of the country\u2019s mean center of\npopulation. If a meridian of longitude is drawn through the population center, about half of the country lives east\nof that line, and about half west of it. (Likewise, if a parallel of latitude is drawn through this point, about half of\nthe country lives north of it, and half south of it.) In 1790, the population center was in Maryland, near Chesapeake\nBay, a strong indicator of how close to the Atlantic most Americans lived. Over the course of the 19th century, the\npopulation center would drift west into Virginia, then on to Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. By 1950, the population\ncenter was in Illinois. In 1980, the population center crossed the Mississippi River for the first time. It is currently\nlocated near Plato, Missouri, a small town in the south-central part of the state.\nAnother great historic shift in American demographics has been rural-to-urban migration. In 1800, just 6% of 224 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAmericans lived in cities. By 1850, that number had inched up to 15%. In 1900, it was 40%. It wasn\u2019t until 1920\nthat the U.S. census revealed, for the first time, that a majority of Americans, 51%, lived in cities. That number\nhas climbed steadily over the last century. As of 2010, the United States was 81% urban. This rural-to-urban shift\nwas caused by the Industrial Revolution, when machinery replaced much of the human labor on farms, and when\nmore factory workers were needed in cities. The United States has become not only more urban, but also more\nmetropolitan, with large metro areas accounting for an increasing share of the country\u2019s population. As of 2010,\nthere were twenty-nine American metropolitan areas with at least 2 million people, and they collectively accounted\nfor 44% of the country\u2019s population.\nThe United States\u2019 population is about 328 million, making it the third most populous country on earth, albeit\na distant third to China and India. The population continues to grow, but at a decreasing rate. Between 1800 and\n1810, the country\u2019s population grew by a remarkable 38%. Between 1900 and 1910, it grew by 21%. Between 2000\nand 2010, the growth rate was just 10%. Much of this has to do with a decline in birth rates. The United States\u2019\ntotal fertility rate (TFR) is 1.9, below the replacement rate of 2.1. As a result, the United States increasingly relies\non immigration to sustain population growth.\nAmericans are having fewer children, and they are also living longer. This has led to an aging population. In\n1900, just one in twenty-five Americans were at least sixty-five years old. By 2000, one in eight were. By 2050, it\u2019s\nestimated that one in five Americans will be senior citizens.\nTwo other major population trends include Sunbelt migration, which is discussed as part of Chapter 31, and\nimmigration, which is discussed in Chapter 35.\nPOPULATION GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nCanada\u2019s population is about 38 million, which is slightly smaller than California, and about one-ninth that of the\nUnited States. Like the U.S., Canada is experiencing declining birth rates and an aging population. Canada\u2019s TFR is\njust 1.6, but population stagnation has been offset by high rates of immigration. Canada is highly urbanized, with\n80% of its population living in cities. It is also highly metropolitanized. Canada\u2019s six largest metro areas account for\nmore than 43% of the country\u2019s population, including Toronto (5.9 million), Montreal (4.1 million), Vancouver (2.5\nmillion), Calgary (1.4), Ottawa (1.3 million), and Edmonton (1.3 million).\nCanada\u2019s population distribution has been\ncompared to that of an island nation, with densely\nsettled regions interrupted by vast areas that are\nsparsely populated. The highest population densities\nare found in a corridor that stretches along the\nnorthern shores of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St.\nLawrence River. Much of the population lives within\n200 miles of the U.S. border. Ontario is the most\npopulous province, accounting for 38% of Canada\u2019s\npopulation, followed by Quebec, at 24%. The Prairie\nProvinces collectively contain 18% of Canadians, while\nBritish Columbia is home to 13%. Atlantic Canada\naccounts for less than 7%.\nToronto, Ontario, Canada.

Theoretically, the federal government in Washington,\nD.C., only holds authority over the states in matters granted to it by the constitution. Exactly how far that authority\nextends has long been a point of contention in the U.S.\nThe federal government is made up of three branches: the judicial branch, the legislative branch, and the\nexecutive branch. The judicial branch is charged with interpreting laws and hearing legal cases, with the highest\ncourt being the Supreme Court. There are ninety-four federal court districts, which are organized into twelve\nregional circuits. Beyond that, there is little geography to the judicial branch. Theoretically, all nine Supreme Court\njustices could be from the same state.\nThere is, on the other hand, a good deal of geography associated with the legislative branch, which is charged\nwith making laws and shaping federal policy. The United States Congress is divided into two houses \u2013 the Senate\nand the House of Representatives. The Senate has a relatively simple configuration. There are 100 senators. Each\nof the fifty states is represented by two senators, regardless of its population size. This means that sparsely\npopulated states wield outsized influence in the Senate.\nThe House of Representatives is made up of 435 members, representing 435 separate districts. The makeup\nin the House is based on population size, with larger states having the most representatives, such as California\n(53), Texas (36), Florida (27), and New York (27). Every state is guaranteed at least one representative, and seven\nstates\u2014Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Delaware\u2014have the minimum\nof one representative. Every ten years the United States conducts a census, and congressional seats are\nreapportioned based on relative population growth. States experiencing slow population growth often lose seats\nin the House. States experiencing rapid population growth are likely to gain seats.\nEach House district is a single-representative, equal-population district. That means that each state is carved\nup into districts of equal population, and that residents of each district elect one representative. Illinois, for\nexample, has eighteen representatives in the House, so Illinois is divided into eighteen districts, each electing one\nrepresentative, and each containing roughly one eighteenth of the state\u2019s population.\nBecause some parts of a state may grow faster than others, each state (except those with only one district)\nmust engage in redistricting after each census, to be sure that each district contains a relatively equal share of\nthe state\u2019s population. The process is made more complicated when a state gains or loses a seat as a result of\nreapportionment.\nThe boundaries of the House districts often follow unusual, serpentine lines. This is because the boundaries\nare determined by the state governments, and the majority parties in those states often engage in a controversial\npractice known as gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing House boundaries so that the 226 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nmajority party has an advantage over the minority party. The two primary methods of gerrymandering are known\nas \u201cpacking\u201d and \u201ccracking.\u201d Packing involves cramming most of the voters from the minority party into one or\ntwo districts, conceding those districts to the minority party, but guaranteeing wins for the majority party in all\nthe other districts. Cracking involves running as many districts as possible into minority party strongholds, thus\ncracking up those strongholds, and denying the minority party any representation in the House.\nThe executive branch is charged with enforcing laws and carrying out the policies of the federal government.\nThe head of the executive branch is the president, who largely shapes the make-up of the branch. For a discussion\nof presidential elections, see Chapter 42.\nPOLITICAL GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nCanada is a constitutional monarchy. Its official head of state is the British monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth\nII. Legislative power rests with the parliament, which is made up of two bodies\u2014the Senate and the House of\nCommons. The monarchy and the Senate are largely symbolic. Real constitutional power resides with the House\nof Commons, which is made up of 338 members. They are elected in single-representative, equal-population\ndistricts, commonly referred to as \u201cridings.\u201d Any party, or coalition of parties, that forms a majority in the House of\nCommons then selects the executive officers of the federal government in Ottawa, including the prime minister,\nwho is the chief executive. Like the United States, Canada employs a federal system, in which Canada\u2019s ten\nprovinces enjoy considerable autonomy.\nECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY: THE UNITED STATES\nThe United States possesses the world\u2019s largest economy. It is home to 4.5% of the world\u2019s population, but controls\n23% of its wealth. It has a high overall standard of living, ranking fifteenth among the world\u2019s countries, according\nto the Human Development Index.\nThe U.S. economy has moved through three historic phases. In the first phase, which lasted from the 1600s\nto the late 1800s, the economy was largely focused on the primary sector, mainly agriculture. During the second\nphase, which lasted from the late 1800s to around the 1970s, the American economy was largely focused on\nthe secondary sector, manufacturing. Since the 1970s, the economy has increasingly focused on the tertiary\nand quaternary sectors, services and information. Here, we\u2019ll take a brief look at American agriculture and\nmanufacturing. The tertiary and quaternary sectors are covered in Chapter 31.\nAAggrriiccuullttuurree\nAgriculture was once the dominant force in American economics and society. Outside of the plantation south,\nmost agricultural production took place on small family farms, and farming was by far the most common\noccupation in the country. Today, American agriculture remains very productive, and important to the domestic\neconomy. The U.S. is world\u2019s leading agricultural exporter by a wide margin, and the tremendous level of\nagricultural production keeps food exceptionally cheap for Americans, allowing them to spend money on other\nthings, which aids other sectors of the economy. But agriculture\u2019s labor base has been shrinking for years. In 1900,\n40% of the American workforce were farmers. Today, fewer than 2% are.\nFor years, outside of the plantation South, most American agriculture was dominated by small-scale family\nfarms. Profits for small family farms peaked from the 1940s through the 1960s. Rural-to-urban migration had NORTH AMERICA: OVERVIEW 227\ndecreased the number of farmers, but mechanization had enabled farmers to produce more with less labor. At the\nsame time, the worldwide demand for American agricultural products skyrocketed as a result of global conflicts\nand the population explosion. Things could not have gone much better for America\u2019s small family farms during\nthose three decades. Unfortunately, in the following three decades, things couldn\u2019t have gone much worse.\nIn the 1970s, the global market began to shrink as the Green Revolution reached the developing world\u2014 a lot\nof countries that had been very reliant on America\u2019s farmers were becoming more agriculturally self-sufficient. At\nthe same time, American farmers were overproducing, and prices for their products began to collapse. Finally, the\ncost of farming\u2014that of modern machinery, chemicals, and fuel\u2014began to surge. By the 1980s, millions of small\nfamily farms had become unprofitable. Many farm families defaulted on their loans and lost their land. Many of\nthe small-scale farmers who survived were forced to engage in off-farm work to stay afloat financially. Over the\nlast four decades, American agriculture has seen a good deal of consolidation and corporatization. Increasingly,\nAmerican farmland is owned by corporations or wealthy individuals, and much of the work is done by migratory\ncrews. Still, some small farms have hung on\u2014there are still more than 2 million family farms in the United States.\nMMaannuuffaaccttuurriinngg\nIn the late 1800s, the United States emerged as the world\u2019s leading manufacturer. Manufacturing output peaked\nin the middle of the 20th century. The United States remains one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers, second\nonly to China in total industrial output. Since the 1970s, however, the percentage of Americans working in\nmanufacturing has declined significantly. In 1959, 28% of the American labor force worked in factories. Fifty years\nlater, that number had dropped to 8%. The decline in American manufacturing employment was driven partly by\nthe resurgence of major industrial competitors, like Germany and Japan, but primarily by the oil crisis of the early\n1970s. As the cost of energy spiked and world markets slid into recession, American manufacturers searched for\nways to cut expenditures, and one of the easiest ways to do that was to reduce labor costs. Manufacturers found\nways to automate jobs that had previously been performed by humans. Other jobs were outsourced to countries\nin the developing world. The jobs most likely to be outsourced were those in \u201clow-tech\u201d industries, such as textiles,\ntoys, and the final assembly of cars and appliances.\nToday, American manufacturing jobs are increasingly focused on \u201chigh-tech\u201d industries, such as heavy\nequipment, aircraft, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. American manufacturing is also increasingly focused on\nthe production of components (auto parts, computer chips, circuits, etc.), rather than on the final assembly of\nproducts, which tends to be more labor intensive. 228 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY: CANADA\nCanada possesses the world\u2019s fifteenth largest economy, and boasts one of the world\u2019s highest standards of living,\nranking thirteenth globally according to the Human Development Index, just ahead of the United States.\nCanada has an economic history similar to that of the U.S. Its economy initially focused on primary sector\nactivities, like farming, fishing, timber, and mining. Like the U.S., employment in these activities has declined\nover time, although the export of raw materials remains vital to Canada\u2019s economy. Canada is a significant\nmanufacturer, with much of the production taking place in southern Ontario, which is an extension of the\nMidwest\u2019s Steel Belt. Also like the U.S., Canada\u2019s job market is increasingly focused on the tertiary and quaternary\nsectors.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\na.canvas.of.light. 2017.

CHAPTER 46\nEurope\nHow do we define this region?\n\u201cGeography is an earthly subject, but a heavenly science.\u201d\n\u2022 Edmund Burke, Irish statesman and philosopher\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive region. A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared elements over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nIn some cases, the determination of a geographic region is simple. For Europe, quite a bit of the decision-making\nis accomplished simply by noting where the land ends and meets large bodies of water.\nAs we understood with our definition of the Western World, nearly all of Europe\u2019s countries meet the three\nnoted criteria \u2013 contiguity, Christianity, and Indo-European language. Much is Europe\u2019s landscape is distinctive by\nthe frequent pattern of islands, peninsulas, and mountains. In fact, how many European countries lack all three\n229 230 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nof these physical landforms? I count these (excluding micro states) \u2013 Lithuania, Belgium, Luxembourg, Bulgaria,\nMoldova.\nHistorians will recount certain patterns of shared experiences among European countries. Some elements of\nthis history will explain how Europe has the world\u2019s predominant share of nation-States.\nFundamentally though, there are some clear limitations of physical geography on what can be called Europe.\nTo the west, there is the clear boundary of the Atlantic Ocean. The only worthwhile questions for westward\ninclusion in Europe are the islands of Iceland and Greenland. Iceland has obvious cultural links with much of\nNorthern Europe; in fact, we count Iceland in Scandinavia. Greenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark and\nthus arguably belongs in Europe. Greenland\u2019s landmass is physically part of the North American continent, but\ngenerally has been considered part of Europe. Or, frankly, sometimes Greenland simply is ignored.\nTo the north, there is the Arctic Ocean. In this direction, the European landmass terminates with the northern\nreach of Norway. Additionally, Norway owns the islands of Svalbard, farther north.\nTo the south, there is the Mediterranean Sea. Clearly, there is Europe on one side and Africa on the other. What\nabout the islands of the Mediterranean? European countries have long owned most of these islands \u2013 Balearic\n(Spain), Corsica (France), Sardinia and Sicily (Italy), Crete and many (Greece). Cyprus is effectively partitioned with a\nTurkish north, but is a member of the European Union. Malta is an independent country with a mix of ethnicities,\nbut also is a member of the European Union.\nThe eastern edge of Europe is the controversial side. As you will learn in the reading on the Russian Domain,\nthis textbook argues that Russia belongs either as its own region or as a slightly larger region adding Ukraine,\nBelarus, Armenia, Georgia, and possibly Moldova. Thus, Europe ends in the east with the wall of Slavic countries\n\u2013 Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.\nSome may ask if Turkey could be a southern or eastern member of Europe. Indeed, Turkey has expressed\ninterest in joining the European Union, though that inclusion is nowhere near imminent. Perhaps reluctantly,\ngeographers would understand that Turkey belonging to the European Union would qualify Turkey as in Europe.\nIn the meantime, however, Turkey belongs in the Middle East (or Southwest Asia). Although Turkey practices a\nvery secular approach to Islam, its religious affiliation matches the dominant religion of the Middle East and not\nthat of Europe. The Turkish language is not an Indo-European language, but falls in the Turkic language family,\nlike several languages in Central Asia. A small portion of Turkey\u2019s landmass lies across the Bosporus Strait and\nthus shares land borders with Greece and Bulgaria. Even so, the vast majority of Turkey\u2019s land is to the east and\nhistorically has been considered part of Asia.\nGiven these exclusions of Turkey and of the Russian Domain from Europe, this means that the Black Sea serves\nas a major water border for part of Southern Europe and part of Eastern Europe.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nSpain does have two urban exclaves \u2013 Ceuta and Melilla \u2013 that are on the African coastline, otherwise within the country Morocco. Spain\u2019s\nCanary Islands are 62 miles west of the southern shores of Morocco. With Spanish colonial history and control, these islands are counted as\npart of Europe.\nThe Faroe Islands are roughly triangulated \u2013 east of Iceland, north of Scotland, and west of Norway. Like Greenland, these islands are an\nautonomous territory of Denmark. They are always considered as within Europe, though oddly they are not counted in the European Union.\nThe nine islands of the Azores rest in the Atlantic Ocean, 850 miles west of Portugal. As an autonomous region of Portugal, the Azores also\nare in Europe.\nMayotte is a French island in the Indian Ocean. As such it has status as an outermost region (OMR) of the European Union, but is not part\nof Europe. There are several other similar cases. France\u2019s New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean counts in the category overseas countries and\nterritories (OCT), similarly giving it rights in the European Union, but not making it part of Europe. Here too there are several other cases,\nincluding the former Netherlands Antilles. CHAPTER 47\nEurope: Regional Example\nScandinavia\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive region. A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared characteristics over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nIn Europe, Scandinavia is one of the sub-regions. Its definition also follows the methodology of regional\ngeography. It turns out that this is a complicated question.\nIdeally, Scandinavia is a region defined by ethnicity and language, key elements of Cultural Geography. If so,\nthen Scandinavia is not simply the same as Northern Europe or the Nordic countries, while it is related somewhat\nby location or proximity.\n231 232 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn terms of shared language patterns and roots in the northern part of Europe, only four countries are linked\n\u2013 Iceland, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway \u2013 as shown in outline maps from top to bottom in this chapter. In the\nIndo-European language family, there are dozens of languages. Some are languages currently spoken by millions\nof people, some by only hundreds of people. Some are dead languages. One branch of the tree of languages goes\nlike this \u2013 Indo-European \u00bb Germanic \u00bb Old Norse \u00bb Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, and Faroese. (Faroese\nis spoken primarily on the Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory of Denmark. The Faroe Islands could be listed\nas an additional piece of Scandinavia or its inclusion could be assumed as part of Denmark. Greenland too is an\nautonomous territory of Denmark. Both the Faroe Islands and Greenland will be assumed as part of Denmark in\nthis essay.) EUROPE: REGIONAL EXAMPLE 233\nThe very much smaller and entirely separate Uralic language\nfamily has only a few languages in it. The Uralic family includes the\nFinno-Ugric family plus Samoyedic languages of some of the\nnumerically small peoples of Siberia. The Finno-Ugric family\ncontains Finnish, Estonian, Hungarian, and scattered languages\nsuch as Sami.\nLanguages in Scandinavia.\nCartography by Steve Wiertz.\nThus, the Indo-European and Uralic language families are\nmutually exclusive. Norwegians cannot naturally understand\nFinnish language, but must learn it as an entirely unrelated language. Estonians cannot naturally understand\nDanish, but must learn it as an entirely unrelated language. Since a shared or similar language is a core element\nof any geographic region, in northern parts of Europe this language mismatch among these peoples works against\nincluding Finland and Estonia in Scandinavia.\nHistorically, there are very significant links between Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. For most of the\nyears from 1397 to 1523, these joined together in the Kalmar Union, joint governance under a single ruler.\nDenmark and Norway were together from 1537 to 1814., Sweden and Norway 1814-1905. It is true that Finland\nwas considered part of the Swedish realm until 1809, but then Finland was taken by Russia, thus further distant\nculturally from Scandinavia.\nThe term Norseman historically refers to those from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Attacking Norseman, also\nknown as Vikings, raided and expanded into Europe. These Vikings also explored westward, reaching Iceland,\nGreenland, and Vinland (North America), thus extended their language and culture in that direction. 234 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn terms of physical geography, Scandinavia can refer to the same named peninsula. This clearly includes\nNorway and Sweden, but what part of Finland is there remains vague. The Scandinavian Mountains (or\nScandinavian Highlands) extend along the shared border of Norway and Sweden, perhaps touching Finland at the\nmargins.\nIt seems best to assert that Finland is in Northern Europe, but not in Scandinavia. From Finland, Estonia sits a\nshort distance across the Gulf of Finland. Because Estonians are closely related to Finns and because Estonia for\nover a quarter century has been independent of the former Soviet Union, Estonia now should be counted as part\nof Northern Europe as well, not in Eastern Europe.\nArguably, the linguistic, historical, and physical patterns of these\nnorthern sections of Europe best place Norway, Sweden, Denmark,\nand Iceland together as the sub-region known as Scandinavia. Add\nFinland and Estonia to this set of countries to delineate the region\nof Northern Europe. The Nordic countries would be another term\nfor Northern Europe.\nPart of the fun of Geography is the challenge of making pieces of\nthe world fit together as regions, thereby allowing people to view\nthe world in cohesive ways.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThis is Scandinavia. Norway has more land than pictured above. Svalbard is a set of islands that lies\nmuch farther north than the northern edge of continental Norway. Perhaps we\nshould show it.\nRecall from Chapter 23 that New Zealand has physical landscape features like those of Iceland and Norway. Watch for this in the Chapter 58\nabout Iceland.

CHAPTER 48\nEurope: Cultural Geography I\nReligion in Europe\nCHRISTIANITY\nArmenia is the world\u2019s oldest Christian nation, but it was the\nth\nChristianization of the Roman Empire that would be the decisive moment for the religion. In the 4 century, the\nRoman Emperor Constantine legalized Christianity, and later converted to it.\nIn Europe outside the Roman Empire, Christianity diffused down the socio-political hierarchy. Even after the\nfall of Rome, emperors, kings, and tsars recognized the political advantages of embracing what had become the\nregion\u2019s largest faith. So, the monarch would convert to Christianity. After that, all of his subjects were expected to\ndo the same.\nFor several centuries, Rome remained the center of European Christianity, and most of the region\u2019s Christians\nwere followers of the Roman Catholic Church. Today, the Roman Church is still the largest Christian group in\nEurope, and the largest in the world. Countries where Catholics have traditionally formed the majority include\nPoland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland,\nIreland, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Lithuania, and Malta.\nth\nA second major branch of Christianity emerged in the 11 century. Although Eastern Orthodox Christianity\ntraces its theological roots to early Catholicism, it emerged as a separate denomination in 1054 CE when a number\nof Christian nations in Eastern Europe broke from Roman authority. Its structure is somewhat different from\n236 EUROPE: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 237\nthe Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic Church throughout the world is still governed from Rome, and headed\nby the pope. While Eastern Orthodox Christians recognize the Archbishop of Constantinople (Istanbul) as the\nsymbolic head of their Church, the various national Eastern Orthodox Churches are largely governed separately.\nMost Eastern Orthodox nations possess their own branch of the Orthodox Church, including the Greek, Bulgarian,\nRomanian, Serbian, and Russian Orthodox Churches.\nThe third major branch of Christianity in Europe is Protestantism. The Protestant Reformation began in\n1521 CE, when a German theologian named Martin Luther leveled numerous criticisms at the Roman Catholic\nChurch. Luther himself was a devout Catholic, but he believed that the Roman Church had corrupted the true\nnature of Christianity, having strayed too far from scripture. His protests (hence the term \u201cProtestant\u201d) led to his\nexcommunication, and he and his followers founded a new movement that came to be known as Lutheranism.\nLutherans are now the largest religious group in northern Germany and Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Iceland,\nand Denmark). Another major Protestant reformer was John Calvin, and Calvinist churches (such as the Dutch\nReformed Church and Presbyterian Church) found significant numbers of followers in the Netherlands and\nScotland.\nAn unusual hybrid between Catholicism and Protestantism can be found in England. The Church of England (also\ncalled the Anglican, or Anglo-Catholic Church) had a rather unusual beginning. England had been a predominantly\nRoman Catholic country until 1534, when King Henry VIII rejected Roman papal authority, largely because the pope\nrefused to annul his marriage. Henry still considered himself Catholic, just not a Roman Catholic, and initially there\nwas little change in English Christianity (to this day, an Anglican mass would look very familiar to Roman Catholics).\nStill, Anglicans are generally regarded as Protestants, particular after Henry\u2019s son, Edward VI, began to embrace\nnumerous theological elements of the Protestant Reformation. That is why the Church of England officially regards\nitself as both Catholic and Reformed.\nNON-RELIGIOUS POPULATIONS\nOrganized religion has been declining in Europe in recent decades. In most countries, the majority of the\npopulation still have at least a nominal association with one religious denomination or another, although rates of\nregular participation in religious services are relatively low in Europe when compared to much of the rest of the\nworld. Still, non-religious populations are the majority in just three European countries: The Netherlands, Estonia,\nand the Czech Republic. In Europe as a whole, about one in four people identify as non-religious, although that\nvaries widely from country to country. For example, the Czech Republic and Poland are two traditionally Catholic\ncountries that neighbor one another. Today, 89% of Czechs are non-religious, while 86% of Poles remain Catholic.\nISLAM 238 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIslam arrived in Europe via Ottoman rule in the 1400s. At its height,\nthe Ottoman Empire (based in modern-day Turkey) controlled much of the Balkan and Greek peninsulas. While\nunder Ottoman rule, many Europeans converted to Islam. As a result, Muslims are today the largest religious\ngroup in Bosnia (50% Muslim), Albania (59%), and Kosovo (90%). Islam is also the fastest growing religion in\nEurope, largely as a result of immigration from Muslim countries in Africa and Asia. Today, there are sizable\nMuslim populations in Germany (5 million Muslims), France (5 million), Britain (3 million), and Italy (2 million).\nJUDAISM\nIn the first century CE, the Jewish homeland in Southwest Asia was under Roman rule. When the Jews\nunsuccessfully rebelled against them, the Romans exiled the Jews from their homeland \u2013 an event known as\nthe Diaspora. The Jews were scattered to all parts of the Roman Empire, but the densest concentration would\neventually be in Europe. In 1880, about 90% of the world\u2019s Jewish population was in Europe, with particularly dense\nconcentrations in countries like Poland and Russia. Around this time, Jewish migration to the Americas began to\naccelerate, primarily to large American cities like New York and Chicago.\nEven with significant emigration, about 60% of the world\u2019s Jewish population remained in Europe at the dawn of\nWorld War II in 1939. During the war, Jews who fell under the occupation of fascist governments, such as that of EUROPE: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 239\nNazi Germany, suffered horrific consequences. More than six million Jews died during the ensuing Holocaust as a\nresult of starvation, deprivation, slavery, or systematic murder in fascist concentration camps. By the end of the\nwar in 1945, 36% of the world\u2019s Jewish population had been killed, including nearly two-thirds of European Jews.\nAfter the war, most of Europe\u2019s remaining Jews migrated elsewhere, primarily to the United States or Israel. Today,\nonly about 7% of the world\u2019s Jewish population lives in Europe.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nChristianity diffused through the Roman Empire in an urban-hierarchical fashion. It was first embraced in major Roman cities, then smaller\ncities, then villages, and then eventually in rural areas. The Latin word for a rural area is pagus, and one who lived in a rural area was a pagan \u2013\nan antiquated term for a non-Christian. CHAPTER 49\nEurope: Economic Geography I\nNetherlands\nThe Netherlands is one of the smallest countries in the world by area, similar in size to New Jersey. By\npopulation, at over one thousand people per square mile, the Netherlands is Europe\u2019s most crowded country and\nthe fifth most crowded in the world, not counting micro-States such as Monaco nor islands nor city-States. Of\nnote, New Jersey is America\u2019s most crowded state.\nIn the world, there are two dozen tiny countries under one thousand square miles in area, but these are micro-\nStates, city-States, or island countries. Not counting those countries nor other island countries, the Netherlands\nth\nis the world\u2019s 26 smallest country. Anyway, it is a small place.\nth\nBy population, the Netherland is a bit over 17 million people, the 68 largest country in the world. So, not tiny,\nbut not a large population.\nGross domestic product for the Netherlands, when adjusted for living standards (PPP \u2013 purchasing power\nth\nparity) and measured by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), places it 28 best in the world. On the Human\nDevelopment Index (HDI), calculated by the United Nations, the Netherlands rises to be the 10th most developed\ncountry in the world.\nWhat about natural resources? In 1959, the vast Groningen gas field was discovered and now accounts for about\n240 EUROPE: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 241\n25% of the gas reserves of the whole European Union. However, other than this gas resource, the Netherlands\nhas no significant other energy or mineral resources.\nVery small area, modest population, almost no raw materials, but very highly established economically and\nsocially. Why? Well, certainly part of the success is due to its relative location in Western Europe, an elite place\nin the world. Even so, there may be something about the Dutch that has led to their distinctive success.\nThe answer is that the Netherlands is a very prosperous country due to international trade. Here are a few\nkey reasons why this works so well for the Netherlands. One, as noted above, its relative location is excellent.\nThe country is coastal, giving it access to ocean trade, but also is proximate neighbors to numerous other\nprosperous European countries. In particular, the Netherlands directly borders Germany, the country with the\nlargest economy in Europe. Germany is the Netherlands\u2019 number one trade partner. Additionally, the Netherlands\nis across the North Sea from Great Britain, borders Belgium, is a short distance from France. The rest of Europe,\na small continent, is not so far away either.\nTwo, the Netherlands has Europe\u2019s busiest port \u2013 Rotterdam.\nRotterdam is an excellent break-of-bulk location, where ocean-\ngoing ships can dock and offload their cargoes onto smaller vessels\non the Rhine River. Yes, Rotterdam is the mouth of the Rhine River,\nits exit point into the North Sea and thus the Atlantic Ocean.\nProducts shipped from anywhere in the world may be brought to\nRotterdam and then down the Rhine River into Germany to cities\nsuch as Bonn and Cologne. In addition, the Rhine-Main-Danube\nCanal that connected these three rivers in 1992 allows cargo to\ntravel much farther, in fact on the Danube all the way to the Black\nSea. The Danube River at times is an international border, while at\nErasmus Bridge \u2013 Rotterdam \u2013 Photo by Harold other times crosses such borders; distinctively, it does so more\nWijnholds on Unsplash than any other river in the world. This international access,\nincluding passing through national capitals (Bratislava, Vienna,\nBelgrade, Budapest), is a tremendous boon for trade in either\ndirection. According to NationMaster, the Netherlands has the 8thdensest road system in the world, thereby\noffering an alternative means of distribution to or from Rotterdam\u2019s port.\nThree, the Dutch have an extensive history of international trade. Certainly, we recognize that the British, the\nFrench, and the Spanish had noteworthy explorations, conquests, and colonies across the world. Often though,\nwe forget that the Dutch (and the Portuguese) also had similar broad geographic histories. The trade routes and\nrelationships established through a few centuries of international activity have been maintained to the present\nday.\nThus, the Netherlands has trade connections throughout the world, bringing a variety to goods into the country\nas imports, but some pass through the country on the Rhine system or through the Netherlands road and rail\nsystem. A variety of products are added to these imports for distribution throughout Europe. All of this then\nworks in the opposite direction for sending products out from Rotterdam to overseas markets.\nHow well do the Dutch do this? According to the Observatory for Economic Complexity (OEC), \u201cThe economy\nth\nof the Netherlands has an Economic Complexity Index (ECI) of 1.3 making it the 18 most complex country. The\nNetherlands exports 419 products with revealed comparative advantage (meaning that its share of global exports\nis larger than what would be expected from the size of its export economy and from the size of a product\u2019s global\nmarket).\u201d1In other words, the Netherlands does a great job at creating and enhancing products for export.\nFor a diagram from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) showing a complex pattern of import, export, and transit-\nthrough trade flows, go to this website. 242 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nhttps:\/\/www.cbs.nl\/en-gb\/news\/2015\/48\/more-than-half-of-international-transport-in-the-netherlands-either-\ntransit-trade-or-re-export\nFour, maintenance of all these trade relationships all across the world and with all sorts of countries and\ncultures comes naturally to the Dutch and their way of life. One key word describing the Dutch way of life is\ngedogen. This word means \u201ctolerance\u201d but is best construed to mean \u201cactive tolerance.\u201d The Dutch culture does\nnot simply look the other way at behaviors that might be considered different or odd in other cultures, but\nactively allows and accepts differences. Arguably, this permits the Dutch to get along with anyone anywhere, an\napproach that naturally would favor cooperative trade around the world. Probably the most noticed examples\nof gedogen or active tolerance in the Netherlands is the acknowledgement that while prostitution and drug use\nmight be considered problems and by some might be considered immoral, neither prostitution nor drug use will\ndisappear, so it is better to create a managed, regulated context where these activities can persist in a relatively\nsafe manner.\nOverall, how well does the Netherlands do in international trade? In exports it ranks #5 in the world, in imports\n#8 in world, with about \u00be of these flows happening in Europe. For an excellent visual depiction of export totals\nfrom around the world, go to https:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/mapped-worlds-largest-exporters-in-2018\/\nThe country is #2 in world in agricultural exports, only behind the United States, a vastly larger country. It is\n#1 in the world in the export of flowers and flower bulbs, but #2 in the world in exported tomatoes. The port of\nRotterdam physically is the largest in the world. All of this is rather amazing, given the country\u2019s rather modest\nsize both in population and in area.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nDon\u2019t forget that before it was New York, it was New Amsterdam.\nThere are two common errors that people make about the Netherlands. First, the ethnic group of the Netherlands is the Dutch. The people\nof Germany call themselves \u201cDeutsch.\u201d These two peoples \u2013 the Dutch and the Deutsch \u2013 are not the same. EUROPE: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 243\nSecond, Holland is only a part of the Netherlands, but not the whole country. There are\ntwelve provinces of the Netherlands (the name literally means \u201clow lands\u201d) = North Holland,\nSouth Holland, Zeeland, Friesland, and eight more. Given that Holland is the most famous\narea of the Netherlands, some Dutch say that Holland is the brand name for the\nNetherlands.\nNot necessarily related to trade, the\nother famous feature of the\nNetherlands is its amount of land that\nshould be under water. The Dutch\nhave done an amazing job of\nengineering to reclaim land from the\nsea, holding out the water with dams\nand dikes. This map shows where the\nsea would be without the engineering\nof recovered land.\nThis chapter is dedicated to my\nfriend and academic exchange\ncolleague Dick Van Schaik of\nRegions of the Netherlands.

CHAPTER 50\nEurope: Historical Geography I\nGeography of World War II\nWorld War II was an enormous and complex conflict. To read all of the books that have been written about the\nhistory of the war would require a lifetime. Here, we\u2019ll focus on the geography of the war.\nIn many ways, World War II was a sequel to World War I, with Britain and France once again squaring off against\nGermany. This time around, the two warring sides became known as the \u201cAllies\u201d and the \u201cAxis.\u201d The Axis consisted\nof most of Europe\u2019s fascist powers: Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. (Japan was another Axis\nmember, but that\u2019s a story for the Geography of the Eastern World). The Soviet Union was not formally part of the\nAxis, but did partner with Germany early in the war. The Axis also included Austria and Czechoslovakia, which had\nbeen annexed by Germany in 1938, and Albania, which had been annexed by Italy in the spring of 1939.\n244 EUROPE: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 245\nThe Allies initially consisted of those countries\nresisting fascist expansion, primarily Britain, France,\nand Poland. Many other countries would later be\ndrawn to the Allied side, notably the United States and\nSoviet Union. A few European countries managed to\nremain neutral throughout the war: Portugal, Spain,\nIreland, Sweden, and Switzerland. World War II was\ncaused by multiple factors, but the primary one was\nthe ambition of Germany\u2019s leader, Adolph Hitler, to\nextend fascist control over all of Europe, and perhaps\nthe world.\nHitler\u2019s primary geographic strategy was to avoid a\ntwo-front war. The map above shows the European\ncountries that were members of the \u201cAllies\u201d and\nEurope\u2019s Alliances in World War II. Cartography by Steve Banas.\n\u201cCentral Powers\u201d of World War I. The geography of\nthese alliances meant that the Central Powers were\nessentially fighting two wars at the same time, one in\nthe east, and one in the west. This two-front war had\ndoomed Germany and its allies. At the dawn of World\nWar II, Hitler firmly believed, with good reason, that no\nsingle country could defeat Germany on its own.\nGermany\u2019s first task was to secure the eastern front.\nIn September of 1939, Germany invaded Poland. Hitler\nhad made a secret pact with Joseph Stalin, the leader\nof the Soviet Union. It was an unusual partnership,\nconsidering that communism and fascism fall about as\nfar apart on the political spectrum as possible, but\nHitler was interested in defeating Poland, and Stalin\nassured him that he would not check German\nambitions. The Soviet Union was only interested in\nEurope\u2019s Alliances in World War I. Cartography by Steve Banas.\nretaking the territory it had lost in the wake of World\nWar I. So, Germany seized western Poland, while the\nSoviets invaded eastern Poland, along with Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Finland. With Hungary, Romania,\nBulgaria, and the Soviet Union as allies, defeating Poland would secure the eastern front. With little help from\nBritain and France, Poland was in no position to resist the invasion by both the Germans and Soviets, and fell\nwithin a month. 246 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBritain and France declared war on Germany in the fall of 1939, but very little happened over the winter. Many\nbegan to speak of the conflict as a \u201cphony war.\u201d That illusion was shattered in the spring of 1940, when Germany\nturned its attention to the western front. Germany crashed into France through the neutral countries of Belgium,\nthe Netherlands, and Luxembourg. France and Britain were unprepared for both the direction and the lightning\nspeed of the German advance. France fell in just forty-six days.\nFor much of the rest of the war, France was divided into three entities. The first was Occupied France, which was\ngoverned directly from Berlin. A second became known as \u201cVichy France.\u201d This was territory in southern France\nthat remained unoccupied when France surrendered. Governed out of the town of Vichy, this part of France was\nnominally independent, but was run by French generals who had agreed to partner with the Nazis, effectively\nmaking Vichy France a satellite state of Germany. A third element of France were the \u201cFree French.\u201d This force was\nled by Charles de Gaulle, a French general who had escaped, along with many other French officers and soldiers, to\nBritain. The Free French claimed to be the legitimate government of their country and, partnering with resistance\nfighters in France, would continue to battle the fascists throughout the war.\nGermany also invaded and conquered Norway and Denmark. This left Britain as the lone allied country on\nthe western Front. Hitler considered invading Britain, but deemed it too risky. Instead, German bombers began\nhammering British cities in massive night raids, while German U-boats (submarines) in the Atlantic began to\ncut Britain\u2019s vital supply lines from the rest of the world. Hitler fully expected to bomb and starve Britain into EUROPE: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 247\nsurrender within a matter of months. Over the next year, the Axis moved to secure the southern front, invading\nBritish colonies in North Africa in 1940, and invading and defeating Yugoslavia and Greece in the spring of 1941.\nThis left Britain as the only remaining Allied country. An Axis victory looked almost certain.\nIt was a very grim year for the Allies, but it also saw two significant turning points, both of which would ultimately\ndoom Hitler\u2019s ambitions. By the end of 1941, Germany found itself at war with the two countries that would later\nemerge as global superpowers \u2013 the United States and the Soviet Union.\nThree weeks after Greece\u2019s surrender, the Axis launched surprise attack on the Soviet Union. Looking back,\nwe now know that this was a disastrous decision. At the time, however, it was not an outlandish idea. In\n1941, few reasonable people believed that the Soviet Union could survive such an invasion. Even though it had\na substantially larger population than any other European country, it did not have the industrial or military\nfirepower equal to that of the Axis. Also, Germany had the element of surprise (legend has it that when initial\nreports of the invasion reached Stalin, he didn\u2019t believe them). And, of course, Russia had an enormous geographic\nliability \u2013 an 1,800-mile border made up of lowlands that offered little obstacle to the Axis invaders. A defeat of\nthe Soviet Union would eliminate any remaining threat on the eastern front, and its vast territory could serve as\na warehouse of raw materials to further the German war effort. It also offered access to the Pacific Ocean, which\nwas key to Hitler\u2019s goal of world domination.\nAnother major turning point of 1941 was Japan\u2019s surprise attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,\ndrawing the United States into the war. This would later spell doom for the Axis, but at the time, it seemed like an\nearly Christmas present for Hitler. The U.S. President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had been trying to drum up support\nfor Britain since 1939. But a large number of Americans were hesitant to get involved in the war in Europe. Now\nthat Japan had attacked the United States, Hitler believed that Americans would forget about Europe entirely, and\nturn all of their attention to the war in the Pacific.\nAgain, Hitler\u2019s primary goal was to avoid a two-front war. In that regard, 1943 proved to be a disastrous year.\nOn the western front, Germany was unable to bomb and starve Britain into surrender. Also, much to Hitler\u2019s\nchagrin, the United States did indeed get involved in the European war. American air crews were deployed to\nBritain. British bombers had been targeting Germany and its occupied territories during night raids for some time.\nNow, American bombers were arriving during the daytime. This \u201cround-the-clock\u201d bombing began to take its toll\non German transportation and industry, inhibiting its ability to wage war.\nMore troubling for Hitler, advances on the eastern front had stalled. Germany had dramatically underestimated\nthe resolve of the Soviets, who paid an enormous price for their resistance. The Soviet Union suffered 23 million\ndeaths during the war, about 5 million more than every other country in Europe combined. That fact, coupled with\nGerman military blunders, a pair of brutal Russian winters, and the fact that German fighter planes on the eastern\nfront had been recalled to defend against British and American bombers, would eventually doom the Axis on the\neastern front.\nFinally, another front \u2013 the southern front \u2013 opened in 1943. British, American, Canadian, and Free French forces 248 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nseized control of North Africa, and invaded Italy. Germany was forced to send a significant force to northern Italy\nto stall the Allied advance.\n1944 would bring a string of Allied advances. On the western front, Allied forces invaded France, beginning with\nthe famous \u201cD-Day\u201d landings in Normandy. On the eastern front, Soviet troops pushed the Axis out of the Soviet\nUnion, and began advancing into eastern Europe. On the southern front, Allied troops continued to advance north\nthrough Italy.\nThe war ended in 1945. Benito Mussolini, the fascist leader of Italy, was captured and executed on April 28,\n1945. Hitler committed suicide two days later. Germany formally surrendered on May 7th. The end of the war also\nmarked the end of the European era of global dominance. Europe\u2019s industrial infrastructure was in ruins, and its\nempires in Asia and Africa began to crumble. Europe found itself divided between governments loyal to the Soviet\nUnion, and those affiliated with the United States. The Cold War had begun.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe single deadliest battle of World War II was the Battle of Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. It lasted for five months and killed nearly 900,000\npeople. Germany lost the battle, a decisive turning point in the war.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nBanas, Steven. 2020a. \u201cEurope\u2019s Alliance in World War I.\u201d College of DuPage GIS class.

CHAPTER 51\nEurope: Physical Geography I\nPredominance of Coastline\nEurope has the most amazing amount of coastline in the world.\nSo, what creates coastline? For one thing, islands do. By definition, islands are surrounded by water and thus\n100% of an island\u2019s border is coastline.\nAccording to the Telegraph, there are many thousands of islands in Europe, including:\nBritish Isles \u2013 6806 islands\nNorway \u2013 more than fifty thousand islands\nFinland \u2013 almost 180 thousand islands\n1\nSweden \u2013 over 267 thousand islands\nHow large are these islands? Wikipedia lists about 500 islands in Europe of at least 50 square kilometers in\narea. This is quite a difference in total numbers of islands in Europe. Apparently, very many European islands are\nquite small.\nHow big does a bit of land surrounded by water have to be in order to count as an island? This is an intriguing\ngeographic question. Sometimes, Bishop Rock of the British Isles is considered the world\u2019s smallest island,\nbecause it has a lighthouse. The rock is less than 750 square meters in area. Its perimeter is approximately 125\n2\nmeters. Clearly, this rock with a lighthouse adds only a smidgen of area and of coastline to Europe\u2019s totals.\n249 250 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n3\nAccording to Eurostat, an island should meet these criteria :\n\u2022 have an area of at least one sq. km.;\n\u2022 be at least one kilometre from the continent;\n\u2022 have a permanent resident population of at least 50 people;\n\u2022 have no permanent link with the continent;\n\u2022 not house an EU capital.\nWhen considering the islands of Europe, Eurostat also did not include far distant colonial islands, such as French\nPolynesia. Doing the count in 2003, thus including the United Kingdom, Eurostat numbered 286 island territories\nin the European Union.\nSo, it is complicated, but by whatever means of counting, Europe does have a lot of islands, including some very\nprominent islands like Great Britain.\nWhat else creates coastline? Peninsulas. A peninsula is a piece of land the juts out into a body of water, so that\nthe peninsula is mostly surrounded by that water, except for its connection to a large landmass. A peninsula can\nbe a variety of irregular shapes, but could be approximated by a rectangle where one short side connects with the\nmainland.\nIn fact, let\u2019s do some geometry. The geometric shape that produces the least amount of coastline for a given\narea is the circle. Ironically, this means that many islands, being roughly circular, do not efficiently produce\ncoastline length given their area, while automatically having coastline given their identities as islands.\nIf a rectangle is used to approximate a peninsula, what shape of the rectangle yields the largest or smallest\ncoastline? Comparing a square to a rectangle of the same area, the rectangle always will have more perimeter or\nin our perspective, geographically more coastline. Look at quora.com for an interesting mathematical explanation\n4\nof this. Can you see this in the shapes above? Shown here, the square and the rectangle have the same area.\nThe perimeter of the square equals the sum of the lengths of the two widths of the rectangle. Given that the\nrectangle also has the measure of its height on both sides, the rectangle has a longer perimeter. EUROPE: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 251\nIn fact, if maintaining the same area, then the longer the length and the shorter the width of the rectangle, the\ngreat its perimeter will become. As the length of the rectangle approaches infinity and the corresponding width\nof the rectangle approaches zero, the perimeter is maximized. Thus, for a peninsula to maximize its coastline, it\nshould maximize length and minimize width especially the width that connects to the mainland.\nEurope has numerous peninsulas. Some of these are very large. The Iberian Peninsula encompasses Spain and\nPortugal. Most of Italy is a peninsula. Norway and Sweden combine as a peninsula. Denmark is a smaller mix\nof peninsula and islands. The Balkan peninsula includes continental Greece and a bit of neighboring lands. More\nmodest in area, but noteworthy peninsulas include Brittany in France, North Holland in the Netherlands, and the\nCourland Peninsula of Latvia.\nTrace your finger around the borders of European countries and you will outline numerous islands and\npeninsulas. So, how well does Europe stack up globally on the coastline measure. It turns out that Europe is #1 on\nthis measure. How so? Well, it seems that the logical way of measuring the magnitude of coastline is to compare\ncoastline to area. Remember that circles provide the lowest coastline to area ratio and that among rectangles,\nsquares similarly have the lowest coastline to area ratio. This ought to be intuitive as well, for we can visually note\nthat compact shapes like circles and squares favor area over coastline.\nSo, our measure for ranking by coastline is the ratio of miles to square miles (or kilometers to square kilometers)\n2\nof area \u2013 miles:square miles (or km:km ). Probably the easiest numbers to examine are expressed as meters\n2 5\nof coastline per square kilometer of area \u2013 m:km . Using tabular data from Wikipedia , I have compiled and\ncalculated these ratios. It turns out that Europe is #1 among world regions in this measure, as shown in the table\nbelow. By the way, Southeast Asia, ranked #2, also is replete with islands and peninsulas.\nCOASTLINE IN METERS PER SQUARE METER\nRegion m\/km2\nEurope 27.8\nSoutheast Asia 23.6\nNorth America 12.2\nPacific Realm 8\nEast Asia 4.4\nLACAR 3\nNorth Africa and the Middle East 2.6\nRussian Domain 2.4\nSouth Asia 2.1\nSub-Saharan Africa 1.3\nCentral Asia 0\nNot counting countries that are only made up of islands, Denmark is the country with the highest coastline:area\n2 2\nratio at 172 m:km , while Norway (including the islands of Svalbard) is second at 167 m:km and Croatia is third at\n2\n112 m:km .\nWhat are the consequences of having so much coastline? Undoubtedly, there are many benefits and some\ncosts, but certainly there are at least advantages to trade and transportation (many ports), fishing (access to the\nsea), exploration (Europe led the world), and tourism (beaches and scenic views). People seeks these advantages. 252 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nNot surprisingly, in 2017 the United Nations reported that 40% of the world\u2019s population lived within 100 km of\nocean coastline.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nNote in the table above that the coastline:area ratio for Central Asia is zero. Every country of Central Asia is landlocked; that is, every country\nhas no ocean or sea coastline. Further note that three Central Asian countries border the Caspian Sea; nevertheless, this does not count, for\nthe Caspian Sea actually is a lake, not connecting to the ocean at all.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\nSmith, Oliver. 2018. \u201cThe Countries with the Most Islands (and the Idyllic Ones You Must Visit).\u201d The Telegraph.\nAugust 5, 2018. https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/travel\/lists\/countries-with-the-most-islands\/.\n2\nPatowary, Kaushik. 2013. \u201cBishop Rock: The Smallest Island in the World.\u201d Amusing Planet. 2013.\nhttps:\/\/www.amusingplanet.com\/2013\/07\/bishop-rock-smallest-island-in-world.html.\n3\n\u201cAnalysis of the Island Regions and Outermost Regions of the European Union: Part I The Island Regions and\nTerritories.\u201d n.d.

CHAPTER 52\nEurope: Political Geography I\nBalkanization and Separatism\nSeparatism, in political geography, refers to an attempt by a\nregion of a country to separate from that country and gain\nindependence. A related term is Balkanization, which describes\nany situation where one country dissolves into more than one\ncountry. The Cold War ended with the Balkanization of the Soviet\nUnion, in which one country dissolved into fifteen countries. Two\nother countries dissolved at the end of the Cold War \u2013\nCzechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.\nBoth\ncountries had\nBalkanization, symbolically visualized in this photo formed at about\nby David Goehring on Flickr.com the same time,\nand for similar\nreasons. The Czechs and Slovaks have different cultures,\nidentities, and languages, but they also have a lot in common.\nBoth nations are Slavic and historically Catholic. Both had been\npart of Austria-Hungary. The two nations formed a union in\n1918 as the result of a sort of \u201csafety in numbers\u201d mentality.\nSurrounded by larger, more powerful states, the Czechs and\nSlovaks figured that by unifying they would be better equipped\nto resist foreign domination. Yugoslavia was formed in the\nsame year, when a number of small southern Slavic nations\nChurch in Skaldic, Slovakia, near the border with the\n(Yugoslavia means \u201cLand of the Southern Slavs\u201d) unified out of\nCzech Republic. Photo by samuel on Flickr.\na similar \u201csafety in numbers\u201d motivation.\n253 254 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe Czechs and Slovaks divided peacefully in 1993 \u2013 so\npeacefully, in fact, that the dissolution was referred to as the\n\u201cVelvet Divorce.\u201d Things didn\u2019t go so smoothly in Yugoslavia. In 1991\nand 1992, four countries declared independence from Yugoslavia \u2013\nSlovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia. Serbia dominated much\nof what was left of Yugoslavia (and, in fact, kept the name\n\u201cYugoslavia\u201d for a few years). What followed was Europe\u2019s bloodiest\nconflict since World War II. The term \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d was coined\nin the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, as these newly separate\nstates sought to \u201ccleanse\u201d their countries of minorities. Those who\nresisted were often killed. Nowhere was the fighting fiercer than in\nBosnia. The Muslim Bosniaks held a slim majority in the new\nEthnic Groups of the former Yugoslavia.\ncountry, but there were (and still are) large Serb and Croat\nCartography by James McGinty.\nminorities in Bosnia. All three groups fought for political and\nterritorial control, with Croatia and Serbia backing their ethnic\nbrethren in the civil war.\nThe fighting continued in different areas for about a decade, leaving more than 140,000 dead. In 2006,\nMontenegro voted to separate from Serbia, becoming the sixth country to emerge from Yugoslavia. Kosovo,\nan Albanian-dominated enclave in Serbia, declared independence in 2008, although its independence is not\nrecognized by many countries in the international community, including, of course, Serbia.\nThe fragmentation of the European political map might not have ended. There are a few areas in Europe that\nhave discussed the possibility of future independence.\nThe most likely candidate is Scotland. For several centuries,\nScotland has been united with England, Wales, and Northern\nIreland in what is officially known as the United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland (the \u201cUK,\u201d or \u201cBritain\u201d for\nshort). Still, the Scots have long maintained a strong separate\nnational identity. Calls for Scottish independence intensified in\nthe 1980s after Margaret Thatcher was elected Prime Minister\nof Britain. Scotland is, for the most part, a very politically liberal\npart of Britain, and the conservative Thatcher was not popular\nthere. In 1997, Scotland established its own parliament. It still\nsends representatives to the British parliament in London, but\nthe Scottish parliament has control over many of its own\ndomestic affairs. In 2014, Scottish voters took part in a national Scottish vote for independence. Photo by Garry Knight\nreferendum seeking full independence. Polls showed that a on Flickr.\nnumber of Scots liked the idea of independence, but felt that\nthere were too many questions about how Scotland and the rest of the UK would divide the country\u2019s resources\nand liabilities. In spite of support by the man in the photo , the referendum was defeated 55% to 45%.\nAfter Britain\u2019s recent exit from the European Union, however, there have been renewed calls for independence,\nsince Scottish voters overwhelmingly voted to remain part of the EU. Recent polls show that the majority of Scots\nnow favor independence. It is possible, even probable, that Scotland will gain independence sometime in the next\nfew years. EUROPE: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 255\nThe second-most likely country to gain independence in Europe is Catalonia, a region in northeastern Spain\ncentered on the city of Barcelona. Catalonia has, in the past, been free from Spanish rule and, when it hasn\u2019t been,\nit has often enjoyed a good deal of autonomy. As a result, Catalonia has always had a unique and separate identity\nfrom Spain, and even has its own unique dialect of Spanish. Many Catalonians favor independence based on these\ncultural and historical factors alone, but economics plays a role as well. Barcelona has long been the economic\ndynamo of Spain, and many in the city feel that the rest of Spain is essentially economic dead weight.\nIn 2017, the Catalonian provincial government held an independence referendum, which passed, leading the\nCatalonian parliament to declare independence. Spain\u2019s government declared the referendum illegal (and, in\nthe eyes of most neutral legal experts, it was). At the moment, there is no clear path forward for Catalonian\nindependence, but there is clearly support for it.\nThere have been similar rumblings in northern Italy. Like Catalonia, northern Italian regions like Lombardy are\nthe economic engines of their country, and feel limited by political corruption and economic stagnation in the\nrest of Italy. At this point, a genuine move for independence by northern Italy seems unlikely, but not impossible.\nResidents in Flanders (northern Belgium) have had similar discussions, but, similarly, independence does not seem\nimminent. Many residents in the Basque Country in northern Spain, and also of the French island of Corsica have\nmade more strident calls for independence, but is unlikely that either region possesses the economic or political\nclout to achieve such a thing.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nBosniaks, Serbs, and Croatians all speak the same language, and have a shared cultural history. The primary difference among them is\nreligion \u2013 most Bosniaks are Muslim, most Serbs are Orthodox, and most Croats are Catholic.\nThe Czech Republic has adopted a shorter version for its country name \u2013 Czechia. This sort of thing is not unusual. The People\u2019s Republic\nof China is generally simply called China, after all. Even so, the BBC suggests that the new name was added primarily because it fit better on\nsports jerseys.\nFor a nifty GIF of the history of Balkanization, go to http:\/\/wordsmith.org\/words\/images\/balkanize_large.gif 256 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nGoehring, David. n.d.

CHAPTER 53\nEurope: Population Geography I\nThe Schengen Agreement\nThe movement of people across space is inherently geographic. At its broadest, this is called mobility. Mobility\nincludes all sorts of spatial movement \u2013 daily commuting, migration, tourism, and more. Throughout the study\nof mobility, geographers note the movements across space, but in doing so, they examine why and how the\nmovement happens.\nOne key, or actually a law, to mobility is the geographic concept of distance. Distance is a variable that is crucial\nto the study of Geography; in fact, it is shown in Waldo Tobler\u2019s First Law of Geography \u2013 \u201cEverything is related to\neverything else, but near things are more related than distant things.\u201d\nThe United States is well known for its mobility; in fact, arguably America has the most mobile society in the\nworld. Urban Americans are active commuters, sometimes going over an hour each way to and from work in a car\nor bus or train. American wealth allows for extensive ownership of automobiles. Not counting microstates, the\nUnited States trails only New Zealand in number of road motor vehicles (more than two wheels) per 1000 people.\nThe American road system is unmatched around the globe in a combined measure of quality (paved) and quantity\n(miles of road). America\u2019s large land area provides the spatial availability for numerous large cities. Cities are\nknown to have a magnetic-like attraction for migrants and travelers. Additionally and key to this essay\u2019s topic, the\n257 258 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nUnited States has a large land area, divided into fifty states, yet existing without internal borders acting as barriers\nto mobility.\nWith the American history as a clearly viewed positive example, Europe sought to organize itself as a set of\ncountries. (See the essay on The Development of the European Union) The European Union was established\nin 1993 by the Maastricht Treaty, named for the city in the Netherlands, where the treaty was signed. At that\ntime, there were fifteen member countries, having now expanded to twenty-seven. The European Union (EU)\nsubsumed the prior organization, the European Economic Community (EEC).\nIt was under the auspices of the EEC that an interest in mobility in Europe began. Likely there were observations\nabout and comparisons to the United States. The United States is much larger than Europe (not including Russia),\nyet America\u2019s lack of internal border stops allowed it to produce much more efficiency transportation mobility\nthan found in Europe. Could borders in the EEC be regulated more like American borders?\nThe initial Schengen agreement was among only five of the\ncountries of the EEC. Like the EU\u2019s Maastricht agreement, this was\nnamed for the city where it was signed (in Luxembourg). The\nBenelux trio of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were\njoined by West Germany and France in concurring to gradually\nreduce controls at common international borders. Like the EEC\u2019s\nbroadening into the EU, the number of countries interested in\njoining the Schengen Agreement also expanded. Though it\noriginally existed outside of the EEC and EU, in 1999 the Schengen\nAgreement officially was integrated into the laws of the European\nUnion, though it allowed for Ireland and the United Kingdom to opt\nout. Countries joining the EU after 1999 were expected to become\nmembers of the Schengen Agreement as well, but were also able to\npostpone immediate enrollment. Thus, it is that Croatia, Bulgaria,\nand Romania do not yet count within the Schengen fold. The\nappeal of open borders brought non-EU countries to participate in\nthe Schengen system, including Norway, Iceland, Switzerland,\nLiechtenstein, and the microstates of Monaco, Vatican City, and San\nMarino.\nThe Schengen Agreement has widespread support in Europe,\nthough some populist politicians preach fear of terrorists\nmaneuvering through Europe\u2019s open borders. Supporters counter\nthat security is maintained and improves with integration of\nCartography by Ian Scroggs.\nEurope, not with fragmentation. With over 400 million people living\nin Schengen countries, the benefits to trade, travel, and tourism\nhave been significant. Even by 2010, three Schengen countries (#4 Italy, #5 France, #6 Germany) ranked in the top\nsix countries in the world, in terms of total road passenger miles. Not surprisingly, the United States was the top\ncountry in this statistic. In 2014 in the measure of tourist trips per person, the top countries included #1 Finland,\n#2 United States, #3 Sweden, #4 Denmark, #5 Norway, #10 France.

CHAPTER 54\nEurope: Urban Geography I\nThe Primate City\nPrimate mammals include human beings; however, a primate city, though populated by human beings, is\nnamed for mammals, but instead the term refers to the word primary meaning singular and dominant. Thus, a\nprimate city dominates its country in all urban ways.\nFour factors should be evaluated to consider whether or not a country is likely to have a primate city. First, does\nthe country have a large population? If yes, this decreases the probability that one city dominates the country\u2019s\nurban population, for a large population provides sufficient numbers of people to populate many large cities.\nSecond, does the country have a large area? If yes, then this too decreases the probability that one city\ndominates the country\u2019s urban population, for a large area provides sufficient territory to develop many large\ncities.\nThird, does the country have a long history of urbanization? If yes, then again the probability of a primate city\ndecreases, for there has been enough time for many cities to form and grow in size and importance.\n\u2022 If a country has none of these three characteristics, then it will not have a primate city.\n\u2022 If it has one of these three characteristics, then it might have a primate city.\n\u2022 Two of three, probably a primate city.\n260 EUROPE: URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 261\n\u2022 Three of three, guaranteed a primate city.\nLet\u2019s consider these factors in regard to Europe. First, do European countries have large populations? The most\nth\npopulated country in Europe is Germany with about 83 million people is only the 17 largest country in the world.\n(Note that we are not counting Russia in Europe.) Despite this rank, we will credit Germany with a large population.\n\u2022 UK \u2013 67 million\n\u2022 France \u2013 65 million\n\u2022 Italy \u2013 60 million\n\u2022 Spain \u2013 47 million\nThese are the top four countries in Europe, by population size.\nIn contrast, there are many countries in Europe with small populations \u2013 Netherlands 17 million, Sweden 10\nmillion, Austria 9 million, Ireland 5 million, Luxembourg 1 million, and so on.\nSecond, do European countries have large areas? The largest country in Europe is France. (Again, not counting\nRussia in Europe, but also counting Ukraine in the Russian Domain. Turkey does not yet belong in\nEurope.) France\u2019s 212,935 square miles is smaller than that of Texas at 268,596 square miles. While Texas is a very\nlarge state compared to the average American state, it would not count as a large country. Thus, we can say that\nno country in Europe is particularly large.\nThird, does Europe have a long history of urbanization? Given that urbanization is associated with\nindustrialization and that Europe is the birthplace of industrialization, we can say that most of Europe indeed has\na long history of urbanization. Europe as a whole measures at 74% urban. Belgium leads the way with a 98% urban\npopulation.\nAfter assessing these characteristics that cause primate cities to arise, we make another check to determine if\nthe primate city is present. Does the largest city have significant percentage of the country\u2019s urban population? A\nreasonable threshold would be 15% of the country\u2019s urban dwellers living in just one city and dwarfing any other\ncity.\nSo, do European countries have single cities with over 20% of the country\u2019s urban population? Let\u2019s take a look\nat the figures for metropolitan areas.\n\u2022 Athens 2.7 million of Greece\u2019s 11 million, tripling Thessaloniki.\n\u2022 Belgrade 1.65 million of Serbia\u2019s 7 million, 5x Novi Sad.\n\u2022 Budapest 3.3 million of Hungary\u2019s 10 million, dwarfing Debrecen\u2019s 237 thousand.\n\u2022 Copenhagen 2 million of Denmark\u2019s 6 million, 6x Aarhus\n\u2022 Dublin 1.9 million of Ireland\u2019s 5 million, nearly 5x Cork.\n\u2022 Helsinki 1.4 million of Finland\u2019s 6 million, 4x Tampere.\n\u2022 London 14 million of England\u2019s 67 million, 12x Birmingham.\n\u2022 Oslo 1.7 million of Norway\u2019s 5 million, 4x Bergen.\n\u2022 Paris 12 million of France\u2019s 65 million, but dwarfing Lyon 2.2 million.\n\u2022 Prague 2.1 million of Czechia\u2019s 11 million, 2+x Brno.\n\u2022 Reykjavik 210 thousand of Iceland\u2019s 360 thousand, dwarfing Akureyri\u2019s 19k.\n\u2022 Riga 1 million of Latvia\u2019s 2 million, 10x Daugavpils.\n\u2022 Sofia 1.6 million of Bulgaria\u2019s 7 million, 3x Plovdiv\u2019s 544 thousand. 262 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n\u2022 Stockholm 2.2 million of Sweden\u2019s 10 million, 2x Gothenburg.\n\u2022 Tallinn 540 thousand of Estonia\u2019s 1.3 million, 5x Tartu.\n\u2022 Vienna 2.6 million of Austria\u2019s 9 million, 9x Graz.\n\u2022 Zagreb 1.1 million of Croatia\u2019s 4 million, 3x Split.\nThis is not an exhaustive list of primate cities in Europe, but clearly this is the pattern. European countries typically\nhave primate cities. Only Germany counts as having a large population. None of the countries count as having a\nlarge area. A few of the countries are considered to lack a long history of urbanization. Thus, most countries will\nhave one of our determining factors, while Germany has two of these three factors.\nWhile these are the noted national characteristics; primate cities themselves are typified by other elements.\nPrimate cities are the political capital cities. Primate cities are the cultural foci of their respective countries. The\neconomic center of the country is the primate city. The primate city dominates the country\u2019s urban life in all ways.\nAsk someone to name a city in France and their first thought will\nbe Paris. Indeed, Paris clearly is the primate city of France,\ndominating it as the capital, the cultural core, and the financial\ncenter. However, in terms of the magnitude of primacy, Paris is not\nthe leader in Europe. Budapest\u2019s degree of primacy in Hungary is\ngreater than Paris\u2019 degree of primacy in France.\nNotably absent from the list of countries with primate cities are\nGermany and Poland.\n\u2022 Berlin 3.5 million of Germany\u2019s 83 million, 2x Hamburg.\nEiffel Tower, Paris, France. Photo by Julieta on Flickr.\nGermany\u2019s population is too great to have a European primate\ncity. To meet the 15% threshold, Berlin would need to have a\npopulation of 12.45 million. Additionally, Berlin does not dwarf Hamburg, the second largest city.\n\u2022 Warsaw 1.75 million of Poland\u2019s 38 million, 2+x Krakow.\nTo meet the 15% threshold, Warsaw would need to have a population of 5.7 million. It does not dwarf Krakow,\nthe second largest city.\nThe list of European countries without clear primate cities also includes Romania, the Netherlands, Belgium, and\nPortugal, to name a few.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe United States clearly does not have a primate city. New York is the financial center and the largest city. Washington, DC, is the political\ncapital. Los Angeles lays claim to the cultural focus. Chicago and Houston have large populations as key cities. The United States has a large\npopulation, a large area, and a long history of urbanization. Thus, it has none of the three characteristics used to generate primate cities. In\nfact, the United States follows the Rank-Size Rule. Go to the essay on the Rank-Size Rule in Russia for a parallel to this topic.

CHAPTER 55\nEurope: Cultural Geography II\nPopularity of the Scandinavian Murder Mystery Novel\nThe murder mystery novel has long been a popular genre of literature in America, but also in countries around\nthe world. Within this field of writing, there also exist several sub-genres. The cozy offers a softer approach that\nprovides few gory descriptions of violence or explicit portrayals of sex. The amateur sleuth finds bodies and solves\n1\nmurders, while not working in the field of law enforcement, but rather being in an unrelated field like academia.\nHard-boiled novels feature a main character, typically a police officer or private detective, who employs rough and\ntumble tactics to work a case, often cursing and using his muscles. Noir (French for dark) crime fiction, which may\noverlap with hard-boiled novels, presents particularly dark stories, where the hero is greatly flawed and the crime\n264 EUROPE: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 265\ngraphic and heinous. In the last two decade, a popular sub-sub-genre of the murder mystery novel is Scandinavian\nnoir (sometimes expanded to Nordic noir).\nMurder mystery novelists also choose perspectives for telling the story. The classic Perry Mason mysteries\nby Erle Stanley Gardner are plot-driven. Although readers of the series gain a great affection for Perry Mason,\nhis secretary Della Street, and his detective Paul Drake, readers know almost nothing of Mason\u2019s personal life.\nInstead, readers are intrigued by Mason\u2019s courtroom skills and the author\u2019s presentation of plot twists.\nOther mysteries are character-driven. While the elements of the plot are important, the author writes detailed\naccounts of the characters\u2019 physical appearance, thoughts, and emotions. The reader understands the\nmotivations of the protagonist, and often that of the killer too.\nOtherwise, but in truth rarely, these novels may be location-driven. The author takes great effort to describe the\nsetting, physical and cultural, of the location of the crime and the investigation. If location is the primary focus\nof the novel, then certainly this is a very geographic perspective. In most cases, though, the setting of the novel\nserves as an important, but secondary, element of the book. This is certainly true of Martin Cruz Smith\u2019s \u201cGorky\nPark,\u201d where the author\u2019s description of Moscow and of Soviet life gives the reader an excellent feel for the location\n2\n\u2013 thus, a sense of place. \u201cChild 44,\u201d author Tom Rob Smith\u2019s characterization of the tense lives of Soviet peoples in\nthe post-WWII Stalinist USSR, also demonstrates this understanding, while still being a mystery novel.\nWhether a primary or secondary element of the story, locational\ndescription aids the reader in having a geographic sense of place.\nThis geographic concept is a person\u2019s understanding of a place that\ngoes beyond factual observation to include emotional attachment.\nAn American\u2019s sense of place of a home state includes the factual\nquantities and qualities of the physical landscape (mountains,\nrivers, \u2026) and the social landscape (religion, economy, \u2026), but also\ncomprises intangibles of affection (or other emotions, even dislike)\nfor regions, towns, and other locations in that state.\nInternationally, this is often true for countries, certainly for nation-\nStates common in Europe, where citizens possess a bond of\nnationalism as part of their sense of place for their country. This\nmay be true even for specific features of the landscape, perhaps a\n3\nmountain. In the case of Scandinavian noir, this sense of place is an\nprime element of the murder mystery novel.\nThe origin of this Northern European style of murder mystery\nnovel can be debated. The book \u201cThe Laughing Policeman,\u201d a\npolice procedural featuring officer Martin Beck, was the first of ten\nrelated novels written jointly by Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6. Some\nwould cite this pair of authors as beginning a new trend, though\ntheir socially critical novels are not as harsh as later writers\u2019 works.\nIt is fair to cite \u201cSmilla\u2019s Sense of Snow\u201d by Peter H\u00f8eg (1992) as\noffering a gritty plot, a conflicted protagonist, and a visit to frigid\nPhysical Landscape in Scandinavia.\nGreenland. Perhaps Henning Mankell should be listed. For the\nCartography by Steve Wiertz.\nAmerican audience, the breakthrough came with Stieg Larsson\u2019s\ntrilogy that began in 2005 with \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\u201d If\nI had to pick, I would cite these as their respective countries\u2019 most notable writers in this sub-genre: Norway \u2013 Jo\nNesb\u00f8, Sweden \u2013 Stieg Larsson, Denmark \u2013 Jussi Adler-Olsen. While across the region there now are several dozen\nauthors who fit into this sub-genre, let us note a few examples to guide an understanding of the patterns of sense\nof placein these novels. 266 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe irony of Scandinavian noiris that while the stories feature dark heinous crimes, the actual crimes rates in\nScandinavia are quite low. In Stieg Larsson\u2019s trilogy (particularly the first of the set), the key crimes are the violent\ntorture and murder of women. Strikingly, the original Swedish title was \u201cM\u00e4n som hatar kvinnor\u201d which translates\nas \u201cMen who hate Women.\u201d In Jussi Adler-Olsen\u2019s \u201cQ Department\u201d series, the first novel \u201cThe Keeper of Lost\nCauses\u201d portrays a sadistic imprisonment of a woman inside a decompression chamber, adjusted to torturous\nsettings. Jo Nesb\u00f8\u2019s \u201cThe Redbreast\u201d examines neo-Nazis in Norway, while \u201cThe Nemesis\u201d follows a gruesome\nserial killer. Understandably, a noirstory is not a cozy mystery where the killer slays with a mildly poisoned cup of\nchamomile tea. These novels highlight the grisly outlier in otherwise very safe settings. See these statistics on\n4\nintentional homicide per 100,000 per year:.\nCountry Homicides per 100,000 per year\nNorway 0.50\nIceland 0.90\nSweden 1.10\nDenmark 1.50\nUSA 5.30\nEl Salvador (highest in the world) 61.80\n5\nOr measure by the Global Peace Index , measuring peace and safety:\nCountry Global Peace Index\nIceland (most peaceful country in the world) 1\nDenmark 5\nSweden 18\nNorway 20\nUSA 128\nAfghanistan (least peaceful) 163\nThe heroes or protagonists in these novels display numerous character flaws, physical weaknesses, and\nemotional baggage \u2013 sometimes all of these together. Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo on her\nback, is a tiny young woman who survives physical confrontation only by the ferocity of her attacks. Definitely\non the autism spectrum, she is a computer genius with no social skills. Beaten by her abusive father, raped by\nher guardian, and crushed by the system, she survives by her drive for vengeance and her computer hacking\nabilities. Eventually, she joins with journalist Mikael Blomkvist in an awkward, sometimes sexual, investigative\npairing. Blomkvist is a serial womanizer, but is compelled to help Lisbeth Salander and to expose the horrors of\nsexual predation against women.\nJussi Adler-Olsen\u2019s lead police investigator is Carl M\u00f8rck. M\u00f8rck is an antisocial slacker, traumatized by the\nshooting of his now paralyzed police partner Hardy Henningsen. Already on page five of \u201cThe Keeper of Lost\nCauses,\u201d the reader learns that \u201cHardy had taken his last steps and the fire inside Carl had been extinguished.\u201d\nAdd a troublesome ex-wife and a good-for-nothing twenty-something son, mix in a bit or more than a bit of\nalcohol; consequently, Carl doesn\u2019t much care. The boss figures that Carl can be pushed aside to take on the new\nQ Department, pursuing old unsolved cases that likely have no leads or solutions.\nHarry Hole (what a name! \u2013 but in Norwegian, the surname is pronounced HO-leh \u2014 https:\/\/forvo.com\/word\/\nharry_hole\/ ) is the Norwegian police investigator in the works of Jo Nesb\u00f8. Like Carl M\u00f8rck, Harry Hole is a EUROPE: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 267\nmiscreant, noted on page thirteen of \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Star,\u201d as \u201cthe lone wolf, the drunk, the department\u2019s enfant\nterrible.\u201d\nFor Scandinavian noir, the frequent winter setting is cold and forbidding. In \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d\na noteworthy portion of the novel is set on Hedeby Island in Sweden. Mikael Blomkvist, one of the two main\ncharacters, laments the cold when a January day\u2019s temperature dropped to -35\u00b0F \u2013 \u201cno matter how much wood\nhe put in the stove, he was still cold.\u201d In \u201cThe Marco Effect\u201d by Adler-Olsen, two characters searching in the winter\nwoods note that \u201cFrost and wind had banished all scent from the landscape, the ice-blue glare and glittering\ncrystals of snow conspiring to conflate all visual impressions. It was sheer hell to be out in such weather.\u201d Yrsa\nSigurdard\u00f3ttir brings her heroine Th\u00f3ra Gudmundsd\u00f3ttir from Iceland to Greenland, going from cold and remote\nto even colder and even more remote; as the reader learns in the aptly named \u201cThe Day is Dark.\u201d\nOften these novels offer insights into Scandinavian society. Issues of immigration are highlighted through Adler-\nOlsen\u2019s character Assad, an Arab migrant assigned to Carl M\u00f8rck\u2019s Q Department. In \u201cThe Marco Effect,\u201d teenage\nMarco seeks to leave behind his Gypsy life and become a Danish citizen. In Larsson\u2019s book three \u201cThe Girl who\nKicked the Hornet\u2019s Nest,\u201d Mikael Blomkvist gains a key bit of help from Kurdish immigrant Idris Ghidi. In fact,\nSweden has the fourth most Kurds in Europe. In the series, Blomkvist is a regular customer at Samir\u2019s Cauldron, a\nBosnian restaurant.\nIndeed, a whole book could be written on the subject of the sense of place in murder mysteries, as was done by\n2\ngeographer Gary Hausladen in 2000. He examined novels from across the world, directed a bit of attention to\nScandinavia; however, his book was published before most of the flourishing of Scandinavian noir.\nIf you read one of these novels, be sure to absorb the understandings of people and places, in other words the\ngeographies, of their settings. For the Scandinavian setting, this usually means an atypical vicious murder, a cold\nand dark climate, and a progressive yet not unflawed society.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nRemember that Finland is not in Scandinavia, so the inclusion of Finnish authors in this sub-genre would prompt the term Nordic noir.\nMeanwhile, recall that Estonia is in Northern Europe. \u201cApothecary Melchior and the Mystery Of St Olaf\u2019s Church\u201d by Indrek Hargla is the first\nEstonian crime novel to be published in English (2016).\n6\nIs this a real-life Nordic noir? In 2019, Norwegian millionaire Tom Hagen\u2019s wife disappeared. A ransom note was found at the couple\u2019s\nhome, but the wife has not been recovered. Officials fear that the wife was murdered and that the husband may have been involved. The story\nis a hot topic in Norway. https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/05\/16\/world\/europe\/kidnapping-murder-norway.html 268 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\nQuam, Joel. 2009. \u2026 or Perish.

Instructor Joseph Adduci. CHAPTER 56\nEurope: Economic Geography II\nCommunism vs. Capitalism\nWhich is better, capitalism or communism? The question that started the Cold War.\nAs a child of the Cold War, I was taught that everything about capitalism is good, and everything about\ncommunism is bad. I\u2019m sure that someone my age who grew up in the Soviet Union was taught the opposite. In\nreality, there are upsides and downsides to both economic systems. In this essay, we\u2019ll examine those pros and\ncons.\nTHE UPSIDE OF CAPITALISM\nEurope\u2019s rise to global dominance was largely the result of capitalism, and proof of the power of capitalism. The\nmaterial wealth of the United States, West Germany, and South Korea when compared to that of the Soviet Union,\nEast Germany, and North Korea during the Cold War is further proof. The power of capitalism is essentially based\non two fundamental forces \u2013 competition and incentive.\nCapitalism is an inherently competitive economic system. Businesses compete for profits. Think of Coke vs.\nPepsi, Apple vs. Microsoft, or Ford vs. Chevy. Competition generally produces goods and services that are better\nand cheaper. Imagine that you own a company that produces a certain product, and one of your competitors finds\n269 270 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\na way to make a better and cheaper version of that same product. If that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019d better improve\nyour product. If you don\u2019t, you run the risk of losing customers and going out of business. So, you improve your\nproduct. As a result, your competitor is forced to do the same. That forces you to be improve again, which forces\nyour competitor to improve again, and so on. Competition yields constant improvement.\nCompetition also exists in the workforce. Workers compete with one another for jobs, and coworkers compete\nwith one another for promotions. It induces people to be a better job applicant \u2013 perhaps by getting additional\ntraining or education \u2013 or risk not getting a job. It induces workers to be more productive, because they want to\nbe the person in their department that gets that promotion.\nAlongside competition is incentive. Incentive is the economic force that provides owners and workers with\npositive and negative reinforcements that lead to innovation and hard work.\nYou may have heard the metaphor of the mule, the carrot, and the stick. It goes like this: If you have a\nstubborn mule who refuses to walk, you can do two things. The first is to dangle a carrot in front of the mule to\nmotivate it to walk. If that doesn\u2019t work, you smack it with the stick until it starts to walk. This metaphor is about\nincentive. A positive reinforcement is the carrot \u2013 the reward that motivates someone to be productive. A negative\nreinforcement is the stick \u2013 the punishment of someone for being unproductive.\nCourse grades are an example of positive and negative reinforcements. You know that if you study hard, you\nmight get an \u2018A\u2019 \u2013 the carrot. You also know that if you don\u2019t study hard, you might get an \u2018F\u2019 \u2013 the stick.\nPositive reinforcements abound in capitalist economies. A business owner who sells a good product and treats\nher customers well is likely to make a bigger profit. An entrepreneur who takes risks and innovates might come\nup with the proverbial million-dollar idea. If you get your college degree, you\u2019re more likely to earn a higher wage.\nIf a worker is productive, he is more likely to get a raise and a promotion.\nOf course, negative reinforcements also exist. A business owner who sells a lousy product and treats her\ncustomers poorly is likely to make a lower profit, or go out of business. An entrepreneur who never takes the risk\nnever reaps the reward. If you drop out of college, your wages will likely be lower. If you slack off at work, you\nprobably won\u2019t get that raise or promotion, and you might get fired.\nIn short, incentive drives up productivity, and is a primary reason why capitalist economies generate so much\nwealth.\nTHE DOWNSIDE OF CAPITALISM EUROPE: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 271\nCompetition is one of the biggest reasons for capitalism\u2019s successes, and also a primary reason for its problems.\nIn a competition there are, by definition, winners and losers.\nLook no further than the United States. Despite residing in the wealthiest country on earth, nearly 40 million\nAmericans live in poverty \u2013 that\u2019s greater than the total population of Canada. Consider Sam Walton, a man who\nlived the American dream. He was from a modest background, and became one of the wealthiest people in the\nworld. But his innovation, Wal-Mart, destroyed tens of thousands of small, locally-owned businesses.\nPeople get hired, and people don\u2019t. People get a raise, and people don\u2019t. Businesses succeed and businesses fail.\nFor every successful restaurant, there is usually one that doesn\u2019t last a year. And even in ideal economic times,\ncapitalist countries rarely see unemployment fall below 4%. In the United States, that\u2019s 7 million people, greater\nthan the population of Indiana. In fact, many economists argue that it\u2019s actually bad to have unemployment below\n4%, because it makes labor too expensive. That\u2019s the downside of competition \u2013 some people lose out.\nThere is also the problem of incentive.\nThe idea that capitalism rewards hard work is usually true. You probably know people who came from working-\nclass backgrounds and who, through hard work, became quite successful. You also probably know a few people\nwho haven\u2019t worked particularly hard and, as a result, haven\u2019t been particularly successful. Generally speaking,\nhard work leads to success, and slacking off usually doesn\u2019t.\nBut that isn\u2019t always true. You probably know people who have worked hard their whole lives, but who still\nstruggle to make ends meet. And we all know the story of the spoiled rich kid \u2013 the one who was born on third\nbase and thinks he hit a triple \u2013 who slacked off but still had the connections and advantages to make plenty of\nmoney. It is certainly true that the circumstances of your birth \u2013 your social class, your place of birth, your ethnicity,\nyour gender \u2013 will create privileges and obstacles that have nothing to do with hard work or the lack of it.\nFinally, there is a flaw in assuming that all wealth comes from hard work. Oftentimes, the wealthy don\u2019t earn\nthe majority of their wealth through salaries, but through investments. Multi-millionaires can invest a relatively\nsmall percentage of their wealth in the stock market, and earn more money from that investment in a year than\nmany Americans earn from a lifetime of work. In a capitalist economy, the easiest way to make a lot of money is\nto already have a lot of money.\nTHE UPSIDE OF COMMUNISM\nThe upside of communism is simple, but profound. In a communist economy, the basic necessities are 272 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nguaranteed. Most citizens of communist Europe were provided with food, education, housing, health care, and\nemployment. Homelessness, unemployment, and hunger were essentially eliminated. Universal health care was\nstandard. College was free right up through a PhD. It is not a coincidence that successful communist revolutions\nhappen in poor countries, not rich ones. If a large percentage of a country\u2019s population lives in poverty, they are\nmore likely to support communist movements.\nTHE DOWNSIDE OF COMMUNISM\nSome of the most enduring images of the fall of the Berlin Wall were those of East Germans driving their Trabants\ninto West Berlin. Manufactured from 1957 to 1990, and largely unchanged over those years, the Trabant was the\ndefault car for most East Germans. It was slow, loud, ugly, and had an engine better suited to a riding lawnmower.\nIts body was made of a plastic resin, it belched smoke, and it had no gas gauge. In fact, it had no gas door (drivers\nhad to mix oil and gas together and pour it in under the hood). When those Trabants rolled into West Germany,\nthe home of legendary automakers like BMW and Mercedes, they seemed to represent everything that had gone\nwrong under communism.\nThe reason so many East Germans drove Trabants is because\nEast Germany had only one automaker \u2013 the East German\ngovernment. And this wasn\u2019t just true of East German cars, it was\ntrue of nearly every manufactured good in nearly every country in\nthe Soviet bloc. Every product had one manufacturer \u2013 the\ngovernment. And that lack of competition is why consumer\nproducts in communist economies were so legendarily bad. There\nwas no better, cheaper option, so the products remained lousy and\nexpensive (not to mention scarce \u2013 East Germans would sometimes\nwait years for the privilege of owning a Trabant).\nCommunism also lacked incentive. Workers were guaranteed\njobs, but they also had little room for advancement. Those who\nrose through ranks of communist economies usually did so\nTrabant. Photo by altotemi on Flickr.\nbecause they were well-connected politically, not because they\nwere more talented or worked harder.\nImagine a steel worker in Poland in the 1970s. Each morning he woke up knowing two things. First, he knew that\nif he was the model employee, and worked as hard as he possibly could, he would probably still never get a raise\nor a promotion. Second, he knew that if he didn\u2019t work that hard at all, he wouldn\u2019t be fired. Worker productivity is\nkey to economic growth and efficiency, and workers in the communist bloc were never terribly productive. This is\nnot because they were lazy, but simply because they lacked incentive.\nBack to the course grade analogy. As was discussed, course grades are like incentive in capitalism. You have\npositive reinforcement \u2013 the possibility of an \u2018A\u2019 \u2013 and you have negative reinforcement \u2013 the possibility of an \u2018F.\u2019\nImagine that, on the first day of class, your professor announced that everyone in the class was going to receive a\n\u2018C\u2019, no matter what. You would leave class that day knowing two things. If you showed up every day, and studied\nharder than you\u2019ve ever studied, you would get a \u2018C\u2019. You would also know that if you never studied at all and, in\nfact, never showed up again, you would still get a \u2018C\u2019. It\u2019s unlikely that your professor would ever see you again.\nThis is not because you\u2019re lazy, but simply because you would have little incentive to show up.\nIn a sense, communism is an economic system in which everyone gets a \u2018C\u2019. Ultimately, it can eliminate the ugly\naspects of capitalism \u2013 unemployment, poverty, wealth disparity, and shuttered businesses \u2013 but it eliminates all\nof the good things about capitalism as well. EUROPE: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 273\nAt the end of the Cold War, most people of the Soviet bloc decided that the rewards of capitalism were worth\nthe risks. They were ready to trade in their Trabants for a shot at a BMW.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nRomania abolished the death penalty on January 7th, 1990. The last people to be executed were Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu \u2013 who ruled communist\nRomania for thirty-five years \u2013 and his wife, Elena. They were executed by firing squad on December 25th, 1989, three days after Nicolae was\nforced from power.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\naltotemi. 2016.

CHAPTER 57\nEurope: Historical Geography II\nMalta\nMalta is a small island country, situated in the Mediterranean Sea, southwest of Italy and north of Libya. Its\ngeographic location, natural harbors, and limestone quarries made it a strategic geopolitical prize historically,\nespecially at two key military times. Coincidentally, these same features have drawn talent scouts from film\nand television, resulting, among others, in the hosting of a number of scenes from the popular series \u201cGame of\nThrones.\u201d\nIn considering Malta, the acronym FOE is useful. Let\u2019s start with the letter O. O is for old. As a pair of islands, the\ncountry Malta is only 122 square miles in area, about double the size of Washington, DC. The main island Malta\nis 95 square miles with the island Gozo being 26 square miles (Comino is one square mile, a nature preserve). As\nsuch, the country Malta is the tenth smallest country in the world. For comparison, Tahiti = 403 sq. miles, Great\nAbaco (unknown by most people, until Hurricane Dorian in 2019) = 442, Mauritius = 720, Puerto Rico = 3500.\nGiven Malta\u2019s size, when might we expect that it would first be peopled? What about other small islands,\nin comparison? Tahiti\u2019s first settlers, Polynesians, arrived about 1000 CE; however, that is the Pacific Ocean.\nGreat Abaco 500-800 CE and Puerto Rico 2000 BCE, but in the Atlantic Ocean. Mauritius 1500 CE in the Indian\nOcean. As it is with geography, location matters. Malta\u2019s location in the Mediterranean Sea, allowed its discovery\n274 EUROPE: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 275\nand settlement to come much earlier than these other modestly sized islands, for Malta sits in a much smaller sea\nand in the midst of many of history\u2019s early seafarers.\nThough Malta was not settled as early as much larger\nMediterranean island such as Cyprus, Sicily, and Sardinia, this\ntoo makes geographic sense that these large islands would be\ndiscovered and utilized before tiny Malta. However, Malta has\nbeen settled since 5900 BCE. It has been considered a strategic\nlocation, controlled at times by Mediterranean groups\nincluding the Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs and later by\nEuropean countries such as Great Britain and France. While\nthese numerous peoples brought varied religions to the island,\nit is noteworthy that the apostle Paul, a major Christian figure,\nwas shipwrecked on Malta around the year 60 CE. Although\nother points in history could have led to other religious\nMalta \u2013 Photo by Ferenc Horvath on Unsplash\npatterns, Malta is now a largely Catholic country.\nF is for Fortified. Limestone quarries abound on Malta; in\nfact, the islands Malta and Gozo essentially are slabs of\nlimestone. As a relatively soft stone, limestone can be cut into\nblocks use as building materials. Although soft may sound\nweak for construction, actually limestone is prized for its\nstrength, resistance to corrosion, durability, and non-slip and\nheat-resistant qualities. It is readily obvious to any visitor of\nMalta that nearly every human structure there is built of\nlimestone. From ancient structures to modern urban\nresidences, from cathedrals to fortifications, from coastal\nlandscapes to burial catacombs, in Malta it is all limestone.\nPhoto by Matheus Frade on Unsplash\nAs more and\nmore peoples came to Malta, more and more limestone was\nquarried. However, with human migration to Malta, there came\nconquests and dangers. The demand for simple shelter evolved\ninto the need for fortified dwellings and urban areas. Thus, in the\n8thcentury on Malta, limestone built the walled city now known as\nMdina. At that time, it was the Phoenicians who developed this as\nthe capital city, thus serving for nearly a thousand years. On Gozo,\nthe walled Citadel was developed much later, beginning as a\nlimestone castle in the 1500s.\nAlthough there have been many peoples and many invaders\narriving at Malta, two points in its military history stand out. First,\nin 1565 forces of the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of\nSuleiman the Magnificent sailed in nearly two hundred ships to\nMalta with a large invading force. Under siege and led by the Physical landscape of Malta.\nKnights Hospitaller, Malta resisted the attack. According to the\nKnight order\u2019s historian, the numbers clearly favored the Ottoman forces, who greatly valued Malta\u2019s strategic\nlocation in Islam\u2019s quest to gain more territory in Europe. 276 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nMALTA VS. OTTOMAN EMPIRE IN 1565\nThe Knights Hospitaller The Ottomans\n500 Knights Hospitaller 600 Spahis (cavalry)\n400 Spanish soldiers 500 Spahis from Karamania\n800 Italian soldiers 6000 Janissaries\n500 soldiers from the galleys (Spanish Empire) 400 adventurers from Mytiline\n200 Greek and Sicilian soldiers 2500 Spahis from Rumelia\n100 soldiers of Fort St. Elmo 3500 adventurers from Rumelia\n100 servants of the knights 4000 \"religious\" servants\n500 galley slaves 6000 other volunteers\n3000 soldiers from the Maltese population various corsairs from Tripoli and Algiers\nTotal: 6100 Total: 28500 from the East, 40000 in all\nAlthough Ottoman forces earlier had taken Gozo and while Suleiman had won numerous battles elsewhere\nto expand the Ottoman Empire, the nearly four-month siege of Malta was unsuccessful for the invaders. The\ninvasion though repelled by Maltese forces prompted additional use of limestone, as the new port city Valletta\nwas founded in 1566, featuring towering limestone fortified walls.\nThe siege proved to be a singular turning point in the history of Malta, securing a strategic location in the\ndefense of Europe. Malta\u2019s cultural, economic, and military foci then never strayed from Europe, eventually\nextending to Malta\u2019s entrance into the European Union in 2004 and the Eurozone in 2008. Additionally, the role of\nknights, prominent in Europe, gained prominence in Malta, with Europe\u2019s Knights of St. John (the Order of Knights\nof the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem or the Knights Hospitaller) being headquartered there from 1530 to 1798.\nEurope\u2019s hold on Malta continued, but altered course with Napoleonic takeover of Malta in 1798, only to be\nquickly supplanted by British rule, starting in 1800. Malta remained a British colony until independence in 1964\nwith subsequent conversion to a republic in 1974.\nThe second key point in Malta\u2019s military history was World War II.\nAs a British colony, obviously, Malta fought on the side of the Allies.\nThis siege, 1940-1942, of course involved attacks by air as well as\nby sea. German and Italian aircraft bombed Malta repeatedly, as\nAllied forces sought to withstand and to repel the attackers.\nWinston Churchill likened Malta to \u201can unsinkable aircraft\ncarrier.\u201d Malta\u2019s strategic value was at its highest during the war\u2019s\ncampaigns in North Africa. Overall, in three years of attacks,\nMalta\u2019s military and civilians were put on alert over 3000 times. In\nfact, Maltese and Allied forces withstood the siege and defended\nMalta successfully. Malta\u2019s usefulness as a base for navy and air\nforce was important for the overall Allied victory in the war. British\nMalta.

As a result of Malta\u2019s victory over Ottoman\ninvaders in 1565, Malta\u2019s regional focus remained centered on\nEurope and did not turn toward the Muslim world.

Although the native language is Maltese,\nalmost everyone can speak English. Two-thirds of the population\ncan speak Italian and one-sixth French.

CHAPTER 58\nEurope: Physical Geography II\nIceland\nIceland is a small island country, situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Norway and east of Greenland.\nThe name of the country is suggestive of ice, obviously. Indeed, over 10% of the surface is glacier. However, the\nisland was created and still is being built by volcanic eruptions, so \u201cice\u201d doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nThe story or tale of its naming goes back to the arrival of Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arsonin about the year 870. Fl\u00f3ki was\ngreatly disappointed in the harshness and travails of that year\u2019s frigid winter, so he spitefully named the place\nIceland.\nThe popular series of books collectively titled \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d found great success as the TV series \u201cGame\nof Thrones.\u201d Iceland has long been called \u201cland of fire and ice.\u201d Appropriately, some of the scenes in \u201cGame of\nThrones\u201d were filmed in Iceland.\n278 EUROPE: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY II 279\nIndeed, the complicated physical geography of Iceland is a\nmixture of fire and ice. Iceland\u2019s geographic location as an island\nalmost reaching the Arctic Circle certainly produces cold weather.\nThe main island of Iceland sits barely south of the line of 66.5\u00b0\nnorth latitude, while some smaller islands of the country do extend\nabove that line. Truly, in winter Iceland can be quite snowy, as seen\nin the satellite photo to the left.\nHowever, the North Atlantic Current (or Drift), as an extension of\nthe warm Gulf Stream, brings temperate Atlantic waters to the\ncoastlines of Iceland. In this way Iceland isn\u2019t as icy as it otherwise\nwould be.\nClearly icy at times and in places, it is Iceland\u2019s volcanic nature\nthat belies the icy name. Iceland sits astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\nthat stretches the length of the Atlantic Ocean, north to south. In\nIceland. Image by Richard Petry on Flickr.\nthe North Atlantic, the ridge marks the meeting of the edges of the\nNorth American and Eurasian tectonic plates. These volatile edges\nproduce dramatic geologic changes; in this case, as a divergent plate boundary. As these tectonic plates slowly\nmove apart, molten rock material is released between them. Throughout the Atlantic Ocean this process has built\nnumerous seamounts, rock formations that would be hills, mountains, and volcanoes if on land. Seamounts,\nhowever, do not reach the surface of the ocean.\nApparently, Iceland is different than these\nseamounts. In fact, Iceland adds a second geologic\nprocess to its development. The generally understand\nprocess of hot spot or mantle plume occurs where a\nweak spot in the Earth\u2019s mantle releases molten\nmaterial. The process illustrates the building blocks of\nthe Hawaiian Islands. When under oceans, these long-\nlasting hot regions contribute such large quantities of\nmolten material that islands are formed, in contrast to\nthe sub-surface seamounts.\nPlace\nIceland\non the\nMid-\nIceland region. Cartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nAtlantic\nRidge\nto start the creation of seamounts at that location. Add a hot\nspot to the same location to enhance by substantial amounts that\nquantity of molten rock, thereby building a fine volcanic island in\nthe North Atlantic Ocean. It is noteworthy that the Hawaiian Islands\ncombine the movement of continental drift over a hot spot that\nover a few million recent years has switched on and off. Thus, the\nIceland. Cartography by Ian Scroggs.\nfixed hot spot has produced several Hawaiian Islands as continental\ndrift has moved them along. In contrast, apparently due to the\nconditions of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Iceland has remained in a fixed location even as the ocean floor spreads\napart. For instance, note that the Faroe Islands to the east have moved progressively in that direction. 280 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAlong with volcanoes, Iceland has several other geothermal\nlandscape features. The most famous thermal site, the Blue\nLagoon, actually is a manmade pool created from water out of the\nadjacent geothermal heating plant. The country\u2019s five geothermal\nheating plants produce about \u00bc of the island\u2019s\nelectricity. Furthermore, these plants contribute heating and hot\nwater for about 7\/8thof the country\u2019s needs.\nThe term geyser is derived from the Icelandic word geysir. Hot\nsprings, geysers, and mud pools are found in Iceland. Overall\nthough, volcanoes are the big dynamic features of this country.\nThere are about 130 volcanoes on the island with several being\nactive still. Eighteen volcanoes there have erupted since the year\n871. Lakagigar erupted in 1873 causing devastation and killing\n10,000 people. Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull blasted in 2010, sending so much\nash into the atmosphere that air travel through the region was\ncanceled for several weeks.\nAnd yet, Iceland has glaciers. In fact, its largest glacier or ice cap\nis Vatnajokull, the area of which is three times the size of Rhode\nIsland. The island has 269 named glaciers. It does snow in Iceland.\nGlaciers are formed by large amounts of snow, compressing into\nPhoto by Jeff Sheldon on Unsplash ice over long periods of time. In February 2017, the capital city\nReykjavik took in twenty inches of snow, a record for that\nmonth. Generally, more snow occurs in the northern regions of the island and in higher altitudes. Some areas,\noften including Reykjavik, receive only modest snowfalls. However, over the centuries snowfall and cold weather\ndid allow the creation of numerous glaciers.\nAdd a volcanic eruption to a glacier and you may get a j\u00f6kulhlaup, an abrupt torrent of water like a river that\nmoves with great speed and force. When a volcano has been capped by a glacier, but returns to activity, an\neruption will suddenly melt the glacier, releasing vast amounts of water to flow downhill.\nGlaciers and flowing water have created waterfalls in\nIceland, such as Go\u00f0afoss, seen in this photo.

Still, if someone identifies as\n\u201cliberal,\u201d or \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d you can probably make a few guesses about his or her political ideals.\nTraditionally, academics speak of political ideology with the terms left (liberal), center (moderate), and right\n(conservative). We can add nuances to that political spectrum. Someone who is \u201cfar right\u201d is very conservative,\nwhile someone who is \u201cfar left\u201d is very liberal. And sometimes the prefix \u201cultra\u201d is applied to extremists (the Nazis\nwere \u201cultraright,\u201d and the Bolsheviks was \u201cultraleft\u201d). Someone who is center-left is a moderate who leans liberal;\nsomeone who is center-right is a moderate who leans conservative.\nTo give you a sense of the spectrum, consider the following American politicians: Bernie Sanders perhaps best\nexemplifies the political left. Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden are examples of the center-left. Barack Obama was on\nthe left as a senator, but as president he governed more from the center-left. Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney are\nexamples of the center-right, while Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are examples of the right.\nth\nFor the second half of the 20 century, Europe was dominated by left and center-left governments (and, of\ncourse, the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe was dominated by far-left governments). This move to the left was\nstimulated by a few factors. One was a reaction against the far-right fascists governments that had launched\nWorld War II, and who were responsible for the atrocities of the Holocaust. Another was a reaction against a social\n283 284 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nclass system that had been relatively rigid for centuries. And the move to the left was further fueled by the anti-\nestablishment, youth-driven countercultural movements that swept through much of the world in the 1960s.\nLeft and center-left governments were hardly uniform in nature but, in general, they promoted the following:\n\u2022 Higher wages for the working class, and other labor rights.\n\u2022 Increased environmental responsibility, such as pollution reduction, sustainable development, and shifts\nto renewable energy sources.\n\u2022 Increased immigration to offset the consequences of an aging population.\n\u2022 Better social safeguards for the general population, including generous public pensions, free or low-cost\nhealth care and education, and expansive social welfare benefits.\n\u2022 Increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy to pay for these social programs.\n\u2022 A commitment to solving political crises with diplomatic solutions, rather than military solutions.\n\u2022 Stronger integration into the Common Market and, later, the European Union.\nThe left has not completely disappeared in Europe, of course, but beginning in the 1980s, and dramatically\naccelerating in the 2000s, the left and center-left began to face some serious challenges, including:\n\u2022 A fear of mounting public debt, coupled with a perception that the right\u2019s policy of cutting government\nspending would solve the debt issue.\n\u2022 A fear that increased immigration was taking jobs away from native citizens, and that immigration was\ndestroying the unique national cultures of individual countries.\n\u2022 The automation and outsourcing of manufacturing and primary sector jobs. This eroded membership in\nlabor unions, which were traditionally major supporters of the left.\n\u2022 An aging population. As people get older, usually their political ideology grows more conservative. Europe\nhas a lot of old people. It has comparatively few young people.\n\u2022 A backlash against high taxes and strong government regulation of the economy. This is similar to\n\u201cReaganomics\u201d in the United States and its political descendant, the Tea Party.\n\u2022 A backlash against the increased power of the European Union.\nAs a result, many countries in Europe have seen the rise of right and center-right governments, which promote:\n\u2022 Relaxed environmental, labor, and financial regulations.\n\u2022 Strong restrictions on immigration.\n\u2022 \u201cAusterity\u201d measures, such as lower taxes and lower government spending\n\u2022 Stronger militaries\n\u2022 Euro-skepticism: a desire to limit the power of the European Union or, in the case of Britain, a campaign\nto leave the EU entirely.\nPerhaps the biggest factor in the rise of the right has been anti-immigrant sentiment. This is not dissimilar\nto the political groundswell that sent Donald Trump to the White House. President Trump had many different\npolicies and proposals, of course, but certainly his pledge to \u201cBuild the Wall\u201d was one of the most resonant. Anti-\nimmigration voters overwhelmingly lean right, and some of Europe\u2019s emerging far-right parties, such as France\u2019s\nNational Front, are almost entirely fixated on reducing immigration. EUROPE: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 285\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nth\nMargaret Thatcher was the longest-serving British prime minister in the 20 century, and was the first woman to hold that position. CHAPTER 60\nEurope: Population Geography II\nNegative Population Change\nIn the fifth stage of the Demographic Transition \u2013 wait the fifth\nstage! Yes, remember that some scholars add a fifth stage to the Demographic Transition while others consider\nnegative population change to be an especially matured portion of the fourth stage or post-industrial stage of\nthe Demographic Transition. Probably the crux of this distinction between late fourth stage and new fifth stage\nrests on the permanence or length of time that countries spend with naturally declining birth rates. Note that\nnatural increase refers to differences between birth rates and death rates, but does not include migration. When\nincluding migration, it is possible for a country with more deaths than births to increase in overall population, as\nlong as in-migration sufficiently exceeds out-migration.\nHow does a country reach this point of negative population change? Throughout history there have been\nnumerous occasions where a country or a kingdom or a duchy or a principality or a tribal land (whatever the\nterritory) suffered short term losses. A hard-fought war with the deaths of many soldiers and even civilians may\ntally so many deaths that these losses outnumber the births in the society. When over twenty million people died\non the Soviet side of World War II, the population of the USSR dropped from 196 million in 1941 to 170 million in\n1946. During war time, births may be artificially suppressed as well. Do you recall the young American woman\u2019s\nfamous response to the question, \u201cWhy did births increase after World War II?\u201d She simply said, \u201cThe men came\nhome.\u201d\n286 EUROPE: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 287\nGrave medical circumstances may be sufficient to cause deaths to exceed births, though like war these\nconditions generally are short term. The Black Death in Europe definitely caused kingdoms and cities and\neverywhere to decline in population, overall in Europe by about 50% in 1347-1351. These countries and regions\nof Europe recovered, eventually regaining this population by adding more births than subtracting deaths. In Sub-\nSaharan Africa, AIDS has killed millions of people, where in some countries 25% of adults were HIV+. Even so, in\nthese African countries, births outnumbered deaths.\nShort term economic or political crises may jam a country\u2019s population. In the 1990s after the breakup of the\nUSSR, socioeconomic chaos in Russia prompted couples to defer births while at the same time death rates rose.\nThis produced negative population change in Russia.\nWhile these factors may intervene in a country\u2019s natural demographic progress, eventually it is the population\u2019s\nstructure \u2013 age and gender\/sex \u2013 that develop the conditions that produce fewer births than deaths. Specifically,\nthe age structure of the population has direct effects on births and deaths.\nWith the decline in death rates in Stage 2 of the Demographic Transition, we begin to keep people alive longer.\nAs advancements in medicine and agriculture continue, sometimes at starling rates, life expectancy increase\nthroughout Stage 3 and 4 and in Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition. With the decline of birth rates in Stage 3\nof the Demographic Transition, modern, urban, industrial societies prompt lower and lower birth rates in Stages 4\nand 5. 288 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThus, we find that countries currently in the fifth stage of the Demographic Transition have population\nstructures holding numerous older people and relative fewer young people. This pattern is revealed in the\ninverted population pyramid that is standard for this stage. Women in their retirement years no longer are\nphysically able to conceive and bear children. Old men can sire children, but must have considerably younger\nfemale partners to do so. Older populations are likely to have particularly lower birth rates.\nWhile medicine and food supply are sufficient, even plentiful, in Stage 5 counties, the elderly populations\neventually do die. Although these deaths do not challenge the high numbers of war or plague, the deaths do\noutnumber births in these settings.\nAdvanced, modern, urban, industrial countries that long have worked through the normal development of\ncountries \u2013 where are these places? Having been first to the Industrial Revolution, Europe has most of the\ncountries in Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition. As the chart below indicates, of the countries in the world (not\ncounting microstates nor territories) that have negative natural population change, all but Japan are in Europe or\n1,2\nthe Russian Domain.\nNEGATIVE POPULATION CHANGE\nCountry Natural Population Change\nBulgaria -6.00%\nLithuania -5.00%\nLatvia -4.90%\nSerbia -4.70%\nUkraine -4.20%\nHungary -3.90%\nCroatia -3.60%\nRomania -3.30%\nGermany -3.20%\nBelarus -3.20%\nGreece -3.10%\nEstonia -2.80%\nRussia -2.70%\nJapan -2.40%\nPortugal -2.40%\nItaly -2.00%\nBosnia and Herzegovina -1.40%\nMoldova -1.40%\nCzech Republic -1.30%\nPoland -1.20%\nSlovenia -0.70%\nSlovakia -0.30%\nAustria -0.20%\nSpain -0.20%\nWill it last? This is a key question for Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition. Perhaps this simply is a variation of EUROPE: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 289\nStage 4 that someday will return to the more normal situation of births outnumbering deaths. Population scholars\nst\ndo anticipate that the world\u2019s overall population will slow and likely hit a plateau near the end of the 21 century.\nTotal fertility rates have been declining. How low will these rates go? A fascinating study in the British medical\njournal The Lancet projects population totals to the end of this century. It suggests that total world population\nwill peak in the year 2064 at 9.732 billion people. It asserts that a number of countries already have met their\npopulation apex for the century and perhaps forever. Here are European examples.\nAPEX\nCountry Apex Year Population that year (in millions) Population in 2100\nEstonia 2017 1.31 0.82\nPoland 2017 38.39 15.42\nGreece 2017 10.4 5.48\nSpain 2019 46.39 22.91\nAgain, population structure may intervene. Countries that long have had low birth rates, with or without higher\ndeath rates, have small numbers of women now in their main childbearing ages. Low birth rates twenty-five years\nago mean small numbers of men and women now twenty-five years old. Even if these women showed higher than\nexpected total fertility, the raw numbers of births might be insufficient to offset the deaths of the older population.\nConsider the math. One million women having 2.1 births a piece makes 2.1 million births replaces that generation\nand may offset a low death rate, indeed 2.1 million deaths. Three hundred thousand women having 4.0 births a\npiece makes 1,200,000 births, but fails to offset the same 2.1 million deaths. The less numerous cohort will be\nreplaced, but in the meantime, the much older population dies and the overall population declines.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nOn a joint television broadcast between Boston and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) in 1986, Lyudmila Ivanova replied to a question about\nsex by saying, \u201cThere is no sex in the USSR \u2026 .\u201d The rest of her sentence was cut off by laughter. Perhaps she said \u201con television\u201d or \u201conly\nlove,\u201d but the moment was unforgettable. In the Soviet Union on television, there was no sex depicted or even inferred.

CHAPTER 61\nEurope: Urban Geography II\nTallinn, Estonia\n\u201cIf geography is prose, maps are iconography.\u201d\n\u2022 Lennart Meri \u2013 the second president of Estonia, 1992-2001\nTallinn is the capital city of Estonia, a small Baltic country with a\nstriking historical mix in recent decades of communism followed by\ncapitalism and Russia\/USSR followed by independence. Tallinn\nitself displays a remarkable contrast between its well-preserved\nOld Town and its modern European city center.\nAnthropologically, we know that settlement in this strategic\ncoastal location in Northern Europe began before 3000 BC;\nhowever, historical reference to a named town did not occur until\nth\n1219 BCE. Until the 20 century, the town and eventually the city\nwas known as Reval, originally a Danish-language place name\nreflecting Danish territorial control.\nWhen Estonia became independent in 1918 (for the years\nbetween world wars), the city was re-named Tallinn, an Estonian\nlanguage reference to its fortified walls, as \u2013linnais a suffix meaning\ncastle or fortification.\nth th\nThe medieval fortifications began in the 10 or 11 century on\nthe city\u2019s limestone plateau (or hill) known as Toompea. Early on,\nthese fortifications provided shelter and defense as needed, but\nwere not used for habitation. The structures that now define\nth\nTallinn\u2019s Old Town mainly were built originally in the 15 and\nth\n16 centuries.\nKiek-in-de-K\u00f6k, Tallinn \u2013 Photo by Julius Jansson on\nUnsplash\n291 292 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nReval (again, the early name for Tallinn) was\nprimarily under Danish control from 1219 forward one\nth\ncentury. In the late 13 century, Reval joined the\nprofitable and influential Hanseatic Trading League\n(Hansa meaning fleet), where Estonian trade peaked in\nth\nthe prosperous 15 century. However, Denmark sold\nsome of its northern European lands, including Reval,\nto the German Order (also known as the Teutonic\nKnights). This brought German influence and culture\nto Reval.\nThe Livonian War of 1558-1583 brought Russian,\nTallinn Town Square. Photo by Jorge Franganillo on Flickr. Swedish, and Polish interests into the region. In the\nearly part of the war in 1561, Tallinn sided with\nSweden. This allegiance remained true until 1710. During the Livonian War, those buildings inside the fortification\nremained intact, while many structures outside the wall and in the lower town were destroyed. Although saved\nfrom war, much inside the protection of the upper town walls was ruined by the Great Fire of 1684.\nThe Northern War of 1700-1721 again brought Russian forces to Reval, as the city capitulated in 1710. Under\ntsarist rule initially by Peter the Great, the city developed industrially and renewed its harbor\u2019s role in trade. In\n1870 rail service between Reval and St. Petersburg was established, increasing Reval\u2019s economic links with the\nRussian Empire.\nWorld War I and the Bolshevik Revolution signaled the end of the empire\u2019s hold on Reval and the region.\nBrief intra-war German presence passed with the German failure to win the war. In the post-war diplomatic\narrangements, Estonia became an independent country. One of the first steps of independence was the change\nof the capital city\u2019s name from Revalto Tallinn. During the years of Soviet rule after World War II, Estonians viewed\nthis interwar independence as a golden age. By 1939 the population of Tallinn reached 145 thousand, amidst avid\ndays of Estonian cultural expression.\nIn the secret protocol attached to the Molotov-Rippentrop Pact (non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union\nand Nazi Germany), the Baltic States were placed within the Soviet sphere of influence. This set up the Soviet\nannexation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in 1940. However, in 1941 the Nazis attacked the USSR anyway and\nin August of that year they occupied Tallinn. Eventually in September 1944, Soviet forces regained the city. While\nthere was war damage to Tallinn, most of the Old Town remained intact.\nDuring Soviet days, Tallinn benefitted from the close ethnic links between Finns and Estonians. Their Finno-\nUgric language family, shared with Hungarian and scattered small ethnic groups like Sami peoples, brings the\nability to understand both languages. Easy transport from Helsinki, Finland, to Tallinn brought exposure to\nWestern culture, as did Finnish TV broadcasts, understood and received in Tallinn. The Baltic States were at the\nforefront of the movement to end the Soviet Union and to create multiple new independent countries. Through\nthe Singing Revolution (non-violent opposition to Soviet rule and censorship), Estonians propelled this drive for\nindependence and attained it in 1991. EUROPE: URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 293\nOld Town of Tallinn \u2013 Photo by Ilya Orehov on Unsplash\nSince gained sovereignty, Estonia and Tallinn as its capital city and focal point have pushed freedom, liberty,\ndemocracy, and capitalism forward quickly and forcefully. Tallinn is visited by over four million tourists yearly.

CHAPTER 62\nEurope: Overview\nPHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY\nThe idea of Europe as a continent separate from Asia is a somewhat arbitrary European concept. In reality,\nEurope is a series of peninsulas on the western edge of a large landmass called \u201cEurasia.\u201d Europe\u2019s southern,\nnorthern, and western boundaries are relatively easy to detect. The southern boundary is the Mediterranean Sea;\nthe northern boundary is the Arctic Ocean, and the western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean. Europe\u2019s eastern\nboundary is more difficult to define. The boundary between Europe and Asia is really more of a cultural\/historical\ndistinction than a physical one. Conventionally, Europe\u2019s southeastern boundary with Asia is marked by the\nAegean Sea, the Black Sea, and the small sliver of water that links the two \u2013 a waterway that passes through Turkey\nknown as the Bosporus (technically speaking, the small triangle of land west of Istanbul is in Europe, while the rest\nof Turkey is in Asia). The rest of Europe\u2019s boundary with Asia is usually defined, moving from south to north, by\nthe Caucasus Mountains, the Caspian Sea, the Ural River, and the Ural Mountains. Notice that our discussion of\nhow this fits with Russia will be in our chapters on the Russian Domain.\n296 EUROPE: OVERVIEW 297\nLANDFORMS\nEurope\u2019s physical regions are generally placed in three categories: lowlands, uplands, and alpine regions.\nLowlands, as you might guess, are flat areas of low elevation. Alpine regions are mountainous areas with very high\nelevations. Uplands are something in between \u2013 areas that are at significantly lower elevations than the alpine\nregions, but that are by no means flat, containing areas of hills, low mountains, and eroded plateaus.\nEurope\u2019s upland regions are concentrated in three major areas \u2013\nthe northern European uplands, the central European uplands, and\nthe southern European uplands. The northern European uplands\nare found in the northern British Isles, primarily in Scotland, and on\nthe Scandinavian peninsula, which is shared by Norway and\nSweden. Although the elevations are relatively low here, the\nnorthern uplands contain some of Europe\u2019s most spectacular\nscenery. Europe\u2019s central uplands extend in an arc from\nsoutheastern France, across southern Belgium and Germany, and\ninto the Czech Republic. Europe\u2019s southern uplands are found on\nthe major peninsulas that extend south into the Mediterranean\nSea: The Iberian Peninsula, occupied by Spain and Portugal; the\nItalian Peninsula; the Balkan Peninsula, which extends across\nSunrise on the rock of Gibraltar. Photo by Mark\nsoutheastern Europe from the Black Sea to the Adriatic Sea; and\nFreeth on Flickr.\nthe Greek Peninsula, which extends southward from the Balkan\nPeninsula. Like the northern and central uplands, these are areas\nof relatively modest elevations, but which are dominated by rugged landscapes.\nEurope\u2019s alpine regions are divided into three primary mountain\nranges, each running roughly east-to-west across the heart of\nEurope. These are areas of extremely rugged landscapes and very\nhigh elevations, some extending above 18,000 feet. They include\nthe Pyrenees, which run along the border between France and\nSpain; the Alps, which dominate the landscapes of Switzerland and\nAustria, and which also spill over into Italy, France, Germany, and\nSlovenia; and the Carpathians, a crescent-shaped mountain range\nthat runs from the Polish-Slovak border, through western Ukraine,\nand across much of northern Romania.\nLowland regions can be found scattered throughout Europe \u2013\nparticularly along its major rivers, but Europe\u2019s largest lowland Pyrenees. Photo by Iris Vallejo on Pixabay.\nregion, and its most extensive landform region overall, is the North\nEuropean Plain. The North European Plain is a huge triangle of\nlowlands running from the Atlantic Ocean, across northern Europe, and all the way to the Ural Mountains. Part of\nit is north of the English Channel and Baltic Sea, including the southern British Isles, southern Sweden, and nearly\nall of Finland. It runs continuously across northern France, northern Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and\nnorthern Germany, and includes nearly all of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. It then broadens to include\nnearly all of the European part of the Russian Domain. Its physical landscapes would be familiar to any\nMidwesterner. Like the Midwest, some of it is remarkably flat, while other sections have a gently rolling landscape. 298 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThere are a few hills scattered throughout the region, but elevations are generally very low. The North European\nPlain contains Europe\u2019s most important industrial cities and its most densely populated rural areas. Unfortunately,\nbecause its flatness offers few natural defenses, it has also been the setting for some of the most vicious fighting\nin Europe\u2019s wars.\nCLIMATE\nEurope\u2019s climate patterns are relatively simple. There are only three major climate regions, and all three are similar\nto climates found in the United States. The first is the Marine West Coast climate. It dominates northwestern\nEurope, including Ireland, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, most of France, the western coasts of mid-latitude\nScandinavia, and the northern coast of Spain. It is a somewhat colder version of the climate found in the United\nStates\u2019 Pacific Northwest. The temperature patterns feature warm to mild summers. The winters range from cool\nto cold, but these places are warm relative to other places at such high latitudes. London, for example, is located\nabout 700 miles farther north than Chicago, but it rarely experiences winters that are nearly as cold. That is\nbecause this is a maritime climate (see Chapter 41). The temperatures are moderated year-round by air masses\nthat are driven off the Atlantic by the westerlies. As for precipitation, this part of Europe is generally wet year-\nround, with slightly higher precipitation in summer. This is also because of the westerlies, which drive moisture in\noff the Atlantic Ocean year-round, giving places like London a deservedly soggy reputation.\nA second major climate region is the Mediterranean climate,\nwhich is named for the Mediterranean Sea. This is the climate of\nsouthern Europe, and is similar to the climate of southern\nCalifornia. It is the dominant climate of Portugal, Greece, and most\nof Spain and Italy. This climate can also be found all along the\nMediterranean coast, such as the southern coast of France. The\ntemperature patterns of this region feature warm to hot summers,\nand cool but generally mild winters, with temperatures moderated\nby the influence of the Mediterranean Sea. Perhaps the most\ndistinctive feature of this climate is its precipitation pattern.\nPorto Katsiki, Greece.\nSummers are dry, and sometimes virtually cloudless. (It is no\nPhoto by Paul Gilmore on Unsplash.\ncoincidence that the Italian and French Riviera is one of the most\npopular tourist destinations on earth.) The dry summers are\ncaused by the huge sub-tropical high that dominates the Sahara Desert. It shifts north in the summer and settles\non this region. Like California, winters are noticeably wetter, as the subtropical high shifts back off to the south,\nand the westerlies sink south to bring moisture in from the Atlantic.\nEurope\u2019s third major climate is humid continental, which is the same climate found in the Midwestern United\nStates. This climate dominates central and eastern Europe, including most of Germany and Scandinavia, and\neastern Europe from Poland to Bulgaria. This climate features warm summers and cold winters, with temperature\nextremes increasing with distance from the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean. This area is not quite as\nrainy as northwestern Europe, but is generally wet year-round, with maximum precipitation in summer.\nThere are a few smaller climate regions in Europe, including a semi-arid steppe climate in central Spain. Sub-\narctic and arctic climates are found in northern Scandinavia, featuring brief, cool summers and long, bitter winters.\nFinally, there is a thin band of humid-subtropical climate from northern Italy to Serbia, which is similar to the U.S.\nSouth, featuring hot summers, cool winters, and high precipitation year-round. EUROPE: OVERVIEW 299\nHISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY\nTThhee RRiissee,, FFaallll,, aanndd RReebbiirrtthh ooff EEuurrooppee\nThe earliest evidence of human activity in Europe dates back about 40,000 years, and some of the first urban-\nbased civilizations evolved there around 3000 BCE. In many ways, though, Europe traces its cultural roots to the\nClassical Period. Focused on ancient Greek civilizations (which peaked in the 400s to 300s BCE) and ancient Rome\n(which peaked between the 200s BCE and 400s CE), the Classical Period was an era of rapid development. In many\nways, these cultures poured the foundations for Western civilization, and can be viewed as the beginning point for\nEuropean ideas about engineering, politics, art, warfare, religion, and language.\nFor centuries, Rome largely dictated the economic and political order of Europe. When Rome declined and fell,\nEurope plunged into economic and political chaos. What followed was a period known as the Middle Ages (or\nMedieval Period \u2013 medieval meaning \u201cmiddle\u201d), which lasted from around the 500s to the 1300s. This period is\nalso sometimes referred to as the \u201cDark Ages.\u201d That term implies that, after centuries of enlightenment, Europe\nplunged into cultural darkness. That is overstating it a little, but certainly Europe experienced a stagnation in\ntechnological, economic, and cultural progress.\nThe political and economic system that dominated the Middle Ages was known as the feudal system.\nEuropeans, desperate for security, delivered their fate into the hands of a warrior class, known as the aristocracy\n(or nobility). Europe fragmented into hundreds of small feudal estates. On these estates, all of the land was owned\nby, and the political system controlled by, a member of the aristocracy. The aristocracy held ultimate power over\nthe vast majority of the rural farming population, who were known as serfs (or peasants). The aristocratic ruler\nand his army provided security for the serfs. In exchange, the serfs toiled in the fields and pledged their loyalty\nto the feudal aristocrat. The aristocracy often led lavish lives within their castle strongholds, while most serfs lived\nshort, miserable lives in abject poverty.\nIn some cases, a feudal estate was totally independent from any higher authority, notably in Germany and\nItaly, which were made up hundreds of small baronies and principalities (the tiny modern-day countries of\nLiechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, and Andorra are all holdovers from the period). In other cases, these feudal\nestates would bind together into larger kingdoms, often with a complex hierarchy of aristocrats aligned beneath a\nmonarch.\nThe term Renaissance means \u201crebirth,\u201d and the period that followed the Middle Ages has long been 300 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ncharacterized as a rebirth of the ideals and ambitions of the Classical Period. This movement, which began in\nItalian cities like Florence, Milan, Rome, and Venice in the 1300s, involved a rapid acceleration in technological\nand economic development. The spirit of the Renaissance soon spread from Italy to much of the rest of southern\nEurope \u2013 notably to Spain and Portugal \u2013 and then soon to much of the rest of the continent. It was a revolutionary\ntime for European science, politics, commerce, and the arts. Europe entered the 1300s as a second-rate region.\nOver the next few centuries, it would emerge as a center of global power, partly because of the evolution of a new\neconomic system.\nCapitalism slowly replaced feudalism in the late Middle Ages. Feudalism, based on the aristocracy\u2019s ownership\nof pretty much everything of value, and the obligation of the serfs to work for them, was replaced by a system\nwhere private property abounded, and individuals competed with one another for profit. Capitalism stemmed\nfrom dramatic improvements in European agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation, and from the rise of\nthe merchant class.\nDuring Europe\u2019s Middle Ages, merchants were a group of modest wealth. They purchased whatever excess\ngoods the farmers and artisans produced, and sold them for a profit. These profits were meager, however,\nbecause most of Europe\u2019s population was poor, and limited transportation restricted the pool of potential\ncustomers. That changed around the 1300s. Now, farmers and artisans had more to sell, the population had\nmore money to spend, and improving transportation greatly expanded prospects for imports and exports. The\nmerchants of European cities coordinated and profited from local, then regional and, eventually, global trade.\nSoon, some of Europe\u2019s merchants were becoming as wealthy and powerful as the aristocracy.\nThe merchant class were not a cooperative group, but a competitive one. So, a merchant was always on the\nlookout for new goods to buy and new customers to sell them to. This is an important element of capitalism.\nIt is both a very powerful and a very \u201chungry\u201d economic system. Competition forced each merchant to supply\nmore, better, and cheaper goods. Capitalism is not without its flaws (see Chapter 56), but there is no doubting its\npower. This new economic system contributed to the growth of European technology, commerce, and trade, and\nis fundamentally responsible for the region\u2019s emergence as a global power.\nEExxpplloorraattiioonn,, CCoolloonniizzaattiioonn,, aanndd IInndduussttrriiaalliizzaattiioonn\nIn the 1400s, Portuguese ships began sailing down the coast of Africa, establishing trading outposts along the way.\nBy 1488, Portuguese ships had rounded the southern tip of Africa, and were establishing sea trade with India, and EUROPE: OVERVIEW 301\nmany points beyond, like Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. Portuguese ships were soon transporting a huge volume\nof goods from Africa and Asia to Europe. Europe was on its way to dominating global sea trade.\nIn 1492, Christopher Columbus, an Italian navigator working for the Spanish government, proposed the idea\nof reaching Asia by sailing west across the Atlantic. This, famously, led to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the Americas. Soon,\nPortuguese, French, British, and Dutch ships were also exploring this \u201cNew World.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s first colonial period, which began around the early 1500s, involved the colonization of the Americas.\nBrazil was colonized by Portugal, and Spain colonized most of the rest of mainland Latin America. North America\nwas colonized by Spain, Britain, and France, and the Caribbean was colonized by numerous European countries.\nThe first colonial period resulted in a flood of wealth for the European colonizers, and helped speed the region\ntoward the Industrial Revolution.\nIn the late 1700s, the United States became the first European colony to gain its independence, followed by\nmost of the other major colonies in the Americas during the 1800s. Despite this independence, most of the\nAmericas remained dependent upon European markets, investors, and factories for a century. And no country in\nthe Americas, even the United States, could rival the military and economic might of the great European empires\nth\nuntil the 20 century.\nThe most important event that led to Europe\u2019s global dominance was the Industrial Revolution. Beginning in\nBritain in the early 1700s, the Industrial Revolution was the birth of mass production \u2013 the rise of the factory. It\nwas made possible by advances in science and technology, the wealth created by exploration and colonization,\nand the appetite for products created by capitalism. Soon, Britain was producing goods with a speed and\nabundance previously unimaginable, and the country was on its way to becoming the world\u2019s first global economic\nsuperpower. It reinvested much of its profits into creating the world\u2019s most powerful navy, which aided its further\ncolonial expansion. The Industrial Revolution soon spread to much of the rest of western Europe.\nIndustrialization gave Europe the desire and ability to launch a second colonial push, this time focused on Africa\nand Asia. The Industrial Revolution exponentially increased the capitalist economies appetite for raw materials\nand markets. It also gave Europe the wealth, technology, and military firepower to seize those raw materials and\nmarkets.\nIt is not coincidental that the world\u2019s first industrial power would become the world\u2019s largest empire. Britain set\nout to colonize much of Africa and Asia. At the height of the British Empire, one in four people on earth were ruled\ndirectly from London. Many more countries would fall into the British sphere of influence, and were informally\ncolonized. A prominent example is China, which saw huge amounts of its territory and population fall under de\nfacto British rule for more than a half-century. It is remarkable to consider that, of the world\u2019s ten most populous 302 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ncountries, five of them \u2013 India, the United States, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh \u2013 were once formally ruled\nby Britain. At one point, it was possible to travel from Cape Town, South Africa, all the way to Baghdad, Iraq, and\nnever leave a British colony. That\u2019s a journey of over 7,000 miles (it\u2019s only about 3,000 miles from Boston to Los\nAngeles).\nOther major imperial powers of this era included the Netherlands, which colonized Indonesia; France, which\ncolonized much of Africa and Indochina (modern-day Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos); and Russia, which expanded\nacross Asia to the Pacific. Belgium, Germany, Portugal, and Italy also had significant colonial possessions in Africa.\nIn 1900, Europe was the center of global power. Nearly all of Africa and Asia was controlled directly or indirectly\nby a European empire. Nearly all global trade took place on European ships. With the exception of emerging\nindustrial powers like Japan and the United States, Europe had a near monopoly on manufacturing. No country\ncould challenge the military supremacy of the major European powers. Now, more than a century later, Europe is\nstill a wealthy, influential region, but it is no longer dominates the world. This is not because some other region\nconquered Europe, but because Europe conquered itself in two devastating world wars.\nCCoonnflfliicctt,, DDiivviissiioonn,, aanndd UUnniifificcaattiioonn\nWorld War I began in 1914. It was, at first, a regional conflict between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nHowever, a complex web of military alliances, geopolitical ambitions, old grudges, and rising nationalism soon\nplunged the entire continent into war. Germany and the Ottoman Empire sided with Austria-Hungary, while\nBritain, France, and Russia sided with Serbia.\nWorld War I was the first major conflict to fully employ industrial technology. Machine guns, poison gas, tanks,\nand aircraft were used extensively for the first time. The \u201cAllies,\u201d those countries aligned with Britain and France,\nth\nemerged victorious in 1918. The war ended on November 11 (a date that was, for many years, commemorated\nin the United States as \u201cArmistice Day,\u201d now called \u201cVeterans Day\u201d). More than 19 million people were killed in\nthe war, and it substantially rearranged the map of Europe. Germany was defeated, suffering a significant loss of\nterritory and economic ruin. Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire collapsed. From the ruins of the Ottoman\nEmpire emerged the modern state of Turkey. Both Greece and Bulgaria gained territory from the Ottomans, and\nAlbania gained its independence. Austria and Hungary split into two independent countries, and lost territory to\nItaly and Romania. The newly independent state of Czechoslovakia also emerged from former Austro-Hungarian\nterritory. Another newly independent state was Yugoslavia. Meaning the \u201cLand of the Southern Slavs,\u201d Yugoslavia\nconsisted of Serbia and the small Slavic nations of Bosnia, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Montenegro.\nIn the closing days of the war, the Russian tsar was overthrown by revolutionaries, and Russia would become\nEurope\u2019s first communist state, later called the \u201cSoviet Union.\u201d In the chaos, Russia lost control of Finland, Latvia,\nLithuania, and Estonia, all of which became independent. Finally, a newly independent Poland emerged from\nformer Russian and German territory.\nIn the 1920s, many countries in Europe, particularly the imperial powers of the west, returned to prosperity. A\nfew countries, particularly Germany, Italy, and some of the newer states in eastern Europe, were not so fortunate.\nWhen the Great Depression struck in 1929, the economic and political situation in those countries declined even\nfurther.\nOut of this chaos rose a new political movement known as fascism. Europe\u2019s first fascist leader was Benito\nMussolini of Italy. He popularized the term fascism, which is derived from \u201cfasces,\u201d an axe that served in ancient\nRome as a symbol of power and unity.\nFascism arose because of, and not in spite of, the political and economic chaos in some European countries.\nIn fact, fascist movements (and those like them) always arise in times of crisis. In a time of great insecurity and\nweakness, leaders who promise stability and strength, even at the cost of democracy and freedom, are often\nviewed favorably. Mussolini was one such leader. He promised to restore the glory of Italy as he chipped away at EUROPE: OVERVIEW 303\nItalian democracy. Mussolini\u2019s success in Italy inspired the rise of Adolf Hitler and the fascist Nazi Party in Germany\nwho, likewise, promised to bring order and strength to their country. In the 1930s, fascist movements also seized\npower in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Spain.\nFascism is characterized by authoritarianism, oppression, and militarism. But perhaps its most notorious\ncharacteristics are ultra-nationalism and racism. Nationalism, when taken to extremes, can go to some very dark\nplaces, and no fascist party took nationalism to a more disturbing place than the Nazi Party. Hitler characterized\nthe German people as part of a supposed Aryan race, the supreme beings on the planet. Anyone else \u2013 Asians,\nAfricans, Slavs, Roma, and Jews \u2013 were characterized as untermenschen, or inferior humans.\nThe Jews, in particular, suffered greatly under Nazi rule. Hitler was looking for someone to blame for Germany\u2019s\neconomic troubles, and Jews became a handy target. Ultimately, six million Jews \u2013 nearly two-thirds of Europe\u2019s\nJewish population \u2013 would be systematically murdered by the Nazis and other fascists. Large numbers of other\nsupposed untermenschen \u2013 Roma, Slavs, gay people, political dissidents, and the mentally and physical disabled \u2013\nwere also murdered.\nThe Nazis believed that Germany was the supreme nation on the planet, and \u201clogic\u201d followed that Germans\nshould therefore control the planet. Hitler aspired to nothing less than global domination. World War II would\nformally begin on September 1, 1939. For a detailed look at the geography of World War II, see Chapter 50.\nAfter World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union, allies during the war, suddenly became adversaries.\nIn the early days of the Cold War, British prime minister Winston Churchill referred to a metaphorical \u201ciron curtain\u201d\nthat had descended across Europe, dividing it between East and West.\nWhen World War II ended, Soviet troops occupied eastern Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania,\nand Bulgaria. They all became satellite states of the Soviet Union, and were considered part of the \u201cEast.\u201d\nThey were members of a Soviet-dominated military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact, and their governments\nembraced Soviet-style communism. Although nominally independent, they were largely under the control of the\nSoviets. Any notions of real independence were crushed in Hungary in the 1950s, and again in Czechoslovakia in\nthe 1960s. On both occasions, protestors demanding economic and political reforms were brutally suppressed by\nSoviet forces. These countries would not escape the grip of Moscow until the late 1980s.\nYugoslavia and Albania found themselves in an unusual position during the Cold War. They were both\ncommunist states, having been controlled by communist revolutionaries at the end of World War II. Their\neconomies and governments were modeled after the Soviet Union, but they hadn\u2019t been occupied by Soviet troops\nwhen the war ended. As a result, they were not satellite states, and their governments enjoyed more sovereignty\nthan those of the Warsaw Pact. Still, because of their adherence to communism, they were usually regarded as\npart of the East.\nThe rest of Europe, including major economic powers like Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany, made up the\n\u201cWest.\u201d They were all capitalist countries, and most of them were democracies. Much of western Europe would join\nthe United States and Canada in a military partnership known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\nThe NATO countries were declared opponents of Soviet communism. Some states in the West \u2013 Ireland, Sweden,\nFinland, Spain, Switzerland, and Austria \u2013 did not join NATO, but were generally more supportive of American\npolicies than Soviet ones.\nGermany was divided into two states throughout the Cold War. When World War II ended, British, French, and\nAmerican troops occupied the western two-thirds of Germany. These areas would become the capitalist country of\nWest Germany. The Soviet Union occupied the eastern third of the country, which became the communist satellite\nstate of East Germany. Berlin was a microcosm of Germany. Although it was located deep in the communist east,\nthe western half of the city was a tiny enclave of capitalist West Germany. To prevent East Germans from escaping\nto the West, the Soviets quickly built a series of heavily guarded barriers around West Berlin. In the early 1960s,\nthese smaller barriers were replaced by a massive wall, called by the Soviets the \u201cAnti-Fascist Protective Rampart,\u201d\nbetter known simply as the \u201cBerlin Wall.\u201d It was a physical manifestation of Churchill\u2019s iron curtain and, for many,\ncame to symbolize the Cold War. 304 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn 1989, the Soviet Union\u2019s satellite states began to break from Soviet control. The Berlin Wall was torn down,\nand Germany reunified. In 1990, the Baltic States of the Soviet Union (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) began to\nopenly defy Moscow. In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed, bringing an end to the Cold War.\nth\nThe World Wars dominated much of the first half of the 20 century, and the Cold War dominated much of\nth\nthe second half. 2021 will mark the 30 anniversary of the end of the Cold War. The last three decades have\nbeen generally peaceful in Europe, and probably the most significant event has been the trend toward European\nunification.\nIn 1951, six European countries \u2013 West Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg \u2013\nfounded the European Coal and Steel Community. It eliminated tariffs (import and export taxes) on coal and steel\namong the member states. This free trade agreement was so successful that in 1958, the same six countries\nformed the European Economic Community, better known as the Common Market. The Common Market took\nthe idea behind the coal and steel agreement, and expanded it to include all products. Now, anything could be\nimported or exported among the member states without tariffs. The Common Market proved to be so beneficial\nthat many other countries moved to join. Denmark, Ireland, and Britain joined in the 1970s. Greece, Portugal, and\nSpain joined in the 1980s.\nIn 1993, the Common Market was replaced by the European Union (EU). The Common Market\u2019s goal of\neconomic integration continued, but its mission was expanded to include political unification. In the 1990s, Austria,\nSwitzerland, and Finland joined, followed in the 2000s and 2010s by all of the former Soviet satellite states in\neastern Europe, as well as three former Soviet republics \u2013 Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia,\nand Croatia also joined.\nCULTURAL GEOGRAPHY\nLLaanngguuaaggee\nMost of the languages in Europe are part of the Indo-European language family, and are derived from the same\nlinguistic source as the languages of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern India, and Bangladesh. Within the Indo-\nEuropean family are several subfamilies \u2013 languages that are relatively close \u201ccousins,\u201d and have much in common.\nThe \u201cbig three\u201d language subfamilies in Europe are Romance, Germanic, and Slavic. The languages of the\nRomance subfamily evolved from the language of the Romans \u2013 Latin. Romanian, Spanish, Italian, French, and\nPortuguese are all Romance languages. The Germanic languages include German, Dutch, English, Danish, Swedish,\nIcelandic, and Norwegian. The Slavic subfamily includes Serbo-Croatian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Russian, Ukrainian,\nBelarusian, Polish, Macedonian, and Czech.\nThere are a few smaller subfamilies of Indo-European in Europe. The Baltic subfamily includes Latvian and\nLithuanian. The last holdouts of the Celtic language subfamily are found in Brittany (northwestern France),\nCornwall (southwestern England), Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. A few people in these places speak Breton,\nCornish, Welsh, Irish, or Scottish as their first language, but nearly everyone in those areas also speaks English\n(or in Brittany, French). Greek and Albanian are also Indo-European, and are the only languages in their individual\nsubfamilies.\nThe only other major language family in Europe is the Uralic family. Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian are all\nUralic languages, and are similar to one another, but very different from the Indo-European languages, since they\noriginated from a different source. EUROPE: OVERVIEW 305\nEEtthhnniicciittyy\nMost European countries are nation-states, dominated by one national group, but there are a few multi-national\nstates in the region. Belgium consists of two primary national groups. The Flemings, who speak a dialect of Dutch,\noccupy the northern half of the country, called Flanders. The Walloons, who speak a dialect of French, occupy the\nsouthern half of Belgium, called Wallonia. Bosnia has three major national groups. The largest are the Bosniaks,\nMuslim Slavs who account for about 48% of the country\u2019s population. The other two groups, the Serbs (37%) and\nCroats (14%), are culturally related to the peoples of neighboring Serbia and Croatia. Montenegro has a similar\nmixture of Montenegrin, Serb, Bosniak, and Albanian. Britain consists of an English majority, and the smaller\nnations of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Cornwall.\nMany of Europe\u2019s nation-states contain significant minority populations. This is partly due to the shifting political\nmap of Europe. Countries have unified and dissolved, and war has shifted boundaries. As a result, some individual\nlocations pass from country\u2019s control to another, often leaving members of a European nation cut off from their\nnation-state.\nThere are also some ethnic groups who have been minorities in Europe for centuries, but who have retained\ntheir distinctiveness \u2013 their own languages, cultural customs, and separate ethnic identity. Examples include the\nSaami, about 80,000 people who live in northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia; and the Basques, about 2\nmillion people who live in northeastern Spain and southwestern France. Many European countries used to have\nsignificant Jewish populations, but today there are only about 2 million Jews in Europe, mainly in France and\nBritain.\nThe Roma are an ethnic group that can be found in many, if not\nmost, European countries. Informally called \u201cGypsies\u201d (although\nthat term is usually regarded as derogatory), the Roma trace their\nancestry to northern India, and began to arrive in Europe in the\n1400s. Because they were not permitted to own property in many\nEuropean countries, they developed a tradition of being itinerant \u2013\nthat is, moving from place to place in family caravans to settle\ntemporarily. Today, there are about 7 million Roma in Europe. They\nare dispersed throughout the continent, but are especially\nprevalent in southeastern Europe.\nFinally, Europe\u2019s ethnic patterns are becoming more complex as\nGypsy Caravan. a result of immigration, primarily from Africa and Asia. Europeans\nPhoto by Wendy Corniquet from Pixabay. sometimes joke about \u201ccolonization in reverse,\u201d since many\nimmigrants move to the European country that had once colonized\ntheir home country. Indeed, there are many Algerians in France,\nIndonesians in the Netherlands, and Indians in Britain, to name a few.\n(For a discussion of European religion, see Chapter 48).\nPopulation\nExcluding Turkey and the Russian Domain, Europe\u2019s total population is approximately 544 million. The six largest\ncountries account for two-thirds of the region\u2019s population: Germany (81 million), France (66 million), Britain (65\nmillion), Italy (61 million), Spain (46 million), and Poland (38 million). Thirty-six smaller countries account for the\nremaining third of the region\u2019s population.\nEurope\u2019s regional TFR (total fertility rate) is 1.6, meaning the average European woman has one or two children 306 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nin her lifetime. That is well below the replacement rate of 2.1. In fact, every country in Europe is below replacement\nrate. The highest TFR in Europe is in France (2.0), and the lowest is in Portugal (1.3). As a result, the region has an\noverall rate of natural increase that is negative. Factoring out migration, Europe\u2019s net population change, based\nstrictly on births and deaths, is -0.2% per year.\nSuch numbers are typical of a region that is deep into the final stage of the Demographic Transition. Europe\u2019s\npopulation is wealthy, highly urbanized, and very well-educated, so people tend to get married later in life, and\nhave few, if any, children. There are significant consequences of such population stagnation and decline. One is\nthat Europe\u2019s population is aging rapidly, so the countries of the region must devote more resources to elder care\nand pension funds. Another consequence of population decline is the threat of economic stagnation. Every time\na European couple decides not to have a child, that is another future worker, consumer, and tax payer that is not\nbeing produced. Put simply, it is very difficult to maintain economic growth without population growth.\nEuropean countries have attempted to offset population decline with increased immigration, but it has not\nalways gone smoothly. The backlash against immigration in Europe has sometimes been quite severe, and has led\nto rising social tensions and political crises in some countries.\nPOLITICAL GEOGRAPHY\nDDeemmooccrraaccyy\nFull democracies are countries where free elections are the norm, where dissent against the government is\ntolerated, and a free press is active. Full democracies also feature the \u201crule of law,\u201d where a set of laws, approved\nby the people, apply equally to everyone. Partial democracies are countries that have democratic features, such\nas elections, but also some serious flaws in the democratic process. Such flaws often include suspect elections,\ngovernment intimidation of the press and opposition politicians, and frequent constitutional changes meant to\nbenefit the ruling party.\nEurope is one of the most democratic regions in the world. The vast majority of countries are full democracies,\nwhere free elections and rule of law are the norm. The Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Norway, Denmark,\nand Iceland, in particular, are often cited as the world\u2019s most democratic countries. For now, only two European\ncountries \u2013 Albania and Bosnia \u2013 are broadly considered to be partial democracies. It is worth noting, however,\nthat recent political trends in Hungary and Poland have some fearing they may drop off of the \u201cfull\u201d democracy\nlist, and onto the \u201cpartial\u201d democracy list.\nTThhee EEuurrooppeeaann CCoonnssttiittuuttiioonn\nThe ultimate goal of the European Union is political unification. If that is ever accomplished, the EU will be a sort\nof \u201cUnited States of Europe.\u201d In the United States of America, each of the fifty states has its own government, local\nlaws, and constitution, and enjoys a good deal of independence. Still, each state is bound by the rules of the U.S.\nConstitution, is subject to the decisions of the Supreme Court, and is subordinate to the federal government in\nmatters where the constitution grants it power over the states. If the EU reached full political unification, it would\nbe something quite similar. The individual member countries would still exist, would have their own governments,\nlocal laws, and constitutions, but they would be bound by the rules of the European Constitution, the European\nCourt, and subordinate to the European Parliament in Brussels. EUROPE: OVERVIEW 307\nIn 2004, it appeared that Europe was well on its way to achieving these goals. An enormous step forward was\nsupposed to be the adoption of a common European Constitution. Some of the goals of the constitution were\npractical \u2013 the EU was governed by a complex web of treaties, which would have been replaced by a single, simpler\ndocument. It also allowed for more legislation to pass through the European Parliament by simple majority, rather\nthan unanimous consent, streamlining the process. But there was an important symbolic goal, as well. If voters in\nall member states ratified the constitution, it was seen as a huge milestone in the journey toward genuine political\nunification.\nAfter it was drafted, the constitution needed to be ratified by all of the member states. The countries that\njoined the EU after 1993 had already ratified the constitution as part of their membership process. By 2004, it had\nbeen ratified in national referendums in Spain and Luxembourg. In 2005, however, voters in both France and the\nNetherlands stunned Europe by voting \u201cno\u201d on the adoption of the constitution. Because unanimous consent of\nall member states was required to ratify the constitution, it was effectively dead in the water. All the remaining\nmember states cancelled their ratification votes.\nIn 2007, representatives from the EU\u2019s member states unanimously adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, which largely\naccomplished all of the practical goals of the constitution. Still, the symbolic importance of the constitution\u2019s failure\nwith French and Dutch voters was the first sign that not everyone in Europe was happy with the EU\u2019s goal of an\n\u201cever closer union.\u201d\nEEUU MMeemmbbeerrsshhiipp\nCurrently, there are twenty-seven member states of the European Union (there had been twenty-eight prior\nto Britain\u2019s exit in 2020). Six additional countries have applied for membership, and are currently under\nconsideration: Serbia, Montenegro, Iceland, Macedonia, Turkey, and Albania. A seventh, Bosnia, has applied to\njoin, but is not yet officially under review.\nAfter countries have applied for membership, and are officially recognized as candidates, they must go through\na review process that can take years. Poland, for example, applied to join the EU in 1994, and was not admitted\nuntil 2004. To become a member, countries must demonstrate a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, and\nhuman rights. They must also have a stable free-market economy.\nIt is worth noting that every time a country has joined the EU, some citizens in each country opposed the move.\nWhile there are clear benefits to being a member, a country that joins the EU is handing a lot of control over\nits political and economic destiny to the EU. In fact, a pair of countries that could easily become members have 308 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ndeclined to join. Norway and Switzerland are both prosperous, capitalist democracies, but they have elected not\nto join. At the same time, some countries are desperate to join the EU, and have not met with success. Turkey\nactually applied to join the EU in 1987 (back when it was still the Common Market), and still hasn\u2019t been admitted.\nThere may be some legitimate political and economic reasons for Turkey\u2019s failure to be admitted. If Turkey did join\nthe EU, it would be, by far, the bloc\u2019s poorest country. Turkey also hasn\u2019t exactly demonstrated the commitment\nto democracy and human rights that the EU demands. Still, Turkey is suspicious that there is a more nefarious\nreason why it hasn\u2019t been admitted.\nNo country can become an EU member without unanimous consent. That means that, to join the EU, a\ncandidate country must meet the approval of every single existing member. One \u201cno\u201d vote, and that country does\nnot get in. It is quite probable that at least one country in the EU privately opposes Turkish membership, most\nlikely Greece or Bulgaria, which were ruled for centuries by the Turks, and still harbor some hostility toward them.\nGiven the lingering animosity between Croats and Serbs, Serbia has every reason to be nervous about the same\noutcome now that Croatia is a member.\nTThhee FFuuttuurree ooff tthhee EEuurrooppeeaann UUnniioonn\nFor years, the Common Market and its successor, the European Union, seemed like almost flawless ideas. The\neconomies of member states were surging. The core values of the EU \u2013 political unification, free trade, open\nborders, and equal rights \u2013 seemed to be accepted by most voters in Europe. Then, in 2004, the constitution\nwas rejected by French and Dutch voters. In 2008, an economic crisis in Greece demonstrated some of the EU\u2019s\neconomic flaws.\nToday, the EU is facing crises in almost every corner of the union. Russia has ramped up efforts to shatter\nthe EU through political and economic gamesmanship. In southern Europe, economies are stagnating, and many\ncountries have required economic bailouts from the EU. In eastern Europe, democratic institutions are eroding\n\u2013 Hungary\u2019s to the point that some argue it no longer qualifies as a democracy. In northern and northwestern\nEurope, a backlash against immigration has given rise to political parties that oppose the EU. Even supporters of\nthe EU have acknowledged that the union may have been too ambitious, and gotten too big too fast.\nOf course, the greatest blow to the EU has been Brexit \u2013 the exit of Britain, the EU\u2019s second-largest economy,\nfrom the union. The Brexit process began back in 2016, when the country held a referendum on the country\u2019s\nfuture in the EU. Voters has two choices \u2013 they could select \u201cRemain\u201d or \u201cLeave.\u201d It was a political gamble by then-\nPrime Minister David Cameron. Cameron wanted Britain to remain in the EU, but the chorus of euro-skeptics had\ngrown so loud that he decided to let the British voters voice their opinion (feeling fairly confident that they would\nelect to \u201cRemain\u201d).\nThose who supported the \u201cLeave\u201d campaign argued that the EU was crumbling economically, while the British\neconomy was thriving. They argued that Britain should redirect its political and economic alliances away from\nEurope and toward the United States. They railed against EU bureaucracy as bloated and ineffective. They argued\nthat the EU Parliament and European Court were undermining British sovereignty. And, most effectively, the\n\u201cLeave\u201d campaign said that EU membership left Britain unable to control immigration.\nIn a shocking result, British voters narrowly supported \u201cLeave\u201d over \u201cRemain,\u201d by a 52% to 48% margin. It was a\nnon-binding referendum, and a political circus ensued over what Britain should actually do. In the end, though, the\nBritish government respected the decision of the voters, and Britain formerly exited the EU on January 31, 2020. It\nhas until the end of 2020 to negotiate what its future relationship with the EU will be.\nTime will tell what those negotiations bear out. Britain would very much like to retain all of the economic\nbenefits of membership, such as remaining in a free-trade zone with the EU, without any of the financial or political\nresponsibilities of being a member. It is unlikely that the EU will be so generous. Many British business owners\nand politicians are deeply fearful for Britain\u2019s economic future. If it cannot hammer out a trade deal with the EU, EUROPE: OVERVIEW 309\nthen the prices of products imported to Britain from EU countries will increase dramatically. At the same time, and\nfor the same reasons, demand for British products in Europe could collapse, creating an economic catastrophe for\nBritain. Still, Britain\u2019s economy could thrive. If it does, then it might inspire other countries to exit the EU. If Britain\nfalls on its face, economically speaking, it could reinforce for EU members the importance of remaining part of the\nunion.\nECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY\nDDeevveellooppmmeenntt\nEurope enjoys one of the world\u2019s highest standards of living. Of the region\u2019s thirty-seven major countries, thirty-\none have overall standards of living that are well above the global average. Six countries \u2013 Montenegro, Bulgaria,\nSerbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, and Albania \u2013 have more modest overall standards of living, but even those countries\nare wealthy by global standards.\nAA PPoosstt--IInndduussttrriiaall EEccoonnoommyy\nLike the United States, Europe is evolving into a post-industrial society. Agriculture and manufacturing are still\nimportant to the European economy, but those industries are employing fewer people than in generations past.\nOf the world\u2019s ten leading agricultural exporters, six of them (Germany, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium,\nand Italy) are located in Europe. Agriculture in Europe, however, is highly mechanized, so it employs a relatively\nsmall percentage of the workforce.\nEurope is also a major manufacturing region. Germany, Britain, France, and Italy all rank in the top ten globally\nin manufacturing output. European manufacturing tends to be high-tech, such as electronics, automobiles,\ncomputer hardware, robotics, telecommunications, aerospace, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. These sorts of\nindustries are highly lucrative, but not terribly labor-intensive. As a result, a dwindling percentage of Europeans\nwork in manufacturing.\nAlso like the United States, more and more European jobs are found in the tertiary (service) and quaternary\n(information) sectors, such as transportation, health care, banking, sales, advertising, legal services, consulting,\nresearch, media, education, tourism, and social services. As in the United States, the new economy has created\na large number of high-paying white-collar jobs, but it has also decimated a lot of well-playing blue-collar jobs in\nmanufacturing and agriculture. As a result, the middle class is declining as the wealthier and poorer classes grow.\nTThhee EEccoonnoommyy ooff tthhee EEuurrooppeeaann UUnniioonn\nThe primary economic goal of the European Union remains the same as that of the old Common Market when\nit was founded back in the 1950s: economic integration. In other words, the EU is trying to take twenty-seven\nindividual national economies and integrate them into one large economic market. Once again, it is helpful to\nconsider the United States. The U.S. may have fifty individual state governments, but generally speaking, there are\nvery few mechanisms that prevent the movement of goods, people, and money across state borders. The EU\u2019s\nambition is to have a similarly integrated market.\nOne of the great economic liabilities of many European countries is a relatively small population. Of the twenty-\nseven member states of the EU, twelve have populations that are smaller than that of the Chicago metropolitan 310 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\narea. Ireland, for example, has about half as many people as Chicagoland. The combined populations of Europe\u2019s\nfive largest countries \u2013 Germany, France, Britain, Italy, and Spain \u2013 is still smaller than that of the United States.\nFor European countries, that means a small domestic market. Consider Sweden, which is home to about 10\nmillion people. Sweden has long been a major manufacturer, but its small population is a liability. There is simply\nno way that major Swedish manufacturers can survive only selling their products to the 10 million people who live\nin Sweden. So, Sweden relies on the export market \u2013 especially in Europe. The problem was that, prior to Sweden\u2019s\njoining the EU, as soon as Swedish products were exported to another country, the exporter had to pay a tariff (an\nimport tax) to that country\u2019s government. That made Swedish manufactured goods more expensive, which meant\nfewer of them sold. This was the primary reason why Sweden joined the EU.\nThe EU\u2019s market is massive. Its economy is worth $19 trillion annually (second only to the United States), and it\nhas a population of nearly 450 million people (behind only China and India). By joining the EU, Sweden could avoid\ntariffs when exporting products to other EU countries. When Sweden finally joined in 1995, its home market was\nsuddenly forty-five times larger.\nThat\u2019s why many countries were eager to join the EU. Membership in the EU meant that a country\u2019s banks could\nnow loan money to a larger pool of people. Businesses could sell to a much larger market. Consumers had a much\nwider range of options to choose from, which usually meant products of higher quality and lower cost. And the EU\nencouraged Europeans to buy products from other European companies (rather than, say, Japanese or American\nones), so European wealth stayed in the European market.\nAnother appealing thing about EU membership is a common currency. Before 1999, every EU country used its\nown national currency. France had the franc, Germany had the mark, Italy had the lira, and so on. In 1999, the euro\nbecame the official currency of eleven EU countries. Any country that had joined the EU after 1993 was required\nto adopt the euro once they hit certain monetary benchmarks. (Those that joined before 1993 were allowed to opt\nout \u2013 only Britain and Denmark chose to do so). Today, nineteen countries have adopted the euro. Another seven\nmembers are expected to adopt it eventually.\nUsing multiple currencies in a single market is impractical, and tends to reduce trade volume. By adopting a\nuniform currency, trade within Europe was not only more practical, but it began to increase. Having a larger pool\nof currency also tends to reduce interest rates and inflation rates, both of which are economically beneficial. And,\nby adopting the euro, the European Union created a rival for the U.S. dollar, which had dominated global currency\nmarkets for decades. That had given the U.S. enormous leverage over the global economy, a benefit the EU now\nenjoys as well.\nFinally, the EU attracted new members because of its willingness to invest in economic development throughout\nthe region. The EU funds infrastructure and economic development programs in Europe\u2019s poorer regions,\ninvesting in transportation, communication, utilities, technology, schools, and banks.\nTThhee EEUU\u2019\u2019ss RReeaalliittyy CChheecckk\nEven after the constitution failed in 2005 and the political future of the EU became unsettled, the economic future\nof the EU still looked bright. Then, in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, the EU began to face serious\neconomic problems. In 2009, Greece announced that it was in danger of defaulting on its loans. For years, the\nGreek government had been borrowing heavily, ostensibly for economic development programs. In reality, Greece\nwas plugging holes in its budget. Greece had kept taxes low, and had a serious problem with tax evasion, yet it\nhad increased spending. At first, this was not a serious problem because, like much of the rest of the EU, the Greek\neconomy was booming. Then, when the global financial crisis hit, Greece\u2019s economy collapsed, and the Greek\ngovernment found that it couldn\u2019t make its loan payments.\nHad the EU allowed Greece to default on its loans, it likely would have destabilized the euro, caused massive\nbank failures, driven up interest rates, and made an already gloomy European economic situation even worse. So, EUROPE: OVERVIEW 311\nthe EU agreed to provide Greece with a bailout to keep it from defaulting. In exchange, the Greek government\nagreed to enact drastic spending cuts and tax increases \u2013 a move which punished working class Greeks far more\nthan it punished the politicians and business owners who had caused the crisis.\nAs you can imagine, the bailout was not terribly popular in the countries that provided most of the funds for the\nbailout, like Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Sweden. And, to the horror of the taxpayers in those\ncountries, they soon learned that Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain were in a situation similar to Greece, and\nwould eventually require bailouts themselves.\nThis was the EU\u2019s \u201creality check.\u201d Despite the high degree of economic unification that had come with the EU, the\nindividual governments within the union were still able to borrow and budget as they wished. It was clear that, for\nthe EU to avoid another round of bailouts, it would need to enact stricter rules for member countries. But that is\nsomething few countries have been willing to embrace, since it represents an erosion of their sovereignty.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nPrior to the evolution of the nation-state, most European countries were ruled by a monarch, and many European monarchs were related\nto one another, and often ruled countries where they weren\u2019t born. One is example is Catherine the Great. Catherine is now remembered as\nEmpress of Russia, and one of the most successful and longest-tenured rulers of that country. But Catherine wasn\u2019t actually Russian. She was\na German princess who married into the Russian royal family (and then orchestrated her husband\u2019s overthrow). Her cousin was the King of\nSweden. Catherine\u2019s direct descendants include Prince Charles, the current heir to the British throne; Queen Margrethe II, the current queen\nof Denmark; King Willem-Alexander, the current king of the Netherlands; and King Felipe VI, the current king of Spain.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCorniquet, Wendy. 2015.

CHAPTER 63\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR)\nHow do we define this region?\nRegional geography studies the people and places of a cohesive region. A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared characteristics over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nIn some cases, the determination of a geographic region is simple. South America obviously is an intact\ncontinent, but also possesses many shared features in a variety of geographic categories. In contrast, the region\nof North Africa and the Middle East (or Southwest Asia and North Africa) is very problematic to create, define, and\nlimit.\n312 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR) 313\nAt first glance, the Caribbean may appear to be straightforward\nto compile as a region. There are logical ways to define Latin\nAmerica as a region. How do we put them together?\nAmerica. To be blunt, that narrows the region quite a bit. We\nare not talking about Europe or Asia or wherever. Historically, the\nNew World, the Americas.\nLatin. The Latin language has long been a dead language; that\nis, a language that is no longer spoken. However, there are several\nmodern languages that are heavily based on that earlier Latin\nlanguage. Principally, these modern languages include French,\nSpanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian. These are European\nlanguages, so they must be brought to the Americas. Historically,\nItaly had colonies, but in Africa, not in the Americas. Romania did\nnot have colonies. France, Spain, and Portugal had colonies\naround the world, including in the Americas. So, where in the\nAmericas do we currently find French, Spanish, or Portuguese as\nnational languages?\nSouth America:\n\u2022 Portugal \u2013 Brazil\n\u2022 French Guiana \u2013\nFrance\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen \u2022 Spanish \u2013\nVenezuela,\nColombia, Chile,\nEcuador, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay\n\u2022 Exceptions \u2013 Dutch in Suriname, English in Guyana\nCentral America:\n\u2022 Spanish \u2013 Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Panama\n\u2022 Exception \u2013 English in Belize\nCaribbean islands:\n\u2022 Spanish \u2013 Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico (partly)\n\u2022 French \u2013 Haiti, Martinique, Guadalupe, St. Barts, St.\nMartin, Dominica, St. Lucia\n\u2022 Exceptions \u2013 English in the Commonwealth Caribbean European Colonies in South America.\nCartography by Steven Banas\n(Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada,\nJamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the\nGrenadines, Trinidad and Tobago), in British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin\nIslands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos), in Sint Maarten, and in US territories (US\nVirgin Islands and partly in Puerto Rico) and Dutch (and Papiamento) in Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Saba, 314 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSint Eustatius, and parts of Sint Maarten.\nOf course, along with language, the French, Spanish, and Portuguese conquerors and settlers brought many other\naspects of culture, economy, and politics with them. We see these elements, mixed to varying degrees with native\ncultures, throughout Latin America.\nContiguity. For the South American landmass, it is simple to count it as part of Latin America. For the Latin-\nbased languages, there are only two exceptions \u2013 Dutch in Suriname and English in Guyana. Can either of those\nsmall countries be placed in any other region? Europe? Obviously not. Europe is on the other side of the Atlantic\nOcean. In any sense Caribbean? No, both border the Atlantic Ocean directly, not the Caribbean Sea. As both\ncountries are contiguous within South America, while not being contiguous with any other region, both must be\ncounted as part of Latin America, thereby making all of South America to belong in South America.\nIn Central America, we have a similar situation. Only Belize, an English-speaking country, fails to fit the Latin\nheritage. Belize too fails the contiguity test. There is no other region for Belize to fit. All of Central America goes\ninto Latin America.\nAll right then, what about the Caribbean islands? This is a more difficult situation to assess. Other than some\ncontributions to the Papiamento language, the Portuguese played almost no role in the Caribbean. The islands\ncontrolled by the Spanish and the French easily are outnumbered by the islands colonized by the English and\nthe Dutch. Would we want to designate some of the Caribbean islands into Latin America, while excluding other\nCaribbean islands? That would be awkward. If some Caribbean islands are excluded, then into what region are\nthey placed? Could Jamaica and the Bahamas be included in North America? With North America being defined\nas the United States and Canada, two huge land areas, it would seem awkward to add small island countries to\nthat exclusive group.\nWhat else can be done with these islands? The compromise is expressed in how we state the name of the\nregion \u2013 Latin America aanndd the Caribbean (LACAR). The word \u201cand\u201d indicates that these two regions are not the\nsame single region, while the grouping into one phrase infers that there is a broader connection between these\ntwo regions. Outside of North America, together these regions are the lands of the New World that were explored,\nconquered, and settled by European colonial powers, of both Latin-based and other languages, while mixing with\nnative populations to a significant degree (unlike in the United States and Canada, where the concept of mestizo, a\nperson of mixed native and European parentage, is unfamiliar).\nOverall then, Latin America and the Caribbean comprise two related sub-regions that are expressed well\ntogether. The countries and territories of this combination are gathered together based on contiguity, Latin-based\nlanguages, and European colonial acquisitions in the New World.\nDDIIdd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe Bahamas, Bermuda, and the British Turks and Caicos islands technically are not Caribbean islands. These sets of islands are located\nnortheast of Cuba and east of the Carolinas and Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. Should these islands be designated as part of the Caribbean\nregion? As has happened in other cases, the questions of contiguity and \u201cWhere else?\u201d pop up. The Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos island\nsets are adjacent to the Caribbean islands. Bermuda is closer to North Carolina. Since islands by definition do not touch each other, we use the\nstandard of adjacency instead of contiguity. Could the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Turks and Caicos fit into any other region? Again, the only\nother option would be North America, seemingly an awkward fit. Thus, everyone places the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Turks and Caicos in\nthe Caribbean, not in North America.

In\naddition to the question of region, consideration of the Netherlands Antilles is made more complex by its colonial\nhistory and politics.\nFirst of all, Caribbean islands are divided into two regions \u2013 the Great Antilles and the Lesser Antilles, as based\non area (though population is correlated to area). Then within the many islands of the Lesser Antilles, there\nare several that have a colonial history and a current affiliation with the Netherlands. This sub-region was the\nNetherlands Antilles.\nAdditionally, Americans forget that the Dutch, who are the people of the Netherlands, were significant explorers,\ntraders, and colonizers. Americans surely recognize the exploration, trade, and colonization done by the British,\nthe French, and the Spanish. Perhaps noting that Brazilians speak Portuguese, Americans may observe that the\nPortuguese were big in these fields as well (in Africa and elsewhere too). Many Americans do not know or forget\nthat before New York was part of the British colonies of America, New York was a Dutch colony named New\nAmsterdam. In fact, the Dutch sailed to many corners of the world \u2013 naming New Zealand, developing the city\nBatavia (that is now the capital city Jakarta in Indonesia), taking islands in the Caribbean, and more. Thus, it is that\nmany people are unaware of the Dutch presence in the Caribbean.\nThe Dutch came to the Caribbean Sea and to the nearby mainland of South America where they also secured\nthe territories cited as the Dutch Guianas. Eventually, the Netherlands lost some of these lands to the British,\nretaining only Suriname that much later became an independent country in 1975.\n316 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): REGIONAL EXAMPLE 317\nThe set of islands of the Netherlands Antilles progressively\nchanged political status in relationship with the Netherlands. OK,\nthis set of islands consisted of Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura\u00e7ao (the so-\ncalled ABC islands), as well as Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint\nEustatius. (Sintis the Dutch word for Saint.) The island St. Maarten\nis shared with the French and also known as St. Martin. Let\u2019s call\nthese the 3S islands. The Dutch briefly held a few other islands, like\nTobago, but lost control, mainly to the British.\nNetherlands Antilles 1986. Public domain.\nSt. Maarten Island.

The two groups are over 600 miles apart. (Though in a much\nsmaller way, this separation is reminiscent of the spatial gap between West Pakistan and East Pakistan before they\nbecame Pakistan and Bangladesh respectively.)\nThe ABC islands sit off the coast of South America. In fact, Aruba\nis only nine miles from the Venezuelan Paraguana Peninsula.\nThese islands naturally pick up some of the elements of South\nAmerican culture.

The next\nchallenge is that Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao have large enough populations to consider independence. As many colonies\naround the world and from various colonial empires sought independence, especially in the 1960s, it is reasonable\nthat Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao would examine this choice too.\nAruba was the first to go. Although the issue of independence was broached in the 1930s, a local referendum\non the issue did not take place until 1977. After several years of consideration, Aruba reached a deal with the\nNetherlands that in 1986 Aruba would achieve the status of a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This\nis a curious designation with some similarities to the British Commonwealth. The original agreement held the\ncondition that Aruba would become a fully independent country in 1996, but this provision later was eliminated.\nNoting that Cura\u00e7ao is bigger than Aruba both in area and in population, it is understandable that Cura\u00e7ao also\nwould consider its options. However, in 1993 an island referendum resulted in declining both options that Aruba\nhad taken. In 2005, in a new referendum, islanders voted to have Cura\u00e7ao gain the status of country within the\nKingdom.\nAs the third most populated of these Dutch islands, St. Maarten too sought the designation of country within the\nKingdom. Negotiations amid all six islands and the Dutch kingdom persisted until in 2010 constitutional changes\nwere made official. The current situation remains the same as that final agreement. As made in the official\nstatement of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs:\n\u201cThe Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of four autonomous countries: the Netherlands, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao and\nSt Maarten. The latter three are located in the Caribbean. The country of the Netherlands consists of a territory\nin Europe and the islands of Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatius in the Caribbean. The Kingdom of the Netherlands\n1\ntherefore has a European part and a Caribbean part.\u201d\nIt is a complex settlement that seems to be working adequately. There are odd circumstances that\nremain. Bonaire, Saba and St. Eustatius all use the American dollar as their currency, instead of the Euro. Aruba\nhas its own Aruban florin for currency, while Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten use the Netherlands Antillean guilder.\nRights within the European Union for all six islands and their residents is still another story.\nOverall then, the Netherlands Antilles is no more, though the term often is used popularly to describe the subset\nof the Lesser Antilles.

Without shared language,\nthe ability to communicate is impossible, thus eliminating the opportunity for people to belong together as a\ngroup or as a nationality (or in the terms of political geography, as a nation). Often new languages are learned\nin order for people to communicate in different countries, for purposes of travel, trade, and diplomacy. A second\nlanguage that is favored for these purposes is known as a lingua franca; in fact, English commonly works in this\nway internationally.\nIn other settings, languages evolve or even merge elements in order for different peoples to live together in\nthe same location. Examples here include Creole languages that are mixtures of African languages and usually\nEuropean languages. Typically, these Creole languages were developed as the result of colonialism. Papiamento\nis one such Creole language.\nPapiamento (sometimes Papiamentu) is a Creole language spoken in the Netherlands Antilles. (Note the\nRegional Geography discussion of the political standing of Caribbean islands of the Netherland Antilles.)\nWhile Spanish presence in the Caribbean began with the voyages of Christopher Columbus, other countries\nsoon followed in seeking land and riches. Portuguese involvement here is clear, perhaps a bit of British\n320 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 321\ninvolvement; however, Dutch presence began with possession in 1634 and was maintained through to the current\nflexible political and economic connections.\nThe term Papiamento is derived from the Portuguese and Spanish shared casual term papia or papear, meaning\nto talk.\nContributions to Papiamento language are numerous. In Cura\u00e7aofor instance, the native Caquetio peoples\nwere present in modest numbers when Spanish explorers first arrived in 1499. As often was the case, exploration\nbrought conquest. Undoubtedly, elements of the native language were used in initial conversation between\nCaquetio and Spanish people; however, there is little of this native tongue in modern Papiamento.\nIn 1634 Dutch forces captured Cura\u00e7ao, bringing control, as the Dutch West Indies Company, that also entailed\nlinguistic and cultural elements. The Dutch soon lost their territories in Brazil, increasing Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s importance\nfor Dutch presence in the region. In fact, there was some migration of people from Dutch Brazil to Cura\u00e7ao. A\ncurious bit of history is that this flow of people included numerous Sephardic Jews.\nFor this merger of languages to fall into the Creole category, African languages must be part of the mix.\nHistorically, this occurred through the slave trade. The European slave trade from Africa to the New World has\nbeen estimated a 12.5 million people. Over those many years, perhaps a half million of these slaves were brought\nby the Dutch to Cura\u00e7ao, some to pass on to other locations, but some to stay. Thus, we have the introduction of\nAfrican languages to Cura\u00e7ao, filtering as well to other Dutch sites in the Caribbean. These Dutch transits as well\nas slaves from areas of Portuguese influence in the Cape Verde islands and the continental Guinea-Bissau region\ncontributed substantially to the development of Papiamento.\nModern-day Cura\u00e7ao uses Papiamento as one of its official languages, along with Dutch and English. In Aruba,\nit is Papiamento and Dutch. In Bonaire, Dutch with regional Papiamento. The Aruban version of Papiamento is\nconsidered one dialect, as slightly different than that used in Bonaire and Cura\u00e7ao.\nTake a chunk each from Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch.

CHAPTER 66\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Economic\nGeography I\nOrigins of Economic Disparity\nOne of the defining characteristics of Latin America is the enormous income gap that exists between the region\u2019s\nwealthy and the region\u2019s poor. One way that geographers measure disparity is with the 20\/20 income ratio. That\nratio takes the average income of the wealthiest 20% of a country\u2019s population, and compares it to the average\nincome of the country\u2019s poorest 20%. Here are some 20\/20 ratios for a selection of countries around the world:\n\u2022 China 12:1\n\u2022 United States 8:1\n\u2022 France 6:1\n\u2022 Turkey 5:1\n\u2022 Japan 3:1\nIf you take the average incomes of Japan\u2019s wealthiest 20% and their poorest 20%, the wealthy earn about three\n323 324 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\ntimes more than the poor. The gap in the United States is much wider \u2013 the wealthiest 20% are eight times\nwealthier than the poorest 20%. Still, between 3:1 and 12:1 is a typical ratio for many countries around the world.\nBut not in Latin America. Here are the 20\/20 rations for a selection of the region\u2019s countries:\n\u2022 Colombia 25:1\n\u2022 Brazil 22:1\n\u2022 Guatemala 20:1\n\u2022 Chile 16:1\n\u2022 Mexico 13:1\nThese are pretty typical numbers for Latin America. So, is Brazil a wealthy country? Yes. Brazil is home to a lot of\nvery wealthy people. Is Brazil a poor country? Yes. Brazil is home to a lot of very poor people. And the middle class\nthat falls between the rich and the poor is very small. The same can be said for most countries in Latin America.\nThis disparity exists for three primary reasons. One is the historic lack of industrialization. The foundation of\nth\nthe European and American urban middle classes in the 20 century were millions of well-paying manufacturing\nth\njobs. Since Latin America didn\u2019t industrialize much during the 20 century, that middle class never materialized.\nAnother reason for Latin America\u2019s economic disparity is the historic lack of democracy. Consider the United\nStates. In 1932, Americans suffering in the Great Depression swept Franklin D. Roosevelt to power in hopes that\nhis New Deal would rescue the economy. In 1980, voters suffering from the recession of the 1970s elected Ronald\nReagan with similar hopes. Republicans and Democrats still debate the merits of the New Deal and Reaganomics,\nbut the simple fact that Americans can elect governments that listen to their economic concerns is significant. In\nmany Latin American countries, that was not the case until the 1990s, and in some countries, it\u2019s still not the case.\nThe primary reason for economic disparity in Latin America, however, is the legacy of economic institutions\nestablished during the colonial period. The primary goal of colonization was to extract as many raw materials\nas possible. Spanish and Portuguese colonizers wanted to harvest minerals, timber, and agricultural products in\nLatin America and ship them back home. This was by no means a partnership with the indigenous people. Native\nAmericans either moved onto very marginal land, or served as labor on farms and mines.\nA fundamentally important trait of the colonial economies were large rural estates. Wealthy Spanish and\nPortuguese colonizers acquired vast tracts of land \u2013 particularly land that had the best soil and\/or most available\nresources. Poorer European migrants were, like the Native Americans, either forced onto marginal land or worked LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 325\nthe land owned by the wealthy. The colonial economy revolved around three different economic institutions \u2013\nhaciendas, plantations, and mines.\nThe word hacienda refers to a large rural estate, or to the large house occupied by the owner of such an estate.\nHaciendas were usually located in the interior highlands, such as the Brazilian Highlands, the Andes, Mexico\u2019s\nCentral Plateau, or the Central American Highlands. These farms grew a variety of grains and raised livestock\nto feed the people of Latin America\u2019s cities, missions, plantations, and mines. A hallmark of a hacienda was\nsharecropping.\nThe owners of the haciendas rarely worked the land themselves \u2013 sometimes they didn\u2019t even live on the land\nthey owned. These large rural estates were divided into dozens, or even hundreds, of smaller plots farmed by\nsharecroppers. The sharecroppers worked the land, and got to keep part of their crop to feed their families. The\nremainder of the crop went to the hacienda owner, who sold it for a profit. The end result was that the hacienda\nowner became wealthy (more accurately, wealthier), while the sharecroppers remained poor.\nPlantations were a very different kind of agriculture. First, they were generally located on what is known as\nthe Atlantic Rimland \u2013 the tropical areas of coastal Brazil, the Guyanas, the Caribbean side of Central America, the\neast coast of Mexico, and the Caribbean islands. Instead of producing food for domestic consumption, plantations\nusually produced a luxury crop for export back to Europe \u2013 usually things like sugar cane, coffee, tobacco, or\nrubber. Most plantations practiced monoculture, meaning they grew only one crop (a coffee plantation grew\nonly coffee, a sugar cane plantation grew only sugar cane, etc.). The labor differed from haciendas as well. The\nplantation workers didn\u2019t live on their own small plot, but worked in crews, much like factory workers.\nThere are plenty of plantations in Latin America to this very day, and wages on plantations are extremely low.\nBut, years ago, the situation was even worse. Initially, Native Americans were enslaved and forced to work on the\nplantations. As the native populations plummeted because of disease, Spanish and Portuguese colonizers began\nto import slaves from Africa. The first enslaved Africans arrived in the Americas in 1502 \u2013 just a decade after\nColumbus\u2019s discovery. Slaves would serve as the main source of labor on the plantations for nearly four centuries.\nThe third major colonial economic institution were mines. Mining was the most profitable element of the\ncolonial economy, and mines were located throughout Latin America, but were especially prevalent in the Andes,\nMexico, and the Brazilian Highlands. The mine owners became very wealthy. The miners themselves, usually\npoorer immigrants or Native Americans, were paid meager wages, and remained poor.\nThese colonial economic institutions created a two-class system in Latin America. The region\u2019s merchants,\nhacienda owners, plantation owners, and mine owners became very rich. The sharecroppers, the miners, and\nespecially the slaves, lived in poverty. And these colonial institutions outlived colonization. 326 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nMost Latin American countries gained their independence in the early 1800s. The leaders of the wars for\nindependence were largely members of the colonial elite \u2013 people of European descent who had been born in\nthe Americas, and who owned the haciendas, plantations, mines, and businesses. They staged these revolutions\nbecause, after three centuries of colonization, they\u2019d largely lost their allegiance to the Spanish and Portuguese\ncrowns. More to the point, the resented the high taxes they paid to the colonizing countries, and the trade\nrestrictions that forced them to sell all of their products to Spanish or Portuguese merchants.\nAfter the countries of Latin America gained their independence, not much changed in the day-to-day lives\nof most of the region\u2019s population. The wealthy classes controlled the new governments, and still controlled\nthe land and the economy. In short, those who were wealthy during the colonial days remained wealthy after\nindependence, and those who were poor during the colonial days remained poor after independence. Over the\nnext century and beyond, the ruling class did little to extend economic opportunity to the poor. In the United\nStates, the Jeffersonian Ideal created the small family farm, and a thriving rural middle class. No such thing\nhappened in Latin America.\nThese historic institutions continue to haunt Latin America even as more and more people are living in cities.\nSomeone who lives in a luxury high-rise in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is likely the descendant of a wealthy merchant or\nlandowner. Someone who lives in one Sao Paulo\u2019s slums is likely the descendant of a miner, a sharecropper, or a\nslave.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe last country in the Americas to abolish slavery was Brazil in 1888. CHAPTER 67\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Historical\nGeography I\nThe Columbian Exchange\nThe Columbian Exchange refers to the transfer of culture, technology, people, and products between these\ntwo regions. Before Columbus\u2019s discovery, the people of the \u201cOld World\u201d (Europe, Africa, and Asia) and the \u201cNew\nWorld\u201d (the Americas) had not been in contact with one another for thousands of years. These two regions had\ndeveloped different cultures and technologies, had domesticated different plants and animals, and had suffered\nfrom different diseases. Here is a list of some of the things that were part of the exchange:\n\u2022 Old World to New World\n\u25e6 Culture: Christianity, European languages, European political and economic systems\n\u25e6 Animals: chickens, cows, donkeys, goats, honey bees, horses, pigs, sheep\n\u25e6 Plants: rice, wheat, apples, bananas, barley, carrots, coffee, oranges, lemons, lettuce, olives,\nonions, peaches\n\u25e6 Diseases: smallpox, measles, influenza, malaria, chicken pox, cholera, diphtheria\n327 328 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n\u2022 New World to Old World\n\u25e6 Animals: llamas, turkeys\n\u25e6 Plants: peppers, cacao, potatoes, tomatoes, corn (maize), rubber, tobacco, peanuts, lager yeast\n\u25e6 Diseases: syphilis\nAs you can see, the cultural exchange largely went one way. Every country in Latin America is now predominantly\nChristian, Spanish and Portuguese are now the majority languages, and the economic and political systems of\nevery country are based on European systems. Along with this came people \u2013 millions of Europeans resettled in\nthe Americas, along with enslaved Africans and, later, migrants from Asia. Few cultural traits or people went the\nother direction.\nThe agricultural components of the Columbian Exchange also permanently altered the cultures of the New\nWorld. It is difficult to imagine, for example, Native Americans cultures like the Lakota Sioux not having horses, but\nhorses didn\u2019t arrive in North America until the 1500s, when they were introduced by the Spanish. Subsequently,\na \u201ccowboy\u201d culture of horses and cattle ranching became engrained in the national identity of the United States,\nMexico, and Argentina, among others. And many of the basic food crops of the Americas were first domesticated\nin the Old World.\nThe effect of the Columbian Exchange on Old World agriculture and\neating habits was no less profound. If you like Italian food (and who doesn\u2019t), it\u2019s tough to imagine it without\ntomato sauce, but the tomato was unseen in Italy until the 1500s. Potatoes, so integral to the cuisines of countries\nlike Germany and Ireland, were first domesticated in Peru, and arrived in Europe around the same time. Corn\n(known as maize outside North America) has become a staple food crop in Africa. Cacao, which is used to make\nchocolate, is one of Africa\u2019s leading exports. And the yeast used to ferment lager \u2013 that wonderful beer that was\nperfected by the Germans, Austrians, and Czechs \u2013 was discovered in Argentina. Another New World product was\nthe chili pepper. Integral to cuisines throughout the world \u2013 and famously important in Indian, Thai, Vietnamese,\nand Chinese food \u2013 chili peppers were not spicing up the Old World until about five centuries ago.\nPerhaps the most significant, and certainly the most devastating impact of the Columbian Exchange was the\nintroduction of Old-World diseases to the Americas. For thousands of years, various diseases had evolved in the\nOld World, including smallpox, measles, influenza, malaria, chicken pox, cholera, diphtheria. As we\u2019ve seen with\nthe coronavirus pandemic, diseases can be particularly devastating when they are first introduced to the human\npopulation, because no one has developed an immunity to it. By the 1400s, measles, smallpox, and the flu had\nkilled scores of people in the Old World, but over the course of many centuries, a lot of Europeans, Africans, and\nAsians had developed immune systems that were resistant to those diseases. In 1492, nobody in the Americas LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 329\nhad ever been exposed to them, so there was no \u201cherd immunity.\u201d When these diseases were introduced by\nEuropeans, they swept through the population like wildfire, killing millions. By 1650, the population of Native\nAmericans in Latin America, which had perhaps been as large as 100 million, had dwindled to under 6 million.\nAs far we know, only one disease went the other way \u2013 syphilis. Syphilis is venereal disease, and outbreaks would\nspread throughout the Old World in the centuries after the Conquest. There is some evidence that many members\nof Columbus\u2019s crew actually died of syphilis after they returned to Spain, something that some Native Americans\nview as a form of poetic justice. And, of course, Native Americans also unleashed a scourge in the Columbian\nExchange that would kill millions of people in the Old World \u2013 tobacco.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nAlthough the potato is indigenous to Latin America, none of the world\u2019s ten largest potato producing countries \u2013 China, India, Russia, Ukraine,\nth\nthe United States, Germany, Bangladesh, Poland, France, and the Netherlands \u2013 are located there. Brazil comes closest, in 20 place. CHAPTER 68\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Physical\nGeography I\nAltitudinal Zonation\nIn Latin America\u2019s lowlands, temperature patterns are relatively simple. Most of the region falls in the tropics and\nsubtropics. The Tropic of Cancer (23.5\u02daN) cuts across the heart of Mexico, and the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u02daS)\nruns just south of Rio de Janeiro, in southern Brazil. That means that southern Mexico, Central America, and the\nnorthern three-quarters of South America all fall within the tropics. Temperature varies little from month to month\nin the tropics, so these locations experience warm temperature year-round (at least at low elevations).\nThe lowland areas of Latin America outside the tropics are pretty warm, too. All of Mexico is farther south\nthan Dallas, Texas, meaning that even the midlatitudes of lowland northern Mexico rarely get cold. Montevideo,\nUruguay \u2013 the southernmost major metropolis in Latin America \u2013 is at 34\u02daS latitude, about the same distance from\nthe equator as Atlanta, Georgia, which isn\u2019t exactly a cold place.\nThe only low elevations in Latin America that truly get cold are the southern sections of Chile and Argentina,\nwhere few people live. Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America, is located at 56\u02daS latitude, approximately\nthe same distance from the South Pole as Moscow is from the North Pole.\nIt\u2019s in Latin America\u2019s highlands where temperature patterns become more complex, and this is a region with\nplenty of highland areas.\nImagine you\u2019re standing in a mountain valley, at 3,500 feet above sea level. You look up at the top of a mountain\nthat is 14,000 feet above sea level. If it\u2019s 67\u02daF where you are, at the top of the mountain, it will be about 29\u02daF.\nThat\u2019s why some very tall mountains maintain their snowcaps in the summer \u2013 those high elevations rarely get\nabove freezing. This is because of something called the environmental lapse rate\u2013 temperatures tend to drop\nabout 3.6\u02daF for every 1,000 feet gained in elevation.\nThe lapse rate is not a daily concern for most Americans. The elevations of many large U.S. cities, like New York\n(33 feet), Los Angeles (285 feet), Chicago (597 feet), Philadelphia (39 feet), and Dallas (430 feet), are unlikely to\ngive anyone altitude sickness. There are, of course, a few major American cities at high elevations. The highest\nmid-sized American city is Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is located at 7,199 feet above sea level. The highest major\nAmerican city is Denver \u2013 the famously \u201cmile high\u201d city is located at 5,280 feet.\nDenver\u2019s elevation is modest by the standards of many Latin American cities. La Paz, the capital city of Bolivia,\nchecks in at a stunning 11,975 feet. Many other major Latin American cities are located at very high altitudes as\nwell, including Quito, Peru (9,350 feet), Bogota, Colombia (8,660 feet), and Mexico City (7,382 feet).\n330 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 331\nSo, for many Latin Americans, altitude has just as much influence\non local temperature as latitude. Altitudinal zonation is the\nexamination of how geographic traits change from lower elevations\nto higher elevations. As temperature drops, other things change as\nwell, such as economic patterns, population patterns, and even\nethnic patterns. Traditionally, geographers have divided tropical\nLatin America up into four temperature-altitude zones: the tierra\ncaliente, the tierra templada, the tierra fria, and the tierra helada.\nThe tierra\nAndes Mountains in Venezuela.\ncaliente, or \u201chot\nPhoto by Smallest Forest on Flickr.\nlands,\u201d are located\nfrom sea level up to\n3,000 feet.\nTemperatures in\nthis zone tend to be\nquite hot.\nPopulation densities\nare high near major\nCartegena, Colombia. Photo by Jerry and Pat seaports like\nDonaho on Flickr.\nCartagena (seen to\nthe left) and\nGuayaquil, or near inland ports like Manaus on the Amazon River. Population densities also tend to be high in\nzones of plantation agriculture, which are typically located along the floodplains of major rivers. Hot-weather\ncrops, like bananas and sugar cane, thrive at these tropical elevation locations.\nElsewhere, population densities of the tierra caliente tend to be relatively low. The economy often focuses on\nindustries like logging and mining, which don\u2019t lend themselves to large, permanent populations. Another factor\nlimiting population density is Latin America\u2019s tropical lowlands is disease \u2013 disease vectors, like mosquitoes, tend\nto breed prolifically in flat, hot, wet environments.\nThe primary reason for the low population density in Latin America\u2019s tropical lowlands, however, is poor soil.\nMuch of the tierra caliente is either very wet or very dry, and all of it is hot. Hot, dry environments contain relatively\nlittle vegetation, and thus the soils tend to lack organic material, making them infertile. Hot, wet environments\nalso tend to have poor soils.\nLooking at a tropical rainforest, an ecosystem that features a superabundance of organisms, one might assume\nthat such an environment would lend itself to robust agriculture. That\u2019s not the case. In hot, wet environments,\norganic material decays very rapidly. Littering the floor of rainforests is layer of humus \u2013 rapidly decaying organic\nmaterial supplied by the forest. The trees \u2013 the foundation of the rainforest ecosystem \u2013 rapidly \u201crecycle\u201d the\norganic material through their root systems. To farm the land, these trees must be removed so that sunlight can\nreach the crops. Once the trees are cut and burned, the ash and humus provide extremely fertile farmland for a\nfew years. But the forest that provided the source of that fertility \u2013 the ash and humus \u2013 has been removed. The\nnear-constant rainfall then leaches the nutrients out of the soil, and the land rapidly becomes unproductive. So,\nagriculture is possible in areas that have been cleared of rainforests, but that agriculture will not be permanent,\nleading to low population densities.\nThere is also a distinct ethnic pattern in the tierra caliente. The area features relatively few people of Native\nAmerican ancestry. When the first Europeans arrived, the densest concentration of Native Americans lived in Latin\nAmericas highlands, so populations were already relatively low in the tierra caliente. Those Native Americans\nwho did live there were quickly subjugated and displaced by the European colonizers, and many died in the 332 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nprocess. There are quite a few people of European ancestry in Latin America\u2019s tropical lowlands, particularly in the\nmajor cities, but the most distinctive ethnic trait of tierra caliente is the dense concentration of people of African\nancestry. This is the legacy of slave labor on tierra caliente plantations. In Brazil, which accounts for much of South\nAmerica\u2019s tierra caliente, about half the population is of at least partial African ancestry. In mountainous Bolivia,\nwhich accounts for very little of South America\u2019s tierra caliente, only about 1% of the population is of African\nancestry.\nThe tierra templada, or \u201ctemperate lands,\u201d are located between 3,000 and 6,500 feet. Temperatures in the\ntierra templada average about 14\u02daF cooler than those at sea level. If it\u2019s 90\u02daF on the coast, a city in the tierra\ntemplada would be a far more comfortable 76\u02daF. Because temperatures vary little from month to month in the\ntropics, this zone enjoys mild temperatures year-round \u2013 the climate has been described as \u201ceternal spring.\u201d The\npre-Columbian natives, and the Europeans who followed, both found this to be a far more salubrious environment\nthan the sweltering tierra caliente, so population densities in this zone have always been quite high.\nThe tierra templada is an agriculturally productive region, partly because of fertile volcanic soils. At this\nelevation, the hot-weather crops associated with tierra caliente don\u2019t grow well, so much of the agriculture is\ndedicated to domestic food crops like corn. There are some plantations in the tierra templada, and most of\nthem are dedicated to the production of coffee, a crop that grows well in the cooler air of this zone. That said,\nplantations are less common in the tierra templada, and thus so was slavery. There are fewer people of African\nancestry here than in the tierra caliente. Most people of this region are descended from the two groups who\nheavily settled this zone over the centuries \u2013 they are largely of European ancestry, Native American ancestry, or\na mixture of the two.\nThe tierra fria, or \u201ccool lands,\u201d are located between 6,500 and\n12,000 feet. Temperatures in the tierra fria will average about 33\u02daF\ncooler than those at sea level. If it\u2019s 90\u02daF on the coast, a city in the\ntierra templada would be a much cooler 57\u02daF. In the tierra fria,\nagriculture mainly revolves around animal grazing and crops that\ntolerate cool weather, like wheat. Population density is generally\nlower in this zone than in the tierra templada, although, as\nmentioned above, there are some very large cities here, including\nMexico City, Quito, La Paz, and Bogota.\nThe ethnic pattern is still largely a mix of European and Native\nAmerican ancestry, but in the highest elevations of this zone, the\nLa Paz, Bolivia. Photo by Guillermo A. Dur\u00e1n on ethnic mix tilts largely toward Native Americans. As elevations\nFlickr. increase in the tierra fria, temperatures drop and the air gets thin,\nso the land becomes less desirable. As discussed previously,\nEuropeans were the beneficiaries of colonization, and Native\nAmericans were the victims. So, Native Americans was often displaced to the least desirable locations during the\nconquest, including those places at high elevations.\nThe tierra helada, or \u201cfrozen lands,\u201d are located between 12,000 and 22,000 feet. Temperatures in the tierra\nfria will average about 61\u02daF cooler than those at sea level. If it\u2019s 90\u02daF on the coast, a location in the tierra templada\nwould be a frigid 29\u02daF. That is why, remarkably, glaciers exist right at the equator in the Andes. The economy\nin this zone is largely limited to mining and occasional grazing or grain cultivation at its lowest elevations, but\npopulation densities tend to be very low. The few scattered communities of the tierra helada tend to be almost\nexclusively Native American.

CHAPTER 69\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Political\nGeography I\nThe Monroe Doctrine and the Cold War\nTHE MONROE DOCTRINE\nBy 1823, many Latin American countries had gained their independence from Spain and Portugal, or were in the\nprocess of doing so. That year, in his State of the Union address, United States President James Monroe issued\na proclamation that would later come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine. It stated that once a colony in the\nAmericas gained its independence, the U.S. would not permit a European power to attempt to colonize it. For\nexample, once Mexico was independent from Spain, the U.S. would help defend Mexico, not only from Spanish\nrecolonization, but also from British or French attempts to colonize it.\nIf you\u2019re an optimist, you could put a positive spin on the Monroe Doctrine \u2013 that Monroe was recognizing the\nshared history of all former colonies of Europe, and that he was sticking up for his brethren in the Americas. And\nthere is some truth to that. If you\u2019re a pessimist, you could put a negative spin on the Monroe Doctrine \u2013 that\nMonroe was intent on replacing European dominance over Latin America with the United States\u2019 dominance over\nLatin America. There is also some truth to that.\nMost presidents who followed Monroe adhered strictly to his doctrine of limiting European influence in Latin\n334 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 335\nAmerica, but one dramatically expanded U.S. influence in the region. In 1898, the United States went to war with\nSpain, seizing Puerto Rico and Cuba, and several other small islands.\nA hero of that war, Theodore Roosevelt, would be thrust to\nnational prominence, and serve as the U.S. president from 1901 to\n1909. Roosevelt believed that the United States had the right to\nintervene in the internal affairs of Latin American countries any\ntime the economic or political interests of the U.S. were threatened.\nThis philosophy is often called the Roosevelt Corollary to the\nMonroe Doctrine.\nIn 1903, the United States supported Panamanian rebels in their\nwar for independence from Colombia. Not coincidentally, one of\nthe first actions of the newly independent Panama was to cede land\nto the United States that allowed for the construction of the\nPanama Canal. Between 1903 and 1925, the United States invaded\nCuba twice, and Honduras on seven different occasions. The U.S.\nessentially occupied Nicaragua from 1912 to 1933, Haiti from 1915\nto 1934, and the Dominican Republic from 1916 to 1924. In all\ncases, the United States was protecting authoritarian regimes who\nwere friendly to American business interests \u2013 that is, regimes that\n\u201cGo away, little man, and don\u2019t bother me.\u201d\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt is portrayed directing kept wages and taxes low on plantations and mines that supplied\nColombia. By Charles Green Bush \u2013 New York American companies.\nWorld. Public Domain. This era of U.S. interventions would end in 1934 when Theodore\nRoosevelt\u2019s distant cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt, instituted\nthe Good Neighbor Policy, which pledged American respect for the\nsovereignty of Latin American countries. This was not, however, the end of U.S. meddling in the region.\nTHE COLD WAR\nBy the early 1900s, there was growing frustration among Latin America\u2019s landless and poor populations. People\nwere frustrated with the increasing concentration of wealth and political power in the hands of the ruling class.\nThey were frustrated by the lack of democracy in the region, and by increasing U.S. influence. Many began to\nembrace a communist philosophy.\nUnfortunately for many would-be communist revolutionaries of the early 1900s, they had little chance of\noverthrowing the authoritarian governments that controlled the region. These governments were usually either\ndictatorships or one-party \u201cdemocracies.\u201d They were supportive of, and supported by, foreign corporations and\nLatin America\u2019s wealthy. These authoritarian regimes were propped up by large militaries with huge budgets, often\nsubsidized by the United States.\nEverything changed with the dawn of the Cold War. Now, communist revolutionaries in Latin America had\na significant benefactor. The Soviet Union was willing to finance and arm insurgencies throughout the region.\nConflicts between American-backed governments and Soviet-backed rebels flared in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,\nChile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru. The\nUnited States was generally on the winning side of this Cold War chess match. Only two communist revolutions\nwere successful \u2013 in Cuba in 1959, and Nicaragua in 1979.\nThe United States\u2019 success in curbing communist expansion in Latin America came at a cost. During the Cold\nWar, the United States adhered to what is sometimes called the \u201cOur Dictator\u201d philosophy. The thought was that 336 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nthe United States should support anti-communist dictators, because if we didn\u2019t support \u201cour dictator,\u201d he would\nbe replaced by \u201ctheir dictator\u201d \u2013 a ruler loyal to the Soviet Union.\nThe United States did indeed support a rogue\u2019s gallery of dictators in Latin America. Some particularly notorious\nexamples include Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Manuel Noriega of Panama, and the Somoza regime of Nicaragua.\nPinochet came to power in a 1974 military coup that was orchestrated by the United States. He then ruled the\ncountry until 1990, killing thousands of political opponents, and torturing tens of thousands more. Manuel Noriega\nwas an anti-communist intelligence officer trained by the United States. He ruled Panama with U.S. support in the\n1980s, and had a very shady human rights record. His regime ended in 1989, when he was indicted by the United\nStates on drug trafficking charges, and removed from power by a U.S. invasion. The Somoza family and their allies\nruled Nicaragua for forty-three years, torturing and murdering political opponents, silencing the media, violating\nhuman rights, and robbing the country blind. But they were ardently anti-communist, so they were supported by\nthe United States.\nIt is not coincidental that Pinochet, Noriega, and many more Latin American dictators were forced from power\nin the late 1980s and early 1990s. As the Soviet Union collapsed, it was no longer willing or able to support\ncommunist rebellions in Latin America, so the United States largely abandoned the \u201cOur Dictator\u201d policy. As U.S.\nsupport for these regimes crumbled, so did the regimes.\nU.S.-CUBAN RELATIONS\nPerhaps the strangest example of the United States\u2019 relationship with Latin American can be found in Cuba. The\nUnited States granted Cuba nominal independence in 1902. In reality, Cuba was a satellite state of the U.S. for\nthe next several decades, with a series of authoritarian regimes governing the island under the watchful eye of\nthe American government. American companies had major stakes in Cuba\u2019s two leading industries \u2013 plantation\nagriculture and tourism. Cuba exported sugar and tobacco to the U.S., and Havana was a major American\nplayground \u2013 it was like today\u2019s Miami and Las Vegas rolled into one. The U.S. wanted to keep taxes and wages\nin Cuba low to maximize profits. This led to a discontented working class, many of whom began to support a\nrebellion led by Fidel Castro in the 1950s.\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, 1959, Castro\u2019s militia overthrew the government of Fulgencio Batista, the U.S.-backed\ndictator. A large number of upper-class Cubans fled the island and established residence in other Caribbean\nislands, or in Florida. Castro\u2019s regime soon aligned with the Soviet Union, much to the horror of the United States. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 337\nCommunism had arrived on America\u2019s doorstep \u2013 80 miles off the coast of Florida. To the U.S., Cuba represented\nan unsinkable Soviet aircraft carrier.\nSince then, the U.S. and Cuba have had a strained, and often bizarre, relationship. Two of the biggest flashpoints\ncame early on. In 1961, the CIA orchestrated the Bay of Pigs invasion (named for its landing site). The invasion was\ncarried out by Cuban exiles hoping to retake their country from Castro. It was a spectacular failure. In 1962, the\nworld endured the Cuban Missile Crisis. U.S. spy planes had discovered sites meant for the installation of Soviet\nnuclear missiles. President Kennedy ordered a naval quarantine of Cuba, insisting that the Soviets remove all\nmissile silos from the island. Tensions mounted for several days, and many feared it would escalate into a nuclear\nwar between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union eventually flinched, and agreed to remove the missile\nbatteries in Cuba. Secretly, the United States had also agreed to remove missiles form Turkey. Reportedly, the\nCIA made several attempts to assassinate Castro during the 1960s (including one attempt involving an exploding\ncigar). None of them were successful.\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the sour relationship between the two countries is the travel and\ntrade embargo. For more than five decades, it was illegal for Americans to sell any products to Cuba, or to buy\nany products from Cuba. That\u2019s why Cuban cigars became so highly prized \u2013 they are illegal in the United States.\nAmericans were also forbidden, with few exceptions, from travelling to Cuba. Journalists, academics, religious\nleaders, and humanitarian workers were permitted to go there, but not tourists. (Of course, American tourists\ncontinued to travel there, they just had to go by way of another country). Prior to 1959, American agricultural\nmarkets and tourists had been, by far, the leading source of revenue for Cuba, so the embargo had shattering\nconsequences for the country\u2019s economy.\nThe U.S. had similar embargoes against other communist states during the Cold War, but nearly all of them were\nlifted in the early 1990s. The U.S. had an embargo, for example, on Vietnam. The U.S. had fought a devastating war\nin Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s, one that killed more than 58,000 U.S. military personnel. The same communist\ngovernment that had fought the U.S. was still in power when the Vietnam embargo was lifted in 1993. If the U.S.\nhad managed to bury the hatchet with Vietnam, surely it would with Cuba. But it didn\u2019t. As the Cold War faded into\nthe past, the United States kept its Cuban embargo in place.\nThis has everything to do with Florida. Florida is a classic swing state, divided evenly between Republicans and\nDemocrats. Its two senate seats are almost always in play and, more importantly, it has 29 votes in the electoral\ncollege. In the last fourteen presidential elections, a candidate has won the general election without carrying\nFlorida just one time. The state is nearly indispensable when it comes to a winning presidential campaign.\nAs mentioned above, many of the wealthy Cubans who fled Castro\u2019s revolution settled in Florida. They and\ntheir descendants harbored bitter resentment toward the Castro regime, who had confiscated their property and 338 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nforced them to flee their homeland. These Cuban-Americans are deeply influential in Florida politics, both as\nvoters and political donors.\nNevertheless, in 2015, the U.S. and Cuba made moved to normalize relations. The United States and Cuba\nopened their respective embassies in Havana and Washington for the first time in five decades. In 2016, Barack\nObama became the first American president to visit Cuba in nearly nine decades. The two countries began\nnegotiations to end the embargo.\nThe United States eased some trade and travel restrictions during President Obama\u2019s last months in office, but\nthe full embargo has not been lifted. There are still issues to work out. The United States insists that Cuba ease\nrestrictions on freedom of speech and information, which Cuba is not inclined to do. There are also disagreements\non economic damage claims. Cuban-Americans hold judgments from U.S. courts entitling them to $2 billion in\nreparations for property seized by the Castro regime back in 1959. Cuba insists that the United States pay $150\nbillion in damages for the hardships Cuba has suffered as a result of the embargo. Since taking office in 2017,\nPresident Trump has shown no inclination to continue negotiations with Cuba.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nIn a 2012 magazine interview, Miami Marlins baseball manager Ozzie Guillen expressed admiration for Fidel Castro. Although the\nVenezuelan-born Guillen was admiring Castro\u2019s longevity, and not his politics, the Marlins\u2019 Florida fan-base was outraged. Guillen was\nsuspended by the team for five games, and fired later that season. CHAPTER 70\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Population\nGeography I\nTotal Fertility in the Caribbean\nThe Total Fertility Rate (TFR) is the average number of births that a woman bears over her lifetime. This is an\nimportant demographic statistic, for it anticipates how sufficiently a population will replace one generation after\nanother.\nClearly, to replace a generation a woman needs to have at least two children, conceptually a boy and a girl. Of\ncourse, not every woman needs to give birth to both a boy and a girl, for over a large population the numbers of\neach sex average out, so that a total fertility rate of 2.0 will produce roughly one boy and one girl for each woman\nand man. As you will read about the sex ratio in this textbook, you also will understand that there actually are\nmore boys born than girls born; therefore, a total fertility rate of 2.0 in reality will produce more boys than girls.\nAdditionally, some children will die before reaching adulthood and before producing their own offspring. A few\nmore of these dying children will be boys relative to girls. So, to compensate for the loss of these small numbers of\ndeaths, the replacement figure used in demography is 2.1. There need to be 2.1 children born to one generation\nof women (and men) in order for that new generation to replace the previous generation numerically.\nAs you read about the Demographic Transition in this textbook, you learn that birth rates (births per thousand\npeople per year) and the statistically correlated total fertility rates begin to decline in Stage 2. Numbers of births\nand the corresponding statistics show a general decline for the remainder of the Demographic Transition. There\n339 340 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nare many significant causes for this decline, but principally these factors are greater food supply and better\nmedical care that together boost child survival rates, as well as lower demand for children in the settings of the\nmodern industrial world.\nIn the Caribbean, we find low figures for total fertility. These Caribbean islands indeed have benefitted from\nadvances in modern medicine and stable availability of food supply. Significantly because of tourism, the islands\nhave gained in wealth and average income. Thus, for the same reasons as elsewhere across the globe, it makes\nsense that the islands should have somewhat lower rates of fertility. Nevertheless, there is one additional factor\nthat directly affects the fertility on Caribbean islands. These islands are islands! Indeed, many of the islands are\nsmall islands. The space for large families is limited because the area of the islands is inherently limited.\nOf course, there are small islands all across the world. Yes, we\ncan see this demographic trend across the world too. Let\u2019s look at\nthe numbers, according to the CIA Factbook\u2019s estimates for 2020\nfor 228 countries and territories.\nAmong these countries and territories, the lowest total fertility is\nfound on five islands. The city-State of Singapore is has the lowest\ntotal fertility in the world. Similarly densely crowded urban\nterritories of Macau and Hong Kong follow closely. The highly\nurban and also Asian country of Taiwan has remarkably low fertility\nfor a decent-sized island country.\n2019 Cariwest Parade \u2013 Caribbean Arts Festival \u2013\nPhoto by Sangudo on Flickr.

The rest of the table below does not list all island countries\/territories\nwith low fertility (such as #205 Malta at 1.49), but does enumerate qualifying Caribbean islands. Note that the\nonly Caribbean countries not having below replacement fertility are Haiti and the Dominican Republic, adjacent\ncountries sharing one island \u2013 Hispaniola. Perhaps this presence above replacement is partly due to their\nrespective larger areas; however, other island in the Greater Antilles \u2013 Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico \u2013 do not share\ntheir higher numbers. In fact, Puerto Rico has precisely half the total fertility of Haiti. Instead it would seem 342 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nthat Haiti\u2019s failure to join even the most prosperity common throughout the Caribbean prompts parents there to\ncontinue to view larger families as necessary to seek economic advantages.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nAt the other end of the list, Niger leads the world with a total fertility rate of 7.0. In fact, it is the only country with a total fertility rate of\ngreater than 6.0. In comparison, TFR for the United States is 1.84.\nThe wild card in the discussion of total fertility rate is migration.

CHAPTER 71\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Urban\nGeography I\nRural-to-Urban Migration in Brazil\nIn Latin America, rural-to-urban migration has been a major demographic motor over the last few decades. This\ngeographic movement of people caused considerable urban change. The Brazilian favela or, in general terms, the\nshantytown, is a consequence of that migratory surge to cities.\nIn 1950, Latin America\u2019s population was just 25% urban. By 2015, the region was 75% urban. Consider the push\nfactors (forces that caused people to leave rural areas) and pull factors (forces that cause people to move to cities)\nbehind this dramatic reshuffling of Latin America\u2019s population.\nMigration in Brazil, as with human migration anywhere on the planet, is prompted by push and by pull factors.\nPush factors compel people to leave (pushed away) where they are living, for that location has become hazardous\ndue to a natural disaster (e.g., hurricane) or a societal constraint (e.g., political oppression). In Latin America\nth\nthe major push factor was unemployment. In the mid-20 century, the region experienced the Green Revolution \u2013\nthe introduction of modern farming technologies like advanced machinery, high-yield hybrid crops, and chemical\npesticides and fertilizers. This was beneficial, because many Latin American countries dramatically increased their\nagricultural output. The downside, though, was a dramatic reduction in the need for farm labor. Sharecroppers\nand plantation workers lost their livelihoods, and headed to cities to look for work. Even those small-scale Latin\n343 344 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAmerican farmers who owned their own land suffered. The Green Revolution increased agricultural yields, but\nit also increased the cost of farming. Thousands of small-scale farmers could no longer compete with larger\ncorporate farms, and many of them were forced to sell their land and move to the city. At the same time, new\ntechnologies were introduced in mining and logging that eliminated a lot of the remaining rural jobs in the region.\nIn contrast, pull factors bring people toward (pull to) a new destination, for that location offers or seems to\noffer a better living situation. Most, but not all, of the pull factors were economic in nature. People moved to cities\nin hopes of higher wages and more employment opportunities. Cities offered greater chances for upward social\nmobility \u2013 in rural areas, people who are born poor tend to remain poor. In urban areas, there was a chance to\nclimb the socioeconomic ladder. Cities also tend to feature higher-quality education, health care, and other public\nservices. Finally, many migrated to cities because of the perceived superiority of urban lifestyles. This is known\nas the \u201ccity lights\u201d phenomenon. As wonderful as rural areas can be, they generally don\u2019t offer the same kind of\nexcitement as a place like Mexico City or Rio de Janeiro.\nThese rural-to-urban push and pull factors are not unique to Latin America. They are part of the demographic\ntransition that all countries eventually experience. The same push and pull factors were present a century or two\nago in North America and Europe. Luckily for people in those regions, there were millions of manufacturing jobs\nawaiting them when they arrived in the cities.\nLatin America has not been so fortunate. As people began crowding into Latin American cities in the 1970s, they\noverwhelmed the urban infrastructure. The cities simply could not provide adequate housing, utilities, schools,\ntransportation, and employment for this crush of migrants. That forced many of these new urban dwellers into\nsquatter settlements \u2013 illegal, informal slums where people \u201csquatted\u201d on land they did not own, and constructed\nhomes out of salvaged materials.\nA final distinct characteristic of rural-to-urban migration in Latin America has been the tendency to target\nprimate cities. A qualitative definition of a primate city is a large city dominates the rest of the country\ndemographically, culturally, politically, and economically. Recall that in Chapter 54, we considered primate cities\nin Europe. Since Brazil does not meet all the criteria for developing a primate city, we do not find all the rural-to-\nurban migrants in a single metropolitan area there. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 345\nRural-to-urban migration in Brazil occurs due to these push and pull factors. Certainly, sometimes there are\nboth positive and negative elements of rural life. Those who are large landowners in rural Brazil typically do quite\nwell economically. However, landless peasants and anyone doing wage labor in rural Brazil may live in relatively\npoverty. Drought or other weather factors may contribute to economic difficulties. When these rural conditions\nare severe, this may force rural-to-urban migration, thus placing these human flows in the push category.\nFrequently though, the pull of the city is the major portion of motivation for the countryside dweller to move\nto the city. Principally the city offers job opportunities that if secured would multiply a migrant\u2019s earnings\nsubstantially. Again the \u201cbright lights\u201d of multiple attractions and features in cities like Rio de Janeiro may uproot\nrural residents and draw them to urban life.\nGeographers often are interested in studying migration patterns. Pull migration reveals a fascinating\ncomparison of different geographic locations, where the preferred or better location secures the resident.\nNaturally then, geographers have studied the patterns of rural-to-urban migration in Brazil. As in much of Latin\nAmerica, these migration flows in Brazil have transformed the country from a rural society to an urban land. In\ncomparison to the migration experiences of North American and European countries, this transformation has\nbeen distinctly more rapid. In 1940, Brazil held only about 30% of its citizens in urban areas. Less than eight\ndecades later, in 2018 Brazil was 86.6% urbanized. In contrast, the USA had 30% urban levels in 1885, but was at\n82.2% in 2018. American urbanization proceeded at a slower pace than in Brazil, whereas Brazil actually is more\nurban than the United States is now.\nIn addition, geographers have been interested in the logic and motivations of potential migrants in Brazil. One\ninteresting approach in these queries is the mathematical logic of expected return. 346 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA simple way of examining the concept of expected return is the Powerball lottery. The odds of winning\nthe jackpot in Powerball are 1 in 292,201,338, but for simplicity, let\u2019s call that one in three hundred million. A\nPowerball ticket costs $2. Should you buy a Powerball ticket? That depends on the size of the jackpot to be won.\nLet\u2019s say that the jackpot is $150 million.\nJackpot X Odds = Expected Return\n$150 million X (1 \/ 300 million) = $0.50.\nIn that case, your expected return is fifty cents, but you paid $2 for the ticket. Bad strategy, paying for less than\nyou mathematically expect to win.\nWhat if the jackpot is $750 million? Use the same formula.\n$750 million X (1 \/ 300 million) = $2.50.\nIn this scenario, your expected return is $2.50, but you paid only $2 for the ticket. Mathematically, this is a good\nstrategy for your expected return is more than your cost.\nWe can consider rural-to-urban migration in Brazil in the same fashion. What would be paid or given up if\ntrading rural life for urban life? Many things, but we are talking about income to begin. So, the migrant is giving\nup known patterns of rural income. What is to be gained? Urban income. How much urban income? That is\nunknown, but estimated. The potential migrant typically does not have a job lined up in the big city, but would\nbe practicing speculative migrationby moving to the city in the hopes of getting a job. What are the chances of\ngetting employment in the urban area? That too is unsure, but estimated.\nSo what is our formula?\nEstimated urban income X the estimated odds of that happening = the expected return.\nCompare that estimated expected return with the known rural income. If the estimated expected return\nexceeds by more than a little the known rural income, then the rural dweller should move to the city. If not, then\nstay in the countryside.\n1\nFor instance, if the average monthly urban wage in Minas Gerais state of Brazil is R$2138 (where R$ the\nBrazilian currency, thereal), should the rural worker move to the city? What is the rural income? What are the\nestimated odds of getting the urban income? Let\u2019s say that the odds are fifty\/fifty or one out of two chances. Let\u2019s\nsay that rural worker is making the minimum wage there at R$876 monthly. Do the math.\nEstimated urban income X the estimated odds of that happening = the expected return. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 347\nR$2138 X 0.50 = R$1069\nSince R$1069 is more than the known income of R$876, the migration to the city should happen. It is\nmathematically logical.\nThroughout Latin America, millions of people have undertaken this rural-to-urban migration. Generally, studies\nhave shown that this migration is mathematically logical. In a sense this is good news. Geographers like it when\npeople behave in geographically rational ways.\nHowever, there are complications.\nWhen purchasing a Powerball ticket, it may be mathematically logical if the jackpot is sizeable enough. However,\nthere is no guarantee of winning the jackpot! In fact, the overwhelming odds are that any given ticket purchaser\nwill win $0.00. For the casual purchaser of a lottery ticket or two, this is not a big deal, but can be spent to create a\nlittle bit of fun anticipation.\nWhen choosing to migrate to a city in Brazil, the person leaving the countryside is not guaranteed a job, for\nthat is the nature of speculative migration. In fact, often the migrant fails to secure a regular job, by subsists on\nirregular, informal income. The move to the city and the challenge of trying to secure unpromised income may be\nmathematically sound, but is not casual or just a little bit of fun.\nThe cities of Brazil, in particular the giants of Sao\nPaulo and Rio de Janeiro, faced a number of problems\ndue to the flood of migrants from the countryside over\nthe past few decades. The singular urban problem is\nthe favela or shantytown. The consequence of\nthousands, even millions, of rural folk arriving in cities,\nbut having very little money and no proof of\nguaranteed wage income, necessarily generate a vast\nRocinha favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photo by Chensiyuan on\nhost of DIY shelters\/shacks\/homes that are jammed\nFlickr.\nnext to each other or even in stacks upon each other.\nThe Brazilian favela features primitive to simple\nhousing, little or no municipal services like water, paths more than streets, and high rates of crime. Because\nunclaimed land or at least places of unclear ownership usually are on the edges or peripheries of the urban areas,\nfavelas rapidly grow in size and number in those outer sectors of the urban land. Unused hillsides become meccas\nfor the vertical favelas, popping upward in stacked varieties along the hills\u2019 slopes.\nThe Latin America city has been modeled by Ernest\nGriffin and Larry Ford, originally in 1980 and modified\nas these cities evolved over time. An interactive\ndiagram of this model can be seen here \u2014\nhttps:\/\/www.thinglink.com\/scene\/\n741386144226213889.\nIn a sense like the purchaser of a Powerball ticket,\nseeking a gigantic jackpot, the rural-to-urban migrant\nin Brazil apparently reacts mathematically to perceived\nopportunities in the metropolitan realm. However,\njust as the Powerball ticket isn\u2019t guaranteed winnings,\nthe migrant isn\u2019t assured of a good job, but often lives\nan economically precarious life, frequently by lodging\nFavela in Rio de Janeiro.

The expected return of winning the lottery are\ncomplicated by a number of issues. Does the winner accept an annuity over thirty years or take a lesser lump sum payment now? How much\nof the winnings will be handed over through federal and state taxes? Including these factors will create a more complicated equation than that\nnoted above.\nSimilarly, the choice of moving or not moving to the Brazilian city is not only predicated on average income. What are tax differences? How\ndo cost of living levels vary between rural and urban settings? Indeed, there are other factors that likewise create a more complicated formula\nthan that noted above.\nHowever, the fundamental notion of economic comparison is the basis for logically determining whether or not to purchase a Powerball\nticket and often for deciding whether or not to move to the city.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\nDe Freitas Barbosa, Alexandre, Marina Barbosa E Silva, Paulo Candia, Veiga Murilo, and Alves Zacareli. 2016.\n\u201cSeries 1, Report 5 Living Wage Report Rural Brazil Minas Gerais South\/Southwestern Region Coffee Growing\nIndustry.\u201d https:\/\/www.isealalliance.org\/sites\/default\/files\/resource\/2017-12\/\nLiving_Wage_Benchmark_Report_Brazil.pdf.\n\u201cBrazil \u2013 Ongoing Domestic Migration | Britannica.\u201d 2019.

CHAPTER 72\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Cultural\nGeography II\nThe Geography of Sports in Mexico\nFELIPE ARMAS\nOfficially named United Mexican States, a name very rarely used by\nits inhabitants, today Mexico is a country of nearly 129 million people. Sports there are an important part of the\ndaily life, economy and culture with Mexicans as spectators, consumers, and participants. A relatively youthful\npopulation, Mexicans (average age 29, for Americans 38) often are enthusiastic sports fans. The most popular\nsports in Mexico are football (soccer), boxing, baseball and basketball, in that order.\n349 350 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nFOOTBALL\/SOCCER\nYou might have guessed already that soccer, football or \u201cfutbol\u201d is the most popular sport in most of the country.\nSince the majority of the world call this sport football even in English, it will be termed as football in this essay.\nFrom little villages to big cities, football is the sport with the most spectators, most covered by the media, and the\nmost played.\nFootball was first introduced at the very end of the 1800s by English mining companies in the city of Pachuca, in\nthe central region, then in Mexico City and in Orizaba, in the state of Veracruz. Organized competition remained\nonly for the affluent in sport clubs until the early 1920s, in which Spaniard immigrant businessmen formed the\nfirst professional leagues.\nThere are almost 325,000 registered players and more than 8,000,000 unregistered ones playing weekly\n1\nthroughout the country. Professional leagues of different levels are regulated by the Mexican Football Federation,\naffiliated with the International Football Federation (FIFA). The greatest successes for Mexican soccer in\ninternational competition have been winning the FIFA-U 17 World Cup in 2005 and again in 2011 and capturing\nthe Gold Medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Regions contributing the greatest number of players to the first\ndivision league and to the national teams are Jalisco State, Mexico City and Michoacan State, although a talented\nplayer could emerge from anywhere in the country.\nSince the 1970s, there have been a few attempts at organized women\u2019s soccer, but these endeavors did not last.\nHowever, a promising future started in 2017 with the Liga MX Femenil as the highest division of women\u2019s football\nin Mexico. Supervised by the Mexican Football Federation, this professional league has 18 teams, each coinciding\nwith a Liga MX (men\u2019s) squad.\nBASKETBALL LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 351\nBasketball is the second most practiced sport in Mexico, although\nfourth in popularity behind football, boxing, and baseball. The first documented basketball activity dates from the\nth\nfirst decade of the 20 century, at a private school in the city of Puebla. By the Olympic Games in 1936, Mexico\nhad a strong team, winning a bronze medal in the competition.\nChihuahua is the largest Mexican state in the country and borders the United States. This state has a good\noverall economy based on agriculture and manufacturing. Regions within the Chihuahua state experience rough\nwinter seasons that inhibit outdoor sports such as football or baseball. In Chihuahua and other northern states,\ndue to ethnic heritage, on average people are taller than in other regions of the country. All of these factors\nhave contributed to a long basketball tradition in Chihuahua. This state boasts the most success in national\nchampionships at all levels, as well as being the main contributor (alongside Mexico City) of players for national\nteams. In the decade of the 1980s, the broadcast of National Basketball Association (NBA) games from the United\nStates greatly increased the interest in basketball among the youth in Mexico. The NBA currently schedules a\ncouple pre-season and regular-season games in Mexico City every year.\nUnlike organized professional football, basketball in Mexico has been plagued by mismanagement, conflicting\nfactions, emerging and soon folding leagues, and overall lack of continuity. These have been obstacles that\nhindered the formation of a solid base for development of young players for a sport that is very much liked in\nlarge regions of the country. 352 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBOXING\nBoxing is much practiced in Mexico, both amateur and professionally. It is also the second most watched sport,\nafter football. Initially, in the 1930s and 1940s, large metropolitan areas like Mexico City and Guadalajara produced\nregional boxing figures. It was in the decade of the 1960s when Mexican fighters began to have a consistent\nand ever increasing international presence, especially in the lower weight categories. Fifteen Mexican boxers\nare already in the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Although Mexican male boxers have had relatively modest\nsuccess in Olympic competition, winning twelve medals so far, most of the success have been in the professional\n2\narena within each of the several international boxing organizations. States with a large boxing tradition and many\nchampions are Baja California Norte, Sinaloa, Sonora, Yucatan, Jalisco, State of Mexico and, as mentioned, Mexico\nCity. The country has given birth to more than 200 professional world champions, second only to the number of\nchampions from the United States.\nBASEBALL\nOrganized baseball is the most popular sport in regions of the Northwest as well as in southern coastal areas LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 353\nalong the Gulf of Mexico. The geographic proximity of Major League Baseball teams near northwestern Mexico\nclearly is a major force behind baseball\u2019s regional popularity there. For instance, California\u2019s teams in San Diego\nand in Los Angeles have fan support in Mexico.\nThere are several stories about how baseball was first introduced in Mexico. Whether by American soldiers\nin Veracruz or American railroad workers in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, the game became known in the\nth\nsecond half of the 19 century. It was not until 1925 when the first professional league was founded with a few\nteams in Mexico City and surrounding regions. The Mexican Baseball League has expanded, undergone years\nof great success and popularity, followed by financial struggles, splits into competing leagues and successful\nreorganization. The presence of American and Caribbean players on each of the Mexican teams has been a\nconstant since the early years. Around World War II, the league attracted very good players from the Negro\nLeagues in the United States, where these players\u2019 opportunities were very limited by the social system in place.\nSince the late 1960s, the Mexican baseball league has been a class Triple-A league in organized Minor League\n3\nBaseball, one grade below Major League Baseball (MLB).\nBaseball is enormously popular in Northern states such as Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua and Nuevo Leon, as well\nas the whole peninsula of Baja California. These are fertile grounds for the very successful winter league named\nLa Liga Mexicana del Pacifico (Mexican Pacific League). This league is currently considered the highest quality of\nbaseball in the country, although also in a Triple-A league class. The league attracts some major league players\nduring the off season in the United States and its fans are passionate and quite knowledgeable about the sport.\nThe ten current franchises are distributed within the Pacific Northwest states, in the large cities of Guadalajara,\nJalisco, and Monterrey, and in the state of Nuevo Leon. Every year, the league\u2019s champion represents Mexico in\nthe Caribbean Series, the highest tournament for professional baseball teams in Latin America.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nTwo countries, one team. The professional baseball team Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos (Owls of the Two Laredos) in the Northern Division of\nthe Mexican Baseball League (Triple-A class) is the only known baseball team in the world that plays its home games split in two countries. Half\nof home games are played in their stadium in the city of Nuevo Laredo, in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, and half are played across the river\nin Laredo, Texas. The team has arrangements with different firms in each side of the border, therefore home uniforms, team merchandise and\nstadium concessions are somewhat different on each side the border.\nArguably the greatest Mexican baseball player ever, pitcher Fernando Valenzuela starred for the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching eleven of his\nseventeen major league seasons there. \u201cFernandomania\u201d showed his popularity in Mexico and in Los Angeles in the 1980s.\nADDITIONAL AND CITED BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n1\n\u201cWayback Machine.\u201d 2014.

CHAPTER 73\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Economic\nGeography II\nPoverty in Haiti\nHaiti is the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere and, in our terminology, thus of the Western\nWorld.\nHaiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. Although there are two countries on the\nsame island, Haiti\u2019s portion (36.4% of the area of Hispaniola) is strikingly poorer than the Dominican east.\nth\nFor 2020 Focus Economics ranks Haiti as the 6 poorest country in the world and the only Western World\ncountry in the bottom ten. This ranking marks Haiti with a GDP per capita of $923. For a chart showing these\nbottom ten countries, go to https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/haitianpoverty In contrast, the GDP per capita across the border\nin the Dominican Republic is $8050 (2018), about 8\u00bd times higher than in Haiti.\n354 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 355\nth\nOn the Human Development Index (HDI \u2013 2018) Haiti ranks 169\nout of 189 countries. The next lowest in development in the\nrd\nWestern World lists as the Solomon Islands, ranked at 153 .\nWorldwide what are the characteristics and the causes of\npoverty? How well do they apply to Haiti?\nWhat is correlated with poverty? Let us consider these factors \u2013\nlandlocked, violent conflict, debt, disease, natural disasters,\ncorruption, and inequality.\n1 \u2013 Landlocked.\nThis lack of ocean\nborders often is a\nPoverty Levels in Haiti.\ncriterion for\nCartography by Steve Banas.\npoverty, but of\ncourse, Haiti is an\nisland country, so this does not apply. The six countries ranking\nlowest on HDI are landlocked countries in Africa. Haiti achieves\npoverty without the handicap of being landlocked.\n2 \u2013 Conflict, violence, and war. An interesting concept is the\nConflict Trap, a variation of the Poverty Trap. Violent conflict and\npoverty can be linked in a negative feedback loop where conflict\nPetit Guave, Haiti.\nleads to poverty which leads to conflict which leads to poverty, and\nPhoto by Claudia Altamimi on Unsplash.\nso on. Violent conflict can cause \u201ca reversal of economic\ndevelopment, which in turn increases the likelihood of future\nviolent conflict. \u2026 Agreeing with the Conflict Trap, a country ranked at the bottom 10% on a global poverty scale is\n1\nsix times more likely to see violent civil conflict than a country at the top 10%.\u201d\nThis makes sense historically and contemporarily here. Haiti was founded out of native poverty that led to\nviolent revolution in 1791-1804. Haiti won its independence from France, but took on large debt in doing so.\nFrance forcefully demanded reparations for the loss of its slave colony, agreeing in 1825 and then revising\npayment lower in 1838 to 90 million francs (the equivalent of $21 billion now). Haiti paid off this debt in 1947, but\nthis historical debt burdened all of Haiti\u2019s independent nationhood.\nIn recent years, violence has been an issue. United Nations peacekeeping forces helped maintain order from\n2003-2017. In 2019, violent outbreaks in Haitian slums prompted the term \u201canarchy\u201d in Reuters reporting. In the\nrd\nGlobal Peace Index for 2019, Haiti ranks 83 out of 163 countries. It may be that being an island State is helpful\nfor peace, as Iceland ranks 1stand New Zealand 2ndin this index; however, Haiti is an island and ranks average in\nviolence. There is no civil war in Haiti. Arguably, violence has some impact on poverty there. 356 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAnother example of a Poverty Trap involves disease. Sick people\nproduce less income which means less money for medical care\nwhich means staying sick which again means less income and so\non. Haiti ranks second in LACAR to the Bahamas in terms of the\nhighest percentages of population that is HIV+; moreover, Haiti\nscores third in LACAR in terms of total numbers of HIV+ cases, after\nthe much more populous Brazil and Mexico.\nFollowing the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, there was a major\ncholera outbreak (ironically, brought accidentally by United Nations\npeacekeepers). Only by January 2020, ten years later, was cholera\neliminated from Haiti. Haiti ranks worst in LACAR in potable water\nPhoto by Bill Hamway on Unsplash supply with 35% lacking basic drinking water.\nSo, yes, the feedback loop of disease and poverty in Haiti is\nsignificant.\n3 \u2013 Natural Disasters. Haiti and the island of Hispaniola lie on a tectonic plate boundary, positioning the island\nin the type of location that produces earthquakes. The 2010 earthquake causes massive property damage and\ncatastrophic loss of life.\nThe epicenter of the 7.0 magnitude quake was only sixteen miles\nfrom Port-au-Prince, the national capital. As seen here, the\nNational Palace was one of thousands of heavily damaged\nbuildings.\nHaiti\u2019s location is in the Atlantic Ocean\u2019s hurricane belt.\nSignificant hurricane damage occurred there in 2016 \u2013 Hurricane\nMatthew, 2010 \u2013 Hurricane Tomas, and 2008 \u2013 Hurricanes Gustav,\nHanna, and Ike. Earthquakes, along with hurricanes and associated\nflooding, regularly cause significant property damage and some\nloss of life in Haiti.\nRuins of the Presidential Palace. 4 \u2013 Political Corruption. In 2008, Transperancy International, a\nPhoto by Trocaire from Ireland. global coalition against corruption, ranked Haiti as the fourth most\ncorrupt country in the world. Since then, Haiti has improved to\nth\n161 best out of 180 countries in 2018. For instance, the\nPetrocaribe policy with Venezuela was intended to reduce the price of oil purchases for Haiti; however, Haitian\nauditors have revealed that about $2 billion of these savings are missing, thus not available for their intended use\nin social development. These sorts of things are not new, probably peaking under the regime of President Jean-\nClaude Duvalier \u2013 1971-1986.\nrd\nIn the 2020 Index of Economic Freedom, Haiti ranked 153 out of 180 in the world, in LACAR marking ahead of\nonly Ecuador, Suriname, Bolivia, Cuba, and Venezuela.\n5 \u2013 Inequality. Haiti scored 41.1 on the GINI index for 2018. In this statistic of wealth inequality, a rating of zero\nth\nwould be perfect equality, while a rating of 100 would have one person owning everything. This is 56 highest\ninequality of 153 countries. Inequality often prompts dissatisfaction and sometimes violence. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 357\nThere are a number of factors that affect poverty in countries\nworldwide. Haiti does not feature all of these factors, for it is not\nlandlocked; however, the other elements explained here do find\nresonance in Haiti. The socioeconomic factors are not\nindependent of each other, but have interrelationships that make\npoverty more complex and more intractable. The Haitian people\nsuffer the consequences.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nPhoto by Susan More on Unsplash Following the earthquake of 2010, musicians recorded a new version of \u201cWe are\nthe World\u201d in order to bring attention to the dire needs of the people of Haiti.

CHAPTER 74\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Historical\nGeography II\nBritish Overseas Territories\nThere are fourteen British Overseas Territories (BOT), sometimes known as United Kingdom Overseas Territories\n(UKOT). Indeed, these lands are part of the United Kingdom and as such feature Queen Elizabeth II as their\nmonarch and head of state.\nIt has been said in different ways and at different\ntimes that the sun never set on the British Empire.\nTruly, the British colonial system spanned the globe, in\nvarious decades and centuries holding vast lands such\nas America, Canada, and Australia, as well as many\nislands of varied sizes and shapes. Some of these\nlands are former colonies that maintain links through\nthe British Commonwealth, a voluntary association of\n54 countries, including Australia, Canada, India, Malta,\nNew Zealand, Singapore, and others. The United\nStates has no such ties to the United Kingdom, but\nremains a strong ally and trading partner with Britain.\nAdditionally, there are the Crown dependencies \u2013 the\nislands of Guernsey and Jersey and the Isle of Man.\nThese islands nearby to Great Britain are not\nBritish Colonies in Latin America and the Caribbean (LACAR).\nindependent countries and thus are not in the\nCartography by Jeff Wandersen.\nCommonwealth, but have their own political\nrelationships with the United Kingdom.\nIn this essay, we specifically consider the British Overseas Territories that are within the Caribbean. This\nexcludes the BOT members outside the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia that\nare on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, the British Antarctic Territory, the British Indian Ocean Territory (also\na military base), Gibraltar (whose strait connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea), and the Pitcairn\nIslands in the Pacific Ocean. Additionally not near the Caribbean, there are Atlantic Ocean islands that are British\nOverseas Territories. The islands of St. Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha are located far distant from\nanywhere, sitting in the center of the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Falkland Islands and the somewhat nearby\n358 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 359\nSouth Georgia and South Sandwich Islands belong to the United Kingdom, but are claimed by Argentina, their\nnearest continental neighbor.\nThe remaining six British Overseas Territories count in the Caribbean tally.\nSECTION I \u2013 ACTUALLY, IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, BUT NEAR THE CARIBBEAN SEA\n1 \u2013 Bermuda\nBermuda is in the Atlantic Ocean, east of North and South Carolina. As such, it really isn\u2019t in the Caribbean Sea,\nbut often is grouped with those islands. (See the essay on defining the LACAR region.) The first British sailors to\nreach Bermuda, actually arrived by shipwreck in 1609; nevertheless, Britain has controlled the island ever since.\nStrikingly, the island is famed for the adjacent Bermuda Triangle, a region bounded by Miami, Puerto Rico, and\nBermuda. This Bermuda Triangle is a legendary zone where airplanes and ships are said to have wrecked and\/\nor disappeared mysteriously. Computative analysis indicates that the number of planes and ships lost there is not\nstatistically different than would occur by random chance for the large number of vessels passing through the\nregion.\n2 \u2013 Turks and Caicos Islands\nThese islands are immediately north of the Windward Passage, the strait that separates Cuba from Haiti.\nOriginally settled by Taino and Lucayan natives, the islands were visited by Christopher Columbus\u2019 ships in 1492.\nSubsequently, the islands were ruled under French, Spanish, and British control respectively, but left to Britain\nwith the Treaty of Versailles. Under British rule, the islands at times were paired with the Bahamas and with\nJamaica, but the Turks and Caicos have been separate since 1973. \u201cTurks\u201d refers to a cactus that features a red\ntop, reminiscent off the Turkish hat \u2013 the fez.\nX \u2013 the Bahamas\nThe Bahamas are not included as a British Overseas Territory, despite the fact that the islands were included as\na colony of the United Kingdom. Of course, now the Bahamas is an independent country. Thus, the X for the\nBahamas in this list.\nHowever, the islands listed here as 1-2-X create the British insular triangle of historical control over these\nAtlantic, not truly Caribbean, island sets.\nSECTION II \u2013 WITHIN THE LESSER ANTILLES\n3 \u2013 British Virgin Islands (BVI)\nThe islands, grouped with the U.S. Virgin Islands, were named in honor of St. Ursula, whose legendary and\nmany varied accounts feature her martyrdom along with that of her group of virgin maiden followers. There\nare more than four dozen islands in this group, but the larger populated islands are Tortola, Virgin Gorda, and\nAnegada. Anguilla is to the southeast of BVI. 360 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n4 \u2013 Anguilla\nAt only 35 square miles in area, Anguilla is the 59thlargest island in the Caribbean. In 1967 Anguilla marked the\n300thanniversary of British colonial control. For approximately the second half of those three centuries, Anguilla\nwas in a British partnership with nearby islands St. Kitts and Nevis. Often unhappy with that arrangement, Anguilla\neventually broke away, securing its independence in 1967; however, the actual goal of this move instead was alone\nto be a British colony. Thus, after two years of independence, Anguilla was happy to have its request granted,\nrejoining the British Empire. This move from independence to colonial land would seem to be the only such\nvoluntary act in history.\nY \u2013 St. Kitts and Nevis\nSt. Kitts (technically St. Christopher, but always the nickname is used) and Nevis lie next from BVI in this\nsoutheastern arc of islands. These islands were the last British islands in the Caribbean to gain independence.\nThus, we add the letter Y to this list of British territories, as St. Kitts and Nevis no longer are included as a British\nOverseas Territory.\nZ \u2013 Antigua and Barbuda\nAntigua in 1632 and Barbuda in 1678 were secured as British colonies, not gaining independence until 1981. They\nnow belong in the British Commonwealth. In 2017, Hurricane Irma essentially destroyed everything on Barbuda,\ncompelling survivors to relocate to Antigua.\n5 \u2013 Montserrat\nSome say that Montserrat greatly resembles Ireland, except for the volcano. Hmm, that would seem to be a\nbig difference! In July 1995, the volcano Soufri\u00e8re Hills erupted, devastating the southern half of the island. The\nvolcano remained active to varying degrees on through 2010. The capital city Plymouth was destroyed. The\nsouthern half of the island remains in an exclusion zone, uninhabitable and with very restricted access.\nSo, this part of the insular chain is listed here as 3-4-Y-Z-5. These are the more northern British islands of the\nCaribbean chain of smaller islands \u2013 the Lesser Antilles. Skipping a few islands such as the historically French\nislands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, the traditionally British islands of the Caribbean continue. These now\nindependent countries, but former British colonies, include Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\nBarbados, Grenada, and Trinidad and Tobago.\nSECTION III \u2013 IN THE CARIBBEAN, BUT AN ODD FIT\n6 \u2013 Cayman Islands\nLocated south of Cuba and west of Jamaica, in a sense the Cayman Islands are out of place. They are small, like\nthe Lesser Antilles, but they do not lie in that chain of islands separating the east side of the Caribbean Sea from\nthe open Atlantic Ocean. Like the Turks and Caicos, the Cayman Islands once was paired with Jamaica in British\nadministration, but now have status as a BOT. Given the nearby presence of Jamaica in the Greater Antilles, the\nCayman Islands could fit into that sub-group of the Caribbean, except that its area is insufficient to be counted as\n\u201cGreater.\u201d LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 361\nThe name Cayman comes from the Spanish word caimanthat means alligator. In the Cayman Islands, there are\ntwo species of crocodiles \u2013 the American and the Cuban. The caiman, a smaller relative of alligators and crocodiles,\ndoes not live in the Cayman Islands, though their habitat does include Cuba, Puerto Rico and several continental\ncountries of Central and South America.\nOverall, the British Overseas Territories fit into three categories. The technically Atlantic islands of Bermuda\nand the paired Turks and Caicos fall there along with the independent Bahamas. BVI, Anguilla, and Monterrat are\namidst numerous former British colonies in that eastern set of Caribbean islands known as the Lesser Antilles. The\nCayman Islands are found near Jamaica, thus historically cohesive, but not so in size.\nThe British Overseas Territories also each have a unique element. Bermuda is infamous of the perhaps myth of\nthe dangerous Bermuda Triangle. The Turks were named for a cactus that looks like it has a red hat. The British\nVirgin Islands have a strange naming legend. Anguilla is the colony that became independent only to request and\nreceive reversion to colonial status. Montserrat is a half-destroyed volcanic island. The Cayman Islands don\u2019t have\ncaimans, but are named for alligators, yet have crocodiles.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe 1982 war between the United Kingdom and Argentina was fought over the Falkland Islands primarily, though Argentina forces briefly\ndid take over South Georgia. The British Navy prevailed in this war.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\n\u201cCayman Islands Dangerous Plants and Animals | IEyeNews.\u201d n.d. IEyeNews.

CHAPTER 75\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Physical\nGeography II\nPrecipitation\nWhile the temperature patterns in Latin America are relatively\nsimple, the precipitation patterns are incredibly complex. Part of\nthis is because Latin America covers nearly 90\u02da of latitude from\nnorth to south\u2014half the planet. As a result, it passes through many\nof the different global pressure systems that help to determine the\nworld\u2019s precipitation patterns. Complicating matters is the wall of\nmountains that runs the length of the region from north to south.\nAs is discussed in Chapter 6, the subtropical highs are located in\nvarious places around the world at about 30\u02da north and south. The\nsubtropical highs create dry conditions. The subtropical highs also\ngenerate the westerlies \u2013 winds that move poleward from the\nsubtropical highs, but deflect because of the Coriolis effect and\nblow from west to east across the midlatitudes. The subtropical\nRain in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Photo by Rafael Vianna\nhighs also generate the trade winds, which head toward the\nCroffi on Flickr.\nequator, blowing from the northeast in the northern hemisphere,\nand from the southeast in the southern hemisphere. Finally, the\ntrade winds converge near the equator, creating the very wet intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). All of these\nfeatures shift throughout the year, sliding north in June, July, and August, and sliding south in December, January,\nand February.\nHere, we\u2019ll have a look at the four basic kinds of precipitation patterns \u2013 those places that are wet year-round,\nthose places with wet summers and dry winters, those places with dry summers and wet winters, and those places\nthat are dry year-round. We\u2019ll conclude with a brief look at another complicating precipitation factor: El Ni\u00f1o.\n1. Places that are wet year-round:\n\u2022 The Amazon Basin. Most of the Amazon Basin is wet year-round, largely because it is right along the\nequator, the home of the ITCZ. Rainfall is heavy in all months. This is why the Amazon River is world\u2019s\nbiggest river (It\u2019s not the world\u2019s longest river \u2013 that distinction belongs to the Nile \u2013 but it does carry more\nwater than any other river on earth, and by a very wide margin).\n362 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY II 363\n\u2022 The Caribbean Side of Central America. The northeast trade winds that arrive in this area blow across\nthe Caribbean Sea, and those warm air mass pick up enormous amounts of water vapor year-round.\n\u2022 Southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, and Uruguay. The southeast trade winds\nbring plenty of moisture off the Atlantic and drop it in the midlatitudes of South America.\n\u2022 Southern Chile. Here, the westerlies consistently bring moisture in off the Pacific Ocean.\n2. Places that have wet summers and dry winters:\n\u2022 Southern Venezuela and Southwestern Brazil. As mentioned above, the ITCZ shifts north from the\nequator in June, July, and August, and shifts south of the equator in December, January, and February. This\nmeans it arrives in southern Venezuela during its summer, bringing lots of rainfall. The ITCZ then arrives\nin southwestern Brazil during its summer (keep in mind, summer in the southern hemisphere happens\nsix months after it does in the northern hemisphere).\n\u2022 Southern Mexico and the Pacific Side of Central America: The main source of moisture at this latitude\nare the trade winds, which are blocked in a rain shadow effect by the mountains of southern Mexico and\nCentral America. Still, the heating of the earth in the summertime causes air to rise off the land, causing\nlow pressure at the surface. This draws moist air masses in off the Pacific Ocean, generating summertime\nprecipitation. It\u2019s a sort of miniature version of the monsoons that bring rain to India in the summer.\n3. Places that have dry summers and wet winters:\n\u2022 Central Chile. This area has a Mediterranean climate, just like California and southern Europe. In the\nsummer, the subtropical high over northern Chile shifts south over central Chile, causing dry conditions.\nIn the winter, the subtropical high shifts north, as do the westerlies, which bring moisture in off the Pacific,\ncausing wet conditions.\n4. Places that are dry year-round:\n\u2022 Northern Mexico. Just like the southwestern U.S., the near constant presence of the subtropical high\nkeeps this region dry most of the year.\n\u2022 Northern Central Venezuela. The Andes Mountains generally run north-south, but they curve east-west\nin northern Venezuela. As the trade winds blow in off the Caribbean, they dump moisture on the northern\nside of those mountains, but there is a small rain shadow effect on the southern side.\n\u2022 The Patagonia: Southern Argentina lies in the westerlies, but it is also west of the Andes, so the Patagonia\nfalls in a rain shadow of those mountains. 364 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n\u2022 The Atacama Desert: The Atacama Desert of northern\nChile is the world\u2019s driest place. Weather stations in the\nAtacama have sometimes gone multiple years without\nrecording a single drop of precipitation. Some parts of this\ndesert are so dry that bacteria don\u2019t even live there. There\nare three major causes of deserts around the world \u2013\nsubtropical highs, rain shadows, and cold coasts \u2013 and the\nAtacama Desert, remarkably, is caused by all three. It is\nunder a subtropical high year-round, which would make it\ndry anyway. One potential source for moisture is from the\ntrade winds coming in from the Atlantic, but the Atacama\nis in a rain shadow of the Andes Mountains. The only other Atacama Desert, Chile. Photo by Guilherme\npotential source of moisture is the Pacific, but the waters Bustamante on Unsplash\noff the coast of Chile are extremely cold, the result of the\nPeru Current, which runs from Antarctica and up the coast\nof South America. That cold water chills the breezes that flow off the ocean, and that cold air cannot\ncontain much water vapor.\nComplicating matters is an unusual weather phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o. As mentioned above, the waters\noff the Pacific Coast of Latin America are usually quite cold, causing the coastal areas to be relatively dry. Every two\nto seven years, however, a temperature inversion occurs in the eastern Pacific, causing the waters off the coast\nof Latin America to become unusually warm. This warm water heats up the air that passes over it, allowing those\nair masses to absorb large volumes of water vapor. The result is several months of unusually wet weather. Under\nparticularly severe El Ni\u00f1o conditions, much of Pacific Latin America suffers flooding and mudslides. Usually, El\nNi\u00f1o events begin in the late months of a year, and then last through the following year\u2019s spring and summer. The\nlast major El Ni\u00f1o event occurred in 2015-2016.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon was named by Peruvian fishermen. They noticed that heavy rains would follow the warming of ocean water.\nThe water often began warming up at the beginning of Advent \u2013 the weeks in December on the Christian liturgical calendar that lead up to\nChristmas. So, they named the approaching phenomenon after the approach of the Christ Child \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCroffi, Rafael Vianna. 2016.

CHAPTER 76\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Political\nGeography II\nPuerto Rico - A Shaken Island\nCHRISTIAN GOERGEN\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, about 1000 miles southeast of\nMiami. With a total area of 5320 square miles, it is the smallest of the Greater Antilles islands, just about 100\nmiles long and 50 miles wide. While the 3.2 million inhabitants of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens, Puerto Rico is not\na U.S. state but is considered an associated or unincorporated territory to the U.S. The U.S. Congress holds the\nultimate power over Puerto Rico but Puerto Ricans cannot vote in U.S. elections and the UN Special Committee on\nDecolonization has frequently called on the U.S. government to initiate a process \u201cthat would allow Puerto Ricans\n1\nto fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.\u201d\nWhile the Puerto Rican standard of living is among the highest in Latin America, the island has struggled for\nmany years with economic decline and rising debt. In 2016 this came to a head and the U.S. Congress passed into\n2\nlaw the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act or PROMESA. The law tries to address\nthe debt by establishing an oversight board and a process for restructuring the debt but also has the power to\n365 366 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\napprove infrastructure projects. Known in Puerto Rico as \u201cla junta de control fiscal\u201d the board was very unpopular\nfrom the start as another reminder of Puerto Rico\u2019s quasi-colonial status.\nJust when the opposition to PROMESA gained strength, an\neven more devastating natural event hit the island. On\nWednesday, September 20th, 2017, the category 5 hurricane\nMaria struck the southern side of Puerto Rico and crossed the\nentire island, leaving behind massive devastation. While the\noriginal death toll was reported as 64, later studies found that\nclose to 3,000 people lost their lives as a result of Maria. Tens\nof thousands lost their home, while the entire island was\nwithout fresh water and electricity for weeks and sometimes\nmonths. Water, food, medicine and fuel were all in very short\nsupply. Over 100,000 people left the island for good to resettle\nelsewhere. The total damage to the island has been estimated\nHurricane Maria. NASA Earth Observatory to be close to $100 billion. Thus, Maria was the deadliest\nnatural disaster in U.S. history.\nThe above images are from the NASA Earth Observatory. On the left is a view of the light pattern of a night at\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico. On the right is the same location, but as a composite of the nights of September 27-28,\n2017, after Hurricane Maria struck the island.\nIn 2019, after two years of intense efforts of rebuilding the infrastructure, life on the island was slowly returning\nto a resemblance of normal when a new wave of political and natural disturbances hit Puerto Rico. In July, a series\nof text messages between Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, members of his cabinet, and lobbyists became public. In\nthose chats, the men were mocking women and victims of hurricane Maria using crass and vulgar language. In\naddition, a scandal erupted, accusing Rossell\u00f3 and others of a multi-billion-dollar corruption scheme. Massive\nstreet protests ensued, calling for Rossell\u00f3\u2019s removal. By some estimates close to 500,000 people gathered in San\n3\nJuan, for one of the largest protests in the island\u2019s history. Rossell\u00f3 resigned on August 2nd, 2019.\nBased on the Puerto Rican Constitution, the person in line to take over if a governor dies or resigns is the secretary\nof state. Shortly before stepping down, Rossell\u00f3 had appointed a congressional representative Pedro Pierluisi,\na close ally, to that post and he was indeed sworn in on August 2nd. However, cries of foul play emerged\nimmediately. The president of the Senate, Thomas Rivera Schatz, filed a challenge with the Supreme Court of\nPuerto Rico, arguing that Pierluisi\u2019s appointment was invalid, since he had only been approved by the House\nth\nbut not the Senate. The Supreme Court concurred and Pierluisi was removed from office on August 7 and LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 367\nreplaced by the Minister of Justice, Wanda Vazquez. Vazquez, who at first was reluctant to take the position, was\nconstitutionally next in line, since the secretary of state position was vacant. Thus, Puerto Rico has the dubious\ndistinction of having three different governors within one week.\nWhile the new governor was struggling to clean up the mess left behind by the previous administration, nature\nth\ncreated a new shock for Puerto Rico \u2013 literally. At 2:24 am local time on January 7 , 2020, a magnitude 6.4\nearthquake hit the southwest region of Puerto Rico. In the cities of Ponce and Guanica, thousands of people ran\ninto the streets searching for safety. This was the strongest earthquake to hit Puerto Rico in over 100 years and\nthe government declared a state of emergency. Small shocks had started to occur in December and continued\nin the aftermath of the 6.4 quake. Around 800 buildings were damaged and approximately 8000 people were\ndisplaced. For weeks entire families were sleeping in the streets and in public parks due to their fear of another\nbig quake. The quakes also led to an outpouring of support by people around the island who delivered supplies\nand support for the local population. Between December 2019 and June 2020 close to 10,000 earthquakes have\nbeen registered in and around Puerto Rico, mostly on the south side. Most of them are minor quakes between 2.0\nand 3.0 on the Richter scale. So why all this shaking? The U.S. Geological Survey explains that Puerto Rico is located\nbetween the North American and the Caribbean tectonic plates which has an active plate boundary. In addition,\nPuerto Rico is surrounded by deep ocean trenches including the Puerto Rico trench with a depth of 8,400 meters\n4\n(27,000 ft).\nth\nThe first cases of COVID-19 \u2013 two Italian tourists \u2013 were confirmed in Puerto Rico on March 13 , 2010. However,\nthe new governor Wanda Vazquez had acted pre-emptively and created a COVID-19 task force at the end of\nth\nFebruary to deal with the emerging threat. She declared a state of emergency on March 12 \u2013 with zero local cases\n\u2013 and enacted strict rules to stop the spread of the virus. The whole island was under curfew from 7:00 pm to 5:00\nam. All businesses were closed except for pharmacies, gas stations and grocery stores. No one was to leave the\nhouse except for emergencies and food shopping. No social gatherings of any kind were permitted. Businesses\nwho violated the rules faced a fine of $5000 or 6 months in jail. Even the beaches were off limits.\nGovernor Vasquez supposedly modeled her response after that of Singapore, another island nation. However,\nPuerto Rico did not benefit much from its island status since there was a steady stream of expatriates returning to\nSan Juan airport, many of them from Corona hotspots New York and Miami. In addition, cruise ships had delivered\nthe first cases of COVID-19 to Puerto Rico. While the government was able to stop the docking of cruise ships\nth\nearly on, it took Vazquez until April 8 to request that the FAA (Federal Aviation Agency) stop flights from U.S.\nhotspots. The number of flights was reduced, but it never came to a full stop and it is safe to assume that Puerto\nRico received most of its initial cases from the outside. Overall, Puerto Rico\u2019s strict \u2013 some would say draconian \u2013\nmeasures have been successful. At the beginning of June, the total number of affected people is still below 5000\nand the number of deaths stands at 142. That constitutes a rate of about 45 death per million in Puerto Rico,\ncompared to about 300 death per million in the U.S.\nThe 12-month period from June 2019 to June 2020\nhas been one of the most challenging this small island\nhas had to face. However, political turmoil, natural\ndisaster and pandemic did not bring Puerto Rico to its\nknees. It is a tribute to the resilience and\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico.

CHAPTER 77\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Population\nGeography II\nBrazil as a Top Five Country\nBrazil is a huge country that ranks highly in many different categories. Let\u2019s take a look at Brazil\u2019s Top Five\nrankings.\nFirst of all, for nearly three decades Brazil stood fifth in the world in total population. Whereas China and India\nboth have over 1.3 billion people, far ahead of any other countries, Brazil houses 212 million people in 2020. Upon\nthe breakup of the Soviet Union and Russia\u2019s corresponding drop out of the top five countries by population,\nBrazil took over fifth place. However, Brazil\u2019s total fertility rate has been declining for a number of years, so that\nBrazil\u2019s hold on fifth place did not last. Pakistan now has passed Brazil for fifth place. Additionally, Nigeria is slated\nto pass Brazil, at least by 2030. In fact, some sources suggest that Nigeria already has passed Brazil; however,\nwith the vagaries of calculating population size, especially in a dynamic country like Nigeria, it is difficult to gain a\nprecise count. Nigeria is increasing rapidly, so while Brazil has a birth rate of 13.6 and a death rate of 6.6, Brazil\u2019s\nnatural population increase this year should be about 0.7%, definitely lower than that of Nigeria.\nDue to the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494, Portugal secured territorial rights to Brazil. Although Brazil gained\nindependence in 1822, the Portuguese language has remained its official language through the current day.\nPortugal has ten million people speaking Portuguese. People in its former colonies do speak Portuguese as well \u2013\n369 370 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n30 million in Angola, 27 million in Mozambique, and a scattered several million elsewhere. Obviously then, Brazil\nis the most populated country that speaks Portuguese.\nSecond, Brazil holds the fifth most area in the world with a bit under 3.3 million square miles. This fifth position\nwill hold for the foreseeable future, as change would require land losses or acquisitions by war or treaty. Changes\nsuch as these are very unlikely.\nThis large area naturally has major landscape features. For Brazil, the most obvious is the Amazon Rainforest\nthat is the largest forest in the world. The corresponding Amazon River is the largest in the world in terms of\nvolume of discharge. While some cite the Amazon as the longest river in the world, most commonly the Nile River\nis considered #1 and the Amazon #2 in length.\nBrazil\u2019s vast area also is productive for agriculture,\nthough there are significant environmental concerns\nover the destruction of rainforest for conversion into\ncrop fields or grazing land. In any case Brazil\u2019s\nfarmland is productive, leading to large volumes of\nagricultural exports. Brazil is famed for coffee, rightly\nso, for it is the world\u2019s largest producer and exporter of\ncoffee, accounting for 30% of the planet\u2019s coffee\nmarket. Coffee is not Brazil\u2019s only huge contribution to\nthe Earth\u2019s beverage supply. As with coffee, orange\njuice ranks #1 worldwide in production in and export\nfrom Brazil.\nIn other crops Brazil scores a Top Five ranking,\nincluding cane sugar, soybeans, corn, cotton, and\nAmazon River. Photo by Nareeta Martin on Unsplash tobacco. Sugar cane also is used for the production of\nethanol fuels, where again Brazil ranks number one in\nthe world.\nSignificant agricultural lands are used for grazing herds, not just for growing crops. In Brazil the total head\nof beef cattle nearly matches the number of people in the country. Across the globe, Brazil is the number one\nexporter of beef and chicken.\nBrazil\u2019s large territory contains a variety of natural resources. In worldwide exports, Brazil ranks #2 in iron ore,\n#3 in bauxite (for aluminum), and #5 in tin. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): POPULATION GEOGRAPHY II 371\nAdditionally, Brazil has the second greatest amount of installed hydroelectric capacity.\nIn an unfortunate new category, as of June 13, 2020, Brazil ranked #2 in total numbers of COVID-19 deaths,\nsurpassing the United Kingdom, but trailing the United States by a wide margin.\nOverall, Brazil #5 area gives it enough land to excel in the production of a variety of agricultural products and\nnatural resources.

CHAPTER 78\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Urban\nGeography II\nSmart Cities\nIn 2012, scholar Boyd Cohen designed the Smart City Wheel to examine the features of the modern digital city.\nIn this context, \u201csmart\u201d does mean intelligent, but especially in the sense of using technology to produce safe,\nproductive, and transparent environments for those who dwell in these cities. Let\u2019s consider Cohen\u2019s model and\nlook at his rankings for Latin American cities, for he did consult for cities and countries in LACAR regarding urban\nlife. We can note the worldwide context too. In addition, let\u2019s look at other reports ranking cities worldwide and\nsee how well cities in LACAR fare.\nThough Boyd Cohen created the Smart City Wheel, he is not a graphic artist, so his design was a bit\ncrude. Thankfully, a colleague Manuchis redesigned the model in a visual appealing form. Here \u2014\nhttps:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/The-Smart-city-wheel-by-Boyd-Cohen_fig3_317269039\nThe Smart City Wheel had six main dimensions, all addressing elements of a modern technological city.\n1 \u2013 Smart economy\nAn element of the smart economy is the digital startup company. Often these companies are dynamic elements\nof the modern economy and when successful are a boon to any urban area. In 2020 for the Global Startup\nEcosystem ranking of cities for their economic climates open to digital startup companies, Sao Paulo, Brazil, at #30\n372 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 373\nwas the only LACAR city in the top forty. In the related Emerging Ecosystem ranking of cities, only Santiago, Chile\n(top 81-90) and Curitiba, Brazil (top 91-100) were in the top 100.\n2 \u2013 Smart environment\nIn this dimension, the city needs to be green. This includes smart buildings that meet LEED standards. City\ngovernment uses big data and GIS in urban planning. The city\u2019s resources are developed and expended in efficient\nand fair methods. Vienna, Austria, is looking to use blockchain technology in managing renewable energy.\n3 \u2013 Smart government\nA modern smart city government utilizes the efficiencies of online services. Bureaucratic snarls and red tape\nare reduced as digital forms and online processing speeds procedures. Government reports and meetings can be\nviewed online, so that transparency of urban politics reduces corruption.\n4 \u2013 Smart living\nThrough improvements in health and safety, quality of life is enhanced. Healthier and safer people are more\ncapable of utilizing their own human capital to create more successful and happier lives. In 2020, we look to\nemphasize how transparency in police work is beneficial for urban populations. 374 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\n5 \u2013 Smart mobility\nTransportation geography is served well by big data and GIS, developing efficient transportation networks,\nsetting up variable cost toll roads, and integrating different modes of transportation. Pairing with the smart\nenvironment dimension, smart mobility includes green public transportation that runs on electricity or natural\ngas.\n6 \u2013 Smart people\nEducation is essential for smart people. Social sciences, like Geography, promote inclusive societies that\nunderstand that creativity and synergy multiply when the ideas, talents, and skills of diverse populations are\nencouraged and rewarded.\nFurthermore, Cohen views smart cities as moving in phases \u2013 1.0) technology-driven, 2.0) technology-enabled,\ncity-led, and 3.0) citizen co-creation. In 3.0, Medellin, Colombia, stands out as the Urban Land Institute\u2019s Innovative\nCity of the Year Award in 2013.\nAlthough difficult to measure these dimensions statistically, in 2013 Cohen did list the top eight smartest cities\nin Latin America. These were:\n1 \u2013 Santiago, Chile\n2 \u2013 Mexico City\n3 \u2013 Bogota, Colombia\n4 \u2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina\n5 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n6 \u2013 Curitiba, Brazil\n7 \u2013 Medellin, Colombia\n8 \u2013 Montevideo, Uruguay,\nThe multinational consulting firm Mercer annually ranks cities worldwide in terms of quality of life. For the tenth\nyear in a row, their 2019 report placed Vienna, Austria as the #1 city. For LACAR, the highest-ranking city was\nMontevideo, Uruguay, at #78.\n78 \u2013 Montevideo, Uruguay\n91 \u2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina\n93 \u2013 Santiago, Chile\n113 \u2013 Monterrey, Mexico\n118 \u2013 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n129 \u2013 Mexico City\n228 out of 231 cities ranked \u2013 Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\nIt makes sense that there is some overlap between the best LACAR cities on these two ranked lists.\nThese are challenges that urban geographers love \u2013 ranking, modeling, and explaining urban forms and\nactivities. While LACAR cities do not rank near the top of worldwide standards in many urban measures, the high\nurban percentages in LACAR cities combined with a drive to move from the economic periphery to the economic\ncore of the world propel many of this region\u2019s cities to noteworthy smart gains.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nIn 2014, Cohen listed these 25 cities as the smartest in LACAR. S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Medellin, Curitiba,\nMonterrey, Brasilia, Bogot\u00e1, Panama City, Salvador, Belo Horizonte, Puebla, Recife, Cordoba, San Salvador, Porto Alegre, San Jose (Costa Rica),\nGuadalajara, Valpara\u00edso, Caracas, Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), Montevideo, Santiago, Lima.\nAlso in 2014, the mayor of Barcelona, Spain, created the Fab City Global Initiative, challenging cities by the year 2054 to produce everything LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 375\nthey consume. The Fab City Network now includes Santiago in Chile, Mexico City, Puebla, and the Yucatan region of Mexico, and Belo-\nHorizonte, Recife, Sorocaba, and Sao Paulo in Brazil.\nFor 2019, Mercer ranked Vancouver, British Columbia, tied for #3 in the world for quality of life.\nThe European Digital City Index in 2016 ranked London as Europe\u2019s most attractive city for digital entrepreneurs. Tallinn, Estonia \u2013 see\nChapter 61 \u2013 was ranked #18 out of 60 noted cities. In the startupgenome.com survey of the top 100 emerging ecosystem regions for startup\ncompanies, Estonia ranked #14.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nChaiwong, Manthana. n.d.

CHAPTER 79\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Overview\nIn the various essays about Latin America and the Caribbean (LACAR) in this textbook, there are many facts\npresented and many ways of life understood. After reading the textbook, students or other readers should know\nand understand many things about LACAR. Also, as has been stated, it is not the point of this textbook to attempt\nto convey every possible bit of knowledge about LACAR. However, there are a few basics about Latin America and\nthe Caribbean that the reader should know, whether picked up in previous chapters or not.\nAs explained in Chapter 63, delineating this region, let\u2019s recall that we are defining this region based mainly\non three factors \u2013 Americas, Latin languages, and contiguity. Accepting those factors, what else should we know\nabout the region, in general?\nPhysical Geography: Latin America\nLandforms\nThe most substantial highlands in Latin America are concentrated in Mexico, Central America, and along the\nPacific side of South America. These mountains are the result of the same geological processes that created the\nSierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains in the United States. The tectonic plates that lie beneath eastern Pacific Ocean\nare slowly moving to the east, colliding with and slipping beneath the tectonic plates of the American landmasses.\nThe results of this collision are folding \u2013 the wrinkling of the earth\u2019s surface that causes mountains to bend upward\n\u2013 and volcanism, which is the formation of volcanic mountains. This tectonic boundary leaves much of this area\nsusceptible to both volcanic eruptions and devastating earthquakes.\nThe most significant mountain ranges in Mexico are\nknown as the Sierra Madre. In the northern two-thirds\nof Mexico, two mountain ranges parallel one another,\none on the eastern edge of the country, and one on the\nwestern edge. They are known as the Sierra Madre\nOccidental (Western) and Sierra Madre Oriental\n(Eastern). These are rugged mountains with significant\nelevations, some topping out over 18,000 feet. Resting\nbetween these two mountain ranges is Mexico\u2019s\nLake Atitlan in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Guatemala. Photo Central Plateau, a relatively flat landscape, but one at a\nby Daniel Mennerich on Flickr.\nsignificantly high elevation \u2013 Mexico City, at the\nsouthern end of the Plateau, is 7,300 feet above sea\nlevel. The two ranges of the Sierra Madre converge just south of Mexico City, and continue on into Central America.\nIn Central America, the elevation of these highlands generally drops, although some peaks reach over 13,000 feet.\nKnown by different names in different countries, these mountains and hills are collectively known as the Central\nAmerican Highlands, and extend the length of the Central American isthmus.\n376 LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 377\nIn South America, the mountains increase in elevation, running for Venezuela down the Pacific side of the\ncontinent to the Tierra del Fuego \u2013 the \u201cLand of Fire\u201d \u2013 South America\u2019s southern tip. Known as the Andes\nMountains, this range features incredible variations in in elevations, with the highest peaks rising above 22,000\nfeet.\nChile\u2019s Atacama Desert is the driest desert in the\nworld.\nThe only other highlands in Latin America are found\nin two sections on the eastern side of South America.\nThe Guiana Highlands are centered on southeastern\nVenezuela and the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, and\nFrench Guiana), as well as small sections of northern\nBrazil. The Brazilian Highlands cover much of the\nsoutheastern third of Brazil. Both of these highlands\nAtacama Desert. Photo by Jen Morgan on Flickr. are dissected plateaus \u2013 blocks of earth worn down my\nlong periods of erosion to form a hilly landscape\n(similar to the Ozarks in the United States). Landscapes in this region can be quite rugged, but elevations are\nrelatively low \u2013 they never reach above 10,000 feet.\nThe lowland areas in Latin America are concentrated mainly in the east. In Mexico and Central America, broad\nplains descend from the highlands toward the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, including the large, flat Yucatan\nPeninsula of Mexico, which is geologically similar to a Florida. In South America, there are vast plains and basins\neast of the Andes, including the Llanos of Colombia and Venezuela; the enormous Amazon Basin of northern Brazil\nand eastern Colombia and Peru; the Gran Chaco of southern Brazil, western Paraguay, northern Argentina, and\neastern Bolivia; the Pampas of Uruguay and eastern Argentina; and the Patagonia of southern Argentina.\nThe Pantanal, the world\u2019s largest tropical wetland, is\nmainly in Brazil, but crosses borders into Bolivia and\nParaguay.\nClimate\nTemperatures drop significantly as elevation\nincreases, and there are plenty of high elevations in\nLatin America. At low elevations, though, the\ntemperature patterns are relatively simple. Most of the\nregion falls in the tropics and subtropics. The Tropic of\nCancer (23.5\u02daN) cuts across the heart of Mexico, and\nthe Tropic of Capricorn (23.5\u02daS) runs just south of Rio\nPantanal. Photo by Raphael Milani on Flickr.\nde Janeiro, in southern Brazil. That means that 378 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nsouthern Mexico, Central America, and the northern three-quarters of South America all fall within the tropics.\nTemperature varies little from month to month in the tropics, so these locations experience warm temperature\nyear-round (at least at low elevations).\nThe areas of Latin America outside the tropics are pretty warm, too. All of Mexico is farther South than\nDallas, Texas, meaning that even the midlatitudes of northern Mexico rarely get cold. Montevideo, Uruguay \u2013 the\nsouthernmost major metropolis in Latin America \u2013 is at 34\u02daS latitude, about the same distance from the equator\nas Atlanta, Georgia, which isn\u2019t exactly a cold place.\nThe only low elevations in Latin America that truly get cold are the southern sections of Chile and Argentina,\nwhere few people live. Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America, is located at 56\u02daS latitude, approximately\nthe same distance from the South Pole as Moscow is from the North Pole.\nFor an examination of the effects of altitude on temperature, see Chapter 68. For an examination of\nprecipitation in Latin America, see Chapter 75.\nPhysical Geography: The Caribbean Islands\nThe Caribbean Islands contain three major subdivisions. The Bahamas are grouping of flat islands in the\nnorthern reaches of the Caribbean archipelago. The Greater Antilles are large islands in the western Caribbean,\nincluding Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola (the island divided by Haiti and the Dominican Republic).\nThe Lesser Antilles are smaller islands in the eastern Caribbean that form a crescent between Puerto Rico and\nVenezuela. There are forty-two significant islands that make up the Lesser Antilles, and they\u2019re home to eight\nindependent countries: Antigua & Barbuda; Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts & Nevis; St. Lucia; St. Vincent\n& the Grenadines; and Trinidad & Tobago.\nMost of the Caribbean Islands were formed because of their location along the boundary of the North American\ntectonic plate and the Caribbean tectonic plate. If you play \u201cconnect the dots,\u201d tracing a line from Jamaica, across\nHispaniola, Puerto Rico, and down through the Lesser Antilles, you are essentially tracing that tectonic fault line.\nCuba is the largest of these islands, and it is by far the oldest, created about 900 million years ago by the same\ntectonic forces of folding and volcanism that formed the Central American Highlands. Because it is the oldest\nisland, it is also the flattest of the Greater Antilles. Most if the island lies off of the tectonic fault line, so the geologic\nforces that built the rest of the Caribbean have not been active in Cuba for a long time. The only part of Cuba\nthat does fall on the fault line is the eastern end of the island, which is, not coincidentally, the most mountainous\npart of the island. On most of the rest of Cuba, forces of erosion have been wearing away at the landscape for\nhundreds of millions of years. It mainly consists of rolling plains and low hills.\nThe rest of the islands of the Greater Islands are much younger, having formed over the last 100 to 200 million\nyears. All of them are of volcanic origin. As the Caribbean plate slides beneath North American plate, the rock\nmelts, and bubbles up to the surface as lava. A small volcano is then formed on the sea floor. Over thousands\nof years, those volcanoes got taller and taller, and as the lava flows merged, they formed an underwater volcanic\nmountain chain. Eventually, the tops of those mountains emerged above sea level to form the Greater Antilles.\nThose volcanoes have long been dormant, so the forces of erosion have been wearing away at them for millions\nof years. Still, these islands are relatively young, so the process of erosion hasn\u2019t had as much time to work on\nthem as they have on Cuba. Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Jamaica are considerably hillier than Cuba. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 379\nThe Lesser Antilles are essentially younger versions of the\nGreater Antilles. Because of that, they are much smaller, usually\nconsisting of one or two volcanic peaks. There are nineteen \u201clive\u201d\nvolcanoes in the Lesser Antilles \u2013 meaning that they could\npotentially erupt. The last major eruption occurred on the British\nisland of Montserrat in 1995. The eruption destroyed the island\u2019s\ncapital city, and forced most the colony\u2019s population to temporary\nflee. The region\u2019s presence on a tectonic fault line also makes it\nsusceptible to devastating earthquakes. One of the deadliest\noccurred in 2010, when an earthquake struck Haiti\u2019s capital of Port-\nAu-Prince, killing 160,000 people (as mentioned in Chapter 73).\nPinel Island, Sint Maarten.

The entire region falls in the tropics, and is mostly warm and wet year-round.\nHistorical Geography: Latin America\nIndigenous Cultures\nThe term \u201cindigenous\u201d is a generic term used to describe the original inhabitants of a place. In the Americas,\nthe indigenous population are often referred to as Native Americans. Other terms are \u201cFirst Nations\u201d or \u201cAmerican\nIndians.\u201d The use of the term Indian for indigenous Americans probably comes from the term \u201cIndies,\u201d an old\nterm used to describe the islands of southeast Asia where the modern-day country of Indonesia is located. The\nCaribbean islands \u2013 a tropical archipelago like Indonesia \u2013 were given the name \u201cWest Indies,\u201d and the people who\nlived there were known as \u201cWest Indians.\u201d The term Indian (indio in Spanish and Portuguese) stuck, and is used\nthroughout Latin America to this day.\nThe indigenous people of Latin America are the descendants of the first humans to reach the Americas, probably\nabout 14,000 years ago. This was during the last ice age, when global sea level had dropped. During that period,\nthere was a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska where the Bering Sea is now located \u2013 it is referred to as the\n\u201cBering Land Bridge.\u201d (See Chapter 97) Those humans slowly moved through unglaciated areas of what is now\nAlaska and Canada, and eventually fanned out into the areas south of the ice sheet. The oldest evidence of human\nhabitation in what we now call Latin America dates back about 12,000 years.\nAfter the European Conquest of the Americas, two myths about pre-Columbia Native Americans arose, and still\npersist in the minds of many today. One of the myths was that there were not many people in the Americas prior\nto the Conquest \u2013 maybe a few million. Both the historical and archeological record suggest otherwise. Estimates\nof Latin America\u2019s indigenous population in 1492 vary, but it was probably at least 50 million, and perhaps as high\nas 100 million. By comparison, the population of Europe in 1492 was about 70 million.\nThe other myth that persisted for centuries was that the indigenous civilizations of the Americas were not\nparticularly advanced. This is a common theme when it comes to the conqueror\u2019s story of indigenous people\neverywhere. History is much easier to swallow if the conquered people are characterized as \u201csavages\u201d who\nbenefited from the civilizing forces of the conqueror. 380 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBut the major pre-Columbian cultures of Latin America could\nhardly be characterized as \u201csavage\u201d or \u201cuncivilized.\u201d One of the\noldest major American civilizations was that of the Maya, which\npeaked between the 200s and 900s CE. The Maya inhabited\nmodern-day Belize, Guatemala, and parts of southern Mexico. The\nMaya demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of\nmathematics, astronomy, and agriculture, and people marvel at\ntheir architectural accomplishments to this day. One look at the\nfamous stepped pyramids of the Maya slays any myth that this was\nan unsophisticated society.\nWhen the European Conquest was underway, two major\ncivilizations in Latin America were still thriving. The Aztecs occupied\nthe southern end of Mexico\u2019s Central Plateau, with their capital at\nEl Castillo, Chichen Itza, Mexico.\nTenochtitlan (the present location of Mexico City). The Inca\nPhoto by Guy Dugas from Pixabay.\ncontrolled a 2,000-mile long empire in the Andes Mountains, with\ntheir capital at the present-day city of Cuzco, Peru. While neither\ncivilization possessed all the technologies that had been invented in the Old World, some of their technology, and\ntheir level of social organization, did rival those of European, Asian, and African civilizations.\nThe Aztecs employed advanced urban planning in their cities, and had running water piped into their homes.\nThe Aztecs had highly advanced trade and taxation systems, and their surviving architecture, like that of the\nMaya, are still impressive today. The Inca ran one of the most efficiently managed empires in world history. They\norganized cooperative labor, and had reciprocal food production systems to make sure that no part of the empire\nwent hungry. The Inca built impressive structures, and their elaborate transportation system tamed one of the\nmost difficult topographies on earth. Perhaps most impressively, historians believed that residents of both the\nAztec and Inca civilizations had remarkably high standards of living \u2013 eating better and living longer than their\ncontemporaries in Europe.\nThe Conquest\nAs mentioned above, Christopher Columbus, and Italian navigator working for the Spanish government,\ndiscovered the Americas. He was seeking a trade route to Asia, and made landfall in the Caribbean in 1492. This\ndiscovery would lead to the first permanent European settlements in the Americas. Shortly after, the Portuguese\narrived in what is now Brazil, and began colonizing it in the early 1500s. In 1519, troops led by Spain\u2019s Hernan\nCortez defeated the Aztecs, and Spain slowly began to assume control of Mexico and Central America. In 1533,\ntroops led by Spain\u2019s Francisco Pizzaro defeated the Inca, and Spain assumed control over Andean South America.\nWe will discuss the nature of colonization as we conclude historical geography, and as we look at cultural\nand economic geography. Briefly, though, the Spanish and Portuguese colonizers had two basic goals in the\ncolonization of Latin America: obtain raw materials for merchants in Europe, and convert the indigenous people\nto Catholicism.\nOne of the immediate results of colonization was the mass die-off of Native Americans. Part of this was due to\nconflict and deprivation the Native Americans suffered as they were conquered, subjugated, and displaced. By far\nthe biggest killer, though, were diseases introduced by the European colonizers (recall Chapter 67).\nMost Latin American countries gained their independence in the 1810s, including Paraguay, Argentina, Chile,\nColombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, or in the 1820s, including Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Uruguay, Brazil, and Spanish\nCentral America. For an examination of the legacy of colonial economics, remember the discussion in Chapter 66.\nHistorical Geography: The Caribbean LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 381\nThe Caribbean takes its name from the original inhabitants of the islands. The Carib were Native Americans who\nbegan to populate the islands about 6,000 years ago. The vast majority of them died within the first century of\nEuropean colonization due to conflict, displacement, deprivation, and disease. Those who survived colonization\nwere largely assimilated by their colonizers. The Carib culture survived in tiny, remote pockets of the islands for a\nfew centuries, but has largely disappeared. The last native speaker of a Carib language died more than a century\nago.\nAs a result, the cultures of the Caribbean have largely been shaped by the forces of colonization. Columbus\nmade landfall in the Caribbean in 1492, and by the 1600s, most of the islands had been colonized. The colonial\nhistory and economics of the Caribbean are very similar to those of the rest of Latin America. Most of the region\nwas colonized for the purposes of plantation agriculture, timber extraction, or mining. Slavery was a common\npractice throughout the region. Like the rest of Latin America, colonization left a legacy of authoritarianism,\npoverty, and economic disparity in the Caribbean.\nThe major European colonizers were Spain (Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico), France (French\nGuiana and Haiti), Britain (Guyana, Belize, and Jamaica), and the Netherlands (Suriname). The Lesser Antilles were\ncolonized by these same four European countries, along with Denmark.\nThe first Caribbean country to gain its independence from Europe (and the second in the Americas, after\nthe United States) was Haiti, in 1804. Haitian slaves revolted against their French masters, and forced them off\nthe island. Unfortunately, a small group of mulattos (those of mixed African and French ancestry) then seized\ncontrol of the country. For decades, they would dominate its government, land, and wealth, locking the rest of the\npopulation into poverty. In the 1840s, the Spanish side of Hispaniola gained its independence, and the Dominican\nRepublic was formed.\nIn 1898, the United States seized control of Cuba and Puerto Rico from Spain in the Spanish-American War (the\nU.S. also seized several islands in the Lesser Antilles, as well as the Philippines in southeast Asia). The United States\ngranted Cuba \u201cindependence\u201d in 1902, although it would effectively remain a satellite state of the U.S. until 1959.\nIn 1952, Puerto Rico became a self-governing \u201ccommonwealth\u201d of the United States, earning some autonomy,\nalthough it remains a U.S. territory.\nMost of the rest of the Caribbean achieved independence relatively recently. In the 1960s, Jamaica, Trinidad &\nTobago, Barbados, and Guyana gained independence. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Bahamas, Belize, Suriname,\nand six small countries in the Lesser Antilles gained their independence.\nCultural Geography: Latin America\nReligion 382 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA primary goal of colonization was the conversion of Native\nAmericans to Roman Catholicism. Spain and Portugal were both\noverwhelmingly Catholic countries and, to their credit, some\nreligious leaders questioned the morality of colonization. Spain and\nPortugal were in the process of pushing Native Americans off their\nland and subjugating them to lowly political and economic status.\nSome of these leaders argued that the Spanish and Portuguese\ncouldn\u2019t do such things and still call themselves good Catholics.\nHowever, just as religion raised objections to colonization, it\nprovided a moral shortcut. It was concluded that, since Native\nAmericans were not Christians, they were bound for eternal\ndamnation. By colonizing Latin America and forcing the natives to\nconvert to Christianity, the Spanish and Portuguese were saving\nsouls. At least that\u2019s what they convinced themselves. As a result,\nthe Catholic Church became a major partner in the colonial\nprocess. The Church received large land grants, and Catholics\nmissions were established throughout the region. (It is worth\nnothing that this was policy in Spanish and Portuguese colonies\nthroughout the world. For example, only two countries in\nSoutheast Asia are predominantly Christian \u2013 the Philippines and\nEast Timor. It is not a coincidence that the former was a Spanish\ncolony, and the latter was a Portuguese colony). Today, Catholics\naccount for more than 90% of the populations of Argentina, Bolivia,\nColombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Venezuela, and Honduras, and are\nSanta Rita de Cassia, the largest Catholic statues in\nthe majority in every other Latin American country.\nthe world. Santa Cruz City, Brazil. Photo by\nA relatively small percentage of Latin America\u2019s population is\nMarinelson Almeida on Flickr.\nnon-religious, and there are very few non-Christian religious faiths.\nAside from Catholicism, the only other major religious group are\nProtestants. Few of the people who have immigrated to Latin America over the last 500 years arrived as\nProtestants. The growth of Protestantism in Latin America has largely been the result of missionary work to the\nregion, with many of the missionaries coming from the United States. Many prominent American Protestant\nmovements \u2013 Methodists, Episcopalians, Baptists, Mormons, and especially Pentecostals and Evangelicals \u2013 have\nestablished congregations throughout Latin America. The growth has been especially rapid since the 1980s, and\nProtestantism is now the fastest-growing religious movement in the region. While Protestants are nowhere close\nto outnumbering Catholics in Latin America, they now account for more than 10% of the populations of Brazil,\nChile, Peru, Uruguay, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Panama.\nLanguage\nThe linguistic geography of Latin America is pretty simple \u2013 the colonial language is dominant in every country.\nPortuguese is the dominant language in Brazil, and Spanish is the dominant language in every other Latin\nAmerican country (excluding some of the Caribbean countries, which we\u2019ll discuss later). Some Native American\nlanguages survived colonization, and still persist throughout the region, particularly in more remote rural areas. A\nprominent example is Quechua, the descendant of the old Inca language. Quechua is spoken as a first language\nby 13 million people in the Andes. In fact, there are a good number of people in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru who\nonly speak Quechua.\nThat said, the number of Quechua speakers, and the speakers of other indigenous languages like Guarani\nand Nahuatl, are declining. Just as English is the language of social mobility in the United States, Spanish and LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 383\nPortuguese are the languages of social mobility in Latin America. If someone from rural Peru chooses to migrate\nto a city, receive and education, and get a good job, they are almost certainly going to do so speaking Spanish, not\nQuechua.\nEthnicity\nMost Latin Americans trace their ancestry to three primary sources: to the Americas (that is, to Native\nAmericans), to Europe, or to Africa. A large portion of the region\u2019s population is of mixed ancestry. As we\u2019ve\ndiscussed before, ethnic identity is complex, but most Latin Americans can be placed in one of five categories:\nmestizos; Native American\/indigenous; European\/white; African\/black; or Asian.\nMestizos are people of mixed Native American and European ancestry, and they are the largest ethnic group\nin Latin America. This is something that makes Latin American culture very distinct from that of the United States\nand Canada. In those two countries, only a small fraction (other than Latinos) claim both European and Native\nAmerican ancestry. That\u2019s because early colonial settlements in the U.S. and Canada contained relatively balanced\npopulations of men and women, so it was relatively rare for Europeans and Native Americans to intermarry. In\nLatin America, a disproportionately large percentage of the colonizers were men. From the earliest days, it became\nvery common for European men and Native Americans women to marry.\nMestizos are the largest ethnic group in most Latin American countries, including Paraguay (95%), Honduras\n(90%), El Salvador (86%), Ecuador (79%), Bolivia (70%), Nicaragua (69%), Panama (65%), Venezuela (64%), Mexico\n(62%), Peru (60%), Guatemala (56%), and Colombia (49%).\nNative Americans in Latin America are a diverse group. It is important to remember that categorizing someone\nas \u201cNative American\u201d is like categorizing someone as \u201cEuropean.\u201d Certainly, the nations of Europe have some\nshared cultural traits, but no one would ever argue that the Irish, the Poles, the Germans, the Italians, and the\nGreeks are all pretty much the same. Similarly, there is considerable ethnic diversity within the Native American\ncategory.\nGenerally speaking, Native Americans usually have the lowest socioeconomic status in countries where they\nare common. This is largely the result of colonization. Native Americans were marginalized economically after\nthe Conquest, and Latin America\u2019s economies don\u2019t often provide many pathways out of poverty. Although some\nNative Americans have risen to social, political, and economic prominence, Latin America\u2019s indigenous populations\ngenerally suffer high rates of poverty.\nAs for spatial distribution, there is a very strong correlation between mountainous areas and Native Americans.\nSome of Latin America\u2019s most mountainous countries have its largest indigenous populations, including\nGuatemala (44%), Mexico (28%), Peru (26%), Bolivia (20%), and Chile (11%).\nPeople of European descent in Latin America are largely of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry, although some\nare descended from immigrants of other European countries, notably Italy, Britain, Germany, and France. They\nform the majority four Latin American countries, including Argentina (98%), Chile (89%), and Uruguay (88%). In its\ncensus, Costa Rica does not distinguish between white and mestizo. 86% of Costa Ricans identify as white\/mestizo,\nbut the country\u2019s history suggests that the majority of those people are white. People of European ancestry are\nalso the single largest ethnic group in Brazil (47%).\nIt is notable that most of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay fall in Latin America\u2019s mid-latitudes. In Brazil, Europeans\nare concentrated in the southern part of the country, which is also in the mid-latitudes. This matches an historical\npattern found throughout the world. Most of the world\u2019s \u201cNeo-Europes\u201d \u2013 places outside of Europe, but with large\npopulations of European ancestry \u2013 tend to be located in the midlatitudes, such as the United States, Canada,\nAustralia, and New Zealand.\nIn many countries, even where Europeans are a relatively small minority, they tend to be the economic and\npolitical elite. Just as the legacy of colonization left many Native Americans in poverty, it left many white people in\npositions of power. People of direct European ancestry are a significant minority in many countries in the region,\nincluding Colombia (37%), Venezuela (23%), Nicaragua (17%), El Salvador (13%), and Mexico (10%). 384 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nNearly all of Latin America\u2019s Black population are the descendants of African slaves, 10 million of whom were\nforcibly brought to the Americas between the 1500s and 1800s. As is the case with Native Americans, although\nsome people of African ancestry have risen to positions of wealth and power, Black Latin Americans are far more\nlikely to live in poverty than white or mestizo Latin Americans.\nIn Latin America, there is generally an inverse relationship between populations of Native American and people\nof African ancestry. That is, countries with large numbers indigenous people tend to have few Blacks, and vice\nversa. That\u2019s because Native Americans tend to be concentrated in mountainous areas, while people of African\ndescent tend to be concentrated in the low-lying tierra caliente.\nBrazil has, by far, Latin America\u2019s densest concentration of people of African ancestry. While only 8% of\nBrazilians identify as being wholly of African descent, 43% identify as mulatto \u2013 a mixture of European and African\nancestry. That means that just over half of the population claims at least partial African ancestry.\nOther Latin American countries where a significant minority claims full or partial African ancestry include\nPanama (16%), Venezuela (10%), Colombia (10%), and Nicaragua (9%).\nPeople of Asian ancestry represent a relatively small fraction of Latin America\u2019s population, and are primarily\nfound in Peru and Brazil, accounting for about 1% of each country\u2019s population. The largest Asian population in\nboth countries is Japanese \u2013 Brazil has, in fact, the largest Japanese population of any country outside of Japan.\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, Japan was industrializing, and with industrialization came the mechanization\nof agriculture, reducing the need for farm labor in Japan. Many of those Japanese farmers relocated to places like\nCalifornia and British Columbia, but large populations also migrated to Peru and Brazil. Many of them arrived with\na fair amount of money, and were able to acquire farms or start businesses. In a region where so many people\nwere either very rich or very poor, the Japanese were often solidly middle class. Over time, Japanese Peruvians and\nBrazilians became influential beyond their numbers in business and politics. One prominent example is Alberto K.\nFujimori, the grandson of Japanese immigrants, who served as president of Peru throughout most of the 1990s.\nCultural Geography: The Caribbean\nIf we take care in stating \u201cthe Caribbean\u201d as compared to \u201cthe Caribbean Islands,\u201d then we may broaden our\nscope locationally. Four countries on the Latin American mainland feature cultural elements that largely fit better\nwith Caribbean Islands than with mainland countries. Belize is a Central American country with strong cultural\nconnections to the Caribbean Islands. The Guianas, located in northern South America, have similar cultural ties\nto the Caribbean. They include Guyana (former British Guiana) and Suriname (former Dutch Guiana), which are\nindependent countries, and French Guiana, which is still a colony.\nReligion\nRoman Catholicism is the largest religious denomination in the Caribbean, and is the leading group in Puerto\nRico (85%), Cuba (59%) Haiti (55%), The Dominican Republic (48%), and Belize (40%). Catholics are also a significant\nminority in Suriname and Trinidad & Tobago. Various Protestant denominations, either Anglicanism brought by\nBritish colonizers, or American denominations brought by missionaries, are the largest group in Jamaica (66%),\nGuyana (35%), Suriname (24%), and Trinidad & Tobago (32%). Protestants are also a significant minority in Haiti,\nthe Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Belize.\nReligious syncretism is common in much of the Caribbean, where people practice Christianity, but also fuse it\nwith a folk religion, many of them based on spiritual beliefs from Africa. Vodou (sometimes spelled Voodoo) in\nHaiti is a prominent example.\nNon-religious populations are growing in the Caribbean. Today, 20% to 30% of the populations of Cuba, the\nDominican Republic, and Jamaica do not claim any religious affiliation.\nThe leading non-Christian religions in the Caribbean are Hinduism and Islam, the legacy of South Asian\nmigration to the region. They are not the majority in any country, but are a significant minority in a few. Hindus a LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 385\nlarge minority in Guyana (34%), Suriname (22%), and Trinidad & Tobago (18%). Muslims are a minority in Guyana\n(7%), and Trinidad & Tobago (5%).\nLanguage\nThere are some speakers of indigenous languages on the mainland portion of the Caribbean region \u2013 in the\nGuianas and Belize \u2013 but the leading language in every country is the colonial language. English is prominent in\nBelize, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Guyana. Spanish is spoken Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.\nFrench is spoken in Haiti and French Guiana, and Dutch is spoken in Suriname. All of these languages are scattered\nabout the Lesser Antilles.\nIn many places in the Caribbean, these European languages have experienced creolization, where words from\nother languages, mainly from West Africa, have made their way into the local dialect. One of the more interesting\nexamples is found in Belize. English is the official language of Belize, and is used in government, education, and the\nmedia. But an English speaker from the United States would have some trouble following a casual conversation\nin Belize, since many words from West African languages, Spanish, and Mayan have found their way into Belize\u2019s\nunique dialect of English.\nEthnicity\nThe vast majority of the people of the Caribbean trace their ancestry to one of two places \u2013 Africa or Europe.\nThey are largely descendants of European colonizers, African slaves, or both. Numerous people in the region are\nof mixed ancestry. Smaller, but still significant numbers of people are of Asian or Native American ancestry.\nPeople of African ancestry account for a large portion of the region\u2019s population. The vast majority of the\npopulation in Haiti (95%) and Jamaica (92%) are black. Nearly everyone else in Haiti and Jamaica identify as\nmulatto \u2013 being of mixed African and European ancestry. Mulattos form the majority of the Dominican Republic\u2019s\npopulation, at 70%, while 16% of the Dominican\u2019s population identifies as black. People claiming full or partial\nAfrican ancestry are significant minorities in Suriname (38%), Cuba (36%), Trinidad & Tobago (38%), Belize (30%),\nGuyana (30%) and Puerto Rico (15%).\nPeople of European ancestry are the other large group, and are primarily of Spanish descent. White people\naccount for the majority in Puerto Rico (76%) and Cuba (64%), and are a significant minority in the Dominican\nRepublic (14%).\nThe region\u2019s Asian populations primarily trace their ancestry to South Asia \u2013 modern-day India, Pakistan, and\nBangladesh. When the slave trade was abolished, many Caribbean plantation owners turned to indentured\nservitude \u2013 contract labor that was imported from South Asia. The indentured servants agreed to migrate to the\nCaribbean and work on plantations until the cost of their transportation, housing, and food was paid off. These\ncontracts were usually rigged, and most indentured servants did not live to see their contracts paid off. So, it\nwasn\u2019t slavery, but it wasn\u2019t much better. The descendants of these indentured servants are now a small minority\nin Belize (5%) and Jamaica (1%), and a very large minority in Suriname (41%), Guyana (40%), and Trinidad & Tobago\n(35%). Many people in the Guianas are of mixed Asian and African ancestry.\nAs mentioned above, the indigenous population of the islands were wiped out during colonization, so most of\nthe region\u2019s Native American population is found in Belize and the Guianas, where they account for 10% to 20% of\nthe population.\nMestizos form the largest group in one Caribbean country \u2013 Belize. Traditionally, most of Belize\u2019s population\nwas black, but over the last few decades a significant number of immigrants from neighboring Guatemala and\nHonduras have tilted the scales. Mestizos now account for 53% of Belize\u2019s population.\nPopulation Geography: Latin America\nPopulation Density\nLatin America (minus the Caribbean region) is home to 564 million people. The two most populous countries, 386 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nBrazil (212 million) and Mexico (118 million) account for 56% of the region\u2019s population. The next four largest\ncountries, Colombia (48 million), Argentina (41 million), Peru (31 million), and Venezuela (30 million) account for an\nadditional 27% of the region\u2019s population. The remaining countries account for 17% of the region\u2019s population.\nPopulation Growth\nth\nLatin America experienced explosive population growth during the 20 century. Here are the region\u2019s\npopulation numbers over that century:\n\u2022 1900: 59 million\n\u2022 1950: 164 million\n\u2022 1960: 214 million\n\u2022 1970: 278 million\n\u2022 1980: 354 million\n\u2022 1990: 431 million\n\u2022 2000: 510 million\nThis is the result of the demographic transition (see Chapter 8). For several centuries, Latin America was a rural,\npre-industrial society. Birth rates were extremely high, but so were death rates, so population growth was modest.\nThen, in the first few decades of the 20thcentury, modern agriculture and modern medicine were introduced, and\ndeath rates plummeted. The region remained mostly rural for a few more decades, keeping birth rates high. This\ncombination of high birth rates and low death rates caused the population to explode upward.\nSince the 1990s, Latin America has moved into the later stages of the demographic transition. The population is\nnow mostly urban, where people tend to have much smaller families. As a result, population growth and slowed\nsignificantly.\nIn Latin America, there is still a broad variation in TFRs (total fertility rates, or the average number of children\nper female). The global TFR is 2.8. Replacement rate, the TFR required to maintain zero population growth, is 2.1.\nHere are where various Latin American countries stand:\n\u2022 Four are above the global TFR of 2.8:\n\u25e6 Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay\n\u2022 Nine are at or above replacement rate (2.1), but below the world average:\n\u25e6 Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela\n\u2022 Four are below replacement rate:\n\u25e6 Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay\nThe strongest influences on TFR are gender equality, urbanization, and education. In countries where women\nhave more economic opportunity, they tend to have fewer children. Countries that are more urbanized tend to\nhave lower TFRs because, as we\u2019ve discussed before, urban life is less conducive to large families than rural areas.\nCountries with better-educated populations tend to have lower birth rates because people who are educated get\nmarried later and have fewer children then those with less education.\nThe statistics bear this out. Bolivia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay, which have Latin America\u2019s highest\nTFRs, are more rural, have less gender equality, and lower rates of education than the regional average. Brazil, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 387\nChile, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, which have Latin America\u2019s lowest TFRs, are more urban, have more gender\nequality, and higher rates of education than the regional average.\nEven though Latin America\u2019s population growth rates are no longer quite as troubling as they were twenty-\nfive years ago, the region is likely to continue to grow for the next few decades. Latin America is still a relatively\nyoung region, with 28% of its population under the age of 15. That means that, even though TFRs are falling, a\nlarge portion of the region\u2019s population will soon enter their reproductive years. Latin America\u2019s population is not\nexpected to stabilize until 2050, when it will be home to around 620 million people. This is a disturbing prospect\nfor a region where the majority of people already live in or near poverty. Over the next thirty years, Latin American\ncountries must find ways to provide an additional 60 million people with homes, health care, jobs, and food.\nModern LACAR is highly urbanized, matching North America as the most urban regions in the world at over 80%\nof the populations living in urban areas. LACAR has accomplished this in a hurry, moving to cities in a rapid pace,\nthereby catching up with North America. Often LACAR is considering to be in the developing world on a par with\nAsia and Africa. In fact, LACAR\u2019s urban percentage nearly doubles that of Africa and far outpaces that of Asia.\nPopulation Geography: The Caribbean\nThe total population of the Caribbean region is about 45 million, roughly the same as Argentina. About 85%\nof the population lives in the Greater Antilles. The largest countries are Cuba (11 million), Haiti (11 million), the\nDominican Republic (10 million), Puerto Rico (3 million), and Jamaica (3 million). All the remaining countries, except\nTrinidad & Tobago (1.2 million), have fewer than a million residents.\nLike the rest of Latin America, the Caribbean experienced rapid population growth during the 20thcentury. Also\nlike Latin America, birth rates in the region have been declining for the last few decades. All the major countries\nin the region have a TFR (total fertility rate, or average number of children per female) that is below the world\naverage. Only two, Haiti (2.5) and the Dominican Republic (2.2), have a TFR that\u2019s above the replacement rate of\n2.1. All the rest have TFRs at or below 2.1, including Jamaica (2.1), Cuba (1.7), Trinidad & Tobago (1.7), and Puerto\nRico (1.2). Variations in birth rates are largely tied to levels of urbanization, economic development, education, and\nthe status of women. Countries that are more urban, wealthier, better educated, and that have more educational\nand career opportunities for women tend to have lower birth rates.\nWith the exception of a few small islands in the Lesser Antilles, all the countries in the Caribbean region\nexperience a net migration loss \u2013 that is, more people are emigrating out of the countries than are immigrating\nto them. The primary destinations for these emigrants are the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Spain, and\nthe Netherlands. The United States is the favored destination, because of its large economy and close proximity.\nLanguage is an important pull factor as well. Haitians, for example, are more likely to emigrate to France or to the\nFrench-speaking Canadian province of Quebec.\nThe effects of emigration on the Caribbean have been similar to those in the rest of Latin America. The\nCaribbean suffers from a substantial \u201cbrain drain.\u201d For example, 80% of Haitians who have earned a college degree\nno longer live in Haiti. On the upside, emigrants send lots of money back home to their families. Those remittances\nnow account for a substantial portion of the economy in many Caribbean countries.\nPolitical Geography: Latin America\nBorder Wars\nIn the 1800s, as colonies became independent countries, there were a number of boundary disputes in Latin\nAmerica that led to full-blown conflicts. As we discussed earlier this semester, Texas fought a revolutionary war to\nseparate from Mexico, and acted as an independent country for about a decade. Mexico never recognized Texas\u2019s\nindependence. When Texas joined the United States in 1845, tensions escalated, and the Mexican-American War\nbroke out in 1846. Over the next two years, in a conflict that would kill more than 8,000 people, the United States\nwas able to maintain control of Texas. The U.S. also seized a vast section of northern Mexico, including nearly all\nof what would become the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and California. 388 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe War of the Triple Alliance (1864-1870) pit Paraguay against the alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.\nParaguay was on the losing side, and ceded significant territory to Argentina and Brazil. The war killed 400,000\npeople, including 42% of Paraguay\u2019s population, and 70% of its adult male population. The War of the Pacific\n(1879-1882) was a conflict between Chile and the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru. The war killed 20,000,\nand ended with Chile on the winning side. It expanded northward, seizing territory from Bolivia and Peru, leaving\nBolivia landlocked.\nRemarkably, the War of the Pacific was the last major international conflict in Latin America\u2019s history. There have\nbeen a few brief clashes, but the region largely avoided the bloody, sustained international conflicts that engulfed\nth\nmany other regions of the world. That said, Latin America\u2019s 20 century was hardly peaceful. There were plenty of\ncivil wars, rebellions, and counter-rebellions, many of them involving the United States. For an examination of the\nUnited States\u2019 relationship with Latin America, review Chapter 69.\nThe Emergence of Democracy\nSince the 1990s, democracy has flourished in a region where it was once extremely rare. Every country in\nthe region has had at least a few relatively fair elections in the last thirty years, but there is considerable\nvariation in the region in terms of the overall health of democracy. Costa Rica and Uruguay are considered full\ndemocracies, with free elections and little corruption. Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina,\nand Brazil are considered flawed democracies, with free elections, but serious corruption problems. Guatemala,\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Bolivia are considered partial democracies, with democratic institutions, but\nwith some repression of opposition parties and questionable elections. Only one country, Venezuela, is a nominal\ndemocracy\u2014a democracy \u201cin name only,\u201d that lacks legitimate rule of law and fair elections.\nVenezuela is a recent arrival to the \u201cnominal\u201d list. Democracy eroded for many years under the leadership of\nthe late President Hugo Chavez. His successor, President Nicolas Maduro, has effectively eliminated democracy\nduring his time in office. Many countries in the international community, including the United States, no longer\nrecognize Maduro as the legitimate president of the country.\nEconomic Geography: Latin America\nDevelopment\nLatin America is not the world\u2019s wealthiest region, nor is it the poorest. Overall, its standards of living are lower\nthan that of Europe and North America, but higher than sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.\nArgentina and Chile have the region\u2019s highest standards of living. Guatemala and Nicaragua have the lowest.\nRaw Materials and Historic Underdevelopment\nLatin America was colonized for the purpose of extracting raw materials, and remains the foundation of the\neconomy. Here are some examples of leading exports by country:\n\u2022 Argentina: soybeans, corn, wheat, petroleum\n\u2022 Brazil: iron ore, soybeans, coffee\n\u2022 Chile: copper, fish, fruits\n\u2022 Colombia: petroleum, coffee, coal\n\u2022 Costa Rica: coffee, bananas, sugar\n\u2022 Guatemala: coffee, sugar, bananas\n\u2022 Mexico: petroleum, silver\n\u2022 Nicaragua: coffee, shellfish, cotton LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 389\n\u2022 Panama: bananas, shellfish, sugar\n\u2022 Peru: fish, gold, copper, zinc\n\u2022 Venezuela: petroleum, bauxite\nOnly Mexico and Brazil receive less than half of their export revenues from raw materials, and raw materials\nare still very important to those two countries. In some countries, raw materials account for nearly 90% of export\nrevenue. Generally speaking, countries that are highly dependent upon the export of raw materials face significant\neconomic liabilities.\nFirst, raw materials don\u2019t command very high prices. Even valuable commodities like gold, silver, and petroleum\ndon\u2019t earn countries the same kind of revenues as manufactured goods. Even though Latin America is now more\nindustrialized than in decades past, it is still highly dependent upon places like East Asia, Europe, and North\nAmerica for most of its manufactured goods. In short, Latin America exports cheap things (raw materials), and\nimports expensive things (manufactured goods). This is known as \u201cpoor terms of trade,\u201d and it puts Latin America\nat a major economic disadvantage.\nAnother economic problem for Latin America is that profits from raw materials industries don\u2019t greatly benefit\nmost people. Many of the region\u2019s extractive industries, such as its mines and plantations, are owned either by\nwealthy individuals in Latin America or foreign investors, or sometimes a combination of both. So, the profits from\nthose industries typically enrich relatively few people. The foreign investors siphon profits out of the region, as\ndoes the wealthy class of Latin America, who often prefer to spend and invest their money in places like New York,\nLondon, Shanghai, or Tokyo. In short, profits from Latin America\u2019s raw materials do as much to fuel economic\ngrowth in other regions as they do in Latin America. Additionally, taxes on the industries are often very low, so the\ngovernments of the region don\u2019t receive much revenue to spend on things like infrastructure or education. Finally,\nand most significantly, wages for the workers in these industries are extraordinarily low.\nIn the markets where they are traded, raw materials are known as \u201ccommodities,\u201d and commodities markets\ntend to be very unstable. Prices for manufactured goods tend to be far more stable. Think of manufactured goods\nyou buy \u2013 a car, a phone, furniture, clothing, etc. You expect the prices of those goods to creep up slowly up or\ndown over time, but it is rare for them to undergo radical change. A car that costs $20,000 one week is not going\nto cost $50,000 the next. Then think about a commodity that many of us deal with often \u2013 gasoline. We are not at\nall surprised to find the price of gas rising or falling significantly over the course of a month, or even a week.\nSo, the economic fortunes of many Latin American are tied to an inherently volatile market. To make matters\nworse, many Latin American countries are extremely dependent on just one or two raw materials. Overreliance 390 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\non a narrow range of exports makes the Latin American countries economically vulnerable to changes in market\nconditions, competition from other sources, changing consumer appetites and, when it comes to agricultural\nexporters, the weather. Reliance on things like coffee and bananas has created a rollercoaster economy for many\ncountries, especially those in Central America that came to be known derisively as \u201cbanana republics.\u201d The volatility\nof such \u201cboom and bust\u201d economies discourages investment in new economic enterprises.\nThe Debt Crisis and Free Trade\nIn the 1960s, the economies of many Latin American countries were riding high, buoyed by a rising demand for\nthe region\u2019s raw materials. Many governments in the region began to borrow huge sums of money in hopes of\ndeveloping and diversifying their economies. Some good came out of this, as much of the money was invested in\nnew infrastructure, including new highways, power stations, water systems, schools, and hospitals, which in turn\ncreated new jobs. Unfortunately, much of the money was invested in inefficient, state-owned factories that could\nnot compete with producers from abroad. Some of it was misused on other ill-advised development schemes\nand showy, but unnecessary, public projects. A lot of the money, however, simply disappeared into the corrupt\nstructures of the Cold War-era military governments.\nIn the 1980s, the prices and demand for Latin America\u2019s raw materials collapsed. By the early 1990s, many\nof Latin America\u2019s governments could no long pay the interest on their loans, much less the principal. Most\nwere rescued by the International Monetary Fund, which arranged bailouts and loan restructuring programs. This\nrescue came with an agreement that the governments of Latin America would restructure how they did business.\nOne condition was an embrace of free trade. Latin American governments agreed to eliminate tariffs on most\nimports and exports, and this helped to usher in the era of the maquiladora.\nIndustrialization\nThere has been some manufacturing in Latin America for years. Venezuela, for example, has large deposits of\nbauxite \u2013 the ore used to produce aluminum \u2013 and large deposits of oil, which was used to power the aluminum\nsmelters. Brazil has large deposits or iron ore, and a handful of steel mills sprang up there decades ago. Still, large-\nscale manufacturing, such as that found in the United States, Japan, South Korea, Europe, and eventually China,\ngenerally failed to develop in Latin America for most of the 20thcentury.\nTo this day, most of the manufacturing in the region consists of household enterprises or small factories that\nemploy about a dozen workers, and that produce things \u2013 such as textiles, ceramics, and wood products \u2013 only\nfor the domestic market, not for export. Still, some significant industrialization has appeared in Latin America LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): OVERVIEW 391\nover the last three decades. As many Latin American countries signed free-trade deals with the United States, the\nEuropean Union, and other countries, the maquiladora was born.\nA maquiladora is a factory \u2013 often a large one \u2013 built with foreign investment money to assemble products\nfor foreign corporations. The maquiladora is designed to boost exports of manufactured goods by using tax\nbreaks, cheap labor, relaxed environmental rules, and other incentives to attract foreign producers. The factories\nproduce cars, clothing, electronics, and other goods, mainly from foreign components that are imported tax-\nfree. Large concentrations of maquiladoras can be found in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina (the region\u2019s three leading\nmanufacturers) and, to a lesser extent, in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.\nThe maquiladoras are important because they represent Latin America\u2019s step away from dependence on raw\nmaterial extraction. Still, they have not come without some problems. Taxes on maquiladoras are often extremely\nlow, so governments are often not able to provide adequate policing, education, and other public services in these\nbooming industrial towns. For example, Ciudad Juarez, in northern Mexico, saw huge spikes in sexual assaults and\nmurders as it industrialized. The maquiladoras there employ a disproportionately large number of women, but the\nlow tax base means that the police there are underfunded, and unable to provide adequate protection for those\nwomen. The maquiladoras also feature extremely low wages \u2013 the typical maquiladora worker in Mexico makes\nthe equivalent of about $8 per day. And the factories are often unregulated, featuring poor working conditions\nand high rates of pollution.\nThe Informal Economy\nIn the United States and other wealthy economies, most people speak of their jobs as if they were possessions\n\u2013 we \u201chave\u201d a job. We can expect a relatively stable number of work hours each week, and we count on a paycheck\narriving every week or two. Such permanent, regular employment is unavailable to many in Latin America. Despite\nits advances in manufacturing, the cities of Latin America have been unable to employ the wave of population that\nhas arrived from the countryside. Nearly half of the region\u2019s urban dwellers work in the informal economy \u2013 the\npart of the economy that takes place outside of the formal economic market.\nThe informal economy is a \u201cday to day\u201d economy, and is usually untracked and untaxed by the government.\nWorkers in the informal economy do not enjoy regular wages, benefits, or government regulatory protections. A\ncommon job in the informal economy is called \u201cday labor.\u201d Many poor neighborhoods in Latin American cities have\na well-known location where workers congregate early in the morning. A truck shows up, needing a few workers\nto dig a ditch, to poor concrete, to frame a building, or some other task. A few workers are selected, work for the\nday, and are paid with cash. They return to the same spot the next morning hoping for another day\u2019s work, which\nis by no means guaranteed.\nOthers in the informal economy provide crafts or services out of their home \u2013 they mend clothes, they cut hair,\nthey make food, they fix cars. Some people acquire goods to vend on the street. Some pick through garbage for\nfood and recyclables. It\u2019s a tough life. Unfortunately, one of the best ways to make a lot of money in the informal\neconomy is to participate in an illegal industry, such as drugs, weapons, or prostitution. Competition is in these\nindustries is fierce, and the mortality rate is very high.\nst\nThe 21 Century\u2019s Boom and Bust\nAs mentioned above, all Latin American countries are highly dependent upon raw materials for their export\nrevenue, and the volatility of the commodities market creates a rollercoaster economy. Latin America\u2019s cycles of\neconomic booms and busts have been as reliable as the tides.\nIn the 1990s, the economic news from Latin America was dire. Prices for raw materials had collapsed and\npoverty rates were climbing. Then, in the 2000s, the news changed completely. Most of the region experienced\nrapid economic growth, simulated by an increase in the demand for raw materials. Much of that growth was fueled\nby economic expansion in China. Prices for oil, natural gas, gold, silver, bauxite, and soybeans soared. At the end of\nthe 1990s, 39% of Latin America\u2019s population lived in poverty, and only 103 million people there could be defined 392 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nas \u201cmiddle class.\u201d At the end of the 2010s, the poverty rate had dropped to 28%, and 152 million people could be\ndefined as middle class.\nAnd then, in the mid-2010s, Latin America\u2019s economy fell apart. As you\u2019ve probably guessed, this decline\nresulted from the collapse in prices and demand for the region\u2019s raw materials. That, in turn, was largely due to\noverproduction and declining demand in an economically weakening China. Poverty, unemployment, and inflation\nrates rose sharply in Latin America.\nNo country has suffered more than Venezuela. The collapse in the price of oil, coupled with government\ncorruption and disastrous economic planning, have created the worst economic crisis in the nation\u2019s history. Since\n2016, the annual inflation rate has been 720%, an apocalyptic number. There are massive food shortages, and\nabout 87% of the country\u2019s population is undernourished. The health care system, once the envy of South America,\nhas all but collapsed. The coronavirus is certain to make an already hellish situation even worse.\nEven Brazil, which in the 2000s was one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies, has suffered. 2015 saw the\ncountry\u2019s worst economic performance in two decades. Brazil\u2019s economy contracted by 4% in 2015, and by another\n2% in 2016, the first consecutive years of economic contraction since the Great Depression. Brazil\u2019s economy has\ngrown each year since 2017, but rarely by more than 1%\nOf course, in the 2020s, the tide may shift once again into a boom phase. And if it does, it will almost certainly\nbe because the prices and demand for Latin America\u2019s raw materials are rising again.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThere are four thousand varieties of potatoes in Peru.\nChile is one of the world\u2019s top producers of wine.\nGuinea pigs are eaten in Peru and parts of Ecuador and Colombia.

A \u201cregion\u201d is defined to be an area\nwith multiple shared elements over a range of categories, including both physical and human geographic\ncharacteristics. The secret of creating a region, which is a human construct not a naturally begotten unit, is to\ncluster together as many similarities as possible, while excluding geographic differences.\nIn some cases, the determination of a geographic region is simple. South America obviously is an intact\ncontinent, but also possesses many shared features in a variety of geographic categories. In contrast, the region\nof North Africa and the Middle East (or Southwest Asia and North Africa) is very problematic to create, define, and\nlimit.\nSeen in the map above, Russia presents its own set of challenges to the regional geographer. Its sheer\nimmensity as a land area causes Russia to straddle two continents \u2013 Europe and Asia. Some people contend\nthat Russia should be a part of Europe. Indeed, Russia to the west of the Ural Mountains is termed \u201cEuropean\nRussia.\u201d In this part of the country, Russians have tended to look to Europe for inspiration and for a common\noutlook. In some cases, Russian leadership, particularly Tsar Peter the Great, intensified this focus, even bringing\nskilled Europeans to Russia to promote European ideals and culture. Additionally, a dominant majority of Russia\u2019s\npopulation lives west of the Urals. Though the daily life and setting of Soviet cities Moscow and Leningrad little\n393 394 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nresembled that of European cities outside the Eastern bloc, contemporary Moscow and the now renamed St.\nPetersburg dramatically do feature much of that found in cities throughout Europe.\nUnfortunately, this European categorization fails to account for\nthe substantial majority of Russia\u2019s land that is east of the Urals and\nstretches to the Pacific Ocean. Visibly nonsensical to include Pacific\ncoastal areas in Europe, this approach also does not account for a\nvariety of Asiatic peoples in Siberia, including the descendants of\nthe historically significant Mongols who once controlled huge\nsections of what is now Russia.\nThe option to construct Russia as an Asian region is a poorer\nchoice. While the landmass of Russia mostly is positioned north of\nareas recognized as Asia, its Asiatic peoples are a distinct minority\npopulation. The dominant majority population of Russians clearly\nis neither racially nor culturally Asian. With this Asian option, it can\nbe noted that over 75% of Russia\u2019s area is considered to be in Asia.\nMarker noting the border between Asia and Europe,\nA third option is to split the country in two pieces regionally;\nas looking southward. Photo by Jerka.h23.\nhowever, this choice presents an onerous position to geographers.\nThe modern political world is fully patterned in the State model,\nwith specifically delineated international borders. Taking one State and then dividing it into two pieces for\nseparate placement into regional schemes is like compelling a married couple to take jobs living separately in cities\nfar distant from each other. There may seem to be some usefulness at the start, but as a lasting choice, it is\nintrinsically flawed. But, if you want to go with this choice of splitting up Russia, then the common tactic is to\ndivide Russia at the Ural Mountains.\nYet another option is the establishment of Russia as a region itself. For some this may seem intuitively wrong.\nHow can a single country be a region? Although Russia would be the only such region in the world, other regions\ndo come close to this pattern. Australia dominates the region called Oceania, though New Zealand and a host of\nsmall Pacific islands also fit in the region. North America, as separate from Latin America (which includes Mexico),\nis a region of just two countries \u2013 the United States and Canada. Additionally, Russia\u2019s colossal area is larger than\nmany of the world\u2019s established regions. In fact, Siberia itself is more than twice as large as Europe (not counting\nany of Russia as belonging to Europe). While Russia is a multinational State with dozens of ethnic minorities, one\nnation, Russians, has dominated these minorities for a long period of history; thereby embedding Russian culture\nas the dominant social element throughout the country. With Russia as the dominant successor State to the USSR\nin area, population, and clout, there is further logic in defining Russia as a region.\nIn a 2019 survey done by the Levada Center, Russians were asked, \u201cTo what extent do you presently\nidentify yourself with Western culture?\u201d The data for this study was collected in\nMay and June 2019 from 1,600 respondents aged 14\u201329. Only twenty percent of\nthe respondents answered in a positive way, choosing either \u201cI always remember\nit\u201d or \u201cIt is quite important to me.\u201d The survey also inquired, \u201cDo you fully agree,\nrather agree, rather disagree, or strongly disagree with the statement \u2018Russia is\na European country\u2019?\u201d Only 36% agreed. Note that young people are the ones\nwho are least connected to Soviet days, being born after or as the Soviet Union\ndissolved. These young Russians are the people who should be the most likely\nto connect Russia to the relative prosperity and freedom of Europe. Their limited\nconnection to Europe suggests that the choice of selecting Russia as its own\nregion still remains better than placing part of Russia in Europe. RUSSIAN DOMAIN 395\nOr, Russia could be the core of a slightly larger\nregion that could include ethnic partners Ukraine and\nBelarus and\/or historical linked partners Georgia and\nArmenia. Given the dominant Slavic ethnic\ncomposition of Ukraine and Belarus, this is an easy fit\nwith Russia. Though Georgians and Armenians fit in\ndistinctly separate ethnic groups not connected to\nRussians, both groups have modern historical\nconnections with Russia. Neither Christian country\ncould fit with southern neighbors in the Islamic Middle\nEast, yet both are separated from Europe by long\nstretches of land in Russia and Ukraine, as well as by\nthe Black Sea. Given these difficulties, the placement\nRussia map by Larry Koester on Flickr. of Georgia and Armenia with Russia is not\nunreasonable. Similarly, sometimes Moldova is added\nto this region, though others will note Moldova\u2019s links with Romania in order to place Moldova in Europe. This\nbroader region could be called the Russian Domain.\nIn evaluating these choices, the evidence is weighted to favor\neither of the last two choices \u2013 Russia as its own region or Russia as\nthe main section of the Russian Domain.\nExercises\nDuring the Soviet period the question of region was more easily answered. Due\nRussian Domain.\nto its communist format, the USSR often was defined as a single region.

CHAPTER 81\nRussian Domain: Regional Example\nSiberia\nCold, vast, and unpopulated except for convicts and reindeer\nherders. This popular conception of Siberia has elements of truth\nto it, but begs for a more complete understanding. Siberia is the\nenormous Russian landmass east of the Ural Mountains. Larger\nthan any country in the world (except obviously Russia), Siberia\ncovers five million square miles.\nIn popular terminology and from its earliest noted history,\nSiberia refers to all of the land east of the Urals, stretching to the\nPacific Ocean. (In this essay the use of the term \u201cSiberia\u201d will be in\nthis broadest sense, unless otherwise noted.) In Russia, however,\nthis territory often is sub-divided for practicality. During the Soviet\nNorthern Siberia from Above \u2014 Photo by Klaus period, Siberia was divided into West Siberia, East Siberia, and the\nStiefel Far East. Currently, under the Russian Federation\u2019s format of\nfederal districts, Siberia consists of the Urals federal district, the\nSiberian federal district, and Far Eastern federal district. Yet\nanother geographic delineation of Siberia marks the eastern boundary as the watershed between Pacific and\nArctic drainage, thus leaving Siberia to fall short of the Pacific Ocean. In its broadest sense Siberia represents over\n\u00be of Russia\u2019s area.\nFor all its vast territory Siberia remains sparsely populated. A major cause of this low population density is the\nchallenging climate, that of northern cold. Overall, Siberia holds about eight people per square mile, though many\nof the farther northern lands average only one or two people per square mile. Southern lands linked by the Trans-\nSiberian Railway have the highest population density. Population trends for areas not privy either to rail or river\ntransportation are subject to a negative feedback loop. Due to the lack of transportation, these locations do not\nincrease in population; however, due to the lack of population, they do not become connected to the network of\ntransportation. Although Siberia is this vast natural landmass, over 2\/3 of the population of Siberia lives in urban\nsettings.\nSiberia has long been Russian territory, though the precise origin of its name has been muddled or lost over the\ncenturies. While many accept the Turkic word for \u201csleeping land\u201d as the historical and logically appropriate origin\nfor the toponym, others maintain that the region is named for one or another tribe native to the region.\nThe earliest settlement of Siberia came from small ethnic groups that progressively found themselves displaced\nby more numerous and\/or more powerful nations. By migrating to the Siberian frontier, clearly a less desirable\n397 398 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nlocation with much lower agricultural production, these ethnic groups escaped confrontation. Although these\nnationalities are multiple, their populations are small. The majority population in virtually every sub-region is\nRussian (or Russian + Ukrainian). This minority status for natives is the result of Russian exploration, exile,\nand migration. Russian traders and Cossacks entered Siberia in the 16th century, eventually prompting the\nconstruction of Russian forts progressively eastward, with Russian settlers reaching the Pacific Ocean by the end\nof the 17th century. Siberia\u2019s isolation made it an attractive setting for Russian and later for Soviet authorities to\nexile political opposition or to imprison criminals. And then, the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railroad in 1916\nlinked laborers and raw materials with European Russia.\nThe dominant landscape of Siberia is taiga, the\npredominantly coniferous forest. Northern locations feature\ntundra, while much of the region contains permafrost soils. The\nWest Siberian Lowland is the world\u2019s largest section of\ncontinuous lowland, whereas mixed elevations and occasional\nmountain ranges are found in the rest of Siberia.\nThe key importance of Siberia is its vast diversity and rich\nquantities of minerals and energy resources. Oil and natural\ngas reserves are immense in West Siberia, particularly in the\nTyumen region. Considerable development of these energy\ndeposits was accomplished during the Soviet era, including an\narea of pipelines directed to Russian cities as well as far beyond\nRussia into Western Europe.\nLower Shavla Lake, Siberia \u2014 Photo by Gael Varoquaux\nExtraction of\nraw materials \u2013\nnickel, gold,\ncoal, diamonds,\ntimber, water\npower, and\nmuch more \u2013\nwas begun in\nthe tsarist\nyears, but was\ngreatly\nSiberian birch at Prokopyevsk, Russia.

Even fisheries off the eastern edges of Siberia in the Sea of Okhotsk produce\nlarge returns. While the great storehouses of resources remain in Siberia, the demise of the Soviet subsidies and\nthe elimination of prison and directed laborers have diminished the rates of resource utilization. Issues of labor\nand of pollution, but most prominently of profit, have closed mines and factories in various Siberian locations.\nOverall, Siberia is abundant in land area, natural resources, permafrost, and cold; in contrast, it is short on\npeople and roads.

CHAPTER 82\nRussian Domain:\nCultural Geography I\nCyrillic Alphabet\nLanguage is a vital part of culture and thus of cultural geography. As geographers study the world, knowledge\nof foreign languages can be helpful.\nFor native English speakers, learning other languages that feature Latin-based alphabets is not necessarily easy,\nbut at least does include familiarity with the script. Some Latin-based languages do have letters that are not in the\nEnglish language alphabet. For instance, Norwegian and Danish language includes the letters \u00e6, \u00f8, and \u00e5.\nTypically, English speakers find certain foreign languages more challenging when they do not feature a Latin-\nbased alphabet. Definitely, character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese may be difficult for\nAmericans to learn. Arabic offers letters such as \u064a. Here let us consider the Cyrillic alphabet, common in Slavic\nlanguages, though not in all.\nThe Cyrillic alphabet is named for St. Cyril. Along with his brother Methodius, Cyril was a Christian missionary\nth\nwho worked among Slavic peoples. Significantly, in the 9 century the brothers created the Glagolitic script to help\nwith translation of religious books. Their disciples helped establish this alphabet in the Bulgarian empire, where\nit was edited to become the Cyrillic alphabet and adopted by the ruler Simeon I in 893.\nThe alphabet was incorporated into the related Russian language and evolved somewhat over the centuries.\nSome letters were dropped completely from the list. Others, like the so-called hard sign \u044a, found less common\nuse. Tsar Peter the Great actively sought to bring European elements into Russian society and prompted reform of\nthe Cyrillic alphabet, including some drift toward a more Latin appearance for some letters. Variation in the script\nbetween different Slavic languages developed.\nRussia\u2019s form of the Cyrillic alphabet features 33 letters. Note that there are slight variations of the Cyrillic\nalphabet, for instance in Ukrainian. For a visual explanation, watch this short video \u2013 https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/\n400 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY I 401\nwatch?v=mJz8RrKEHlw. In any case, some Cyrillic letters match their Latin counterparts in form and\npronunciation. For instance, the letter k is the same in English as in Russian, as is true for the vowel a.\nOther Cyrillic Russian letters appear to match Latin letters, but are pronounced differently. For example, the\nCyrillic letter c is pronounced like the Latin letter s. The Cyrillic letter p is pronounced as a rolled r.\nStill other Cyrillic Russian letters do not have Latin partners at all. These letters create interesting versions for\ntransliteration, the process of spelling a foreign word to match its pronunciation but not to reflect its meaning. So,\nthe Cyrillic letter \u0449 is transliterated as the letters shch, while the letter \u0436 is spelled zh. In American marketing,\nsometimes the letter \u044f is used to be a trendy letter r, such as in the company name Toys \u044f Us. However, in Russian\nthis letter \u044f is pronounced and transliterated as ya (or sometimes as ia ). One consequence of these Cyrillic letters\nmatching multiple Latin letters is that some Russian words appear much shorter in Russian than when spelled\nin English. Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev\u2019s last name is Xpy\u0449\u0451\u0432 in Russian. Chechnya, a troublesome\nrepublic of Russia, is spelled \u0447e\u0447\u043d\u044f in Russian.\nSome Cyrillic letters show influence from other lands certainly including Greece, like the letter \u0444 which is the\nsame as the Greek letter, sounded in English as ph or f.\nAn oddity in the Cyrillic is the so-called soft sign \u044c. This letter sort of isn\u2019t a letter, for it has no sound. Instead the\nsoft sign \u044c softens the pronunciation of the letter that comes before it. A common example is the letter \u0442 which\nis pronounced as a soft \u0442 when combined as \u0442\u044c. Typically, these combinations occur at the end of syllables or at\nthe end of words. The Russian administrative region \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c is an example of this soft \u0442 at the end of a word.\nSimilarly, the Russian word tsar is spelled \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c. The word tsar offers a lesson in transliteration, as the correct\nchoice for the letter \u0446 is ts, while a trendy but poorer American approach is cz, creating the word czar.\nDuring the years of the Soviet Union, government policy toward language and more broadly toward culture\nwas Russification. Given that the Russian Republic (the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic or RSFSR\n(PC\u0444CP)) was overwhelmingly the largest portion of the land mass and that Russians were the majority of the\ncountry\u2019s population, the government actively promoted Russian language and culture as the normative approach\nthroughout the country. Russian language was taught everywhere. Given the distinctive alphabets in Armenia\nand in Georgia, these republics were allowed to use their own languages, though Russian was taught there\ntoo. Although the Turkic languages of Central Asia used Arabic-based or Latin-based alphabets, these were\nconverted into Cyrillic scripts. The breakup of the Soviet Union brought an end to Russification and prompted\ngradual linguistic reforms away from Cyrillic. For instance, in Uzbekistan in 2021, the Uzbek national language will\ncomplete a reform to a fully Latin alphabet. The same will be true for the Kazakh language in 2025. Languages\nof the native republics of contemporary Russia often still use the Cyrillic script adopted during Soviet days. This is\ntrue for Tatar, Mari, Bashkir, and many other languages in Russia.\nAs key Russian cities become more Western, an odd trend is the\ntransliteration of English words or brand names into Cyrillic script\non store signs and billboards. Citibank to the left.\nOverall, the Cyrillic alphabet is the natural script for Russian,\nUkrainian, Bulgarian, Belarussian, Macedonian, and Serbian\nlanguages.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nCitibank.

Even by simple probability, it is likely that Russia\nwould hold a variety of natural resources, some in high quantities. Indeed, that is true, as Russia has a vast supply\nof natural resources, especially in the expansive areas of Siberia.\nEnergy resources are included in very large reserves in Russia, both oil and natural gas. Given that reserves by\ndefinition are not yet extracted, they are estimates, though generally well calculated. By most estimates, Russia\nis the world\u2019s leader in natural gas reserves with proven reserves of 1668 trillion cubic feet (47 trillion cubic\nmeters). This is about \u00bc of the world\u2019s reserves and is approximately 3.5 times that of the United States (#4 in the\nworld (Iran #2, Qatar #3)).\nAn excellent map of Russia\u2019s top ten oilfields and top ten natural gas fields can be seen at:\nhttp:\/\/shop.theoilandgasyear.com\/major-producing-fields-in-russia-2013\/. The Urengoy (or Urengoi) gas field in\nwestern Siberia has been Russia\u2019s key gas field for many years, after being discovered in 1966 with production\nbeing initiated in 1978. Urengoy is the second largest gas field and the most productive in the world. There are\nnatural gas fields in numerous locations in Russia, but clearly Siberia holds the greatest reserves.\nThe challenge for the economic exploitation of this energy resource was significant, given its location in a frigid\nclimate. Even though western Siberia is the nearest portion of Siberia to the populated portions of Russia and to\nindustry there and in the Ural Mountains, transportation of the gas to those locations still required construction\nand installation of extensive pipelines across difficult landscapes. As climate change affects Russia, construction\n403 404 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nand maintenance of infrastructure in Siberia becomes more and more tricky. Much of Siberia, especially so the\nnorthern locations, features permafrost soils. Every summer the active layer, the top meter or more, melts.\nThis causes anything built on these surfaces \u2013 houses, pipelines, railroad lines \u2013 to risk instability by shifting or\nmoving. Engineers compensate for this risk in different ways; for instance, by pinning supports deeper through\nthe permafrost into the unchanged strata below the active layer. However, as global warming heats Siberia, the\nactive layer is extended deeper. Structures that once were secure may now become movable. Construction of new\ninfrastructure must account for these greater risks. Pipelines and the structural supports holding the pipelines\nare at risk of shifting or breaking. New pipelines and maintenance of old pipelines necessarily must adjust.\nThe Soviet Union\u2019s interest in developing its natural gas potential\nbegan during World War II, when wartime disruption of coal\nsupplies, its main source of heat and energy, caused hardships.\nDiscovery of vast natural gas fields in western Siberia in the 1960s\ndemonstrated the potential for this choice of energy. Utilizing these\nfields demanded considerable investment and labor, but proved to\nbe worthwhile for domestic use. Subsequently as the Soviet Union\nand then Russia sought to deliver the gas even farther, that is, to\nEastern Europe and beyond into countries like Germany, these\npipelines stretched greater and greater distances. The\ninternational sales of Russian natural gas proved to be more than\nsimple economic transactions, but became geopolitical topics of\nRussia\u2019s Energy Pipelines.\nconcern as well.\nCartography by Joseph Adduci.\nThe breakup of the Soviet Union fractured the country into\nfifteen new countries. The former republics, particularly to the\nwest of Russia, had been domestic consumers of Soviet natural gas from Siberia. As these new countries, they\nremained customers of Russian gas from Siberia, but now with geopolitical aspects to this energy trade. For\ninstance, Ukraine became a new country with mixed feelings toward the new Russia. Ukrainians shared linguistic,\nethnic, and historical connections with Russia, yet also often sought to break the post-Soviet links by looking\nwestward to Europe for trade and politics. The new Russia strongly opposed these pro-Western aspects of new\nUkrainian ideas. One lever used by Russia to influence Ukrainian geopolitical leanings was the natural gas\ndependency. For instance, in January 2009, for thirteen cold winter days in Ukraine, Russia suspended the flow of\ngas to pipelines into Ukraine, while renegotiating the economic terms of their energy trade. Although the terms\nmay have been economic, the framework of the crisis was the political reminder that Russia controls Ukraine\u2019s\nwinter heating and can turn that off when it feels the geopolitical need.\nSimilarly, as of 2013, former Soviet republics and now independent Baltic countries \u2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania\n\u2013 were 100% dependent on Russia for natural gas. While Russia certainly utilizes natural gas in its industrial and\nresidential sectors, it also exports a considerable share to several European countries, as seen in overall totals in\nthe chart below. image RUSSIAN DOMAIN: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 405\nThese too have geopolitical implications. In 2013, Germany bought 46% of its natural gas supply from Russia.\nThe United States currently is applying political pressure on Germany to reduce its purchases of natural gas from\nRussia, arguing that this economic link benefits Russia at a time that Europe and America should seek to weaken\nRussia.\nGeopolitical factors now are affecting two major Russian pipeline expansions. Nord Stream 2 is a proposed\ndoubling of an existing undersea pipeline that would bring natural gas from near St. Petersburg, under the Baltic\nSea, to northern Germany. Although American economic sanctions against Russia and against companies doing\ncertain types of business with Russia have hindered the project, it appears that Russia will complete the work by\nwinter 2021.\nTo the south, Russia has faced obstacles as well. The political backlash from its annexation of Crimea from\nUkraine in 2014 effectively scuttled Russia\u2019s proposed South Stream. Those plans were replaced by the successful\nTurk Stream that runs under the Black Sea from Russia to Kiyikoy, Turkey, initiating gas flows to Bulgaria at the\nstart of 2020.\nGazprom is the world\u2019s largest natural gas corporation. A majority of its stock is owned by the Russian\ngovernment. Its corporate website is https:\/\/www.gazprom.com. 406 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nNatural gas can used and transported for a variety of uses and products. Here is a small section of pipeline\ntransporting ammonia from Tolyatti, Russia, to Odessa, Ukraine.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe novel \u201cRed Snow\u201d by Edward Topol is a fictional crime novel that accurately described the challenges of Soviet extraction of natural gas\nin the Urengoy gas field. Along with the economic gains, there was extensive exploitation of the native Nenets people as well as degradation\nof the Siberian landscape. The original English translation in hardback featured a clear plastic protective book shield that enclosed a number\nof small white imitation snowflakes.\nAn American strategy to lessen European dependence on Russian natural gas is to sell American natural gas to Europe. However, it is\nimpossible to build a gas pipeline from the United States to Europe. Instead, these sales would be of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Of course,\nsale of LNG is far from simple, requiring liquefaction in American ports, transportation across the Atlantic Ocean, and gasification in European\nport facilities.\nRussia also has oil pipelines coming out of Siberia and other Russian oilfields. The Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline is the world\u2019s longest\npipeline.\nAn additional map of Russian gas pipelines can be seen at: https:\/\/shop.theoilandgasyear.com\/russia-map\/ RUSSIAN DOMAIN: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY I 407\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nAdduci, Joseph. 2020. \u201cRussia\u2019s Energy Pipelines.\u201d\nBourne, Jr., Joel K. 2019. \u201cSee Russia\u2019s Massive New Gas Plant on the Arctic Coast.\u201d Environment.

CHAPTER 84\nRussian Domain:\nHistorical Geography I\nThe Empire Expands and Contracts\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here: https:\/\/cod.pressbooks.pub\/\nwesternworlddailyreadingsgeography\/?p=244\n408 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY I 409\nLet\u2019s begin with this visual look at Russia\u2019s lands, an animated progression of expansion and contraction. The\nanimation above effectively looks at this expansion. Let\u2019s consider how this historical and geographic expansion\ntook place. At present, Russia is by far the largest country in the world, as measured by area. This has been true\nfor more than a century. The Soviet Union was even larger, by two million square miles; however, the breakup left\nRussia as the main surviving piece and indeed as the largest country in the world. How did this all happen?\nBy 800 BCE, there was no country Russia, but there were scattered clusters of Slavic peoples in the region north\nof the Black Sea and east of the Baltic Sea. However, there were numerous other peoples in the region and\npassing in and out of the region. Over the several following centuries, different peoples entered the area, even\nas Slavs became somewhat more organized. Asiatic tribes crossed the Ural Mountains from the east. Goths and\nHuns expanded their territories in the early CE years. Subsequently, Avars, Khazars, and Bulgars each took turns\nof prominence in the region, even with a Slavic recovery in the 600s CE.\nThe first significant organized Slavic territory was prompted by Viking (in Russia, cited as Varangian) trading\ninterest in the region. Viking raiders and traders sought to use the southern-flowing Dnieper and Volga Rivers\nin order to greatly expand their trading networks to the corresponding Black and Caspian Seas. As these Norse\ndeveloped these trading routes, some of them settled in the areas along the routes. In 880, the capital became\nKiev (now Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine), thus starting the rule of Oleg over what then gained the name Kievan Rus.\nAs this essay is interested simply in the expansion and contraction of Russian lands, we begin with Kievan\nRus, but do not cover all the historical details. Indeed, after the beginning of Kievan Rus, there was period\nof prominence for the city of Novgorod and its surrounding territory, as well as the ascendance of Moscow.\nHowever, all of these territorial holdings remained west of the Ural Mountains and were historically constrained\nby German expansion, Lithuanian conquest, and the famous Mongol invasion. From 1359 to 1425, Moscow was\nable to increase its holdings between other competing powers. By 1533 Moscow\u2019s lands extended to the Arctic\nOcean.\nThe significant eastward expansion of Russia arrived with the reign of Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) in 1547. In 1552\nIvan\u2019s troops ousted the Mongols from Kazan, then in 1556 from Astrakhan. The elimination of these Khanate\u2019s\nholds on Russia allowed Ivan IV to push across the Ural Mountains. Cossack forces under their leader Yermak\nbrought western Siberian lands under Moscow\u2019s control. The breadth of Russia\u2019s western holdings would vary\nover time, though in net terms gaining; however, the eastward expansion was an inexorable push to the Pacific\nOcean and a slide into Central Asia.\nThe conquest of Siberia demanded little in terms of battle against native peoples, but a great deal in the\nmovement of settlers across vast distances and through miles and miles of cold and forest. Russians, Cossacks,\nand Ukrainians established these and other towns as they moved eastward:\n\u2022 Irkutsk 1652 (on the western shore of Lake Baikal)\n\u2022 Okhotsk 1649 (on the Pacific\u2019s Sea of Okhotsk)\n\u2022 Anadyr 1649 (near the Bering Strait)\n\u2022 Yakutsk 1632 (among the coldest places on the planet)\nUnder a series of female leaders \u2013 Anne (1730-1740), Elizabeth (1741-1761), and Catherine the Great (1762-1796),\nRussia sought to expand its lands west of the Urals Mountains, pushing against the Ottoman Empire to the\nsouth, moving westward toward Poland, and edging northeastward looking to Sweden. Eventually, Russia secured\nterritory in each direction, for instance, taking Finland from Sweden in 1809.\nRussia pushed southward into the Caucausus Mountains, between the Black and Caspian Seas. Russia\u2019s current\nborders there are similar to the Russian Empire\u2019s reach in 1763, but the empire continued a back and forth with\nwestern borders. Advances through Georgia and Azeribaijan brought the empire again to abut Persia in 1813,\nwhile movement into Armenia again reached the borders of the Ottoman Empire in 1828 and more so in 1878. 410 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSimilarly, the Russian Empire expanded throughout Central Asia from 1763 to 1914. Conquest of the region\nknown then as Bokhara, as centered by the now city Bukhara brought the Russian Empire perilously close to the\nBritish Empire in India. The two empires agreed to the establishment of the Wakhan Corridor, a narrow strip of\nland designed as part of Afghanistan, to keep the two powers separate.\nUpon the dawn of World War I, the Russian Empire had reached its farthest extent, slightly larger than its heir,\nthe Soviet Union. Holdings in Finland and Poland were lost in the war, never to be recovered. Russia\u2019s convincing\ndefeat in the war, followed by its civil war to determine political but not royal successors to the monarchy,\nled to noteworthy losses of territory. In addition to the losses of Finland and Polish territory, Russia dropped\ncontrol of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \u2013 the Baltic States that gained their independence. Ukraine and the\nCaucasus region\u2019s Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan also secured independence; however, they were subdued and\nincorporated into the new Soviet Union. Bessarabia, a portion of modern-day Moldova, was annexed by ethnically\nsimilar Romania.\nIn World War II, the Soviet Union\u2019s victory in Eastern Europe allowed them to reclaim the Baltic States, part of\nPoland, Bessarabia, and a corner of Finland. This brought the USSR to its fullest state, nearly matching the land\nholding of the fullest version of the Russian Empire.\nOf course, the collapse of the Soviet Union cracked this vast land into fifteen pieces, fifteen new countries. While\nRussia remains the world\u2019s largest country by area (6.6 million square miles), the other fourteen new countries\nchopped off two million square miles for their own territories. By seeking its own post-Soviet independence, tiny\nChechnya sought to create a precedent for the many ethnic regions of Russia. The Russian military twice slammed\nChechnya in civil wars, forcing the upstart land to remain in Russia.\nIt appeared that Russia would maintain its size without territorial gains or losses; however, Russia\u2019s annexation\nof Crimea in 2014 changed that view. Russia\u2019s fight in eastern Ukraine and its apparent interest in lands in Estonia\nand Georgia indicate that Russia\u2019s land size may change again.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nRussia\u2019s Siberian expansion reached the Bering Strait, but Russians moved across the water to claim Alaska. The United States bought Alaska\nfrom Russia in 1867. Many Americans considered this purchase to be foolhardy, characterizing it as \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly,\u201d referencing the American\nSecretary of State who led the negotiations.\nFor a short time, Russia had a fort in Hawaii, as built in 1817.\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway reached Irkutsk in 1899. By 1917 track stretched from Moscow to Vladivostok (on the Pacific Ocean) without\nneeding passage through China.

Of course.\nIn America, the mighty Mississippi flows southward from Minnesota to Louisiana and into the Gulf of Mexico.\nSomehow this last fact subconsciously has prompted many Americans to feel intuitively that rivers progress\nsouthward. That intuition is incorrect.\nIn Siberia, most rivers flow downward. Of course. However, in Siberia downward generally is to the north.\nThree of the four giant rivers of Siberia drain northwards.\n412 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 413\nStarting in western Siberia and the Ural Federal District of Russia,\nthere is the Ob\u2019 River. (Note the spelling of the word Ob\u2019 is a\nfeature of the Cyrillic alphabet.) In the Altay Mountains, the smaller\nstreams of the Biya and Katun Rivers begin, later to merge to\nbecome the Ob\u2019 River. The significant Irtysh River forms in China\nalso in the Altay Mountains and then roughly parallels the Ob\u2019,\nusually over 100 miles to the west. When the two rivers join, near\nthe city Khanty-Mansiysk, the surviving name is Ob\u2019. This is a bit\ncurious, given that up to that juncture, the Irtysh River is longer\nthan the Ob\u2019 River. The length of the Ob\u2019 is 2270 miles, but the\ncombined Irtysh-Ob\u2019 River system is measured as the world\u2019s\nseventh longest. Eventually, the stream widens into Gulf of Ob\u2019\nwhen it reaches the Kara Sea, a portion of the Arctic Ocean. The\nGulf of Ob\u2019 is the world\u2019s largest estuary.\nIn the Eastern\nFederal District of\nRussia, there is the\nnext huge river of\nSiberia \u2013 the\nYenisei. The\ncombined Yenisei-\nOb\u2019 River. Cartography by Steve Wiertz.\nAngara system is\nconsidered the\nworld\u2019s fifth longest. The source of the Yenisei is in the mountains\nof northern Mongolia, its major tributary, the Angara River, flows\nfrom Lake Baikal.\nBoth the Ob\u2019 and the Yenisei have major hydroelectric dams built\nacross their southern tracts, respectively in Novosibirsk and\nKrasnoyarsk. The Novosibirsk Reservoir is Siberia\u2019s largest artificial\nlake.\nIn the Far East Federal District of Russia, the Lena River begins in\nthe mountains along the western side of Lake Baikal. The Lena\nRiver (L\u00e9 na) is the giant stream of Siberia, stretching 2734 miles.\nHuge on global standards as well, the Lena is the world\u2019s\n11thlongest river and draws from the world\u2019s 7thlargest watershed,\nYenesei River. Cartography by Steve Wiertz.\nincluding from its biggest tributary, the Vilyuy River. Mammoth in a\nvariety of dimensions, the Lena reaches a width of twenty miles\nacross and at the Laptev Sea creates a delta over 250 miles wide. The Lena River and its tributaries are entirely\nwithin the borders of Russia, unlike the Ob\u2019 and Yenisei. 414 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nSiberia in general and the region of the Lena River as well is a\ntreasure trove of natural resources and a setting of scarce\npopulation distribution. The primary city along the Lena River is\nYakutsk with approximately 200,000 people.\nDuring tsarist times in Russia, after Cossack adventurers reached\nthe Lena River in 1623, for many years political and criminal exiles\nwere sent to this region (as well as to many other locations in\nSiberia and in the Far North). This pattern was followed and\nexpanded during the Soviet period, in particular in the years of\nStalin\u2019s rule. In addition, workers were enticed to come to the\nregion to develop the region\u2019s resources (gold, diamonds, even\nmammoth tusks, and more). Workers were paid double or triple\nwages and even remote locations were developed with\ninfrastructure, transportation links, and social and cultural\nsubsidies. Now in post-Soviet and oligarchic capitalist Russia,\nthese economic infusions have been eliminated, leaving towns and\nvillages along the Lena to diminish in population but increase in\nsocial problems and structural ruin. An ironic consequence is that\nmany in the region feel that communism gave them a better life, in\nsome views even better under the terror of Stalin\u2019s times.\nThe influx of\nRussian migrants,\nby exile or\nLena River.

For the natives, Russian or Soviet influence and domination\nbrought social change both in terms of urbanization and\nalcoholism, dramatically reducing original culture and ways of life.\nDelta of Lena River. False color satellite imagery.\nNASA. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY I 415\nSiberia is the home to a multitude of rivers, from\nthose that sweep vast territories to hundreds of small\nstreams. The overall pattern is that these rivers flow\nfrom south to north exiting into any of four major seas\n(from west to east \u2013 Barents, Kara, Laptev, and East\nSiberian) that are subsets of the Arctic Ocean. Given\nthe legendary cold of Siberia, rivers such as the Lena\nare frozen for many weeks annually. Naturally, the\nsouthern portions of the river thaw first, sending its\nliquid flowing into the still frozen northern sections.\nThis results in yearly flooding. Abrupt or exaggerated\nbreakup of ice jams caused by this flooding can results\nin large sections of ice being pushed across land,\nsometimes devastating towns and villages. Eventually,\nand again from south to north, the river thaws\nSiberian Rivers.

Flooded\nlowlands become sources of breeding for vast numbers of mosquitoes, horseflies, and other insects. The West\nSiberian Lowland, the world\u2019s largest section of continuously flat land, is bisected by the Ob\u2019 River and is\nextensively flooded most every spring.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe unusual physical and biogeography of the Lena delta has caused it to become a protected area within Russia and to be nominated as a\nUNESCO Heritage Site.\nPioneer of Soviet communism and the Soviet Union\u2019s first leader, Vladimir Ilych Lenin was born Vladimir Ilych Ulyanov, but took the\npseudonym Lenin from the Lena River, drawing inferences from the power and magnitude of the river.\nIn the Komi language, the word \u201cob\u201d means \u201criver.\u201d\nFor 38 photos, often spectacular, of the Yenesei River, its lands, and its peoples, go to: https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/photo\/2013\/08\/a-year-\non-the-yenisei-river\/100580\/\nCheck Your Understanding 416 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

CHAPTER 86\nRussian Domain:\nPolitical Geography I\nEthnoterritorialism in Georgia\nThe country Georgia, definitely not to be confused or conflated with\nthe American state of Georgia, is part of this textbook\u2019s region called the Russian Domain. Georgia also is part\nof the Caucasus regions, a mountainous area that includes Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and a bit of Russia.\nThe internal governance of Georgia offers insightful examples of national self-determination and the post-Soviet\nimplications of Soviet ethnoterritorialism.\n417 418 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nAs a little bit of historical framework, the pattern for Georgia was\none of frequent struggle. Certainly, this can be said of many, many\nparts of the world, but perhaps the region of Georgia has been\nparticularly suited for strife. A portion of what now is Georgia\nth\nadopted Christianity as its official religion in the early 4 century,\nbecoming one of the first in the world to do so. However, its\nneighbors historically included Muslim populations often of some\nmagnitude. Historically, the Islamic Ottoman Empire ruled\nwestward of Georgia. To the south the Persian Empire also\nfeatured Islam. Modern day Islamic countries Turkey, Iran, and\nAzerbaijan lie to the west, south, and east respectively.\nGeorgia\u2019s location in the Caucasus Mountains offered land routes\nbetween Persia and Russia and on to Europe, as well as between\nTurkey and Russia. Trade and conquest sought these passages. The\nmodern sense of the country Georgia came as a kingdom in the\nth th\n11 to 13 centuries under the rule of King David IV and Queen\nTamar the Great, but both before and after those years, it struggled\nwith invaders and empires.\nAnanuri Castle, Georgia.\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Video by mostafa meraji from Pixabay.\nDirect Link to Video (New Tab)\nRussian imperial interest in Georgia was viewed more favorably than that from the Ottoman or Persian\nempires. Russians were fellow Orthodox Christians, though the Georgian Orthodox Christian Church does stand\nalone; however, this fellowship was better than the Islamic pressures of the Ottomans and Persians. A late\nth th\n18 century alliance devolved into an early 19 century annexation of Georgia by Russia. When the Russian\nRevolution of 1917 ended the Romanov dynasty there, Georgia found an opportunity for independence, taking\nthat step in 1918. The Russian Civil War brought victory by the communist Bolshevik Party and secured recovery\nof Georgia back into the Russian fold. Georgia remained part of the Soviet Union, as a republic beginning in 1936,\nuntil the breakup of the USSR in 1991.\nLike all of the republics of the Soviet Union, Georgia was a region (like an American state) based on ethnicity.\nThis was the Georgian ethnic homeland and Georgians surpassed the one-million-person threshold to become\na republic. However, at the same time, Georgian territory included other land that was the ethnic homeland of\nsmaller nationalities. In the northeast corner of Georgia, there was the region of Abkhazia. Abkhazia (or Apsny\nto the natives) was the next ethnoterritorial level down \u2013 an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or ASSR.\nNevertheless, the majority ethnic group in Abkhazia was Georgian (roughly 50%), not Abkhaz (about 20%). RUSSIAN DOMAIN: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY I 419\nUpon the breakup of the Soviet Union, Abkhazia sought to\nbecome an independent country. While all the republics of the\nUSSR became independent countries, the ASSR regions in Russia\nwere upgraded to the republic level in the new Russia. Chechnya,\none of these smaller ethnic regions, sought what could be termed\na double upgrade to country. Russia denied this request, twice\nsmashing Chechnya in brief civil wars. In Georgia, the Abkhaz\nminority population of this ethnic region also sought the double\nupgrade. Naturally, Georgia opposed this move; however,\nGeorgian forces fared poorly in a civil war in 1992-1993. Abkhazia\ngained de facto independence, while Georgia meekly maintained a\nclaim to the territory. In the aftermath, several thousand Georgian\nwere killed in Abkhazia, while a quarter million Georgians were\nexpelled from their homes and from Abkhazia. In over two decades\nfollowing, Russian military and political support increased, so that\nin 2008 Georgia declared Abkhazia to be a \u201cRussian-occupied\nterritory.\u201d Abkhazia considers itself an independent country, but it\nrecognized by very few recognized countries, though it is endorsed\nby Artsakh, Transnistria, and South Ossetia, which are similar post-\nSoviet territories of limited recognition.\nSouth Ossetia also is an ethnic territory within Georgia. Of rather\nmodest population, South Ossetia ranked lower as the South\nOssetian Autonomous Oblast\u2019 (AO). Also of note is the existence of\nNorth Ossetia directly across the border in Russia. Logically, by\nPeacock by Abkhazian lake \u2013 Photo by Viktor Shimin\nnational self-determination North and South Ossetia should be one\non Unsplash\nregion; instead, Soviet machinations with borders and ethnic\ngroups found advantage in splitting this little region in two.\nLike Abkhazia, South Ossetia formerly had a higher number of Georgians living there, not so much anymore.\nIn 1989 as the Soviet Union neared its end, Georgians held 29% of South Ossetia\u2019s nearly one hundred thousand\nresidents, while Ossetians were 66%. By 2015, the numbers had altered to Georgians 7%, Ossetians 90%. Again, as\nwith Abkhazia, this change resulted from military conflict and Russian assistance. Violence broke out in 1991-1992\nbetween South Ossetian and Georgian forces, but to no resolution. 420 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nIn August 2008 skirmishes commenced between the sides,\nbut in the case the stakes were heightened when Russian\nforces attacked Georgia. As it was in Abkhazia, here too\nthousands of Georgians were displaced. Although a ceasefire\nwas established and Russian military backed off, South Ossetia\nasserted its sovereignty and independence, seeking what could\nbe called a triple upgrade from its former status as an AO\nwithin Georgia. Russia recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia\nas independent countries. Of course, the quasi-states of\nArtsakh, Transnistria, and Abkhazia also recognized South\nOssetia\u2019s claim.\nGeorgian man grieves after bombs hit city of Gori in\n2008.

(Other regions such as\nthe krai were simply administrative regions.) Given the opportunities following the dissolution of the Soviet Union,\nit is understandable that some of these ethnic regions stretched the limits in seeking national independence.\nWhile this plan failed for Chechnya inside Russia, it has created autonomy at the least for Abkhazia and South\nOssetia.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nStalin was ethnically Georgian.

Thus, Stalin is the man of steel.\nTo be a Soviet republic and not a lesser region, there must have been 1) at least one million people in the ethnic group, 2) living on the ethnic\nhomeland, and 3) a region that had an international border. Fifteen regional ethnic groups met these qualifications with Russians and the\nRussian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic being the largest by far.

CHAPTER 87\nRussian Domain:\nPopulation Geography I\nAbortion\nIn the sub-field of Geography that is called Population Geography, the focus very much is on births, deaths, and\nmigration. Clearly, abortion directly reduces the number of births that occur. In this essay, we examine the role\nand history of abortion in Russia.\nUnder the tsarist regime and influenced by the Orthodox Church, abortion was illegal in Russia. The Bolshevik\nRevolution repudiated both of these traditional Russian institutions, bringing numerous and far reaching changes.\nOne of these changes was the legalization of abortion, by Lenin\u2019s decree in 1920, becoming the first country to do\nso. Unlike the situation in Russia now, there was no shortage of births; in fact, allowing abortion to bring about\na reduction in births was satisfactory for the new communist leadership. The building of socialism required the\nefforts not only of men, but also of women. The constraints and responsibilities inherent to a large family would\nrestrict mothers\u2019 contributions to societal change. Small family size, even if at the cost of state-funded abortion,\nwould allow women, emancipated women, to participate significantly in socialism. The practice of the government\nin building undersized urban apartments as the city norm also was more than a hint of desired family size.\nIn a truly ironic twist, Stalin reversed Lenin\u2019s decree in 1936, becoming pro-life at the same time that his policies\nwere having millions executed or sent to Siberian labor camps. Yes, the population losses of the Stalinist Terror\n422 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY I 423\nneeded to be offset by a higher birth rate. The subsequent onset of World War II shortly afterward magnified\nthe need for more births to offset war losses. However, since family planning services and the availability of\ncontraceptives were very limited, significant demand for abortion remained, resulting in a black market for\nabortions.\nFollowing Stalin\u2019s death, the 1950s brought a reevaluation of many of his policies, including the ban on abortion.\nIn 1956 abortion once again became legal, apparently due in part to the need to reduce the more dangerous black\nmarket abortions. By then a more and more urban population in crowded living spaces and with modest incomes\nfar preferred the small family size. In 1957 abortions numbered over three million and accounted for a majority of\nall pregnancies in the USSR. (The Central Asian republics of the USSR contributed few of these abortions, inhibited\nby Islamic repudiation of abortion, traditions of large family size, and higher rural population shares.) Abortions\nin the USSR peaked in the 1965. became commonplace. For instance, in 1965 sixteen of every 100 women of\nchildbearing age had an abortion. As a comparison, note that under the current legal status of abortion in the\nUnited States, there has never been a year in which more than one out of every thirty women of childbearing age\nhad an abortion.\nAbortion was the standard method of birth control throughout the Soviet period. As in other countries with legal\nabortion, in the USSR working women were more likely to have abortions than were stay-at-home moms.\nWhile the Soviet Union did produce weaponry and heavy machinery in noteworthy quantity and quality, the\nmanufacture of consumer products commonly was both limited and sub-standard. Access to foreign goods\nwas restricted, as imports from capitalist countries were not favored by the government. This was true too for\ncontraceptives. Few and poor quality were made in the USSR, while few were imported. Soviet men lamented this\ncircumstance by joking that using Soviet condoms was like wearing cement overshoes.\nThe breakup of the USSR brought revolutionary changes to life in Russia, and some change to the practice\nof abortion. While still legal, abortions became simpler and less arduous due to the introduction of the vacuum\naspiration technique. Contraceptives gained some access to the marketplace, though priced by capitalist market\nforces. In 1990 a majority of Russian women had never used any form of contraception other than abortion. At\nthat time abortions doubled the number of live births.\nA serious consequence of multiple abortions is an increased level of infertility among women. At a time when\nRussia\u2019s birth rate is low and the national population in many recent years have declined, it is disturbing that many\nwomen find it difficult to conceive, at least in part due to the effects of previous abortions.\nth\nIn 2003 the Russian government passed a law banning abortion after the 12 week of pregnancy, except\nfor special circumstances. By 2007 live births finally superseded the number of abortions. Given concerns over\npopulation size, for a number of years now the Russian government has set forth pro-natalist policies, such as\nfinancial incentives for parents who add second and third children to their families. Indeed, the number of births in\nRussia rose year by year from 2005 to 2012 with corresponding year by year declines in the numbers of abortions.\nEven so, Russia has struggled to have enough births to offset yearly deaths.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nSpontaneous abortions (biologically occurring, generally due to the inviability of the embryo or fetus) in Dzerzhinsk, a city with a major\nchemical industry and now cited as one of the ten worst polluted places in the world, are three times higher than the Russian average and for\nthe 1990s averaged over 15% of all pregnancies.\nAnother study shows that for 1998-2000 abortions were less common for women with higher education, more common as family size\nincreased, less common with use of high quality contraceptives and more common for cohabitating couples than for married couples.\nFor tabular data on abortions in the USSR\/Russia, especially since 1957, go to:\nhttp:\/\/www.johnstonsarchive.net\/policy\/abortion\/ab-russia.html 424 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nAnikina, Maria. 2008. \u201cRussia: Abortion Resistance Growing.\u201d Spero News Online.

CHAPTER 88\nRussian Domain: Urban Geography I\nNorilsk - A Resource City\nSettled with dual roles as a penal colony in the Soviet\ngulag and as the ultimate mineral extraction and\nprocessing site, Norilsk was an ideal location for both\nroles. Though some very modest settlement occurred\nin the 1920s, Norilsk grew rapidly in the late 1930s with\nan influx of convicts and extraction of mineral\ndeposits. The city now is the world\u2019s northernmost city\nof at least 100,000 people (177 thousand as of 2012).\nThe adjacent Taymyr Peninsula had long been\nknown to hold valuable natural resources. A massive\nand protracted prehistoric eruption of basaltic lava\ncovered the region with minerals, especially in the\nnickel, copper, and palladium categories.\nThe\nsevere\nNorthwest Russia. Cartography by Steve Wiertz.\nnorthern location, which at its extreme includes the world\u2019s\nnorthernmost continental location, possesses a bitterly cold and\nharsh climate, essentially nine months of winter, that significantly\ninhibited settlement of the region. At its worst, the polar winter\nincludes 45 consecutive days when the sun does not rise above the\nhorizon. Not surprisingly even by the early 1930s, the population\nof the region was dominated by small numbers of native peoples,\nspecifically reindeer herders.\nNorilsk at -32\u00b0C.\nPhoto by \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0415\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0438\u043d on Flickr.\n425 426 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nUnder Stalin, the 1930s brought a massive surge in\nthe numbers of convicts in the Soviet Union, from\npolitical prisoners to petty criminals. Given the historic\npush for industrial advancement in the USSR, the need\nfor raw materials, including heavy metals, soared. In a\nsort of perverse logic of supply and demand, the vast\nsupply of prison labor was tapped to fill the demand\nfor the construction of Norilsk and its industry and for\nthe extraction of its minerals. Norilsk\u2019s isolation,\nhundreds of miles from Moscow, also was ideal for a\nprison camp. If the prisoners escaped, where would\nthey go? In fact, every other place seems so distant\nthat Norilsk residents often refer to other places in\nRussia as \u201cthe mainland.\u201d\nTwelve hundred prisoners arrived in October 1935,\nNorilsk area. Cartography by Steve Wiertz.\nbut much larger numbers were to follow, such as\nanother 35,000 in 1938. The camp population reached\nits maximum in 1951 with 72,500 inmates. Given the harsh and sometimes sadistic living conditions in the Soviet\ngulag and the forbidding climates of prison camps locations, it is ironic that here in Norilsk prisoners received\nbetter than average treatment. The vital economic and strategic importance of the development of Norilsk\u2019s\nresources created a need for great efforts on the parts of the convicts and the need to keep these forced laborers\nworking. Nevertheless, thousands of prisoners died in the building of the city and in the extracting of minerals\nfrom open pit mines; however, with the seemingly almost unlimited national pool of prisoners, dead inmates\neasily were replaced with fresh bodies. Gulag records count 16,806 convict deaths, but other estimates reach\n80,000. In all, perhaps a half million convicts passed through Norilsk. Consequently, Norilsk was constructed by\nconvicts, some of whom lived and developed a sense of pride in their accomplishments, choosing to stay in Norilsk\neven after their prison sentences were completed. After the gulag was closed in 1956, industrial expansion of the\ncity continued, but newly by means of laborers who were paid wages two or three times higher than those earned\nin less challenging locations.\nNorilsk became the world\u2019s largest heavy metal smelting complex. The city is dominated by the corporation\nNornickel (Norilsk Nickel up to 2016), now the world\u2019s largest producer of nickel and palladium, as well as a major\nproducer of copper and platinum.\nAt present the difficulty of living in Norilsk is not\nrelated to prison labor, but instead is caused by\nextraordinary levels of pollution. In fact, the\nBlacksmith Institute (now PureEarth) named Norilsk\nto its top ten list of the worst polluted places in the\nworld.\nEssentially all of the industrial construction and\nsubsequent industrial output was undertaken with\nlittle or no pollution controls. Partly this was due to the\nNorilsk. Photo by Ninara on Flickr. frequent pattern of Soviet disregard for individuals in\npursuit of advancement of society as a whole. Partly\nthis was due to the also frequent pattern of Soviet\nindustry discounting investment that didn\u2019t lead to additional output. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: URBAN GEOGRAPHY I 427\nWhile open pit mining leads to degradation of the land, the\ncontamination most affecting the local population is air pollution.\nThe 24\/7 expulsion of gasses, especially sulfur dioxide (SO2), from\nsmelting centers, where the raw ore is separated by type and away\nfrom useless waste material (slag), causes Norilsk to be the world\u2019s\nmost polluted city, when measured by tons of air pollutants per\ncapita. Strikingly, Norilsk\u2019s plumes of SO2 are visible by satellite. At\nnearly double the SO2 output of any other anthropogenic sources,\nNorilsk has acted more like volcanoes. From 2005 to 2017, only the\nAmbrym volcano in Vanuatu released more SO2 than Norilsk did.\nA combination of acid rain created from these emissions and\nliquid and solid waste dumping outside the city has formed a dead\nzone of a roughly thirty-mile radius around the city where nothing\nSulfur dioxide emissions detected by satellite. Image\ngrows.\nfrom NASA Earth Observatory 2017.\nSnowfall may be black from soot or even yellow from sulfur\ndioxide. Though Russia has numerous locations that have air\npollution problems, Norilsk alone produces 20% of Russia\u2019s air pollution. The low volatility of the typically cold air\noften creates temperature inversions in the atmosphere around Norilsk, leaving the air stable and the pollution\nstagnant.\nNumerous health woes are a consequence, especially in terms of respiratory disease. An overall measure is\nthat life expectancy in Norilsk is ten years below the Russian average.\nPerhaps things will get better in Norilsk. Mine operators have set forth a plan to reduce SO2 emission by 75%\nby 2023. Or maybe not. On May 29, 2020, a power plant at Norilsk accidentally leaked 20,000 tons of diesel fuel\ninto nearby rivers. Learned of this a belated two days later, Russian President Vladimir Putin was enraged by the\naccident and by local authorities\u2019 reluctance to report the spill. The diesel fuel colored the affected waterways an\norange\/red hue. It is possible that the oil will reach the Arctic Ocean.\nth\nOn June 28 , 2020, Norilsk Nickel acknowledged that over several hours workers had pumped six thousand\ncubic meters of waste water into the tundra.\nFor a video report on the perplexities of Norilsk, go to this website:\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/video\/index\/545228\/my-deadly-beautiful-city-norilsk\/\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nth\nRed too!

CHAPTER 89\nRussian Domain:\nCultural Geography II\nRussian Orthodox Church\nThe Russian Orthodox Church is a geographically and politically hierarchical Christian church with a geographic\ndistribution of members all across Russia. As the diffusion of Christianity across space occurred historically, the\ncloser proximity of Kiev to Constantinople (658 miles) relative to the distance from Kiev to Rome (1039 miles)\nsimply increased the inherent probability that it would be Orthodoxy and not Catholicism that would reach\nKiev. As the Russian state expanded to Moscow as the new center and to Siberia as the new periphery, the\nOrthodox Church came along too.\nIn 988, Vladimir I, ruler of Kievan Rus, officially established the Orthodox Church as the religion of the land. At\nthat time the Church was a branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church coming out of Byzantium.\nCuriously, for all of the dynamics and shifts that would come to pass in the power relationship between church\nand state, one of the periods of the least state control or authority over the church came during the Mongol\nconquest. While the Mongols exerted territorial control, they expressed very little interest in the religious life of\nRussia, though of course the Mongols themselves were not Orthodox.\nAs political power progressively moved to Moscow, so too did the church\u2019s authority and in 1325 the official\n429 430 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nresidence. In 1448 the Russian Church broke from the Eastern Church, a break that was made permanent with the\n1453 fall of Constantinople, the center of Orthodoxy.\nMoscow became the \u201cThird Rome,\u201d a separate holder of religious truth and authority. Within Russia, however,\nthe Orthodox Church\u2019s degree of authority vacillated, depending on the attitude of the political elite \u2013 first the\nattitude of the tsars, later that of the communist party, and now mainly that of Vladimir Putin.\nth\nFor instance, when Patriarch Nikon sought to reform the Orthodox Church in the 17 century, he also\nendeavored to place the church\u2019s authority over that of the state. His church reforms held, but his political moves\nfailed and led to him being deposed in 1666.\nTsar Peter the Great during his reign (1682-1725) eliminated the\nPatriarchate and established a political link to the church that\nrequired his own authorization for church decisions. Though\nmonasticism is a key element of the Orthodox tradition, Peter\nestablished an age limit of 50 as the minimum age for men to join\nmonastic orders, thereby sharply reducing the number of new\nmonks (but keeping the supply of potential soldiers high).\nUnusual and charismatic religious figures have appeared in\nRussia, though perhaps none more noteworthy or curious than\nGrigori Rasputin, the mad monk. Under the last tsar, Rasputin\nearned the favor of the royal court by apparently healing the tsar\u2019s\nson Alexis of hemophilia. Eventually Rasputin\u2019s wild debauched\nbehavior and growing influence prompted a group of Russian\nnobles to kill him. Rasputin\u2019s legendary position gained fame when\nthese nobles seemingly had to kill him over and over, before he\nactually did die. A somewhat glossy dramatization of his role\nappeared in Netflix\u2019s 2019 six-part series \u201cThe Last of the Czars.\u201d\nWhatever the exact relationship between Tsar and Orthodox\nChurch, there was a relationship and an understanding that the\nRussian Orthodox Church was the faith of the state and of the\npeople. This ended with the Bolshevik Revolution, when the new\ncommunist government instituted a policy of separation of church\nand state.\nRussian Orthodox Church at Peter and Paul Fortress\nin St. Petersburg, Russia. Photo by Joel Weigand RUSSIAN DOMAIN: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY II 431\nUnder communism, this separation was neither benign nor\npassive. In fact, the Soviet government pursued a policy of\natheism, tolerating a minimum of religious faith, though what\nexisted was very dominantly Russian Orthodoxy. Soviet\nauthorities closed thousands of churches, turning them into\nneutral facilities such as warehouses or into facilities wholly\ninappropriate for holy buildings \u2013 into swimming pools or even\ninto museums of atheism. Many churches simply were\ndemolished. Soviet officials imprisoned and killed both priests\nand believers. At least 200,000 died specifically for their\nreligious beliefs, reminiscent of the early Christian martyrs,\nthough truly in much higher numbers in Russia than in other\nhistorical or geographic settings. In addition to this deadly\ntactic, the Soviet infiltration of the priesthood, making some\npriests into spies and informants for the state, was an\napproach that perhaps was more insidious than martyrdom.\nA major policy shift occurred during World War II. In dire\nneed to popular support for the war effort, Stalin appealed to\nCathedral of the Archangel in the Kremlin\u2019s Cathedral\nnationalism and love of the homeland. Understanding love for\nSquare, Moscow, Russia.\nthe church as an aspect of love of the country, Stalin greatly\nPhoto by Joel Weigand\nrelaxed government pressures on the church. In fact, some\n25,000 churches were allowed to open and hold services. This\nopen policy was reversed in the subsequent Khrushchev era.\nUpon the end of communism, the Russian Orthodox Church was thrust into a new position. Gone was the\noppression of state atheism. A strong majority of the roughly 150 million citizens of Russia are Russians, and thus,\nintrinsically belong to Russian Orthodox Church. No longer subject to the dictates of the Tsar or of communism,\nthe faithful now can worship in peace. However, seventy years of Soviet atheism left its mark; at the breakup of\nthe Soviet Union, many Russians had no sense of connection to the renewed church.\nNumerous other denominations have stepped into this religious void. In particular, missionaries from the\nUnited States have endeavored to bring non-believers to Christian faith. While meeting with some success in\nguiding new converts, these denominations face the hostility of both the Russian government and the Russian\nOrthodox Church, largely because these groups are viewed as Western interventions that hurt Russian national\nunity. Some religious recruiters were authentically American \u2013 Mormons riding trains with boxes of Bibles \u2013\nwhile others had a more widespread background. Whatever their religious heritage, these missionaries entered\na Russia that held a spiritual schism \u2013 a strong national heritage in the Russian Orthodox Church surrounded\nby a population raised in atheism and often viewing the church as traitorous or collaborative with Soviet\nauthority. Without much difficulty, these new missionary arrivals made significant numbers of converts.\nThis success, done predominantly by foreigners, was viewed with great trepidation by the Russian Orthodox\nChurch. The church even categorized some incoming religious groups, such as the Mormons, as \u201ctotalitarian\nsects.\u201d Similar concerns were shared by Russian politicians whose pride often was stung by the foreigners who\napparently viewed Russia as needing improvement, even at this very personal level. 432 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe national government\u2019s response of church and state was a\n1997 law restricting religion. To avoid major restrictions on their\nactivities, these religious organizations had to show proof of their\nexistence in Russia for the preceding fifteen years. Since that\ntime frame included nearly a decade of the Soviet period during\nwhich foreign missionaries were completely excluded from\nentering the country, this restriction applied to almost all new\nreligious efforts in Russia. A few groups, such as Russian\nPentecostals and Baptists, could pass this test. Over two\nthousand religious groups were dissolved.

CHAPTER 90\nRussian Domain:\nEconomic Geography II\nOligarchs\nWhat is an oligarchy? The philosopher Aristotle coined this term centuries ago, explaining that it meant rule by\na few. Those few elite in the ruling class would be the oligarchs. Although this concept has been used to define\ndifferent societies, in recent years it is directed mainly to Russia.\nIn Russia, the oligarchs often do not have a specific political position, but have such incredible wealth that their\neconomic power brings outsized political influence as well. Or as Russian President Vladimir Putin has explained,\n1\n\u201cOligarchs are those who use their proximity to the authorities to receive super profits.\u201d\nIt is curious that Russia should have these circumstances at present, when Russian history does not recall similar\nsituations. During the tsarist period of Russia, indeed the tsars ruled with autocratic powers. Certainly there were\nother rich people, but their authority was dependent upon their respective tsar\u2019s good favor and benevolence.\nUnder Soviet communism, the expressed goal was a classless society. Instead, there was a vast lower-middle\nclass, imbalanced by a few elite political figures. The political elite had comfortable lives with perks, such as better\nhousing and access to restricted goods. However, even at the pinnacle, there was not fantastic wealth. Stalin was\nnot a billionaire.\nUpon the end of the Soviet Union, a great transformation of society began without a comprehensive plan. The\n435 436 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\npathway to political power shifted from the Communist Party to, well to something else. The political control\nof the economy faltered, as the transition to capitalism began. Under communism, the State owned all the\nsignificant means of production, except for personal property and small private plots of rural land. The State\nowned all the factories, all the resources, all the forests and fields, and just about everything. How to shift to\ncapitalism with private ownership of property and resources?\nA major and utilized approach argued that as the State had owned all the natural resources, inherently the\npeople of Russia owned all the natural resources. As the State had owned all the factories, inherently the people\nof Russia owned all the factories. Therefore, the government issued vouchers, in a sense like shares of stock,\nto the citizens of Russia for ownership of various resources and factories. For many Russians, having lived all\ntheir lives under communism, these vouchers seemed alien and of uncertain value. For a savvy few, the vouchers\nwere one means to wealth. Many Russians were delighted to be paid small sums for their vouchers, but the\ntorrent of sales of vouchers to small numbers of speculators led to a short list of buyers owning huge quantities\nof vouchers. The individual vouchers were purchased for piddling sums, indeed below face value, whereas when\ntotaled these shares accomplished control over massive fortunes of raw materials in particular. This was simply\none of many means that a few people used to create incredible wealth in Russia, while the average lower-middle\nclass person stayed lower-middle class or fell into poverty. These forms of wealth acquisition typically were\nopaque and corrupt.\nThese billionaires have a taste for ostentatious expression of\ntheir wealth. They build extravagant homes and show off luxurious\ntoys. They buy sports teams. For instance, Mikhail Prokhorov\nowns the yacht Palladium (seen in the photo to the left), as the\nname reflected his wealth in minerals, in particular from the\ncompany Norilsk Nickel. Pictured here, the yacht is the world\u2019s\nsecond largest, purchased for $400 million. From 2010 to 2019, he\nowned a controlling interest in the NBA team \u2013 the New Jersey Nets\n(in 2012 the team moved to New York City, becoming the Brooklyn\nNets). Oligarch Roman Abramovich is the owner of the Chelsea\nFootball club.\nThe oligarchs of Russia began their accumulation of wealth and\nOligarch yacht. Photo by mhobl on Flickr.\npower during the presidency of Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, but\ncontinued through the two decades of rule by Vladimir Putin.\nUnder Putin, it is clear that the continued wealth of the oligarchs is linked to Putin\u2019s political patronage. A clear\nexample is the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Khodorkovsky became a billionaire, largely through ownership of\nthe oil company Yukos. Overly emboldened by his wealth, he became an outspoken critic of Putin, so that in 2003\nhe was arrested for tax evasion. He was convicted and in 2005 was jailed, at first to a Soviet-style prison camp in\nthe Chita region of Siberia. Putin pardoned him in 2013, upon his promise to stay out of politics.\nOligarch Boris Berezovsky also was a vocal critic of Putin. Berezovsky left Russia and was convicted in absentia\nof fraud and embezzlement. He never returned to Russia. After two cases of alleged and failed assassination\nattempts, Berezovsky was found dead at home in England in 2013, hanged under circumstances that a British\ninquest could neither verify as murder nor as suicide.\nPutin now has been quoted as saying the oligarchs no longer exist in Russia, but this is silly. In 2018, the United\nStates government released a list of Russian billionaires, labeling 96 of them as oligarchs. Putin himself clearly is\na billionaire, though calculating his wealth is difficult.\nThe oligarchs of Russia are the consequence of a chaotic and runaway transition from communism to\ncapitalism. It could be said that communist pioneer and the first leader of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin is RUSSIAN DOMAIN: ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY II 437\nspinning in his grave, except that his preserved body literally still lies on display in the tomb in Red Square in\nMoscow.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nAndrea Bernstein\u2019s new book American Oligarchs: The Kushners, the Trumps, and the Marriage of Money and Power suggests that in 2020\nthe American administration features oligarchs too.\nCheck Your Understanding\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

CHAPTER 91\nRussian Domain:\nHistorical Geography II\nWho were the Tsars?\nWho was the first king in the world? Probably we do not have an answer to that question, for it is likely that\nsuch a ruler existed before recorded history. Additionally, we might debate the question of what characteristics\nare needed for someone to be recognized as a king.\nHowever, we do know who was the first Tsar of Russia. Still, the first rulers of Russia were not known as\ntsars, nor were the original ruled lands the same as the lands of Russia now. Of course, as we go backwards in\ntime and in historical geography, eventually we find small sections of land that were controlled by powerful men\n(occasionally women?) of the time. Control, power, size, inheritance, wealth, life expectancy, and other factors\nproduced an ebb and flow of authority or at times the lack thereof.\nAs it was around the world, eventually somewhere in what now we are calling the Russian Domain, enlarged\nand recognized central authority was consolidated. In the case of the Russian Domain, this first was Kievan Rus.\nA group of Slavic lands centralized around Kiev were ruled by Prince Oleg from 892 to 912. Other notable rulers of\nthat time were Grand Prince Vladimir the Great (980-1015) and Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise (1019-1054). This\n438 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY II 439\nth\nstate broke into pieces throughout the 11 century, saw its authority decreased by a rise in the status of rival city\nVladimir, and finally was conquered by the Mongols in the 1240s.\nThe rise of Vladimir found its apex with the rule of Grand Prince Alexander Nevsky, 1252-1263. Following\nNevsky, the Vladimir region also fragmented, eventually creating a new opening to be filled by the rise of Moscow.\nThrough several rulers of the Moscow region, it too paid tribute to the Mongols for numerous years.\nIn 1533 at the age of three and upon his father\u2019s death, Ivan IV\nwas declared the Grand Prince of Moscow, though regents\nrepresented him until 1547. At age sixteen, Ivan was crowned as\nTsar of All the Russias, thereby consolidating authority over the\nlands of Novgorod, Kiev, Vladimir, and Moscow \u2013 all the Russian\nlands.\nIt was this Ivan whose armies conquered the Mongol forces of\nthe city Kazan in 1552, triggering the end of Mongol control of\nRussian lands. Ivan sought to expand Russia\u2019s territory, including\nmoving into Siberia. Because of the fearsomeness of Ivan\u2019 rule, he\ngained the name Ivan the Terrible.\nIvan IV was the first Tsar of Russia, among some thirty such\nrulers. Some of these Tsars were noteworthy, some barely a\nfootnote in the historical record. But from where did this title\ncome? The word \u201cTsar\u201d often has been Americanized into the word\n\u201cCzar.\u201d However, Czar is a poor transliteration of the Russian word\nand in particular of the Cyrillic letter \u0446. The Cyrillic word for this\nroyal title is \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c. For experts in Russian or Slavic Studies, the\nCyrillic letter \u0446 routinely is spelled ts in English. (This is\ntransliteration, the transference of letters or words of one language\ninto the letters or words of a different language, as different than\ntranslation, which confers the meaning of words from one\nlanguage to another.) Thus, in English the word should be spelled\n\u201cTsar.\u201d The original derivation of this word goes back to the Roman\ntitle \u201cCaesar.\u201d\nPortrait of Ivan IV by Viktor Vasnetsov, 1897\n(Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow).

CHAPTER 92\nRussian Domain:\nPhysical Geography II\nKamchatka\nThe Oxford dictionary defines a peninsula as \u201ca piece of land almost surrounded by water or projecting out into\na body of water.\u201d Kamchatka is a Russian peninsula with volcanoes.\nThe Kamchatka Peninsula extends 900 miles southward from the nearly easternmost part of Russia. With over\n350,000 people in an area over 182 thousand square miles, Kamchatka averages about two people per square\nmile. In truth, over half (187 thousand) of those people are in its provincial capital city Petropavlosk-Kamchatsky.\nFire and Ice. While Russia is well known for its cold weather, Russia\u2019s Kamchatka Peninsula, along with the\nadjacent Kuril Islands, provides the country with a unique combination of fire and ice. As part of the Pacific\nOcean\u2019s \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d Kamchatka contains volcanoes, both ancient (dating to the Pleistocene Era) and active\n(30). At the same time Kamchatka\u2019s high latitude and often high elevation bring snowfall and cold to the region.\nPreservation of region has been promoted by establishment of nature preserves, combined as a UNESCO World\nHeritage Site. Due to its remote location, the peninsula had relatively late exploration and remains notably little\naffected by human interaction.\n441 442 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe Kamchatka Peninsula is in the Russian Far East and extends\ninto the Pacific Ocean, separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the\nBering Sea portion of the ocean. The Kuril Islands dip southward\nfrom the tip of Kamchatka. Astride the edges of tectonic plates,\nKamchatka benefits from the geological forces of subduction that\nrelease molten material from the Earth\u2019s mantle. The resulting rise\nof this magma creates not only volcanoes and eruptions, but also a\nvariety of thermal activity in Kamchatka, including hot springs and\ngeysers.

Along with the geysers of Yellowstone National Park in the United States and similar\nsites in Iceland and New Zealand, Kamchatka\u2019s \u201cValley of Geysers\u201d contained twenty large geysers and some 200\nsmaller thermal springs. However, on June 3, 2007, the structural collapse of an adjacent mountainside delivered\nan immense tonnage of rock material into the Valley of Geysers covering geysers and damming water flow from\nthe Geyser River.

CHAPTER 93\nRussian Domain:\nPolitical Geography II\nRussia's Autocrats and Vladimir Putin\nThe political history of the Russian people largely is subjugation under a series of autocrats. The chronology of\nstrongmen\/strongwomen leading the country with great power began with the reign of Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) in\n1547. With singular figures such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, as well as bumps along the historical\nroad of authority, Russian history brings us to the current autocrat Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.\nOf course, throughout the world and throughout history, peoples and lands have been ruled by powerful figures\n\u2013 tsars, kings, caesars, queens, princes, etc. At other times these autocrats have been elected figures, generally\nthrough fraudulent, coercive, or meaningless elections. It would seem that Russia has had at least its fair share of\nautocrats, perhaps more so that most countries.\nIvan the Terrible was the first Russian ruler to take the title \u201cTsar.\u201d His moniker \u201cTerrible\u201d uses the Russian word\n\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439; however, theword may be translated as \u201cformidable\u201d or \u201cfearsome\u201d as well as \u201cterrible.\u201d In the case\nof Ivan IV, all of these meanings fit. Ivan created a feared force of Oprichniki \u2013 \u041e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, essentially his own\npersonal army, empowered to eliminate his enemies. Over a decade, these forces killed about 4000 Russians. On\ntop of all this, Ivan, in a fitful rage, himself killed his namesake son Ivan.\n446 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 447\nPeter the Great was the next prominent Tsar of Russia. Peter\u2019s\nreign featured many great accomplishments, including\nWesternizing and modernizing Russia. His construction of the city\nof St. Petersburg was part of this Westernization, but cost the lives\nof many employed in the rugged circumstances of building this\ncity. Peter\u2019s tax on beards was a sticking point of opposition, but\nthe revolt by the Streltsi, an elite Russian guard, was crushed and\nover a thousand executed, while others were banished to Siberia.\nPeter too had his own son killed.\nTsar Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar, also had his own secret\npolice \u2013 the Okhrana.\nThe accomplishments of the Russian tsars along with their\nabuses of power, sometimes violent, were facilitated by the\nmagnitude of their power, even as often their power was viewed as\ndirectly given by God.\nCuriously or perhaps ironically not, while the 1917 Russian\nRevolution ended the Romanov dynasty, it did not bring the end to\nautocratic rule in Russia. Instead, the lands of the Russian Empire\nmorphed into a somewhat similar landmass as the Soviet Union.\nVladimir Lenin, once exiled to Siberia by the tsarist government and\nhaving had brother executed by the Russian government in 1886, Statue of Peter the Great, expressing his maritime\nbecame the initial leader of vicious and oppressive Soviet Union. interests. St. Petersburg, Russia. Photo by Vivian\nAlthough Lenin\u2019s rule was brief due to his premature death at age Quam.\n53, posthumously he was treated with an almost religious cult-like\nobsession, so that his body has been preserved in a public tomb in Red Square even to this date.\nJoseph Stalin donned the mantle of absolute power and authority,\ntwisting it into an obsession of cleansing the citizenry of any hint of opposition, real or imaginary, toward him or\nthe idealized Soviet society. Under Stalin, millions of Russians and other Soviet ethnicities were killed and\/or sent\nto labor camps (often in Siberia). During Soviet communism, the secret police forces changed in name but served\nlargely the same purposes of intimidation and investigation. They included the Cheka, the NKVD, the KGB, and\nothers.\nAfter Stalin there were several different leaders of the Soviet Union from the inimical Nikita Khrushchev to the 448 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nfinal Mikhail Gorbachev. All of these were powerful figures, but within a group of leadership in the governing\nPolitburo.\nUpon the breakup of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev was succeeded in power by Boris Yeltsin in the new Russia,\nthe largest remnant of the USSR. Yeltsin was President of Russia from 1991 to 1999, at times seen as a hero and\nat times an alcholic buffoon.\nThe return of the autocrat began slowly, but with the arrival of Vladimir Putin, handpicked by Yeltsin as his\nsuccessor. The savvy Putin had worked as a KGB operative (eventually Lt. Colonel) from 1975 to 1991, but with the\ncollapse of the Soviet Union, he sought to find a new career in politics. Putin worked within the St. Petersburg city\ngovernment from 1991-1996, before moving to Moscow and moving up in political authority, gaining the favor of\nYeltsin. In August 1999, the national parliament or duma elected him as Prime Minister, ranking second in national\nauthority to the president. However, at the end of December Boris Yeltsin resigned. Following constitutional\nprocedure, Putin the prime minister succeeded Yeltsin to begin 2000 as Russia\u2019s president.\nAlthough a relatively unknown figure upon his move to Moscow in 1996, Putin was President of Russia by\n2000. This is a spectacular rise in power that foretold a similarly steep increase in authority, as Putin became\nRussia\u2019s autocrat. Yet, this was a different sort of autocrat. Tsars were part of hereditary dynasties, chosen by\nGod. Stalin held autocratic control in a Soviet Union where elections were held but were limited to a single party\nthat typically received 99% of the vote. Putin became president in a new Russia that had experienced less than a\ndecade of striving for a true democratic government. Soon, Putin maneuvered within that new system to become\nthe dominant ruler. Although the Russian constitution limited presidents to two consecutive four-year terms,\nPutin found a loophole. After serving as President of Russia for eight years \u2013 2000-2008, Putin stepped sideways\nbecoming Prime Minister, while his Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev was elected President. For 2008-2012, Putin\nstill remained the de facto ruler, simply doing so from the role of prime minister. In 2012 Putin was elected\npresident once again, but now for a six-year term. He was re-elected in 2018 and will serve until 2024. In January\n2020, Putin announced a reshuffling of the government and constitution. This shuffle introduced a new Prime\nMinister Mikhail Mishustin, among other changes. It was understood that these rewritten rules of government\nwould allow Putin to remain in power after his term and term limits expire in 2024. Indeed, in July 2020 the\nRussian government held a referendum that proposed adding 206 amendments (Has any country ever done\nthis?) to the Russian constitution. Although the newly amended constitution was printed and available for sale in\nbookstores BEFORE voting was held, votes were cast and collected in traditional locations, but also in trunks of\ncars, in parked buses, and at other odd settings. Officially, nearly 79% of the votes approved the constitutional\nchanges, though widespread fraud was alleged. Putin\u2019s current term as president will end in 2024, but under the\nnew constitution he will be able to run for two additional six-year terms of office. If he remains as president for RUSSIAN DOMAIN: POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY II 449\nall those years and if we count his four years as prime minister, he will have served as Russia\u2019s ruler for 36 years.\nThis would surpass the records of Joseph Stalin (29 years) and Catherine the Great (34 years).\nIn addition to Putin\u2019s maneuvering power grabs, his autocratic rule can be seen in the arrests and\/or deaths of\nrival politicians, wealthy opponents or potential opponents, and investigative journalists. In 2017 the Washington\nPost published a list of ten prominent critics of Putin who died in suspicious ways. Among them was former KGB\nofficer Alexander Litvinenko was died in London in 2006, poisoned by radioactive polonium-210. Journalist Anna\nPolitkovskaia was shot and killed in Moscow also in 2006. In 2018 a major scandal formed after Russia emigrants\nSergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with a chemical nerve agent in Salisbury, England. Now on August 20,\n2020, political opposition leader Alexei Novalny is in a coma, reportedly due to poison in his tea. These patterns of\narrests and killings are certainly part of the pattern of authority that Putin knew in his KGB days, autocratic control\nthat was the way of life under Stalin, and in fact in Tsarist Russia too.\nThe wealth of the tsars was on public display and can now be seen in museums and historic buildings in\nRussia. Vladimir Putin\u2019s private wealth is less obvious, but observation of his homes, clothing, watches, and other\nexamples of wealth has prompted Western journalists to estimate his wealth in the billions of dollars. Hedge fund\nmanager Bill Browder suggests that Putin\u2019s net worth may be $200 billion, which would make Putin the wealthiest\nperson in the world. Whatever the great wealth, it would not come from Putin\u2019s modest salary of a few hundred\nthousand dollars a year. Instead the wealth would be gained from forms of corruption, essentially taking money\nfrom Russia, its resources, and its people.\nVladimir Putin is the latest in a long history of Russian autocrats, now placed in the context of an intendedly\ndemocratic and resource rich Russia. In this long history of autocrats and secret police, it is noteworthy to observe\nthat the former KGB officer has become the autocrat.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe killing of Ivan\u2019s son by his own hand is depicted in a famous painting my renowned Russian artist Ilya Repin.\nThe board game Kremlin offers a satirical look at the power structure of Soviet days.\nEven if Putin rules Russia for 36 years, he will fall far short of the 70 years that the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej ruled Thailand.

Sobhuza II became the king of Swaziland as an infant and\nremained king for 82 years.\nCheck Your Understanding\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

CHAPTER 94\nRussian Domain:\nPopulation Geography II\nImbalanced Sex Ratio\nThe sex ratio is a very useful and flexible demographic statistic.\nThis measurement considers the balance between males and females in a population, usually expressed as males\nper 100 females. A low sex ratio is fewer than 100 males for each 100 females, while a high sex ratio shows more\nthan 100 males for each 100 females.\nThere are numerous factors that affect the sex ratio. Although non-intuitive to contemplate, due to human\nbiology, the sex ratio at birth is normally 105-107. Again, that would mean 105-107 boys born for every 100 girls\nborn. While it seems that the sex ratio at birth ought to be 100 (it\u2019s a boy or a girl, thus seemingly even odds),\nthis is not the case. Given that males die at every age more often than females, males need the head start in the\nbiological run. Actually, the race begins even before conception, as the sex ratio at conception is about 115. This\nmeans that countries with high birth rates will have a higher share of children (more boys than girls, because of\nthe birth head start) in their populations, thus a high sex ratio. Given Russia\u2019s current long trend of low birth rates\n(12.2 in 2020), the boys\u2019 head start does not produce a high sex ratio in Russia.\nSignificant factors influencing sex ratios and life expectancy include risk levels of male jobs, behavior, and war.\nClearly military service is performed by more men than women; in some countries, women are not allowed in\n451 452 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nthe military. Military service creates risks, obviously magnified greatest in actual military conflicts, skirmishes,\nand wars. True throughout the world, more male soldiers die than women soldiers. Definitely, this factor has\ninfluenced Russia\u2019s sex ratio, primarily decades ago with World War II and to a modest extent in Russia\u2019s invasion\nof Afghanistan and its civil wars with Chechnya. Russia\u2019s low sex ratio after World War II has failed to recover in\nany significant ways.\nRussia has many rugged lands where resource extraction is important. Typically, workers in these harsh settings\nare men. Definitely inherited from Soviet days, Russia\u2019s industrial cities face significant levels of pollution. More\nmen than women work in these dangerously toxic settings, thereby reducing life expectancy and the sex ratio.\nIndeed, these factors contribute to a lower sex ratio in Russia.\nLifestyle choices affect sex ratios, particularly when risks are\nnot shared evenly between men and women. Levels of alcohol\nconsumption in Russia are vastly different for men than for\nwomen. Very high levels of alcohol abuse by men in Russia has\nled to significantly high ranges of illness and death. Addiction\nin Russia has expanded beyond alcohol to a variety of drugs,\nbut particularly to heroin. Russia is now the world\u2019s largest\nuser of heroin, as brought across former Soviet Central Asia\nfrom Afghanistan. Like anywhere else, more men are addicted\nusers than women are. Smoking long has been known to\nreduce life expectancy, but in Russia and throughout the world,\nmore men smoke than do women. These and other lifestyle\nDrunk man in St. Petersburg, Russia. Photo by Ralf choices reduce male life expectancy sharply in Russia, while\nSteinberger on Flickr. only marginally affecting the female population. Many more\nmale deaths than female deaths have distinctly lowered the sex\nratio in Russia.\nSince 1985, Russia ranks number one in the world in total number of suicides. For an interesting animated\ngraphic comparing countries on this measure go to \u2013 https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/suicides1985 . Russia and the United\nStates are the only two countries with over one million suicides in that time frame. France and Ukraine ( also in\nthe Russian Domain) are neck and neck for fourth and fifth place, while Japan is third. Suicide rates and totals in\nChina and India are disputed.\nWhich countries have the highest rates of suicide (that is different than total numbers)? Several of the top rates\nare revealed in countries formerly in the Soviet Union. #1 \u2013 Lithuania, 2 \u2013 Russia (31 per 100,000 people \u2013 but 56\nmale, 9 female), 5 \u2013 Belarus, 7 \u2013 Kazakhstan, 8 \u2013 Ukraine, 9 \u2013 Latvia. Numbers 2, 5, and 8 are in our region defined\nas the Russian Domain. Note that globally men kills themselves more than women kill themselves. Obviously,\nthat trend affects the sex ratio.\nAging of a population lowers its sex ratio, as biologically women live longer than men, hence the head start\ngiven to baby boys. With Russia being in Stage 5 (or the extended Stage 4) of the Demographic Transition, Russia\nhas had many years for declining birth rates and declining death rates. With lower death rates come longer\nlife expectancies that produce relatively more older women than older men. Compared to countries around the\nworld, Russia and several other post-Soviet countries have some of the largest gaps between male and female life\nexpectancies.

Or war, as #1 is Syria.\nAs a result of these many factors, Russia has one of the lowest sex ratios in the world. Given that societal\nelements inherited from the communist period had wide distribution across the USSR, it is not surprising that\nother former Soviet republics, now independent countries, also feature very low sex ratios. Of note, the other\nlocations in the top ten are small Caribbean islands.\nSEX RATIO IN POST-SOVIET COUNTRIES\nRanked in World Post-Soviet Country Sex Ratio\n2 Latvia 84.8\n3 Lithuania 85.3\n6 Ukraine 86.3\n7 Armenia 86.5\n8 - tied Russia 86.8\n8 - tied Belarus 86.8\n10 Estonia 88\nWorld in 2015 101.8\nUSA 98.3\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nSex ratios in China are skewed from the norm, significantly due to the country\u2019s former One-Child Policy that heightened existing levels of\nson preference, thereby leading to noteworthy levels of gender-based abortion and higher levels of female mortality. 454 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA curious finding among a few studies suggests that during wars, the sex ratio at birth may rise slightly, as if in biological response and\nadjustment for male lives lost in the war.\nCheck Your Understanding\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Drunk Man in Saint Petersburg, Russia. https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/russiadrunkard. Attribution 2.0\nGeneric (CC BY 2.0). CHAPTER 95\nRussian Domain:\nUrban Geography II\nThe Rank\/Size Rule\nThe Rank-Size Rule was derived by Harvard Professor George Kingsley Zipf. When used to express the\nrelationship between ranked urban population size within a single region or country, it has the mathematical\nequation shown to the left,\nwhere P equals population of a given city, while n equals the ranked order of that city among all cities in that\nregion or country. Thus, P1 is the population of the number one or largest city. When applied to countries across\nthe globe, few countries show a distribution that matches the Rank-Size Rule.\nIt can be asserted that countries that fulfill three specific characteristics are likely to have a population\ndistribution that can be modeled at least to some extent by the Rank-Size Rule. Keep in mind that such a country\nwill have numerous large cities with a progressively declining population distribution by ranked order.\nFirst, countries that have large areas may have a rank-size distribution, for a large area allows many cities to\ngrow significantly in size. Ever since the progressive annexation of Siberian territory, Russia has been the largest\nland of the world. Even before the Russian Revolution, the Russian Empire held vast lands across Siberia and over\nCentral Asia, so that the new Soviet Union also was a huge country. The breakup of the USSR created fifteen new\ncountries, with Russia still by far the largest. As the largest country in the world by land area, clearly Russia meets\nthis first criterion.\nSecond, countries that have large populations may have a rank-size distribution, for a large population provides\nenough people to inhabit many cities of significant size. In 1900 Russia held a population of about 125 million\npeople, certainly large enough to meet this criterion. However, while Moscow had gained urban preeminence from\nearly Russian history, under Tsar Peter the Great a new city St. Petersburg was built and designated as the new\ncapital city. With this change, St. Petersburg challenged Moscow for importance and population size. Until Moscow\nregained its role as capital city under Bolshevik rule in the Soviet Union, St. Petersburg\u2019s rivalry prevented Russia\n455 456 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nfrom matching the rank-size distribution. The two major cities were too close together in population; for under the\nrank-size rule, the population of the second largest city is projected to be only half that of the largest city.\nThird, countries that have a long history of urbanization and industrialization may have a rank-size distribution.\nIn this case a sufficient amount of time is necessary for the development of a number of large cities. For this\ncriterion tsarist rulers of Russia had brought industrialization and urbanization patterns from Europe; however,\nthese trends were far behind those of Europe, and especially those of Western Europe. While Russia may have\nbeen ahead of countries and regions that we now often designate as in the Third World, Russia was not advanced\nin terms of industrialization and urbanization. This was to change, however, under Soviet rule. The dominance of\nheavy industry and the planned socialist economy in the Soviet Union prompted substantial industrialization and\nurbanization.\nThus, in the USSR all three of these criteria were met, strongly suggesting that a rank-size distribution of urban\npopulation may be present. The USSR had the large area, the large population, and sufficient years of urbanization\nto develop many large cities. Additionally, the secondary importance of capital cities of Soviet republics protected\nagainst the single dominance of Moscow, while the ascendancy of Moscow over St. Petersburg left Moscow as the\nsingle top city.\nAn examination of the 1989 population figures for the largest seven cities of the USSR indeed does show a\nrank-size distribution. Of course, it must be noted that the Rank-Size Rule cannot possibly predict actual urban\npopulations down to the last man, woman, and child. Some error is expected of the magnitudes shown here. It\nis the general pattern and the geographic causes of that pattern that are important to understand. Indeed, using\nthe Rank-Size Rule for 1989, St. Petersburg is projected or predicted to be 4.4 million when it actually was 4.5\nmillion; thus, the projection was only wide by about 2%. These small variations are acceptable in demonstrating\nthe Rank-Size Rule.\nCity by Rank Population (in millions) Projected Rank % Unrounded Error\nMoscow 8.8 1\nSt. Petersburg 4.5 4.40 2 2.22%\nKiev 2.6 2.93 3 -11.26%\nTashkent 2.1 2.20 4 -4.76%\nKharkov 1.6 1.76 5 -10.31%\nMinsk 1.6 1.46 6 8.33%\nNizhniy Novgorod 1.4 1.25 7 10.20%\nSince the dissolution of the Soviet Union into fifteen separate countries, no longer can Russia be considered to\nmatch the rank-size distribution. This is apparent just in a careful examination of the very data above. Four of the\ntop seven cities of the Soviet Union are not in Russia \u2013 specifically, Kiev (Ukraine), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Kharkov\nand Minsk (both in Belarus). Three, as noted, were capital cities of republics that then became countries. Thus,\nwe are left with the interesting situation that Soviet urbanization and industrialization provided the third link in\nthe creation of the country\u2019s rank-size distribution, but the end of the same Soviet authority has now left Russia\nwithout an ideal rank-size pattern, even though it still possesses the three expected criteria. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: URBAN GEOGRAPHY II 457\nStatistics from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service display the continued lack of a match of the Rank-Size\nRule for contemporary Russia. Here are the numbers for 2017, as they show very substantial prediction errors.\nThe pattern of overestimating the size of lesser cities in Russia demonstrates that Moscow might be considered a\nprimate city.\nCity by Rank Population Projected Rank % Unrounded Error\nMoscow 12.38 m 1\nSt. Petersburg 5.28 m 6.19 m 2 -17.23%\nNovosibirsk 1.60 m 4.13 m 3 -158.1%\nYekaterinburg 1.45 m 3.10 m 4 -106.9%\nNizhny Novgorod 1.26 m 2.48 m 5 -96.82%\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nGeorge Kingsley Zipf was a linguist and philologist, not a geographer. The principles of Zipf\u2019s equation can be applied to a variety of topics.\nAlso, the primate city distribution, where one city dominates all urban functions within a country, in a sense is the opposite of the rank-size\ndistribution, for it is the absence of one or more of the three cited criteria that typically lead to the primate city distribution, where one city\ntends to prevail in all urban ways.\nCheck Your Understanding\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Roman and Littlefield, Inc. CHAPTER 96\nRussian Domain: Overview\nIn the various essays about Russia in this textbook, there are many facts presented and many ways of life\nunderstood. After reading the textbook, students or other readers should know and understand many things\nabout Russia. Also, as has been stated, it is not the point of this textbook to attempt to convey every possible\nbit of knowledge about Russia. However, there are certain basic facts about Russia that the reader should know,\nwhether picked up in previous chapters or not.\nIn area, Russia is huge (map to left). Straddling the Eurasian landmass, Russia covers eleven time zones,\nstretching from the Baltic and Black Seas to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean. This is not a new\nphenomenon, for once the Russians passed the Ural Mountains into Siberia, there were few people to stop the\ntsars, the Cossacks, and others from expanding the empire to the eastern shores of Asia.\nBeing huge, Russia has vast quantities of natural resources. Oil and natural gas pipelines extend from western\nSiberia to a variety of European countries. Much of Russia\u2019s economy depends on resource exports. Russians are\nproud of their huge country and enjoy noting its singular features \u2013 Lake Baikal is the world\u2019s deepest lake, Siberia\nhas the world\u2019s largest coniferous forest, the Trans-Siberian Railway is the world\u2019s longest railroad, etc.\nPhysical Geography\nClimates and Landforms\n459 460 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nNorthern European Russia, northern Ukraine, and all of Belarus\nand Moldova are dominated by the humid continental climate,\nfeaturing short, warm, wet summers, and long, very cold winters.\nThis is similar to the climate of the U.S. Midwest and eastern and\ncentral Europe. This region\u2019s winters, however, can be far colder.\nMoscow, for example, is not only very far from the moderating\ninfluences of the Atlantic Ocean, it is also located at a very high\nlatitude. It is, in fact, nearly a thousand miles closer to the north\npole than Chicago. Being parallel to Canada, of course Russia will\nhave a relatively cold climate. With almost its entire coastline being\non the frigid Arctic Ocean, Russia receives little warming from the\nsea. Being cold, Russia\u2019s land often is inhospitable to sizeable\nCold in Northern Russia.\nhuman population. Indeed, Siberia averages about eight people\nCartography by Steve Wiertz\nper square mile. Although often cold, Russia is not simple one slab\nof ice. Being huge, Russia incorporates numerous landscape\nfeatures. Yet, the tundra is cold. Tundra (\u0442\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430) is land that is sufficiently cold so that even trees are uncommon\nor absent. In fact, the term tundra, meaning treeless, is a word taken from the language of the Sami peoples who\nare native to these far northern lands. In Russia the tundra extends across the length of the Arctic coastline from\nthe Kola Peninsula to the Bering Strait (Chapter 97), typically dipping 100-400 miles south of the northern\nocean. Siberia is the vast eastern section of Russia. It possesses a mixture of humid continental, subarctic and\narctic climates. Generally speaking, it is warmer in the south and colder in the north. But Siberia is best known for\nits temperature extremes. Buried deep in the world\u2019s largest landmass, Siberia possesses the world\u2019s ultimate\ncontinental climate. It is not uncommon for a Siberian city to reach temperatures in the 80s in the summertime,\nand then regularly reach 70 below in the depths of winter. One Siberian city, Verkhoyansk, has the distinction of\nhaving the greatest difference on earth between its record high temperature (+99\u02daF) and it record low (-90\u02daF).\nYou may recall the climate that dominates the much of the interior western United States is called a \u201csteppe\u201d\nclimate. That climate draws its name from the vast, treeless plain, or steppe (\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u044c), often present in southern\nEuropean Russia and southern Ukraine (and Kazakhstan). This region features warm summers and cold winters,\nbut is a semi-arid climate, with much less precipitation than the humid continental climate to its north. This\naccounts for the region\u2019s characteristic lack of trees.\nHowever, the dominant physical landscape of Russia is mainly\nconiferous forest, known there as taiga. Although the roots of the\nword \u0442\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430 are Turkic, this is a vast Russian landscape. This too\nstretches the length of the country from Karelia bordering Finland\nto the Sea of Okhotsk. In contrast to the tundra, taiga lunges fully\nsouthward, so that in central Siberia is reaches Russia\u2019s southern\nborder there with Mongolia. While much of these forests is\ncomprised of evergreen trees such as larch, there are some\ndeciduous species present. For instance, Russian birch trees often\nare seen as emblematic of Russian forests. A majority of the land\nof the world\u2019s largest country is taiga. There also are forests in\nwestern Russia; however, these show a much higher share of\nSable home. Photo by Tatiana Bulyankova on Flickr.\ndeciduous (broadleaf) trees than found in Siberia.\nAlthough the Soviet Union had considerable desert area in\nCentral Asia, by itself Russia has little desert or near-desert land, that being a small area along the borders with\nKazakhstan and the Caspian Sea.\nThe landform patterns of the European part of the Russian Domain are very simple. Nearly all of it \u2013 Russia, RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 461\nMoldova, Ukraine, and Belarus \u2013 is dominated by the North European Plain. It is quite similar to the Midwest;\nsometimes flat, sometimes gently rolling, but always at low elevations.\nThe only exceptions are found in western Ukraine, which includes part of the Carpathian Mountains, and in\nArmenia and Georgia, which are home to the Caucasus Mountains. The Caucasus region contains very high peaks\nthat run from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea.\nSiberia is bounded on the west by the Urals, a relatively low mountain range. The rest of Siberia is made up of\nfour major physical zones. The Western Siberian Plain is very flat and swampy. To the east is the Central Siberian\nPlateau, a hilly region of dissected plateaus. The southern and far eastern edges of Siberia are dominated by\nhighland areas, including the volcanic Kamchatka Peninsula. Finally, most of the northern rim of Siberia consists\nof the vast, flat Arctic Coastal Plain.\nBecause both Georgia and Armenia are very mountainous, and because they fall in the border region between\nmidlatitude and subtropical zones, the climate patterns of those two countries are incredibly complex. They\nfeature a mixture of Mediterranean, steppe, and humid subtropical climates, and contain hundreds of alpine\nmicroclimates. Generally speaking, both countries are generally drier in the west, and wetter in the east;\ntemperatures are warmer at low elevations, and cooler at high elevations.\nThe Soviet Union had significant mountainous areas in Central\nAsia and the Caucasus that again by itself Russia no longer holds.\nIn this case, though, Russia has other mountain ranges. The Ural\nMountains are somewhat similar to America\u2019s Appalachian\nMountains in low elevation, age, and raw material wealth. Some of\nthe mountains of the Caucasus region extend into Russia past the\ntrio of countries there \u2013 Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. This\nincludes Mt. Elbrus, the highest mountain of Russia at 18510 feet.\nIn Siberia, there are several mountain ranges. The Altai Mountains\ncross Russia\u2019s southeastern border with Kazakhstan, as the Sayan\nMountains do with China\u2019s western border with Russia. East of Lake\nMount Elbrus. Baikal are the Yablonoi Mountains which sit south of the Stanovoy\nPhoto by Konstantin Malanchev on Flickr. Range. Farther north and then east of the Lena River is the\nVerkhoyansk Range that lie west of the Kolyma Mountains that sit\nacross from the Kamchatka Peninsula (Chapter 92) and its volcanoes.\nThere are plenty of lakes in Russia, but by far the most\nnoteworthy are Lake Baikal and the Caspian Sea. Lake Baikal is the\nworld\u2019s oldest and deepest lake, filling a mile down between\nstretches of mountains. The Caspian Sea technically is a lake, for it\nfails to connect to the world\u2019s oceans, thus not meeting the\ngeographic standards to be a sea. While the Soviet Union held\nabout 3\/4 of the shoreline and thus waters of the Caspian Sea (the\nrest for Iran), now Russia\u2019s share is only about 1\/4. In terms of\nwaterways, the historic Volga River is crucial to western Russia, but\nis considerably smaller and shorter than Siberian streams that are\nnoted in Chapter 85. Lake Baikal.

This certainly is true, though the remote\nlocations of many of these resources has presented\nchallenges for the extraction and transportation of\nenergy and mineral wealth. Siberia is a treasure trove\nof energy sites \u2013 oil and natural gas (Chapter 83) \u2013 and\nmineral resources \u2013 nickel, gold, platinum and more.\nIn the 1930s Stalin had the city of Magnitogorsk\nLake Baikal Panorama. Photo by Sergey Pesterev on Flickr.\nconstructed to specialize in the extraction and\nprocessing of immense deposits of iron ore nearby.\nBordering Ukraine, the Kursk Magnetic Anamoly holds another huge supply of iron ore. The resource city of\nNorilsk is discussed in Chapter 88.\nHistorical Geography\nRussia\u2019s Land Empire\nIn the 1400s, Russia was a medium sized country situated on the North European Plain. At about the same time\nthat other European countries, such as Spain, Portugal, France, and Britain, began to build their empires, Russia\nstarted to build one of its own. The major difference is that, while those other European empires were maritime\nempires \u2013 built by naval power and involving overseas colonies \u2013 the Russian Empire was a land empire. Between\nthe 1500s and 1800s, Russia expanded across much of the eastern edge of the North European Plain, and then\nsouth and west across Asia. By the 1800s, Russia was Europe\u2019s largest country, both in terms of land area and\npopulation, and it possessed vast amounts of natural resources. Still, standards of living in Russia were extremely\nlow by European standards. Russia had not developed a thriving merchant class, as had many other European\ncountries, and it was barely industrialized. The country\u2019s wealth was largely in the hands of a small ruling class,\nwith the vast majority of the population being poor, rural peasants. This left it ripe for revolution.\nThe Soviet Union\nIn 1917, as Russia was suffering badly in World War I, Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown, and numerous factions\ncompeted for control of Russia. Soon thereafter, communist revolutionaries known as the Bolsheviks managed to\nseize power. Vladimir Lenin, the first leader of Communist Russia, died in 1924. His successor was Joseph Stalin.\nStalin would run the country until his death in 1953, and would largely responsible for shaping the modern version\nof communism, sometimes called Stalinism. The former Russian Empire adopted a new name \u2013 the Union of\nSoviet Socialist Republics \u2013 USSR (\u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a \u2013 CCCP). This Soviet Union with\na communist government reorganized the internal geography of Russia, dividing it into seven, then twelve, and\nlater fifteen, Soviet Socialist Republics.\nThis was largely a symbolic gesture. The country was administrated from Moscow, and the individual republics\nhad little genuine power. It was likely done to make the country\u2019s numerous non-Russian ethnic minorities feel\nlike equal partners in the process. It is notable that Stalin himself was not ethnically Russian, but Georgian. He was\nborn Ioseb Djugashvili (\u10d8\u10dd\u10e1\u10d4\u10d1 \u10e1\u10e2\u10d0\u10da\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8), and adopted the surname Stalin (which means \u201cMan of Steel\u201d) when he\ngot involved in politics.\nStalin\u2019s government developed the Soviet-style economy, in which the government seized control of all property\nand means of production. Everyone worked for the government, and everything was purchased from the\ngovernment. Government bureaucrats determined what was produced, where it was produced, and how much\nwas produced. They set all prices and wages.\nStalin\u2019s thirty-year reign is remembered as period of extraordinary advances and extreme brutality. As for his RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 463\nsuccesses, the material standard of living for Soviet citizens generally rose during Stalin\u2019s reign. The Soviet Union\ndeveloped effective research and education institutions. Industrial output skyrocketed. When Stalin assumed\npower, Russia was second-tier country in Europe, at best. When Stalin died, the Soviet Union was one of the world\u2019s\ntwo great superpowers.\nStalin\u2019s reign is also remembered for some substantial failures. First, the Soviet-style command economy would\neventually stall, and was the primary reason for the Soviet Union\u2019s ultimate collapse. Second, the Soviet Union\u2019s\nenvironmental policy was practically non-existent, and the post-Soviet region remains one of the most toxic\nenvironments in the world. But Stalin is perhaps best remembered for his ruthless accumulation of political\npower. He repressed all forms of opposition. He developed the infamous Soviet secret police, which spied on the\ncountry\u2019s citizens, often torturing and executing suspected dissidents. Large numbers of people were formally\nexecuted by Stalin\u2019s government. The \u201clucky\u201d ones were sent to gulags (prison work camps) in Siberia, where they\nwere likely to die within a few years. In all, Stalin\u2019s policies were responsible for the early deaths of millions of\nSoviet citizens. The exact number of excess deaths will never be known, but scholarly estimates range between\n20 and 60 million.\nThe Collapse of the Soviet Union\nIn the 1980s, few Americans believed that the Cold War would end anytime soon. The idea that it would end in\n1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union was almost unimaginable. In hindsight, though, it is clear that the Soviet\nUnion was experiencing a crisis for about a decade before it collapsed.\nThe beginning of the end came in Poland. Lech Walesa, an electrician working in a shipyard, formed a labor\nunion known as Solidarity, and its members began to demand economic and political reform. Labor unions were\nillegal in Poland, and throughout the communist bloc. Previous demands for reform in the satellite states had\nbeen crushed, but neither the Polish nor the Soviet government was able to control Solidarity, and the Polish\ngovernment was forced to give in to some of the workers\u2019 demands. This success reverberated throughout the\nSoviet bloc and, throughout the 1980s, demands for reform in the satellite states, and eventually the Soviet Union\nitself, became more and more persistent.\nThe most significant problem facing the Soviet Union was economic. In the end, the Soviet economic system\nproved unsustainable. By the 1980s, productivity was declining, and goods were becoming scarce. Many who lived\nin the Soviet Union in the 1980s remember spending hours in line to buy even the most basic consumer goods.\nAnother problem facing the Soviet government was Afghanistan. The Soviets had invaded Afghanistan in 1979\nto prop up an unpopular communist regime there. The Soviets did not expect their troops to be there for more\nthan a few months, and yet the war dragged on for ten years. This is largely because they encountered a highly 464 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nmotivated Islamist resistance movement, funded by the United States, known as the Mujahideen. (Unfortunately\nfor the United States, the Mujahideen would later be the genesis of both al-Qaeda and the Taliban, which the U.S.\nhas spent the last twenty years battling in Afghanistan and other countries).\nIt is an enormous overstatement to say that the war in Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union \u2013 the\neconomy did that \u2013 but the mounting casualties in that war severely drained the morale of Soviet citizens. It might\nbe described as the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\nIn 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became the new leader of the Soviet\nUnion, and he would be its last. Responding to growing social\nunrest, Gorbachev instituted two important reforms. The first was\nknown as perestroika. This involved the decentralization of\neconomic decision-making and the infusion of some market\nelements into the communist economy. The second was known as\nglasnost. This was the opening of public debate. For sixty years,\ncriticizing the government in the Soviet Union had been a deadly\nproposition. Now, Soviet citizens were free to speak their minds.\nMany scholars believe that if Gorbachev\u2019s reforms had come a\ndecade earlier, they may have saved the Soviet Union. But it was\ntoo late. The communist economy was beyond rescue, and the\nlong-silenced resentment of Soviet citizens boiled over into mass\nprotests.\nIn 1989, the satellite states were breaking free from Soviet\ncontrol. In 1990, leaders in the Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian\nRepublics were openly calling for independence from the Soviet\nUnion. In August, 1991, a brief, unsuccessful military coup sent the\nSoviet Union into chaos. On December 21st, representatives from\nthe Soviet Republics agreed to officially dissolve the union. On\nChristmas Day, 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned, declaring his\noffice \u201cextinct.\u201d That night, the Soviet flag was lowered from the\nGorbachev. Image by valeriy osipov on Flickr. Kremlin, and the Russian national flag was raised in its place. Again.\nto be clear, Russia is not and was not the same place as the Soviet\nUnion (USSR). Under the tsars, the Russian Empire expanded\ngreatly, especially across Siberia. The land area of the Russian Revolution that overthrew the Romanov dynasty\nwas roughly the same as the extent of the Soviet Union after World War II. Russia was by far the largest piece of\nthe Soviet Union, both in population and in area; however, there were numerous other pieces too. When the\nSoviet Union dissolved in 1991, Russia became an independent country, but the other fourteen republics of the\nUSSR did so as well. This geopolitical event distributed a lot of land and a large number of people from the USSR\ninto these new countries. So, Russia is huge in area and big in population, but it is smaller than the Soviet Union\nwas. During the decades of the Soviet Union and ever since then Russia has faced demographic challenges that\neventually resulted in Russia having several recent years of more deaths than births. Most population scholars\nanticipate that Russia\u2019s population will shrink in upcoming years and decades. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 465\nThe breakup of the Soviet Union led to great disruption within the fifteen successor States. Russia experienced\nconsiderable social, economic, and political turmoil. The country\u2019s eventual relative stability under the leadership\nof President Vladimir Putin is responsible for much of his popularity. Putin\u2019s emphasis on pushing Russia\u2019s\ninternational status and clout toward that of the Soviet Union also has been effective in boosting his appeal.\nRussia annexed Crimea from neighboring Ukraine in 2014 and continues to battle in eastern Ukraine.\nEven so, the chaos following the dissolution of the USSR led to great economic disparities and the development\nof the super-rich oligarch class (Chapter 90). Moscow ranks fourth in the world among cities with numbers of\nbillionaires. In 2019 Credit Suisse Bank in Switzerland ranked Russia as the world\u2019s most unequal economy with\nthe top 10% of people owning 83% of Russia wealth.\nRussia has inherited many elements of life from the Soviet days. The skewed sex ratio (Chapter 94), heavily\nfavoring numbers of women, is an artifact of male life expectancy in the late Soviet period. Considerable\nenvironmental pollution is a legacy of Soviet near total disregard for protecting the natural environment. The\nethnoterritorial system (Chapter 86) of managing a multinational State moved from the Soviet Union to the\ngoverning system of Russia. The autocratic leadership under Putin is a morphed inheritance of the authoritarian\nSoviet system, which in its harsh control was an altered version of tsarist autocratic rule.\nAlthough World War II is even further back in history than is the breakup of the Soviet Union, WWII still is\nnoteworthy for Russians. At a bare minimum there were twenty million deaths on the Soviet side. The Battle\nof Stalingrad caused 3.5 million Soviet deaths alone. While the Stalin era also cost millions of lives as caused by\nthe communist system, unlike the history of WWII, Stalinist history has not been taught well in Russian schools.\nIn fact, in a survey by the Levada-Center in 2019, when asked what role Stalin played in the history of Russia,\n70% of answering adults in Russia either said entirely positive or mostly positive. It should not be a surprise that\nPutin seems to secure the highest ratings of popularity when he emphasizes nationalism, even as far as annexing\nCrimea away from Ukraine.\nPolitical Geography\nDemocracy\nSometimes referred to as \u201cEurope\u2019s last remaining dictatorship,\u201d Belarus has the dubious distinction of being\nEurope\u2019s most authoritarian country. It is a nominal democracy, holding the occasional sham election, but it has\nbeen dominated by one political party since independence, and that party has suppressed, sometimes violently,\nall criticism and opposition. Following evidence of fraud in the August 2020 re-election of President Lukashenko,\nunprecedented protests have broken out in Belarus, including those of 100,000 people in the capital city Minsk.\nUkraine, Moldova, Georgia, and Armenia are best-labeled as \u201cpartial democracies.\u201d All have held multi-party 466 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nelections in recent years. But they\u2019ve also had recent histories of political violence and rampant corruption. For\nmany years, Russia has also been described as a partial democracy. It does have democratic institutions and\nelections. Increasingly, though, calling Russia even a \u201cpartial\u201d democracy is a bit of stretch. The country has been\nruled by Vladimir Putin for two decades, and his United Russia party has such a large majority in parliament that\nPutin can effectively rule by decree. Remember reading about Putin in Chapter 93. Throughout Putin\u2019s time in\noffice, democracy has eroded in Russia. Elections have become suspect, and scores of key opposition leaders have\nbeen jailed or murdered. Crackdowns on the press have effectively silenced most public criticism of Putin.\nPutin and Russian Re-Expansion\nWhen the Russian-dominated Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, not only did Russia lose control of its numerous\nsatellite states in eastern Europe, but it also lost control of significant swaths of territory that had long been part\nof the Russian Empire. Fourteen independent countries now occupied more than two million squares of former\nRussian territory. Since Vladimir Putin ascended to the Russian presidency in 2000, he has developed a geopolitical\nstrategy to reassert Russian control over territory it lost nine years before.\nBefore he could do that, however, Putin had to guarantee that\nRussia didn\u2019t lose any additional territory. About 29 million people\n\u2013 20% of Russia\u2019s population \u2013 are not ethnically Russian. So far,\nonly one non-Russian group has made a serious attempt at\nindependence. Chechnya, a small enclave in the Caucasus\nmountains is home to the Chechens, an ethnic minority numbering\nabout a million. In 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union,\nChechnya declared independence from Russia, and remained a de\nfacto independent state for nearly a decade. When Vladimir Putin\ncame to power, one of his first acts was to unleash a furious\nmilitary assault on Chechnya, effectively ending that country\u2019s\nindependence. Defeating the Chechen rebels accomplished a few\nimportant geopolitical goals for Russia. First, it reasserted Russian\nHaja Aymani Kadyrova Mosque in Argun, Chechnya.\ncontrol over the strategically important Caucasus region, which\nPhoto by Clay Gilliland on Flickr.\nwe\u2019ll discuss in a bit. Second, it helped protect vital routes for\npipelines carrying oil from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea. Third,\nand most important, it sent a signal to all other potential separatist regions in Russia that the Putin government\nwould not tolerate the further loss of Russian territory.\nOne of Putin\u2019s primary goals outside of Russia\u2019s borders has been to aggressively contain the expansion of NATO\nand the European Union. From the Russian viewpoint, NATO is a club full of traditional Russian enemies, notably\nGermany, Turkey, Britain, France, and the United States. Many Soviet leaders were convinced that NATO\u2019s ultimate\ngoal was an invasion of the Soviet Union.\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, many wondered if NATO would be dissolved. It was decided, however, that it\ncould serve as a vital peacekeeping force for Europe, and many countries were interested in maintaining a close\nmilitary alliance with the United States. Among them were eastern European countries looking to the United States\nfor protection from Russian re-expansion. By 2004, NATO included all of the Soviet Union\u2019s former satellite states,\nand three former members of the Soviet Union itself \u2013 Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.\nThis eastward expansion of NATO was scarcely noticed by most Americans, but it caused alarm in Russia. In\n1989, the closest NATO military base to St. Petersburg was a thousand miles away in West Germany. Twenty years\nlater, it was only seventy miles away, in Estonia. Many Russians see NATO\u2019s expansion as, at best, an attempt to\nmarginalize Russia and, at worst, a prelude to an invasion of Russia.\nThe European Union is also viewed by Russia as an existential threat. A unified Europe, which would form the RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 467\nworld\u2019s largest economy and a contain a population of more than a half-billion people, further threatened to\nmarginalize Russia as it expanded into Russia\u2019s traditional economic domain. Like NATO, the EU would eventually\ninclude all of the former eastern satellite states and the Baltic states.\nTo make matters worse for Russia, the EU invited a few other former Soviet republics to join the Eastern Partners\nProgram. This program would not constitute full membership in the EU, but it would create a free trade zone that\nencouraged these countries to trade more with the EU and, more than likely, trade less with Russia.\nSince coming to power, Putin has launched an aggressive campaign to contain and destabilize NATO and the\nEuropean Union. Russia combated the Eastern Partners Program by threatening potential members. One example\nwas Moldova. When Moldova announced plans to join the program, Russia immediately banned the sale of\nMoldovan wine and produce in Russia, which had been Moldova\u2019s largest market. Although it was cited as a food\nsafety measure, it was clearly punishment for Moldova aligning with the EU.\nAnother example of a Russian attempt to undermine the European Union can be found in Syria. That country\ndevolved into a civil war in 2011. It turned into a complex multi-front conflict. Most EU countries, along with the\nUnited States, backed moderate rebels opposed to the government of Bashar al-Assad. At first, Russia gave only\nmodest support to Assad. As refugees began to pour out of Syria and into Europe, the influx created disputes\namong EU members about how to handle the tide of migrants. Realizing that this was such a divisive issue, Putin\nstepped up an aerial bombing campaign in Syria. The more bombs Russia dropped on Syria, the more refugees\ndeparted for Europe, and the greater the discord among EU members.\nA final example of Russian attempts to undermine NATO and the EU can be found in its covert efforts to help\nbring anti-NATO and anti-EU politicians and political parties to power in Europe and the United States. Russian\nagents have used both financial resources and, more effectively, a mass campaign to spread information (and, just\nas often, disinformation) on social media that promotes such political parties. Many of them are nationalist parties\nthat deeply oppose European integration, and Russia\u2019s media campaign has promoted them by spreading anti-\nimmigrant propaganda. Russia\u2019s greatest successes in this regard might be Brexit and the election of President\nDonald Trump. While neither of these events were entirely the result of Russian influence, Russian meddling\ndefinitely played a significant role in both. President Trump has repeatedly questioned America\u2019s commitment to\nNATO, occasionally speculating about the U.S. leaving the military alliance entirely (which would be a massive coup\nfor Russia). As president, Trump has had a much friendlier relationship with Putin than with the leaders of the\nEuropean Union. Brexit is even more significant. Britain was one of the EU\u2019s largest economies, and its departure\nwill certainly weaken the bloc.\nAnother Putin priority is reasserting Russian control over the Caucasus Mountains. Acquired in the 1800s, the\nCaucasus were prized by Russia as a natural wall protecting it from invasion from southwest Asia. In 1991, when 468 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nGeorge, Armenia, and Azerbaijan gained their independence, Russia lost control of much of the Caucasus region.\nOne example of Russia\u2019s efforts to control the Caucasus was the Chechen War, discussed above. Another was the\n2008 conflict with Georgia. Remember reading about Georgia in Chapter 86.\nPerhaps Putin\u2019s greatest priority is to increase Russia\u2019s influence in all the countries that used to be part of\nthe Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. One way he has done this is through economic incentives. The most\nsignificant is the Eurasian Union, a Russian-dominated economic alternative to the European Union. Like the\nEuropean Union, the Eurasian Union is built on the promise of free trade, the free movement of labor, and a\nunified currency. In 2000, Putin called upon all former Soviet Republics to join the union. Putin made it clear\nthat he was not trying to reassemble the Soviet Union, although that is, of course, precisely what he is trying\nto do. Membership is tempting for some former Soviet republics \u2013 it provides these relatively small countries\naccess to the large Russian market and billions of dollars in Russian investments. Membership is also troubling\nfor some of these countries. Finally independent after years of Russian rule, joining the union strikes some as a\nloss of sovereignty. So far, only four former Soviet republics have joined the Eurasian Union: Belarus, Kazakhstan,\nArmenia, and Kyrgyzstan.\nAnother way to increase Russian influence in former Soviet republics is through economic coercion. Russia is the\nlargest trading partner of most of the former Soviet republics, and it has the ability to launch punitive economic\nmeasures against these countries if they \u201cmisbehave.\u201d Perhaps Russia\u2019s greatest advantage over these countries\nis energy. Nearly all of them get most of their oil and natural gas from Russian pipelines, giving Russia the ability\nto cripple their economies by shutting off their access to these resources.\nRussia can also increase its influence over former Soviet republics by empowering the Russian minorities\nthat live there. This is especially true of four countries where ethnic Russians make up significant portions of\nthe population. Russians account for about 25% of the population in both Latvia and Estonia, about 20% of\nKazakhstan\u2019s population, and about 17% of Ukraine\u2019s population. These Russians are, of course, likely to support\npolitical parties that are pro-Russian, and Russia can further empower them by striking favorable business\ncontracts with them.\nA final way that Russia can increase its influence over former Soviet Republics is the most blunt \u2013 through\nmilitary force, as done in Ukraine. The political situation in Ukraine is complex, but, put simply, the biggest political\ndilemma for that country since 1991 has been its orientation toward, or away from, Russia. Pro-western political\nparties in Ukraine want the country to orient itself toward the west, by doing such things as joining NATO and the\nEuropean Union. Pro-Russian political parties in Ukraine want to maintain close economic and political ties with\nMoscow. These feuding political blocs have traded power multiple times in Ukraine. Ethnic Russians, concentrated RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 469\nin eastern and southern Ukraine tend to, of course, support pro-Russian candidates. Ethnic Ukrainians, who make\nup the majority of the population are divided. Many are ardently anti-Russian. Others view close ties with Russia\nas being pragmatic.\nIn 2010, a pro-Russian government was narrowly elected. Accusations of corruption against this government\nfueled mounting protests that, by 2014, had escalated into a full-scale revolution. Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-\nRussian president, was forced to flee the country, and a pro-western government was installed.\nThe Russian government, and many Russians living in Ukraine, considered this to be an illegal coup. This\nresulted in two major military actions. The first was Russia\u2019s seizure of Crimea, a peninsula in southeastern\nUkraine (as included in the outline map above). Crimea has long been demographically dominated by ethnic\nRussians, and it is of tremendous military and economic significance, given its position on the Black Sea. In a\nhastily called 2014 referendum, voters in Crimea chose to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. The peninsula was\nimmediately occupied by thousands of armed Russian \u201cvolunteers.\u201d Their uniforms carried no insignia patches\nand their vehicles were unmarked, but they were clearly members of the Russian military, ordered by Putin to\nseize Crimea.\nThe international community largely condemned this action, and few countries recognize Russia\u2019s territorial\nclaims in Crimea. A second military action that began in 2014 was a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine. In\nthis overwhelmingly Russian area of Ukraine, conflict has erupted sporadically over the last six years between the\nUkrainian military and separatists who would like Ukraine\u2019s far east to secede and join Russia. Unlike the military\naction in Crimea, these separatists actually do appear to be \u201cvolunteer\u201d revolutionaries, although there is much\nevidence that they are being supported with military aid from Russia.\nEconomic Geography\nDevelopment\nCompared to much of the rest of the world, the Russian Doman is a relatively wealthy region. Compared to\nEuropean Union, however, it is not. Russia\u2019s HDI rates its standard of living above only two members of the\nEU\u2014Romanian and Bulgaria. The remaining Russian Domain countries\u2014Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and\nMoldova\u2014have an HDI that ranks below all countries in the EU.\nThe Soviet Economy\nFrom the time of the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian\nDomain was guided by communist economic ideals. A communist economy is sometimes also called a \u201ccommand\neconomy.\u201d To get a sense of communism, it is handy to compare it to capitalism, which is sometimes called a \u201cfree\nmarket\u201d economy.\nThink about our College of DuPage. It is a community college. So, who owns the college? The community does.\nWe all own it. Since the government is the representative of the people, it administers the college for us. In a\ncapitalist economy, many things \u2013 colleges, libraries, parks, military bases, highways \u2013 are community property,\nowned by all of us, and administered by the government.\nIn a capitalist economy, however, most property is private property, owned by individuals or corporations.\nBusinesses, farms, residences, factories, office buildings, and the like, are usually private enterprises. You have\nyour house, I have mine. You have your business, I have mine.\nIn a communist economy, everything is owned by everyone. Not just colleges, libraries, and parks, etc., but\neverything. Steel mills, factories, farms, department stores, barber shops, grocery stores, tea shops, pharmacies,\napartment buildings, gas stations, mines, office buildings, and everything else, is owned by everyone. That\u2019s what\ncommunism refers to. Everything is communally owned. And since the government (theoretically) represents the\npeople, the government administers everything.\nA capitalist economy is effectively governed by the forces of supply and demand. If enough people want\n(demand) something, a company will supply it. If it\u2019s in high demand, more will be produced. If it\u2019s in low demand, 470 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nless will be produced. Supply and demand also govern wages. If your skills are in high demand, you\u2019ll likely\nearn higher wages. If your skills are in low demand, you\u2019ll likely earn lower wages. The same is true of prices. If\nsomething is scarce, the price will go up. If something is plentiful, the price will go down. Of course, governments\ndo a lot of things that effect the economy \u2013 taxes, spending, infrastructure, as well as labor, environmental, trade,\nand financial regulations \u2013 but largely the economy is driven by the forces of supply and demand in the free\nmarket.\nA communist economy is not governed by the forces of supply and demand. It\u2019s controlled entirely by the\ngovernment (hence the term \u201ccommand economy\u201d). Production is dictated by government bureaucrats, who\ndetermine what is produced, how much is produced, and where it\u2019s produced. Since everyone works for the\ngovernment, the government determines all wages. And since everything is owned by the government, the\ngovernment determines all prices.\nThink back to Chapter 56, where we analyzed communism vs. capitalism.\nRussia\u2019s Economic Shock Therapy\nRussia made its transition from communism to capitalism practically overnight. Dubbed \u201ceconomic shock\ntherapy\u201d by the first post-Soviet president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, this move proved disastrous.\nRussia began to sell off many of its state-owned assets to private companies and individuals, many at secretive\n\u201cmidnight auctions\u201d orchestrated by corrupt officials. This enabled a handful of people to gobble up huge chunks\nof the Russian economy, forming the \u201coligarch\u201d class \u2013 a small group of extremely wealthy people. Central planning\nwas lifted \u2013 all production, wages, and prices were left to the whims of the free market.\nImmediately, unemployment skyrocketed. To boost efficiency, the newly privatized companies of Russia began\nlaying workers off by the millions. Because the government no longer oversaw every element of the economy and\nsociety, millions of government employees were laid off as well. Worse, inflation rates \u2013 an index of the average\ncost of living \u2013 exploded upward.\nConsumer goods were always scarce in the Soviet Union. Prices, however, were controlled by the government.\nSo, even if you had to wait weeks to obtain something, it would still be affordable once you got it. With price\ncontrols lifted, the law of supply and demand took over. When the supply of something was scarce, the price shot\nupward.\nTo make matters worse, Russia had moved to a private economy before developing a coherent tax collection\nsystem. The communist system hadn\u2019t had taxes, since everything was already owned by the government. The\nRussian government was suddenly unable to pay its bills. So, to make up the difference, the Russian government\nbegan printing more money. Unfortunately, money operates according to the same laws of economics as\neverything else. If the supply goes up, the value goes down. By overprinting money, the Russian government\ndestroyed the value of its currency.\nAs a result, everything became much more expensive just as money was becoming worthless. Russia\u2019s annual\ninflation rate in 1992 was 2509%, a disastrous number. (In the United States, an annual inflation rate above 5% is\nconsidered unhealthy). Russians were digging into many years\u2019 worth of savings to buy a week\u2019s worth of groceries.\nThe 1990s were generally disastrous for Russia, and for many of the other countries in the Russian Domain.\nGross domestic product (GDP) declined by 50% over the course of the decade. For comparison, the United States\u2019\nGDP declined by about 25% during the Great Depression.\nEven so, the chaos following the dissolution of the USSR led to great economic disparities and the development\nof the super-rich oligarch class (Chapter 90). Moscow ranks fourth in the world among cities with numbers of\nbillionaires. In 2019 Credit Suisse Bank in Switzerland ranked Russia as the world\u2019s most unequal economy with\nthe top 10% of people owning 83% of Russia wealth.\nRussia\u2019s Economic Recovery and Subsequent Recession\nIn the 2000s, the Russian economy entered a period of recovery. Average incomes grew by about 10% annually, RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 471\nand unemployment and poverty rates declined. The main source of economic growth was energy. Russia\npossesses 6% of the world\u2019s oil, and 27% of its natural gas. Once mechanisms were in place to export these\ncommodities to areas outside of the old Soviet bloc, energy revenues climbed. Energy currently accounts for about\n67% of Russia\u2019s export earnings.\nThe problem with the energy industry is that it is not particularly labor intensive. It generates enormous wealth\nfor stakeholders in the industry, and plenty of \u201cecho\u201d jobs in sectors like consumer services, real estate, and\nfinance. But this new economy hasn\u2019t expanded a lot of traditionally middle-class occupations, like manufacturing.\nIt also makes Russia very vulnerable to the whims of an unstable market.\nIn 2015, Russia\u2019s economy experienced a significant downturn, and has not fully recovered. While the situation\nis still a far cry from the economic disasters of the 1990s, it\u2019s also perhaps a sign that the rapid growth of the 2000s\nmight not be sustainable.\nEconomic sanctions placed on Russia by many western countries as punishment for its actions in Syria and\nUkraine are partly to blame, but downward trends in the Russian economy appear to be tied mostly to downward\ntrends in the price of oil. When oil prices go up, Russia does well. When they sink, Russia is in trouble. In April\nof 2011, the price for a barrel of oil was $116, and the Russian economy was soaring. By January of 2016, it had\nplummeted to $34 per barrel, and the Russian economy was in recession. By October of 2018, oil had inched back\nup to $71 per barrel, and the Russian economy showed some improvement. In 2020, a price war with Saudi Arabia,\ncoupled with the coronavirus pandemic, sent oil all the way back down to $28 per barrel. This is likely to have\nsevere repercussions for the Russian economy.\nCultural Geography\nAn interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Recall\nreading about the Russian Orthodox Church in Chapter 89. Most Armenians identify with the Armenian Apostolic\nChurch, a separate branch of Christianity that predates both the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches.\nIslam is the largest minority religion in the region, particularly in Russia (where about 15% of the population is\nMuslim), and Georgia (10% Muslim). Although religious identity remains important in the Russian Domain, active\nparticipation in religion has declined. For example, about 80% of Russians identify as Christian, but only 15%\nregularly participate in worship services.\nLanguage\nMost people of the Russian Domain speak Indo-European languages. Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian are\nSlavic languages. Moldovan is a Romance language, and is mutually intelligible with Romanian. Armenian is the\nonly member of its subfamily of the Indo-European family. A significant minority in the Russian Domain speak\nlanguages form the Turkic language family, particularly those who live in the Caucasus Mountains and in Siberia.\nA third language family is found in Georgia. The Kartvelian language family includes Georgian, and three small\nrelated languages, found mainly in the Caucasus region.\nEthnicity\nAll of the countries of the Russian Doman are dominated by their nominal nationality. Armenia is the most\nhomogenous, with 98% of the country being Armenian. Other countries are slightly less homogeneous\u2013 Georgia\n(87%), Belarus (84%), Ukraine (78%), Moldova (78%). Russia is 78% Russian, but has dozens of smaller ethnic\ngroups across its vast land, making it a multinational state.\nMany of the ethnic minorities in this region come from other nations of the Russian Domain. Russians are a\nsignificant minority in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova, as are Armenians in Georgia, Ukrainians in Moldova and\nRussia, and Belarusians and Moldovans in Ukraine. There are also some minorities from the former Soviet bloc in\neastern Europe, like Romanians and Bulgarians in Moldova, and Poles in Belarus.\nOther major ethnic minorities include Kurds, Azeris, Tatars, Gagauz, Bashkir, Chuvash, and Chechens. These\ngroups are among the many whose homelands were absorbed as the Russian Empire expanded. Russia officially\nrecognizes 160 different minority groups within its borders. Some of these groups are Christian, and some Muslim.\nSome are Turkic, historically related to the Turks and the peoples of Central Asian nations like Kazakhstan and\nUzbekistan.\nPopulation Geography\nThe Russian Doman has a total population of 211 million, with Russia (147 million) accounting for 70% of that\npopulation. Ukraine (43 million) accounts for another 20%. The remaining four countries collectively account for\nabout 10%, including Belarus (10 million), Moldova (9 million), Georgia (4 million), and Armenia (3 million).\nLike Europe, all of the countries of the Russian Domain have TFRs well below replacement rate. The countries of\nthe Russian Doman are far into the Demographic Transition, generally with more deaths than births and featuring\nwell-educated, highly urbanized populations. Additionally, the somewhat dim economic prospects for many has\nfurther discouraged people from starting families. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: OVERVIEW 473\nRussians comprise a remarkable nation, locked into a huge and often cold land, governed by autocratic\nleadership. For this textbook, we are counting Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, and perhaps Moldova in a\nregion to be called the Russian Domain. The peoples of Ukraine and Belarus are mainly Slavic, sharing ethnic\nand linguistic characteristics with Russians. The lands of Ukraine and Belarus border western Russia and not\nsurprisingly share similar landscape features of forests and the North European Plain. These several lands that\nnow are the countries listed here share historical links with Russia, territorial occupation and conquest both in the\ntsarist era and during the Soviet Union. The Russian Domain is mapped to the left.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe steppe eagle breeds in Siberia and Kazakhstan.

CHAPTER 97\nRussian Domain:\nPhysical Geography III\nBering Strait\nBy geographic definition, a strait is a narrow passage of water\nthat separates two large landmasses. The Bering Strait meets this\ndefinition, for it is a stretch of water about 58 miles across,\nseparating Cape Prince of Wales, the westernmost point of Alaska\n(USA), from Cape Dezhnev, the easternmost point of the Far East\nregion of Russia.\nThe features of the broader region near the Bering Strait can be\nremembered with the acronym CRIPPLE, perhaps appropriate\ngiven the difficulties of life there.\nC \u2013 Caribou\nFew people chose to live in this extreme location of the Russian\nFar East. Historical patterns of in-migration of Russians into\nBering Strait. NASA. Public Domain.\nSiberian locations have made Russians the majority population.\nHowever, the ethnic natives in the region, among the so-called\n\u201cnumerically small peoples\u201d of Russian\/Soviet censuses, remain the few who practice outdoorsmen habits in the\nBering Strait region. The most numerous here are the Chukchi, whose name is derived from the term for \u201crich in\nreindeer.\u201d Indeed, caribou herding remains a way of life, sometimes supplemented by fish from the cold coastal\nwaters.\nR \u2013 Resources\nAs is true with Siberia and the Far East in general, the Bering Strait region possesses a variety of resources, such\nas tin, lead, zinc, gold, and coal in the Chukchi Peninsula. The challenging climate and landscape causes great\ndifficulties in extracting and transporting these resources, prompting high wages for those willing to work with\nthese resources.\nI \u2013 Isolation\nIn terms of different measures of isolation, the Russian shores along the Bering Strait may be the world\u2019s most\nisolated continental location.\nAccessibility right at the Bering Strait is limited to tiny coastal locations of Uelen and Provideniya. Farther down\nthe coast is the town of Anadyr (about 15,800 people) which provides port and airport service.\n475 476 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nPopulation density in the region is exceedingly sparse, fewer than one person per square mile for rural areas.\nDistance to large cities measures in the hundreds and even thousands of miles.\nP \u2013 Prison Camps\nIn Tsarist and more so in Soviet times, Siberia was a notorious location for the exiling of criminals and\npolitical prisoners. Soviet prison camps went almost to the waters of the Bering Strait itself. Of course, isolation\noften is considered desirable for prisons. In addition, prison labor here contributed to resource extraction and\ntransportation construction, without regard for the miserable conditions.\nP \u2013 Permafrost\nNearly half of the Russian landmass is permafrost, permanently frozen soil. Far northern locations like the\nBering Strait region uniformly have permafrost. Even the warming effects of the sea do little to reduce the frigid\nconditions of the region. Short summers and winters reaching \u201340\u00b0F chill this tundra region. Wind chill in nearby\nAnadyr has reached \u201390\u00b0F.\nL \u2013 Land Bridge\nAnthropologists tell us that during the world\u2019s last ice age, which\npeaked at about 18,000 BC, native peoples from Siberia and the Far\nEast crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska. Within this time frame\nlower water levels in the Bering Strait likely would have exposed the\ncontinental shelf, so that people could have crossed on land or ice\nbridges. These peoples became the ancestors of the native\npeoples of North and South America.\nThere has long been interest in recreating this bridge, but now in\nterms of a transportation link between America and Russia. In\n1890, William Gilpin, the Governor of Colorado, suggested a grand\nplan to connect all the great cities of the world by means of\nrailroads. Thus, the idea was tossed around in the early days of the\n20thcentury; however, disinterest and opposition from American\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt and from the Russian ruling elite\nslowed enthusiasm greatly.\nA railroad bridge? A rail tunnel? Both? With conduits for oil and\nnatural gas? These ideas popped up now and then throughout the\n20thcentury. Currently, some experts continue to devise\nplans. The InterContinental Railway group has a plan that would\ncost over $100 billion. It would include a tunnel beneath the Bering\nStrait, reaching more than 160 feet deep. With this seventy-mile\nlong tunnel, railroad tracks would be added to reach from Yakutsk,\nUSGS. Public Domain.\nRussia, to Fort Nelson, Canada. These rail sites already connect to\ntracks throughout Russia and all across Canada and the United\nStates.\nSee map and plan at: https:\/\/static1.squarespace.com\/static\/58b72801e3df2821397e13cb\/t\/\n5b92012670a6adc1daab0d65\/1536295261952\/ICR_WTC_mid-res.pdf\nE \u2013 Exploration\nRussian settlement reached Anadyr in 1649, with the exploration of Russian navigator Semyon Dezhnev. In\n1725 Tsar Peter the Great sent Vitus Bering to captain a navel expedition to chart Siberia\u2019s northern shores.\nThough it took Bering 3000 miles and three years of sailing to reach the region, he did found no land bridge to\nAlaska, but did chart Russian coastline and did discover that Siberia extended farther eastward than previously\nunderstood. RUSSIAN DOMAIN: PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY III 477\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nThe International Dateline runs through the Bering Strait.\nVitus Bering was a Dane who was recruited as a young man in 1704 to join the new Russian Navy. In 1741 on another expedition to the strait\nnow bearing his name, he was shipwrecked by stormy weather and died on the small island that also bears his name, Bering Island, just east\nof the Kamchatka Peninsula.\n\u201cBering Strait\u201d was the name of a popular music group, consisting of several young classically trained Russian musicians who grew enamored\nwith American bluegrass music and emigrated to the United States to find a few years of success with their country, bluegrass, and pop tunes.\nHowever, these Russian musicians are not from the Bering Strait region, but are from Obninsk, near Moscow.\nFor a quick look at how far a rail line across the Bering Strait could go, look at: https:\/\/i.redd.it\/x4dl2058q2651.png\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nDeGeorge, Krestia. 2019. \u201cIs the World Ready for a Bering Strait Rail Link between Alaska and Russia?\u201d ArcticToday.\nApril 1, 2019. https:\/\/www.arctictoday.com\/is-the-world-ready-for-a-bering-strait-rail-link-between-alaska-and-\nrussia\/?wallit_nosession=1.\nHumber, Yuriiy, and Bradley Cook. 2007. \u201cLongest Tunnel to Connect Russia and Alaska.\u201d Red Orbit, April.\nhttp:\/\/www.redorbit.com\/news\/science\/906923\/longest_tunnel_to_connect_russia_and_alaska\/index.html.\n\u201cR\/MapPorn \u2013 A Europe\u2013U.S. Superhighway Proposed by the Former President of Russian Railways.\u201d 2020.

CHAPTER 98\nNorth America:\nCultural Geography III\nCanadian Culture and America\nJOEL QUAM AND PETER MESERVE\nIn Chapter 3, we state that the term culture refers to collective,\nlearned human behavior. Indeed, culture essentially is the way of life of a group of people. The major core\ncomponents of culture are language, religion, and ethnicity, but culture also includes social relations, political\nsystems, economic activities, and more. As a result, Canadian culture is often generalized in textbooks as English-\nspeaking (with French dominant in Quebec), Christian (mostly Catholic and Protestant), with a parliamentary\nsystem, and a mostly service-based economy. However, this is a short list, yet a very broad summary. A similarly\nincomplete parallel would be characterizing the United States simply as English-speaking, Christian, democratic,\nand economically service-based. Therefore, let\u2019s go beyond a cursory summary to examine a few geographic\naspects of Canada\u2019s culture in relation to the United States.\nAs defined here or elsewhere, ethnicity is strongly related to culture, but the basis of ethnicity is belonging to a\ngroup, sharing its culture or sub-culture, and identifying with it. Members of large populations may share many\naspects of culture, but smaller groups within the whole will have different histories and ancestries (e.g., migrants)\nand therefore claim a more specific identity.\nth\nCanada has a population of nearly 38 million people, placing it 38 among countries of the world, according to\n478 NORTH AMERICA: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY III 479\nwww.worldometer.info. Canada is very slightly behind Poland in these numbers. Poland is the size of New Mexico\nin area and is 98% Polish in ethnicity.\nIn contrast to Poland, Canada has roughly the area of the whole United States. Unlike Poland, but similar to\nthe United States, Canada features many ethnic groups. Some ethnicities there connect with the original French\nand British colonists and with later migrations of European peoples. Others are native peoples \u2013 Inuits and First\nNations. There are smaller distinctive ethnic migrant groups like the Doukhobors (from Russia). Statistics Canada\nnow recognizes over 250 ethnic groups across the country. Whereas we might be able to summarize the 38 million\npeople of Poland into a somewhat cohesive group, it is difficult to do that for Canada.\nWith a land area the size of the United States that stretches from\nthe Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean as does the USA, Canada\nfeatures a diverse set of physical landscapes. Naturally, these\nlandscapes affect the socioeconomic elements of those locations.\nSaying that Canadians are sort of like Americans is a very broad\nstatement about both populations. It will be occasionally correct,\nbut often incorrect. Instead, it is safer to contend that people of\nBritish Columbia are similar to the people of Washington state.\nThese are adjacent regions with similar climates. Asian populations\ntally as the largest minority populations in both regions. Also, Nova\nScotia or New Brunswick may be compared to Maine as\nneighboring regions \u2013 small, forested, coastal lands each with\nmodest populations somewhat near one million people.\nCanmore, Alberta, Canada. Photo by Devon\nHawkins on Unsplash. 480 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nHere are three key factors that bring Americans and Canadians together. One, geographically, ninety percent\nof Canadians live within 150 miles of the border with the United States. As we know from Tobler\u2019s First Law\nof Geography \u2013 \u201cEverything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things,\u201d\ncertainly there will be characteristics that Canadians share with Americans and there will be ways that the two\ncountries interact. One example can be seen in this striking map of British Columbia \u2013 https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/\nMapPorn\/comments\/i6ser7\/british_columbia_split_into_3_areas_of_equal\/\nTwo, these connections are aided by the longest international land border in the world. Furthermore, the border\nis a friendly border with few and minor conflicts. Length and cooperation make it easy for trade and travel\nbetween the two countries. In fact, the United States exports more goods (measured by $) to Canada than it does\nto any other country in the world. Over half of Canada\u2019s exports go to the USA. The United States provides 80% of\nall foreign visitors to Canada, while Canadians are over 25% of travelers visiting America \u2013 that ranks #1 also.\nThree, both official languages of Canada are dialects of Europe-based languages. Most importantly for the\nAmerican connection, over 85% of Canadians speak English. Canadian French (called joual in Quebec) developed\nfrom 1760\u2019s French (after which the British conquered Canada) and has different pronunciations, contractions, NORTH AMERICA: CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY III 481\nand English loanwords (e.g., ski-doo) than Parisian French does. Canadian English is sometimes spelled like British\nEnglish, sometimes like American English; the same holds true for pronunciation and vocabulary, although there\nare also \u201cCanadianisms.\u201d For example, Canadians use British words such as loo and porridge; American words\nsuch as TV and gas; and their own words such as toques \u2013 particular knitted winter caps, loonies \u2013 dollar coins that\nhave a loon pictured on one side, and ridings \u2013 electoral districts.\nThus, it is not surprising that America and Canada share many interests, while having their own differences.\nNow on the very broad topic of popular culture, let\u2019s make three more observations.\nGeography clearly has influenced sports in Canada. Hockey makes\nsense in a cold outdoorsy setting. Canadian James Creighton is considered as the father of indoor hockey,\norganizing an official match indoors in 1875. By law, the country has two declared national sports: ice hockey in\nwinter and lacrosse in summer. Canada has its own variation of American football. The Toronto Raptors won the\n2019 NBA championship. Curling is less well known, but along with ice-skating is part of Canada\u2019s winter sports\nculture.\nCanadian television and radio are supported by the government. In part, the Canadian Radio-television and\nTelecommunications Commission (CRTC) ensures Canadian content, but still there is tremendous overlap with\nAmerican popular TV. The streaming content of the contemporary world crosses borders easily, so that American\nshows are seen in Canada, while Canadian series may be viewed in America. Toronto and Vancouver are vibrant\nsites for movie and television production and filming. Canadian actors and actresses are common in the US, often\nto the ignorance of American viewers who perceive the performers as being American. 482 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nA particularly geographic show on Canadian television was \u201cThe\nBorder,\u201d which highlighted international issues. Of course, the\nshow (CBC, 2008-2010) referred to the USA-Canada border; thus,\nplots often presented contrasting American and Canadian\nviewpoints and strategies. Naturally, the show featured a Canadian\ncast, though a Homeland Security agent liaising with Canadian\nauthorities was played by American actress Sofia Milos. \u201cThe\nBorder\u201d can be streamed free on Amazon Prime.\nAmericans in Canada will not find huge differences in cuisine; yet,\nsome foods are distinctly Canadian. In 2013, The Huffington Post \u2013\nCanada listed poutine (French fries slathered in gravy and cheese\ncurds) first in its article on fifty of the most Canadian foods.\nGlobe and Mail\nnewspaper\u2019s\nrestaurant critic\nDan Clapson states,\n\u201cOur country\u2019s most\niconic dish\ninternationally is, by\nActress Sofia Milos. far, the poutine.\u201d\nDrawing by Michelle Delecki.\nHowever, poutine\nin Canada is not\nPoutine. Photo by Traci on Flickr.\ndished up in a geographically even manner, as the food is more\ncommon in eastern regions. Having originated in Quebec province,\npoutine is an element of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture, so that its spatial diffusion has occurred from that eastern Canadian\nregion.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nCanadians are nicer than Americans. Well, at least on Twitter, a research study suggests. Geotagged tweets were compiled to create word\nclouds of the most commonly used words in these social media comments. The American word cloud showed more words blurred out,\nmeaning that these were offensive words.\nEquality, equity, and social justice were the top three Canadian values according to a Nanos Research survey in 2016. Politeness, informality,\nand tolerance are also listed in various magazine articles and news stories as being very Canadian. The acronym POGG (for Peace, Order, and\nGood Government) has been shorthand for Canadian values ever since the British North American Act of 1867 that established Canada. Unlike\nthe US, Canada did not revolt from the United Kingdom, but legally separated from it and did not claim the need for \u201clife, liberty, and the\npursuit of happiness.\u201d\nThe last letter in the English language is z. In Canadian English this letter is known as \u201czed.\u201d That may seem strange to Americans; however,\nacross the world in various forms of the English language that last letter is zed. American English is the oddball case, calling that letter \u201czee.\u201d\nThe amount exported in dollars by the United States to Canada is equivalent to the amount exported to all the European Union countries\ncombined.\nActor William Shatner is a Canadian, but his most famous character is Star Trek\u2019s Captain James T. Kirk, who was born in Iowa.\nThe second longest international land border in the world is between Russia and Kazakhstan.

CHAPTER 99\nEurope: Population Geography III\nPolish Migration in the European Union\nPETER MESERVE\nThe European Union (EU) was officially established in 1993 from the merger of the EEC, ECSC, and several other\nacronyms. By establishing standard laws allowing goods, services, and money to move easily across borders, the\nEU created more and more linkages among its members. Though news about Brexit (the United Kingdom (UK)\nleaving the EU) has dominated recent headlines, the EU still functions to unify much of Europe \u2013 particularly with\nregard to economics, although social, security, and political ties are also important.\nThe movement of people within the EU has also been freer, though this has been a more deliberate and\ncomplicated process. Migration changes the demographics and economics of both countries involved and\ntherefore always involves nationalist political issues. Twenty-two of the EU\u2019s twenty-seven members participate\nin the Schengen Area where border controls and passports are not required and consequently there is greater\ninternational mobility. See Chapter 53 for more on the Schengen Agreement. Poland is a member of this Area\nand is a good example of the complications of migration within the EU.\nThe international migration of Poles (intra-EU specifically) involves crossing boundaries and therefore needs\nthe permission of both governments. Poland\u2019s boundaries have changed tremendously over the centuries. In\nthe mid-1500s, a Poland-Lithuania government controlled the lands from the Baltic Sea almost to the Crimean\nPeninsula in the Black Sea. Later, after invasions from surrounding countries, there was no \u2018Poland\u2019 on the map\nfrom 1795 to 1918. Following World War II (WWII), Poland\u2019s modern boundaries were established and, equally\nimportant, Poles themselves were relocated (from countries to the east) into the new Poland while Germans were\n484 EUROPE: POPULATION GEOGRAPHY III 485\nevicted from the western area. Now still, Poland borders Germany, Czechia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania,\nand Russia.\nDuring the Cold War years after WWII, Polish mobility was severely limited, as was the case in other countries\nbehind (to the east of) the Iron Curtain. Relatively few Poles were able to migrate for economic or political reasons,\nmany fewer reached western Europe. When Germany reunified in 1989 as the Berlin Wall came down, some\nimmigrants were allowed to help in rebuilding the country and over the next decade Poles made up the majority of\nthese seasonal and contract workers (technically temporary). National political issues in Germany (West Germany\nwas a founding member of the EU) later caused this migration to drop dramatically.\nPoland joined the EU in 2004, ten years after applying. Nine other\ncountries joined at the same time, including seven from East Europe, all with poorer economies than the EU\naverage. Most of the existing members of the EU had concerns about allowing free mobility for Poland and\nthe other new members lest it adversely affect their own employment and economies. Indeed, for years, a\nhypothetical \u201cPolish plumber\u201d was pushed by nationalists as a symbol of the loss of jobs to migrants.\nOnly three members of the EU \u2013 Sweden, Ireland, and the UK \u2013 immediately allowed immigration to the new\nmember countries, in large part because laborers were needed. Poles began to migrate in large numbers to\nIreland but especially to the UK, since job conditions were very favorable. Not surprisingly, most of the Poles were\nmale and in their twenties; surprisingly, many were well-educated yet accepted jobs in the construction and the\nhospitality sector. As a side effect, the number of students in Poland who studied English as a second language\ndoubled. (Almost all Poles are bilingual or polylingual; English replaced Russian as a common second language,\nalthough German remains popular.)\nPolish mobility to European countries has remained high for the most part after joining the EU; during the first\ndecade of the 21st Century Eurostatistics listed Poles as the nationality of the most migrants within the EU. While\nthe largest group of Poles was located in the UK (Germany was second), significant numbers were working in\nFrance, Ireland, and Italy. National surveys in Poland found that one out of eight adult Poles had worked abroad\nand that over two million Poles had lived outside the country in the ten years after joining the EU. While some\nPoles sought permanent residence in these countries, the vast majority returned to Poland. 486 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nWithin Poland, workers leaving for elsewhere in the EU have both\nhelped the finances of some regions but harmed the economic\nsituations of others. Particularly in the earlier stages, more Poles\nemigrated from the southern and eastern border areas of the\ncountry, especially from Opole (bordering Czechia) and Podlaskie\n(bordering Belarus.) The loss of laborers was compensated by the\nincrease in remittances that the Poles sent back home from their\nhigher paychecks. Overall, in the five years following EU\nmembership, the amount of remittances doubled (and also shifted\nfrom jobs in Germany to jobs in Ireland and the UK.)\nNational and international issues also affect Polish mobility. The\n2007-8 recession both increased the number of Poles seeking\npositions elsewhere in the EU and at least temporarily decreased\nBorder of Czech Republic (Czechia) and Poland.\nthe amount of positions available. On the whole, Poles worked in\nPhoto by insidious and subtle M on Flickr.\njob sectors that did not threaten the larger populations. However,\nas Brexit showed, in times of stress foreign workers (specifically\nPoles in the UK) are seen as enemies and occasionally attacked as such. International migration is a divisive\npolitical issue across the globe. The Schengen Agreement and Polish migration under that pact present interesting\nopportunities for geographic study.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nCuriously, Poland also receives many migrants. Among European Union member countries in 2018, Poland took in more migrants from\noutside the EU than any other EU country did. This included migrants from Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. Poland is beginning to look less\nethnically homogeneous.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nCharlemagne. 2020. \u201cPoland Is Cocking up Migration in a Very European Way.\u201d The Economist.

CHAPTER 100\nLatin America and the Caribbean (LACAR): Political\nGeography III\nSouth American Islands\nAlthough the continent of South America is a relatively compact shape and not a substantially insular region\n(compared to Europe or Southeast Asia), there are several noteworthy islands that belong to South American\ncountries. Intriguingly, several of these islands are very remote from the mainland.\nEaster Island is renowned for the large stone statues \u2013 moai \u2013 that were carved by native peoples on the island\nbetween 1200 and 1500 CE. The native Rapa Nui reached the island as part of the Austronesian Expansion that is\naddressed in Chapter 15. Genetic evidence also shows mixing of populations from South America and Polynesia.\n487 488 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nApparently, Rapa Nui sailed to and from Easter Island and\nthe mainland, even bringing people from the mainland home\nwith them. European explorers arrived at the island on Easter\nSunday in 1722, thus bestowing the island\u2019s modern name to\nit. Chile annexed the island in 1888. Easter Island is one of the\nmost isolated places in the world. It is nearly 1300 miles to the\nnearest inhabited island \u2013 Pitcairn Island, population roughly\nfifty people. As seen in this map, Easter Island is vastly\nseparated from just about anywhere.\nEcuador is\nfamous for its\nPhoto by Thomas Griggs on Unsplash Galapagos\nIslands, where\nCharles Darwin studied wildlife in 1835 while developing his theory\nof evolution. These islands are in the Pacific Ocean over 550 miles\nwest of Ecuador. Tourists enjoy the distinctiveness of the islands;\nhowever, natural preservation is crucial. UNESCO has designated\nthe location as a World Heritage Site and a biosphere reserve. The\nislands were discovered in 1535 on a chance observation during a\nvoyage from Panama to Peru.\nPhoto by Alexander Schimmeck on Unsplash\nFernando de Noronha is Brazil\u2019s volcanic\narchipelago. Located in the Atlantic Ocean, about 270\nmiles east of the mainland, the islands were\ndiscovered by Portuguese sailors, though the initial\ndiscovery is disputed, perhaps 1501 or 1502 or 1503.\nIt too is a World Heritage Site.

Its Rosario Islands (Islas del Rosario) comprise a natural park designated to preserve Caribbean coral\nreefs. Tourists are allowed at the park; indeed, the islands are only 62 miles from the Colombian port city of\nCartagena. LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN (LACAR): POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY III 489\nArgentina lays claim to the Falkland Islands (and to South Georgia\nand the South Sandwich Islands too), though the islands have been\nunder British control since 1834, except for several weeks of\noccupation by Argentinian military forces in 1982. The Islas\nMalvinas, as known in Argentina, are 184 miles from the mainland,\nbut of course are a vast distance from the England. Clearly, it is\nanother example of the vast British Empire.\nThe former French penal colony known as Devil\u2019s Island stood on\nthe Salvation Islands of French Guiana, about seven miles off the\ncoast. Conditions at the facility were abysmal; prisoners often\nsuffered from poor sanitation, risk of tropical disease, and brutal\nPhoto by Vijay Chander on Unsplash violence. The location gained fame from the 1969 novel and 1973\nfilm Papillon, a probably exaggerated memoir of escapee Henri\nCharri\u00e8re. There have been numerous film and literary references\nto the location. The prison camp was closed in 1953.\nThe countries of Guyana, Uruguay, Suriname have small stretches of coastline and lack noteworthy islands.\nBoth Venezuela and Peru have lengthier coastlines, but also feature few islands of importance. Both Bolivia and\nParaguay are landlocked, obviously having no island territories.\nDDiidd YYoouu KKnnooww??\nChina supports Argentina\u2019s claim to the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), while Argentina backs China\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is an integral\npart of China. Meanwhile, Taiwan agrees that the Falkland Islands belong in the United Kingdom, while the UK supports Taiwan\u2019s claims of\nindependence from China.\nThe 1973 film Papillon was a box office success, featuring stars Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen, but the 2017 reboot generally was\nconsidered a mediocre remake.\nCITED AND ADDITIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY:\nDunham, Will. 2014. \u201cEaster Island\u2019s Ancient Inhabitants Weren\u2019t so Isolated after All.\u201d Washington Post, October 27,\n2014, sec.

When we think of such horrific events most people think of the\nNazis and the Holocaust; however, decades earlier Germans had already engaged in the extermination of the\nHerero people in southwest Africa. Also, a systematic and organized campaign of mass murder previously had\nbeen perpetrated by the Turks against their Armenian minority in 1915. Both of these acts of atrocious political\nviolence occurred before the word \u201cgenocide\u201d had even been invented by the Polish-Jewish legal scholar Raphael\nLemkin. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and began the slaying of Jews, a mass killing that Winston\nChurchill called \u201ca crime without a name,\u201d Lemkin put the Greek word genos (race or people) with the Latin cide\n(the act of killing) to coin the neologism genocide, the killing of a people. He well understood the connections\nbetween what had happened in Turkey and what was happening in Europe. So did Adolf Hitler. In a speech in\n1939, Hitler described his plans for a murderous campaign of expansion to the East. Hitler called for the removal\nor extermination of its inhabitants and said \u201cwho, after all, speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians today?\u201d In\nmany ways, the Armenian Genocide provided a template for Hitler and his evil plans.\n490 RUSSIAN DOMAIN: HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY III 491\nThe Muslim Turkish rulers of the Ottoman Empire carried out the\ndeliberate and systematic genocide of the Christian Armenian\npeople under cover of the First World War (1914-18). The \u201cYoung\nTurks\u201d that had gained control of the government wanted to turn\ntheir backs on the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire and create a\nsecular Turkish national state. To do so, the nearly 3,000 year- old\nArmenian people, who had been a barely tolerated minority under\nthe sultans, would have to be expelled forcibly from Asia Minor.\nThe Armenians, despised by many Turks for their involvement in\ncommerce and trade, had been subjected to periodic brutal state-\nsponsored massacres by their overlords for centuries. The last, in\n1895-96, had resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 Armenians. Haghartsin Monastery, Armenia.\nThese calculated depredations were designed to keep the Photo by Makalu from Pixabay.\nArmenians subjugated and to forestall the development of a\nnational consciousness among them. The outbreak of the First World War heightened Turkish suspicions as to the\nloyalty of their Armenian subjects, as half of the Armenian people were located across the border in the Russian\nEmpire. Now that the Ottoman Empire was at war with Russia, the Turks feared that the Orthodox Christian\nArmenians would make common cause with their co-religionist Orthodox Russians and fellow Armenians across\nthe border to seek their own national state.\nOttoman Turkey, like Nazi Germany, made a deliberate attempt to eliminate an entire ethno-religious\ncommunity from its territory. Of course, the Jews in Germany were in fact Germans, whereas the Armenians were\nmerely subjects of the Sublime Porte, the central Ottoman government. In the former case, however, all Jews\neverywhere were liable for extermination while in the latter, even though the Armenian community was to be\nwholly destroyed within the state\u2019s borders, the main goal of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) was the\n\u201cTurkification\u201d of Anatolia. Both regimes\u2019 policies were ideologically driven. The Nazi onslaught was consequence\nof the idea of a \u201cracial struggle\u201d for primacy and the CUP by an ethno-nationalist conception of a future Islamic and\nTurkish state. Both genocides were conducted under the cover of World Wars with railroads and forced marches\nused to move the unfortunate victims to their deaths. Additionally, it was the advent of modern states and their\ncommunication systems that made the coordination of the necessary logistics easier. It was no coincidence that\nTalaat Pasha, the motive force and mastermind of the Armenian Genocide as Minister of Interior Affairs, had\npreviously worked in the telegraph and posts ministry. He had had a telegraph machine installed in his office\nand from there he personally oversaw the conduct of operations. Modern states need bureaucracies to carry out\npolicies, including a policy of genocide, and in the Armenian Genocide the paper trail was minimal due to the\norders being relayed by telegraph. 492 JOEL QUAM AND SCOTT CAMPBELL\nThe Turks began their onslaught on April 24, 1915,\nwith the arrest of prominent Armenians such as artists,\nwriters, clergymen and political figures. Armenians\nwho had been conscripted into the Turkish army were\ndisarmed and herded together in hastily erected\ncamps. Many of these people were summarily\nexecuted, those that were not would be dead anyway\nwithin a few weeks from forced labor. The orders then\nwent out to empty all Armenian towns and villages.\nSome people were deported on trains and others by\nwagons, but most of the victims were forced to leave\nfor the border on foot. Their homes were looted and\nransacked as soon as they left them. The roads were\nclogged with thousands upon thousands of frightened\nArmenian Graveyard. Photo by Makalu from Pixabay.\nArmenians. It was here that the real misery began. As\nthese unfortunates were being driven into the Syrian\ndesert to perish of thirst and exposure, they were attacked by soldiers of the \u201cSpecial Organization.\u201d Any goods or\nproperty with them were taken away by force. Women and girls were raped and then killed, others were taken to\nbe forcibly converted to Islam and employed as servants or concubines. Civilians joined the onslaught as they\nstole, raped, and murdered with impunity. Local Kurdish tribespeople also took advantage of the situation to\nenrich themselves. Within a few months, over 1.5 million Armenians were dead. Other deaths would follow, as\nOttoman forces pushed into Russian territory and encountered more Armenians there. Of the previous total\npopulation of four million, possibly up to half (two million) of the Armenian people perished, either as a result of\nbeing killed outright or through a lack of food and water. In the aftermath of the massacres, Armenian churches\nwere destroyed and any physical remnants of their cultural heritage such as schools, monasteries, monuments,\netc. were obliterated. All that remained was their language, their songs, and the collective memory of their\nHolocaust. "}
