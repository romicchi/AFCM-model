Chapter One: Introduction\nA History of the Middle East is a survey of Middle Eastern history from the time of\nMuhammad in the seventh century until the eve of the War on Terror in 2001. It is\ndesigned to meet the requirements of a single-term introductory course and is aimed at\nstudents who have no more than a casual understanding of the history, cultures, and\nsocieties of the region. It offers a relatively concise narrative of the region\u2019s historical\ndevelopment that seeks to avoid oversimplification on the one hand and overcomplexity\non the other.\nWhy Study History\nThis work rests on the assumption that a knowledge of history is an essential\nprerequisite for the proper functioning of a democratic polity. Self-governing political\nsystems depend on the ability of their citizenries to make wise and productive choices\nabout how to approach complex problems. Effective decision making, in turn, requires a\nstrong comprehension of the context of the questions under debate and an appreciation\nof how people addressed similar situations in the past. In other words, citizens must\nunderstand the history of the issues that they confront if they are to make informed\nchoices.\nImportantly, however, they need to comprehend the subject not as students and\nlaypeople typically perceive it, but instead in the way that professional historians do.\nThese understandings are very different. The popular definition of history describes it as\nthe accumulated events, actions, decisions, cultural constructs, relationships, and\ninstitutions that stretch back at least as far as the development of civilization some six-\nthousand years ago. According to this view, everything that people have ever done is\nhistory. Professional historians hold a different conception of the subject\u2014one that is\nboth quite distinct from the popular understanding and far more useful for those seeking\nto be engaged participants in a democratic system. According to this definition, history\nis the study of the past for the purpose of interpreting it\u2014that is, of discerning meaning\nin it\u2014in order to provide what historians call a \u201cusable past\u201d that can help people in the\npresent-day contextualize and better comprehend the issues that they face. Historians\nare particularly interested in how current political structures, cultural practices, power\nrelations, and social institutions developed. For example, scholars today study events\nsuch as the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 to better comprehend why many Middle\nEastern nations have weak civil societies and, why, as a result, many of them lack\ngenuinely representative governments. In other words, professional historians research\nthe past not because they are history \u201cbuffs\u201d or antiquarians who find the subject\nintrinsically interesting\u2014though they do\u2014but instead because the subject offers vital\ninsights into the issues and problems that citizens in democratic societies confront\ntoday.\nAn understanding of history along these lines can certainly help Americans\nacquire a better grasp of the development of a region that is, today, of vital importance Chapter One: Introduction Page 2\nto their country. Such has not always been the case. Indeed, prior to the First World\nWar, US engagement with the region was limited largely to Protestant missionary\nactivities and to related educational efforts such as the establishment of the American\nUniversity of Beirut. With the discovery of petroleum in Saudi Arabia just before World\nWar II and with the onset of the Cold War in the late 1940s, however, the US began to\nassert its interests in the Middle East both formally and informally. American\ninvolvement in the region steadily grew over the ensuing decades apace the region\u2019s\nemergence as a major player in the global economy, and it rose sharply beginning in\nthe early 1980s to the point that the Middle East became, after 2001, the primary focus\nof American foreign policy and military engagement. As the historian of international\nrelations Andrew Bacevich perceptively notes, \u201c[f]rom the end of World War II to 1980,\nvirtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in that region. . . . Since\n1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere except in the\nGreater Middle East.\u201d1\nDespite Washington\u2019s increasingly intensive involvement in the Middle East over\nthe past few decades, however, most Americans still lack a basic understanding of the\nregion\u2019s history. Few are aware of the ways in which Islam shaped the Middle East or\nunderstand the role that European imperialists played in forming its political and\ndiplomatic contours. Even government officials and legislators who oversee American\npolicy toward the Middle East are frequently ignorant of rudimentary aspects of the\nregion\u2019s history and culture and fail to understand how those factors continue to\ninfluence contemporary identities and fault lines. As the journalist Jeff Stein noted in\n2006, many congresspeople and policymakers\u2014including the FBI\u2019s chief of\ncounterterrorism\u2014could not summarize something as basic as the difference between\nSunnism and Shi\u02bfism at a time when American troops were desperately trying to\nimpose order on a country, Iraq, that was riven by communal violence between those\nconfessional groups. In light of the importance that Washington continues to assign to\nthe region, Americans and other Westerners\u2014be they policymakers, legislators, or\ncitizens\u2014clearly need a substantially better understanding of the Middle East if they are\nto avoid the policy missteps of the recent past.2\nApproach\nThis textbook is designed to satisfy that need and to offer students and faculty an\naffordable yet comprehensive text. I have written it explicitly with introductory courses in\nmind and have organized and presented the material accordingly. To meet the needs of\nall students, it requires no background knowledge of Middle Eastern history. To facilitate\nreadability and to emphasize the role of causality as a force in history, it largely adheres\nto a traditional, chronological approach to the subject. To align with most Middle Eastern\n1 Andrew J. Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History\n(New York: Random House, 2016), 11.\n2 Jeff Stein, \u201cOpinion | Can You Tell a Sunni From a Shiite?,\u201d The New York Times,\nOctober 17, 2006, https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/opinion/17stein.html. Chapter One: Introduction Page 3\nhistory classes, it begins with the emergence of Islam in the seventh century CE and\nomits coverage of the region\u2019s long, pre-Islamic history.\nThe book focuses predominantly on the political history of the Middle East. Its\nbasic narrative consequently emphasizes the region\u2019s political development,\ninternational relations, and the formulation and execution of state policies. It follows this\napproach for two reasons. First, for the entire period covered in this text, key political\nquestions\u2014Who should rule? How should the state be structured? What powers should\nthe government have?\u2014occupied the attention of the region\u2019s peoples. In other words,\nthe Middle East\u2019s political history is significant because those who lived in the region\nand made its history believed it was important. Second, far from being antithetical to\nother ways of exploring the topic such as those that examine it through a social or\ncultural lens, a focus on political history can offer a solid starting point for inquiries\nbased on those approaches. Specifically, this text provides students in courses\norganized along those lines with the foundational knowledge needed for them to\ncontextualize\u2014and thus better understand\u2014the Middle East\u2019s cultural and social\nevolution. This is not to suggest that this work exclusively centers on politics. While\nsocial, cultural, intellectual, and religious history may not organize the broader structure\nof the work, they nonetheless receive significant attention and are woven into the\nbroader narrative in ways that relate them to the textbook\u2019s focus on political\ndevelopments.\nThis work also does not advance a strong unifying argument. At first blush, this\nchoice may seem to contradict my earlier claim that interpretation is the main focus of\nprofessional historians; in fact, it is consistent with that view. I have opted to produce a\nwork that is\u2014such as can be the case\u2014neutral in tone because I believe strongly that\nthe interpretive direction of a given class is, in the end, the purview not of the author of\nthe adopted textbook but instead of the person teaching that course. By deemphasizing\nmy interpretation of events, this textbook frees professors and teachers who use it to\narticulate their own themes. Please note, however, that this approach does not mean\nthat this book eschews historical argumentation. Instead, it seeks to expose students to\nsome of the more important historiographical debates of recent decades by addressing\nthem in the overall narrative. For example, Chapter Two largely follows the traditional\nstory of Muhammad, but also explores the very different interpretation of Islam\u2019s origins\nthat revisionist scholars such as Patricia Crone have developed.\nWhile the text does not seek to advance a particular argument, it does develop\ntwo broad themes. First, it explores the part that faith\u2014particularly the religion of\nIslam\u2014played in shaping the political, social, cultural, and intellectual development of\nthe region. Understanding religion\u2019s influence can help us to address several key\nquestions. What impact has Islam had on the nature of modern Middle Eastern states?\nTo what degree are present-day gender relations in the region the product of Islam? Did\nreligion advance or impede scientific and philosophic knowledge in the Muslim world?\nTo what extent did it shape political ideology and the structure of government in the\nregion? Second, this book examines the nature of interactions between the Muslim\nMiddle East and the West with the aim of helping students to develop a more Chapter One: Introduction Page 4\nsophisticated understanding of that relationship. It is a commonplace in many quarters\ntoday that the West and the Muslim world have been in a constant state of conflict going\nback to the Arab conquest of Syria and Egypt in the 630s and 640s and that the two\ncultures are today locked in an ongoing \u201cClash of Civilizations.\u201d This work argues\nimplicitly that such an interpretation is, at best, a gross oversimplification that ignores\nthe many instances in which the two regions have enjoyed cooperative rather than\nconflicting relations.3\nStructure\nThis book is organized chronologically and divides the history of the Middle East\ninto four periods: Islam and the Caliphate, The Ottoman Empire, the Western Intrusion,\nand Decolonization and America\u2019s Bid for Mastery.\nThe first section focuses on the emergence of Islam and on the growth and\ntransformation of the Arab-Muslim Caliphate. Chapter Two explores Muhammad\n(c. 570-632), the revolutionary political, social, and cultural message that he brought to\nArabia, and the origins of the Muslim community. It also provides a very brief overview\nof Islam\u2019s main tenets and characteristics. Chapter Three surveys the Arab Conquest\nand the formation of the Arab Empire from the death of the prophet through the high\npoint of the Abbasid Caliphate. Chapter Four assesses intellectual trends during the\nArab Empire and the ways in which Islam evolved, diversified, and took on many of its\ndefining characteristics in the centuries following Muhammad. Chapter Five examines\nthe gradual weakening of the Abbasid Caliphate, the growing political dominance in the\nMiddle East of recently arrived Turkic people, the Crusades, and, finally, the Mongol\ndestruction of the Abbasid Caliphate.\nThe second section assesses the Middle East under Ottoman rule. Chapter Six\nexplores the growth of the empire, tracing the emergence of the Ottoman Dynasty, its\nrise to dominance, and the characteristics that made it successful. It also examines the\nsimilar Safavid Dynasty in Iran. Chapter Seven looks at how the Ottoman Empire\nevolved from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-eighteenth centuries. It also addresses the\nhistorical debate over whether changes in the empire are better understood as a case of\ndecline or transformation. Chapter Eight focuses on two topics. First, it looks at the\ngrowing Western diplomatic and economic dominance of the Middle East from the\n1760s through the 1870s. Second, it examines the bifurcated regional response to this\nchallenge wherein some states, political players, and thinkers reacted by promoting\npolicies designed to imitate the West while others instead argued that the region could\nbest counter the European states through a revival of Islamic practices and values.\nThe third section reviews the period of European imperial domination from World\nWar I through the late 1940s. Chapter Nine explores political changes in the Ottoman\nEmpire in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the emergence of Zionism,\n3 See Samuel Huntington, \u201cThe Clash of Civilizations?,\u201d Foreign Affairs 72, no. 3 (1996):\n22\u201349. Chapter One: Introduction Page 5\nand the outbreak of the First World War. Chapter Ten examines the conclusion of the\nGreat War and the subsequent diplomatic settlement that resulted in the European\npowers establishing control over nearly the entire region and imposing on it new\nfrontiers and a Western-style state system. Chapter Eleven studies the efforts of Saudi\nArabia, Iran, and Turkey to maintain their independence during the Interwar Period and\nWorld War II, while Chapter Twelve surveys the experience of Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq,\nTransjordan, and Syria under Western control between the Paris Peace Conference\nand 1948. Chapter Thirteen traces the struggle for control of Palestine during the 1920s\nand 1930s, and the 1948 War that accompanied the establishment of Israel.\nThe final section of the book centers on decolonization and America\u2019s effort to\nimpose order on the region. Chapter Fourteen investigates the ways in which\ndecolonization, the Cold War, nationalism, hostility among the Arab states, and the\nArab-Israeli conflict shaped the development of the region from 1949 to 1967. Chapter\nFifteen assesses the history of Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran between World War II\nand 1979, paying special attention to the coup against Prime Minister Mohammad\nMossadegh (1882-1967) in 1953 and to the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s.\nChapter Sixteen explores the transformative events of the 1970s\u2014including the\nemergence of religious fundamentalism in the region\u2014that culminated in the watershed\nyear of 1979. Chapter Seventeen focuses on the dominant events and themes of the\nperiod from 1979 to 1990. It examines the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the growing\npopularity of Islamism, the Intifada, and the Iran-Iraq War. Finally, Chapter Eighteen\nfocuses on the period from 1990 to 2001. It reviews the Gulf War, the failed effort to\nnegotiate a permanent settlement of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, the\nchallenge that domestic jihadi movements posed to the region\u2019s established regimes,\nand the growth of the transnational al-Qa\u02bfida terrorist organization.\nGeographic Focus\nBefore we get into the history of the Middle East, we must define its territorial\nextent and understand how and why people came to view it as a distinct area. Of\nobvious Eurocentric origins, the term \u2018Middle East\u2019 is a comparatively recent neologism.\nPrior to the nineteenth century, Westerners had used the older terms \u2018Near East\u2019 or\n\u2018Nearer East\u2019 to refer to the European, African, and Asian territories then under the\ncontrol of the Ottoman Empire. By the 1840s, however, some British colonial officials\nhad become increasingly dissatisfied with those terms because they left out Iran and the\nArabian side of the Persian Gulf. In response, policymakers in Britain\u2019s India Office\ncoined the term \u2018Middle East\u2019 in the 1850s to describe an enlarged understanding of the\nregion that included those areas. Though the expression gained some traction in certain\nparts of the British government during the latter part of the century, it failed to catch on\nat that time. Ultimately, it was the American naval strategist and historian Alfred Thayer\nMahan\u2019s use of the term in his influential article \u201cThe Persian Gulf and International\nRelations\u201d in 1902 that popularized it. Usage of the expression grew rapidly thereafter,\nculminating in the British government\u2019s decision to designate the body it established to\ncoordinate the defense of the region during World War II as the Middle East\nCommand\u2014a choice that cemented the term\u2019s growing popular acceptance. By the Chapter One: Introduction Page 6\n1950s, as a result, it had fully replaced the term \u2018Near East\u2019 as a descriptor for the\nregion.4\nThis textbook delineates the region along lines very similar to those used by the\nMiddle East Command during World War II. According to this definition, the region\nincludes the territory encompassed by modern-day Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,\nthe United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, the\nOccupied Territories, Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey. Note, however, that this text will not\nconfine itself exclusively to the area encompassed by that definition. Not only will it\ndiscuss events in non-Middle Eastern places such as Western Europe and the United\nStates, but it will also, as necessary, stretch the definition of the region to include\nterritories in North Africa, Central Asia, and the Balkans that were, at times, culturally or\npolitically integrated into the Middle East.\nThe region\u2019s physical geography abounds in ironies. On the one hand, the Middle\nEast is tremendously arid; Egypt and nearly all of the Arabian peninsula receive at best\nnegligible rainfall, and much of the area cannot sustain agriculture. On the other, the\ngreat river valleys of the Tigris, Euphrates, and Nile have sustained large, complex, and\nhighly productive agricultural societies since the dawn of civilization. Indeed,\nMesopotamia\u2014the land between the Tigris and Euphrates\u2014was the place where\npeople first practiced intensive agriculture, and Egypt and Mesopotamia remained the\ngreatest wealth producing regions of western Eurasia until the late Middle Ages.\nLikewise, while the Middle East is famously devoid of basic natural resources such as\ntimber and many ores, it today possesses oil deposits of enormous strategic, economic,\nand environmental significance.5\nLess ironic has been the region\u2019s role in trade and cultural exchange. For\nmillennia, the Middle East has been a literal crossroads. The Sinai Peninsula land\nbridge long served as a conduit for commerce between Southwest Asia and Egypt,\nwhile the easily crossed Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits firmly connected the region\nto Europe. The Middle East also brought disparate regions together via shipborne trade.\nThe Suez Canal and earlier waterways linking the Red Sea to the Nile River connected\nthe Mediterranean to East Africa and South Asia by ship, while the Euphrates River\nprovided easy passage for goods moving between the ports of the Persian Gulf and\nAsia Minor and the Black Sea. As we shall see, this fortuitous location proved to be a\nmixed blessing for the region. Under the Arab Empire, the region became the central\nhub in a massive system of commerce that connected Africa, Europe, South Asia,\nCentral Asia, and China. In more recent times, however, the Middle East\u2019s oil reserves\n4 Peter Beaumont, Gerald H. Blake, and J. Malcom Wagstaff, The Middle East: A\nGeographical Study (New York: Wiley, 1988), 16; Clayton R. Koppes, \u201cCaptain Mahan,\nGeneral Gordon, and the Origins of the Term \u2018Middle East,\u2019\u201d Middle Eastern Studies 12,\nno. 1 (1976): 95\u201398.\n5 Hosny Hasanean and Mansour Almazroui, \u201cRainfall: Features and Variations over\nSaudi Arabia, A Review,\u201d Climate 3, no. 3 (September 2015): 578\u2013626,\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/cli3030578. Chapter One: Introduction Page 7\nand strategic location drew the unwanted attention of European imperial powers such\nas Britain, Russia, and France.\nCulturally, the Middle East has always been very diverse. Today, most of the\nregion\u2019s people identify as Arab. Arabs predominate in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula,\nSyria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. However, the Middle East also includes large\nnumbers of people who identify as Turkish and Iranian, as well as smaller numbers of\nKurds, Armenians, and Jewish people. The region\u2019s religious diversity matches its\nethnic heterogeneity. While the people of the Middle East overwhelmingly practice\nIslam, its Muslim population is divided between the Sunni majority and a Shi\u02bfi minority\nwho are concentrated in Iraq, Iran, and the Persian Gulf region. The Middle East also\nhas smaller numbers of Jewish people, Druze, and Alawites, as well as Maronite,\nAssyrian, and Coptic Christians.\nA Word About Religion\nThis book is neither a religious history nor a Muslim Studies textbook, but it does\ntouch upon faith, especially Islam, to a significant degree. As religious beliefs can be\nsensitive for observant students, I want to explain up front how this text will address the\nsubject. Designed for higher-education classes, it adheres to academic rules regarding\nthe use of evidence and argumentation. It thus cannot, and will not, weigh in on the\nvalidity of religious beliefs that are, by definition, articles of faith. As such, while it seeks\nto be respectful of peoples\u2019 beliefs, this textbook leaves faith to the reader and treats all\nreligions as human constructions.\nTransliteration\nThis book transliterates non-English words according to the International Journal\nof Middle East Studies (IJMES) Translation and Transliteration Guide. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632\nIn 610 CE, an event would occur that would alter the trajectory of world history.\nThat year, a successful Arab merchant named Muhammad (c. 570-632) claimed to have\nbeen visited by the angel Gabriel while meditating in a cave. According to Muhammad,\nGabriel commanded him to \u201crecite!\u201d Terrified, he pleaded that he could not. Again, the\nangel made his demand:\nRecite in the name of your Lord who created\u2014Created man from a\nclinging substance. Recite and your Lord is the most Generous\u2014Who\ntaught by the pen\u2014Taught man that which he knew not (Qur\u02bean 96: 1\u20135).\nThis time, as Muhammad later claimed, words poured from his mouth like a\ntorrent. To Muslims, this was a pivotal moment\u2014the point at which Muhammad became\nGod\u2019s final messenger, or the Seal of the Prophets.\nThus began both the religion of Islam and its holy book, the Qur\u02bean, which\nmeans, literally, \u201crecitation.\u201d Over the next twenty-three years, Muhammad would reveal\nthe rest of the Qur\u02bean, which he claimed originated with God, or, in Arabic, Allah, and\nwhich he declared was God\u2019s final revelation to humanity. He called the religion Islam,\nor submission to the will of God, and referred to his followers as Muslims, or those who\nsurrender to God. It was a modest beginning for an ardently monotheistic faith\u2014one\nthat would soon reshape the political, social, cultural, and economic map not just of the\nMiddle East but of the entire globe.\nThe Pre-Islamic Middle East\nBefore we get to Muhammad and the religion he established, we must first place\nexplore the world in which Islam emerged. All social movements are products of the\ntimes and circumstances in which they arise. In innumerable ways, they reflect the\nvalues, social hierarchies, and beliefs of the cultures from which they emerge. They also\nrespond to and echo the frictions and challenges of their era and succeed most often\nwhen they are able to offer answers to those problems. The Islamic movement was no\ndifferent. The culture, mentalities, and beliefs of the Arab people shaped the new\nreligion even as Islam borrowed heavily from other monotheistic faiths\u2014particularly\nJudaism and Christianity. Above all, the new religion that Muhammad espoused\nreflected the evolving socioeconomic circumstances of late-sixth and early-seventh\ncentury Arabia, and it drew strength from its ability to offer solutions to the rise in\ninequality that those changes produced.\nThe Arab People\nNearly the entire population of the Arabian peninsula at the time of Muhammad\u2019s\nbirth was Arab. A Semitic people, the Arabs were well acclimated to the harsh climate of\nthe region in part because they had, around 3,000 BCE, domesticated an animal ideally Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 9\nsuited to that arid landscape: the camel. Capable of surviving for long periods of time\nwithout water, camels permitted the Arabs to travel between oases and to cross\notherwise-inhospitable regions of the peninsula. Later, Arab merchants would carry out\nextensive trade using vast fleets of camels that could efficiently transport large\nquantities of goods.1\nEven in the time of Muhammad most Arabs lived a nomadic existence. Called\nbedouin, the nomadic Arabs followed a pattern common to most pastoral cultures. That\nis, they did not have complex, impersonal political systems of the type common among\nsedentary societies; instead, they organized themselves along less-formal, tribal\npolitical and social arrangements in which familial ties defined identity and group\nmembership. In this system, the authority of elders and the threat of ostracism were\ngenerally all that were needed to maintain order. Likewise, the bedouin had a\ncomparatively simple economic system typical of tribal societies. Similar to that of many\nother nomadic cultures, it mixed hunting and gathering, herding animals, and slash-and-\nburn agriculture.2\nAs was also often the case in other tribal societies, bedouin engaged in near-\nconstant intertribal warfare. This form of conflict was very different from the territorial,\ntrade, and resource-oriented fighting characteristic of both the sedentary empires of\nLate Antiquity and the states of the modern era. Rather than trying to conquer land or\nwipe out rivals\u2014though they occasionally fought such wars\u2014the bedouin instead\ntypically engaged in low-intensity intertribal raids, or ghazu. They stole herd animals,\nfought and killed men from rival tribes in small engagements, captured women and\nchildren, and extracted tribute from the comparatively wealthy town Arabs. These low-\nintensity raids served several important purposes. On a material level, they provided a\nway to increase both the size of the tribe and its wealth. More importantly, the ghazu\nconstituted a regulated system of violence that channeled the energy and discord of the\ntribes\u2019 young men outward in a way that ensured domestic tranquility while also giving\nthose warriors a sanctioned opportunity to gain the status and social recognition needed\nto become respected and influential members of their tribe.3\nLiving in a tribal system, the bedouin neither had nor needed a formal, written\nlegal system. Instead, they abided by a social code called muruwah that governed\nbehavior and public morality. The muruwah code emphasized those values that were\nessential to the survival and prosperity of the tribe: bravery, preservation of honor,\nloyalty, care for the poor, hospitality, and protection of the weak. Valor, honor, and fealty\nare obviously critical in an environment in which ghazu are the norm\u2014after all, group\nsurvival depended on such beliefs\u2014but why did the muruwah code place so much\n1 See Richard W.

It did so because the survival of both the tribe and its elite depended on unity\nand on every member contributing to the good of the collective. Only by caring for the\nweakest members of the tribe could the powerful ensure that those on the lowest rungs\nwould help them during times of crisis.4\nNot all Arabs were bedouin. A significant minority lived in towns and cities,\nparticularly in the Hijaz, the part of Arabia that lies along the Red Sea coast. Given the\nregion\u2019s scant rainfall\u2014it receives less than 200 millimeters of rain annually\u2014such\nsettlements could only exist at the numerous oases that dotted the area. Taking\nadvantage of the regular supply of water that the oases provided, towns like Taif,\nYathrib, Mecca, and Badr sustained themselves by growing dates and cereal crops.\nThey did not focus exclusively on agriculture, however. Instead, over time, these\nsettlements became centers of long-distance commerce. They transshipped goods from\nnorth to south and used the profits they earned to buy Damascus swords, wine, and,\nespecially, Syrian wheat. Town Arabs had a symbiotic relationship with the region\u2019s\nbedouin. While the two groups often clashed, they nonetheless engaged in important\ntrade relationships in which the settled Arabs exchanged agricultural goods for the\nbedouins\u2019 animal skins, meat, and livestock. Town Arabs also retained close ties with\nthose tribes to whom they were related.5\nMuslims have long regarded the period before Muhammad as al-Jahiliyya, or the\nAge of Ignorance, a time during which the Arab people had lost their faith in the one\nGod and had become polytheists. As the scholar of religion Reza Aslan argues,\nhowever, this interpretation fails to capture adequately either the rich diversity of pre-\nIslamic Arab religious beliefs or their syncretic nature\u2014meaning their inclusion of\nelements from a variety of faiths. Most Arabs of this period were polytheists. They\nacknowledged the existence of 360 tribal gods that they believed oversaw the day-to-\nday functioning of the material world. Beyond the tribal deities there existed a supreme\nGod, Allah, who had created the universe. The Arabs conceived of Allah as a remote\ndeity that did not answer to supplication; instead, people prayed to one of the lesser\ngods for intercession if they needed help.6\nPre-Islamic Arab religious beliefs went well beyond polytheism, however. Some,\nparticularly in Yemen, had converted to Christianity over the prior few centuries, and\nChristian theology permeated the beliefs of nearly all Arabs. The Arabian peninsula\nlikewise had a significant number of Jewish communities composed of both Jewish\nimmigrants and Arab converts. Christian and Jewish theology profoundly influenced the\nreligious views of the Hijaz. Regardless of affiliation, for example, nearly all Arabs\n4 Karen Armstrong, Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time (New York: HarperOne, 2006),\n15\u201317.\n5 Hoyland, Arabia and the Arabs, 4, 102\u20139; Juan Cole, Muhammad: Prophet of Peace\nAmid the Clash of Empires (New York: Nation Books, 2018), 11\u201313.\n6 Reza Aslan, No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, Updated\nEdition (Random House, 2011), 3\u201310. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 11\nbelieved that they descended from Abraham\u2014the patriarch of the three Abrahamic\nfaiths, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity\u2014through Ismael, the product of Abraham\u2019s\nunion with his wife Sarah\u2019s handmaiden, Hagar. Indeed, by the sixth century, most town\nArabs had come to believe that Allah was the same as the God that Christians and\nHebrews worshipped.7\nMuhammad\u2019s hometown of Mecca had long stood as the dominant religious\ncenter in Arabia. Located about halfway up the Hijaz along the trade routes stretching\nfrom Yemen in the south to the Roman Empire in the north, the city owed its rise to\nprominence to its possession of Arabia\u2019s principle religious shrine: The Ka\u02bfba. Believed\nto have been erected by Adam, rebuilt by Noah after the Flood, and later restored by\nAbraham and Ismael, the Ka\u02bfba was a small, roofless masonry structure that housed a\nblack, meteorite rock believed to represent the distant creator God.8\nThe Ka\u02bfba was already an important shrine when, in the late-fourth century, the\nQuraysh tribe that dominated Mecca persuaded the bedouin to house the idols\nrepresenting the region\u2019s 360 tribal gods in it. The success of this initiative dramatically\nraised the stature and economic position of the town. Thereafter the tribes of Arabia\nvisited the Ka\u02bfba each winter during an annual pilgrimage known as the hajj. The\npilgrims frequented inns, food stalls, gambling dens, and brothels and, in the process,\nmade many Quraysh rich. The trade that accompanied the annual pilgrimage was even\nmore lucrative. Thanks to the presence of the Ka\u02bfba, the entire town had become\nsacred ground in which violence and intertribal conflict was haram, or forbidden. Trade\ncould thus occur in Mecca even between members of hostile tribes, with the result that\nthe city became a vast marketplace during the hajj. The Quraysh profited handsomely\nfrom this commerce. Not only did it generate substantial revenue through a modest tax\nthat the Quraysh imposed on the sale of all goods during the pilgrimage, but, more\nimportantly, it lent Mecca a newfound economic significance that, like gravity, gradually\npulled the region\u2019s trade routes to it.9\nThe Byzantine and Persian Empires\nWhile the Arabs dominated the Arabian peninsula at the time of Muhammad\u2019s\nbirth, the rest of the Middle East fell under the rule of two of the greatest states of Late\nAntiquity: the Byzantine and Persian Empires. From their capital of Constantinople,\nByzantine emperors ruled Italy, the Balkans, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, North Africa,\nand grain-rich Egypt. Based in the city of Ctesiphon near modern-day Baghdad,\nmeanwhile, the Persian Sassanid Dynasty controlled the Iranian plateau and the rich,\ngrain-producing region of Mesopotamia. Both of these states were venerable. Cyrus the\nGreat (c. 600-530 BCE) had founded the Persian Empire in the sixth century BCE, and\nthe Sassanid Dynasty had ruled it since 224 CE. Heir to the Roman Empire, the\nByzantine Empire was a continuation of the state that the Emperor Caesar Augustus\n7 Aslan, 3\u201310.\n8 Aslan, 23\u201328.\n9 Aslan, 26\u201328. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 12\n(r. 27 BCE-14 CE) had created in the first century BCE out of the already very-old\nRoman Republic.10\nReligion played an important role in both states. Most people who lived in the\nPersian Empire were adherents of its state religion: Zoroastrianism. Dating to the sixth-\ncentury BCE, Zoroastrianism was a dualist faith similar in many ways to Christianity that\nheld that the god of light, Ahura Mazda, was locked in an eternal struggle with an evil\ndeity named Ahriman. The Sassanid Empire was not uniformly Zoroastrian, however;\ninstead, it also possessed a number of sizeable religious minorities\u2014particularly in\nMesopotamia. That region had a large Jewish community that dated to the Babylonian\nCaptivity as well as a significant population of Christians. Persian shahs were well\naware of both their empire\u2019s religious diversity and the challenges that confessional\nunrest could pose to their rule. Accordingly, though the dynasty had officially adopted\nZoroastrianism as its state religion in the early third century, it pursued a policy of\ntoleration toward other faiths designed to avoid internal dissent.11\nMeanwhile, by the sixth century, Christianity had become the overwhelmingly\ndominant religion in the Byzantine Empire. Initially an underground movement, it had\ngrown slowly but steadily in the Roman world between the death of Christ and the end\nof the third century. Following the Emperor Constantine\u2019s (r. 306-337) declaration of\nreligious toleration in the early fourth century, however, Christianity exploded in\npopularity. Indeed, by the end of the fourth century, it had become the official religion of\nthe empire.\nEven as Christianity was rapidly gaining converts and winning the support of the\nstate, it was also experiencing significant internal conflict. Theological in nature, the\ndebates centered on Christ\u2019s essence and the concept of the Trinity. First articulated in\nthe third century by the orthodox theologian Tertullian (c. 155-220), the Trinity holds that\nGod, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are simultaneously both distinct entities and a single,\nunified deity, and that Jesus contained both divine and human elements.12\nMany Christians did not agree with Tertullian\u2019s orthodox position. Some, called\nMonophysites, argued that a being could not be composed of two essences, and\nconcluded that Jesus was wholly divine in nature. Monophysitism won few supporters in\nthe empire outside of the Middle East, but its adherents constituted a majority of the\npopulation in Egypt, where they were called Copts, and in Syria, where they were\nknown as Jacobites. The Monophysites soon found themselves in a difficult position.\nBoth the Church and the Roman state placed great value on conformity of belief and\nsought to suppress theological positions that challenged orthodoxy; accordingly, under\nthe direction of the emperor Marcian (r. 450-458), the Church reaffirmed the orthodox\n10 Hugh Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, Second Edition (New\nYork: Routledge, 2004), 1\u20136.\n11 Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2002), 6\u20138.\n12 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 11. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 13\nview that Christ had two natures and declared Monophysitism to be a heresy at the\nCouncil of Chalcedon in 451. As a result, from the mid-fifth to the early-seventh\ncenturies, the Jacobites and Copts endured periodic persecution at the hands of the\necclesiastical and civil authorities.13\nNeither empire exerted direct control over the nearby Arabian peninsula. Given\nits sheer size, fractious tribal population, and challenging geography, conquering the\nregion generated little interest among either Byzantine emperors or Sassanid shahs.\nInstead, both states sought to ensure the security of their Arabian border by entering\ninto mutually beneficial relationships with Arab client tribes. For example,\nConstantinople provided the leaders of the largely Christian\u2014though Monophysite\u2014\nGhassanid tribe with titles and an annual subsidy of gold; in exchange, the Ghassanids\nprevented other tribes from raiding the empire from Arabia. Ctesiphon enjoyed a similar\narrangement with the predominantly Zoroastrian Lakhmid tribe along its frontier with the\npeninsula.14\nThe client tribes played an important part in the frequent wars between the\nPersian and Byzantine Empires. Relations between the empires had been poor since\nthey had acquired a common border in the first century BCE. Thereafter, the Roman\nEmpire and its Byzantine successor had waged a series of on-again, off-again wars with\nsuccessive Persian dynasties for control of northern Mesopotamia. During some periods\nsuch as the third century CE, the Persians held the upper hand; at other points, Roman\nor Byzantine armies dominated the frontier. At no time, however, was one side able to\ndecisively defeat the other or to substantially alter the border between the two\nempires.15\nTrade in Arabia\nIn fact, the biggest consequence of the fighting between Rome and Persia\nrelated not to territory but instead to commerce. As a result of the Roman upper class\u2019s\nnear-insatiable demand for Chinese silk and Indian spices, merchants from the empire\nimported vast quantities of expensive luxury goods from the east. Caravan merchants\nbrought products originating in China west via the overland Silk Road network of trade\nroutes that crisscrossed central Asia, while maritime traders carried spices and other\nluxuries from India by ship across the Arabian Sea and up the Persian Gulf. In both\ncases, the goods then moved through Persian territory along the Euphrates River\nbefore crossing the frontier into Roman Syria. In times of peace, this arrangement\nfunctioned reasonably well for the Romans and their Byzantine successors. During\nperiods of conflict, however, Sassanid shahs could impose high taxes that merchants\nwould then pass on to consumers; as a result, the trade in luxury goods through Persia\n13 Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000 (New\nYork: Penguin Books, 2009), 62\u201363.\n14 Hoyland, Arabia and the Arabs, 78\u201383.\n15 Hoyland, 80\u201382. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 14\nmeant that Rome would, in effect, be footing part of the cost of the Sassanids\u2019 wars\nagainst the empire.16\nRoman and then Byzantine emperors found this state of affairs intolerable and\nactively sought during times of conflict to foster alternate trade routes that lay outside\nthe purview of Persian tax collectors. That strategy involved two components. In the\nnorth, imperial officials worked to move Silk Road trade with China from the Sassanid\nEmpire to a new terminus on the Roman-controlled Crimean Peninsula. In the south,\nthey induced merchants coming by ship from the Subcontinent to abandon the\ntraditional route through the Persian Gulf in favor of a new one in which they traveled up\nthe Red Sea to Roman ports in Egypt or Palestine.17\nNot every ship entered the Red Sea, however. On the contrary, many instead\noffloaded their cargos at the port of Aden in southern Yemen. From there, massive\ncamel caravans carried goods northward to trading centers in the Hijaz and thence into\nthe empire. Imperial encouragement of the southern route thus had enormous\nconsequences for the Arabs of the region. Thanks to it, trade from the Subcontinent to\nthe Roman Empire via the Arabian peninsula surged from the first century CE until the\nlate-fourth century CE, enmeshing the Arabs in one of the globe\u2019s great long-distance\ntrade networks and creating an economic boom in the Hijaz.18\nEconomic Contraction and Recovery\nThe good times came to an abrupt end in the late fourth century, however. In\n384, the Roman Emperor Theodosius negotiated a peace agreement with the new\nPersian Shah, Shapur III (r. 383-388). While such treaties between Rome and Persia\nwere typically fleeting, this one proved durable. Benefitting from the presence of a\ncommon, existential threat in the form of the powerful Hunnic Empire, the peace\nbetween the two rivals would, save for a brief border skirmish from 421-422, hold until\nthe early-sixth century.19\nThe treaty may have focused on diplomatic goals, but it nonetheless had a far-\nreaching impact on long-distance trade patterns. Shorter and thus significantly cheaper,\nthe older route via the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates River to Rome gradually\nreasserted itself as the peace took hold. By the mid-fifth century, as a consequence,\nmerchants bringing goods between India and Rome had largely abandoned the\n16 Bernard Lewis, The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years (New York:\nScribner, 1995), 37\u201338.\n17 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 22\u201323.\n18 Kennedy, 22\u201323.\n19 Stephen Williams and Gerald Friell, Theodosius: The Empire at Bay (New Haven:\nYale University Press, 1998), 41. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 15\noverland route up the west side of the Arabian peninsula in favor of the more direct one\nthrough the Persia Empire.20\nThis change had a disastrous impact on the Hijaz. Bereft of much of the trade\nthat had nurtured it, the region entered a long depression in the fifth and early-sixth\ncenturies during which its economy degenerated from a long-distance, cash-based,\nmarket-based system into a much poorer subsistence- and barter-oriented one. Many\nwho had previously been involved in the caravan trade were consequently compelled to\nabandon their occupations in favor of farming or nomadism, with the result that the\nregion\u2019s towns shrank significantly. Mecca was a rare exception to this trend. It too\nsuffered from the economic depression, but, thanks to the Ka\u02bfba and the revenue the\nhajj produced, the city managed to weather the hard times in a way that its commercial\nrivals could not.21\nThe economy of the Hijaz languished until events to the north finally delivered the\nregion from its malaise in the sixth century. Salvation came as a result of renewed\nconflict in the Middle East. Beginning in the 520s, the Persian and Byzantine Empires\nslipped back into their old pattern of near-constant hostility. Between 526 and 591, they\nfought a series of wars for control of territory in northern Mesopotamia and for\ndominance of border states like Armenia. The renewal of conflict soon prompted\nConstantinople to resume the old Roman practice of encouraging the diversion of trade\nfrom Persia so as to avoid the stiff, 25 percent tax that the shah\u2019s government had\nstarted levying on goods bound for the Byzantine Empire. This effort proved more\ncomplicated than it had been in the past, however. In the early 570s, Ctesiphon had\nseized Yemen and with it control of the entrance to the Red Sea. As a result, ships\ncould no longer travel directly from India to the Byzantine Empire without paying Persian\nlevies.22\nThese conditions soon led to the recovery of the Hijazi economy. Ctesiphon\u2019s\ncontrol of Yemen proved key here. With trade via the Red Sea now subject to Persian\ntariffs, merchants searched for an alternate, tax-free route along which they could take\ngoods from the Arabian Sea to the Byzantine Empire. They found it in the Hijaz. Thanks\nto a loophole that permitted neutral cities to import cargoes from Persia and then\nreexport them to the Byzantine Empire without having to pay the tariff, merchants could\navoid Persian taxes by sending their goods north via the old overland routes across\nwestern Arabia. Very soon, large quantities of spices and other goods from India were\ntraveling once again by ship across the Arabian Sea to Aden and then by camel\ncaravan northward through the Hijaz to Byzantine Syria. Unsurprisingly, this sudden\nrevival of the long-distance trade in luxury goods produced a rapid economic recovery in\n20 Lewis, The Middle East, 42\u201343.\n21 Lewis, 42.\n22 Cole, Muhammad, 10\u201313. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 16\nthe region. In a matter of just a few decades, cities were repopulated, markets restored,\nand old commercial relationships renewed.23\nNo part of the Hijaz benefited from the return of trade more than Mecca. The\nrevitalization of long-distance trade soon flooded it with money and opportunity while the\nrecovery of the other cities and towns in the Hijaz produced an attendant revival of the\nlucrative hajj. As a result, the booming city rapidly reemerged as the dominant economic\nnexus in the region.24\nThe prosperity that Mecca enjoyed in the sixth and early-seventh centuries was\nnot shared equally by all its residents, however. While some leading members of the\nQuraysh tribe grew fabulously rich, many of the city\u2019s residents experienced no benefit\nwhatsoever from the revival of trade. Paradoxically, in fact, those on the bottom rungs of\nthe economic ladder appeared to be in a worse position than they had been before the\nrevival of commerce. Indeed, many were so destitute that they had little choice but to\nborrow money from the rich at usurious interest rates; when they inevitably proved\nunable to meet their obligations, their creditors forced them into debt slavery.25\nThe Beginnings of Islam\nIt was into this rapidly evolving world that Muhammad was born in the late-sixth\ncentury. While he personally enjoyed the fruits of the economic revival that the Hijaz\nwas experiencing, he was appalled by the inequality that had accompanied the city\u2019s\nreemergence as an important commercial center and alarmed by its leading families\u2019\nrepudiation of traditional Arab values. Indeed, the apparent abandonment of the ethic of\ngenerosity in favor of greed in late sixth-century Mecca would powerfully shape both his\nthinking and his religious message.\nMuhammad\nMost scholars today agree that Muhammad\u2019s difficult early life also profoundly\ninfluenced his religious views. Born sometime around 570 CE, he never met his father,\nAbdallah, who died shortly before he was born, and he lost his mother when he was just\nsix-years old. Fortunately for Muhammad, strong family connections spared him from\nthe grinding poverty that was typically the fate of orphans in sixth-century Arabia.\nInstead, he enjoyed a secure life\u2014first with his paternal grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib\n(c. 497-579), and then, when he too passed away, with his uncle Abu Talib (c 535-619),\nwho was the head of the Hashimite clan. This latter connection would prove critical for\nMuhammad. Aware of his nephew\u2019s preternatural wisdom and keen intelligence, Abu\nTalib arranged for the young man to help operate the clan\u2019s long-distance caravans.\n23 Cole, 13.\n24 Lewis, The Middle East, 42\u201343.\n25 Karen Armstrong, Islam: A Short History (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 3. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 17\nMuhammad excelled at the task. Bright and charismatic, he proved from an early age to\nbe a capable manager and a shrewd negotiator.26\nHis success eventually brought him to the attention of a wealthy woman named\nKhadija bint Khuwaylid (c. 555-619). Khadija was a remarkable person who had\novercome the patriarchal customs of pre-Islamic Arabia and the deaths of three\nhusbands to become Mecca\u2019s most prosperous merchant. Aware of the youthful\nMuhammad\u2019s probity and business acumen, she hired him around 595 to lead a\ncaravan from Mecca to Damascus. Returning with twice the profits she had anticipated,\nhe more than met her expectations. Taken with the young man, Khadija followed by\nsuggesting marriage. Though her proposal was unusual\u2014she was fifteen years older\nthan Muhammad\u2014he accepted. The two thereafter enjoyed a strong, loving\nrelationship, and prospered under Muhammad\u2019s deft handling of the family business.27\nThus, by his late twenties, Muhammad had risen to a position of comfort, and\nrespect. Indeed, he held such a high reputation as a capable, forthright, and honest\nman, that he was frequently called upon to mediate commercial and social disputes in\nMecca. In short, he had arrived.28\nHe may have found personal success, but he was increasingly troubled by the\nchanges that Mecca was experiencing at that time. Recalling his experience as an\norphan, he could not help but to contrast the more-and-more sumptuous lifestyle of\nMecca\u2019s leading families with the increasingly hard circumstances of the city\u2019s many\nimpoverished orphans and widows and to wonder how poverty could have increased\nduring a period of economic growth. After pondering the issue for some time, he\nconcluded that the rise in inequality and the rapid growth of the economy were related;\nthat is, the wealth pouring into the city was leading its people to abandon the muruwah\ncode's emphasis on generosity and protection of the weak in favor of selfishness and\ngreed. How else could he explain how some lived in opulence while others suffered in\npoverty, or, like many orphans, endured malnourishment?29\nMuhammad was very perceptive. He had correctly discerned that the economic\nchanges that accompanied the revival of commerce in the Hijaz had grievously\nweakened the bonds that had heretofore tied clans together. Gone were the older ethics\nof egalitarianism and group cohesion embodied in the muruwah code\u2014values that had\nensured not only that the tribe survived but also that the strong cared for the weak. In\ntheir place, the merchants of Mecca instead lived by the values of individualism and\nacquisitiveness. As a result, the city had become a profoundly unequal place, one\n26 Jonathan A. C. Brown, Muhammad: A Very Short Introduction (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2011), 8\u201310.\n27 Armstrong, Muhammad, 25\u201326.\n28 Cole, Muhammad, 5\u20138, 28\u201329; Armstrong, Muhammad, 25\u201326.\n29 Karen Armstrong, Islam: A Short History (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 3. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 18\nstarkly divided between a tiny number of rich families and a growing mass of\nimpoverished ones.30\nRevelation\nDeeply disturbed by these changes, he began visiting the nearby Cave of Hira\nduring the month of Ramadan where he ruminated over the problems that beset his city\nand considered possible solutions. These meditative sessions had enormous\nconsequences. As Muhammad later claimed, it was during one of them in 610 CE that\nthe angel Gabriel first demanded that he recite God\u2019s word. Described at the start of this\nchapter, this experience deeply shook him. Despairing that he had lost his sanity or\nbeen possessed by a desert spirit known as a jinni, he rushed back to Mecca in distress\nseeking the counsel and comfort of his wife, Khadija. She consoled him and reassured\nhim that he was not mad; why, she argued, would God inflict such a punishment on so\nhonest and upstanding a person as him? Still, despite her reassuring words, he\ncontinued to feel troubled. Accordingly, she sent for her Christian cousin Waraqa (?-\n610). Impressed by Muhammad\u2019s description of his meeting with the Angel Gabriel, an\nelated Waraqa declared that Muhammad should rejoice for \u201c\u2018thou art the prophet of this\npeople.\u2019\u201d31\nThe Early Community of Believers\nHeartened by Waraqa\u2019s words, Muhammad began to spread his message. At\nfirst, he limited his preaching to a small group of close family members and friends.\nFollowing Khadija, who had accepted his message from the start, his young cousin Ali\nIbn Talib (601-661), his merchant friend and first caliph, or successor of Muhammad,\nAbu Bakr (c. 573-634), an Ethiopian slave named Bilal (c. 580-640), the future third\ncaliph, Uthman ibn Affan (c. 579-656), and a few others adopted Islam. By late 613,\nperhaps fifty people\u2014a disproportionate number of whom were the sons and daughters\nof Mecca\u2019s economic elite\u2014had joined his fledgling movement.32\nWhy did they choose to follow Muhammad? What caused them to abandon the\nreligious beliefs of their families? They did so because they shared his disdain for the\ngrowing inequality and exploitation that had become commonplace in Mecca during its\neconomic recovery. In other words, they joined his fledgling movement because the\ncore message that he articulated\u2014that God was a good deity who loved humanity, who\ndenounced inequitable business practices such as usury, and who demanded not just\nthat the rich cease exploiting the poor but that they affirmatively help the unfortunate\u2014\npowerfully resonated with them and their desire to reform Meccan society.33\n30 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 33\u201334, 40\u201341.\n31 Quoted in Esposito, Islam, 8.\n32 Esposito, 9; Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 42.\n33 Armstrong, Muhammad, 42\u201343, 53\u201354. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 19\nEven after he began to preach publicly, the elite clans of the Quraysh tribe\nlargely ignored Muhammad. They did not care for his calls for egalitarianism or\ndemands for social justice; after all, leading clans like Banu Makhzum and Banu\nUmayya had grown wealthy under the prevailing economic system and any effort to\nachieve social justice and egalitarianism would inevitably come at their expense. Given\nthe tiny size of Muhammad\u2019s following and its marginal impact on Meccan society,\nhowever, they concluded that he could be safely ignored.34\nBy the mid 610s, however, changes in Muhammad\u2019s message and his growing\nsuccess at gaining followers led his opponents to take a dimmer view of the nascent\nMuslim movement. Two issues in particular raised their hackles. First, starting in 613,\nMuhammad began to argue more explicitly that there existed only one God and that the\nthree-hundred-and-sixty idols that the Arabs worshipped in the Ka\u02bfba were mere pieces\nof wood or stone representative of nothing. The leaders of the dominant clans in Mecca\nviewed this claim as a serious threat to their future prosperity. Were the Arab people to\naccept his message, they would no longer come to Mecca for the annual hajj or take\npart in the accompanying trade that was so essential to the city\u2019s ongoing economic\nwell-being. Second, Muhammad was winning more-and-more converts to his faith.\nCharismatic and well respected, he had an appealing message and was steadily\nincreasing the size of the Muslim community. His success in gaining followers would not\nin itself have posed a huge problem; however, the conversions were dividing families\nbetween ardent Muslims and bitter opponents of Islam and thus causing clan ties\u2014\nwhich the scholar Jonathan Brown argues \u201cwere the one real institution in Arab\nsociety\u201d\u2014to fray dangerously. Thus, to the Quraysh elite, Muhammad was a serious\nthreat to both their continued prosperity and the stability of the community\u2014one, they\nincreasingly concluded, that they would need to eliminate.35\nFor the time being, however, critics of Islam could not move directly against\nMuhammad. The issue was his family connections. Though the head of the Hashimite\nclan, Abu Talib, never himself became a Muslim, he did extend formal clan protection to\nMuhammad. Accordingly, were his opponents to kill Muhammad, they would initiate a\nblood feud that would likely go on for years and that would, in the process, surely\ndisrupt the trade on which their status and wealth rested. Muhammad\u2019s enemies\nconsequently refrained from attacking him directly and instead responded to his\nchallenge by imposing an economic boycott on the Muslims and by targeting those\namong his following who did not enjoy the backing of the Hashimite clan or who were of\nlow social rank. Enslaved Muslims confronted the greatest pressure. Many, such as the\nEthiopian slave Bilal (580-640), endured torture and at least one, a woman named\nSumayya (c. 550-615), was killed.36\nCircumstances dramatically worsened for Muhammad and the Muslim\ncommunity in 619\u2014a year so grim that Muslims refer to it as the Year of Sadness. Two\n34 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 42.\n35 Brown, Muhammad, 17.\n36 Cole, Muhammad, 59\u201363. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 20\ndeaths were responsible for their change of fortune. First, the death of Abu Talib\nresulted in Muhammad\u2019s uncle Abu Lahab (c. 549-624) becoming the head of the\nHashimite clan. A bitter opponent of Islam, Abu Lahab promptly removed the protection\nthat his brother had heretofore granted to Muhammad and the Muslims\u2014thus leaving\nthem exposed and vulnerable. Next, just a few months later, Khadija passed away. Her\ndeath robbed Muhammad of his emotional lodestone and denied him the critical advice\nthat she had long provided. Her passing and the death of Abu Talib depressed\nMuhammad, and, more importantly, put him and his followers in an increasingly tenuous\nposition. Indeed, it soon became clear that he and his fellow Muslims faced not just\nsteadily rising persecution but\u2014far worse\u2014the outright destruction of their movement.37\nThe Hijra\nAfter three hard years of growing persecution at the hands of Mecca\u2019s leading\nfamilies, the Muslims finally found deliverance in 622. Their salvation came as a result\nof a growing conflict in the Hijazi town of Yathrib. A sprawling date-farming community\nlocated about 340 kilometers north of Mecca, Yathrib was home to five tribes: two\npagan-Arab ones and three ethnically Arab but religiously Jewish tribes. For several\nyears, the two pagan tribes, the Khazraj and the Aws, had been locked in a destructive\nfeud that had gradually intensified to the point that, by 621, it had become a serious\nthreat to the stability of the settlement. Desperate to keep the peace, the tribal leaders\nof the town met and agreed to seek outside mediation that could end the conflict before\nit destroyed their community. They quickly settled on Muhammad. With a reputation for\nwisdom and integrity, he seemed like the ideal person to resolve the intertribal vendetta.\nThe assembled leaders consequently sent a delegation to Mecca to ask him to come to\nYathrib and arbitrate the feud. In exchange, they offered to let the Muslims relocate to\ntheir town. It was doubtless a bittersweet proposal for Muhammad. Though he was\nsurely loath to leave the city of his birth, he saw no other way to ensure the survival of\nhis struggling community. Accordingly, he agreed to the terms of the delegation\u2019s\nproposal.38\nRelocating would prove to be challenging, however. As Muhammad well knew,\nthe Arab commitment to familial and clan bonds meant that his opponents would bitterly\nresist any attempt by their Muslim relatives to leave Mecca. The Muslims would thus\nhave to make the move in a way that would not arouse suspicion. To do so, Muhammad\narranged for the Muslims to gradually relocate in small, discreet groups of three or four\nover several months rather than en masse. To further allay suspicion, he himself\nplanned to remain in Mecca until nearly all of his followers had slipped out of the city. It\nwas a wise and ultimately successful strategy. Over several months, nearly the entire\n37 Brown, Muhammad, 22.\n38 Fred Donner, Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam (Cambridge, MA:\nThe Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012), 43\u201344. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 21\nMuslim community quietly moved to Yathrib. Eventually, the only believers who\nremained in Mecca were Ali, Abu Bakr, and Muhammad himself.39\nAs Muhammad grasped, this approach was a risky one. Without the protection of\nhis followers, he would be dangerously exposed in Mecca and thus vulnerable to his\nenemies. He was right to fear for his safety. The leading families had in fact devised a\nplan in which they would take advantage of his growing isolation and lack of protection\nto kill him in his sleep. Fortunately for Muhammad, he caught wind of the plot before it\nwent into effect. To counter it, he arranged for Ali to distract his enemies by pretending\nto be him\u2014Ali went so far as to sleep in his bed\u2014while he and Abu Bakr sneaked out of\nMecca. The scheme worked. Ali drew the attention of Muhammad\u2019s pursuers long\nenough for Abu Bakr and Muhammad to slip out of the city to safety. Later, after\nMuhammad had reached Yathrib, Ali quietly left Mecca and rejoined him and the other\nMuslims there.40\nCalled the hijra, the migration to Yathrib\u2014which was thereafter known as\nMedina, or the \u201ccity of the prophet\u201d\u2014proved vital to the growth and success of Islam.\nIndeed, Muhammad and his companions saw it as so pivotal that they devised a new,\nMuslim calendar in which 622 CE became year one. This interpretation of the hijra\u2019s\nsignificance was not mere hyperbole. Indeed, in two critical ways, the move to Medina\nconstituted the central event in Islam\u2019s development. First, it saved the fledgling religion\nfrom destruction at the hands of its enemies. Had the Muslims remained in Mecca, their\nmovement would have almost certainly collapsed in the face of the leading clans\u2019\nincreasingly staunch opposition. Second\u2014and perhaps more important\u2014the hijra\nmarked the full repudiation of pre-Islamic Arabia\u2019s clan- and tribe-based social system.\nIn its place, the Muslims established a new and far-broader form of identity, the umma,\nor community of believers, defined not by ties of kinship but instead by a shared set of\nreligious beliefs. The move to Yathrib thus constituted a sea change in how its members\nsaw themselves\u2014\u201ca revolutionary step,\u201d in the writer Karen Armstrong\u2019s words, that\nmade Muhammad the \u201chead of a collection of tribal groups that were not bound together\nby blood but by a shared ideology, an astonishing innovation in Arabian society.\u201d41\nWhile the Muslims constituted a narrowly religious movement while they were in\nMecca, they transformed into a broader, religious-and-political community in Medina.\nMuhammad confirmed this change when he issued the Constitution of Medina shortly\nafter he arrived. At its most basic level, the pact established the political and social\nfoundations of his new community. It defined the relationship between the Muhajirun,\nthe Muslims who accompanied Muhammad from Mecca, and the Ansar or \u201chelpers,\u201d\nthose Medinans who had converted to Islam, and it put an end once and for all to the\nfeud between the Aws and the Khazraj. It also established Muhammad as the leader of\nMedina and outlined the basic laws that would govern the umma. On a more\nfundamental level, it also refined the nature of Islam and set expectations about how its\n39 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 48\u201349.\n40 Brown, Muhammad, 26.\n41 Armstrong, Islam, 14. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 22\nadherents were to live. In particular, it made clear that the religion\u2019s main focus was not\non the salvation of the individual, though that was important, but instead on the\nconstruction of a community along the lines that God had revealed to Muhammad.42\nThe religion evolved rapidly in Medina. Beyond the changes he effected through\nthe Constitution of Medina, Muhammad also established the basic structure of Islamic\nworship and articulated a number of new Qur\u02beanic verses. Stressing the core elements\nof his message\u2014the unity of God, the value of community, and the importance of social\njustice\u2014these revelations included a broad array of legal rulings aimed at creating a\nrevolutionary new society based on equity and the worship of the one God. These new\nlaws included improvements in the legal status of women, the institution of a tax on\nwealth\u2014the zakat\u2014designed to provide charity for the indigent, and the prohibition of\nusury, or the lending of money at interest. Muhammad also had the first mosque\nconstructed so that the Muslims could pray as a single, unified community in imitation of\nthe unity of God.43\nThe community that Muhammad established in Medina would loom large in the\nimagination of subsequent generations of Muslims. Put simply, it would thereafter\nconstitute in the eyes of the faithful the model of the ideal Islamic polity. Indeed, as we\nshall see, when Muslims later confronted serious problems or when they believed that\nIslam had lost its way, they frequently concluded that the community of believers could\nbest respond by eschewing new social practices and innovations in favor of a return to\nthe ethics, values, and laws of the early umma as it existed in Medina under\nMuhammad\u2019s leadership.\nWar With Mecca\nThat future generations of Muslims would idealize the early community of\nbelievers in Medina did nothing to help the Muhajirun address the significant challenges\nthat they faced in the present. They found life in their new home challenging to say the\nleast. Though welcomed by a large portion of the Medinans\u2014most of the town\u2019s\npolytheistic Arabs converted to Islam shortly after Muhammad\u2019s arrival\u2014the Meccans\nnonetheless confronted a great deal of both overt and latent hostility in their adopted\nhome. Many of the Ansar, particularly the leaders who had been compelled to cede\npolitical power, nursed deep grudges against Muhammad and the Meccan immigrants.\nThe Jewish tribes also resented his political dominance of Medina and mocked him for\nwhat they saw as his poor understanding of the Abrahamic faith. More immediately, the\nMuhajirun faced the fundamental problem of securing food and other necessities. They\nhad moved from a city with a trade-based economy to a farming settlement that\nrevolved around date-palm cultivation. Lacking agricultural skills, they had no means of\nsustaining themselves in Medina and could hardly expect to survive on the charity of the\nAnsar. Muhammad thus found himself caught in a predicament even at this moment of\ngenuine success. That is, while he had succeeded in establishing himself as the head of\n42 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 55\u201359.\n43 Armstrong, Islam, 14\u201315; Brown, Muhammad, 29. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 23\nthe umma, he simultaneously had to find some way to sustain the Muhajirun\u2014and\nfast\u2014or he would risk seeing his fledgling community quickly fall apart.44\nDesperation soon led him to a solution. Aware that his community of merchants\nand shopkeepers were in no position to provide for themselves through farming,\nMuhammad began leading ghazu against Quraysh-owned caravans travelling between\nMecca and Syria. These attacks proved to be enormously successful right from the\nstart. The Muslim raiders were able to seize more than enough goods from the Meccans\nto sustain the umma and thus ensured that the community of believers would survive\nduring what proved to be its most trying period.45\nAt the same time, the raids created new problems for the umma. Heretofore, the\nQuraysh had left Muhammad\u2019s followers unmolested in Medina; infuriated by the raids,\nhowever, they were now determined to crush his fighters in battle once and for all.\nAccordingly, in 624, they sent a large punitive expedition north with plans to defeat the\nMuslims. Muhammad rose to the bait, and the two sides met in battle just outside the\nsmall town of Badr. Though the Meccan army decisively outnumbered Muhammad\u2019s\nforce, it failed to defeat the Muslims. On the contrary, Muhammad\u2019s well-disciplined\ntroops won a clear victory in which they compelled the Meccan soldiers to retreat with\nsubstantial losses. The battle marked an important turning point for Muhammad and the\nfledgling community of believers. The triumph over such long odds seemed to\ndemonstrate that he was a capable military leader and that the umma was a rising force\nin the region; perhaps more importantly, it also suggested that Muhammad enjoyed\ndivine support and that he truly was God\u2019s messenger. As a consequence, the victory at\nBadr allowed him to strengthen his hold over Medina and led a growing number of\nbedouin tribes to throw in their lot with him over the following months.46\nIn spite of this triumph, the next few years proved to be difficult ones for the\numma. In 625, an army of 3,000 Meccan soldiers avenged the defeat at Badr by routing\nMuhammad\u2019s 1,000-strong force at the Battle of Uhud. It was a significant setback. The\nMuslims suffered substantial casualties, and only the Meccan army\u2019s failure to exploit its\nadvantage permitted the survivors to escape. Nonetheless, Muhammad remained\nundaunted. Despite the defeat at Uhud, he and his troops continued to harass Meccan\nsoldiers and to raid Quraysh caravans as they headed to and from Syria.47\nIncreasingly frustrated with Muslim attacks, the Quraysh decided that the time\nhad come to destroy the umma once and for all. Accordingly, in 627, they raised an\narmy of 10,000 soldiers composed of both Meccan troops and the city\u2019s bedouin allies\nand set out to crush the Muslims. Muhammad\u2019s force had grown in size over the\npreceding two years, but it had no hope of defeating the vast Meccan host in open\nbattle. Only by finding some way to offset the Meccans\u2019 huge numerical advantage\n44 Armstrong, Islam, 17\u201319.\n45 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 45\u201346.\n46 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 35\u201336.\n47 Brown, Muhammad, 33\u201334. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 24\ncould Muhammad possibly spare the umma from certain destruction. Once more, he\nrose to the challenge. To even the odds, he ordered the Muslims to dig a deep trench\naround Medina that would prevent the Meccan cavalry from being able to attack the\ntown. The tactic worked brilliantly. Though they enjoyed the support of the Qurayza, one\nof Medina\u2019s Jewish tribes, the Quraysh and their bedouin allies could not find a way to\nforce their way across the trench, and they eventually had to abandon the siege in\ndisarray.48\nIn two ways, the victory in the Battle of the Trench marked a critical turning point\nfor Muhammad and the umma. First, the triumph allowed him to solidify his control of\nMedina. On the advice of one of the Ansar leaders, he imposed the standard seventh-\ncentury Arab penalty for treason on the Qurayza tribe immediately following the battle;\nthat is, he ordered his followers to execute the men of the tribe and to sell the women\nand children into slavery. Thereafter, he no longer faced any organized resistance to his\nrule in Medina. Second, his victory over the huge Meccan army dramatically elevated\nhis standing as a successful military leader throughout the region and seemed to\nsuggest to a growing number of Arabs that he enjoyed God\u2019s favor just as he claimed.\nIn response, many bedouin tribes converted to Islam and joined Muhammad\u2019s cause,\nthereby swelling both the size of the umma and the number of fighters in his now-\nsubstantial military. By the end of 628, as a result, he had the most powerful military\nforce in the Hijaz\u2014one so strong that he was now in a position to seize control of\nMecca.49\nMuhammad was not interested in taking Mecca by force, however. Instead, he\nhoped to bring it under his control peacefully. To do so, he devised a complicated plan\nthat began when he announced that he intended to lead 1,000 Muslims on a pilgrimage\nto the Ka\u02bfba in 628. On the surface, it seemed like a foolhardy proposal. As pilgrims, he\nand his followers would be traveling to Mecca unarmed and would thus be vulnerable to\nattack. In fact, it was a shrewd move that caught his Quraysh enemies in a bind. As\nboth Muhammad and Mecca\u2019s frustrated leaders grasped, attacking the Muslims during\nthe hajj would not only imperil the Quraysh tribe\u2019s status as the guardians of the Ka\u02bfba\nbut would also cost it what little support it still retained in the Hijaz.50\nMuhammad\u2019s gambit worked. As he had foreseen, the Quraysh did not attack the\nMuslims. Instead, desperate to impose some conditions on Muhammad in order to\navoid further embarrassment and the defection of yet more of the city\u2019s bedouin allies to\nhis side, they sent a delegation to negotiate with him at a place just outside Mecca\ncalled Hudaybiyyah. There, the Quraysh representatives proposed a peace treaty that\ncalled for an end to the war between Mecca and Medina and for the Muslims to return\n48 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 39.\n49 Armstrong, Islam, 20\u201321.\n50 Cole, Muhammad, 152\u201357. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 25\nimmediately to their homes; in exchange, Muhammad and his followers could return the\nfollowing year to take part in the hajj.51\nMany of his followers blanched at accepting what they viewed as a one-sided\ndeal. After all, the umma was the rising power while the Quraysh were in eclipse. Intent\non taking Mecca peacefully, Muhammad nonetheless agreed to the terms of the\nproposal. His decision proved to be a wise one. When he and his followers returned in\n629 for the hajj, their faith and discipline greatly impressed the people of the city. As a\nresult, the opposition to him began to melt away.52\nMuhammad Victorious\nIt disappeared completely the following year. Using a Quraysh attack on a client\ntribe as a pretext, Muhammad advanced on Mecca at the head of an army of 10,000\nsoldiers. His troops faced no organized opposition. Instead, the people of the city\nwatched passively as the Muslims occupied Mecca, cleansed the Ka\u02bfba of the pagan\nidols, and added the city to Muhammad\u2019s rapidly growing empire.53\nThree factors explain the Quraysh tribes\u2019 failure to resist Muhammad. First, by\n630, the balance of forces in the Hijaz had swung so heavily toward the Muslims that\nfurther opposition was futile. Second, Muhammad had made an important concession to\nthe tribe\u2019s commercial interests. Aware of the economic significance of the traditional\npagan pilgrimage, he replaced it with a new, Islamic hajj that required all Muslims to visit\nMecca at least once in their lives; he thus ensured that the Quraysh would continue to\nprofit from the arrival of pilgrims and from the trade in which they engaged. Finally,\nMuhammad made clear that he did not come to Mecca seeking vengeance against\nthose who had persecuted the Muslims over the prior two decades. Instead, save for a\nfew cases involving diehard enemies of Islam, he treated his old persecutors with\nstartling mildness. This approach proved doubly effective. Not only did it discourage the\nMeccans from resisting his army when it marched on the city, but it also led many of his\nformer tormentors\u2014including Banu Umayya head Abu Sufyan, (c. 565-c. 653)\u2014to\nconvert to Islam.54\nHaving defeated the most powerful tribe in the Hijaz, Muhammad was now well\npositioned to extend his writ to all of Arabia. Over the next two years, he directed a\nseries of triumphal military campaigns that saw his forces subdue the town of Taif and\nquell the few other remaining centers of organized opposition to Islam. These victories\nfurther cemented his standing among the Arabs. Understood by many to be a sign of\ndivine favor, his continued success spurred most of the bedouin tribes that remained\noutside his control to accept both his suzerainty and, with some important exceptions,\nhis religion. By 632, as a result, Muhammad had secured control of the entire Arabian\n51 Cole, 152\u201357.\n52 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 41\u201342.\n53 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 167.\n54 Armstrong, Islam, 22\u201323. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 26\npeninsula. The consequences of this achievement were enormous. He had not merely\njoined the Arabs together into a single, socio-religious community\u2014a significant\naccomplishment in its own right\u2014but had, in the process, also replaced the tribal\nconflict that had characterized the region for centuries with a new era of intertribal\npeace This was a signal achievement and one, as we shall see in the next chapter,\nwhich would have enormous consequences.55\nMuhammad was unable to enjoy the fruits of his victory, however. Soon after\nreturning to Medina from the hajj in 632, he fell ill and retired to the home of one of his\nwives, \u02bfA\u02beisha (c. 603-678). Abu Bakr, the man who had helped Muhammad escape to\nMedina during the hijra in 622, replaced the prophet as the prayer leader in the mosque\non what he hoped would be a temporary basis. Muhammad did not recover, however.\nTo the despair of the umma, he instead grew steadily sicker for several weeks before\nfinally passing away. The Muslims thus faced the challenge of determining how to\nproceed without their leader\u2014a prospect rendered all the more daunting by virtue of the\nfact that Muhammad had failed to leave instructions indicating who should replace him\nor even how the community should choose a successor.56\nA Brief Overview of Islam\nSo what were the characteristics, tenets, and values of the religion that\nMuhammad bequeathed to the Arab people? In broadest terms, as we have seen, early\nIslam stressed three overarching themes: monotheism, social justice, and community.\nCoupled with the practical necessities related to the administration of a growing state\u2014\nlike Moses, after all, Muhammad was both a political leader and a religious figure\u2014\nthese three central beliefs would inform all aspects of the faith.\nMuhammad the Reformer\nTo be clear, first, Muhammad never claimed to be creating a new religion. On the\ncontrary, he maintained that he was only seeking to purify and renew an older faith that\nhad lost its way. This was evident in his description of the relationship between Islam\nand the other two Abrahamic religions: Judaism and Christianity. According to\nMuhammad, God had long ago revealed the Abrahamic religion to humanity through a\nsuccession of prophets including Moses and Jesus. For reasons of self-interest,\nhowever, spiritual and secular leaders had perverted God's revelation at different points\nin the past by incorporating into it innovations such as the Trinity. As such, he\nmaintained, Christianity and Judaism were theologically corrupted offshoots of the older,\nmonotheistic religion. Meanwhile, some groups that had once followed the Abrahamic\nfaith\u2014including the Arabs\u2014had subsequently become estranged from it and had\nabandoned it in favor of a return to polytheism. God had not forsaken those whom\npriests had led astray or who had taken up the false idols of polytheism, however.\nInstead, to bring humanity back into the light of the true religion, He had chosen\n55 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 49\u201350.\n56 Brown, Muhammad, 61\u201363. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 27\nMuhammad to serve as His final messenger and had tasked him with bringing His\ndivine plan to humanity for the last time\u2014thereby restoring and purifying the one true\nmonotheistic faith.57\nThe Qur\u02bean\nThat perfect plan was outlined in Islam\u2019s holy book: the Qur\u02bean. According to\nMuhammad, God revealed the Qur\u02bean to him through the Angel Gabriel over a period of\ntwenty-three years. He maintained that it was the literal Word of God\u2014an earthly copy\nof the eternal and uncreated Heavenly Qur\u02bean. It also marked the culmination of God\u2019s\nrevelation. That is, God had previously shown humanity elements of His message\nthrough the Torah, the Psalms, and the Gospels; the Qur\u02bean, however, was the final,\nperfect, and most important revelation. Slightly shorter than the New Testament, it\nconsists of one-hundred-and-fourteen sura, or chapters, arranged in order from longest\nto shortest. Individual suras were copied down or memorized while Muhammad was\nalive. However, a canonical, written version of the Qur\u02bean was only created during the\nreign of Uthman, the third caliph.58\nMonotheism, Community, and Social Justice\nThe Qur\u02bean outlines a religion that is stridently monotheistic. Islam then and now\nemphasizes tawhid, a concept that denotes the oneness and unity of God and that\nproclaims forthrightly that He has no partners. Indeed, the Qur\u02bean explicitly rejects both\npolytheism and the Christian concept of the Trinity: \u201cSay, \u2018He is God, the One. God, the\nAbsolute. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none comparable to Him\u2019\u201d\n(Qur\u02bean 112). The Qur\u02bean also characterizes God as an eternal and all-powerful being\nwho is actively managing the universe, and it describes Him as loving and as al-\nRahman, or merciful. God\u2019s benevolence was not absolute, however. Like Christianity,\nIslam holds that there will be a final reckoning during which all humans will be judged for\ntheir actions on earth. Those who had submitted to the divine will would spend an\neternity in the blissful Garden of Paradise; those who had refused to accept Him or who\nhad failed to abide by His law would instead burn in a fiery hell.59\nThe emphasis on monotheism and the unity of God permeated Muhammad's\nthinking and had enormous consequences for Islam. Perhaps most obviously, it shaped\nhis conception of how the community of believers should be structured. Just as God\nwas unified, so would be the umma. To ensure that it was, he preached that humans\nwere to live in a certain type of society and that they were to adhere to a set of laws that\nexplicitly called on them to engage in some actions and to refrain from others. God\nrequired not just that individual adherents abide by these standards, moreover, but that\n57 Armstrong, Islam, 8.\n58 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 59; Daniel G. Bates and Amal Rassam,\nPeoples and Cultures of the Middle East, 2nd edition (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice\nHall, 2000), 52\u201353.\n59 Armstrong, Muhammad, 49, 62. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 28\nthe umma act collectively to ensure that the entire community behaved according to His\nmoral code. As the Qur\u02bean states: \"You are the best community evolved for mankind,\nenjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong\" (Qur\u02bean 3:110). Individual salvation\nwas important, in other words, but, from the very start, the religion that Muhammad\noutlined was explicitly communal in nature.60\nMuch of the communitarian aspects of Islam were aimed at achieving social\njustice. As earlier noted, Muhammad was deeply disturbed by the Meccans\u2019 rejection of\nthe muruwah code and its requirement that the rich and powerful care for the poor and\nweak. As we have seen, he was particularly troubled by the growing insecurity and\ndifficult circumstances that confronted widows and orphans in a society that was based\non kin relations. Absent strong family connections, such people were all-but-inevitably\ndestined to a life of grinding poverty and, in many cases, enslavement. Accordingly, the\nQur\u02bean imposed a variety of socioeconomic requirements on the umma designed to\nensure that it redistributed wealth to impoverished people and that it protected the\nweak. It outright banned usury, false contracts, and bribery, and it explicitly required the\njust treatment of widows and orphans. More broadly, it made plain that those who\naccumulated wealth had an obligation to share some of their good fortune with the\npoor.61\nWomen\nMuhammad paid particular attention to improving the position of women in Arab\nsociety. The life of women in pre-Islamic Arabia was difficult. Effectively chattel owned\neither by their husbands or fathers, they enjoyed neither legal protections nor the right\nof divorce and were utterly dependent on male relatives for their well-being. Married\nwomen did not even control the money or goods that their parents provided as a dowry;\non the contrary, that wealth became the property of their husbands. They also had no\nlegal claim to inherit either their husband\u2019s estate or the dowry they brought into the\nmarriage. If a widowed woman was young, one of her relations would likely marry her in\norder to acquire the deceased\u2019s property including the dowry; if she was deemed too\nold, however, the widow and her dowry would instead become the property of her\nhusband\u2019s clan, and she would be dependent upon it for her survival. Thus, widows\u2014of\nwhom there were many in the harsh environment of pre-Islamic Arabia\u2014were often left\ndestitute and unprotected.62\nMuhammad dramatically changed this state of affairs. The Qur\u02bean included\nspecific language granting women the right to end marriages even as it placed new\nlimits on divorce for men and restricted the number of wives that they could have. It also\ngave women the right to inherit property and, importantly, granted them control over\ntheir dowry\u2014thus permitting them to take it with them in the event of divorce. These\nreforms markedly improved the legal position of women in Arabia. Thereafter, widowed\n60 Esposito, Islam, 31\u201332.\n61 Esposito, 32\u201333.\n62 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 61\u201362. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 29\nwomen were far less likely to be without some means of material support and those who\nhad abusive husbands could end their marriages without losing their dowries. We must\nkeep the extent of Muhammad\u2019s reforms in this area in perspective, of course. He did\nnot grant women equivalent legal status to men, and the changes he effected failed to\nemancipate them fully. They continued to inherit only a portion of their husbands\u2019\nwealth, for example, and their divorce rights were significantly more restricted than\nthose that men enjoyed. Still, in comparison to the legal standing of women in other\ncontemporary societies, Muhammad\u2019s reforms were nothing short of revolutionary.\nIndeed, women in much of Christian Europe would not win equivalently robust divorce\nand dowry rights until the nineteenth century.63\nTwo topics regarding women that receive a great deal of attention in the\ncontemporary West merit further discussion: veiling and polygamy. The Qur\u02bean explicitly\nendorsed the practice of polygamy, stipulating that a man could have as many as four\nwives. \u201cIf ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women\nof your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly\n(with them), then only [marry] one\u201d (Qur\u02bean, 3:4). As this passage suggests, one should\nnot interpret formal Muslim validation of polygamy as a blanket affirmation of the\npractice. Instead, it is best understood as a limited endorsement that reflected the\nculture and circumstances in which the umma found itself in the 620s. 64\nIndeed, two political realities proved paramount in leading Muhammad to\nendorse polygamy. First, at that time, powerful men\u2014particularly tribal leaders\u2014\ndemonstrated their authority and success by having multiple wives. It was a practice\nthat frequently put women in a tenuous situation. If a man could not maintain all of his\nwives, he might sell one or more into slavery or prostitution. Focused as he was on\nsocial justice, Muhammad found the tribal chiefs\u2019 practice of demonstrating status\nthrough multiple marriages off putting and viewed the sale of wives as outright\nrepugnant. However, he also understood that he was not in a position to oppose\npolygamy lest he alienate the tribal chiefs on whose support the success of his war with\nMecca depended. Accordingly, he bent to prevailing custom and formally sanctioned the\npractice of political leaders taking multiple wives. He himself married a number of\nwomen as part of a successful effort to bind certain key tribal leaders to him through\npolitical marriages. At the same time, however, he discouraged polygamy by limiting\nmen to no more than four wives and by permitting them to take multiple spouses only if\nthey could afford to do so\u2014thereby making clear that he was not offering a blanket\nendorsement of the practice.65\nSecond, Muhammad\u2019s approval of polygamy reflected his larger message of\nsocial justice and the peculiar needs of the early umma. While successful, the war with\nMecca had produced substantial casualties among his male followers and had thus\nresulted in a surge in the number of widows and orphans among the believers. This\n63 Esposito, Islam, 119\u201321.\n64 Armstrong, Islam, 16.\n65 Esposito, Islam, 116\u201319. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 30\nsituation posed a serious challenge for Muhammad. How could the still tiny and\nimpoverished umma ensure the well-being of the many women and children who had\nlost their husbands or fathers in the conflict? Polygamy provided the answer. Muslim\nmen who were already married would take additional wives from among the women\nwho had lost their husbands in the fighting, thus ensuring that they and their children\nenjoyed material support. Indeed, it was only after the disastrous Battle of Uhud, an\nengagement in which many Muslim men had died, that Muhammad shared Verse 3:4\nwith the community of believers and thus encouraged polygamy. Muhammad himself\nset an example for this practice when he married the widow Sawdah\u2014who was past the\ncustomary age for marriage and thus otherwise unlikely to get remarried\u2014to ensure that\nshe and her children were adequately cared for.66\nIn contrast to polygamy, the practice of veiling was not the product of Islamic\nteaching. The Qur\u02bean did mandate that women dress chastely, declaring: \u201cthat they\nshould . . . guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments\nexcept what (must ordinarily) appear thereof,\u201d and it explicitly called for Muhammad\u2019s\nwives to seclude and veil themselves (Qur\u02bean 24:31). At no point did it stipulate that\nother Muslim women must cover their heads, however, and it most certainly did not\ninclude any passages requiring that they be attired in clothing such as the burqa.\nInstead, as most scholars now agree, veiling was an upper-class Persian and Byzantine\ncustom that Muslim women only adopted several generations after Muhammad had\ndied. Indeed, the very variety of veiling in the Muslim world today\u2014the niqab in Saudi\nArabia, the hijab in Egypt, the burqa in Afghanistan\u2014indicates that the practice reflects\nlocal cultural values rather than a common, Qur\u02beanic obligation.67\nAs the institutionalization of veiling as a Muslim custom in the century after\nMuhammad suggests, the revolutionary changes to gender relations that he effected did\nnot endure. What happened? In a nutshell, the patriarchy reasserted itself. During the\nimmediate generations following Muhammad, longstanding notions that God had\npredestined men to run society and had assigned women to a subordinate position led\npeople to reinterpret Muhammad's views. As we shall see in chapter four, men were\nable to gradually chip away at the prophet\u2019s reforms and eventually succeeded in\nreinstating many patriarchal pre-Islamic customs in the decades after his death. As a\nresult, within just a few generations, women would lose nearly all of the rights that they\nhad gained in the first years of the umma.68\njihad\nThe exigencies of the early umma that helped spur Muhammad to accept\npolygamy shaped Islam in other important ways as well. As previously noted,\nMuhammad was both a religious prophet and a political leader who\u2014unlike Jesus or\nJohn the Baptist but like Moses\u2014oversaw a political community and was thus tasked\n66 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 64.\n67 Armstrong, Islam, 16.\n68 Esposito, Islam, 121\u201324. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 31\nwith making the difficult and often morally ambiguous decisions that are incumbent on\nsecular rulers. He did so under particularly trying circumstance. As we have seen, for a\nbrief but critical period, the community he led confronted an existential challenge from\nthe Quraysh tribe of Mecca. As a consequence, Muhammad frequently took actions and\narticulated values based on the umma\u2019s immediate needs; for example, his execution of\nthe Jewish men of the Qurayza tribe after the Battle of the Trench reflected his belief\nthat he needed to eliminate a dangerous fifth column in order to ensure his movement\u2019s\nsurvival.\nThe practical needs of the early umma likewise shaped the idea of jihad, or, more\nproperly as we shall see in a moment, lesser jihad. Jihad, or warfare waged in defense\nof the faith, was very much a product of the umma\u2019s perilous circumstances in the 620s,\nand it reflected Muhammad\u2019s need both to justify the war with Mecca and to establish a\nset of rules regulating how his soldiers would wage that conflict. In other words, jihad\nemerged as a Muslim version of the Christian doctrine of Just War that St. Augustine\n(354-430) had articulated in the fifth century. Like Augustine\u2019s, Muhammad\u2019s notion of\njust war required armies to refrain from attacking noncombatants and demanded that\nany conflict be defensive in nature. Indeed, the Qur\u02bean explicitly holds that \u201c[p]ermission\nto fight is only given to those who have been oppressed\u201d (Qur\u02bean 22:39).69\nJust as later religious scholars would roll back the reforms Muhammad had\nobtained for women, so would they distort jihad to justify aggressive military action. This\nchange began shortly after Mohammed died. In the early 630s, Muslim leaders and\nreligious scholars reinterpreted the concept of jihad to legitimize the Arab conquest of\nthe Persian Empire and the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt. Later, they divided\nthe world into Dar al-Islam, or the House of Peace, and Dar al-Harb, or the House of\nWar, and called on Muslim leaders to fight for the purpose of extending the territory of\nDar al-Islam. Jihad waned when the Arab Empire stopped acquiring new territory not\nlong thereafter, but, as we shall see, would reemerge in the twelfth century in response\nto the Crusades. It thereafter again faded in popularity until the Ottoman government\nrevived the concept by declaring jihad against the allied powers during the First World\nWar in a bid to create unrest in the Muslim parts of the British, French, and Russian\nempires. Today, despite the condemnation of most Muslim religious scholars, jihadi\ngroups adhere to a reinterpreted conception of jihad that makes it an individual rather\nthan a collective action and that disregards the explicit prohibition that Muhammad had\nplaced on attacking noncombatants.70\nThe Five Pillars of Islam\nIslam is a religion of belief, of course, but its main focus is on proper action rather\nthan on observance of dogma. As such, Islam eschews Christianity\u2019s emphasis on\n69 Michael Bonner, Jihad in Islamic History: Doctrines and Practice (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2006), 16\u201317.\n70 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 85\u201386; John L. Esposito, Unholy War:\nTerror in the Name of Islam (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), 35. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 32\nadherence to a particular doctrine and rejects theological inquiry as zannah, or idle\nspeculation; instead, like Judaism, it stresses correct practice through the acceptance of\na set of straightforward duties, rituals, and laws that define and exemplify what it means\nto be a Muslim. By far the most important of these obligations are the Five Pillars of\nIslam. These expressions of faith date to Muhammad\u2019s time in Medina, and they\nconstitute the core rituals of Islam. Unsurprisingly, these duties reflect the prophet\u2019s\nemphasis on monotheism, community, and social justice.71\nThe first pillar is shahada, or the profession of faith. It calls for a genuine\nexpression of belief in the monotheistic God through the pronouncement of the\nstatement: \u201cThere is only one God, God, and Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d The\ndeclaration of this seemingly simple statement achieves two critical aims. First, in\nexpressing it, Muslims profess their adherence to the religion of Islam and their belief in\nGod. Indeed, genuinely stating the shahada is all that one must do to become a Muslim.\nSecond, it affirms one\u2019s belief in tawhid, which emphasizes not merely the monotheistic\nconcept of God\u2019s oneness and unity, but also His singular and indescribable nature and\nHis indivisibility.72\nThe second pillar of Islam, salat, or worship, calls on Muslims to pray five times\nper day. They are required to do so at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and\nnighttime. They must do so while facing Mecca, and only after they have ritually\ncleansed themselves. Salat also stipulates that Muslims pray collectively at a mosque at\nmidday on Fridays. This pillar reflects two of the main themes in Muhammad\u2019s\nteachings. First, the prayer at the heart of it stresses the idea of tawhid, and thus\nreinforces Muhammad\u2019s message of strict monotheism and God\u2019s unity. Second, the\ncall for collective public prayers on Fridays makes clear Islam\u2019s focus on community\nrather than on individual salvation.73\nThe third pillar of Islam, the zakat, is an annual alms tax assessed to support the\nindigent. It began as a voluntary contribution in Mecca and became mandatory after\nMuhammad and his followers relocated to Medina\u2014likely, as we have seen, because\nthe war with the Quraysh had produced a large number of widows and orphans and\nthus a need for some mechanism by which they could be supported. Traditionally, local\nrulers assessed the zakat on each Muslim\u2019s net worth at a rate of 2.5 percent. Expected\nof all believers and collected by the state, the tax helps reinforce the ideas of community\n71 Armstrong, Islam, 6.\n72 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 147\u201348.\n73 Bates and Rassam, Peoples and Cultures of the Middle East, 46 Originally, men and\nwomen worshipped together in the mosque in Medina, albeit in gender-segregated\nsections. Not long after Muhammad, however, political and religious leaders took a dim\nview of mixed-gender prayer out of fear that the presence of women would distract the\nmen and they consequently discouraged women from taking part in public prayers. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 33\nand mutual obligation, and, importantly, embodies both Islam\u2019s communal nature and its\nemphasis on social justice.74\nSawm, or fasting, is the fourth pillar of Islam. Sawm occurs during Ramadan\u2014\nthe month in which Muhammad claimed that the Qur\u02bean was first revealed to him\u2014and\nhas clear roots in the Jewish practice of fasting. From dawn until dusk during Ramadan,\nMuslims refrain from activities like sexual relations, smoking, eating, and drinking;\nexceptions are made for children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, the sick, the\nelderly and others who are physically vulnerable. It is a festive time in Muslim-majority\ncountries. Ramadan includes nightly celebrations and communal meals capped by the\neid al-fitr: a three-day holiday at the end of the month featuring feasts and family\ngatherings. Sawm is not just a period for celebrating with family and friends, however.\nInstead, it is also a time during which Muslims affirm their belief in tawhid, build\ncommunal bonds, and renew their commitment to social justice by experiencing the\nprivation of the poor.75\nThe fifth and final pillar of Islam, hajj, is the requirement that Muslims make a\npilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime if they are able. Though the hajj was\ncomparatively modest as recently as the 1940s, it is today one of the largest gatherings\nof people on earth. It takes place during the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, and first occurred in\nthe late 620s. During the hajj, pilgrims in Mecca take part in a series of rituals including\nthe tawaf, in which they circumnavigate the Ka\u02bfba in a counterclockwise direction, and\nthe sa\u2019ay, the ritual running between two hills in imitation of Hagar\u2019s desperate search\nfor water for her infant son, Ismail. A collective activity, the hajj evinces Islam\u2019s\nemphasis on community. Less obviously, its rituals are also designed to focus the\npilgrims on tawhid and thus serve to reinforce the strict monotheism that lies at the heart\nof the faith. Communalism and monotheism were surely in the front of Muhammad\u2019s\nmind when he made the hajj a religious obligation, but, as previously noted, practical\nconsiderations likely also played a role in his decision. Put simply, requiring his\nfollowers to undertake an Islamic version of the hajj would offset the revenue the\nQuraysh stood to lose as a result of the demise of the older, polytheistic pilgrimage, and\nwas thus a small price to pay to persuade them to abandon their resistance to his\nmovement.76\nThough not a formal requirement of the religion, another ideal, greater jihad, is so\nimportant that many people frequently\u2014if inaccurately\u2014refer to it as the sixth pillar of\nIslam. Jihad literally translates as \u201cstruggle,\u201d and greater jihad\u2014in contrast to lesser\njihad\u2019s articulation of the Muslim doctrine of just war\u2014refers to the ongoing struggle that\nindividual believers wage within themselves to remain focused on God in the face of the\ntemptations of the material world. Islam holds that devotion to success, money, luxuries,\nego, or power distracts believers from centering their lives on God and His desires, and\nthus separates them from the divine. Only by ceaselessly waging greater jihad within\n74 Esposito, Islam, 109\u201310.\n75 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 149.\n76 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 150\u201352. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 34\nthemselves could they remain attentive to the goodness of God and thus honor their\ncommitment to Him.77\nAs noted earlier, Muhammad also imposed a number of other restrictions on the\numma related directly or indirectly to the themes of monotheism, community, and social\njustice. Holding that the one God is the God of Abraham, Muhammad required Muslims\nto observe the cultural practices by which the patriarch and his descendants had lived.\nAccordingly, he barred the consumption of pork and required the circumcision of Muslim\nmen. Other restrictions were related to Islam\u2019s focus on social justice. Muhammad\nbanned usury, false contracts, bribery, alcohol, gambling, and men wearing silk clothing\nor gold jewelry as part of his effort to create a more equitable society. Enforcement of all\nof these restrictions ultimately fell to the umma rather than to individuals or families,\nthus reflecting Islam\u2019s communal rather than individual focus. As we shall see in chapter\nfour, Muslim jurists would later formalize and expand these restrictions when they\ncodified shari\u02bfa law in the eighth and ninth centuries.78\nThe Historical Debate: The Revisionist School\nSo far, this chapter has outlined the conventional understanding of Muhammad\nand the emergence of Islam. That is, the preceding account broadly reflects both the\ntraditional Islamic narrative articulated by Muslim historians in the ninth century and the\nviews of most modern-day scholars who focus on this period. This perspective is not\nuniversally held, however. Instead, in recent decades, a number of historians and\nreligious scholars have developed alternative interpretations of the emergence of Islam\nthat challenge key parts of the dominant narrative.\nSome scholars focus on the question of Muhammad\u2019s intention. They dispute the\nidea that he cast himself as the final prophet whom God had chosen to strip away\naccretions to the pure faith of Abraham and thus to restore the true monotheistic\nreligion. Instead, they contend that his early conception of his mission was far-more\nlimited in scope. For example, Karen Armstrong argues that Muhammad initially viewed\nhimself merely as the prophet that God had selected to bring His message to the Arab\npeople just as He had tapped Moses and Jesus to spread the monotheistic faith to other\ncultures. She argues that it was only after members of the Jewish tribes in Medina\nmocked Muhammad\u2019s understanding of the Torah that he declared that God had sent\nhim to bring his message to all humanity as the final prophet\u2014a shift he made manifest\nin 624 by changing the qiblah, the direction that Muslims faced while praying, from\nJerusalem to Mecca.79\nHistorians in the revisionist school go substantially further. These scholars draw\nattention to the fact that the extant sources on the life of Muhammad and the early\numma are deeply problematic. In particular, they note that the best evidence available\n77 Esposito, Islam, 113\u201314.\n78 Esposito, 31\u201333.\n79 Armstrong, Islam, 8, 17\u201318. Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 35\non Muhammad is a biography written by Ibn Ishaq (c. 704-767) more than a century\nafter the prophet had died, and they argue that the gap between the era in which writers\nlike Ibn Ishaq lived and the time of the early community of believers is simply so vast\nthat such sources cannot be treated as reliable accounts. Revisionist scholars also\ncontend that authors like Ibn Ishaq very likely shaped their interpretations to serve\ncontemporary political interests, and that their works thus reflect the values and beliefs\nof the eighth century rather than those of the early umma. Those historians\nconsequently view the Arabic sources with a skeptical eye and generally favor seventh-\ncentury, non-Muslim accounts that touch upon events in the Arabian peninsula over\nlater Islamic narratives.80\nInterpretations based on those accounts dramatically contradict the traditional\nnarrative. For example, the historian Patricia Crone finds the idea that Mecca was a\nbustling commercial nexus implausible because non-Muslim seventh-century sources\u2014\notherwise-well versed on the affairs of the Hijaz\u2014made no mention of it whatsoever.\nIndeed, she concludes that Muhammad lived not in Mecca, but instead in northern\nArabia close to the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, John Wansbrough agrees with the\ntraditional narrative that the Qur\u02bean dates to the early-seventh century, but also\nmaintains that eighth-and-ninth century Muslims thoroughly altered it through accretion\nand revision. Revisionist scholars who examine archaeological findings have gone even\nfarther and argue that the material evidence casts doubt about even the most\nfundamental elements of the standard narrative. For instance, the archaeologist Yehuda\nNevo notes that the earliest confirmed archaeological reference to Muhammad\u2014coins\nbearing his name\u2014date only to the late-seventh century. As a result, he concludes that\nthe traditional story of Islam\u2019s emergence was a construct of the eighth and ninth\ncenturies and suggests that Muhammad was at best a minor figure whom Muslim\nwriters only later recast as a prophet to serve sectarian ends.81\nThe revisionist school of Islamic studies has certainly altered understandings of\nIslam\u2019s emergence, but most scholars continue to accept at least the broad outlines of\nthe traditional narrative. They typically acknowledge the limits inherent in later sources\nsuch as Ibn Ishaq\u2019s biography, but also argue that they can draw valid inferences from\nsuch accounts through the careful use of historical methods and criticism. They likewise\nmaintain that non-Arab sources accord with the overall contours of the conventional\nunderstanding of Muhammad and the birth of Islam\u2014at least in the broadest sense\u2014\nand thus confirm the traditional narrative.82\n80 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 50\u201356; Brown, Muhammad, 78\u201379, 93\u201397.\n81 See Patricia Crone, Meccan Trade and the Rise of Islam, 1st Edition (Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press, 1987); John E.

Chapter Two: Muhammad and Islam, c. 570-632 Page 36\nConclusion\nMuhammad had enjoyed astonishing success in the last twenty-two years of his\nlife. Since beginning his religious mission, he had won the support of a core group of\nfollowers, relocated his community to Medina, conquered Mecca, purged the Ka\u02bfba of\npolytheism, and secured control of the entire Arabian peninsula. Given the long odds\nthat he faced during much of that period, it is little wonder that many Arabs concluded\nfrom his success that he enjoyed divine favor.\nThe religious movement that he had started continued to grow rapidly after his\ndeath, moreover. Indeed, neither his passing nor his failure to name a successor slowed\nIslam\u2019s growth to any degree. Instead, as we shall see in the next chapter, the\ncommunity he had led would follow his death by initiating one of the greatest campaigns\nof conquest in history\u2014in the process establishing a huge and enormously successful\nempire and institutionalizing and spreading the religion of Islam. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment of the Caliphate, 632-\n809\nJust a few years after the death of Muhammad in 632, the Arab people,\nheretofore marginal players in a region dominated by powerful empires, exploded out of\nArabia. Striking at a time when the established powers of antiquity were peculiarly\nweak, small but highly mobile Arab armies won a series of decisive victories that, by\n651, resulted in the umma taking control of the Byzantine Middle East and the entirety\nof the Persian Empire. After a pause in the mid-to-late-seventh century, the wars of\nconquest continued. When those campaigns finally came to a close a century later, they\nhad produced a new empire, the caliphate, of breathtaking scale. Stretching from Spain\nin the West to the Central Asian city of Samarkand in the east and from the Pyrenees in\nthe north to Yemen in the south, the Arab Empire was considerably larger in extent than\nRome had been at its peak and every bit as sophisticated. This achievement was\nremarkable\u2014not least because the Arabs took control of this territory during a period in\nwhich they experienced significant internal dissension that included intrigue,\nassassination, and even civil war.\nRemarkable as it was, the conquest would have been of limited consequence\nhad the Arabs proven unable to institutionalize their control over the far-flung territories\nthat they acquired between 632 and 751. History is replete with examples of powerful\nconquerors whose empires were as fleeting politically as they had been dominant\nmilitarily. The Arabs proved to be more than up to the challenge of administering the\nterritory that they had acquired, however. Despite having no more experience ruling a\nlarge sedentary empire than had earlier nomadic groups such as the Huns, they\nmanaged to establish a durable system of government based on a combination of\nborrowed and original practices and institutions. Critically, they also ensured domestic\ntranquility by developing stable relations with the empire\u2019s millions of diverse subject\npeoples who remained, until at least the tenth century, predominately non-Muslim.\nThe Birth of the Caliphate\nThe pivotal, early stages of the conquests occurred during the reigns of the first\nfour caliphs, or \u201csuccessors,\u201d of Muhammad. These men, Abu Bakr (r. 632-634), Umar\nibn Al-Khattab (r. 634-644), Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644-656), and Ali Ibn Talib (r. 656-661)\nplayed an outsized role in determining not only the structure of the early caliphal\ngovernment, but also the nature of Muslim society. As a result, Muslim religious\nscholars called \u02bfulama\u02be later came to refer to these early leaders as Rashidun, or\n\u201crightly guided.\u201d1\nThat the Rashidun caliphs were obliged to define the framework of the\ngovernment stemmed from the fact that Muhammad had not left clear instructions as to\n1 Vali Nasr, The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future (New\nYork: W. W. Norton, 2006), 35. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 38\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nhow the polity he created should be governed after his death. In fact, beyond making\nclear that his successors would not be prophets, he had never articulated the role of the\ncaliph and had thus left the umma with several critical, unanswered questions. Was the\nruler\u2019s authority to be strictly political in nature, or was it also to encompass religious\nissues? If his2 ambit was to extend to spiritual matters, what religious powers would he\nwield? Finally, was the caliph to be \u201cfirst amongst equals\u201d administering a loosely\norganized state or was he to rule as the all-powerful head of a tightly centralized\ngovernment? With Muhammad having demurred in answering these questions, it fell to\nhis immediate successors to address them. Through their actions, pronouncements,\nand decisions, the first four caliphs did so\u2014establishing, in the process, the broad\nstructure that would define caliphal authority going forward.\nThe Succession Crisis\nMuhammad\u2019s refusal either to explain the nature and extent of his successors\u2019\npowers or to make clear who was next in line would not have proven problematic had\nthe umma been united and thus able to devise a system for determining who was best\nsuited to follow Muhammad. The community of believers was anything but unified in\n632, however. Instead, it was divided into three loose factions\u2014the Ansar, the\nmuhajirun, and the Banu Hashim\u2014that vied with each other for power and influence. As\na result, even as Muhammad\u2019s followers grieved following his death, they also engaged\nin a brief succession struggle that would have momentous political, social, and even\nreligious implications for the fledgling movement.3\nEach faction advanced a claim in favor of one of its members. The Ansar, the\nMedinan natives who had backed Muhammad from the time of his arrival in Yathrib,\nbelieved that their critical support during a peculiarly difficult period entitled them to\nselect a successor from among their ranks. The muhajirun, Muhammad\u2019s earliest\nfollowers, strongly disagreed. They instead maintained that the successor should be a\nMuslim from the Quraysh tribe who had faced persecution alongside the prophet during\nIslam\u2019s earliest days in Mecca. Finally, a third group made up largely of members of\nMuhammad\u2019s Banu Hashim clan claimed that the prophet had intended that his cousin\nand son-in-law, Ali, should succeed him. Known as Alids or, more formally as the\nShi\u2019atu Ali, or Party of Ali, this faction argued that the Prophet had made his intention\nexplicit when he had announced at the oasis of Ghadir al-Khumm during his return from\nhis final pilgrimage to Mecca in 632 that \u201c\u2018any of you who consider me a patron should\nconsider Ali your patron.\u2019\u201d4\nThe prophet\u2019s son-in-law did not get the opportunity to take part in the\ndeliberations at which the leading figures in the umma determined the succession,\n2 The use of a gendered pronoun is intentional here. All of the caliphs were men.\n3 Hugh Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, Second Edition (New\nYork: Routledge, 2004), 50\u201351.\n4 Quoted in Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic\nEyes (New York, NY: PublicAffairs, 2009), 55. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 39\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nhowever. Instead, while Ali was preoccupied helping to prepare Muhammad\u2019s body for\nburial, the leading muhajirun and Ansar held a traditional consultation of important men\ncalled a shura to resolve the dispute before it turned into a full-blown crisis. They made\ntwo enormously consequential decisions. First, looking to freeze Ali out, they rejected\nhis candidacy on the grounds that he was too young to head the community of\nbelievers. Second, they determined that they could only overcome the divisions in the\numma that the succession had revealed by selecting someone who was both a member\nof the Quraysh tribe and an early, trusted companion of Muhammad. They quickly\nsettled on the respected muhajirun Abu Bakr, who was both one of the first men to\naccept Islam and the father of Muhammad\u2019s favorite wife, \u02bfA\u02beisha (c. 613-678). Ali was\ndisappointed that the shura had passed him over and unhappy that it had met without\nhim; despite the anger of his Alid supporters, however, he reluctantly consented to the\ndecision out of a desire to ensure the unity of the umma.5\nThe Ridda Wars\nAcceptance of Abu Bakr as caliph resolved the dispute over the succession, but\nit did not prevent the emergence of a serious new crisis. It centered on the relationship\nbetween the central government in Medina and the bedouin tribes that had supported\nMuhammad. Many of the tribes had responded to the news of the Prophet\u2019s death by\nclaiming that they had pledged allegiance not to the government in Medina but instead\nto Muhammad personally, and that they were, as a consequence, no longer bound to\nthe state that he had created or obligated to forward the zakat tax to its treasury.\nCompounding this insubordination, several figures had emerged among the bedouin\nwho claimed, like Muhammad, to be prophets tasked by God with delivering His divine\nmessage to the Arabs and who had begun to establish rival political-religious\ncommunities similar in structure to the umma. These threats were serious ones for the\nmovement Muhammad had created. Were Abu Bakr to have permitted the tribes to\nsecede or allowed new religious communities to take root, the umma would likely have\ncollapsed in short order. Likewise, one of Muhammad\u2019s signal achievements\u2014 the\nestablishment of intertribal peace in Arabia\u2014would have all-but certainly ended in a\nreturn of the intertribal conflict that had characterized the peninsula in the pre-Islamic\nera.6\nThe new caliph was determined to prevent such a train of events from occurring.\nAccordingly, he began his brief reign by launching the Ridda Wars, or Wars of Apostasy\nagainst the bedouin tribes that had rejected his authority. Given the large number of\ntribes that had broken with Medina, this task promised to be a difficult one. Fortunately\nfor the Muslims, Abu Bakr was a skilled military commander and a deft negotiator. Using\na combination of, intimidation, diplomacy, and, when necessary, force, he succeeded in\nbringing the breakaway tribes to heel and in crushing the rival religious movements. As\n5 Reza Aslan, No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, Updated\nEdition (Random House, 2011), 114\u201319.\n6 Hugh Kennedy, Caliphate: The History of an Idea (New York: Basic Books, 2016), 9. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 40\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\na result, the Ridda Wars ended in the spring of 633 in a decisive Muslim triumph. The\numma had been saved.7\nStill, despite the quick victory, the leadership of the umma found the secession of\nso many tribes deeply troubling. It not only suggested that the bedouins\u2019 acceptance of\nMuhammad\u2019s message of peace and unity was superficial, but, more critically, it raised\nquestions about Islam\u2019s ability to endure. Accordingly, even before the fighting had\nended, they began to consider the root cause of the Ridda Wars and to implement\nchanges that would ensure the tribes\u2019 ongoing loyalty.8\nAfter reflecting on the issue for some time, they determined that the war had\nemerged out of the tension that existed between Muhammad\u2019s message of peace and\nthe bedouins\u2019 deeply entrenched social and economic practices. As we saw in chapter\ntwo, the nomadic Arabs had traditionally engaged in low-intensity ghazu, or raids that\nprovided both the means through which tribes could acquire the wealth upon which\nsurvival depended and a regulated system of warfare through which young men could\nwin respect and social standing. While welcome, in other words, Muhammad\u2019s ban on\nviolence within the umma had unintentionally created serious problems for the\nbedouins. Not only were the tribes now enduring material deprivation, but they were\nalso experiencing internal conflict among the young men who suddenly lacked a\nsanctioned means of gaining prestige. It was these problems that had led the tribes to\nbreak with Medina, and it was these issues that the leadership of the umma would have\nto resolve if the community of believers were to endure.9\nThis assessment was sobering. It suggested that there existed an intrinsic\ntension between the tribes\u2019 socioeconomic needs and Muhammad\u2019s call for peace\nwithin the Muslim community. Importantly, it also indicated that, absent significant\nchanges, every caliph would have to wage a destabilizing civil war with separatist\nelements upon acceding to office\u2014a prospect that boded ill for the success of both the\ncommunity of believers and Muhammad\u2019s religious message.10\nBut how could the umma solve this problem? How could its leadership reconcile\nMuhammad\u2019s vision of internal peace with the tribes\u2019 need for raiding? It did so by\ndevising a plan wherein the caliphate would direct the bedouins outward against\nexternal, non-Muslim enemies. This approach would provide the young men with the\nregulated warfare they needed to gain prestige just as it would permit the tribes to\n7 Fred Donner, Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam (Cambridge, MA:\nThe Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012), 100\u2013102.\n8 Karen Armstrong, Islam: A Short History (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 25\u201327.\n9 Hugh Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the\nWorld We Live In (New York: Da Capo Press, 2007), 56\u201357.\n10 Kennedy, 56\u201357.

It was a bold decision to say the least. As the\nmerchants of Mecca knew from firsthand experience, those empires were fabulously\nrich, and the Arabs could expect to win great exploits and to acquire great wealth by\nraiding them. At the same time, however, the targets of those ghazu were two of the\nmightiest powers that had ever existed. Attacking them was thus a highly dangerous\nmove\u2014one that could potentially imperil the fledgling community of believers.12\nThough he had played an important part in shaping the umma\u2019s plans, it was not\nAbu Bakr who would shoulder that risk. Instead, following Abu Bakr\u2019s death in 634,\ndirection of the campaign fell to his successor, Umar. One of the muhajirun, Umar was a\nsevere, disciplined, and pious man who famously demonstrated his dedication to\nIslam\u2019s revolutionary message by wearing homespun clothing and by taking naps in the\ncorner of the mosque in Medina. Deeply committed to the success of the umma, he was\nas dedicated as his predecessor had been to ensuring that there would be no repetition\nof the Ridda Wars. Accordingly, after taking the title of Commander of the Faithful in\naddition to that of caliph, he proceeded with the plan to launch simultaneous attacks\nagainst the Persian and Byzantine Empires. It was a fateful decision\u2014one that would\nmark the beginning of what turned out to be one of the most successful sustained\nmilitary campaigns in history: the Arab Conquest.13\nThe Conquest of the Byzantine Middle East\nWhile the campaign against the Byzantine Empire began with modest goals it\nquickly transformed into an outright invasion. The attacks started in early 634 when\nmobile Arab forces entered southern Palestine from the Arabian desert in search of\nplunder. Meeting with immediate success, they quickly amassed large quantities of loot.\nMore importantly, they also handily defeated a small Byzantine detachment and seized\ncontrol of several border towns and cities. These early victories were modest in scale\nbut significant in terms of their impact. Making clear that Byzantine control of Palestine\nwas more tenuous than the Arabs had earlier assumed, they suggested to Umar that his\nsoldiers could do more than merely make off with some stolen goods. Accordingly, the\ncaliph ordered one of his top commanders, Khalid ibn al-Walid (585-642), to lead his\nsmall force across the desert from Iraq, where it had been raiding the Persian Empire,\nand to take charge of the war in Palestine. Thus reinforced, the Arabs quickly scored a\n11 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 59.\n12 Kennedy, Caliphate, 10\u201311.\n13 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 70\u201377, 124\u201325; Kennedy, The Prophet\nand the Age of the Caliphates, 57\u201358. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 42\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nstunning victory over imperial troops at the Battle of Ajnadayn in July 634\u2014a triumph\nthat resulted in them taking control of most of Palestine. Khalid did not rest on his\nlaurels with this victory. Moving with characteristic aggressiveness, he took advantage\nof Byzantine disarray following the battle to lay siege to Damascus in August 634; Just a\nmonth later, he secured the city\u2019s surrender.14\nThe occupation of Damascus was a serious threat to the Byzantine position in\nSyria. Emperor Heraclius (r. 610-641) could tolerate some raids and even the seizure of\na few towns on the edge of the desert, but he could not stomach the loss of one of the\nempire\u2019s most important commercial and administrative centers. Determined to restore\nByzantine control of Syria, he responded by bringing his main field army into the region\nin 635. Its arrival set the stage for a decisive battle\u2014one that would determine whether\nSyria would remain a province of the venerable Byzantine Empire or whether it would\nbecome a part of the emerging Arab Empire.15\nThe clash took place in southern Syria. Khalid initially responded to the arrival of\nthe Byzantine army by relinquishing Damascus and retreating into Palestine. His\nwithdrawal should not be interpreted as a permanent abandonment of the territory that\nhis troops had conquered, however. On the contrary, it was a shrewdly designed\nstrategic redeployment aimed at gaining the time needed for reinforcements to arrive\nand at ensuring that the decisive engagement occurred at a place of his choosing.\nKhalid was successful on both counts. Not only was he able to greatly reinforce his\narmy thanks to his decision to defer the decisive engagement, but he was also able to\nmaneuver Heraclius battle at a place conducive to the Arabs\u2019 more mobile soldiers.\nFought in the summer of 636, the resulting contest, the Battle of Yarmuk, ended in a\ndecisive victory for the Arabs that shattered Heraclius\u2019s army.16\nThe Battle of Yarmuk settled once and for all the question of who would control\nSyria. Lacking sufficient troops to continue to contest the Arab attack, Heraclius\nabandoned the province and withdrew into Asia Minor through the Cilician Gate, a\nstrategic pass in the Taurus Mountains. Gazing down on Syria for the last time from the\ntop of the pass, he reputedly acknowledged the province\u2019s permanent loss by declaring\n\u201c\u2018Peace unto thee, O Syria, and what an excellent country for the enemy.\u2019\u201d Whether he\nactually uttered those words or not,17 his withdrawal made clear that Byzantine rule in\nthe Levant had come to an end\u2014a reality that the remaining cities in Syria and\nPalestine quickly grasped. With the return of imperial authority now an impossibility,\ntheir leaders opted to come to terms with the Arabs rather than to fight what they\nconcluded would be a doomed effort. Even Jerusalem, seat of one of the Church\u2019s five\npatriarchates and site of the Crucifixion, negotiated an agreement with Umar\u2019s troops.\n14 Fred Donner, The Early Islamic Conquests (Princeton: Princeton University Press,\n1981), 111\u201332.\n15 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 60\u201361.\n16 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 82\u201385.\n17 He didn\u2019t. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 43\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nThus, with shocking suddenness, a millennium of Greco-Roman rule in Syria and\nPalestine came to a close.18\nByzantine Egypt came next. If Syria had been important to the empire, Egypt was\nits economic linchpin. Thanks to the steady supply of water that the Nile River provided,\nthe province produced far more wheat and other agricultural goods than its people\nconsumed. That surplus was critical to the well-being of the empire in two ways. First, it\nsupplied the food that sustained the hundreds of thousands of residents of the\nByzantine capital, Constantinople. Second, it produced substantial annual tax receipts\nthat provided the government with the revenue needed to pay for the army. Without\nEgypt and its surplus, in other words, the Byzantine government would have been\nunable either to fund its military or to keep its capital fed. Unsurprisingly, the empire\ndevoted a great deal of attention to the province\u2019s defense. It garrisoned a large force of\ntroops in Egypt and maintained a series of strategically placed fortifications including the\nimposing fortress of Babylon at the base of the Nile River Delta. Most importantly, the\nempire stationed a large force of troops in the well-protected walled city of Alexandria\nlocated on the western edge of the delta. So long as Alexandria remained in imperial\nhands, the province could not be captured.19\nUndaunted, Arab forces under the direction of the veteran commander Amr Ibn\nal-As (c. 573-664) invaded the province in 640. The attack seemed a fool\u2019s errand. The\narmy he led was tiny and appeared to be no match for Egypt\u2019s extensive fortifications\nand powerful garrison. Nonetheless, he and his troops quickly defeated a Byzantine\nfield army and compelled the fortress of Babylon to surrender. By early 641, as a result,\ncentral Egypt had come under Arab control.20\nAl-As was pleased with his victory but was unwilling to settle for anything less\nthan full control of the entire province. He consequently followed his capture of central\nEgypt by besieging Alexandria. Like Babylon, it appeared to be beyond the capabilities\nof al-As\u2019s small army. With imposing walls, a large garrison, and a port able to receive\nsupplies, the city appeared to be all-but invulnerable. Despite the apparent solidity of its\ndefenses, however, the Arab commander once again achieved a nearly cost-free\nvictory. Taking advantage of dissension among the defenders, he was able to secure\nthe city\u2019s surrender from its leader, the Patriarch Cyrus (?-642), in September 642.\nThus, in just two short years, Egypt and its massive grain production had become part\nof the rapidly expanding caliphate.21\n18 Ahmad Al-Baladhuri, \u201cThe Battle of The Yarmuk (636) and After,\u201d accessed October\n23, 2019, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/yarmuk.asp; Robert G.

Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 44\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nThe Conquest of the Persian Empire\nAstonishingly, at the same time that Arab armies were overrunning the Byzantine\nMiddle East, they were simultaneously dismembering the venerable Persian Empire.\nLike the attacks on Palestine and Syria, the invasion of the Sassanid domain began with\na series of raids. Disruptive, these incursions prompted the Persian Shah, Yazdgard III\n(r. 632-651), to deploy his army to the border to repel the raiders. Prudence dictated a\nquick Arab retreat in the face of the shah\u2019s superior numbers; sensing opportunity,\nhowever, Umar instead decided to reinforce his troops in Mesopotamia\u2014thus setting\nthe stage for a decisive clash. It occurred just outside the small settlement of Qadisiya\non the border between Mesopotamia and the Arabian Desert. Details of the battle are\nhazy due to an acute absence of sources\u2014historians are not even sure if it occurred in\n636, 637, or 638\u2014but the outcome was clear: Umar\u2019s forces won a crushing victory that\nshattered the Persian army and left the empire defenseless. The invaders wasted no\ntime in exploiting their triumph. Moving quickly, they followed the battle by seizing\nMesopotamia, including, pivotally, the imperial capital of Ctesiphon.22\nYazdgard III and the four-century old Sassanid Dynasty were in serious trouble.\nThe Arab occupation of Mesopotamia meant that the young shah could no longer\naccess the resources of what was by far the wealthiest part of his empire. Meanwhile,\nthe loss of the capital not only greatly complicated his efforts to provide central direction\nto the defense of his realm, but also scattered his tax officials\u2014thereby leaving him\nbereft of the bureaucrats needed to raise the revenue on which the restoration of his\narmies depended.23\nThe Arabs did not stop with the conquest of Mesopotamia, moreover. Taking\nadvantage of the disarray that the capture of the Persian capital had created, they\nsurged out of Iraq and onto the Iranian plateau. While they met significant resistance in\na few areas, Umar\u2019s forces pushed inexorably eastward over the course of the late 630s\nand 640s. Yazdgard III could do little to stem the tide. With Arab armies nipping at his\nheels, he had no choice but to flee eastward while attempting\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014to rally\nthe Persian nobility and to win the support of the Turkish principalities of Central Asia.\nThe end finally came in 651. With his last supporters having deserted him, the shah\ntook shelter in a watermill just outside the caravan city of Merv in modern-day\nTurkmenistan. Accounts differ about what happened next, but all end with the last\nPersian shahanshah, or king of kings, dying, abandoned and alone, at the hands of the\nmiller. So ended the Persian Empire, and so, at least for a time, ended the Arabs\u2019\nastounding surge out of Arabia.24\n22 Donner, The Early Islamic Conquests, 173\u201376.\n23 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 66\u201367.\n24 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 169\u201399. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 45\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nSources of Arab Success\nThe extent of the Arab Conquest at the time of Yazdgard III\u2019s death was\nstaggering. Between 632 and 651, Arab armies had established an empire of almost\nincomprehensible size. They had conquered a territory that stretched from Yemen in the\nsouth to the Caucasus Mountains in the north, and from Egypt in the west to Central\nAsia in the east. Even more shocking, they had, in the process, reduced one of\nantiquity\u2019s greatest empires to a rump state and had utterly destroyed another. How did\nthey do it? What accounted for the tremendous sequence of victories that Arab armies\nachieved during this period?\nFrom the start, popular explanations for the Arabs\u2019 success have tended to stress\nreligious factors. Unsurprisingly, Muslims have long maintained that the Arabs\u2019 string of\nvictories was a product of divine will. That is, they believed that the caliphs\u2019 soldiers had\ntriumphed because they were followers of the true religion and thus had God on their\nside. Indeed, so far as the early Muslims were concerned, the sheer scale of their\nconquests demonstrated conclusively that Islam was the correct path. How else could\nthey explain their armies\u2019 seemingly preternatural success?25\nMany people in the West have also long posited a religious explanation for the\nArab Conquest, though they reject the idea that the Arabs had God on their side.\nInstead, those arguing from this perspective have asserted that Arab success was a\nproduct of Islam\u2019s newness and its militarist ideology of jihad, understood here to mean\n\u2018holy war.\u2019 According to this interpretation, Arab soldiers fighting against Byzantine and\nPersian forces prevailed for two reasons. First, they had the \u2018zeal of the convert,\u2019\nmeaning that they had the extra motivation and fervor typically ascribed to those new to\na faith. Second, they were inspired by an Islamic tradition that holds that a Muslim\nfighter who died while on jihad would go immediately to heaven where he would enjoy\nthe company of seventy-two virgins. This interpretation concludes that these factors\nensured that Arab Muslim soldiers entered battle without fearing death\u2014a conviction\nthat dramatically boosted their morale and all-but assured them of victory.26\nPresent-day scholars take issue with these explanations. They dismiss the\ntraditional Muslim interpretation that divine favor explains Arab success on the grounds\nthat such an argument is, ipso facto, unprovable, and thus inconsistent with modern\nrules of scholarship and argumentation. For different reasons, they also dispute the\npopular Western view that Arab success stemmed from a combination of religious zeal\nand the enticement of immediate admission into heaven. Noting that the promise of\nseventy-two virgins dates only to the ninth century, they reject the idea that it could have\nbeen a motivating factor in the wars of expansion. Instead, while acknowledging that\nIslam played a major role in motivating and organizing the Arab Conquest, they\ngenerally agree that three key factors made possible the caliphate\u2019s remarkable military\n25 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 47.\n26 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 199; Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 47;\nArmstrong, Islam, 29. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 46\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nsuccess in the decades immediately following Muhammad\u2019s death: the Arab\u2019s mobility\nand effective leadership; deep-seated religious discontent in Syria and Egypt; and the\npeculiar weakness of the Byzantine and Persian Empires in the 630s and 640s.27\nArab Mobility and Leadership\nFirst, historians today argue that the Arabs benefited from superior mobility and\nunusually effective leadership. Possessing large herds of camels and operating without\ncumbersome and slow-moving supply trains, the Arabs easily outmaneuvered their\nByzantine and Persian enemies and were able to mass troops quickly at the point of\nbattle. They also enjoyed highly capable leadership from far-sighted political figures\nsuch as Umar and from skilled battlefield commanders such as Khalid and al-As.28\nAn episode recounted by the Muslim historian Al Tabari (839-923) illustrates the\ncritical role that mobility and strong leadership played in securing one of the Arabs\u2019\nearliest victories against the Byzantine Empire. As he relates, Umar\u2019s decision in 634 to\norder Khalid to rapidly shift his force from Mesopotamia to Palestine so that they could\nhelp the Arab soldiers there take advantage of the province\u2019s weak defenses presented\nKhalid with a dilemma. If he took the long-but-secure route along the Euphrates River,\nhis army would safely make the journey but would arrive too late to help defeat the\nByzantine forces massing in Palestine. If he instead marched directly across the\nwaterless Syrian Desert, he risked seeing a large part of his force die of thirst. A savvy\nleader, Khalid quickly came up with a clever way of ensuring that his soldiers could\nsafely take the direct route through the desert. Before setting out, he had his camels\ndrink their fill; he then ordered his men to periodically kill some of the animals during\ntheir journey across the desert and to fill their canteens with drinking water from the\ndeceased animals\u2019 stomachs. In this way, his army was able to make it to Palestine in\ntime to help win the critical Battle of Ajnadayn.29\nReligious Dissension\nHistorians today also stress the role that religious discord within the Byzantine\nMiddle East played in facilitating the Arab Conquest. As noted in chapter two, the\nmajority of Christians in that part of the empire were Monophysites who believed that\nJesus was wholly divine in nature. Known as Copts in Egypt and Jacobites in Syria,\nthey had faced concerted persecution from both the imperial government and the\nChurch hierarchy ever since the Council of Chalcedon had declared their beliefs to be\nheresies in 451. They did enjoy a brief respite under Persian occupation during the\nearly-seventh century\u2014a point we shall return to in a moment\u2014but then experienced a\nnew and particularly aggressive period of religious oppression when Byzantine officials\nand clerics returned in the late 620s and early 630s. Persecution was especially severe\n27 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 165\u201366; Kennedy, The Great Arab\nConquests, 62, 70.\n28 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 366\u201373.\n29 Donner, The Early Islamic Conquests, 121\u201322. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 47\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nin Egypt. Installed as both Patriarch of Alexandria and provincial governor in 631, the\nBishop Cyrus oversaw a brutal campaign that centered on torturing and even executing\nCoptic clerics who refused to recant their beliefs.30\nThere was another religious minority that suffered even more than the\nMonophysites from the reinstitution of Byzantine control: Jewish people. Despised by\nChristians of all denominations, Syria\u2019s long-suffering Jewish population had enjoyed a\nbrief respite under Sassanid rule before enduring renewed persecution following the\nPersian withdrawal. In many ways, in fact, their circumstances had gotten considerably\nworse following Syria\u2019s return to Byzantine rule than they had been before the Persian\noccupation. Most notoriously, in 632, Heraclius decreed that all Jewish people living\nwithin the empire had to undergo forcible conversion to Christianity.31\nUnsurprisingly, given this situation, the people of the Middle East did little to\noppose the Arabs. Experiencing severe persecution at the very moment that the\ninvaders were surging out of Arabia, the Copts, Jacobites, and Jews who lived in Syria\nand Egypt were disinclined to risk their lives resisting the Arabs. Indeed, recalling recent\nByzantine persecution, many cities opted to come to terms with the Arabs rather than\nresist them. Some later sources even suggest that the conquered people may have\npreferred the Arabs to their previous imperial masters. For instance, the medieval Arab\nhistorian Al-Baladhuri (820-892) related that the Syrian city of Hims requested Arab help\nwhen threatened with recapture by Heraclius, declaring that \u201c[w]e like your rule and\njustice far better than the state of oppression and tyranny in which we\u201d lived under\nByzantine authority. Meanwhile, fear that Alexandria\u2019s huge Coptic population would\nhelp the Arabs enter the city played an important part in leading Cyrus to surrender the\ncity in 642. Concerns that religious minorities would help the Arabs were not overblown.\nTextual evidence shows that the Arabs captured the city of Caesarea only after a\nJewish resident eager to end Christian harassment revealed to them a secret passage\nthrough its walls.32\nExhausted Empires\nFinally, and most importantly, modern-day historians maintain that the peculiarly\nfeeble state of the Byzantine and Persian Empires in the early-seventh centuries proved\npivotal in making the Arab Conquest possible. Their weakness had two sources. The\nfirst was a catastrophic outbreak of bubonic plague in the sixth century known in the\nByzantine Empire as the Plague of Justinian. The pandemic was a product of global\ntrade. Travelling along the Silk Road, rat-borne fleas brought it from the east to Persia\nand the Mediterranean world in the early 540s. There, it spread rapidly in a series of\ndevastating waves that resulted in the deaths of millions. Ruinous for the Persians, it\n30 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 8\u20139, 67, 142\u201346.\n31 Tom Holland, In the Shadow of the Sword: The Birth of Islam and the Rise of the\nGlobal Arab Empire (New York: Doubleday, 2012), 296.\n32 Quote from Al-Baladhuri, \u201cThe Battle of The Yarmuk (636) and After\u201d; Lewis, God\u2019s\nCrucible, 81\u201382; Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 89. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 48\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nproved particularly damaging to the highly urban Byzantine Empire. Moving from city to\ncity along trade routes, it produced a dispiriting 25 percent decline in the population over\nthe course of the sixth century alone. The plague not only demoralized the people of\nthese empires, but also confronted both states with a brutally challenging fiscal\nsituation. Each still had to guard the same borders and to maintain the same\ninfrastructure that had existed before the outbreak, yet they now had to do so with\nsubstantially reduced populations that generated commensurately less tax revenue than\nthey had in the past.33\nSecond, just before the Arab invasions, the two empires had waged a\ndebilitating, twenty-six-year-long conflict known as the Byzantine-Sassanid War.\nEnormously costly, it left both empires in political, economic, and, especially, military\ndisarray. The conflict had its origins in a Byzantine coup. In 602, a low-ranking army\nofficer named Phocas (r. 602-610) seized power by deposing and killing Emperor\nMaurice (r. 582-602). The Persian shah, Chosroes II (r. 590-628), sensed opportunity in\nthe turmoil that subsequently engulfed Constantinople; accordingly, having been helped\ninto power by Maurice, he used the coup as a pretext to declare war. Phocas reacted\nincompetently. Better at seizing power than at ruling, his main response\u2014stripping the\nDanube River of troops for use against Persia\u2014backfired badly. Not only did the\npowerful nomadic Avars take advantage by invading the Balkans, but the repositioned\ntroops failed to prevent Chosroes II from making substantial incursions into Byzantine\nMesopotamia. These setbacks did little to help the already-unpopular Phocas, and he\nsoon confronted a series of plots and outright revolts that only ended when Heraclius,\nthe powerful governor of North Africa, landed in Constantinople and seized the throne.34\nThe situation worsened considerably during the early years of Heraclius\u2019s reign.\nTaking advantage of the instability that followed Phocas\u2019s downfall, Chosroes II\u2019s armies\nbroke through the Byzantine defenses in northern Mesopotamia in the early 610s. Now\nable to operate unhindered, they quickly occupied Syria, Egypt, and Palestine. It was a\nhuge defeat for Constantinople. The loss of these provinces and the vital grain and tax\nrevenues that they produced enormously complicated efforts to mount a counterattack.\nThe situation was so bleak in the early 620s, in fact, that Heraclius gave serious\nconsideration to relocating his government to the city of Carthage in North Africa.\nUltimately, however, the emperor opted not to pursue that drastic course. Instead, he\nimplemented a series of military and fiscal changes that he hoped would reinvigorate\nthe army and thus lead to victory.35\n33 William Rosen, Justinian\u2019s Flea: The First Great Plague and the End of the Roman\nEmpire (New York: Penguin Books, 2007), 1\u20133, 315\u201319; See also Kyle Harper, The\nFate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2017).\n34 John Moorhead, The Roman Empire Divided: 400-700 AD (New York: Pearson,\n2001), 172\u201373.\n35 Holland, In the Shadow of the Sword, 289\u201391. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 49\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nHeraclius\u2019s reforms proved successful. While the Persians and their new allies,\nthe Avars, unsuccessfully besieged Constantinople in 626, the emperor launched a bold\ncounterstroke through Armenia. After ravaging the Persian Empire\u2019s northern provinces,\nhe marched into Iraq and decisively routed the Sassanid army at the Battle of Nineveh\nin 627. That defeat marked the end for Chosroes II. Weary of the war and the taxes it\nrequired, Persian aristocrats deposed and executed him and then elevated his son to\nthe throne. The new shah promptly sued for peace. Relieved, Heraclius accepted, and\nthe two empires returned to their prewar borders.36\nWhile the long war imposed huge costs on both empires, its impact was greatest\non Persia. Politically, defeat thoroughly discredited its ruling house and tipped power\ntoward the nobility; as a consequence, it experienced four years of court intrigue and\ncivil war during which a succession of seven short-tenured shahs ruled. Only with the\naccession of Yazdgard III to the throne in 632 did Persia once again experience a\nsemblance of political stability. The conflict\u2019s fiscal and economic consequences were\nevery bit as dire. The long war had been tremendously expensive and had resulted in\nthe devastation of several economically critical provinces and in a concomitant steep\ndecline in tax receipts that left the government with inadequate revenue to rebuild its\nthoroughly depleted military. Thus, Persia was uncharacteristically feeble following the\nwar with the Byzantine Empire. With its army weakened, its political system\ndestabilized, and its economy gutted, the empire that Yazdgard III inherited was a\nshadow of its former self\u2014a state that was in no position to repel a serious attack.37\nWhile Heraclius avoided the kind of political challenges that Chosroes II\u2019s\nsuccessors faced, he too confronted serious fiscal and military problems in the conflict\u2019s\nwake. The expense of the lengthy war and the temporary loss of the empire\u2019s two most\neconomically vital provinces\u2014Syria and Egypt\u2014had placed enormous strain on the\nempire\u2019s fiscal position. As a result, the Byzantine treasury came out of the conflict in no\nposition to support another war. Meanwhile, the empire\u2019s once firm defenses had\nsuffered greatly as a result of neglect and wartime exigencies. Compelled to maintain\nthe bulk of its army on the Persian front, Constantinople could no longer keep the Avars\nand Slavs at bay and had to accept the loss of its traditional defensive line along the\nDanube River. The situation was even more dire in the recently recovered provinces of\nSyria and Egypt. There, the empire confronted the daunting task of completely\nrebuilding its shattered defensive positions immediately following the conflict\u2014a task\nthat promised to take many years. Thus, like Persia, the Byzantine Empire emerged\nfrom the war ill prepared to resist a concerted attack.38\n36 Edward N. Luttwak, The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire (Cambridge: The\nBelknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2011), 399\u2013408.\n37 Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000 (New\nYork: Penguin Books, 2009), 258.\n38 Moorhead, The Roman Empire Divided, 205; Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests,\n70\u201371. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 50\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nScholars today largely agree that the feebleness of these venerable empires\nfollowing their long war with each other was the most pivotal factor in setting the stage\nfor the success of the Arabs in the 630s and 640s. Militarily weakened, economically\nstrapped, and, in Persia\u2019s case, politically destabilized, they proved to be easy pickings\nfor the Arabs\u2019 small, but well-led and highly mobile armies. Thus, contingency\u2014luck\u2014\nplayed an outsized part in the astonishing success of the Arab Conquest. As the\nhistorian Hugh Kennedy puts it, \u201c[i]f Islam had been born fifty years earlier, and the early\nMuslims had attempted to raid Syria and Palestine in the 580s not the 630s, there can\nbe little doubt that they would have been sent off very quickly, as the provinces were\nfirmly controlled by the government and the defenses well organized.\u201d39\nEarly Islamic Government\nArab leaders were pleased with the extent and speed of the conquests, but they\nalso understood that the rapid acquisition of a huge empire created significant practical\nchallenges that they would need to quickly address if they were to retain possession of\nthe valuable territory they had seized. Two issues were particularly pressing. First, they\nhad to determine how they were going to administer the huge number of non-Muslims\nthat they had conquered. Second, they had to develop political structures to ensure that\npower did not decentralize as the empire expanded but instead remained firmly in the\nhands of the central government in Medina. Resolving those challenges fell initially on\nthe shoulders of Umar and his successor, Uthman\u2014the two men who oversaw the most\nexplosive phases of the early Arab conquest. Despite his background as a relatively\nmodest merchant, Umar proved remarkably adept at managing the growth of the empire\nand at addressing the problems that came with rapid expansion. Uthman, in contrast,\nwas unable to deal as effectively with those issues; as a consequence, the empire\nwould experience significant upheaval during the latter part of his reign.\nUmar (r. 634-644)\nAs his armies began racking up victory after astonishing victory, Umar grappled\nwith the question of how his government could best administer the newly acquired\nterritories and the huge, non-Muslim populations that they contained. According to the\ntraditional Muslim narrative of the conquests, he addressed these issues by hewing\nclosely to Qur\u02beanic decree and to Muhammad\u2019s earlier practices. Thus, he did not order\nthe forcible conversion of those now living under Arab rule. Instead, honoring the\nQur\u02bean\u2019s declaration that \u201cthere is no compulsion in religion,\u201d he gave defeated\npeople\u2014particularly the \u201cPeople of the Book,\u201d meaning Christians Jews, and, later,\nZoroastrians\u2014three choices: conversion to Islam, death, or submission to Muslim\npolitical authority as dhimmi, meaning, literally, protected people. (Qur\u02bean, 2:256).40\nUmar\u2019s decision to rule the conquered territories indirectly and with a light hand\nmade this last choice a hard one to refuse. Cities that surrendered could continue to\n39 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 70.\n40 Kennedy, 373. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 51\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nadminister themselves as they had in the past, and merely had to agree to collect and\nforward the jizya, a poll tax paid by the dhimmi, to the central government in Medina.\nThese were remarkably easy conditions made even more palatable by the fact that the\njizya may have been less financially burdensome than the levies that the Byzantines\nand Persians had previously imposed. Meanwhile, aware that his government lacked\nthe institutional capacity to rule the new lands at the local level, he opted to retain the\nexisting Byzantine and Persian administrative institutions\u2014after all, the bureaucrats\nwho staffed them excelled at the critical task of collecting taxes. Finally, he chose to\ncontinue to use Greek and Persian as the languages of administration in the conquered\nterritories. Collectively, these were unusually lenient terms, which, by encouraging many\ncities to surrender rather than to resist, paid substantial dividends for Umar and the\nArabs.41\nUmar also took the first, critical steps toward ensuring that political power did not\ndecentralize as the empire expanded. He refused to let Arab soldiers seize land\u2014which\nwould have provided them with enough wealth to be independent of Medina\u2014and\ninstead stationed them in newly founded garrison towns such as Kufa and Basra in Iraq\nand Fustat (Cairo) in Egypt. This decision had far-reaching consequences. It kept the\nsoldiers concentrated and thus ready for further military operations, and it ensured that\nthey did not assimilate into the local culture\u2014thus preserving their Arab-Muslim identity.\nUmar next set up a sophisticated fiscal system wherein an office called the diwan used\nthe proceeds of the jizya to pay salaries to Arab warriors. By keeping the soldiers\nfinancially dependent, this arrangement ensured that they remained firmly under the\ncontrol of the central government. Finally, Umar appointed governors, or amirs, to\noversee the conquered territories and to ensure that the Arabs carried out his will.42\nUthman (r 644-656)\nUmar\u2019s successor, Uthman, had a far more difficult time administering the\nevolving empire and at balancing the different interests within it. Indeed, discontent\u2014\nparticularly among the Alids\u2014beset his rule from the very start. Still seething that the\nleading Muslims had passed Ali over in 632 and again in 634, they anticipated that he\nwould finally become caliph following Umar\u2019s death at the hands of an insane Persian\nslave in 644. Unsurprisingly, they greeted the news that Ali had once again been\nsidelined with incredulity and fury. They were especially incensed by the fact that\nUthman was from Banu Umayya\u2014the clan that had most stridently opposed\nMuhammad in the 610s and 620s and whose members had resisted Islam until,\nconveniently it seemed, they had finally felt moved to convert just as the prophet was\ntaking control of Mecca. Ali shared his followers\u2019 disappointment. Not wanting to stoke\ndissension, however, he agreed to acknowledge Uthman as the new leader of the\numma. This move eased the tension that had followed the new caliph\u2019s succession and\n41 Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2002), 36.\n42 Donner, Muhammad and the Believers, 136; Aslan, No God but God (Updated\nEdition), 125. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 52\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nhelped ensure that Uthman enjoyed broad support at the start of his reign. Still, below\nthe surface, there remained a latent, if as-yet inchoate dissatisfaction with Uthman\u2019s\nselection among the Alids and some other important groups.43\nA series of controversial decisions on Uthman\u2019s part soon brought that discontent\nto the surface. First, early in his reign, he had authorized the production of an official,\ncanonical version of the Qur\u02bean. This action was uncontroversial in itself, but his related\ndecree that all other variants had to be destroyed provoked heated opposition both from\nMuslims who preferred those versions and from those who believed that he was\noverstepping his authority. Second, lacking Umar\u2019s charisma and forceful nature, he\nhad found maintaining control of the empire increasingly difficult. To compensate, he\nreplaced the existing amirs with members of Banu Umayya. This decision was not an\nunreasonable one\u2014after all, he could rely on his kinsmen to carry out his wishes\u2014but it\nalienated many of the older Muslims who resented the fact that they were increasingly\nunder the rule of the Umayyad clan that had so bitterly resisted Muhammad and his\nreligious message. Finally, seeking to consolidate the empire before it expanded further,\nUthman brought the first phase of the Arab Conquest to a close in 651. This change did\nnot adversely affect those already on the diwan and thus engendered little opposition\namong the veterans of the earlier campaigns. However, it produced significant\ndiscontent among new recruits who thereafter did not have the opportunity to earn the\nmilitary experience needed to start receiving a salary\u2014a state of affairs that they found\nparticularly galling in light of the fact that a growing share of those who received\ncompensation did so not because they had fought in the wars of expansion but because\ntheir fathers had.44\nUthman\u2019s position rapidly deteriorated after 650 as discontent with these\ndecisions spread. By 655, the situation had gotten so bad that factions like the Alids and\nthe Ansar were loudly demanding a series of sweeping changes to the government, and\nthe garrison towns of Iraq were in outright revolt. The end came in 656. Seeking redress\nfor their grievances, armed delegations from Egypt and Mesopotamia descended on\nMedina where they discovered that the rest of the Muslim elite\u2014including, most notably,\nAli\u2014had forsaken Uthman and that the caliph was thus vulnerable and unprotected.\nStill, while his position may have been weak, Uthman nonetheless refused to accede to\ntheir demands. Infuriated by his obduracy, the mob responded by forcing its way into his\nhouse and murdering him while he was reading the Qur\u02bean.45\nThe First Fitna\nThe assassination of Uthman came as a great shock to the umma and initiated a\nlong period of instability marked by political conflict and outright fitnas, or civil wars, that\nlasted from 656 to 692. This era was pivotal in the political evolution of the umma and\u2014\nas we shall see in chapter four\u2014in the emergence of competing sects of Islam. It was a\n43 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 126\u201327.\n44 Kennedy, Caliphate, 17\u201319, 24.\n45 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 73\u201375. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 53\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\ntime in which divergent attitudes about who could lead the community, about how that\nperson was to be selected, and about the nature of the caliph\u2019s responsibilities began to\ntake clear form. It was also a period in which the government transformed from a\npersonal and consensual one based on traditional Arab practices to an absolutist,\nmonarchical one patterned after the government of the Byzantine state.\nAli (r. 656-661)\nThe first order of business following Uthman\u2019s death was the selection of a new\ncaliph. Ali was the obvious choice, and he at last became the new leader of the umma.\nDelighted that he had finally assumed the office that they believe he had been unjustly\ndenied, his Alid backers rejoiced. Their elation would prove premature, however.\nDominated by the First Fitna, his tenure as caliph was marked by a series of challenges\nto his legitimacy that included the first large-scale bloodshed between rival Muslim\nforces. As a result, while of enormous political and religious significance, his reign would\nalso prove to be a brief and unhappy one.46\nThe first challenge to Ali came from Muhammad\u2019s widow, \u02bfA\u02beisha, and two of the\nprophet\u2019s former companions, Talhah (594-656) and Zubayr (594-656). Though they\nappeared nominally supportive of Ali immediately following Uthman\u2019s murder, they were\nin fact looking for an opportunity to rally people against him. The new caliph soon\nobliged. Eager to restore order in chaotic Medina, he felt compelled to pardon the men\ninvolved in Uthman\u2019s murder. This decision gave \u02bfA\u02beisha, Talhah, and Zubayr the\nexcuse they were seeking. Using Ali\u2019s failure to prosecute Uthman\u2019s killers as a pretext,\nthey declared themselves in revolt and went to the garrison town of Basra to raise an\narmy. Having not yet fully consolidated power, Ali perceived this challenge to be a\nserious one. Accordingly, desperate to nip it in the bud, he recruited troops in Kufa\u2014\nincluding some who had participated in Uthman\u2019s murder\u2014to bolster his forces before\nmarching to Basra in late 656. There, in a contest known as the Battle of the Camel\nbecause the fiercest fighting took place around the mount \u02bfA\u02beisha was riding, Ali\u2019s army\nwon a decisive victory. Talhah and Zubayr both died in the battle while \u02bfA\u02beisha, whose\nstatus as the Prophet\u2019s wife insulated her from more serious consequences, was\ncompelled to live out the rest of her life in quiet retirement in Medina.47\nThe Battle of Siffin, 657\nAlmost immediately after defeating \u02bfA\u02beisha and her supporters, Ali confronted a\nconsiderably more serious challenge: a revolt by the powerful amir of Syria, Muawiyah\nibn Abi Sufyan (r. 661-680) of Banu Umayya. A savvy leader, the amir had deftly caught\nthe caliph in a bind. Pointing to Ali\u2019s reliance on the very soldiers involved in the death\nof his relative Uthman, Muawiyah declared that he would not acknowledge Ali as caliph\nuntil the latter had first punished the men who had killed Uthman\u2014a demand that the\namir knew the caliph could not meet in light of his dependence on Uthman\u2019s murderers.\n46 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 131\u201332, 134.\n47 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 75\u201377. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 54\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nInitially a war of words, the dispute devolved into civil war in 657. That summer,\nMuawiyah began marching his troops down the Euphrates River from Syria while Ali\nbrought his up from Kufa. The two armies met at the Battle of Siffin near modern-day\nRaqqa in late July. The fighting did not go well for Muawiyah, and his army soon stood\non the brink of defeat. In response, the amir pursued a desperate gambit. He ordered\nhis soldiers to stick pages of the Qur\u02bean on their spears and to call for arbitration in a bid\nto sow dissension in Ali\u2019s army. The ploy worked. Realizing that many of his soldiers\nwould not continue the fight if he refused the offer of arbitration, a frustrated Ali felt that\nhe had no choice but to accept Muawiyah\u2019s proposal.48\nNew Challenges\nIn two ways, this decision proved to be a serious misstep on Ali\u2019s part. First,\nMuawiyah\u2019s arbitrator, the conqueror of Egypt, al-As, ran rings around Ali\u2019s\nrepresentative, Abu Musa Ashari (?-c. 662 or 672). As skilled at negotiating as he was\nat leading troops into battle, al-As tricked Ashari into accepting an agreement that called\nfor both Muawiyah and Ali to renounce their claims to the caliphate, after which a shura\nwould choose a new leader. Ali was furious. Though Ashari cast the agreement as a\ncompromise, he instead perceived it to be a one-sided deal that caught him on the\nhorns of a dilemma. If he accepted it, he would no longer be caliph; if he instead refused\nto abide by a process that he had freely entered into, he woul lose credibility within the\numma. Ali\u2019s assessment proved correct. Disenchanted with him when he made clear\nthat he refused to accept the terms of the deal, many of his Iraqi supporters either\nabandoned him or\u2014worse\u2014switched sides.49\nSecond, and more troubling, was the reaction of a small, radical group of Ali\u2019s\nsoldiers who soon came to be known as Kharijites, or \u201cseceders.\u201d Their objections\ncentered on the caliph\u2019s willingness to enter into arbitration with his rebellious\nsubordinate. In their view, Ali had been obligated as caliph to enforce divine justice by\nattacking the rebellious Muawiyah. If the amir was guilty, God would ensure that he was\ndefeated; if Muawiyah was instead in the right, God would see his army to victory.\nArbitration was thus tantamount to a usurpation of God\u2019s power to judge, a sin so grave\nin the Kharijites\u2019 eyes that it rendered Ali\u2019s rule illegitimate and entitled\u2014indeed\nrequired\u2014the community of believers to depose him. Accordingly, chanting \u201c\u2018only God\ncan decide,\u2019\u201d the Kharijite extremists abandoned Ali in disgust once he agreed to\narbitration and began plotting his overthrow.50\nTo achieve that goal, the Kharijites self-consciously pursued a course patterned\nafter Muhammad\u2019s actions four decades earlier. Just as Muhammad had retreated\nduring the hijra and reestablished his movement in Medina when faced with a greater\npower, so, too, did the Kharijites withdraw\u2014initially to central Iraq and later to Arabia\n48 Lewis, God\u2019s Crucible, 90\u201392.\n49 Lewis, 92.\n50 Gerald R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750,\n2nd Edition (New York: Routledge, 2000), 28\u201330. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 55\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nand Persia. Likewise, just as the Prophet had established a new, ideal community of\nbelievers in his new home, so, too, did they act to make their state the perfect Muslim\nsociety. Finally, just as Muhammad had waged war against his Meccan enemies from\nhis new base, so, too, did the Kharijites mount a campaign against Ali from their new\nhome.51\nThus, Ali was in an increasingly weak position following the Battle of Siffin. Not\nonly did both Muawiyah and the Kharijites continue to deny that he was the legitimate\ncaliph, but, more broadly, his refusal to abide by the arbitrators\u2019 decision had seriously\ndamaged his legitimacy within the umma. Even his successes came with caveats. Most\nnotably, while his effort to bring the Kharijites to heel met with substantial success in\n658 and thus solidified his hold on Iraq, it also drew his attention away from the more\nserious challenge that Muawiyah posed and, in so doing, gave his Umayyad rival the\ntime both to rebuild his army and to gain control of the wealthy province of Egypt. By\n661, as a result, Muawiyah had once again emerged as a serious menace to Ali\u2019s\nposition.52\nNow focused on the threat that Muawiyah posed, the caliph massed his army in\nKufa in 661 in preparation for a campaign against Syria designed to finally bring the\ninsubordinate amir to heel. He never got the chance to lead it, however. Instead, the\nday before the campaign was to begin, a Kharijite assassin struck Ali with a sword as he\nentered the mosque in Kufa to pray. It was a glancing blow that did little physical harm;\nhowever, the weapon had been treated with a powerful poison that slowly killed the\ncaliph over the next two days. The political consequences of his death were enormous.\nWith Ali gone and his supporters hopelessly divided, there was no one left to stand up\nto Muawiyah; as a result, the way was now paved for the amir to become caliph.53\nPolitical Debates\nThe First Fitna proved enormously significant for the rapidly evolving Islamic\npolity. It not only settled the short-term question of who would control the empire, but,\nmore importantly, also gave form to three competing schools of thought regarding both\nwho was eligible to serve as Commander of the Faithful and what authority that person\nwould hold. The first, advanced by Ali\u2019s supporters, maintained that the rightful\nsuccessors descended from Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah (?-632) and her\nhusband, Ali, and that the caliph served as both a secular ruler and as a divinely-\nendowed religious leader, or Imam.54 The second position, held by those who supported\nMuawiyah, asserted instead that the leader of the umma had to come from the Quraysh\ntribe and that while the caliph was obligated to uphold the Qur\u02bean, the position was a\nfundamentally secular one with no special religious role or powers. The third view,\n51 John L. Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, Fourth Edition (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2011), 46\u201347.\n52 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 137.\n53 Aslan, 137\u201338.\n54 Not to be confused with ordinary imams, or prayer leaders. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 56\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nadvocated by the Kharijites, likewise held that the caliph\u2019s role was secular, but took a\nvery different view regarding the question of who could serve. For them, the caliph\u2019s\ntribal affiliation and ancestry were irrelevant. Instead, the sole qualification that mattered\nwas piety; in their eyes, only the most devout were eligible to serve as caliph and those\nthat did had to remain free of sin for the duration of their reigns.55\nInchoate as they were in the 650s, these schools of thought regarding who\nshould rule proved to be enormously influential. As we shall see in chapter four, the fact\nthat religion and politics were so tightly bound together at that time meant that the\nopposing views held by the supporters of Muawiyah and Ali would produce parallel\nreligious understandings that would gradually evolve into competing Islamic sects. For\nits part, the Kharijite conception of the caliph\u2019s authority never gained widespread\nsupport and thus did not produce a distinct religious perspective. Still, even it remained\npowerfully influential. Indeed, as we shall see, the Kharijites\u2019 puritanical beliefs,\nendorsement of terrorism, and strategy of retreating before counterattacking would\nremain influential and would continue to profoundly shape extremist movements in the\nMuslim world through the present day.56\nThe Establishment of the Umayyad Dynasty\nWhile Kharijism would exert a strong influence on extremist groups in the future,\nit was the new caliph, Muawiyah, who would define the political structure of the Arab\nEmpire as it emerged from the First Fitna. He did so in the process of responding to two\nrelated issues that the civil war with Ali had revealed. First, the conflict had\ndemonstrated that the umma would likely once more devolve into internal strife following\nhis death if he did not first find some means of stabilizing and institutionalizing the\nsuccession. Second, the factionalism and anarchy of the First Fitna had made clear that\nthe traditional, tribal system of personal loyalty that lay at the heart of the caliphate\u2019s\nexisting administrative arrangement was not up to the task of overseeing a massive,\nsedentary empire.57\nRuling from Damascus, he based his reforms on the institutions of the caliphate\u2019s\nmain rival: the Byzantine Empire. Drawing on three of its defining political practices, he\ntransformed the government he inherited into a highly stratified and centralized system\nthat lodged enormous power in the caliph\u2019s hands. First, he replaced the caliphate\u2019s\ninformal system of governance with a stratified and highly efficient bureaucracy\npatterned on the Byzantine system of administration. Central to that effort was the\ncreation of a chancery to oversee government finances and a postal service to improve\ncommunications. Second, he remade the position of caliph from one that ruled on the\nbasis of persuasion and consensus into one patterned after the Byzantine Empire\u2019s\nabsolutist emperors. Thereafter, he and his successors would no longer present\n55 Kennedy, Caliphate, 5, 26\u201329.\n56 John L.

Finally, determined to institutionalize a system of succession that would\navoid the conflict that had ensued following Uthman\u2019s death, he adopted the Byzantine\nsystem of hereditary succession and named his son, Yazid (r. 680-683), to succeed\nhim\u2014thereby establishing the Umayyad Dynasty.58\nThe majority of Muslims came to accept these changes, if perhaps grudgingly.\nMany were unenthusiastic about Muawiyah and grumbled that his assumption of\nimperial powers was alien to Muhammad\u2019s vision of a just and equitable society.\nDespite these reservations, however, opposition was muted. Wishing to avoid a\nrepetition of the anarchy that had accompanied the First Fitna, most welcomed the\nreturn to order that Muawiyah had brought to the umma.59\nThe Battle of Karbala, 680\nStill, there remained a minority who balked at the changes that he had effected.\nThe most vociferous among them were the Shi\u2019atu Ali. Unlike many other Muslims, they\ndid not object to having an hereditary system of government; however, they stridently\nopposed the idea of having the succession run through Banu Umayya and argued with\ngrowing fervor that it should instead follow the descendants of Muhammad through the\nline of Fatimah and Ali. The leader of the Alids at that time, Ali\u2019s son Husayn (626-680),\nreluctantly came to share this view. Though he had been content to focus quietly on his\nreligious studies in Medina, Yazid\u2019s accession to the caliphate repelled him and led him\nto declare that he was the rightful caliph.60\nHusayn moved quickly to organize the Alids against the Umayyad government.\nLacking significant military support in the Hijaz, he left Medina in the late summer of 680\nwith a small contingent of soldiers and marched northward hoping to rally the strongly\npro-Alid garrison town of Kufa to his cause. He never made it. Instead, the Umayyad\ngovernor of Iraq foiled his plan by first intimidating the soldiers in Kufa into inaction and\nthen intercepting Husayn\u2019s force shortly after it had entered Iraq. In the ensuing Battle of\nKarbala, Yazid\u2019s troops handily crushed Husayn\u2019s tiny force. The Umayyad victory was\nso total, in fact, that it appeared to have ended once and for all the Alid movement.\nEvents soon made clear that this impression was inaccurate, however. As we shall see\nin chapter four, Husayn\u2019s defeat did not mark the end of the Alids; instead, Karbala\nbecame a pivotal moral victory in their eyes\u2014one that marked the moment that the the\nShi\u02bfatu Ali transformed from a political movement into a full-blown religious sect.61\n58 Lapidus, 47\u201351.\n59 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 36.\n60 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 67\u201369.\n61 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 40\u201343. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 58\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nThe Second Fitna\nYazid likely would have institutionalized the stable system of succession that his\nfather had sought to put in place had he enjoyed a long reign, but his death in 683 and\nthe passing of his son and successor only two months later created a power vacuum\nthat left Umayyad rule in complete disarray. As a result, the fighting between Yazid\u2019s\ntroops and the Alids that had begun in 680 morphed into a broader series of challenges\nto Umayyad legitimacy known as the Second Fitna (680-692). It was a chaotic time for\nthe caliphate. While Umayyad forces retained control of Syria and Egypt, they faced\nchallenges in every other part of the empire. In Mecca, the prominent Qurayshi Abd\nAllah ibn al-Zubayr (624-692) declared himself caliph shortly after Yazid\u2019s death.\nMeanwhile, a pro-Alid revolutionary named Mukhtar ibn Abi Ubayd (622-687) seized\ncontrol of Iraq, and the revived Kharijites reasserted themselves in central Arabia.\nHopes that the accession of the new Umayyad caliph, Marwan (r. 684-685) would arrest\nthe decline of the dynasty\u2019s fortunes died with him the following year. Indeed, by the\ntime his son Abd al-Malik (r. 685-705) took the throne in 685, the Umayyad Dynasty\nappeared to be doomed to imminent collapse.62\nTo the surprise of many observers, it did not. Instead, Abd al-Malik\u2019s accession to\nthe caliphate proved to be a turning point for the dynasty. A dynamic and charismatic\nleader, he had the determination, intelligence, and strength of will to restore Umayyad\ncontrol of the empire. He began by quickly consolidating his position in Damascus. With\nSyria firmly under his control, he then ordered his trusted lieutenant, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf\n(661-714), to reestablish Umayyad authority over Iraq and to bring al-Zubayr and the\nKharijites to heel. As decisive as Abd al-Malik, al-Hajjaj easily intimidated the Iraqis into\ncapitulating in 691 before taking his army into the Hijaz. There, he demonstrated his\ncharacteristic ruthlessness by bombarding Mecca with catapults\u2014some projectiles even\nstruck the Ka\u02bfba itself\u2014before defeating al-Zubayr in 692. Having secured Mecca, he\nthen brought the Second Fitna to a close by crushing the Kharijites in central Arabia.63\nThe Great Leap Forward\nWith Abd al-Malik having solidified the dynasty\u2019s position, he and his Umayyad\nsuccessors were finally in a position to continue Muawiyah\u2019s effort to remake the\ncaliphate. Much of what they did built directly on his earlier efforts. For example, they\nfurther institutionalized the system of hereditary succession and absolutist rule that he\nhad pioneered, and they expanded the bureaucratic system that he institutionalized. At\nthe same time, however, these caliphs also broke new ground by implementing a series\nof enormously consequential new policies. They restarted the wars of conquest,\nundertook a number of important symbolic actions aimed at strengthening the caliph\u2019s\nauthority, and, most importantly, took steps to erode the sharp line that had heretofore\nexisted between the Muslim Arab conquerors and the vastly more numerous subject\npeoples. This last initiative proved particularly consequential. With it, the Umayyads set\n62 Kennedy, Caliphate, 42\u201344.\n63 Armstrong, Islam, 44; Kennedy, Caliphate, 45.

First, he decreed that the\nissuance of currency was a prerogative reserved solely to the caliph and ordered the\nminting of coins with his name on them. Thereafter, the gold dinar replaced the\nByzantine solidus and the silver dirham supplanted the Sassanid drachm. Of great\nsymbolic significance, this change not only demonstrated the central government\u2019s\nauthority following the instability of the Second Fitna but, in banning the amirs from\nminting currency, also made clear that they were subordinate to the caliph. Second, he\nand his successor, al-Walid I (r. 705-715), commissioned monumental works of\narchitecture\u2014most notably the Dome of the Rock Mosque (692) on the Temple Mount\nand the Damascus Mosque (715). Designed to exalt Islam and to make clear its\npermanence, these monuments served an important secondary purpose as tangible\nsigns of the caliphs\u2019 power.65\nRenewed Wars of Conquest\nAbd al-Malik also moved to restore the power of the caliph by restarting the wars\nof expansion. Since the first phase of the Arab Conquest had ended in 651, caliphal\narmies had won almost no new territory. In part, this lengthy pause in the empire\u2019s\nexpansion was a function of the civil wars that had dominated the 650s and 680s.\nDuring both fitnas, the Arabs had been too preoccupied with internal conflict to engage\nin efforts aimed at securing new territory. Even when they had been able to wage\noffensive wars during this period, moreover, they had been unsuccessful. Indeed, the\nmost notable effort to expand the empire at that time\u2014Muawiyah\u2019s lengthy siege of\nConstantinople in the 670s\u2014had ended in abject failure. Still, lingering memories of this\nsetback aside, al-Malik saw great value in restarting the wars of conquest. Reasoning\nas Abu Bakr had five decades earlier that he could best maintain internal peace and\nassert caliphal authority by directing the energies of the Arabs outward, he followed his\nvictory in the Second Fitna by ordering Muslim armies to return to the offensive.66\nThey started in North Africa. There, Arab soldiers made rapid gains against the\nByzantine Empire. Moving with characteristic speed and boldness, they secured\npossession of the city of Carthage and the rich grainlands of the Maghreb in 698. They\nfollowed by crossing the Strait of Gibraltar in 711 to invade the Visigothic Kingdom that\nruled Spain. According to Arab sources, they were assisted in this bold move by Julian,\nthe rogue Byzantine governor of the North African city of Ceuta. Furious that Roderic (?-\n64 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 138.\n65 Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome, 292\u201393.\n66 Lewis, God\u2019s Crucible, 94, 98; Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 216.

By\n716, Umayyad forces had completely destroyed the Visigothic Kingdom and occupied\nthe entire peninsula save for the upland region in the far northeast. Even then, the\ncaliph\u2019s army did not stop pressing forward. On the contrary, Arab forces pushed on into\nWestern Europe\u2014stopping only when the Frankish ruler Charles Martel (r. 718-741)\nmanaged to check their advance at the Battle of Poitiers in south-central France in\n732.67\nIn the meantime, al-Walid I had restarted the wars of conquest in the east. These\nnew attacks followed two axes: a northern one into Central Asia and a southern one into\nthe Indus River Valley. Both campaigns were successful. In the south, an Arab army\noperating out of Iran took possession of the valuable region of Sind during the early\nyears of al-Walid I\u2019s reign in an operation that marked the first major Muslim incursion\ninto the Indian Subcontinent. In the north, meanwhile, a second army concurrently\nsurged across the Oxus River and into Transoxiana. In the process, it took possession\nof a number of key commercial centers including the entrepots of Bukhara and\nSamarkand and thus secured control over the western half of the Silk Road.68\nThe only notable setback for Arab armies during this period was the failure in 718\nof their second effort to conquer Constantinople. Massive in scale, the campaign came\nat the behest of the new caliph, Sulayman (r. 715-717), who sought a great victory to\nenhance his power. The results were disappointing. Though the army he dispatched\nwas substantial and though it enjoyed the support of a huge fleet, it proved unable to\nbreak through Constantinople\u2019s stout defenses. Instead, benefiting from the recent\ndevelopment of Greek Fire\u2014a secret incendiary weapon that proved especially effective\nagainst ships\u2014the city\u2019s defenders succeeded in turning the tables on the Arabs and in\ncompelling them to retreat in disorder in 718. Thereafter, the caliphate made no further\neffort to attack Constantinople and instead consigned itself to frequent raids into\nByzantine territory in eastern Anatolia.69\nIslamic Civilization\nMeanwhile in parallel with the renewed campaigns of conquest, the Umayyad\ncaliphs of the late-seventh and early-eighth centuries also effected a series of legal and\nsocial changes that would have far-reaching social and political ramifications. As with\nthe renewed wars of conquest and the symbolic elevation of the caliph, it was Abd al-\nMalik who initiated this process. Seeking to elevate the culture of the conquerors, he\nordered that Arabic would henceforth replace Greek and Persian as the language of\n67 Lewis, God\u2019s Crucible, 120.\n68 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 148\u201351, 190\u201395.\n69 Lewis, God\u2019s Crucible, 136\u201337. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 61\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nadministration throughout the empire. It was a sweeping ruling that had far-reaching\nconsequences. It required those who wished to work in the administration or who hoped\nto do business with it to learn the language of the conquerors; over time, as a result,\nArabic gradually displaced Coptic, Greek, and Aramaic as the dominant tongue in most\nof the empire. Only Persia resisted. Thanks to a proto-nationalist cultural rebirth it\nunderwent in the ninth century, that part of the empire proved impervious to spoken\nArabic. Even there, however, written Arabic made sufficient inroads that literate\nPersians gradually came to accept it as the basis for their system of writing. Thus, by\nthe year 1000, the process that Abd al-Malik had set in motion was nearly complete.\nArabic had become not only the dominant language of the Middle East, but also\u2014\nthanks to the caliphate\u2019s central position in long-distance trade networks\u2014the lingua\nfranca of commerce in a zone stretching from Central Asia in the north to East Africa in\nthe south, and from the Maghreb in the west to the ports of India in the east.70\nEven more significant for the people of the Arab Empire was a push to attract\nnon-Muslims to Islam. This new effort marked a significant change for the umma.\nThrough the early-eighth century, Muslims had made little effort to convert non-Arabs to\nIslam. On the contrary, jealous of the prerogatives that accompanied membership in the\nruling religion, most sought to prevent dhimmi from adopting their faith. Even the state\ntook steps to limit conversion. Concerned about the impact that the mass adoption of\nIslam would have on tax receipts, the government actively discouraged conversion and\nrequired those who became Muslims\u2014known as mawali or clients\u2014to continue to pay\nthe jizya tax assessed on the dhimmi. This approach was effective. Through the early\neighth century, conversion rates remained low, and the overwhelming majority of the\nsubject people retained the religion into which they had been born.71\nThat approach began to change under Umar II. Noted for his piety, the caliph\nhoped to encourage conversion to Islam and wished to end the mawalis\u2019 second-class\nstatus. Accordingly, he decreed that Muslims would henceforth pay the same taxes and\nbe accorded the same status whether they had been born into the religion or had\nconverted.72\nMeanwhile, though its provenance is disputed\u2014tradition holds that Umar I issued\nit\u2014Umar II was also likely responsible for the Covenant of Umar. Designed to formally\nestablish the status of non-Muslims in the empire, it enumerated the rights and\nrestrictions that would apply to the dhimmi. It barred them from riding horses or\nmarrying Muslim women, imposed on them a series of sartorial laws that required them\nto identify themselves by wearing certain clothing, prohibited them from building\nprominent houses of worship, and required them to show deference to Muslims. In\nexchange, the caliph promised to protect them and guaranteed that they would enjoy\nthe right to worship freely. The rights that the Covenant of Umar accorded to non-\n70 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 27.\n71 Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750, 76\u201378.\n72 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 161; Kennedy, Caliphate, 54. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 62\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nMuslims were substantial\u2014particularly during an era hardly noted for its religious\ntolerance. Still, the restrictions that it imposed were also significant and made life\nconsiderably less pleasant for the caliphate\u2019s non-Muslims.73\nTogether, the religious and fiscal changes that Umar II effected marked a critical\nturning point for Islam\u2019s growth in the Middle East. Over time, the carrot of lower taxes\nand the stick of greater restrictions on non-Muslims would help to spur a steady\nincrease in conversion. It is important to keep in mind that this change was very\ngradual; indeed, Egypt would remain predominantly Christian through the fourteenth\ncentury. Nonetheless, the demographic evidence makes clear that it was during Umar\nII\u2019s reign that conversion\u2014heretofore a trickle\u2014rose to a rate sufficient to ensure that\nIslam would eventually become the dominant religion in the Middle East.74\nAs significant, in conjunction with Abd al-Malik\u2019s reforms, Umar II\u2019s policies\nsubstantially weakened the barriers between conquered and conqueror and led to the\ngradual emergence of a new, hybrid, Islamic civilization. Importantly, though the Arabs\nwere clearly the dominant party, its creation was not simply a one-way street in which\nthe conquerors imposed their culture and religion on the dhimmi. Instead, it was a\ncomplex, two-way exchange in which, in the words or the historian Robert Hoyland, the\nconquered people \u201cabsorbed the Arabs and reshaped their values\u201d even as the Arabs\nadopted much of the existing culture of the region. Thus, Islamic art and literature\nderived more from pre-Islamic Persian than Arab traditions, while the legal system\nincorporated vast numbers of Roman rulings that belatedly gained approval as Muslim\nlaw when scholars interpreted Muhammad\u2019s words in ways that made him appear to be\ntheir source. The result was something new: an amalgamated civilization that was Arab\nin language and Islamic in religion, but with strong antecedents in the pre-Islamic\ncultures of both the conquerors and the subjugated.75\nUmayyad Decline\nWhile the Umayyads had enjoyed substantial success during the late-seventh\nand early-eighth centuries, they began to confront growing problems in the 730s and\n740s. Three issues in particular hamstrung the dynasty. First, the Umayyads gained a\nreputation as degenerate pleasure seekers whose lives of opulence and conspicuous\nconsumption were at sharp variance with the simplicity and morality of Muhammad and\nthe early community of believers. This perception was more caricature than reality, but,\nat great cost to the Umayyad Dynasty\u2019s legitimacy, it nonetheless gained widespread\nacceptance. Second, thanks to distance and the resilience of the remaining states that\nbordered the Arab Empire, the wars of conquest that Abd al-Malik had restarted\ngradually petered out by the end of the 720s. As a result, the Umayyads no longer\nenjoyed the fiscal ease that the steady influx of loot had afforded earlier caliphs. Finally,\nthe dynasty confronted a peculiarly challenging political dilemma. On the one hand, the\n73 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 47.\n74 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 161; Kennedy, Caliphate, 54.\n75 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 157\u201358. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 63\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\numma could not thrive without the order, efficient tax collection, and firm enforcement of\nthe laws that only a highly centralized government could provide; on the other, Islam\nwas a revolutionary and egalitarian religion that explicitly challenged the political and\neconomic hierarchies that were intrinsic to such a government. As a result of this\ntension, efforts to consolidate and enhance caliphal power\u2014however reasonable or\nnecessary\u2014produced bitter opposition among those who saw such initiatives as a\nreturn to the arbitrary and capricious practices of the empires that the Islamic revolution\nhad usurped.76\nThus, the Umayyads found themselves in an increasingly tenuous position by the\nmiddle of the eighth century. Facing a steadily worsening fiscal situation, the ruling\ndynasty now confronted opposition from many Muslims who seethed at a political order\nthat they believed ran counter to Islam\u2019s ethic of social justice and who resented a ruling\nclass that seemed to have abandoned Islam for hedonist excess. Indeed, though the\nUmayyads did not realize it, by the 740s, they were on very thin ice. At that point, all it\nwould take to overthrow the dynasty was the emergence of an organized, ideologically\nappealing, and militarily powerful opposition movement within the empire.77\nThe Abbasid Dynasty\nThe Abbasid Revolution\nSuch a movement emerged with great suddenness in the mid-740s in the\nprovince of Khurasan. Encompassing the far-northeast part of the empire, the province\ncontained large numbers of Arab transplants and Iranian mawali, who, as residents of a\nfrontier province, were quite proficient at warfare. By the 740s, both groups fumed with\nresentment at the Umayyads. The Arab residents of Khurasan objected to the Syrian\nArabs\u2019 dominance of the government and to the high levies that the Umayyad\u2019s\nassessed, while the mawali chafed at the lingering discrimination they experienced and\nat the dynasty\u2019s recent decision to reimpose the poll tax on them.78\nSeeking to tap into that resentment, a mysterious Persian provocateur named\nAbu Muslim (?-755) arrived in Khurasan in the mid 740s. He bore a straightforward and\napocalyptic message for the disgruntled people of the province: the Umayyad caliphs\nwere corrupt pleasure seekers who had perverted Muhammad\u2019s vision of the ideal,\negalitarian society. As such, devout Muslims were obligated to band together to\noverthrow the reigning Umayyad caliph and to replace him with a new ruler from\nMuhammad\u2019s clan, Banu Hashim. Abu Muslim\u2019s message fell on receptive ears\nthroughout the empire. Its revolutionary implications drew the disgruntled Arabs and\nmawali of Khurasan to his cause, while his call for a new government headed by a\n76 Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome, 292\u201395.\n77 Esposito, Islam, 54\u201355.\n78 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 201\u20136.

Under the\nblack banners that would become the hallmark of the dynasty that he helped put in\npower, his army seized control of the strategic city of Merv in 747 and then drove the\nUmayyad governor out of Khurasan in 748. Greatly strengthened by this success, Abu\nMuslim and his soldiers next marched into the heart of the empire. Gaining strength as\nthey moved westward, they swept inexorably through Iran and into southern Iraq.\nFinally, along the bank of a tributary of the Tigris River, Abu Muslim\u2019s warriors decisively\ndefeated the Umayyad army in 750\u2014thus bringing the dynasty to an ignominious end.80\nOnly then did Abu Muslim reveal that the movement he led had a narrower aim\nthan he had previously suggested. To the disappointment of the Alids, he made clear\nafter his victory that his goal was not to install as caliph someone from the line of Ali and\nFatimah but instead to put on the throne a member of the Abbas family, which\ndescended from Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Abbas ibn Abd al-Mutatalib (c. 565-c. 653) and\nwhich had secretly masterminded the revolt that he led. In keeping with this goal, Abu\nMuslim arranged to have one of Abbas\u2019s great grandchildren, Abu al-Abbas (r. 750-\n754), proclaimed caliph in the mosque in Kufa\u2014establishing, in the process, the\nAbbasid Dynasty that would rule the caliphate for the next five centuries.81\nAbu al-Abbas spent the next few years seeking to ensure that the Umayyads\ncould not mount a comeback. Accounts of this effort differ. One holds that he had all of\nthe remaining members of the dynasty hunted down and killed; a competing story\ninstead maintains that he invited them to his palace for a dinner party and had his\nguards murder them after they had taken their seats. Regardless of which account is\naccurate, the only member of the Umayyad family who managed to escape the dragnet\nwas Abd al-Rahman I (r. 756-788), who, after an arduous trek across North Africa,\nestablished a competing caliphate in Spain.82\nAbu al-Abbas\u2019s successor, al-Mansur (r. 754-775), completed the consolidation\nof Abbasid power. He began by moving to ensure that the dynasty faced no danger\nfrom within the movement that had put it in power. Most notably, he had the popular\u2014\nand, thus, potentially dangerous\u2014Abu Muslim executed while the latter was passing\nthrough Iraq in 755. He next dealt with the Alids. Bitter that Abu Muslim\u2019s call for a new\ncaliph from Muhammad\u2019s family had failed to bring a descendant of Ali and Fatimah to\npower, they launched revolts against the Abbasids in 762 in the Hijaz and in Iraq. Al-\nMansur\u2019s response was swift and overwhelming. Taking advantage of dissension\namong the rebels, he first crushed the uprising in the Hijaz and then, in 763, defeated\n79 Kennedy, Caliphate, 66.\n80 Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750, 115\u201318.\n81 Kennedy, Caliphate, 67\u201370.\n82 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 128.

He followed with an extended campaign of persecution against\nthe remaining members of Shi\u2019atu Ali that ended only when his successor, al-Mahdi\n(r. 775-785), took the throne.83\nThe Abbasid Golden Age\nDespite the ruthlessness with which the regime consolidated power, the Abbasid\ndynasty has long enjoyed a glowing reputation among non- Shi\u02bfi Muslims. In fact, while\nthe conventional Muslim narrative of world history is highly critical of the Umayyads, it\nlauds the early centuries of Abbasid rule as Islam\u2019s golden age\u2014an idealized time of\nprosperity, stability, and order during which the umma thrived under the dynasty\u2019s\nenlightened, Islamic government. According to this interpretation, the good times\npeaked under the reign of the fourth Abbasid caliph, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-809).\nCultured, intelligent, sophisticated, and, above all, empathetic to the needs and wants of\nhis people, al-Rashid became the quintessence of the wise and caring Islamic ruler.84\nIronically, a close examination of the dynasty reveals that its system of rule was\nfar more similar than different from that of the despised Umayyads. Like their\npredecessors, the Abbasids oversaw a highly centralized and unrepresentative\ngovernment that was fundamentally at odds with the egalitarian message of early Islam.\nThey also enjoyed lives of luxury that at a minimum equaled the widespread-if-\nexaggerated stories of Umayyad excess and pleasure-seeking. As we have seen,\nmoreover, the Abbasids could be every bit as capricious and tyrannical as their\npredecessors had been. Even that most celebrated of Abbasid caliphs, Harun al-\nRashid, resorted at times to arbitrary and brutal methods. When he felt threatened by\nhis old friend, Ja'far ibn Yahya Barmakid (767-803), for example, he had Ja\u2019far and the\nentire Barmakid family brutally murdered\u2014despite the fact that it had faithfully served\nthe Abbasids since the beginning of the dynasty.85\nSo what accounts for the Abbasid Dynasty\u2019s continued good reputation? After all,\nthe fact that the royal executioner stood at the side of the caliph during public\nceremonies hardly suggests that the dynasty embraced restrained rule or Islamic\negalitarianism. To some degree, the Abbasids\u2019 enduring good press is the product of a\nsense of political cynicism that settled onto the Muslim world in the early years of the\ndynasty. When the social and political revolution that the Abbasids had promised failed\nto arrive, most Muslims grudgingly came to accept that all secular rulers were power\nhungry and thus bound to behave just as the Umayyads had. Accordingly, the majority\nof Muslims thereafter assumed a pragmatic attitude toward the ruling elite: so long as\nthe Abbasid caliphs engaged in their worst and most excessive behavior behind closed\ndoors and so long as they continued to uphold the stability upon which the success of\nIslam depended, they would look past the dynasty\u2019s moral failings and give it their\n83 Hugh Kennedy, When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World: The Rise and Fall of Islam\u2019s\nGreatest Dynasty (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2004), 18\u201326.\n84 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 86\u201387.\n85 Kennedy, When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World, 71\u201379.

More importantly, as we shall see in chapter four, the Abbasids\u2019 willingness to\nleave key religious questions\u2014including the articulation and interpretation of Islamic\nlaw\u2014to religious scholars secured for the dynasty the support of the influential clerical\nestablishment, which was thereafter only too happy to celebrate the Abbasids and to\nbuttress their rule.86\nThe caliphate\u2019s strong economy during the first few centuries of Abbasid rule also\nstrengthened the dynasty\u2019s reputation. In this regard, the Islamic world really did enjoy a\ngolden age under Abbasid rule. The rapid growth of the Arab Empire had created a\nhuge, unified, and stable market that was conducive to internal trade. The resulting\nexpansion reached its apogee under the Abbasids. Indeed, by the early years of the\ndynasty\u2019s rule, the economy of the empire had grown so large and sophisticated that it\nhad begun to pull both nearby and distant regions of the globe into a growing, Middle\nEast-centered commercial order. With Iraq acting as its center, a massive new network\nof trade routes rapidly emerged to connect the economies of the Middle East, North\nAfrica, Sub-Saharan Africa, India, Central Asia, and even China into a cohesive trading\nbloc for the first time.87\nThe new commercial order that the Abbasids oversaw benefited both the rural\nand urban economies. In the agricultural sector, connection with distant regions brought\nvaluable new crops such as rice, bananas, sugarcane, and cotton to the Middle East for\nthe first time. Coupled with the attention that the dynasty lavished on the irrigation works\nof Egypt and Iraq and with the development of new innovations such as windmills and\nwatermills, the adoption of these new crops increased agricultural productivity and\ncontributed to the diversification of diets. Thanks to growing commercial contact with\nother cultures, meanwhile, new industries soon took root in the empire\u2019s rapidly growing\ncities. For example, sugarcane and cotton brought to the Middle East from India\nstimulated the development of sugar refining and textile manufacturing in the cities of\nIraq. The rapidly expanding paper industry likewise had external origins. A technology of\nChinese origin, paper had spread to Central Asia in the centuries prior to the arrival of\nthe Arabs in that region. The Arabs were quick to see its practical benefits. Indeed,\nwithin just a few decades, a substantial number of papermills existed in the cities of\nIraq, and paper had become cheap and plentiful throughout the caliphate.88\nFinally, the Abbasids\u2019 enduring reputation stemmed from the fact that their\napproach to governance, while similar in broad outlines to that of the Umayyads, also\nbroke with their predecessors\u2019 policies in a number of important ways. For example,\naware of simmering popular anger at Syrian dominance of the empire under the\nUmayyads, the Abbasids had begun the dynasty\u2019s reign by quickly relocating the center\nof power to Iraq. Likewise, they acted to placate the heretofore disgruntled mawali by\npermanently abolishing the remaining special rights that the Arabs had enjoyed and by\n86 Armstrong, Islam, 53\u201355, 58\u201359.\n87 Peter Frankopan, The Silk Roads: A New History of the World (New York: Knopf,\n2015), 91\u201398.\n88 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 45\u201346; Kennedy, Caliphate, 106\u20138. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 67\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nreplacing the Arab tribal forces that had constituted the core of the empire\u2019s army since\nthe time of Umar with a new, professional military dominated by the Muslims from\nKhurasan who had put the dynasty in power.89\nLess popular but still tolerable was the gradual Abbasid embrace of older Persian\npolitical ideas and practices. The dynasty quickly made the Sassanid shahs\u2019 claim that\nthey ruled by divine right their own; they took imperious new titles such as God\u2019s Deputy\non Earth and revived older Persian designations like Shadow of God on Earth. By\nHarun al-Rashid\u2019s time, the Abbasids had even adopted complex Persian ceremonies\nand court dress designed to exalt the status of the monarch and to cast him as\ndetached from the day-to-day world of his subjects. Likewise, the caliphs soon required\nall subjects\u2014even high-ranking ones\u2014to prostrate themselves and kiss the ground\nwhen they approached him. Clearly, the position of caliph had changed considerably\nfrom the days when Umar took naps in the corner of the mosque in his homespun\nclothing! One might think that the gap between the severe-but-approachable Umar and\nthe wealthy-and-aloof Harun al-Rashid would have produced resentment toward the\ncaliph. Perversely, however, the sense of distance and remove that the Abbasids\u2019\nelaborate, Persian-style rituals created may have helped to insulate the caliph from\npopular anger. Thereafter, rather than blaming the ruler for actions they did not like,\npeople held his viziers\u2014the officials who were in charge of implementing those\npolicies\u2014responsible.90\nBaghdad\nAll of these trends\u2014the embrace of the Umayyads\u2019 centralized system of\ngovernment, the expansion of the economy, the political shift to the east, and the\nadoption of Persian political practices\u2014came together in the Abbasids\u2019 new capital city:\nBaghdad. Al-Mansur established it in 762. Seeking a strategic location for his seat of\ngovernment, he ordered his chief vizier to build the city on the west bank of the Tigris\nRiver at the point where it was nearest to the Euphrates. His choice of location was\nexcellent. The city not only enjoyed ample water, but also had easy access via river and\ncanal to the abundant food of Iraq. Indeed, it was a natural spot for an important city\u2014a\nfact attested to by its proximity to both the ruins of Babylon, the capital of Hammurabi\u2019s\n(c. 1810-1750 BCE) ancient empire, and to Ctesiphon, the seat of the Sassanid Persian\nEmpire.91\nThe city itself was very different from the Roman and Sassanid ones that the\nAbbasids inherited. Laid out as a perfect circle, it was an orderly, planned city that\ncontained the caliph\u2019s palace, a mosque, and buildings for the administration of the\nempire. As such, it was well geared both to the centralized system of government that\n89 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 58\u201359.\n90 Armstrong, Islam, 54\u201355.\n91 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 134\u201335. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 68\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nthe Abbasids borrowed from the Umayyads and to the ritualized court ceremonies that\nthey adopted from the Persians.92\nBaghdad did not serve strictly administrative and ritualistic functions for very\nlong, however. Instead, its central location and access to the court quickly drew large\nnumbers of people. Likely the most populous city on Earth for much of the Middle Ages,\nits population soon topped 500,000. A disproportionate share of those residents were\nintellectuals. Enticed by the patronage that the palace provided, legal scholars,\nscientists, mathematicians, and philosophers flocked to the city. As we shall see in\nchapter four, those thinkers would make Baghdad the greatest intellectual center of the\nMiddle Ages. The city also had a huge population of merchants. Attracted by Baghdad\u2019s\ncentral location, political importance, and easy access by river, they soon turned the city\ninto a major global entrepot. Traders based in the city exchanged silk and porcelain\nfrom China; gold, enslaved people, and salt from Africa; metalworks from Syria; spices\nand textiles from India; and leather goods from Spain. Indeed, for several hundred\nyears, it was the emporium of the world\u2014standing, without challenge, as the nexus of\nthe globe\u2019s most important trading system.93\nThe Historical Debate: The Arab Conquest\nThe aforementioned account reflects the standard understanding of the Arab\nConquest and the development of the caliphate through the reign of Harun al-Rashid.\nThat is, it broadly summarizes both the conventional Muslim narrative and the dominant\ninterpretation that Western scholars articulated in the twentieth century. This view has\nnot gone uncontested, however. On the contrary, a number of historians have\nchallenged the standard account in a variety of ways over the past few decades\u2014\nparticularly its treatment of the Arab Conquest. Some of these reinterpretations accept\nthe general thrust of the traditional understanding of the Arab invasions of the Byzantine\nand Persian Empires while still making important corrections to it. Others go much\nfurther in reassessing the conquest. Building on the work of the Islamic Revisionist\nhistorians discussed in chapter two, these scholars have instead developed new\ninterpretations that upend long-held understandings of who participated in the invasions,\nwhat their motives were, and how they dealt with the newly conquered subject peoples.\nThese reinterpretations of the Arab Conquest emerged as a result of the doubts\nthat many scholars have about the reliability of the sources on which the standard\naccount is based. Put simply, historians who study the first century of the Arab Empire\nface the unfortunate reality that there exists precious little firsthand evidence of the\ninvasions. As the historian Hugh Kennedy notes, the extant primary sources on the\nconquest are fragmentary and \u201ccan be counted on the fingers of one hand.\u201d What does\nexist, instead, are narrative histories authored by Muslim scholars like al-Baladhuri and\nal-Tabari. Writing centuries after the events they described, they based their accounts\non long-lost works produced in the eighth century that were themselves derived from\n92 Kennedy, Caliphate, 72\u201373.\n93 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 56\u201358. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 69\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nearlier oral accounts passed from generation to generation. Unsurprisingly, many\nmodern historians doubt the reliability of these narratives. They question whether the\noriginal oral accounts were, in the scholar Gerald Hawting\u2019s words, \u201cmangled in\ntransmission\u201d and argue that writers like al-Tabari and al-Baladhuri were likely shaping\ntheir histories to support one side or another in the religious and political debates of the\ncenturies in which they lived.94\nSome historians have applied methods of critical analysis to these sources to\ndraw conclusions that make relatively modest changes to the traditional narrative.\nPointing to al-Baladhuri and al-Tabari\u2019s mention of Persian nobles joining forces with the\nconquerors without having to convert to Islam or pay the jizya tax, for example, Hugh\nKennedy concludes that the Arabs treated the conquered people with substantially more\nflexibility than the tripartite, \u2018convert, die, or submit\u2019 ultimatum suggests. Meanwhile,\nFred Donner\u2019s critical reading of the ninth-and-tenth century sources leads him to\nconclude that the traditional narrative\u2019s emphasis on religion as a major force in\norganizing and shaping the conquest is correct. However, he disputes the standard view\nthat the invasion of the Byzantine and Persian Empires was a narrowly Islamic initiative.\nInstead, asserting that \u201cthe Believers\u201d\u2014his term for the early umma\u2014initially practiced a\n\u201cnon-confessional\u201d monotheism that accorded equal status to Muslims, Christians, and\nJews, he argues that the Arab Conquest was, at least at first, an ecumenical venture\nand claims that Islam only began to develop as a distinct religion in the late-seventh\ncentury.95\nOther scholars are even more dubious of the traditional account and the\nevidence on which it rests. Relying on non-Arabic, seventh-century sources, for\ninstance, Robert Hoyland goes considerably further than Donner in downplaying Islam\u2019s\nrole in the Arab Conquest. While acknowledging that the religion\u2019s similarity to the other\nAbrahamic faiths gave it an important \u201cintegrative capacity\u201d that allowed it to secure the\nconquered people\u2019s acceptance of the Arabs as rulers, he argues that the Muslim\ncommunity, which he calls \u201cMuhammad\u2019s west Arabian coalition,\u201d was but one group\namong many seeking to exploit the weakness of the established states in the mid-\nseventh century. Indeed, he claims that incursions by other, often Christian Arab forces\npredated the umma\u2019s raids. However, he continues, ninth-century Muslim historians\nerased the significant role that non-Muslims played by revising the chronology of the\nconquest to give it a strictly Islamic character\u2014a change in interpretation, Hoyland\nasserts, that gradually \"airbrushed out of history\u201d the contributions of Arabs who were\nnot part of Muhammad\u2019s group. Hoyland also takes issue with the conventional\nnarrative\u2019s implicit claim that the Arabs were outsiders seeking to conquer the\nestablished order; instead, he contends that they were insiders\u2014clients or, in many\ncases, residents of the Byzantine and Persian Empires\u2014who used the sophisticated\nweapons and tactics that they had acquired while serving in the armies of those states\n94 Quote from Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 13, 16\u201318; Hawting, The First\nDynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661-750, 16\u201317.\n95 Kennedy, The Great Arab Conquests, 180, 192; Donner, Muhammad and the\nBelievers, 109. Chapter Three: The Arab Conquest and the Establishment Page 70\nof the Caliphate, 632-809\nto effect what turned out to be a wildly successful effort to win a share of political and\neconomic power from within.96\nConclusion\nRegardless of the reason for the Arab Conquest, the results were enormously\nconsequential. Indeed, the political, economic, and cultural changes that it brought\nabout were so significant to the course of global history that its emergence\nconventionally marks the dividing line between Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.\nPolitically, it established a new superpower of immense scale that ended the Persian\nEmpire and reduced the Byzantine Empire to a rump state. Economically, it produced a\nnew system of global trade centered on Baghdad that displaced long-established\ncommercial relations and that massively enriched the Middle East. Most importantly, the\nArab Conquest resulted in the emergence of a new, enduring, Islamic-based civilization.\nIt is to the evolution of the faith and to the social and cultural changes that accompanied\nits transformation that we shall next turn.\n96 Hoyland, In God\u2019s Path, 41,56-57, 227\u201330; See also Holland, In the Shadow of the\nSword. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258\nAt the same time that Arab armies were winning an empire, Muslims were also\ngrappling with a series of fundamental questions about their society and religion. How\nshould they organize their community to best please God? How were people to\ndetermine correct behavior in situations for which the Prophet\u2014having never\nexperienced them\u2014had not provided guidance? Would God judge them based on their\nfaith alone, or a combination of faith and works? What role should human reason play in\nunderstanding God\u2019s plan?\nAbove all, they struggled with the momentous question of leadership. As we have\nseen, Muhammad had died without naming a successor or articulating what authority\nthat person would possess. As a result, the leading Muslims had no clear political path\nto follow regarding the question of who would succeed Muhammad as the umma\u2019s\npolitical leader and whether that person would also inherit the Prophet\u2019s religious\nauthority. As recounted in chapter three, these issues produced intense factional\ninfighting and even civil war among the Muslim elite. The question of leadership did not\nremain confined to the ruling class, however. Instead, the debate spilled over into the\nbroader Muslim community where it would produce a religious conflict of enormous\nconsequence.\nThe Division of Islam\nHow was it that a dispute within the leadership transformed into a broader,\npopular debate about religion? It did so as a function of the peculiar structure of the\nearly community of believers. Because Islam had begun as a movement in which\nreligion and politics were tightly intertwined, any conflict over politics inevitably acquired\na religious dimension and vice versa. As a result, what had started as a narrow political\ndisagreement over the succession inevitably transformed into a much broader debate\nover religion\u2014one that would permanently divide the community of believers between\nSunnis, Shi\u02bfi, and adherents of the small, but-influential movement known as Kharijism.1\nSunnism\nSunnism has been the largest branch of Islam since the religion\u2019s gradual\nseparation into different denominations in the seventh and eighth centuries. Today,\nSunnis account for about 85 percent of the world\u2019s estimated 1.8 billion Muslims. The\nterm itself is derived from the word sunna\u2014the habits, practices, and words of\nMuhammad\u2014and reflects the view that Muslims should live in emulation of the Prophet\nand the early umma. Sunnis hold that all Muslims can follow the religion without the\nneed for intercession by a formal priesthood or religious hierarchy, and they rely on\n\u02bfulama\u02be\u2014male religious scholars more akin to rabbis than to Christian priests or\nministers\u2014to interpret the Muslim social and religious code and to resolve legal\n1 Karen Armstrong, Islam: A Short History (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 45\u201346. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 72\ndisputes. It is a belief system centered far more on behavior than theology. That is, in\nkeeping with the prevailing Muslim rejection of theological debate as zannnah, or idle\nspeculation, Sunnis focus their attention more on living according to the Straight Path\nthat they believe Muhammad had outlined than on adhering to correct doctrine.2\nThe Emergence of Sunnism\nSunnism began in the eighth century as a broad, populist movement that\nexplicitly\u2014almost cynically\u2014rejected any special religious role for the caliph. It grew out\nof popular revulsion with the fighting and elite political intrigue that took place during the\nFitnas\u2014civil conflicts that in their eyes directly contradicted the idea that the umma\nshould be unified in imitation of God\u2019s tawhid, or divine oneness. The movement\nsubsequently gained strength as a result of growing dissatisfaction with Umayyad rule.\nThe dynasty\u2019s embrace of pre-Islamic political practices, its pursuit of luxury, and its\nincorporation of Byzantine legal practices nurtured the sense that the caliphate was an\nintrinsically worldly institution that was ill suited to the articulation of the social laws and\ncustoms that would structure life under Muslim rule. For a brief period following the\ndemise of the Umayyads, Sunnis hoped that the Abbasids might govern as devoutly as\nthe first four caliphs and thus be able to provide the guidance they sought; they quickly\nabandoned that expectation, however, when the first few leaders of the new dynasty\nmade clear that they were every bit as focused on earthly concerns as the Umayyads\nhad been. By the latter half of the eighth century, as a result, the Sunnis had abandoned\nthe expectation that the caliph would establish the type of community Muhammad had\ncalled for. Instead, they would create that society themselves based on the explicit\ncommandments outlined in the Qur\u02bean and on the sunna of Muhammad.3\nSunni Political Theory\nWhat role, then, did the early Sunnis see the caliphate playing? In terms of\ndefining the obligations and responsibilities of the community, very little. Indeed, the\n\u02bfulama\u02be accorded the state almost no power in shaping the legal codes by which the\numma lived, and limited its social and religious responsibilities to collecting the zakat tax\nand punishing those who broke religious laws. Sunnism\u2019s opposition to the caliphs\nhaving a religious role is most obvious in the popularization of the term Rashidun, or\nrightly guided, to describe the first four caliphs. People used that word as a sign of\nreverence and respect for those influential leaders, of course, but they also employed it\nas a potent rhetorical device aimed at denying later rulers the power to intrude in the\nsocial and religious sphere. That is, the first four caliphs were Rashidun because they\nhad been companions of Muhammad and, as such, had the authority to establish the\n2 Michael Lipka and Conrad Hackett, \u201cWhy Muslims Are the World\u2019s Fastest-Growing\nReligious Group,\u201d Pew Research Center (blog), accessed November 19, 2019,\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/why-muslims-are-the-worlds-fastest-\ngrowing-religious-group/; Armstrong, Islam, 6, 57\u201364.\n3 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 60\u201361. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 73\ncustoms, legal practices, and obligations that were binding on the umma. Later caliphs,\nin contrast, were not Rashidun and thus enjoyed no corresponding influence over\nreligion or daily life.4\nThe caliph did have one very important religious responsibility, however: the\nmaintenance of order. To Sunnis, political stability was essential. Indeed, it was so\nparamount, that a popular Sunni proverb declared \u201c\u2018better sixty years of tyranny than a\nsingle day of civil strife.\u2019\u201d Why was order so critical to them? They stressed its\nimportance because they feared that, in its absence, people would violate the legal and\nsocial requirements that lay at the heart of Muhammad\u2019s vision of the proper community\nof believers. As the scholar Vali Nasr explains, \u201c[t]he Sunni conception of authority has\ncentered on a preoccupation with order. Religion does not depend on the quality of\npolitical authority but only on its ability to help the faith survive and grow.\u201d Accordingly,\nby the late-eighth century, Sunni \u02bfulama\u02be were glad to uphold the legitimacy of the\ncaliph so long as he remained\u2014at least outwardly\u2014a devout Muslim and, more\nimportantly, so long as he preserved the order needed for the umma to function as\nMuhammed had intended.5\nPerhaps surprisingly in light of the determination of the Sunni \u02bfulama\u02be to prevent\nthe caliph from having a meaningful voice in religious affairs, the Abbasid Dynasty\nwould\u2014after a time at least\u2014throw its support behind them. It had three reasons for\ndoing so. First, the nascent Sunni movement that the religious scholars led enjoyed\npopular backing; supporting the \u02bfulama\u02be would thus pay dividends for the Abbasids by\nhelping them to secure broad approval of the dynasty\u2019s rule. Second, Sunni emphasis\non order and stability appealed to the Abbasids because it suggested that they could\nrule autocratically without risking the emergence of a populist rebellion similar to the one\nthat had toppled the Umayyads. Finally, the Sunni \u02bfulama\u02be seemed well positioned to\nsolve a vexing problem that had emerged in the first century of Islam. During the\ncaliphate\u2019s rapid expansion, the different regions, towns, and cities of the empire had\nhaphazardly developed competing and even contradictory Islamic customs and laws\ndrawn as much from existing Roman or Persian legal codes as from the Qur\u02bean or the\npractices of Muhammad. Not only was the existence of multiple legal systems\ninconsistent with either tawhid or the religion\u2019s universal nature, but, more practically, it\nalso profoundly complicated the caliphate\u2019s effort to administer justice. As a result, the\ndynasty was only too happy to support the \u02bfulama\u02be and their efforts to devise a single\nlegal and social code, shari\u02bfa law, by which all Muslims could live.6\n4 Armstrong, Islam, 61.\n5 Vali Nasr, The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the Future (New\nYork: W. W. Norton, 2006), 36\u201339.\n6 John L. Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, Fourth Edition (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2011), 76; Armstrong, Islam, 58. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 74\nShari\u02bfa Law\nShari\u02bfa law became the beating heart of Sunni Islam as it took shape over the\ncourse of the eighth century. At its core, the code established the ethical and legal\nstandards under which Sunni Muslims were to live. It did so not merely by prohibiting\ncertain activities but by mandating and regulating others. For example, while it forbade\nsex outside of marriage and the consumption of pork or alcohol, it also required Muslims\nto pray daily and stipulated inheritance and divorce rights.7\nIts formulation proved lengthy and contentious. The problem was one of sources.\nWhen Muhammad was alive, ascertaining how believers should act or crafting\nappropriate laws to handle new situations had been simple: one merely asked the\nProphet for his opinion on the subject. After his death and the passing of his\ncompanions, however, the community needed to find a different way to determine the\ntraditions and laws by which the umma should abide. The Qur\u02bean provided the obvious\nstarting point and would go on to serve as the primary source for the shari\u02bfa code. It\nincluded some eighty explicitly legal verses that addressed issues such as marriage,\ninheritance, and female infanticide. It also established a series of moral precepts that\ncould provide the religious scholars with critical guidance for the construction of Islamic\nlaw. The \u02bfulama\u02be of the eighth century consequently set about systematically\ninterpreting the Qur\u02bean for the purpose of refining the shari\u02bfa code. In the process, they\nwon popular backing for a particular understanding of the Qur\u02bean that held that it was\nnot a living document or the product of a particular time and place\u2014the Hijaz of the\nearly seventh century\u2014but that it was instead the timeless, literal word of God and thus\nbeyond interpretation. Gradually, they also secured acceptance of the idea that the\nQur\u02bean was a divine attribute of God, and that, as such, it was eternal and uncreated;\nlike God, in other words, it had forever existed and was unchanging in form, and its\nteachings\u2014as interpreted by the religious scholars\u2014were thus beyond question.8\nAt the same time, the Qur\u02bean quickly revealed itself to be of limited utility in the\neffort to craft an Islamic legal and social code. Focused largely on establishing the\nbroad moral principles by which Muslims were to live rather than on providing explicit\nlegal rulings or guidance, it offered only minimal assistance for resolving many pressing\nquestions of behavior and law. As a result, the \u02bfulama\u02be soon found themselves stymied\nin their effort to construct a comprehensive shari\u02bfa code.9\nThe legal scholar Malik ibn Anas (711-795) was the first to suggest a way out of\nthis situation. He argued that when the Qur\u02bean did not provide explicit direction on an\nissue, the \u02bfulama\u02be should look to the practices and laws of the city in which the\nProphet\u2019s community first existed: Medina. He subsequently founded a legal school in\nthat city, the Maliki School, and published the Muwatta, in which he collected the\n7 Esposito, Islam, 106.\n8 Reza Aslan, No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, Updated\nEdition (Random House, 2011), 163\u201365.\n9 Esposito, Islam, 77\u201378. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 75\ncustoms, laws, and traditions of contemporary Medina that he believed dated to the time\nof Muhammad. Malik\u2019s approach would prove highly influential in the development of\nIslamic fiqh, or jurisprudence. At the same time, however, doubts soon emerged\nregarding his reliance on Medina for the construction of Muslim law and custom. As\ncritics asked, was it not possible that the traditions and laws of Medina included\naccretions and innovations made in the century after Muhammad\u2019s death? If so,\ncontemporary Medina could not serve as a model for Islamic behavior and law. These\nobjections proved persuasive. In the end, they convinced most \u02bfulama\u02be that the\npractices of contemporary Medina could not serve as the basis for shari\u02bfa law. Thus,\ndespite Malik\u2019s important contributions, Islamic jurisprudence appeared once again to\nbe stuck.10\nOne of Malik\u2019s students, Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafii (767-820) provided a way\nout of the impasse. The founder of the Shafii School of jurisprudence, he argued that\nshari\u02bfa law had four legitimate sources. The first two were direct ones: the Qur\u02bean and\nthe hadith\u2014the documented accounts of the sunna of Muhammad. The other two, qiyas\nor analogical reasoning, and, ijma, or the consensus of the Muslim community, were\nindirect interpretive methods derived from the Qur\u02bean and the sunna that he argued\ncould be used to determine the law in areas on which the direct sources did not provide\nclear guidance.11\nLike Malik, Al-Shafii argued that the Qur\u02bean was the revealed word of God and\nshould thus be the first source to which the religious scholars should look in the creation\nof shari\u02bfa law. When it did not directly address an issue or when its dictates needed\nclarification, however, he contended that they should seek guidance not in the customs\nof Medina but instead in the sunna of Muhammad as recorded in the hadith. He\nmaintained that since the Prophet was the archetype of the perfect Muslim, the\ndocumented stories of his life constituted\u2014in law professor David Forte\u2019s words\u2014\n\u201cindirect divine revelation\u201d that outlined the kind of society in which God wanted\nhumanity to live.12\nAl-Shafii\u2019s argument was persuasive, and soon won broad support among the\n\u02bfulama\u02be. The hadith provided answers to many questions on which the Qur\u02bean was\nsilent and proved pivotal in breathing new life into the effort to develop a comprehensive\nreligious and social code. At the same time, however, the hadith were surprisingly\nproblematic as a source for Islamic law. The primary issue was the sheer quantity of\nthem. By the time that scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj (815-875) began compiling\nhadith in the ninth century, their number had exploded into the hundreds of thousands.\nMaking matters worse, the hadith frequently contradicted one another. While religious\nscholars agreed that many were valid, they also believed that large numbers were\nforgeries fabricated by rulers or other individuals to advance their own narrow interests.\n10 Esposito, 77\u201378.\n11 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 67\u201368.\n12 Forte quote from David F Forte, \u201cIslamic Law: The Impact of Joseph Schacht,\u201d Loyola\nof Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review 1 (1978): 4. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 76\nHow, then, could the \u02bfulama\u02be use them to devise the shari\u02bfa code? That is, how could\nthey separate the legitimate hadith from the many forgeries?13\nHere, too, al-Shafii provided a path forward. He developed a rigorous approach\ncalled Hadith Scholarship by which the \u02bfulama\u02be could assess the validity of the hadith\nusing techniques similar to the methods that modern-day historians use to critically\nassess the credibility of sources. Al-Shafii\u2019s approach called on the \u02bfulama\u02be to examine\ncarefully the isnad, or chain of people who transmitted the story from the time of\nMuhammad to the ninth century. Valid hadith needed to be traced through a succession\nof people of unimpeachable moral character back to a person who knew the prophet\npersonally. If an individual in an isnad could not have met the person from whom they\npurportedly heard a hadith because they lived at different times or in different places,\nthen that hadith could not be authenticated. Likewise, if a person in the isnad was of\npoor moral reputation, then the hadith could not be trusted. This process was reputed to\nbe quite strict. One story holds that the religious scholar Ismail al-Bukhari (810-870)\nrejected a hadith because he discovered that one of the transmitters beat his horse; to\nal-Bukhari, a person who treated his mount in that way could not possibly possess the\nethical and moral character of a reliable transmitter.14\nBut what if both the Qur\u02bean and the hadith failed to clarify a legal or ethical\nquestion? Al-Shafii argued that in those cases, the \u02bfulama\u02be could seek guidance\nthrough the indirect interpretive methods of qiyas and ijma. Qiyas, or analogical\nreasoning, allowed the \u02bfulama\u02be to extend the precepts and logic of the Qur\u02bean and the\nsunna to subjects that those sources did not explicitly address. For example, religious\nscholars used qiyas to forbid the consumption of drugs such as marijuana that were\nunknown to the early community of believers and that Muhammad had consequently\nnever discussed. They argued that if alcohol was forbidden because it was an\nintoxicant, then other intoxicants\u2014including marijuana\u2014should likewise be prohibited.\nThe second indirect method that al-Shafii articulated, ijma, or consensus, was based on\nMuhammad\u2019s declaration that \u201cmy community will never agree on an error\u201d and held\nthat that any decision that a substantial majority of the religious scholars agreed to was\nbinding as Islamic law. Ironically, ijma permitted the \u2018ulama\u2019 to validate legal decisions\u2014\nsuch as one that called for adulterers and prostitutes to be stoned to death\u2014even when\nthose decisions appeared to contradict the Qur\u02bean.15\nWhile al-Shafii maintained that the only appropriate sources for shari\u02bfa law were\nthe Qur\u02bean, the hadith, ijma, and qiyas, other religious scholars argued that a third,\nindirect, interpretive method, ijtihad, or independent reasoning, could be used when\nthose sources failed to provide a clear answer. Supporters of ijtihad argued that a well-\nrespected \u02bfulama\u02be could render a judgement about an unprecedented situation based\n13 Esposito, Islam, 95\u201396.\n14 Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes (New\nYork, NY: PublicAffairs, 2009), 95\u201396; Tom Holland, In the Shadow of the Sword: The\nBirth of Islam and the Rise of the Global Arab Empire (New York: Doubleday, 2012), 35.\n15 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 166\u201367. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 77\non his understanding of Islamic law. If, over time, most other religious scholars\nsupported his reasoning via ijma, then that decision would acquire legal precedence\nand thus permanence. During the ninth and tenth centuries, ijtihad enjoyed widespread\nsupport among the \u02bfulama\u02be and constituted an important source of shari\u02bfa law. As we\nshall see, however, enthusiasm for its use would soon fade.16\nUsing al-Shafii\u2019s approach, four Sunni schools of jurisprudence developed in the\nninth century to articulate shari\u02bfa law and to erect the theological foundation on which it\nrests. Along with the aforementioned Maliki and Shafii Schools, there emerged the\nHanifa School founded by Abu Hanifa (699-767) and the Hanbali School established by\nAhmad ibn Hanbal (780-855). Each of these schools adopted approaches to the\nformulation of the shari\u02bfa code that differed in terms of the sources that they\nemphasized. The Shafii School stressed the importance of the sunna, for example,\nwhile the Maliki School drew most heavily on the customs and practices of the people of\nMedina. Regardless of their differing views on the appropriate sources, however, the\nschools developed remarkably similar codes. Indeed, they differed more in terms of\ntone than in the substance of their legal rulings. The four schools thus enjoyed equal\nstatus and authority; that is, the sum of their rulings collectively constituted the core of\nshari\u02bfa law, and all of them gained widespread support among Sunni Muslims.17\nImportantly, the \u02bfulama\u02be presented the code that they had developed as one that\nwas not subject to debate or challenge. As they argued, it was founded not on fallible,\nmortal faculties nor was it developed incrementally in response to the specific\ncircumstances of a given place or historical period. Instead, they maintained that the\nshari\u02bfa law was a direct and indirect extension of two perfect sources, the Qur\u02bean and\nthe sunna of Muhammad\u2014the Qur\u2019an because it was the timeless, literal word of God,\nand the sunna because God Himself had chosen the Prophet to serve as his final\nmessenger. Thus, the religious scholars declared, the shari\u02bfa law that they had\ndeveloped was \u201cdivine in origin\u201d and, as such, beyond the capacity of humans to\nquestion or dispute.18\nThe Historical Debate: Hadith Scholarship\nThe preceding understanding of the code\u2019s origins dominated the Muslim world\nwithout serious question for over a millennium. In recent decades, however, scholars\nhave mounted a sustained challenge to it. Central to their critique have been doubts\nabout the validity of the hadith from which the \u02bfulama\u02be had constructed the sunna.\nScholars have raised two main objections to their reliability. First, they have\npersuasively demonstrated that many of the laws ostensibly derived from the hadith in\nfact predate Islam and originated in the Talmudic, Roman, or Persian legal traditions\u2014\nmeaning that the code itself reveals that it had roots that extended well beyond the\nsunna. Second, scholars have uncovered evidence that indicates that many of the isnad\n16 Aslan, 167.\n17 Armstrong, Islam, 65; Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 167\u201368.\n18 Forte, \u201cIslamic Law: The Impact of Joseph Schacht,\u201d 4\u20138. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 78\nthat the \u02bfulama\u02be had analyzed with such apparent rigor almost certainly did not extend\nback to the time of the Prophet. For example, Robert Hoyland cites the case of a legal\nscholar of the mid-eighth century who wrote that a prominent older \u02bfulama\u02be he knew had\nnever uttered a single hadith over the course of his life while \u201c\u2018the young men round\nhere are saying [them] twenty times an hour\u2019\u201d\u2014a statement that strongly suggests that\nthe articulation of the hadith began well after the time of Muhammad.19\nThese findings offer insights into the goals that motivated the religious scholars\nto engage in the effort to link the shari\u02bfa code to the practices of the early umma\nthrough Hadith Scholarship. As the religious scholar Reza Aslan has shown, while the\nsunna on which the shari\u02bfa code is based may correctly reproduce some of the customs\nand practices of the early community of believers, any instances of accuracy on the part\nof the \u02bfulama\u02be are more a function of accident than intent. This is so, he continues,\nbecause the real purpose of Hadith Scholarship was not to separate authentic hadith\nfrom the chaff but instead, through the manufacture of hadith and isnads, to connect\nninth-century legal and religious views to the early umma and, in doing so, to give\nsanction to \u02bfulama\u02be-approved laws and customs that either pre- or post-dated Islam. In\nother words, Hadith Scholarship was a tool used to create a past consistent with the\npresent rather than the reverse. Tellingly, the hadith that appeared to enjoy the\nstrongest claims to legitimacy were the least reliable. As the twentieth-century German\nscholar Joseph Schacht succinctly put it, \u201cthe more perfect the isnad, the later the\ntradition.\u201d Regardless, the religious scholars\u2019 campaign worked. Their effort to give the\nexisting laws and customs that they endorsed the imprimatur of Islamic precedence\ngained broad acceptance, and their control of the past through Hadith Scholarship came\nto form a central plank in their contention that they held sole authority over shari\u02bfa law.20\nAslan adds that their ability to gain broad acceptance of their understanding of\nthe Qur\u02bean constituted a second critical element of that claim. As previously noted, the\n\u02bfulama\u02be had succeeded in gaining broad approval both for their interpretation of the\nQur\u02bean and for their assertion that it was the literal, uncreated, eternal word of God.\nThat is, they had managed to simultaneously advance a particular understanding of the\nQur\u02bean and to assert that it was beyond interpretation\u2014thereby establishing their view\nas the only valid one. Coupled with their monopoly over Hadith Scholarship, it ensured\nthat they commanded the main sources of Islamic law and afforded them a degree of\nauthority over the shari\u02bfa code that even the caliph had to respect.21\nAs modern-day scholars point out, their control over the sources of the shari\u02bfa\ncode would give Sunnism a conservative, backward-looking character. By limiting the\nlaw directly or indirectly to the Qur\u02bean and the life of Muhammad, the religious scholars\n19 Robert G.

Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 79\nensured that the main venue for legal and social debate would not be the present day or\nthe use of reason, but instead the interpretation of the Salaf\u2014the first three generations\nof Muslims\u2014which the \u02bfulama\u02be had successfully assumed control over through Hadith\nScholarship. In other words, in the process of creating the shari\u02bfa code, the legal\nscholars had also institutionalized the view that the Sunni community should address\nchallenges not by developing new practices or institutions, but instead by doing the\nprecise opposite: eliminating accretions and innovations\u2014bid\u02beah\u2014and returning to the\ncustoms, however ahistorical, of the Salaf. This framework would prove enormously\ninfluential. Indeed, as we shall see later, it would shape many of the ways in which\nSunnis would respond to difficult challenges such as the Mongol conquest in the\nthirteenth century and the growing power of the West in the nineteenth and twentieth\ncenturies.22\nShi\u02bfism\nNot all Muslims shared this emphasis on the first few generations of believers.\nInstead, almost from the start, a minority that would come to be known as Shi\u02bfa rejected\nthe Sunni religious scholars\u2019 focus on the Salaf in favor of a conception of Islam\ncentered on the descendants of Muhammad through the line of his daughter Fatima\n(605-632) and his son-in-law Ali ibn-Talib (r. 656-661). In doing so, they would articulate\nan interpretation of Islam\u2019s nature and a set of beliefs regarding both who should rule\nand the extent of their religious authority that sharply contrasted with the views of the\nSunni majority. Though its adherents have at times faced persecution, Shi\u02bfism has\npersevered. Indeed, according to a 2009 Pew Forum study, the world\u2019s 154 million to\n200 million Shi\u02bfa account for 10-13 percent of the global Muslim population.23\nOrigins\nShi\u02bfism originated in a political dispute that went back to Islam\u2019s earliest days. As\ndiscussed in chapter three, a crisis had emerged following Muhammad\u2019s death\nregarding who should succeed him. With the Prophet having died without first explicitly\nnaming a successor, the umma quickly divided into factions over the question of who\nshould replace him. One of those groups, the Alids\u2014also known as the Shi\u2019atu Ali, or\nParty of Ali\u2014argued that Muhammad had in fact made clear that he wanted his son-in-\nlaw, Ali, to succeed him. Other prominent Muslims balked at the idea, however.\nBelieving that Ali was too young, they instead chose Muhammad\u2019s father-in-law, Abu\nBakr (r. 632-634), as the Prophet\u2019s successor. Grudgingly Ali and his backers acceded\nto the decision. Later, and with greater reluctance, they also accepted the decision of\n22 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 98\u201399.\n23 \u201cMapping the Global Muslim Population,\u201d Pew Research Center\u2019s Religion & Public\nLife Project (blog), 2009, https://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-\nmuslim-population/. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 80\nthe leading Muslims to pass over Ali in favor of Umar (r. 634-644) in 634 and Uthman\n(r. 644-656) a decade later.24\nFinally, following Uthman\u2019s murder in 656, Ali at last became caliph. As we have\nseen, his tenure as leader of the umma was neither happy nor successful. Ali faced\nsignificant rebellions, including one led by \u02bfA\u02beisha (c. 613-678) and two of the Prophet\u2019s\nformer companions and an even more formidable one headed by the powerful governor\nof Syria, Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan (r. 661-680). He also had to deal with an uprising by\nmilitant former supporters known as Kharijites, or \u201cseceders,\u201d who had broken with him\nover his willingness to enter into arbitration with Muawiyah. Ali\u2019s short and difficult reign\nended in 661 when a Kharijite assassin murdered him in the Mosque in Kufa using a\npoisoned sword. With Ali dead, leadership of the Shi\u2019atu Ali fell to his eldest son, Hasan\nibn Ali (624-670). A deeply religious man, Hasan had been horrified by the fighting that\nhad occurred between Muslims during the First Fitnah. Eager to avoid a continuation of\nthe civil war, he proposed a settlement wherein he would accept Muawiyah as the new\ncaliph on the condition that a shura would choose his successor. With Muawiyah\nagreeing to abide by this proposal, Hasan retired to Medina where he died in 670.\nFollowing his death, his brother, Husayn ibn Ali (626-680), succeeded him as the leader\nof the Shia\u02bftu Ali.25\nUltimately, Muawiyah did not stand by the agreement he had made with Hasan.\nInstead of calling for a shura to determine who should succeed him, he arranged during\nhis final months as caliph for his son, Yazid (r. 680-683), to take power\u2014thereby\nestablishing the Umayyad Dynasty. This move was not a popular one. Many Muslims\nwere upset about it because they felt that dynastic rule was antithetical to Islam\u2019s\negalitarian message. The Shia\u02bftu Ali joined those who complained about Muawiyah\u2019s\nactions, but they objected on substantially different grounds. For them, the issue was\nnot the shift to an hereditary caliphate but instead the fact that it would run through\nBanu Umayya. That is, they were happy to have a dynastic system\u2014indeed, they were\nenthusiastic about the idea\u2014but only so long as it followed the descendants of\nMuhammad through the line of Fatima and Ali.26\nFurious at Muawiyah\u2019s betrayal, Husayn moved to challenge Yazid shortly after\nthe latter acceded to power. Launching a rebellion was a tall order for the Prophet\u2019s\ngrandson, however. Living in distant Medina, he was isolated from the main Muslim\npopulation centers and was thus in a poor position to organize an effective revolt. Iraq,\nhowever, had large numbers of Alids whose backing could possibly give him the\nnumbers needed to triumph over the Umayyads. Accordingly, after he received a\nmessage from troops in the pro-Alid garrison town of Kufa expressing their support and\ninviting him to come and take command, he and a small band of supporters departed for\nIraq in the late summer of 680. It was a risky move. Yazid would surely attempt to\nintercept him before he reached Kufa. Accordingly, Husayn instructed his Kufan\n24 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 35\u201352.\n25 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 176\u201377.\n26 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 67\u201368. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 81\nsupporters to march out to meet him when he neared Iraq. They failed to do so,\nhowever. While Husayn was traveling north, the powerful Umayyad governor of Iraq,\nUbayd Allah (?-686), brought his army to Kufa where he intimidated the Alids into\ninaction through a show of force. As a result, when Husayn finally entered Iraq near the\ntown of Karbala, he met not the Kufan supporters he expected but instead Ubayd\nAllah\u2019s large and powerful army. Unsurprisingly, the ensuing fight was entirely one\nsided. With little difficulty, Ubayd Allah\u2019s soldiers slaughtered Husayn and his seventy-\ntwo companions at the Battle of Karbala\u2014thus ending the Alid revolt before it even\nbegan.27\nBy all reasonable expectations, the battle should have been the end of the Alids;\ninstead, the battle marked the point at which the Shia\u02bftu Ali transformed from a political\nfaction into a new religious sect: Shi\u02bfism. This process started quietly. In 684, penitents\nfrom Kufa assembled in Karbala on the anniversary of the battle to mourn the death of\nHusayn and to seek atonement for their failure to help him. In doing so, they turned\nwhat had been a political and military defeat into a noble act of moral suffering and\nrighteousness. According to this new interpretation of the battle, Husayn had\nunderstood clearly that he faced certain death if he continued into Iraq; nonetheless, he\npushed on and sacrificed himself as an act of devotion to God. In this way, the early\nShi\u02bfa remade the defeat at Karbala into what the scholar Vali Nasr characterizes as the\ncentral paradigm of Shi\u02bfism: \u201cthe triumph of moral principles over brute force.\u201d28\nShi\u02bfi Rituals and Theology\nIn keeping with this idea, the nascent sect rapidly developed a set of beliefs that\ncentered on the themes of atonement, martyrdom, and sacrifice but also, for those who\nkept the faith through hard times, redemption. This emphasis on loss and penance\nreflects the Alids\u2019 bitter experiences in the first few decades of the caliphate. While the\nSunnis could point to a string of successes\u2014Muhammad\u2019s victory over Mecca, the\ndefeat of the Byzantines, the conquest of the Persian Empire, triumph over the Alids\u2014\nthe Shi\u02bfa could instead look back only to a series of defeats and setbacks. As a result,\nthey placed less emphasis than the Sunnis on right behavior and strict observance of\nIslamic law and instead stressed the creation of emotional rituals through which they\ncould simultaneously express their devotion to God and seek forgiveness for their\nfailure to aid Husayn in his hour of need. In reenactments of the Battle of Karbala\nstaged during the holiday of \u02bfAshura\u02be, for example, penitent Shi\u02bfa engage in acts of self-\nflagellation such as whipping their backs with chains in order to demonstrate their faith\nand to atone for the community\u2019s failure in 680. Similar rituals occur at the shrine of\nHusayn in Karbala during Arbaeen, the holiday that marks the end of the traditional\nforty-day period of mourning following \u02bfAshura\u02be.29\n27 Fred Donner, Muhammad and the Believers: At the Origins of Islam (Cambridge, MA:\nThe Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012), 177\u201380.\n28 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 46\u201349.\n29 Nasr, 18\u201319, 43\u201349. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 82\nThe Imamate\nThe differences between Sunnism and Shi\u02bfism went well beyond the latter\u2019s\nembrace of ritual, however. Indeed, the most obvious point of disagreement between\nthe two sects was over the question of political leadership. As we have seen, Sunnis\nargued that any outwardly devout male member of the Quraysh tribe could serve as\ncaliph so long as he maintained the peace. The Shi\u02bfa disagreed. After Karbala, they\nelaborated an increasingly complex political-religious doctrine that held that leadership\nof the Muslim community rightly belonged to the Imams. To Sunni Muslims, the term\nimam, or leader, refers to the people who direct the communal prayers in the mosques.\nTo the Shi\u02bfa, in contrast, it is a proper noun\u2014a term of great respect reserved only for\nthe line of male descendants of Muhammad through Ali and Fatima, who, they believe,\nGod had ordained to rule. Thus, to the Shi\u02bfa, Ali should have become caliph\nimmediately following Muhammad\u2019s death, and, thereafter, the succession should have\nremained confined to his descendants with Fatima.30\nCentral to Shi\u02bfism then and now is the belief that the Imams are more than just\npolitical leaders. To the Shi\u02bfa, they are instead divinely appointed figures endowed with\nthe same authority and power as Muhammad. Most notably, Shi\u02bfism holds that Ali and\nhis descendants had inherited from the Prophet his baraka\u2014his special power to see\nbeyond the Qur\u02bean\u2019s literal, surface meaning and to understand and interpret its more\nprofound, hidden, esoteric message. This belief had important ramifications for the\nShi\u02bfa. It led them to reject the Sunni view that the age of revelation had ended with the\nProphet\u2019s death and that the Qur\u02bean was to be understood literally and to instead\nembrace the idea that the Muslim community continued to receive direct, divine\nguidance\u2014and even new revelation\u2014through the Imams\u2019 interpretation of God\u2019s\nmessage. It also led the Shi\u02bfa to claim that the Imams had a special role to play in\nhelping others to achieve salvation. This position emerged in the ninth century when\nShi\u02bfi religious scholars began to argue that since ordinary believers lacked the ability to\nunderstand the hidden message of the Qur\u02bean, they were incapable of securing God\u2019s\ngrace on their own. God had not forsaken them, however. Instead, He had granted the\nShi\u02bfi saints\u2014Muhammad, Fatima, and the line of infallible Imams\u2014the power to\nintercede in order to help people attain salvation.31\nUnsurprisingly, the Shi\u02bfa did not approve of the government that ruled the\ncommunity of believers. On the contrary, they were unsparing in their opposition to the\ncaliphate. They did not characterize the first three caliphs as Rashidun, and they\noutright denied the legitimacy of both the Umayyad and Abbasid Dynasties. Save for Ali\nand Muhammad, in fact, they believed that all of the leaders of the umma had been\nusurpers. For a time, they translated this sentiment into action. During the eighth and\nninth centuries, the Shi\u02bfa organized numerous opposition movements and rebellions in\nIraq aimed at restoring the line of Imams to power. Predictably, all of those revolts failed\nin the face of the Abbasid Dynasty\u2019s enormous power. Indeed, the caliphate\u2019s response\n30 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 185\u201386.\n31 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 71; Nasr, The Shia Revival, 38\u201339. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 83\nto their subversive activities was so overwhelming that it compelled the Shi\u02bfa to\nabandon militant opposition at the end of the ninth century. Thereafter, they responded\nto the caliphate\u2019s ongoing efforts to suppress them by adopting a combination of\nquietism, meaning the acceptance of the existing order, and taqiyya, or dissimulation,\nthe practice of concealing their religious identity to avoid persecution.32\nCompeting Sects: Zaidism, Ismailism, and Twelver Shi\u02bfsm\nDespite their common veneration of the Imams and their shared experience of\nbeing regularly persecuted by the caliphate, the Shi\u02bfa split into competing variants over\nthe course of the eighth century. They did so in part because Shi\u02bfism experienced a\nregular event that provided the opportunity for its adherents to factionalize: the\nsuccession to the Imamate. The death of each Imam raised the question of which son\nor relative should follow him as leader of the Shi\u02bfi community. In most cases, a\nconsensus existed regarding who should succeed to the Imamate. Twice during the\neighth century, however, a significant minority broke with their fellow Shi\u02bfi regarding the\nsuccession. As a result, Shi\u02bfism divided into three main variants: Zaidism, also known\nas Fiver Shi\u02bfism because of its belief that the line of infallible leaders ended with the\nFifth Imam, Ismailism, or Sevener Shi\u02bfism, so named because of its view that Ismail ibn\nJafar (c. 722-c. 762) was the rightful seventh Imam, and Ithna Asharism, or Twelver\nShi\u02bfism, so called because it holds that there have been twelve Imams.\nThe Zaydis were the first group to split with the majority of Shi\u02bfa. Following the\ndeath of the fourth Imam, Ali Zayn al-Abadin (c. 659-713), most Shi\u02bfa recognized his\nson Muhammad al-Baqir (677-733) as the Fifth Imam. However, a small minority\ninstead claimed that Muhammad\u2019s brother, Zayd ash-Shahid (c. 698-740), was the\nrightful Fifth Imam, and established a separate Shi\u02bfi sect called Zaydism. Never\naccounting for more than a small fraction of the global Muslim population, Zaydis\ndiffered from other Shi\u02bfi not merely over the correct succession of infallible Imams but\nalso over how they should react to a hostile political order that had, in their eyes,\nusurped the Imams\u2019 rightful position as the head of the umma. While most Shi\u02bfa\nresponded to Shi\u02bfism\u2019s precarious position in the Sunni-dominated caliphate by\npracticing political quietism and taqiyya, the Zaydis instead followed the Kharijites in\narguing that the Qur\u02beanic commandment to \u201cenjoin what is good and forbid what is evil\u201d\nrequired them to rebel against unjust rule. In keeping with this view, the Zaydis\nspearheaded several revolts against both the Umayyad and Abbasid Dynasties in the\neighth and ninth centuries. Predictably, given the power imbalance between them and\nthe caliphal government, none of these rebellions came anywhere close to succeeding\nand only served to leave the Zaydis weak and vulnerable. The Zaydis were resilient,\nhowever, and managed to stage a comeback in the late ninth century. Taking\nadvantage of disarray in the Abbasid court, they succeeded in establishing a long-\n32 Esposito, Islam, 45\u201346. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 84\nlasting state in distant Yemen in 897. It survived in various forms until a coup overthrew\nit in 1962.33\nAnother small sect, the Ismailis, or Sevener Shi\u02bfa, also promoted a militant\nresponse to what they argued was an unjust political order. Like Zaydism, Ismailism\nemerged in the mid- to late-eighth century as a result of a dispute over the succession\nto the Imamate. In this case, the issue was who should follow the Sixth Imam, Jafar al-\nSadiq (702-765) as the leader of the Shi\u02bfi community. Jafar had already answered this\nquestion by naming his elder son, Ismail ibn Jafar, to succeed him. However, Ismail had\npredeceased his father. In response, most Shi\u02bfa acknowledged Ismail\u2019s younger\nbrother, Musa al-Kazim (745-799), as the Seventh Imam. This decision did not enjoy\nunanimous support within the Shi\u02bfi community, however. On the contrary, a minority\nvigorously disagreed and argued that Ismail had to be the rightful Seventh Imam; after\nall, Jafar was infallible, and, as such, could not have made a mistake in choosing his\nsuccessor. This reasoning was consistent with the belief that the Imams are divinely\nappointed figures endowed with unerring judgement, but it raised a difficult question:\nhow could one of the infallible Imams have made a decision that seemed to have left\nthe faithful without a leader?34\nFor most Ismailis, the answer was simple. Arguing that the Imamate continued\nthrough Ismail\u2019s lineage, they acknowledge one of his sons, Muhammad ibn Ismail\n(740-813) as the new Imam. For a small minority of Ismailis later known as Qarmatians,\nhowever, that answer to the apparent paradox inherent in Jafar al-Sadiq\u2019s decision to\nchoose a successor who predeceased him was unsatisfying. Ove time, they arrived at a\ndifferent and novel explanation. Ismail had not died, they maintained, but had instead\ngone into Occultation, or spiritual hiding, as the Hidden Imam, and would return at the\nend of days as the Mahdi, or messiah, to restore God\u2019s rule for all time.35\nAmong the Shi\u02bfa, the Ismailis proved most effective at opposing the Abbasids.\nAs we shall see in more detail in chapter five, an Ismaili group seized control of modern-\nday Tunisia in 909 and proclaimed the establishment of a dynastic rival to Abbasid rule\nknown as the Fatimid Caliphate. Far from the center of the empire, it at first posed little\nthreat to the government in Baghdad. Over time, however, the Fatimids expanded to the\npoint that they became a serious rival to the Abbasids. For much of the tenth through\ntwelfth centuries, in fact, Fatimid rulers would enjoy more power and influence in the\nMuslim world than did the Abbasid caliphs.36\nEven following the collapse of the Fatimid Caliphate in 1171, the Ismailis\ncontinued to constitute a serious challenge to Abbasid rule. The new Ismaili threat came\nin the form of the Nizari Ismailis, or, as their enemies called them, the Assassins, who\n33 Esposito, 46.\n34 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 188\u201389.\n35 Esposito, Islam, 48\u201351.\n36 Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000 (New\nYork: Penguin Books, 2009), 336\u201338. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 85\nhad broken away from the Fatimid Caliphate in the late-eleventh century over another\ndisputed succession. Establishing a chain of nearly impregnable fortresses in modern-\nday Iran, Iraq, and Syria\u2014including the famous Alamut Castle\u2014they waged highly\neffective, low-intensity, terror campaigns against the Abbasids, Seljuq Turks, and\nEuropean Crusaders during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. These operations were\nso successful, in fact, that the Nizaris managed to maintain an independent, non-\ncontiguous state that, though surrounded by enemies, thrived for nearly two centuries.\nIndeed, only with the coming of the mighty Mongols to the Middle East in the 1250s\nwere the powerful Assassins finally brought to heel.37\nThe Ismailis later evolved into a very different sect. Having long since abandoned\nviolence, Ismailism\u2019s 15 million adherents now live peacefully under the leadership of\nthe 49th Imam, the wealthy and influential Karim Aga Khan (r. 1957- ). As they have for\ncenturies, most reside in Iran, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. However,\nmany Ismaili merchants took advantage of their membership in the British Empire to\npursue opportunities in other colonies. As a result, Ismaili communities exist today in\nAfrica, the Middle East, North America, Asia, and Europe.38\nAs noted earlier, adherents of the largest variant of Shi\u02bfism, Ithna Ishari, or\nTwelver Shi\u02bfism, did not acknowledge Ismail as the seventh Imam. Instead, they\naccepted his brother Musa as Jafar\u2019s rightful successor to the imamate. However, they,\ntoo, eventually ran into a theological conundrum. In their case, the problem stemmed\nfrom the disappearance of the twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi (870-?). His\ndisappearance before he could designate an heir compelled them to confront the same\nessential dilemma that the Ismaili\u2019s had faced at the time of Jafar\u2019s death: how could\nthey reconcile their belief that the Imams were infallible with the apparent end of the\nImamate? The answer came through the appropriation and elaboration of the\nQarmatian concept of Occultation. Twelver \u02bfulama\u02be started claiming that Muhammad al-\nMahdi was not dead but was instead in Occultation as the Hidden Imam. Eventually,\nthey continued, the Mahdi, meaning \u201cthe expected one,\u201d would reappear as the Messiah\nand bring a period of peace and justice to the earth until Jesus returned and the world\nended. In the meantime, the Shi\u02bfa \u02bfulama\u02be would direct the spiritual and legal life of the\nTwelver community as the representatives of the Hidden Imam. Today, the vast majority\nof Shi\u02bfa, about 85 percent, are Twelvers. They constitute a minority of Arabs living\nalong the Gulf Coast, a substantial plurality of the Arabs of Iraq, and an overwhelming\nmajority of Iranians.39\nSimilarities and Differences Between Shi\u02bfism and Sunnism\nIn a number of ways, the beliefs of Shi\u02bfi sects such as the Twelvers stand in\nsharp contrast to the tenets of Sunnism. Four differences are particularly stark. First,\nSunnism vigorously maintains that no intermediaries\u2014human or divine\u2014stand between\n37 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 129\u201332, 155.\n38 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 75\u201377.\n39 Nasr, 67\u201368. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 86\nMuslims and God. Shi\u02bfa, in sharp contrast, hold that believers can be redeemed only\nthrough the intercession of the Shi\u02bfa saints. Second, while Sunnism has no religious\nestablishment and argues that all adherents are equally capable of understanding the\nbeliefs of Islam, Shi\u02bfism, especially its Twelver variant, instead has a formal priesthood\nthat establishes and upholds religious doctrine and that claims to represent the Hidden\nImam until his return. Third, Shi\u02bfa adhere to their own version of the shari\u02bfa law, the\nJafari School, established in the mid-seventh century by the Sixth Imam, Jafar al-Sadiq.\nMoreover, in contrast to the Sunni legal tradition\u2019s rejection of independent reasoning in\nthe thirteenth century\u2014a topic we shall cover presently\u2014Shi\u02bfa \u02bfulama\u02be continue to view\nijtihad as a legitimate tool for rendering legal decisions. Finally, and most importantly,\nthe early Sunnis and Shi\u02bfa split dramatically over the question of who should rule and\nwhat powers they should wield. As we have seen, Sunnis asserted that the empire\nshould be headed by a fundamentally secular caliph whose primary responsibility was\nthe maintenance of order; Shi\u02bfa, in contrast, claimed that the infallible Imams who\ndescended from Muhammad through the line of Fatima and Ali were the rightful leaders\nof the umma and that they exercised both political and religious authority.40\nIt is easy to overstate the differences between Sunnism and Shi\u02bfism, however. In\nmany ways, in fact, their contrasts are largely surface ones that mask the degree to\nwhich their social customs and religious beliefs are fundamentally similar. For example,\nthe Shi\u02bfi legal tradition\u2019s origins in the distinct, Jafar School and its continued embrace\nof ijtihad suggest at first blush that it diverges dramatically from the Sunni tradition; in\nreality, those differences were more ones of process than of function, and the Shi\u02bfi and\nSunni versions of shari\u02bfa law ended up looking remarkably similar. Likewise, Sunnis\nand Shi\u02bfa frequently hold similar beliefs, typically practice the same social customs, and\nlargely adhere to common rituals such as the Five Pillars of Islam, albeit in slightly\ndifferent forms. Indeed, much of the all-too-real contemporary strife between members\nof the two sects is not the product of genuine religious differences but is instead a\nfunction of what Sigmund Freud called the Narcissism of Small Differences: the\nphenomenon wherein similar groups magnify minor dissimilarities to accentuate their\ndistinct identities.\nThe Kharijites\nThe final significant movement to take shape during the seventh century,\nKharijism, did not constitute a distinct sect in the way the Shi\u02bfa and Sunni did.\nOutwardly, the Kharijites appeared to be conventional Sunnis who adhered to the same\nbeliefs and followed the same customs and shari\u02bfa law as did the majority of Muslims.\nIn certain critical ways, however, they differed dramatically from both Shi\u02bfa and Sunnis.\nMost notably, their unforgiving interpretation of how Muslims should live and their\nequally strict perspective regarding who should serve as caliph constituted a\nconstruction of Islam that not only differed sharply from the views of other Muslims but,\n40 Nasr, 34\u201340, 68\u201370. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 87\nimportantly, also established a template for puritanical opposition that remains influential\nthrough the present day.\nThe Kharijites emerged in the 650s as proponents of a rigid, extremist, and\nstrongly egalitarian understanding of Islam. They held that every Muslim was equal\nbefore God and that each one was obligated to scrupulously obey every injunction and\nprohibition outlined in the Qur\u02bean and the sunna of Muhammad at all times. They also\ninterpreted the Qur\u02beanic commandment to \u201cenjoin what is good and forbid what is evil\u201d\nto mean that sinning was not merely a moral failure but also an act of apostasy (Qur\u02bean,\n3:110). By extension, they believed fervently that the community was strictly obliged to\ndeal with sinners through takfir or excommunication: the formal declaration that a\nperson was an unbeliever and thus no longer a Muslim. A declaration of takfir was a\nserious charge to the Kharijites. Indeed, in their eyes, one subject to takfir faced the\npenalty of death unless they could demonstrate that they had genuinely repented.41\nStressing Islam\u2019s egalitarian roots, they made no exceptions for the powerful. In\ncontrast to both the Sunni position that any male member of the Quraysh tribe could\nrule so long as he maintained order and to the Shi\u02bfi belief that only the infallible Imams\ncould legitimately head the umma, the Kharijites argued that leadership of the\ncommunity should fall to the most pious Muslim regardless of lineage. Those who ruled\nhad to remain scrupulously devout if they wished to remain in power, moreover, for the\nKharijites maintained not only that the caliph was subject to the same laws and\npunishments as any other Muslim but that the community was required to depose or\neven kill him if he sinned. They remained unwavering in their commitment to this\nposition. Indeed, as we saw in chapter three, they assassinated Ali in response to his\nwillingness to enter into arbitration with Muawiyah\u2014an action that they viewed as the\nusurpation of God\u2019s will and thus an act of apostasy punishable by death.42\nDespite their success in deposing Ali, the Kharijites proved almost completely\nincapable of imposing their conception of Islam on their coreligionists. Their extremist\nviews remained highly unpopular, and they never managed to win more than a tiny\nfraction of Muslims to their cause. As a result, Kharijism remained a marginal movement\nconfined largely to isolated communities in North Africa and the fringes of Arabia.\nNonetheless, it has had an influence in the Muslim world wildly out of scale with its\nmodest numbers. As we shall see, Kharijite ideas would shape later puritanical\nmovements like the Wahhabi of eighteenth-century Arabia, the views of twentieth-\ncentury jihadi thinkers such as Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), and the actions of\ncontemporary terrorist groups like al-Qaeda.43\n41 John L. Esposito, Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress, 2002), 41\u201342.\n42 Hugh Kennedy, Caliphate: The History of an Idea (New York: Basic Books, 2016),\n28\u201329.\n43 Esposito, Unholy War, 42\u201343, 48. 50. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 88\nSufism\nWhile the early Kharijites, Shi\u02bfa, and Sunnis argued about Islam\u2019s outward\nattributes, other Muslims, the Sufis, instead explored the religion\u2019s inner, spiritual\nelement. Named for the simple, unrefined woolen clothing called tasawwuf that they\nfavored, the Sufis eschewed politics and even Islam\u2019s traditional emphasis on the\ncommunity in favor of an emotional and mystical focus on the individual\u2019s relationship\nwith the divine. In the process, they developed a powerful and popular new conception\nof Islam that proved peculiarly capable of attracting converts.44\nSufism emerged in reaction to two powerful trends in the Muslim world of the\neighth century: surging materialism and the development of the shari\u02bfa code. To many\nbelievers, it seemed that worldly affairs had come increasingly to dominate the umma.\nIndeed, the latter decades of the Umayyad Dynasty had coincided with a growing\nemphasis in the Arab Empire on material concerns such as wealth and power\u2014a shift\nthat the ruling dynasty\u2019s increasing use of extravagant court rituals and embrace of\nluxury exemplified. Pious Muslims recoiled at the growth of materialism. Many\nresponded by embracing the movement to codify the outward manifestation of Islam\nthrough the development of shari\u02bfa law. Not all spiritually minded Muslims supported\nthat effort, however. On the contrary, a minority\u2014the early Sufis\u2014found the religious\nscholars\u2019 emphasis on external behavior and legalism every bit as objectionable as the\nUmayyads\u2019 embrace of wealth and opulence. In their view, the shari\u02bfa code was\nstiflingly rigid and formalistic, and its narrow focus on correct behavior left no room for a\npersonal relationship with God.45\nEarly Sufi masters responded by developing tariqa or \u201cthe Way\u201d: the different\nmethods through which people could connect directly to the divine. They started with\nthe premise that rationalism and legalism were of no use in helping believers attain\npersonal contact with God; after all, how could one experience the divine through the\nstudy of law or knowledge of philosophy? Instead, they believed that the embrace of the\ndivine was a fundamentally intimate act that could only be achieved through intense\nemotional expression and through scrupulous adherence to proper techniques. It was\nnot a task for the uninitiated. On the contrary, navigating the tariqa was a challenging\nventure that required the guidance of a Sufi saint who had already attained union with\nGod. Known as shaykhs or, in Persian, pirs, saints guided those seeking communion\nwith God on an emotional, inner, spiritual journey that involved passing through a series\nof stages designed to strip away their sense of self. Eventually, with perseverance and\ndiscipline, those seeking God\u2019s embrace would achieve fana: the annihilation of the ego\nand, with it, direct union with the divine.46\n44 Armstrong, Islam, 74.\n45 Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Volume 2: The Expansion of Islam in\nthe Middle Periods (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1974), 202\u20134; Aslan, No\nGod but God (Updated Edition), 204\u20135.\n46 Esposito, Islam, 128\u201332. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 89\nFrom the start, Sufism was divided into a multiplicity of schools each of which\nfollowed a distinct tariqa created by a different master. These orders shared a number\nof commonalities. All held that fana required the intercession of a Sufi master who had\nalready attained union with God and all revered the saints as intercessors between the\nindividual and the divine. All Sufi schools also began with the belief that material\ntemptations prevented people from maintaining the discipline needed to attain union\nwith God; they consequently pursued asceticism, or the rejection of worldly comforts\nand pleasures, as the essential first step toward fana. Simple clothing, the embrace of\npoverty, and the practice of celibacy were the rule for the Sufis. All Sufis likewise\npracticed dhikr, the remembrance of God through ritual physical action. Here, however,\nthe various Sufi orders followed very different tariqa. Most engaged in some form of\nvocal dhikr, which involved rhythmically and repetitively chanting God\u2019s name while\nsimultaneously undertaking careful breathing exercises designed to break down the\nindividual\u2019s sense of self. Others instead relied on music or, in the case of the famous\nWhirling Dervishes, on a rapid, spinning dance through which they sought to strip away\ntheir egos and to induce, in the scholar John Esposito\u2019s words, \u201cecstatic states in which\nthe devotee could experience the presence of God or union with God.\u201d47\nWhile the numerous Sufi orders were heterogeneous, they had, by the ninth\ncentury, divided into two broad approaches. Championed by al-Junayd (834-910), so-\ncalled sober or conservative Sufism embraced customary Sufi approaches such as\nasceticism and dhikr, but also adhered to traditional Muslim beliefs and practices such\nas observance of the shari\u02bfa law. Drunken Sufism, in contrast, rejected orthodox Islamic\ntraditions as impediments to the attainment of fana. Indeed, they viewed Islam as little\nmore than the starting point on their journey to the annihilation of the ego and readily\nincorporated popular local customs and religious beliefs into their canon. Some even\nwent so far as to argue that the world\u2019s great religions were merely different\nmanifestations of a common search for unity with the divine.48\nUnsurprisingly, neither the caliphal government nor the \u02bfulama\u02be approved of\nthese views. Indeed, from their perspective, drunken Sufism was a serious menace. Its\nrejection of the laws not only imperiled the social order, but also threatened the religious\nscholars\u2019 authority and prestige. Accordingly, the \u02bfulama\u02be and the caliphs joined\ntogether at different times to persecute drunken Sufis for apostasy. In the early tenth\ncentury, for example, the Sufi mystic Mansur al-Hallaj (c. 858-922) ran afoul of the\nreligious scholars by claiming that the devout could complete the hajj without actually\ntraveling to Mecca and by elevating Jesus\u2019s stature to such a degree that some\naccused him of being a Christian. The religious scholars publicly condemned him for\nthese declarations but did not take action against him. However, when he declared in\nthe markets of Baghdad that \u201c\u2018I am God!\u2019\u201d\u2014by which he meant that he had attained\nunion with the divine\u2014he crossed the line. At the behest of the \u02bfulama\u02be, caliph al-\n47 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 221\u201322; Quote from Esposito, Islam, 130\u2013\n32.\n48 Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2002), 92\u201393. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 90\nMuqtadir (r. 908-932) responded by first imprisoning al-Hallaj and then, after he refused\nto disavow his statements, by declaring him guilty of heresy and ordering his execution.\nTo make an example of him, the caliph had him tortured, crucified, beheaded,\ndismembered, and, finally, cremated.49\nDespite al-Hallaj\u2019s grisly fate, Sufism steadily gained new adherents among\nthose who found the legal scholars\u2019 emphasis on formalism off-putting. Indeed, the\nmovement not only continued to grow, but, thanks to its embrace of syncretism\u2014\nmeaning its willingness to adopt religious practices from other faiths\u2014it also came to\nplay a vital role in Islam\u2019s expansion. It was particularly important in winning converts in\nIndia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Africa. People in those regions saw Sufism as\na way to continue to practice the religion into which they were born while simultaneously\nadopting elements of Islam that they found attractive. Later, they, or more typically, their\ndescendants, gradually converted to orthodox Sunnism. Sufism thus constituted a\nreligious way station for many people who were otherwise unlikely to embrace orthodox\nIslam.50\nIslamic Society\nMeanwhile, even as Sunnis, Shi\u02bfa, and Kharijites debated questions of politics\nand Sufi saints and initiates sought communion with God, a new, urban-centered,\nIslamic society took form in the Middle East. Though it emerged out of the movement\nthat Muhammad had led in the early-seventh century, it was not patterned along the\negalitarian lines that the Prophet had championed. Instead, like many other Medieval\nsocieties, this new civilization was organized along starkly hierarchical lines of class,\nreligion, and gender.\nThe Elite\nWhile the primary social and political fault line lay\u2014at least initially\u2014between the\nArab Muslims and the people they had conquered, even the ruling elite was highly\nstratified. At the very pinnacle of the social hierarchy stood the Abbasid caliph and his\ncourt. This tiny elite was unmatched in terms of political power, social status, cultural\ngravity, and economic pull. Just under them were the religious scholars. Through their\ncontrol of the shari\u02bfa law, they constituted a decentralized, alternate elite that\nsometimes rivaled and sometimes collaborated with the caliph\u2019s government. Below\nthem, were the rich merchants of the major commercial cities and a class of politically\ninfluential large landowners to whom the court had, in exchange for service, given the\nestates of the Byzantine nobles who had fled during the conquest. Rounding out the\nelite were those Arabs who received military pensions from the diwan either because\nthey had fought in the conquest or, as was more frequently the case as the years\npassed, because one of their ancestors had. Having one\u2019s name on the register was\n49 Quoted in Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 209.\n50 Esposito, Islam, 72. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 91\nhighly prized. Not only did it entitle one to receive an annual pension, but it also carried\nwith it a great deal of prestige.51\nUltimately, however, this last group\u2019s membership in the elite proved to be\ntransitory. For a combination of reasons both fiscal and political, the Abbasids gradually\nstruck different categories from the diwan register. Over the years, as a consequence,\nthousands lost their pensions, their prestige, and their status as members of the elite.\nStill, like all Muslims, they continued to enjoy a relatively privileged social position in the\ncaliphate and, of obvious practical benefit, exemption from certain taxes.52\nDhimmi\nThe dhimmis\u2014the non-Muslims who constituted the overwhelming majority of\npeople outside the elite through the end of the tenth century\u2014possessed no such\nperquisites. To the contrary, they held a more ambiguous position in the Arab Empire.\nOn the one hand, as we have seen, they possessed certain rights\u2014particularly the\nfreedom to practice their faith\u2014that religious minorities in other Medieval societies\ntypically did not enjoy. Educated Christians and Jewish people also had the opportunity\nto serve in the bureaucracy. On the other, the dhimmis were obligated to pay the jizya\ntax and had to endure a number of restrictions designed to make clear that they were\nsecond-class members of the Arab Empire. State and religious authorities barred them\nfrom riding horses, denied them the right to give testimony against Muslims in court,\nprohibited them from organizing Easter parades, compelled them to show deference to\nMuslims, enforced a series of sartorial laws that required them to wear clothing that\nmarked their confessional identity, and, of course, imposed the jizya tax on them.53\nConversion to Islam increased over time thanks in part to these restrictions.\nInitially, as we have seen, the Arabs had discouraged conversion in hopes that Muslims\ncould remain a separate, ruling caste; as a result, during the first few centuries after the\nArab Conquest, only a relatively small number of elite dhimmis who perceived practical\nbenefits in converting chose to adopt the religion of the conquerors. Even after Umar II\n(r. 717-720) threw open the door to conversion, the vast majority of the population in the\nMiddle East remained Christian or Zoroastrian. Around 900, however, a second, larger\nwave of conversion started. Thanks to the collapse of non-Islamic social structures in\nIraq and to growing Muslim hostility to Christianity\u2014particularly after the start of the\nCrusades\u2014the rate of conversion increased dramatically. Within a few centuries, as a\nresult, Islam had become the dominant religion in the Middle East, achieving majority\nstatus in Iraq by 1200 and in Syria and Egypt by 1400.54\n51 Kennedy, Caliphate, 82\u201383.\n52 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 45; Kennedy, Caliphate, 82\u201383.\n53 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 47.\n54 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 200\u2013201. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 92\nEnslaved People\nAs was the case elsewhere in the world, enslaved people occupied the lowest\nrung in the social hierarchy. Slaves were commonplace in the Arab Middle East\u2014just as\nthey had been in the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires. Like slave owners in those\nstates, the Arabs at first used gangs of enslaved people to work large, cash-crop\nestates. However, a massive and difficult-to-subdue revolt in southern Iraq by East\nAfrican slaves known as the Zanj spurred a change in that practice in the ninth century.\nConcluding from the rebellion that maintaining large concentrations of enslaved people\nwas too risky, the Arabs thereafter relied on peasants for agricultural labor and shifted\nenslaved people to domestic service and manual labor in the cities. Despite this\nchange, slavery itself remained a vast enterprise in the empire.55\nFrequent manumission and Islamic prohibitions on enslaving Muslims meant that\nthe caliphate could not meet the demand for slaves domestically. As a result, an\nexpansive, long-distance trade in enslaved people from Europe, Central Asia, and\nAfrica took shape over the course of the seventh and eighth centuries. Increasingly,\nthose purchased from Central Asia were not destined for domestic service or manual\nlabor in the cities. Instead, as we shall see in chapter five, the caliphate began\npurchasing a steadily growing share of them for the purpose of serving as slave soldiers\nor, as they were later known, Mamluks.56\nWomen\nLike slaves, Muslim women also found themselves in a subordinate legal and\nsocial position during much of this period. That they were in such a situation marked a\nsignificant change from their circumstances during the early years of the umma and was\ncontrary to Muhammad\u2019s wishes. As we saw in chapter two, the Prophet had secured a\nsubstantial degree of legal emancipation for women. Most notably, he granted them\ncontrol over their dowries and accorded them inheritance and divorce rights. Their\nimproved legal and social standing did not merely endure while he was alive, moreover,\nbut persisted through the early decades of the Rashidun Era. For a time, as a result,\nMuslim women enjoyed a degree of autonomy and legal standing that had little parallel\nin other parts of the globe.57\nThose gains proved to be short lived, however. Over the ensuing decades, men\ngradually reasserted traditional patriarchal values and rolled back Muhammad\u2019s\nreforms. The \u02bfulama\u02be led the way. While they had felt compelled to include in shari\u02bfa\nlaw some of the improvements he had instituted for women, they also reinterpreted\nQur\u2019anic decrees to water those reforms down and to restore the social-and-legal\ndominance that men had previously enjoyed over women. Likewise, they steadily\n55 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 36, 116\u201317.\n56 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 103\u20134; Hourani, A History of the Arab\nPeoples, 116\u201317.\n57 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 25\u201326. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 93\nincorporated into the shari\u02bfa code pre-Islamic customary laws that made divorce easier\nfor men and more difficult for women\u2014despite the fact that those changes clearly\nviolated both Qur\u02beanic injunctions and Muhammad\u2019s wishes. In similar fashion, the right\nthat women had won to determine whom they married was soon ignored, and fathers\nreturned to the pre-Islamic custom of arranging their daughters\u2019 marriages. Finally, the\n\u02bfulama\u02be also reinterpreted the Qur\u02bean to accord Islamic sanction to longstanding\nByzantine and Persian customs such as veiling and female seclusion in the harem, the\nprivate part of the home into which only close male relatives could enter. Often rigidly\nenforced to ensure female honor\u2014meaning sexual faithfulness\u2014the practice of\nseclusion in the Muslim world differed on the basis of class status. The results were\nironic. Often compelled by economic necessity to work outside the home, lower-class\nwomen were far-less likely to be confined to the harem than were their upper-class\ncounterparts.58\nIt is important to keep in mind that that the position of women varied dramatically\nand that not all were powerless. For example, a number of queen mothers parlayed\ntheir influence over their sons who served as caliph into significant political authority.\nMost notably, al-Khayzuran bint Atta (?-789) dominated politics during the reigns of her\nhusband and sons and served as de facto co-caliph during her son al-Hadi\u2019s (r. 785-\n786) tenure and during the first three years of the caliphate of her younger son, Harun\nal-Rashid (r. 786-809). These cases, of course, were very much the exception rather\nthan the rule. During the century-and-a-half that followed Muhammad\u2019s death, most\nwomen instead endured the gradual reassertion of patriarchal values and the\nconcomitant reduction of the rights and liberties that the Prophet had granted them until,\nby the late-eighth century, they had lost nearly all of the legal and social gains that they\nhad made during Islam\u2019s first few decades.59\nScience\nBeginning in the ninth century, the Arab Empire experienced an efflorescence of\nscientific achievement that stood in stark contrast to the intellectual poverty of\ncontemporary Europe. It began when a multicultural school of loosely affiliated Muslim,\nChristian, and Jewish scholars called faylasuf\u2014derived from the Ancient Greek word\nphilosophia\u2014launched a concerted effort to translate ancient works of science, math,\nphilosophy, and geography into Arabic. They quickly moved beyond mere translation,\nhowever. Building on the works of classical antiquity, those thinkers soon began to\ncontribute vast new knowledge and to make enormous and lasting breakthroughs in a\nwide variety of fields. Indeed, between the tenth and twelfth centuries, the Muslim\nworld\u2019s scientists, geographers, doctors, mathematicians, and linguists would not\n58 Esposito, Islam, 119\u201324.\n59 Hugh Kennedy, When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World: The Rise and Fall of Islam\u2019s\nGreatest Dynasty (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2004), 181\u201399; See also Fatima\nMernissi, The Forgotten Queens of Islam (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,\n2003). Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 94\nmerely surpass the achievements of the ancients but also lay the groundwork for the\nintellectual breakthroughs of the Early Modern Period.\nSyriac-speaking Christians began the process of translating the Classical\nheritage into Arabic in the ninth century. Led by the greatest of the translators, the\nNestorian Christian Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809-873), these scholars developed highly\nrefined methods of producing Arabic versions of existing Greek, and, in some cases,\nPersian works. They copied the writings of mathematicians such as Pythagoras (c. 570-\n495 BCE) and Euclid (c. 325-265 BCE), the books of doctors such as Galen (129-c. 210\nCE), Hippocrates (c. 460-370 BCE), and Shushustra (c. 800-c. 700 BCE), the charts of\nastronomers like Ptolemy (c. 100-170 CE), the thinking of philosophers such as Aristotle\n(384-322 BCE) and Plato (c. 427-347 BCE), and the theories of philologists such as\nJohn Philiponus (c. 490-570 CE). In the process, the translators developed new idioms\nand vocabulary that rendered Arabic suitable for the discussion of the concepts and\nmethods of the different scientific disciplines.60\nFrom nearly the beginning of this effort, moreover, they did not confine\nthemselves to merely creating Arabic copies of existing works or repeating the ideas of\nthe ancients. Instead, as their approach and knowledge became more sophisticated,\nthey increasingly found errors and flawed reasoning in the sources that they translated.\nIn response, they started to gloss their works, meaning that they began to make\nmarginal comments that corrected and expanded on the manuscripts they translated.61\nThe Beyt al-Hikma\nPerceiving the practical benefits of the translation movement\u2014particularly in the\nrealms of geographic and medical knowledge\u2014the Abbasid Dynasty threw its support\nbehind the scholars beginning in the early-ninth century. Its backing was critical. The\ndynasty not only lavished substantial financial patronage on the movement but also\nensured its continuation by protecting it from its numerous religious critics. Of perhaps\ngreatest importance, under Caliph al-Mamun (r. 813-833), the Abbasid government\nconstructed the Beyt al-Hikma, or House of Wisdom, for the growing community of\nfaylasuf. Over the next two centuries, this combination of library and school would be\nthe most important center of learning in the world\u2014a place where scholars could\ntranslate ancient works, undertake research, conduct experiments, and synthesize\nknowledge. Thinkers working there not only benefited from the ability to interact with\nother leading scientists, but, thanks to the steady acquisition of new manuscripts from\nIndia, Persia, and the Byzantine Empire, also drew on what was, for several centuries,\nthe most expansive collection of books on earth.62\nBy that point, faylasuf affiliated with the House of Wisdom had begun to move\nbeyond the Classical Greek thinkers who had originally inspired them. Building on the\n60 Esposito, Islam, 56\u201357.\n61 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 75\u201377.\n62 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 78. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 95\npractice of glossing, Arab scientists, doctors, geographers, and astronomers had begun\nproducing original works of enormous creativity and lasting influence. Ibn al-Hataym\n(c. 969-1040) did pioneering work in optics, for example, while Abu Zayd al-Balhki (850-\n934) established a school of cartography and developed new methods that produced\nvastly more-accurate maps. Known as Avicenna in the West, Ibn Sina (c. 980-1037)\nwrote the Canon of Medicine\u2014a work so pathbreaking that it remained the standard\nmedical text in Europe and the Middle East until the nineteenth century. Muslim\nintellectuals also developed astronomical tables using an observatory that the Caliph\nMamun had ordered built in 828.63\nScholars affiliated with the House of Wisdom had perhaps their greatest\ninfluence in the field of mathematics. Arab and Persian mathematicians such as Umar\nKhayyam (1048-1131), al-Karaji (953-1029), al-Haytham (965-1040), and others\nproduced major advances in areas including linear and quadratic equations, geometry,\nand the use of fractional place notation. None was more significant than al-Khwarazmi\n(c. 800-847). The leading mathematician of his day, he made major contributions to the\nstudy of trigonometry and to the development of algorithms and was instrumental in the\nadoption of Indian numerals\u2014later passed on to the West where they are known today\nas Arabic numerals. Most importantly, he thoroughly revolutionized the study of algebra.\nA thinker of the first rank, his contributions to the development of mathematics were\npivotal and played an outsized part in laying the groundwork for the achievements of\nlater Western mathematicians such as Isaac Newton (1642-1726). Indeed, his impact\non Western thinking was so enormous that the word algorithm comes from the Latinized\nversion of his name, Algoritmi, while the term algebra derives from the title of his most\ninfluential book, Hisob al-Jabr wal\u2019 Mugabalah.64\nWhile many of the faylasufs connected to the House of Wisdom were non-\nMuslims, the knowledge that they created and the larger project to which they\ncontributed fit comfortably within the structure of the emerging Islamic society. The\nclose relationship between the House of Wisdom and Islam is most evident in the fields\nof mathematics and astronomy. Astronomic research frequently centered on practical\nquestions related to religion such as the maintenance of religious calendars or the\nestablishment of the correct time for daily prayer. Math likewise often served religious\npurposes. For example, mathematicians affiliated with the Beyt al-Hikma such as Abu\nal-Wafa (940-998) learned to use all six trigonometric functions in part so that Muslims\ncould accurately determine the qibla\u2014the direction of the Ka\u02bfba and thus the point on\nthe horizon to which they should pray\u2014from any point on earth.65\n63 Ahmad Dallal, Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 2010), 38\u201339; Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 202\u20133; E.\nEdson and E.

Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 96\nThe knowledge that the faylasuf created spread quickly to thinkers in other parts\nof the Arab Empire and even to those living in nearby states. That it did so owed in no\nsmall part to the growing availability of paper, a technology of Chinese origin that had\nspread to Central Asia in the centuries prior to the arrival of the Arabs in that region.\nSignificantly cheaper to produce than the parchment that it replaced, paper soon\ncreated an explosion in the quantity of titles produced in the caliphate and a\nconcomitant growth in the number of bookstores in Arab cities. More pertinently, it\npermitted thinkers working at the Beyt al-Hikma to inexpensively share their ideas with\nscientists and other intellectuals throughout the caliphate, including those who lived in\nother important centers of learning such as Cairo, Bukhara, and Damascus.66\nThe Historical Debate: the Beyt al-Hikma\nBased on primary-source descriptions of the Beyt al-Hikma and on the\nachievements of scholars affiliated with it such as al-Khwarazmi, historians have long\nviewed the House of Wisdom as the central institution in the development of Muslim\nscience and mathematics. Written evidence suggests that it played an outsized role\nboth in funneling caliphal support to the scholars who worked there and, through its\nlibrary, in providing them with access to both ancient and contemporary thinking.\nHowever, there are historians today who do not merely question the centrality of the\nBeyt al-Hikma to the development of Arab science and mathematics but, more\nfundamentally, also raise doubts whether the institution actually existed. The most\nprominent such critic is the scholar of Islamic Studies Dimitri Gutas. Pointing out that\n\u201cwe have exceedingly little historical information about the\u201d House of Wisdom, he\nargues that descriptions of it as a center of learning similar to a modern university are\n\u201cfanciful and sometimes wishful projections.\u201d He maintains instead that the Beyt al-\nHikma was at most a royal archival library established to translate and store Sassanid\ngovernment documents and that, as such, it played no role in the translation of Greek\nworks or in the development of Arab thought. In support of this argument, he notes that\nBeyt al-Hikma is merely the Arabic translation of the Sassanian term for library.67\nGutas\u2019s critique has raised real doubts about whether the House of Wisdom even\nexisted. Still, in the broadest sense, the significance of his assessment is more limited\nthan it may appear at first glance. Whether a physical, caliphally supported institution of\nlearning existed or not, he agrees with other scholars that Baghdad was not merely the\nintellectual heart of the Arab Empire during the Abbasid era, but, more importantly,\nconstituted for several centuries the globe\u2019s leading center of learning and research.68\n66 Kennedy, Caliphate, 106\u20138; S.

Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 97\nAl-Andalus\nBaghdad\u2019s only intellectual peers at that time were the multicultural cities of\nCordoba, Seville, and Toledo in Muslim-controlled Spain, or al-Andalus. Indeed, during\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries, those cities were home to a disproportionate share of\nthe world\u2019s leading thinkers. Hailing from Toledo, for example, the Muslim scholar al\nZarqali (1029-1087) revolutionized the field of astronomy. Originally trained as a\nmetalsmith, he developed an improved astrolabe that greatly aided navigation, and he\nshowed that the planets followed elliptical rather than perfectly circular paths when they\ntraveled through the night sky. Even more influential was the Muslim polymath Ibn\nRushd (1126-1198), or, as he was known in Western Europe, Averroes. Born in\nCordoba, he made pathbreaking contributions in fields including physics, philosophy,\nmath, jurisprudence, and medicine. His contemporary, the Jewish intellectual and\nbureaucrat Maimonides (c. 1136-1204) was a similarly towering figure. Also born in\nCordoba, he developed groundbreaking new ideas in a wide variety of fields including\nmedicine, philosophy, logic, and astronomy.69\nWhile the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish intellectuals of Spain constituted an\nintegral part of the broader scholarly community of the Islamic world, they also played a\nvital role in reintroducing to Western Europe critical works of classical antiquity that had\nbeen lost to the people of that region since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the\nfifth century. This process of intercultural exchange originated in the twelfth century\nwhen a multicultural group of scholars in Toledo began translating works like Ptolemy\u2019s\nAlmagest, Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, and Euclid\u2019s Elements of Geometry from\nArabic to Latin. Importantly, they did not merely provide verbatim copies of those works.\nOn the contrary, their translations also included the annotations and commentaries of\nmajor Arab thinkers updating, correcting, and challenging those manuscripts. Over time,\nmoreover, they moved beyond the lost works of classical antiquity and began translating\nmany books written by Medieval Arab and Persian scholars including, most notably, al-\nKhwarazmi\u2019s Algebra, al-Kindi\u2019s (801-873) On Optics, and Ibn Sina\u2019s Canon of\nMedicine.70\nThese translated works struck Western Europe like a bombshell. Their powerful\nchallenge to the prevailing Christian understanding of natural science produced a\nfirestorm of controversy that sharply divided scholars in Europe\u2019s fledgling universities.\nBy far the most divisive works were those produced by the Greek philosopher, Aristotle.\nPut simply, he posed a serious dilemma for European scholars at that time. On the one\nhand, his thinking appeared to challenge the prevailing Christian idea that the physical\nuniverse operated as a function of God\u2019s will; on the other, no educated person could\nignore the brilliance of what Aristotle had written or the practical benefits that his method\nof study promised to bring. As a result, scholars at Europe\u2019s fledgling universities\n69 Dallal, Islam, Science, and the Challenge of History, 65, 88\u201389.\n70 Richard E.

Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 98\nquickly divided between radicals who wished to use Aristotelian methods in their studies\nand conservatives who hoped to banish what they believed to be subversive and highly\ndangerous ideas. Intense as it was, the fight did not last long. Western European\nthinkers would resolve the seeming contradiction between Aristotle and received\ntheological views by reframing his ideas in Christian terms through Scholasticism.\nSafely domesticated, his works\u2014and the other books translated into Latin in Spain\u2014\nwould thereafter help to spark the Renaissance of the Twelfth Century and, more\nbroadly, set the stage for the Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies.71\nIslamic Philosophy\nThe Problem of Aristotle\nAristotle had created a not-dissimilar controversy in the Middle East a few\ncenturies earlier; there, however, the debate had a decidedly different outcome. One of\nthe greatest thinkers of ancient Greece, Aristotle had articulated a comprehensive and\npersuasive system for investigating and explaining the physical world. According to him,\nthe universe had begun when a distant, creator deity had first constructed it and set it in\nmotion. Thereafter, it operated according to a series of internal laws that determined the\nbehavior of all matter, all life, and all people. This understanding had far-reaching\nimplications. If, as Aristotle believed, a set of rules governed the operation of the\nuniverse, then people could\u2014through careful study, experimentation, and\nclassification\u2014understand how it functioned. In other words, properly structured and\ngrounded in logic, human reason could be relied upon to fathom the workings of all\ncreation.72\nThe faylasufs found Aristotle\u2019s way of understanding the world electrifying.\nAlmost from the start, they had made fruitful use of his thinking in their study of science,\nmath, politics, society, and culture. In fact, his ideas were so powerful that, over time,\nthe faylasufs\u2019 even applied them to more explicitly religious topics. Here, however,\ndifferences between Aristotle and contemporary Islam would make the going far-more\ndifficult. Those differences were indeed substantial. For instance, Aristotle\u2019s central\nscientific idea that a set of laws governed the operations of the universe seemed to\nleave no room for God to perform miracles or to otherwise affect the workings of\ncreation as both Muhammad and the Qur\u02bean maintained He did on a regular basis.\nEarly faylasufs consequently took great care in applying Aristotelianism to the study of\nreligion. For example, al-Kindi contended that scholars and theologians could make\nprofitable use of it to explore religious questions that the Qur\u02bean and the sunna did not\nexplicitly address, but he also maintained that the Qur\u02bean was the literal word of God,\nand that, as such, it lay beyond the realm of rational inquiry.73\n71 Rubenstein, 5\u201311, 79.\n72 Rubenstein, 77\u201382.\n73 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 79. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 99\nMu\u02bftazilism\nWhile the \u02bfulama\u02be viewed even this fairly conservative position with suspicion,\nthey found the ideas of another group of thinkers, the Mu\u02bftazilites, to be significantly\nmore alarming. Influenced by Aristotelian philosophy, the Mu\u02bftazilite School first\nemerged as a challenge to the traditionalist religious scholars in the eighth century.\nRooted in Greek rationalism, it rejected outright the orthodox assertion that religious\nstudy began and ended with the sunna of Muhammad and the revealed text of the\nQur\u02bean. Instead, arguing that God was rational and that humans could understand Him\nusing the methods pioneered by classical Greek philosophy, the Mu\u02bftazilites maintained\nthat reason\u2014and not revelation\u2014was the correct basis for theological inquiry.74\nStarting from such dramatically different positions, the rationalist Mu\u02bftazilites and\nthe orthodox \u02bfulama\u02be advanced sharply different understandings of Islam. Indeed, they\ndisagreed about nearly everything. They differed about issues such as the origins of the\nuniverse, the nature of physical reality, and even human psychology. Above all, they\nclashed over three pivotal questions: whether humans enjoyed free will, whether the\nQur\u02bean was eternal or created, and whether its references to God\u2019s attributes\u2014its\ndescriptions of him that appear to render him in anthropomorphic terms\u2014must be taken\nliterally.75\nBased on their embrace of moral absolutes, the religious scholars maintained an\nuncompromising position on these issues. They argued that revelation fundamentally\ntrumped reason, that the Qur\u02bean was uncreated and had existed for all time, and that,\nas the literal word of God, it could not be subject to interpretation\u2014though, more\naccurately, as we have seen, what they were really contending was that their\nunderstanding of the Qur\u02bean could not be challenged. By extension, they also asserted\nthat while the Qur\u02bean was emphatic in maintaining that God was in no way\nanthropomorphic or even graspable in human terms, its description of His attributes\u2014\nreferences to His hands, speech, face, and so forth\u2014nonetheless had to be understood\nin literal terms. Finally, taking at face value both the Qur\u02bean\u2019s declaration that God is\nomnipotent and its apparent embrace of determinism\u2014\u201cGod sends astray whom He\nwills and guides whom He wills\u201d\u2014they concluded that humans did not have free will and\nthat God instead predestined their actions (Quran, 35:8).76\nOn the basis of their understanding of Greek rationalism and their Islamic faith,\nthe Mu\u02bftazilites found these positions to be intellectually and theologically untenable\nand offered a stinging, point-by-point rebuttal. First, emphasizing tawhid, or the unity of\nGod, they criticized the religious scholars\u2019 position that the Qur\u02bean was uncreated and\neternal. In their eyes, this argument was shirk, or idolatrous, because it separated the\nQur\u02bean from God and thus treated it as a second deity. Accordingly, they countered not\nonly that the Qur\u02bean had been created but that it was best understood in metaphorical\n74 Esposito, Islam, 87\u201389.\n75 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 63\u201364.\n76 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 156\u201360. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 100\nrather than literal terms. Second, the Mu\u02bftazilites rejected the religious scholars\u2019\nargument that references to God\u2019s attributes had to be understood literally. Maintaining\nthat God was not anthropomorphic and could not be interpreted in such terms, they\nargued that references to His speech or face in the Qur\u02bean were meant to be\nunderstood allegorically rather than literally. Finally, the Mu\u02bftazilites disputed the\nreligious scholars\u2019 view that God predestined all human actions. To the Mu\u02bftazilites, that\ninterpretation was inconsistent with Islam\u2019s emphasis on divine judgement. How could a\njust God judge people if they are not responsible for their actions? More troublingly for\nthe Mu\u02bftazilites, such thinking appeared to make God not merely the basis for all that is\ngood but also the source of evil. Accordingly, noting that the Qur\u02bean explicitly held that\npeople have free will, they argued that God had given people the power to embrace or\nreject salvation through their actions.77\nFor the \u02bfulama\u02be, the emergence of Mu\u02bftazilism in the eighth century constituted a\nmortal peril. The rationalists\u2019 contention that reason was a better guide to religion than\neither a literal reading of the Qur\u02bean or knowledge of the sunna threatened to render\nirrelevant the twin bases of their power: their success in rendering their interpretation as\nthe only legitimate understanding of the Qur\u02bean and their assumption of control over the\nsunna through Hadith Scholarship. In response, they launched an aggressive campaign\nagainst the Mu\u02bftazilites in the late-eighth century. Initially, their effort was enormously\nsuccessful. Using their control of the courts and mosques and their dominant position in\neducation, they waged a relentless and effective drive against rationalist ideas. Its\nimpact was substantial and immediate. Indeed, having never commanded much in the\nway of popular support, the Mu\u02bftazilites withered in the face of this sustained assault.78\nThe situation reversed dramatically with the accession of al-Mamun to the\ncaliphate. From the start, the new caliph embraced Mu\u02bftazilism. He lavished support on\nthe movement, accorded it official status, and, most importantly, made adherence to its\ndoctrines a requirement for teachers and religious scholars. Why did he choose to throw\nhis support behind the rationalists? After all, Mu\u02bftazilism enjoyed negligible public\nsupport and thus seemed to provide him with little advantage. Al-Mamun did so in part\nbecause he found its rationalist arguments about free will and the uncreated nature of\nthe Qur\u02bean to be persuasive; that is, he genuinely believed that the Mu\u02bftazilites were\ncorrect. He had another, more practical reason to support the movement, however. He\nbelieved that he could use Mu\u02bftazilism to assert caliphal authority over the increasingly\nautonomous \u02bfulama\u02be and to challenge their control of shari\u02bea law.79\nMuted at first, al-Mamun\u2019s effort to rein in the \u02bfulama\u02be accelerated dramatically in\n833. Seeking to bring the religious scholars to heel, he initiated a campaign of\npersecution that year called the mihna designed to enforce acceptance of the rationalist\nposition on the Qur\u02bean. During the mihna, \u02bfulama\u02be were summoned to the court and\ncompelled to declare whether they believed that the Qur\u02bean was created. Those who\n77 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 62\u201364.\n78 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 105.\n79 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 143\u201345. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 101\naffirmed the Mu\u02bftazilite position that it was a divine creation were free to go; those who\ninstead clung to the view that it was eternal and uncreated were arrested and subjected\nto torture. Faced with the prospect of spending time in the caliph\u2019s dungeons, many\n\u02bfulama\u02be declared that they had undergone a change of heart and publicly attested that\nthe Qur\u02bean was created. A small number stood fast in their beliefs, however. Most\nprominent among them was the founder of the Hanbali School of jurisprudence, the\ninfluential religious scholar ibn Hanbal. Though he endured years of isolation and brutal\ntorture in prison, he refused to crack and remained steadfast in his belief that the\nQur\u02bean was uncreated.80\nUltimately, the mihna proved unsuccessful either in bringing the \u02bfulama\u02be to heel\nor in institutionalizing Mu\u02bftazilism. Ironically, it was Ibn Hanbal\u2019s imprisonment that\nmarked the turning point in the campaign. Rather than compelling him to change his\nviews, his time in jail transformed him into a popular hero and helped to galvanize mass\nsupport for the traditionalist position. Ibn Hanbal\u2019s growing appeal was not lost on the\ncourt. Indeed, within a few years, fear of civil unrest impelled al-Mamun\u2019s successor, al-\nMutasim (r. 833-842), to free ibn Hanbal. The enormous size and enthusiasm of the\ncrowd that greeted him upon his release was a wake-up call for the Abassids that\nsuggested strongly that the persecution of the traditionalists had become a political\nliability. That was certainly the conclusion that Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847-861) drew.\nSeeking to bolster the Abbasids\u2019 sagging public approval, he moved to realign the\ndynasty\u2019s religious position early in his reign by ending the mihna. He went much further\na few years later. Abandoning the effort to control the religious scholars, he formally\nwithdrew support for the Mu\u02bftazilites and publicly endorsed the orthodox \u02bfulama\u02be\nposition that the Qur\u02bean is uncreated.81\nThis turnabout was a huge victory for the traditionalists. Not only did the\nMu\u02bftazilite threat rapidly dissipate after al-Mutawakkil ended state support for it, but,\nmore importantly, the religious scholars\u2019 success in resisting the minha had\ninstitutionalized their political autonomy. Indeed, the episode marked the last time that\nthe dynasty would mount a meaningful effort to control the \u02bfulama\u02be.82\nThe Faylasuf Challenge\nThe traditionalists may have beaten back the immediate threat of Mu\u02bftazilism, but\nthey soon confronted another, more enduring challenge in the form of the increasingly\nbold faylasufs. While early faylasufs like al-Kindi had been circumspect and careful in\ntheir application of Aristotelian rationalism to religious inquiry, later ones were willing to\nemploy such thinking much more aggressively in their examination of Islam. For\nexample, al-Farabi (872-951) explicitly argued that philosophy offered a superior path to\nsalvation than did religion. Known as the \u201c\u2018second teacher\u2019\u201d of philosophy\u2014Aristotle\n80 Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome, 329\u201330.\n81 Hugh Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, Second Edition (New\nYork: Routledge, 2004), 162\u201363, 167\u201368.\n82 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 106. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 102\nbeing the first\u2014he maintained that God had endowed people with reason so that they\nwould have the ability to cleanse themselves of sin and thus ready themselves for union\nwith the divine. Only a small minority had the education and intellect to understand God\nin this way, however. For all others, the Qur\u02bean and the teachings of Islam provided a\nsimplified, symbolic means of accessing the truth.83\nThe brilliant ibn Sina built on and extended al-Farabi\u2019s ideas. Fitting Islam into\nGreek philosophy rather than the reverse, he contended that the prophets were people\nwhose superior minds gave them the insight needed to fully understand God and His\nplan. They, in turn, created simplified, accessible rituals for the masses\u2014not because\nthose practices were derived from the literal word of God but instead because they\npresented, in the historian Ira Lapidus\u2019s words, \u201can imaginative presentation of truths\u201d\nthat the uneducated common people could grasp.84\nFrom the late-ninth through the late-eleventh centuries, the faylasuf and, to a\nlesser extent, the reinvigorated Mu\u02bftazilites, posed a serious challenge to the orthodox\n\u02bfulama\u02be. Their command of Greek-derived rationalism, their rejection of received-but-\nlogically untenable religious views such as the idea that the world was created ex\nnihilo\u2014from nothing\u2014and their ability to offer a persuasive, natural-science based\nmodel of the physical operation of the universe lent them great credibility. As a result,\nthey attracted the support of a small but growing number of educated and influential\nurban Muslims.85\nThe rising appeal of the faylasufs troubled many \u02bfulama\u02be. One of them, the\nreligious scholar Abu al-Ashari, (c. 873-935), responded by developing a new approach\nknown as the Asharite School. Designed to establish a compromise position between\nthe rationalists and the traditionalists\u2014and, thus, to coopt the arguments of the\nfaylasufs and Mu\u02bftazilites\u2014this new approach articulated a limited acceptance of\nhuman reason. Rationalism, al-Ashari and his supporters argued, was a valid tool that\ncould be used to better understand Islam. At the same time, however, they also\nmaintained that it had only limited applicability to questions of religion. Most notably,\nwhile it could be used to support and defend understandings of revealed truths, it could\nnot supplant, contradict, or challenge the path to salvation outlined in the Qur\u02bean and\nthe sunna.86\nAsharism quickly gained a large following and soon became the dominant\ntheological school within Sunni Islam. However, it failed to make inroads among the\nfaylasuf and Mu\u02bftazilites. Instead, finding Asharism to be entirely unpersuasive, they\ncriticized it and challenged its proponents in a series of public arguments during the\nlate-tenth and early-eleventh centuries. These debates ended up being embarrassingly\none sided. Using their command of Greek logic and rational inquiry, the faylasufs and\n83 Quote from Esposito, Islam, 57; Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 78.\n84 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 178.\n85 Armstrong, Islam, 63\u201364.\nEsposito, Islam, 90\u201391.86 Armstrong, Islam, 63\u201364. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 103\nMu\u02bftazilites regularly ran rings around their flustered Asharite opponents. Their success\nagainst the traditionalists attracted little mass support, but, to the consternation of the\nAsharites, it did make significant inroads among the influential, educated urbans\nclasses.87\nAl-Ghazali\nThat the rationalists failed to solidify that support owed largely to the efforts of\none adherent of the Asharite School: al-Ghazali (c. 1058-1111). Deeply troubled by the\ngrowing influence of the faylasufs and Mu\u02bftazilites, he moved in the late-eleventh\ncentury to rebut their views. Doing so promised to be a difficult task. As the Asharites\nhad so painfully discovered, the faylasufs were highly skilled at using Greek logic and\nrationalism to undermine their opponents. Al-Ghazali was unfazed, however. Shrewdly\nconcluding that he could best refute the faylasufs\u2019 arguments by employing against\nthem the very rationalism on which their philosophical and theological views rested, he\nfirst produced a summation of Classical philosophy called The Aims of the\nPhilosophers. It was a powerful distillation of Greek rationalism. Indeed, as the writer\nTamim Ansary notes, The Aims of the Philosophers was so clear and balanced that\nmany contemporary Europeans who read translated copies of it assumed that the\nauthor was a supporter rather than a critic of Aristotelian inquiry.88\nHaving mastered falsafa, al-Ghazali set out to destroy it in his next book, The\nIncoherence of the Philosophers. In it, he first identified the ideas that collectively\nconstituted the foundation of the faylasufs\u2019 reason-based views. Using the logic and\nmethods of the rationalists against them, he then offered a devastating critique of those\npremises.89\nThe core argument in the Incoherence of the Philosophers was his attack on\ncausality. At heart, Aristotelian natural science and philosophy were rooted in the belief\nthat the world operated according to a series of immutable laws. That idea, in turn,\nrested on the concept of causality, a concept that maintains that a given effect is the\nconsequence of a particular cause, and that a certain cause will, all other things being\nequal, always produce the same effect. For example, since flame is always present\nwhen cotton burns, fire\u2014the cause\u2014will result in cotton bursting into flame\u2014the\neffect\u2014any time the two come into contact.90\nAl-Ghazali completely rejected cause and effect. Instead, using Greek\nrationalism, he articulated a refined version of a competing idea called Occasionalism.\nIn direct contrast to causality, Occasionalism holds that natural laws do not govern the\nphysical universe; instead, the world exists as a series of discrete moments bound\n87 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 110.\n88 Ansary, 111.\n89 Esposito, Islam, 91.\n90 Rubenstein, Aristotle\u2019s Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered\nAncient Wisdom and Illuminated the Dark Ages, 85; Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 111\u201312. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 104\ntogether only by God\u2019s will. Cotton burns when it comes into contact with fire not\nbecause of causality, but instead because God, for reasons that mere humans cannot\nfathom, wills that it would burn. Occasionalism thus maintains that the fire had nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the cotton burning, and its proximity to the cotton at the point that\nit burst into flame was merely a matter of correlation rather than one of causation. To\nargue otherwise, al-Ghazali concluded, was to deprive God of agency and to render\nHim as something less than the all-powerful figure described in the Qur\u02bean.91\nAl-Ghazali\u2019s takedown of Aristotelian rationalism was persuasive, effective, and\nenormously far-reaching. Using the concept of Occasionalism with devastating\neffectiveness, he undermined the idea that the universe operated according to a set of\nimmutable laws; by extension, he also discredited the foundation on which all rational,\nAristotelian theology rested. As a result, educated Muslims not only began to dismiss\ncausality as an illusion, but, more importantly, increasingly rejected the entire basis of\nthe faylasufs\u2019 rationalist theology.92\nAl-Ghazali\u2019s critique also offered a successful rejoinder to the Mu\u02bftazilite\nargument that people enjoyed free will. In direct contrast to the rationalist position,\nOccasionalism held that since God was all powerful, He determined all actions\u2014\nincluding those that appeared to be the product of human agency; free will thus did not\nexist. Importantly, however, al-Ghazali rejected the idea that people were mere moral\nbystanders who were not accountable for what they did. As the religious scholar John\nEsposito writes, he instead adhered to the Asharite position that individuals became\nresponsible for their choices through \u201ca theory of \u2018acquisition,\u2019 which maintained that\npeople acquire responsibility and thus accountability for their actions.\u201d Though God\npredestined all actions, in other words, individuals nonetheless assumed responsibility\nfor them.93\nIbn Rushd\nThe Incoherence of the Philosophers did not go unchallenged. Most notably, the\nSpanish-Muslim faylasuf Ibn Rushd offered a powerful, point-by-point response in his\ntwelfth-century rebuttal, The Incoherence of the Incoherence. Building on the work of\nearlier scholars such as Avicenna and al-Farabi, he argued in it that as \u201c\u2018truth does not\noppose truth but accords with it,\u2019\u201d the revealed knowledge of the Qur\u02bean and the\nreasoned findings of philosophical inquiry cannot be in opposition. Any apparent conflict\nbetween them does not reflect genuine contradiction, he continued, but instead\nindicates that the prevailing understanding of the Qur\u02bean is inaccurate and should be\nchanged. Like the Mu\u02bftazilites, ibn Rushd thus believed that educated people needed to\ncomprehend the Qur\u02bean in allegoric rather than literal terms. Not everyone had the\nintellect to understand it metaphorically, however. Accordingly, he maintained that while\n91 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 111\u201312.\n92 Esposito, Islam, 89\u201392.\n93 Esposito, 89\u201392. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 105\nthe khassa, the educated elite, should interpret the Qur\u02bean using philosophy, the amm,\nor masses, should instead continue to approach it on a simpler, literal level.94\nIbn Rushd\u2019s riposte was brilliant, sharply reasoned, and convincing. It came,\nhowever, at an extremely inauspicious moment for arguments of such subtlety and\nsophistication. As we shall see in chapter five, by ibn Rushd\u2019s time, the Arab Empire\nwas no longer the power it had once been. Instead, fractured into warring principalities,\nit confronted a significant external challenge beginning in the late eleventh century in\nthe form of Western European crusaders, and an existential one in the thirteenth\ncentury in the shape of the awesomely powerful Mongols. Simply put, it was a time of\ncatastrophe\u2014one that left the umma unreceptive to the sophisticated positions that ibn\nRushd had developed. As a result, however brilliantly argued it may have been, The\nIncoherence of the Incoherence proved unable either to gain purchase or to arrest\nphilosophy\u2019s declining influence in the umma.95\nThe Closing of the Gates of Ijtihad\nThe climate worsened considerably for the faylasufs and their allies in the\ndecades following ibn Rushd\u2019s death. To a degree, this change was the product of a\nlongstanding effort by traditionalist religious scholars to limit the use of reason in the\nanalysis of questions related to theology and shari\u02bfa law. Beginning in late-tenth\ncentury, they had responded to the caliphate\u2019s growing problems by calling for taqlid, or\nthe uncritical acceptance of received views. As part of that effort, some had started to\nargue that since the shari\u02bfa code had been perfected, the use of ijtihad, or independent\nreasoning, was no longer a necessary or even appropriate tool for the articulation of\nreligious law or the study of Islam. Known as the \u201c\u2018closing of the gates of ijtihad,\u2019\u201d this\nturn away from independent reasoning made comparatively limited headway at first.\nHowever, it began to gain wide acceptance in the Muslim world after the Mongols\nsacked Baghdad and ended the Abbasid Dynasty in 1258. Indeed, that event marked a\ncritical watershed for independent thinking in the Muslim world. As the historian Toby\nHuff asserts, from that point forward, \"[b]oth theology and law specifically rejected the\nidea of a rational agency attributable to all men in favor of the view that man should\nfollow the path of traditional authority . . . and not attempt to fathom the mysteries of\nexternal nature or sacred writ.\"96\nThe consequences of the closing of the gates of ijtihad were as enormous as\nthey were adverse. While the Muslim Middle East had led the world in the study of\nscience and philosophy during the Abbasid Dynasty, it would make comparatively\nnegligible intellectual contributions thereafter. Instead, it would be the umma\u2019s former\npupils in Christian Europe who, using, the Islamic scientific and philosophic texts they\n94 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 174\u201375.\n95 Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Volume 2, 318\u201323.\n96 First quote from Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 167; Huff quote from Toby\nE. Huff, The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 1993), 113. Chapter Four: Religious, Social, and Intellectual Changes, 632-1258 Page 106\nhad acquired from the Muslims, would vault ahead intellectually and materially\u2014in the\nprocess setting the stage for the enormously consequential scientific and technological\nbreakthroughs of the modern era.\nIbn Taymiyyah\nStill, though support for the use of ijtihad declined precipitously after 1258, a\nminority continued to insist that it remained a valid and necessary tool of jurisprudence.\nThe most prominent such person was the religious scholar ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328).\nForced to flee his home while a child to escape the Mongols, he had come to conclude\nthat the umma\u2019s failure to live as God had intended had led directly to the catastrophes\nthat had befallen the Muslim world. Accordingly, like many others at that time, he\nargued that the community of believers needed to purify itself by returning to the\npractices and customs of the Salaf. In this regard, ibn Taymiyyah agreed with the\ntraditionalists that innovations in religion and social practices ran counter to God\u2019s will.\nIn other ways, however, he was anything but backward looking. Most notably, while\nnearly all of his fellow \u02bfulama\u02be maintained that the shari\u02bfa was timeless and perfect, he\nargued instead that Islamic law needed to be continuously modified through\nindependent reasoning so that it could better accord with the times. In other words, he\nbelieved that the shari\u02bfa code should not adhere dogmatically to laws that had been\ndrafted in a bygone era but should instead reflect the spirit of God\u2019s vision for the umma\nin the context of present-day circumstances.97\nAt the same time, however, he strongly opposed innovations in the practice of\nIslam that he believed violated the religion\u2019s basic tenets. Here, ibn Taymiyyah\nadvanced an argument that while framed in conservative terms was in fact a highly\ninnovative one. He contended that certain Muslims\u2014the Shi\u02bfa, those Mongols who had\nconverted but still followed their traditional laws, and members of syncretic religious\ngroups such as the Alawites and Druze\u2014had strayed so far from the vision of Islam laid\nout in the Qur\u02bean and the hadith that they had become kafirs, or apostates. What should\nthe community of believers do with such Muslims? Contending that the umma needed\nto purify itself in order to please God, he asserted that Muslims not only should but were\nindeed obligated to takfir\u2014or excommunicate\u2014and kill apostates. Thus, for the first\ntime, a mainstream religious scholar had joined the Kharijites in articulating a legal\njustification for using violence against people conventionally understood to be\nMuslims.98\nThis idea would have only limited appeal during ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s lifetime. Indeed,\nhis views were so frequently at odds with those of his fellow religious scholars and the\ncivil authorities that they resulted in him spending substantial periods of time in jail.\nBeginning in the eighteenth century, however, many of his ideas would win a new\n97 Esposito, Islam, 100\u2013102; Armstrong, Islam, 104\u20135.\n98 Fawaz A.

Most notably, the stern Wahhabi\n\u02bfulama\u02be of central Arabia would revisit ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s conception of takfir to justify\nattacking Muslims deemed to have committed apostasy through their actions or beliefs.\nIn more recent times, his thinking would also inform the ideology of Islamist organization\nlike al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).99\nConclusion\nBy the end of the thirteenth century, Muslims had answered the questions that\nthey had confronted in the decades after the Prophet\u2019s death. They had come up with\ncriteria for determining who could serve as Muhammad\u2019s successor and had outlined\nthe extent of their powers. They had also established how Muslims were to live and how\nthey were to practice the religion. They had even identified how human reason was to\nbe used in exploring God\u2019s plan. What they had not done, however, was come to a\nconsensus in addressing those questions; instead, they had arrived at a multiplicity of\nconflicting answers. In the process, they had divided along a variety of fault lines:\nbetween behaviorally minded Sunnis and devotional Shi\u02bfa, between Sufi mystics and\nlegal traditionalists, and between \u02bfulama\u02be literalists and intellectual faylasufs. At times,\nthose divisions undoubtedly weakened the caliphate. On balance, however, their impact\nwas overwhelmingly positive. Indeed, the divisions that emerged among Muslims during\nthis pivotal era would play an enormous part in ensuring that the umma developed into\na rich, complex, and heterogeneous civilization\u2014one that continued to thrive even as\nthe caliphate was crumbling around it. It is to the gradual weakening and eventual\ncollapse of the empire that we shall next turn.\n99 Esposito, Unholy War, 45\u201346. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300\nThe transformation of Islam and the intellectual trends that we examined in\nchapter four occurred against an increasingly anarchic political backdrop. While the\nArab Empire had enjoyed an almost-unbroken string of success since its founding in the\nearly-seventh century, it abruptly entered a more challenging period immediately\nfollowing the reign of Harun al-Rashid (r. 786-909). For the next century and a half, the\ncaliphate experienced a sequence of debilitating civil wars, factionalism, and instability.\nAs a result, the Abbasid Dynasty gradually saw its authority shrink until, in 945, it fell\nunder the dominance of an Iranian dynasty, the Buyids (934-1055).\nWorse followed. From the end of the eleventh century to the late-thirteenth\ncentury, a succession of Turkish nomadic groups, crusading Western knights, and, most\ndangerous of all, powerful Mongol warriors launched a series of sustained attacks on\nthe Arab Empire. These invasions had enormous consequences for the Middle East.\nThey produced a fundamental political reordering in the region, resulted in a legacy of\nmisunderstanding over the nature and intent of the Crusades and, in the case of the\nMongols, seemed for a time to constitute an existential challenge to Islamic rule.\nThe Withering of Abbasid Power\nCivil War\nIronically, the decline of the Abbasid Dynasty began during the reign of the caliph\nwidely viewed as the Arab Empire\u2019s greatest leader, Harun al-Rashid. Indeed, the idea\nthat the caliphate was on the cusp of difficult times would have struck contemporaries\nas entirely implausible. After all, at the time of al-Rashid\u2019s death in 809, the empire was\nin an enviable position in nearly every regard. It had a strong, centralized system of\nadministration, broad legitimacy throughout the Muslim world, and, perhaps most\nimportantly, a powerful army centered on the Abna, the descendants of the Khurasani\nArabs who had supported the Abbasid revolt against the Umayyad Dynasty. Harun al-\nRashid had also left it with a treasury of enviable proportions owing to a steady stream\nof tax revenues from both the provinces and, most importantly, the Sawad: the\nfabulously rich agricultural land of southern Iraq that the Abbasids controlled directly.1\nIn one critical way, however, al-Rashid had set the stage for the weakening of\nAbbasid power. As was typical of caliphs at that time, he had a number of sons by\ndifferent mothers, and each could advance a claim to succeed him. In many ways, this\nwas a wise practice. Infant mortality rates were staggeringly high in pre-modern times,\nso having multiple potential successors was a prudent hedge against the possibility that\nall legitimate claimants to the throne might pre-decease the reigning caliph\u2014a\ndevelopment that could, in turn, set the stage for a disputed succession and attendant\n1 Hugh Kennedy, When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World: The Rise and Fall of Islam\u2019s\nGreatest Dynasty (Cambridge, MA: Da Capo Press, 2004), 81\u201382, 130\u201332. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 09\npolitical instability. At the same time, however, that approach ran a different risk. As was\nnot infrequently the case in hereditary monarchies, the existence of a large number of\nlegitimate successors threatened to open the door to an alternate kind of crisis in which\nhalf-brothers jockeyed for the succession or, worse, followed the caliph\u2019s death by\nengaging in outright civil war.2\nAware of these risks, Harun al-Rashid took two steps to ensure a smooth\nsuccession. First, he publicly declared that his son, al-Amin (r. 809-813), would succeed\nhim as caliph. This decision was a prudent one that appeared to lay to rest the question\nof which son would accede to power upon al-Rashid\u2019s death. His second action was\nconsiderably less sensible, however. He followed by announcing that another son by a\ndifferent mother, al-Mamun (r. 813-833), would concurrently become the governor of the\nwealthy, autonomous province of Khurasan and, critically, would become al-Amin\u2019s\nsuccessor. Harun al-Rashid was not blind to the dangers inherent in this unorthodox\narrangement. To ensure that al-Amin and al-Mamun abided by it, he required them to\nsign the Mecca Protocol in which they pledged before God that they would respect his\nwishes. This agreement may have satisfied the caliph, but it did little to assuage the\nconcerns of those who doubted the wisdom of his convoluted succession scheme.\nIndeed, many astute observers predicted that his decision to name an heir to an heir\nwould \u201c\u2018cast dissension among his sons\u2019\u201d and produce a civil war.3\nThey were not wrong. Though both al-Mamun and al-Amin appeared initially to\nbe abiding by their father\u2019s wishes, competing factions soon pushed the brothers into\nconflict. The growing dissension revolved around control of the lucrative tax revenues of\nKhurasan. The Abna lived in Baghdad and supported al-Amin; they wanted the tax\nrevenue of their ancestral homeland to continue to come to the capital as it had since\nthe Abbasids had overthrown the Umayyads in 750. Opposed to them were the\naristocrats of Khurasan; backing al-Mamun, they sought greater autonomy from\nBaghdad and wished to retain the ample tax receipts that the province generated.\nEngaged in a bitter, zero-sum contest, these competing groups quickly poisoned the\nwaters and helped spark a war of words between al-Amin and al-Mamun. Finally, in late\n810, al-Amin irrevocably broke with al-Mamun by having his son Musa named as his\nsuccessor and by burning the agreement that he and his brother had signed.4\nAt first, few observers believed that al-Mamun could win the war. Al-Amin had\nmuch deeper financial and military resources than his brother, and, importantly, he\nretained the loyalty of the Abna that had constituted the core of the Abbasid army for the\nprior seven decades. Initially, as a result, both sides assumed that they were fighting not\n2 Hugh Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, Second Edition (New\nYork: Routledge, 2004), 142\u201343.\n3 Kennedy, When Baghdad Ruled the Muslim World, 68\u201371.\n4 Chris Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000 (New\nYork: Penguin Books, 2009), 322\u201323. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 10\nto resolve the question of which brother would reign as caliph, but instead to determine\nwhether al-Mamun would be able to retain control of Khurasan.5\nDespite al-Amin\u2019s substantial advantages, however, it was al-Mamun who\nprevailed in the civil war. Three events tipped the contest in his favor. First, after\ndefeating al-Amin\u2019s army in central Iran, al-Mamun\u2019s military commander, Tahir ibn\nHusayn (c. 775-822) seized control of the Sawad region in a lightening campaign and\nthus denied al-Amin what had been his main source of revenue. Second, rifts emerged\nbetween the Abna and al-Amin\u2019s other Arab supporters that paralyzed his effort to\ncoordinate the resistance to his brother\u2019s army. Finally, growing awareness that al-Amin\nwas responsible for the rupture and had ordered his subordinates to rip up the Mecca\nProtocol cost him nearly all his remaining popular support. As a result, by the time that\nTahir\u2019s army surrounded Baghdad in August 812, al-Mamun had secured recognition as\nthe rightful caliph everywhere but the capital.6\nStill, the war dragged on. Indeed, it was only after a grueling, thirteen-month\nsiege that Tahir\u2019s forces were finally able to breach the defenses and take control of the\nnow-devastated city. In the process, al-Amin was killed while trying unsuccessfully to\narrange his surrender.7\nTo a degree, al-Mamun\u2019s triumph turned out to be a pyrrhic one. It is true that he\nhad defeated his brother and taken control of the throne; in the process, however, his\nconflict with al-Amin had grievously weakened the Abbasids\u2019 grip on the empire. Most\nobviously, the dynasty had suffered its first meaningful loss of territory when the\ngovernor of the distant North African province of Tunisia, Abdallah ibn Ibrahim (r. 812-\n817), took advantage of the chaos of the civil war to secure de facto independence for\nthe Aghlabid Dynasty (812-909). More importantly, al-Mamun\u2019s inevitable decision to\ndisband the Abna army had left the Abbasids without a reliable military force of their\nown. As a result, the new caliph had no choice but to enter into a relationship with the\nTahir family to secure its continued military support. According to the understanding that\nthey worked out, the Tahirids would rule Khurasan and much of the eastern part of the\ncaliphate as autonomous, junior partners of the ruling dynasty; in exchange, they would\nprovide the caliphate with the military force needed to maintain control of the empire.8\nIn the short term, this arrangement proved to be mutually beneficial. While Tahir\nassumed control of Khurasan and its abundant tax revenue, his capable son, Abd Allah\n(c. 798-c. 845) quickly restored caliphal authority over Syria, Egypt, and other parts of\nthe empire that had broken away from the central government during the civil war.

In the decade following al-Amin\u2019s\ndefeat, he began to purchase Turkish slaves and to organize them into an army. The\nTurks made excellent soldiers. Hailing from Central Asia, they were a tough, nomadic\npeople who were highly skilled in the sophisticated military tactics of the steppes. It is\nimportant to understand that they were not slaves in the traditional sense. On the\ncontrary, though legally considered to be the property of the caliph, they lived as free\nmen of high status and earned an enviable salary.10\nDisciplined, powerful, and, above all, highly loyal, al-Mutasim\u2019s small but rapidly\ngrowing army paid substantial dividends for the dynasty. In the immediate aftermath of\nthe civil war, it proved vital in helping al-Mamun to restore caliphal authority to the\nempire. Later, as the only military formation that the Abbasids directly controlled, it gave\nthe dynasty a force that could balance the Tahirids\u2019 powerful army\u2014ensuring, in the\nprocess, that the ruling family would not find themselves pawns of their junior partners.\nIndeed, al-Mamun perceived the new army to be of such critical importance to the\ndynasty\u2019s independence that he felt compelled in the late 820s to name al-Mutasim\nrather than his own son, al-Abbas, as his successor.11\nThe new force of Turkish slave soldiers played a large part in impelling al-\nMutasim to make the fateful decision to relocate the seat of government soon after he\nbecame caliph in 833. The proximate cause of the move was the bitter resentment that\nthe Abna felt toward the Turks who had replaced them in the caliph\u2019s army. Angry at\ntheir loss of social and economic status, they had begun to vent their frustration by\nassaulting and even murdering Turkish soldiers in the streets of the capital. Less\nimmediate but equally important in spurring the move was the fact that Baghdad was\nalready fully built out and thus lacked the room needed to house and train his new\ntroops. Accordingly, in 835, al-Mutasim decided to move the army, palace, and\nbureaucracy to a new city, Samarra, located 130 kilometers north of Baghdad along the\nbanks of the Tigris River.12\n9 Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed.

Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 12\nAt first, the shift to Samarra was an unalloyed success. The move ended the\nattacks on al-Mutasim\u2019s Turkish soldiers and provided him with ample land on which to\nhouse and train his new army. The benefits of the relocation were not limited to the\nmilitary, moreover. On the contrary, moving the capital to Samarra paid substantial\npolitical dividends as well. Most notably, doing so gave al-Mutasim access to a new\nsource of patronage that he could use to maintain the support of key aristocrats:\ndevelopable land. Prior to the relocation, he had acquired at essentially no cost title to\nall of the property in and around Samarra, which, by virtue of its proximity to the new\nseat of power, was now of inestimable value. He then used it to secure the continued\nsupport of the elite by carefully doling it out to his most loyal supporters. In other words,\nas the historian Hugh Kennedy points out, the construction of the city of Samarra\namounted to a \u201cgigantic property speculation in which both government and its followers\ncould expect to benefit.\u201d13\nAnarchy in Samarra\nThe advantages inherent in the move to Samarra proved to be transitory,\nhowever. By the 860s, successive Abbasid caliphs found themselves virtual prisoners in\ntheir new capital. What accounted for this dramatic change in circumstance? At root, the\nAbbasids\u2019 worsening situation in Samarra was a function of the seemingly inevitable\nintrusion of the slave-soldiers into politics. The trouble began in 861 when a group of\nTurkish leaders learned that Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847-861) was planning to depose\nthem and seize their wealth. In desperation, they moved to defend their position by\nmurdering him at a drinking party and by replacing him with his son, whom they\nbelieved they could more easily control. This event was a watershed moment for the\nAbbasids. It initiated a nine-year period of anarchy in Samarra wherein successive\ncaliphs, isolated from their supporters, could neither assert their control over the\ngovernment nor arrest the growing power of the slave-soldiers.14\nUnsurprisingly, the chaos did not remain limited to Samarra. Instead, it sparked a\nvicious cycle across the caliphate that bred yet further disorder. Instability in the capital\nallowed warlords, strongmen and even provincial governors to establish de facto\nindependent states on the periphery of the empire\u2014in the process denying the central\ngovernment the tax receipts it needed to meet the demands of the increasingly restive\nslave soldiers. Frustrated by their inability to get the money they felt they deserved, the\nTurks would respond by violently deposing the reigning caliph in favor of a candidate\nwho they believed would be more pliable and therefore more likely to pay them. The\nrapid change in leadership would then further weaken the central government and\npermit even more regional leaders to secure autonomy, thus perpetuating the cycle.15\nThe result was anarchy on a grand scale. With the Turks making and unmaking\ncaliphs with abandon, no fewer than four men sat on the throne between 861 and 870\u2014\n13 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 162\u201363.\n14 Gordon, The Breaking of a Thousand Swords, 88\u201390.\n15 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 169\u201373. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 13\nall of whom died violently at the hands of their slave soldiers when they proved unable\nto come up with the revenue that the Turks demanded. Thus, by the late 860s, the\nAbbasids found themselves in dire circumstances. They had lost authority over large\nparts of the empire and had become prisoners of their angry and rebellious troops.16\nThe Abbasid Revival\nThat Abbasid rule continued after that 860s owed largely to the efforts of one\nman: prince al-Muwaffaq (842-891). Though he never formally held the title of caliph, he\nserved as the de facto regent and the power behind the throne from 870 until his death\nin 891. In that capacity, he took several critical actions to restore the dynasty\u2019s position.\nFirst, he moved to revive Abbasid fortunes by placating the soldiers. Having a military\nbackground and a strong relationship with the army, al-Muwaffaq was able to end the\nanarchy in Samarra and bring the Turks back into the fold by reassuring them both that\nthey would retain their position as the core of Abbasid military power and that the\ngovernment would pay their salaries on a regular basis. The restoration of order in\nSamarra and subsequent relocation of the government back to Baghdad set the stage\nfor his second action: the reestablishment of Abbasid authority over the empire\u2019s many\nrebellious provinces and breakaway states. Here, too, al-Muwaffaq enjoyed substantial\nsuccess. In 870, the dynasty had controlled little more than northern and central Iraq; by\nthe time of his death in 891, in contrast, it had regained control over western Iran, most\nof Syria, and southern Iraq.17\nThe Abbasids were never able to reassert the central government\u2019s authority\nover the rest of the empire, however. As noted earlier, rebels, outsiders, and regional\ngovernors had exploited the paralysis in Samarra during the 860s, to carve independent\nfiefdoms out of the empire\u2019s peripheral territory. In 868, for instance, the governor of\nEgypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun (r. 868-884), had established the independent Tulunid Dynasty\n(868-905); a few years later, Ismail Samani (r. 892-907) followed suit by consolidating\nthe existing Saminid Dynasty (819-1005) in the eastern province of Transoxiana. More\ntroublingly, in 861, a rogue coppersmith named Yaqub al-Saffar (r. 861-879) had\nestablished the Saffarid Dynasty (861-1003) when he took control of the province of\nSistan, located along the border between modern-day Iran and Afghanistan. Exploiting\nthe instability in the capital, he moved quickly to acquire additional territory in the east.\nMost notably, al-Saffar was able to take possession of the Tahirid capital of Nishapur in\n873\u2014in the process ending the sixty-year long partnership between the Tahirids and\nthe Abbasids.18\nIt is important to note that none of these states publicly declared that they were\nindependent of the central government. Both regional leaders and caliphs alike saw\nvalue in upholding the fiction that the local dynasties ruled as subordinates of the\nAbbasids. Regional rulers such as the Samanids acquired legitimacy through this\n16 Gordon, The Breaking of a Thousand Swords, 90\u201391.\n17 Gordon, 141\u201343.\n18 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 38. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 14\narrangement, while the caliphs enhanced their much-diminished status by being able to\nclaim authority over their nominal subordinates\u2019 territories.19\nIn reality, of course, caliphal power had diminished greatly. Claims to the contrary\naside, the local dynasties that emerged in the late-ninth and early-tenth centuries were\nindependent states in all but name. In reality, real caliphal authority did not\u2014and never\nagain would\u2014extend beyond Iraq, western Iran, and parts of Syria.20\nProblematically, moreover, the revival that al-Muwaffaq had spearheaded began\nto slow and then regress in the early tenth century. Fiscal issues accounted for this\nreversal of fortune. A combination of mismanagement, adverse environmental change,\nand the destruction of critical irrigation works in the civil wars and revolts of the ninth\nand early-tenth centuries had dramatically reduced agricultural productivity in the vital\nSawad and thus the tax yield on which Abbasid rule depended. To offset the decline of\nthis critical revenue stream, the government resorted to fiscal expediencies such as tax\nfarming: the already venerable practice of selling the right to collect state revenue in a\nprovince to private individuals. In the short run, this arrangement benefited the\ngovernment by supplying the treasury with an upfront infusion of cash; since the\npractice encouraged the tax farmers to squeeze as much revenue out of the province as\nthey could, however, it depressed economic activity in the long run and thus came at\nthe cost of substantially diminished future tax receipts.21\nBy the 920s, the bill for the caliphate\u2019s fiscal imprudence had come due. Put\nsimply, the regime lacked the revenue needed to maintain the cost of the palace and\nthe army. The result was renewed chaos in the capital. Now compelled to get by with\ngreatly diminishing resources, the central government experienced a new round of\nfactional infighting and civil war capped by the murder of the feckless Caliph al-Muqtadir\n(r. 908-932). Nominal subordinates of the central government were quick to pounce.\nTaking advantage of the paralysis in Baghdad, provincial governors and others\nestablished de facto independent states in Syria, northern Iraq, and western Iran. By the\nearly 930s, as a result, the caliph controlled little more than the capital and its\nimmediate surroundings.22\nThe Buyids\nThe end of caliphal autonomy finally came in 945. That year, the Buyids, a new,\nShi\u02bfi dynasty that originated on the south shore of the Caspian Sea, took advantage of\nthe instability in Baghdad to seize the capital. Dynamic and powerful, the Buyids quickly\n19 Hugh Kennedy, Caliphate: The History of an Idea (New York: Basic Books, 2016), 87.\n20 Kennedy, 87.\n21 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 106\u201311.\n22 Kennedy, Caliphate, 87\u201388. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 15\nreversed the collapse of central authority that had begun under al-Muqtadir\u2014adding\nIraq and large parts of Syria to their existing possessions in east and central Iran.23\nThough its rule did not last very long, the Buyid Dynasty would have an enduring\nimpact on other medieval Muslim states. Three of its governing practices would prove to\nbe especially influential. First, aware that they lacked broad public support because of\ntheir adherence to Shi\u02bfism, they opted not to depose the Abbasids but instead sought to\nlegitimate their rule by pretending to govern in the name of the caliph. The Abbasids\nthus continued to reign as figureheads\u2014as they would under future regimes\u2014while a\nsuccession of Buyids wielded real power under the title amir al-umara, or Commander\nof the Commanders. Second, building on fiscal changes that had begun in the caliphate\nin the ninth century, the Buyid Dynasty put an end to the Abbasid tradition of having a\ncentral bureaucracy direct the affairs of the state and oversee the collection and\ndistribution of taxes. Instead, it adopted a highly decentralized, tax farming arrangement\nwherein it divided its territory into semi-feudal land grants called iqtas that it then sold to\nmilitary leaders. Iqta holders were obliged to provide military service to the state and to\nforward a reduced share of the tax revenue they collected to Baghdad; in exchange,\nthey retained the bulk of the taxes that their iqta generated. Finally, the Buyids\nexpanded and institutionalized the practice of recruiting slave soldiers that the Abbasids\nhad begun.24\nThe Buyids\u2019 semi-feudal, decentralized political system rapidly caught on. Other\ncontemporary dynasties in the Middle East and Central Asia such as the Ghaznavids\n(977-1186) quickly adopted it, and it soon became the basic political structure that all\nsubsequent medieval Muslim states would adopt. That it proved so influential is perhaps\nsurprising in light of the fact that it had significant shortcomings. Three stand out. First,\npredictably, the decentralization of power produced internecine conflict among military\nleaders that helped to undermine the stability of the Buyid state. Second, the iqtas\nproved to have the same costs and benefits typical of other tax-farming systems: while\nthey provided the central government with a short-term infusion of revenue, they did so\nat the expense of long-term income. Finally, because the iqtas were revocable, the\nsystem encouraged those who held them to pursue quick profits at the expense of long-\nterm agricultural productivity\u2014a change that accelerated the increasingly precipitous\ndecline of the Iraqi economy that had begun in the ninth century.25\nThe Fatimid Challenge\nWhile the Buyids downplayed their Twelver beliefs to mollify their Sunni subjects,\nanother Shi\u02bfi dynasty, the Fatimids, initially flaunted their religion and explicitly declared\ntheir intention to replace the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate with an Isma\u02bfili Shi\u02bfi one. This\nnew dynasty originated in the late-ninth century with a Syrian man named Ubayd Allah\n(r. 909-934). Claiming descent from Imam Muhammad ibn Isma\u02bfil (c. 740-813)\u2014and,\n23 Kennedy, The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates, 210\u201334.\n24 Kennedy, 210\u201334.\n25 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 114. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 16\nthus, from Ali ibn Talib (r. 656-661) and the dynasty\u2019s namesake, Muhammad\u2019s\ndaughter Fatima (605-632)\u2014he declared publicly his intention to replace the Sunni\ncaliphate with a Shi\u02bfi one. Finding Syria inhospitable due to its close proximity to the\nAbbasids\u2019 seat of power in Iraq, he sent emissaries to the fringes of the Muslim world to\nsearch for an appropriate place to start his revolution. He found it in Tunisia. The\nBerbers who lived in the interior of that region were both receptive to Isma\u02bfili Shiism\nand\u2014as important\u2014resentful of the ruling Aghlabid Dynasty. Accordingly, Ubayd Allah\nleft Syria in the early-tenth century for Tunisia, where, after a brief campaign, his Berber\ntroops succeeded in overthrowing the Aghlabids. He followed by assuming the title of\nMahdi and by declaring the establishment of the Fatimid Caliphate.26\nTunisia was a good starting point for Ubayd Allah, but it was too far away from\nthe heart of the Muslim world to launch an effective challenge to the Abbasids. The\nFatimids consequently set their sights on conquering the wealthy and populous province\nof Egypt, from which they could more effectively contest Abbasid dominance. Early\nefforts were unsuccessful, and for a time the dynasty appeared to be fated to remain\nlittle more than a bit player on the periphery of the caliphate. The Fatimids\u2019 situation\nchanged quickly in the 960s, however. A combination of political instability and famine\nhad grievously weakened the Ikhshidid Dynasty (935-969) that had ruled Egypt since\n935. Astutely sensing the province\u2019s weakness, the Fatimid general Jawhar (?-992)\nseized Egypt in a nearly bloodless coup de main in 969. He followed his victory by\nordering the construction of a new capital, Cairo. Four years later, the Fatimid caliph, al-\nMuizz (r. 953-975), relocated his government to the city and declared forthrightly that\nthe dynasty intended to displace the Abbasids as the leaders of the Muslim world.27\nAs a result of its astute economic policies, his dynasty appeared for a time to be\npoised to achieve that ambitious goal. Most notably, a crash program of infrastructure\nconstruction and the suppression of pirates allowed the Fatimids to shift the western\nterminus of the lucrative, long-distance Indian Ocean trade from Iraq to Egypt\u2014a\nchange that produced a dramatic increase in tax receipts. The bulk of the new revenue\nwent to the expansion of the army and navy, which gave the Fatimids the strength to\nseize control of the Hijaz and most of Syria. They did not spend all of their fiscal windfall\non the military, however; instead, they devoted a substantial share of their newfound tax\nwealth to the goal of burnishing the dynasty\u2019s image in the Muslim world. As part of that\neffort, the Fatimids constructed the al-Azhar Mosque, a magnificent center of learning in\nCairo, and moved to ensure the safety of the hajj pilgrims by paying off the Bedouin\ntribes that had been attacking the caravans traveling to Mecca. For a time, these\ninitiatives were enormously successful. Indeed, by the year 1000, the Fatimids seemed\nto be well on their way to displacing the Abbasids as the rulers of a universal\ncaliphate.28\n26 Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome, 336\u201337.\n27 Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Volume 2: The Expansion of Islam in\nthe Middle Periods (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1974), 23.\n28 Kennedy, 188\u2013202. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 17\nThe dynasty\u2019s success in the tenth century did not continue in the eleventh,\nhowever. Instead, thanks to a combination of internal and external challenges, the\nFatimids\u2019 efforts to supplant the Abbasids soon ground to a standstill. Three issues\ncombined to stymie the dynasty. First, the Fatimids found themselves limited by the\nenduring appeal and deep roots of Sunni Islam. Isma\u02bfili missionaries did enjoy some\nsuccess in spreading Shi\u02bfism in Syria, but, on balance, they gained little traction among\nthe Sunni majority that dominated the heart of the Islamic world. Ironically, they had\neven less success in Egypt. There, however, the failure to win converts was less a\nfunction Shi\u02bfism\u2019s lack of appeal than of the Fatimids desire to avoid taking actions that\nmight spark dissension at home. Second, early in the eleventh century, the Fatimids\nadopted a slave-based military patterned on the system that the Buyids employed. The\nTurkish and African slave soldiers they purchased fought well and ensured the\ndynasty\u2019s continued military success; however, they also undermined the regime from\nwithin\u2014first when they began to engage in debilitating factional intrigue and then, in the\n1060s and 1070s, when they waged outright civil war among themselves. Finally,\nbeginning in the mid-eleventh century, the Fatimids began to face a new and serious\nchallenge in the Muslim world in the form of the dynamic and powerful Turkish Seljuq\nEmpire.29\nThe Seljuq Turks\nThe militarily powerful Seljuq Dynasty would profoundly alter the Middle East\ndespite the fact that it dominated the region for only a relatively brief period. It originated\namong the powerful Oghuz Turks who lived east of the Aral Sea. Led by the dynasty\u2019s\nnamesake, the warlord Seljuq (?-c. 1009), a group of Oghuz Turks migrated south in the\nlate-tenth century to Transoxiana where they adopted Sunni Islam. Under Seljuq\u2019s\ncapable grandsons, the dynasty followed by conquering Khurasan and much of Iran\nbefore seizing Baghdad from the tottering Buyids in 1055. Continued expansion\nwestward soon brought them into conflict with the formidable Fatimid Caliphate and the\nvenerable Byzantine Empire. These, too, proved no match for the Seljuqs. Under the\nable direction of Alp Arslan (r. 1063-1072) and his dynamic son, Malik Shah (r. 1072-\n1092), the Sunni Seljuqs handily drove the Fatimids out of Syria and wrested control of\nAnatolia from the Byzantine Empire. As a result, by the time of Malik Shah\u2019s death, the\nSeljuq Empire stood without question as the most powerful state in the Middle East.30\nSeljuq success was not entirely without problems, however. The rapid expansion\ninto the Muslim homeland created significant cultural friction between the Arabs and the\nTurkish newcomers. This situation may sound surprising in light of the fact that the\nArabs had substantial experience interacting with Turkish slave soldiers. The enslaved\nTurks who served in the military had been relatively small in numbers, however, and\nwere generally taken as children; they thus had little connection with the culture into\nwhich they had been born and generally adapted to the customs of the Arab majority.\nRetaining the cultural practices of Turkish Central Asia and adhering to Islam in only the\n29 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 286\u201387.\n30 Osman Aziz Basan, The Great Seljuqs: A History (Routledge, 2010), 53\u201354, 59\u201396. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 18\nbroadest sense, the Seljuq Turks were a different story altogether. In the eyes of\neducated, urban Arabs, the newcomers were violent, undisciplined boors who knew little\nof either Islamic law or the finer points of culture; as a result, Seljuq rule produced\nrumbles of discontent among the empire\u2019s Arab majority.31\nIn response, the Seljuq Dynasty made a deliberate effort to ingratiate itself with\nits Arab subjects. This campaign had three components. First, taking a page from the\nBuyids, the dynasty sought to legitimate Turkish rule by retaining the Abbasids as\nfigureheads. Tughril thus did not declare himself caliph but instead adopted the title of\nsultan; a derivative of the Arabic word for \u201cauthority,\u201d it indicated that the dynasty\naccepted the continuation of the caliphate while simultaneously making clear who held\nreal power. Second, in an effort to win over the influential religious scholars, the Seljuqs\nsignaled their embrace of education, culture, and Sunni orthodoxy by constructing and\nsupporting religious colleges called madrasas. Finally, to overcome the Turks\u2019\nreputation for crudeness and violence, the new rulers restored order and rebuilt\ndamaged infrastructure. These initiatives proved successful. Coupled with the Seljuqs\u2019\nability to establish direct control over most of the caliphate, they satisfied the Sunni\nArabs\u2019 desire for continuity and orthodoxy and, importantly, seemed to suggest that the\nnew rulers were in the process of reestablishing the universal empire that, since the\nninth century, had existed only in name.32\nUltimately, that conclusion proved to be inaccurate. The Seljuq family would\ncontinue to play a significant role in the Middle East for another century and a half\nfollowing Malik Shah\u2019s rule, but it did not oversee the restoration of a genuinely unified\ncaliphate. Instead, shortly after Malik Shah\u2019s death, the Seljuq state fragmented into a\nseries of squabbling principalities. What caused the sudden splintering of the Seljuq\nEmpire at a time when it faced little external pressure or internal unrest? Multiple factors\nplayed a role in its collapse, but the dominant one by far was the Turkish system of\ninheritance that the Seljuqs had brought with them from the steppes. Rather than\npracticing primogeniture wherein a single successor inherited the entirety of a political\nentity, the Turks followed a system of appanage in which families considered their\nholdings to be collectively held but individually administered. This arrangement\nfunctioned well enough when the dynasty was controlled by powerful figures who had\nthe authority and respect needed to assign territories among their relations and to\ncompel them to follow their commands. However, it did not work when the ruling family\nlacked a forceful leader. Such was the case following Malik Shah\u2019s death in 1092. When\nno dominant figure emerged to oversee the Seljuq realm, it quickly fractured among his\nbrothers, sons, nephews, grandsons, and generals into a collection of petty, warring\nstates.33\n31 Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes (New\nYork, NY: PublicAffairs, 2009), 127\u201330.\n32 Ansary, 127\u201332.\n33 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 117\u201319. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 19\nThe Caliphate Divided\nThe breakup of the Seljuq Empire at the end of the eleventh century marked the\nculmination of the process of division and devolution in the caliphate that had begun\nduring the civil war between al-Amin and al-Mamun. The changes that occurred during\nthat period were far-reaching and produced a political, economic, and social\nenvironment that was dramatically different from that which had existed at the start of\nthe ninth century. The political transformation of the caliphate was the most obvious.\nWhile the idea of the universal caliphate endured, the umma was no longer unified;\ninstead, it was divided into numerous competing states including no fewer than three\ndynasties that claimed to be the legitimate rulers of the Muslim world: the Abbasids in\nBaghdad, the Fatimids in Cairo, and, after, 929, the revived Umayyads in Spain.\nSignificant social changes paralleled the political decline of the caliphate. Most notably,\nthe slave-recruited Turkish troops that al-Mutasim had introduced and that the Buyids\nhad popularized had gradually displaced the Arab elite of bureaucrats, Abna soldiers,\nand landowners who had dominated the empire during the early years of the Abbasid\nDynasty. Finally, civil war, instability, and the spread of the iqta system did grievous\nharm to large parts of the Middle Eastern economy with Iraq suffering the greatest\ndecline. In sum, the period from 809 to the end of the eleventh century had been a time\nof volatility and conflict\u2014one that contrasted sharply with the stability, security, and\nunity that had existed at the end of Harun al-Rashid\u2019s reign.34\nThe Crusades\nThat the Middle East had fragmented politically toward the end of the eleventh\ncentury was a stroke of good fortune for the crusading European knights who were\nabout to mount a series of attacks on the region. Derived from the Latin word\ncrucesignatus, meaning \u201csigned with the cross,\u201d the term crusade denoted an armed,\npenitential pilgrimage organized and legitimated under the aegis of the Medieval\nCatholic Church. An innovation of the late-eleventh century, crusading was a broad\nphenomenon in both spatial and temporal terms. Indeed, over the next few centuries,\nWestern European knights would undertake crusades in places as disparate as Eastern\nEurope, Spain, Italy, and the south of France. Throughout the period, however, the\ncampaigns waged against the Muslims of the Middle East remained by far the most\nimportant crusades.35\nOrigins\nThe Crusades were very much a product of the culture of Late Medieval Europe.\nThey originated in the last decade of the eleventh century when a particular sequence\nof events, ideals, and needs came together to make them possible.

To understand the impetus for the\nCrusades, therefore, we must now briefly review the history of the Byzantine Empire in\nthe centuries that followed the Arab Conquest.\nFor some time after the Arabs had irrupted from the desert, the Byzantines had\nconfronted a remarkable combination of problems. Indeed, over the ensuing two\ncenturies, they experienced what surely must have seemed to contemporaries like an\nendless series of political, economic, religious, and\u2014especially\u2014military crises. By the\nearly ninth century, as a result, the once might Eastern Roman Empire had been\nreduced to a weak, regional power that controlled little more than Anatolia and a few\nscattered possessions in the Balkans.36\nNot long thereafter, however, the dark times passed, and the Byzantine state\nbegan to recover. Its revival was multifaceted. Politically, the establishment of the\nMacedonian Dynasty (867-1056) initiated a nearly two-century-long period in which a\nsequence of capable emperors provided effective leadership in Constantinople.\nMilitarily, the maturation of the Theme System\u2014a decentralized, semi-feudal structure\nof administration and recruitment established in the seventh century\u2014had produced a\ncapable, well-motivated army composed of farmer-soldiers who safeguarded their local\nprovinces. Highly effective at defense, the Theme System military gave the empire the\nability to reassert control of the southern Balkans and to stabilize the frontier with the\nAbbasid Caliphate. Economically, finally, the restoration of secure borders and the\nreestablishment of political stability set the stage for a period of sustained growth that\ndramatically improved the fiscal position of the state.37\nWith the empire on a solid footing for the first time since the start of the seventh\ncentury, its leaders moved to recover some of the territory that their predecessors had\nlost. The founder of the Macedonian Dynasty, Basil I (r. 867-886), initiated this effort by\nreconquering southern Italy. Over the next century and a half, a succession of emperors\nfollowed suit with similar wars of reconquest. Relying on powerful new, heavy-cavalry\nunits called tagmata, they regained control of Crete, Cyprus, southeast Asia Minor, and\nnorthern Syria\u2014including the important city of Antioch.38\nUnder Basil II (r. 976-1025), Byzantium\u2019s revival reached its apogee. Abroad, his\ndefeat of the Bulgars extended the empire\u2019s border to the Danube River for the first time\nin four centuries and gave Constantinople uncontested control of a belt of territory\nstretching from southern Italy in the west to the Euphrates River in the east. At home,\nhis reign coincided with a time of economic growth, political stability, and religious\nharmony. Indeed, his rule capped what had been a remarkable comeback\u2014one that left\n36 Wickham, The Inheritance of Rome, 261\u201378.\n37 Wickham, 261\u201378.\n38 Warren Treadgold, Byzantium and Its Army, 284-1081 (Stanford: Stanford University\nPress, 1998), 28\u201339. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 21\nByzantium more stable, unified, and secure than it had been at any point since Justinian\nthe Great (r. 527-565) had sat on the throne in the sixth century.39\nThe empire\u2019s revival came to an abrupt halt in 1071, however. At the Battle of\nManzikert fought that year in eastern Anatolia, Alp Arslan\u2019s Turkish warriors not only\ndefeated the Byzantine army but also captured Emperor Romanus IV Diogenes\n(r. 1068-1071). The engagement was neither a complete rout as earlier generations of\nhistorians had once described it, nor a defeat from which the empire could not recover;\nafter all, it had weathered similar setbacks in the past. For two reasons, however,\nManzikert turned out to be a fundamental turning point for the Byzantine state. First, the\ngrowing emphasis on the mobile, tagmata forces in the tenth and eleventh centuries\nhad come at the expense of the Themes System army. By 1071, as a consequence, the\nempire no longer had the capable local military formations that had proven so effective\nat defending Byzantine territory in the eighth and ninth centuries and thus lacked the\nforces needed to prevent Seljuq troops from exploiting their victory. Second, the\nstruggle to replace Romanus IV Diogenes failed to produce a quick winner; instead, it\ndragged on for a decade as Byzantine factions waged a vicious, zero-sum contest for\ncontrol of the throne.40\nThis divisiveness was a gift to the Seljuqs. With the Byzantine elite focused so\nintently on the internal contest for power, the empire\u2019s borders\u2014particularly its eastern\nfrontiers\u2014lay all-but undefended. Alp Arslan and his successor, Malik Shah, were well\naware of the situation, and wasted no time in taking advantage of it to grab imperial\nterritory. By the early 1090s, as result, the Seljuqs had taken control of nearly all of\nAnatolia\u2014the territory that for centuries had constituted the Byzantine Empire\u2019s beating\nheart.41\nDespite the dire situation, the empire somehow managed to stage yet another\ncomeback. It began with the accession of Alexius Komnenus (r. 1081-1118) to the\nthrone in 1081. The victor in the struggle for power that had marked the 1070s, he was\ndetermined to restore the empire and to recover the territory it had lost over the prior\ndecade. That task would not prove to be an easy one, as Byzantine weakness had\ndrawn the attention of a number of predatory states. Not only were the Seljuqs\ncontinuing to chip away at his territory in Anatolia, but Normans under Robert Guiscard\n(c. 1015-1085) and his son, Bohemund (c. 1054-1111) had launched an invasion of\nGreece the same year that Alexius had become emperor. Worse, powerful Pecheneg\nnomads invaded the northern Balkans in 1090. The situation was grim to say the least.42\nFortunately for the empire, Alexius was a peculiarly capable leader who had the\nsavoir faire and cunning to see it through this difficult time. Working tirelessly, he moved\n39 Robert Browning, The Byzantine Empire (Washington, D.C: Catholic University of\nAmerica Press, 1992), 114\u201317.\n40 Treadgold, Byzantium and Its Army, 284-1081, 39\u201342.\n41 Basan, The Great Seljuqs, 78\u201388.\n42 Browning, The Byzantine Empire, 157\u201361. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 22\nto restore the army by revamping military recruitment and by reforming the system of\ntax collection, and he pursued well-designed diplomatic initiatives designed to secure\nallies for the now-weakened empire. These efforts were successful. With critical\nassistance from the Venetians, his restructured army managed to drive the Normans\nout of Greece in 1085. More spectacularly, in conjunction with the nomadic Cuman\npeople, it achieved a decisive victory over the Pechenegs in 1091 and thus restored\nByzantine control of the Balkans.43\nWith the situation stabilized, Alexius next set his sights on regaining control of\nAnatolia. Conditions looked favorable for such an undertaking. As we have seen, the\nSeljuq Empire had split into a series of competing principalities and statelets controlled\nby rival members of the ruling dynasty following Malik Shah\u2019s death in 1092; as a result,\na Byzantine campaign in Anatolia would face a sharply divided enemy rather than the\nunified one that Arp Arslan had commanded. Even in division, however, Seljuq forces in\nthe region remained strong relative to the still-recovering Byzantine army. The empire\nwould thus need help if it hoped to overcome the Turks and regain its lost territories.\nAlexius had already identified the ideal force to provide that assistance: the heavy,\nlance-armed knights of Western Europe. Though he had emerged victorious, the\nemperor had nonetheless been immensely impressed by the power of those mounted\nwarriors when he had fought them in Greece in the 1080s. In fact, he had come to\nconclude that a small force of such troops would give his army the extra punch it\nneeded to beat the Seljuqs. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to Pope Urban II (r. 1088-\n1099) in 1095 formally requesting the pontiff\u2019s assistance in arranging for a contingent\nof knights to help his army regain the empire\u2019s lost territory in Anatolia.44\nThe First Crusade\nHis request for aid found a warm reception in Rome. Urban II had been in contact\nwith Alexius for several years and was increasingly excited about the prospects of\nsending a force of knights to the east. The pope\u2019s enthusiasm did not stem from a\ndesire to help Alexius regain control of Anatolia, however. Rather, it emerged out of his\nbelief that the emperor\u2019s appeal could be repurposed to justify a project of vastly greater\nscale and significance: the reconquest of the Holy Land from the Muslims. In other\nwords, rather than taking Alexius\u2019s request for what it was\u2014a comparatively modest\nappeal for military assistance from one medieval lord to another\u2014Urban II instead\nchose to use it as a pretext to mobilize the forces of Western Europe for a religious war\nagainst the Muslims states in the Middle East.45\nSuccess would allow Urban II to achieve three of the eleventh-century Vatican\u2019s\nmost cherished goals. First, commanding Christian nobles to wage war in the east\n43 Peter Frankopan, The First Crusade: The Call from the East, Reprint edition\n(Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012), 35\u201338.\n44 Tyerman, Crusades, 38\u201339.\n45 Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The Authoritative History of the War for the Holy\nLand (New York: Ecco, 2010), 34\u201335. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 23\nwould powerfully strengthen the papacy\u2019s hotly contested claim that the pope rather\nthan the Holy Roman Emperor was the head of the Church. Second, assisting the\nByzantine Empire might end the schism that in 1054 had divided the Church into\nEastern Orthodox and Catholic branches on terms favorable to the papacy. Finally,\nsending a large army to the Middle East raised the possibility of achieving an objective\nthat the papacy had, with growing enthusiasm, recently begun to contemplate: the\nreturn of Jerusalem\u2014site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection\u2014to Christian control.46\nTo win support for a holy war in the Middle East, Urban II went on a recruiting\ntour in 1095 capped by a massive gathering of nobles at Clermont in France. At the\nrally, he gave an impassioned address in which he called on the assembled aristocrats\nto organize a military campaign aimed at retaking control of Jerusalem. He was well\naware that he was asking a great deal. Such an operation would come at substantial\nexpense to those who participated in it and would take years to complete. Indeed, a\nsimilar proposal by one of his predecessors in the 1070s had met with a cool reception\namong nobles who were keenly aware of the costs that they would shoulder in\nundertaking such a complex and lengthy operation. Accordingly, Urban II carefully\nframed the expedition in a way that maximized its appeal to the aristocrats. Playing on\nthe religious sentiment of the assembled lords, he characterized it not as a traditional\nmilitary campaign, but instead as an armed, penitential pilgrimage. Critically, he also\ndeclared that those who participated would be absolved of all their sins.47\nThis last provision was a peculiarly powerful inducement to the men gathered at\nClermont owing to a dilemma that had long bedeviled members of their class. On the\none hand, the masculinity-driven social code that they followed impelled them to wage\nceaseless warfare against each other; on the other, the religious doctrines to which they\nadhered held that the violence they committed in those conflicts would condemn them\nto eternal damnation. Urban II\u2019s request seemed to provide a way out of this painful\npredicament. Taking part in an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem would not only absolve\nthem of the many sins that they had committed but would permit them to do so in a way\nthat was consistent with their class\u2019s social code. Accordingly, to shouts of \u201c\u2018God wills it!\nGod wills it!\u2019\u201d thousands of the assembled lords at Clermont agreed to take part in a\ncrusade that they knew would involve an expensive, multiyear trip to the Holy Land from\nwhich many would never return.48\nKnown to historians as the First Crusade, the operation got underway in the\nsummer of 1096. Travelling overland, the first contingent of crusaders reached the\noutskirts of Constantinople in the fall. With the steady arrival of further groups of knights\nover the winter and spring of 1097, the crusader army gradually swelled to between\n46 Thomas Asbridge, The First Crusade: A New History (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 2004), 15; Tyerman, Crusades, 21.\n47 Andrew Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States (New York: Pearson Longman,\n2004), 23\u201336, 47\u201354.\n48 Quoted in William Chester Jordan, Europe in the High Middle Ages (London: Penguin\nBooks, 2002), 104\u20135; Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 31. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 24\n50,000 and 70,000 soldiers \u2014a substantial force by the standards of the day. It did not\ntake long for the growing size of the crusader army encamped outside the Byzantine\ncapital to alarm Alexius and his advisors. The force of Western soldiers was far larger\nthan the modest contingent that the emperor had requested of Urban II and was\ndangerously close to the empire\u2019s seat of power; worse, their leaders included men like\nBohemund who in the 1080s had sought to take advantage of the empire\u2019s internal\nproblems to seize some of its territory. Alexius was a shrewd leader, however, and had\nlittle trouble identifying and exploiting the crusaders\u2019 weaknesses. Aware that they were\ndesperately low on food and required transport across the Bosporus, he compelled\nthem to swear fealty to him as vassals\u2014thus limiting their autonomy and ensuring that\nany former Byzantine territory they won would return to imperial control. The crusaders\nresented Alexius\u2019s terms but, in no position to refuse, reluctantly agreed to abide by\nthem.49\nThe military phase of the First Crusade began in earnest in the spring of 1097.\nAfter crossing the Bosporus Strait in May, the combined Byzantine-crusader army\ndecisively defeated a substantial Turkish force in Asia Minor\u2014thereby restoring imperial\ncontrol over western Anatolia and permitting unmolested passage into Syria. The\ncrusaders followed this victory by marching on Antioch. After a grueling nine-month\nsiege, they succeeded in taking the city in June 1098.50\nMuch needed, the victory was a major accomplishment for the crusaders.\nComing after a difficult winter in which the knights endured food shortages and the bitter\ncold of northern Syria, the capture of the city lifted their badly flagging morale. Perhaps\nmore important, their successful siege permitted them to regain their independence\nfrom Alexius. Using a misunderstanding between the crusaders and the Byzantine army\nover the conduct of the siege as a pretext, the leaders of the First Crusade reneged on\nthe oath of fealty that they had taken to the emperor. As a result, the city did not\nretrocede to Byzantine control following its capture; instead, the ranking nobles of the\nFirst Crusade agreed to name Bohemond as the prince of Antioch.51\nThe crusaders\u2014or Franks, as the Muslims called them\u2014were now tantalizingly\nclose to their final goal: Jerusalem. Determined to bring the First Crusade to a\nsuccessful close, they headed south in January 1099 and began to lay siege to the city\non June 7. The task did not appear to be an easy one. Attrition and the need to garrison\ncaptured territory had reduced the army that arrived outside Jerusalem to the point that\nthe crusaders lacked the strength to fully surround the city and thus could not reduce it\nthrough siege. Still committed to taking it, the Franks responded by successfully\nstorming the city on July 15. There followed a gruesome massacre in which the\ncrusaders killed thousands of Muslims and Jews. One eyewitness, Raymond of\nAguilers, claimed that the slaughter was so enormous that it filled the city \u201cwith blood \u2018up\nto their knees.\u2019\u201d Another firsthand observer, Fulcher of Chartres (c. 1059-1128)\n49 Tyerman, Crusades, 22.\n50 Frankopan, The First Crusade, 138\u201372.\n51 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 58\u201359. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 25\ndescribed a grisly scene in which crusaders burned piles of bodies in order to find gold\ncoins that Muslims had swallowed in a vain effort to prevent the Franks from seizing\ntheir wealth.52\nThe savagery described in these accounts has drawn a great deal of scrutiny in\nrecent times. Many characterize the violence as extraordinary in both scale and\nintensity. For example, the writer Tamim Ansary calls the sack of Jerusalem \u201can orgy of\nbloodletting.\u201d Such interpretations are not entirely inaccurate, but they overstate the\nextent and uniqueness of the violence in the Holy City. In reality, the crusaders\u2019 actions\nwere, while lamentable, neither extraordinary nor out of character with the times.\nIndeed, while the prevailing code of warfare to which both Christians and Muslims\nadhered entitled the crusaders to slaughter every resident of the city, current best\nestimates indicate that they only killed between 3,000 and 5,000 people. So what\nexplains the lurid language that Aguilers and Fulcher used in recounting the events that\nthey witnessed? Today, most historians agree that these descriptions were no more\nthan the exaggerations typical of a less-literal time. As the historian Thomas Madden\nwrites, \u201cstories of the streets of Jerusalem coursing with knee-high rivers of blood were\nnever meant to be taken seriously,\u201d\u2014a fact keenly understood by contemporaries, who,\nas Madden notes, \u201cknew such a thing to be an impossibility.\u201d53`\nOver the next few years, the crusaders solidified their hold on the Holy Land.\nShortly after they took Jerusalem, they extended their control of the region south of the\ncity by defeating a Fatimid army near Ascalon in southern Palestine\u2014an engagement\nthat is conventionally understood to mark the end of the First Crusade. Most of the\nremaining Franks thereafter returned to Europe to tend to their neglected landholdings.\nHowever, a steady stream of new arrivals offset their numbers and, with naval\nassistance from Venice, helped the crusaders who had remained in the Holy Land to\nreduce the remaining Muslim-controlled coastal cities that lay between Jaffa and\nAntioch. The conquest of these ports established the basic structure of what Europeans\nhad come to refer to as Outremer, or the \u201cland overseas.\u201d Thereafter, it occupied a thin\nbelt of territory that extended from Ascalon in the south to the city of Edessa in the north\nand consisted of four states: the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, the County\nof Edessa, and, most importantly, the Kingdom of Jerusalem.54\nThe First Crusade had been a remarkably successful operation and had borne\nfruit beyond Urban II\u2019s wildest dreams. Though operating in hostile territory thousands\n52 Jordan, Europe in the High Middle Ages, 110; Raymond of Aguilers quote from\nNorman Housley, Fighting for the Cross: Crusading for the Holy Land (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 2008), 218; Fulcher quote from Fulcher of Chartres, \u201cThe Capture of\nJerusalem,\u201d accessed January 17, 2020,\nhttps://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/fulcher-cde.asp.\n53 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 140; Thomas F.

Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 26\nof miles from their base of support, the knights who had traveled east had managed to\nwin three major and countless minor battles against powerful enemies. In the process,\nthey had succeeded in taking control of dozens of wealthy and often-well-defended\ncities. Above all, the soldiers of the First Crusade had\u2014despite long odds\u2014achieved\nUrban II\u2019s primary aim. Jerusalem and, with it, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher that\nmarked the sites of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection, were once more under\nChristian control.55\nThe success of the crusaders in the 1090s was nothing short of astonishing. Just\nfour years after the pope had called them to arms, the knights and other soldiers of the\nFirst Crusade had succeeded in traveling thousands of miles to the Holy Land and in\ntaking possession of dozens of wealthy cities including Jerusalem. That they hailed from\na comparatively impoverished corner of the globe made their victories against powerful\nTurkish armies supported by the wealthy and sophisticated cities and states of the\nMuslim Middle East even more remarkable. How did they do it? That is, what explains\nthe remarkable achievements of the crusaders in the face of such long odds?\nUltimately, three factors account for their success. First, the heavy knights that\nmade up the elite nucleus of the crusader armies constituted an enormously potent\nmilitary force. Heavily armored and equipped with powerful lances, they were capable of\nmounting charges of devastating effectiveness\u2014particularly against Turkish forces that\nhad little experience fighting them. Second, the knights played their diplomatic cards\nvery shrewdly. Most notably, the leaders of the First Crusade managed to lull the\nFatimid dynasty into a dangerous complacency by engaging it in lengthy diplomatic\ntalks that they terminated just weeks before their army arrived outside Jerusalem. Most\nimportantly, the First Crusade invaded the Middle East at a time when the region was\npeculiarly divided. The collapse of the Seljuq Empire following Malik Shah\u2019s death in\n1092 meant that the crusaders faced not a powerful, unified state, but instead a\ncollection of fractious principalities. Even in the rare instances when the crusaders did\nconfront a larger combination of enemies, moreover, they often benefited from the\nemergence of factionalism in their opponents\u2019 ranks. In a battle outside Antioch in 1098,\nfor example, the crusaders were able to achieve victory over a powerful Muslim army in\npart because resentful vassals abandoned their patron, the Turkish leader Kerbogha (?-\n1102), in the heat of the fight.56\nContingency\u2014luck\u2014thus played a pivotal part in the First Crusade\u2019s success.\nHad its participants attacked a few years earlier or a few decades later, they would\nassuredly have encountered a much more unified Middle East and would very likely\nhave found the going far-more difficult if not impossible. There is irony in this situation,\nfor the First Crusade succeeded for the same reason that the early Arab Conquest had.\n55 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 57\u201362.\n56 Carole Hillenbrand, The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives (Edinburgh: Edinburgh\nUniversity Press, 1999), 58. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 27\nIn both cases, the invaders triumphed not because they were the beneficiaries of divine\nprovidence, but instead because their timing was peculiarly fortunate.57\nOutremer\nUnsurprisingly, given the motivations of the crusaders, the rulers of Outremer\nmade little effort to respect the rights and position of their non-Catholic subjects during\nthe early years of Frankish rule. As they solidified control of the Holy Land toward the\nend of the First Crusade, for example, the crusaders had sporadically massacred non-\nCatholics and, to the fury of their Muslim subjects, had converted a number of religious\nshrines and mosques\u2014including the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque\u2014into\nchurches or administrative buildings. The crusaders\u2019 intolerant approach to the\ngovernance of the region did not long endure, however. Indeed, within just a few years,\nthe Franks who remained in the Holy Land gradually shed the religious fervor of the\nFirst Crusade in favor of a more pragmatic approach that centered on accommodation,\ndiscretion, and tolerance.58\nPractical needs drove the change. Weak in numbers following the return of many\ncrusaders to Europe, the Franks recognized that they would not likely maintain control\nover the region\u2019s diverse population of Muslims, Jews, non-Catholic Christians, Druze,\nand Alawites if they continued to mistreat those people. Likewise, they quickly came to\nunderstand that the diplomatic structure of the region would remain dangerously tilted\nagainst them if they refused to engage in the cross-cultural diplomacy needed to\nmaintain a favorable balance of power.59\nThe Franks\u2019 new, more-tolerant approach took several forms. To ensure\ndomestic tranquility, the crusaders adopted a tolerant attitude toward their non-Catholic\nsubjects that they patterned on the Muslim approach to the dhimmi. That is, in\nexchange for the payment of a poll tax, they left non-Catholic Christians, Muslims, and\nothers free to practice their religion as they saw fit\u2014an arrangement that guaranteed\nboth domestic stability and the steady flow of tax revenues. Diplomatically, meanwhile,\nthey entered into mutually beneficial, cross-religious alliances with nearby Turkish rulers\naimed at preserving the balance of power and thus preventing any Muslim leader from\nestablishing a powerful, unified state that could overwhelm Outremer. Most notably, the\nKingdom of Jerusalem frequently allied with the Burid Dynasty of Damascus in order to\nprevent the powerful ruler of Aleppo from adding that rich and strategically located city\nto his domain. Finally, while practical considerations had initially driven the shift to a\nmore tolerant approach, many of the crusaders who remained in Outremer\u2014and,\nespecially, those born there\u2014came to genuinely embrace the multicultural\ncosmopolitanism of the region. They learned new languages, adopted regional forms of\ndress and food, often developed a sincere appreciation for other cultures, and, in many\ncases, formed genuine bonds with non-Catholics. One Muslim writer, Usama ibn\n57 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 42.\n58 Phillips, \u201cThe Latin East, 1098-1291,\u201d 113.\n59 Phillips, 113\u201314. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 28\nMunqhid (1095-1188) claimed that he could tell at a glance if a Frank was a new arrival\nin the region based on whether that person had adopted local forms of dress, and he\nnoted approvingly \u201cthat \u2018there are some Franks who have settled in our land and taken\nto living like Muslims.\u2019\u201d Thus, within just a few short years, the Franks who had\nremained in the Holy Land had all but completely abandoned the intolerance and zeal\nthat had driven them to crusade in favor of a pragmatism that, ironically, played no small\npart in ensuring the success of the Crusader States during the early twelfth century.60\nZengi\nThe states of Outremer also benefited from the fact that the response to the\nCrusades was initially muted. During the first third of the twelfth century, Muslim rulers\nmade no effort whatsoever either to mount a meaningful counterattack or to organize a\ncollective defense against the Franks. What accounted for their apparent complacency?\nWhy did they not band together against the crusaders? To a substantial degree, the\nabsence of a concerted Muslim response to the Crusades was a function of the same\npolitical and social fracturing that had facilitated the success of the First Crusade. Far-\nmore focused on gaining advantage against each other than on responding to the\nnewcomers, the Turkish leaders of the principalities that adjoined Outremer generally\npaid little attention to the Crusader States save when they sought to enlist the Christians\nagainst their Muslim rivals.61\nThere were, however, some who correctly grasped the intent of the crusaders.\nMost notably, a number of educated, urban Arab legal scholars had deduced the\nFranks\u2019 goals from the start and had responded by reviving the concept of a jihad to\ndefend Dar al-Islam. However, they lacked a relationship with or influence over the\nnewly arrived and far-less sophisticated Turkish ruling class; accordingly, despite their\nvigorous efforts, they were unsuccessful in persuading the local princes to put down\ntheir differences and join together to form a common front against the Franks62\nOnly with the emergence of the powerful Turkish ruler of Mosul and Aleppo,\nZengi, (r. 1127-1146), would a coherent Muslim response to the Crusades begin to take\nshape. A shrewd leader, Zengi rose to prominence thanks to his conquest of the County\nof Edessa in 1144. His intentions in attacking Edessa are difficult to discern. On the one\nhand, his close relationship with the \u02bfulama\u02be and adoption of their language of jihad\nsuggest that he had religious motives. On the other, evidence indicating that he acted\nbecause Edessa\u2019s Frankish ruler had supported a rival Turkish dynasty against him\nsuggests that his motives were more practical than ideological. Regardless, the results\nof his victory were the same: thereafter, Zengi was able to credibly present himself as\n60 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 89\u201390; Quote from Madden, The\nConcise History of the Crusades, 47.\n61 Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades, 46\u201348.\n62 Madden, 46\u201348.

This response was merited. As we have\nseen, the Crusader States\u2019 foreign policy had relied on a divide-and-conquer strategy\ndesigned to prevent the emergence of a powerful, unified Muslim state adjacent to\nOutremer. Zengi\u2019s principality was as yet too small to constitute such a danger, but, as\nFrankish leaders grasped, his acquisition of the territory might give him sufficient power\nto assume control over the rest of Syria and thus upset the balance of power on which\nOutremer\u2019s security rested.64\nAccordingly, Pope Eugenius III (r. 1145-1153) responded to Zengi\u2019s victory in by\ncalling for another armed pilgrimage 1145 \u2014later known as the Second Crusade (1145-\n1149)\u2014aimed at retaking Edessa. The response to his request for volunteers was\nsubstantial. Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III of Germany (r. 1138-1152) and King Louis\nVII (r. 1137-1180) of France both raised large armies and marched toward the Holy\nLand via Constantinople. Other groups of crusaders departed later via ship; en route,\nsome of them helped King Alfonso I (r. 1139-1185) of Portugal conquer Lisbon from\nSpanish Muslims. Those who traveled by sea arrived in Outremer without difficulty; in\ncontrast, those who took the overland route suffered crushing defeats at the hands of\nthe Turks while trying to cross Anatolia. As a result, by the time Conrad III and Louis\nVII\u2019s battered columns joined those Franks who had traveled by ship to Outremer, the\nassembled troops of the Second Crusade lacked the strength to attack the powerful\nstate that Zengi had assembled and thus could not recover Edessa.65\nNot wanting to return to Europe in defeat, they decided to abandon the original\ngoal of the Second Crusade in favor of a new objective: the conquest of the less-well\ndefended city of Damascus. It may have been a more realistic goal for the depleted\nforces of the Second Crusade, but the city\u2019s capture still proved to be well beyond the\ncapacity of the assembled knights. Indeed, the effort to besiege Damascus ended in a\nhumiliating retreat after only four days when the Franks realized that their army was in\ndanger of being destroyed by superior Muslim forces. Thus, despite the commitment of\nsubstantial resources and the raising of significant armies, the Second Crusade ended\nin embarrassment and abject failure\u2014unable either to retake Edessa or to shore up the\nCrusader States in any meaningful way.66\n63 Hillenbrand, The Crusades, 110\u201314; Paul M. Cobb, The Race for Paradise: An\nIslamic History of the Crusades (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 134\u201335.\n64 Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades, 53\u201354.\n65 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 84\u201388.\n66 Housley, Fighting for the Cross, 8\u201311. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 30\nNur ad-Din\nMeanwhile, a new leader had emerged to take charge of the struggle against the\nFranks. After an enslaved person murdered Zengi in 1146, his son, Nur ad-Din (r. 1146-\n1174), inherited the now-expanded principality of Aleppo. He proved to be an even\nmore determined and effective opponent of the crusaders than his father had been. To\nthe delight of the religious scholars, he had opened his reign by going to war with\nAntioch and had followed by decisively defeating a crusader army in 1149. Continued\nsuccess in the 1150s further strengthened his position. Most notably, his seizure of the\nstrategic city of Damascus in 1154 unified Muslim Syria under his control and\ndemonstrated that he had both the will to wage a jihad against the Crusader States and\nthe resources to sustain such a campaign. Accordingly, recruits flocked to his banner \u2014\nespecially after he declared that his central goal was the reconquest of Jerusalem.67\nNur ad-Din\u2019s victory at Damascus greatly alarmed the King of Jerusalem,\nBaldwin III (r. 1143-1163). As we have seen, the rulers of the Crusader States had long\nbelieved that they would be in mortal peril if a powerful Muslim leader managed to unify\nSyria. Now, with Zengi\u2019s acquisition of Edessa and, especially, Nur ad-Din\u2019s capture of\nDamascus the Franks appeared to face the very situation that they had worked so hard\nto prevent. Fortunately for Baldwin III and the other Frankish leaders, they were not\nalone in expressing alarm about the emergence of a formidable Muslim state in Syria.\nByzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143-1180) shared their concerns and\nagreed to work with them to contain Nur ad-Din. As a result, the Muslim leader was\nunable to mount an effective attack against the Crusader States in the 1150s.68\nNur ad-Din did not accept this diplomatic setback passively. Instead, he sought to\noffset it by building up his strength elsewhere in the region. The once-powerful Fatimid\nstate appeared to offer the best opportunity for him to do so. By the 1160s, Fatimid\nEgypt had come to have a peculiar mix of strengths and weaknesses that made it a\ntempting target. On the one hand, its economy produced substantial tax revenue thanks\nto its dominance of the lucrative trade with India and to the Fatimids\u2019 investment in its\nirrigation systems. On the other, worsening factionalism in the governing class and a\nsuccession of child caliphs had combined to progressively loosen the Fatimid Dynasty\u2019s\ngrip on the province.69\nEager to strengthen his state in the face of the Byzantine-crusader alliance, Nur\nad-Din began to probe for ways in which he could exploit the political divisions in Cairo\nto his advantage. He got his chance in 1163. That year, the recently deposed Fatimid\nvizier Shawar (?-1169) offered Nur ad-Din one-third of Egypt\u2019s tax revenue in exchange\nfor helping him return to power. The Turkish leader pounced at the opportunity. He\nordered one of his subordinates, the Kurdish general Shirkuh (?-1169), to march his\narmy into Egypt and help restore Shawar to the vizirate. Unfortunately for Nur ad-Din,\n67 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 111\u201313.\n68 Jotischky, 92.\n69 Asbridge, The First Crusade, 265\u201372. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 31\nhis bid to assume a dominant position in Egypt failed thanks to the prompt actions of\nBaldwin III\u2019s successor, Amalric (r. 1163-1174). Well aware of the danger that Nur ad-\nDin\u2019s move posed to his kingdom, he intervened in Egypt and helped to defeat Shirkuh\u2019s\nexpeditionary force. Amalric\u2019s victory proved short lived, however. A subsequent\nintervention by Shirkuh in Egypt in 1169 not only succeeded but did so beyond Nur ad-\nDin\u2019s wildest dreams. Rather than merely gaining control over part of the province or a\nshare of its tax revenue as had been the goal in 1163, Shirkuh managed to secure for\nhis Turkish lord the entirety of Egypt. It was a major coup. With Egypt added to Syria,\nNur ad-Din now had more than adequate tax revenues and resources to defeat the\nFranks.70\nSalah ad-Din\nUltimately, however, Nur ad-Din was not the ruler who would lead the attack on\nthe Crusader States. Instead, leadership of the jihad against Outremer would fall to\nShirkuh\u2019s nephew and lieutenant: Salah ad-Din (r. 1174-1193). Known as Saladin in the\nWest, this ambitious and capable upstart spent most of the early part of his reign\nengaged in high-stakes political maneuvering\u2014initially to gain ascendancy in Egypt and\nthen to assume control of Nur ad-Din\u2019s empire. His ascent was rapid. He first\nestablished himself as a significant political figure when he succeeded his deceased\nuncle as Nur ad-Din\u2019s chief subordinate in Cairo in 1169; two years later, he\nconsolidated his position in Egypt by abolishing the Fatimid Caliphate. To this point, his\nmoves had been careful, incremental ones designed to enhance his power without\nalarming Nur ad-Din. In 1174, however, fortune provided him with the chance to reach\nfor the brass ring. Nur ad-Din\u2019s death that year and the accession of his eleven-year-old\nson created a political vacuum that Salah ad-Din believed he could exploit to take\npower. Moving aggressively, he travelled to Damascus where he married Nur ad-Din\u2019s\nwidow\u2014a common medieval Muslim political ploy\u2014and assumed the role of regent. He\nfollowed by solidifying his control of Syria and, more importantly, by formally displacing\nNur ad-Din\u2019s son as ruler\u2014establishing, in the process, the Ayyubid Dynasty (1171-\n1260).71\nSalah ad-Din had long expressed a desire to lead a jihad against the Crusader\nStates; with his territory now all-but surrounding Outremer, he was finally in a position to\ndo so. Accordingly, after securing recruits by declaring holy war, he invaded the\nKingdom of Jerusalem in 1187 with a huge army. Taking advantage of dissension\namong the Franks, he skillfully maneuvered the poorly-led crusaders into a position\nnear the Sea of Galilee that lacked water. With the Franks suffering heat stroke and\nsevere dehydration, the ensuing battle was a complete rout. Salah ad-Din\u2019s troops\nslaughtered thousands of crusaders, put the survivors to flight, and\u2014worst of all in the\neyes of the Christians\u2014took possession of the True Cross. Quickly exploiting his\nvictory, he followed by seizing Jerusalem and nearly the entirety of Outremer from the\n70 Cobb, The Race for Paradise, 160\u201363.\n71 Hillenbrand, The Crusades, 171\u201372. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 32\ndemoralized Franks. It was a dark day for the crusaders. Having been reduced to the\nports of Tyre, Antioch, and Tripoli, Outremer was teetering on the brink of extinction.72\nThe impending failure of the Crusader States and, especially, the loss of\nJerusalem stunned and dismayed Europe. The news was so troubling, in fact, that Pope\nUrban III (r. 1185-1187) reputedly died of shock when told of the city\u2019s fall. The Church\nwas not yet ready to give up the dream of a Christian-controlled Jerusalem, however.\nInstead, barely a week after Urban III\u2019s death, his successor called on Europe\u2019s kings to\nmount another crusade aimed at regaining control of the city. The response was\ntremendous. In 1190, French King Philip II (r. 1180-1223) and British monarch Richard\nthe Lionheart (r. 1189-1199) both raised large armies and set out by sea for the Holy\nLand; concurrently, the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1155-1190),\nmarched overland with an even-larger force. Massive in scale and enjoying the support\nof innovative new financial mechanisms such as the Saladin Tithe, the Third Crusade\nappeared to be unstoppable.73\nUnfortunately for the Franks, it proved to be anything but. The problems started\nwhen Frederick Barbarossa drowned while crossing a river in Asia Minor; absent his\ncommanding presence, his demoralized army disintegrated. Meanwhile, though Richard\nand Philip II both arrived in the Middle East in 1191 without difficulty, they soon had a\nfalling out stemming from Philip II\u2019s envy of Richard\u2019s popularity\u2014a jealousy enhanced\nby the fact that Richard, though technically Philip II\u2019s vassal, was considerably more\npowerful than his putative liege lord. In response, the French king abandoned the field\nin a pique and returned to France with the bulk of his army. As a result, the Third\nCrusade appeared doomed to failure.74\nDespite seeing many of the crusaders return to France, Richard remained\nundaunted. A skilled and charismatic commander, he rallied his remaining troops and\nwent on a successful offensive. Under his careful direction, his army retook the key port\ncities of Acre and Jaffa after which it savaged Salah ad-Din\u2019s army at Arsuf. For a time,\nas a result, Richard appeared poised to retake Jerusalem. Unfortunately for him, the\nvictory at Arsuf marked the high point of his campaign. Thereafter, the two sides\u2019\nasymmetric strengths produced a stalemate. Richard\u2019s superior generalship could not\nfully offset Salah ad-Din\u2019s larger army, while Salah ad-Din\u2019s bigger force could not\nentirely overcome the king\u2019s tactical gifts.75\nComplicating matters was the fact that both leaders had other pressing issues\nthat they needed to address. Concerned that Philip II was exploiting his absence to\nweaken his position back home, Richard was eager to return to England as soon as\n72 Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades, 69\u201375.\n73 Jonathan Riley-Smith, The Crusades: A Short History (New Haven: Yale University\nPress, 1987), 84\u201387.\n74 Christopher Tyerman, Fighting for Christendom: Holy Wars and the Crusades (New\nYork: Oxford University Press, 2004), 50\u201353.\n75 Jotischky, Crusading and the Crusader States, 159\u201361. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 33\npossible; Salah ad-Din, for his part, had watched the prestige he had acquired by taking\nJerusalem in 1187 evaporate as a result of Richard\u2019s success against him. In 1192, as a\nresult, the two men came to an agreement formalized in the Treaty of Ramla. By its\nterms, Richard recognized Muslim control of Jerusalem; in exchange, Salah ad-Din\nceded the coastal strip from Jaffa to Antioch to the crusaders and agreed to grant\nChristian pilgrims free entry into Jerusalem.76\nLater Crusades\nRichard had achieved a great deal, but his failure to regain control of Jerusalem\nleft many Europeans feeling that the Third Crusade was a failure. Among them was the\nnew pope, Innocent III (r. 1198-1216). Dismayed by the inability of the Third Crusade to\nretake the Holy City, he called for a new campaign, the Fourth Crusade, shortly after he\nacceded to the papacy. Launched with great fanfare, it not only failed to regain\nJerusalem, but never even made it to the Holy Land. Instead, sniffing opportunity in the\nByzantine Empire, the crusaders became involved in a complicated succession dispute\nin Constantinople in 1203 that ended the following year when they assaulted the city\nand established it as the capital of a new, Frankish-ruled state called the Latin Empire.\nThe new empire had a short and rocky life. Its Eastern Orthodox subjects bitterly\nresisted both Western rule and the imposition of Catholic doctrines and rites, and its\nrulers never controlled more than a small part of Byzantine territory.77\nAs a result, under the direction of the Palaeologus Dynasty, the Byzantine army\nwas able to redeem Constantinople in 1261. For a time, it seemed that the empire might\nachieve yet another recovery. By this point, however, Byzantium\u2019s many problems were\nwell beyond the capacity of its leaders to solve given the empire\u2019s limited resources.\nShorn of much of its territory and surrounded by predatory enemies eager to exploit its\nweaknesses, it thereafter survived as little more than a shell of its former self, until, as\nwe shall see in chapter six, the cannon-equipped Ottoman Turks finally administered\nthe coup de grace in 1453.78\nMeanwhile, the Western Europeans continued to mount crusades over the\ncourse of the thirteenth century. None of them could match the success of the First\nCrusade, however. Indeed, with the exception of the Sixth Crusade in the 1220s, which,\nthrough a diplomatic agreement, briefly retook Jerusalem, all of them were abject\nfailures. Largely focusing on Egypt, the soldiers of these later crusades found\nthemselves consistently outmaneuvered and defeated by larger and better-led Ayyubid\nforces. Still, despite those failed efforts, the Crusader States themselves endured.\nRelying more on savvy diplomacy and the lure of trade than on force of arms, the\n76 Jordan, Europe in the High Middle Ages, 174\u201375.\n77 Tyerman, Crusades, 35\u201338.\n78 Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades, 105. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 34\nFranks managed for the time being to retain control of all of the territory that Richard\nhad recaptured.79\nThe Mongols\nAt about the same time as the Fourth Crusade, meanwhile, a vastly more\ndangerous threat to the Muslim world, the Mongol Empire, was quietly emerging\nnortheast of China. The Mongols were a loose confederation of nomadic tribes that had\nlong lived on the northern steppes of Asia. There, they herded livestock, raided the\nwealthy Chinese Empire of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and warred with similar\nnomadic groups such as the Tatars. Like the other peoples of the region, the Mongols\nwere militarily far more powerful than their relatively modest numbers would suggest.\nToughened by the hard life of the Eurasian Steppe and well-practiced in sophisticated\nbattle tactics as a result of the constant wars they fought with other nomads, they\npossessed a latent power constrained only by the fact that they remained divided\namong themselves into a number of competing tribes.80\nTheir disunity ended in 1206. That year, a powerful young war leader named\nTemujin (c. 1162-1227) succeeded in bringing all of the Mongol tribes together under\nhis leadership. Taking the title Chingiss Khan, meaning Universal Leader, he followed\nby embarking on a remarkable\u2014and unusually brutal\u2014campaign of conquest. As the\nGreat Khan, he first defeated nearby nomadic rivals such as the Tatars and the Tanguts\nand followed by incorporating them into his empire. He then wrested control of northern\nChina from other nomadic groups that had long dominated that region. Spreading\nrapidly westward, his empire soon reached the frontier of Khwarazmia, the easternmost\nMuslim state in Central Asia.81\nChingiss Khan initially had no hostile intentions toward the Muslim world. He\nviewed his new border with Khwarazmia not as a jumping off point for conquests, but\nrather as a valuable link to the Middle East\u2019s vibrant economy. Toward that end, he sent\na caravan of merchants laden with eastern luxury goods on a trade mission into\nKhwarazmia in 1218 with instructions to negotiate a commercial agreement with its\nruler, Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad (r. 1200-1220). Muhammad was not receptive to\nChingiss Khan\u2019s commercial initiative, however. Eager to demonstrate his toughness,\nhe responded by ordering his soldiers to plunder the caravan and to kill its 450\nmerchants. Worse, when Temujin sent three envoys to demand restitution, Shah\nMuhammad ordered one beheaded and the others shorn of their beards\u2014a serious and\ncalculated insult in the culture of medieval Central Asia.82\n79 Tyerman, Fighting for Christendom: Holy Wars and the Crusades, 60\u201364.\n80 Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Volume 2, 286\u201387.\n81 Peter Frankopan, The Silk Roads: A New History of the World (New York: Knopf,\n2015), 154\u201356.\n82 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 153. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 35\nThis act enraged Chingiss Khan and led him to initiate the first phase of what\nwould be a decades-long Mongol war with the Muslim world. Raising a huge force, he\ninvaded Khwarazmia in 1219, defeated its army, and put Shah Muhammad to flight.\nOver the next few years, the vengeance-minded Mongols brutally sacked the cities of\nBalkh, Merv, Samarkand, and Nishapur as they pressed westward into the Islamic\nheartland. While we can reject the exaggerated claims of contemporary Muslim\nwriters\u2014the Mongols most certainly did not kill 1,750,000 people at Nishapur\u2014the\nevidence is equally clear that they waged this war in a peculiarly ruthless and brutal\nfashion.83\nTemujin\u2019s death in 1227 led to a brief pause in the Mongol onslaught, but, by the\nearly 1230s, they were back on the offensive. Having conquered Muslim Central Asia,\nthey now focused on adding Iran to the great khan\u2019s empire. There, Mongol armies\nslaughtered huge numbers of people, destroyed cities, and even deliberately destroyed\nmany of the qanat, the ancient, underground canals on which Iranian agricultural\nprosperity depended. Indeed, the devastation and loss of life in Iran was so enormous\nthat the historian Ira Lapidus maintains that the Mongol invasion \u201camounted to a\nholocaust.\u201d The Mongols followed in 1243 by attacking Asia Minor, where they shattered\nthe last significant Seljuq principality, the Sultanate of Rum. With that defeat, hope\nebbed in the Islamic world that Muslim soldiers could ever check the Mongols. Just\nwhen the situation appeared grimmest, however, the Muslim Middle East caught a\nbreak: a succession dispute halted the onslaught and gave the Muslims a few years of\ndesperately needed breathing space. As we shall see, that respite would prove\npivotal.84\nWith the succession finally sorted out in 1251, Monge Khan (r. 1251-1259), the\nnew Great Khan of the Mongols, moved to restart the conquests. He began by dividing\nhis empire into four semiautonomous khanates that he distributed among his brothers.\nHe gave the southwestern most one, the Ilkhanate, to his brother Hulagu (r. 1256-\n1265), along with instructions to complete the conquest of the Muslim world. Taking\none-fifth of the Mongol army with him, Hulagu quickly set to work. He began in 1256 by\nreducing the Assassins\u2019 heretofore impregnable Alamut Castle\u2014thus destroying their\npeculiar, non-contiguous state. He followed in 1258 by marching his army to Baghdad,\nwhere he hoped to compel al-Musta\u2018sim (r. 1242-1258), the thirty-seventh and final\nAbbasid caliph, to surrender. When the latter refused to yield, Hulagu ordered his\nsoldiers to storm the city. Possessing sophisticated siege equipment, they easily\noverwhelmed the defenders and took possession of Baghdad. They followed by sacking\nthe city with a brutality that was peculiar even by the standards of the day. Mongol\nsoldiers killed hundreds of thousands of people, razed buildings of inestimable beauty\nand historical significance, and destroyed the priceless contents of the city\u2019s many\nlibraries by pitching books into the Tigris River. They also did enormous damage to the\n83 Steven R. Ward, Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces\n(Washington, D.C: Georgetown University Press, 2009), 26.\n84 Ward, 26; Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 226. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 36\nirrigation system of central Iraq, and thus ensured that the city would lack adequate food\nsupplies to recover.85\nPerhaps most distressing to educated urban Muslims, Hulagu also ordered al-\nMusta\u2019sim and his sons killed. Accounts differ as to how they were murdered, but a\nconsensus of historians now agree that the Mongols most likely first wrapped them in\ncarpets and then had horses trample them to death so as to avoid defiling the earth with\nroyal blood. Regardless of the specifics, al-Musta\u2019sim\u2019s execution sent shockwaves\nthrough the umma. Though the Abbasids had not exercised real power outside of Iraq\nfor centuries, the dynasty nonetheless remained a powerful symbol of Muslim unity and\npower. As such, the end of the ruling house that had held the caliphate since 750\nmarked a distressing watershed for a Muslim world that increasingly felt it had lost its\nway.86\nMamluks\nHulagu next set his sights on the only remaining independent Muslim state of any\nconsequence: Egypt. Though vastly weaker than the Ilkhanate, Egypt was prepared to\nput up a vigorous resistance thanks to a recent change in leadership. In 1250, Turkish\nslave soldiers called Mamluks, a term that means, literally, \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cowned men,\u201d\nhad taken advantage of instability in the Ayyubid court to seize power and establish the\nMamluk Sultanate (1250-1517). Disciplined and well organized, they formed a powerful\narmy that promised to valiantly resist the Mongols. Still, they faced long odds. Indeed,\nthe sheer size of Hulagu\u2019s horde and its extensive battle experience suggested that the\nMamluks would almost certainly go down in defeat as the two armies prepared for battle\nnear Ayn Jalut in Palestine in 1260.87\nAyn Jalut\nFortunately for the Mamluks, two factors combined to give them a shot at\ndefeating the Mongols. First, not long before the battle, news had reached Hulagu that\nMonge Khan had died. Eager to take part in the deliberations at the kurultai\u2014the\nmeeting at which the Mongol chiefs would choose the next Great Khan\u2014he returned to\nthe capital of Karakorum with most of his troops. The Mongol army that continued\ntoward Egypt thus only numbered about 10,000 fighters\u2014still powerful, but a fraction of\nthe force that had destroyed the caliphate in 1258. Second, Baybars (r. 1260-1277), the\ncommander of the Mamluk army, was a peculiarly adept tactician and possessed an\nintimate familiarity with the region in which the battle was fought. The combination of\nrelatively even numbers and strong leadership proved enough to tip the balance. In the\n85 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 153\u201356.\n86 Frankopan, The Silk Roads, 162\u201363.\n87 Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Volume 2, 267\u201368, 417. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 37\nensuing Battle of Ayn Jalut, the Mamluks scored a decisive victory. Egypt had been\nsaved.88\nThe results of the battle were enormously significant. First, and most obviously, it\ngave the victors time to consolidate and strengthen their regime. As a result, the\nMamluk state would never again be as vulnerable to a Mongol attack as it had been on\nthe eve of the Battle of Ayn Jalut. Second, and far more important, Baybars\u2019s victory\nensured that independent Islamic rule would survive at a time when its future seemed\nvery much in doubt.89\nThe impact of the battle on Egypt\u2019s political structure was also far reaching. Just\ntwo months after the victory, Baybars and a group of co-conspirators arranged to have\nthe reigning sultan, Qutuz (r. 1259-1260), assassinated. Not long thereafter, Baybars\nmanaged to navigate his way through the treacherous waters of Mamluk factional\npolitics to succeed Qutuz as the new sultan. It was a bold move for the victor of Ayn\nJalut, but, ironically, it was also one that put him in a precarious position: if he did not\nquickly find some way to legitimate his rule, he would very likely find himself facing the\nsame fate as his predecessor. In a stroke of good fortune, the arrival of an Abbasid\nprince, Abu al-\u2018Abbas Ahmad, in Cairo in 1262 afforded him the opportunity to do so. In\nan elaborate ceremony, Baybars had Ahmad proclaimed Caliph al-Hakim I (r. 1262-\n1302); in exchange, the newly installed caliph urged Muslims in Egypt to acknowledge\nBaybars\u2019s rule as sultan, and thus accorded him the legitimacy he needed.90\nIn this way, the caliphate that the Mongols had destroyed in 1258 was\nresurrected in Cairo in 1262. Its rebirth was a symbolically significant event for\nMuslims\u2014one that upheld the idea that the Islamic world remained united under a\nsingle, universal ruler. In reality, however, nothing substantive had happened as a result\nof al-Hakim I\u2019s accession. The line of Abbasid caliphs who reigned in Cairo were\npowerless figures who lacked a court or even a retinue. Indeed, they continued to hold\noffice only because the Mamluks saw utility in retaining the position. Lacking even the\npretense of power, they were figureheads of the feeblest sort\u2014a dynasty whose\nauthority and responsibilities never rose above the ceremonial.91\nMamluk Government and Economy\nAs we have seen, the use of slave soldiers had been commonplace in the\nMuslim world since al-Mutasim had first introduced the practice in the ninth century. It\nwas under the Mamluk regime, however, that the arrangement reached its apotheosis.\nSuperficially, the Egyptian system was similar to that of earlier dynasties that had relied\non enslaved troops. Like those states, the Mamluk government replenished the ranks of\nits army by purchasing Circassian or Turkish adolescents who had grown up in the\n88 Hillenbrand, The Crusades, 225\u201326.\n89 Asbridge, The Crusades, 620\u201328.\n90 Kennedy, Caliphate, 248.\n91 Kennedy, 248. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 38\nharsh environment of the Eurasian Steppe. It then raised and educated them in\nbarracks until they were ready to serve the regime. Here, however, the Mamluk system\ndiffered from earlier practices. While previous dynasties had restricted the use of slaves\nin state service to the army and had reserved the administration of government to free-\nborn subjects, Mamluk Egypt instead relied upon enslaved people\u2014and only enslaved\npeople\u2014to staff both its military and its bureaucracy. Even the children of the Mamluks\nwere barred from joining the ruling class. Thus, the Mamluk system was a unique one in\nwhich nominally enslaved people rather than free-born ones controlled the government.\nIt was also one that proved durable and effective, and that was, by the standards of the\nday, unusually meritocratic.92\nThe Mamluk approach to the financing of government was considerably less\ninnovative, however. Like earlier Muslim states such as the Buyid Dynasty, the Mamluks\nruled through a decentralized, semi-feudal system based on iqta land grants. According\nto this arrangement, soldiers received the right to collect taxes over a defined territory;\nin exchange, they were obligated to provide military service to the state. To ensure a\ndegree of control over what was an intrinsically decentralized system, the Mamluk\ngovernment periodically redistributed or revoked iqtas. Initially, this practice proved\nreasonably effective at funding the military and government. As it had under the Buyids,\nhowever, the iqta system also imposed steep costs on Egypt\u2019s economy. The problem\nwas one of incentives. Aware that they would receive tax revenue from a given land\ngrant for only a brief period, iqta holders focused on squeezing as much wealth out of\ntheir peasant farmers as they could rather than on developing the infrastructure that\nwould foster long-term growth; over time, as a result, Egypt\u2019s once bountiful agricultural\nsector\u2014the heart of its economy\u2014began to stagnate.93\nIslamic Political Recovery and the End of the Crusades\nThe Muslim political revival that began with the victory at Ayn Jalut was not\nconfined to Egypt, but instead occurred throughout the Middle East. As we shall see in\nchapter six, new Muslim polities would emerge out of the wreckage of the Abbasid\nCaliphate and the Sultanate of Rum over the next few decades. Islamic rule even\nreturned to the territory ruled by the Mongol Ilkhanid Dynasty. The religion\u2019s revival\nthere began in 1295 when, for reasons of political expediency, the new khan, Mahmoud\nGhazan (r. 1295-1304), decided to abandon Buddhism in favor of Islam when he\nassumed the throne. Encouraged by the khan\u2019s conversion, nearly all of the Ilkhanid\nMongols followed suit over the next decade. As a result, by the time of Ghazan\u2019s death,\nthe Ilkhanate had completed a remarkable and shockingly fast transformation from\n92 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 157; Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 292.\n93 Amina Elbendary, Crowds and Sultans: Urban Protest in Late Medieval Egypt and\nSyria (Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 2015), 37; Lapidus, A History of\nIslamic Societies, 292. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 39\nexistential threat to Islamic rule into what was, for all practical purposes, just another\nMuslim state.94\nBy that point, meanwhile, Muslim principalities no longer needed to concern\nthemselves with the Franks. Shortly after Ayn Jalut, Baybars launched a sustained effort\naimed at eradicating the Crusader States. Planned and executed with great care, the\ncampaign against the Franks bore quick results. The Mamluks took Haifa by storm in\n1266, brutally sacked Antioch in 1268, and successfully assaulted Tripoli in 1289. In\neach case, they destroyed the port to prevent the Franks from using it to support future\nCrusades. The coup de grace came in 1291. That year, the Mamluks succeeded in\nbreeching the mighty walls of Acre, the lone remaining crusader city. Thus, after nearly\ntwo centuries, Western Christian control of territory in the Levant had come to an end.\nThe Crusades were over.95\nLegacy of the Crusades\nHow did two centuries of Christian control of the Levant affect the people\ninvolved? Put another way, what were the lasting consequences of the Crusades? In a\nword, their impact was complex\u2014affecting Europe and the Middle East in very different\nways in the short term while, in the long term, powerfully\u2014if ahistorically\u2014shaping\npresent-day perceptions of relations between the Middle East and the West.\nThe consequences of the Crusades for the Middle East and the West differed\nsubstantially. Unsurprisingly, they had a largely positive short-term impact on Western\nEurope. Indeed, many groups profited from the Crusades. Among them were the\nmerchants of the Italian city-states, who not only grew rich supplying Outremer but,\nironically, also developed valuable new trade connections with Muslim states thanks to\nthe Western presence in the Levant. As a result, even after the fall of Acre, they\ncontinued to prosper by supplying Europe with the imported eastern products and\ngoods that Westerners had first encountered as a result of the Crusades. Monarchs\nalso benefited. Taking advantage of the new authority and tax revenue that they had\nacquired to support crusading, a number of kings initiated multi-century-long campaigns\nto consolidate power that resulted in the emergence of the first genuinely centralized\nstates in Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. Finally,\nthe Crusades dramatically boosted the power of the Church. For a time, in fact, the\nCrusades turned the papacy into the most powerful political institution in Western\nEurope.96\nIn contrast, the Crusades produced little lasting political, economic, or cultural\nchange in the Muslim Middle East and quickly faded from collective memory. While this\nsituation may seem surprising today, it reflects the fact that the Crusades had at best a\nrelatively marginal impact on the people of the region. The Franks never managed to\n94 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 157\u201358.\n95 Hillenbrand, The Crusades, 227.\n96 Asbridge, The Crusades, 657\u201370; Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 149. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 40\nseize any of the region\u2019s leading cities, did not alter the social structure of the peoples\nthey controlled, and remained confined to a small, albeit religiously significant, strip of\nland. The limits of their influence on the Middle East are particularly clear when\ncontrasted to the enormous impact of the Mongol irruption. While the Ilkhanate\ndestroyed the Abbasid Caliphate, demolished the irrigation systems on which Iraq\u2019s\nagricultural productivity depended, and contributed to the intellectual and spiritual\nretrenchment of the Muslim world, the crusaders main legacy was a series of imposing\ncastles like Cracs des Chevaliers and, more significantly, a grievously weakened\nByzantine Empire.97\nPerversely, however, while the Crusades themselves were of only limited\nsignificance, popular understandings of them\u2014what the historian Christopher Tyerman\ncalls \u201cmythic memories\u201d\u2014continue to exert a powerful influence. Based on the\nahistorical works of nineteenth-century European writers rather than on the Crusades\nthemselves, these views are at best a caricature of the events they purport to describe.\nNonetheless, they long ago attained the status of conventional wisdom\u2014continuing to\ndetrimentally influence modern perceptions of relations between the Muslim Middle East\nand the West and to fuel belief in the notion that the two cultures are locked in a\nmillennia-long civilizational conflict.98\nModern Western historical memories of the Crusades originated largely with the\nideas of two influential, early-nineteenth century writers: Joseph-Francois Michaud\n(1767-1839) and Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832). An ardent French nationalist and\nproponent of imperialism, Michaud published an influential six-volume history of the\nCrusades, Histoires des Croisades, between 1812 and 1822. Removing the Crusades\nfrom their medieval context and stripping them of their penitential character, he recast\nthem as glorious ventures in which brave French knights enthusiastically spread the\nvirtues of France\u2019s superior culture to the people of the Middle East. Michaud thus\ntransformed the Crusades into an anachronistic, proto-imperialist venture\u2014in the\nprocess providing contemporary imperialists with the rhetorical ammunition needed to\njustify the acquisition of new colonies. Scott approached the Crusades in a very different\nbut equally inaccurate way. A popular novelist, he wrote a series of books set during the\ntime of the Crusades in which he developed two influential themes. First, he cast the\nFranks as brave but ignorant and uncultured louts who blundered violently into a\npeaceful and sophisticated Muslim world. Second, he described the Muslims\u2014above\nall, Salah ad-Din\u2014as people of vastly greater sophistication and culture than their crude\nand boorish European contemporaries.99\nTo the lament of many modern scholars, Michaud\u2019s celebratory construction and\nScott\u2019s more condemnatory one would establish the basis for contemporary Western\nhistorical memories of the Crusades. Michaud\u2019s positive interpretation cut multiple ways.\n97 Jonathan Riley-Smith, The Crusades, Christianity, and Islam (New York, NY:\nColumbia University Press, 2008), 70\u201371.\n98 Tyerman, Crusades, 136.\n99 Riley-Smith, The Crusades, Christianity, and Islam, 52\u201367. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 41\nOn the one hand, it gave colonialists a language that they could use to justify\nimperialism; on the other, his positive account of the Frankish invasion of the Holy Land\nspurred neo-Marxist scholars to subsequently develop a highly critical\u2014if also off\nbase\u2014interpretation of the Crusades as proto-imperialist undertakings. Meanwhile,\npopular portrayals of the Crusades such as Ridley Scott\u2019s film Kingdom of Heaven\n(2005)\u2014which sharply contrasts violent, ignorant Franks with urbane and cultured\nMuslims\u2014reflect the enduring legacy of Sir Walter Scott\u2019s critical interpretation of\ncrusading.100\nIronically, contemporary understandings of the Crusades in the Middle East stem\nlargely from the same sources. Prior to the late-nineteenth century, the Crusades were\nalmost-completely forgotten in the Middle East. With the Franks long-since defeated\nand with the Ottoman Empire having shifted the border between the Christian and\nMuslim worlds deep into Central Europe there was little reason to pay attention to them;\nas a result, popular memories of the Frankish incursions faded rapidly in the Middle\nEast. Beginning in the late-nineteenth century, however, the West reacquainted\nMuslims with the Crusades and, in the process, exposed them to the interpretations of\nMichaud and Scott that had come to predominate in Europe. The pivotal moment came\nat the very end of the nineteenth century. Inspired by Scott\u2019s books, Kaiser Wilhelm II\n(r. 1888-1918) solemnly laid a wreath at Salah ad-Din\u2019s tomb in Damascus in 1898\u2014an\nact that many scholars argue reintroduced the Kurdish leader to a Muslim world that\nhad all-but completely forgotten him.101\nExposed to Western constructions of the Crusades and to surging Western\nimperialism, Muslim thinkers soon synthesized Scott and Michaud\u2019s interpretations to\nform a new, critical understanding of the Crusades. It described the growing Western\nposition in the Middle East in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries not as a\nproduct of the modern era, but instead as a continuation of the Crusades of the Middle\nAges by the crusaders\u2019 equally violent descendants. Lent credence by the inaccurate\nassumption that this interpretation had been Muslim conventional wisdom dating to the\nthirteenth century rather than a recent construct imported from Europe, this new\ninterpretation soon became pervasive in the Middle East. It remains widespread today\nand has found particular appeal among antiimperialist Arab nationalists. As one writer\ndeclared in the 1930s, \u201cthe west is still waging crusading wars against Islam under the\nguise of political and economic imperialism.\u201d More recently, jihadis have drawn similar\nconclusions. Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), the so-called Godfather of Jihad, declared that\n100 Madden, The Concise History of the Crusades, 184\u201385; Riley-Smith, The Crusades,\nChristianity, and Islam, 66\u201367.\n101 Riley-Smith, The Crusades, Christianity, and Islam, 62\u201366; For a persuasive rebuttal\nto the idea that Salah ad-Din was forgotten in the Muslim world see Diana Abouali,\n\u201cSaladin\u2019s Legacy in the Middle East before the Nineteenth Century,\u201d Crusades 10\n(2011): 175\u201389; Note, though, that Paul Cobb, otherwise supportive of Abouali\u2019s\nargument, acknowledges that modern popular memories of him in the Middle East\nderive from European rather than Middle Eastern sources Cobb, The Race for Paradise,\n5. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 42\n\u201cWestern blood carries the spirit of the crusades within itself,\u201d for instance, while Osama\nbin Laden (1957-2011) maintained that conflict between the West and the Muslim world\nin the early twenty-first century was merely the latest skirmish in a far-older civilizational\nconflict.102\nThus, to the consternation of many scholars, the Muslim Middle East and the\nWest alike frame relations today on the basis of inaccurate and ahistorical conceptions.\nRather than locating the Crusades in the medieval culture to which they belonged,\npeople instead cling to anachronistic constructions based on nineteenth-century\npolemics. At times, these \u201cmythic memories,\u201d to borrow Tyerman\u2019s term again, lead\npeople to the ludicrous, as when Islamists describe Israel as a latter-day Crusader\nState. At others, they fuel talk of a clash of civilizations\u2014an idea that could prove\ndangerously self-fulfilling if it gains sufficient traction. More prosaically, historical\nmemories rooted in the writings of Michaud and Scott impel people in both the West and\nthe Muslim world to conclude incorrectly that contemporary conflicts between them lay\nrooted in a deep and unchangeable past, and thus fail to see that the origins of those\nissues lie firmly in the malleable present.103\nThe Historical Debate\nHistorians do not merely take issue with popular understandings of the Crusades\nbut also engage in vigorous debates among themselves over how the subject should be\nunderstood. The fact that the field continues to contest the meaning, origins, and\nconsequences of the Crusades is hardly surprising given their importance to Europe\u2019s\ninternal development and their enduring significance in shaping popular perceptions of\nmodern-day relations between the Middle East and the West. Two issues in particular\nhave long animated historians of the Crusades: explaining what caused Europeans to\nlaunch them and assessing whether the Muslim leaders who fought against the Franks\ndid so out of genuine religious conviction or out of a more cynical desire to win support\nagainst their rivals.\nFor much of the mid-twentieth century, most specialists argued that the Crusades\nwere the product of economic forces. Writing often from a neo-Marxist perspective, they\ncontended that class conflict and greed rather than idealism or devotion impelled people\nto go on crusade. For example, the French historian Georges Duby argued that\ncrusading had its origins in the growing popularity of primogeniture among the nobility of\neleventh-century Europe. In his view, the shift to that practice resulted in the creation of\na class of disgruntled, landless younger sons whose unmet aspirations produced\ndissension and instability. The Crusades were a solution to this problem. They exported\nthese unhappy and potentially dangerous young men to a place where they could\nacquire wealth and, more importantly\u2014ensuring in the process continued stability in\nEurope. Other historians have cast the Crusades as proto-imperialist expeditions\nclothed in false piety that succeeded in enriching Europe at the expense of the Middle\n102 Riley-Smith, The Crusades, Christianity, and Islam, 71\u201378.\n103 Tyerman, Crusades, 136; Riley-Smith, The Crusades, Christianity, and Islam, 72\u201373. Chapter Five: The Decline of the Arab Empire, 809-1300 Page 1 43\nEast. Amin Maalouf, for instance, has argued that the Crusades marked a watershed\nmoment for both the West and the Muslim world. For Europe, they were successful\ncolonialist ventures that initiated a sustained period of growth; for the Middle East, in\ncontrast, they marked the point at which the economy and culture began to stagnate.104\nFew historians today continue to argue that economic forces produced the\nCrusades. Drawing on new evidence that has shown that crusading was enormously\nexpensive and that European nobles had to finance their participation by selling\nproperties or mortgaging them at high interest rates, scholars now largely agree that\npeople went on crusade out of a genuine and deeply felt sense of piety rather than out\nof a desire to get rich. In similar fashion, historians now largely reject the view that the\nCrusades simultaneously enriched Europe and impoverished the Middle East. In recent\nyears, in fact, many scholars have flipped that interpretation on its head. The historian\nThomas Madden, for one, not only maintains that the Crusades \u201cconstituted a massive\ndrain on resources\u201d in Europe, but that the economy of the Middle East continued to\nthrive long after the demise of Outremer.105\nScholars have engaged in a parallel debate regarding the depth of Zengi, Nur ad-\nDin, and Salah ad-Din\u2019s dedication to eradicating Outremer. Most modern scholars are\nskeptical that the destruction of the Crusader States was the primary objective of\nleaders like Zengi. Indeed, many who study the Crusades now contend that\u2014jihadi\nrhetoric aside\u2014the apparent hostility of those leaders to the Franks reflected more a\ndesire to burnish their credentials in the Muslim world than a deep-seated commitment\nto holy war against the Crusader States. Noting that those leaders spent far more time\nwarring with rival Turkish princes than fighting the Christians, for instance, the scholars\nMalcolm Lyons and D. E. P. Jackson argue that Zengi and Nur ad-Din had little\ncommitment to driving the crusaders out of the region and used jihadi rhetoric largely to\nwin support for their personal and dynastic goals. In Lyons and Jackson\u2019s eyes, even\nSalah ad-Din\u2019s reconquest of Jerusalem reflected such objectives. They maintain that\nwhile his capture of the city certainly contributed to the weakening of the Crusader\nStates, it was aimed more at securing popular support for his campaigns against his\nMuslim rivals than at winning a holy war against the Franks.106\nOther scholars disagree with this line of reasoning. Challenging it directly, they\nargue that a leader\u2019s public utterances carried great weight in the medieval Middle East\nand thus reveal that individual\u2019s goals. While not denying that Salah ad-Din likely sought\nto expand his principality at the expense of his Muslim rivals, for example, the historian\nCarol Hillenbrand contends that his public embrace of jihad against the Crusader States\nwas ultimately of far-greater significance than his personal and dynastic ambitions.

What followed, however, was anything but an era of\nstability. The near-simultaneous fracturing of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, collapse of\nthe Seljuq Sultanate of Rum in 1243, and outright destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate\nin 1258 produced a massive power vacuum in the Middle East that neither the Mamluks\nnor the Ilkhanid Dynasty\u2014which itself fell apart in 1335\u2014could fill. Instead, it would be a\nnew state, the Ottoman Empire, established in western Anatolia by an obscure Turkish\nlord named Osman (r. 1299-1326) that would emerge to fill the political void. It is to the\nestablishment of this new empire, and to the creation of a similar state in Iran, the\nSafavid Empire, that we shall now turn.\n107 Hillenbrand, The Crusades, 186. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566\nFollowing the near-concurrent sack of Constantinople in 1204, collapse of the\nSeljuq Sultanate of Rum in 1243, and, especially, destruction of the caliphate in 1258,\nthe Middle East appeared to have fallen into complete disunity. While the Mamluks\ncontrolled Egypt and Syria and a rump Byzantine state held sway in far-western\nAnatolia and Constantinople, the rest of the region lay hopelessly divided among a vast\nnumber of squabbling principalities, statelets, and tribal confederations. Indeed, by\n1300, the stability and unity that had characterized the Middle East under the Abbasid\nDynasty had become little more than a distant memory\u2014one that seemed unlikely to\never again obtain in the region.\nBy the early sixteenth century, however, the situation had altered dramatically.\nBy that point, two large states had emerged to divide the region between them: the\npowerful Safavid Empire that dominated Iran, and the mighty Ottoman Empire that\ncontrolled Anatolia, the Levant, Egypt, Iraq, and the Hejaz, as well as North Africa,\nSoutheastern Europe, and the Black Sea littoral. What accounted for this dramatic\ngeopolitical restructuring? What characteristics did these new empires have that\npermitted them to avoid the chronic instability that marked nearly all other contemporary\nstates in the region?\nIn the mid-to-late twentieth century, the historians Marshall Hodgson and William\nMcNeill provided a persuasive and widely accepted answer to these questions. These\nscholars located the success of these new states\u2014as well as the similar Mughal Empire\nin India\u2014in their adoption of a novel system of interrelated administrative and military\npractices. Dubbing these states \u201cgunpowder empires,\u201d Hodgson and McNeill maintained\nthat they were able to overcome the volatility that plagued other late-medieval Muslim\nstates by centralizing political power, by creating and maintaining efficient\nbureaucracies able to raise substantial revenue, and, most importantly, by establishing\nregional monopolies over the use of firearms. Enormously powerful, these innovative\nconquest states dominated the Muslim world and, in the case of the Ottoman Empire,\nconstituted a serious and ongoing threat to the security and independence of Christian\nEurope in the early-modern period.1\nThe Ottoman Rise to Power\nOrigins of the Ottoman Empire, 1299-1326\nThe Ottoman Empire emerged out of the anarchic situation that the sudden\ncollapse of the political order in Asia Minor had created.

Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 46\nSeljuq Sultanate of Rum in 1243, numerous small, competing principalities called\nbeyliks had emerged in Turkish-controlled central and eastern Asia Minor. Each of\nthese statelets took shape around a Turkish warlord who held the rank of bey\u2014the\nlowest Turkish noble title. That the men who ruled these states possessed titles may\nsuggest that the beyliks existed within a larger political arrangement or that their leaders\nenjoyed a degree of legitimacy conferred by a central government; such was most\ncertainly not the case. On the contrary, this was a highly competitive and unstructured\nsystem wherein the power and status of a bey derived not from his title or from the\nlegitimation that a respected authority might grant, but instead from his raw military\ntalents and concomitant ability to attract followers. Those beys who could provide\nprotection to peasants and merchants and who could lead frontier warriors called akinjis\non successful raids gained subjects and saw their beyliks grow; those who could not\nsuffered a decline in power as their followers deserted them in favor of their more\neffective rivals.2\nThe Ottoman Empire owed its start\u2014and its name\u2014to one of these beys,\nOsman I (r. 1299-1326). Osman I may have inherited a title and a tiny beylik from his\nfather, but his success derived far more from his innate charisma, foresight, and\nremarkable leadership skills than from his patrimony. A military commander with the\ncunning to win battles and a lord with the wisdom to keep taxes low and predictable, he\npossessed all of the attributes needed to win supporters and territory at the expense of\nthe less-successful and less-dynamic lords who controlled adjoining beyliks.3\nAs important, Osman I also had the savvy and talent to take full advantage of his\nprincipality\u2019s serendipitous location adjacent to the Byzantine Empire\u2019s remaining\nholdings in Asia Minor. The empire offered an almost perfect combination of wealth and\nweakness. On the one hand, its Anatolian possessions were endowed with rich\npasturage, productive farmland, and small-but-important cities such as Bursa,\nNicomedia and Nicaea. On the other, thanks to the more immediate threat that Western\nstates such as Venice posed, Constantinople was compelled to deploy the bulk of its\nlimited military forces to safeguard the empire\u2019s European territories and was thus\nunable to spare any more than a tiny fraction of its already small army for the defense of\nits Anatolian holdings. As a result, those valuable possessions were isolated,\nvulnerable, and ripe for the picking.4\nOsman I built both his state and his reputation by preying on the empire.\nGrasping the weakness of its position in Anatolia, he launched attacks against it almost\nimmediately upon taking power. He began by boldly besieging the former imperial\ncapital of Nicaea. While he was unsuccessful in taking the city, his victory over a\nByzantine relief army in the Battle of Bapheus in 1302 earned him a reputation as a\n2 Douglas Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals\n(Boulder: Westview Press, 2011), 34\u201335.\n3 Caroline Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire (New York:\nBasic Books, 2005), 7\u20138.\n4 Finkel, 7\u20138. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 47\nsuccessful military commander among the Turks of Asia Minor and drew large numbers\nof akinjis to his banner.5\nIn desperation, Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus (r. 1282-1328), responded by\nhiring a mercenary group, the Grand Catalan Company, to defend the territory in\nAnatolia that Osman I threatened. This move proved to be a poor one. While the\nmercenaries initially won several engagements against the Turks, they soon abandoned\nthe war in favor of plundering the Greek peasants of the region. As a result, by the time\nthe company had departed from Anatolia, many Byzantine subjects in the area had\neither fled across the strait to Constantinople or had come to accommodate themselves\nto Turkish rule.6\nOsman I was quick to take advantage. Strengthened by his acquisition of new\nterritory and subjects, He exploited the disarray that the Grand Catalan Company had\ncreated to launch annual raids into Byzantine territory. These attacks netted substantial\nloot, which drew yet more fighters to his cause. They in turn gave Osman I the strength\nfirst to gradually seize the Byzantine Empire\u2019s remaining rural land in western Asia\nMinor and then, around 1320, to lay siege to Bursa. Well-fortified and supplied, the city\nproved to be beyond the power of Osman I\u2019s warriors and managed to hold out through\nhis death in 1326. Still, this setback aside, he had achieved a great deal. He had\ndramatically expanded his beylik, won a large following of akinjis, and, perhaps most\nimportantly, had given his embryonic dynasty the imprimatur of success.7\nEarly Expansion, 1326-1402\nOsman I\u2019s son and successor, Orhan (r. 1326-1362), proved to be every bit as\ncapable and ambitious a leader as his father had been. Building on the stable\nfoundation he inherited, Orhan skillfully transformed his beylik into a major power in\nwestern Anatolia. Like Osman I, he did so largely by exploiting Byzantine weakness. He\nbegan his reign by successfully concluding the siege of Bursa that Osman I had started.\nHe followed by recruiting nearby Turkish beys to help him undertake an ambitious effort\nto overrun Byzantium\u2019s remaining territory in Asia Minor. This long and ultimately\nsuccessful campaign was of enormous significance for Orhan. It not only resulted in the\nexpansion of his state and its tax base but, perhaps more importantly, also elevated him\nabove the nearby beys and thus gave him the prestige needed to start reducing those\nleaders to the status of Ottoman vassals.8\nIn doing so, Orhan pioneered what would become the dynasty\u2019s customary\napproach to acquiring territory. This process involved two steps. First, the Ottomans\nreduced defeated rivals or dependent principalities to vassalage. Then, after the people\n5 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 34\u201335.\n6 Rudi Paul Lindner, Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia (Bloomington:\nResearch Institute for Inner Asian Studies, 1983), 25\u201327.\n7 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 8, 12\u201313.\n8 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 35\u201336.

Minimizing the number of revolts during the early years of\nimperial oversight, this two-step progression proved to be a shrewd and highly\nsuccessful strategy\u2014one that the dynasty would employ to great effect over the next\ntwo centuries.9\nOrhan had been enormously successful, but his territorial acquisitions had also\nproduced a growing problem for his state. Put simply, the crude system of government\nthat he had inherited was not appropriate for the changed circumstances of his beylik.\nNow encompassing a large territory of predominantly settled rather than nomadic\npeople, his state required a far-more complex and sophisticated system of government\nthan the one based on interpersonal relationships that he had inherited from his father.\nAccordingly, after he took Bursa, he sought to establish a simple bureaucracy to\nadminister his state and, more importantly, to manage the collection of taxes. But who\nwould organize and staff this bureaucracy? After all, neither the akinjis he surrounded\nhimself with nor the peasants who constituted the majority of his subjects had the\nexperience and knowledge needed to establish and run a complex administration.10\nUnable to secure suitable candidates within his beylik, Orhan decided to look\nelsewhere for bureaucrats. He found them among the Sunni religious scholars of\nAnatolia. Promising them that they would have the power to shape and manage his\nstate, he succeeded in persuading a number of \u02bfulama\u02be to relocate to Bursa. This move\nproved to be a smart one for the Ottoman leader. Drawing on centuries of well-\ndeveloped Islamic political theory and practice, the religious scholars he recruited\nquickly established a crude-but-effective bureaucratic structure that was capable of\nproviding him with the efficient administration and steady tax collection that his growing\nstate required.11\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the decision to rely on \u02bfulama\u02be to run the government\nhad important if-unintended consequences for the practice of religion in Orhan\u2019s state.\nTo that point, the Ottomans had followed an unconventional brand of Islam that\nincorporated folk variants of Sunnism and Sufism into a syncretic blend of Christianity\nand Islam\u2014a mix that made Orhan\u2019s beylik a welcoming place for people from a variety\nof backgrounds. Adherence to these heterodox religious practices began to ebb with the\narrival of the \u02bfulama\u02be, however. Under their influence, Orhan and a number of his\nfollowers started to gradually abandon the loose approach to religion that they had\nheretofore followed in favor of an embrace of orthodox Sunnism. As we shall see, this\nshift would gradually accelerate under his successors.12\nOrhan also began the process of transforming the Ottoman military from one that\nconsisted exclusively of nomadic frontier warriors into a more balanced force that\n9 Streusand, 79\u201380.\n10 Lindner, Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia, 6\u20138.\n11 Lindner, 6\u20138.\n12 Lindner, 6\u20138. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 49\nincluded a substantial contingent of infantry. The key event that drove him to make this\nchange was the siege of Bursa. Orhan learned from his early failed efforts to take the\ncity that the akinjis\u2019 independence, lack of discipline and, most importantly, need to\nsecure pasturage for their horses meant that he could not concentrate his forces for a\nlong-enough duration to reduce fortified places through siege. Accordingly, he\nestablished the yaya infantry to facilitate such operations. Based not on the nomads\nwho continued to make up the bulk of his fighters but instead on settled recruits, this\nnew force was able to maintain the tight blockades required to compel fortified places to\ncapitulate. Over time, the yaya and other new types of troops would gradually supplant\nthe nomads as the core of the evermore sophisticated and centrally directed Ottoman\nmilitary.13\nDuring the final decade of his reign, Orhan focused on a new and ambitious goal:\nexpanding across the Dardanelles Strait into the Byzantine Empire\u2019s European territory.\nIronically, his troops first crossed the strait not as invaders but instead as the invited\nallies of the Byzantine Emperor John V Cantacuzenus (r. 1347-1354), who was then\nlocked in one of the many bitter civil wars that dominated Byzantium\u2019s internal affairs\nduring much of the fourteenth century. Orhan\u2019s troops helped the emperor defeat his\nrival; in the process, however, they also seized control of the important port of Gallipoli\non the European side of the Dardanelles Strait. Now in possession of a secure base in\nthe Balkans, Orhan wasted no time in gobbling up the Byzantine Empire\u2019s European\nterritory culminating with the seizure of the important city of Edirne in 1361. Now ruling\nsubstantial holdings in both Europe and Asia Minor, he had vaulted far ahead of the\nbeys that had been his peers only a few years earlier. Accordingly, Orhan assumed a\nnew title that was more in keeping with his newfound stature and power: sultan.14\nOrhan\u2019s son and successor, Murad I (r. 1362-1389), built on his father\u2019s success.\nHe began his reign by relocating the capital from Bursa to Edirne so that he could more\neasily coordinate Ottoman efforts to expand into the weak and divided Balkans.\nConcurrently, he dramatically accelerated Orhan\u2019s effort to remake the government from\nan informal one geared primarily to ruling a small nomadic principality into a highly\ncentralized apparatus capable of administering a large, sedentary, multiethnic empire.\nHe was quite successful in this effort. Indeed, more than any other Ottoman leader, it\nwas Murad I who was responsible for establishing the basic structure of the Ottoman\nstate.15\nThe new sultan also made a profoundly consequential change to the Ottoman\nmilitary. Intent on reducing the power of the Turkish vassals on whom Orhan had\ndepended for much of his military force, Murad I established a new formation of slave\nsoldiers called Janissaries or \u201cnew troops.\u201d Tightly disciplined and highly loyal, these\nelite soldiers would be all-but unbeatable over the next three centuries and would prove\n13 Lindner, 30\u201332.\n14 Jason Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire (New York:\nHenry Holt and Company, 1998), 14\u201315.\n15 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 17, 20. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 50\ncritical in giving the Ottomans the strength to gradually end the independence of the\nother beyliks.16\nIn the immediate term, Murad I used them to great effect in his campaign to\nsolidify the empire\u2019s control over the southern Balkans. That effort began with a great\ntriumph over a coalition of Serbian and Bulgarian lords in 1371 on the Maritsa River.\nThe victory permitted the sultan to take control of all of Macedonia and to turn his\ndefeated opponents into Ottoman vassals. Two years later, he similarly reduced the\nByzantine Empire to vassalage\u2014surely a difficult pill for the heirs of the caesars to\nswallow. Finally, in 1389, he invaded Serbia to retaliate for the defeat of a small\nOttoman army there a year earlier. Though Murad I died in the fighting, the Battle of\nKosovo that marked the climax of the campaign proved to be a stunning Ottoman\ntriumph and a battle of enormous significance. In the immediate term, the victory over a\ncombined Serbian, Kosovan, and Bosnian army established the Ottomans as the now-\nunquestioned masters of the southern Balkans. The battle\u2019s long-term consequences\nwere less tangible but equally important. As we shall see in chapter eight, nineteenth-\ncentury Serbian nationalists would reinterpret their forebears\u2019 defeat as a noble sacrifice\nagainst an unbeatable enemy and would, in so doing, transform the Battle of Kosovo\ninto the central myth of modern nationalist conceptions of Serbian identity.17\nRetrenchment and Recovery, 1402-1451\nMurad I\u2019s successor, Bayezid I (r. 1389-1402), enjoyed a spectacular if ultimately\nunsuccessful reign as sultan. Dubbed Yidirim, or the lightning bolt, due to the quick\npace of his conquests, he focused on rapidly and massively expanding the size of the\nempire. In the Balkans, he formally annexed Bulgaria as far as the Danube River,\ninitiated a long siege of Constantinople, and, at the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, crushed\na large army of crusaders sent to check his rising power. In Asia Minor, meanwhile, he\nwaged a series of campaigns against rival Turkish states, gained territory through\nmarriage, and, importantly, assumed direct control of a number of beyliks heretofore\nruled by vassals. By 1400, as a result, the empire had become a major power\u2014one that\nthoroughly dominated the northern Balkans and completely controlled western and\ncentral Anatolia.18\nImpressive as Bayezid I\u2019s achievements were, however, they ultimately proved\nephemeral. Ironically, it was his aggressive campaign of territorial acquisition and\npolitical consolidation that proved to be his undoing. By abandoning his predecessors\u2019\nmore cautious, two-step approach to expansion, he created enormous dissension\namong the recently deposed beys of Asia Minor. Intent on recovering their thrones, they\nappealed for assistance to Timur (r. 1370-1405)\u2014known in the West as Tamerlane\u2014\n16 Douglas A. Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2017), 19.\n17 Donald Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, Second Edition (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2005), 20.\n18 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 25\u201328. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 51\nthe powerful sultan of the short-lived Timurid Dynasty that dominated Central Asia and\nIran. Eager to cut down a rising rival, Timur was only too happy to oblige. In 1401, he\nlured Bayezid I into a confrontation by invading Anatolia. In the Battle of Ankara that\ntook place the following year, he decisively defeated the Ottoman army\u2014in the process,\ncapturing and deposing Bayezid I.19\nDespite the scale of his victory, Timur did not assume control of the Ottoman\nEmpire or oversee its dismemberment. Instead, he imposed two significant changes the\nsultanate designed to permanently weaken it. First, he reduced the power of the empire\nby restoring the Anatolian beys that Bayezid I had deposed. Second, he restructured\nthe Ottoman government along traditional, nomadic lines by imposing on it the\nappanage model of collective rule to which the Mongols and Seljuq Turks had adhered.\nIn keeping with that system, he divided the Ottoman territories among three of Bayezid\nI\u2019s sons, Sul\u00ebiman, Isa, and Mehmet I (r. 1413-1421).20\nThe subsequent outbreak of a long, bitter civil war between the brothers gave the\nChristian rulers of the Balkans a much-needed respite. Not only did the Ottomans\u2019\ninternal struggle put the wars of conquest on hold, but it also spurred the brothers to\nadopt conciliatory diplomatic strategies toward the Christian states in hopes of\ndissuading them from intervening. Emblematic of their new approach were Sul\u00ebiman\u2019s\nentreaties. Eager to concentrate on defeating his brothers without fear of Western\naction against him, he freed the Byzantine Empire from vassalage and granted the\nVenetians and Genoese important commercial rights. These concessions were\nsubstantial, and they made plain that the balance of power in the region had shifted\ndramatically against the Ottomans. Indeed, as the fighting between the brothers neared\nits tenth anniversary, it appeared to Christian leaders such as Byzantine Emperor\nManuel II Palaeologus (r. 1391-1425) that the Ottoman threat had not merely crested\nbut had begun to recede.21\nThey were mistaken. The empire did not continue to weaken, but instead\nexperienced a rapid recovery following Mehmet I\u2019s victory in the civil war. His triumph\nover his brothers was a product of his shrewdness and patience as a leader. Rather\nthan going for a knock-out blow early in the conflict, he smartly hung back and let his\nbrothers weaken themselves fighting each other before he stepped in to pick up the\npieces. As a result, he emerged victorious in 1413\u2014the sole survivor and, from that\npoint, the uncontested ruler of the Ottoman Empire.22\nHe, and his son and successor, Murad II (r. 1421-1451), spent the next four\ndecades overseeing the Ottoman recovery. Each faced significant challenges that\ncomplicated that effort. Between them, they had to deal with the Venetian-supported\n19 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 41.\n20 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 38.\n21 Steven Runciman, The Fall of Constantinople 1453 (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1965), 43.\n22 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 41\u201342. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 52\nrevolt of yet another brother, a large uprising organized by the popular Sufi leader\nSheikh Bedreddin (1359-1420), the continued efforts of the Anatolian beys to retain the\nautonomy that Timur had granted them, and Christian attacks aimed at weakening the\nempire\u2019s grip on the Balkans. These were serious threats, and they greatly complicated\ntheir efforts to restore the dynasty to the position it had occupied on the eve of Timur\u2019s\nvictory over Bayezid I. Mehmet I and Murad II were up to the challenge, however. Using\na combination of skillful diplomacy and brute force, they not only successfully\nreestablished control of the Balkans but also fully reasserted sultanic authority over the\nbeys of western and central Asia Minor. As a result, by the time of Murad II\u2019s death in\n1451, the dynasty had regained the position it had held in 1402 and stood poised to\nbecome a dominant power in both Europe and the Middle East.23\nOttoman Dominance, 1451-1566\nMehmet II\nBefore the Ottoman state could make that leap, however, it first needed to\ncomplete the destruction of the Byzantine Empire and, most importantly, to acquire its\nlone remaining city: Constantinople. Laying at the very heart of the Ottomans\u2019\nexpanding realm, the city was essential to the sultanate\u2019s continued success. Control of\nit would give the empire complete dominance of the lucrative trade between the Black\nSea and the Mediterranean and would ease communications between its European and\nAsian holdings. Successfully reducing the city also promised to dramatically enhance\nthe standing of the sultan. Muslim tradition had long attached eschatological\nsignificance to Constantinople, holding that the person who conquered it would be the\nMahdi: the expected one who would usher in the end of history. The sultan who finally\nsucceeded in taking it would thus not merely reap the material benefits attendant in the\npossession of such a fabulously well-located city but would also see his prestige and\nlegitimacy dramatically enhanced.24\nIt was these less-tangible benefits that lay behind the new Sultan, Mehmet II\u2019s (r.\n1451-1481) bid to take Constantinople early in his reign. He could certainly have stood\na boost to his political standing at that time. Only nineteen-years old when he acceded\nto the throne, he confronted whispered questions in the court and the army about his\nwisdom and capacity for leadership. Worse, many of the Turkish beys whom his father\nhad only recently reduced to vassalage were scheming with the independent Turkish\nstate of Karaman to take advantage of his tenuous grip on power to regain their\nindependence. These were serious challenges\u2014ones that Mehmet II concluded he\nwould be unable to deal with unless he quickly legitimated his rule through a great\nvictory. Accordingly, over the objections of his powerful and long-serving grand vizier,\n23 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 38\u201339;\nFinkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 33\u201338.\n24 Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes (New\nYork, NY: PublicAffairs, 2009), 175. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 53\nCandarli Halil Pasha (?-1453), he ordered the Ottoman army to lay siege to the city\nbeginning in April 1453.25\nDespite the fact that the sultanate\u2019s powerful military massively outnumbered the\nByzantine defenders, taking the city was far from a foregone conclusion. Ringed by the\nmassive, millennia-old triple Walls of Theodosius and able to bring in food by ship owing\nto its location on the Bosporus Strait, Constantinople had famously withstood over a\ndozen sieges including recent ones undertaken by Bayezid I, Mehmet I, and Murad II.\nUndeterred, Mehmet II directed a well-thought-out campaign to reduce the city. First, he\nordered the erection of a castle along the Bosporus Strait called Rumeli Hisari\u2014\nmeaning \u201cStrait Cutter\u201d\u2014from which cannons could interdict the shipment of food to the\ncity. Second, and more importantly, he authorized the construction of a new type of\ncannon called a bombard that was designed to destroy the city\u2019s walls. Gunpowder\nweapons were already centuries old, and smaller cannons had been commonplace in\nthe region for decades. What made the bombards that Mehmet II had commissioned\ndifferent was the fact that they were of an entirely unprecedented scale. Cast by a\nHungarian metallurgist named Urban, the largest one had a twenty-eight-foot-long\nbarrel and could fire a 1,300-pound granite projectile as far as a mile.26\nStill, even with these awesome weapons, besieging the city was a risky bid on\nthe sultan\u2019s part. In effect, he was gambling that he could do with his bombards what no\nprevious attacker had managed to accomplish: smash down the Walls of Theodosius\nand occupy the city. Were he to succeed, he would have the legitimacy to deal with\nthose who challenged him; were he to fail, he would instead almost certainly be\ndeposed and killed.27\nMehmet II\u2019s bet paid off. Over the course of April and May 1453, his bombards\nsystematically battered down a substantial section of the city\u2019s walls. Finally, on May 29,\nthe Ottoman army charged through the rubble. Vastly outnumbering the demoralized\ndefenders, they quickly occupied the city. It was a momentous victory. Not only did it\nmark the first time in history that cannons had succeeded in taking a major walled city,\nbut it also dramatically raised Mehmet II\u2019s political standing. Known ever after as \u201cthe\nConqueror,\u201d he now had the prestige needed to remake the empire and to complete the\nconsolidation of power that his predecessors had begun.28\nHe began with a concerted effort to transform Constantinople\u2014or, as the Turks\ncalled it, Istanbul--into a suitable capital for a great empire. This task promised to be a\ndifficult one. Severely depopulated by the outbreak of the Black Death in 1347 and\nimpoverished by its economic decline during the terminal decades of the Byzantine\nEmpire, Constantinople was as much a ruin as an urban center at the time of the\nOttoman conquest. Undaunted, Mehmet II moved aggressively to restore it to its former\n25 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 45\u201349.\n26 Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 32.\n27 Goodwin, 32.\n28 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 32. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 54\nsplendor. He poured vast amounts of money into the city\u2019s reconstruction and swelled\nits population by successfully encouraging whole communities to relocate to it. He also\nmoved to link the Ottoman Empire to the city and its glorious imperial past by turning the\nHagia Sophia\u2014its greatest cathedral and a literal edifice of Roman authority\u2014into a\nmosque. Finally, he relocated his government to the newly constructed Topkapi Palace,\na magnificent administrative center and royal residence in Constantinople that\noverlooked the Bosporus Strait. These initiatives effected a startlingly rapid recovery.\nWithin just a few short decades, the city was once again one of the world\u2019s great\nadministrative, cultural, and commercial centers\u2014one that both tied the empire together\nand ensured its control over the main trade routes of the Black Sea and eastern\nMediterranean.29\nConcurrently, Mehmet II used the newfound prestige and wealth he had acquired\nthrough the conquest of Constantinople to complete the centralization of the Ottoman\ngovernment\u2014known thereafter as the Sublime Porte\u2014that his predecessors had\nbegun. He first acted by purging high-ranking officials whose fealty he doubted. Most\nnotably, just three days after his troops had stormed Constantinople, he ordered his\nheretofore powerful grand vizier, Halil Pasha, executed. He followed by replacing\nunreliable officials with Christian converts to Islam who were, as such, dependent on the\nsultan and thus loyal. Indeed, of the six grand viziers who succeeded Halil Pasha, five\nwere Christian-born men who had adopted Islam.30\nMeanwhile, he also effected a series of important symbolic changes designed to\nenhance his and his successors\u2019 authority following his victory at Constantinople. The\nmost important of these involved the transformation of the position of sultan from that of\na first-among-equals who, like Osman, ate and socialized with his soldiers, into an aloof,\nnear-divine figure who stood apart from his subjects as the embodiment of power and\ndignity. In keeping with this new approach, Mehmet II ceased running or even attending\nthe four-times-per-week imperial council meetings with his viziers; instead, he observed\nthem from behind a curtained grill called the Eye of the Sultan.31\nThough he focused a great deal of attention on reforming his government,\nMehmet II did not neglect the traditional Ottoman pursuit of territorial expansion. Here,\ntoo, he enjoyed enormous success. He assumed direct control over Serbia, reduced\nBosnia and Herzegovina to vassalage, seized the remaining Byzantine successor states\nin Greece, and annexed the troublesome Turkish Karaman principality. He also\nsuccessfully besieged the strategic Genoese trading center of Caffa on the Crimean\nPeninsula; in the process, he not only gained control of this valuable commercial city but\nalso reduced the region\u2019s powerful Turkish Tatar nomads to vassals. Finally, he set off\n29 Marie-Janine Calic, The Great Cauldron: A History of Southeastern Europe, trans.\nElizabeth Janik (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2019), 72\u201373.\n30 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 75\u201376.\n31 Finkel, 67\u201380. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 55\nalarm bells in the West when he briefly seized the city of Otranto on the heel of the\nItalian peninsula in 1480.32\nSelim I\nFor reasons we will explore presently, Mehmet II\u2019s successor, Bayezid II (r. 1481-\n1512), focused largely on consolidating his father\u2019s gains and did not acquire substantial\nterritory. In contrast, the next sultan, Selim I (r. 1512-1520), returned with a vengeance\nto the traditional Ottoman pursuit of expansion. His initial conquests came in response\nto a new menace that the empire confronted at the start of his reign: the establishment\nand growth of the powerful Safavid Dynasty in Iran. Its emergence had substantially and\nadversely altered the power dynamics on the Ottoman Empire\u2019s eastern frontier and\nposed a serious danger to the sultanate\u2019s security. The Safavid threat took two forms.\nFirst, the Iranian state possessed a powerful military that constituted a direct menace to\nthe Ottoman Empire\u2019s control of eastern Asia Minor. Second, and more dangerously,\nthe Safavids articulated a populist Shi\u02bfi ideology that encouraged the nomadic Turkmen\nof far-eastern Anatolia to resist the sultanate\u2019s ongoing effort to impose direct control on\nthem.33\nWhile Bayezid II had taken a cautious approach to the Safavid Empire, Selim I\ninstead adopted an aggressive policy toward it aimed at ending the threat it posed to the\nOttoman Empire once and for all. He began by brutally suppressing the Turkmen\u2014\nsources claim that he executed as many as 40,000 prisoners\u2014after which he invaded\nIranian territory. It was a risky but ultimately successful maneuver. Owing substantially\nto the fact that the Safavids had not yet adopted gunpowder weapons, the Ottomans\nwon a decisive victory in the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514; as a result, the Safavid military\nthreat faded, and the Turkmen quickly\u2014if grudgingly\u2014came to accept Ottoman rule.34\nEmboldened, Selim I followed by moving against the Mamluks. Doing so proved\nfar trickier than going to war with the Safavids owing to the fact that the Mamluks\u2014like\nthe Ottomans\u2014adhered to Sunnism. This fact proved to be a problem for many of the\nsultan\u2019s troops. Leery of fighting their fellow Sunnis, they made clear that they would not\ntake part in a campaign against the Mamluks. Selim I dealt with this challenge by\nasserting that the Mamluks had been aiding the Shi\u02bfi Safavids and were thus not good\nSunnis. Though the evidence for collaboration between the regimes in Egypt and Iran\nwas wafer thin, his claim was sufficient to quell dissent in the ranks and to permit him to\ngo forward with the invasion. The resulting campaign was an overwhelming success.\nOnce more facing an enemy that was literally outgunned\u2014the Mamluks had only\nrecently and tentatively embraced firearms\u2014Selim I\u2019s army seized Syria by winning a\ndecisive victory at the Battle of Marj Dabik near Aleppo in 1516.

Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 56\nfollowing year finished the Mamluk state and permitted Selim I to add Egypt and the\nHejaz to his now much-enlarged empire.35\nSelim I\u2019s military success against the Mamluks did not merely add territory and\nsubjects or enhance his political standing but also profoundly altered the character and\nidentity of the empire. It did so in two ways. First, the acquisition of Syria and Egypt\ntransformed what had been a Muslim-ruled but Christian-majority empire into one in\nwhich Sunnis predominated. More importantly, the triumph over the Mamluks gave the\nOttomans possession of Mecca and Medina and thus made the sultans the protectors of\nthe Holy Places. Selim I and his successors were quick to grasp that their newfound\nstatus as the protectors of the Holy Cities promised to greatly enhance their legitimacy\nin the eyes of their now-majority Sunni subjects\u2014but only if the dynasty adhered\nscrupulously to orthodox Sunni beliefs and practices. Accordingly, from that point\nforward, the Ottomans presented the empire as the leading Sunni Muslim state and\nacted to legitimate their rule through the promotion and embrace of traditional Sunnism.\nIn this way, the shift from heterodoxy to orthodox Sunnism that had begun under Orhan\nreached its culmination.36\nSelim I\u2019s conquests also dramatically altered the Ottoman state\u2019s foreign policy\nand its perception of the sultanate\u2019s role in world affairs. Control of Egypt, the Hijaz, and\nSyria turned what had been an empire of great regional significance in Anatolia and\nsoutheastern Europe into a truly global power\u2014a three-continent behemoth that\ndominated all its frontiers. In response, the dynasty began to adopt a more-coherent,\nglobal strategy in its relations with other state.37\nSul\u00ebiman the Magnificent\nThis global approach was evident in the reign of Selim I\u2019s successor, Sul\u00ebiman\n(r. 1520-1566). Known as the Magnificent in the West and as the Lawgiver in the\nMuslim world, Sul\u00ebiman pursued a complex, global grand strategy that saw the empire\nreach dizzying new heights. In Europe and the Mediterranean, he sought consolidation\nand security. To achieve those ends, he began his reign by taking two fortresses that\nhad defied Mehmet II: the city of Belgrade, which had blocked the Ottomans from\nexpanding into Central Europe, and Rhodes, an island that had long served as a base\nfor piracy against Ottoman shipping. He followed with a crushing triumph at the Battle of\nMohacs in 1526 that turned Hungary into an Ottoman-controlled buffer state. Three\nyears later, he solidified his position in Central Europe by easily defeating Habsburg\nEmperor Charles V\u2019s (r. 1519-1556) attempt to retake Hungary and by briefly besieging\nVienna, the capital of Habsburg Austria. Finally, taking advantage of an alliance he had\nstruck with Charles V\u2019s dynastic rival, French King Francis I (r. 1515-1547), Sul\u00ebiman\nwas able to complete the conquest of Algeria in the 1530s. Thus, by the time of his\n35 Finkel, 106\u20139.\n36 Calic, The Great Cauldron, 76\u201377.\n37 Calic, 76\u201377. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 57\ndeath in 1566, the Ottoman Empire had fully secured its position in both Central Europe\nand the Mediterranean.38\nSul\u00ebiman\u2019s strategy in the Indian Ocean was less successful. In that region, he\nsought a largely defensive goal: the preservation of Ottoman commercial dominance\nfrom growing European competition. Direct Western involvement in the Indian Ocean\nwas a recent and troubling phenomenon for the Ottomans. In 1498, the Portuguese\nmariner Vasco da Gama (c. 1460s-1524) had arrived in Calicut, India after a long,\nperilous voyage around the Cape of Good Hope\u2014inaugurating, in the process, the first\ndirect connection between the spice-growing regions of South and Southeast Asia and\nthe markets of Europe. It was a major commercial and nautical accomplishment.\nHowever, the Portuguese were not content merely to establish this link or even to hold a\nmonopoly on the direct trade between Europe and the Indian Ocean. Instead, they\nfollowed da Gama\u2019s voyage with a shrewdly designed campaign to assume a dominant\nposition over long-distance trade in the east. They seized control of key bottlenecks\nsuch as the Strait of Malacca in Southeast Asia, the Bab el-Mandem Strait at the\nopening to the Red Sea, and the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and\nthen used their command of those passages to deny competitors access to the Indian\nOcean\u2019s sea lanes. It was a savvy if hard-ball strategy, and it helped to turn Portugal\ninto a serious threat to the Ottoman Empire\u2019s commercial position.39\nThe sultan\u2019s government responded with a complex, two-stage military campaign\ndesigned to eject the Portuguese from the Indian Ocean. Launched in the 1530s, its first\nphase was a success. Ottoman armies established control over Yemen as a preliminary\nstep for an assault on Portugal\u2019s bases near the Bab el-Mandem Strait and took control\nof Iraq and the strategic port of Basra from the Safavids in preparation for a move aimed\nat driving the Portuguese from the Strait of Hormuz. The second phase was far-less\nsuccessful, however. Despite launching coordinated assaults on Portuguese forts at the\nmouth of the Red Sea, at Hormuz, and even at key locations in India, Ottoman forces\nproved unable to overcome determined resistance. As a result, Sul\u00ebiman had to\nabandon the effort to force the Portuguese out of the region in favor of a diplomatic\napproach that ended with the two parties agreeing to respect each other\u2019s trade\ninterests in the Indian Ocean.40\nDespite his lack of success in countering Portugal\u2019s commercial threat,\nSul\u00ebiman\u2019s reign is widely acknowledged as the high point of the Ottoman Dynasty. And\nwhat a zenith it was. Fiscally, the empire occupied an enviable position thanks to its\nrobust agricultural economy, control of lucrative long-distance trade routes, and efficient\nsystem of tax collection. In the realm of religion, the dynasty enjoyed tremendous\nlegitimacy and authority in the Muslim world owing to its embrace of orthodox Sunni\n38 Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 85\u201388.\n39 Peter Frankopan, The Silk Roads: A New History of the World (New York: Knopf,\n2015), 214\u201325; Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 128\u201329.\n40 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 48\u201350;\nFinkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 128\u201329.

Militarily, its mighty Janissary\nregiments were universally regarded as the most formidable formations in existence.\nGeopolitically, finally, the empire had no peer on the global stage. It controlled the\nMiddle East and North Africa, had turned the eastern Mediterranean and Black Seas\ninto Ottoman lakes, and had even assumed a position as a major player in the\ninternational order then taking shape in Europe. It was, in sum, an empire without\nequal\u2014the most powerful state on the planet.41\nThe Historical Debate: The Ghazi Thesis\nThe above account of the Ottoman rise from frontier beylik to major power\nreflects a longstanding consensus among historians who have studied the empire. That\nis, in contrast to the debates over the emergence of Islam or the Arab Conquest, there\nhave been no doubts raised about the chronology of the early Ottoman state or whether\nkey figures described in the sources actually existed. Agreement on these fundamental\npoints is not to suggest, however, that historians have held uniform views of the\nsultanate. On the contrary, scholars who focus on the Ottoman Empire have engaged in\nvigorous debates about a number of issues\u2014particularly ones related to its nature and\nidentity during its early years. What kind of state was it? Whom did the Ottomans permit\nto join its ruling class? What motivated the wars of expansion? Most importantly, what\npurpose did Osman I and his successors claim their state was fulfilling?\nFor much of the mid-twentieth century, the Austrian-Jewish historian Paul\nWittek\u2019s Ghazi Thesis dominated understandings of the empire. First articulated in a\nseries of lectures given at the University of London in 1938 and later published as The\nRise of the Ottoman Empire, the Ghazi Thesis took issue with the then-prevailing idea\nthat the early empire was, at heart, ethnically Turkish in nature. Wittek rested his\ncritique on a careful study of two key pieces of evidence from the early, ill-sourced years\nof the empire, a stone inscription in Bursa dating to 1337 and a work attributed to the\nTurkish poet Ahmedi (1334-1413), that characterized the early Ottomans not in ethnic\nterms as Turks but instead in religious ones as ghazis: Muslim frontier warriors who,\nmotivated by religious zeal, fought ceaselessly to expand the realm of Islam. Based on\nthis evidence and on corroborating secondary-source accounts written by religious\nscholars in the sixteenth century, Wittek concluded that ethnicity did not define the early\nOttoman state; instead, religion\u2014by which he meant the waging of holy war in the name\nof Islam\u2014was the Ottoman\u2019s \u201cdominant idea, the raison d\u2019etre of their state,\u201d and it\nremained so until just before the empire\u2019s demise in the early-twentieth century.42\nWittek\u2019s Ghazi Thesis dominated interpretations of the early Ottoman Empire for\nfour decades. Indeed, it was only after his death in 1978 that scholars began to\nseriously question both his conclusions and the evidence on which they rested. The\n41 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 183.\n42 Paul Wittek, The Rise of the Ottoman Empire: Studies in the History of Turkey,\nThirteenth-Fifteenth Centuries, Royal Asiatic Society Books (New York: Routledge,\n2012), 35. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 59\nhistorian Rudi Paul Lindner was one of the first to do so. Focusing on the action of the\nearly Ottomans rather than on what legal scholars wrote about them in the sixteenth\ncentury, he observed that they routinely fought against neighboring Muslims, practiced\nheterodox rather than orthodox Islam, welcomed the participation of Greek Christian\nsoldiers and commanders on their raids, and refrained from forcing conquered people to\nconvert\u2014actions that were hardly consistent with the behavior of the sort of hardened\nzealots that Wittek had described. Then, having dispensed with the idea that religion\ndefined the early Ottoman state, Lindner followed by articulating a new interpretation of\ntheir motives based on anthropological theories about the nature of tribal groupings.\nDrawing on recent research that holds that tribes are a function of shared interests\nrather than ethnicity or common bloodlines, he argued that the Ottomans were an\ninclusive tribal group consisting of both Muslims and Christians bound together by a\nshared interest in raiding and territorial expansion for the purpose of obtaining loot. In\nhis view, it was only after the \u02bfulama\u02be that Orhan had recruited began to promote the\nghazi ideal that the Ottomans abandoned their early religious inclusivity in favor of an\nembrace of holy war aimed at the territorial expansion of Islam.43\nWhile Colin Imber has recently contended that the absence of evidence renders\nthe early Ottoman Empire a \u201cblack hole\u201d to scholars seeking to uncover its true nature,\nother historians have instead amplified Lindner\u2019s view that the sultanate was remarkably\ninclusive. Drawing attention to the astonishing number of Byzantine and Balkan nobles\nwho held prominent positions in the state, for example, the historian Heath Lowry\nargues that the early Ottoman Empire is best understood as a highly meritocratic,\n\u201cpredatory confederacy open to all rather than as an Islamic-based\u201d state dedicated to\nholy war. In his view, it was the demand for manpower that sparked this inclusive\napproach. Needing soldiers for their profitable raids and wars of expansion, the\nOttomans willingly accepted Christian nobles into their military; eager to gain loot and\nslaves, the latter were only too happy to join. As a result, the Ottoman state developed\nan elite that was an amalgam of Muslim Turks and Greek Christians. Lowry concludes\nthat it was only much later, when the dynasty had begun to see value in using orthodox\nSunni Islam to legitimate its rule following the acquisition of the Holy Places, that Muslim\nwriters\u2014\u201cprojecting an Islamic past back in time\u201d\u2014reimagine the early Ottomans as\nghazi warriors.44\nSources of Ottoman Success\nRegardless of the motives that animated its expansion, the speed of the\ndynasty\u2019s rise is astonishing. A crude, frontier beylik in 1300, the Ottoman confederacy\nhad become an expansive and powerful empire with complex institutions and\nsophisticated political ideologies by the time Mehmet II conquered Constantinople.

Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 60\naccounted for this remarkable transformation? What characteristics and circumstances\nset the Ottomans apart from rival states? Most importantly, why did the Ottomans and\nnot some other group come to dominate the Balkans and Middle East in the Early\nModern Period?\nContingency\nTo a significant degree, Ottoman success was a matter of good fortune. With the\nnear-simultaneous fracturing of the Byzantine Empire, shattering of the Seljuq\nSultanate, and demise of the Abbasid Caliphate, much of the Middle East had become\na vast power vacuum. As a result, rather than standing in the shadow of a nearby great\npower, Osman I\u2019s tiny beylik existed in a world of similarly small states\u2014precisely the\nsort of environment in which a charismatic and able military leader could thrive. The\ndynasty also enjoyed the added good fortune of possessing a beylik that bordered a soft\nfrontier in the form of the weak but wealthy Byzantine Empire rather than ruling a\nterritory surrounded entirely by other aggressive Turkish beys. As we have seen, raiding\nand seizing territory from the Byzantines was both profitable and comparatively easy\nand allowed Osman and his successors to build the kind of military reputation that\nwould attract growing numbers of frontier warriors to the Ottoman banner. Thus, just as\nhad been the case for the Arabs who had conquered the Middle East in the seventh\ncentury and for the knights of the First Crusade who had taken Jerusalem four centuries\nlater, luck played a substantial part in the early empire\u2019s achievements.\nLuck can only go so far in explaining Ottoman success, however. Many of the\ncontemporary Turkish beyliks were considerably larger and fielded many more soldiers\nthan did Osman I\u2019s tiny state in 1300. Likewise, his beylik was hardly the only one with\nthe good fortune to share a border with the vulnerable Byzantine Empire. Luck was thus\nan important precondition for the dynasty\u2019s astonishing rise, but it cannot explain why\nOsman I and his descendants rather than a different Turkish dynasty came to dominate\nthe region and, thus, cannot alone account for Ottoman success. Ultimately, answering\nthe question of why the empire rose so quickly from such humble origins requires an\nexamination of its internal structures, for it was the ideologies, practices, and evolving\ninstitutions of the Ottoman ruling class that ultimately explain the dynasty\u2019s remarkable\nachievements.\nStrong Leadership\nOne of the most obvious sources of Ottoman success was the empire\u2019s\nunusually effective leadership during its early centuries. As we have seen, from its\nfounding at the turn of the fourteenth century through the end of Sul\u00ebiman\u2019s reign in the\nmid-sixteenth century, the sultanate benefited from a remarkable string of peculiarly\neffective rulers. Nearly all the men who served as sultan during that period\u2014the\nOttomans did not permit women to hold the throne\u2014were wise and charismatic rulers\nwho provided able administration and effective military command. As the writer Jason\nGoodwin notes, the nicknames they earned pay testament to their leadership abilities:\nthe Grim, the Conqueror, the Lawgiver, and the Great are hardly the epithets of weak Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 61\nleaders. Moreover, the sheer length of their tenures in office\u2014the first ten sultans\nenjoyed average reigns of a remarkable twenty-seven years\u2014lent a degree of stability\nthat was invaluable to the early Ottoman state.45\nHow did the dynasty come to have such a remarkable succession of capable and\nfar-sighted rulers? Chance once again surely played a part, but far more important was\nthe dynasty\u2019s rejection of primogeniture in favor of a brutal, but effective practice known\nas fratricidal succession\u2014a system that the Ottomans adopted to ensure, in the\nhistorian Donald Quataert\u2019s words, the \u201csurvival of the fittest, not eldest son.\u201d It was the\nanarchic interlude that followed Timur\u2019s defeat of Bayezid I in 1402 that pushed the\ndynasty to embrace fratricidal succession. As we saw earlier, Timur had imposed the\ntraditional, Turko-Mongolian appanage system of shared family governance on the\nOttomans following his victory\u2014an arrangement that, unsurprisingly, produced a\ndecade-long civil war. The victor in that conflict, Mehmet I, was determined to ensure\nthat the dynasty avoided a repeat of that debilitating conflict; accordingly, not long after\nhe had defeated his brothers, he embraced the practice of fratricidal succession as a\nnecessary if unpleasant way of ensuring a stable succession.46\nThe arrangement had two provisions. First, based on the prevailing view that\neach of the sultan\u2019s sons possessed an equal claim to the throne and was thus a\npossible future monarch, it stipulated that all of the heirs should learn how to rule\neffectively by first serving as provincial governors. Second, upon the death of the\nreigning sultan, it called for the sons to engage in a brief struggle for power. That\ncontest would end when one of them made his way to the capital, secured the backing\nof the bureaucracy and military, and assumed the title of sultan. Once in power, the new\nruler would then ensure that he faced no future challenge to his authority by having any\nsurviving brothers executed.47\nThe Ottomans rigorously adhered to this system for the entirety of the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries. At times, the results were shocking. For example, Mehmet II\u2019s\nfirst act as sultan was to command one of his assistants to suffocate his fifteen-month-\nold brother. Some of his successors went even further. Selim I had two of his brothers\nkilled upon acceding to the throne while Murad III (r. 1574-1595) had all five of his\nbrothers\u2014four of whom were infants\u2014executed. However, it was Mehmet III (r. 1595-\n1603) who set the dubious record of having the most siblings killed: upon taking power,\nhe ordered his royal executioners to strangle all nineteen of his brothers.48\n45 Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 167\u201368.\n46 Quote from Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 90\u201391; Streusand, Islamic\nGunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 72.\n47 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 91.\n48 Franz Babinger, Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 1992), 65; Colin Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The\nStructure of Power, Second edition (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 95\u2013101. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 62\nThe system of fratricidal succession may have been cruel, but it was also highly\neffective. Indeed, it provided four substantial benefits that, collectively, constituted the\nprimary reason that the empire enjoyed a succession of strong leaders during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries. First, having heirs gain experience by serving as\nprovincial governors worked as intended: with great consistency, those who became\nsultan possessed the administrative and military experience needed to rule effectively.\nSecond, fratricidal succession\u2019s Darwinian nature generally resulted in the most capable\nson emerging victorious, and, thus ensured that the strongest candidate became the\nnew sultan. Third, the arrangement\u2019s winner-take-all principle proved effective in helping\nthe empire avoid both the decentralizing tendencies of the traditional Turco-Mongolian\nappanage system and the debilitating strife that accompanied internal conflicts such as\nthe civil war that had followed Bayezid I\u2019s reign. This last concern loomed large for\nOttoman political theorists, who defended the system of fratricidal succession as a\npractical necessity. As one thinker later wrote about the murder of Mehmet II\u2019s infant\nbrother, \u201c\u2018it was . . . the better course to root up the sapling of mischief, before it put\nforth leaves and branches.\u2019\u201d Finally, the system ensured that a pretender did not survive\nto become a leader around whom disaffected elements could rally against the reigning\nsultan.49\nThe one instance during this period in which fratricidal succession failed to\neliminate a rival claimant to the throne made clear the system\u2019s benefits. It occurred\nwhen Bayezid II\u2019s defeated brother, Cem (1459-1495), managed to evade the sultan\u2019s\nexecutioners by fleeing into exile in Western Europe. For much of Bayezid II\u2019s reign,\nCem\u2019s presence in Europe constituted a genuine danger to the stability of the empire.\nThe issue was his ability to rally disaffected elements to his cause. Aware that Cem\nenjoyed broad support among the recently dispossessed Anatolian beys, his Western\nhosts used the threat of helping him raise a revolt in Asia Minor as leverage to\nsuccessfully block Bayezid II\u2019s efforts to expand at their expense. Fortunately, for\nBayezid II, Cem proved to be only a transitory menace and never produced the mass\nuprising that the sultan feared. Nonetheless, his mere existence had succeeded in\nhandcuffing the empire for a substantial period\u2014a fact attested to by Bayezid II\u2019s failure\nto expand the sultanate.50\nThereafter, and for the next century, the system of fratricidal succession did what\nthe Ottomans had designed it to do. It ensured that the sultanate would not be\nhamstrung by a pretender like Cem. Likewise, it all but guaranteed that the empire\nwould benefit from the rule of highly effective leaders like Selim I and Sul\u00ebiman. Thus,\nbrutal as it was, the system of fratricidal succession functioned as intended: it made\ncertain that the Ottoman Empire enjoyed a stable succession\u2014something that could not\nbe said about many contemporary states.51\n49 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 72\u201373;\nQuote from Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 96.\n50 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 82\u201385.\n51 Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 155\u201357. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 63\nEfficient Administration\nThe early sultans proved successful not merely because they were capable leaders, but\nalso because they oversaw a peculiarly effective central bureaucracy. Loosely patterned\nafter the now-venerable Muslim tradition of slave-recruited militaries, the imperial\nadministration of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was a uniquely Ottoman\ninnovation that had no parallel in any other state. Staffed by men who were utterly loyal\nto the dynasty, it gave the sultans a remarkably efficient and sophisticated instrument\nthrough which they could implement their policies.\nInitially, it did not vary appreciably from longstanding Islamic structures and\npractices. The religious scholars that Orhan had recruited to run his expanding\ngovernment were well versed in the Muslim administrative tradition that dated to the\nAbbasid Dynasty, and the bureaucracy that they established reflected that system.\nThrough the late-fourteenth century, as a result, the Ottoman system of administration\ndid not differ substantially from those of other contemporary Muslim states.52\nBeginning in the early-fifteenth century, however, the Ottoman state broke\nradically with Muslim tradition with the introduction of a new system of recruitment called\nthe devshirme. Meaning literally \u201c\u2018collection\u2019\u201d but typically referred to in the West as the\n\u201c\u2018levy of boys,\u2019\u201d the practice likely originated in the early-fifteenth century when the\nOttomans moved to create new military and administrative structures aimed at freeing\nthe dynasty from a dependence on the Turkish nobles. The system that they developed\nto achieve that end was a highly innovative one that centered on the enslavement,\nconversion, and education of Christian boys. Every three years, a caravan of tribute\nofficers traveled from settlement to settlement in Greece and the Balkans seeking\nsuitable candidates for service to the sultan among the Christians of the region. After\nassembling the boys in each village, the officers selected only the brightest and most\ncapable among them at a rate of about one in forty. They then brought the boys to\nConstantinople, where they had them converted to Islam\u2014a violation of Islamic law\njustified on grounds of raison d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2014and divided them into two groups. The more\nphysically capable ones were selected to serve in the famed Janissary corps, which we\nwill treat in more detail in a moment, while the ones who demonstrated the highest\nintellectual capacity were reserved for the bureaucracy. Both groups then received\nyears of physical and intellectual education in the empire\u2019s rigorous palace schools.53\nThe devshirme has for a long time equally fascinated and repulsed Westerners.\nThe separation of children from their parents, their enslavement, and their forced\nconversion offend modern sensibilities and seem to suggest that the Ottomans were\npeculiarly ruthless. Such views are ahistorical, however, and lie rooted in a facile\nunderstanding of the world from which the boys came. In fact, the new system offered\nsubstantial benefits to the people recruited through it and was far less arbitrary than it\n52 Lindner, Nomads and Ottomans in Medieval Anatolia, 6\u20138.\n53 Quotes from Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and\nMughals, 82\u201383; Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 30\u201331. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 64\nappears at first blush. Such was certainly the case with regard to the boys\u2019 conversion\nto Islam. Those selected in the devshirme were uneducated peasants living in isolated\nvillages where people practiced folk variants of Christianity that bore little resemblance\nto Orthodox Christian doctrine; conversion to Islam was thus a case more of introducing\nthem to organized religion than of compelling them to abandon deeply held beliefs.54\nSelection through the devshirme also offered opportunities to the boys that were\nwildly beyond a Balkan peasant\u2019s most outlandish dreams. Joining the bureaucracy or\nthe Janissary corps meant going from being one of the tax-paying masses, or raya, to\nbecoming a member of the askeri, or ruling class, and involved trading the parochial\nworld of the village for the cosmopolitan culture of the court and capital city. Like al-\nMutasim\u2019s slave soldiers, moreover, the devshirme-recruited slaves, or qul, were, while\ntechnically the property of the sultan, hardly chattel slaves as commonly understood in\nthe West. Instead, they were respected and powerful people who drew a salary and\nenjoyed access to the levers of power. Recruitment through the devshirme thus not only\ncame at little cost to the boys, but also opened unparalleled opportunities to them.55\nIf the devshirme system was good to its recruits, it proved even more beneficial\nto the sultans. they derived three critical advantages from it. First, they benefited from\nthe fact that the bureaucrats were utterly devoted to them. Dependent entirely upon the\nOttoman rulers for their position and subject to dismissal or worse should they displease\ntheir patron, the bureaucrats were\u2014in sharp contrast to the independently minded\nTurkish nobles\u2014completely loyal to the dynasty. Second, as the boys lacked powerful\nfamily connections and as their children, born Muslim, could not succeed them in\ngovernment service, the ability of a bureaucrat to rise in the administration was\ndependent almost entirely on his ability. In other words, the devshirme system produced\na central administration that was unusually meritocratic and thus highly competent and\nefficient.56\nFinally, the devshirme system provided the dynasty with a way out of a\npredicament that stemmed from its growing embrace of Islam beginning in the fifteenth\ncentury. As we have seen, the Ottoman state had gladly and profitably employed\nChristians from the very start of the empire; indeed, its willingness to do so had been a\nkey source of its strength. However, the dynasty\u2019s increasing inclination to legitimate its\nrule in orthodox Sunni terms had begun to make the practice of employing Christian\nbureaucrats and, especially, soldiers increasingly hard to justify. The sultans thus found\nthemselves caught on the horns of a dilemma: if they continued to rely on the Christians\nthat had proven so essential to the dynasty\u2019s early success, they would undermine the\nlegitimacy that their embrace of Sunnism had provided; if they instead refused to\n54 Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 56\u201362.\n55 Goodwin, 56\u201362.\n56 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 82\u201383,\n93\u201394. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 65\nemploy those subjects, they would risk losing a vital source of highly effective soldiers\nand bureaucrats.57\nThe devshirme system provided a way to resolve this predicament. It allowed the\ndynasty to continue to use Christian-born subjects in the military and bureaucracy\nwithout raising doubts about the sultans\u2019 religious bona fides or their status as the\nprotectors of orthodox Sunnism. The results were nothing if not ironic. By formalizing a\nsystem that put Christian-born people in charge of the government and the military, the\ndevshirme system ensured that the conquered gradually came to displace Muslim-born\nTurks as the backbone of the ruling class.58\nThe Ottoman Military\nThe empire\u2019s powerful army was perhaps the most obvious contributor to its\nrapid rise to dominance. From the very beginning, when Osman\u2019s military abilities had\nattracted akinji frontier warriors to his banner, the dynasty had enjoyed a steadily\nwidening quantitative and qualitative advantage over its enemies that consistently gave\nit the edge needed to expand at their expense. That gap continued to gradually widen\nover the course of the next hundred years. By the early-fifteenth century, however, the\nempire\u2019s military advantage no longer rested primarily on the prowess of its leaders or\ntheir ability to attract nomadic fighters. Instead, from that point until the end of the\nsixteenth century, it stemmed chiefly from the empire\u2019s embrace of innovative military\npractices including\u2014most notably\u2014its precocious adoption of gunpowder weapons and\nattendant development of groundbreaking new tactics that facilitated their effective use\nin battle.59\nEven before their wholesale embrace of firearms, Ottoman leaders had\naggressively pioneered the development and financing of new, highly effective types of\nsoldiers. Indeed, much of the dynasty\u2019s early success had stemmed from its ability to\nquickly replace the fearsome-but-unreliable akinji raiders on whom Osman I had relied\nwith more dependable and disciplined troops. The most important of those new soldiers\nduring the dynasty\u2019s early years were the sipahis. Though far-less famous than the gun-\narmed Janissaries, the sipahi horsemen were a key part of the Ottoman military from\nthe time they displaced the akinji as the core of the army in the 1360s through the end\nof the sixteenth century. Able to move quickly thanks to their light armor, they could\noutmaneuver or outrun heavier cavalry such as the knights that the European states\nfielded while still packing a formidable punch. Indeed, using the powerful Turkish\nrecurved bow, the typical sipahi could successfully strike an enemy horseman two-\nhundred-and-fifty meters away an astonishing one time in four. This combination of\nmobility and firepower was all-but unmatched in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\n57 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 30\u201331.\n58 Quataert, 30\u201331.\n59 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 82\u201387. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 66\nand, for a time, it gave the Ottomans a substantial military edge that allowed them to\nconsistently win pitched battles.60\nWhat really set the sipahis apart, however, was not their tactical abilities but\ninstead the innovative administrative arrangement\u2014the timar system\u2014that the dynasty\ndeveloped to raise them. With obvious antecedents in the older iqta structure of land\ngrants, the new arrangement derived its name from a unit of agricultural land or\npasturage known as a timar. Individual sipahi received a share of the revenue\ngenerated by a standard timar for their upkeep, while district governors known as\nsanjakbeys and provincial governors called beylerbeys enjoyed a portion of the income\nproduced by larger territories in accordance with their greater power and\nresponsibilities. To vouchsafe against recipients establishing roots that might result in\nthem acquiring hereditary control over their grants, the Sublime Porte regularly rotated\nsipahis and other officials to new timars.61\nThis novel new organizational arrangement allowed the empire to sidestep a\ncommon problem that premodern states experienced in financing their militaries.\nLacking the administrative capacity to tax agricultural land directly, such regimes could\nonly raise large forces by ceding substantial independence to powerful and frequently\nunreliable local subordinates. As a result, they often found themselves facing the\ndilemma of having to choose between maintaining a high degree of central political\ncontrol or possessing a large army. The timar system was a successful response to this\npredicament\u2014a case of the Ottomans having their cake and eating it too. By devolving\nthe power to raise taxes to local leaders while simultaneously retaining control of the\nland, the arrangement permitted the Sublime Porte to raise a large military force even\nas it continued to uphold its authority in the provinces.62\nWhile the sipahis remained an important part of the Ottoman military through the\nend of the sixteenth century, they increasingly found themselves eclipsed by the\nJanissary foot soldiers after 1440. Recruited through the devshirme system and thus,\ntechnically, in thrall to the sultan, the Janissaries may appear at first glance to be figures\nof relatively low rank in the Ottoman hierarchy. They could not marry, were barred from\ntaking up a trade, and had to live in the barracks for their entire adult lives. Such an\nimpression is entirely misleading, however. In reality, the Janissaries were\u2014like the\nbureaucrats\u2014high-status members of the askeri who enjoyed a unique position in the\ngovernment.63\nWhat accounted for their power and prestige? At root, their privileged position\nstemmed from their adoption of firearms in the mid-fifteenth century. Guns had existed\nfor some time, but, to that point, no one had yet found a way to overcome their intrinsic\n60 Streusand, 84.\n61 Streusand, 82\u201387, 98\u201399; Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 29.\n62 G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston, Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the\nOttoman Empire (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 23.\n63 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 30\u201331. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 67\nshortcomings as battlefield weapons. Those limits were substantial. While they packed\na powerful punch, firearms were also heavy, slow to reload, and remarkably inaccurate.\nPerhaps most importantly, they did not integrate effectively with longstanding battle\ntactics that centered on bows and melee weapons. Through the early-fifteenth century,\nas a result, they remained more of a novelty than a mainstay in field engagements.64\nThe Ottomans were the first to devise new tactics that could render early guns\neffective battlefield weapons. They determined that soldiers marching in a tightly\norganized formation and firing simultaneously could not only overcome the weaknesses\nintrinsic to early firearms, but could, if sufficiently disciplined, enjoy a decisive\nadvantage over armies using traditional weapons. There was one snag, however.\nFirearms required not merely well-disciplined troops, but also ones willing to abandon\nmillennia of military practices centered on traditional weapons in favor of radically new\ntactics and arms. For reasons we will explore in a moment, most soldiers were reluctant\nto do so. Here, the Janissaries were a notable exception. Beholden to the sultan and\ntrained from an early age to follow orders without question, they broke ranks with their\ncomrades in arms and willingly took up the new weapons in the 1440s.65\nThe results were revolutionary. Wearing uniforms\u2014itself an innovation at the\ntime\u2014and marching into battle at a pace set by an accompanying military band, the\nJanissaries were the first real professional army since the Romans. Grim, disciplined,\nand full of pride, they gave the Ottomans an incalculable advantage and proved to be\nthe difference in pivotal battles such as Chaldiran and Marj Dabik. They were no flash in\nthe pan, moreover. On the contrary, the Janissaries would retain their commanding lead\nin gunpowder weapons and related tactics for well over a century. Indeed, only with the\nmaturation of a series of changes to warfare in the sixteenth and early-seventeenth\ncenturies so far reaching that historians refer to them collectively as the Military\nRevolution would the empire finally begin to face comparably powerful rivals along its\nEuropean borders.66\nFiscal Strength\nThe early Ottoman Empire also enjoyed the enormous advantage of being in a\nconsistently strong fiscal position. Despite the vast cost of the bureaucracy, standing\narmy, and palace, the Sublime Porte only occasionally found itself facing fiscal shortfalls\nand, in sharp contrast to nearly all contemporary states, frequently ran a surplus. What\naccounted this unusual situation?\nThree broad factors explain the empire\u2019s fiscal good fortune. First, the Sublime\nPorte benefited from a robust, expanding economy during its first three centuries. To a\n64 Quataert, 30\u201331.\n65 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 83.\n66 Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West,\n1500-1800, Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 24;\nStreusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 83. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 68\nsubstantial degree, this growth was a function of the order and security that the\nOttomans brought to the heretofore fractious regions of Anatolia and the Balkans. The\nsultan\u2019s powerful government quickly ended the constant warfare and brigandage\nendemic to the region and freed the people it ruled from the confiscatory taxes that the\nlocal nobles had imposed following the Fourth Crusade and the collapse of Byzantine\nauthority. The results were impressive. Once again able to keep a large share of any\nadditional wealth that they produced, farmers responded by putting new land under the\nplow and by intensifying the cultivation of existing fields, while merchants and\ncraftspeople reacted by aggressively investing in commercial ventures that were once\nagain profitable. The result was an economic and demographic boom over the course of\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\u2014one that produced a concomitant rise in the tax\nreceipts that the central government collected.67\nSecond, the Sublime Porte enjoyed substantial revenue derived from the duties it\nassessed on trade. From early on, the empire enjoyed steadily rising customs receipts\nthanks to its fortuitous location between the West and the sources of the Eastern goods\nthat Europeans craved. The Ottomans began to tap into this revenue stream in the late-\nfourteenth century when Bursa supplanted the Byzantine city of Trebizond as the\nprimary entrepot for Asian goods being transshipped to Europe. Later, the conquest of\nConstantinople cemented Ottoman control of the western end of the Silk Road, while\nthe extension of the imperial writ to the northern Red Sea in the 1510s gave the\nsultanate a lock on the traditional maritime trade routes that linked the Mediterranean\nregion to India. As a result, over the course of the fifteenth and early-sixteenth\ncenturies, the Ottoman government enjoyed steadily rising customs receipts from goods\ntransshipped through the empire.68\nEven da Gama\u2019s establishment of a maritime connection between Europe and\nthe Indian Ocean barely dented the amount of customs revenue that the sultan\u2019s\ngovernment received. Two factors explain the limited impact of that new commercial\nlink. First, Ottoman tax receipts remained high because of the limited extent of direct\ntrade between Europe and India. Indeed, the volume of commerce that went around the\nCape of Good Hope remain comparatively small relative to the amount that went\nthrough the sultan\u2019s territory through the end of the sixteenth century. Second, the\nestablishment of profitable sugar plantations in Egypt and the growing involvement of\nOttoman merchants in the shipment of Yemeni coffee to Europe generated new streams\nof tax revenue that more than offset any decline in customs receipts that may have\nresulted from the direct trade between India and Europe.69\nFinally, the very act of conquest itself dramatically improved the fiscal health of\nthe central government. That imperial expansion generated revenue may seem\n67 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 28; Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 118.\n68 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 105\u20136.\n69 Jane Hathaway, \u201cThe Ottomans and the Yemeni Coffee Trade,\u201d Oriente Moderno 25\n(86), no. 1 (2006): 161\u201371; Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans,\nSafavids, and Mughals, 105\u20136. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 69\ncounterintuitive at first blush. After all, the army that acquired those territories consumed\nthe vast bulk of the state\u2019s revenue. Still, even when accounting for the cost of the\nsultan\u2019s military\u2014and that expense was substantial\u2014the empire\u2019s nearly unbroken\nstring of victories between 1299 and 1566 proved enormously profitable for the Sublime\nPorte. The key was the way that the Ottomans divided the loot acquired in conquest.\nLongstanding Islamic custom decreed that the sultan received a hefty one-fifth of all\nbooty taken in war. Coupled with the Ottoman military\u2019s near-constant success, this\nprovision ensured that the state received enormous and regular infusions of wealth\u2014\nmassive surpluses that more than offset the cost of the wars of conquest.70\nThus, the Sublime Porte only rarely faced fiscal challenges during its rise to\npower. Thanks to the general growth in economic activity, the steady increase in\ncustoms duties, and the regular influx of enormous quantities of loot, the Ottomans\nconsistently received more than adequate revenue to cover the empire\u2019s substantial\nexpenses during its rise to dominance. It was, to say the least, an unusual and highly\nenviable position.\nThe Circle of Justice\nWhile a strong central government, favored fiscal position, and powerful military\nmade possible the acquisition of an empire, it was the Ottomans\u2019 tolerant approach to\nthe subject peoples they governed that permitted them to retain it. The dynasty\u2019s mild\nrule reflected its adherence to an older Islamic ideology of just government called the\nCircle of Justice. This doctrine held that if the monarch was a beneficent ruler who kept\ntaxes reasonable and predictable and who maintained order, the peasants would thrive,\nand the treasury would obtain adequate tax revenue each year. In turn, those strong tax\nreceipts would underwrite a powerful and effective army that would complete the Circle\nof Justice by ensuring that the ruler\u2019s position remained secure and unchallenged. If, in\ncontrast, the sultan did not rule justly, then the peasants would fail to prosper, tax\nreceipts would gradually slip, the army would inevitably weaken, and, eventually, the\nruler would be overthrown. Thus, just rule ensured not merely the well-being of society,\nbut also the continued success of the ruling dynasty.71\nOttoman sultans well understood the implications of the Circle of Justice, and\nthey approached the administration of their empire in accordance with its dictates. For\ntheir Muslim subjects, doing so was straightforward: the government merely needed to\nkeep taxes at a reasonable rate and ensure the stability and order required for shari\u02bfa\nlaw to function. The empire\u2019s substantial non-Muslim population\u2014it remained majority\nChristian through the 1510s and possessed nearly as many Christians as Muslims even\nafter Selim I\u2019s conquest of the Middle East\u2014was a different matter, however. How could\n70 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 176.\n71 Linda T. Darling, A History of Social Justice and Political Power in the Middle East:\nThe Circle of Justice From Mesopotamia to Globalization (New York: Routledge, 2013),\n2\u201314. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 70\nthe Ottoman dynasty provide its non-Muslims subjects with the just rule on which\nprosperity and the well-being of the state depended?72\nIt did so by expanding and codifying the empire\u2019s longstanding system of\nreligious toleration. Established by Mehmet II and later formalized as the Millet System,\nthis arrangement extended formal recognition to religious minorities by granting them\nthe power to administer their own legal, educational, and charitable affairs under the\naegis of their leading ecclesiastical figure. For example, the Patriarch of Constantinople\noversaw the administration of the Greek Orthodox community. His office provided the\nsultan\u2019s Greek subjects with education through church-run schools, maintained social\norder within the community by overseeing issues such as marriage and inheritance\nthrough its ecclesiastical courts, and aided poor Greeks through religiously based\ncharitable organizations. At sharp variance with the structure of nearly all modern\nstates, the Millet system worked remarkably well for both the confessional groups and\nthe Ottoman government. By ceding autonomy to the different religious communities,\nthe Millet System not only satisfied their needs and desires, but\u2014in keeping with the\nCircle of Justice\u2014also ensured that they enjoyed the just rule on which the fiscal health\nof the state depended.73\nThe sultanate\u2019s tolerance of the empire\u2019s Jewish community was particularly\nnotable and proved highly beneficial to both parties. The empire manifested its\nacceptance of Jewish people in two ways. First, it accorded them official status as a\nsanctioned religious community. Beginning with Mehmet II, the government recognized\nthe Grand Rabbi of Constantinople as the head of the Jewish community and gave his\noffice authority over its legal, educational, religious, and charitable affairs. As a result,\nJewish subjects of the empire enjoyed legal protection, educational opportunities, and\u2014\nshould they fall on hard times\u2014access to social welfare benefits through institutions that\ntheir community controlled. Second, the Ottoman government did not merely tolerate\nthe existing Jewish community in the empire, but also gladly welcomed Jewish refugees\nfleeing discrimination in Christian Europe. Most notably, when King Ferdinand II\n(r. 1479-1516) of Aragon issued the Alhambra Decree in 1492 requiring Sephardi Jews\nto either convert to Christianity or leave Spain, Bayezid II instructed his officials to\nwelcome them in the Ottoman Empire. Settling largely in Salonika, the Sephardi Jews\nbrought with them profitable industries that soon, in keeping with the Circle of Justice,\npaid the sultan back for his tolerance by generating substantial tax revenue for the\nstate. Bayezid II was well aware of the benefits he was accruing thanks to this policy.\nGleeful about his gain, he reputedly mocked Ferdinand II for kicking Jewish people out\nof Aragon, declaring that \u201c\u2018[h]e is impoverishing his country and enriching my\nkingdom.\u2019\u201d74\n72 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 103\u20134.\n73 Calic, The Great Cauldron, 90\u201392.\n74 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 88. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 71\nCultural Openness\nThe Ottoman state also demonstrated a remarkable willingness to adopt new and\neffective cultural practices regardless of their provenance. Indeed, in sharp contrast to\nits often chauvinistic and prejudiced contemporaries, the dynasty unabashedly\nembraced ideas, methods, and even people from other cultures as well as disruptive\nnew technological innovations. Doing so greatly strengthened the Ottoman Empire and\nplayed no small part in facilitating its rapid expansion.\nThe Ottomans\u2019 cultural openness is most evident in three ways. First, the dynasty\nwas unusually receptive to having non-Turks and non-Muslims hold important\nleadership positions. As we have seen, during its early centuries, the Ottomans did not\nmake membership in the askeri contingent on being Turkish or even following the\nIslamic faith. Instead, it gladly welcomed substantial numbers of Jewish people and\nChristians into what the historian Ira Lapidus calls \u201ca condominium of elites.\u201d Thus, a\nJewish refugee from Spain was an important advisor to Sul\u00ebiman and later became the\nDuke of Naxos. Similarly, a converted nephew of the final Byzantine emperor became\none of Mehmet II\u2019s grand viziers while a second served as the powerful Ottoman\ngovernor of the Balkans. Indeed, Greeks\u2014both Christians and converts to Islam alike\u2014\nwere so common in the administration of the early empire that the historian Dimitri\nKitsikis characterizes the Ottoman state of that period as a \u201cTurkish-Greek Empire.\u201d75\nSecond, the Ottomans readily adopted practices and methods from other\ncultures\u2014including, notably, non-Muslim ones. For example, while the timar system had\nobvious antecedents in the semi-feudal iqtas that the the Buyids and many subsequent\nMuslim states had adopted, they also drew on a similar late-Byzantine fiscal\narrangement called a pronoia. Ottoman architecture\u2014particularly the design of\nmonumental buildings such as the Blue Mosque\u2014likewise made clear the empire\u2019s\nopenness to foreign ideas. Those structures may have adhered to longstanding Muslim\narchitectural traditions, but they also borrowed in obvious ways from the design of grand\nByzantine buildings such as the Hagia Sophia.76\nFinally, Ottoman openness to new ideas and technologies was central to its\nprecocious adoption of gunpowder weapons. Firearms were not new when the\nJanissaries began to use them. On the contrary, so-called hand cannons had existed\nsince the late-thirteenth century. For two reasons, however, they had not yet gained\nwidespread acceptance among the armies of Europe and the Middle East. First, as we\nhave seen, military leaders found them to be difficult to integrate into established\nbattlefield tactics that centered on traditional weapons such as bows, swords, and\n75 Lapidus quote from Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed.\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 264; Kitskikis quote from Lowry, The\nNature of the Early Ottoman State, 12; Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires:\nOttomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 67.\n76 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 263; Mark Bartusis, The Late Byzantine Army:\nArms and Society, 1204-1453 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992). Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 72\nlances and were thus reluctant to use them in large numbers. This hesitance was\nimportant, but the second reason was likely more critical in explaining the limited\nadoption of gunpowder weapons in the fourteenth and early-fifteenth centuries: broadly\nspeaking, soldiers in most armies perceived firearms to be incompatible with\nlongstanding masculine military ideologies and traditions. Nearly everywhere, both the\nrank-and-file and their leaders believed that killing at a distance using arms as crude as\nguns violated the warrior code of bravery to which they adhered and preferred to fight in\nhand-to-hand combat using traditional melee weapons. For these reasons, nearly all\nmilitary forces in both Europe and the Middle East had only incompletely adopted guns\nby the early-fifteenth century.77\nThe Ottomans were not burdened with such hidebound views, however. On the\ncontrary, they were happy to adopt effective new technologies even if they upset\nexisting practices and values. Indeed, as we have seen, once they had devised tactics\nfor their effective use, the Ottomans quickly embraced gunpowder weapons and began\nto employ them on a mass scale. As a result, for a brief but critical period, the sultan\u2019s\nforces enjoyed a near-monopoly on the use of massed firearms. That advantage proved\nto be decisive. As we have seen, the empire\u2019s deployment of siege cannons was the\ndeciding factor during Mehmet II\u2019s successful siege of Constantinople, while the use of\ngunpowder weapons against Safavid and Mamluk armies\u2014which had vigorously\nresisted the adoption of firearms\u2014had made possible the victories at Chaldiran and\nMarj Dabik that had allowed the sultanate to seize vast swaths of territory in the Arab\nMiddle East.78\nThe Safavid Empire\nWhile the Ottoman Empire was the dominant state in the Middle East during the\nEarly Modern Period, it faced for a time a powerful rival in the region in the form of the\nSafavid Dynasty (1501-1722). Controlling the Iranian plateau for more than two\ncenturies, the Safavid state bore many similarities to the Ottoman Empire. Both reached\ntheir apogee as a result of their adoption of gunpowder weapons, and both used\nlongstanding Muslim administrative practices to centralize power. As a consequence,\nhistorians have typically treated the Ottoman and Safavid states as a pair of similar,\ngunpowder-based empires. This characterization is not without merit. As we shall see,\nthose states did indeed resemble each other in a number of critical ways. At the same\ntime, however, many of their commonalities were surface ones that obscured\nfundamental differences in their political systems, methods of military recruitment, and,\nespecially, religious policies.\n77 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 30.\n78 Lord Kinross, Ottoman Centuries (New York: Harper Perennial, 1977), 52; Quataert,\nThe Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 30. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 73\nOrigins\nThose differences stretched back to the two dynasties\u2019 sharply contrasting origin\nstories. Unlike the Ottomans, the Safavids began not as a military or political group but\ninstead as a populist, Sufi religious order that found appeal with some of the Turkish\ntribes of eastern Anatolia and western Iran. Established at the turn of the fourteenth\ncentury by its namesake, Safi ad-Din (c. 1252-1334), the family at first oversaw a fairly\ntypical mystical, Sufi order. It did not retain that orientation for long, however. On the\ncontrary, like a number of similar orders in the region, the Safavids\u2019 theological position\ngrew more extreme and heterodox in response to the political disorder and the collapse\nof Sunni institutions that occurred following the demise of the Ilkhanate and the Seljuq\nSultanate of Rum. Indeed, within just a few decades, it had transformed into a militant\norganization that embraced ghuluww: a term that connoted an extremist, nomadic\nopposition to centralized authority and a belief that certain charismatic leaders\npossessed a direct link to the divine.79\nThe pivotal moment in that transformation came under Safi al-Din\u2019s great\ngrandson, Junayd (r. 1447-1460). Facing a challenge from one of his uncles who\nenjoyed the backing of the powerful Qaraquyunlu, or Black Sheep confederation of\nTurkish tribes, Junayd abandoned the Safavids\u2019 heretofore narrow focus on spiritual\nconcerns in favor of an aggressive approach that would fundamentally restructure the\norder. Advancing messianic claims to justify his new role, he assumed the political and\nmilitary leadership of the tribes that adhered to his teachings and forged an alliance with\nthe Qaraquyunlus\u2019 rivals, the Aqquyunlu, or White Sheep confederation of Turkish\ntribes. These moves proved consequential. They not only resulted in the defeat of\nJunayd\u2019s uncle, but, more fundamentally, also completed the Safavid order\u2019s\nmetamorphosis from a mystical organization into a militant movement driven by\nghuluww ideology.80\nFurther dramatic changes followed under his son and successor, Haydar,\n(r. 1460-1488). Not long after taking power, he abandoned Sunnism in favor of Shi\u02bfism\nand began to assert that the Safavid family descended from the Prophet Muhammad\nthrough the line of Ali and Fatimah. These were bold moves\u2014ones that would have\nsignificant consequences. In the immediate term, they inspired a number of Haydar\u2019s\nmore-devoted supporters to follow his lead and adopt Shi\u02bfism. To demonstrate their\ncommitment to their new sect, they began to wear a distinctive, twelve-folded red\nturban\u2014each fold representing one of the twelve Imams\u2014called the Qizilbash, a term\nused thereafter to denote the tribes that supported the Safavid order. Later, as we shall\nexplore further in a moment, they led to the people of Iran adopting Twelver Shi\u02bfism\u2014a\nchange of enormous significance that would reverberate to the present day.81\n79 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 159\u201361.\n80 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 233\u201334.\n81 Garthwaite, The Persians, 160\u201361. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 74\nIronically, however, the success of Haydar\u2019s religious claims would also create\nserious problems for the Safavid Dynasty. The issue was the growing appeal of his\nrevolutionary mix of Shi\u02bfi and ghulat ideology among the Turkmen of eastern Anatolia\nand western Iran. Fearing that the Safavid leader\u2019s surging appeal would reduce him to\nvassalage, the Aqquyunlu leader Yaqub (r. 1478-1490), broke with Haydar in 1488 and\nwent to war with the Qizilbash. The conflict went disastrously for the Safavids. Not only\ndid the Qizilbash tribes suffer a serious defeat at the hands of Yaqub\u2019s soldiers, but\nHaydar himself died in the fighting. Taking advantage of the ensuing chaos, the\nAqquyunlu followed their victory by systematically killing or imprisoning all of the\nremaining members of the family save for Haydar\u2019s seven-year-old son, Ismail (r. 1501-\n1524), who managed to escape into hiding in 1494. It was a major setback for the\nSafavids\u2014one that appeared to have doomed the dynasty to irrelevance.82\nShah Ismail\nInstead, it achieved a remarkable revival under the youthful Ismail. Reemerging\nin 1499 at the age of twelve, the charismatic Safavid leader rallied a confederation of\nQizilbash and disaffected Aqquyunlu tribes to his banner. Eschewing moderation, he\ndeclared himself to be Ali reincarnate, the Hidden Imam, and a descendant of the\nSeventh Imam. Under his messianic leadership, the Qizilbash seized the Aqquyunlu\ncapital of Tabriz in 1501\u2014which Ismail made his own\u2014and then defeated its army in\n1503. Having eliminated their most powerful regional opponent, the Qizilbash followed\nwith a lightening campaign that resulted in Ismail assuming control of the entirety of the\nIranian plateau. He followed by declaring himself ruler of all Persia. In so doing, he did\nnot assume a conventional title such as sultan. On the contrary, seeking to legitimate\nhis rule by connecting his state to Persia\u2019s distinct identity and history and\u2014perhaps\u2014\nto obscure his Turkish background, Ismail adopted the ancient Persian title of shah.83\nFlush with success, he next moved to extend his influence among the tribal\nTurkmen of Ottoman-controlled eastern Anatolia. Wielding the Safavids\u2019 revolutionary\nmix of Shi\u02bfi and ghulat ideas as a subversive, ideological cudgel, he sent missionaries\ninto the region and made contact with key Turkish leaders in hopes of detaching the\ntribes from the Ottoman Empire. While his message found a welcome reception among\nthe many Turkmen who wished to regain their autonomy, his initiative ultimately ended\nin disaster. As we saw earlier in this chapter, Sultan Selim I was determined to maintain\nhis grip over eastern Asia Minor and opted to respond to Ismail\u2019s provocation by\ninvading Iran. Ismail and his Qizilbash soldiers met the Ottoman army at Chaldiran in\nthe far-northwest part of the Iranian plateau. Genuinely believing that he was the Hidden\nImam, the shah was blithely unconcerned that Selim I\u2019s army enjoyed a substantial\nnumerical advantage or that its troops possessed firearms while his army instead relied\non bows, swords, and lances. Indeed, Ismail was so confident that he enjoyed divine\nfavor that he personally led a cavalry charge against the center of the Ottoman line. The\n82 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 143.\n83 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 234; Howard, A History of the Ottoman\nEmpire, 86; Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 186. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 75\nresults were disastrous. Inflicting heavy casualties, the massed fire of the Ottoman\ncannons and gun-armed Janissaries decimated his horsemen and turned the Battle of\nChaldiran into a bloody rout. With Ismail\u2019s army all but destroyed, the victors followed by\nbriefly occupying Tabriz before retiring from Safavid territory.84\nThe Qizilbash Interlude\nSelim I\u2019s withdrawal rescued Ismail but could not obscure the fact that Chaldiran\nhad been a crushing setback\u2014one that fundamentally altered the political balance in\nPersia. The most immediate result of the defeat was the shattering of Ismail\u2019s\nconfidence. Depressed by his failure, he never again led an army in battle and instead\nspent the remaining decade of his reign drinking and otherwise indulging himself in the\npleasures of his position. His withdrawal from leadership would have serious\nramifications for the Safavids. No longer believing after Chaldiran that Ismail was\ndivinely ordained, the dynasty\u2019s onetime Qizilbash supporters took advantage of his\ndistraction to assert their autonomy. Controlling valuable pasturage that permitted them\nto field a large force of horsemen, they quickly assumed a dominant position over Iran\nand its central government that they would retain for the balance of the sixteenth\ncentury. As a result, Ismail\u2019s successors found themselves in a difficult situation\u2014too\nweak either to defend the country from Ottoman depredations or to curb the power of\nthe Qizilbash.85\nShah Abbas I\nIt was only at the very end of the sixteenth century that a new and dynamic\nleader, Ismail\u2019s great grandson Abbas I (r. 1588-1629), would emerge to restore the\ndynasty\u2019s position. That he was able to do so was surprising in light of the trying\ncircumstances that he faced at the start of his reign. In the years immediately preceding\nhis accession to the throne, Ottoman forces had exploited his father\u2019s weak rule to hive\noff substantial territory along Iran\u2019s western border. Worse, Qizilbash factions had\nbegun to engage in destabilizing civil conflict and to intervene in the affairs of the central\ngovernment. This last challenge was especially dangerous for the Safavids. The tribes\nnot only killed the queen in 1579 and the grand vizier in 1583 but had also taken to\nmeddling in the succession. Indeed, Abbas I himself had become shah at the behest of\na Qizilbash leader, Murshid Quli Khan Ustajlu, who hoped to rule from behind the\nthrone.86\nThe sixteen-year-old monarch quickly proved that he was up to these challenges.\nTaking advantage of worsening factionalism among the Qizilbash, he first acted by\nlining up the political support needed to have Murshid Quli Khan executed. Having\n84 Roger Savory, Iran Under the Safavids (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,\n2007), 39\u201346.\n85 Garthwaite, The Persians, 167\u201369; Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 64\u201365.\n86 Abbas Amanat, Iran: A Modern History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017),\n72\u201375. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 76\nsecured his autonomy, he followed by centralizing power in his hands. Key to this effort\nwas his creation of a royal monopoly over the production and export of silk, Iran\u2019s most\nvaluable product. It was a characteristically shrewd move on his part\u2014one that provided\nhim with the revenue needed both to develop an efficient central administration and to\nturn the firearm-equipped slave army that his grandfather, Tahmsap (r. 1524-1576), had\nestablished into a force powerful enough to check the Qizilbash.87\nAbbas I followed by relocating the capital to the city of Isfahan. Doing so came\nwith two substantial advantages. First, the move put his government in a central location\nfrom which it could more easily control Iran. Second, and far more important, relocating\nthe capital made possible the construction of a new palace complex of monumental\narchitecture that could serve as the symbolic centerpiece of a renewed and\nstrengthened Safavid state. The results were\u2014and are\u2014impressive. Arranged around\nthe Naqsh-I Jahan, a massive and beautiful new maidan, or square, that measures one\nhundred and sixty meters by five hundred meters, the complex of structures he built was\nstunning. It included the Ali Qapu Palace, the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, and, above all,\nthe magnificent Shah Mosque and its attendant madrasas. Befitting his state\u2019s\ndependence on revenue derived from trade, it also featured a new bazaar.88\nThe palace complex and the reconstructed city of Isfahan served a number of\nends. The buildings accommodated the administrators on whom Abbas I\u2019s centralizing\nplan depended, while the new neighborhoods in Isfahan supported the fiscal key to his\nstate: the silk workers and their workshops. Meanwhile, the grandness of the\narchitecture and the brilliance and orderliness of Isfahan proclaimed the glory of Abbas I\nand the Safavids and suggested that the stability embodied in the orderly, planned city\nof Isfahan depended on the continuation of the dynasty. Isfahan thus constituted not\nonly the physical center of Abbas I\u2019s powerful new administrative state, but also the\nsymbolic core of his effort to legitimate Safavid rule.89\nAbbas I\u2019s domestic accomplishments soon led to success abroad. His powerful\nnew army recovered Tabriz in 1603 and Armenia in 1604 and decisively repelled an\nOttoman counterattack in 1605. After a lull, it scored a number of further victories. In\n1622, it succeeded both in retaking the important eastern city of Qandahar from the\nMughal Empire and, in conjunction with the British East India Company, in ejecting the\nPortuguese from the Island of Hormuz. This last triumph was especially significant. It\ngave the delighted shah control over both the entrance to the Persian Gulf and the trade\nthat passed through it. Finally, in 1624, his armies not only seized Baghdad but\nmanaged to hold it in the face of a concerted Ottoman counterattack.90\nThus, by the time he died in 1629, Shah Abbas I had fully restored Safavid rule.\nHe had ended Qizilbash dominance of the government, restored control of the border,\n87 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 150\u201353.\n88 Garthwaite, The Persians, 175\u201376.\n89 Amanat, Iran, 82\u201391.\n90 Garthwaite, The Persians, 174. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 77\nand affirmed the idea that a powerful monarch should rule over Iran. Importantly, he had\nalso replaced tribal rule with a strong, centralized bureaucracy and turned the firearm-\nequipped slave army that his grandfather had pioneered into a powerful force\ncomparable to the Ottoman Janissaries.91\nDissolution\nUnfortunately for the Safavids, however, the dynasty was unable to maintain the\nbureaucratic and military system that Abbas I had established. Two issues prevented it\nfrom doing so. First, none of Abbas I\u2019s successors possessed his creativity, charisma,\nor leadership skills. Indeed, they were, for the most part, his polar opposites. For\nexample, the penultimate shah, Safi II (r. 1666-1694), spent most of his time drinking\nand pursuing sexual conquests and thus provided little guidance during what was a\ndifficult period. Remarkably, his successor, Sultan Husayn (r. 1694-1722), was even\nworse. Thanks to his excessive alcohol consumption and, ironically, the intense piety\nthat monopolized his time, he failed to provide any effective direction of the state\nwhatsoever.92\nThe second issue, the empire\u2019s worsening fiscal situation, proved to be even\nmore problematic. Importing more goods than it exported, Persia experienced steady\nspecie drain and inflation in the decades following Abbas I\u2019s reign. Exacerbated by the\ndecision to end the state monopoly on silk exports, the worsening trade balance\nresulted in the steady decline of tax receipts. Making matters worse, the dynasty failed\nto maintain the tenuous control that Abbas I had established over Persia\u2019s agricultural\nregions; as a result, successive shah\u2019s saw those lands\u2014and the tax revenue that they\ngenerated\u2014revert to the increasingly restive and independent tribes.93\nThe results were catastrophic for the state. With tax receipts steadily falling,\nAbbas I\u2019s successors had little choice but to let his bureaucracy and his once-vaunted\nmilitary gradually wither. Relative peace along Persia\u2019s borders obscured the decline of\nSafavid power for some time. By the 1710s, however, the dynasty could no longer\ndisguise the feebleness of its position, and foreign powers began to peel off its outlying\nterritory. The coup de grace finally came in 1722 when the tribal Ghalzay Afghans\nseized Isfahan and compelled the final Safavid shah to abdicate\u2014thus bringing the\ndynasty to an ignominious end. The demise of Safavid rule was a real blow to Persia\nand initiated a period of hard times for the country\u2019s people. Indeed, as we shall see in a\nlater chapter, there would follow costly invasions, seven decades of civil conflict, and\nprecipitous economic decline before the country was finally able to reunify.94\n91 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 241.\n92 Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 226\u201354.\n93 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 155\u201356.\n94 Savory, Iran Under the Safavids, 226\u201354. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 78\nPersian Shi\u02bfism\nConcurrent with their efforts to create a powerful, centralized state, the Safavids\nsuccessfully imposed Shi\u02bfism on a people that had heretofore largely adhered to\nSunnism. The dynasty had done so for the purpose of legitimating its rule and had thus\nretained tight control over the religious establishment. That dominance did not last,\nhowever. Taking advantage of Safavid weakness, Shi\u02bfi religious leaders would\ngradually carve out a fully autonomous position and would achieve vast, independent\nauthority over lay Shi\u02bfa. Together, these developments would powerfully influence Iran\u2019s\nculture and the subsequent course of its history.\nAs we have seen, Shi\u02bfism had been a core element of the dynasty\u2019s early efforts\nto secure legitimacy in Iran. Initially, the Safavids had promoted a heterodox variant that\nheld that Shah Ismail was the Hidden Imam and the Murshid-i Kamil, or perfect master,\nwho had to be obeyed by his followers without question. For a time, this claim had\nearned the dynasty the unquestioned fealty of his Qizilbash supporters. As we have\nseen, however, Ismail\u2019s stunning defeat at Chaldiran in 1514 had demolished the\ncarefully developed myths that he and his supporters had crafted during his rise to\npower. The battle had thus been a double blow to the Safavid Dynasty\u2014one that had\ncost it not merely territory and prestige, but, more importantly, the religious legitimacy\non which its rule ultimately rested.95\nThe dynasty\u2019s response to this setback was shrewd and effective. The Safavids\nquickly discarded Ismail\u2019s claim to be the Murshid-i Kamil and began to throw their\nsupport behind orthodox Twelver Shi\u02bfism in hopes of using it to legitimate their\ncontinued rule. As part of that effort, the government brought Shi\u02bfi \u02bfulama\u02be from Bahrain\nand Lebanon to Iran over the next few decades and tasked them with converting\nIranians to Twelver Shi\u02bfism and with establishing a state-dominated religious hierarchy.\nFinancially dependent on the government, the Shi\u02bfi \u02bfulama\u02be worked diligently to achieve\nthese ends. They dutifully upheld Safavid legitimacy, preached that the people should\nobey the dynasty, accepted successive shahs\u2019 claims to be the Hidden Imam incarnate,\nand acted to bring Shi\u02bfism to the people of Iran. Their efforts were successful. Abetted\nby the state\u2019s vigorous persecution of Sunnis, the \u02bfulama\u02be succeeded in converting\nnearly the entire Iranian population to Shi\u02bfism by the early-seventeenth century.96\nThe close relationship between the dynasty and the Shi\u02bfi \u02bfulama\u02be did not endure\nfor long, however. Instead, as the dynasty weakened following Abbas I\u2019s reign, the\nreligious scholars became less-and-less inclined to slavishly support the Safavids. This\nchange took place very gradually. It started with the clerics reasserting their\ncommitment to the traditional view that the Hidden Imam would only reemerge from\nOccultation at the end of time. This position was a clear repudiation of one of the\nfundamental justifications for Safavid rule: that the shahs were themselves the Hidden\nImam incarnate. Later, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the religious\n95 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 241\u201342.\n96 Lapidus, 242. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 79\nscholars substantially broadened and deepened their challenge to royal dominance of\nthe clergy. Central to this effort was the development of a new claim that it was not the\nshahs but instead the mujtahids, the most learned \u02bfulama\u02be and the precursors of the\nayatollahs, who were the legitimate heads of the Shi\u02bfi community until the Hidden Imam\nreturned\u2014a position that directly challenged the monarch\u2019s authority. While that idea\ngained broad acceptance among the clergy, a minority advanced an even more extreme\nposition: that the shah should not hold authority over the mujtahids but should instead\nserve as the instrument through which those clerics effected their rulings.97\nThe \u02bfulama\u02be went much further in asserting their independence in the eighteenth\ncentury. Political and economic conditions were key to the success of this effort.\nPolitically, the absence of a central government following the collapse of the Safavid\nDynasty permitted the \u02bfulama\u02be to turn the autonomy that they had won following\nAbbas I\u2019s reign into outright independence. As a result, in contrast to their counterparts\nin the Ottoman Empire who received their salaries from the state and were thus\ndependent on it, the Shi\u02bfi clerics of Iran had achieved complete autonomy from state\nauthority by the middle of the eighteenth century. Economically, meanwhile, their ability\nto exploit agricultural land they either owned outright or controlled through a waqf (pl.\nawqaf)\u2014an inalienable piece of endowed property that supports a religious institution or\ncharitable cause\u2014ensured that they would remain financially independent even if royal\nauthority returned to Iran.98\nThe clerics had not merely secured their financial and political autonomy,\nmoreover, but had also dramatically increased their religious, moral, and legal sway\nover Iran\u2019s Shi\u02bfi majority. Their ability to win broad recognition of two significant\ntheological innovations accounted for this enhancement of their authority. First, they\ngained widespread acknowledgement of their claim that the mujtahids were sufficiently\nlearned and wise that they could exercise ijtihad; that is, they secured acceptance of the\nidea that the leading clerics were so well grounded and accomplished in fiqh, or\njurisprudence, that they were capable of rendering new interpretations of the Shi\u02bfi\nshari\u02bfa code in the name of the Hidden Imam. Second, the \u02bfulama\u02be gained popular\nadherence to their position that since lay Shi\u02bfa were incapable of grasping the hidden,\nesoteric core of the faith, they had to follow\u2014or emulate\u2014a mujtahid and to abide by\nhis rulings.99\nThus, by the time that Iran reunified at the end of the eighteenth century, the\nclergy had established themselves as a potent, independent force. Their recognized\nright to engage in ijtihad, their autonomy from the state, their success in advancing the\nclaim that the clerics were the leaders of the Shi\u02bfi community during the Occultation,\nand their insistence that lay people had to emulate one of the mujtahids afforded them\nsubstantial\u2014if still latent\u2014political power. In other words, the door was now open for\n97 Garthwaite, The Persians, 186\u201389; Nikki Keddie, Modern Iran: Roots and Results of\nRevolution (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 17\u201320.\n98 Amanat, Iran, 202; Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 469\u201370.\n99 Keddie, Modern Iran, 20. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 80\nthem to assert themselves in political affairs if they wished. For the time being, they\nrefrained from crossing that threshold. Instead, they remained focused on issues of\nreligion and the law while regarding questions of politics as the prerogative of the shah.\nAs we shall see in a later chapter, however, their restraint had its limits, and internal\ndisputes arising from the West\u2019s growing dominance of Iran in the nineteenth century\nwould eventually spur them to intrude into political affairs.100\nA Gunpowder Empire?\nAt first blush, the Safavid Empire seemed to have been very similar to its\nOttoman rival. Like its Turkish contemporary, the Iranian dynasty built its regime on the\ncore elements of a gunpowder state: a highly centralized government based on\ntraditional Muslim administrative methods and a centrally directed, firearm-equipped\narmy. In two fundamental ways, however, the Safavid Empire broke with the gunpowder\nmodel that the Ottoman Empire embodied\u2014indeed, its differences with the Ottoman\nstate were so significant that they raise questions about whether it in fact met the\ndefinition of a gunpowder state.\nFirst, unlike Osman and his descendants, the Safavids were unable to fully\ncentralize political power in their hands. In part, this failing was fiscal in nature. As\nimpressive as Abbas I\u2019s monopoly over silk exports had been, it could not supply his\ngovernment with all of the revenue it needed to pay for his army. As a consequence, the\nSafavids relied heavily on tuyul\u2014a fiscal device similar to the Ottoman timar or the\nBuyid iqta\u2014designed to sustain soldiers using land grants rather than scare tax\nrevenue. This dependence was not in itself significant; after all, the Ottoman sultans\nraised a large part of their army in a similar fashion. However, in contrast to the Sublime\nPorte\u2019s ability to prevent timar holders from making their land grants hereditary, Abbas\nI\u2019s government lacked the administrative capacity to stop the possessors of tuyuls from\nassuming ownership of the land that the state had assigned them; as a result, while the\nOttomans retained tight control over the timar holders, the Safavid state proved unable\nto prevent the gradual devolution of power to those who held tuyuls.101\nSecond, the Safavids differed substantially from the Ottomans in their adoption of\ngunpowder weapons. While their Turkish rivals acquired the vast bulk of their empire as\na direct result of their precocious embrace of firearms, the Safavids instead gained\nnearly all of their territory before they began to use guns. Indeed, they only reluctantly\nadopted firearms after their disastrous defeat at Chaldiran had demonstrated the\neffectiveness of such weapons.102\nThese are significant divergences. Indeed, they are so substantial as to suggest\nthat the substantive differences between the two empires outweighed their apparent\nsurface similarities. As a result, many scholars today conclude that the Safavid state\n100 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 470, 475\u201376.\n101 Lapidus, 237.\n102 Amanat, Iran, 56\u201359. Chapter Six: The Gunpowder Empires, 1300-1566 Page 1 81\nwas a gunpowder empire only under the most generous definition of the term and only\nduring the latter half of its existence.103\nLegacy\nThe Safavid state may not have been a full-fledged gunpowder empire, but it did\nplay a vital role in shaping Iran\u2019s future development. The dynasty established the rough\noutlines of the country\u2019s modern borders and left it with a tradition\u2014albeit a weak one\u2014\nof centralized, bureaucratic government. Above all, the Safavids established Twelver\nShi\u02bfism as the dominant religion in Iran. This last development would turn out to be\nparticularly momentous. It not only resulted in Shi\u02bfi Islam becoming a central\ncomponent of the country\u2019s national identity, but it also left Iran with a powerful,\norganized, and, above all, independent religious establishment\u2014one that was poised to\nexploit its strong position to exert a powerful voice in political affairs.104\nConclusion\nGunpowder weapons and the political centralization and efficient bureaucracies\nthey required permitted the Ottomans and, to a lesser degree, the Safavids to remake\nthe map of the Middle East. Gone were the unstable principalities, beyliks, and tribal\nconfederations of the late-medieval period. In their place, there instead stood highly\ncentralized empires that were able to maintain control over large territories using\nsophisticated, firearm-equipped military forces.\nFor a time, these regimes were mighty. In particular, as we have seen, the\nOttoman Empire stood without question as the most powerful state on Earth for much of\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. By the end of that period, however, the empire\u2019s\ndominance would begin to slip in the face of an increasingly powerful and assertive\nWest. The result would be a peculiarly trying period for the dynasty\u2014one, as we shall\nsee in the next chapter, that would compel it to make significant changes to the empire\u2019s\npolitical, economic, social, and military systems.\n103 McNeil, \u201cThe Age of Gunpowder Empires, 1450-1800,\u201d 131.\n104 Garthwaite, The Persians, 157. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768\nThe century that followed the reign of Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent (r. 1520-1566)\nwas a trying one for the Ottoman government. In sharp contrast to the seemingly\nendless success that it had heretofore enjoyed, it faced during that period a combination\nof vexing political, economic, and military problems\u2014ones that seemed at times to be\nbeyond the capacity of its existing institutions and practices to resolve. However, these\nissues did not, as historians once maintained, prove insurmountable for the empire or\ndoom it to a gradual degeneration ending in its final dissolution in 1922. Instead,\nbenefitting from a government that remained dynamic and flexible, the sultanate\nsuccessfully responded to the crises of the late-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by\ntransforming its institutions, modifying its political practices, and reconstructing its fiscal\nsystems. These adaptations were complex and at times imperfect, but they were also\nsuccessful and ensured that the empire continued to thrive well into the eighteenth\ncentury.\nThe Ottoman \u2018Time of Troubles,\u2019 1574-1656\nThe challenges that the sultanate faced were not immediately apparent under\nSul\u00ebiman the Magnificent\u2019s immediate successors, Selim II (r. 1566-1574) and Murad III\n(r. 1574-1595). Indeed, during their reigns, the Ottoman Empire appeared to be as\nstrong as ever. Domestically, its economy thrived, and its government enjoyed an\nunusual and envious degree of political stability. Its ongoing strength was even more\napparent in the realm of foreign affairs. It continued to dominate its neighbors as it had\nin the past and remained the expansionary, conquest state that it had been for the prior\nthree centuries. Most notably, between 1578 and 1590, the sultanate inflicted a series of\nsignificant defeats on its Persian rival and gained control of strategic territory in the\nCaucasus including the Safavid capital of Tabriz. While the empire was unable to make\ncomparable gains in the west at that time, it nonetheless continued to raid Austrian\nterritory regularly and posed a constant menace to the Habsburg capital of Vienna that\nlay just a few hundred kilometers from the border.1\nFor a brief moment in 1571, it is true, the empire\u2019s fortunes did appear to have\ntaken a turn for the worse. That year, the Holy League, an alliance of the Papacy,\nVenice, and Spain, destroyed nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in\nGreece\u2019s Gulf of Patras. It was a decisive victory for the league\u2014one so total that many\nEuropean observers concluded that the tide had finally turned in their long struggle\nagainst the empire. They were mistaken. Fiscally strong, the Sublime Porte was able to\nmake good the navy\u2019s losses within a matter of months and thus ensured that the\nChristians could not turn their victory into permanent control of the seas around Greece.\nLepanto thus had no immediate adverse consequences for the empire and did nothing\nto weaken its grip on the Eastern Mediterranean. Indeed, thanks to its conquest of\n1 Colin Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650: The Structure of Power, Second edition\n(New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009), 56\u201358. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 183\nCyprus from the Venetians in the same year as its defeat at Lepanto, the Ottoman\nEmpire actually improved its strategic position in the region.2\nBeginning with the reign of Mehmet III (r. 1595-1603), however, the Ottomans\nexperienced six decades of domestic and international problems that contemporaries\nreferred to as the \u201c\u2018time of troubles.\u2019\u201d This characterization was apt, for it was without\nquestion a difficult period for the empire both at home and abroad. Internationally, the\nsultan\u2019s armies found themselves bogged down in a series of long, costly, and\nfrustrating wars. Domestically, meanwhile, the empire faced a combination of\ndebilitating political factionalism, destabilizing succession issues, and fiscally draining\nrebellions in Anatolia. These were serious challenges\u2014ones that would leave it far\nweaker than it had been at the time of Selim II\u2019s accession in 1566.3\nThe Long War, 1593-1606\nThe \u201c\u2018time of troubles\u2019\u201d began with the Long War that the empire fought with\nAustria from 1593-1606. It was a frustrating conflict for the Sublime Porte\u2014one that\nfollowed a markedly different course than had earlier wars with Christian European\nstates. Rather than achieving easy victories over an outmatched and outgunned foe as\nit had in the past, the sultan\u2019s army instead found itself fought to a standstill by a potent,\ntactically sophisticated, and well-armed opponent. Indeed, the Ottomans won just a\nsingle field battle during the thirteen-year-long war, the Battle of Mezokeresztes in 1596,\nand did so only because Habsburg troops, having achieved a breakthrough, had lost\ncohesion when presented with the opportunity to loot the Ottoman camp. To a\nsubstantial degree, the problems the Ottoman army confronted were a function of the\nway that the conflict was fought. The Long War consisted for the most part not of\ndecisive field engagements, but instead of long, drawn out, and costly sieges against a\nnew, and nearly invulnerable type of fortification: the star fort. With walls too thick to be\nbattered down by artillery, the new fortresses that the Austrian military engineers\nconstructed prevented the Ottomans from achieving the sort of rapid victory that had\nbeen the hallmark of the sultan\u2019s military during the prior two centuries. Thus, unlike\nearlier wars with the Europeans that had been quickly and easily won, the Long War\nturned into an expensive stalemate\u2014one that sapped morale even as it put great\npressure on the treasury.4\nDriven to exhaustion and near their fiscal breaking points, the Habsburgs and\nOttomans agreed in 1606 to engage in talks along their common border for the purpose\nof bringing the conflict to an end. The result was the Peace of Zsitvatorok, which ended\nthe war on the principle of uti possidetis, meaning that each party retained the territory\nthat it controlled at the conclusion of the fighting. At first glance, the agreement\n2 Mark Greengrass, Christendom Destroyed: Europe 1517-1648 (New York: Penguin,\n2015), 505\u20136.\n3 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 66.\n4 Caroline Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire (New York:\nBasic Books, 2005), 174\u201375. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 184\nappeared to be a favorable one for the Sublime Porte. It did not require the empire to\ncede any land, left it in possession of Hungary and the Danubian Principalities of\nWallachia and Moldovia, and even awarded the sultan two border fortresses.\nNonetheless, European and Ottoman diplomats alike understood that the settlement\nwas a significant symbolic defeat\u2014one that reflected a seismic shift in the balance\nbetween the empire and the European states. To that point, treaties involving the\nOttoman Empire had always been negotiated in Istanbul and presented as acts of\nsultanic grace between highly unequal parties. Agreed to instead at the border and\nexplicitly acknowledging for the first time that the Habsburg emperor was of equivalent\nrank to the sultan, the Peace of Zsitvatorok announced in unambiguous language that\nthe Ottoman Empire was no longer the dominant force it had been under Sul\u00ebiman the\nMagnificent.5\nWar with the Safavids\nIn the meantime, the already stretched Ottoman military had to fight a second\nwar\u2014this time with the Safavids. For Shah Abbas I (r. 1588-1629), this conflict was one\nof revenge. Smarting from the concessions he had been forced to make to the\nOttomans in 1590, the Persian leader had spent the final decade of the sixteenth\ncentury busily reorganizing his army and reequipping it with a large force of cannons. By\nthe early 1600s, as a result, he was well positioned to take advantage of the Ottomans\u2019\npreoccupation with the Habsburg Empire to start a war aimed at recovering the\nprovinces he had been compelled to cede a decade earlier. He made his move in 1603.\nStriking boldly, his new military launched a coordinated series of attacks that quickly\noverran Ottoman forces in western Iran and the Caucasus. The Safavid invasion was a\nserious blow to the Sublime Porte. It not only cost the empire large amounts of valuable\nterritory but also threatened to unhinge the entire Ottoman position in the east. In\nresponse, Sultan Ahmed I (r. 1603-1617) ordered a powerful counterattack in 1605\naimed at recovering Tabriz. Unfortunately for him, the offensive collapsed spectacularly\nwhen Shah Abbas I destroyed the invading Ottoman forces at Sufiyan. Thereafter, the\nwar settled into another costly stalemate until it finally concluded with the Treaty of\nSerav in 1618.6\nThe stunning victories that Abbas I\u2019s reformed army won in the early years of the\nwar made manifest the extent to which Ottoman military dominance had evaporated by\nthe turn of the seventeenth century. Indeed, Safavid success at that time amounted to\nnothing less than a complete turnaround in the balance that had obtained between the\ntwo empires for nearly a century. Since the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514, Ottoman\nsupremacy in the east had been so total that successive shahs had had little choice but\nto retreat when faced with the prospects of a field battle with the sultan\u2019s army. Shah\nAbbas I\u2019s riposte thus came as a great shock to the Sublime Porte and showed\nemphatically that Ottoman forces no longer held the upper hand along the eastern\n5 Finkel, 175.\n6 Abbas Amanat, Iran: A Modern History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017), 79\u2013\n82.

By its\nterms, the Ottomans agreed to give back all the provinces they had won from Shah\nAbbas I in 1590 and to accept a return to the frontier that had existed prior to 1578\u2014a\nhuge concession for an empire that had never before yielded more than token amounts\nof territory.7\nThe Jelali Revolt\nThe outbreak of a serious rebellion in Anatolia in 1596 significantly complicated\nthe Ottoman Empire\u2019s ability to wage its simultaneous wars against the Safavid and\nHabsburg Empires. Known as the Jelali Revolt, the uprising had its roots in the\ngrievances of key provincial groups. It began when the central government seized\ntimars from sipahi who had deserted in battle in 1596; angry about losing their income,\nthe dispossessed cavalrymen responded by revolting and engaging in brigandage.\nIrregular, firearm-equipped peasants known as sekban soon joined them. These men\nhad served in the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590 and expected to become\nmembers of the ruling elite at its conclusion; instead, the government had\nunceremoniously demobilized them in a cost-cutting move. Incensed, they engaged in\nlocal banditry until the siphai revolt presented them with the opportunity to form a\ncommon front with the dispossessed cavalrymen through which both groups could\nsecure concessions from Istanbul. It was the union of these disaffected elements that\nturned the Jelali revolt into a serious threat to Ottoman control of Anatolia in the late\n1590s\u2014particularly after the governor-general of Karaman, who had been tasked with\nsuppressing the rebellion, instead assumed leadership of it.8\nAs a result, by the early years of the seventeenth century, the situation in\nAnatolia had become grim for the government. Now well led and sophisticated, the\nJelali rebels ran riot through the region. They occupied large swaths of territory,\ndefeated a succession of armies sent against them, and besieged and extorted\nimportant cities such as Ankara. Crucially, they even briefly took control of the strategic\npasses that linked Syria and Asia Minor and thus threatened the sultan\u2019s control of the\nArab Middle East.9\nThe central government\u2019s position in Anatolia only began to improve following the\nconclusion of the Long War. Using troops freed up as a result of the Peace of\nZsitvatorok, Grand Vizier Kuyuju Murad Pasha (r. 1606-1611) directed a massive\noffensive designed to finally bring the Jelali to heel. Even then the going was tough.\nOnly through the skillful use of divide-and-conquer tactics and the liberal dispensation of\n7 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 62\u201363.\n8 Douglas Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals\n(Boulder: Westview Press, 2011), 124.\n9 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 65.

These problems first emerged in 1589 when the Janissaries revolted over\na cut in their pay. Murad III suppressed their rebellion easily enough, and, to all outward\nappearances, seemed to have restored order to his government. In reality, he had done\nnothing of the sort. On the contrary, while the Ottoman state appeared to be as stable\nas ever during the ensuing decades, it had in fact begun to splinter into competing\nfactions that struggled with one another for control of the levers of power and, pivotally,\nfor influence over the sultan.11\nThe latent conflicts between the cliques finally burst into the open in 1617\nfollowing the death of Sultan Ahmed I. One faction headed by the sheikh u\u0308l-Islam, the\nhighest-ranked Muslim cleric in the empire, arranged to pass over Ahmed I\u2019s sons in\nfavor of his more-malleable, though also mentally unbalanced brother, Mustafa I\n(r. 1617-1618, 1622-1623). Mustafa I\u2019s enthronement was portentous for the empire in\ntwo ways. First, it broke with the Ottoman precedent of having sons succeed their\nfathers as sultan. Second, and more importantly, it marked a dramatic escalation in the\ninvolvement of the bureaucratic and military factions in the selection of the ruler.12\nThe result was a period of severe political volatility in Istanbul. Just three months\nafter Mustafa I assumed the throne, the Janissaries deposed him on the justifiable\ngrounds that he was mentally unstable and replaced him with one of Ahmed I\u2019s sons,\nOsman II (r. 1618-1622). The new sultan\u2019s reign did not mark a return to normalcy,\nhowever. Instead, dispensing with the obsequiousness that they had shown to previous\nrulers, competing cliques within the askeri\u2014most egregiously, the Janissaries\u2014\nschemed to control Osman II and challenged his prerogative to direct policy. By 1620,\nthe exasperated sultan had had enough. Furious about the Janissaries\u2019 heavy-handed\ninvolvement in politics, he began plotting in secret to replace them with more politically\nreliable musketeers recruited from the peasants of Anatolia. This maneuver was a\nshrewd one and might have succeeded had the Janissaries remained unaware of his\nefforts. Unfortunately for Osman II, however, the well-connected soldiers sniffed out his\nplan before he could put it into effect. Moving quickly to defend their status and position,\nthey dethroned and executed him in 1622. They followed by briefly returning the\n10 Imber, 65.\n11 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 177\u201378.\n12 Finkel, 177\u201378, 196\u201397. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 187\nmentally disturbed Mustafa I to the throne before once more deposing him in favor of\nanother of Ahmed I\u2019s sons, Murad IV (r. 1623-1640).13\nThe empire rapidly descended into chaos following Osman II\u2019s murder. Taking\nadvantage of their military power and the fact that their barracks were adjacent to the\npalace, the Janissaries demanded and received a substantial accession donation\u2014\nfunctionally a bribe\u2014from the new sultan to ensure their continued loyalty; they followed\nby further destabilizing the already-shaky political system by deposing a succession of\ngrand viziers. These actions benefited the Janissaries in the short term, but they were\nenormously unpopular and produced a backlash in the provinces. The governor of\nErzurum, Mehmet Pasha (1576-1634), soon gave focus to that anger. Declaring that he\nsought to avenge the murder of Osman II, he raised a revolt that quickly secured control\nof large parts of Asia Minor including the important cities of Sivas, Bursa and Ankara. To\nthe delight of many people, he also ordered the execution of any Janissaries found in\nthe territory he controlled on grounds that they were complicit in Osman II\u2019s murder.\nShort of funds as a result of the accession bonus given to the Janissaries, the central\ngovernment could offer no meaningful response to this new challenge.14\nThe crisis the Ottomans faced soon worsened dramatically. Taking advantage of\nthe paralysis in the Sublime Porte and the unrest in Asia Minor, Shah Abbas I invaded\nOttoman Iraq in 1623 and laid siege to Baghdad. To his delight, his soldiers took\npossession of the city early the next year. It was a shocking blow to Ottoman prestige\u2014\none that brought into clear focus the problems that the central government\u2019s paralysis\nhad created.15\nMurad IV\u2014Recovery\nSurprisingly, in light of the fact that he was only twelve when he took the throne,\nthe new sultan, Murad IV, was able to provide the effective leadership needed to restore\ninternal order and the empire\u2019s territorial integrity. That he would be successful in doing\nso was far from obvious during the early years of his reign. While he had been able to\nquickly bring the revolt in Anatolia to heel, his effort to retake Baghdad in the early\n1630s had ended in defeat. Worse, his subsequent decision to sack the popular grand\nvizier who had commanded the failed campaign in Iraq, Husrev Pasha (?-1631), had\nincited the Janissaries to revolt once again. Thus, by the early 1630s, the situation in\nIstanbul appeared to have reverted to the chaos that had obtained in the early 1620s.\nIndeed, most observers had come to conclude that the sultan was a weak leader\u2014one\n13 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 55.\nDouglas A. Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2017), 146\u201347.\n14 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 202\u20135.\n15 Gene R. Garthwaite, The Persians (Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2005), 174. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 188\nwho was powerless either to prevent the empire from descending further into disorder\nand instability, or, more immediately, from avoiding the same fate as Osman II.16\nIn this case, however, appearances were deceiving. Murad IV in fact proved to\nbe a remarkably effective ruler who\u2014aided, as we shall see, by his capable mother\u2014\ndeftly outmaneuvered the Janissaries as the first step in a successful campaign\ndesigned to reassert sultanic control over the empire. His effort to deal with the soldiers\u2019\nuprising was smartly planned and executed. He initially responded with a shrewd\ntactical retreat in which he appeared solicitous and agreed to meet their main demands.\nConcluding from the episode that the sultan would not challenge them, the mollified\nJanissaries stood down\u2014just as Murad IV had hoped they would. Taking advantage of\nthe breathing space he had created for himself, he followed by quietly securing allies\nfrom among those factions that resented the soldiers\u2019 dominance of the government.\nThen, having solidified his position in this way, he had the rebellion\u2019s leaders arrested\nand executed.17\nHe followed with a flurry of initiatives designed to restore internal order and to\nreassert the empire\u2019s dominance of its borders. He pursued a series of reforms to the\nsystem of taxation, moved to impose stringent new moral regulations, and acted to\nsubdue brigands who had exploited the anarchy in the capital to ravage Anatolia. He\nalso personally led a campaign against the Safavids in 1638 aimed at reconquering\nBaghdad. Murad IV was successful in all of these initiatives. As a result, he was not only\nable to cement his control of the government, but also to end the instability that had\ndogged the Sublime Porte since Ahmed I\u2019s death in 1617. Indeed, by the time his reign\ncame to a close in 1640, he had so thoroughly reestablished order that his subjects\nhailed him as the restorer of the empire.18\nIbrahim the Mad\nInitially, the recovery that Murad IV had achieved continued under his successor,\nIbrahim, (r. 1640-1648). It did so thanks not to the skilled leadership of the sultan\u2014who\nwas already demonstrating signs of mental instability\u2014but instead to the tactful and\neffective guidance of his grand vizier, Kemankesh Mustafa (1592-1644). Sidelining\nIbrahim, Kemankesh Mustafa was able to keep the factions in check and to maintain the\nempire\u2019s international position. As a result, the first four years of Ibrahim\u2019s tenure\npassed uneventfully.19\nA pair of unrelated events in 1644 shattered the calm, however, and ushered in\nanother difficult period for the empire. First, a faction headed by Ibrahim\u2019s charismatic,\nspiritualist advisor, the charlatan Jinji Hoja (?- 1648), used its influence with the sultan\n16 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 69\u201371.\n17 Imber, 69\u201371.\n18 Imber, 69\u201371.\n19 Leslie P. Peirce, The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman\nEmpire (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 246. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 189\nto have Kemankesh Mustafa executed\u2014thus paving the way for it to assume control of\nthe levers of power. Interested primarily in enriching themselves, the men provided little\neffective leadership and imposed no check on the sultan\u2019s increasingly erratic actions.\nSecond, the empire started a war that year that quickly transformed into a costly\nquagmire. The conflict began when Maltese corsairs seized a ship carrying a high-\nranking Ottoman official. Briefly stopping at the Venetian-controlled Island of Crete, the\npirates issued a ransom demand before quickly spiriting their captive to Malta. The\nsultan and his advisors were furious. Believing that the slight could not go unpunished,\nthey mobilized the fleet and army for a retaliatory attack. They did not target Malta,\nhowever; instead, using the alleged complicity of the Venetians in the incident as a\npretext, they invaded the valuable and strategically located island of Crete. Catching the\ndefenders by surprise, the Ottoman army quickly overran all of the island save for the\nheavily fortified port city of Candia.20\nThe fortunes of war soon turned against the Ottomans, however. Venice may not\nhave been the power it once was, but it still possessed a formidable fleet that could ferry\na steady stream of supplies to the garrison in Candia; as a result, the city was able to\nhold out for an astonishing twenty-five years despite being besieged by a huge Ottoman\narmy. More damagingly, in 1647 and 1648, the Venetians used their powerful navy to\nblockade the critical Dardanelles Strait that connected the capital to the Aegean Sea.\nThe closure of the waterway was a huge blow to the empire. It not only prevented\nOttoman soldiers on Crete from receiving desperately needed supplies, but also inflicted\nserious economic hardship and food shortages on the people of Istanbul.21\nMeanwhile, at the same time that the empire was suffering setbacks against the\nVenetians, Ibrahim\u2019s sanity began to deteriorate rapidly. The decline in his mental\nhealth came in the context of his effort to meet a pressing dynastic need. Social and\npolitical order in the empire depended on the unifying symbol of the Ottoman family; as\nIbrahim was the sole remaining Ottoman male, however, the dynasty on which stability\nrested was in danger of ending. Accordingly, to ensure that the line did not die out, his\nadvisors pressed him to make siring sons a high priority. Sexual relations were a\npleasant obligation for Ibrahim at first; after 1644, though, they evolved from a dynastic\nnecessity into an all-consuming personal fetish. Ignoring his official duties, the sultan\nsoon spent all of his time in the harem\u2014the part of a Muslim household reserved for\nwomen and children\u2014in the company of a growing roster of concubines recruited to\nmeet his particular sexual tastes. Given his mental-health issues, the sultan\u2019s absence\nfrom the divan would likely have been more of a help than a hindrance to the Ottoman\nstate. However, his desire to lavish costly gifts on his sexual partners\u2014he insisted on\ncarpeting the palace of one of his favorites with fabulously expensive sable furs\u2014posed\n20 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 223\u201327.\n21 Finkel, 227. Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and\nMughals, 56\u201357. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 190\ngrowing problems because they could only be met by raising taxes on the empire\u2019s\nalready overburdened subjects.22\nThose levies contributed to a spectacular crash in support for Ibrahim. Coming at\na time of blockade-induced food shortages and lurid rumors of the sultan\u2019s sexual\nexcesses, the imposition of new taxes to pay for the luxuries he showered on his\nconcubines soon cost him the backing of the residents of the capital. More importantly,\nthe sultan\u2019s fumbling rule and his government\u2019s inability to bring the war with Venice to a\nsuccessful conclusion increasingly alienated key factions in the government and led\nmany to conclude that the sultan had to go. Once again, it was the Janissaries who took\nthe lead. Fed up with Ibrahim\u2019s poor rule, the soldiers secured a fatwa, or legal ruling,\nfrom the sheikh u\u0308l-Islam in August 1848 authorizing them to depose and kill the\nincreasingly unbalanced sultan. They followed by arranging for his six-year-old son,\nMehmet IV (r. 1648-1687), to succeed him.23\nWhile a great relief to the people of the capital, the murder of Ibrahim did not\nresult in a return to the stability of Murad IV\u2019s reign. Instead, the empire experienced\neight more years of upheaval in what seemed like a replay of the anarchic 1620s.\nMounting resentment of the Janissaries\u2019 dominance of the government resulted in the\noutbreak of yet another rebellion in Asia Minor while stepped-up factional infighting in\nthe capital left the central government incapable of providing effective rule. Even the\nstreets of the capital experienced disorder. Angry over new taxes and a costly\ndebasement of the currency, the residents of the city repeatedly vented their anger by\nrioting.24\nBy 1656, the crisis had reached a boiling point. Factionalism and instability in the\ngovernment had metastasized to the point that the grand vizirate had become a\nrevolving door: indeed, no fewer than seven different men occupied the post between\nMay 1655 and October 1656 including one, Zurnazen Mustafa Pasha, who served for a\nmere four hours. Meanwhile, the soldiers chose this difficult period to launch yet another\nrevolt\u2014one that, predictably, further paralyzed the central government. Finally, and\nmost shockingly, Venice inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ottoman fleet in the summer\nof 1656 that permitted it to seize the islands of Lemnos and Bozcaada and, with them,\ncontrol of the Dardanelles Strait. Times were very dark indeed.25\nSources of Ottoman Weakness\nThe Venetian victory in 1656 made clear to observers both inside and outside the\nOttoman Empire that the sultanate was no longer the dominant power it had once been.\n22 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 70\u201372.\n23 Jason Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire (New York:\nHenry Holt and Company, 1998), 226\u201327.\n24 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 236\u201346.\n25 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 168; Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History\nof the Ottoman Empire, 247\u201353. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 191\nWhat accounted for its reversal of fortune? How did a state so overwhelmingly strong in\n1566 that it could dominate all its frontiers find itself facing defeat at the hands of tiny\nVenice not even a century later? Paradoxically, the difficulties that the Ottomans\nexperience during the first half of the seventeenth century were related to the peculiar\ncharacteristics that had facilitated the empire\u2019s meteoric rise. Put simply, many of the\nstrengths that had fueled the sultanate\u2019s stunning growth and transformation during its\nearly years had, by the seventeenth century, become relative or absolute liabilities.\nEconomic and Fiscal Issues\nThe first area of strength that transformed into a weakness was the economy. As\nnoted in chapter six, the early Ottoman Empire had benefited from several centuries of\nsteady economic expansion. Its rising population, the development of new trade routes,\nthe cultivation of new land, and the monetization of exchange in rural areas\u2014that is, the\nshift from barter to cash-based transactions\u2014had combined to produce substantial\ngrowth. Following Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent\u2019s reign, however, the empire\u2019s economy\nbegan to stagnate. The rise in population slowed, trade plateaued, and, as the marginal\nutility of new land brought under the plow steadily decreased, the growth in agricultural\nproductivity stalled.26\nMaking matters worse, the Ottoman economy began to experience at that time\nwhat scholars refer to as the Price Revolution: a general period of inflation in western\nEurasia caused by the influx into Europe of large quantities of gold and silver from the\nAmericas. While the effect of the sudden rise in the supply of precious metal on the\nempire was substantially more limited than its impact on Western Europe\u2014and far-less\nconsequential than historians once believed\u2014it nonetheless fueled a steady rise in\nprices that further contributed to the dampening of commercial activity in the sultanate.27\nUnsurprisingly, the Ottoman government began to experience significant fiscal\nshortfalls at this time. As we have seen, these deficits had little precedent. Through the\nearly 1580s, the Sublime Porte had regularly enjoyed substantial budget surpluses and\nhad thus found itself in an unusual and envious fiscal position. Thanks to the sultanate\u2019s\nsubsequent economic stagnation, however, the tax receipts that had steadily grown in\nearlier times now stopped rising. Worse, since the empire levied taxes on a nominal\nbasis\u2014meaning that its assessments did not rise along with inflation\u2014the Price\nRevolution meant that existing tax revenue declined in real terms.28\nThree other issues further exacerbated the Ottoman Empire\u2019s worsening fiscal\nsituation. First, beginning in the early-seventeenth century, the growing oceanic\nexchange between Asia and Europe that had started with Vasco da Gama\u2019s (c. 1460s-\n1524) arrival in Calicut in 1498 finally began to eclipse the Silk Road trade that passed\n26 Sevket Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2000), 125\u201332.\n27 Pamuk, 125\u201332.\n28 Pamuk, 128, 138\u201339. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 192\nthrough the Ottoman Empire. As a result, the customs revenue that the overland trade\nhad heretofore provided began a long, gradual decline. Second, in contrast to the earlier\nwars of expansion that had generated a steady inflow of loot to the treasury and had\nthus largely paid for themselves, the conflicts of the late-sixteenth century constituted a\nsignificant drain on the exchequer. The Long War with the Habsburgs, The conflict with\nthe Safavids, and, especially, the naval contest with the Holy League from 1570-1573\nwere all extremely costly ventures that rapidly consumed the treasury\u2019s surplus even as\nthey failed to generate compensatory revenue in the form of plunder.29\nFinally, thanks to the empire\u2019s worsening fiscal situation, an existing but\nheretofore manageable peculiarity of the Ottoman fiscal calendar began to pose a\nserious, if periodic, challenge to the exchequer in the late-sixteenth century. This\nproblem was a function of an unusual disparity between the treasury\u2019s receipt and\ndisbursement of funds. It collected taxes on a solar calendar\u2014a necessity in an\nagricultural economy\u2014but paid salaries to its troops and officials on a quarterly basis\naccording to the Muslim lunar calendar. As the lunar calendar is eleven days shorter\nthan a solar year, the Ottoman treasury thus had to pay roughly thirty-three years of\nsalary every thirty-two years; in other words, every eighth year, it had to come up with a\nfifth quarter\u2019s worth of salaries. During the sultanate\u2019s astonishing rise, this issue had\nbeen a manageable one for the treasury. Finding the extra funds every eighth year had\nsimply not been an issue when the sultan\u2019s army was bringing in vast extra revenue in\nthe form of loot. As we have seen, however, the sultanate had stopped growing in the\nlate-sixteenth century; as a result, the octennial need to find the excess funds to pay an\nextra quarter\u2019s worth of salaries would constitute a serious challenge for the increasingly\nstrapped treasury.30\nAggravated by the long and expensive Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590 and\nby the lingering costs of the new fleet it had to construct after the Battle of Lepanto, the\nbill finally came due in the mid 1580s. Desperate to secure enough coinage to meet its\nexpenses, the treasury instituted a draconian, 44 percent debasement of the currency,\nthe silver akce coin, in 1585-1586. This devaluation gave the government the funds it\nneeded to meet its obligations, but it also produced a destabilizing surge in inflation that\nhit bureaucrats and soldiers\u2014including the Janissaries\u2014with peculiar severity. More\nimportantly, the dramatic depreciation of the currency set in motion a vicious fiscal-\neconomic cycle. Thereafter, debasement and monetary instability produced inflation that\ndepressed the economy; the resulting decline in economic activity in turn reduced real\ntax receipts, which then exacerbated the fiscal crisis and impelled the treasury to pursue\nfurther debasements.31\n29 Pamuk, 131\u201332, 139.\n30 Halil Sahillioglu, \u201cSivis Year Crises in the Ottoman Empire,\u201d in Studies in the\nEconomic History of the Middle East: From the Rise of Islam to the Present Day, ed. M.\nA. Cook (New York: Routledge, 1970), 230\u201349.\n31 Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 135, 141, 147\u201348. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 193\nThus, by the early-seventeenth century, the empire\u2019s fiscal and commercial\nposition had grown bleak. Its once-expanding economy had stalled, and its treasury\nofficials grappled with steadily worsening budget deficits that they only belatedly\ngrasped could not be resolved through further debasements. It was a difficult situation\nfor the sultanate\u2014one made worse by virtue of the fact that both the economy and the\nstate\u2019s fiscal standing had so recently been among its core strengths.\nWeak Sultans\nThe empire might have had greater success resolving the fiscal crisis of the late-\nsixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries had it continued to enjoy strong leadership.\nUnfortunately, the succession of highly capable rulers that began with Osman I (r. 1299-\n1326) ended following the death of Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent. Indeed, after a brief\nstretch of merely lackluster sultans\u2014Murad IV excepted\u2014the empire would experience\na nearly unbroken, century-long string of weak rulers who were unable to provide\neffective direction of the Sublime Porte.32\nOn the surface, two factors explain the decline in sultanic leadership. First, as we\nhave seen, two of the sultans who reigned during the next century, Mustafa I and\nIbrahim, suffered from severe mental instability; as such, they proved incapable of\ndirecting the affairs of state. Second, nearly all of the others who reigned during the\nseventeenth century came to power as children. Mehmet IV was seven when he\nbecame sultan, for example, while Osman II and Ahmed I were each thirteen at the time\nthey acceded to the throne. Unsurprisingly, the child sultans had a difficult time\nasserting themselves over the factions that had come to dominate the bureaucracy and\ncourt. Murad IV, of course, had broken this pattern and had enjoyed a successful reign\ndespite becoming sultan at the age of nine; however, he was very much the exception.\nIndeed, he was the only genuinely effective ruler between Mehmet III\u2019s death in 1603\nand Sul\u00ebiman II\u2019s (r. 1687-1691) accession to the throne more than eighty-years later.33\nYouth may have been a contributing factor in the decline in sultanic leadership,\nbut a fundamental change in the succession process in the early-seventeenth century\nproved far-more consequential. Beginning with the accession of Ahmed I in 1603, the\naskeri adopted a new system for selecting sultans that ended the practice of fratricidal\nsuccession that had worked so effectively since the late-fourteenth century to ensure\nthat the empire enjoyed strong leadership. Where the old system had involved a\nDarwinian contest among the heirs that ended with the winner executing his fraternal\nrivals, the new arrangement instead spared the sultan\u2019s brothers by giving the\nbureaucrats and courtiers the power to select the new leader. To ensure that the\npassed-over heirs did not possess powerbases from which they could challenge the\nrecently installed ruler, the new system also ended the practice of having the sultan\u2019s\nsons gain administrative experience by serving as provincial governors. Instead, all of\nthe heirs, including the next sultan, led pampered lives of ease and pleasure in the\n32 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 165\u201366.\n33 Finkel, 165\u201366. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 194\nluxurious, unreal atmosphere of the Gilded Cage\u2014the name given to the imperial\nharem\u2014where they acquired no sense of the real world and easily fell under the\ninfluence of powerful courtiers.34\nWhy did the Ottomans adopt this new method of succession if it failed to produce\nleaders of the same caliber as the fratricidal system? They did so for two reasons. First,\nat only thirteen-years of age, Ahmed I had not yet fathered any heirs when he became\nsultan; killing his brother Mustafa I thus ran the risk of ending the dynasty and sparking\na period of anarchy and crisis. Second, popular revulsion at the practice of royal\nfratricide had begun to surge in the late-sixteenth century. The line of five, child-sized\ncoffins wheeled out of Topkapi Palace on the day that Murad III acceded to the\nsultanate, and, even more so, the train of nineteen caskets that emerged when\nMehmet III took the throne shocked the people of Istanbul and compelled the askeri to\nadopt the new system.35\nWhile the new arrangement may have been more humane, it was also much less\neffective at producing capable rulers than the fratricidal system it replaced. Raised in\nthe luxurious, fantastical environment of the Gilded Cage, the sultans of the\nseventeenth century were ill-equipped to respond effectively to the increasingly serious\nchallenges confronting the empire. Bereft of practical experience or even a realistic\ngrasp of the world in which they lived, they were figureheads rather than actual rulers\u2014\nthe creatures of competing factions of bureaucrats, \u02bfulama\u02be, Janissaries, eunuchs, and\ncourtiers rather than leaders in their own right. Thus, thanks to the abandonment of the\nsystem of fratricidal succession\u2014the sultanate\u2014another of the empire\u2019s early sources\nof strength, had become a significant source of weakness.36\nMilitary Problems\nAs the Long War and the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603-1618 made clear, even\nthe empire\u2019s vaunted military, its most obvious strength during its rise to power, had lost\nits edge. This change marked an enormous shift in the military balance. During the\nconflicts of the early- and mid-sixteenth century, the sultan\u2019s army had easily dominated\nits enemies on every front. By the turn of the century, in contrast, the balance between\nthe Ottoman military and the armies of its rivals had shifted to such a degree that\nHabsburg forces had been able to fight the sultan\u2019s soldiers to a draw while Shah\nAbbas I\u2019s Safavid troops had outright trounced them. What had happened during the\nlate-sixteenth century? Why was the Ottoman military no longer able to defeat its\nenemies as it had in the past?\nFirst, to be clear, the change in the military balance between the empire and its\nrivals was not indicative of a general decline in the efficacy of the sultan\u2019s army. The\n34 Donald Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, Second Edition (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2005), 91\u201393.\n35 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 95\u2013101.\n36 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 92. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 195\nOttoman military of the early-seventeenth century remained a potent, well-led, and well-\nsupplied force. Indeed, it was every bit as powerful as it had been when Selim II had\ntriumphed so spectacularly over the Safavids at Chaldiran in 1514 or when Sul\u00ebiman\nthe Magnificent had crushed the Hungarians in 1526.37\nRather, the empire experienced a relative decline in military power\u2014due not to\nits shortcomings or lack of discipline but instead to significant improvements in the\narmies of its European and Persian rivals. As earlier noted, Shah Abbas I had\nmodernized the Safavid military in the 1590s in part by dramatically increasing the\nnumber of cannons it employed; by the early-seventeenth century, as a result, his\ntroops were able to go toe-to-toe with Ottoman forces. European armies improved to an\neven greater degree relative to the Ottomans due to the Military Revolution, a series of\ntechnological and organizational changes among European armies that dramatically\naltered the way wars were fought. It involved four major changes: the deployment of\nmuch-larger armies, the use of powerful new weapons such as muskets and field guns,\nthe adoption of innovative and devastating new tactics such as volley fire\u2014a technique\nthat permitted a formation to shoot continuously\u2014and the construction of new, star-\nshaped, trace italienne-style bastion forts, which, as the Ottoman military discovered\nduring the Long War, were nearly impervious to artillery fire. These were dramatic\nchanges. They not only allowed European militaries to close the gap with the Ottoman\narmy by the turn of the seventeenth century but gave them the ability thereafter to fight\nit on an even footing. Thus, while the sultan\u2019s armies were as strong as ever, they no\nlonger enjoyed the relative advantage that the empire\u2019s early adoption of gunpowder\nweapons had previously afforded.38\nThat said, two critical components of the Ottoman military, the sipahis and the\nJanissaries, did decline in effectiveness between the early-sixteenth and the start of the\neighteenth centuries. The sipahis were the first to lose their edge. The bow-armed\nprovincial cavalry had gradually become obsolete over the course of the sixteenth\ncentury as a result of the growing adoption and increasingly sophisticated employment\nof gunpowder weapons; however, the continued success of Ottoman armies masked\ntheir decline. Indeed, it was only during the Long War that their military\nineffectiveness\u2014particularly in the face of massed formations of musket-armed\ninfantry\u2014fully manifested itself and made clear that they were rapidly becoming an\nanachronism on the battlefield.39\nThe Janissary corps\u2019 decline was more gradual. Its devolution began in 1566\nwhen the Janissaries won the right to marry and to produce legal heirs. Eager to ensure\nthat their children inherited their askeri status, they followed by winning modifications to\nthe traditional system of recruitment that permitted their sons to join the corps. These\n37 Virginia H. Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870 (Harlow, England: Routledge, 2007),\n45.\n38 Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West,\n1500-1800, Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 6\u201324.\n39 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 292\u201393. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 196\nchanges gradually transformed the Janissaries over the next century. Indeed, by the\ntime Sultan Ahmed III formally abolished the devshirme in 1703, the corps had long\nsince completed its shift from a meritocratic institution beholden to the sultan into an\nhereditary one dedicated to furthering its parochial interests.40\nThe debasement-induced inflation that began in the late-sixteenth century\naccelerated the Janissary corps\u2019 decline. As we have seen, the series of debasements\nthat the treasury had undertaken beginning in the late-sixteenth century had brutally\neroded the purchasing power of the Janissaries\u2019 salaries. In response, the soldiers\nbegan to supplement their pay by taking jobs as porters or butchers or by opening small\nbusinesses. Ostensibly, the Janissaries were employed in those positions on a part-time\nbasis for the purpose of offsetting the decline in their wages. In reality, their side jobs\nwere full-time obligations that left scant time for them to train or otherwise fulfill their\nofficial duties.41\nThe end of the devshirme system and the Janissaries\u2019 adoption of wage-earning\nwork proved doubly harmful to the empire. First, the transformation of the Janissaries\nfrom elite soldiers into full-time workers led to a dramatic decline in their military\neffectiveness between 1600 and 1750. Abandoning the training and discipline that had\nbeen so critical to their earlier success in order to work their civilian jobs, the Janissaries\ndevolved into a completely ineffective military force and eventually stopped going on\ncampaign altogether. Paradoxically, even as the corps\u2019 military capabilities declined, its\npolitical influence reached new heights. No longer bound to the sultan as they had been\nwhen they were slaves recruited through the devshirme system, they were now in a\nposition to use their monopoly over military power in the capital to raise and overthrow\nsultans at will. This they did with abandon. Between 1618 and 1730, either alone or in\nconjunction with other cliques, they deposed Mustafa I\u2014twice\u2014Mehmet IV, Mustafa II\n(r. 1695-1703), and Ahmed III; meanwhile, they had not merely dethroned Osman II and\nIbrahim the Mad but had also executed them.42\nIn recent decades, scholars have significantly complicated this understanding of\nthe Janissaries. While still acknowledging the corps\u2019 declining martial abilities and its\ndestructive meddling in the succession, they have shown that it also served an\nimportant social role in the capital as the populist protector of the urban common\npeople. Two peculiar characteristics allowed it to do so. First, in contrast to nearly all\nother groups, the Janissaries were members of both the askeri elite and the urban\nworking class; as such, they were in a unique position to mediate between their lower-\nclass brethren and the Sublime Porte. Second, they held a monopoly on military power\nin the capital and were thus well positioned to compel the sultan\u2019s government to alter\npolicies perceived as harmful to urban workers. The corps began to assume its role as a\npopulist intermediary body early in the eighteenth century. Thereafter, it frequently\nexploited its dominant military position in the capital to compel the Sublime Porte to\n40 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 45.\n41 Quataert, 45.\n42 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 202, 251. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 197\nabolish laws and policies that impinged on the welfare of the urban lower class\u2014\nparticularly those that harmed the interests of the artisan guilds that employed many of\nthe Janissaries.43\nThe corps\u2019 new role as an intermediary body may have been important, but it\ncould not offset the fact that the Janissaries and their sipahi comrades no longer\ndominated the battlefield as they had during the Ottoman rise to power. By the end of\nthe seventeenth century, the decline of those forces had become obvious. The sipahis\ntroopers who had once nimbly outmaneuvered heavier cavalry and routed infantry\nduring the empire\u2019s early years were now almost completely obsolete. More\ndramatically, the Janissary corps had not merely lost its military dominance but had, in\nthe words of the historian Donald Quataert, devolved from being \u201cthe terror of its foreign\nfoes to the terror of the sultans.\u201d In short, two more institutions that had been vital to the\ndynasty\u2019s early success had, by the eighteenth century, instead become liabilities.44\nThe Capitulations\nMeanwhile, though they had little immediate impact, a series of bilateral trade\nagreements called Capitulations that the Sublime Porte entered into with several\nEuropean states beginning in the late-sixteenth century would have important long-term\nramifications for the empire. Based on earlier Byzantine commercial treaties, the\nCapitulations provided merchants from signatory states with special privileges while\noperating in the sultanate. Thanks to those treaties, they enjoyed extraterritoriality, or\nimmunity from Ottoman laws, and exemption from the payment of local taxes.45\nThe Capitulations served the Sublime Porte\u2019s interests in two ways. First, they\nprovided a means of locating European traders within the broader social, political, and\neconomic structure of the empire. As non-Ottoman subjects, merchants from the\ncapitulatory states were neither entitled to the benefits of Ottoman law nor permitted to\naccess the courts of the empire\u2019s recognized socioreligious communities; they thus\nlacked legal standing and protection while operating in the sultanate. The Capitulations\nsolved this problem by creating what were in essence new millets headed by the\nmonarchs of the states from which the merchants came. Second, the agreements were\nan attractive concession that the Sublime Porte could grant to European states with\nwhich it hoped to conclude diplomatic agreements. Indeed, the Ottoman state granted\nthe first Capitulation to France in 1569 as a reward for allying with the empire against\ntheir common Habsburg enemy. For similar reasons, the Sublime Porte entered into a\ncapitulatory agreement with Britain in 1579 that opened trade in the empire to the\nroyally chartered Levant Company.46\n43 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 47\u201348.\n44 Quataert, 45.\n45 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 166.\n46 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 78\u201379. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 198\nAt the time they were signed, the Capitulations did not appear to be terribly\nsignificant politically or even economically. The volume of trade was small, and the\nempire was much stronger than the capitulatory states. As such, the Sublime Porte\ncould easily abrogate the agreements at no cost if it wished. Unbeknownst to Ottoman\nofficials in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries, however, the\nCapitulations posed a latent, long-term threat to the empire\u2019s political independence and\neconomic health. Were the balance between the sultanate and the European kingdoms\nto reverse, those states would not only be able to use the Capitulations to assume a\ndominant position in the empire\u2019s economy but would have the military strength to\nprevent the Sublime Porte from revoking the agreements. In other words, the\nCapitulations constituted a ticking time bomb for the empire, one slated to explode if\nand when\u2014paradoxically\u2014the Sublime Porte was too weak to end them.47\nThe Historical Debate: Decline or Adaptation?\nFor a long time, the \u201cOttoman decline thesis\u201d\u2014the view that the Ottoman Empire\nexperienced a gradual, inexorable degeneration that began with the conclusion of\nSul\u00ebiman the Magnificent\u2019s reign and that ended with the sultanate\u2019s dissolution in\n1922\u2014dominated the historical literature. While Western scholars of the mid-twentieth\ncentury are most commonly associated with this interpretation, it is in fact a very old\nidea that originated in the empire itself. Indeed, the people who first advanced it were\nthe seventeenth-century writers of Nasihatname, or Advice of King, literature\u2014political\ncommentaries designed to influence how the Ottoman Dynasty governed. Coming\nlargely from the bureaucratic class, these authors argued that the \u201c\u2018time of troubles\u2019\u201d\nwas a direct product of the ineffective leadership of the sultans who succeeded\nSul\u00ebiman the Magnificent. Interpreting the world through the lens of the Circle of\nJustice, they maintained that the rulers of the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth\ncenturies were degenerate, pleasure-seeking men who had failed to rule justly or to\nmaintain order; as a result, the peasants suffered, tax receipts fell, and the strength of\nthe military waned. How could the empire regain its equilibrium? The Nasihatname\nwriters argued that the answer was obvious: it could do so only through the return of\neffective, moral leadership at the top.48\nInitially, the Nasihatname concept of Ottoman decline was not widely known.\nWritten by a modest number of officials for an equivalently small audience of sultans\nand top leaders, it remained confined largely to the bureaucratic class. However, the\nidea that the empire was in decline gradually spread\u2014first to a wider audience within\nthe Ottoman world and then, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to Europe.\n47 Quataert, 78\u201379.\n48 Jane Hathaway and with contributions by Karl Barbir, The Arab Lands under Ottoman\nRule: 1516-1800 (New York: Routledge, 2013), 8; Douglas A. Howard, \u201cGenre and Myth\nin the Ottoman Advice for Kings Literature,\u201d in The Early Modern Ottomans: Remapping\nthe Empire, ed. Virginia H. Aksan and Daniel Goffman (New York: Cambridge University\nPress, 2007), 150. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 199\nThere, with the Ottoman Empire\u2019s relative weakness as a backdrop, it soon began to\nshape Western interpretations of the sultanate\u2019s troubles.49\nIt was not until the mid-twentieth century, however, that the Ottoman decline\nthesis fully took shape. Seeking to explain the empire\u2019s apparent failure to modernize,\nWestern scholars writing after World War II drew heavily on the Nasihatname literature\nto argue that a shift from strong to weak sultans beginning in the late-sixteenth century\nled ineluctably to the decentralization of political power and to the broader degeneration\nof the empire. The most influential of these writers was the Princeton historian Bernard\nLewis. He contended that the lack of effective leadership in the late-sixteenth and early-\nseventeenth centuries resulted in the gradual and irreversible decay of key structures\nand institutions within the empire. The bureaucracy slid into venality and corruption, the\nmilitary lost its discipline, the local elites carved the provinces into semiautonomous\nfiefdoms, and the economy gradually stagnated under the weight of corrupt tax\ncollectors until, unable to defend its territory from the increasingly dynamic and modern\nWest, the empire finally collapsed in 1922. Thus, to proponents of the Ottoman decline\nthesis such as Lewis, the empire\u2019s demise was the inevitable result of the military,\neconomic, bureaucratic, and even cultural decadence that had begun with the shift to\nweak sultanic leadership in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries.50\nWhile the Ottoman decline thesis dominated understandings of the empire in the\n1950s and 1960s, it began to face mounting criticism from a new generation of scholars\nafter 1970. They started by critiquing the logic that underlay it. Most pointedly, they\nnoted that the idea that decline in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries led\ndirectly to the empire\u2019s collapse in the 1920s was a teleological fallacy: a flawed form of\nreasoning that interprets all past events as the causes of an inevitable final outcome. In\ntheir eyes, such thinking ignored the many obvious ways in which the Ottoman situation\nimproved after 1650, and, more problematically, denied agency to people living in later\ntimes.51\nThose scholars followed by reexamining the primary sources of the late-sixteenth\nand early-seventeenth centuries. Here, they concluded that the evidence simply did not\nsustain the idea that the empire had degenerated. Most notably, they found that the\nwriters who composed the Nasihatname literature were not offering unbiased or even\nrealistic assessments of the issues that the empire confronted during the \u201c\u2018time of\ntroubles.\u2019\u201d Rather, their arguments reflected either the broader complaints of the\nbureaucratic class, or, more frequently, their own personal grievances; as such, their\nclaims of imperial decay cannot be taken at face value. These scholars similarly saw\nsuccess rather than weakness or degeneracy in the military\u2019s performance in the\nconflicts of the early-seventeenth century. They acknowledged that the empire\u2019s inability\nto achieve a decisive victory over the Habsburgs, the Safavids, and the Jelali\n49 Howard, \u201cGenre and Myth in the Ottoman Advice for Kings Literature,\u201d 150.\n50 Bernard Lewis, \u201cSome Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,\u201d Studia\nIslamica, no. 9 (1958): 111\u201327.\n51 Howard, \u201cGenre and Myth in the Ottoman Advice for Kings Literature,\u201d 137\u201366. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 200\ndemonstrated that its overwhelming dominance of the battlefield had become a thing of\nthe past. At the same time, however, they also contended that the very fact that the\nsultanate could wage war simultaneously on three fronts was indicative of the Ottoman\nstate\u2019s ongoing strength and resilience rather than a sign of its stagnation or\nweakness.52\nBy the 1980s, historians arguing along these lines had fully repudiated the\nOttoman decline thesis. While acknowledging that the empire experienced a period of\ninstability in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth centuries as it transitioned to a\nnew, decentralized political system, they persuasively showed that the devolution of\npower was a successful response to the military, economic, and diplomatic challenges\nthat the empire confronted during its \u201c\u2018time of troubles.\u2019\u201d Thus, by the 1990s, a new\nhistorical consensus had emerged that characterized the period from the death of\nSul\u00ebiman to the mid-eighteenth century not as a time of decline but instead as a period\nof successful adaptation to the empire\u2019s changed circumstance.53\nOttoman Adaptation\nWhat did this transformation encompass and when did it occur? First, to be clear,\nit was not a lagging response to the challenges that began to emerge in the late-\nsixteenth century. Instead, while the evolution of the empire peaked between the 1650s\nand 1690s, the process of adaptation started almost immediately after the \u201c\u2018time of\ntroubles\u2019\u201d began. Second, the empire\u2019s evolution was far reaching and impacted nearly\nall aspects of the Ottoman system. The distribution of political power in the capital, the\ngovernance of the provinces, the collection and disbursement of taxes, and the\nstructure of the military all changed in response to the empire\u2019s new circumstances. The\nresult was a very different state than the one that Mehmet II or Sul\u00ebiman the\nMagnificent had ruled\u2014one that was far-better suited to the conditions of the\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\nMilitary Reforms\nUnsurprisingly, the empire first acted to reform its army. It did so as a direct result\nof the frustration it had experienced fighting the Long War. Unaware of the impact that\nthe Military Revolution was having on the armies of the Christian European states,\nOttoman generals had assumed at the start of the conflict that their soldiers would\neasily defeat Habsburg forces just as they had so many times in the past. Instead, to\ntheir shock, the army had found itself bogged down in a long, costly, and frustrating\nstalemate against a vastly improved enemy. Most alarmingly, the Austrian military had\nnot merely closed the gap that had long existed between it and the sultan\u2019s army but\n52 Howard, 137\u201366.\n53 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 99\u2013100; Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder\nEmpires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 121. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 201\nhad actually surpassed Ottoman forces in several key areas including the quantity and\nquality of field guns deployed and the use of advanced tactics such as volley fire.54\nIn response, the Sublime Porte initiated a campaign designed to restore the\nmilitary\u2019s qualitative superiority. Though it touched on everything from logistics to grand\nstrategy, that effort focused on three key areas: bringing Ottoman battlefield tactics and\nweapons in line with contemporary Western practices, matching the European states\u2019\nshift to larger militaries, and replacing obsolete forces with more effective ones.\nAccordingly, the government ordered the rapid adoption of European-style field guns\nand muskets as well as the volley-fire system that the Austrians had used with such\neffect in the Long War, and it increased the size of the central standing army from\n20,000 soldiers in 1567 to 37,000 at the conclusion of the war with the Habsburgs.\nFinally, the reform campaign made sweeping changes to the army\u2019s composition by\nraising substantially the proportion of soldiers that consisted of musket-armed\nJanissaries and sekban and by severely reducing the share composed of the\nincreasingly ineffective provincial sipahis.55\nThe military reforms undertaken in the early-seventeenth century proved quite\nsuccessful. The quick adoption of the strategies, tactics, and weapons of the Military\nRevolution substantially improved the Ottoman army\u2019s capabilities and ensured that it\ndid not fall behind its European peers. Indeed, Virginia Aksan, one of the leading\nscholars of Ottoman military affairs, points out that the reforms ensured that the sultan\u2019s\narmy remained roughly equivalent in strength and capability to the forces of its two\nprimary rivals\u2014Russia and Austria\u2014at least through the turn of the eighteenth century.\nIn other words, the sultan\u2019s military did not continuously and ineluctably weaken\nbeginning in the seventeenth century as proponents of the Ottoman decline thesis once\nargued, but instead successfully evolved to meet the needs and challenges of a\ndifferent time.56\nFiscal Changes\nWhile these reforms ensured that the Ottoman military enjoyed at least parity\nwith its European rivals in the seventeenth century, they also contributed to the fiscal\ndifficulties that bedeviled the empire at that time. Most obviously, the expansion of the\narmy imposed new costs on the exchequer; after all, more troops inevitably meant\ngreater expenditures. The increased size of the military was only part of the story,\nhowever. Indeed, changes to the army\u2019s composition likely played a more important part\nin increasing the fiscal burden than did the numerical expansion of the military. Put\nsimply, shifting from a cavalry-heavy army to one in which infantry predominated was\n54 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 291\u201392.\n55 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 48\u201349; Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650,\n291\u201394; Gabor Agostono, \u201cFirearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the\nEuropean Military Revolution, 1450-1800,\u201d Journal of World History 25, no. 1 (March\n2014): 97.\n56 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 45, 67\u201370. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 202\nnot merely an exercise in swapping one set of troops for another. Instead, it required the\nsultanate to make fundamental changes in the way that it raised and funded its military\nforces. Most notably, it involved replacing the provincial sipahis, whose expenses had\nbeen met through the timar system, with musket-armed Janissaries and sekban, whose\ncosts were instead borne by the treasury.57\nTo secure the required revenue, the central government began to gradually\nreplace the timars with iltizam, or tax farms, overseen by tax farmers called multezim.\nCommon in Europe in the Early Modern Period and with antecedents in the Muslim\nworld stretching back to the Buyid Dynasty and the Abbasid Caliphate, tax farming was\na decentralized and privatized revenue system in which the state auctioned the right to\ncollect taxes to private individuals. The Ottoman system was fairly typical of tax-farming\nregimes in the Early Modern Period. The winning bidder to an iltizam was obliged to pay\nthe government an initial lump sum and then to forward to the treasury periodic tax\npayments raised during the three-year term of the contract; any excess revenue raised\nwas the multezim\u2019s to keep. The Sublime Porte began the shift to tax farming in 1596\nwhen it seized and converted into iltizam the timars of those cavalrymen who had\ndeserted during the Battle of Mezokeresztes. Thereafter, as the share of infantry in the\narmy steadily rose, the government gradually dispossessed more and more sipahi from\ntheir timars in order to create the additional revenue-producing iltizam needed to pay for\nthe new foot soldiers.58\nTax farming was a mixed blessing for the empire. In the immediate term, it\nproved able to supply the Ottoman government with revenue desperately needed to pay\nfor the reformed and expanded army and thus helped to ease the fiscal crisis. At the\nsame time, however, the short duration of the iltizam contracts encouraged the\nmultezim to impose crushingly high tax rates and to use brutal methods to collect\nrevenue in order to maximize short-term profits. As such, the system discouraged the\neconomic growth on which future tax-revenue depended.59\nMore importantly, substantial as they were, the tax receipts that the iltizam\ngenerated proved insufficient by themselves to offset the Sublime Porte\u2019s myriad fiscal\nproblems. The central government responded in two ways\u2014one modest and one\nsubstantial. First, in 1677, bureaucrats arrived at a way of resolving the budgetary issue\ncreated by the asymmetry between the solar and lunar calendar; thereafter, the treasury\nno longer had to deal with the crisis that arose every eight years when it needed to\nsecure the extra revenue required to pay an additional quarter-year\u2019s-worth of salaries.\nSecond, and more significantly, sometime between the start of the Long War and 1620,\nthe government made permanent the avariz tax: a special assessment imposed during\ntime of conflict to pay for the extraordinary costs of maintaining an army in the field.\n57 Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-1650, 198.\n58 Imber, 198\u2013201.\n59 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 126\u201327. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 203\nBringing in substantial income for the state, the avariz went a long way toward easing\nthe fiscal crisis that had plagued the empire since the late-sixteenth century. 60\nProvincial Decentralization\nThe fiscal reforms of the seventeenth century did not merely benefit the\ntreasury\u2019s bottom line but also fostered a transformation in the structure of provincial\ngovernment and a related relaxation of the central state\u2019s control of the periphery.\nThese changes marked a substantial break with past practice. Keenly aware that\ncentrifugal political forces had grievously weakened earlier empires, the Sublime Porte\nhad traditionally worked to maintain a tight grip over the provinces. To do so, it had\nperiodically rotated governors to new positions in order to prevent them from\nestablishing patronage networks with local notables that might permit them to rule\nautonomously. More importantly, it had maintained close ties with the semi-feudal\nsipahis, whose strength in the provinces acted as a check on local officials and ensured\nthat they could not raise illegal taxes or hire mercenary armies composed of\ndemobilized sekban.61\nFor two reasons, however, those restraints weakened and then collapsed in the\nearly-seventeenth century. First, growing factionalism in the capital not only diverted\nattention from the provinces but also impelled officials in the central government to grant\nconcessions to provincial governors in order to win their support against rival cliques.\nSecond, and more importantly, the demise of the sipahis meant that the Sublime Porte\nno longer had a military force in the provinces to curb the ambitions of the governors\nand local notables. Increasingly, as a result, provincial officials were able to negotiate\nnew arrangements with the central government that accorded them greater autonomy.\nInitially, the accommodations that they secured were limited ones such as the right to\nremain in their posts permanently and thus to establish patronage networks. Soon,\nhowever, they were able to win more far-reaching concessions including the power to\nimpose new taxes, the legal sanction to create private armies, and, ultimately, the right\nto transform their territories into permanent, hereditary fiefdoms over which the central\ngovernment could exert only limited control. By the mid-seventeenth century, these\nchanges had become irreversible. Thereafter, local autonomy rather than central control\ncharacterized the administration of the provinces.62\nIt is important to note that the growing independence of the provinces neither\nweakened the empire nor constituted a sign of its degeneration. Ties between center\nand periphery remained strong, and the new system in no way interfered with the\nempire\u2019s ability to function. Indeed, provincial governors did not typically have\nantagonistic relationships with the court, but instead retained close patronage\n60 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 184; Imber, The Ottoman Empire, 1300-\n1650, 242\u201343.\n61 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 86.\n62 Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed. (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2002), 277\u201378.

They also continued to forward tax revenue to\nthe exchequer and contributed troops from their private armies for service in the\nempire\u2019s wars. In other words, the hierarchical system of provincial administration that\nhad existed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had not degenerated into a weaker,\ndecentralized system as proponents of the Ottoman decline thesis had once argued;\ninstead, it had transformed into a cooperative arrangement\u2014one that that functioned\neffectively over the next two centuries.63\nDecentralization in the Capital\nWith the growing weakness of the sultans, power devolved in the central\ngovernment as well. As we saw earlier, the succession of child rulers and mentally\nunbalanced sultans who reigned in the first half of the seventeenth century had created\na power vacuum in the court. In response, shifting factions composed of harem\neunuchs, queen mothers, Janissaries, viziers, \u02bfulama\u02be, and powerful bureaucrats\nassumed a steadily increasing share of power. While these groups often competed with\neach other\u2014sometimes violently\u2014they increasingly worked cooperatively, and soon\ncame to provide the empire with what the historian Donald Quataert argues was an\neffective system of \u201ccollective leadership.\u201d64\nWhat of the sultans? How did they fit into this new structure of shared rule?\nSome, such as Murad IV and Mehmet IV, participated in the running of the empire,\nalbeit more as first-among-equals than as absolute monarchs on the model of\nMehmet II (r. 1451-1481). These leaders were very much the exception, however. For\nthe most part, the sultans of the seventeenth century reigned rather than ruled\u2014serving\nas unifying symbols that legitimated the collective system rather than as executives who\nactually directed the administration of the empire.65\nAs we have seen, proponents of the Ottoman decline thesis once argued that the\nshift from strong, sultanic rule to factional governance during the early-seventeenth\ncentury marked the moment that the empire began its inexorable degeneration.\nAccording to this school of thought, the early Ottoman state had prospered and\nexpanded under the effective leadership of powerful sultans such as Mehmed II,\nSelim II and Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent. After 1566, in contrast, it endured the rule of a\nrotating cast of venal and corrupt courtiers, pashas, and viziers. More interested in\naccumulating personal power and wealth than in providing wise leadership, the new\nruling class failed to respond effectively to foreign threats, ignored the empire\u2019s gradual\neconomic, diplomatic, and military degeneration, and set the sultanate on a path that\nled, ineluctably, to its dissolution.66\n63 Hathaway and Barbir, The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 8\u20139.\n64 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 34.\n65 Quataert, 34.\n66 Lewis, \u201cSome Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,\u201d 111\u201327. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 205\nThere is a grain of truth to this argument. The early period of collective rule was\nindeed an anarchic time\u2014one marked by violent riots in the capital, political paralysis in\nthe Sublime Porte, and rebellions in the provinces that, collectively, left the Ottoman\ngovernment poorly equipped to deal with external challenges. The empire\u2019s enemies\nwere quick to exploit the instability. Most notably, it was the chaos that followed the\ndeposition and execution of Osman II that gave Shah Abbas I the opportunity to seize\ncontrol of Baghdad in 1624.67\nIn recent decades, however, scholars who argue that the empire transformed\nrather than degenerated have persuasively rebutted this interpretation. They contend\nthat the Ottoman decline thesis vastly overstates the role that the early sultans had\nplayed in the government, unrealistically assumes that the empire\u2019s fortunes were\nentirely a function of the competence of its top ruler, and, most importantly, ignores the\nmany successes that the Sublime Porte enjoyed after the \u201c\u2018time of troubles.\u2019\u201d Indeed,\ndirectly contradicting the Ottoman decline thesis, they maintain that the system of\ncollective rule that took effect in the early-seventeenth century provided capable\ngovernance. In particular, they argue that the empire was especially well led during two\nsuccessive periods: The Sultanate of Women from the 1620s to the 1650s and the\nKoprulu Era from 1656 to 1703.68\nThe Sultanate of Women\nDuring the Sultanate of Women, the valide sultans, or queen mothers, provided\nstrong leadership in what proved to be a peculiarly rocky period for the Ottoman Empire.\nThe preeminent force in the government from the death of Osman II in 1622 until her\nassassination in 1651, Kosem Sultan (1689-1651), mother of Murad IV and Ibrahim,\nwas the most important of the valide sultans. She proved pivotal in seeing the empire\nthrough a peculiarly difficult period. Serving as regent from 1623 to 1632, she was\ninstrumental in helping Murad IV to put down a Janissary revolt and to restore central\ncontrol of the sultanate; later, she played a key role in bringing Ibrahim\u2019s disastrous\nreign to a close.69\nTurhan Sultan (1627-1683), the mother of Mehmet IV, offered similarly effective\ndirection of the empire during hard times. Serving as regent and co-ruler from 1651 to\n1656, she succeeded in maintaining some semblance of order in the capital\u2014no small\ntask given the anarchy that prevailed at the time\u2014and oversaw the reconstruction of\nmany of the empire\u2019s critical defensive bastions. Undoubtedly, however, her most\nimportant action came in 1656. Confronting defeat at Venetian hands, she made the\nbold decision that year to elevate an obscure and elderly bureaucrat named Koprulu\nMehmet Pasha (1575-1661), to the position of grand vizier\u2014a move that not only\n67 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 205\u20136.\n68 Hathaway and Barbir, The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 8\u20139.\n69 Peirce, The Imperial Harem, 253\u201356; Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires:\nOttomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 75\u201376. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 206\ndemonstrated her wisdom and decision-making abilities but that also launched the\nhighly successful Koprulu Era.70\nThe Koprulu Era\nLike the valide sultans, the members and dependents of the Koprulu family who\ncontrolled the grand vizirate from 1656 to 1703 provided wise and effective rule. That\nthey were able to do so was critically important, for the Koprulu era began during a\npeculiarly dark time. The issue was the ongoing war with Venice. As we have seen, the\nVenetians had followed their victory over the Ottoman fleet in 1656 by reinstituting their\nblockade of the Dardanelles Strait; as a result, Istanbul experienced serious food\nshortages that produced periods of civil unrest as well as destabilizing revolts among\nthe soldiers. Upon becoming grand vizier, Mehmet Pasha moved aggressively to\nrestore the situation. He began by organizing a naval campaign in 1657 that succeeded\nin defeating the Venetian fleet and in reopening the strait to commerce. This victory\nproved critical both because it ended the immediate crisis, and because it dramatically\nenhanced Mehmet Pasha\u2019s stature\u2014affording him the political capital needed to arrest\nand execute the leaders of the rebellious soldiers and to purge the bureaucracy of\nofficials from rival cliques. Now firmly in command, he followed with a series of further\nsuccesses. He put down a rebellious vassal in Transylvania, defeated the Habsburgs,\nand efficiently and quickly reconstructed the capital after a devastating fire.71\nMehmet Pasha\u2019s brief tenure as grand vizier was an unalloyed success. By the\ntime he passed away in 1661, he had not only resolved the crises of the 1650s but had\nalso left the empire on its most stable footing since Murad IV\u2019s death in 1640. Indeed,\nhis direction of the sultanate had been so effective that he was able to compel\nMehmet IV to name his son, Koprulu Fazil Ahmed Pasha (1635-1676), as the empire\u2019s\nnext grand vizier\u2014a move that institutionalized Koprulu control of the Sublime Porte for\nthe next three decades.72\nStrong leadership continued under Fazil Ahmed Pasha and his successor as\ngrand vizier, his adopted brother, Kara Mustafa Pasha (1634-1683). They were so\neffective in addressing the problems of the \u201c\u2018times of trouble,\u2019\u201d in fact, that, under their\nleadership, the sultanate was able to wage wars of conquest for the first time in nearly a\ncentury. Fazil Ahmed Pasha set the Koprulu era of expansion in motion by finally\ncompleting the conquest of Crete in 1669 and by taking Podolia from the Polish-\nLithuanian Commonwealth in 1672. Kara Mustafa followed suit by securing suzerainty\nover the semi-nomadic Cossacks of Right Bank Ukraine\u2014thereby shoring up the\nOttoman position along the border with the increasingly aggressive Russian Empire.\nThese victories were substantial and earned the Koprulu much acclaim. Indeed, as\n70 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 75\u201376;\nPeirce, The Imperial Harem, 253\u201356.\n71 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 253\u201364.\n72 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 76, 58. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 207\ncontemporaries approvingly noted, the empire had never before controlled as much\nterritory as it did under Kara Mustafa.73\nThe grand viziers of the Koprulu Era enjoyed similar success implementing\nmuch-needed domestic reforms. They restored discipline to the military, struck\nabsentee troops from the rolls, and began to offset the declining efficacy of the\nJanissaries by making greater use of Albanian, Circassian, and, especially, Tatar\nauxiliaries. Most importantly, successive Koprulu viziers implemented sweeping fiscal\nreforms that put the treasury on a solid footing for the first time since the 1570s. Central\nto that effort was the issuance in 1688 of a new silver coin, the kurus, to replace the\nnow completely depreciated akce. Stable in value, the kurus quickly brought an end to\nthe inflation that had plagued the empire for much of the prior century and thereby\nhelped spark what the historian Douglas Howard characterizes as \u201ca long period of\nprosperity in Ottoman society.\u201d74\nMalikane\nThe Koprulu also oversaw a far-reaching reform of the tax system in the 1690s\nthat would have enormous ramifications both for the central government\u2019s fiscal\nsituation and for the administration of the provinces. Mounting dissatisfaction with the\niltizam form of tax collection prompted this move. By the end of the seventeenth\ncentury, treasury officials had become well aware that the three-year terms of the iltizam\ncontracts were encouraging the multezim to seek short-term gain at the expense of the\nempire\u2019s long-term economic well-being. They also understood that the iltizam system\nhad never provided the state with the consistent tax payments it needed in peacetime\nlet alone during its frequent foreign conflicts. Such was the case during the long and\ncostly War of the Holy League in the closing decades of the seventeenth century, which\nwe shall explore presently. Indeed, it was the need for additional funds to pay for that\nconflict that would serve as the catalyst for a complete overhaul of the tax system.75\nThe centerpiece of that reform program was a comprehensive change to the\nsystem of tax farming that went into effect in 1695. That year, the treasury began to\nreplace the iltizam system with a new form of tax farming called malikane that it hoped\nwould deliver the revenue needed to finance the war. The malikane tax farms were\nsuperficially similar to the iltizam ones that they replaced. They required the winning\nbidder to pay an initial lump sum and thereafter to forward a share of the annual tax\nreceipts they collected to the treasury. The malikane system differed from the iltizam\narrangement in one significant way, however: The leases on them were for the lifetime\nof the holder rather than for three years.76\n73 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 273\u201383.\n74 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 277; Howard, A History of the Ottoman\nEmpire, 170\u201372, 186.\n75 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 326.\n76 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 184\u201385. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 208\nThe shift from iltizam to malikane tax farms paid substantial dividends for the\nSublime Porte. The new system not only provided the steady collection of tax revenue\nthe empire needed but also indirectly benefitted the exchequer by helping to boost the\nbroader Ottoman economy. The key here was the duration of the malikane contracts.\nLasting for the life of the holder, the agreements encouraged the multezim to make\ninvestments in infrastructure and to set taxes at rates designed to encourage long-term\neconomic growth rather than to generate quick profits. As a consequence, the new\nsystem helped to establish the conditions that would see the empire experience a\nsteady agricultural and commercial expansion over the course of the eighteenth century\nand a concomitant rise in tax receipts.77\nAdvocates of the Ottoman decline thesis once maintained that the shift to lifetime\ntax farming marked another critical inflection point in the empire\u2019s decline.\nCharacterizing the adoption of the malikane system as a desperate grab for short-term\ncash, they argued that, like the iltizam practice that it replaced, it not only produced a\ndecline in long-term tax receipts but also had the unintended consequence of\naccelerating the ongoing process of decentralization that allowed the more distant parts\nof the empire to become fiscally and politically autonomous. To proponents of the\nOttoman decline thesis, in other words, the malikane system incurred a double cost to\nthe Sublime Porte\u2014failing to provide the treasury with adequate revenue even as it\nweakened the government\u2019s control of peripheral provinces.78\nMore recently, scholars who argue that the empire experienced transformation\nrather than decline have persuasively rebutted this interpretation. While acknowledging\nthe centrifugal political implications of the new arrangement, they contend that by\nmaintaining control of the bidding process and by regulating the collection of revenue,\nofficials in the capital ensured that the state retained a significant degree of authority\nover the provinces. In addition, they show that the attraction of lifetime tax farms\u2014they\nwere quite lucrative for the lease holders\u2014and the Sublime Porte\u2019s continued monopoly\nover the bidding process combined to strengthen patronage links between local\nnotables and officials in Istanbul. Coupled with the provincial governors\u2019 desire for\nformal recognition\u2014only the sultan could grant them the legitimacy they needed\u2014the\nmalikane system thus ensured that center and periphery would remain bound together\nfor the next century and that the provincial notables would continue both to forward tax\nrevenue to the treasury and to provide troops for the defense of the empire. In other\nwords, while the new system of tax collection that the Koprulu put in place and the new\nrelationship between the Sublime Porte and the provinces differed substantially from\npast practice, they did not weaken the power of the central government as scholars\nonce argued.79\n77 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 325\u201326.\n78 Lewis, \u201cSome Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,\u201d 111\u201327.\n79 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 252; Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 184\u2013\n86; Hathaway and Barbir, The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 8\u20139. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 209\nWars of Contraction?\nThe War of the Holy League, 1683-1699\nThe achievements of the Koprulu era\u2014the establishment of the malikane\nsystem, the resolution of the crisis of the 1650s, and the expansion of the empire\u2014were\nsubstantial and went a long way toward restoring the sultanate following the \u201c\u2018time of\ntroubles.\u2019\u201d However, the Koprulu family\u2019s many successes must be balanced against the\ndisastrous war into which it dragged the empire in 1683. That conflict was a product of\nKara Mustafa\u2019s desire to continue the renewed drive to expand the sultanate. Seeking\nto take advantage of a revolt by Protestant dissidents in the Habsburg-controlled part of\nHungary, he invaded Austria in 1683. He was not content merely to take a few border\nfortresses as the Ottomans might have done in the recent past, however. Instead,\nseeking greater glory, he marched his army deep into Austrian territory and laid siege to\nEmperor Leopold I\u2019s (r. 1658-1705) capital, the city of Vienna. Vastly outnumbering the\ndefenders, the Ottomans appeared poised in the late summer of 1683 to achieve the\nempire\u2019s greatest victory since the reign of Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent. Instead, the\ncampaign ended in disaster. On September 12, a Polish-Habsburg relief force under the\ncommand of Polish King John Sobieski (r. 1674-1696) decisively routed the Ottoman\narmy and broke the siege. The battle was a major setback for the sultan\u2019s military and a\nfatal one for Kara Mustafa: blaming his grand vizier for the defeat, Mehmet IV had him\nexecuted on Christmas Day, 1683.80\nThe situation rapidly deteriorated from that point. Following the victory at Vienna,\nthe Habsburg Empire, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Venice, and Russia\nformed a powerful alliance against the Ottomans called the Holy League. Bereft of Kara\nMustafa\u2019s effective leadership and gripped by political instability\u2014thirteen men served\nas grand vizier between 1683 and the conflict\u2019s conclusion in 1699\u2014the empire found\nitself outnumbered and outmatched. On the Austrian front, Habsburg forces repeatedly\npummeled the Ottoman army and won a victory of substantial strategic and symbolic\nsignificance at Mohacs in 1687, the site of Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent\u2019s greatest triumph.\nConcurrently, Venice took possession of the Morea in Greece and Russian troops\nseized the fortress of Azov at the mouth of the Don River\u2014the linchpin of the empire\u2019s\ndefensive line north of the Black Sea. The loss of that bastion was a serious blow to the\nOttomans and made clear just how tenuous the empire\u2019s position had become by the\nlate 1690s. Indeed, the fall of the strategic fortress was so shocking that it finally\ncompelled the Sublime Porte to sue for peace.81\nThe Treaty of Karlowitz, 1699\nThe Treaty of Karlowitz that emerged out of the subsequent negotiations made\nclear the extent of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s defeat. Based on the principle of uti\n80 Marie-Janine Calic, The Great Cauldron: A History of Southeastern Europe, trans.\nElizabeth Janik (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2019), 122\u201323.\n81 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 289\u2013318. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 210\npossidetis\u2014meaning that each party retained the territory that it controlled at the\nconclusion of the fighting\u2014the agreement cost the sultanate substantial amounts of\nterritory. By its terms, Istanbul ceded Hungary and Transylvania to the Habsburg\nEmpire, Podolia to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Morea and the\nDalmatian coast to Venice. A separate treaty signed with Russia in 1700 recognized the\nloss of the fortress of Azov and\u2014in a stipulation pregnant with symbolic significance\u2014\nacknowledged that the Russia tsar, once clearly the Ottoman sultan\u2019s diplomatic\nsubordinate, was now of equivalent rank.82\nProponents of the Ottoman decline thesis once cast the War of the Holy League\nand the treaty of Karlowitz as the first clear, outward manifestations of the empire\u2019s\naccelerating internal decay. They argued that a century of weak leadership, venal\ncorruption, military indiscipline, and provincial decentralization had weakened the\nempire and left its army incapable of fighting off the militaries of its increasingly dynamic\nand sophisticated European rivals. As a result, Ottoman forces endured a string of\ndefeats in the war that ended only when the Sublime Porte accepted a peace\nagreement that cost the empire most of its territory in Central Europe.83\nIn recent years, historians critical of the decline paradigm have persuasively\ncountered this interpretation of the conflict. While acknowledging the extent of the\nOttoman defeat, they dispute the view that the empire lost the war as a result of a\nbroader process of cultural, political, economic, and military degeneration. Instead,\nmaintaining that the Ottoman army was every bit as effective as those of its enemies,\nthey argue that the problem was one of quantity rather than quality. At war with a broad\nalliance of enemies on a series of fronts that stretched from Hungary in the west to the\nDon River in the east, the Ottoman army found itself overwhelmed and outgunned by a\nnumerically superior coalition. In the view of these historians, in other words, the empire\nlost the war not because of internal decline but instead because its soldiers were badly\noutnumbered.84\nContinued Military Success\nThose scholars also point to the continued effectiveness of Ottoman military\nforces in the decades following the War of the Holy League as evidence that the\nsultan\u2019s military had not declined relative to those of its main rivals. For example, they\nnote that Ottoman forces succeeded in ending the Fourth Russo-Ottoman War in 1711\nby surrounding and compelling the surrender of a Russian army under the command of\nTsar Peter the Great (r. 1682-1725)\u2014a victory that briefly returned the critical fortress of\nAzov to Ottoman control. Led by the Crimean Tatars\u2014who had emerged as the sultan\u2019s\nbest troops\u2014the Ottoman military likewise performed competently in a conflict the\nempire fought with Russia and Austria between 1736 and 1739. While the sultan\u2019s\n82 Streusand, Islamic Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, 60\u201361.\n83 For example, see Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, 228\u201336.\n84 Gabor Agostono, \u201cFirearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European\nMilitary Revolution, 1450-1800,\u201d 200\u2013202. Chapter Seven: Ottoman Crisis and Adaptation, 1566-1768 Page 211\ntroops had at best mixed success against the tsar\u2019s armies in that war, it routinely\nbattered Habsburg forces in Central Europe. Thus, the wars of the early-eighteenth\ncentury made clear that while the Ottoman army had long since lost the commanding\nedge that it had enjoyed in the days of Selim II and Sul\u00ebiman the Magnificent, it\nnonetheless showed no signs of decline or degeneration and remained comparable in\ncapability to the militaries of its Habsburg and Russian rivals through the middle of the\neighteenth century.85\nConclusion\nAs the ongoing success of its military demonstrated, the Ottoman state had\u2014\nafter a difficult start\u2014succeeded in addressing the challenges of the \u201c\u2018time of troubles.\u2019\u201d\nIt had neither degenerated as scholars once claimed nor clung blindly to the institutions\nand practices that had proven so successful in its rise. Instead, it had undertaken a\nsweeping reform program that, while far from perfect, nonetheless resolved many of the\nempire\u2019s problems and ensured that it continued to thrive well into the eighteenth\ncentury.\nAfter that point, however, the Ottoman Empire found itself in an astonishingly\ndifferent and far-more dangerous world. With the onset of the Commercial and Industrial\nRevolutions, the Western states that the Ottomans had once dominated were\nundergoing an unprecedented economic transformation that was rapidly rendering them\nvastly stronger than the empire. By the early-nineteenth century, the gap in power\nbetween the sultanate and the European states had become so great and so dangerous\nthat the Sublime Porte felt compelled once again to embark on a far-reaching reform\nprogram. This time, however, it was not acting alone. Throughout the empire, officials\nand subjects alike debated how Muslim states could best respond to the growing threat\nemanating from Europe. It is to the challenge of the West and to the Ottoman Empire\u2019s\nmanifold responses that we shall now turn.\n85 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 83\u2013118. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses, 1768-1878\nIn the late-eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire began to face a new set of\nchallenges far greater than any it had yet confronted. The successful transformation that\nthe sultanate had undergone in the seventeenth century had provided it with an\nimperfect, if-nonetheless effective system of government, but did not endow it with the\neconomic structures and social practices needed to keep pace with the commercially\ndynamic states of Europe. Starting in 1768, as a result, the Ottomans found themselves\nincreasingly unable to fend off the aggressive Western powers or to prevent the\nsuccess of national liberation movements in the Balkans; above all, they could no longer\nkeep the predatory Russian Empire from periodically seizing large swaths of strategic\nterritory. The result was what Western leaders euphemistically referred to as the\n\u201cEastern Question\u201d: the problem that Ottoman weakness posed to the balance of power\non which European peace rested. For the next century and a half, the Eastern Question\nwas a front-burner issue\u2014a constant menace to European security and stability that\noccupied Western diplomats who were intent on preventing volatility in the Ottoman\nEmpire from sparking a general war.\nWhile the imbalance in power between the West and the empire compelled\nEuropean leaders to engage in seemingly constant crisis management, it prompted\nMuslims to undertake a searching reappraisal aimed at understanding what had gone\nwrong and at determining how they could best respond to the new challenges that the\nempire faced. Bureaucrats, intellectuals, provincial governors, and religious scholars\nalike offered a number of competing explanations for the empire\u2019s weakness and\nprescribed a variety of often-conflicting reform proposals aimed at redressing the\nyawning gap in power that had opened between the Muslim world and the European\nstates. Those efforts ultimately failed to arrest the West\u2019s growing dominance or to\nprevent the loss of further territory; they did, however, succeed in creating a legacy of\nreform that would powerfully shape political and social views well into the twentieth\ncentury.\nThe European Powers and the Ottoman Empire\nThe Rise of the West\nThe source of the Eastern Question and the impetus for the reform efforts that\nemerged in the nineteenth century was the menace posed by the rise of the West.\nBetween 1500 and 1800, Europe underwent a series of significant changes that opened\na widening economic and military gap between it and other parts of the world. Its\ntransformation began with the Commercial Revolution: the emergence of new trade\nroutes, industries, and financial networks in the years following the discovery and\nexploitation of the New World that resulted in large parts of Europe shifting to a proto-\ncapitalist economic system. Concurrently, the West underwent the Scientific Revolution.\nThis new method of studying the material world and understanding humanity\u2019s\nrelationship to it broke with millennia of received wisdom and made new and vastly Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 213\nmore sophisticated technological breakthroughs possible. In turn, the Scientific and\nCommercial Revolutions made possible an even more far-reaching transformation: the\nIndustrial Revolution. First emerging in Britain in the eighteenth century, it produced a\nperiod of sustained economic growth vastly greater in scale than had been the case at\nany point in the past.1\nThe West also drew strength from the emergence of two revolutionary new\nideologies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: liberalism and nationalism.\nThese new belief systems constituted a direct challenge to longstanding political\ntheories and to the dynastic system that had predominated in Europe for centuries.\nLiberalism called for the replacement of hereditary privilege, the divine right of kings,\nand arbitrary rule with written constitutions, the consent of the governed, civil rights, and\nthe rule of law. The related ideology of nationalism demanded that culturally\nhomogenous groups of people\u2014those who shared a language and history\u2014should no\nlonger be incorporated into dynastic empires overseen by unchecked kings but should\ninstead rule themselves as independent, sovereign states.\nOn the surface, nationalism and liberalism seemed to impose substantial new\nconstraints on the authority of Western rulers. After all, those ideologies explicitly\nchallenged the monarchs\u2019 claims to absolute rule and called for an end to their\nmonopoly over foreign relations. Counterintuitively, however, nationalism and liberalism\ndid not weaken central governments but instead enhanced their power. Liberalism\nreflected this seeming paradox from the very start. As political theorists and government\nministers slowly realized, the British monarchy\u2019s acceptance of Parliament\u2019s power to\nset tax rates and to have a voice in foreign affairs had resulted not in the legislature\ncurbing the executive\u2019s conduct of foreign relations but instead in it enthusiastically\nfunding and supporting the British state\u2019s many expensive wars. Nationalism similarly\nstrengthened the power of central governments, at least those that ruled culturally\nhomogenous populations. Most notably, the revolutionary French state\u2019s use of\nnationalist appeals in the Lev\u00e9e en Masse 1793 had permitted it to quickly raise an\narmy of one-and-a-half million conscripts to defend the country from Britain and\nHabsburg Austria\u2014a mobilization on a scale that would have been inconceivable only a\nfew years earlier.2\nThe Russian Threat\nIronically, the most dangerous threat to the Ottomans, the Russian Empire,\nsimilarly lagged behind Western Europe. A staunch opponent of liberalism to the bitter\nend, it did not begin to industrialize until the late-nineteenth century and thus did not\npossess a dynamic economy similar to those of the Western European states.\nNonetheless, thanks to Peter the Great\u2019s (r. 1682-1725) military reforms and to Russia\u2019s\n1 Tim Blanning, The Pursuit of Glory: The Five Revolutions That Made Modern Europe:\n1648-1815 (London: Penguin Books, 2008), 93\u2013141.\n2 William Doyle, The French Revolution: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2001), 56. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 214\nparticipation in both the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748) and the Seven\nYears\u2019 War (1756-1763), it fielded a fearsome military\u2014one that was equipped with\nmodern Western weapons and drilled in the latest tactics. Making matters worse for the\nSublime Porte, St. Petersburg had a powerful desire to expand at Ottoman expense.\nThis aspiration was, at root, ideological. As far back as Ivan III (r. 1462-1505), Russian\nmonarchs had described their empire as the \u201c\u2018Third Rome\u2019\u201d: the rightful heir to the\nByzantine Empire and, importantly, its former territory. It was a claim that Russian rulers\ntook very seriously. Indeed, Ivan III had lent legitimacy to it not only by marrying a\nByzantine princess, but also by styling himself tsar, or caesar, in imitation of the\nByzantine emperors of old.3\nThereafter, successive tsars pressed Russia\u2019s claim to be the heir of the\nByzantine Empire and to be entitled, by right, to its territory. For a long time, of course,\nthat belief remained no more than an aspiration. Faced with a still-powerful Ottoman\nstate, successive Russian monarchs found themselves unable to realize their dream of\nsucceeding the Byzantine Empire. Indeed, it was only under the forbidding and strong-\nwilled Catherine II (r. 1762-1796) that Russia began to transform that claim from\nambition into reality. Determined to make real the pretension that the tsars were the\nlegitimate successors to the Byzantine emperors, she pursued a \u201csouthern strategy\u201d\naimed at securing control of the Ottoman-held warm-water ports on the northern shore\nof the Black Sea from which Russian forces could subsequently threaten\nConstantinople and the straits. It was a bold program; astonishingly, it was also one that\nCatherine II succeeded in achieving.4\nOttoman Weakness\nRusso-Ottoman War, 1768-1774\nShe began to pursue her southern strategy with the Russo-Ottoman War of\n1768-1774. From the beginning, the conflict went disastrously for the Ottomans. Having\nsat out the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years\u2019 War, the sultanate\nhad failed to remain abreast of the rapid evolution of European weapons and tactics that\nhad occurred since 1740. As a result, Catherine II\u2019s powerful and well-led troops easily\nthrashed the Ottomans\u2019 much-larger armies and handily occupied both the Crimean\nPeninsula and the strategic Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. Indeed,\nby the time the war ended in 1774, the Ottoman Empire\u2019s heretofore-sophisticated\nsupply system lay in shambles and its army was on the verge of collapse.5\n3 Tamim Ansary, Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World Through Islamic Eyes (New\nYork, NY: PublicAffairs, 2009), 235.\n4 Virginia H.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 215\nTreaty of Kucuk-Kaynarja, 1774\nAt first blush, the Treaty of Kucuk-Kaynarja that concluded the war seemed to\nsalvage at the negotiating table that which the Ottoman military had lost on the\nbattlefield. The key was Western intervention. Keen to maintain the balance of power,\nEuropean states led by the Habsburg Empire compelled Catherine II to give up the main\nterritorial prizes\u2014Wallachia and Moldavia\u2014that her armies had won. Indeed, European\ndiplomats managed to limit Russia\u2019s tangible gains to relatively modest ones: a large\nindemnity, a few key fortifications and ports on the Black Sea coast, and some border\nregions in the north Caucasus. Thus, to the casual observer, the Ottomans appeared to\nhave dodged a bullet.6\nSuch an assessment is inaccurate. The agreement was in fact a disastrous one\nfor the Sublime Porte that fully reflected the scale of the empire\u2019s military defeats from\n1768-1774. Two provisions were especially damaging. First, the treaty granted Russia\nthe right to protect Orthodox Christians in the sultan\u2019s domain; seemingly innocuous at\nthe time, this stipulation would serve as the justification that St. Petersburg would use to\nintervene in Ottoman affairs. Second, the agreement formally ended the sultan\u2019s\nsovereignty over the Crimean Khanate and made the Tatars independent. This\nconcession would prove to be a painful one for the Sublime Porte. It not only deprived\nthe military of its best troops but also marked the first time that the empire had been\ncompelled to cede territory with a predominantly Muslim population. Worse, as was\nwidely understood at the time, Tatar independence was only a temporary condition\ndestined to lead\u2014as it did in 1783\u2014to Russian annexation of the strategic Crimean\nPeninsula.7\nThe war of 1768-1774 and the treaty that ended it thus constituted a critical\nturning point for the sultanate. As a result of them, the Sublime Porte had lost its most\ndependable soldiers, its monopoly over the Black Sea, and its freedom from foreign\ninterference in its internal affairs. Perhaps worst of all, that conflict\u2014and another, only\nslightly less-disastrous war with Russia from 1787-1792\u2014had revealed that the sultan\u2019s\nmilitary no longer stood on an even footing with the armies of the European powers.8\nNapoleon in Egypt, 1798-1801\nThe Ottoman Empire\u2019s relative weakness was certainly clear to the ambitious\nFrench general, Napoleon Bonaparte (r. 1799-1814, 1815). Seeking to exploit the\nqualitative gap that had opened between the sultan\u2019s military and those of the European\nstates, the young general had begun plotting in the mid 1790s to seize territory in the\nMiddle East from which he could interdict commerce between Britain and its\neconomically vital colony of India. Those plans came to fruition in 1798 when he\ninvaded and occupied Ottoman Egypt. Initially, the operation was a cakewalk for his\n6 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 158\u201360.\n7 Aksan, 158\u201360.\n8 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 377\u201387. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 216\ndisciplined soldiers. They easily took control of the province\u2014demonstrating in the\nprocess that the divide between the military capabilities of the Western European states\nand those of the sultan\u2019s army had widened substantially since the Ottoman Empire\u2019s\nrecent defeat at Russian hands. Most notably, at the Battle of the Pyramids outside\nCairo in July 1798, Napoleon\u2019s soldiers used their superior artillery, better tactics, and\nbayonet-equipped guns to decisively rout an Ottoman army in an engagement that\ncame at the astonishingly modest cost of only thirty French lives.9\nUltimately, however, Napoleon\u2019s invasion did not prove successful. The\ndestruction of his fleet by a British naval force in the Battle of the Nile in August 1798\nrendered his position in Egypt untenable and thus dashed his grandiose plan to bring\nEngland to its knees by severing its communications with India. Eager to shed himself\nof a losing venture, Napoleon followed the defeat by passing command of his army in\nEgypt to one of his subordinates and returning to Paris. Eventually, an Anglo-Ottoman\narmy\u2014in which the disciplined British troops did the heavy lifting\u2014defeated what\nremained of his expeditionary force at Alexandria in 1801 and compelled Paris to\nabandon the Egyptian operation.10\nThe \u201cEastern Question\u201d\nThe ease with which the French took Egypt confirmed what the Russian victories\nin the late-eighteenth century had suggested: that the Ottoman Empire was no longer a\nfirst-rate military power. Accordingly, attuned as they were to the strengths and\nweaknesses of the world\u2019s states, European leaders thereafter factored the increasingly\nvast gap in military and economic power that had emerged between the Ottoman\nEmpire and the West into their diplomatic calculations. Indeed, it was at that time that\nthe Eastern Question first began to emerge as a central concern in European diplomatic\ncircles.11\nViews of the Eastern Question differed. For Russian tsars and their ministers, the\nproblems of the Ottoman Empire smelled of opportunity. They hoped to exploit its\nweakness in order to replace sultanic rule in the Balkans with dependent, Russian-\ndominated states. More importantly, they dreamed of finally achieving their long-held\ngoal of taking control of Constantinople and the straits\u2014thereby giving Russia both the\nprestige of possessing the former Byzantine capital and the tangible benefits of at last\nenjoying access to uninhibited warm-water ports. In contrast, diplomats from other\nstates viewed the Eastern Question as a serious issue that threatened to undermine the\nbroader, post-Napoleonic European peace. Leaders in Britain, France, and Austria in\nparticular understood that the problems of the Ottoman Empire created a dangerous\npower vacuum; should any state\u2014especially Russia\u2014exploit its weakness to seize\n9 Juan Cole, Napoleon\u2019s Egypt: Invading the Middle East, First edition (New York:\nPalgrave Macmillan, 2007), 3, 13\u201314, 66\u201369.\n10 Cole, 108\u201310, 204.\n11 Erik J. Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey: A Modern History, Third Edition (London: I.B. Tauris, 2004),\n38\u201339. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 217\nterritory in the Balkans or take control of the straits, the European balance of power on\nwhich peace and security rested would be fatally undermined and the Continent would\nbe plunged into a costly war.12\nThe leaders of those states proved better at perceiving the risks inherent in the\nEastern Question than at managing them, however. Divided among themselves and\nunable to resist taking advantage of the Ottoman Empire, they never found a\nsatisfactory way to resolve the Eastern Question. Instead, left to fester, it increasingly\nstrained relations between the Great Powers and helped to bring about the First World\nWar. That conflict lay in the distant future at the time that French troops left Egypt,\nhowever. In the meantime, the centrality of the Eastern Question in European diplomacy\nwaxed and waned\u2014rising when problems arose in the Balkans or when Russia sought\nto expand at Ottoman expense and falling when other crises took precedence.13\nNationalist Revolts\nIn keeping with this pattern, the Eastern Question remained on the back burner\nduring the cataclysmic Wars of Napoleon (1803-1815) even as it grew substantially\nmore complicated due to the appearance of nationalist revolts in the European part of\nthe Ottoman Empire. The first of these occurred in Serbia. Emerging out of a local\nconflict among Ottoman officials in 1804 and drawing strength from socioeconomic\ngrievances that had little to do with Serbian identity, the revolt only belatedly acquired\nnationalist overtones. It ended in 1816, when the Sublime Porte, bowing in part to\nRussian pressure, granted autonomy to the province.14\nA similar nationalist rebellion broke out in Greece in 1821. In two ways, it was\nreminiscent of the recently resolved Serbian revolt. First, it too arose out of a conflict\nwithin the Ottoman ruling class and only belatedly transformed into a nationalist\nmovement. Second, like the Serbian uprising, it succeeded as a result of foreign\ninvolvement\u2014in this case, the intervention of Russia, Britain, and France. Their motives\nfor becoming involved varied. St. Petersburg interceded in hopes of turning Greece into\na protectorate; in contrast, London and Paris intervened partly to curb the tsar\u2019s\nambition and partly to satisfy increasingly pro-Greek public opinion.15\nThe support of these states proved critical in helping Greece gain independence.\nIn 1824, the powerful ruler of Ottoman Egypt, Pasha Mehmet Ali (r. 1805-1848), had\n12 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 235\u201336; Marie-Janine Calic, The Great Cauldron: A\nHistory of Southeastern Europe, trans.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 218\ndeployed his army and navy against the rebels at the Sublime Porte\u2019s request; in short\norder, his disciplined forces defeated the insurgents and restored sultanic control over\nGreece. Perversely, however, his intervention proved to be too successful. Faced with\nthe prospect of an outright Greek defeat, the people of France and Britain pressured\ntheir governments into joining with Russia to rescue the rebellion. Accordingly, in 1827,\nan Anglo-Russian-French naval force destroyed the combined Egyptian-Ottoman fleet\nat Navarino. The battle proved to be a turning point. With the European states now\nfirmly committed to the rebels, the Sublime Porte concluded that victory was no longer\npossible. In 1829, as a result, it agreed to grant Greece its independence.16\nThe Historical Debate: Nationalism\nUnderstandings of nationalism and, especially, the origins of the Greek and\nSerbian nationalist movements, have changed markedly in recent decades. Prior to\nWorld War II, most scholars argued that nationalism was the natural precondition for the\nnation-state. According to this view, each nation, or ethnically-defined group of people,\nis a fixed or essential entity, meaning that it has always existed and that its fundamental\ncharacteristics\u2014its culture, beliefs, and language\u2014are unchanging. When faced with\noppression, a people that does not enjoy self-determination will, because of its shared\nsense of nationalism, seek independence in order to form a nation-state; in other words,\nnation precedes state. Thus, according to this perspective, the independence drives that\noccurred in the Balkans in the nineteenth century were the natural and inevitable\nproduct of the innate nationalism of the peoples who lived there. Having suffered under\nthe yoke of oppressive Ottoman rule for centuries and able to look back to a time when\ntheir forebears had enjoyed independence, the various peoples of the region took\nadvantage of the empire\u2019s growing weakness to rise up and regain their long-lost and\nmuch-cherished independence.17\nAfter 1960, a new generation of historians and political scientists began to\nchallenge this conception of nationalism. They reject outright the idea that nations are\nessential and timeless. Instead, these scholars argue that each is a cultural construct\nthat originates in a particular time and set of circumstances. They also contend that\nnationalist campaigns are not typically mass movements. On the contrary, they are\nalmost always the products of small groups of elites who organize them in order to\nachieve political or economic ends that they could not attain under outside rule. Only\nafter they have successfully achieved independence and established a state do those\ngroups set about creating a sense of national identity\u2014a task they undertake for the\npurpose of securing the loyalty of the people who live within the new country\u2019s borders.\nIn other words, this interpretation contends that a widely held sense of national identity\ndoes not precede the creation of the state; instead, it emerges after the state\u2019s\nestablishment, and does so as a result of a concerted effort on the part of powerful\n16 Richard J. Evans, The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914 (New York, New York:\nPenguin Books, 2016), 53\u201359.\n17 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 70. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 219\ninterests to establish a shared sense of membership in what the influential political-\nscientist Benedict Anderson calls the \u201cimagined political community\u201d of the nation.18\nBased on this conception of nationalism, scholars of the Ottoman Empire like\nDonald Quataert now dismiss the older idea that surging nationalist sentiments caused\nby purported Ottoman misrule produced the independence movements that rocked the\nBalkans after 1800. Drawing on Anderson\u2019s ideas, they argue that through the mid-\nnineteenth century, nationalism and national identity remained foreign concepts in a\nregion in which occupation and religion rather than ethnicity or even language defined\nidentity. Thus, scholars arguing from this perspective contend that nationalism did not\nspark the emergence of independence drives in the Balkans; instead, small groups of\nlocal elites created and led those movements in order to achieve narrow political and\neconomic goals. Later, after they had won independence from the sultanate, those\nelites began to promote new, nationalist-based identities in order to secure the loyalty of\nthe people that they ruled. In other words, this interpretation holds that it was only after\nelites had achieved independence that they developed new national symbols and\nrepurposed historical events into collective, nationalist myths and thus created the\n\u201cimagined political community\u201d on which a shared sense of national identity rests\u2014most\nnotably when Serbian nationalists transformed the Battle of Kosovo (1389) from an\nordinary military defeat into a glorious if doomed, lost-cause struggle against foreign\ndomination.19\nFrench and British Support\nIn conjunction with these revolts, renewed Russian aggression put the Eastern\nQuestion back on the front burner in the late 1820s. At that time, St. Petersburg was\nanything but shy about acting to achieve its goals vis-\u00e0-vis the Ottoman Empire. Taking\nadvantage of the Greek revolt, the tsar had followed the Battle of Navarino by going to\nwar with the now-nearly defenseless sultanate. Russia won a quick victory and secured\nsignificant concessions through the Treaty of Adrianople that ended it. Later, after\nRussian troops protected Istanbul from the army of the rebellious Mehmet Ali in 1833\u2014\na stunning case of the fox guarding the hen house\u2014the tsar\u2019s government compelled\nSultan Mahmud II (r. 1808-1839) to sign the Treaty of Hunkar Iskelesi, which, while\nnominally a defensive agreement between equals, was, in reality, an entirely one-sided\ndeal that promised to reduce the Ottoman Empire to little more than a Russian\nprotectorate.20\nThese actions greatly alarmed the British and French governments. Much of their\nconcern lay rooted in the diplomatic risks that they perceived in tsarist dominance of the\nOttoman Empire. Both Paris and London were acutely aware that Russian control of the\n18 Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of\nNationalism, Revised edition (London: Verso, 2006), passim; quote from page 6.\n19 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 188\u201390; Calic, The Great\nCauldron, 217\u201318; Quote from Anderson, Imagined Communities, 6.\n20 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 34\u201337. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 220\nstraits or the Balkans would pose a grievous danger to the balance of power in Europe\nand likely produce a devastating general war among the Great Powers. For that reason\nalone, they were determined to limit St. Petersburg\u2019s influence over the Sublime Porte\nand, especially, to prevent it from acquiring Constantinople or the empire\u2019s territory in\nthe Balkans.21\nLondon had a second, more self-interested geostrategic reason to oppose the\ngrowth of Russian influence in the Ottoman Empire: the threat that tsarist dominance of\nthe sultanate would pose to its vital Indian colony. Keenly aware of India\u2019s critical\nimportance to the security and economic strength of Britain, London viewed Russia\u2019s\nefforts following the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) to expand into the Middle East and\nCentral Asia with mounting alarm. The result was the \u201cGreat Game\u201d: the economic,\npolitical, and diplomatic struggle between London and St. Petersburg for influence over\nthe regions that lay between India and Russia. Unsurprisingly, the Ottoman Empire\nloomed large in Britain\u2019s approach to the Great Game. If Russia was able to exploit the\nSublime Porte\u2019s weakness to gain control of ports on the Persian Gulf, its ships would\nbe in a position to interdict the vital maritime communications with India on which the\nsecurity and economic might of the British Empire rested. Conversely, if London could\npreserve the Ottoman Empire intact, it could function as a critical buffer state that could\nhelp to contain Russian influence.22\nParis and London\u2019s concerns about Russian influence over the Sublime Porte\nalso stemmed from the substantial economic stake that they had acquired in the\nsultanate. Their commercial preeminence in the empire was largely a function of the\ncapitulatory treaties that they had signed with Istanbul in the late-sixteenth century.\nThanks to the exemption from Ottoman taxes and customs duties that those\nagreements afforded them, British and French merchants had gradually assumed\ncontrol of the empire\u2019s lucrative international trade. Their economic dominance of the\nOttoman Empire grew even more substantial starting in the late 1830s. In a treaty we\nwill discuss in more detail presently, the Sublime Porte agreed in 1838 to transform the\nCapitulations into free-trade agreements that established import duties at rates so low\nthat the empire could no longer protect domestic industries from European competition.\nOver the course of the nineteenth century, as a result, the Ottoman Empire gradually\nbecame a neo-colony of France and Britain\u2014serving as a source of cheap raw\nmaterials and a market for their factory-produced finished goods.23\nMaking matters worse, the capitulatory agreements included a provision that\nallowed Ottoman Christians to purchase certificates called berats from European\nconsulates entitling them to the same tax exemptions and legal protections that\n21 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 56.\n22 Edward Ingram, \u201cGreat Britain\u2019s Great Game: An Introduction,\u201d The International\nHistory Review 2, no. 2 (1980): 160\u201371.\n23 Carter V.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 221\nEuropean merchants enjoyed. Originally intended to be a limited perquisite reserved for\na small number of diplomatic translators, the system came to be massively abused in\nthe nineteenth century when hundreds-of-thousands of Ottoman subjects obtained\nberats and the tax advantages that they conferred. As a result, European-affiliated\nmerchants, particularly those whose berats linked them to Britain and France, came to\ndominate the coastal trade in the empire, while European consulates, entitled to\noversee the legal affairs of their states\u2019 berat holders, assumed sovereign powers within\nthe empire.24\nEconomically, in other words, London and Paris had a great deal at stake in the\ncontinued independence of the sultanate. Were St. Petersburg to solidify its dominant\nposition in the empire, it could replace the capitulations with protective tariffs\u2014a move\nthat the Sublime Porte was too weak to make on its own. In turn, those Russian-\nenforced tariff barriers would likely shut British and French merchants out of the\nOttoman Empire and, in so doing, deny their factories both the raw materials they\nneeded for the production of finished goods and the overseas markets necessary for the\ndisposition of their surplus production.\nThus, for a combination of strategic and economic reasons, Britain and France\ngradually shifted their approach to the Ottoman Empire after the Napoleonic Wars.\nDetermined both to retain their privileged commercial position and to prevent St.\nPetersburg from upsetting the prevailing diplomatic order, they committed themselves to\npreserving the empire\u2019s territorial integrity and to limiting Russian influence over the\nSublime Porte. British Foreign Minister Lord Palmerston (1784-1865) neatly\nsummarized this new approach shortly after the signing of the Treaty of Hunkar Iskelesi.\nHenceforth, he declared, it was British policy that \u201c\u2018[t]he Ottoman Empire was to be\npreserved, supported, reformed, and strengthened.\u2019\u201d25\nThe interplay between Russian aggression and French and British support for the\nsultanate would establish a recurring, cyclical pattern in the Ottoman Empire\u2019s\ndiplomatic affairs. Each cycle would begin with the sultanate suffering a serious military\nsetback either at the hands of Russian-backed nationalist groups or tsarist armies and\nthen being forced to sign a peace agreement in which it either ceded substantial\nterritory or made significant concessions to St. Petersburg. Alarmed by the threat both\nto their narrow economic interests and to the broader balance of power, Britain and\nFrance would then respond by joining with other concerned states such as the\nHabsburg Empire to compel Russia to agree to a reduction\u2014but not a full rollback\u2014of\nthe concessions it had secured from Istanbul. In doing so, Paris and London would\nensure the survival of a smaller, but-still coherent and independent Ottoman state even\nas they acted to appease popular opinion at home by pressing the Sublime Porte to\nimplement reforms designed to improve the rights of the empire\u2019s non-Muslims. This\n24 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 129; Bernard Lewis, The\nMiddle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years (New York: Scribner,\n1995), 295.\n25 Quoted in Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 375. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 222\n\u2018six-step forward, five-step back\u2019 pattern first began to take effect shortly after the\nconclusion of the Greek War of Independence when London compelled Russia to\naccept more-limited gains in the Treaty of Adrianople than its military success over the\nOttomans merited; it would remain in effect for the remainder of the nineteenth\ncentury.26\nThe Crimean War, 1853-1856\nThere was, however, one major exception to this pattern: the Crimean War of\n1853-1856. In that instance, rather than acting to reduce the tsar\u2019s gains after his\narmies had defeated the sultan\u2019s forces, Britain and France instead went to war with\nRussia in order to prevent it from assuming de facto control of the Ottoman Empire. The\nconflict had complex origins. Nominally, it was the byproduct of France\u2019s successful\ncampaign to have the sultan transfer control of the Christian Holy Sites in Palestine from\nthe Orthodox Church to the Catholic Church. In reality, the war stemmed from Tsar\nNicholas I\u2019s (r. 1825-1855) attempt to use this religious dispute as a pretext for\npressuring the Sublime Porte into granting his government sovereign power over the\nempire\u2019s vast Orthodox Christian population\u2014a concession that would have reduced\nthe Ottoman state to little more than a Russian appendage had it gone into effect. News\nof the tsar\u2019s demand hit London and Paris like a bombshell. Already alarmed by\nNicholas I\u2019s earlier suggestion that London and St. Petersburg should partition the\nOttoman Empire\u2014or, as he famously called it, \u201c\u2018the sick man of Europe\u2019\u201d\u2014the French\nand British governments responded by joining with the Sublime Porte to declare war on\nRussia. Fought almost exclusively on the peninsula for which it was named, the\nCrimean War differed from earlier conflicts between the Ottoman and Russian Empires\nin that it was the tsar\u2019s forces rather than the sultan\u2019s that were on the defensive. Costly\nto all its participants, the struggle finally came to an end in 1856 when the fall of the key\nport of Sevastopol compelled Nicholas I\u2019s successor, Tsar Alexander II (r. 1855-1881),\nto sue for peace.27\nThe Treaty of Paris that formally ended the war seemed on the surface to be a\nsignificant diplomatic victory for the Ottomans. Thanks to Britain and France\u2019s desire to\nkeep the Russians out of the Middle East, it contained terms that appeared to secure\nthe empire from further tsarist depredations. It barred Russia from operating or\nmaintaining naval forces on the Black Sea, compelled it to renounce any right to\nintervene on behalf of Orthodox Christians in the empire, and even required it to cede a\nsmall amount of territory in Bessarabia to the sultanate. More importantly, the treaty\ngave the Ottoman Empire a new degree of international legitimacy by welcoming it into\nthe Concert of Europe: the diplomatic structure that the victors in the Napoleonic Wars\nhad created to maintain peace and order in nineteenth-century Europe.28\n26 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 56; Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 34\u201337.\n27 M. \u015eu\u0308kru\u0308 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2008), 79\u201381; Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 438\u201345.\n28 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 458. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 223\nIronically, however, it soon became clear that the war had weakened rather than\nstrengthened the sultanate. The primary problem was the war\u2019s cost. The expense of\nthe war had been far greater than anticipated and compelled the Sublime Porte to take\nout substantial international loans. Unfortunately for the Ottoman government, those\nobligations soon revealed themselves to be beyond its capacity to service. As a result,\nthe Sublime Porte found itself in a steadily worsening fiscal position. Making matters\nworse, it soon became clear that London and Paris lacked the strength to ensure that\nRussia continued to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Paris\u2014particularly after\nFrance\u2019s stunning defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871. Thus, in the long run, the\nCrimean War not only resulted in the Ottoman Empire becoming mired in a gradually\nworsening fiscal crisis that left it at the mercy of its foreign creditors but also failed to\noffer it any real long-term security against the Russian threat.29\nPan-Slavism\nDespite its defeat in the Crimean War, meanwhile, Russia had not abandoned its\nefforts to assume a dominant position in the Balkans or to control the straits. In fact, it\nremained as committed as ever to exploiting Ottoman weakness to its advantage. With\nmilitary threats, diplomatic pressure, and proposals to partition the empire having\nbackfired so spectacularly in 1853, however, St. Petersburg felt compelled to pursue a\nsubtler strategy toward the Ottoman Empire after 1856. That new approach centered on\nusing the increasingly popular ideology of Pan-Slavism as a stalking horse for the\nadvancement of Russian interests. A variation of nationalism, Pan-Slavism had\nemerged in the mid-nineteenth century as a purported ideology of national liberation. It\nheld that the Slavic peoples of the Balkans were groaning under the weight of\noppressive and alien Ottoman rule and that they could best achieve their independence\nthrough collective action.30\nPan-Slavism thus appeared to provide St. Petersburg with a powerful ideological\ntool it could use to advance its designs on Ottoman territory. The key was its indirect\napproach. Supported by a well-orchestrated Russian propaganda campaign and by\nsubstantial covert assistance, Pan-Slavism had the potential to nurture nationalist\nmovements and, eventually, independent states among the millions of Slavs who lived\nin the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Balkans territory without directly implicating St. Petersburg. As\nthe most powerful Slavic state and as the self-proclaimed protector of the Slavic people,\nRussia would then be in a position to gradually assume suzerainty over these new\nnation-states. In other words, Pan-Slavism promised to achieve through indirect means\nthat which Russia had been unable to secure through intimidation or outright\nconquest.31\n29 Norman Rich, Great Power Diplomacy: 1814-1914 (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1991), 119\u2013\n21; Sevket Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2000), 213\u201314.\n30 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 479\u201380.\n31 Evans, The Pursuit of Power, 671\u201373. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 224\nThe Russo-Ottoman War of 1877-1878\nRussia\u2019s new approach began to pay dividends in the 1870s. Coming against the\nbackdrop of the Ottoman government\u2019s default on its international debt obligations\u2014a\ntopic we shall explore further in a moment\u2014nationalist uprisings broke out among the\nSlavs of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1875 and spread to Bulgaria in April 1876. Taking\nadvantage of the crisis, the autonomous principality of Serbia stepped up the pressure\non the Sublime Porte by declaring war two months later. The tsar\u2019s ministers were\ngleeful. With much of the Balkans in revolt, Russia appeared to have a golden\nopportunity to achieve its goal of assuming a dominant position in the region. Still, past\nexperience suggested that St. Petersburg needed to move cautiously. Accordingly, wary\nof repeating the aggressive approach that had sparked the Crimean War, it refrained\nfrom taking actions that might risk provoking Paris and London and instead waited to\nsee how the situation developed.32\nIt did not need to wait long. Lurid press reports about the \u201cBulgarian Horrors\u201d\u2014a\nseries of bloody attacks in which ill-disciplined Muslim irregulars massacred thousands\nof Bulgarian Christians\u2014had poisoned the British and French publics against the\nOttoman Empire; as a result, London and Paris were unable to provide Istanbul with\ndiplomatic support during the crisis. Now free to act, Tsar Alexander II responded by\nthrowing caution to the wind and declaring war on the Ottoman Empire in early 1877.33\nUnsurprisingly, the fighting went disastrously for the Ottomans. Despite vigorous\nearly resistance by the sultan\u2019s army, superior Russian forces won a series of decisive\nvictories on the frontier and then advanced rapidly into the empire. As a result, the\nSublime Porte was compelled to sue for peace in January 1878. Signed just two months\nlater, the Treaty of San Stefano that formally ended the war reflected both Russia\u2019s\nbattlefield victories and the Ottoman Empire\u2019s diplomatic isolation. By its terms, the\nsultan ceded substantial territory in the Caucasus and agreed to the creation of a huge,\nindependent Bulgarian state that stretched from the Black Sea to the Aegean coast\u2014\nthereby dividing the Ottoman Empire\u2019s remaining Balkan possessions in half. More\nimportantly, as it was well understood that Bulgaria was going to be a Russian\nprotectorate, the treaty effectively made St. Petersburg the dominant power in the\nBalkans and, pivotally, gave it unimpeded access to the Mediterranean for the first\ntime.34\nThe Treaty of Berlin, 1878\nIn securing those gains, however, Russia had once more badly overplayed its\nhand. Its sudden expansion into the Balkans posed a serious challenge to the balance\nof power on which European peace rested while its newfound access to the\n32 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 71\u201375.\n33 Z\u00fcrcher, 71\u201375.\n34 Douglas A.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 225\nMediterranean threatened London\u2019s vital communications with India via the recently\nopened Suez Canal. As a consequence, the earlier pattern wherein Britain and the\nother powers intervened to prevent Russia from dismembering the Ottoman Empire\nreasserted itself\u2014this time in the form of the Congress of Berlin, an international\nmeeting that took place in the summer of 1878 in the capital of the recently unified\nGerman Empire. Dominated by states such as Britain that wanted to rollback Russia\u2019s\nrecent achievements, the conference replaced the Treaty of San Stefano with a new\naccord, the Treaty of Berlin, that undid many of the gains that St. Petersburg had\nsecured earlier that year. It focused largely on Bulgaria. The Treaty of Berlin\ndramatically reduced Bulgaria in size, made it an autonomous part of the Ottoman\nEmpire rather than an independent state, and\u2014to the great relief of the British\ngovernment\u2014stripped it of territory along the Aegean Sea.35\nThese revisions were substantial, but, even with them, the events of 1877 and\n1878 constituted a crushing setback for the Sublime Porte. Put simply, while the Treaty\nof Berlin may have eliminated the worst aspects of the Treaty of San Stefano, it also\ncontained new and revised provisions that seriously weakened the empire. It affirmed\nRussia\u2019s territorial acquisitions in the Caucasus, allowed the Habsburg Empire to\noccupy Bosnia-Herzegovina, imposed a stiff indemnity on Istanbul, and, most\nimportantly, granted independence to the heretofore autonomous principalities of\nMontenegro, Serbia, and Romania. Meanwhile, in separate agreements, Britain took\npossession of Cyprus in exchange for a promise to guarantee the empire\u2019s Middle\nEastern possessions, and France acquired title to the nominally-Ottoman province of\nTunisia. These losses were enormous in both territorial and, especially, demographic\nterms. Indeed, while half the population of the empire had lived in its European\nprovinces prior to the crisis, thereafter, the share that lived west of the straits fell to a\nmere 20 percent.36\nThe Ottoman Public Debt Administration, 1881\nThe Congress of Berlin had one other vital consequence: it compelled the\nsultanate to accept the establishment of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration\n(OPDA) in 1881 in exchange for a significant restructuring of the Sublime Porte\u2019s\ninternational financial obligations. Set up in 1875 after the sultanate stopped servicing\nits foreign loans\u2014a point we shall return to presently\u2014the OPDA was a vast\nbureaucracy managed and staffed not by Ottoman officials but instead by Westerners\nappointed by the Sublime Porte\u2019s international creditors, who, with a mandate to ensure\nthe continued payment of the bonds on which the empire had defaulted, controlled a\nsignificant share of the sultanate\u2019s tax revenue. Efficiently run, its impact on the empire\nwas decidedly mixed. On the one hand, it succeeded over the next two decades in\nrestoring the Sublime Porte\u2019s creditworthiness on international money markets and in\nreducing substantially its foreign debt. On the other, by granting its international\n35 Evans, The Pursuit of Power, 677.\n36 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 54; Evans, The Pursuit of\nPower, 677. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 226\ncreditors first claim on the empire\u2019s tax revenues, it ceded an enormous degree of\nsovereignty to the West and turned the empire into a de facto financial colony of the\nEuropean powers. As important, the OPDA starved the Ottoman state of the revenue it\nneeded to construct desperately needed infrastructure and to support economic\ndevelopment and thus ensured that it remained locked in a position of dependency in\nrelation to the industrial West.37\nThe Eastern Response\nThe challenge that the increasingly powerful Western states posed to the\nOttoman Empire shocked the sultan\u2019s subjects and sparked a great deal of soul\nsearching both within the empire and in the broader Muslim world. The power of the\nRussian army and, especially, the discipline, tactical skill, and advanced weapons of the\nFrench and British troops that had fought in Egypt during the Napoleonic Era had made\nabundantly clear to even the most insular of observers that the Ottoman Empire and the\nbroader Muslim world had fallen distressingly far behind the West in technological and\nmilitary terms. It was a sobering realization\u2014one that raised a number of troubling\nquestions. How had the heretofore weak and impoverished West overtaken the once-\nmighty Ottoman Empire? How could the march of history\u2014hitherto understood to be\nunfolding according to a divinely-ordained plan in which the umma steadily outpaced\nother cultures\u2014have gone so distressingly off course? Most pertinently, how could\nMuslims best respond to the challenge that the increasingly powerful and aggressive\nWest posed?\nThese questions produced an enormous outpouring of thought, debate, and\naction over the course of the nineteenth century. Indeed, a wide variety of movements\u2014\nsome top-down, others populist\u2014would emerge at that time seeking to provide answers\nto these questions and a path forward for the empire and the Muslim world. The\nconclusions that they drew were varied, often contradictory, and, ultimately,\nunsuccessful in arresting the sultanate\u2019s continued decline relative to the West.\nNonetheless, by establishing patterns that later political and social movements would\nadopt, the ideas developed at that time would ultimately prove to be of enormous long-\nterm significance for the development of the Middle East.\nWesternizing Reforms in the Ottoman Empire: The Tanzimat Era, 1826-1876\nThe most important of the reform efforts of the nineteenth century was the\nTanzimat program undertaken by the Ottoman state. Meaning literally \u201creorganization,\u201d\nit was a top-down initiative designed to westernize the empire through the adoption of\nEuropean economic, social, and political practices. Launched by Sultan Mahmud II\n(r. 1808-1839) and overseen by reform-minded bureaucrats, it was an ambitious effort\u2014\none that appeared poised during the mid-nineteenth century to thoroughly modernize\nthe sultanate.\n37 Pamuk, A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire, 213\u201316. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 227\nObjectives\nWhile the Tanzimat program did not officially begin until the 1830s, it had\nimportant antecedents in an earlier reform effort launched in response to the crushing\ndefeats the Ottoman military had suffered at the hands of Russia in 1768-1774 and in\n1787-1792. Alarmed by these reverses, reform-minded officials determined that the\nempire had to begin fielding modern armies organized and equipped along European\nlines if it wished to avoid further territorial losses. As the reformers soon realized,\nhowever, doing so was not simply a matter of changing the armed forces\u2019 composition\nor its equipment. Instead, the sultanate could only maintain a modern military if it had a\nsophisticated and growing economy\u2014one that could supply the advanced weapons and\ncomplex logistical systems on which contemporary warfare depended.38\nIncreasingly, they also grasped that the modernization of the empire\u2019s military\nand economic superstructure would fail absent a more fundamental, root-and-branch\nreform of Ottoman society. Such was the lesson that they drew from Western Europe\u2019s\nrecent history. It showed that the extension of civil rights and the institutionalization of\nsocial and political equality\u2014at least for men\u2014were necessary preconditions for a\nrapidly growing economy; after all, the countries that had extended such rights to their\npeople had also been the first to industrialize.39\nThose legal guarantees were also prerequisites for the creation of a mass\nmilitary composed of motivated soldiers. This last point was the paradoxical lesson of\nthe Lev\u00e9e en Masse. By guaranteeing rights to its citizens and thus ceding power to\nthem, the government of France had secured the loyalty of the French people and\nideologically bound them to the survival of the republican state; as a result, it had been\nable to raise and field the huge armies of highly motivated soldiers needed to defend\nthe revolution in the mid 1790s. The success of the Lev\u00e9e en Masse dramatically\nshaped the thinking of Ottoman reformers. As the historian Donald Quataert writes, in\ntheir eyes, \u201c[t]he lesson was clear: universal conscription meant vastly enhanced\nmilitary and political strength. But, to render such conscription palatable, the state had\nto grant universal rights (to males).\u201d40\nInstituting universal rights would prove very tricky in the Ottoman Empire,\nhowever, because such a legal arrangement ran counter to the unequal group\u2014or\ncorporate\u2014structure of its society. It did so in two ways. First, according to the\nprevailing Ottoman system, the sultan\u2019s subjects enjoyed varying rights and privileges\ndepending on the group to which they belonged. The most fundamental distinction was\nreligious: Muslims enjoyed greater status than did non-Muslims. Even among the\nsultan\u2019s Muslim subjects, however, rights differed greatly. For example, while all\nMuslims paid lower taxes than did Christian and Jewish subjects, some, most notably\nthe Janissaries and certain guild members, were exempt from paying taxes altogether.\n38 Howard, A History of the Ottoman Empire, 230\u201333.\n39 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 67.\n40 Quataert, 67. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 228\nSecond, individuals in this system did not typically interact directly with the central state;\ninstead, intermediary groups\u2014be they millets, guilds, religious orders, etc.\u2014mediated\nbetween their members and the central government. For example, a Greek Christian\nwould pay taxes to a local tax farmer and would abide by a legal system administered\nand enforced by the Orthodox Church. The individual in question would thus have no\ndirect dealings with the central government; instead, the multezim to whom that person\nremitted taxes and the Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical officials who oversaw the legal\nsystem under which he or she lived would indirectly connect them to the Sublime\nPorte.41\nSince these intermediary groups accorded their members disparate privileges,\ninstituting the universal rights that reformers hoped would bind people to the state\nrequired, as a first step, that the Sublime Porte abolish those bodies or eliminate their\nlegal standing. Once it had done so, the state could then build direct relationships with\nits people\u2014particularly with the sultan\u2019s heretofore socially and legally inferior non-\nMuslim subjects\u2014and grant them the civil liberties that the reformers believed would\nensure their loyalty. Eliminating the empire\u2019s many corporate bodies would not be an\neasy task, however. Those groups were deeply embedded in the structure of Ottoman\nsociety and had leaders that would staunchly oppose any change that threatened to\nreduce their prerogatives.42\nMilitary Reforms\u2014the \u201cAuspicious Incident,\u201d 1826\nOne group in particular promised to bitterly resist the reform efforts: the\nJanissaries. A serious problem for the Sublime Porte for some time, the Janissaries had\nbecome a millstone around the neck of the Ottoman Empire by the turn of the\nnineteenth century. They were not only militarily ineffective, but, worse, they had fueled\ninstability by deposing sultans and by using their location adjoining the palace to\nrepeatedly block any meaningful efforts to reform the government or the military.\nIndeed, they would play a leading part in crushing an effort to create a new, modern\ncorps called the Nizam-I Cedid, or New Order Army, that reform-minded officials hoped\nwould give the empire a force that could fight European armies on an equal footing.43\nLaunched in the 1790s under the direction of Sultan Selim III (r. 1789-1807), the\nNew Order Army was an experimental force that fought using modern European\nweapons, tactics, and discipline. Small in size, it proved its worth when it managed to\nstand toe-to-toe with Napoleon\u2019s elite troops in Egypt in 1799. In fact, it performed so\nwell against the French that Selim III and his ministers ordered the New Order Army\u2019s\nexpansion. Unfortunately for the reformers, the Janissaries did not share their\nenthusiasm for the Nizam-I Cedid. They had grudgingly tolerated the New Order Army\nwhen it had been a small, experimental force, but they feared that its growth would cost\nthem their dominant political position and thus were determined to prevent its\n41 Quataert, 63\u201365.\n42 Quataert, 45\u201346, 136\u201337.\n43 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 44. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 229\nexpansion. Accordingly, in conjunction with other conservative forces, the Janissaries\nrose up in rebellion in 1807. After deposing and killing Selim III, they made certain that\nthere would be no further attempts to reform the military by compelling the new sultan,\nMustafa IV (r. 1807-1808), to disband the New Order Army.44\nThe successful uprising demoralized the reformers. Having seen firsthand what\nWestern soldiers were capable of, they believed that the empire could only stave off its\nenemies if it too possessed a modern army such as the Nizam-I Cedid. In their eyes,\ntherefore, the Janissary revolt had not merely set the Ottoman military back for decades\nbut had also enormously complicated the Sublime Porte\u2019s efforts to navigate a rapidly\nworsening diplomatic environment. The uprising did come with a silver lining, however:\nit clarified the initial step that the reformers needed to take if they wished to achieve a\nbroad restructuring of the Ottoman government. That is, the events surrounding\nSelim III\u2019s deposition demonstrated that the first move in any consequential reform effort\nwould have to be the elimination of the Janissary corps; until it had been eradicated, no\nmeaningful restructuring of the empire was possible.45\nIts destruction finally came to pass in the mid 1820s as a result of careful\nplanning on the part of Sultan Mahmud II and his advisors. Aware that the qualitative\ngap between the armies of the Ottoman Empire and those of the Western powers was\ncontinuing to widen, Mahmud II had for some time hoped to restart Selim III\u2019s military\nreform program. Recalling what had happened to his predecessor, however, he grasped\nthat he needed to move very carefully lest he incite the Janissaries and their supporters.\nThe new military modernization initiative that he announced in 1826 thus called not for\nthe creation of a new, competing force like the Nizam-I Cedid but instead for the gradual\nrestructuring of the Janissary corps itself along European lines. In other words, it\nseemed to be a compromise proposal that promised to finally provide the empire with a\nmodern army while simultaneously permitting the Janissaries to retain their privileged\npolitical position. Even this moderate proposal did not sit well with the corps, however.\nComplaining that the new training regimen was contrary to their traditional methods, the\nJanissaries responded by once again rising up in revolt. It seemed like an inauspicious\nbeginning to the reform program. Indeed, to the casual observer, it appeared that\nMahmud II\u2019s effort to modernize the military had begun unravelling even before it\nstarted.46\nThe sultan and his advisors were unfazed by the Janissaries\u2019 latest rebellion,\nhowever. Aware that the soldiers were likely to resist the restructuring program, the\nreformers had quietly laid the groundwork for a military operation against them should\nthe need arise. Well in advance, they had rallied key groups and institutions to their side\nin order to ensure that they had support for the move against the corps; more\nimportantly, before announcing the reform proposal, the sultans\u2019 advisors had deployed\n44 Ali Yaycioglu, Partners of the Empire: The Crisis of the Ottoman Order in the Age of\nRevolutions (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2016), 38\u201364.\n45 Yaycioglu, 38\u201364.\n46 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 318\u201322. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 230\nto the palace a substantial force of dependable soldiers that had been secretly trained\nand equipped with modern European weapons. Then, using the revolt as a pretext, the\nreformers ordered the loyal soldiers to mount a sudden assault on the corps\u2019 barracks. It\nwas an enormous success. Making liberal use of modern cannons, the sultan\u2019s troops\nkilled 6,000 Janissaries in a mere twenty-one minutes and reduced their barracks\u2014the\nphysical manifestation of the Janissaries\u2019 power\u2014to a smoldering ruin. By nightfall, the\n\u201c\u2018Auspicious Incident,\u2019\u201d as the assault soon came to be known, had completely\neradicated the corps. The road to reform now lay open.47\nThe reformers moved quickly to take advantage. Unsurprisingly, they began by\naggressively pushing forward with their military modernization scheme. Over the next\nfew decades, they dramatically increase the size of the central government\u2019s army and\nrebuilt it along European lines. As a result, Ottoman soldiers were soon wearing\nWestern-style uniforms, training in accordance with the most up-to-date military\ndoctrines, and going into battle equipped with modern weapons.48\nMahmud II and his advisors had only gotten started, moreover. Determined to\npush forward with the more fundamental changes that they believed the empire needed,\nthey followed the destruction of the Janissaries by launching a series of social,\neconomic, and political reforms. These included greater central government control over\nthe provinces, a census conducted in 1830-1831 that permitted the treasury to assert\ncontrol over the collection of taxes, and the reorganization of the bureaucracy along\nmodern, European lines through the creation of new departments including the\nministries of finance, foreign relations, and interior.49\nThey also instituted far-reaching changes to the laws that governed how men\ncould dress\u2014a move that constituted the first step in the elimination of social\ndistinctions between groups. Traditionally, the government had enforced a complex\nseries of sartorial laws that visibly differentiated people according to their rank and\nstatus. These required the sultan\u2019s subjects to wear clothing that indicated their religious\naffiliation and class status and included a series of tortuously complex rules about the\ntype, size, and color of turbans that each rank of Ottoman official could wear. Seeking to\nmove the empire toward a system of greater equality, Mahmud II ordered that the\nexisting sartorial laws be superseded in 1829 with new regulations that imposed a\ncommon dress code designed to obscure social and political hierarchies and to\nundermine group identity. Central to this effort was the replacement of the myriad\nturbans that officials had worn with a new type of hat, the fez, that men of any rank or\nreligion could wear.50\n47 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 433\u201338.\n48 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 39\u201343.\n49 Findley, 39\u201343.\n50 Donald Quataert, \u201cClothing Laws, State, and Society in the Ottoman Empire, 1720-\n1829,\u201d International Journal of Middle East Studies 29, no. 3 (1997): passim. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 231\nRose Chamber Edict, 1839\nThe reform effort took a major step forward in 1839 when Sultan Abdulmecid I\n(r. 1839-1861) issued the Rose Chamber Edict. This proclamation formally inaugurated\nthe Tanzimat Era by promising a comprehensive array of reforms. These included the\nreplacement of tax farming with a fair system of direct taxation, the promulgation of laws\nguaranteeing the security of life and property, the establishment of an equitable system\nof military conscription, and the creation of an efficient bureaucracy. Importantly, the\npromised provisions were universal in nature and thus bound the government to legally\nand socially emancipate the sultan\u2019s millions of non-Muslim subjects. The Rose\nChamber Edict did not itself carry the force of law; instead, it merely affirmed that the\ngovernment would soon pass such legislation. Nonetheless, by committing the state to\na sweeping program of reform aimed at erasing the legal privileges enjoyed by the\ndifferent intermediary bodies, the proclamation marked a watershed moment in the\nempire\u2019s history and ushered in a period of rapid change.51\nUnder the direction of the central bureaucracy, which emerged as the dominant\npolitical force during the Tanzimat Era, the Sublime Porte followed with a series of\nreforms in the 1840s and early 1850s aimed at remaking the empire\u2019s social, political,\nand economic systems along the lines articulated in the Rose Chamber Edict. In the\nsocial realm, the government instituted mixed commercial courts for hearing cases\ninvolving people from different confessional groups, drew up plans for a system of\ncompulsory, secular education centered on a curriculum that stressed loyalty to the\nstate, and replaced the term dhimmi with the designation \u201c\u2018non-Muslim Ottoman\u2019\u201d\u2014\nthereby blurring the previously sharp legal distinction between Muslims and non-\nMuslims. In economics, it sought to effect greater growth by introducing paper money,\nby stabilizing the value of the currency, by adopting the practice of state budgeting, and\nby enacting a new commercial code based on French law that included provisions for\nbankruptcy and partnerships. Politically, finally, it adopted a national flag and a national\nanthem as unifying symbols, established the first post offices in the empire, and sought\nto exert greater central control over the provinces.52\nHatti-i Humayun, 1856\nIssued in 1856, a second statement of intent extended and clarified the Rose\nChamber Edict. Though the reformers enthusiastically supported it, the announcement\u2019s\ngenesis lay not in their hopes for further restructuring but instead in Britain\u2019s insistence\non the issuance of a more concrete elaboration of the new rights that the sultan\u2019s\nsubjects were to enjoy. Two issues drove London to call for a new declaration. First, the\nBritish government was keenly aware that continued discrimination along religious lines\nabetted St. Petersburg\u2019s ability to use its claim to be the protector of Orthodox\nChristians to stir up instability in the Balkans. Second, as in other Western states,\n51 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 403\u20134.\n52 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 453\u201354; Quote from\nHanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 86\u201391. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 232\npopular opinion in Britain was increasingly dissatisfied with the continued second-class\nstatus of Ottoman Christians and had begun to demand that the British government\npressure the Sublime Porte to move forward with the reforms it had promised in 1839.\nAccordingly, shortly before the Crimean War came to an end, London made both\nadmission into the Concert of Europe and continued British diplomatic support of the\nempire contingent on the issuance of a new statement that would articulate the rights\nthat the Rose Chamber Edit had promised to non-Muslims.53\nIn response, the reformers who dominated the Ottoman bureaucracy had the\nsultan issue a follow-up edict in 1856, the Hatti-i Humayun, that focused on articulating\nthe new legal and social position that the empire\u2019s Christian and Jewish minorities\nwould henceforth enjoy. It guaranteed religious freedom, explicitly opened civil-service\nemployment and schools to non-Muslims, promised the abolition of the death penalty for\nMuslims who converted to Christianity or Judaism, ended the jizya, and, most notably,\nmade non-Muslims subject to conscription for the first time. As important, the edict\nmarked the point at which the sultanate replaced its traditional embrace of Sunni Islam\nas a means of legitimating the government with Ottomanism, a new ideology designed\nto counter the centrifugal force of nationalism through the promotion of loyalty to the\nOttoman state on the basis of universal equality.54\nThe Hatti-i Humayun marked another important step in the empire\u2019s reform\nefforts. However, it is important to understand that many of its provisions were not as\nsweeping as they may have appeared at first blush. The ban on the death penalty for\napostasy on the part of Muslims was symbolically important, for example, but of little\npractical consideration in light of the fact that the Ottoman government and religious\nhierarchy had long tolerated conversion to Judaism or Christianity.55 More importantly,\nthe elimination of the jizya and the expansion of the draft to include non-Muslims turned\nout to be largely cosmetic. It is true that the edict expanded conscription to encompass\nChristians and Jews; however, the Hatti-i Humayun also included a provision permitting\nnon-Muslims to pay an annual exemption tax that released them from the obligation to\nserve. Both the Ottoman government and the empire\u2019s religious minorities embraced\nthis loophole. Keen to avoid serving in the sultan\u2019s army, non-Muslims were only too\nhappy to pay the exemption tax. Though securing large numbers of committed recruits\nwas a key aim of the reform program, meanwhile, the Ottoman government was\nperpetually in such desperate financial straits that it was more than willing to forego\nsoldiers in exchange for tax revenue. In practical terms, in other words, the Hatti-i\nHumayun resulted in the perpetuation of the jizya system\u2014the payment of a tax in lieu\nof military service\u2014albeit as a voluntary arrangement and under a new name.56\nThe limits of the Hatti-i Humayun were also evident in the fact that many Ottoman\nsubjects saw little improvement in their rights or legal standing as a result of the reform\n53 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 457\u201362.\n54 Finkel, 457\u201362, 475.\n55 Conversion to Shi\u02bfi Islam was a different matter altogether, however.\n56 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 460\u201361. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 233\neffort. This reality was most apparent with regard to Muslim women. While they did gain\naccess to education thanks to the Hatti-i Humayun, they saw no liberalization to their\nsartorial code and continued to face legal action when dressed in a manner that the\nstate deemed too revealing. Worse, the gradual adoption of secular laws based on\nWestern codes came at the cost of many of the property rights that Muslim women had\ntraditionally enjoyed under Islamic law.57\nStill, these important caveats aside, the Hatti-i Humayun and the other Tanzimat\nreforms were of enormous consequence thanks to the fact that they mounted a direct\nchallenge to the corporate structure of Ottoman society. The embrace of universal,\nindividual rights and the effort to establish a direct connection between the state and its\nsubjects squarely undermined the authority of the guilds, millets, and religious orders.\nLikewise, the related efforts to eliminate tax farming and to assert central control over\noutlying parts of the empire weakened the position of the local notables and provincial\ngovernors who had long mediated between the Sublime Porte and the people of the\nprovinces. Finally, the guarantee of religious freedom that was inherent in the\nemancipation of Jewish people and Christians and the elimination of Islam\u2019s central\nsocial and political position in the empire eroded the privileged position that Muslims\nhad long enjoyed and undercut the power of the \u02bfulama\u02be.58\nOpposition\nPredictably, the Tanzimat reforms generated hostile reactions from those who\nlost status and privilege. Muslims were the most vocal in complaining about them.\nOrdinary Muslims protested the relative decline that the changes brought to their social\nstanding while the \u02bfulama\u02be criticized the gradual displacement of Islamic law by secular\nlegal codes and condemned the idea of social equality between Muslims and dhimmi.\nAs one conservative religious scholar declared shortly after the issuance of the 1856\nedict, \u201c\u2018[f]or Muslims this is a day to weep and moan.\u2019\u201d Muslims were not alone in\ncomplaining about the Hatti-i Humayun, however. Provincial governors and rural\nnotables also bitterly fought what they correctly saw as a threat to their autonomy and\nwealth. Perhaps surprisingly, even the leaders of the millets, bodies whose members\nclearly stood to gain, contested the Tanzimat. What explains their hostility? Why did\nthey oppose a reform effort that sought to enhance the rights of the empire\u2019s non-\nMuslims? They did so for reasons of naked self-interest. Jealous of their authority, they\ndemanded that the state refrain from directly granting new rights to individuals and\ncalled on it to instead apply the new privileges through the millets\u2014an arrangement that\nwould have permitted them to maintain the power that they wielded as intermediaries\nbetween the central government and the communities they had long overseen.59\n57 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 66\u201367.\n58 Quataert, 66\u201368.\n59 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 74\u201375. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 234\nAssessment\nIn the face of this opposition, how effective was the reform program at\nrestructuring the empire along Western lines and at building a new sense of Ottomanist\nidentity? While it certainly had its successes, in the end the results were at best mixed.\nOn the one hand, the reform effort had succeeded in destroying the Janissaries,\ndramatically improved the military, and modernized the central bureaucracy. Of pivotal\nimportance, it had also helped to solidify British support against both the internal threat\nthat Mehmet Ali posed\u2014a situation that we shall explore presently\u2014and the external\nchallenge that Russia presented. On the other, many of the reforms failed to produce\nthe intended results owing to a combination of poor execution and externally imposed\nlimits. For example, the effort to provide universal, compulsory education stumbled due\nto the lack of qualified teachers. Similarly, attempts to foster the development of a\nmodern economy foundered in the face of the Capitulations and the low import duties\nthat the European powers had compelled the empire to accept in exchange for their\ndiplomatic support.60\nMost importantly, the Tanzimat movement had failed spectacularly in achieving\nthat which had emerged as the empire\u2019s most pressing reform goal: winning the\nallegiance of its non-Muslim population. Despite the government\u2019s efforts, neither the\nreform program nor the Ottomanist ideology that the reformers had promoted with such\nvigor found traction with the sultan\u2019s non-Muslim subjects. The vast majority were either\nunmoved by the Sublime Porte\u2019s efforts to win their loyalty or had fallen under the\ninfluence of one of the nationalist ideologies that the new, ethnically defined states of\nthe Balkans had begun promoting in hopes of winning the loyalties of their co-\nnationalists who still lived under the sultan\u2019s rule. By the 1870s, in other words, no\npromise to rationalize the tax code, to reform the legal system, or even to grant\nuniversal rights and equality to all subjects could persuade the vast majority of the\nempire\u2019s remaining Christian subjects to express a sense of loyalty toward an empire\nthat many were ambivalent about and that a growing number wished above all else to\nleave. The response to the Sublime Porte\u2019s revocation of the provision permitting non-\nMuslims to purchase exemptions from conscription in 1908 made the failure of both the\nreformers\u2019 integrationist program and their promotion of Ottomanist ideology\nemphatically clear. Rather than embracing their newfound rights or accepting the\nresponsibilities that went with them, tens of thousands of the sultan\u2019s Christian and\nJewish subjects responded to the prospect of serving in the Ottoman military by\npromptly emigrating to the Americas.61\nThe Young Ottomans\nMounting frustration with the limited success and undemocratic nature of the top-\ndown Tanzimat program led to the emergence a competing reform effort known as the\nYoung Ottomans. Originating in the 1860s, this new movement was composed of a\n60 Hanio\u011flu, 92, 102.\n61 Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, 67. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 235\nloose coalition of liberal Muslim intellectuals, journalists, and writers. Disappointed by\nthe inability of the Tanzimat reforms to secure the empire, they came to a seemingly\nsimple but also hugely influential idea: that Islam and constitutional democracy were\ncomplementary and could be integrated. This they proceeded to do. They merged the\nideas of Western Enlightenment thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)\nand Montesquieu (1689-1755) with Islam\u2019s social-justice values and the Qur\u02bean\u2019s\nembrace of shura, or consultation, which they interpreted as a divine endorsement of\nIslamic democracy. The result was a blueprint for a government that was both\ndemocratic and Islamic\u2014one, the Young Ottomans believed, that could provide the just\nrule that the people of the empire sought even as it demonstrated to the predatory West\nthat the sultanate was a modern state capable of self-rule rather than a premodern one\nrequiring neo-colonial tutelage.62\nThe Young Ottomans did not need to wait long to see their dream of a\nconstitutional order take form. A succession of problems in the mid-1870s undermined\nthe legitimacy of the existing government and opened the door to the kind of sweeping\npolitical changes that they proposed. The first crisis was a fiscal one. After a serious\ndrought in Anatolia and the onset of a global depression in 1873, tax receipts fell to the\npoint that the Ottoman treasury could no longer service the empire\u2019s massive debt\nobligations; as a result, to the shock of European governments and domestic investors\nalike, the Sublime Porte went into default in October 1875. Meanwhile, as we have\nseen, the concurrent outbreak of nationalist revolts in the Balkans plunged the Ottoman\nEmpire\u2019s European territories into a complex diplomatic and military crisis that Russia\nseemed well positioned to exploit. Finally, Sultan Abdulaziz (r. 1861-1876) further\ncomplicated what was an already difficult situation by attempting to use the Balkan\nrevolts as a pretext to end the Tanzimat and to reassert sultanic absolutism. Coming on\nthe heels of the other crises, Abdulaziz\u2019s brazen move led the reformers in the\nbureaucracy to conclude that they had to take extreme actions. Accordingly, they joined\nforces with the Young Ottomans to launch a coup in early 1876 that put Abdulaziz\u2019s\nbrother, Abdu\u0308lhamit II (r. 1876-1909), on the throne.\nNow firmly in control of the state, the Young Ottomans and their allies wasted\nlittle time in remaking the empire along liberal, democratic lines. They started by drafting\nand putting in place a constitution that reflected both Islamic values and recent Western\npolitical science. Based on Belgium\u2019s constitution, it transformed the empire into a\nconstitutional monarchy\u2014albeit one that lodged substantial power in the sultan\u2019s hands.\nWith the increasingly grim Balkans crisis as a backdrop, they followed by holding\nelections for a bicameral parliament formally known as the General Assembly; to great\n62 \u015eerif Mardin, The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought: A Study in the Modernization\nof Turksh Political Ideas (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1962), passim.; Ira M.\nLapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 2nd ed.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 236\nfanfare, it began meeting in March 1877. Thus, despite the manifold crises of the mid\n1870s, democracy appeared to be taking root in the empire.63\nUnfortunately for the reformers, Abdu\u0308lhamit II was a staunch opponent of\nconstitutional democracy. Indeed, he had begun plotting a return to absolutist rule from\nthe moment he took the throne. It did not take long for him to put his plan into action.\nArmed with sweeping emergency powers accorded him\u2014ironically\u2014by the very\nconstitution he sought to overthrow, the sultan took advantage of the war that had\nbroken out with Russia to prorogue the assembly and to suspend the constitution in\nFebruary 1878. Firmly in control of the capital, he followed by intimidating the Tanzimat\nreformers and the Young Ottomans into accepting what amount to a self-coup, or\nautogolpe. Thus, in less than a year\u2019s time, the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Islamic-based, liberal\nconstitutional government\u2014the dream of the Young Ottomans\u2014had been replaced by a\nreturn to sultanic despotism.64\nDespite the failure of the movement in the short term, the Young Ottomans\nproved to be enormously influential in the long run both in the capital and in the broader\nMiddle East. Indeed, while their ideas played no role whatsoever in shaping the\nstructure of the government or the spirit of the laws under Abdu\u0308lhamit II, their vision of\nan Islamic democracy would remain the starting point for most political thinking inside\nthe empire for decades thereafter. Most notably, it would inform the political views\narticulated by an important underground resistance movement called the Committee for\nUnion and Progress (CUP) that we will examine in the next chapter.65\nWesternizing Reforms in Egypt\nThe Tanzimat bureaucrats and the Young Ottomans were not the only top-down\nWesternizing reformers in the empire in the nineteenth century. In fact, they were not\neven the first. Several decades earlier, a separate modernization effort had begun in the\nautonomous Ottoman province of Egypt, first under the direction of its Albanian-born\ngovernor, Mehmet Ali and later under his grandson, Ismail (r. 1863-1879). For a time,\ntheir restructuring effort appeared to be enormously successful and even seemed to\noutdo the central government\u2019s Tanzimat modernization program. Mehmet Ali and\nIsmail\u2019s achievements ultimately proved to be ephemeral, however. Not only did their\nreform effort flounder in the face of concerted European opposition, but, worse, it paved\nthe way for Britain to take control of Egypt on an ostensibly temporary but ultimately\npermanent basis in 1882.\nMehmet Ali\nMehmet Ali\u2019s meteoric rise occurred in the aftermath of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of\nEgypt in 1798. Deployed to the province as an officer in 1801, he took part in the Anglo-\n63 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 488\u201390.\n64 Finkel, 488\u201390.\n65 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 104. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 237\nOttoman military operations that ended the French occupation. Mehmet Ali did not leave\nthe province following the French defeat, however. Instead, sensing opportunity in the\npower vacuum that followed the evacuation of British troops in 1803, he arranged to\nremain in Egypt. Making skillful use of both his considerable diplomatic talents and the\n6,000-man military force he commanded, he then mounted a successful bid to compel\nthe powerful Mamluk landowners to accept him as the province\u2019s new ruler. He followed\nin 1805 by securing Selim III\u2019s reluctant acknowledgement of him as governor. Finally,\nsix years later, he removed the last meaningful restraint on his rule when he had his\nsoldiers massacre the Mamluks while they were attending a ceremony in the capital.66\nWith the Mamluks out of the way, Mehmet Ali was now free to pursue his goals\nunhindered. They were ambitious. He wanted nothing less than to break with the\nOttoman Empire and establish a powerful, dynastic state centered on Egypt. A shrewd\nman, he understood that the task he had set himself was a daunting one. Achieving\nindependence from the sultan and maintaining it in the face of the challenge that the\nrising European powers posed would require a strong army and navy. In turn, such a\nmilitary would demand an efficient central bureaucracy and a strong economy\u2014one that\nwas not merely able to generate the tax revenue that the state needed but that was also\nsophisticated enough to produce the uniforms, supplies, and state-of-the art weapons\nthat the army and navy required. In other words, Mehmet Ali could only achieve his\npolitical objectives if he first modernized and industrialized Egypt.67\nHe moved aggressively to do so from the moment he eliminated the Mamluks.\nHe began by seeking new sources of revenue to fund his ambitious program. He\nboosted government tax receipts by replacing the iltizim tax farms with direct levies and\nby imposing taxes on Egypt\u2019s many awqaf\u2014despite the fact that endowed land\ntraditionally enjoyed tax-exempt status. He followed by establishing state monopolies\nover the sale of key agricultural products including wheat, sugar, and, of special\nimportance, the high-quality, long-staple cotton that Egypt produced in abundance and\nthat Europe\u2019s textile mills voraciously demanded. To maximize the state\u2019s take, he\nbought these crops from peasants at fixed, low prices and then sold them internationally\nat higher, market-rate ones. These initiatives\u2014particularly the export monopolies\u2014were\nsuccessful. Thanks in part to the high price of grain during the Napoleonic Wars,\nMehmet Ali\u2019s government was soon collecting substantial amounts of revenue.68\nHe used that income to support an aggressive industrialization program. He\nestablished workshops that could manufacture goods that the province had previously\nimported like rope, metal items, and chemicals, and he hired European experts to help\n66 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 66\u201369.\n67 Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997),\n9\u201313.\n68 Khaled Fahmy, \u201cThe Era of Muhammad \u2019Ali Pasha,\u201d in The Cambridge History of\nEgypt.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 238\nestablish the schools, technical institutions, and military academies needed to produce\nthe skilled workers and soldiers on whom his ambitions depended. More importantly, he\nlavished funds on a new textile industry that he hoped would be able to compete with\nthe more mature ones in Britain, Belgium, and France. Boosted by governmental\nsupport and cheap, state-subsidized cotton, it expanded rapidly. Indeed, by 1840, the\nEgyptian textile industry was producing more than 1.2 million items of calico per year.\nFinally, he tapped the state\u2019s new revenue sources to construct the workshops and\nshipyards required to make the uniforms, tents, muskets, cannons, and warships that\nhis modernized military would require.69\nNow adequately equipped and supported, it quickly proved its worth. At the\nsultan\u2019s request, he deployed troops to the Hijaz from 1811 to 1818 to reconquer Mecca\nand Medina from the Wahhabis, a puritanical Arabian religious group that had seized\nthe Holy Places in 1806. Well-armed and disciplined, his soldiers soon drove the\nWahhabis back into the desert; as a reward, the sultan permitted him to add the Hijaz to\nthe territory that he governed. Not long thereafter, he further expanded his fledgling\nempire by invading and annexing Sudan.70\nChanges in the Egyptian military\u2019s system of recruitment soon made his army\neven more powerful. Beginning in 1822, Mehmet Ali abandoned his earlier reliance on\ntraditional slave soldiers in favor of conscripting Egyptian peasants into a new, French-\ntrained army patterned after Selim III\u2019s Nizam-I Cedid. It was a fearsome and effective\nforce. Equipped with modern weapons, his disciplined army of Egyptian soldiers was,\nwithout question, the most powerful military force in the Middle East.71\nIndeed, it was so much more capable than the as-yet reformed Ottoman military\nthat Sultan Mahmud II felt compelled in 1824 to offer Mehmet Ali\u2019s son, Ibrahim (r.\n1848), control of Cyprus, Crete, and the Morea in exchange for Egyptian assistance in\nsuppressing the Greek Revolt. In the short term, the intervention proved successful.\nUnder Ibrahim\u2019s effective-if-brutal command, Mehmet Ali\u2019s powerful military made short\nwork of the Greek rebels and quickly returned the region to Ottoman rule. The very\nsuccess of the Egyptian army proved to be its undoing, however. Ibrahim\u2019s victory over\nthe Greeks alarmed Russia, France, and England, which, for different reasons,\nsupported Greek independence. The result, as noted earlier, was Western intervention\nin the conflict on the Greek side and, ultimately, the Battle of Navarino in 1827 that cost\nMehmet Ali the modern navy that he had so painstakingly constructed.72\nNavarino soon produced a serious crisis in the Ottoman Empire. Bitter over the\ndestruction of his fleet, Mehmet Ali demanded that the sultan compensate him for his\n69 Aksan, Ottoman Wars, 1700-1870, 308\u201313; David Landes, The Wealth and Poverty\nof Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor: Why Some Are So Rich and\nSome Are So Poor (New York: W.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 239\nlosses by granting him control of Syria. By that point, however, Mahmud II had become\nleery of his nominal subordinate\u2019s rising power and was determined to prevent him from\nfurther expanding his territory. Wagering that the Greek campaign had weakened the\nEgyptian army to the point that the Ottoman military could defeat it, he consequently\nrebuffed Mehmet Ali\u2019s demand. Furious, the latter responded by ordering Ibrahim to\ninvade Syria in 1831. It soon became clear that Mahmud II had miscalculated badly.\nWith the Egyptian army having long since fully recovered from the fighting in Greece,\nIbrahim quickly overran Syria before pressing on with an invasion of Asia Minor. There\nfollowed several months of fruitless negotiations after which Ibrahim decisively crushed\na much-larger Ottoman force near Konya in December 1832. The battle dramatically\nraised the stakes. It not only put the integrity of the Ottoman Empire into question but\nalso transformed what had been an internal conflict into a full-blown international\ncrisis.73\nWith Britain paralyzed at that time by domestic political issues, Russia took the\nlead in resolving what came to be known as the First Egyptian Crisis. Believing that a\nweak Ottoman Empire was more conducive to its territorial ambitions than a dynamic\nand powerful Egyptian state, St. Petersburg deployed troops to protect Istanbul and\ncompelled Mehmet Ali to order Ibrahim to withdraw from central Anatolia. The war thus\nended with the sultan still firmly in power and with nearly all of Asia Minor remaining\nunder direct imperial control. Still, the settlement was a highly favorable one for Mehmet\nAli. In exchange for halting his advance on the capital, the agreement he had negotiated\nwith St. Petersburg added Syria, Crete, and the Anatolian province of Adana to his\nburgeoning empire-within-an-empire.74\nNeither Mehmet Ali nor the Ottoman government were satisfied with the terms of\nthe Russian-brokered agreement, however, and their competing efforts to alter it would\nproduce another confrontation, the Second Egyptian Crisis, in 1839. Mehmet Ali set it in\nmotion. Intent on securing a complete break with the empire, he offered \u00a33 million to the\nsultan in May 1838 in exchange for full independence. Unwilling to countenance what\nwould have been the loss of nearly all of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Arab territories,\nMahmud II declined his nominal subordinate\u2019s offer. Instead, three months later, his\ngovernment countered the Egyptian ruler\u2019s proposal by agreeing to the Treaty of Balta\nLiman with London. On the surface, it appeared to be little more than a one-sided\neconomic agreement that came at great cost to the sultanate. A monument to free\ntrade, it banned monopolies throughout the empire and thus fully opened Ottoman\nmarkets to British merchants.75\nThose economic giveaways came with substantial political benefits for the\nSublime Porte, however. Analyzed on that level, in fact, the agreement revealed itself to\nbe a peculiarly shrewd move on Istanbul\u2019s part\u2014one that would greatly weaken Mehmet\nAli\u2019s position. It promised to do so in two ways. First, as its provisions applied to Egypt\u2014\n73 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 443\u201345.\n74 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 36\u201337.\n75 Fahmy, \u201cThe Era of Muhammad \u2019Ali Pasha,\u201d 174; Rogan, The Arabs, 80. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 240\nwhich remained, legally, a part of the Ottoman Empire\u2014the agreement required\nMehmet Ali to abolish the export monopolies on which his military power rested.\nSecond, since British merchants operating in Egypt would only benefit from the treaty\u2019s\neconomic concessions if that province formally remained part of the Ottoman Empire,\nthe agreement ensured that London would continue to back the Sublime Porte\u2019s efforts\nto prevent the Egyptian ruler from gaining independence.76\nNow confident that it could count on Britain\u2019s support, Mahmud II\u2019s government\nmoved to force a crisis by attacking Syria in 1839. Militarily, the invasion was an utter\ndisaster for the empire. Disciplined and better equipped, a much-smaller Egyptian force\nthoroughly routed the Ottoman army in June 1839. Diplomatically, however, it was a\nrousing success. Just as Ottoman officials had hoped, concerns about the possible\ndismemberment of the empire pushed the British government to intervene to end the\ncrisis. With the support of several other European states, it gave Mehmet Ali an\nultimatum in the summer of 1840 thinly disguised as a choice. If he agreed to accept the\nsultan\u2019s nominal authority, his position would become hereditary and he would retain\ncontrol of southern Syria; if he instead pressed on with the war, Britain would instead\ncompel him to immediately return all of Syria to sultanic rule.77\nMehmet Ali badly miscalculated when faced with this diktat. Determined to\nachieve real independence rather than mere autonomy, he defied London\u2019s demand\nand continued his war with the sultan. The vast gap between Egypt\u2019s military power and\nthat of the rapidly industrializing European states quickly made clear the futility of this\ndecision, however. The British government promptly responded by ordering the Royal\nNavy to sever the supply lines on which Ibrahim\u2019s troops depended for food and\nammunition\u2014thus exposing them to defeat by Ottoman forces. Mehmet Ali had no\nanswer to London\u2019s move. Accordingly, he reluctantly agreed to pull his soldiers out of\nSyria in early 1841.78\nThe Egyptian ruler had suffered a huge diplomatic setback in the Second\nEgyptian Crisis. It is true that he had secured an agreement in which the sultan formally\nrecognized him and his descendants as the governors of Egypt. However, that\nconcession had come with a stiff price tag: Egyptian control of Syria and the\nabandonment of his cherished dream of independence. Worse, defeat imposed a\nsecond-order cost of vastly greater consequence. As he was well aware, the\ncontinuation of Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt meant that he and his successors would\nhave to abide by the terms of the empire\u2019s foreign agreements including, most\nimportantly, the Treaty of Balta Liman. As such, he was compelled in the wake of the\nSecond Egyptian Crisis to dismantle the state monopolies and to drastically lower the\nexport duties that had constituted the financial foundation on which his army, his\n76 Fahmy, \u201cThe Era of Muhammad \u2019Ali Pasha,\u201d 174.\n77 Rogan, The Arabs, 79\u201381.\n78 Rogan, 79\u201381. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 241\nprogram of industrialization, and, ultimately, his power, rested. As a result, Mehmet Ali\u2019s\nstate-centered modernization program lurched to a halt in the early 1840s.79\nScholars have long been divided over the efficacy of his top-down development\nplan. Some argue that his forced-industrialization program\u2014particularly the textile\nindustry that he built\u2014produced impressive results. For example, the historian Jean\nBatou notes that Egypt at one point had the fifth most cotton spindles in the world and\nconcludes that \u201cits [industrial] achievements were not so different from those of certain\nWestern European regions.\u201d Scholars such as Batou also maintain that Mehmet Ali\u2019s\ndevelopment scheme was on track to industrialize Egypt and that it only failed because\nthe European states denied Mehmet Ali\u2019s government the right to erect protective tariffs\nor to subsidize its domestic production. Others are considerably less impressed with\nMehmet Ali\u2019s achievements, however. The historian David Landes contends that the\nEgyptian textile industry\u2019s reliance on expensive animal labor rather than coal or other\npower sources suggests that the province did not experience a genuine industrial\nrevolution in the 1820s and 1830s. More broadly, he argues that the failure of Mehmet\nAli\u2019s industrialization plan stemmed from internal shortcomings rather than from\nEuropean efforts to kill a potential competitor in its cradle and that it would have failed\nregardless of Western actions. The scholar Fahmed Khaley is similarly dubious. In his\nview, \u201c[a]n industrial experiment that was based on no more than seven or eight steam\nengines could [hardly mount] a serious threat to the mighty industries of Manchester\nand Liverpool.\u201d80\nWhether Egypt was doomed from the start or undermined by the industrial states,\nthe outcome was the same: Mehmet Ali\u2019s plan to turn his state into a military and\nindustrial power ground to a halt in the wake of the Second Egyptian Crisis. Indeed,\nwithin just a few years, Egypt\u2019s powerful military had shrunk to a shell of its former self.\nMore importantly, the province\u2019s once-rapidly growing, proto-industrial economy had\nbeen transformed into a colonial appendage of Britain that supplied its factories with raw\nmaterials and served as a market for its finished goods.81\nKhedive Ismail\nMehmet Ali\u2019s dream of turning Egypt into a modern state was not completely\ndead, however. Elevated to the rank of khedive, a Persian title analogous to the term\n\u2018viceroy,\u2019 his grandson Ismail launched a second, top-down effort to transform the\nprovince into an economic power beginning in the early 1860s. His achievements were\nbriefly dazzling and appeared for a time to have put Egypt on a path that would soon\n79 Rogan, 81\u201383.\n80 Jean Batou, \u201cMuhammad-\u2019Ali\u2019s Egypt.

Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 242\nsee it join the ranks of the world\u2019s economically developed states. In the end, however,\nhis ambitious program proved to be a spectacular and costly failure. Mismanagement\nand, more importantly, the staggering foreign debt on which his modernization scheme\nrested would not only prevent Egypt from transforming into an industrial power but\nwould also pave the way for Britain to turn the province into a de facto colony in 1882.\nIsmail was a man of enormous ambition. Though he did not seek to make Egypt\na great military power as his grandfather had, he shared his predecessor\u2019s desire to\ndramatically modernize its economy and to achieve political independence from both\nIstanbul and the increasingly rapacious European powers. Accordingly, he embarked on\na massive, state-led development program. To increase agricultural exports, he ordered\nthe government to construct numerous new port facilities and to dig thousands of miles\nof irrigation canals. Meanwhile, to end the country\u2019s dependence on low-margin\nagricultural exports, he expanded Egypt\u2019s rail network, built huge numbers of schools,\nand subsidized industries like sugar refining, paper milling, and cotton processing.\nFinally, to give the country the sheen of modernity, he invested huge sums into a project\nto transform Cairo into a European-style city. He constructed wide, straight boulevards,\noutfitted fashionable neighborhoods with gas lighting, and laid out a series of new parks\nand public gardens. He also ordered the erection of a new palace, an opera house, and\na national theater.82\nThese were important projects to Ismail, but they paled in comparison to the\ncenterpiece of his modernization scheme: The Suez Canal. The waterway was the\nfulfillment of an age-old dream to connect the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea at\nthe point where Egypt proper meets the Sinai Peninsula. The mid-nineteenth century\nseemed a propitious time to finally realize that vision. With the globe becoming more\nand more economically connected thanks to the industrialized states\u2019 seemingly\ninsatiable demand for raw materials, the proposed canal promised to be well utilized\nand immensely profitable. Egypt did not possess the capital and technical knowledge to\nconstruct the waterway itself, however. Accordingly, Ismail\u2019s predecessor, Said (r. 1854-\n1863), had entered into a joint venture with a French consortium under the direction of\nthe famed engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps (1805-1894) to dig the canal. By the terms of\nthe agreement, the French would supply capital, equipment, and technical knowledge in\nexchange for a 56 percent share of the canal while the Egyptian government would\nprovide land and corv\u00e9e labor\u2014uncompensated work by Egyptian peasants\u2014and\nwould retain the remaining 44 percent stake. Construction began under de Lesseps\u2019s\ndirection in 1856. Completed in 1869, the canal contributed enormously to the growth in\nworld trade that occurred in the late-nineteenth century. Almost overnight, it massively\ncut the cost to ship goods between Europe and South, Southeast, and East Asia and\nopened the east coast of Africa to European imperial penetration and control.83\n82 Dominic Green, Three Empires on the Nile: The Victorian Jihad, 1869-1899 (New\nYork: Free Press, 2007), 14\u201317; Rogan, The Arabs, 100\u2013101; Peter Stearns, The\nIndustrial Revolution in World History, 3rd edition (Boulder: Westview Press, 2007), 97.\n83 Rogan, The Arabs, 99\u2013100. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 243\nIt also gave Ismail the opportunity to present himself as a modernizer and global\nleader. He did so most famously in 1869 when he celebrated the canal\u2019s completion by\nhosting the cultural and political elite of Europe at a lavish series of parties, ceremonies,\nfireworks displays, and feasts highlighted by a performance of Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s opera\nRigoletto and by a ceremonial procession of ships headed by the French Empress\nEug\u00e9nie\u2019s (1826-1920) royal yacht. It was an impressive series of events and seemed\nto suggest that, under Ismail\u2019s leadership, Egypt was poised to join the ranks of the\nworld\u2019s developed states.84\nWhile the khedive\u2019s economic-development program appeared enormously\nimpressive for a time, it ultimately proved untenable. What explained its failure? At root\nthe problem was fiscal. Thanks to the interplay of three related issues, the Egyptian\ngovernment would find itself facing a serious budget crisis at the end of the 1860. First,\ncorrupt and ill-suited to overseeing the flood of initiatives that the khedive rushed to\nundertake, the Egyptian government proved incapable of either completing projects in a\ntimely manner or keeping them under budget. Second, Ismail himself was an infamous\nspendthrift who lived lavishly and who spent extravagantly on edifices such as the\nOpera House and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo that were designed not to be\nfinancially self-sustaining but instead to boost his international standing.85\nThese factors were surely important, but it was ultimately the means by which\nIsmail had financed his economic-development program that pushed his government to\nthe fiscal brink. As we have seen, the Treaty of Balta Liman had barred Egypt from\nimposing export duties or from operating state-owned agricultural monopolies. As such,\nthe treaty left Ismail with no option but to underwrite his aggressive modernization\nscheme by securing loans on international money markets using the tax proceeds of\nfuture cotton crops as collateral. At first, the terms were very good. Thanks to the\nNorth\u2019s blockade of the Confederacy during the American Civil War (1861-1865), the\nvalue of Egypt\u2019s cotton crop soared, and Ismail was able to borrow at very low interest\nrates. However, after Southern exports began to flood the market following the Union\nvictory in 1865, cotton prices\u2014and with them, Egypt\u2019s tax receipts\u2014collapsed.\nThereafter, Ismail could only pay his existing debt by taking on new loans at ever-higher\nrates of interest. By 1870, the situation had become unsustainable. With one-third of the\nstate\u2019s revenue committed to servicing the debt, the Egyptian government and Ismail\u2019s\neconomic modernization program were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.86\nThe khedive responded by taking drastic actions to keep Egypt solvent. While\nwell-intentioned, these efforts reflected short-term thinking and merely served to push\nhis government into an even deeper fiscal hole. Such was certainly the case with the\nMuqabala Law that went into effect in 1872. It offered landowners the opportunity to\n84 Green, Three Empires on the Nile, 1\u20135.\n85 F. Robert Hunter, Egypt Under the Khedives: 1805-1879: From Household\nGovernment to Modern Bureaucracy (Cairo: American University in Cairo Press, 1999),\n38\u201340.\n86 Hunter, 38\u201340. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 244\nreceive a permanent, 50 percent reduction in their tax assessment in exchange for an\nimmediate payment of six-years\u2019 worth of tax revenue. Unsurprisingly, the Muqabala\nLaw proved to be very popular with those wealthy enough to take advantage of it, and it\ngenerated a quick infusion of funds in its first few years. With equal predictability,\nhowever, it severely depressed the collection of taxes in subsequent years and thus\ndeepened rather than eased the growing debt crisis.87\nThereafter, the situation progressively worsened. By the mid 1870s, pressure\nfrom Egypt\u2019s creditors compelled Ismail to sell Egypt\u2019s 44 percent stake in the Suez\nCanal to the British government. This transaction once again brought a quick injection of\ncash, but, like the Muqabala Law, it did so at the cost of long-term revenue and thus\ncould only slow rather than arrest Egypt\u2019s ongoing slide into insolvency. Finally, in 1876,\nthe bill came due. No longer able to meet its obligations, Egypt called a moratorium on\nthe payment of its international debts\u2014in effect announcing that it was bankrupt.88\nAt that point, the British and French governments intervened to ensure that their\nbondholders were made whole. Initially, London and Paris did so by imposing on the\nEgyptian government what was known as the system of Dual Control; similar to the\nOPDA, it was designed to ensure that the khedive\u2019s government collected sufficient\nrevenue to service its debts. By its terms, a British economist would serve as Egypt\u2019s\nminister of finance and a Frenchman as minister of public works. Controlling Egypt\u2019s\nbudget, they were tasked with ensuring that it could fund its international debt, now\nconsolidated at a rate of 7 percent. But how would they come up with the revenue to\nmeet that obligation? They did so by imposing a biting austerity regime on the Egyptian\ngovernment\u2014one that saw wages and positions in both the bureaucracy and army\nsavagely cut.89\nIsmail initially accepted this arrangement. Dependent on the European states for\ntrade and financing, he had little choice but to comply. Chafing at the loss of power,\nhowever, he soon soured on the system of Dual Control and laid plans to exploit\npopular bitterness about the European-imposed austerity program to alter the terms of\nthe agreement. He made his move in 1879 when he dissolved the cabinet and formed a\nnew one that did not include any European ministers. He simultaneously demanded that\nhis creditors lower the terms of Egypt\u2019s consolidated debt to 5 percent. Unsurprisingly,\nthese moves went over like a lead balloon in Europe. Unwilling to accept either Ismail\u2019s\nchallenge to their authority or a further reduction in the interest paid to French and\nBritish holders of Egypt\u2019s debt, London and Paris refused to negotiate. Instead, they\nresponded by pressuring Sultan Abdu\u0308lhamit II to remove the khedive. Desperate at that\nmoment for British and French support against Russia, the Ottoman ruler was quick to\n87 Rogan, The Arabs, 120\u201321.\n88 Rogan, 120\u201321.\n89 F.

Accordingly, the sultan deposed Ismail in 1879 in favor of the khedive\u2019s son,\nTawfiq (r. 1879-1892), who quickly reinstated the system of Dual Controls.90\nThe \u02bfUrabi Revolt, 1881-1882\nEven then, Egyptians continued to resist Western dominance. This time,\nhowever, opposition did not come from the political elite but instead from the officers in\nthe Egyptian army. Furious that the austerity measures that the Dual Control\ngovernment had imposed had cut their wages in half in order to satisfy the interests of\nEuropean bondholders, a group of officers led by the revolt\u2019s namesake, Colonel\nAhmad \u02bfUrabi (1841-1911), organized a series of popular, proto-nationalist\ndemonstrations in 1881 under the slogan \u201c\u2018Egypt for the Egyptians\u2019\u201d aimed at\ncompelling Tawfiq to accept a list of reforms. Their demands included the formation of a\nnew cabinet, the approval of a new constitution, and the reconvening of the Assembly of\nDelegates\u2014a heretofore weak legislative body established in 1866 that Ismail had\nprorogued in 1879. Facing broad popular support for the revolt, the cautious Tawfiq had\nno choice but to comply. As a result, by February 1882, Egypt had a constitution, an\nempowered legislature, and a reform-minded cabinet in which \u02bfUrabi himself served as\nminister of war.91\nThe events of 1881 and early 1882 greatly alarmed Britain and France. \u02bfUrabi\u2019s\npresence in the government raised the prospect that Egypt might stop meeting its debt\nobligations under the Dual Control system and even the possibility that it might\nunilaterally abolish privileges such as the Capitulations that Europeans had long\nenjoyed in the province. Unwilling to countenance such changes, the French and British\ngovernments responded by sending a joint fleet to Alexandria for the purpose of\nintimidating the Egyptians into backing down. The deployment failed to achieve that\nend, however. Instead, the arrival of the warships merely served to enrage the Egyptian\npeople and to intensify the impasse between Cairo and the European states. By early\nJuly, as a result, Egypt had become a tinderbox\u2014a country destined to burst into flames\nin the presence of the tiniest of sparks.92\nOne was not long in coming. A fight between a Briton and an Egyptian in\nAlexandria in early July quickly transformed into a bloody riot in which over 125\nEgyptians and 50 foreigners died. The British fleet\u2014but not the French one, which had\nreceived orders from Paris to refrain from using force\u2014responded to the incident by\nbombarding Alexandria on July 11, 1882, causing heavy loss of life. Three days later,\nBritish troops landed with orders to restore order and protect Western property. Thought\nLondon claimed that its occupation was \u201c\u2018temporary,\u2019\u201d it made clear the following year\nthat it intended to remain in Egypt indefinitely by sending Evelyn Baring (1841-1917),\n90 Hunter, 195\u201397.\n91 Rogan, The Arabs, 123\u201328.\n92 Donald Reid, \u201cThe \u2019Urabi Revolution and the British Conquest,\u201d in The Cambridge\nHistory of Egypt.

Economically, it\nhad not only proven to be every bit as unsuccessful as his grandfather\u2019s industrialization\nscheme but, worse, had given rapacious Western imperialists the opportunity to reduce\nEgypt to economic servitude. Thereafter, foreign businesses and governments owned a\nhuge and growing share of the province\u2019s economy including its greatest asset, the\nSuez Canal, and they opted to repatriate their considerable profits to Europe rather than\nto reinvest them in Egypt\u2019s development. The political impact was even worse. The\nprovince may have technically remained an autonomous part of the Ottoman Empire,\nbut, after 1882, it was in reality a British colony in all but name\u2014one that served both as\nthe primary artery connecting the metropole to its prized colony of India and as the\nnexus of London\u2019s system of imperial defenses.\nPopulist Reform Movements\nNot all of the Muslim reform efforts of this period were top-down ones such as\nthose that occurred in Egypt and the Ottoman capital. On the contrary, the nineteenth\ncentury was a time of vigorous debates among intellectuals, religious leaders, and other\nnon-elites over how Muslims could best resolve the problems of their time\u2014particularly\nthe challenge posed by the West\u2014and reclaim what they saw as the Islamic world\u2019s\nrightful place as the globe\u2019s preeminent power. These debates produced a variety of\npopulist reform movements including two of enormous lasting influence: Islamic\nmodernism and Wahhabism.\nWahhabism\nWahabism predated substantial European penetration of the Middle East but\nwould come to offer an influential framework for understanding the source of Muslim\nweakness and for responding to the Western challenge. Its founder and namesake,\nMuhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792), developed its broad outlines while a\nreligious student in Medina. While there, his teachers had exposed him to the writings of\nthe thirteenth-and-fourteenth century Sunni theologian, Ibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328),\nwho had argued that Muslims could regain God\u2019s blessing in the wake of the Mongol\nconquest by returning to the core values and practices of the early community of\nbelievers and by purging those who refused to do so.94\n93 Donald Reid, 231\u201337; M W Daly, \u201cThe British Occupation, 1882-1922,\u201d in The\nCambridge History of Egypt. Volume 2, Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the End of the\nTwentieth Century, ed. M. W. Daly (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998),\n240\u201341.\n94 John L. Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, Fourth Edition (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2011), 144\u201346. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 247\nDrawing heavily on Ibn Taymiyyah\u2019s ideas, Abd al-Wahhab\u2019s new conception of\nIslam revolved around three broad, interrelated points. First, stressing tawhid or the\noneness of God, it held that the only acceptable way to practice Islam was by focusing\none\u2019s devotion exclusively on Allah. The inclusion of any intermediary figure or practice\nin the act of worship\u2014be it the intercession of the Shi\u02bfi Imams, the popular practice of\npraying at the tombs of Muslim saints such as Muhammad, the veneration of Sufi pirs,\nor even the observance of many religious holidays\u2014was to engage in idolatry or\npolytheism and was therefore shirk. Second, like Ibn Taymiyyah, Wahhabism\nchampioned the older ideology of Salafism: the idealization of the first few generations\nof Muslims and the belief that Islam could reform itself and end the problems of the\npresent day only through a return to the practices of the early umma. Accordingly,\nWahhabism held that all additions to the practice of Islam made after the seventh\ncentury had to be ruthlessly excised. Finally, drawing explicitly on the ideas of Ibn\nTaymiyyah and indirectly on Kharijism, Abd al-Wahhab\u2019s conception of Islam\nmaintained that God required all believers to engage in jihad against Muslims who had\ncorrupted the religion. All who resisted the imposition of Wahhabism\u2019s strict rules,\nanyone such as Shi\u02bfi and Sufis who had added new practices to the faith, and those\nwho practiced shirk were kafirs, or apostates, whom the umma was obliged to takfir\u2014or\nexcommunicate\u2014and kill.95\nAt first, Abd al-Wahhab\u2019s doctrine alienated many people; indeed, he was forced\nto flee his hometown of Al-\u2018Uyana, in eastern Arabia after he had a woman stoned to\ndeath for adultery. Soon, however, his message of religious renewal through a return to\nthe practices of the past gained a small but highly-committed following. Among them\nwas Muhammad Ibn Saud (r. 1726-1765), the ambitious chief of a small tribe that\ncontrolled the oasis town of Dariyah in the inhospitable central region of Arabia called\nthe Najd. Perceiving the benefits that could accrue from an alliance, the two men\nagreed to an arrangement in 1744 in which Ibn Saud recognized Abd al-Wahhab\u2019s\nreligious authority while Abd al-Wahhab acknowledged Ibn Saud\u2019s secular power. It\nwould prove to be a momentous agreement\u2014one that at last gave Abd al-Wahhab the\nopportunity to put his religious teachings into practice.96\nThe Wahhabi-Saudi alliance soon flourished. Under the skilled military leadership\nof Ibn Saud and his successor, Abdulaziz (r. 1765-1803), the zealous and disciplined\nWahhabi fighters quickly won control of central Arabia. They followed by launching\nreligiously motivated raids into Ottoman territory. In 1802, Abdulaziz\u2019s zealous and\nuncompromising soldiers attacked Karbala during the festival of Ashura. Brutally\nsacking the city, they killed more than 2,000 Shi\u02bfi worshippers and destroyed the Imam\nHusayn Shrine\u2014the burial place of the Third Imam. More spectacularly, Saudi forces\nseized Mecca and Medina from the sultan four years later. There, they banned the\nconsumption of coffee and tobacco, ordered all books other than the Qur\u02bean burned,\n95 Reza Aslan, No God but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam, Updated\nEdition (Random House, 2011), 246\u201347.\n96 Madawi al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, Second Edition (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2010), 17\u201318. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 248\nand compelled men to wear beards and women to seclude themselves. They even\ndestroyed the tombs of Muhammad and other prominent early Muslims to prevent\npeople from worshipping at them.97\nWahhabi control of Mecca and Medina posed a serious threat to the Ottoman\ngovernment. Not only did it prevent the treasury from receiving substantial and much-\nneeded tax revenues from the Hijaz, but, more importantly, it made a mockery of the\nOttomans\u2019 claim to be the protectors of the Holy Places and thus undermined the\nlegitimacy on which the dynasty\u2019s rule rested. Intent on nipping this new threat in the\nbud, the Sublime Porte responded by ordering Mehmet Ali to recapture the Hijaz and to\nput an end to the Wahhabi menace. Though resistance was fierce, the Egyptian ruler\nsucceeded in doing so. His troops not only restored the Holy Places to Ottoman control\nin 1811 but, after further hard fighting, managed to bring the Saudi state to heel in\n1818.98\nDespite its military defeat, however, Wahhabism remained a potent ideology. It\npersevered under the protection of a revived Saudi state and maintained a small but\ncommitted following of Muslims who believed that the umma had lost its way. Later, its\naustere, Salafist conception of Islam, previously shunned by most believers, would\nbegin to acquire a degree of theological legitimacy. Indeed, after the turn of the\ntwentieth century, growing numbers of Sunni Muslims would come to view it not merely\nas a way to purify and revive Islam but also as a prescription for how\u2014through\nscrupulous adherence to the canonical understanding of the traditions of the early\numma\u2014believers could reform their society and meet the growing challenge that\nEuropean imperialism posed to the Muslim world. Wahhabism thus offered a very\ndifferent model for addressing the European threat than that advanced by the top-down,\nWesternizing reformers in Istanbul and Cairo\u2014one that stressed that the Muslim world\ncould parry the West not by imitating it but instead by regaining God\u2019s trust through a\nreturn to the practices of the salaf.99\nIslamic Modernism\nSalafism also shaped the ideas of the Islamic Modernist movement that emerged\nin the late-nineteenth century. Like the Wahhabi, Islamic modernists such as the\nEgyptian Muhammad Abduh (1849-1905) were critical of those who called for Muslims\nto abandon their cultural traditions in favor of the wholesale adoption of Western ideas\nand values. They also agreed that Muslims needed to revive the practices and\nprinciples of the first few generations of believers. However, while the Wahhabis wanted\nto do so in order to reestablish a society based on the conservative religious scholars\u2019\ncanonical understanding of the early umma, the modernists instead sought to return to\n97 Sayed Khatab, Understanding Islamic Fundamentalism: The Theological and\nIdeological Basis of Al-Qa\u2019ida\u2019s Political Tactics (Cairo: The American University in\nCairo Press, 2011), 74\u201375; Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 248.\n98 al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 23.\n99 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 254\u201357. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 249\nthe values of the first Muslims for the purpose of freeing the contemporary Islamic world\nfrom what they saw as the suffocating tyranny of the superstitious and close-minded\n\u02bfulama\u02be.100\nIslamic Modernism\u2019s emergence as a powerful force in the Middle East stemmed\nlargely from the work of the Iranian-born writer and political activist Jamal al-Din al-\nAfghani. His early life gave no hint of his later radicalism. He received a typical Shi\u02bfi\neducation, followed the conventional path of an affluent Iranian, and held unremarkable\nviews. His understanding of the world changed with great suddenness, however, when\nhe witnessed Britain\u2019s brutal response to the anti-imperialist Sepoy Rebellion of 1857\nwhile a student in India. Shocked by the violence with which the British suppressed the\nrevolt, he experienced a dramatic and sudden transformation into a committed, lifelong\nfoe of imperialism\u2014a change that led him to think deeply about how the Muslim world\ncould most effectively respond to the rising threat that the West posed.101\nHe began by first seeking to understand how Islamic civilization had fallen so far\nbehind the West. To al-Afghani, the fact that Europe had managed to vault ahead was\npuzzling in light of the Muslim world\u2019s onetime enormous lead in commerce, science,\nand philosophical thinking. During the Arab Empire\u2019s golden age, he noted, Islam\u2019s\nintrinsic rationalism and embrace of reason had made the Caliphate the most\nscientifically and intellectually advanced civilization on earth. Indeed, modern Western\nscience and technology\u2014however impressive it may have been\u2014ultimately rested on\nearlier Muslim breakthroughs. So what had happened? How had the Islamic world fallen\nbehind?102\nIn al-Afghani\u2019s view, the answer was clear. He argued that the key moment in the\nMuslim world\u2019s intellectual decline had occurred in the thirteenth century when the\nreligious scholars had exploited the crisis atmosphere that the Mongol irruption had\ncreated to entrench themselves as the unquestioned arbiters of Islam. Emphasizing\ntaqlid\u2014the uncritical acceptance of existing views\u2014and calling for the closing of the\ngates of ijtihad, the superstitious religious scholars had effectively barred any effort to\nquestion their stifling, canonical understanding of scripture or religious law. Having\nsecured a monopoly over how people understood the Qur\u02bean and the shari\u02bfa code\u2014\nand thus over what kind of thinking was permissible\u2014they followed by imposing rigid\nlimits on scientific and intellectual inquiry that left little room for further discoveries. As a\nresult, al-Afghani concluded, Islamic civilization had become an intellectual backwater\nthat remained stuck in a Medieval mindset while the once intellectually inferior\nEuropeans had surged ahead.103\n100 Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition), 237\u201338.\n101 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 261\u201362.\n102 Esposito, Islam, 154\u201356.\n103 Christopher De Bellaigue, The Islamic Enlightenment: The Struggle Between Faith\nand Reason, 1798 to Modern Times (Liveright, 2018), 202\u20133; Aslan, No God but God\n(Updated Edition), 235. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 250\nBut how could the Muslim world end the monopoly that the \u02bfulama\u02be had\nestablished over understandings of the shari\u02bfa code and the Qur\u02bean? Al-Afghani\u2019s\nanswer lay, ironically, in reexamining the values of the first three generations of\nbelievers\u2014the source of the conservative religious scholars\u2019 dominance of Islam. Doing\nso, he contended, would permit Muslims to retake control of the past from the \u02bfulama\u02be\nand to purify Islam of the religious scholars\u2019 superstitious and anti-intellectual beliefs,\nthus permitting people to once again benefit from the religion\u2019s intrinsic rationalism.104\nAl-Afghani\u2019s leading disciple, the Egyptian legal scholar Muhammad Abduh, was\nparticularly vociferous in arguing for a return to the Islam of the Salaf as a way of\nbreaking the dominance of the religious scholars. To Abduh, the religion of the first\nMuslims was not the rigid or fixed system that the \u02bfulama\u02be described, but instead a\ndynamic set of vital moral and intellectual guidelines that people could revisit and\nreinterpret to meet the needs of each age. By retaking control of the past from the\nreligious scholars, he continued, Muslims could reopen the gates of ijtihad and thus\nengage in a much-needed critical reinterpretation of the sources of religious law\u2014the\nqiyas, ijma, sunna, and even the Qur\u02bean\u2014aimed at bringing the shari\u02bfa code in line with\nthe needs of the contemporary world. Free to reason once again, Muslims would\nthereafter achieve the scientific and technological breakthroughs that had in earlier\ntimes been the hallmark of Islamic civilization and, in so doing, would erase the gap in\npower that had opened between the West and the Middle East.105\nThe Islamic Modernists did not reserve their barbs exclusively for the \u02bfulama\u02be,\nhowever. Instead, they were also highly critical of advocates of Westernization such as\nthe Tanzimat reformers, who, as we have seen, called not just for the adoption of\nWestern technologies, but also for the wholesale restructuring of Islamic societies along\nEuropean lines. The Islamic Modernists agreed that Muslims could and should adopt\nEuropean technologies and build on Western science. Indeed, they were forthright in\narguing that Muslims could counter the Western threat only by adopting European\nweapons, commercial methods, and factories. However, the modernists vigorously\ndisagreed with the notion that the Islamic world also had to adopt European social\narrangements and values. On the contrary, they insisted that Muslims needed to fit\nWestern technologies and science strictly within the context of traditional Islamic values\nsuch as social justice. To do otherwise was to court disaster, as the calamitous efforts\nto remake Egypt along Western lines had made all too clear.106\nThe Islamic modernists applied similar reasoning to political issues. Most notably,\nlike the Young Ottomans, Abduh sought to develop a form of democracy that was\nrooted in Islamic values rather than in the Western ideas that had informed the\nTanzimat reformers\u2019 program. Toward that end, he recast ijma\u2014the idea of consensus\n104 Esposito, Islam, 154\u201356.\n105 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 307\u20138; Aslan, No God but God (Updated Edition),\n236\u201338.\n106 Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 267. Chapter Eight: Western Intrusions, Eastern Responses Page 251\nthat the \u02bfulama\u02be had for so long used to uphold their monopoly over religious\nquestions\u2014to mean popular sovereignty, and he joined the Young Ottomans in\nreconceiving shura to mean self-rule; in so doing, he gave Muslims the foundation on\nwhich they could construct an indigenous system of representative government\u2014one\nrooted in Islamic values rather than in the Western Enlightenment.107\nConclusion\nReform efforts of the nineteenth century such as Islamic Modernism cast long\nshadows in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Many later movements directly or\nindirectly found inspiration in their ideas, and some even drew specifically on their\nprograms. For instance, al-Afghani\u2019s ideas were instrumental in shaping the views of\nHasan al-Bana (1906-1949), the founder of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, while\nAbd al-Wahhab\u2019s puritanical understanding of Islam would provide the ideological\nunderpinnings of both the modern Saudi state and twenty-first century Jihadi groups\nsuch as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Meanwhile, the Tanzimat\nreformers\u2019 top-down approach to modernization would shape the efforts of Arab\nnationalist such as Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser (r. 1954-1970) to remake\ntheir countries after World War II.\nWhile they may have been influential on later social and political movements,\nhowever, the reform efforts of the nineteenth century ultimately failed to achieve the\ngoals that their proponents had sought. They had proven unable either to end the\nimbalance between the Muslim Middle East and the industrializing West or to arrest the\nIslamic world\u2019s continued relative decline. Indeed, despite the efforts of the reformers,\nEuropean exploitation of the Ottoman Empire accelerated in the early-twentieth century.\nUltimately, the inability of the nineteenth-century reform movements to halt the decline\nof the empire dimmed their appeal and opened the door to the emergence of new,\nsecular-nationalist movements such as Turkism and, later, Arab nationalism that would\ndisplace the earlier reform efforts as the dominant modes of resistance to continued\nWestern encroachment in the Middle East. It is to the appearance of these new\nideologies and to the global conflict that would nurture them that we shall next turn.\n107 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 516\u201317; Ansary, Destiny Disrupted, 263\u201365. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916\nThe four-decade period that followed Sultan Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s (r. 1876-1909)\nsuspension of the constitution was a time of dizzying change during which the Ottoman\nEmpire struggled to secure its territorial integrity in the face of threats from within and\nwithout. Paradoxes abounded. The government formally abandoned the Tanzimat\nprogram in favor of a return to traditional Ottoman practices while also quietly pressing\nforward with a remarkably similar modernization program. Likewise, the liberal\nrevolution that the sultan\u2019s subjects jubilantly cheered in 1908 seemed for a time to\nherald a new, democratic dawn but instead paved the way for a secretive cabal to\ntransform the empire into a one-party state that was even more autocratic than that of\nthe recently deposed sultan. Perhaps most obviously, while the Ottoman military\nendured demoralizing setbacks at the hands of Italy and the small, impoverished\nnations of the Balkans in the early 1910s, it followed by winning a number of significant\nvictories over the world\u2019s most powerful empire just a few years later.\nThere was nothing paradoxical about the effects of nationalism on the Ottoman\nEmpire, however. Despite the Tanzimat reformers\u2019 promotion of the supranational\nconcept of Ottomanism, nationalism increasingly eclipsed all other constructions of\nidentity in the region in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. For many, the\nreason was simple: in their eyes, nationalism was a liberating ideology\u2014one that\nprovided a pathway to a better future outside of an empire that they had come to view\nas alien. Problematically, however, nationalism had also acquired a dark side. Once\nseen as a partner to liberalism, it increasingly brought new ethnic rivalries, chauvinisms,\nand sinister hatreds to the region. The result would be violence, ethnic cleansing, and\ngenocide on a heretofore unimaginable scale.\nThe Hamidian Age, 1878-1908\nKnown as the Hamidian Age, the era of Abdu\u0308lhamit II was emblematic of the\ncontradictions of the late Ottoman Empire. Outwardly, his reign was a time of\nretrenchment\u2014a period in which the sultanate demonstratively repudiated modernity in\nfavor of a return to the traditional values and practices of the Ottoman past. It was a\nvery different story beneath the surface, however. There, in direct contrast to the official\nline emanating from the central government, Abdu\u0308lhamit II oversaw an efflorescence of\ninnovation and reform that differed little from the social, political, and economic\nrestructuring promoted by the reformers and Young Ottomans whom he had so\nunceremoniously shoved aside.\nFrom the time that he suspended the constitution in 1878, Abdu\u0308lhamit II had\nmade emphatically clear that he intended to abandon the Tanzimat. Publicly disdainful\nof both democracy and the idea of restructuring along Western lines, he joined\nconservatives in arguing that the empire could best respond to the challenge that\nEurope posed not by modernizing but instead by returning to the traditions and values\nof the Ottoman golden age. Accordingly, armed with sweeping emergency powers Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 253\nthat\u2014ironically\u2014the liberal constitution had accorded him, Abdu\u0308lhamit II effected a\ndramatic, reactionary shift in the distribution of power in the Sublime Porte that sidelined\nthe Tanzimat reformers and their Young Ottoman allies. Thereafter, it would be the\nsultan and his conservative courtiers rather than the liberal bureaucrats who would\ndirect the Ottoman state.1\nNow firmly in control, the new sultan acted aggressively to pursue his reactionary\nagenda. He began by devising a new conception of identity designed to retain the\nallegiance of the bulk of his remaining subjects. Acknowledging that Ottomanism had\nfailed to secure the loyalty of the sultanate\u2019s Christian subjects, he formally jettisoned\nthat ideology and, with it, the reformers\u2019 goal of retaining the allegiance of all people\nliving in the empire. In its place, he promoted Pan-Islamism: a narrower, though still\nsupranational, identity designed to provide the ideological glue needed to bind his Sunni\nsubjects to the state on the basis of a common religious identity\u2014an approach that\nappeared to have a great deal to recommend it now that Sunni Muslims constituted the\noverwhelming majority of the empire\u2019s population.2\nCentral to his effort to promote Pan-Islamism was the dynasty\u2019s longstanding\nclaim that the reigning sultan was also the caliph and thus the head of the global Sunni\ncommunity. Abdu\u0308lhamit II believed that this title gave him enormous authority that he\ncould use it to achieve two critical goals. First, he was confident that emphasizing his\nstanding as Muhammad\u2019s successor would ensure the continued loyalty of his Sunni\nsubjects and forestall the emergence of nationalist movements among them. Second,\nhe believed that publicly promoting his position as caliph would win the religious\nallegiance of the hundreds of millions of Muslims who lived in the French, British, and\nRussian Empires\u2014loyalty that he believed would bolster the sultanate by giving him\nvaluable leverage over those states in any future conflict.3\nHe followed by undertaking a series of high-profile actions designed to burnish\nhis standing among the world\u2019s Sunni Muslims. Most notably, aware that the caliph was\nthe traditional protector of the Holy Places, he ordered the construction of the Hijaz\nrailway to facilitate the movement of people to Mecca during the hajj and he lavished\nfifteen times as much revenue on the province as it generated in taxes to ensure the\npilgrims\u2019 ongoing health, safety, and comfort. These were significant expenses; given\nthe potential domestic and international benefits, however, they were, so far as the\nsultan was concerned, well worth the cost.4\n1 Donald Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700-1922, Second Edition\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 64\u201365.\n2 Sean McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame: War, Revolution, and the Making of the\nModern Middle East, 1908-1923 (New York: Penguin Books, 2015), 29\u201330; Caroline\nFinkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire (New York: Basic Books,\n2005), 488\u2013501.\n3 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 488\u2013501.\n4 Finkel, 488\u2013501. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 254\nAbdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s embrace of his role as caliph and criticism of the Tanzimat\nreformers earned him a reputation then and later as a reactionary who waged a fierce, if\ndoomed, rearguard action against modernity. A closer look reveals, however, that his\ncall for a return to traditional Ottoman and Islamic practices was a largely rhetorical one\nthat disguised both a genuine embrace of modernization and a deep commitment to the\nspirit if perhaps not the letter of the Tanzimat reformers\u2019 efforts to restructure the\nOttoman Empire. His actions made this clear. As sultan, he promoted the rationalization\nof provincial administration, doubled the number of upper-elementary schools,\nmodernized the army with German help, and aggressively pushed economic\ndevelopment schemes. Most notably, he oversaw the construction of the first significant\nrailways in the empire\u2014the very symbol of modernity in the nineteenth century\u2014and\nsigned an agreement in 1899 granting Germany a concession to build a line linking the\ncapital to Baghdad. Indeed, he was so committed to the development of the rail network\nthat he once urged an advisor to \u201c\u2018[j]ust get it built; run it over my back if you must.\u2019\u201d5\nEven Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s promotion of his status as caliph did not constitute a case of\nretrenchment. On the contrary, it was an example of innovation and a clear break with\nlongstanding dynastic practice. It is true that Ottoman sultans had long held the title of\ncaliph\u2014a claim that nominally dated to Selim I\u2019s (r. 1512-1520) conquest of Egypt in\n1517. From the beginning, however, the dynasty\u2019s use of the title had been more\nnotional than real. Successive sultans held it largely as an honorific much in the way\nthat they had also claimed to be the Kayser-i Rum or Emperor of the Romans. In other\nwords, as is so often the case with self-conscious efforts to revive long-dead practices,\nAbdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s assertion that he was the rightful leader of all the world\u2019s Sunnis was\nless a return to an older tradition than a novel invention\u2014one designed, in this case, to\ndramatically expand sultanic power.6\nPolitical thinking and social attitudes outside of the governing elite also followed\ncurrents that ran counter to Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s avowed embrace of tradition. Politically, the\nsultan\u2019s prorogation of the assembly and suspension of the constitution were unpopular\nand sparked anger rather than mute acceptance. In the wake of those actions, many\nwould come to join new, underground opposition organizations that called for liberalizing\nthe government and for effecting a top-down restructuring of Ottoman society along\nlines similar to Japan\u2019s Meiji Restoration. Meanwhile, in spite of the sultan\u2019s promotion\nof traditional values, social practices continued to evolve dramatically during the\nHamidian Age. Three changes stood out. First, as the large number of photographs\ntaken of women with uncovered faces suggests, a growing feminist movement was\nbeginning to challenge longstanding attitudes towards veiling at the very moment that\nthe sultan was publicly calling for a return to traditional Muslim practices. Second, the\ntechnical impossibility of separating people by gender on popular new technologies\nsuch as ferries and streetcars made a mockery of Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s efforts to enforce\nIslamic customs such as segregation along gender lines. Finally, changes to urban\n5 Carter V. Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 2010), 146\u201358.\n6 Findley, 146\u201358. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 255\nsocial mores during this period reflected the middle class\u2019s newfound openness to\nmodern, European cultural practices. Most notably, it was during the Hamidian Age that\nthe middle class abandoned the traditional custom of sitting on pillows in favor of the\nWestern practice of using chairs, tables, and sofas. Thus, despite Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s\nrhetorical opposition to reform and social innovation, many of the ideas implicit in the\nTanzimat reform effort continued to gain traction in the late-nineteenth and early-\ntwentieth centuries\u2014often at the direct, if quiet, urging of the sultan.7\nThe Second Constitutional Period, 1908-1913\nAbdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s long reign finally came to an end early in the twentieth century. To\nthe joy of the growing number of Ottoman subjects who supported democracy, a\nrevolution that took place in 1908 restored both representative government and the\nconstitution that the sultan had suspended in 1878. The result was a brief era of\ndemocratic rule known as the Second Constitutional Period\u2014a time that began with the\noptimistic belief that the empire was at last poised to become a modern state that\nenjoyed a thriving economy and, importantly, the respect of the European countries.\nThe euphoria that had greeted the revolution quickly faded, however. The new\ngovernment proved no more capable of guaranteeing the empire\u2019s borders in the face of\ncontinued European predation than had the Hamidian regime it supplanted and thus\nsoon began hemorrhaging popular support. Ultimately more interested in aggrandizing\npower than in institutionalizing the democratic constitutionalism that so many wanted, it\nresponded by solidifying its control over the levers of power. As a result, the Ottoman\nEmpire emerged from the Second Constitutional Period not with the representative\ngovernment that many had wished for, but instead with an undemocratic state\ndominated at every level by an autocratic and secretive ruling party.\nThe Young Turks\nOrganized opposition to Abdu\u0308lhamit II first emerged in 1889 when a group of\nmilitary medical students established a secret, revolutionary society called the\nCommittee of Union and Progress (CUP). Popularly referred to as the Young Turks, the\nCUP soon evolved into a broad umbrella organization that sought to coordinate a\nnumber of secular groups that opposed the sultan\u2019s rule. Those bodies varied widely in\nterms of membership and goals. They included organizations created by officials angry\nthat political power had shifted from the bureaucracy to the court, groups formed by\nnon-Turkish Muslims such as Albanians who feared that their territory might be taken by\nChristian European states, and secret societies established by Turkish-nationalist\nmilitary cadets who doubted the sultan\u2019s ability to maintain the territorial integrity of the\nempire in the face of the challenge that Russia and the newly independent Balkan\nstates posed. It even included representatives of Armenian nationalist groups.8\n7 Findley, 165\u201384.\n8 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 504\u20135; Findley, Turkey,\nIslam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 161\u201362. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 256\nThe CUP faced two significant hurdles that prevented it from constituting an\neffective opposition during its early years. First, harassed by Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s secret\npolice, the Young Turks could not operate within the empire and instead confronted the\ndifficult task of trying to shape public opinion from exile. Second, and more importantly,\nthe groups that made up the CUP were unified only by their fervent opposition to the\nsultan and their shared desire to restore the constitution that he had suspended in 1878.\nIn other regards\u2014particularly in terms of the objectives that they sought and the\nmethods by which they hoped to attain them\u2014they differed substantially.9\nWhile the constituent groups in the CUP were able to look past their differences\nduring the 1890s, they began to split over them shortly after the turn of the century. The\nfinal break occurred in 1902 over a proposal that called for the CUP to overthrow\nAbdu\u0308lhamit II with British help after which the organization would transform the empire\ninto a decentralized state that afforded ethnic and religious minorities substantial\nautonomy. While this plan found support among liberal former bureaucrats and many\nnon-Turkish elements, it was an absolute non-starter for the Turkish nationalist\norganizations in the CUP. Fearing that foreign intervention and decentralization were\nmerely waystations on the road to the empire\u2019s eventual partition and liquidation, those\ngroups split from the CUP in protest and formed a new umbrella organization called,\nconfusingly, the Committee of Progress and Union (CPU). Rejecting foreign\nintervention, it called for the restoration of the constitution and for the transformation of\nthe empire into a highly centralized state.10\nThe proponents of decentralization appeared to be the better positioned faction\nimmediately following the Congress of Ottoman Liberals, but it was the CPU that\nultimately emerged as the dominant opposition organization. Its success was a function\nof its clearer understanding of the structure of political power in the empire. Concluding\nthat no revolutionary movement could hope to overthrow the sultan without the support\nof the military, the group began to make contact with sympathetic officers in the\nOttoman army. Their efforts bore fruit in 1907 when the CPU absorbed the secret\nOttoman Freedom Society, a revolutionary organization made up of Turkish officers in\nthe Third Army stationed in Macedonia. Now enjoying military backing, the CPU was\nfinally in a position to move against the government. Accordingly, over the next year, it\nbegan laying plans for a revolution in which the Third Army would first seize control of\nMacedonia and then force Abdu\u0308lhamit II to restore the system of constitutional rule.11\n9 Erik J.

Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 257\nThe Revolution of 1908\nTwo events impelled the CPU to launch its revolution prematurely. First, it\nworried that a meeting between Russian Tsar Nicholas II (r. 1894-1917) and British King\nEdward VII (r. 1901-1910) presaged the impending partition of the empire. Second, the\nCPU received word that Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s secret police were readying an imminent\npreemptive action against it in Macedonia. Fearing disaster if they failed to act, the\norganization\u2019s leaders responded by ordering sympathetic elements of the Third Army\nto rise up against the Hamidian regime in July 1908. Quickly securing control of\nMacedonia, the revolutionaries proclaimed the reestablishment of the constitution on\nJuly 23 and began marching on Istanbul. The end came swiftly. Bowing to the\ninevitable, the sultan declared the next day that he was restoring the constitution and\nrecalling parliament. His announcement met with an enthusiastic reception among his\nsubjects. As elated as they were stunned, they poured into the streets where they\norganized a series of huge, spontaneous mass celebrations throughout the empire. A\nnew day appeared to have dawned.12\nThe popular response to the restoration of democratic rule created a critical\nmisperception about the events of July 1908. Bewitched by the euphoric crowds\ncheering for liberty, fraternity, justice, and equality, Western observers and Ottoman\nsubjects alike assumed that a mass democratic movement had sparked the revolution\nand concluded that the Ottoman Empire was en route to becoming a pluralist, liberal\nstate. Though widespread, this interpretation was far off the mark. As the fact that the\ncelebratory crowds emerged only after the sultan had announced the reinstatement of\nthe constitution makes clear, the revolution was not a popular movement effected by a\nbroad, democratic coalition. Instead, it was a narrow military insurrection organized by a\nsecretive, conspiratorial society. More significantly, the CPU\u2014which, confusingly, had\nreappropriated the CUP name\u2014did not revolt in order to reform the empire along liberal\nlines or to promote democracy as many people had assumed. Instead, it had seized\npower in pursuit of a fundamentally conservative objective: the maintenance of the\nOttoman Empire\u2019s territorial integrity in the face of both foreign aggression and the\nchallenge of internal nationalist movements. In other words, despite appearances, the\nrevolution was not a popular uprising, but instead a military putsch\u2014albeit one clothed\nin the verbiage of liberal constitutionalism.13\nThe Struggle for Power\nIn the meantime, unaware of the CUP\u2019s reactionary ideology, middle-class\nliberals and others threw their support behind the party. Indeed, the restoration of\nconstitutional rule created a honeymoon period during which the Young Turks enjoyed\noverwhelming popular backing\u2014sufficient to give them a majority of seats in\nparliamentary elections held in December 1908. By that point, however, the loss of\nadditional Ottoman territory had already begun to eat into the party\u2019s support.

Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 258\nthe opportunity that the revolution presented, a group of predatory states had moved\nagainst it in a series of coordinated actions in October 1908. Austria-Hungary had\nannexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, Greece had taken formal possession of Crete, and\nBulgaria had declared its full independence. It is true that these were paper losses: all of\nthose territories had been under foreign rule for some time and had been connected to\nthe empire by only the thinnest of legal fictions. Nonetheless, this new round of\ncontraction was demoralizing and seemed to demonstrate that the Young Turks were\nno more capable than Abdu\u0308lhamit II had been at preserving the Ottoman state\u2019s\nterritory. Reeling from the domestic fallout of these diplomatic defeats, the CUP\nthereafter struggled to maintain its dominant political position in the face of competing\nchallenges from a diverse array of groups including conservative religious scholars,\nliberal proponents of civil liberties, and ethnic minorities who, with growing volume,\ndemanded immediate autonomy or outright independence.14\nThe Young Turks responded by gradually abandoning their already lukewarm\ncommitment to constitutionalism and by moving to solidify their grip on the government.\nThey secured their right flank in April 1909 by successfully putting down a reactionary\n\u201ccounter coup\u201d organized by a combination of \u02bfulama\u02be, madrasa students, and non-\ncommissioned military officers and by using the failed revolt to compel Abdu\u0308lhamit II to\nabdicate in favor of his more pliant brother, Mehmet V (r. 1909-1918). With the sultan\nand the religious conservatives contained, they next moved to curb the threat that the\nliberals posed. Using the counter coup as a pretext, they enforced limits on public\nassembly, banned strikes, and curbed press freedoms in order to weaken advocates of\nreform; they also made abundant use of violence and electoral fraud to score a\nresounding victory over the Entente Lib\u00e9rale Party in the 1912 parliamentary elections.15\nIn so doing, however, the Young Turks badly overplayed their hand. While their\nefforts to limit popular protests, to ban strikes, and to censor the press had been\nsuccessful, their use of vote rigging and intimidation in what came to be known\nappropriately as the \u201c\u2018big stick election\u2019\u201d was so glaring that it produced a powerful\npolitical counterreaction. Dismayed by the CUP\u2019s disregard for democratic norms,\nconstitutionalists and disaffected army officers came together immediately after the vote\nto force the dissolution of parliament and to compel the formation of a new cabinet\ncomposed of liberals. As a result, the reign of the Young Turks appeared to be over.16\nThe Italo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars, 1911-1913\nThanks to a series of wars fought between 1911 and 1913, however, the CUP\nmanaged to achieve a remarkable reversal of fortune. The first of those conflicts, the\nItalo-Turkish War, began in 1911 when Italy invaded the last Ottoman possessions in\nAfrica, the provinces of Tripoli and Cyrenaica in modern-day Libya, in a bid to enlarge\nits empire.

Immediately on the heels of\nits defeat in Libya, the Sublime Porte faced a new and more-dangerous threat much\ncloser to home when Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece invaded the empire in\nan effort to strip it of its remaining European territories. The combination of so many\nenemies overwhelmed the Ottoman military. By the time a ceasefire brought the First\nBalkan War to a halt in December 1912, the empire had lost Macedonia and most of\nThrace and was in imminent danger of surrendering the besieged city of Edirne\u2014the\nempire\u2019s symbolically important former capital.18\nThese military defeats prodded the Young Turks into action. Fearing that Kamil\nPasha was going to yield Edirne in peace negotiations, a group of CUP officers led by\nEnver Pasha (1881-1922) and Talat Pasha (1874-1921) launched a bloody coup known\nas the Raid on the Sublime Porte in January 1913 that deposed the liberal cabinet and\nreplaced it with a CUP-controlled government committed to pushing on with the war.\nThe decision to continue the conflict was popular at first and resulted in a surge of\nsupport for the CUP. However, the Young Turks proved no more capable of defending\nthe empire than had the liberals they had overthrown. Indeed, rather than producing an\nOttoman victory, the decision to abandon diplomacy in favor of a continuation of the war\nresulted in the surrender of Edirne in March 1913 and left the empire vulnerable to\nfurther territorial losses.19\nReeling from the defeat, the CUP had no choice but to return to the bargaining\ntable. The resulting agreement reflected the Ottoman Empire\u2019s feeble position. Signed\nin May 1913, the Treaty of London cost the empire the city of Edirne, four-million\nsubjects, and 155,000 square kilometers of territory including nearly all of its remaining\npossessions in the Balkans. The agreement was a crushing political blow for the CUP.\nSaddled with responsibility for the treaty, it quickly lost all of the support that its decision\nto continue the war had gained it in the winter. Once again, as a result, it appeared\ndoomed to political irrelevance.20\nSurprisingly, however, the Young Turks managed to stage a remarkable\ncomeback in the summer of 1913. Their revival was a product of both the party\u2019s\ndomestic initiatives and the vicissitudes of international relations. Internally, the Young\nTurks broke the power of the liberal opposition by using the assassination of popular\nGrand Vizier Mehmet Sevket Pasha (1856-1913) as a pretext to arrest a number of\n17 Eugene Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, Reprint\nedition (Basic Books, 2015), 14\u201318.\n18 Richard J.

In the meantime,\nthey scored a rare international victory when they managed to retake some of the\nterritory that the empire had lost during the First Balkan War. They were able to do so\nnot because of Ottoman military prowess but instead because the victors of that conflict\nhad begun to fall out over the spoils almost before the ink had dried on the Treaty of\nLondon. The result was the outbreak in June 1913 of another conflict: the Second\nBalkan War. Pitting an overmatched Bulgaria against a coalition that included\nMontenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Greece, the new conflict created an opportunity that\nthe Young Turks were quick to seize. Exploiting Bulgaria\u2019s isolation, they ordered the\narmy to reoccupy much of the territory in Thrace that they had recently ceded in the\nTreaty of London. Facing no meaningful opposition, Ottoman troops easily retook\ncontrol of the region including, most importantly, the symbolically important city of\nEdirne. It was a substantial\u2014and welcome\u2014change of fortune. Long conditioned to\nexpect military and diplomatic defeat, the Ottoman public was ecstatic upon receiving\nnews of the victory. As a consequence, support for the CUP soared to heights not seen\nsince the heady days of the revolution.21\nWith its position temporarily solidified, the CUP followed by mounting a\nsuccessful effort to institutionalize a system of one-party rule. It did so by making\nadvancement in the bureaucracy contingent on loyalty to the party\u2019s shadowy central\ncommittee and, more importantly, by creating an extraconstitutional, CUP-controlled\napparatus that paralleled the government\u2019s official administrative structure. Giving the\nYoung Turks unprecedented control over the workings of the state, this mechanism\nproved invaluable to Enver, Talat, and another CUP leader, Djemal (1872-1922), who,\ntogether, had taken control of the cabinet in a shakeup in 1913. Known as the Three\nPashas, these members of the CUP inner circle thereafter used it to rule through a\nseries of nominally temporary decrees that permitted them to sideline parliament.22\nMeanwhile, the Young Turks also moved to strengthen the empire militarily and\ndiplomatically in an effort to prevent any further territorial loss. Here, they had at best\nmixed success. On the one hand, the order for two modern, dreadnought battleships\nfrom Britain in 1913, the Sultan Osman I and the Reshadieh, and the establishment of a\nGerman military mission under General Otto Liman von Sanders (1855-1929) in 1913\npromised to go a long way toward improving the empire\u2019s military capabilities. On the\nother, despite their vigorous efforts, the Three Pashas were unable to secure a\ndefensive pact with one of the Great Powers that could guarantee the empire\u2019s territorial\nintegrity\u2014hardly a favorable sign for a state facing the threat of further dismemberment.\nEven Germany, which had enjoyed close diplomatic relations with the Hamidian regime,\nwas unwilling to discuss a binding alliance with an empire that many believed was on its\nlast legs.23\n21 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 524.\n22 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 159\u201363, 174\u201375.\n23 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 84\u201386. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 261\nNationalism Comes to the Middle East\nSince the early nineteenth century, the ideology of nationalism that had produced\nthe Balkan Wars had constituted the driving force behind the Ottoman Empire\u2019s loss of\nEuropean territory. Whether used by local Balkan elites or manipulated by Great\nPowers such as tsarist Russia, it provided a powerful new conception of identity that\nhad fueled independence movements throughout the empire\u2019s Balkan territories.\nIndeed, the impact of nationalism on the region had been so enormous that, by 1914,\nthe sultanate\u2019s European possessions had been reduced to little more than Istanbul and\nits immediate hinterlands.\nIn contrast, nationalism had a much more difficult time establishing roots in the\nMiddle East. Indeed, it only began to percolate into the region during the Hamidian Age\nand the Second Constitutional Period, and, even then, commanded far less popular\nsupport there than it did in the Balkans. What explains this discrepancy? Why was it\nless popular in the empire\u2019s Middle Eastern provinces than it was in its European\nterritories? To a substantial degree, nationalism\u2019s more-limited penetration of the Middle\nEast stemmed from the enduring appeal in the region of supranational forms of identity\nsuch as Ottomanism and, especially, Pan-Islamism. With deep roots among the\nempire\u2019s Muslim subjects, Pan-Islamist notions of identity resonated far-more deeply\nwith the people of the region than did ethnically and linguistically based appeals to\nnational identity. As a result, on the eve of the First World War, nationalism in most of\nthe Middle East had no mass following and remained largely confined to small groups of\nintellectuals and cultural leaders\u2014particularly among minority groups that faced\ndiscrimination or the threat of organized violence.\nArmenian Nationalism\nThe Armenians were one such group. Experiencing stepped-up violence during\nthe late-nineteenth century, they were the first people in the Middle East to develop a\nfull-blown nationalist movement. It began among expatriate communities in Europe\nwhere the gravitational influence of Western ideas of nationalism was strongest. There,\nArmenian activists developed two rival organizations: the Dashnak Party in Russia and\nthe Hunchak Party in Switzerland. The two groups differed largely in terms goals. Aware\nthat the Armenians did not constitute a majority in any part of Anatolia, the more\nmoderate Dashnaks accepted continued Ottoman rule as inevitable and pressed for\ngreater autonomy within the empire. In contrast, the more-radical Hunchaks demanded\nnothing less than outright independence.24\nBoth the Dashnaks and Hunchaks used a combination of approaches to advance\ntheir goals. Many of their methods were peaceful. For example, both groups organized\ndemonstrations calling for autonomy and pressed for Armenians to have the right to\npossess arms so that they could defend themselves from the depredations of local\nMuslims\u2014particularly from the nomadic Kurds who had long extorted protection money\n24 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 142\u201344. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 262\nfrom them. At the same time, however, the two organizations were not afraid to use\nviolence to advance their objectives. Indeed, both launched terrorist attacks in hopes of\nsparking reprisals that would compel the international community to intervene on the\nArmenians\u2019 behalf. In this effort, they were partially successful. Dashnak and Hunchak\nterrorist operations sparked massive reprisals by mobs of Muslims in eastern Anatolia\nand Istanbul between 1894 and 1896 that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of\nArmenians. While they were able to arouse violence against the empire\u2019s Armenian\npopulation, however, these actions failed to secure the sustained Western intervention\nthat the nationalists sought. Worse, at times\u2014such as when the Dashnaks seized a\nWestern-owned bank in Istanbul in 1896\u2014the violence even alienated the European\nstates whose help the Armenian nationalists hoped to win.25\nShortly after the turn of the century, as a consequence, both the Hunchaks and\nDashnaks felt compelled to abandon violence. In its place, they began to cooperate with\nthe more liberal elements in the CUP in hopes of achieving greater rights for their\npeople if and when the Young Turks managed to depose Abdu\u0308lhamit II. Their shift to a\nmoderate strategy appeared to pay off with the revolution of 1908. Not only did the\nArmenians gain greater liberties and privileges as a result of the restoration of the\nconstitution, but they even managed to elect fourteen representatives to the new\nparliament. For a time, as a result, it seemed as though the Armenians would finally be\nable to secure real autonomy within the empire.26\nViolence soon destroyed that sense of hopefulness, however. Most notably,\nTurkish mob attacks in the city of Adana in the aftermath of the counter coup in 1909\nresulted in the massacre of as many as 30,000 Armenians. It was a sobering moment\nfor the Armenian nationalist groups. The sheer scale of the violence threw cold water on\nthe idea that the revolution marked the start of a new era in intercommunal relations.\nMore importantly, it dashed once and for all any hope that the Armenians would be able\nto achieve genuine autonomy within the structure of the Ottoman Empire.27\nFrom Ottomanism to Turkism\nIn contrast to Armenian nationalism, Turkish nationalism, or Turkism, emerged\nonly very gradually in the years leading up to the First World War. That it was slow to\ndevelop was largely a function of the fact that the governing elite had not endorsed it.\nInstead, seeking to preserve the empire, successive regimes had promoted broader\nforms of identity. As we have seen, for example, the Tanzimat reformers had\nchampioned Ottomanism as a way to bind all of the empire\u2019s ethnic and confessional\ngroups together through shared loyalty to the dynasty. Abdu\u0308lhamit II\u2019s Pan-Islamism\n25 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 9\u201314; Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the\nOttoman Empire, 502\u20133.\n26 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 13\u201314.\n27 Rouben P.

Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 263\nwas narrower in scope but similarly sought to provide a conception of identity sufficiently\nbroad that it could subsume particularlist forms of national identification.28\nOnce in power, the Young Turks picked up where their Tanzimat forebears had\nleft off and officially espoused the ideology of Ottomanism as a unifying principle.\nPrivately, it is true, growing numbers of Young Turks rejected Ottomanism in favor of\nTurkish nationalism, or Turkism. Influenced by the intellectual Yusuf Akcura\u2019s (1876-\n1935) contention that Ottomanism was a dead end in a world increasingly defined by\nnational identity, they believed that the Turks needed to abandon the effort to maintain a\nmulti-ethnic empire in favor of a focus on establishing a unified and homogeneous\nTurkish state. During the first few years of the Second Constitutional Period, however,\nthey felt compelled to keep such views to themselves. Instead, aware that Turks did not\nconstitute a majority in the empire, the adherents to Turkism within the CUP saw utility\nin downplaying their nationalist sympathies and thus continued to publicly endorse\nOttomanism.29\nThe disastrous Balkan Wars radically altered the logic that underlay this\napproach. Rampant desertion by ethnic Greek and Bulgarian troops in the Ottoman\narmy combined with the victors\u2019 brutal campaigns of ethnic cleansing in Macedonian\nand Thrace\u2014the winners expelled over 300,000 Muslims immediately following the\nconflict\u2014inflamed the empire\u2019s Turkish population and produced a surge of Turkish-\nnationalist sentiment. At the same time, the loss of nearly all of the empire\u2019s European\nterritory meant that Turks constituted a majority of Ottoman subjects for the first time\nsince the early-fifteenth century. As a result, while the CUP continued to officially\nespouse Ottomanism, it increasingly conflated that idea with Turkism. State policy\nreflected this change. Thereafter, the government promoted Turkish nationalist policies\nsuch as requiring that education and court proceedings be conducted in the Turkish\nlanguage and adhered to a new construction of Ottomanism wherein ethnic Turks would\nhold a dominant cultural and political position in the empire similar to that occupied by\nGermans in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Young Turks also began to cast Anatolia\nas not merely an important part of the empire, but as its Turkish heart\u2014a mental\nremapping that bode ill for the millions of Armenians who lived in that region.30\nZionism\nZionism, the movement dedicated to the establishment of a Jewish nation-state\nin the biblical land of Canaan, arose in Europe at the same time that Turkism took root\nin the Ottoman Empire. Named for a hill in Jerusalem that had come to symbolize the\npromised land, Zionism emerged in response to the shifting circumstances that the\n28 Hanio\u011flu, A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire, 147.\n29 Hanio\u011flu, 147.\n30 Mustafa Aksakal, \u201cThe Ottoman Empire,\u201d in Empires at War: 1911-1923, ed.

Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 264\nAshkenazi, or Central and Eastern European Jewish people, had experienced in the\n1800s. During the early part of the century, their position had improved dramatically.\nThanks to the egalitarian ideas of the French Revolution, the Ashkenazi had enjoyed\nrapid improvements in their social, economic, and political circumstances. Napoleon\nBonaparte (r. 1804-1814, 1815) was pivotal in effecting these changes. Dominating or\noutright ruling much of Europe during his reign, he had compelled most of the\nContinent\u2019s states to follow France\u2019s lead in emancipating the Jews. Thereafter, Jewish\npeople no longer had to wear clothing that identified their religion, could live outside the\nghettos to which urban Jews had long been confined, and were free to enter the\nprofessions. It was a heady time for the Ashkenazi people. Enjoying new freedoms and\nthe economic benefits that the Industrial Revolution had brought, many in the growing\nJewish middle-class concluded that the bad days of outright discrimination and\npogroms\u2014state sponsored riots\u2014were behind them.31\nA series of high-profile anti-Semitic incidents at the turn of the century soon\ndisabused them of that notion, however. The Dreyfus Affair\u2014the wrongful conviction of\na Jewish French army officer in 1894\u2014and the election of the openly anti-Semitic Karl\nLueger (1844-1910) as mayor of Vienna in 1897 made clear that a new and more\ninsidious form of anti-Semitism based not on religion but instead on race had emerged\nas nationalism\u2019s handmaiden. Everywhere in Europe, it seemed, nationalists were\nconstructing the Jewish people as the Other\u2014those who did not belong within the\nuniform \u201cimagined community\u201d of the nation-state.32\nAs bad as it was in Western and Central Europe, the situation was far bleaker in\nthe Russian Empire. Home to more than five million of Europe\u2019s nine-million Jews,\nRussia had not followed the other European states in emancipating the Jewish people.\nInstead, it continued to confine them to the Pale of Settlement: the region of far-western\nRussia where they resided in urban ghettos, or, more commonly, in poor agricultural\ncommunities called shtetls. Barred from most professions, facing strict quotas for\nadmission to universities, and lacking steady employment, they lived in abject poverty.\nAs bad as life had been for Russian Jews in the mid-nineteenth-century, however, it\ngrew dramatically worse following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II (r. 1855-1881)\nin 1881. Blaming the Jews for his death, Russian mobs took part in a series of huge\npogroms that resulted in the murder of thousands of Jewish people and in the large-\nscale destruction of Jewish-owned property.33\nIn response, a nascent Zionist movement arose in Russia. Inspired by the\nRussian physician Leo Pinsker\u2019s (1821-1891) Zionist pamphlet Auto Emancipation, a\ntrickle of Jewish people began to leave Russia for Palestine following Alexander II\u2019s\nassassination in a wave of migration called the First Aliyah, a term derived from the\nHebrew word for \u201cgoing up . . . to Jerusalem.\u201d This early Zionist effort was not very\n31 Evans, The Pursuit of Power, 475\u201376.\n32 Evans, 475\u201376.\n33 Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism: From the French Revolution to the\nEstablishment of the State of Israel (New York: Schocken, 2003), 56\u201360. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 265\nsuccessful, however. It involved only small numbers of people, and it lacked the\nfinancial reserves needed to adequately support those who emigrated. As a result, while\nseveral thousand Russian Jews managed to relocate to Palestine in the 1880s and\n1890s, a large proportion of them could not overcome the lack of resources or the harsh\nenvironment and soon left. Zionism appeared to be stillborn.34\nThe movement gained a new life thanks to the writings of Theodore Herzl (1860-\n1904). Widely considered the father of Zionism, Herzl was a middle-class Viennese\njournalist who initially championed integration and assimilation in Europe. Thanks to his\nexperience covering the Dreyfus Affair, however, his views underwent a rapid change in\nthe 1890s. Shocked by the anti-Semitism that the episode had revealed, he came to the\nconclusion that the Jewish people would never gain genuine acceptance in Europe and\nbegan to argue that they could only ensure their security by establishing their own\nnation-state. But where should they construct it? To Herzl, the answer was clear: they\nshould do so in the Jewish people\u2019s historical homeland of Palestine. Hoping to\npersuade European Jews to support Zionism, he put these ideas into words in 1896 in\nthe influential book, Der Judenstaat, or The Jewish State. Pleased with the interest it\ngenerated, he followed by helping to organize the First Zionist Congress in Basel,\nSwitzerland the next year. There, the assembled delegates established the Zionist\nOrganization, which, under Herzl\u2019s direction, lobbied European governments for support\nand purchased land in Palestine on which pioneers could settle using funds provided by\nwealthy Jews.35\nAt the same time that Herzl and the Zionist Organization were creating the\nnecessary infrastructure to sustain the movement, a sudden upsurge of anti-Semitism in\nRussia persuaded a large number of Jewish people to leave the tsarist empire for\nPalestine. Once more, political instability in Russia lay at the heart of the rise in anti-\nJewish sentiment. Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and the outbreak of a\nrevolution in 1905 had sparked a series of brutal pogroms throughout the empire. In\nresponse, thousands of the tsar\u2019s Jewish subjects decided to make a better life for\nthemselves by moving to the Holy Land in a wave of immigration known as the Second\nAliyah. They were far-more successful in establishing a permanent Zionist presence in\nPalestine than their predecessors who had come a generation earlier. Now able to draw\non the substantial financial resources of the Zionist Organization, the immigrants of the\nSecond Aliyah were able to establish the sinews of a Jewish nation there. They founded\nsettlements such as the city of Tel Aviv, started communal farms called kibbutzim, and\nrevived the Hebrew language. Above all, they turned the idea of a Jewish community in\n34 Michael Stanislawski, Zionism: A Very Short Introduction (New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2017), 17\u201320.\n35 Stanislawski, 22\u201331 Note, though, that scholars have recently cast doubt on Herzi\u2019s\nclaim that the Dreyfus Affair sparked his change of heart regarding assimilation. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 266\nPalestine from a dream into a reality; indeed, without the Second Aliyah, Zionism may\nwell have died out.36\nDespite this success, however, Zionism very much remained a niche movement.\nMost Central European Jewish people were indifferent to it and expressed no interest in\nleaving their comfortable lives for the impoverished and undeveloped Holy Land. Others\noutright opposed Zionism out of fear that it would undermine the rights and status that\nJewish people had gained in Europe over the course of the nineteenth century. More\nimportantly, Palestine simply compared unfavorably to the other, more-attractive options\nthat beckoned to those who sought to leave Europe. Indeed, of the staggering 2.5\nmillion Jewish people who emigrated from the Russian Empire between 1904 and 1913,\nonly 60,000 were willing to endure the difficult conditions in Palestine. The\noverwhelming majority instead opted to move to the Golden Medene\u2014the Golden Land\nof the United States.37\nThere was another problem as well. Palestine was not an unoccupied land\navailable for colonization, but instead a region that had a substantial population of\nChristian and Muslim Arabs. Herzl and his allies were well aware of this issue. Indeed,\nthere is a famous tale of two rabbis who, sent by the Zionist Organization to Palestine to\nassess its suitability as a homeland for the Jewish people, reported back after a few\nweeks that \u201c\u2018[t]he bride is beautiful, but she is married to another man.\u2019\u201d The story is of\ncourse fictive, but, like many apocryphal accounts, it also conveys an important truth.\nThat is, it accurately captures the fact that the early Zionists knew that the land on which\nthey sought to establish a Jewish state was already occupied. In the face of surging\nanti-Semitism in Europe, however, they chose to brush aside the idea that the hundreds\nof thousands of Arabs who lived in Palestine would pose a serious obstacle to their\ngoals. Instead, airily assuming that the issue would resolve itself in due course, they\npushed forward with their effort to establish a Jewish state in the territory.38\nArab Nationalism\nLike Zionism, Arab nationalism also emerged during the final decades of the\nOttoman Empire. It first originated in Egypt, where it gained a small following among the\neducated classes thanks to the tireless efforts of two newspaper editors, Ahmad Lufti al-\nSayyid (1872-1963) and Mustafa Kamil (1874-1908). Drawing inspiration from the\n\u02bfUrabi revolt, they promoted the idea that Egyptians were a distinct people who, as\nsuch, should rule themselves in their own independent nation-state. The two men made\nsome inroads with this idea at the turn of the century among educated Egyptians;\nthanks to the relatively light hand of the British colonial regime, however, their message\n36 Charles D.

Norton, 2014), 3\u20134. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 267\nfailed to gain a mass following. That situation changed with great suddenness in 1906\nas a result of the Dinshaway Incident: a confrontation between overbearing colonial\nofficials hunting pigeons and Egyptian peasants in the Nile River Delta that resulted in\nthe death of a British officer. The episode itself was comparatively unremarkable.\nHowever, Britain\u2019s decision to make an example of the incident by sentencing two of the\npeasants involved to hard labor for life and by condemning four others to death shocked\nthe Egyptian people. The result was a sudden, brief upsurge of nationalist sentiment.39\nSyria, too, had an embryonic nationalist movement prior to World War I.\nInfluenced by European ideas, educated Arabs in Damascus took umbrage in the years\nimmediately preceding the conflict with the Ottoman government\u2019s new requirement that\neducation and court proceedings in the Arab provinces had to take place in Turkish\u2014a\ndecree that was itself, as we have seen, a function of rising nationalist sentiment. In\nresponse, a small group of academics, bureaucrats, and military leaders in Damascus\nbegan to develop a distinctive Arab sense of identity and to emphasize the uniqueness\nand glory of the Arabs\u2019 history; in other words, they began to create a distinctive, Arab\nform of nationalism.40\nDespite these early stirrings, however, Arab nationalism failed to gain traction in\nthe years before the First World War. Two factors accounted for its relatively slow\ndevelopment. First, as previously noted, it faced stiff competition from the existing\nideology of Pan-Islamism. Well established, Pan-Islamism provided a popular and well-\nestablished form of identity that muted the appeal of nationalism among the Arab\npeople. Second, the Arab nationalists were themselves divided between those who\nfavored Pan-Arabism\u2014the idea that all Arabs shared an identity and should live\ntogether in a unified state\u2014and those who promoted narrower conceptions such as\nEgyptian or Syrian nationalism. Facing these headwinds, Arab nationalism simply could\nnot make meaningful progress prior to 1914. As a result, it would remain a fringe\nmovement until European dominance of the Middle East in the interwar period and the\ndefeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I established conditions more conducive to\nits growth.41\nWar Comes to the Middle East\nBreaking out in July 1914, the First World War seemed destined to effect huge\nchanges to the Middle East. Most obviously, as nearly all observers at the time\nassumed, the conflict appeared almost certain to end in the rapid defeat of Ottoman\narmies and in the subsequent dismemberment of the empire. They were half right. The\nOttoman Empire lost the war and soon thereafter faced partition at the hands of the\nvictors. However, it did not go down to defeat quickly or easily. On the contrary, in the\n39 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 144\u201346.\n40 Albert Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples (Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of\nHarvard University Press, 2002), 308\u20139.\n41 Hourani, 308\u201311. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 268\nshort term, the sultan\u2019s armies acquitted themselves very well. Indeed, they fought so\neffectively in 1915 and 1916 that they compelled the Allies to make a series of fateful\ndecisions that would powerfully shape the future of the Middle East.\nThe Outbreak of the First World War\nAs many had feared, the First World War originated in the Ottoman Empire\u2019s\nformer Balkan territories. On June 28, 1914, a member of a Serbian terrorist\norganization called the Black Hand the Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand\n(1863-1914) in Sarajevo, the capital of the former Ottoman province of Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, as part of a terror campaign aimed at to compelling Vienna to cede the\nterritory to Serbia. The killing produced the \u201cJuly Crisis,\u201d a gradually worsening\ndiplomatic impasse that gripped the capitals of Europe for the next five weeks. Despite\nhopes for a peaceful resolution, the situation slid irrevocably toward war when Austria-\nHungary, after first securing German support, issued a harsh ultimatum to Serbia in late\nJuly that, by design, proved unacceptable to the Serbian government. From that point,\nthe crisis quickly spun out of control. Beginning with Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s decision to order\na general mobilization of the Russian army on July 30, the three Triple Entente powers,\nFrance, Britain, and Russia, and the leading states of the Triple Alliance, Germany and\nAustria-Hungary, quickly entered the conflict. Italy, the third member of the Triple\nAlliance, did not honor its treaty commitment in 1914 and would, as we shall see,\ninstead join the war on the Allied side in 1915.42\nMany in Europe cheered on the impending conflict, believing that it would be\nbrief, glorious, and triumphal for their side. Indeed, vast crowds gathered in cities across\nthe continent to express their unbridled enthusiasm for the coming war. The conflict that\nensued did not live up to their euphoric predictions, however. Neither brief nor glorious,\nit was, at least until its third year, anything but triumphal for its participants.43\nThe war also defied Berlin\u2019s strategic assumptions. The commander of the\nGerman military, Helmuth von Moltke (1848-1916), had hoped to deal with the dilemma\nof fighting a two-front war by initially going on the defensive in the east so that he could\nconcentrate his forces for an offensive designed to quickly knock France out of the\nconflict. Germany would then shift its armies to the Russian front where they would\ndefeat the tsar\u2019s huge military and bring the conflict to a swift and victorious conclusion.\nDespite a vast amount of prewar preparation and planning, however, the offensive did\nnot go off as designed. Instead, while Germany scored a surprising victory over Russia\nin the fall of 1914, it proved unable to achieve the decisive triumph over France on\nwhich von Moltke\u2019s entire strategy hinged. Now facing the prospect of fighting a two-\nfront war against a coalition of enemies that enjoyed vast superiority in terms of\n42 Ian Kershaw, To Hell and Back: Europe 1914-1949 (New York: Penguin Books,\n2015), 9\u201336.\n43 Kershaw, 9\u201336. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 269\nresources and economic productivity, Berlin was forced to shift to the defensive on the\nWestern Front.\nThereafter, neither side could achieve a meaningful victory. Despite enjoying a\nhuge material advantage thanks to their vast empires and control of the seas, The\nFrench and British repeatedly failed in their efforts to crack their way through the\nelaborate trench fortifications that the Germans had constructed in northern France.\nDenied access to critical raw materials as a result of a highly effective Allied blockade,\nmeanwhile, Germany faced the daunting prospect of fighting a long war while enduring\nsevere material shortages and declining economic productivity. The result was a brutal,\nslowly escalating stalemate in which literally millions died in futile frontal attacks on\nheavily defended positions.\nGermany Gains an Ally, October 1914\nIn the meantime, the outbreak of the conflict put the Ottoman government in a\ndifficult spot. As we have seen, many of the European states had designs on the\nempire\u2019s territory but had heretofore been prevented from acting on those desires by the\nother Great Powers. Now, thanks to the exigencies of war, they no longer faced those\ndiplomatic constraints and were free to seize Ottoman territory. Thus, the outbreak of\nthe war left the sultanate facing almost-certain destruction.44\nIn response, the Three Pashas frantically stepped up their search for a binding\ndefensive alliance with one of the European states in hopes that such an agreement\nwould dissuade the other Great Powers from helping themselves to Ottoman land. They\ndiffered, however, over which state they should approach. Arguing that geography\nprevented Germany from providing meaningful aid to the empire, Djemal made\napproaches to Britain and France in July 1914. Unsurprisingly, his overtures went\nnowhere. Well aware that the tsar\u2019s government would insist on acquiring the straits as\nthe price of its participation in the war, Paris and London felt that they had no choice but\nto reject his proposal for an alliance. Making matters worse, the British government\nfollowed by requisitioning the nearly completed dreadnoughts Sultan Osman I and\nReshadieh on August 1 for service in the war against Germany. Meanwhile, just as\nBritain and France were rebuffing Djemal\u2019s entreaties, Talat and Enver approached\nBerlin about an alliance. Unlike Djemal\u2019s pitch to Paris and London, their proposal met\nwith success. Signed on August 2, the alliance\u2014which remained secret for the time\nbeing\u2014called for Germany to guarantee the Ottoman Empire\u2019s borders and to provide it\nwith military aid; in exchange, the Three Pashas promised that they would bring their\nstate into the war on the side of the German-led Central Powers.45\nWhy did Djemal, Enver, and Talat take the fateful step of entering into this\nagreement? After all, Djemal was correct in pointing out that Berlin could provide only\nlimited assistance to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, as events would prove, the alliance\n44 Rogan, The Arabs, 37\u201341.\n45 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 37\u201341. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 270\nwith Berlin failed spectacularly to provide the security that the triumvirate sought even\nas it obligated the Ottoman Empire to join a war that it could not win. As such, historians\nhave long concluded that the decision to ally with Germany and thus to join the war had\nbeen a shortsighted one rooted in desperation and wishful thinking\u2014a clumsy mistake\nthat doomed the empire to defeat and dismemberment.46\nThis interpretation has dominated historical understandings of Turkey\u2019s decision\nto enter the conflict since the war\u2019s conclusion, and has done so, in part, because it\ncontains more than a few grains of truth. After all, the decision to enter the war did put\nthe empire in a conflict that it could not win. Likewise, the alliance with Germany did\ngive sanction to the Allies\u2019 decision to apportion Ottoman territory among themselves at\nthe conclusion of the war.47\nIn recent years, however, a new generation of historians has challenged this\nview. They argue that it ahistorically locates Ottoman decision making in the context of\nthe war that occurred, rather than in the environment and expectations that existed in\n1914. As the historian Mustafa Aksakal notes, most educated observers did not expect\na long, bloody conflict that would conclude with one side achieving a total victory but\ninstead believed that any general European war would be brief and would end in a\nnegotiated settlement. Seen in this light, the treaty makes a great deal more sense. In\nthe short run, it offered the security that the triumvirate believed the empire required to\nsurvive the war intact; in the long term, meanwhile, it promised to provide the\npermanent defensive alliance needed to guarantee the empire\u2019s borders.48\nWhat did Germany stand to gain from the alliance? Kaiser Wilhelm II (r. 1888-\n1918) and his cabinet perceived three benefits in the agreement. First, they believed\nthat by closing the straits that were so vital to Russian trade\u201437 percent of its exports\npassed through them\u2014the alliance with the Ottoman Empire would greatly weaken the\neconomy on which the tsar\u2019s massive military depended. Second, they were confident\nthat Ottoman armies could divert troops away from other fronts by invading Russian\nterritory in the Caucasus and by attacking the Suez Canal. Finally, and most\nimportantly, Berlin was convinced that the Ottoman Empire possessed a unique and\npotentially devastating ideological weapon: the authority that the sultan held in his\ncapacity as caliph to issue a fatwa calling for all Sunnis to wage jihad against the\nEntente powers. German officials placed great stock in such a declaration\u2014believing\nthat it would spark a series of massive revolts in British, Russian, and French colonial\nterritories.49\n46 Mustafa Aksakal, The Ottoman Road to War in 1914: The Ottoman Empire and the\nFirst World War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010), 12\u201313, 190\u201391.\n47 Aksakal, 12\u201313, 190\u201391.\n48 Aksakal, 12\u201313, 190\u201391.\n49 Hew Strachan, The Outbreak of the First World War (New York: Oxford University\nPress, 2004), 62; Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 46\u201347. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 271\nHaving finally secured the alliance that they had been desperately seeking since\nthe end of the Balkan Wars, the Ottomans promptly repaid the favor by deliberately\nextorting and stonewalling their new ally. They did so in two ways. First, they exploited\nthe perilous situation of two German warships then facing imminent destruction at the\nhands of Britain\u2019s Mediterranean fleet, the powerful dreadnought S.M.S. Goeben and\nthe light cruiser S.M.S Breslau, in order to squeeze new concessions from Berlin. To\nrescue the vessels, they proposed a fictive sale of the ships to the Ottoman\ngovernment\u2014a paper exchange that would save the Goeben and Breslau from\ndestruction and partially offset the loss of the dreadnoughts that London had\nrequisitioned. It was a far-more one-sided proposal than it appeared at first blush,\nhowever. In exchange, Germany would have to agree to a series of concessions\nincluding promises to help the Sublime Porte regain several strategic islands in the\nAegean Sea from Greece and recover territory in the Caucasus it had ceded to Russia\nin the nineteenth century. Most importantly, the proposal required Germany to abolish\nthe capitulatory privileges its subjects enjoyed in the Ottoman Empire. The kaiser\u2019s\nministers spluttered with rage at what they saw as blackmail on the part of their putative\nally. Aware that their ships faced sure destruction, however, they gritted their teeth and\nagreed to the Sublime Porte\u2019s terms.50\nSecond, citing the need for further military and financial assistance, the Three\nPashas repeatedly rebuffed German demands that they honor the terms of the alliance\nand declare war on the Allies. Indeed, it was only after the Sublime Porte had squeezed\nout one last concession from Berlin that the two governments finally came to terms\nregarding Ottoman entry into the conflict. According to the arrangement they worked\nout, the Sublime Porte agreed to permit the now-nominally Ottoman Goeben and\nBreslau to attack Russian ports. In exchange, Berlin promised to provide the Ottoman\ngovernment with a loan of five-million Turkish pounds in gold.51\nTo this point, the Three Pashas had played a weak hand very well. They had\nexploited the July Crisis and Germany\u2019s growing desperation for help against the Allies\nwith great skill and effectiveness. They had gained valuable concessions, acquired\nurgently needed financial aid, and secured vital war materiel. They had even won\nGermany\u2019s agreement to abolish the hated capitulatory agreements. The decision to\nauthorize the bombardment of Russian territory marked the point of no return, however.\nOnce the Goeben and Breslau began shelling the Russian naval base at Sevastopol on\nOctober 29, the Ottoman Empire could no longer turn back from the brink and was\nthereafter irrevocably bound to its ally\u2019s fate. It was, in sum, a momentous decision\u2014\none that was pregnant with significance for the empire and its people. With it, the\nconflict that would so profoundly shape the Middle East\u2019s future had finally come to the\nregion.52\n50 Aksakal, The Ottoman Road to War in 1914, 110\u201318, 137\u201352, 156\u201363.\n51 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 126\u201328.\n52 McMeekin, 124\u201333. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 272\nThe Early War\nOttoman Offensives\nHaving finally brought the empire into the war, the Three Pashas wasted little\ntime in joining the fight. They began by readying large offensives against Russian\npositions in the Caucasus and against the Suez Canal. More importantly, they moved to\nplay the religious card on which Berlin had placed such high hopes. Almost immediately\nafter entering the conflict, the Three Pashas had twenty-nine legal scholars draft five\nfatwas justifying holy war; they followed by arranging for Sultan Mehmet V\u2014acting in his\ncapacity as caliph\u2014to formally call a jihad against the Allies on their basis. The\nGermans were elated. After a rocky start, the alliance with Istanbul finally appeared to\nbe bearing fruit.53\nThe results turned out to be bitterly disappointing. To German dismay, neither of\nthe military offensives proved successful in the least. The first, the advance on the Suez\nCanal, was merely ineffectual. Under Djemal\u2019s direction, the attackers did manage to\nget as far as the waterway\u2019s east bank in December 1914; facing entrenched Indian\ntroops that the British had deployed on the opposite side, however, they were forced to\nretreat back to Palestine with substantial losses.54 In contrast, the second offensive,\nEnver Pasha\u2019s effort to unhinge the Russian position in the Caucasus in late 1914, was\nan outright debacle. Seeking a quick victory, he sent inadequately provisioned\nsoldiers\u2014many even lacked shoes\u2014on a winter offensive in the mountains against\nentrenched Russia formations. Despite the poorly contrived and supported attack, the\nOttoman troops initially made good progress. The arrival of Russian reinforcements\nand, worse, the onset of blizzard conditions that brought temperatures as low as -36\u00b0C\ndramatically altered the situation, however. Exposed, suffering enormous casualties,\nand out of supplies, Enver\u2019s army soon broke and retreated in disarray. By the time it\nreturned to its starting position, it had lost 60,000 of its 95,000 soldiers.55\nStill, the Germans were buoyed by their expectation that a declaration of jihad\nwould turn the war in favor of the Central Powers. Like many Europeans, they put great\nstock in the power of Muslim holy war. They believed that the caliph\u2019s formal call to jihad\nwould produce massive uprisings of zealous Muslims rendered fearless by their belief\nthat Heaven awaited those who died fighting to defend Islam. Facing the rebellion of\n53 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 47\u201352.\n54 More than one-million Indian soldiers fought for the British Empire during the First\nWorld War.\n55 Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East (London: C. Hurst\nand Co., 2014), 103; Michael A.

Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 273\nmillions of fanatical Sunnis, the Allies would be unable to prosecute the war against the\nCentral Powers and would thus be compelled to sue for peace.56\nIn the end, however, the call to holy war failed to live up to the German\ngovernment\u2019s inflated expectations. Despite a vigorous and well-funded propaganda\neffort, the caliph\u2019s declaration of jihad produced no meaningful uprisings in the Allied\nempires and had little impact on the war. Why had it proven unable to meet Berlin\u2019s\nexpectations? In part it failed because it faced an uphill fight. That is, despite German\nexpectations, the sultan enjoyed little influence in regions such as French West Africa or\nBritish India. At least as important, the declaration failed because the Entente had\nresponded to it with a highly effective public relations campaign. Central to that effort\nwas King George V\u2019s (r. 1910-1936) assurance to the British Empire\u2019s 100 million\nMuslim subjects that his government would refrain from attacking or damaging Mecca,\nMedina, or the important religious centers in Iraq. Reassured in this way, prominent\nMuslim leaders including the Aga Khan, the nawab of Dhaka, and the bey of French-\nruled Tunis instructed their subjects to continue to abide by the authority of the colonial\npowers.57\nBritain\u2019s Response\nStill, the Ottoman Empire\u2019s entry into the war seriously complicated Britain\u2019s\nposition in the Middle East. Two vulnerabilities stood out. First, Ottoman forces located\nin modern-day Iraq menaced the British-owned oil wells and refinery facilities in western\nIran that lay just across the Shatt al-Arab Waterway. This threat was a serious one.\nIranian petroleum was not merely an economically valuable commodity but one of great\nstrategic significance thanks to a key policy change made just before the war. In 1912,\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill (1874-1965) had ordered the conversion of\nthe British fleet from coal powerplants to more powerful and flexible oil-fired ones. This\nmove gave the Royal Navy vastly greater mobility but came at the cost of making the\nfleet\u2014the first line of imperial defense\u2014dependent on imported petroleum from Britain\u2019s\noilfields in Iran. Second, Ottoman control of Palestine posed a constant danger to the\nSuez Canal\u2014the vital artery through which massive quantities of resources, goods and\npersonnel vital to the war effort flowed. This threat was nothing short of existential. As\nBritish officials keenly grasped, without the canal, Britain would no longer be able to\nprosecute the war with Germany.58\nLondon moved aggressively to safeguard these vital assets. First, on the basis of\ncontingency plans drafted shortly after hostilities had broken out, Indian troops acted to\nsecure the vital Iranian oilfields by landing in Ottoman territory at the head of the\n56 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 47\u201352.\n57 Rogan, 70\u201372.\n58 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 135\u201345. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 274\nPersian Gulf. Quickly taking control of Basra, they ensured that the oil that had become\nso essential to British security continued to flow unimpeded.59\nSecond, London moved to secure the Suez Canal by assuming complete control\nof the province of Egypt. Doing so was more complicated than it appeared at first blush.\nWhile a de facto British colony, Egypt was still technically part of the Ottoman Empire;\nLondon would thus have to tread carefully lest its actions breathe life into any latent\nloyalty to the sultan. To address this challenge, it pursued a carrot-and-stick approach.\nOn the one hand, it imposed censorship, maintained a substantial number of troops in\nthe Canal Zone, implemented martial law, and, most importantly, decreed that Egypt\nwas henceforth a British protectorate rather than a part of the Ottoman Empire. On the\nother, it softened these harsh policies by promising that the Egyptians would not have to\ncontribute in any way to the war effort and by hinting that formal inclusion in the British\nEmpire could lead to eventual self-government.60\nThis approach was a savvy one and it might have kept Egypt quiescent if the\nBritish government had been able to prevent the war from adversely affecting the\nEgyptian people. London proved unable to do so, however. Instead, in two critical ways,\nthe conflict imposed substantial costs on the protectorate. First, the insatiable, war-\ninduced demand for textiles led Egyptian farmers to switch from growing cereal crops to\nraising cotton\u2014a change that produced surging food prices, sustained inflation, and\nwidespread hunger. Second, military exigencies led London to renege on its promise\nthat Egypt would not have to contribute to the war effort. Indeed, it took less than a year\nfor colonial officials to begin confiscating transport animals and conscripting men for\nservice in labor battalions. As a result, the Egyptian people grew increasingly frustrated\nand restive under British rule and came more and more to expect that they would, as\ncompensation, enjoy some significant measure of self-government immediately\nfollowing the conclusion of the conflict.61\nThe Gallipoli Campaign, March 1915 to January 1916\nMeanwhile, British officials appraising the broader significance of Ottoman entry\ninto the war were gradually coming to conclude that the empire\u2019s participation on the\nGerman side presented them with both a crisis and an opportunity. As they were well\naware, its belligerency prevented Britain and France from sending Russia the munitions\nand resources needed to prosecute fully the conflict on the Eastern Front and thus\nimperiled the broader Allied war effort. At the same time, however, Istanbul\u2019s vulnerable\ncoastal location and the abysmal performance of the Ottoman army in the early fighting\nsuggested to some British officials that the Allies could knock the sultanate out of the\nconflict by seizing its capital in a surprise naval attack. If successful, such a move would\n59 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 79\u201386.\n60 Rogan, 68\u201370.\n61 M W Daly, \u201cThe British Occupation, 1882-1922,\u201d in The Cambridge History of Egypt.\nVolume 2, Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the End of the Twentieth Century, ed. M. W.\nDaly (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 245\u201348. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 275\npay manifold dividends. It would enhance British prestige among its Muslim subjects,\npotentially sway neutral Balkan states such as Greece and Bulgaria to join the Allied\ncause, and, most importantly, permit France and Britain to supply Russia with war\nmateriel. Given the mounting frustration and staggering casualty count on the Western\nFront, it was an appealing idea. Accordingly, Secretary of State for War Horatio\nKitchener (1850-1916) ordered Churchill and his staff to draw up plans for a sudden\nattack on Istanbul through the narrow Dardanelles Strait.62\nThe proposal that Churchill presented to the cabinet was a bold one. Arguing that\nthe Ottoman gun emplacements along the Dardanelles were obsolete and poorly\nsupplied, he proposed having a squadron of Anglo-French battleships force its way\nthrough the narrow strait in a sudden attack. Once past the Turkish defenses, the ships\ncould then sail unmolested across the Sea of Marmara to Istanbul where they could\ntrain their guns on the city and compel the Ottoman government to surrender.63\nUnfortunately for the Allies, the attack turned out to be an unmitigated disaster.\nChurchill\u2019s plan had much to recommend it and might well have succeeded had they\nproceeded with it in December 1914. By the time the Allies launched the attack in March\n1915, however, the Ottomans and their German partners had dramatically reinforced\nthe defenses at the mouth of the Dardanelles; as a result, the attempt to force the strait\nfailed with the loss of three battleships. Realizing that they could not push their way\nthrough without first silencing the Ottomans\u2019 shore defenses, the Allies followed by\nlanding British, French, Australian, and New Zealand troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula\nthat commanded the western side of the strait. This effort, too, ended in disaster. Under\nthe direction of Liman von Sanders, the well-led, deeply entrenched, and highly\nmotivated Ottoman Fifth Army defending the peninsula prevented the invading troops\nfrom seizing the high ground and instead pinned them on their vulnerable beachheads.\nEight grueling months of brutal trench warfare followed before the Allies finally admitted\ndefeat and withdrew. The campaign thus ended in triumph for the Ottoman army.\nThough it had suffered 300,000 casualties to the Allies\u2019 230,000, it had protected the\ncapital and had achieved a decisive victory over the powerful British Empire.64\nFor the Allies, on the other hand, the Gallipoli campaign had been an unmitigated\ndisaster\u2014one that had set the war effort back on multiple levels. First, the successful\nOttoman defense of the peninsula persuaded Bulgaria to throw in with Germany in\nSeptember 1915; in other words, rather than leading key Balkan states to join the fight\nagainst the Central Powers, the campaign had instead worsened the Allied position in\nSoutheastern Europe. Second, the British defeat was a huge morale boost for the\nOttoman Empire that breathed new life into its heretofore faltering war effort. Finally,\nand of greatest concern to London, the abject failure of the Gallipoli campaign greatly\neroded British military prestige in the Middle East and South Asia and raised renewed\nfears that, emboldened by the apparent weakness of imperial military forces, the\n62 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 130\u201332.\n63 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 169\u201379.\n64 Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East, 79\u201392. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 276\nempire\u2019s Muslim subjects might rise in revolt in response to the caliph\u2019s summons to\njihad.65\nKut al-Amara, December 1915-April 1916\nBut what could they do to forestall such an uprising? To British officials, the\nanswer seemed obvious: the best way to put to bed any lingering questions about the\nefficacy of the British army was to achieve a swift, symbolic triumph over the recently\nvictorious Ottoman military. To their delight, there appeared to be a golden opportunity\nfor them to do so in Mesopotamia. Defended by a small army suffering from poor\nmorale and leadership, the region contained a city, Baghdad, of enormous historical and\nsymbolic importance to Muslims. The opportunity was simply too good to pass up.\nConfident that they could achieve a quick victory at little cost, British officials accordingly\nprepared to mount an offensive in the fall of 1915 aimed at taking possession of\nBaghdad.66\nBegun with high hopes, the campaign ended in disaster. In September 1915,\nMajor General Charles Townshend (1861-1924) departed from Basra with a division of\nIndian troops. The operation started auspiciously. After brushing aside early resistance,\nhis soldiers headed north confident that they would take Baghdad by Christmas. In short\norder, however, the campaign began to go off the rails. Under a new commander, the\nreinforced Ottoman Sixth Army stopped Townshend\u2019s force near the old Persian capital\nof Ctesiphon in November and then forced it to retreat. Overwhelmed by the speed of\nthe enemy pursuit, Townshend\u2019s beleaguered troops were compelled to take refuge in\nthe town of Kut al-Amara on the Tigris River where they waited for a relief army from\nBasra to rescue them. It never came. Instead, while their supplies rapidly dwindled,\nsuccessive efforts to break through to Townshend\u2019s troops faltered in the face of\ndetermined Ottoman resistance. Finally, with no prospect of relief in sight and with his\nstores exhausted, Townshend surrendered his force of thirteen-thousand men in April\n1916.67\nThe loss of Townshend\u2019s army created a panic among British officials. Coming\nso soon after the disaster at Gallipoli, this second defeat at the hands of the Ottoman\nmilitary further emboldened the Central Powers, and, more importantly, seemed to raise\nquestions about the fundamental pillar on which British colonial authority had long\nrested: the belief that its military was invincible against non-Europeans. Coupled with\nthe sultan\u2019s call to jihad, such doubts appeared to have the potential to produce\nmassive uprisings among his majesty\u2019s Muslim subjects\u2014rebellions that could threaten\nnot merely the war effort but even the empire itself. To British officials, in other words,\nthe defeat at Kut seemed to have an obvious lesson; they had to do something to\n65 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 207\u201315.\n66 Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East, 127\u201333.\n67 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 263\u201370, 291\u201393. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 277\nensure the loyalty of the empire\u2019s millions of Muslim subjects, and they had to do it\nfast.68\nThe Historical Debate: The Armenian Genocide\nIn the meantime, the Allied attacks in the Dardanelles and eastern Anatolia\nhelped to set the stage for the worst incident of ethnic cleansing to occur during the war:\nthe Armenian Genocide. The mass murder of Armenians that occurred under the Young\nTurk government was at root the product of the increasingly reactionary and militant\nTurkish nationalist thinking that had become more-and-more prevalent in the empire\nduring the prior two decades. Its immediate trigger, however, was a series of scattered\nArmenian uprisings in eastern Anatolian that raised fears among Muslim Ottoman\nsubjects that the Armenians constituted what one leading CUP member called an\n\u201c\u2018enemy within\u2019\u201d\u2014a disloyal fifth column that was ready to help the Allies defeat and\ndismember the empire.69\nThe large-scale murder of Armenians began in earnest in the spring of 1915. In\nApril, the government ordered the arrest and deportation of 240 prominent Armenians in\nIstanbul in order to prevent the community they led from cooperating with the Allied\nforces that were about to land at Gallipoli. The campaign picked up steam dramatically\nthe following month when Interior Minister Talat issued the infamous Deportation Law,\nwhich authorized provincial governors to remove Armenians from the critical border\nprovinces of eastern Anatolia and to resettle them in Syria. The Kurds who composed\nthe irregular formations that oversaw that effort did so in brutal fashion. In each city or\ntown targeted for deportation, the militias murdered all male Armenians aged twelve and\nup before force marching the poorly provisioned women and children into the desert.\nWhile en route, they killed any stragglers and permitted armed bands to periodically\nattack the columns. Unsurprisingly, precious few Armenians made it to Syria alive.70\nFor over a century, a highly politicized debate has raged over the massacre of\nthe Armenians. It has centered on two related points: the intentions of the Ottoman\ngovernment and whether the attacks constituted a deliberate act of genocide. Drawing\non evidence provided by contemporary observers such as American Ambassador Henry\nMorgenthau (1891-1967), Armenian nationalists today maintain that the CUP murdered\nbetween 1 million and 1.5 million Armenians and argue that the violence was a centrally\ndirected, deliberate act of genocide designed to purge Asia Minor of Armenian\nChristians. In contrast, the Turkish government claims that the Young Turks did not plan\na campaign of systematic murder and that they merely ordered the deportations in\nresponse to Armenian collaboration with Russian forces and attacks on Turks. A\nsubstantial number of Armenians were killed in intercommunal violence, it concedes,\nbut those people died as a result of a civil war between Muslim and Armenian militias in\neastern Anatolia and not due to deliberate state policy. As evidence, the Turkish\n68 Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East, 132\u201337.\n69 Rogan, The Arabs, 163\u201365.\n70 Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire, 533\u201335. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 278\ngovernment cites the fact that Talat\u2019s deportation orders explicitly instructed government\nforces to treat the Armenians well. Thus, in the official Turkish view, the mass murder of\nArmenians during World War I was neither a case of genocide nor the product of\ndeliberate, state policy but instead a function of deep-seated intercommunal\nanimosity.71\nWhile some scholars accept the broad outlines of the Turkish government\u2019s\ninterpretation, others instead agree with the historian Taner Ak\u00e7am that it badly and\ndeliberately mischaracterizes what was, in fact, a clear case of genocide. Drawing on\nheretofore-unexamined documents from the Turkish archives, Ak\u00e7am rejects the view\nthat the massacres were an unfortunate but also unintended consequence of the war\nand the contention that the people who perpetrated them did so without official sanction.\nInstead, he argues that the mass slaughter of Armenians stemmed from a policy that\nthe CUP developed immediately after the Balkan Wars that was aimed, in his words, at\n\u201cdemographically restructuring Anatolia\u201d to ensure that no minority group was\nsufficiently concentrated in a given area that it could, with Great Power help, secure its\nindependence.72\nIt was the First World War, Ak\u00e7am continues, that provided the ruling party with\nthe opportunity to put this program into action. Taking advantage of the cover that the\nconflict afforded them, the Young Turks moved to homogenize Asia Minor through the\nrelocation of Armenians and other ethno-religious minorities such as Assyrian Christians\nso that those groups constituted no more than 10 percent of the population of any\nprovince. Since the large size of the empire\u2019s Armenian community rendered impossible\nthe achievement of that goal through relocation alone, the CUP instructed local officials\nto murder hundreds of thousands of Armenians during the deportations. The Young\nTurks did not order those deaths openly, however. Instead, taking advantage of the\nextraconstitutional, party-controlled apparatus that the CUP had set up to control the\nbureaucracy following the Balkan Wars, leaders such as Talat employed a \u201cdual-track\nmechanism\u201d wherein they sent one set of orders through official channels instructing\nlocal authorities to take great pains to treat the Armenians well during the deportations\nand another through the unofficial, CUP-controlled administrative structure ordering its\nagents to engage in mass murder. Thus, Ak\u00e7am concludes, the massacre of the\nArmenians was neither accidental nor a function of wartime exigencies; instead, it was a\ncarefully camouflaged but ultimately deliberate act of genocide on the part of the CUP\ngovernment designed to ensure permanent Turkish dominance of all of Anatolia.73\n71 Taner Ak\u00e7am, The Young Turks\u2019 Crime against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide\nand Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire (Princeton: Princeton University Press,\n2012), ix\u2013xxxvi, quote from page xvii.\n72 Ak\u00e7am, ix\u2013xxxvi, quote from page xvii.\n73 Ak\u00e7am, ix\u2013xxxvi, quote from page xviii. Chapter Nine: The Twilight of the Ottoman Empire, 1878-1916 Page 279\nConclusion\nMeanwhile, even as the genocide of the Armenian people worsened, the\nsituation on the Ottoman front remained shockingly dire for the Allies in early 1916. Not\nonly had the British suffered costly reversals at Gallipoli and Kut at the hands of\nOttoman forces that they had believed to be incapable of standing up to Western troops,\nbut, thanks in part to those defeats, Bulgaria had joined the Central Powers while\ncountries favorably disposed to the Allies such as Greece continued to remain on the\nfence. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire\u2019s stunning victories over British forces\nthreatened to breathe new life into the caliph\u2019s call for jihad and thus raised the specter\nof armed revolts breaking out among the hundreds of millions of Muslim subjects in the\nFrench, Russian, and, especially, British Empires.\nIn response to this danger, London would pursue a series of actions that would\nprove enormously consequential for the future of the Middle East. Most notably, the\nreversals at Gallipoli and Kut and the dangers inherent in the sultan\u2019s call for jihad\nimpelled British officials to seek new allies by dangling before them the possibility of\nacquiring parts of the Ottoman Empire if they joined the fight. Critically, the desire to\noffset its military setbacks in the Middle East also led London to promise territory to non-\nstate actors that had the potential to undermine the Central Powers or to mute the\ncaliph\u2019s call to holy war. Britain\u2019s diplomatic outreach would ultimately bear fruit and\nwould play a small role in the Allied sides\u2019 eventual victory. In the process, however, it\nwould also fuel competing and ultimately irreconcilable expectations and would embed\nconflict in the Middle Eastern state system that would emerge from the war. It is the\nnegotiation of the agreements that created those expectations and to the complex,\npostwar process of resistance and accommodation that would ultimately produce the\nmodern Middle East to which we shall now turn. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1922\nDespite its early success in the war, the Ottoman Empire could not hold out\nagainst superior Allied forces indefinitely and was compelled to sue for peace in\nOctober 1918. Its defeat created a vast power vacuum in the Middle East\u2014one that the\nmain European victors in the war, France and Britain, intended to fill. They were not the\nonly parties staking claims to parts of the region, however. With London and Paris\u2019s\nencouragement, Italy and Greece also began to look to the Middle East to satisfy their\nterritorial ambitions. At the same time, non-state actors including Arab princes, Zionists,\nand sundry nationalist movements advanced competing and seemingly irreconcilable\nclaims that were backed in some cases by a series of contradictory wartime\nagreements.\nAs a consequence, the Middle East underwent a complex and drawn-out process\nof negotiation, resistance, and accommodation in the immediate postwar era.\nEventually, the various parties arrived at an arrangement\u2014what the historian David\nFromkin calls \u201cthe settlement of 1922\u201d\u2014that, reflecting the relative power of the\nparticipants, determined the political systems, rulers, and frontiers of the post-Ottoman\nMiddle East. While many of the people who helped to produce the new map of the\nregion were pleased with the results, other, more perceptive observers grasped that the\nsettlement was fundamentally flawed and would likely doom the Middle East to future\ninstability. Perhaps the most far sighted among them was future British Field Marshal\nArchibald Wavell (1883-1950). Parodying President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s (r. 1913-1921)\nfamous declaration that World War I was a \u201cwar to end all war,\u201d he declared\nprophetically in 1922 that the diplomats, bureaucrats, and regional experts who had\ncontrived the modern Middle East between 1918 and 1922 had created a \u201c\u2018peace to end\nall peace\u2019\u201d\u2014one, he predicted, that would ensure instability in the region for decades to\ncome.1\nDiplomatic Maneuvering\nPeace was little more than a dream in 1916. Instead, the conflict that had\nproduced so much death and misery in 1914 had, remarkably, grown even worse over\nthe next two years. The deadliest fighting took place on the Western Front. Though they\ndeployed new weapons including tanks and poison gas, the French and British armies\nfighting there proved abjectly incapable of breaking through the increasingly complex\nand formidable German trenchworks that stretched from the English Channel to the\nSwiss border and struggled to make even minor gains in a war that quickly degenerated\ninto a mass slaughter on an industrial scale. No campaign demonstrated this reality\nmore clearly than the Franco-British push along the Somme River in the summer and\nfall of 1916. Despite months of furious attacks and the loss of a staggering 600,000\n1 David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the\nCreation of the Modern Middle East (New York: Avon Books, 1989), 5, 18. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 281\nAllied soldiers, the offensive only managed to advance the front line a mere seven\nmiles.2\nCasualties on this scale were unsustainable and impelled Britain, France, and\nRussia to seek new allies that could share the burden. Commencing not long after the\nwar began, their efforts began to bear fruit in 1915. That spring, they persuaded\nGermany\u2019s former Triple Alliance partner, Italy, to join the conflict on the Allied side.\nLater, in June 1917, they induced Greece to enter the war. The participation of these\ncountries in the fighting certainly boosted the Allied war effort, but it came at a cost: in\nexchange for joining, the new belligerents demanded that the Allies grant them\nsignificant territorial concessions at the expense of the defeated states. For example,\nItaly declared war only after the Allies had first promised that it would receive the South\nTyrol and territory along the Adriatic from the Habsburg Empire. Similarly, Greece\nentered the conflict with the understanding that Britain, France, and Russia would help it\nachieve the megali idea, or great idea: the Greek nationalist dream of reconstituting the\nByzantine Empire.3\nAs the death toll mounted, however, the territorial promises secured early in the\nwar seemed increasingly inadequate. Accordingly, the belligerents\u2014new and old\nalike\u2014began to demand greater and greater compensation to justify the slaughter. But\nwhere could London, Paris, and St. Petersburg\u2014renamed Petrograd in 1914\u2014find\nsufficient territory to satisfy both their own aspirations and the expectation of their new\nallies? After all, Britain and France had already staked claims to Germany\u2019s overseas\ncolonies and were disinclined to give up their gains. The answer, increasingly, was the\nOttoman Empire. In a process they referred to as the \u201c\u2018Great Loot,\u2019\u201d Entente diplomats\nbegan to promise their new European Allies territory in Asia Minor. Italy would receive\nAntalya along Anatolia\u2019s southern coast, while Greece would acquire territory in\nsouthwest Asia Minor.4\nThe McMahon-Husayn Correspondence, July 1915-June 1916\nBritish officials did not focus exclusively on gaining additional military help,\nhowever. Instead, they also sought ideological assistance in the war. Most notably, they\nbecame increasingly interested in 1915 and 1916 in securing assistance in neutralizing\nthe Ottoman declaration of jihad that they feared was gaining renewed traction among\nthe British Empire\u2019s Muslim subjects thanks to the Ottoman Empire\u2019s victories at\nGallipoli and Kut. Fortune appeared to smile on the British in this effort. In the summer\nof 1915, the Ottoman governor of the Hijaz, the Emir Husayn (r. 1916-1924),\napproached the ranking British official in Egypt, High Commissioner Henry McMahon\n(1862-1949), in an effort to secure formal recognition of Arab independence under his\n2 John Keegan, The First World War (New York: Vintage, 1998), 298\u201399.\n3 Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919: Six Months That Changed the World (New York:\nRandom House, 2007), 283, 348.\n4 Scott Anderson, Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the\nModern Middle East (Anchor, 2013), 152\u201353. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 282\nfamily\u2019s rule. There followed a lengthy exchange of letters between McMahon and\nHusayn that came, subsequently, to be known as the McMahon-Husayn\nCorrespondence.5\nAt first, McMahon and the British did not believe that they had much to gain from\nthe negotiations. The head of the Hashimite clan and thus sharifian, or descended from\nMuhammad, Husayn had initially asked London to help him and his sons establish a\nseries of independent, Hashimite-ruled Arab kingdoms encompassing Syria,\nMesopotamia, and Arabia; in exchange, he pledged to lead a revolt against the Ottoman\nEmpire and promised that huge numbers of Arab soldiers would desert Djemal Pasha\u2019s\n(1872-1922) army and join their rebellion. McMahon found the emir\u2019s expansive\ndemands for territory to be wildly out of scale with his likely ability to affect the war;\nmore importantly, he was aware that London had its own designs on the Arab lands that\nthe emir sought. Accordingly, he carefully refrained from discussing specific territorial\nclaims with Husayn.6\nThe abject failure of a major push to break the deadlock at Gallipoli in the late\nsummer of 1915 put the emir\u2019s request in a different light, however. Thereafter, British\nofficials became more enthusiastic about the assistance that Husayn could provide. In\npart, they warmed to a deal because they had come to believe that Hashimite irregulars\nmight make a modest contribution to an upcoming offensive into Palestine by drawing\noff Ottoman soldiers and by disrupting lines of communication. Ultimately, however, it\nwas the Hashimite\u2019s soft power rather than their military potential that rekindled British\ninterest in concluding a deal. Believing that Husayn\u2019s title and ancestry gave him\nenormous legitimacy in the Muslim world, London had come to conclude that his\npresence on the Allied side could help to maintain the continued loyalty of the millions of\nMuslim subjects of the French, British, and Russian empires.7\nMcMahon consequently shifted his tone and began to indicate in his letters that\nLondon was willing to accommodate Husayn\u2019s territorial aspirations. He insisted on two\nexceptions, however. First, aware that London had designs on the vilayets, or\nprovinces, of Basra and Baghdad, he made clear that they had to remain separate from\nthe Arab territories that Husayn sought. Second, he demanded that \u201cportions of Syria\nlying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo,\u201d remain apart\nfrom the proposed Hashimite states, ostensibly because \u201cthey cannot be said to be\npurely Arab\u201d but really because France had made clear that it wanted to add them to its\nempire\u2014a point we shall return to in a moment. Husayn was disappointed with these\nqualifications. Nonetheless, with the British dangling promises of weapons, recognition,\n5 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 173\u201384.\n6 Eugene Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, Reprint\nedition (Basic Books, 2015), 281\u201383.\n7 Rogan, 281\u201383. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 283\nand gold in front of him, he decided to accept McMahon\u2019s conditions and pledged to\nbegin his rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in mid 1916.8\nThough each side had its reservations, both Husayn and the British were pleased\nwith the outcome of the negotiations. That they were mutually satisfied owed\nsubstantially to the fact that neither party fully understood that the other had been\nbargaining in bad faith. Husayn, for his part, had in effect signed checks that could not\nbe cashed. That is, despite his assertions to the contrary, he exercised no meaningful\ninfluence over Arabs living outside the Hijaz; accordingly, his claim that a revolt under\nhis banner would lead huge numbers of Arabs to switch sides was an empty one. If\nHusayn had overpromised, McMahon had been downright duplicitous. A subtle\nnegotiator, he had made liberal use of evasive language and careful qualifiers to ensure\nthat while Britain appeared to have agreed to help the emir secure Arab independence\nunder his family\u2019s rule, it in fact had made no concrete commitments whatsoever. Thus,\nwhile Husayn came away from the exchange believing that London had pledged to help\nhim and his sons establish themselves as the sovereign monarchs of independent\nstates, it had in fact agreed only to make them the titular rulers of indirect British\ncolonies. Indeed, as Foreign Secretary Edward Grey (1862-1933) noted privately at the\ntime, London was promising little more than \u201c\u2018a castle in the air which would never\nmaterialize.\u2019\u201d9\nSykes-Picot Agreement, May 1916\nAs earlier alluded to, McMahon had good reason to dissemble in his discussions\nwith Husayn. At the same time that he was negotiating with the emir, another British\nofficial Mark Sykes (1879-1919) was engaged in secret talks with the French diplomat\nFran\u00e7ois Georges-Picot (1870-1951) over the partition of the Arab Middle East; as a\nresult, the high commissioner needed to avoid making promises to Husayn that might\nconflict with France\u2019s territorial designs. Sykes, a rank amateur, and Picot, a hardened\nFrench nationalist, met several times between October 1915 and March 1916 to\ndetermine how the Allies would divide the region. Picot drove a hard bargain. He\ninsisted that France gain direct control of territory in southeast Asia Minor and along the\ncoast of the Levant, and he demanded that it indirectly rule the Syrian interior as far as\nthe city of Mosul. These were expansive demands, particularly given the widespread\nbelief that the vilayet of Mosul contained substantial oil deposits. Nevertheless, London\nperceived advantage in yielding to Picot\u2019s request. With one eye fixed firmly on the\nfuture, it concluded that French possession of Syria would give Britain both a buffer and\na natural ally should Russia resume the Great Game following the war.10\n8 \u201cLetters between Hussein Ibn Ali and Sir Henry McMahon,\u201d accessed May 26, 2020,\nhttps://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Letters_between_Hussein_Ibn_Ali_and_Sir_Henry_Mc\nmahon; Anderson, Lawrence in Arabia, 160\u201363.\n9 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 184\u201387.\n10 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 285\u201387. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 284\nIn any event, control of Syria was not one of London\u2019s goals in the Middle East.\nInstead, its focus in the region was on taking possession of Mesopotamia\u2014a region that\nit correctly believed contained substantial oil deposits\u2014and on controlling a belt of\nterritory connecting Egypt in the west to modern-day Iraq in the east that could\nsafeguard the empire\u2019s vital communications with India. Sykes consequently proposed\nsplitting the Middle East along a line stretching from Acre in Palestine to Kirkuk in\nMesopotamia, with France gaining control of territory north of the line and Britain\nsecuring the region south of it. Picot agreed to the broad outlines of Sykes\u2019s division of\nthe region; however, he refused to sign off on the proposal to assign Palestine to\nBritain. Insisting that the territory had to retain its historical connection to Syria, the\nFrench diplomat demanded that France take control of it following the war.11\nBy March 1916, the two men had finally hammered out a final agreement.\nAccording to its terms, Britain would directly rule Basra and Baghdad and would exert\nindirect control of other Arab territories south of the line Sykes had drawn, while France\nwould directly administer southeastern Anatolia and Lebanon and would indirectly\noversee the Syrian interior as far as Mosul. They compromised over Palestine. In\nrecognition of the importance of its religious sites, they agreed that it would come under\ninternational control following the war. Pleased with the deal, they presented it to\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Sasanov (1860-1927). After reviewing the agreement,\nhe gave it his formal blessing. However, he conditioned Petrograd\u2019s acceptance on\nParis and London\u2019s willingness to grant Russia new territorial concessions in Asia Minor\nbeyond Istanbul and the straits, which the Allies had already agreed would come under\nthe tsar\u2019s control at the conclusion of the conflict. Picot and Sykes accepted this\nqualification. Accordingly, with an exchange of letters in May 1916, the three powers\nformally signed off on what has been known ever since as the Sykes-Picot\nAgreement.12\nThe Historical Debate: The Sykes-Picot Agreement\nDuring the past few decades, the agreement has come to assume an outsized\nrole in popular understandings of the genesis of the many conflicts that have bedeviled\nthe Middle East over the past century. According to the conventional narrative, Sykes\nand Picot divided the region for nakedly imperialist reasons rather than to meet the\naspirations of the people living there. As a result, the agreement they negotiated\nimposed artificial and problematic borders that embedded within the Middle East state\nsystem a series of intractable conflicts. To the educated public, in other words, it was\nthis externally imposed agreement\u2014the modern Middle East\u2019s diplomatic original sin\u2014\n11 James Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East,\n1914-1948 (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2011), 15\u201326; Fromkin, A Peace to\nEnd All Peace, 188\u201393.\n12 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 285\u201387. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 285\nrather than problems endemic to the region that produced the many conflicts that the\nMiddle East has experienced over the past century.13\nWhile popular, this view is not universally shared by scholars. On the contrary, a\nnumber of historians argue that it distorts and oversimplifies what was a much more\ncomplex process. The historian Sean McMeekim, for one, argues that while the\nconventional view is accurate in its characterization of British and French motives, it\nalso substantially overstates in two critical ways the agreement\u2019s role in defining the\nregion\u2019s future development. First, the frontiers and divisions that Sykes and Picot\nhammered out in 1915 and 1916 bore only a superficial resemblance to the Middle East\nthat finally emerged from the shadow of war in the early 1920s; therefore, it cannot be\nheld responsible for the problems that those frontiers may have created. More\nimportantly, he continues, the idea that the agreement was the source of the region\u2019s\nmodern-day tribulations denies agency to the many states, peoples, and groups that\ncontested the shape and structure of the Middle East in the years immediately following\nWorld War I. Indeed, it is McMeekin\u2019s view that the creation of the modern Middle East\noccurred not in 1916 with the Sykes-Picot Agreement but instead in the immediate\npostwar years in a complex process\u2014still dominated by Britain\u2014that demarcated the\nborders and established the states that continue to define the region to the present\nday.14\nThe Balfour Declaration, November 1917\nFurther complicating understandings of the Sykes-Picot Agreement was the fact\nthat the British were not yet done apportioning the Ottoman Empire\u2019s territory in the\nArab Middle East. Most notably, at the urging of the influential chemist and Zionist,\nChaim Weizmann (1874-1952), British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour (1848-1930)\nprepared a third document dealing with the region\u2019s postwar territorial arrangements,\nthe famous Balfour Declaration, well after Sykes and Picot had concluded their\nagreement. Issued on November 2, 1917, the statement proclaimed that \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s\nGovernment view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the\nJewish people and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of that\nobject.\u201d At just 128-words, it was a remarkably brief statement. What it lacked in length\nit more than made up for in impact, however, for, in issuing it, Britain had committed\nitself to backing the Zionist effort to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in\nPalestine.15\nWhy did the British government move to make the already difficult question of the\npostwar Middle East\u2019s disposition even more complicated? It did so in part because\nseveral key members of the cabinet were personally supportive of Zionism. Balfour and\n13 Sean McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame: War, Revolution, and the Making of the\nModern Middle East, 1908-1923 (New York: Penguin Books, 2015), xix\u2013xx.\n14 McMeekin, xx\u2013xxii.\n15 \u201cThe Balfour Declaration, November 2, 1917,\u201d accessed May 29, 2020,\nhttps://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/balfour.asp. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 286\nPrime Minister David Lloyd George (r. 1916-1922), in particular, were genuinely\nsympathetic to the situation of the Jewish people and personally supportive of the\nZionist cause. As a rule, however, the British government did not make foreign policy on\nthe basis of sympathy. Such was most certainly the case with regard to Palestine.\nBritain\u2019s support for Jewish goals in the territory stemmed not from Palestine\u2019s\nimportance to the Zionist cause but instead from its broader geostrategic significance.\nThat is, by 1916, British officials had come to conclude that Palestine\u2019s position along\nthe eastern approaches to the Suez Canal rendered it so strategically vital that they\nneeded to assume control of it.16\nHere, however, they confronted a serious problem. Much though they wanted\nsimply to annex Palestine at the end of the war, they understood that France and,\nespecially, the United States, would, for very different reasons, block any attempt on\ntheir part to do so. French disapproval was straightforward and reflected traditional\npower politics: having just signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement, Paris was highly unlikely\nto agree to alter the deal to suit Britain\u2019s imperial ambitions without receiving\nunacceptably costly concessions in return. American opposition, in contrast, was more\nideological in nature. Its moralistic president, Woodrow Wilson, had made clear in his\n\u201cPeace Without Victory Speech\u201d in January 1917 that he opposed formal colonialism\nand that he would work to stop any postwar transfer of territory that did not enjoy the\nconsent of those affected. Thus, to the consternation of British officials, their effort to\nsecure control of Palestine appeared to be stillborn.17\nDespair turned to hope not long after Wilson\u2019s speech, however. The key was\nZionism. British officials began to perceive Zionism at that time as a possible way to get\naround its allies\u2019 opposition to its designs on the Holy Land. That is, they came to\nbelieve that support for the movement could, if properly presented, neutralize both\nAmerican and French objections and thus permit London to add Palestine to the\nempire.18\nThey first used Zionism to disarm French opposition. The key was the situation in\nRussia. In March 1917, frustration with the war effort and the management of the\neconomy had resulted in a revolution that overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. Initially,\nrevolutionary Russia remained committed to the war; as the economic and military\nsituation continued to worsen over the course of 1917, however, its enthusiasm began\nto waver. This state of affairs deeply troubled London, and, especially, Paris. If Russia\nconcluded a separate peace, Germany could redeploy its eastern armies to the Western\nFront and thus shift the balance of forces in France\u2014enough, possibly, to tip the\nbalance in the war. British statesmen were quick to take advantage of its ally\u2019s concern.\nBeginning in the spring of 1917, they began to argue to their French counterparts that\n16 Benny Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920\n(New York: Vintage Books, 2001), 71\u201373.\n17 Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948,\n28\u201329.\n18 Barr, 28\u201329. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 287\nEntente support for a Zionist homeland in a British-controlled Palestine would lead\nRussia\u2019s substantial Jewish population to press the revolutionary government to remain\nin the conflict and would thus ensure against the possibility that Germany could\nconcentrate its forces in the west. Rattled by the prospect of a renewed offensive by a\nreinforced enemy, Paris found this argument persuasive and softened its previously firm\nopposition to British control of Palestine.19\nSupport for Zionism also neutralized Woodrow Wilson\u2019s objections to London\u2019s\nacquisition of the territory. British policymakers had deduced that they could avoid\nAmerican opposition to their territorial aspirations only if they could credibly present\nthose acquisitions as selfless acts aimed at preparing disenfranchised peoples for\nautonomy or independence. Zionism permitted them to do just that in Palestine. By\nbacking the movement, Britain could cloak what was an act of plain-and-simple\nimperialism as a selfless effort to help the long-suffering Jewish people at last acquire a\nhome. It was an effective ploy. The American president not only refrained from opposing\nthe British action but even formally endorsed the Balfour Declaration.20\nThus, while the Balfour Declaration appeared on the surface to focus on\nachieving the Zionists\u2019 goals, its real purpose was to provide the ideological cover\nBritain needed to advance its imperial interests. This is not to suggest that the Balfour\nDeclaration was anything less than a major victory for the Zionists; in fact, as we shall\nsee in chapter thirteen, the statement gave their movement a degree of international\nlegitimacy that it heretofore lacked and thus marked a critical turning point in its\nevolution. Rather, it is only to stress that Britain\u2019s motives were rooted fundamentally in\npromoting its self-interest rather than in supporting an idealistic cause. The verbiage of\nthe Balfour Declaration made this reality clear. London was not calling for a sovereign\nJewish state in Palestine but was instead proposing the establishment of a mere\n\u201cnational home\u201d for the Jewish people. This choice of language was very deliberate:\nBalfour and the cabinet drafted the declaration to ensure that the Zionist project would\nbe incorporated within a British colony rather than emerge as an independent state.\nLondon\u2019s support for Zionism was thus, at root, a cynical strategy for colonial\naggrandizement. As such, it succeeded smartly.21\nUnsurprisingly, London\u2019s myriad efforts to secure new allies in the Middle East\nwould land Britain in an awkward position immediately following the war. Simply put, it\nhad entered into three wartime agreements regarding the Ottoman Empire\u2019s Arab lands\nthat promised the same territory to different parties. Paris and London expected to rule\ncertain areas directly\u2014the northern coast of the Levant in France\u2019s case; Basra,\nBaghdad, and Palestine in Britain\u2019s\u2014and to divide the interior into a series of Arab client\nstates. For their part, the Zionists saw the Balfour Declaration as merely a first step that\nwould lead quickly and inevitably to the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. Finally,\n19 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 286\u201389.\n20 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 422\u201323.\n21 Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948,\n28; Quote from \u201cThe Balfour Declaration, November 2, 1917.\u201d Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 288\nwhile Husayn had grudgingly agreed to accept French control of Lebanon and coastal\nSyria, he had also justifiably come away from his negotiations with McMahon believing\nthat Britain had pledged to recognize independent Hashimite rule in territory that\nincluded Palestine and inland Syria. In other words, the promises that London had\nmade were irreconcilable: in zero-sum fashion, each party could obtain its territorial\naspirations only at the expense of the others. The result would be bitterness, feelings of\nbetrayal, and outright conflict between the various parties following the war\u2014particularly\nin Palestine, or, as some were coming to call it, the \u201cthrice-promised land\u201d\u2014that\ncontinue to reverberate to the present day.22\nThe Allies Victorious\nThe problems that the wartime agreements created were ones of the future,\nhowever; in the meantime, the Allies first had to win the war. Doing so seemed as far\naway as ever at the start of 1917. The Western Front remained a brutal stalemate in\nwhich the British and French sacrificed ever-larger numbers of young men in a futile\neffort to break Germany\u2019s seemingly impenetrable trench lines. The situation was little\nbetter in the Middle East. Checked at Kut and Gallipoli by the sultanate\u2019s surprisingly\ntenacious armies, the British had been unable to take any Ottoman territory beyond the\nsmall amount that they had secured in 1914. It is true that the tsar\u2019s armies had made\nsubstantial inroads in eastern Anatolia over the course of 1915 and 1916. Thanks to\nRussia\u2019s gradual, post-revolutionary disengagement from the war, however, the\nOttoman military had even succeeded in stabilizing that front.23\nTo London\u2019s relief, the military situation in the Middle East began to change in\n1917. First, in Mesopotamia, a reinforced army of Indian troops erased the lingering\nstain of Kut by taking Baghdad in March 1917. More dramatically, General Edmund\nAllenby\u2019s (1861-1936) Egyptian Expeditionary Force mounted a successful offensive\naimed at taking possession of Palestine late in the year. It was, by the standards of the\nFirst World War, a lightning campaign. Breaking through the Ottoman lines along the\nfrontier with Egypt in November 1917, Allenby\u2019s troops advanced rapidly northward into\nthe Holy Land. The drive was a major success\u2014one made all the sweeter by the\ncapture of the symbolically important city of Jerusalem on December 9.24\nThe Arab Revolt that the Emir Husayn had launched in June 1916 played a small\nsupporting role in this campaign. Under the command of Husayn\u2019s sons, Faysal (1883-\n1933) and Abdallah (1882-1951), Arab irregulars attacked Ottoman troops defending\nthe Hijaz Railway east of the Jordan River in a series of operations designed to disrupt\nOttoman supply lines. While the revolt\u2019s actual contribution to the war was\ncomparatively minor, it came to assume an outsized role in popular understanding of\nAllenby\u2019s Palestine campaign thanks to the work of Faysal\u2019s British liaison officer, T. E.\n22 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 75.\n23 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 355\u201357.\n24 Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East (London: C. Hurst\nand Co., 2014), 111\u201312; McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 400\u2013402. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 289\nLawrence (1888-1935), better known as Lawrence of Arabia. An effective self-promoter\nand a man of great imagination, Lawrence created the impression that the Arab Revolt\nhad been pivotal in winning the campaign in Palestine in his exaggerated account of his\nservice in the Middle East, the book Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1926), on which the\naward-winning film Lawrence of Arabia (1962) was based.25\nThe conclusion of the war in the Middle East came with startling suddenness in\nOctober 1918. The endgame began in September when Entente armies launched\nsimultaneous attacks against Ottoman forces on multiple fronts. Their first big\nbreakthrough came in Palestine. After a long pause to bring forward supplies, the\nEgyptian Expeditionary Force punched though the Ottoman defenses north of\nJerusalem on September 19 and raced toward Damascus. To the jubilation of people on\nthe home front, Australian troops occupied the city just twelve days later. That account\nwas not the story that London chose to present to the world, however. Instead, it\nconcocted an elaborate ruse in which it pretended that Faysal\u2019s troops rather than the\nAustralians had been responsible for the city\u2019s capture.26\nWhat accounted for this move? Why did London seek to elevate the Hashimite\ncontribution to the war effort in Syria? It did so in service of the new, more expansive\nobjectives that the British government had come to seek in the Middle East. Prime\nMinister David Lloyd George was the primary proponent of the change in London\u2019s\ngoals in the region. By early 1918, he had come to conclude that the British Empire\u2019s\nfuture security required it to assume a position of hegemonic dominance in the Middle\nEast following the war\u2014a situation that would only work if it prevented France, a\npotential future enemy, from having a substantial presence in the region. Accordingly,\nhe directed his subordinates to claim that Faysal\u2019s forces had been instrumental in\ntaking Damascus\u2014an achievement that, fake or not, would entitle the Hashimites to\nkeep Syria after the war and thus ensure that the territory came under the control of a\npliable British proxy rather than the rival French Empire.27\nMeanwhile, Allied armies in the Balkans were scoring an even more decisive\nvictory. In late September 1918, a multi-national army under French command\nshattered the Central Powers\u2019 defenses in southern Bulgaria and began racing toward\nthe undefended city of Istanbul. With no reserves remaining, the Ottoman government\nwas out of options and had little choice but to sue for peace. It was not the Three\nPashas who surrendered the empire, however. Aware that they would be compelled to\nanswer for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Armenians, Enver (1881-1922),\nTalat (1874-1921), and Djemal hurriedly resigned and slipped out of Istanbul on a\nGerman torpedo boat. Thus, it was a new government that on October 30, 1918, signed\n25 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 342\u201346.\n26 Rogan, The Fall of the Ottomans, 374\u201379.\n27 Ulrichsen, The First World War in the Middle East, 94\u201395, 171. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 290\nthe draconian Armistice of Mudros that formally ended the First World War in the Middle\nEast.28\nDividing the Spoils\nSorting out the Middle East following the fighting was not going to be easy. Even\nwith Russia\u2019s claims voided as a result of its exit from the war, the various agreements\nthat London and Paris had made to secure new allies and to achieve their own territorial\naspirations in the region promised to render efforts to establish a durable settlement in\nthe Middle East difficult. Adding to the challenge was the fact that the victors had begun\nto fall out over the spoils. As we just saw, the imperial rivalry between France and\nBritain had rekindled during the waning days of the conflict as London moved to keep\nthe French out of Syria in service of Lloyd George\u2019s goal of assuming hegemony over\nthe Middle East. Likewise, jockeying for control of southwestern Anatolia, Italy and\nGreece were eyeing each other with growing suspicion. Ultimately, however, it was a\npair of epochal events that occurred well outside the Middle East\u2014the Bolshevik\nRevolution and the emergence of Woodrow Wilson as the globe\u2019s dominant political\nfigure\u2014that did the most to complicate the victors\u2019 efforts to arrive at a stable settlement\nin the region.\nThe Bolsheviks\nFrom the very start, the Bolshevik seizure of power in November 1917 greatly\nconfounded French and, especially, British efforts to secure dominion in the Middle\nEast. It did so in two ways. First, Commissar for Foreign Affairs Leon Trotsky (1879-\n1940) revealed the hypocrisy of the French and British governments\u2019 claims that they\nfought to spread democracy and to help advance the interest of small and weak nations\nby publishing the secret treaties that the Allied states had concluded with one another\u2014\nincluding the Sykes-Picot Agreement. Coming on the immediate heels of the Balfour\nDeclaration, the revelation of this nakedly imperialist treaty embarrassed London and\nParis and raised doubts in the Hashimite camp about whether they could trust the\nBritish. Second, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin (r. 1917-1924), who had long called for\nself-determination for the many millions of people across the globe living under foreign\nrule, had stepped up his criticism of imperialism after his party seized power in Russia in\nNovember 1917. In doing so, Lenin was being disingenuous. His opposition to\nimperialism sprang far-less from any interest he may have had in helping people living\nunder the yoke of colonialism secure their independence than from his desire to weaken\nthe capitalist states. That he was being duplicitous was ultimately unimportant in the\nimmediate postwar era, however. What mattered was that his words helped create the\nexpectation among people ruled by a foreign power or facing the prospect of being\n28 Ulrichsen, 94\u201395. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 291\nincorporated into a colonial empire that they could and should enjoy self-determination\nin the aftermath of the war.29\nThe \u201cWilsonian Moment\u201d\nThe Bolsheviks thus posed a serious ideological challenge to the democratic-\ncapitalist states\u2014one that Woodrow Wilson, who had brought his country into the war in\nApril 1917, felt he needed to counter. The result was his most important address: The\nFourteen Points Speech that he gave before Congress on January 8, 1918. In it, he\noutlined four general principles\u2014open diplomacy, freedom of the seas, free trade, and\ndisarmament\u2014that he argued should govern international relations in the postwar\nworld. He also proposed the establishment of a new, supranational institution, the\nLeague of Nations, that would be empowered to enforce peace and prevent the\noutbreak of another general war, and he outlined nine specific territorial adjustments\ndesigned to achieve self-determination and the equality of nations. His twelfth point\ndealt specifically with the Middle East. It called for the creation of a Turkish state, but\nalso stipulated that the other nations in the Ottoman Empire should have \u201can absolutely\nunmolested opportunity of autonomous development.\u201d30\nIt was a bravura performance. Well publicized by the US government, Wilson\u2019s\ncall for a new system of international relations based on the Fourteen Points captured\nthe imagination of people across the globe. Coming from the leader of the world\u2019s most\npowerful state, it dramatically overshadowed Lenin\u2019s message and led people to believe\nthat an Allied victory would remake the world along liberal-democratic lines. It thus set\nthe stage for what the historian Erez Manela calls the \u201c\u2018Wilsonian Moment\u2019\u201d: the period\nbetween November 1918 and March 1919 when colonized people, whose expectations\nhad risen dramatically as a result of Wilson\u2019s call for self-determination, shifted from\ntheir earlier calls for limited reforms or autonomy to demands for outright\nindependence.31\nThe Paris Peace Conference, January-June 1919\nIn two critical ways, Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points address dramatically altered the\nglobal diplomatic landscape. First, it inspired nationalists to take their case to the Paris\nPeace Conference at which the postwar order was to be determined. Indeed, believing\nthat they had the support of the American president, dozens of unaccredited groups,\nindividuals, and officials arrived in France to press for independence in the winter and\nspring of 1919. From the Middle East alone, delegations came from Armenia, Syria,\n29 Erez Manela, The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International\nOrigins of Anticolonial Nationalism (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 37\u201338.\n30 \u201cPresident Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points,\u201d accessed June 4, 2020,\nhttps://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/wilson14.asp.\n31 Manela, The Wilsonian Moment, 4\u20136. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 292\nLebanon, and Persia seeking to enlist the support of their champion in their newfound\nefforts to secure self-government.32\nSecond, in making clear Wilson\u2019s strong opposition to formal colonialism and his\ndetermination to prevent the peace settlement from turning into a land grab, the\nFourteen Points address placed significant limits on the ability of the Allies to take\nterritory from the defeated Central Powers after the war. In assessing Wilson\u2019s ability to\nlimit the Allies territorial ambitions it is important to understand that, while powerful, the\nAmerican president was not in a position to dictate to the Allies, and that he, too, faced\nconstraints. Most notably, the need to secure the Allies\u2019 approval of the League of\nNations\u2014the centerpiece of his global vision\u2014compelled Wilson to repeatedly agree to\nvast transfers of territory that violated the spirit of the Fourteen Points. Still, as the\nleader of the world\u2019s most powerful state\u2014a country to which the Allies owed almost-\nincalculably large sums of money\u2014he was more than strong enough to compel them to\njustify the acquisition of any new territory and to pay at least lip service to the idea that\nthey were acting to help the affected people achieve self-determination.33\nBritain was far-better positioned to do so in the Middle East than were its imperial\nrivals. Indeed, the McMahon-Husayn Correspondence and the Balfour Declaration\nallowed London to portray its territorial ambition in the region not as a land grab but\ninstead as a selfless effort on its part to help Zionists and Arabs alike achieve self-\ndetermination. Britain was thus able to win the president\u2019s approval for its territorial\nacquisitions in the Middle East and was even able to secure his assistance in its efforts\nto deny Syria to the French. Paris and Rome, in contrast, had no similar agreements\nthat they could use to disguise their expansionist goals in the region and faced an uphill\nfight in persuading Wilson to give his blessings to their imperial ambitions. Thus, as the\npeace talks heated up in the spring of 1919, Britain appeared to have smartly\noutmaneuvered its erstwhile allies\u2014casting them as naked imperialists at the very\nmoment, ironically, that it was massively expanding its own empire in the Middle East\nand elsewhere.34\nWilson further complicated the disposition of the Ottoman Empire by preventing\nthe victors from simply adding newly gained territory to their colonial empires. Great\nPower pressure and his own deeply held racist beliefs may have compelled Wilson to\naccept the Allies\u2019 acquisition of territory after the war, but he remained implacably\nopposed to traditional imperialism. Indeed, he forthrightly insisted that any territorial\ngains had to be temporary and that the affected places had to be administered in the\nbest interest of their inhabitants. The result was a compromise solution known as the\nMandate System. Overseen by the League of Nations, it designated the former German\ncolonies and large sections of the Ottoman Empire as mandates: territories that were\nnot-yet ready for self-rule and thus needed tutelage under an established power. It then\nassigned each to a so-called mandatory power and tasked those states with preparing\n32 Manela, 59\u201360.\n33 Manela, 59\u201360.\n34 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 376\u201378. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 293\nthe peoples that they administered for eventual independence. The Mandate System\nthus reconciled Wilson\u2019s opposition to formal colonialism with the Allies\u2019 insistence that\nthey acquire territory at the end of the war. If it was a compromise, however, it was one\nthat leaned heavily toward traditional imperialism. That is, despite the rhetoric about\npreparing the people of the mandates for self-governance, it amounted in practical\nterms to little more than a perpetuation of the existing colonial system under a new\nname.35\nGiven this background, the negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference in the\nwinter and spring of 1919 proved to be disheartening for the Arabs. Wilson\u2019s\nacceptance of the mandate system for the Arab part of the Ottoman Empire at the start\nof the conference had already taken genuine independence off the table. Meanwhile,\nthe president\u2019s refusal to meet with the unaccredited delegations from the Middle East\ndenied the Arabs any opportunity to plead their case for self-determination.36\nEven in the rare instances in which the Arabs enjoyed diplomatic successes,\ntheir achievements came with significant caveats. With London\u2019s help, for example,\nFaysal had succeeded in assuming the title of king of Syria and in establishing a\ngovernment in Damascus. Exploiting his dependence, however, British officials\nsignificantly undermined those achievements by compelling him to sign the Weizmann-\nFaysal Agreement in which he formally accepted the terms of the Balfour Declaration\nand effectively ceded Palestine to the Zionists. Likewise, the King-Crane Commission, a\nfact-finding mission sent to the region to determine the wishes of its residents,\naccurately reported both Syrian hostility to the prospects of France becoming the\nmandatory power over their country and Palestinian-Arab opposition to the\nestablishment of a Jewish homeland in the mandate and thus raised hopes that Wilson\nmight rein in Paris and London. Thanks to the president\u2019s continued need for French\nand British support in his efforts to secure the League of Nations, however, the\ncommission\u2019s report had no impact on the disposition of Arab territory.37\nMeanwhile, even as the Arabs were reduced to bystanders, the talks over a final\nsettlement in the Middle East dragged on. The primary holdup was Syria. With France\nand Britain at loggerheads over which would take possession of the vilayet, precious\nlittle progress could be made regarding the final disposition of Ottoman territory. In the\nend, it took two significant changes to the global diplomatic situation to break the\ndeadlock. First, with Wilson incapacitated by a severe stroke, the US Senate rejected\nmembership in the League of Nations in November 1919. As a result, the Europeans\nwere now free to structure the peace among themselves without having to adhere fully\nto the president\u2019s demands. Second, with costly crises in Ireland, India, and Egypt\nstraining the treasury, the badly overextended British government concluded that it\n35 Zara Steiner, The Lights That Failed: European International History 1919-1933\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 105.\n36 Manela, The Wilsonian Moment, 59\u201360.\n37 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 390\u201394, 406. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 294\nneeded to trim its commitments. As part of that retrenchment, Lloyd George and his\ncolleagues decided to abandon Faysal and permit the French to occupy Syria.38\nThe Treaty of S\u00e8vres, August 1920\nWith London having cut the Gordian knot, representatives of Britain, France, and\nItaly were finally able to arrive at an agreement regarding the Middle East. Meeting in\nthe Italian resort town of San Remo in April 1920, they finally hashed out the terms of\nthe Treaty of S\u00e8vres, the peace settlement that would formally end the war between the\nAllies and the Ottoman Empire. It stipulated the division of the Arab portion of the\ndefeated empire along what amounted to a modified version of the Sykes-Picot\nAgreement. France would assume separate mandates over Syria and Lebanon but\nagreed to cede Mosul to London in exchange for the rights to a one-quarter share of the\nprovince\u2019s oil. Paris also indicated its willingness to have Faysal continue to serve as\nking of Syria, albeit in a strictly titular capacity. For its part, Britain would acquire a\nmandate over a new country, Iraq, that encompassed the vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad,\nand Basra; it would also become the mandatory power for Palestine where it was\nformally tasked with implementing the Balfour Declaration. Further north, the treaty\npartitioned the south coast of Anatolia between France, Italy, and Greece and\nestablished an autonomous Kurdish region and an independent Armenia. Both the city\nof Istanbul and the straits would fall under international administration. Finally, what little\nremained of the Ottoman Empire would be compelled to accept the reinstitution of the\ncapitulations.39\nThe treaty was thus a draconian one that effectively dismembered the empire\u2014a\nbitter pill for a dynasty and state that had once held substantial territory on three\ncontinents. With the capital literally under the guns of the British navy, however, it was\nalso an agreement that the defeated Ottomans were in no position to refuse.\nAccordingly, desperate to hang on to power, the final Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI\n(r. 1918-1922) signed the treaty in August 1920.40\nLondon was, without question, the primary beneficiary of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres.\nWith it, British officials had obtained the arc of territory stretching from the Sinai\nPeninsula in the west to the Persian border in the east needed to prevent a rival from\nthreatening the vital communications that connected India and Britain. They had also\ngained direct or indirect control of all of the Middle East\u2019s known oil reserves\u2014a\ncommodity that had demonstrated its enormous strategic value in the recent war. As\n38 Steiner, The Lights That Failed, 107.\n39 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 439\u201340.\n40 McMeekin, 439\u201340. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 295\nsuch, London had achieved the position of hegemonic dominance in the region that\nLloyd George had sought.41\nWhat is more, the British did not anticipate facing significant challenges to their\nrule in the region moving forward. Instead, the cabinet was quite confident that the\nArabs would quickly accommodate themselves to trading the corrupt and inefficient rule\nof the Ottoman Empire for the stability, progress, and order that they believed London\u2019s\nmastery of the region would bring. Indeed, at the time that the prime minister signed the\nTreaty of S\u00e8vres, he and his colleagues expected that the people of the region would\nnot merely welcome Britain\u2019s enlightened administration but would also enthusiastically\ncooperate with their new imperial rulers.42\nResistance\nThese assumptions proved to be almost comically off the mark. The people of\nthe Middle East sought not tutelage or exploitation, but instead independence and the\nopportunity to freely develop their economies and political institutions. Accordingly,\nrather than producing the gratitude and the positive, cooperative relationship between\nthe people of the region and their new masters that British officials had anticipated, the\nefforts to secure hegemony over the Middle East birthed a series of vigorous resistance\nmovements in nearly every part of the region. Popular demands for rapid postwar\ndemobilization in Britain and elite insistence that the cabinet trim expenses so as to\nreturn the government to a balanced budget and the gold standard greatly complicated\nLondon\u2019s ability to respond to these challenges. As a result, while these resistance\nmovements lacked the power to expel the British and its allies from the Middle East,\nneither could London impose its will on the region.43\nEgypt\u2014the Wafd Party\nThat the resistance to the Treaty caught the British unaware is surprising in light\nof the fact that it first emerged more than a year before the formal signing of the Treaty\nof S\u00e8vres. It did so in Egypt, and it occurred as a result of the hopes that Wilson\u2019s call\nfor self-determination had raised. Until nearly the end of the First World War, Egyptian\nnationalists had sought comparatively modest goals such as greater autonomy and a\nlarger Egyptian role in the administration of the protectorate. As was the case in other\nparts of the world, however, Wilson\u2019s Fourteen Points Speech had dramatically altered\nexpectations in Egypt. Thereafter, nationalists no longer hoped for mere autonomy but\n41 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 395; Kourosh Ahmadi, Islands and International Politics in the\nPersian Gulf: The Abu Musa and Tunbs in Strategic Context (New York: Routledge,\n2008), 66\u201367.\n42 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 420.\n43 Fromkin, 386\u201388, 420. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 296\ninstead anticipated that their country would, with the president\u2019s help, win complete\nindependence following the war.44\nAccordingly, in November 1918, a group of nationalists led by the former Minister\nof Justice, Saad Zaghul (1859-1927), requested that Britain permit a delegation, or\nwafd, to travel to Paris to present Egypt\u2019s case for independence. Their demand\nalarmed British officials. Implacably opposed to granting independence to Egypt, they\nflatly refused to permit the wafd to leave Egypt for France. The nationalists were not\neasily dissuaded, however. Anticipating that Wilson would help them once he learned of\ntheir plight, they responded by organizing rallies, collecting petitions, and forming a new\npolitical organization, the Wafd Party, to mobilize the people in support of\nindependence. Still, the British refused to budge.45\nThe standoff turned to open revolt in March 1919. Fearing that the nationalists\u2019\ncampaign was making inroads with the Egyptian masses, High Commissioner Reginald\nWingate (1861-1953) arrested Zaghul and several other Wafd Party leaders and\ndeported them to the island of Malta. It was a bold move\u2014and a counterproductive one.\nRather than quelling the growing opposition to British rule, the arrests outraged people\nthroughout the country and sparked a province-wide mass uprising called the\nRevolution of 1919. Over the next few months, Egyptians rioted, participated in protests,\ntore up railways, cut telegraph lines, and went on strike to make clear their opposition to\nBritain\u2019s detention of the Wafd leaders and its refusal to discuss independence. The\ndemonstrations were enormously popular and enjoyed support from all elements of\nEgyptian society. They brought Muslims and Christians together and, in a break with\nlongstanding custom, even involved substantial numbers of women. The protests and,\nespecially, the British response, were also violent. By the time the colonial authorities\nmanaged to restore some measure of order in April, eight-hundred Egyptians and sixty\nBritons had died in the unrest.46\nLondon responded by replacing Wingate with the more diplomatic Allenby in late\nMarch. Aware that the arrest of Zaghul and his colleagues had amounted to heaping\nfuel on a raging fire, the field marshal announced in short order that he was releasing\nthe Wafd leaders. The move worked. To London\u2019s relief, even while the Egyptians\ncontinued to seethe at the British, stability returned to the province.47\nMeanwhile, now free to plead Egypt\u2019s case before the peace conference, Zaghul\nand his colleagues traveled directly from Malta to Paris. They got there too late. Just\nbefore the delegation finally arrived, the US formally declared that it was recognizing\nBritain\u2019s protectorate over Egypt. It was a sobering moment for the nationalists. Not only\nhad Egypt failed to gain its independence, but Wilson, its purported champion, had\nrepudiated their call for self-determination.

Instead, they pressed on with their call for nothing less\nthan full independence.48\nSyria and Transjordan\nResistance to the Treaty of S\u00e8vres next appeared in Syria. It did not, at least\ninitially, come from the top. With the treaty having assigned Syria to France, the British\nhad instructed Faysal to work out an agreement with Paris. Faysal was furious with\nLondon for abandoning him, but he was also a pragmatist. As such, he was open to\naccepting Paris\u2019s proposal that he serve as king of Syria in a titular capacity under\nFrench protection. Syrian nationalists were far less flexible than the king, however. On\nthe contrary, adamant that Syria become a genuinely independent state rather than a\nnominally autonomous part of the French Empire, they pressured Faysal to adopt a\nhard line. They also began firing on French troops along the border between Syria and\nFrench-occupied Lebanon. Paris was not amused. Determined to assert control of\nSyria, it ordered High Commissioner Henri Gouraud (1867-1946) to invade Syria from\nLebanon in July 1920. Disciplined and well-armed, his powerful army easily brushed\naside a much smaller Arab force on July 24 and established control of Syria. A strident\nnationalist, Gouraud promptly set the tone for French rule by ostentatiously going to the\nMausoleum of Saladin and declaring \u201c\u2018arise Saladin, we have returned, and my\npresence here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent.\u2019\u201d49\nThe Hashimites felt justifiably betrayed. London had first browbeaten Faysal into\naccepting the separation of Palestine from Syria and had then abandoned him to the\nFrench despite its earlier promises of support\u2014a move that had resulted in Faysal\nfleeing, humiliated, into exile. Indeed, with his expulsion from Syria, the only provision in\nthe McMahon-Husayn Correspondence that London was still honoring was the one\ncalling for it to formally recognize Husayn\u2019s Kingdom of the Hijaz\u2014a territory, the\nHashimites pointed out, that they had controlled long before they had begun negotiating\nwith Britain in 1915. The family was not entirely without recourse, however. In\nNovember 1920, Faysal\u2019s brother Abdallah, the future king of Jordan, and a small force\nof irregulars moved to contest Paris and London\u2019s overbearing actions by occupying\nTransjordan: the anarchic, lightly populated no man\u2019s land that lay on the eastern side\nof the Jordan River. While there, he announced that he was recruiting volunteers to join\nhim in a campaign aimed at expelling the French from Syria and at restoring his brother\nto the throne. It was a bold action\u2014one that greatly alarmed the British, who feared that\n48 Manela, The Wilsonian Moment, 143\u201357.\n49 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 406\u20137; Quote from Michael Provence, The Last Ottoman\nGeneration and the Making of the Modern Middle East (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2017), 3. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 298\nthe French would use his attacks as a pretext to add the territory of Transjordan, which\nthe Sykes-Picot Agreement had assigned to Britain, to its Syrian Mandate.50\nPalestine\nIn the meantime, opposition to British rule and the Treaty of S\u00e8vres had spread\nto Palestine. The Balfour Declaration\u2019s formal expression of support for a Jewish\nhomeland was the primary source of this resistance. Though the statement had\nforthrightly declared that \u201cnothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and\nreligious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine,\u201d the Arabs feared that\nLondon\u2019s pledge of support for Zionism would leave them a subordinate people in an\nalien and hostile state. A surge in Zionist immigration and an uptick in Jewish land\npurchases following Britain\u2019s assumption of control of the territory confirmed these\nconcerns and rapidly raised tensions in the mandate. The mounting frustration finally\nboiled over with the outbreak of massive anti-Zionist riots in Jerusalem in April 1920 and\nJaffa in May 1921. The intercommunal violence shocked the British. Resulting in the\ndeaths of sixty-four Arabs and ninety-five Jewish people, it made clear to them for the\nfirst time the depths of Palestinian hostility to both Zionism and Britain and led at least\nsome officials to begin to question the wisdom of the Balfour Declaration.51\nThe Iraq Revolt, 1920\nThe most serious resistance to Britain\u2019s play for dominance in the Arab world\noccurred in Mesopotamia in the summer of 1920. The territory, which British officials\nhad taken to calling by its old Arab name, Iraq, was something of a Frankenstein\ncreation. London had fashioned it by joining the heavily Kurdish vilayet of Mosul to the\npredominantly Arab vilayets of Basra and Baghdad. While the latter pair had strong\nhistorical links, ethnically distinct Mosul had only limited economic connections with\nthem\u2014a fact that suggested to some that welding the three vilayets into a coherent\nstate would be a serious challenge. Indeed, one American missionary cautioned that\nmerging them together was tantamount to \u201c\u2018flying in the face of four millenniums of\nhistory.\u2019\u201d Such warnings were prescient. As we shall see, the union of these vilayets\nwould prove problematic. However, their merger was not the reason that Iraq erupted in\nthe summer of 1920.52\nInstead, the revolt was a product of London\u2019s heavy-handed approach to the\nadministration of the territory. Britain\u2019s establishment of a mandate without any\nconsultation with the region\u2019s inhabitants quickly aroused intense nationalist sentiments\namong urban Arabs. More importantly, the imposition of levies designed to cover the\ncosts of the mandate\u2019s administration infuriated the tribal Arabs of the rural areas who\n50 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 183\u201384.\n51 Quote from \u201cThe Balfour Declaration, November 2, 1917\u201d; Rogan, The Arabs, 197\u2013\n98.\n52 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 450\u201351. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 299\nhad not previously had to pay taxes. As a result, in early July, a thawra, or revolt, broke\nout along the Lower Euphrates River and quickly spread north to the region around\nBaghdad. The British were almost completely unprepared for it. Failing to grasp the\ndegree to which Iraqis opposed the mandate, London had sought to maintain order in\nthe territory with a garrison that was inadequate even in times of peace. Thoroughly\novermatched by a rebellion supported by an estimated 131,000 insurgents, it could do\nnothing to prevent the guerillas from seizing huge swaths of territory in central Iraq.53\nLondon acted quickly to regain control of Iraq. Deploying reinforcements from\nIndia, it used a combination of overwhelming force and divide-and-conquer tactics to roll\nback the revolt. The British campaign was as brutal as it was effective. With the\nassistance of aircraft that dropped both conventional and mustard-gas bombs on\nvillages believed to be supporting the insurgents, British and Indian troops were able to\nrestore control over the main population centers and lines of communication by\nOctober. Additional operations further suppressed the rebellion to the point that by\nFebruary 1921, the British had succeeded in fully extinguishing the thawra.54\nPutting the revolt down had proven very costly, however. The fighting had\nresulted in the deaths of 500 Indian and British troops and an estimated 6,000 Iraqis.\nWorse, in the eyes of the budget-minded cabinet, it had set the exchequer back a\nwhopping \u00a340 million\u2014a sum larger than the amount Britain had spent on the entire\nArab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1917 and 1918.55\nMore broadly, the revolt revealed the tension that existed between London\u2019s\nexpansive goals in the region and the more-limited resources it was willing to expend to\nattain those ends. That gap was substantial. On the one hand, popular demands for\ndemobilization and elite insistence on a balanced budget resulted in the government\ncutting military expenditures in half every year from 1919 to 1923. On the other, Lloyd\nGeorge\u2019s cabinet was determined to secure the fruits of Britain\u2019s victory in the Middle\nEast by establishing control of the territories that its armies had taken possession of\nduring and just after the war\u2014a task that appeared to require a great deal of money and\ntroops. The revolt thus brought the contradiction between Britain\u2019s limited means and its\nexpansive objectives into clear focus. Simply put, hegemony in the Arab Middle East\nalong the lines outlined in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres demanded money and troops that Britain\nwas unwilling to spend.56\n53 Toby Dodge, Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a History Denied\n(New York: Columbia University Press, 2003), x, 8\u20139, 134; Quote from Fromkin, A\nPeace to End All Peace, 451.\n54 Christopher Catherwood, Churchill\u2019s Folly: How Winston Churchill Created Modern\nIraq (New York: Basic Books, 2005), 85; Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 452\u201353.\n55 Charles Tripp, A History of Iraq (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 8\u20139.\n56 Tripp, 43\u201344; Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 8\u20139, 134\u201335. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 300\nTurkey\nMeanwhile, the most successful and consequential opposition to Britain\u2019s effort to\nachieve hegemony in the Middle East occurred in Turkey. The resistance there was so\neffective, in fact, that the country was able to renegotiate the peace that the victors had\nimposed on it\u2014something none of the other members of the Central Powers would\nmanage to achieve. That it was able to do so was astonishing in light of the feeble\nposition that the Ottoman Empire occupied immediately following World War I. Brutally\none sided, the armistice of Mudros had compelled Istanbul to demobilize its military\nforces and gave the Allied powers carte blanche to occupy any territory they deemed\nstrategic\u2014thus allowing the victors to dominate completely the Ottoman Empire and its\ngovernment. The armistice agreement also included provisions permitting the Allied\npowers to take control of key territories and to neutralize the straits. By early 1919, as a\nresult, the Turks had hit rock bottom. Crushed militarily and diplomatically and lacking a\ngenuinely autonomous government, they appeared to be a thoroughly beaten people,\npowerless to resist further territorial demands.57\nIronically, their revival was the unintended consequence of a dispute among the\nAllies in early 1919 over the disposition of Turkish territory. At issue was the\npredominantly Greek city of Smyrna that both Italy and Greece coveted. Annoyed with\nRome\u2019s increasingly expansive territorial aspirations, Wilson and Lloyd George had\nsought to preempt an Italian move on the city by authorizing the Greek government to\ndeploy troops to occupy it in May 1919. The decision delighted Greece\u2019s nationalistic\nprime minister, Eleftherios Venizelos (r. 1917-1920). Committed to achieving the megali\nidea, he wasted no time in sending a substantial army to Smyrna. Upon its arrival, it\nreceived a hero\u2019s welcome from a Greek community that was ecstatic that the city was\ngoing to become part of Greece. Unsurprisingly, the Turks did not share their\nenthusiasm. On the contrary, the deployment of Greek soldiers to Asia Minor aroused\nwidespread anger and produced a surge of nationalist sentiment among Anatolia\u2019s\nTurkish majority. In fact, it was the arrival of Greek troops that catalyzed the emergence\nof Turkish resistance to the peace plan. As future President Kemal Mustafa (r. 1923-\n1938), later wrote, \u201c\u2018[if] the enemy had not stupidly come here, the whole country might\nhave slept on heedlessly.\u2019\u201d58\nDetermined to prevent the carve up of Anatolia, Kemal Mustafa assumed\nleadership of an embryonic Turkish nationalist movement in May 1919. A veteran of the\nGallipoli campaign, he quickly established a new political infrastructure and a reformed\nmilitary force in Anatolia. He also oversaw the drafting of the National Pact: a\ndeclaration of principles that renounced the Arab portion of the Ottoman Empire while\nsimultaneously calling for the establishment of a Turkish state free of foreign\n57 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 406\u201311.\n58 Erik Goldstein, The First World War Peace Settlements, 1919-1925: From Versailles\nto Locarno, 1919-25 (Routledge, 2013), 59. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 301\ninterference in those areas that had a Turkish majority\u2014including Armenia and\nKurdistan.59\nEven as Kemal Mustafa steadily gained the support of a growing number of\nTurks in 1919, the British remained oblivious to the rapidly maturing resistance he led.\nIn fact, they only awoke to the danger that his movement posed to their designs for the\nMiddle East when the newly elected Ottoman Chamber of Deputies formally adopted\nthe National Pact in February 1920. Finally grasping the threat that the nationalists\nposed, Lloyd George moved quickly to crush the movement by ordering the occupation\nof Istanbul and the dissolution of the Ottoman legislature in March 1920. This attempt to\nhobble the nationalists backfired badly, however. The occupation destroyed what little\ncredibility the sultan still possessed even as Kemal Mustafa\u2019s movement gained\nlegitimacy thanks to its resolute opposition to the Allies\u2014particularly after he made\nAnkara the new capital by convening a new legislative body there in April 1920 called\nthe Grand National Assembly. Collectively, these events dramatically raised the\nnationalists\u2019 standing. From that point forward, the sultan\u2019s regime may have enjoyed\ninternational recognition, but it was Kemal Mustafa\u2019s government that possessed\npopular support\u2014and thus genuine sovereignty\u2014among the Turks.60\nWith his seizure of Istanbul having failed to arrest the nationalist movement,\nLloyd George found himself caught in a steadily worsening situation. By June, Kemal\nMustafa\u2019s increasingly aggressive soldiers were menacing British troops guarding the\nneutral zone that the Allies had set up around the straits. Compounding the situation,\nthe British government\u2019s self-imposed fiscal restraints and prior military commitments\nmeant that the prime minister had no reserves with which to reinforce them.\nNonetheless, Lloyd George refused to scale back his goals in Asia Minor. Instead,\nseeking to uphold the terms of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, he authorized Greece\u2014effectively\nBritain\u2019s catspaw in the region\u2014to march its army out from Smyrna and secure the\ncoastal plain. Venizelos happily complied. Eager to pursue his country\u2019s irredentist\nclaims in Anatolia, he ordered the Greek army to occupy the lowlands of western Asia\nMinor\u2014a move that compelled Kemal Mustafa\u2019s forces to retreat to the central plateau.\nIt was an impressive victory on paper, one that both secured control of substantial\nterritory and protected the straits. It had no substantive effect on the strategic balance,\nhowever. So long as the nationalists maintained an army in central Anatolia, the peace\nsettlement on which Britain\u2019s grand designs for the Middle East rested could not be\nguaranteed and was thus incomplete.61\nDespite the mounting risks, Lloyd George and the Greeks continued to bet on a\nmilitary solution. Thanks to two significant shifts in the balance of power, it was a\ngamble with ever-worsening odds. First, seeking to curb Britain\u2019s influence in the region,\n59 Erik J. Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey: A Modern History, Third Edition (London: I.B. Tauris, 2004),\n149\u201352.\n60 Caroline Finkel, Osman\u2019s Dream: The History of the Ottoman Empire (New York:\nBasic Books, 2005), 541\u201342.\n61 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 430\u201332. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 302\nthe USSR joined the Turkish nationalists in conquering the independent Armenian\nrepublic in late 1920 and followed by agreeing to supply Ataturk\u2019s forces with arms.\nSecond, a concurrent nationalist diplomatic effort aimed at peeling off London\u2019s allies\nbegan to bear fruit. Having concluded that Kemal Mustafa\u2019s movement could not be\nbeaten at an acceptable cost, the French and Italian governments agreed in 1921 to\nevacuate their troops from Asia Minor in exchange for economic concessions. As a\nresult, the nationalists\u2014now vastly better armed thanks to the USSR\u2014were able to free\nup substantial additional forces for use against the Greeks.62\nUnwilling to cut their losses, Athens and London pressed on. With Lloyd\nGeorge\u2019s blessing, the Greek army launched an offensive toward Ankara in June 1921\naimed at destroying the nationalist movement. It was a long and brutal campaign in\nwhich the Greeks systematically burned Turkish villages in order to secure the supply\nlines needed to sustain their army so far from its bases. Finally, at the end of the\nsummer, the invaders compelled Kemal Mustafa\u2019s nationalist military to stand and fight\nalong the Sakarya River just fifty miles from Ankara. While the Greeks prevailed in the\nfirst few days of the battle, a powerful Turkish counterattack broke their morale and\ncompelled them to retreat to a new line on the edge of the Anatolian plateau. It was a\nhuge triumph for the nationalists\u2014one that further solidified the movement\u2019s political\nstanding among the Turks.63\nThe nationalist campaign of resistance ended in victory the following year. In\nAugust 1922, Kemal Mustafa defeated the Greek army so completely that it first\nretreated in disorder to the coast and then abandoned Anatolia altogether. Retribution\nsoon followed. Most notoriously, after Venizelos\u2019s forces withdrew, a massive fire\ndestroyed the Greek quarter of Smyrna and rendered hundreds-of-thousands of its\nresidents homeless. Facing the prospect of further violence, nearly all of them fled\nAnatolia for Greece as refugees. More would follow. Finally, in October, the arrival of\nTurkish troops opposite British positions guarding the straits at Chanak put Britain and\nthe nationalists on the brink of war. Some of the hardliners in the British government\nwanted to fight, but, this time, more moderate voices prevailed. As a result, London and\nthe nationalists agreed to a ceasefire that called for the Turkish army to stand down in\nexchange for a British promise to renegotiate the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. Lloyd George would\nnot be involved in those talks, however. Coming on the heels of the other problems that\nhis aggressive policies in the Middle East had created, the Chanak Crisis brought down\nhis government and ended his stint as prime minister.64\nThe Settlement of 1922\nThe extent and intensity of the resistance to British hegemony that culminated in\nthe Chanak Crisis compelled London to rethink its approach to the Middle East. Not only\nhad Lloyd George\u2019s plan for regional dominance failed, but it had imposed costs that the\n62 McMeekin, The Ottoman Endgame, 443\u201352.\n63 McMeekin, 454\u201358.\n64 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 450\u201352. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 303\nBritish government was unwilling to shoulder. London did not completely abandon the\nformer prime minister\u2019s drive for regional hegemony, however. Instead, it articulated in\npiecemeal fashion the Settlement of 1922\u2014a new approach toward the region designed\nto replace the Treaty of S\u00e8vres with a new arrangement that could, by meeting the\nminimal demands of the region\u2019s peoples, sustain London\u2019s control of the Middle East. It\nwas a complex settlement\u2014one that included a renegotiated peace agreement with the\nTurkish nationalists, nominal Egyptian independence, and, crucially, an effort by British\nofficials to reconcile the McMahon-Husayn Correspondence, the Balfour Declaration,\nand the Sykes-Picot Agreement. The settlement was successful in the short run insofar\nas it helped London achieve its goal of retaining a dominant position in the Middle East\nduring the interwar period at a cost that London found acceptable. It did not set the\nstage for the region\u2019s long-term stability or development, however. On the contrary, it\nbred resentments, undermined prospects for the institutionalization of representative\ngovernments, and created states whose legitimacy\u2014and even their very right to exist\u2014\nremained widely questioned.65\nThe Treaty of Lausanne, July 1923\nThe effort to resolve the Chanak Crisis ultimately produced the most enduring\npart of the settlement: the Treaty of Lausanne. Its negotiation was nearly as hard fought\nas the combat that had preceded it. Determined to drive a tough bargain, Britain set the\ntone by inviting the sultan\u2019s government to send a separate delegation in a bid to\nweaken the nationalists\u2019 position; no stranger to hardball tactics, Kemal Mustafa deftly\ncountered that move by abolishing the sultanate in November 1922. The tough\nnegotiations continued after the conference finally got underway. Most notably, the\nTurkish representative, the former general, Ismet Inonu (1884-1973), habitually signaled\nhis opposition to London\u2019s proposals by demonstratively removing his hearing aid when\nthe British negotiator, Lord Curzon (1859-1925) was speaking and only replacing it\nwhen Curzon had finished.66\nThe resulting treaty was a major victory for the nationalists. To be sure, Kemal\nMustafa and his allies did have to make some concessions. For example, Inonu had no\nchoice but to agree to permit the League of Nations to determine the disposition of the\nvilayet of Mosul\u2014a region that Kemal Mustafa had insisted should revert from Iraqi to\nTurkish control. The balance of the treaty more than offset such provisions, however. It\nabsolved Turkey of the burden of paying reparations, ended the much-resented\ncapitulations, and\u2014though it called for their neutralization\u2014returned the straits to\nTurkish sovereignty. More importantly, it assigned to Turkey all of the parts of the former\nOttoman Empire in which Turkish people composed a majority of the population and\nthus secured international recognition of the National Pact. Relatedly, the agreement\nhelped the nationalists achieve their goal of making their country more ethnically\nhomogenous. Most notably, it provided for \u201ca \u201c\u2018compulsory exchange\u2019 of populations\u201d\n65 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 559\u201363.\n66 MacMillan, Paris 1919, 452; James William Spain, In Those Days: A Diplomat\nRemembers (Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1998), 162. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 304\nbetween Greece and Turkey that resulted in the eviction of 1.3 million Greek people\nfrom Turkey and the expulsion of 800,000 Muslims from Greece in what was the first\ninstance of internationally sanctioned ethnic cleansing following World War I. Sadly, it\nwould not be the last.67\nThe Cairo Conference\nWhile Curzon directed the negotiations with Turkey, Winston Churchill (1874-\n1965), in his new capacity as secretary of state for the colonies, oversaw the\nrestructuring of Britain\u2019s empire in Palestine and Iraq. As Churchill knew all too well,\n1920 had been a rough year for Britain\u2019s imperial pretensions in the region. The rioting\nin Jerusalem suggested that it had stumbled into a costly quagmire in Palestine, while\nAbdallah\u2019s threat to invade French-controlled Syria raised the possibility that the\nHashimites could drag Britain into a crisis with its French ally-cum-rival. Worst of all, the\nrevolt in Mesopotamia had turned Iraq into a money pit at a time when London was\ncommitted to aggressively cutting the budget. Coming in rapid succession, these\nproblems were dispiriting and seemed insoluble to many observers. Indeed, the\nsituation appeared so intractably bleak in early 1921 that some officials were beginning\nto quietly wonder whether Britain should abandon its Middle Eastern mandates\naltogether.68\nChurchill did not share that view. A committed imperialist, he moved with\ncharacteristic energy to find a solution to the empire\u2019s problems in the Arab world. He\nhad three explicit goals. First, believing that Britain\u2019s Middle Eastern mandates were\nvaluable additions to the empire, he sought to ensure that London retained control of\nthem. Second, aware that Britain needed to economize in order to get back on the gold\nstandard, he wanted to dramatically reduce the cost that they imposed on the\nexchequer. Finally, he hoped to undo the damage that London had done to its\ninternational reputation by failing to live up to the terms of its wartime agreements\nregarding the Middle East. That is, he wanted to find a way to reconcile the seemingly\nincompatible terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, McMahon-Husayn Correspondence,\nand Balfour Declaration.69\nThese were daunting goals, even for a person with Churchill\u2019s diplomatic savvy.\nRetaining possession of the territory it had secured through the Treaty of S\u00e8vres\nrequired the maintenance of a substantial civil and military presence in the region\u2014one\nthat, by its very existence, would greatly complicate efforts to reduce the budget.\nLikewise, harmonizing diplomatic agreements that had promised the same territory to\ndifferent parties would be no simple task.70\n67 Steiner, The Lights That Failed, 120\u201323; Quote from McMeekin, The Ottoman\nEndgame, 489.\n68 Catherwood, Churchill\u2019s Folly, 94\u2013103.\n69 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 493\u201399, 528\u201329.\n70 Fromkin, 493\u201399, 528\u201329. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 305\nTo achieve these challenging ends, Churchill convened the Cairo Conference at\nthe Semiramis Hotel in Cairo in March 1921. The list of British officials and experts who\ntook part was impressive. The attendees included high-ranking bureaucrats and military\nofficers stationed in the region as well as Middle East experts such as T. E. Lawrence\nand Gertrude Bell (1868-1926), the writer and traveler who had assumed a position as a\nkey administrator in Iraq. Tasked with resolving the problems that Britain had\nexperienced in its Middle Eastern mandates, the attendees would make a series of\nimportant decisions that would have momentous long-term consequences for the\nregion.71\nThe conference first dealt with the situation in Iraq. Wracked by a costly\ninsurgency in the countryside and by seething opposition in the cities, it was the most\ntroubled part of Britain\u2019s Middle Eastern empire in 1921. After vigorous debate, the\nattendees determined that they could best ensure the mandate\u2019s long-term stability by\nshifting to a system of indirect rule\u2014one that they believed would be more acceptable to\nthe territory\u2019s Arab majority. Accordingly, in August 1921, they arranged for the now-\nunemployed and unhappy Faysal to become the king of Iraq. In Churchill\u2019s eyes, it was\na savvy solution that neatly killed two birds with one stone: it both promised to reduce\nunrest among urban Iraqis and made good London\u2019s failure to adhere to the McMahon-\nHusayn Correspondence\u2014thus helping to restore Britain\u2019s battered diplomatic\nreputation.72\nWhat it did not do, however, was address the urgent problem posed by the need\nto contain costs. How, the attendees debated, could London maintain control of Iraq\u2019s\nvast rural areas in a way that was consistent with its determination to drastically pare\nback government expenditures? For Churchill, technology and brute force provided a\nway out of this conundrum. That is, Britain would uphold order and internal stability in\nIraq by using airpower to coerce obedience. Cheap and powerful, airplanes could,\nthrough the threat of bombing, compel the seemingly ungovernable rural tribes to pay\nthe taxes that would make the mandate financially self-sustaining\u2014thus relieving Britain\nof the cost of administering it.73\nHaving arrived at a solution for Iraq, the conferees next addressed the problems\nof Palestine. Here, London faced a series of peculiarly challenging tasks. It needed to\nend communal violence between Palestinian Arabs and Jewish immigrants, reconcile\nthe conflicting promises it had made in the Balfour Declaration and the McMahon-\nHusayn Correspondence, satisfactorily dispose of Transjordan, which Faysal had ruled\nas part of Syria until July 1920, and, lastly, prevent Abdallah\u2019s presence in Transjordan\nfrom embroiling Britain in a conflict with France. After lengthy debates, the attendees\nconcluded that they could neatly resolve all of these issues through a combination of\nSolomonic division and the appeasement of the Hashimites. Implemented in 1922, this\n71 Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948,\n112.\n72 Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 503\u20134.\n73 Catherwood, Churchill\u2019s Folly, 129\u201338. Chapter Ten: \u201cA Peace to End All Peace,\u201d 1916-1923 Page 306\nnew approach involved two steps. First, it split the mandate of Palestine along the\nJordan River and declared that Transjordan would not be subject to the Balfour\nDeclaration. Second, it established a system of indirect rule in that territory by installing\nAbdallah as Transjordan\u2019s nominal ruler.74\nChurchill was delighted with this solution. In his view, it deftly resolved all of the\nproblems that had emerged in Palestine in 1920. By creating an explicitly Arab state\nthrough the division of the mandate, it would ease Arab opposition to Zionism and would\nthus end the resentment that had fueled the riot in Jerusalem in 1920. By making\nAbdallah the ruler of Transjordan, it would dissuade the emir from dragging Britain into a\npotentially costly conflict with France. Above all, by splitting the mandate of Palestine,\nhis plan would, in his eyes, reconcile the commitment Britain had made in the\nMcMahon-Husayn Correspondence to foster the creation of Hashimite states with the\npromise it had expressed in the Balfour Declaration to oversee the establishment of a\nJewish homeland in Palestine and would thus allow Britain to meet all of the obligations\nit had made during the war. In hindsight, of course, it achieved only the second and third\nof these aims. That is, while the conference\u2019s plan did ease Hashimite frustration with\nLondon and did permit Britain to claim that it had stood by its word, it proved utterly\nincapable of resolving either the competition between the Zionists and the Arab\npopulation of Palestine or, more broadly, the contradiction inherent in the Balfour\nDeclaration\u2019s pledge to create a Jewish homeland while simultaneously respecting the\nrights of non-Jewish people in the mandate. Churchill was blind to these shortcomings,\nhowever, and genuinely believed that he had resolved in Cairo the issues that had\nbedeviled mandatory Palestine.75\nThus, at the conclusion of the conference, Churchill felt that he had put Britain\u2019s\npolicy toward the Middle East mandates back on track. Indeed, he was quite pleased\nwith his work. In conjunction with the renegotiation of the Sykes-Picot Agreement that\nhad earlier taken place at the San Remo Conference, he believed that his\nreorganization of the terms of the mandates in Palestine and Iraq had finally reconciled\nthe contradictory promises that Britain had made in its wartime agreements regarding\nthe Middle East and had thus restored its tarnished diplomatic reputation. All the\nrelevant parties had to make compromises, he acknowledged, but each also received\nessentially what Britain had promised them. Meanwhile, by shifting to a system of\nindirect, Hashimite rule in Transjordan and Iraq\u2014the so-called \u201cSherifian Solution\u201d\u2014and\nby relying on the threat of bombing villages in Iraq to uphold order, he was confident\nthat he had devised a way to ease the expense of empire to the point that Britain would\nbe able to retain possession of its new and strategically valuable Arab territories at an\nacceptable cost. Unaware of the conference\u2019s genuine shortcomings, in sum, Churchill\n74 Eugene L.

It had been no simple task. From nearly the start of his tenure as high\ncommissioner, Allenby had sought to end the unrest in the protectorate by negotiating a\ntreaty of independence with representatives from the Wafd Party. Unfortunately, despite\nthe fact that both sides agreed that the talks should end with Egypt becoming\nindependent, the discussions quickly deadlocked. The primary issue preventing an\nagreement was of the Suez Canal. London remained adamant that the final agreement\npermit it to maintain a permanent military presence in the canal zone; Zaghul and the\nWafd Party were equally determined to end the occupation altogether. As a result, the\ntwo sides could not make meaningful progress toward an agreement and the unrest that\nhad started in 1919 continued to grind on.77\nAllenby finally broke the impasse in February 1922. Unable to stabilize the\nsituation in Egypt through negotiations, he resolved it by issuing the Unilateral\nDeclaration of Egyptian Independence. It promised the quick termination of martial law\nand formally ended the protectorate\u2014thereby making Egypt an independent state.\nHowever, the independence that Egypt acquired was incomplete thanks to a series of\ncolonialist qualifications that Allenby included in his declaration. Known as the four\n\u201cReserved Points,\u201d these conditions retained for Britain control of the Suez Canal,\nresponsibility for Egypt\u2019s defense, the authority to protect the interests of foreigners and\nminorities in the country, and, finally, the administration of Sudan\u2014which Egypt and\nBritain had held in condominium since 1882.78\nAllenby\u2019s declaration met with a mixed reception among Egypt\u2019s increasingly\nnationalist-minded people. They were thrilled that their country had achieved\nindependence, of course, but they were equally bitter in their resentment of the\nReserved Points\u2014provisions that, in their view, had merely transformed Egypt into a\nsubtler kind of protectorate. This criticism had merit. While Allenby\u2019s statement certainly\nmarked the passing of an important milestone for Egypt on its march to full\nindependence, it also ensured that Britain would continue to dominate their country for\nanother generation.79\n76 Quote from Rogan, The Arabs, 183; Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace, 528\u201329.\n77 M W Daly, \u201cThe British Occupation, 1882-1922,\u201d in The Cambridge History of Egypt.\nVolume 2, Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the End of the Twentieth Century, ed.

By meeting\nEgypt\u2019s minimal demands, Allenby had succeeded in taking the air out of the protest\nmovement that had threatened Britain\u2019s position in the country. Thereafter, while the\nEgyptians continued to seethe with resentment, they no longer engaged in the civil\ndisobedience and mass protest that had threatened to undermine Britain\u2019s position in\nEgypt and, more critically, its continued control of the Suez Canal.80\nConclusion\nWith the situation in Egypt having finally reached a resolution, the Settlement of\n1922 was complete, and, with it, the broad outlines of the modern Middle East had\ntaken form. Politically, it was a vastly different region than it had been at the start of\nWorld War I. The Allies had crushed the Ottoman Empire in the conflict and, in so doing,\nappeared to have finally resolved the \u201cEastern Question.\u201d Meanwhile, the process of\nimperial aggrandizement, resistance, negotiation, and accommodation that occurred in\nthe years immediately after the war had resulted in the division of the region into a\nseries of nation-states\u2014albeit ones that were, in nearly all cases, de facto colonies of\nFrance or Britain. Those states still exist today; likewise, with some notable exceptions,\nthe frontiers that the victors drew in the early 1920s continue to divide the modern\nMiddle East.\nThis new state system would not prove to be a stable one, however. The French\nand British had chosen leaders, drawn up borders, and created political structures\nbased on a mix of self-interest and ignorance; as a consequence, most of the\ngovernments that emerged in the region either lacked legitimacy with their people or\ncontrolled territory to which, in whole or in part, other states staked claims. Indeed,\ndirectly or indirectly, the contested peace settlement that followed the First World War\ngave birth to nearly all of the modern Middle East\u2019s major geopolitical issues including,\nmost notably, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Kurdish demands for an independent\ncountry, instability in Lebanon, and the weakness of the Iraqi state. This is not to deny\nagency to the people of the Middle East; after all, as we have seen, regional actors\nplayed a part in shaping the outcome of the settlement of 1922. Rather, it is to make\nclear the degree to which the negotiated peace reflected the imbalance in power\nbetween the indigenous parties and the imperialist states in the early 1920s. Indeed,\neven those Middle Eastern countries that had managed to remain independent after the\nsettlement of 1922 found themselves compelled to walk a careful line vis-\u00e0-vis the Great\nPowers during the interwar era. It is to their development during that period and their\nefforts to remain free from Western dominance that we shall now turn.\n80 Gifford, 180. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948\nAs we saw in chapter ten, most of the Middle East came under direct European\nrule following the Settlement of 1922. However, three of the region\u2019s states\u2014Saudi\nArabia, Iran, and Turkey\u2014managed to retain their independence. Among the small\nnumber of non-Western countries to avoid direct imperial control during the interwar era,\nthese states were able to autonomously develop their political institutions, economies,\nand societies.\nStill, all three found the period between the end of World War I and the\nconclusion of World War II to be a challenging one during which they had only mixed\nsuccess in maneuvering through the treacherous waters of the Western-dominated,\ninterwar Middle East. Of the three, Iran was by far the least successful. It failed to\ndevelop either a strong, modern economy or a political system that enjoyed close\nconnections to the people; worse, it ended up coming under Allied military occupation\nduring World War II. Saudi Arabia fared better thanks to its military power and its\npossession of substantial oil reserves but still chafed at British dominance of the region.\nTurkey was a different story. In contrast to Saudi Arabia and Iran, it appeared to enjoy\ngenuine independence and, for a time, seemed to have blazed a path that other states\ncould follow to achieve autonomy and industrialization. Yet even Turkey had to walk a\nvery careful line to avoid foreign domination during the Second World War.\nTurkey: Independence and Cultural Revolution\nDuring the interwar period, Turkey was widely considered to be one of the\nworld\u2019s great success stories. Its leaders had skillfully navigated the collapse of the\nOttoman Empire, secured independence, and modernized both the economy and the\npolitical system. More dramatically, they had launched a far-reaching, top-down cultural\nrevolution that had succeeded in effecting a radical restructuring of Turkish society and\nidentity. Indeed, under its powerful president, Kemal Mustafa (r. 1923-1938), Turkey\nappeared to have successfully undergone a nearly unprecedented nation-building\ncampaign that had fundamentally remade the predominantly Turkish part of the\nOttoman Empire into a new nation-state replete with a new Turkish identity to replace\nthe old Ottoman one. The regime\u2019s reform program was so successful, in fact, that it\ncame to constitute an influential model that other independent, non-European states\nwould embrace during the interwar period and that many newly decolonized African,\nAsian, and Middle Eastern states would adopt following World War II.\nTurkey in 1923\nHaving been involved in war almost continuously since 1911, Turkey found itself\nin a difficult position following the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne in July 1923.\nDemographic and economic evidence make plain the degree to which a decade of\nintense conflict had affected the country. The fighting, ethnic cleansing, war-induced\nfamine, and genocide had combined to shrink the population of Turkey from an Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 310\nestimated 16.3 million people in 1914 to only 13.6 million at the time of its first census in\n1927\u2014a staggering 17 percent drop. The population was not only much smaller, but\nalso far-more ethnically homogenous. Thanks to the departure of more than one-million\nGreek refugees between 1912 and 1923 and the genocide of between 800,000 and\n1,000,000 Armenians between 1915 and 1918, Turkey emerged from the wreckage of\nthe Ottoman Empire an overwhelmingly Turkish-Muslim state that had only one\nsubstantial minority, the Sunni Kurds, who accounted for about 20 percent of the\npopulation. Economically, the country\u2019s situation following the Treaty of Lausanne was\nsimilarly dismal. The strain of more than a decade of continuous warfare, the loss of the\ncomparatively entrepreneurial Greeks and Armenians who had dominated the\ncommercial economy, and the establishment of new borders that disrupted longstanding\ntrade relations left the country with a severely depressed economy.1\nConsolidating Power, 1923-1927\nPerhaps unsurprisingly given Turkey\u2019s difficult circumstances, the leadership of\nthe resistance movement that had secured independence began to fracture immediately\nfollowing the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne. The primary fault line was not, at\nleast initially, ideological or economic in nature; instead, it centered on the amount of\npower that President Kemal Mustafa would wield in the new government. In this\nstruggle, the Turkish president would win a substantial victory. As savvy a political\noperator as he was a military commander, he deftly handled the challenge to his\nauthority that emerged following Turkey\u2019s diplomatic victory in Lausanne by leveraging\nhis status as the main hero of the war for independence to outmaneuver and swiftly\nneuter the opposition. In the process, he succeeded in transforming Turkey into an\nautocratic, one-party state under his tight control.\nLatent opposition to Kemal Mustafa had long existed in the national\nindependence movement, but it only took concrete form following the nationalists\u2019\nvictory. It did so in response to two acts that he successfully forced through parliament\nin late 1923 and early 1924. First, to foreclose a possible restoration of the sultanate, he\nexploited his control of the newly created Republican People\u2019s Party (RPP) to secure\npassage of a law in October 1923 declaring Turkey a republic. He followed by\npersuading the legislature to formally abolish the caliphate in March 1924 and to adopt\na new, republican constitution the following month\u2014moves that ensured that Turkey\nwould be a secular rather than religious state.2\nMany in the independence movement found these actions deeply troubling.\nHoping that Turkey would retain a Sunni Muslim identity, conservatives were furious\nthat Kemal Mustafa had orchestrated the abolition of the caliphate. For their part, many\npolitically moderate veterans of the independence effort shared the president\u2019s belief\nthat Turkey had to become a republic and abolish the caliphate if it wished to emerge as\n1 Douglas A. Howard, The History of Turkey (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2001),\n99.\n2 Ahmad Feroz, The Making of Modern Turkey (New York: Routledge, 1993), 53\u201356. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 311\na modern nation-state, but they found his heavy-handed parliamentary tactics troubling\nand feared that he was acting less to advance Turkey\u2019s interests than to consolidate\nauthority in his hands. In response, they moved to form a new political party, the\nProgressive Republican Party (PRP), in November 1924. A typical, European-style\nsecular-nationalist party, the PRP promoted a moderate, decentralized, and democratic\npolitical vision as an alternative to the RPP\u2019s autocratic and more revolutionary\napproach. It quickly won a substantial following among the public.3\nBridling at the growing popularity of the PRP, Kemal Mustafa and his\nsupporters\u2014known as Kemalists\u2014schemed to undermine the moderates\u2019 challenge. A\nKurdish rebellion that broke out in southeastern Turkey gave them just the pretext they\nwere seeking. The revolt was the product of Kurdish anger about the recent changes\nthe RPP had effected. Concerned that Kemal Mustafa\u2019s promotion of Turkish\nnationalism and secularism would render them second-class citizens, the Kurds rose up\nin revolt in February 1925 under the leadership of the charismatic dervish leader\nShaykh Sait (1865-1925). The rebels enjoyed a few early successes but ultimately\ncould not stand up to Kemal Mustafa\u2019s hardened troops. By late spring, as a result, the\ngovernment had suppressed the rebellion.4\nThe Turkish president and his supporters wasted little time in using the rebellion\nto move against their political enemies in the PRP. At Kemal Mustafa\u2019s request, the\nGrand National Assembly passed the Law on the Maintenance of Order in March 1925;\nbroad in scope, it gave the government sweeping powers to muzzle the press and to\nban organizations that threatened to undermine law and order. Though they had\njustified the law as necessary for the suppression of the Shaykh Sait revolt, the\nKemalists quickly exploited it to crush their political rivals. They permanently shuttered\nall independent national newspapers, abolished the PRP, and arrested 7,500 prominent\nopponents of the RPP\u2019s secularizing program\u2014660 of whom the government promptly\nexecuted.5\nA failed assassination attempt against the president in June 1926 gave the\nKemalists the chance they needed to finish off their political opponents. Once again\nmaking liberal use of the Law on the Maintenance of Order, they first arrested all\nprominent members of the PRP and then held a series of show trials aimed at\ndiscrediting those among the party\u2019s leadership who possessed sufficient popular\nappeal to challenge Mustafa Kemal. Though discontent in the army compelled the\nKemalists to eventually release the many PRP leaders who had served prominently in\nthe national resistance struggle, the tribunals had the desired effect: they ended all\n3 Erik J.

Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 2010), 251.\n5 Howard, The History of Turkey, 95. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 312\norganized political opposition to Kemal Mustafa and his platform. Thereafter, the Turkish\npresident ruled without restraint.6\nKemal Mustafa capped his consolidation of power with a multi-day address to the\nRPP\u2019s Second Congress in October 1927. Known as the Nutuk, or the Speech, its\npurported aim was to outline the history of the national resistance movement and the\nearly republic. In fact, its goal was to rewrite the past in order to justify the recent purges\nand to rationalize continued Kemalist dominance of Turkey. Casting most other leaders\nof the independence movement as either feckless or traitorous, the Speech presented\nwhat came to constitute, in the historian Erik Zu\u0308rcher\u2019s words, a Kemal Mustafa-\ncentered, establishment \u201cmaster narrative\u201d of the national resistance struggle and the\nearly years of the republic\u2014one that diminished the role that others had played in the\nnational liberation movement even as it solidified the Turkish president\u2019s status as the\nunassailable leader of the republic.7\nThe Nutuk proved enormously successful. Coming from a figure of such\nprominence, it constituted the starting point for the nationalist history curriculum\nsubsequently taught in Turkish schools. More importantly, it would succeed in\nestablishing the collective historical memory of the Turkish War for Independence that\nwould dominate understandings of the nationalist movement for the next two\ngenerations\u2014an interpretation that would transform Kemal Mustafa from the\nmovement\u2019s leading figure into the very personification of the struggle itself. Thereafter,\naccounts of the war for independence would center almost exclusively on the role that\nhe played in leading the nationalist effort and would downplay or outright erased the\noften-substantial contributions of other leaders. The Nutuk thus eviscerated the\norganized political opposition, led, as it was, by prominent veterans of the independence\nmovement, and ensured that Kemal Mustafa and the RPP would retain total dominance\nof the Turkish government. Indeed, save for a brief period in 1930, Turkey would remain\nan autocratic, one-party state through the end of World War II. 8\nThe Reforms of the 1920s\nThe president\u2019s total political dominance of Turkey permitted him and his\nsupporters to launch a far-reaching reform program in the 1920s. It constituted nothing\nless than a top-down cultural revolution. Focused on modernizing and, especially\nsecularizing Turkey, it would, in a remarkably short period of time, sweep away\ncenturies of established practices, mores, and social structures.\nThe reform program began with a bang in 1924. That year, the government\nasserted state control of religion by shuttering the madrasas, taking control of\neducation, closing the shari\u02bfa courts, abolishing the office of sheikh u\u0308l-Islam, and\n6 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 251.\n7 Erik J.

Tauris, 2010), 6\u201316.\n8 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 257. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 313\nestablishing a Directorate of Religious Affairs. It followed the next year by shutting down\nthe Sufi dervish convents, by strongly discouraging women from veiling, and by banning\nthe fez\u2014the hat, ironically, that Sultan Mahmud II (r. 1808-1839) had introduced in the\n1820s as part of an earlier reform effort. The pace did not let up in 1926. That year, the\ngovernment switched Turkey to the twenty-four-hour international clock and required\npeople to abandon the Islamic calendar in favor of the Western Gregorian one. It also\nadopted a new legal system, the Swiss Civil Code, that outlawed polygamy and formally\nended \u02bfulama\u02be control of family law. The state continued the secularization and\nmodernization drive in 1928 by making the use of European (Arab) numerals mandatory\nand by removing the clause from the constitution that declared that Islam was the\nreligion of the republic.9\nThat same year, Kemal announced what was perhaps the most far-reaching\nreform yet implemented. On August 9, 1928, he declared that Turkey would replace the\ntraditional Ottoman Arabic-Persian script with a modified version of the Latin alphabet.\nConsisting of twenty-nine-letters, the new writing system was more streamlined and\nbetter suited to spoken Turkish than the written Arabic of the Ottoman era. Since it was\neasier to learn, it also promised to provide a quick boost to Turkey\u2019s comparatively\nanemic literacy rate. The Kemalists wasted little time in putting it into effect. Passed on\nNovember 1, 1928, the law mandated that the new script would be compulsory for all\npublications effective January 1, 1929. Thus, the regime gave literate Turks the\nunenviable task of learning to read and write a new, and very-foreign alphabet in just\ntwo months!10\nWhy did Kemal Mustafa and his supporters pursue so many sweeping reforms so\nquickly? They did so because they believed that they needed to shock the Turkish\npeople into a complete reconstruction of their identity if their country were to truly\nmodernize. By compelling Turks to live according to the Western calendar and the\ninternational clock, by making them adopt European modes of dress, and, especially, by\nforcing them to communicate using the Latin script, the Kemalists aimed to reorient their\ncountry away from its Islamic and Ottoman past and toward the dynamic, modern, and\npowerful societies of Europe. In the process, they believed, the Turkish people would\nundergo the fundamental mental remapping and thoroughgoing change in identity that\nthe Kemalists believed had to occur if their country was to assume its rightful place\namong the forward-looking, modern states of the world.11\nUnsurprisingly, given these aims, support for the secularization program was far\nfrom universal. While the reforms were popular with town and city residents\u2014especially\nthose who belonged to the professional, business, and military classes\u2014they generated\nsubstantial resistance among the more conservative urban craftspeople and, especially,\namong the peasantry of rural Anatolia. Perhaps surprisingly, those groups raised few\n9 M. \u015eu\u0308kru\u0308 Hanio\u011flu, Atat\u00fcrk: An Intellectual Biography (Princeton: Princeton University\nPress, 2011), 155\u201359, 209, 214\u201318.\n10 Feroz, The Making of Modern Turkey, 80\u201381.\n11 Howard, The History of Turkey, 98\u201399. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 314\nobjections to the abolition of formal religious institutions such as the caliphate, the\nsheikh u\u0308l-Islam, or the madrasas. Instead, it was the extension of the secularization\nprogram to popular religious and cultural practices such as wearing the fez or\nundertaking pilgrimages to saints\u2019 tombs that fueled their resentment. As we shall see in\nchapter sixteen, their discontent would gradually deepen until, to the shock of the\nKemalists, it spurred the emergence of a populist Islamic opposition movement after\nWorld War II.12\nKemalism\nHaving solidified their control of the state and implemented the first phase of their\nreform program, Kemal and his supporters next moved to formally articulate their\ngoverning philosophy. They did so in the RPP party platform of 1931, which laid out the\nso-called Six Arrows\u2014republicanism, secularism, nationalism, populism, revolutionism,\nand etatism\u2014that were the guiding principles of Kemalism. The first, republicanism,\ncalled for sovereignty to emanate from the people rather than from a monarch\u2014though\nthe fact that the Kemalist state was, at root, a fundamentally undemocratic one\nsuggests that the RPP\u2019s embrace of representative government was more theoretical\nthan real. The second arrow, secularism, was, as we have seen, the guiding principle of\nthe reforms of the 1920s. The third, nationalism and the effort to construct a new\nTurkish identity would in turn dominate the reforms of the 1930s. The fourth, populism,\nwent hand in hand with nationalism. It stressed collective solidarity, called for putting the\nnation ahead of group or individual interests, and denied both the existence of class\nconflict in Turkey and, by extension, the need for class-based political parties.13\nWhile the first four arrows enjoyed overwhelming support within the RPP, the\nremaining two, Etatism and Inkilap\u00e7ilik, or revolutionism, were more controversial. The\nprinciple of revolutionism, which called for the embrace of ongoing change in support of\nKemalism, troubled the capitalists and landlords who dominated the party\u2019s\nconservative wing. Worried that it might result in Turkey entering a disruptive state of\npermanent revolution, they responded by choosing to interpret Inkilap\u00e7ilik as a call not\nfor revolution but instead for reform. Etatism, the statist economic doctrine that the party\nadopted at its Third Conference, proved similarly unpopular with the RPP\u2019s conservative\nfactions. Their opposition to it was grounded in three fears: that large-scale state\nintervention in the economy would be inefficient, that it would almost inevitably depress\neconomic growth, and, predictably, that it would threaten their financial interests.14\nKemalist Economic Policies\nAdvocates of etatism were able to overcome these objections thanks to the\nfailings of the more conventional economic policies that Turkey had pursued during the\n1920s. With the nation\u2019s economy having fallen into ruin in the wake of the war for\n12 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 191\u201392.\n13 Z\u00fcrcher, 181\u201382.\n14 Feroz, The Making of Modern Turkey, 63\u201364. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 315\nindependence and with the Treaty of Lausanne having barred the government from\nraising tariff rates until 1929, the Kemalists had been compelled in the early 1920s to\nadopt a fairly conventional economic-development policy that relied primarily on private\nactors and the market to drive growth.15\nThe stunning, Great Depression-induced decline in international trade that began\nin 1929 compelled Turkey to rethink its economic-development strategy. The crisis\ncame on with great suddenness. Following the crash of the American stock market in\nOctober 1929, demand for primary products\u2014particularly for wheat, the mainstay of the\ncountry\u2019s exports\u2014evaporated. The result was something of a perfect storm for Turkey.\nNot only did the staggering, two-thirds drop in wheat prices immiserate the peasant\nclass that was dependent on the export market, but it also left the country unable to\nearn the foreign currency that its industrialists and merchants needed to purchase\nimported capital equipment.16\nThe crisis produced a sharp debate within governing circles in 1931. Arguing that\na free-market system would generate higher growth rates, some remained committed to\na liberal-capitalist system such as existed in Britain or France. Others, including Prime\nminister and future president, Ismet Inonu (r. 1938-1950), countered that a market-\nbased system could not resolve the economic crisis and maintained that Turkey could\nbest deal with the Great Depression by adopting a centralized, state-directed, etatist\neconomic system. The debate did not last long. The combination of the democratic-\ncapitalist world\u2019s inability to achieve a speedy economic recovery and the Soviet\nUnion\u2019s tremendous growth in heavy industries during the First Five Year Plan (1928-\n1932) tipped the balance in favor of those who championed a state-led, economic order.\nAs a result, the Turkish government abandoned its earlier laissez-faire approach in\n1931 in favor of etatism.17\nThe new economic program centered on three components: the promotion of\nImport Substitution Industrialization (ISI), direct state involvement in the economy, and\ncentral planning. The adoption of Import Substitution Industrialization\u2014a policy wherein\na developing state seeks to foster domestic industries by insulating them from foreign\ncompetition\u2014was to a substantial degree a case of making a virtue of necessity. With\nthe prices of the commodities that Turkey produced having fallen far more than the cost\nof the finished goods that it imported, the government could only meet the demand for\nmany heretofore imported products by ensuring that domestic enterprises manufactured\nthem. It did so by raising tariffs precipitously and by subsidizing domestic producers\u2014\nthe latter beginning with companies that manufactured the so-called \u201c\u2018three whites,\u2019\u201d\nclothing, sugar, and flour.18\n15 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 271; Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 195\u201397.\n16 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 196\u201397.\n17 Z\u00fcrcher, 197.\n18 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 273\u201374. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 316\nMeanwhile, at the same time that it was nurturing domestic producers, the\nTurkish government was simultaneously shifting to a system of direct, state involvement\nin the economy and laying the groundwork for central planning. The expansion of state\neconomic activity came first. Focusing on heavy industries, the government established\ntwo holding companies to oversee its investments: the Sumerbank, which managed\ndevelopments in the manufacturing sector, and the Etibank, which promoted mining.\nWell capitalized, they produced a substantial increase in the state\u2019s share of economic\nactivity over the course of the 1930s. Central direction of the economy quickly followed.\nWith Soviet technical assistance, the government launched Turkey\u2019s first Five Year Plan\nin 1933 to coordinate state and private investment\u2014a move that further strengthened\nthe government\u2019s control of economic activity.19\nDespite these efforts, the Kemalist program produced, at best, mixed results. To\nbe sure, Turkey\u2019s statist approach to the economy did enjoy genuine success in the\n1930s. Etatism resulted in Turkey\u2019s GDP rising by an average of 7 percent in the late\n1930s, and it certainly furthered the Kemalists\u2019 efforts to cultivate a modest industrial\nsector. Its ability to ameliorate the worst aspects of the Great Depression also likely\nhelped the country avoid the descent into regime change and outright dictatorship that\nthe economic crisis had produced in much of Latin America and Europe.20\nAt the same time, however, the RPP\u2019s statist policies failed to live up to the\nfavorable press they received. Turkey\u2019s economic performance during the early years of\netatism was strong, but, coming at a time of broad, global economic recovery, it was\nhardly unusual. Meanwhile, the ISI model of development would prove incapable of\nsustaining economic growth in the long term. The problem was one of incentives. By\nprotecting domestic industries, the ISI development model created opportunities for\npatronage, corruption, and waste and discouraged efforts to control costs. As a result,\nafter World War II, Turkey would find itself falling further-and-further behind states such\nas Japan that had instead opted to follow an Export Oriented Industrialization (EOI)\nstrategy that focused on exploiting their comparative advantages to produce goods that\nwere competitive on global markets.21\nThe Reforms of the 1930s\nConcurrent with the shift to etatism in the early 1930s, the Kemalists launched\nthe second phase of their cultural revolution. It began where the reform program of the\n1920s had left off: with an effort to sever the link between Turkish and the other\nlanguages of the Middle East. Building on the adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1929,\nKemal and his supporters moved in the early 1930s to purge the language of its many\nArab and Persian loanwords in order to emphasize the break with Turkey\u2019s Muslim and\nOttoman past. To do so, they founded the Turkish Language Society in 1932 and\ntasked it with replacing foreign expressions with neologisms, archaic terms, or words\n19 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 197\u201398.\n20 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 274\u201376.\n21 Findley, 274\u201376. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 317\nderived from Turkish dialects. This campaign met with resistance initially but ultimately\nproved successful. Indeed, thanks to the efforts of the Turkish Language Society,\nmodern Turkish is so different from that spoken during the late Ottoman Empire or even\nthe early republic that the Nutuk is nearly as indecipherable to Turkish people today as\nChaucer is to twenty-first century Americans.22\nKemal Mustafa\u2019s interest in the Turkish language went much further than merely\nseeking to purge it of Arab and Persian words, however. He also sought to enlist\nmodern linguistic studies in support of a larger effort to imbue the Turks with a triumphal\nnarrative that both further distanced them from their Ottoman and Islamic past and\nrendered them the cultural equals of Western peoples. The Turkish president struck\ngold in this effort in 1935. That year, he became acquainted with the Sun Language\nTheory, a pseudoscientific linguistic hypothesis developed by a little-known Austrian\nacademic named Hermann Kvergic. It held that the proto-Turkish of the early Turks of\nCentral Asia was the first spoken language and that all subsequent languages evolved\nfrom it. In other words, Kvergic was arguing that Turkish was the mother tongue of all\npeoples and that it was the Turks who had invented spoken language.23\nKemal Mustafa was quick to grasp the benefits that the Sun Language Theory\noffered in support of his effort to ideologically reconstruct Turkish society. Not only did it\ngive the Turks a glorious past that was wholly separate from and far older than their\ntime as Ottoman subjects or even their history as Muslims, but, in arguing that the\nTurkish people invented something as foundational as the spoken word, it also gave\nthem a cultural and intellectual cachet that even the Europeans could not match.\nUnsurprisingly, the Kemalists enthusiastically threw their support behind the Sun\nLanguage Theory. They required university faculty to embed it in their teaching and\nresearch, made it a core component of the curriculum in primary education, and\nlavished funds on efforts by the Turkish Language Society to promote it.24\nAlong with linguistics, the Kemalists also recruited the field of history in their\neffort to create a new Turkish national identity. Keenly grasping history\u2019s ability to shape\ncontemporary perceptions of identity, Kemal Mustafa established the Turkish Historical\nSociety in 1931 and tasked it with creating a suitably glorious nationalist past for the\nrepublic. This initiative began to bear fruit the following year with the development of the\nTurkish Historical Thesis. A work of nationalist pseudohistory, it asserted that the\nTurkish people were a branch of the Caucasian race and the founders of the first\nsophisticated civilization. Later, facing periodic drought in their Central Asian homeland,\nthey had migrated outward in a series of waves that brought civilization to the peoples\nof China, Greece, India, and Egypt. In other words, the Turkish Historical Thesis\n22 Howard, The History of Turkey, 190.\n23 Hanio\u011flu, Atat\u00fcrk, 173\u201380.\n24 Hanio\u011flu, 173\u201380. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 318\nasserted that that the Turks were not just the originators of civilization, but also the\nfounders of what were regarded as the world\u2019s greatest and most influential cultures.25\nLike the Sun Language Theory, the Turkish Historical Thesis proved central to\nthe Kemalists\u2019 effort to construct a new, modern Turkish national identity. It did so in two\nways. First, by establishing that the Turkish people were Caucasian at a time when\nEugenics, Social Darwinism, and racism enjoyed broad acceptance, it linked Turkey to\nthe modern West and accorded it a high place in both formal and informal racial\nhierarchies. Second, by giving the Turks an heroic past that stretched far back in time, it\nfurthered the goal of creating an identity that was distinct from the older Ottoman and\nMuslim ones to which many still clung. Placing great stock in these ideological benefits,\nthe state aggressively promoted the Turkish Historical Thesis and made it the backbone\nof the history curriculum in both universities and primary schools. They also celebrated\nit through official propaganda. For example, the development banks that the Kemalists\nhad set up\u2014the Etibank and Sumerbank\u2014were named for two of the groups that the\nTurkish Historical Thesis claimed were among the first to leave Central Asia: the Hittites\nand Sumerians.26\nMeanwhile, the Kemalists also moved in the 1930s to bring Turkey in alignment\nwith the Western European states by legally and socially emancipating women.\nScholars refer to this top-down program of reform as \u201cstate feminism.\u201d It involved the\npromotion of female education, the revision of laws that had restricted women\u2019s\nemployment, and the encouragement of activities such as ballroom dancing and beauty\ncontests that broke with traditional Turkish gender norms. It also granted women the\nright to vote in municipal elections in 1930 and in national ones in 1934, meaning that\nTurkish women had the franchise before their counterparts in purportedly more-modern\nWestern nations such as France and Switzerland. The Kemalist program of state\nfeminism even abolished laws that had banned women from running for parliament\u2014as\nseventeen women successfully did in 1935\u2014and opened the door for many urban\nmiddle-class women to go into professions such as medicine, teaching, architecture,\nand the civil service. These were important achievements, and they initiated a genuine\nprocess of change in Turkey.27\nUnsurprisingly, however, the gains that Turkish women secured in the 1930s\nwere largely cosmetic. Like many of his supporters, Kemal Mustafa was personally quite\nconservative regarding gender issues and promoted women\u2019s empowerment less to\nimprove their position in Turkish society than to support propaganda efforts designed to\nreinforce Turkey\u2019s new image as a modern, Western state. Meanwhile, in rural areas,\nmen and women alike clung tenaciously to traditional gender norms and resisted the\n25 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 190\u201391.\n26 Hanio\u011flu, Atat\u00fcrk, 163\u201368; Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 191.\n27 Nikki R. Keddie, Women in the Middle East: Past and Present (Princeton: Princeton\nUniversity Press, 2012), 77\u201382. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 319\nnew laws and social mores. As a result, while the position of women in Turkish society\nchanged, it did so very slowly.28\nFinally, the reform program of the 1930s changed how people referred to one\nanother through the Surname Law of 1934. It had two provisions. First, it banned the\nuse of venerable, but-still-popular Turkish and Ottoman noble titles such as effendi and\nbey that the Kemalists viewed as old fashioned and outmoded. Second, and more far\nreaching, it broke with the traditional Muslim custom of having only a first name by\nmandating that all Turks had to adopt a Western-style family name. The law was a key\npart of the Kemalist cultural revolution. It not only further updated the nation\u2019s image\nand strengthened its symbolic links with the West but, by requiring people to take a\nTurkish rather than an Arabic or Persian name, further solidified the emerging Turkish\nidentity that the Kemalists had championed at the expense of older Ottoman and\nMuslim ones. Kemal Mustafa set the tone by choosing the name Ataturk, or \u201cfather of\nthe Turks.\u201d29\nThe Surname Law capped what had been a sweeping, decade-long top-down\nsocial transformation of Turkey. The changes had been enormous. The adoption of\nfamily names and the embrace of state feminism had eroded traditional, Ottoman era\nsocial practices and had given Turkey the more-modern image that the Kemalists\nsought. Meanwhile, the Sun Language Theory and the Turkish Historical Thesis had\nhelped both to institutionalize the new, Turkish identity that Ataturk and his allies\nchampioned and to undermine the older, Ottoman and Muslim identities that they\nwished to erase. Finally, the secularization reforms of the 1920s had broken the power\nof the only group with the credibility and influence to oppose the ruling party: the\nreligious scholars. Thus, at the end of the 1930s, the Kemalists could look back with\nsatisfaction on their efforts to remake Turkey and to secure broad acceptance of the\nnew modern, Turkish identity that they viewed as essential to the modernization of their\ncountry.\nThe driving force behind these changes was no longer there to celebrate those\nachievements, however. Afflicted with cirrhosis of the liver, Ataturk had passed away in\n1938 not long after the reform program of the 1930s had come to an end. He may have\ndied, but he was most certainly not forgotten. All-but deified as the RPP\u2019s \u201c\u2018eternal party\nchairman,\u2019\u201d he became in death the embodiment of the Turkish republic and a powerful\nand lasting symbol of secularism and Turkish nationalism. Indeed, Ataturk is so revered\nin Turkey that, to the present day, it remains a crime to defame him.30\n28 Keddie, 77, 81\u201382; Howard, The History of Turkey, 105; Findley, Turkey, Islam,\nNationalism, and Modernity, 278\u201379.\n29 Howard, The History of Turkey, 105\u20136; Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and\nModernity, 253.\n30 Feroz, The Making of Modern Turkey, 69\u201370. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 320\nIsmet Inonu, the Montreux Convention, and World War II\nHe was succeeded by his former prime minister, Ismet Inonu, who would serve\nas president until 1950. That Inonu rose to the presidency was surprising in light of the\nfact that he had become something of a rival to Ataturk during the mid 1930s. Indeed,\nhe was a threat of sufficient scale that Kemal Mustafa had forced him out of his post as\nprime minister in 1937. Despite his fall from the inner circle, however, Inonu\u2019s continued\ncommitment to one-party rule and his determination to see the domestic reforms of the\nSix Arrows carried through to their conclusion favorably impressed the RPP.\nAccordingly, the party selected him the Turkish republic\u2019s second president shortly after\nAtaturk\u2019s death. Ironically, in light of their importance in vaulting him into the presidency,\ndomestic affairs took a back seat during the early part of his tenure. Instead, faced with\nthe existential threat that the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II posed to\nthe republic, Inonu was compelled to focus nearly all of his attention on foreign affairs\nduring the early part of his tenure.31\nEven before Inonu became president, Turkey had taken steps to secure the\ncountry\u2019s territorial integrity and its recently won independence. Concerns about\npossible aggression from Benito Mussolini\u2019s (r. 1922-1945) fascist Italy had precipitated\nthat effort. Worried that the Italian dictator was casting a covetous eye at Turkish\nterritory, Ataturk had sought to bolster Turkish security by proposing a new regime for\nthe Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits to replace the existing one that the Treaty of\nLausanne had established. The resulting agreement, the Montreux Convention of 1936,\nwas a significant diplomatic victory for Turkey. It restored to Ankara the right both to\nmilitarize the straits and to close them to foreign warships when it believed that Turkey\nconfronted the \u201c\u2018imminent danger of war.\u2019\u201d32\nInonu followed Ataturk\u2019s success in regaining control of the straits by managing\nto keep Turkey from becoming drawn into the Second World War. Doing so required\nhim to pursue a careful balancing act. Fearing German and Italian aggression if Turkey\nwere isolated, his government initially tilted towards Paris and London. Shocked by\nAdolph Hitler\u2019s (r. 1933-1945) defeat of France in 1940 and his conquest of the Balkans\nin 1941, however, he subsequently abandoned his close ties with the Allies in favor of a\ntacitly pro-German neutrality. Once the military balance had shifted irrevocably back\ntowards the Allies in 1943, Inonu once again reversed course. Even then, he moved\ncarefully and shrewdly. Most notably, he waited until February 1945 to declare war on\nGermany\u2014early enough to ensure that Turkey would become a charter member of the\nUnited Nations but late enough to guarantee that its participation in the war was pro\nforma and that no Turkish troops would take part in the fighting.33\nInonu ultimately earned mixed marks from the Turkish people regarding his\nhandling of the Second World War. On the one hand, with memories of the disastrous\n31 Feroz, 69\u201370.\n32 Howard, The History of Turkey, 110\u201313.\n33 Howard, 110\u201313. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 321\nconsequences of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s participation in World War I still fresh in their\nminds, many applauded his ability to keep Turkey from becoming embroiled in the\nconflict. On the other, war-induced inflation, severe material shortages, and the brutally\nconfiscatory Capital Tax Law that the government levied disproportionally on non-\nMuslims caused many to lose faith in the RPP. As a result, as the war neared its\nconclusion, support for the Kemalist program slumped badly amid stepped-up demands\nfor political liberalization.34\nThe Turkish Straits Crisis\nInonu\u2019s government faced another serious foreign-policy challenge just after the\nconflict ended\u2014one that bore more than a superficial resemblance to some of the crises\nthe Ottoman Empire had experienced in the nineteenth century. Angry that Turkey had\npermitted German warships to traverse the straits during World War II, Joseph Stalin\n(r. 1924-1953) sought to strongarm Turkey into revising the Montreux Convention to\ngive the USSR joint control of the straits and the right to maintain military bases along\nthem. He also demanded territory along the Black Sea in northeast Anatolia. Given the\nSoviet Union\u2019s enormous military capabilities, Stalin\u2019s threat was a serious one for\nInonu\u2019s government. Turkey did not have to face this renewal of aggression from the\nnorth alone, however. Fearing that Stalin sought control of the straits as a springboard\nfor further aggrandizement, US President Harry Truman (r. 1945-1953) deployed the\nbattleship USS Missouri and the aircraft carrier USS Franklin D. Roosevelt to the region\nas a show of force in 1946. Faced with the superior might of the United States, Stalin\nhad little choice but to back down; as a result, the situation quickly deescalated. Still,\ndespite its quick ending, the straits crisis had a lasting effect on Turkey\u2019s diplomatic\nalignment. Indeed, it marked not merely the start of close ties with the US but also the\nkey event that drove Ankara to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in\n1952.35\nThe Kemalist Legacy\nAs the republic neared its twenty-fifth anniversary in the late 1940s, the\nKemalists could take pride in the changes they had made to Turkey. In less than two\ndecades, they had implemented an innovative and apparently successful economic\nresponse to the Great Depression and had launched a successful cultural revolution\nthat seemed to have achieved a clean break with the immediate Ottoman past. They\nhad also erected a cult of personality around the head of state that turned him in both\nlife and death into a powerful symbol of national unity and had skillfully avoided\nbecoming embroiled in World War II until the fighting was all-but over. Given the extent\nof these achievements, Turkey and the Kemalist program unsurprisingly came to serve\nas a highly influential model of development that many states in Latin America, Asia,\n34 Feroz, The Making of Modern Turkey, 69\u201370.\n35 George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776,\n1 edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 609. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 322\nAfrica, and, notably, the Middle East would adopt in the decades immediately after the\nSecond World War.\nAt the same time, however, keen-eyed observers could detect more than a few\ncracks in the Kemalist fa\u00e7ade. By the end of World War II, the ruling party faced growing\ndiscontent among both urban liberals, who chafed at limits to political expression, and\nrural conservatives, who opposed the RPP\u2019s radical secularization program. Ironically,\nas a result, at the very moment that its international reputation and influence were\npeaking, Kemalism was beginning to confront mounting protests to its domestic\nmonopoly on political power\u2014challenges that would, as we shall see, succeed in\ncompelling the RPP to relinquish the iron grip on political power that it had held since\n1924.\nThe Historical Debate: Modernization Theory\nFrom the founding of the Turkish Republic through the 1960s, a framework called\nmodernization theory dominated interpretations of Turkey\u2019s birth and early development.\nArticulated most clearly by the historian Bernard Lewis in his influential 1961 book, The\nEmergence of Modern Turkey, it held that Turkish modernization was an inevitable\nprocess that began after World War I when the Turkish people rejected their\npreindustrial and undemocratic past in the Islamic and Ottoman worlds in favor of\nmodern, Western-style industrialism and republicanism. Lewis acknowledged that the\nprocess was not entirely smooth. He noted, for example, that a minority of reactionaries\nsuch as rural peasants and, especially, religious leaders resisted these changes. In his\nview, however, these traditionalists constituted only a shrinking minority\u2014dead enders\nfated to melt away as the benefits of modernity spread.36\nLewis\u2019s study proved enormously influential, and it dominated understandings of\nTurkey\u2019s emergence as a modern nation-state for decades. Beginning in the 1970s,\nhowever, a growing number of scholars began to challenge both his interpretation and\nthe broader modernization paradigm. They focus their critiques on two core aspects of\nhis argument. First, they reject his contention that the creation of Turkey was the\ninevitable product of a newly awakened people seeking to free themselves of their\ndecadent Ottoman and Islamic past in favor of modernity; instead, they argue that its\nbirth was a function of historical contingency. That is, nearly everyone who took part in\nthe national resistance did so to perpetuate the Ottoman Empire and the caliphate\nrather than to create a republican nation-state. The move away from the sultanate only\nbecame inevitable, they argue, when Ataturk and a small band of co-conspirators used\ntheir dominant position in the RPP to force through a law in 1923 making Turkey a\nrepublic. Second, they dispute modernization theory\u2019s binary categorization of Turkish\nsociety as either traditional or modern and instead maintain that people then and now\nembrace elements of both. As the historian Erik Z\u00fcrcher notes, for example, the Islamist\nTurkish Welfare Party of the 1980s and 1990s was not simply a reactionary,\n36 Bernard Lewis, The Emergence of Modern Turkey (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n1961), Passim. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 323\nfundamentalist movement, but instead a political organization trying to address\u2014in an\nIslamic context\u2014the problems typical of a modern industrial society.37\nSaudi Arabia and the Gulf: The Emergence of the Oil Economy\nThough it emerged at the same time as the Turkish republic, Saudi Arabia\nfollowed a decidedly different path in its development as a state. Like the original Saudi\nemirate that Muhammad ibn Saud (r. 1726-1765) had founded in the eighteenth\ncentury, the modern kingdom developed out of an alliance between the Saudi family,\nwhich hoped to secure political control of Arabia, and the Wahhabi \u02bfulama\u02be, who sought\nto impose their Salafist interpretation of Islam on the people of the region. Given its\nmodest population and forbidding climate, the Saudi state did not appear likely to be\nanything more than an impoverished and isolated theocracy at the time of its revival in\nthe early twentieth century. Its prospects changed dramatically in 1938, however,\nthanks to the discovery of seemingly limitless oil beneath its heretofore valueless desert\nsands. The result was a paradoxical state\u2014one that would assume an increasingly\ncentral role in the modern global economy even as it enforced adherence to an austere\nreligious movement that focused narrowly on the past.\nIbn Saud\nThat the Saudis emerged as economic kingpins is surprising in light of the\nfamily\u2019s weak position at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1891, the rival Rashidi\nfamily had defeated the Saudi emir, Abdul Rahman bin Faisal (r. 1889-1891), and had\nseized control of Riyadh, the capital of the Emirate of Najd that the Saudis had\nestablished in 1824. Compelled to flee with his family to Kuwait, Abdul Rahman spent\nthe next few years plotting the recovery of the Saudi state. Those plans came to naught.\nDefeated once again by the Rashidis in 1900, the dispirited Saudi leader thereafter\nabandoned all hope of retaking Riyadh and settled into a life in exile.38\nAstonishingly, the dynasty achieved a stunning recovery under Abdul Rahman\u2019s\nson, Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (r. 1902-1953). Broad chested and standing six feet three\ninches in height, the charismatic young Saudi leader was as determined to recover his\npatrimony as he was physically intimidating. A war between the Kuwaitis and the\nRashidis that began in 1901 gave him his chance. Seeking to distract the Rashidis, the\nEmir of Kuwait sent ibn Saud and a small group of his most dedicated followers to\nattack Riyadh in early 1902. Their first assault on the walled city failed badly; however,\ntheir second effort, a bold night attack that concluded with ibn Saud killing the Rashidi\ngovernor, restored Riyadh to Saudi control. It was a great victory\u2014one that succeeded\n37 Z\u00fcrcher, The Young Turk Legacy and Nation Building, 41\u201352.\n38 James Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, Second Edition (New York:\nCheckmark Books, 2004), 162\u201366. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 324\nboth in restoring the Saudis to power and in cementing Ibn Saud\u2019s reputation as a\ndaring military commander.39\nThe Conquest of the Najd, 1902-1918\nIbn Saud was not content merely to recover his inheritance or to serve as the\nemir of a small state. A man of great ambition, he instead wanted to dominate the entire\nArabian peninsula. Accordingly, he followed the recapture of Riyadh with a campaign of\nconquest against the nearby bedouin tribes that ended with him adding much of the\nNajd to his expanding state. He followed with another war that secured for him control of\nthe large, heavily Shi\u02bfi Eastern Province that lay along the Arabian coast of the Persian\nGulf. These victories were substantial and, by the eve of the First World War, they gave\nibn Saud a commanding position in central Arabia.40\nHow did ibn Saud achieve such success so quickly? How could the scion of an\nexiled family lacking in resources and wealth secure legitimacy and build an army\nstrong enough to assume control of such a large territory in only a little more than a\ndecade? Ibn Saud\u2019s leadership skills and charisma certainly played a significant part in\nthe emirate\u2019s expansion; at root, however, his success then and later stemmed from his\nunique ability to satisfy the aspirations of two very different groups: the Wahhabi\n\u02bfulama\u02be who enjoyed substantial sway within Arabia and the British who dominated the\npeninsula\u2019s periphery.41\nA shrewd man with a keen grasp of politics, ibn Saud understood that the Saudi\nfamily\u2019s traditional relationship with the Wahhabis was central to the dynasty\u2019s power.\nAccordingly, from the start of his reign he renewed the family\u2019s close alliance with both\nthe politically influential town-dwelling \u02bfulama\u02be and the mutawwaa, a class of Wahhabi\nreligious scholars unique at that time to the Najd who used violence to enforce\nobservance of Islamic rituals like communal prayer and to prohibit banned activities\nsuch as drinking. To secure the support of the the mutawwaa, ibn Saud made them\nsalaried employees of the state and sanctioned their authority to enforce behavior; in\nparticular, he permitted them to impose Wahhabi doctrine on the bedouin tribes. In\nexchange, they used the newly created Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and\nProhibition of Vice to compel submission not only to shari\u02bfa law but also to ibn Saud\u2019s\nsecular authority. The emir followed by having the mutawwaa recruit the most zealous\nbedouin warriors into a new military organization, the al-Ikhwan, or brotherhood, that\nsupplemented his traditional forces. These moves paid multiple dividends. They\nensured the continued support of the influential mutawwaa clerics, ended disruptive\ntribal feuds, and ensured his ongoing control of the bedouin. Above all, they gave him a\n39 Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power (New York:\nTouchstone Books, 1991), 284\u201385.\n40 Rachel Bronson, Thicker Than Oil: America\u2019s Uneasy Partnership with Saudi Arabia\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 28\u201330.\n41 Madawi al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, Second Edition (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2010), 40\u201341.

Seeking to ensure its continued control of the\nPersian Gulf during World War I, it opened talks with him in 1915 aimed at enlisting the\nSaudi emirate in the fight against the Ottoman Empire and its local proxies, the\nRashidis. The result was the Anglo-Saudi Treaty. By its terms, Ibn Saud pledged to\nrefrain from raiding Britain\u2019s Persian Gulf protectorates and promised to attack the\nRashidis. In exchange, London agreed to provide him with arms, \u00a320,000 in gold up\nfront, and a further subsidy of \u00a35,000 in gold per month. The deal was a very good one\nfor ibn Saud. At the modest cost of going to war against his family\u2019s main rival in the\nNajd and promising to respect the territory of Britain\u2019s protectorates\u2014a course he was\nwise enough to have followed even if he had not signed a formal treaty with London\u2014\nhe was able to equip his army with modern weaponry and to secure sufficient gold to\nensure the absolute loyalty of key tribal leaders. Coupled with the alliance he had struck\nwith the mutawwaa and his creation of the powerful al-Ikhwan, he was well positioned to\ncontinue his campaign of territorial expansion in the postwar era.43\nConsolidation, 1919-1932\nActing carefully so as to avoid alarming London, ibn Saud did so with great skill.\nHe started by finally finishing off the Saudi family\u2019s old enemies, the Rashidis, in 1921.\nThat victory gave him control of the northern Nadj and a common border with\nHashimite-controlled Transjordan and Iraq; more broadly, it established that his state\nwas the dominant force in Arabia. Even then, however, ibn Saud was careful to remain\non good terms with London. For example, he agreed to ease British concerns about\ndisruptive cross-border raids into Hashimite territory by signing the Uqayr Protocol in\n1922, which demarcated the frontier between his state and the Mandates of Iraq and\nTransjordan. He also scrupulously refrained from seizing Mecca and Medina during the\nearly 1920s out of deference to London\u2019s close ties with King Husayn (r. 1916-1924).44\nThanks to the rapidly worsening state of relations between Britain and Husayn,\nhowever, he did not have to restrain himself for long. Ties between London and the\nHashimite king had deteriorated rapidly in the wake of World War I. Believing that the\nBritish had reneged on the terms of the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence, Husayn\nhad steadfastly refused to sign a treaty with Britain recognizing the new postwar order in\nthe region\u2014a choice that British diplomats found unacceptable. Intuiting that London\nwas giving serious consideration to abandoning Husayn, Ibn Saud realized that he\n42 Madawi Al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, Second Edition (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2010), 47\u201359.\n43 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 175.\n44 Al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 80\u201382; Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi\nArabia, 188\u201389. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 326\ncould now invade the Hijaz without angering Britain\u2014he just needed a reasonable\npretext to do so. Fortunately for him, Husayn provided the necessary rationale by\npublicly declaring himself caliph shortly after Kemal Mustafa had abolished the office in\nearly 1924. Ibn Saud jumped at the opportunity. Announcing that the Hashimite king\nwas unfit to hold such an exalted position, he ordered his forces to invade the Hijaz. The\nensuing war was entirely one sided. Without British backing, Husayn could do nothing to\nresist ibn Saud\u2019s powerful al-Ikhwan warriors and soon fled into exile.45\nHe may have defeated his last substantial external rival with his conquest of the\nHijaz, but he soon faced a far-more dangerous internal challenge in the form of the al-\nIkhwan. By the late 1920s, the brotherhood had become thoroughly disillusioned with\nibn Saud thanks to his increasingly pragmatic approach to governance. They resented\nhis attempts to curb the enforcement of Wahhabi beliefs in the Hijaz, bridled at his\nrefusal to permit them to destroy tombs and shrines as their Wahhabi beliefs dictated,\nand fumed at his realpolitik willingness to extend limited religious toleration to the Shi\u02bfi\nof the Eastern Province. They also opposed his introduction into Arabia of modern\ninnovations such as the telephone, telegraph, airplane, and automobile on grounds that\nthose devices did not exist at the time of the early umma and thus had no place in a\nMuslim society. Above all, they were angry with Ibn Saud because his decision to agree\nto respect the borders that divided his state from the British protectorates that\nsurrounded it had put an end to their jihad to extend Wahhabism.46\nIbn Saud reciprocated the al-Ikhwans\u2019 frustration. By the end of the 1920s, he\nhad grown unhappy about both the discontent that their strict enforcement of the shari\u02bfa\ncode had caused in the Hijaz and their efforts to assert their autonomy from him. More\nimportantly, he had become increasingly concerned that their desire to extend\nWahhabism to new areas through the use of force would antagonize Britain and, in so\ndoing, drag him into a war he could not win.47\nThe growing rift between ibn Saud and the al-Ikhwan finally burst into open\nconflict in 1929. The proximate cause was a brotherhood attack on an Iraqi police\noutpost near the Saudi border. The incident set off an escalating cycle of reprisals.\nIntent on sending a strong signal of resolve so as to prevent further attacks, Britain\nretaliated by bombing one of the brotherhood\u2019s encampments; upping the ante, the al-\nIkhwan responded in turn by launching a series of raids into both Kuwait and Iraq.48\nThe worsening situation deeply troubled Ibn Saud. Fearing that further reprisals\ncould escalate into a full-scale war with Britain, he pressed the brotherhood to end the\nconflict. They refused. Instead, to assert their autonomy, they raised the banner of revolt\nin March 1929 and went to war with the emir. Ibn Saud responded to this challenge with\n45 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 182.\n46 Al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 64\u201367.\n47 Al-Rasheed, 64\u201367.\n48 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 185. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 327\ncharacteristic speed and skill. Determined to ensure his monopoly over the levers of\npower in his state, he pressured the Wahhabi \u02bfulama\u02be in Riyadh to issue a fatwa\njustifying his use of force against the al-Ikhwan. Having covered his religious flank, he\nfollowed by swiftly destroying the brotherhood in battle.49\nSubstantially strengthening his domestic standing, the triumph over the al-Ikhwan\npaid ibn Saud two immediate political dividends. First, in 1932, it permitted him to\nannounce the unification of the Najd and the Hijaz into the new Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. Second, the brotherhood\u2019s defeat gave him the strength to compel the Wahhabi\nreligious scholars and the mutawwaa to assume a subordinate position in which their\nauthority would remain narrowly confined to education, religion, and social law. Thus,\nhis defeat of the brotherhood marked a pivotal turning point in the emergence of Saudi\nArabia. It not only permitted him to establish the kingdom itself, but, by transforming his\nfamily\u2019s traditional Wahhabi allies into junior partners, it seemed to have ensured that he\nand his successors would rule without serious internal challenge or constraint.50\nAppearances in this case were deceiving. Ibn Saud may have won in the short\nterm, but over the long haul, the \u02bfulama\u02be were able to use their monopoly over\neducation and religious law to transform themselves into a major domestic force in\nSaudi Arabia\u2014one to which even the ruling dynasty had to defer. Later, as we shall\nsee, they would leverage their influence and the tremendous wealth the kingdom\nderived from the sale of petroleum to export their fundamentalist views widely. Thus, as\nthe historian Rashid Khalidi argues, the arrangement Ibn Saud worked out with the\n\u02bfulama\u02be after the defeat of the al-Ikhwan turned out to be a \u201cdevil\u2019s bargain\u201d\u2014one that\nwould bring extremist religious ideas and vast oil money together in a way that would\npermit the Wahhabi to spread their austere teachings throughout the Sunni world.51\nFiscal Issues\nIn the meantime, ibn Saud had a new crisis to deal with. While his domestic\npolitical position had improved as a result of his victory over the al-Ikhwan, the fiscal\nhealth of his state was deteriorating rapidly. Part of the issue was a steady increase in\nstate spending. The war against the brotherhood, the need to increase subsidies to\ntribal chiefs to ensure their continued loyalty, the start of a substantial development\nprogram, and the cost of ibn Saud\u2019s lavish personal lifestyle had combined to\ndramatically increase government spending in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Ibn\nSaud\u2019s government would likely have been able to deal with these rising expenditures\nhad the Saudi economy been growing, but the added expenses coincided with the onset\nof the Great Depression. The global economic contraction bit hard into the kingdom\u2019s\nprimary source of revenue, the hajj. Thanks to the worldwide collapse in economic\nactivity, the number of pilgrims who visited Mecca fell from 129,000 in 1926 to the hajj\u2019s\n49 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 32\u201333.\n50 Al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 66\u201371.\n51 Quote from Rashid Khalidi, Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints and America\u2019s\nPerilous Path in the Middle East, Reprint edition (Boston: Beacon Press, 2005), 108. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 328\nmodern, pre-Covid-19 low of just 20,000 in 1933. The consequences for the Saudi\ntreasury were dire. Whipsawed between rising expenditures and declining revenues, the\ncountry quickly amassed a \u00a3300,000 deficit\u2014a figure far beyond its capacity to\nservice.52\nAn astute man, ibn Saud grasped that the fiscal crisis made for a combustible\nsituation. Without revenue, he could neither pay the army that maintained internal order\nnor continue to offer the subsidies to prominent tribal leaders that had ensured the\nallegiance of the bedouin. Absent the loyalty of the military and the tribes, in turn,\ndynastic authority would weaken and the state that he had so painstakingly constructed\nwould collapse. In other words, ibn Saud had to find some way to get his fiscal house in\norder and he had to do so fast if he hoped to prevent his budgetary problems from\nevolving into a dangerous political crisis.53\nThe Oil Boom Begins, 1933-1948\nOne possible solution was to sell mineral rights to Western firms\u2014particularly the\nrights to any oil located beneath the kingdom\u2019s seemingly limitless expanse of sand.\nThere was an established way to do so. Before World War II, states such as Saudi\nArabia typically auctioned rights to mineral deposits such as petroleum to foreign\ncompanies through a mechanism called a concession. An oil concession gave a foreign\nfirm the exclusive right to explore for petroleum deposits and to exploit any\ncommercially viable fields that it discovered in an agreed upon territory for a limited\u2014\nbut usually lengthy\u2014period of time. In exchange, the state granting the concession\nreceived a lump sum of money up front as well as a comparatively modest annual rent\npayment on the land on which the company was drilling and\u2014most consequentially\u2014\nroyalties on the sale of any oil.54\nConcerned about the impact of inviting non-Muslims into his kingdom, Ibn Saud\nhad previously expressed doubts about the wisdom of entering into an oil concession.\nHis dire fiscal circumstances produced a quick change of heart, however. Now\ndesperate for funds, he set aside his misgivings and made clear that he would\nenthusiastically welcome the opportunity to grant a concession to one of the Western oil\ncompanies. As he told one of his advisors, \u201c\u2018if anyone would offer me a million pounds, I\nwould give him all the concessions he wanted.\u2019\u201d55\nIn any event, an oil concession seemed to ibn Saud like a low-risk opportunity.\nDoubting that his kingdom possessed any petroleum whatsoever, he saw a concession\nas little more than a way to secure an infusion of quick and desperately needed case\u2014\none that came without any long-term costs or consequences. Ibn Saud was not alone in\nhis skepticism about Saudi Arabia\u2019s prospects as an oil producer. No less a figure than\n52 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 187.\n53 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 14; Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 187.\n54 Rogan, The Arabs, 356.\n55 Yergin, The Prize, 281\u201388. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 329\nJohn Cadman, the chair of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) maintained that\ngeological surveys yielded \u201c\u2018little room for optimism\u2019\u201d that the kingdom might contain oil.\nOne of his subordinates was even blunter, declaring that Saudi Arabia was \u201c\u2018devoid of\nall prospects\u2019\u201d of possessing petroleum.56\nThe discovery of petroleum on the island of Bahrain in 1932 altered perceptions\nof Saudi Arabia\u2019s potential as an oil producer, however. Given Bahrain\u2019s similar geology\nand its proximity\u2014it lies just thirty-two kilometers off the kingdom\u2019s Eastern Province in\nthe Persian Gulf\u2014the presence of oil there suggested strongly that Saudi Arabia might\ncontain substantial deposits. Even then, however, few firms sought the concession.\nRecent discoveries and a depression-induced collapse in demand for petroleum in the\nindustrialized world had resulted in a persistent, global oil glut and a broad retrenchment\nin the industry; coming in such circumstances, any new production from Arabia would\nmerely serve to further depress the already sagging price of oil. As a result, only one\ncomparatively small company, Standard Oil of California (Socal), pursued a concession\nin Saudi Arabia.57\nSocal\u2019s bid more than satisfied Ibn Saud. By its terms, the company agreed to\nprovide the king with two interest free loans in gold\u2014a \u00a330,000 one distributed\nimmediately and a second \u00a320,000 one issued eighteen months later\u2014that Saudi\nArabia would repay only out of any future royalties. In other words, if Socal failed to find\nany oil, the loans would become an outright gift to the kingdom. Socal also promised to\npay \u00a35,000 annually in rent and to remit royalties on the sale of any oil that it extracted.\nIn exchange, it won the exclusive right to explore for petroleum in a 930,000 square-\nkilometer swath of the kingdom and to exploit any oil that it found there. The\nconcession\u2019s terms were to last for sixty years.58\nSocal\u2019s efforts to turn the concession into a profitable venture got off to a rocky\nstart thanks to two significant problems. First, as a relatively small company, it lacked\nthe downstream markets in which to sell any petroleum that its newly created\nsubsidiary, the California-Arabian Oil Company (Casoc) might discover in the kingdom.\nIt solved this problem in 1936 by signing a deal with the Texas Oil Company\u2014later\nknown as Texaco\u2014that brought it and its valuable distribution network into Casoc as an\nequal partner. That move may have secured the needed markets, but it did not solve\nthe second, more fundamental problem: despite multiple efforts, the company had\nrepeatedly come up empty in its effort to discover petroleum in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, its\nexploratory drilling in the kingdom\u2019s most geologically promising location near the town\nof Dammam in the Eastern Province had repeatedly failed to produce commercially\nviable wells, though it did yield sufficient trace amounts of oil to justify continued\nexploration. Only in March 1938, a full five years into the concession, did one of Casoc\u2019s\nwells, Dammam-7, finally strike oil. Producing fifteen times the daily output of the typical\nUS well, it alone made the concession a success. Further wells in the area proved\n56 Yergin, 281\u201388.\n57 Yergin, 289\u201391.\n58 Yergin, 291. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 330\nequally productive and, to the delight of the company\u2019s shareholders, confirmed that\nCasoc had discovered a major field.59\nStill, it took some time for the oil industry in Saudi Arabia to really take off.\nThanks to wartime disruptions and a lack of equipment, Casoc\u2019s daily output only rose\nfrom 11,000 barrels per day in 1939 to 21,000 barrels per day in 1944. Thus, at the end\nof World War II, the kingdom remained a bit player in the global oil market.60\nSaudi production crossed an important watershed immediately after the war,\nhowever. Between 1944, when Casoc renamed itself the Arabian-American Oil\nCompany (Aramco), and 1950, the kingdom\u2019s output surged by more than 2500 percent\nand reached the then-staggering figure of 548,000 barrels per day. Two events explain\nthe massive surge. First, in 1948, Aramco geologists discovered the Ghawar Field\nsouthwest of Dhahran. An elephant field of almost unimaginable dimensions, it remains\nthe largest oilfield in the world and alone accounts for roughly half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s\ncurrent daily production. Second, Aramco brought on Socony-Vacuum and Standard Oil\nof New Jersey as partners. Large companies that controlled substantial downstream\nmarkets, they gave Aramco the capital and distribution networks the consortium needed\nto fully exploit its massive new find and make Saudi Arabia a major player in global\nenergy production.61\nBirth of the US-Saudi Alliance\nRelations between the US and Saudi governments warmed in parallel with the\ngrowing involvement of American petroleum companies in the kingdom. For\nWashington, the desire for closer ties stemmed from concerns about declining domestic\nsupply. Though America had long been the world\u2019s leading producer of petroleum,\npolicymakers in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt (r. 1932-1945) had grown\nincreasingly worried during the war that a combination of declining domestic production\nand rising demand might hamstring the US economy following the conflict. Secretary of\nthe Interior Harold Ickes (1873-1952) provided perhaps the clearest exposition of this\nview in an article published in American Magazine in December 1943 entitled,\nappropriately, \u201cWe\u2019re Running Out of Oil!\u201d With such concerns in mind, the US\ngovernment took a series of steps during the latter stages of the war to establish closer\nlinks with the kingdom. Most notably, it opened a diplomatic legation in Jeddah in 1942\nand began to provide Lend Lease aid to Saudi Arabia in 1943. Ibn Saud was receptive\nto Washington\u2019s entreaties. Seeking both a patron to protect his kingdom and a\n59 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 191\u201392.\n60 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 19\u201320.\n61 Bronson, 19\u201320. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 331\ncounterweight to Britain\u2019s dominant position in the Middle East, he, too, hoped to\nstrengthen bilateral ties.62\nIn 1945, accordingly, the two nations established close links that would, with\noccasional hiccups, endure to the present day. The crucial event that solidified the\nbudding relationship was the meeting between ibn Saud and Roosevelt that occurred\naboard the cruiser USS Quincy on the Suez Canal\u2019s Great Bitter Lake on February 14,\n1945. It was a momentous occasion for both countries. While Roosevelt and Ibn Saud\ndisagreed over the question of Palestine\u2019s future and while the meeting produced no\nformal agreement, their brief encounter nonetheless marked the moment at which Saudi\nArabia entered the US sphere of interest. Indeed, it was not long after that meeting that\nthe two states signed an agreement that gave the US military access to bases in the\nkingdom including one at Dhahran from which B-29 strategic bombers could strike\ntargets in the USSR. Later, with Europe\u2019s postwar recovery increasingly dependent on\nArabian oil, President Harry S. Truman (r. 1945-1953) established an implicit security\nguarantee of the kingdom by declaring that Washington was \u201c\u2018interested in the\npreservation of the independence and territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia.\u2019\u201d Thus, by the\nend of the decade, the American special relationship with the kingdom\u2014one in which\nSaudi Arabia provided a stable supply of oil and a religious sanction of Washington\u2019s\nconduct of the Cold War in exchange for American military protection\u2014had been firmly\nestablished.63\nThe Gulf States\nWhile Saudi Arabia came to lie within the US sphere immediately following World\nWar II, the principalities of the Persian Gulf instead remained firmly in Britain\u2019s orbit.\nBritish domination of the region stretched back all the way to 1820 when London\ncompelled the Gulf emirates to adhere to an agreement banning piracy. It had followed\nby entering into a series of protectorate agreements with the Trucial States\u2014today\u2019s\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE)\u2014in 1835 and by subsequently signing similar agreements\nwith Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. Designed to deny hostile European states a foothold in\nthe Persian Gulf from which they might menace Britain\u2019s vital commerce with India,\nthose treaties granted London control of the emirates\u2019 foreign relations in exchange for\na promise to provide them with military protection. London supplemented those bilateral\nagreements with a general statement shortly after the turn of the century. Announced by\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Lansdowne (1845-1927) in 1903, it amounted\nto a British Monroe Doctrine for the Persian Gulf.64\n62 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 196; Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 40; \u201cU.S.\nConsulate General Jeddah | U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Saudi Arabia,\u201d accessed\nAugust 26, 2020, https://sa.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/jeddah/.\n63 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 36\u201340, 46\u201349.\n64 Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, Insecure Gulf: The End of Certainty and the Transition to\nthe Post-Oil Era (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 15\u201320. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 332\nMeanwhile, like Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States\u2019 commercial prospects took a turn\nfor the better thanks to the discovery of oil in the region in the interwar period. Bahrain\nwas the first of the emirates to become a producer state, doing so when Socal struck oil\non the island in 1932. Kuwait was next. Here, the timing of the find was peculiarly\nserendipitous. Only a few years earlier, the pearl-diving industry that had long\nconstituted the mainstay of its economy had collapsed after a Japanese noodle seller\ninvented an inexpensive process for developing cultured pearls. The result was a period\nof severe economic contraction for the people and government of Kuwait. The bad\ntimes did not last, however. Instead, in 1938, the emirate\u2019s prospects took a dramatic\nturn for the better when the Kuwait Oil Company, a joint venture of Gulf Oil and APOC,\ndiscovered a major field in the country. Qatar followed quickly with the discovery of the\nDukhan Field in 1939, while the Trucial States and Oman joined the petroleum\nproducers\u2019 club in 1958 and 1964 respectively.65\nRumblings of Discontent\nInitially, the leaders of the oil-producing states of the Persian Gulf and Arabian\npeninsula were happy with the concession system under which the petroleum industry\noperated. From their perspective, the arrangement was a highly favorable one that had\nbequeathed upon them fantastical amounts of money at little cost. Indeed, ibn Saud\u2019s\nfirst royalty check was for a then-staggering $1.5 million. To be sure, the system gave\ncompanies like Aramco the lion\u2019s share of the profits; however, it also saddled them with\nall of the costs and uncertainty inherent in the extraction and sale of oil. Those\nexpenses and risks were substantial. The petroleum industry was and is a highly\ncapital-intensive one that required firms to spend huge amounts of money on tankers,\nrefineries, pipelines, downstream marketing and distribution operations, and storage\ntanks\u2014sums that were wildly beyond what countries like Saudi Arabia could raise at\nthat time. It was also a capricious business in which many concessions failed to result in\ncommercially viable operations. As the historian Eugene Rogan points out, \u201ccompanies\n[often] drilled for years without so much as an oily rag to show for their efforts.\u201d As a\nresult, Arab rulers such as ibn Saud were perfectly content during the 1930s and early\n1940s with an arrangement that provided them with heretofore unimaginable streams of\nincome while leaving all of the headaches, costs, and risks to the oil companies.66\nBy the late 1940s, however, attitudes were beginning to change. Whatever risks\nthe oil companies had once shouldered were long gone. Instead, having paid off the\ninfrastructure needed to produce and distribute petroleum products, they were reaping\nwhat increasingly seemed like windfall profits. By 1949, for example, Aramco\u2019s earnings\nhad grown so much that the company was earning three times the amount that Saudi\nArabia was receiving for the sale of its own petroleum. Even more galling, the company\npaid $43 million in taxes to the United States in 1949 but only $39 million in royalties to\n65 Yergin, The Prize, 292\u2013300.\n66 Rogan, The Arabs, 356; Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 19. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 333\nIbn Saud\u2019s government\u2014meaning, in other words, that the US government took in $4\nmillion more on the sale of the kingdom\u2019s oil than did the Saudi state!67\nIt was not just the distribution of profits that the petrostates were upset about,\nmoreover. More fundamentally, their governments were increasingly concerned about\nthe question of control. The concession system had rendered the producing states little\nmore than passive participants in the petroleum industry. While they collected regular\nroyalty checks, it was the oil companies that made all of the decisions pertaining to\nproduction\u2014meaning how much petroleum is drilled\u2014and marketing\u2014meaning the\nprice at which the firms sold the oil. Worse, the companies frequently made pricing and\nproduction decisions that were clearly contrary to the interests of the host countries. By\n1950, as a result, pressure was building for a wholesale restructuring of the petroleum\nindustry aimed, at a minimum, at dramatically increase the share of profits that went to\nthe producing states.68\nIran: Contested Independence\nSurprisingly, in light of its apparent similarities with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, Iran\nhad a far-more difficult experience during the interwar period than did those states. On\nthe surface, its commonalities with them were strong. Like Kemalist Turkey, Iran\nundertook an ambitious modernization program centered on secularization and Import\nSubstitution Industrialization aimed at transforming the country into a Western-style\nstate; like Ibn Saud\u2019s kingdom, meanwhile, it was a major oil producer. These\nsimilarities ultimately proved superficial, however, and Iran was unable to match their\nsuccess in navigating the difficult waters of the interwar period. Instead, thanks to a\ncombination of its internal weakness, its strategic location, and the pro-German\nsentiments of its ruler, Reza Khan (r. 1925-1941), it came under Allied occupation\nduring World War II and emerged from the conflict a shaky and divided country\u2014one\nthat was ill-prepared for the challenges of the mid-twentieth century.\nQajar Iran\nTo understand Iran\u2019s development during the interwar period, we must first briefly\ntrace its history from the end of the Safavid Dynasty in 1722 through the early-twentieth\ncentury. For Iran, the seven-decade period that followed the demise of the Safavid\nDynasty was a peculiarly fractious and challenging one. Lacking a powerful central\ngovernment, it devolved into an anarchic place in which tribal chiefs, high-ranking Shi\u02bfi\nclerics, and regional warlords divided the country among themselves.69\nIt was only when Agha Mohammad Khan (r. 1796-1797) established the Qajar\nDynasty in 1796 that a degree of order returned to Iran.

This image was certainly one that the dynasty\nsough to project. For instance, Fath Ali Shah (r. 1797-1834) professed to rule Iran as an\nunchallenged and absolute monarch and went so far as to claim that as shah he owned\nall of the country\u2019s land.70\nIn reality, Qajar authority was quite limited. Fath Ali Shah may have exercised\nabsolute authority in the territory immediately surrounding the capital of Tehran, but he\nlacked the military strength and bureaucratic capacity to exert direct control over\nterritory that lay outside that area. Instead, he and his successors could only indirectly\ninfluence events in the rest of the country by entering into strategic political marriages\nwith key aristocrats, by exploiting\u2014and at times stoking\u2014conflict among tribes and\nethnic groups, and by trading the legitimacy that the dynasty could bestow on local\nnotables in exchange for their nominal subordination to the central government.71\nOne consequence of the dynasty\u2019s political weakness was its tendency to pursue\npolicies that were harmful to the country\u2019s economy. Fiscal issues played a key role\nhere. Perpetually in budgetary arrears, the Qajar were compelled to supplement the\ntaxes they raised directly in the region surrounding Tehran by resorting to the sale of\noffices\u2014particularly governorships and positions as tax collectors. Holding their posts\nfor terms of only one year, the winning bidders had little incentive to invest in the\nterritories they had acquired and instead squeezed the taxpayers as hard as they could\nso as to extract maximum profits before their terms expired. As a result, while the sale\nof offices secured a quick infusion of cash for the dynasty, it came at the cost of long-\nterm economic growth. Making matters worse, the Qajar devoted precious little of the\nrevenue raised through this system to the construction and maintenance of\ninfrastructure such as roads, irrigation works, or educational institutions that might have\ncontributed to economic development. On the contrary, they devoted the vast bulk of\nthe tax revenue they raised to the military, to the small central bureaucracy and, most\nnotably, to the extravagant lifestyles of the ruling family and its hangers-on.72\nThe Western Onslaught\nQajar weakness would have proven challenging enough for Iran during ordinary\ntimes, but it was particularly problematic coinciding as it did with surging Western\naggression in the Middle East. The greatest threat to Iran came from the north. Eager to\nacquire warm-water ports, Russia set its sights on the country beginning shortly after\nthe turn of the eighteenth century. In a pair of conflicts fought during and shortly after\nthe Napoleonic Wars, Tsar Alexander I\u2019s (r. 1801-1825) modern army handily defeated\nFath Ali Shah\u2019s outmatched force of undisciplined tribal levies and irregular troops.\n70 Ervand Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran (Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 2008), 8\u201322.\n71 Abrahamian, 8\u201322.\n72 Nikki Keddie, Modern Iran: Roots and Results of Revolution (New Haven: Yale\nUniversity Press, 2006), 24\u201327. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 335\nUnsurprisingly, the agreements that ended those wars imposed stiff terms on the\nQajars. They required Iran to cede substantial territory in the Caucasus, to cap Iranian\ntariffs on imported Russian goods at 5 percent, to exempt the tsars\u2019 subjects from\nhaving to pay internal customs, and to accord them extraterritorial legal rights.73\nRussia was not alone in seeking strategic and commercial advantage in Iran.\nEager both to secure new outlets for its industrial goods and to protect its vital Indian\ncolony by preventing St. Petersburg from establishing a presence on the Persian Gulf,\nBritain, too, sought influence in Iran and access to its markets. London got its chance\nthanks to a succession dispute among rival Qajar princes following Fath Ali Shah\u2019s\ndeath in 1834. In exchange for backing Shah Mohammad Mirza\u2019s candidacy (r. 1834-\n1848), the British government secured treaties in 1836 and 1841 that accorded its\nmerchants the same commercial and legal rights that the tsarist government had won\nfor its subjects.74\nIronically, it was London and St. Petersburg\u2019s competition for dominance that\nallowed Iran to retain its independence during the age of imperialism. Determined to\nprevent each other from assuming a commanding position in a country that each\ndeemed essential to its security, the two powers tacitly agreed in the mid-nineteenth\ncentury to turn Iran into a neutral buffer state in the ongoing Great Game. It is important\nto understand that this situation did not mean that Tehran enjoyed genuine,\nindependence. As Mohammad Mirza\u2019s succession made clear, British and Russian\ndiplomats regularly involved themselves in the country\u2019s internal affairs\u2014a practice that\nseverely eroded the dynasty\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of Iran\u2019s increasingly nationalistic\nsubjects.75\nThe rise in Iranian nationalist sentiment in the late-nineteenth century was, itself,\na direct result of the growing Western economic penetration that the commercial treaties\nwith Russia and Britain had made possible. The impact of those agreements was\nenormous. With Iranian tariff rates limited to a mere 5 percent, inexpensive, industrially\nproduced Western finished goods such as guns, sugar, kerosene, tea, and, most\nconsequentially, textiles, flooded into the country. The result was a sudden, wholesale\nrestructuring of Iran\u2019s economy. Unable to compete with the West\u2019s cheaper, machine-\nmade goods, many traditional businesses rapidly folded; in their place, new, less-\nprofitable extractive industries emerged to supply European factories with the raw\nmaterials that they demanded.76\nThe ongoing economic transformation that resulted from the West\u2019s sudden\ncommercial penetration proved deeply unsettling. To be sure, some benefited. Most\nnotably, landlords who switched to the production of cash crops for export and a few far-\n73 Gene R.

Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 336\nsighted merchants who were able to successfully navigate the country\u2019s incorporation\ninto the global market did quite well. Most Iranians fared poorly, however. Workers in\nthe traditional craft and textile industries lost their livelihood when factory-produced\ngoods began to flood into Iran, for example, while many of the politically and\nsymbolically important bazaar merchants faced bankruptcy in the face of the huge influx\nof inexpensive Western products. Peasants suffered the most. Already enduring a\ndecline in wages owing to a steady rise in the population and a parallel increase in the\nlabor supply, they suffered long periods of immiseration over the nineteenth century\npunctuated by bouts of famine. It was a combustible mix\u2014one that produced surging\nIranian nationalism, rising anger at the Western powers, and growing frustration with the\nQajar shahs.77\nConcessions\nMost observers then and now agree that the Iranian people\u2019s dissatisfaction with\nthe ruling dynasty was justified. Over the course of the nineteenth century, the Qajar\nregime provided little effective leadership in response to the threat that the West posed.\nMost notably, in sharp contrast to the substantial defensive modernization programs\nthat the Egyptian and Ottoman states pursued in the nineteenth century, the Iranian\ngovernment made no more than halfhearted efforts to reform or strengthen the\ncountry.78\nOwing to the length of his reign, Nasser al-Din Shah (r. 1848-1896) bears the\nbulk of the responsibility for this failing. While he did authorize a few modernization\ninitiatives such as the establishment in 1879 of a small, Western-style military unit\u2014the\nRussian-officered Cossack Brigade\u2014he also ended a promising effort to initiate a\nTanzimat-style modernization program by having its leading proponent, his chief\nminister, Amir Kabir (1807-1852), killed in 1852 at the behest of courtiers whose\nsalaries and power his restructuring proposal had threatened. Thereafter, the shah\nstaunchly opposed most reforms, and instead focused his efforts on selling concessions\nto Westerners in order to generate the funds needed to sustain his government and his\nlavish lifestyle.79\nAt first, the concessions were a boon for the Qajar shah. Though the income\nraised was modest relative to the privileges that their Western purchasers were gaining,\nthey nonetheless provided the Iranian government with desperately needed funds. The\nconcessions seemed to come at little political cost, moreover. Early agreements such as\none that granted Britain the right to construct a telegraph line across the country did not\ncontribute to the wrenching economic changes that Iran was experiencing or directly\n77 Abbas Amanat, Iran: A Modern History (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017),\n240\u201342.\n78 Garthwaite, The Persians, 206.\n79 Michael Axworthy, A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind, Second Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2016), 192\u201399. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 337\nimpact ordinary people. As such, they aroused neither significant popular attention nor,\nmore importantly, meaningful opposition.80\nBeginning in the late-nineteenth century, however, concessions became a\nlightning-rod issue in Iran. The key event that transformed public perceptions of them\nwas the signing of a new contract between the government and the news-agency\npioneer Baron Julius de Reuter (1816-1899) in 1872. The concession he secured was\nas huge as it was one sided. It gave him the exclusive right to construct and operate\nrailroads, streetcars, new irrigation works, mines, and a national bank in Iran; in\nexchange, Nasser al-Din Shah\u2019s government would receive a modest share of the\nprofits. The concession was to last for seventy years. The leak of the deal\u2019s terms\nproduced an immediate backlash in Iran. Furious at the shah for entering into an\nobviously detrimental agreement that would directly and adversely affect the lives of\nmany Iranians, his subjects launched spontaneous, nationwide protests demanding its\nimmediate revocation. Faced with this intense and broad-based opposition movement,\nthe shah had little choice but to comply. Accordingly, at great expense, he broke the\nagreement with de Reuter.81\nA subsequent concession that granted the British merchant Major G. F. Talbot a\nmonopoly on the sale and production of tobacco in 1891 generated an even fiercer\nnationalist response. The cultural and economic centrality of tobacco products in Iran\nexplains the intensity of the opposition. With a huge share of the population either\nconsuming or producing tobacco, the concession promised to directly and viscerally\naffect the lives of millions of Iranians. As a result, news of the agreement spurred the\nimmediate emergence of a new opposition coalition. Broad in composition, it included a\ndiverse array of groups including secular Western reformers, bazaar merchants, and\nurban workers.82\nSignificantly, it also involved Shi\u02bfi clerics. Their participation in the protest\nmovement marked a significant change. Heretofore, the \u02bfulama\u02be had refrained from\nintruding directly in politics. Now, they were not only participating in the protests against\nthe tobacco concession but were leading them. Indeed, the core of the protest effort\u2014a\nboycott on the production and consumption of tobacco\u2014originated in 1892 with a fatwa\nissued by the mujtahid Mirza Hasan Shirazi (1815-1895), at the behest of the Islamic\nmodernist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838-1897).83\nIranians of all classes enthusiastically took up the ban. In short order, tobacco\nproduction halted, and Iranian smokers went cold turkey. Even Nasser al-Din Shah\u2019s\nwives honored the boycott. Facing such intense and unified opposition, the shah had\nlittle option but to cancel the concession. Doing so proved to be expensive. Breaking the\ndeal with Talbot came at the staggering cost of \u00a3500,000, an amount so high that the\n80 Keddie, Modern Iran, 54\u201355.\n81 Keddie, 54\u201355.\n82 Amanat, Iran, 304\u201314.\n83 Amanat, 304\u201314. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 338\nshah had to borrow funds on international money markets to pay it\u2014incurring, in the\nprocess, Iran\u2019s first foreign debt.84\nIran\u2019s Constitutional Revolution, 1905-1911\nThe tobacco protest set the stage for further and more far-reaching popular\npolitical action under Nasser al-Din Shah\u2019s successor, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah (r. 1896-\n1907). The new shah\u2019s reign generated substantial opposition from the very start. With\nhis hands tied by his state\u2019s feeble administrative capacity and by Western-imposed\ntariff limits, he could neither arrest skyrocketing inflation nor address a serious cholera\nepidemic then ravaging Iran. Further eroding his support were the three trips he took to\nEurope early during his reign. Absurdly extravagant, they were so fantastically\nexpensive that paying for them required his government to take out two costly loans\nwith Russian banks and to grant a British subject, William Knox D\u2019Arcy (1849-1917), a\nsixty-year concession for the exploration and production of petroleum in southern Iran.\nThe oil concession and the loans infuriated the now-politically conscious Iranian people.\nNews of them not only spurred the quick revival of the tobacco protest coalition shortly\nafter the turn of the century but also left the country standing on the brink of a\nrevolution.85\nIt finally came in 1905. As revolutions so often have, it began with women\nprotesting food shortages and rising prices in the cities. Mozaffar ad-Din Shah could do\nlittle to arrest the revolt\u2019s progress once it got going. Indeed, his government\u2019s\ntransparent effort to scapegoat sugar merchants for the rise in prices not only failed to\ndeflect blame but further infuriated the public. Even the use of force failed to slow the\ngrowing size of the demonstrations that rocked the country\u2019s cities. Those protests\nreached a crescendo in 1906. Early in the year, three leading mujtahids took bast, or\nsanctuary, at a shrine near Tehran and demanded the creation of an Adalat Khaneh, or\nhouse of justice, by which\u2014though they were vague\u2014they meant some form of\nconsultative or representative body. Shortly thereafter, 14,000 bazaar merchants upped\nthe ante by taking bast in the gardens of the British legation, where, guided by secular\nmodernizers, they called for the promulgation of a constitution and the establishment of\na majlis, or parliament. These events ended any hope that Mozaffar ad-Din Shah might\nhave entertained that he could rein in the protests. Accordingly, the shah capitulated in\nAugust and reluctantly agreed to hold elections for a representative assembly.86\nConvened in October 1906, the National Assembly began by drafting a\nconstitution for Iran. It came in two parts. The first, the Fundamental Law, established\nIran as a constitutional monarchy in which parliament was to be the dominant branch of\ngovernment. The second, the Supplementary Fundamental Law, guaranteed Western-\nstyle civil rights such as freedom of the press and assembly and granted all citizens\u2014\nincluding religious minorities\u2014equal rights. With great reluctance, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah\n84 Garthwaite, The Persians, 208; Keddie, Modern Iran, 60\u201361.\n85 Keddie, Modern Iran, 62\u201365, 72.\n86 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 2nd page, slide to revolution section. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 339\nagreed to abide by the Fundamental Law in December 1906. His successor,\nMohammad Ali Shah (r. 1907-1909), was even less enthusiastic about ceding power to\nthe people; nonetheless, he formally committed the dynasty to observe the\nSupplementary Fundamental Law in October 1908. It was a heady time in Iran. Only the\nsecond Asian country to adopt a written constitution, it appeared to have joined the\nranks of the world\u2019s democratic states.87\nIn reality, the push for democracy continued to face substantial challenges from\nboth inside and outside Iran. Within the country, the resistance to constitutional\ngovernment came primarily from an alliance between the shah and the clerics. It took\nshape after the revolution when the religious scholars came to realize that the\nreformers\u2019 vision of democracy was far-more sweeping than the more conservative,\ntraditional Muslim system of elite consultation that the \u02bfulama\u02be had sought when they\nhad called for Adalat Khaneh. The monarchy and the clerical establishment were\npowerful institutions in Iran; acting in unison, they were able to mount a strong\nresistance to constitutional government. Indeed, at one point in 1908, the conservatives\nwere strong enough to mount a counter coup that temporarily ended democratic rule in\nIran.88\nThe reformers in Iran had the wherewithal to contain the challenges that the\nmonarchy and the \u02bfulama\u02be posed to representative government, and they quickly\nrestored democratic rule. They emphatically lacked the strength to overcome London\nand St. Petersburg\u2019s unified opposition, however. Russia and Britain\u2019s pursuit of a\ncommon policy toward Tehran was new\u2014a byproduct of a recent reconciliation between\nthe two states. Fierce competitors for much of the nineteenth century, they had resolved\ntheir differences by signing the Anglo-Russian Convention in 1907 so that they could\njointly address the common danger posed by Germany. Focused largely on ending their\nGreat Game rivalry in Asia, the agreement dealt with their competing interests in Iran by\ndividing the country into a northern, Russian-dominated region, a British sphere of\ninterest in the south, and a neutral, buffer zone in the middle of the country.89\nThe agreement did not end Iran\u2019s independence. Indeed, the two powers\ncontinued to recognize Iranian sovereignty and, for a time at least, accepted its\ndemocratic government and nationalist aspirations. What they were unwilling to tolerate,\nhowever, were efforts by the Iranian government to challenge their dominant positions\nin their respective spheres of interest. Accordingly, when the majlis threatened the\ntripartite division of the country by seeking to enforce tax collection in the Russian zone,\nthe tsarist government\u2014with London\u2019s tacit support\u2014compelled the Iranian cabinet to\ndissolve the majlis. This intervention in Iranian affairs proved pivotal. With it, Iran\u2019s\n87 Amanat, Iran, 337\u201341.\n88 Keddie, Modern Iran, 69\u201371.\n89 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 49\u201350. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 340\nexperiment with constitutional government and representative democracy came to an\nignominious end.90\nThe Discovery of Oil\nMeanwhile, even during the constitutional period, foreign economic dominance of\nIran continued to grow. Most notably, after several years of fruitless searching and\nworsening finances, D\u2019Arcy and his partner, the Burmah Oil Company, struck oil in the\nprovince of Khuzestan in southwest Iran in 1908. This was a major discovery\u2014one that\nwas well beyond D\u2019Arcy and Burmah\u2019s ability to exploit. Consequently, the following\nyear, they formed a new, publicly held corporation, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to\nraise the capital needed to extract and market the concession\u2019s petroleum. APOC\u2019s\nproduction totals were modest at first; it pumped just 1,600 barrels per day in 1912.\nHowever, the fact that it possessed the only proven, British-controlled source of oil in\nthe world made the company and its concession strategically significant\u2014especially\nafter the admiralty opted in 1912 to convert the fleet from coal-fired powerplants to more\nflexible and efficient oil-powered engines. Indeed, the navy\u2019s shift from coal to oil\nrendered the D\u2019Arcy concession so essential to imperial defense that the British\ngovernment itself assumed a majority stake in APOC in 1914. Thus, from that point\nforward, the British state directly owned the oil that lay under the sand of southwest\nIran\u2014a situation that indignant Iranian nationalists could do nothing about.91\nWorld War I and Britain\u2019s Play for Dominance\nThe outbreak of the First World War served to further catalyze foreign domination\nof Iran. In the north, Russian forces not only fought with Ottoman troops along both\nsides of Iran\u2019s western border but also regularly intervened in the country\u2019s domestic\npolitics. Meanwhile, in the south, London expanded its sphere of interest and took steps\nto protect APOC assets in Khuzestan Province from Arab saboteurs incited to action by\nWilhelm Wassmus (1880-1931)\u2014Germany\u2019s \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d It did so by\norganizing a new military formation composed of Iranian troops under the command of\nBritish officers called the South Persia Rifles. Numbering 8,000 men at its peak, it\nproved essential both in safeguarding the oil fields and in ensuring that Khuzestan\nremained firmly within the British sphere of interest.92\nDespite being officially neutral, Iran suffered enormously during and just after the\nFirst World War. Some of its problems stemmed directly from the fighting that took place\non its soil. Most obviously, combat operations in the north between Ottoman and\nRussian forces resulted in the deaths of substantial numbers of Iranians and impelled\nmany more to flee their homes. Far more consequential for Iran, however, were the\nindirect effects of the fighting\u2014above all, the war-induced scarcity of food. Stemming\nfrom a combination of labor impressment, fighting, and the requisitioning of scarce food\n90 Keddie, Modern Iran, 69\u201371.\n91 Yergin, The Prize, 150\u201364.\n92 Garthwaite, The Persians, 214\u201315. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 341\nsupplies by foreign armies, famine killed untold thousands across Iran. Worse, it left\nmillions malnourished and thus susceptible to epidemic diseases like cholera, typhus,\nand, especially, the Spanish Flu. Demographic data makes clear just how devastating\nthe war was for Iran. Collectively, famine, disease, and combat operations resulted in\nthe deaths of two million Iranians\u2014about 10 percent of the prewar population\u2014between\n1917 and 1921.93\nBritain sought to exploit Iran\u2019s weakness and Russia\u2019s revolution-induced\nparalysis immediately following the armistice to advance its imperial interests in the\nregion. Indeed, Iran was a central part of Prime Minister Lloyd George\u2019s (r. 1916-1922)\npostwar plan to establish Britain as the hegemonic power in the Middle East. In contrast\nto its approach in other parts of the region, however, London did not seek formal control\nin Iran. Instead, it made a bid in 1919 to establish a de facto protectorate over the\ncountry by presenting the Iranian government with a new, bilateral agreement called the\nAnglo-Persian Treaty. By its terms, London would provide Tehran with a \u00a32-million loan\nto pay for a powerful army and for transportation infrastructure that would help the\ncentral government restore its authority over the country following the war. In exchange,\nBritain would assume formal control over Iran\u2019s finances and customs collection and\nwould become the country\u2019s sole provider of military equipment and advisors.94\nUltimately, London\u2019s gambit failed. Britain\u2019s attempt to implement key parts of the\ntreaty before the Iranian government had formally endorsed it ignited a furious\nopposition campaign that promised violence against any politician who favored the\nagreement. That threat worked. Successive prime ministers\u2014even ones supportive of\nthe deal\u2014refused to submit it to the majlis for approval for fear of their lives. As a result,\nthe treaty did not go into effect. In response, London decided to abandon its bid for\ndominance in Iran in 1921 and to instead consider alternative ways of ensuring its\ninterests in the country. It quickly settled on the idea of sponsoring a strongman who\ncould maintain order and uphold key commercial agreements. Accordingly, British\nofficials in Tehran dropped their efforts to secure passage of the treaty and began\nsearching for a suitably pliable military figure who could impose order on a country that\nhad slid into chaos.95\nReza Khan Takes Control, 1921-1925\nThey found their man in a dynamic, if autocratic, officer in the Cossack Brigade:\nthe modernizing nationalist Reza Khan. With tacit British encouragement, he rode into\nTehran in February 1921 at the head of a force of 3,000 troops and deposed the\nexisting government. At first, it appeared that Reza Khan had acted merely to restore\norder to Iran. Indeed, he did not seize the reins of government himself but instead took\nthe subordinate posts of minister of war and head of the army and helped the journalist\n93 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 59\u201360; Keddie, Modern Iran, 73\u201375.\n94 Keddie, Modern Iran, 75\u201380.\n95 David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the\nCreation of the Modern Middle East (New York: Avon Books, 1989), 455\u201360. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 342\nand modernizer Sayyid Zia al-Din Tabatabai (r. 1921) become prime minister. At British\ninsistence, he also retained Ahmad Shah Qajar (r. 1909-1925) as head of state. It soon\nbecame clear, however, that these actions were little more than window dressing\ndesigned to obscure what had in fact been a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in which Reza Khan had\nassumed control of the Iranian state.96\nHe devoted the first few years of his rule to consolidating his authority and\nengaging in state building. These were tall orders. Bereft of an effective central\ngovernment since the outbreak of World War I, Iran had devolved into a decentralized\npatchwork of statelets ruled by tribal khans and regional warlords who expressed little\nmore than token fealty to Tehran and who made clear that they would resist any effort to\nend their autonomy. Reza Khan was well position to bring them to heel, however.\nTaking advantage of the royalties he was receiving from APOC, he was able to quickly\nexpand the size of the army. He followed by using his strengthened military to expand\nthe proportion of the country over which the central government exercised real authority,\nand, importantly, to compel landlords who fell under his control to pay both current and\nback taxes. In short order, as a result, he had set in motion a virtuous cycle wherein his\ngrowing army secured control of territory and new taxes that in turn permitted a further\nexpansion of the military and, with it, the acquisition of additional land and revenue.97\nBy 1925, the process was essentially complete. Thereafter, the central\ngovernment\u2019s writ extended to all parts of Iran, and Reza Khan enjoyed legitimacy both\ninside and outside the country. Confident in his position, he chose that time to depose\nAhmad Shah Qajar and to arrange for the majlis, which he had reduced to little more\nthan a debating society, to proclaim him the new monarch: Reza Shah Pahlavi. He\nchose his dynastic name with great deliberation. Dating to the Sassanid Dynasty (224-\n651), the term Pahlavi linked his family to one of Iran\u2019s most powerful pre-Islamic ruling\nhouses and thus helped to legitimate his reign.98\n\u201cModernization from Above,\u201d 1925-1941\nReza Khan moved aggressively after his coronation to complete the campaign of\nnation building that he had begun in 1921. An autocratic ruler who was committed to\nremaking his country along modernist, Western lines, he forcefully pursued a rapid, top-\ndown restructuring program modeled on Mustafa Kemal\u2019s widely celebrated effort to\nrestructure Turkey. Appropriately, he referred to his reform effort as \u201c\u2018modernization\nfrom above.\u2019\u201d99\nLike Ataturk Reza Khan made secularization a central component of his\nrestructuring program. Looking to break the power and independence of the Shi\u02bfi\n96 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 63\u201365.\n97 Abrahamian, 66\u201372.\n98 Ali Ansari, Modern Iran Since 1921: The Pahlavis and After (New York: Longman,\n2003), 36.\n99 Keddie, Modern Iran, 87. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 343\nclerics, he pursued secularization along three tracks. First, he stripped the religious\nscholars of their control over education by establishing a secular public school system\npatterned on the French lyc\u00e9e model and by gradually folding existing religious schools\ninto it. Second, he ended the clerics\u2019 dominance of the law in Iran by replacing the\nshari\u02bfa code with new civil, commercial, and criminal legal systems and by requiring\njudges to possess degrees from secular law schools\u2014a stipulation that effectively\nbarred the religiously educated \u02bfulama\u02be from serving on the bench. Finally, he\nundermined the clerics\u2019 financial independence first by promulgating a law in 1932 that\nforbade them from engaging in the profitable practice of registering legal documents\nand then, later that decade, by seizing the awqaf that sustained them. By 1941, as a\nresult, the once mighty religious scholars\u2014who, ironically, had been among Reza\nKhan\u2019s earliest supporters\u2014had lost much of their independence and power.100\n\u201cModernization from above\u201d also involved an array of Kemalist-inspired changes\ndesigned to turn Iran into a modern country unified by a common national identity.\nThose reforms ran the gamut. To bring Iran into accord with modern European\npractices, Reza Khan introduced the metric system, replaced the traditional Muslim\nlunar calendar with a new, solar one\u2014albeit still dated from the hijra\u2014and required\nIranians to adhere to a common time zone. Meanwhile, to unify the people and to bind\nthem to the state, he promoted a series of initiatives aimed at replacing narrow, local\nidentities with a common, nationalist one. Issued in 1928, for example, the Law of\nUniformity of Dress sought to weaken competing conceptions of identity by banning\npeople from wearing clothing that indicated their tribe, class, ethnicity, or religion and by\nrequiring all men, save for clerics, to wear Western-style, brimmed hats. Later, and\nmore controversially, he outlawed the practice of veiling. Finally, he implemented a\nsystem of conscription in 1925 designed as much to create a sense of shared, national\nidentity as to ensure an adequate supply of recruits for the army.101\nLike Ataturk, Reza Khan also recruited the social sciences to the task of nation\nbuilding. To create a strong sense of common identity, he established the Cultural\nAcademy and tasked it with replacing Armenian, Turkish, and Arabic loanwords with\narchaic Persian terms or neologisms in an effort to purge the Persian language of\nforeign influence. A more radical attempt to follow the Kemalist example by replacing\nthe Arabic alphabet drew interest for a time, but ultimately foundered because the task\nwas deemed too difficult. History and archaeology also figured prominently in Reza\nKhan\u2019s nation-building program. Looking to weaken Iran\u2019s connection with its immediate\nMuslim past, he instituted a public-school curriculum that emphasized the country\u2019s rich,\npre-Islamic history. Likewise, he sponsored archaeological digs designed to connect\nIran to earlier dynasties such as the Achaemenids and Parthians, and he insisted that\nnewly constructed public buildings reference pre-Islamic architectural styles.102\n100 Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, 477\u201378; Abrahamian, A History of Modern\nIran, 84\u201385.\n101 Keddie, Modern Iran, 91\u2013100; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 77\u201383.\n102 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 86\u201387. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 344\nHe followed with a successful campaign to change Iran\u2019s international image. In\n1935, his government formally requested that the Western states cease referring to his\ncountry as Persia and instead begin calling it Iran\u2014a term derived from the word Aryan.\nDoing so would achieve two ends. Domestically, it would deepen the country\u2019s\nconnection to its ancient, pre-Islamic past and thus help to foster a distinct national\nidentity. Second, by casting Iranians as members of the Aryan race, it would elevate his\npeople\u2019s relative standing in the Western racial hierarchies that loomed so large in the\ninterwar period.103\n\u201cModernization from above\u201d cleaved most closely to the Kemalist program in its\npursuit of economic development. Like Ataturk, Reza Khan promoted a state-led, ISI-\ndevelopment model in which domestic factories sheltered by protective tariffs produced\ngoods for import substitution. He laid the basis for this program in 1927 by unilaterally\nabrogating the nineteenth-century era unequal treaties that had accorded extraterritorial\nprivileges to Westerners and had limited Iran\u2019s customs duties to 5 percent. He followed\nin 1933 by creating two holding companies\u2014the Agricultural and Industrial Banks\u2014and\nby tasking them with determining how state-raised capital could best be allocated for\neconomic development. Between their establishment and 1941, they underwrote the\nconstruction of more than three-hundred factories, mills, and refineries and thus helped\nIran acquire the ability to produce both durable materials like cement and lumber and\nconsumer goods such as cigarettes, sugar, processed foods, textiles, glass, soap, and\nmatches. Concurrently, the state laid thousands of kilometers of roads to link Iran into a\nsingle, unified market. Finally, it imposed taxes on tea and sugar to finance the\nconstruction of the north-south, Trans-Iranian Railway.104\nThough Reza Khan trumpeted his \u201cmodernization from above\u201d program as a\ngreat achievement, it was, in reality, a mixed success at best. On the positive side, his\ncampaign had fostered the development of a bourgeoisie, secured limited emancipation\nfor women, improved transportation infrastructure, and provided almost all of the\ncountry\u2019s cities with at-least limited electrical power. More importantly, it had succeeded\nin unifying Iran and at replacing tribal and ethnic identities with an Iranian nationalist\none. At the same time, however, Reza Khan\u2019s reform program had a number of\nsubstantial shortcomings. Politically, it had imposed a despotic government on Iran and\nhad cleaved the country into \u201c\u2018two cultures\u2019\u201d: a small, wealthy, Westernized class of\nbureaucrats, military officers, professionals, and businesspeople and a much larger and\npoorer traditional one of bazaar merchants, clerics, and peasants. Economically,\nmeanwhile, his development program had failed utterly to live up to his promises.\nMarred by corruption, Iran\u2019s nascent industrial sector was inefficient, uncompetitive, and\nexploitive of labor; it also produced goods that were\u2014as is typical in cases of ISI\ndevelopment\u2014both shoddier and substantially more expensive than the imports that\nthey replaced.105\n103 Garthwaite, The Persians, 229; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 86\u201388.\n104 Quote from Keddie, Modern Iran, 95\u2013102; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 77.\n105 Garthwaite, The Persians, 228; Keddie, Modern Iran, 95\u2013103. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 345\nReza Khan\u2019s biggest failure, however, was his inability to achieve a favorable\nrevision of the terms of the APOC oil concession. Like other Iranian nationalists, the\nshah was dissatisfied with nearly every part of the agreement. He was unhappy that it\ndid not supply Iran with a minimum royalty payment, upset with the company\u2019s\ndiscriminatory labor practices, and, above all, angry that the British state earned\nsubstantially more from the sale of his nation\u2019s oil than did his government. Accordingly,\nin the early 1930s, he insisted on opening negotiations with APOC aimed at altering the\nterms of the concession in Iran\u2019s favor. The discussions went nowhere. While the\ncompany was willing to talk, it was unwilling to make more than cosmetic changes to the\nterms of the concession and was adamant that the profit-sharing arrangement could not\nbe altered. Frustrated, Reza Khan broke off the discussions in 1932 and announced\nthat Iran would unilaterally annul the D\u2019Arcy concession and assume control of the oil\nfields.106\nThis threat finally got APOC and the British government\u2019s attention. At their\nrequest, talks recommenced in 1933. They soon produced a revised agreement that\ncalled for Britain to grant a larger share of the profits to Tehran and to train more\nIranians for skilled positions in the oil fields\u2014terms that Reza Khan trumpeted as a\ngreat victory for his country. In reality, as many Iranians grasped, the renegotiated\narrangement was a poor agreement for his state that offered little more than minor\nalterations to the terms of the original concession. Most notably, it only raised Iran\u2019s\nshare of the profits from an anemic 16 percent to a marginally better 20 percent\u2014an\nincrease that APOC\u2019s creative accounting succeeded in substantially reducing.\nLikewise, it offered no more than symbolic changes to the company\u2019s discriminatory\nemployment practices. Perhaps worst of all, Reza Khan was only able to win those\nmodification to the original deal by agreeing to extend the concession\u2019s term by thirty-\ntwo years, thus giving Britain control of Iran\u2019s oil through 1993.107\nReza Khan\u2019s inability to secure a meaningful revision of the APOC concession\nleft him embittered and led him to gradually drift toward Britain\u2019s rival, Germany. Iran\u2019s\nrelationship with the Third Reich blossomed quickly\u2014particularly in the area of trade.\nIndeed, commerce between the two countries grew so rapidly over the next few years\nthat Germany displaced Britain as Iran\u2019s largest trading partner by the end of the\ndecade. Tehran\u2019s ties with Berlin did not remain limited to the economic sphere for long,\nmoreover. Seeing Nazi Germany as a potential counterweight to Britain, Reza Shah\nmoved to strengthen political relations during the late 1930s. He permitted German\nintelligence operatives free rein in Iran, pursued a series of diplomatic policies\nsupportive of Berlin, and even appropriated Nazi racial and nationalist views.108\n106 Ervand Abrahamian, The Coup: 1953, the CIA, and the Roots of Modern U.S.-\nIranian Relations, Reprint edition (The New Press, 2013), 28\u201329.\n107 Abrahamian, 28\u201329.\n108 Keddie, Modern Iran, 98\u2013101. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 346\nWorld War II and Reza Shah\u2019s Abdication\nReza Khan\u2019s dalliance with Hitler\u2019s Germany proved to be his downfall. During\nthe early part of World War II, Britain had been willing to tolerate his passive animosity\nand tacitly pro-German position. Hitler\u2019s invasion of the USSR in June 1941 drastically\naltered Iran\u2019s standing in the Allies\u2019 strategic calculus, however. Providing an important\nroute for the shipment of desperately needed war materiel and resources to the Soviet\nUnion, it was thereafter too important of a country to leave in the hands of someone as\nunreliable as Reza Shah. Accordingly, the USSR and Britain launched a bloodless\ninvasion in August 1941 in which they assumed control of Iran and deposed the\nunreliable shah. Joined by the United States after it entered the war, the occupying\npowers followed by using the Trans-Iranian Railroad to ship war materiel to the USSR.\nMoscow and London did not, however, end the Pahlavi Dynasty. Instead, they arranged\nfor Reza Khan\u2019s twenty-one-year-old son, Muhammad Reza (r. 1941-1979), to replace\nhis father on the throne.109\nYoung and inexperienced, the new shah lacked the force of will or the political\nskills to take control of his country; as a result, a power vacuum emerged in Tehran.\nTaking advantage, a variety of organizations and groups were able to assert themselves\nculturally and politically. Some were established ones that Reza Khan had suppressed.\nMost notably, the clerics exploited the shah\u2019s deposition to win back control of both the\nawqaf that financially sustained them and the religious schools that the government had\nnationalized; in so doing, they were able to restore much of the autonomy that they had\nlost in the \u201cModernization from Above\u201d program. Other groups that gained prominence\nat this time were new. One of the most important of them was the Soviet-supported, far-\nleft Tudeh Party. Thanks to its support for unionization and call for aggressive land\nreform, it quickly gained the backing of most workers, many intellectuals, and some\npeasants. It even secured the support of a significant portion of the Westernized middle\nclass.110\nPostwar Crises\nThe instability continued in the years immediately following World War II as Iran\nbecame embroiled in an early dispute in the emerging Cold War. The crisis was a\nproduct of Moscow\u2019s territorial and economic aspirations. As per the agreements that\ngoverned the occupation, British and American soldiers withdrew from Iran within six\nmonths of the conflict\u2019s conclusion. The USSR did not follow suit, however. Instead,\nleaving its troops in place as leverage, it set up pro-Soviet separatist Azerbaijani and\nKurdish republics in the northeast and demanded that Tehran grant it a highly favorable\nconcession to exploit oil deposits in Iran\u2019s northern provinces. Given the power\n109 Amanat, Iran, 493\u201399.\n110 Garthwaite, The Persians, 235\u201337. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 347\nimbalance between it and the USSR, Iran appeared to have little choice but to capitulate\nto these demands.111\nInstead, its savvy prime minister, Ahmad Qavam (1874-1955), managed to deftly\nmaneuver his country through the crisis. He did so in stages. First, he negotiated an\nagreement that seemed to meet most of Moscow\u2019s demands. In exchange for the\nwithdrawal of Soviet troops, he agreed to respect the autonomy of the Kurdish and\nAzerbaijani republics and to submit a bill to the majlis granting the USSR an oil\nconcession. It looked like a good deal for Moscow, which responded by promptly pulling\nthe Red Army from Iran. Qavam followed the Soviet withdrawal by implementing the\nsecond phase of his plan, which involved crushing the Kurdish and Azerbaijani republics\nand their leftist governments. Moscow was unhappy with this move but was willing to\ntolerate Tehran\u2019s betrayal so long as it got its oil concession. Here, too, however,\nQavam double crossed the Soviets. Aware all along that strident nationalist sentiment\nrendered the oil-concession bill a dead letter in the majlis, he effected the final stage of\nhis plan in October 1947 when he formally submitted the legislation only to see it quickly\nand predictably go down to defeat\u2014thus permitting Iran to meet the obligations of its\nagreement with Moscow while simultaneously freeing it from having to make any real\nconcessions.112\nThe crisis significantly altered the political balance in Iran in two ways. First, it\ngreatly weakened the heretofore rapidly growing Tudeh Party. While the party had\nachieved new levels of popularity as a result of a successful strike it had organized\nagainst APOC in the spring of 1946, the party\u2019s willingness to defend the USSR\u2019s\nactions in Iran severely damaged its nationalist credentials and cost it much of its\nsupport. Second, the crisis solidified the emerging view in Washington that Iran was a\ncritical component of its broader Cold War effort to contain the USSR and thus spurred\nthe US to step up its engagement with the country. Notably, Washington agreed in 1947\nto extend the terms of an existing military advisory mission under the command of\nColonel Norman Schwarzkopf (1895-1958) and to provide Iran with $60 million in\nmilitary aid.113\nConclusion\nAs Iran\u2019s experience makes clear, the interwar period was a challenging time for\nthe sovereign states of the Middle East. During that period, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and\nTurkey struggled to transform themselves into stable, fully independent nation-states\nand to develop their economies. These were difficult enough goals to achieve on their\nown, but they were rendered even more challenging by the huge power imbalance that\nexisted between those states and the Western powers. Indeed, Iran proved unable to\nmaintain its independence in the face of Allied pressure during World War II while Saudi\n111 Barry Rubin, Paved with Good Intentions: The American Experience and Iran (New\nYork: Oxford University Press, 1980), 33\u201335.\n112 Rubin, 33\u201335.\n113 Keddie, Modern Iran, 113\u201314. Chapter Eleven: The Independent States, 1923-1948 Page 348\nArabia was compelled to settle for a smaller share of the profits generated by its oil\nwealth than did either Aramco or the US government. Even Turkey had to walk a very\ncareful line to retain its independence during the Second World War. Still, even with\nthese limits, the citizens and subjects of these states enjoyed vastly greater autonomy\nthan did the majority of the people of the Middle East, who lived not under independent\ngovernments but instead under de facto European colonial rule. It is to their very\ndifferent situation and their efforts to change it that we shall next turn. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948\nWhen the dust cleared from the final peace settlement in the early 1920s, France\nand Britain had emerged as the masters of nearly the entire Arab world. Paris directly\ngoverned Lebanon and Syria, while London, in keeping with its indirect colonial\napproach, controlled Egypt and the mandates of Transjordan and Iraq through local\nrulers.1 The imperial powers did not formally rule these territories as permanent\ncolonies, however. Instead, on the basis of the mandatory agreements into which they\nhad entered\u2014or, in the case of Egypt, the public statements of policy they had made\u2014\nFrance and Britain administered those places on a temporary basis. Moreover, at\nPresident Woodrow Wilson\u2019s (r. 1913-1921) insistence, Paris and London had formally\ncommitted themselves to preparing the peoples they ruled in the Middle East for\neventual self-government.\nThey did not honor that obligation. Instead, seeking to turn their new possessions\nin the region into permanent\u2014if nominally independent\u2014neo-colonies, the imperial\nstates hindered the emergence of effective governments and eschewed making any\nreal effort to help the Arab states develop the close connection between citizens and\ngovernment on which genuine legitimacy ultimately rests. Worse, in several cases, they\nbequeathed to the Arab governments substantial coercive capacities designed to permit\nthose states to maintain order.\nParis and London possessed the most power and thus had the biggest impact on\npolitical developments in those territories, but they were not alone in inhibiting the\ndevelopment of effective governments in the region. Indigenous groups including\ngreedy elites, populist extremist organizations, and, especially, autocratic military\nofficers also pursued policies that interfered with the development of popular, stable\ngovernments. Coupled with the self-interested approach of the imperial powers, the\nactions of these groups ensured that Egypt and the Arab mandates emerged from\nWorld War II not as secure, self-governing countries, but instead as unstable and\nundemocratic states\u2014ones that were simultaneously powerful due to their possession\nof substantial coercive capacities and weak owing to their lack of legitimacy and\nabsence of close connections with the people they ruled.\nIraq: Quasi Independence\nIraq\u2019s experience between the end of the First World War and the conclusion of\nWorld War II was emblematic of this story. On the surface, the country appeared to be\nan interwar success. As the mandatory power, Britain had provided it with modern\npolitical institutions and had even granted it its independence in 1932. A charter\n1 Britain was also the mandatory power for Palestine. We will examine that territory\nseparately in the next chapter. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 350\nmember of the United Nations, Iraq seemed to have become a stable member of the\ninternational order by the end of the Second World War.\nIn fact, Iraq emerged from that conflict a deeply troubled country. That it did so\nwas largely a function of London\u2019s self-interested administration. During its time as the\nmandatory power, Britain had imposed a variety of political, economic, military, and\nsocial policies on Iraq that were designed to serve its imperial interests rather than the\nneeds of the Iraqi people. Collectively, they ensured that this multi-ethnic, multi-\nconfessional country failed to develop the strong civic-political culture\u2014meaning a\nsense of identity with the state and an acceptance of its legitimate power\u2014that modern\npolities need to function effectively. The British certainly bore primary responsibility for\nIraq\u2019s warped development, but they were not solely culpable for its failure to cultivate a\nrobust civic-political culture. Drawing on the values they had acquired in Ottoman\nmilitary academies, the Sunni elite that dominated Iraq in the 1930s also contributed to\nthe country\u2019s fractured political development by promoting an authoritarian and\nmilitarized conception of the state, and by affording the numerically larger Kurdish and\nShi\u02bfi Arab people with little power or even sense of belonging in the national community.\nMandatory Iraq, 1922-1932\nThe peculiar contours of the Iraqi state first took shape under indirect imperial\nrule during the mandatory period. They emerged as a result of Britain\u2019s pursuit of two\nbroad objectives for the country. First, it acted to prepare Iraq for self-government as\nrequired by the League of Nations\u2019 mandate. Second, and far more important, it also\nsought to ensure that Iraq would remain an informal British colony after it had secured\nits independence. That these two goals were clearly in conflict was not obvious to\nBritish officials at the time. On the contrary, they perceived them to be complementary\nin nature.\nOn the surface, Britain achieved a great deal for the country during its brief\ntenure as the mandatory power. Drawing on its long history of representative\ngovernment, it helped nurture the key institutions needed for Iraq to function as a\ndemocratic state. Under Britain\u2019s tutelage, Iraq acquired a constitution, an elected\nparliament, a military, a constitutional monarch in the form of the Hashimite leader of the\nArab Revolt, Faysal I (r. 1921-1933), and the sinews of an administrative state. Britain\nalso helped to ensure the development of Iraq\u2019s economy by persuading the League of\nNations to assign the disputed vilayet of Mosul and its substantial oil reserves to Iraq\ninstead of Turkey in 1925, and it established a new way of assuring internal stability\nthrough the use of cost-effective air power rather than through the maintenance of an\nexpensive conscription army.2\n2 Phebe Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, Second Edition (Boulder: Routledge, 2004),\n21, 24\u201326, 30\u201331; Toby Dodge, Inventing Iraq: The Failure of Nation-Building and a\nHistory Denied (New York: Columbia University Press, 2003), 132\u201336. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 351\nBritish officials also made sweeping changes to the political, legal, and economic\nstructure of rural Iraq intended to secure the interests of its tribal people. In doing so,\nthey drew on the extensive historical and anthropological knowledge they had acquired\nmanaging a huge, globe-spanning empire. Noting the similarity between rural Iraqis and\nthe reputedly fierce-but-honorable Pathan people of the northwest frontier region of\nBritain\u2019s India colony, British officials devised a romantic construction of the Iraqi\ntribespeople that held that, like their Pathan counterparts, the people of rural Iraq were\n\u201c\u2018noble savages\u2019\u201d who were uncorrupted by civilization. In the eyes of the British, this\nwas a mixed blessing for the rural Iraqis. That is, while their closeness to nature left\nthem admirably honest and innately good, it also rendered them too naive and\ncredulous to avoid being exploited by the town Arabs whom racist colonial officers\nperceived as being wily and cynical. This situation deeply troubled British officials. How,\nthey asked themselves, could they safeguard the noble-but-simple tribespeople from\ntheir unscrupulous, urban neighbors?3\nWhile anthropological knowledge of the subcontinent raised the need to protect\nthe tribespeople, familiarity with their own history led the British to a solution to this\nproblem. Looking back on the role that the rural gentry had played in guarding peasants\nfrom an absolutist government under the Tudor monarchs, they reasoned that a\ncomparable class of landlords could shield the mandate\u2019s benighted tribal people by\nsimilarly interceding between them and the state. Fortunately for the British, rural Iraq\nseemed to have an existing class of leaders that they believed could, if properly\nstrengthened, satisfy that need: the shaykhs who served as tribal leaders. Accordingly,\nthe mandatory government gave them the tools needed to serve as a mediating force. It\ngranted the shaykhs judicial power over the people of their tribes, made them\nresponsible for tax collection and the maintenance of order, and, most critically,\nassigned them legal title to land that the tribes had heretofore held on a communal\nbasis.4\nIndependence, 1932\nIraqi independence came quickly. Committed to a balanced budget, Britain was\neager to shed itself of expenses\u2014even the comparatively minimal costs it incurred as\nthe mandatory power in Iraq. Accordingly, London opened talks with Faysal I\u2019s\ngovernment in 1929 aimed at establishing Iraq as an independent state while\nsimultaneously ensuring Britain\u2019s interests. Signed in 1932, the resulting accord seemed\nbeneficial for both parties. By its terms, Iraq gained its independence and assumed a\nseat at the League of Nations; in exchange, Britain secured control of strategic airbases\nat Habbaniya near Baghdad and at Shuaiba in the south, as well as the right to move\ntroops through Iraq during time of war. It also won the exclusive right to supply Iraq with\n3 William R. Polk, Understanding Iraq (New York: Harper Perennial, 2005), 21, 24\u201326,\n30\u201331.\n4 Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 46, 63. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 352\nmilitary advisors and equipment. The terms of the treaty were to last for twenty-five\nyears.5\nWith the signing of the agreement, Britain appeared to have brought the mandate\nto a successful conclusion for all parties. Baghdad had won its independence\u2014the first\nof the mandates to do so\u2014and seemed to possess the institutional infrastructure\nneeded to function as a sovereign state. For its part, meanwhile, London had secured\nits key strategic goals in Iraq for at least the next few decades.\nProblems\nReality most certainly did not match appearances, however. Britain had\nstructured Iraq based on a set of assumptions and preconceived notions that proved\nwildly inaccurate, and it had imposed policies that worked to ensure its short-term\ninterests at the expense of Iraq\u2019s long-term needs. The result was the emergence of a\ndeeply flawed and troubled country\u2014one with a society riven by exploitation and\ninequality, a state that was little more than a fa\u00e7ade behind which self-interested elite\nfactions struggled over the division of the spoils, and a dominant Sunni, pan-Arabist\npolitical ideology that afforded little place for the country\u2019s millions of Kurds and Shi\u02bfa.\nThese outcomes were the product of a number of internal and external forces. However,\nfour British actions during the mandatory period proved particularly important in\nproducing them: its handling of the negotiations over Mosul, its reliance on airpower to\nensure order, its elevation of the tribal shaykhs to a position of authority, and its\ninsistence on an independence treaty that left Iraq in a state of neocolonial\ndependence.6\nThe disposition of Mosul reflected most clearly how London pursued its interests\nat the expense of Baghdad, and how, in the process, it weakened and delegitimated the\nIraqi state. Britain had administered the former Ottoman vilayet of Mosul through the\nIraq mandate since the end of World War I. As we saw in chapter ten, however, it had\nagreed at Turkish insistence to defer the issue of its final disposition to the League of\nNations. Thus, whether oil-rich Mosul would\u2014or would not\u2014be part of Iraq remained\nvery much an open question during the mid 1920s.7\nIn the meantime, an important event was taking place in the oil industry that\nwould, to the detriment of Iraq, intersect with the question of Mosul\u2019s disposition. In a\ncomplex series of negotiations, a consortium of oil companies had assumed control of\nthe German and Ottoman shares of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC)\u2014renamed\nthe Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) in 1929\u2014and had thus acquired the exclusive right\nto find and exploit oil in the territory of the former Ottoman Empire. The consortium was\nan international one, consisting of the French Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles,\n5 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 34\u201336.\n6 Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 31.\n7 Zara Steiner, The Lights That Failed: European International History 1919-1933\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), 120\u201322. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 353\nBritain\u2019s Anglo-Persian Oil Company, British-controlled Royal Dutch Shell, and a group\nof five American firms headed by Standard Oil of New Jersey. Each party received a\n23.75 percent share of the TPC, with the remainder going to the Armenian\nbusinessperson Calouste \u201c\u2018Mr. Five Percent\u2019\u201d Gulbenkian (1889-1955), who had put the\noriginal TPC consortium together in 1912. Critically, the constituent companies in the\nTPC agreed to adhere to a self-denial clause known as the Red Line Agreement that\nbound them to pursue concessions in the territory of the former Ottoman Empire on a\njoint basis through the TPC. Applying to Iraq, this provision had the effect of limiting\ncompetition for the right to exploit oil in Mosul and thus helped to depress the price of\nthe concession that the TPC negotiated with Baghdad in 1925.8\nStill, the consortium faced the undesirable prospect of having to share a\nsubstantial portion of the profits on any oil found in Mosul with the Iraqi government.\nThis situation stemmed from an agreement negotiated in 1920 that had allocated to\nBaghdad not merely a portion of the profits but also a twenty percent ownership share\nof any oil produced in Iraq by the TPC. London had accepted that arrangement in the\nearly 1920s, but it had, for two reasons, become unalterably opposed to it by mid-\ndecade. First, an ownership position would result in Baghdad receiving a substantially\nlarger share of the profits than was the case in similar states. Second, and more\nimportantly, an ownership stake would give Iraq a voice in setting production rates and\nprices and would thus establish a dangerous precedent that other producing countries\nmight seek to follow.9\nAs British officials were well aware, however, they possessed a powerful card\nthat they could\u2014and did\u2014play to block Baghdad from participating in the management\nof the concession. It involved the negotiations with Turkey. Exploiting its role as the\nmandatory power, London threatened to inform the League of Nations that it was willing\nto cede the vilayet of Mosul to Turkey if the Iraqi government did not abandon its\nownership stake. This move was heavy handed and imperialistic, but it was also\neffective. Unwilling to risk the loss of Mosul and its oil, Faysal I reluctantly agreed to\nrelinquish Iraq\u2019s 20 percent ownership position in the TPC in favor of a modest increase\nin royalty payments and a British promise to work aggressively to keep the vilayet in\nIraq.10\nBritain\u2019s hardball approach to Mosul adversely affected Iraq\u2019s political and\neconomic development in two critical ways. First, it resulted in the country receiving a\nsubstantially smaller share of the TPC\u2019s profits following the discovery of oil near Kirkuk\nin 1927 than it would have received had it retained its ownership position. As a result,\ninterwar Iraq was perpetually starved of the funds needed to promote economic\n8 William Stivers, \u201cA Note on the Red Line Agreement,\u201d Diplomatic History 7, no. 1\n(January 1983): 23\u201324; Quote from Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil,\nMoney & Power (New York: Touchstone Books, 1991), 187.\n9 Charles Tripp, A History of Iraq (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 58\u2013\n60.\n10 Tripp, 58\u201360.

Second, Britain\u2019s ability to compel Faysal I\u2019s government to yield its\nownership position made abundantly clear the degree to which the monarchy was\nsubordinate to London and thus undermined the credibility of the Iraqi state in the eyes\nof its people.11\nBritain\u2019s strategy of using airplanes to enforce internal order similarly warped Iraq\nand delegitimated its state. As we saw in chapter ten, the use of aircraft in the mandate\nhad its roots in the financial constraints that London faced in the immediate aftermath of\nthe First World War. Determined to return to a balanced budget, the British government\nhad sought at that time to aggressively trim the cost of its empire\u2014including the\nexpenses it incurred in Iraq. Effecting a significant reduction in the cost of the Iraq\nmandate seemed nearly impossible, however. Not only was it a large country and thus\nexpensive to police, but it had already been the scene of a major rebellion\u2014one that\nhad required an expensive deployment of troops to bring under control. Indeed, Iraq had\nbecome so costly that some officials had given serious thought to abandoning it\naltogether.12\nAs we saw in chapter ten, Secretary of State for the Colonies Winston Churchill\n(1874-1965) was not among them. Determined to keep the mandate, he and his\nadvisors had determined in 1921 that Britain could retain control of it at an acceptable\ncost through the use of airplanes. Inexpensive yet powerful, aircraft and the threat of\nbombing would both ensure order and compel the heretofore autonomous rural tribes to\npay the taxes that the mandatory government imposed; their use would thus make\nBritain\u2019s presence in Iraq financially self-sustaining.13\nThe approach worked. Indeed, from London\u2019s perspective, the employment of\nairpower to coerce rural Iraqis appeared to be one of the great successes of its Middle\nEast policy in the early 1920s. It not only compelled obedience from the tribespeople\u2014\njust as Churchill had argued that it would\u2014but it also all-but eliminated the cost of\nmaintaining order in the mandate. As a result, Britain was able to retain possession of\nIraq in a way that was consistent with its commitment to a balanced budget.14\nThe reliance on air power may have served Britain\u2019s financial interests, but it ran\ndiametrically counter to Baghdad\u2019s political goals. Intent on nation building\u2014that is, on\ncreating a shared sense of national identity\u2014Faysal I\u2019s government had been pushing\nfor the development of a large conscription-based army that would bring multiple\nbenefits. First, such a force would provide the state with the means both to defend itself\nfrom external attack and to maintain internal order. Equally important, it would also help\nto inculcate in the Iraqi people a shared sense of identity with the Hashimite monarchy\nand the state, thereby helping to tie Faysal I\u2019s heterogenous country together into a\n11 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 30\u201331.\n12 Christopher Catherwood, Churchill\u2019s Folly: How Winston Churchill Created Modern\nIraq (New York: Basic Books, 2005), 94\u2013103.\n13 Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 131.\n14 Polk, Understanding Iraq, 83\u201384. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 355\ncoherent whole. It was a sound, if expensive, proposal. As such, it was incompatible\nwith Britain\u2019s desire to control costs. Accordingly, London rejected it outright and instead\ncontinued to depend on airpower for security through the early 1930s.15\nThis decision had profound implications. The absence of a conscription army\nmeant that the Iraqi state lacked an important institution for forging a nation out of its\ndivergent ethnic and confessional groups\u2014one that could have helped it to develop the\n\u201cimagined political community\u201d that is so essential to a shared sense of identity.\nMeanwhile, the use of airplanes to enforce internal order and compel the payment of\ntaxes meant that the state\u2019s connection with its subjects rested, at root, on violence and\nintimidation rather than on positive interactions that might bind the people to the\ngovernment and help to create a positive civic-political culture. In other words, Britain\u2019s\ndecision about the nature of the Iraqi military meant that Faysal I\u2019s government would\nhold substantial coercive capacities but would lack the positive connections with the\npeople on which genuine legitimacy ultimately rests. This reliance on what the scholar\nToby Dodge calls \u201cdespotic state power\u201d at the expense of a broad popular mandate\nwould cast long shadows. Thereafter, nearly all subsequent Iraqi governments\neschewed any meaningful effort to win the consent of the governed and instead ruled by\nmeans of brute force.16\nMeanwhile, the effort to protect the rural tribespeople from the presumably\nrapacious town Arabs also created lasting issues that undermined Iraq\u2019s political\ndevelopment. The problem here stemmed from the fact that the historical and\nanthropological analogies that British officials had drawn on in approaching the mandate\nwere almost comically off the mark and had led them to implement policies that\nradically\u2014and detrimentally\u2014reshaped the structure of Iraqi society. The shaykhs were\nnot, as the British had assumed, powerful, charismatic figures who represented the will\nof the tribes; rather, they were first-among-equals whose authority rarely extended\nbeyond the power of persuasion. London\u2019s decision to vest judicial power in these men\nand, more importantly, to grant them title to tribal land thus did not reinforce existing\npractices; rather, it imposed a top-down social revolution on rural Iraq that turned these\nweak figures of tenuous influence into a powerful class of landlords whose authority\nultimately rested on the coercive power of the state. The consequences were\nsubstantial. In short order, rural Iraqis fell into thrall to the landlord-shaykhs and their\nfinancial backers, the town Arabs\u2014the very class, ironically, from whom the British had\nsought to protect the tribespeople. The passage of the Law Governing the Rights and\nDuties of Cultivators in 1933 confirmed these momentous changes. Imposing draconian\nrestrictions on the ability of indebted peasants to move and binding them to the land,\n15 Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 136\u201341.\n16 First quote from Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the\nOrigin and Spread of Nationalism, Revised edition (London: Verso, 2006), 6; Second\nquote from Dodge, Inventing Iraq, 145. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 356\nthis sweeping law allowed the shaykhs to complete the enserfment of the heretofore\nfree tribespeople that British policy had inadvertently started.17\nUnsurprisingly, the attempt by London to restructure Iraqi society based on\nflawed historical and anthropological assumptions adversely affected the mandate\u2019s\ndevelopment. It did so in two ways. First, it warped the country\u2019s already unstable\npolitical system. The transformation of the shaykhs into a politically and economically\npowerful class helped fuel the emergence of an oligarchic system of government in\nwhich competing factions composed of well-connected political figures, newly\nempowered landlord-shaykhs, and affluent town Arabs competed for access to the\nlevers of power on which the acquisition of new wealth depended. Thanks to British\nactions, in other words, Iraq ended up with a government of and for the elite rather than\none attuned to the needs of ordinary Iraqis. Second, Britain\u2019s efforts to restructure Iraqi\nsociety dramatically widened economic inequality in the country and, as a consequence,\nhelped to create deep-seated feelings of bitterness and resentment\u2014particularly among\nthe tribespeople who increasingly fled the shaykhs\u2019 exploitation by moving to the\nshantytowns then popping up on the outskirts of the country\u2019s cities.18\nMuch like the social revolution that Britain had inadvertently effected among the\ntribespeople, so the treaty that established Iraq as an independent state would create\nbroad resentment in key groups that would come to undermine the state\u2019s legitimacy.\nThe agreement was not without its supporters. Some, including Faysal I, the court\nfaction headed by the important politician Nuri Said (1888-1958), and many of the\nlandlord-shaykhs, continued to perceive value in the connection with Britain and thus\nsaw the treaty as a beneficial one for their country. In contrast, many other politically\nconscious Iraqis viewed it as an embarrassingly unequal agreement that rendered their\ncountry little more than an informal British colony. Educated Sunnis, especially those in\nthe armed forces, were particularly furious about it and the privileges it accorded to\nBritain. They bitterly resented London\u2019s continued role advising the government and\narmed forces, railed about its dominance of Iraq\u2019s economy, loudly complained about its\nretention of airbases, and fiercely assailed its right to move troops through the country\nduring time of war. Unsurprisingly, there emerged among them a stridently nationalist\nand anti-imperialist sentiment and a deep skepticism about a government that they\nperceived to be a collaborationist one.19\nThus, thanks to a mix of ignorance and self-interest, London\u2019s brief tenure as the\nmandatory power left a destructive legacy for Iraq. It is true that British officials had\nprovided the country with the critical institutions needed to function as a modern state\nand that they moved quickly to grant Iraq its independence. However, those positive\nsteps need to be balanced against the fact that Britain\u2019s pursuit of self-interested\npolicies had saddled Iraq with an exploitive elite and an oppressive state that lacked\npositive connections to the people. The result was a country hobbled by tremendous\n17 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 51\u201352, 84\u201385.\n18 Tripp, 75\u201378, 84\u201385.\n19 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 34\u201336, 40. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 357\ninequality, class conflict, seething resentment toward the British, widespread alienation\ntoward a political system that relied on its coercive powers to compel obedience, and\nthe absence of a shared sense of national identity\u2014conditions that were hardly\nconducive to stable political development.20\nThe Army in Politics\nThe British continued to exert a great deal of influence over Iraq following its\nindependence, but they no longer enjoyed mastery over the country as they had before\n1932. Instead, with the tacit support of the youthful new king, Ghazi (r. 1933-1939), the\nSunni-dominated officer corps quickly displaced both London and the civilian factions as\nthe primary force in Iraqi politics. The army\u2019s political ascendency ultimately proved to\nbe short-lived, but its enthusiastic embrace of authoritarianism and its aggressive\npromotion of a Sunni-dominated, secular, Arab-nationalist state\u2014what the scholar Vali\nNasr calls \u201cthe secularization of Sunni political identity\u201d\u2014would adversely shape Iraq\nthrough the end of the twentieth century.21\nThe Sunni Arab officers and bureaucrats who dominated Iraq in the 1930s held a\ncommon vision for their country\u2019s future rooted in their shared Ottoman background.\nEducated in the military academies of the late empire, these veterans of the Committee\nfor Union and Progress\u2019s (CUP) autocratic regime had little use for liberal, British-\nsupported political concepts like representative government or civil rights\u2014particularly if\nthose practices enfranchised Kurds and Shi\u02bfa\u2014and instead hoped to modernize Iraq\nalong authoritarian and militarized lines. Accordingly, once they had assumed a\ndominant political position, they instituted a stridently pan-Arab nationalist curriculum in\nthe schools, promoted centralization, dismissed democracy as a distraction that would\nweaken the state, and established a conscription-based military. While they rejected\nBritain\u2019s liberal political ideas, however, they enthusiastically embraced the coercive\npowers that London had given the Iraqi state and freely used them to enforce both the\ncentral government\u2019s authority and Sunni social and political dominance. Thus, the Iraqi\nmilitary brutally suppressed Kurdish and Assyrian Christian insurgencies in the mid\n1930s and made liberal use of aerial bombing to bring revolting Shi\u02bfi tribes to heel.22\nEmboldened by its success suppressing these uprisings, the military dramatically\nintensified its involvement in politics in the mid 1930s. This process started in 1936,\nwhen General Bakr Sidqi (1890-1937), a Kurd, used the army to support a coup that\nmade the reformer Hikmat Sulayman (1889-1964) prime minister and installed members\nof a radical faction called the Ahali group in the cabinet. Seeking to dramatically\nrestructure the country, Sulayman\u2019s government immediately pressed for a series of\n20 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 74\u201376.\n21 Tripp, 77\u201382; Vali Nasr, The Shia Revival: How Conflicts within Islam Will Shape the\nFuture (New York: W.

Norton, 2006), 92.\n22 Michael Provence, \u201cStateless Revolutionaries and the Aftermath of the Ottoman\nGreat War,\u201d Journal of Modern European History 13, no. 3 (2015): 404\u201311; Marr, The\nModern History of Iraq, 39\u201344. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 358\nsweeping changes that were designed to end Iraq\u2019s severe economic and political\ninequality, such as the legalization of unions and the repeal of the Law Governing the\nRights and Duties of Cultivators. These proposals went nowhere thanks to the\nopposition of the more conservative Sidqi. However, the general did enthusiastically\nthrow his support behind Sulayman\u2019s promotion of a new, broader construction of Iraqi\nnationalism that was inclusive of Shi\u02bfa and Kurds as well as the prime minister\u2019s \u201c\u2018Iraq\nfirst\u2019\u201d foreign policy that downplayed pan-Arabism in favor of closer ties to Turkey and\nIran.23\nThose last initiatives proved to be the regime\u2019s downfall. Angry that Sidqi had\nabandoned pan-Arabism in favor of a more inclusive conception of national identity, a\ngroup of Sunni army officers assassinated the general in 1937. Thereafter, the\nincreasingly emboldened officer corps made regular use of violence and coups\u2014six\noccurred between 1936 and 1941\u2014to compel successive civilian cabinets to adhere to\ntheir authoritarian, Sunni, pan-Arabist vision for Iraq.24\nThe Coup of 1941\nRegional and global events soon put the Sunni officers and the British on a\ncollision course. Opposition to London\u2019s continued dominance had surged to new\nheights among Sunni nationalists in the late 1930s in response to Britain\u2019s violent\nsuppression of an Arab uprising in Palestine and its subsequent proposal to partition\nthat territory into Jewish and Palestinian states. Keenly aware of the vast power\nimbalance that existed between Baghdad and London, however, the officers understood\nthat any effort to try to force the British out would be a fool\u2019s errand. Thus, though they\nfumed, they made no meaningful attempt to challenge London\u2019s position in Iraq during\nthe late 1930s. Germany\u2019s spectacular success during the early stages of World War II\nappeared to change the political calculus, however. Not only did the Third Reich\u2019s\nvictories seem to indicate that London\u2019s power was in eclipse, but they also suggested\nthat the nationalists could secure help from Berlin in their efforts to expel Britain. In\nresponse, a clique of officers known as the Golden Square began to lay plans for a\nmove against London\u2019s position in Iraq.25\nEven as the outbreak of the war seemed to create opportunities for the Sunni\nnationalists, however, it also powerfully reinforced Britain\u2019s determination to retain a\ndominant position in Iraq. Indeed, the global nature of the war had dramatically\nheightened the country\u2019s importance in London\u2019s strategic calculations. Not only did\nIraqi oil fuel Britain\u2019s critically important Mediterranean fleet, but its territory also served\nas a vital waystation for the transfer of troops from South Asia to the Middle East and\n23 Quote from Tripp, A History of Iraq, 88\u201399; D. K. Fieldhouse, Western Imperialism in\nthe Middle East 1914-1958 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 104.\n24 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 49, 52\u201353.\n25 Marr, 51\u201352. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 359\nEurope. As such, London was deeply concerned about the threat that the Sunni officers\nposed to its position in a territory it deemed vital to the war effort.26\nTo the relief of the British, a leadership change in Iraq shortly before the outbreak\nof World War II not only eased those fears but also seemed to create an opportunity to\ncurb the growing power of the Sunni nationalists. The shift was a product of Ghazi\u2019s\nuntimely death in a car accident in 1939 and the subsequent accession of his son,\nFaysal II (r. 1939-1958) to the throne. Still an infant, the new king could not yet rule;\naccordingly, real power ending up in the hands of the regent, his uncle, Abd il-Alah\n(1913-1958). Staunchly pro-British, Abd il-Alah made clear from the start that he\nintended to use his considerable constitutional authority\u2014which included the power to\napprove new prime ministers\u2014to check the pan-Arabists.27\nBolstered by Abd il-Alah\u2019s presence, the British moved to achieve a favorable\nresolution of the political situation in the spring of 1941. Aware that the Golden Square\nwas conspiring with Germany to push it out of Iraq, London pressed both the regent and\nPrime Minister Taha al-Hashimi (r. 1941) to adopt a more openly pro-British foreign\npolicy. Al-Hashimi was amenable but was aware that he would need to first weaken the\nGolden Square if he hoped to align Baghdad more closely with London. Accordingly, he\nquietly began to reassign its leaders to less-important commands located far from the\ncapital and to replace them with more reliable men. Though well laid out, the plan\nbackfired badly. Catching wind of his scheme before al-Hashimi could put it into effect,\nthe officers quickly organized a countermove aimed at overthrowing the prime minister\nand at replacing him with the pro-German politician Rashid Ali (r. 1941).28\nThe operation was an almost total success. It removed al-Hashimi from office\nand secured the Golden Square\u2019s complete control of the government. Critically,\nhowever, thanks to the intervention of American ambassador Paul Knabenshue (1883-\n1942), the plotters failed to arrest il-Alah, who slipped out of the palace by hiding under\na blanket in the backseat of the ambassador\u2019s official car. As a result, Ali and the\nGolden Square were unable to force the regent to issue a royal decree legitimating the\nchange in government. Still, this issue aside, the pan-Arabists were pleased with their\nwork. Solidly in control of the country and anticipating German military assistance, they\nwere confident that they would soon be in a position to eject the British from Iraq.29\nThe Anglo-Iraqi War\nComing at a time when German forces were mounting offensives in the Eastern\nMediterranean and North Africa, the coup deeply troubled British officials and impelled\n26 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 99\u2013105.\n27 Daniel Silverfarb, Britain\u2019s Informal Empire in the Middle East: A Case Study of Iraq\n1929-1941 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986), 103, 120.\n28 Silverfarb, 122\u201324.\n29 Peter L. Hahn, Missions Accomplished?: The United States and Iraq Since World War\nI (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), 7\u20138. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 360\nthem to ascertain whether the Iraqi government intended to abide by the terms of the\n1932 treaty. They moved to do so in the spring of 1941 by landing Indian troops in\nBasra\u2014thereby compelling the Iraqi government either to back down or to openly break\nwith Britain. Furious, the Golden Square rose to the bait. Emboldened by the prospect\nof German support, it countered London\u2019s provocative action by ordering Iraqi troops to\nsurround the British airfield at Habbaniya in late April and by threatening to shoot down\nany planes that attempted to take off from the base. Having maneuvered the pan-\nArabists into formally violating the terms of the 1932 treaty, London followed by ordering\nBritish forces defending Habbaniya to first push Iraqi soldiers away from the base and to\nthen advance on Baghdad. Despite the deployment of German aircraft to northern Iraq,\nthe initial British move was successful\u2014as was a second attack on Iraqi positions\noutside Fallujah shortly thereafter. At that point, the Golden Square\u2019s position gave way.\nWith morale collapsing, the troops defending the capital abandoned their posts en\nmasse, leaving Rashid Ali and the leaders of the Golden Square with little recourse but\nto flee for safety to Iran. Thus, by the beginning of June, Britain had not only ended the\nthreat to its position in Iraq but had once again taken complete control of the country.30\nThe officers may have gone down to defeat in their showdown with Britain, but\ntheir brief time in power nonetheless had an enormous impact on Iraq\u2019s emerging\npolitical culture. During their period of dominance in the 1930s and early 1940s, they\nhad institutionalized the vision of authoritarian nationalism that they had acquired during\ntheir time studying in the Ottoman Empire\u2019s military academies. Just as important, they\nhad also succeeded in ensuring that both their conception of Iraq as a country\ndominated by Sunni Arabs and their embrace of pan-Arabism continued to command\nbroad acceptance in the Iraqi government and\u2014especially\u2014in the military. The impact\nof these views was as baleful as it was lasting for Iraq. Coming on the heels of Britain\u2019s\nfailure to foster either a strong, inclusive sense of national identity or a government that\nenjoyed broad legitimacy, the growing prevalence of the officers\u2019 pan-Arabist beliefs\nprevented the state from constructing a notion of identity that was inclusive of all Iraqis\nor from establishing a governing system that enjoyed the genuine consent of the\npeople.31\nThe Second British Occupation\nLasting from 1941 to 1947, Britain\u2019s second occupation gave the civilian political\nelite a chance both to purge Iraq of the officers\u2019 influence and to finally establish a\nstrong connection between government and society. Initially, the pro-British politicians\nwho dominated wartime Iraq appeared to take steps to achieve those ends. They\nvigorously persecuted the leaders of the coup in 1941 and aggressively purged pan-\nArab extremists from the government. They also broadened support for the state by\nbringing a number of prominent Kurds and Shi\u02bfa into the ruling circle.32\n30 Fieldhouse, Western Imperialism in the Middle East 1914-1958, 105\u20136.\n31 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 77\u201382, 94\u201396.\n32 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 56\u201358. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 361\nUltimately, however, Nuri Said, il-Alah, and the other political figures who\ndominated Iraq during the second occupation did not take advantage of the\nopportunities that wartime exigencies had presented them. They failed to build strong\nconnections between citizens and state, refused to give Iraqis genuine representation,\nand made only halfhearted efforts to create a robust, shared identity that would be\ninclusive of the Kurds and Shi\u02bfi. Instead, the landlord-shaykhs and wealthy town Arabs\nwho dominated the government largely left unchanged what was, at root, a thoroughly\nunrepresentative state. Self-interested and with little commitment to genuine\ndemocracy, they focused on engaging in intra-elite factional struggles and on using the\nstate\u2019s powers of coercion and patronage to their advantage\u2014just as they had in the\n1930s. Largely Sunni Arabs themselves, meanwhile, the members of the ruling factions\nsaw little to gain from ending the Sunni dominance of Iraq that had existed from the start\nof the mandate. Thus, despite the substantial coercive powers it continued to hold, the\nIraqi state remained a weak one that in 1945 enjoyed only marginally more legitimacy or\nconnection to the people than it had when it had become independent in 1932.33\nInterwar Egypt: The Liberal Age\nA British protectorate rather than a mandate, Egypt seemed substantially further\nalong the road to genuine independence than did Iraq at the start of the interwar era. It\nhad a well-established monarchy, exercised substantial autonomy, and was in the\nprocess of drafting a constitution. It even had a popular, well-established political\norganization that could connect the people to the state: Saad Zaghul\u2019s (1859-1927)\nWafd Party. As such, despite Britain\u2019s retention of a powerful position in the country\nthanks to the Four Reserved Points, Egypt appeared poised to emerge as a stable,\nindependent, and democratic state in the early 1920s.\nThe imminence of self-rule in Egypt was, in fact, an illusion. In reality, neither\ngenuine independence nor the institutionalization of a robust system of representative\ngovernment were at hand. Instead, thanks to a combination of British manipulation,\nroyal obstruction, and Wafd Party elitism, Egypt failed to establish the civic-political\nculture needed to legitimate the state and to bind its people to the liberal political order.\nAs a result, after the Second World War, the country would experience the spread of\npolitical violence, the rising power of undemocratic and extremist non-parliamentary\nmovements, and, most importantly, the complete delegitimation of the liberal system\u2014\ndevelopments that would, collectively, doom the constitutional order to a quick demise.34\nConstitution and Democracy\nIn contrast to the despair that Egypt would experience immediately after World\nWar II, hopes ran high in 1922 that full independence was imminent. Indeed, the\nEgyptian people at that time were enthusiastically working to establish the contours of\n33 Marr, 58\u201361.\n34 Steven A. Cook, The Struggle for Egypt: From Nasser to Tahrir Square, Reprint\nedition (Oxford University Press, 2011), 22\u201323. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 362\nthe new government that they believed would lead them to full independence. They\nfocused first on drafting a constitution. Taking effect in 1923, it reflected divergent\nimpulses. On the one hand, it guaranteed basic rights and ensured through the adoption\nof universal male suffrage that the Egyptian people had a strong voice in the\ngovernment. On the other, it vested an unusual degree of authority in the king\u2014giving\nhim the power to prorogue parliament, to dismiss cabinet ministers, to veto legislation,\nand to name two-fifths of the members of parliament\u2019s upper house.35\nEgypt followed in 1924 with its first parliamentary elections under the new\nsystem. To the surprise of no one, the Wafd Party won a decisive victory and Zaghul\ntook office as the country\u2019s first prime minister. It was a heady time. With the Wafd Party\npromising to negotiate an end to the Four Reserved Points, the country appeared ready\nat last to become a fully independent, democratic state.36\nThe Trials of Representative Government\nIt failed to do so, however. In fact, Egypt would have a peculiarly difficult time\nsecuring full independence under the direction of the Wafd Party\u2014then or later. What\nexplained this failure? Why in spite of having both broad popular support and a large\nmajority in parliament, was the party unable to achieve its primary goal? The answer lay\nin the peculiar structure of Egyptian politics in the interwar era. During the 1920s and\n1930s, three power centers\u2014Britain, the king, and the Wafd Party\u2014defined the\ncontours of the Egyptian political system. Each had a different goal. While the secular\nWafd sought genuine independence and representative government, King Fuad (r.\n1922-1936) instead strove to establish a royal dictatorship. In the background,\nmeanwhile, London worked to retain the informal control over Egypt and the Suez Canal\nthat the Four Reserved Points had accorded it. The result was a tripartite struggle that\nsaw the parties form tacit, shifting alliances to achieve their policy objectives. At times,\nBritain and the Wafd collaborated to contain the monarch; as their interests were\ngenerally more closely aligned, however, it was more typically the British and Fuad who\ncooperated to frustrate the Wafd\u2019s efforts to achieve its goals. As a result, the Wafd\nParty\u2019s efforts to renegotiate the terms of Egypt\u2019s relationship with Britain or to shift\npower from the monarch to the legislature met with repeated failures.37\nIndeed, a cyclical pattern soon took shape. Each phase would begin with the\nWafd Party winning a decisive electoral victory that gave it a mandate to seek full\nindependence from London. Taking advantage of the vast authority that the constitution\nvested in him, Fuad would then use a conflict\u2014typically an impasse in the\nnegotiations\u2014to assert his power. He would dismiss the cabinet, dissolve parliament,\n35 Selma Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d in The Cambridge History of Egypt.

Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 363\nand install a pliable government that was beholden to him; the palace would then rule\nthe country autocratically for several years. Eventually, a new political conflict would\nemerge that would compel the king to call new elections. The Wafd would once again\nwin a substantial majority, after which the cycle would once more repeat.38\nThe pattern first took shape immediately following the Wafd\u2019s huge victory in\nelections held in January 1924. Having secured a large parliamentary majority on the\nbasis of Zaghul\u2019s promise to achieve full independence, the party immediately opened\ntalks with London aimed at attaining complete sovereignty. For a time, hopes ran high\nthat Egypt would soon be fully independent. To the consternation of the Wafd, however,\nthe negotiations deadlocked over the question of whether London or Cairo would control\nSudan. The diplomatic impasse\u2014and the subsequent assassination in Cairo of the\nBritish governor-general of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\u2014then created a crisis that compelled\nZaghul to resign. Using the powers that the constitution had vested in him, Fuad\nfollowed by dissolving parliament and by naming a new cabinet consisting of royalist\nfavorites who were disinclined to continue the push for full independence. To Zaghul\u2019s\ndismay, as a result, the talks he had opened with Britain had ended without Egypt\nhaving secured its independence. It was a bitter pill for a man who had fought so hard\nand for so long for Egyptian independence. The negotiations were also his last hurrah:\ndying just three years later, he never again headed the government.39\nThe cycle repeated several more times before culminating in the temporary end\nof democratic rule in the early 1930s. Ironically, the retreat from democratic government\ncame in response to the Wafd\u2019s growing success. Running once again on a platform\ncalling for negotiations aimed at achieving full independence, the party won a\nresounding electoral victory in 1929 that made its new leader, Mustafa al-Nahhas\n(1879-1965), the prime minister. Genuine independence once more seemed imminent.\nUnfortunately for the Wafd, however, al-Nahhas was no more successful than Zaghul\nhad been at translating electoral victory into diplomatic progress, and the talks again\nbroke down over the question of whether London or Cairo would rule the Sudan. Worse,\nthe deadlock once more presented Fuad with a golden opportunity to assert his power.\nTaking advantage of the crisis, he secured al-Nahhas\u2019s resignation and appointed a\nnew prime minister\u2014the autocratic royalist, Ismail Sidqi (1875-1950)\u2014and tasked him\nwith implementing a new constitution that vested nearly all power in the monarchy.\nOnce it was enacted, Fuad himself ruled Egypt as royal dictator while the Wafd could\nonly look on, impotently, from the sidelines.40\nAs these events make clear, Fuad and the British bore most of the responsibility\nfor both the Wafd\u2019s difficulties and for Egypt\u2019s failure to develop a robust democratic\nsystem in the interwar period. Indeed, both parties worked assiduously to foil the will of\nthe Egyptian people. At the same time, however, the Wafd itself was far from\n38 Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d 290.\n39 Jayne Gifford, Britain in Egypt: Egyptian Nationalism and Imperial Strategy, 1919-\n1931 (London: I.

Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 364\nblameless\u2014either for the predicament it found itself in during the early 1930s or, more\nbroadly, for the failings of Egyptian democracy. Its shortcomings were largely the\nproduct of the values and outlook of its leadership. While the Wafd was by far the\nlargest political organization in Egypt and stood as the self-described champion of the\nliberal order, it was, ironically, not itself a democratically structured organization.\nInstead, dominated by educated, affluent members of the bourgeoisie, the party was an\nelitist institution that greeted bottom-up political activities with great suspicion and that\nsaw little utility in institutionalizing democratic practices. As such, it made no meaningful\neffort to engage with or organize the Egyptian masses.41\nThe result was good neither for the party nor for Egyptian democracy writ large.\nHaving failed either to mobilize the masses or to bind them to the state, the Wafd ended\nup with electoral support that was broad but shallow and thus unreliable. More\nimportantly, the party\u2019s lack of interest in connecting the people to the democratic state\nor in building the robust civic-political culture on which stable representative government\nultimately rests meant that Egyptian democracy never developed deep roots\u2014an issue\nthat would emerge as a serious problem in the postwar era.42\nThe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, 1936\nThe cyclical political pattern finally broke in the mid 1930s thanks to a change in\nBritish policy. To that point, London had tacitly supported royal government in Egypt\nbecause neither Sidqi nor Fuad challenged its position in the country. By the middle of\nthe decade, however, evolving international circumstances compelled it to reexamine\nthat approach. Against the backdrop of the broader threat that the rise of fascism in\nEurope posed to British security, Italy\u2019s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 dramatically raised\nthe stakes in Egypt. Were disgruntled Egyptian nationalists to throw in with the fascist\nstates during time of war, defending the Suez Canal\u2014the vital artery that linked Britain\nto its colonies in Asia and Oceania\u2014would be immeasurably more challenging. London\nthus concluded that it needed to quickly secure a compromise agreement with Cairo\nthat would satisfy Egyptian demands for independence while simultaneously permitting\nBritain to retain its critical base complex along the canal. There was one hitch, however.\nBritish officials believed that only a treaty negotiated by a popularly elected government\nwould be legitimate in the eyes of the Egyptian people; in other words, Egypt would\nneed to revert to democratic rule before productive talks could occur.43\nAccordingly, London joined the Wafd in demanding that the king restore the\nconstitution of 1923 and that he hold new elections. Facing intense domestic and\ninternational pressure, Fuad had no choice but to schedule a vote for the spring of\n1936. To no one\u2019s surprise, the Wafd won another decisive victory in the election, and\nal-Nahhas once again became prime minister. Coupled with the accession of the\npopular new king, Faruq (r. 1936-1952), following the death of his father in early 1936,\n41 Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d 288.\n42 Botman, 288.\n43 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 77\u201379. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 365\nthe subsequent opening of talks created a surge of optimism in Egypt. The country once\nmore appeared to be on the cusp of real independence.44\nWith both sides looking to conclude a deal, the negotiations quickly produced a\nsettlement. Structured as a twenty-year defensive agreement, the Treaty of Preferential\nAlliance signed in August 1936 satisfied each party\u2019s primary objectives. London kept\ncontrol of Sudan, retained the right to station 10,000 troops in the Canal Zone during\npeacetime and an unlimited number during time of war, and secured a provision calling\nfor it to come to Egypt\u2019s assistance should that country be threatened with invasion. In\nexchange, it ceded responsibility for the protection of minorities and foreigners to the\ngovernment in Cairo, assented to the abolition of the hated capitulations, and, most\nimportantly, agreed to fully recognize Egypt\u2019s sovereignty\u2014thus paving the way for it to\njoin the League of Nations and to oversee its own foreign policy. It was a momentous\noccasion. To the jubilation of most Egyptians, their state had finally won its formal\nindependence.45\nChallenges to the Liberal Order\nNot everyone shared in the enthusiasm about the agreement, however. On the\ncontrary, bitterness regarding its limits fed a growing dissatisfaction with both the Wafd\nand Egypt\u2019s broader democratic order. Criticism of the party came from all sides.\nSecular rightists such as the small-but-growing Young Egypt Party attacked the Wafd by\narguing that the treaty al-Nahhas had negotiated had not ended Britain\u2019s colonial\nposition in Egypt but had instead merely obscured it in the guise of a defensive alliance.\nThough their reasons differed, feminists were equally vociferous in their condemnation\nof the Wafd and Egypt\u2019s constitutional order. Decrying the party and the government for\ntheir culpability in the ongoing subjugation of women, they sought a series of legal and\nsocial reforms. They demanded female suffrage, called for the creation of jobs for\nwomen, pressed for the legalization of birth control and abortion, and appealed for\nsweeping cultural changes such as permitting wives to have an identity outside of\nmarriage. On the left, meanwhile, mounting disenchantment with the Wafd Party\u2019s\nfailure to address the Great Depression\u2019s impact on the lower classes helped fuel the\ngrowing popularity of a communist party among the skilled workers and intelligentsia of\nCairo. While it remained small, the party would prove to be unusually influential. As we\nshall see, many of the policies that it popularized\u2014including, most importantly, the idea\nof central economic planning\u2014would powerfully influence the policies of Gamal Abdel\nNasser\u2019s (r. 1952-1970) Arab-nationalist government beginning in the 1950s.46\nDespite the lasting influence of their economic policies, however, the communists\nproved unable to capitalize on growing disillusionment with the liberal order to win mass\nappeal. Instead, it was a relatively new Islamist organization, the Muslim Brotherhood,\nthat was able to take advantage of the secular Wafd Party\u2019s missteps to emerge as\n44 Goldschmidt, 77\u201379.\n45 Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d 295\u2013196.\n46 Botman, 296\u201397, 303\u20134. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 366\nEgypt\u2019s most important non-parliamentary opposition movement in the interwar era.\nFounded in 1928 by a twenty-two-year-old schoolteacher named Hassan al-Banna\n(1906-1949), the organization was initially a typical Muslim charitable society that\nprovided education and jobs to the poor. It did not retain this orientation for long,\nhowever. Instead, influenced by the ideas of Islamic modernists such as Muhammad\nAbduh (1849-1905), the brotherhood soon adopted an explicitly political approach that\ncalled for Egypt to abandon liberal, Western-style secularism in favor of a government\nbased on Islamic principles.47\nIt is important to note that the Muslim Brotherhood was not, like the Wahhabi,\nbackward looking. That is, it neither repudiated modern economic arrangements nor\ncondemned Western science and technology. What the brothers did reject, however,\nwas the Wafd Party\u2019s view that modern economic practices and technologies should be\nembedded in a Western-style social system. Arguing that such an approach had merely\nserved to exacerbate inequality and to weaken the governments of those Muslim states\nthat had pursued it, the brothers instead maintained that Western technologies and\nsystems could only benefit Muslims if those practices were embedded in a social\narrangement that was based firmly on Islamic social values. It proved to be a highly\nappealing message. Blending the benefits of modernity with familiar touchstones, it\nresonated strongly with many lower- and middle-class Egyptian Muslims. Indeed, in\nconjunction with the brotherhood\u2019s strong anticolonialism and implementation of\nsuccessful economic development projects, it resulted in the organization emerging\nafter World War II as the most important popular opposition movement in Egypt.48\nThus, in spite of the treaty with Britain, the Wafd party and the broader\nparliamentary system that it represented had begun to see their standing decline in the\nlate 1930s. The liberal order\u2019s failure to achieve complete independence\u2014meaning one\nin which there was no British presence in Egypt whatsoever\u2014had subjected it to a\nbarrage of criticism from opposition groups spanning the political spectrum. Likewise,\nthe Wafd\u2019s inability to ameliorate the economic impact of the Great Depression or to\nsatisfy the demands of Egyptian feminists had gradually eroded its base of support. Still,\nit is important to keep the party\u2019s situation during the late 1930s in perspective. Popular\nfeelings toward it may have been more tepid than in the past, but the events of the\ninterwar period including the treaty signed in 1936 had hardly ended its appeal or cost it\nthe backing of most Egyptians.49\nWorld War II and the Abdin Palace Incident\nWorld War II would prove to be a different story, however. Indeed, it was the\nWafd\u2019s inability to navigate the tricky events of the conflict that ultimately discredited\nboth the party and the broader constitutional order. From the very start of the war,\n47 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 27\u201330.\n48 Cook, 27\u201330.\n49 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 196. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 367\nEgyptians chafed at London\u2019s substantial interference in their country\u2019s internal affairs.\nAs per the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, London compelled Cairo to\nimpose martial law and censorship, to permit hundreds of thousands of Commonwealth\nforces to occupy bases in the country, and to break relations with Germany. It also\nsucceeded in forcing the dismissal of a pro-Axis prime minister and a prominent\ngeneral. Coming on top of near famine conditions and the biting inflation that wartime\neconomic disruptions had caused, these events embittered Egyptians of all social\nclasses and left many disillusioned with the Wafd and the liberal order for their failure to\ndeliver on the promise of real independence.50\nUltimately, however, it was neither the war\u2019s impact on Egypt\u2019s economic health\nnor the restrictions that the treaty had placed on the country\u2019s independence that turned\npeople against the liberal order. On the contrary, it was a single event, The Abdin\nPalace Incident of February 1942, that fatally wounded the credibility of Egypt\u2019s\nparliamentary system. The episode grew out of a change in Egyptian leadership earlier\nthat year. Angry that Prime Minister Husayn Sirri (1894-1960) had broken diplomatic\nrelations with a German ally, Vichy France, without first seeking royal input, Faruq had\nsecured the prime minister\u2019s resignation in early 1942. In less-fraught times, the British\nmight have been willing to let this action slide. With Germany\u2019s powerful Afrika Korps\nmounting an offensive in Libya toward the Egyptian frontier, however, London felt that it\nneeded to respond aggressively to Faruq\u2019s move in order to ensure its position in the\ncountry. Accordingly, at a meeting with the king at his residence, the Abdin Palace, on\nthe evening of February 4, 1942, Ambassador Miles Lampson (1880-1964) issued a\nblunt ultimatum: either appoint Wafd leader al-Nahhas as prime minister or abdicate.\nWith little room to maneuver thanks to the fact that Lampson had preemptively arranged\nfor British tanks to surround the palace, the king quickly acceded to the ambassador\u2019s\ndemands. Believing that he could secure additional resources for Egypt if he assumed\ncontrol of the government, al-Nahhas also agreed to go along with Lampson\u2019s\ndemands. As a result, the crisis came to a speedy end.51\nDespite its quick conclusion, however, the Abdin Palace Incident irrevocably\ndamaged the position of all three parties. Faruq\u2019s failure to abdicate or even to stand up\nto the British utterly destroyed his standing with the Egyptian people. Meanwhile, though\nLampson\u2019s naked interference in Egypt\u2019s internal affairs had secured London\u2019s\nimmediate ends, the move also produced a huge upsurge in anti-British sentiment that\nimperiled Britain\u2019s long-term presence in the country. If London and Faruq had\nweakened their respective positions, however, the Wafd had\u2014through its willingness to\nassume power behind British bayonets\u2014all-but destroyed its popular standing and\nnationalist credentials. Thereafter, it hemorrhaged support to movements such as the\nMuslim Brotherhood that had remained uncompromising in their opposition to the\nBritish.52\n50 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 85\u201386.\n51 Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d 298\u2013300.\n52 Rogan, The Arabs, 210. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 368\nEgypt After World War II\nWith the liberal order discredited and with resentment toward the British surging\nto new heights, Egypt began to descend into political chaos following World War II. The\nprime movers of the country\u2019s political collapse were the non-parliamentary groups that\nhad been steadily gaining strength since the signing of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.\nBelieving that its time was at hand, the most important of those organizations, the\nMuslim Brotherhood took steps to complete the destruction of the liberal system and to\nforce a complete break with London following the war. It organized demonstrations to\nprotest the failings of the liberal government, ordered a wave of assassinations\nincluding the shocking murder of Prime Minister Ahmad Mahir (1888-1945) in\nparliament in February 1945, and organized increasingly violent riots against the\ncontinued British presence in Egypt. The worst clash occurred in Cairo in February\n1946. Facing a huge crowd of students and workers attempting to storm their barracks,\nBritish troops opened fire with machine guns; when the smoke cleared, twenty-three\nEgyptians lay dead and more than one hundred were injured.53\nDespite the chaos, the liberal order nearly succeeded in redeeming itself late in\n1946. Reappointed prime minister that year, Sidqi initiated negotiations with London\naimed at finally securing the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt. After several\nrounds of difficult talks, he and Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin (1881-1951) succeeded in\nhashing out a tentative agreement that called for London to remove its remaining forces\nfrom the Canal Zone. For a brief and exciting moment, as a result, complete\nindependence at last appeared to be at hand. Once again, however, negotiations\nbetween Egypt and Britain broke down over the status of Sudan. Bevin and Sidqi\u2019s\neffort to finesse the issue of which party would control that territory ultimately failed to\nappease either the Wafd or British imperialists; as a result, the talks soon came to a\nbitter end amid a flurry of finger pointing and bickering over who was to blame for their\ncollapse.54\nThereafter, the liberal order steadily lost what little support it had managed to\nretain. Over the rest of the decade, it faced constant criticism from the non-\nparliamentary political movements and took the blame for Egypt\u2019s disastrous\ninvolvement in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. It also lost legitimacy as a result of a surge in\npolitical violence that included the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s assassination of Prime Minister\nNuqrashi (1888-1948) in December 1948 and the government\u2019s retaliatory killing of al-\nBanna in February 1949.55\nThe constitutional system might have survived even these serious challenges\nhad the Wafd Party previously built close links between the Egyptian people and their\ngovernment during the interwar era and thus established the strong civic-political\nfoundation on which the stability and success of representative government depends.\n53 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 90.\n54 Botman, \u201cThe Liberal Age,\u201d 304\u20135.\n55 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 91\u2013100. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 369\nHaving failed to do so, however, the party found itself utterly incapable of arresting the\ncollapse in support for the constitutional order that occurred in the late 1940s. Thus, by\nthe end of the decade, Egypt\u2019s liberal age\u2014begun with such high hopes just a few\ndecades earlier\u2014was nearly at an end.56\nSyria\nSyria\u2019s experience under the mandate system was every bit as frustrating as\nEgypt\u2019s or Iraq\u2019s. Despite Paris\u2019s claims that it was bringing representative government\nand modernity to the country, the French made little effort to establish a durable\ndemocratic political system in Syria or to create strong links between the country\u2019s\npeople and their government. On the contrary, in an effort to perpetuate continued\nFrench control, they imposed a system of direct rule on the mandate designed to\ndeprive Syrians of the opportunity to gain experience in self-government, and they\ndivided the country along confessional lines in order to prevent the emergence of a\nunified nationalist resistance movement. As a result, when Syria finally won its\nindependence following World War II it lacked the experienced administrators, durable\npolitical institutions, and established civic-political culture needed for its government to\nfunction effectively or even to maintain political stability.\nThe Division of Syria\nFrom the start, the French approach to Syria reflected its transparently imperialist\ngoals. With longstanding economic and cultural interests in the region, France had\nintended since early in the First World War to make Syria a permanent addition to its\nempire and had viewed the mandate system as little more than a device to appease\ncritics like US President Woodrow Wilson (r. 1913-1921). Unsurprisingly, in light of\nthese goals, Paris moved to satisfy its mandatory obligation to prepare Syria for self-\ngovernment in a manner that was largely performative. Thus, while High Commissioner\nGeneral Henri Gouraud (1867-1946) may have scrupulously established representative\npolitical institutions and made a point of bringing educated Syrians into the mandatory\nadministration, he also took steps to ensure that those governing structures were\npowerless and that French advisors rather than Syrian officials made all meaningful\ndecisions. More broadly, Gouraud not only failed to foster any meaningful positive\nconnection between the Syrian people and its government, but actively worked against\nthe establishment of such links 57\nFrance also pursued a cynical strategy of divide-and-conquer in Syria in which it\nsplit the mandate into a series of statelets. Gouraud\u2019s Secretary General and successor\nas High Commissioner, Robert de Caix (1869-1970) oversaw this effort. He began to\nput it into effect in 1920 by creating the predominantly Christian state of Lebanon. Later,\nhe established microstates for two comparatively small religious communities: the\n56 Goldschmidt, 91\u2013100.\n57 Michael Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern\nMiddle East (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), 84\u201387. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 370\nAlawites, a Shi\u02bfi sect that predominated along Syria\u2019s northern Mediterranean coast,\nand the Druze, a syncretic ethno-religious group that occupied the mountainous south.\nFor reasons we shall explore in a moment, De Caix opted to rule them indirectly through\nexisting tribal leaders according to a model pioneered by French colonial authorities in\nMorocco. Finally, he also created two Sunni Arab microstates, Aleppo and Damascus,\nthat France would rule directly.58\nThe division of the mandate promised to pay substantial dividends for the\nFrench. Direct rule of Aleppo and Damascus, which colonial officials combined into a\nsingle state in 1925 as part of a cost-cutting bid, would permit them to maintain close\ncontrol of the educated, urban Sunni notables that they viewed as the biggest threat to\ncontinued French rule\u2014particularly the former Ottoman bureaucrats and military leaders\nwhom they correctly suspected of attempting to organize an anti-colonialist nationalist\nmovement. Meanwhile, the division of Syria into multiple states would also limit the\nability of the urban elite to establish ties with the rural population and would thus\nforestall any effort to create a mandate-wide anticolonial movement. Finally, the\nestablishment of religiously based microstates promised to create constituencies that\nwere dependent on France for their continued autonomy and would thus assist the\nFrench in retaining control of the mandate. In sum, it was a nakedly imperialistic\nstrategy but also a shrewd and well-thought-out one that seemed likely to ensure that\nSyria remained a French possession for a long time.59\nThe Great Syrian Revolt, 1925-1927\nUnfortunately for de Caix\u2019s successor, Maurice Sarrail, (1856-1929), just as\nBritish historical and anthropological knowledge had proven to be a poor guide to Iraq,\nso, in two ways, did French assumptions turn out be disastrously off the mark in Syria.\nFirst, France\u2019s divide-and-conquer approach failed to keep the different confessional\ngroups from organizing together against them. Second, the religious minorities that\nParis had assumed would back their rule not only failed to help the French but also took\nan active part in resisting them. Ironically, in fact, it was one of those groups, the Druze,\nthat played the lead part in precipitating the most substantial challenge to their control of\nthe mandate: the Great Syrian Revolt of 1927.60\nFrance\u2019s unwillingness to respect Druze autonomy sparked the rebellion.\nOverseen by an arrogant and domineering French officer, the Druze chafed from the\nstart of the mandate at interference in their internal affairs and at efforts to impose\nunpopular reforms. Sarrail compounded the situation by refusing to meet with a\ndelegation to hear their grievances in the spring of 1925\u2014a snub that proved to be the\nfinal straw for many Druze leaders including the powerful Sultan Pasha al-Atrash (1888-\n58 Rogan, The Arabs, 225\u201327.\n59 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n90\u201391.\n60 John McHugo, Syria: A History of the Last Hundred Years (New York: The New\nPress, 2014), 82\u201383. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 371\n1982). Concluding that his people would never enjoy real autonomy so long as the\nFrench remained in Syria, he began organizing a massive revolt in 1924. He understood\nthat his people faced an uphill fight against the French. He thus made contact with the\nArab nationalist Dr. Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar (1879-1940), Faysal I\u2019s former foreign\nminister and the leader of the independence-minded People\u2019s Party, to see if the party\nwould like to launch a coordinated uprising against the French. Believing that an\nalliance of Druze and Arabs could defeat France, Shahbandar enthusiastically agreed.\nAccordingly, drawing on Kemal Mustafa\u2019s (r. 1923-1938) successful independence\ncampaign in Turkey as a blueprint, the two men began planning a synchronized\nrebellion aimed at achieving self-rule and at ending the partition of Syria.61\nKnown as the Great Syrian Revolt, the uprising constituted a serious threat to\nFrance\u2019s position in Syria. It began with a series of spectacular Druze victories in the\nsouth. In July 1925, Sultan al-Atrash\u2019s troops seized control of the regional capital after\ndecimating a French column of three-hundred men. In a triumph that electrified the\npeople of Syria, his forces followed by destroying a huge punitive expedition sent to\navenge France\u2019s earlier defeat. The revolt soon spread. Waiting until Sarrail had\ndeployed the bulk of his troops against the Druze, Fawzi al-Qawuqji (1890-1977), a one-\ntime Ottoman military officer, opened a new front two months after al-Atrash\u2019s first\nvictory by leading an Arab uprising in Hama. Soon forced out of the city by superior\nFrench forces, al-Qawuqji and his men relocated to the almost-impenetrably thick\norchard groves outside Damascus. From well-concealed bases among the fruit trees,\nthey followed with a series of effective guerrilla attacks against French troops in the\ncapital.62\nTo the horror of the French, the revolt quickly captured the imagination of the\nSyrian public. Inspired by al-Atrash and al-Qawuqji\u2019s success, people from all of the\nmandate\u2019s confessional groups joined the rebellion by the thousands. By the end of the\nyear, as a result, the uprising had become precisely the kind of threat that the French\nhad so carefully designed their divide-and-conquer policy to prevent: a multi-religious,\nmulti-ethnic, mandate-wide movement dedicated to achieving full independence.63\nDespite the severity of this challenge, colonial officials were soon able to restore\nFrench control of the mandate. Old hands at the game of imperialism, they were neither\neasily rattled nor shy about using brutal methods to restore order. This they proceeded\nto do.

Mopping-up operations continued until early 1927, but the\nrevolt was effectively over by the end of 1926.64\nStalemate\nThe experience of the Great Syrian Revolt left both French colonialists and\nSyrian nationalists willing to make concessions. For France, the motivating issue was\nfiscal in nature. The campaign to end the rebellion had proven so unsustainably\nexpensive that it compelled Paris to abandon its commitment to direct rule and to\ninstead seek a less-costly arrangement patterned after the empire-by-treaty system that\nBritain had established in Iraq. The mandate authorities consequently issued a series of\namnesties and permitted the establishment of a moderate, secular political party of\nconservative landowners and notables called the National Bloc. They also signaled their\nwillingness to enter negotiations aimed at permitting a greater degree of autonomy in\nthe mandate in exchange for formal recognition of France\u2019s strategic and economic\ninterests.65\nFor the elites who dominated the National Bloc, in contrast, the primary factor\ndriving moderation was the vast imbalance in military power that existed in the mandate.\nMaking clear France\u2019s overwhelming military advantage, the suppression of the\nrebellion had persuaded Syrian nationalists to abandon the effort to achieve\nindependence through the use of force in favor of the more-limited objective of greater\nautonomy through negotiations. Accordingly, the National Bloc indicated that it was\nwilling to take part in talks aimed at achieving a system of indirect rule that it referred to\nas \u201c\u2018honorable cooperation.\u2019\u201d Thus, with the two sides now seeking similar goals, the\nstage was set for discussions aimed at formalizing French interests in Syria in exchange\nfor nominal independence.66\nBegun with high hopes in the early 1930s, the subsequent negotiations proved\nfrustratingly contentious and failed to produce an agreement. The primary stumbling\nblock was the question of Syrian unity. The French were insistent that the mandate\nremain divided into multiple statelets; the National Bloc was equally adamant that it be\nreunified. With the two sides unable to find a way to finesse their differences on this\npoint, the talks collapsed in failure. Subsequent efforts to restart the negotiations\nsimilarly foundered over the parties\u2019 continued inability to find common ground 67\nWith frustration once more boiling over in Syria thanks to the failure of the\nnegotiations, the National Bloc shifted in the mid 1930s to a more aggressive approach\ndesigned to target the French in the pocketbook. In January 1936, it initiated a non-\nviolent pressure campaign known as the Syrian General Strike.

This new\nstrategy worked. Confronted with the unpalatable prospect of having to shoulder the\ncost of the mandate during a time of economic contraction, Paris capitulated and agreed\nto hold serious negotiations in 1936.68\nProspects looked good for an agreement. With war clouds gathering in Europe,\nthe government of leftist Prime Minister Leon Blum (1872-1950) was eager to ensure\nstability in the mandate; accordingly, it signaled its willingness to compromise on the\nquestion of Syrian unity. With the main stumbling block removed, the ensuing\nnegotiations were productive and soon produced a draft agreement that satisfied both\nsides\u2019 minimum conditions. Patterned loosely after the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, it granted\nParis the right to use two strategic airbases for twenty-five years and required\nDamascus to back France during time of war; in exchange, the French government\nagreed to reunify Syria and to recognize its independence. Delighted to have finally\nsecured an agreement, the Syrian parliament enthusiastically approved it in December\n1936. Independence at last appeared to be at hand.69\nTo the frustration of the National Bloc, however, even the limited sovereignty\nenvisaged in the treaty remained tantalizingly out of reach. Determined to maintain\ncontrol of the mandate, France\u2019s influential colonial lobby succeeded in preventing\nratification of the treaty in the French senate. Making matters worse, in 1938, the\nFrench government agreed to cede the coastal region of Alexandretta in northwest\nSyria to Turkey in a bid to keep Ankara from allying with Nazi Germany. It was a bitter\npill for Syrian nationalists, and it seemed to make emphatically clear that the National\nBloc\u2019s strategy of moderation and compromise had failed to produce results. Indeed, the\ntruth was that Syria was no closer to independence and unity in 1938 than it had been\nat the end of the Great Syrian Revolt a decade earlier.70\nWorld War II and Independence\nIn the end, it was neither further negotiations nor additional protests that\npermitted Syria to gain its independence. Instead, it was France\u2019s defeat and\noccupation in World War II that finally brought the mandate to a close. Even then,\nindependence did not come quickly or easily. Indeed, during the first few years of the\nwar, Syria\u2019s position was essentially unchanged. Controlled by a mandatory government\nthat was loyal to the collaborationist Vichy regime, it remained a de facto colony of\nFrance just as it had been prior to the war\u2019s outbreak.71\nOnly in the spring of 1941 did the mandate\u2019s circumstances finally begin to\nchange. They did so as a result of the shifting military balance.

Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 374\nthe Middle East at a time when German and Italian forces operating out of Libya were\nthreatening the Suez Canal, British soldiers and Free French troops led by future\nFrench President Charles de Gaulle (r. 1959-1970) invaded the mandate and quickly\noverwhelmed its Vichy defenders. It was an important victory for the Allies. Along with\nthe near-simultaneous military operation against the Golden Square in Iraq, it solidified\ntheir uncontested control of the Middle East and thus ensured that the region\u2019s oil and\nstrategic bases remained in their hands. If the Allies were thrilled with the outcome of\nthe operation, however, the Syrians were considerably more ambivalent. While they\nwere pleased to be out from under the thumb of the Vichy government, they were\nunhappy that they were now subject to Free French rule\u2014particularly after de Gaulle\ndeclared that his government intended to retain control of Syria following the war.72\nAt that point, however, France and Britain\u2019s longstanding imperial competition\nresurfaced to the benefit of Syrian nationalists. Eager to push its colonial rival out of the\nMiddle East once and for all, London began to apply pressure to de Gaulle to compel\nhim to relinquish the mandate. With France still under German occupation, the\nfrustrated French leader was in no position to argue and quickly\u2014if begrudgingly\u2014\nagreed to London\u2019s demands. Once again, as a result, genuine self-government\nseemed to be imminent.73\nSyria managed to secure its independence this time, but only after French\ncolonialists mounted a desperate\u2014and violent\u2014last-minute bid to hang on to the\nterritory. That effort began in the war\u2019s waning days. Determined to retain a dominant\nposition in Syria, Paris refused to withdraw its remaining troops from the country in the\nspring of 1945 in a transparent effort to blackmail the nationalists into signing a new\ntreaty recognizing France\u2019s long-term interests in the mandate. Enraged by this\neleventh-hour attempt to compromise their country\u2019s independence, the Syrian people\nresponded with a series of massive demonstrations against France\u2019s continued\npresence. Just as it had in 1920 and 1925, Paris replied with violence. Bombarding\nDamascus with artillery in May 1945, French troops killed over four-hundred Syrians\nand leveled large parts of the city. This time, however, the use of force proved to be\nFrance\u2019s swan song in Syria. Looking to bolster its reputation among the Arabs, London\nquickly forced Paris to end its terror campaign and followed by compelling it to remove\nits last troops the following year. As a result, after twenty-six-years of French rule, Syria\nhad finally become an independent state.74\nFrench rule of Syria may have been comparatively brief, but it nonetheless\npowerfully\u2014and adversely\u2014shaped the country\u2019s development. To a large degree, the\nmandate\u2019s legacy was a function not of what the French had done, but of what they had\nfailed to do. Even more so than Britain in Iraq, Paris had made no more than cosmetic\nattempts to meet its obligation as Syria\u2019s mandatory power to help prepare the country\n72 Rogan, 241.\n73 Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948,\n202\u201321.\n74 Barr, 283\u2013195. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 375\nfor independence. As a result, at the time it became independent, Syria had neither the\nexperienced administrators nor the durable political institutions that modern states\nrequire; more importantly, it lacked the civic-political culture that is so essential for the\neffective functioning of a representative polity.75\nFrance did not merely fail to foster the development of robust political institutions\nor strong connections between people and state, moreover. Instead, in its efforts to\nrender its control permanent, it also actively saddled the mandate with a destructive\npolitical inheritance that all-but ensured continued volatility. This legacy had three\ncomponents. First, Paris\u2019s refusal to ratify the 1936 treaty that the National Bloc had\nnegotiated thoroughly discredited both the political moderates and the broader\ndemocratic system that they represented. As a result, Syria\u2019s weak parliamentary\ngovernment would enter independence burdened by a lack of legitimacy\u2014a condition,\nas we shall see, that would pave the way for its replacement by a succession of\nautocratic governments. Second, French reliance on martial law and the naked use of\nforce to ensure its control during the mandate period provided those undemocratic\nregimes with a brutal, ready-made template that they would make liberal use of to crush\nany opposition. Finally, the creation of a separate Lebanese state following World War I\nembittered nationalists who believed that it was rightly a part of Greater Syria and would\nlater lead Damascus to intervene in Lebanon to the detriment of both countries.76\nLebanon\nLebanon would avoid the intense unrest that plagued Syria during the interwar\nera. Dominated by the Christian Maronites, it instead enjoyed two decades of relative\nstability under French administration. To many observers at the time, its cohesion\nseemed to be a direct function of the mandatory government\u2019s decision to give it a\npeculiar political structure\u2014the confessional system\u2014in which the different religious\ngroups divided power in proportion to their share of the population. Enjoying broad\nsupport, that arrangement would become sufficiently entrenched during the mandate\nperiod that it would come to form the basis of the system of government that the\nLebanese adopted upon gaining independence in 1943.\nMandatory Lebanon\nThat Lebanon emerged as a separate state was a result of both French colonial\nambitions and the aspirations of the Maronite Christian community that dominated the\nlandlocked region of Mount Lebanon. Unlike Syrian elites who universally opposed\nFrench rule, the Maronite Christians welcomed Paris\u2019s involvement in the region. They\nhad two reasons for doing so. First, they had a history of close cultural, religious, and\neconomic ties with France stretching back to the nineteenth century. Second, and more\nimportantly, Maronite leaders had territorial and political aspirations of their own. Eager\n75 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n271\u201372.\n76 Provence, 271\u201372. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 376\nto break free of Muslim rule, they hoped to take advantage of the fluid postwar situation\nto establish an independent, Maronite-dominated \u201cGreater Lebanon\u201d expanded to its\n\u201c\u2018natural boundaries\u2019\u201d through the inclusion of the coastal strip to the west and the fertile\nBekaa Valley to the east.77\nAs they were aware, however, the enlarged state that they sought would not be\nuniversally popular among the people of the region. Uninterested in living in a Maronite-\ndominated country, other confessional groups\u2014not to mention Syrian nationalists\u2014\nwere certain to oppose its creation and to work aggressively to prevent its\nestablishment. How could the Maronites overcome that resistance? How could they\nsecure both their independence and the additional territory they would need if they were\nto have a functional state? The answer, they believed, lay in Paris. By making clear to\nthe French government that they would be happy to accept its suzerainty, they could\nsecure its help in achieving their dream of an enlarged Maronite state.78\nParis was more than happy to comply. It did so not for altruistic reasons,\nhowever, but instead in furtherance of France\u2019s imperial goals. Experienced colonialists,\nthe French had long used the Maronites as a stalking horse for their interests in the\nregion and saw the establishment of a separate, Christian-dominated Lebanese state\nboth as a way of dividing any potential indigenous opposition to its rule and as an\ninsurance policy that could safeguard its presence in the Levant in the event that Syria\nbecame independent. Accordingly, High Commissioner Gouraud enthusiastically\nannounced in September 1920, the establishment of Greater Lebanon and the inclusion\nwithin it of the additional territory that the Maronites sought.79\nThe creation of the new Lebanese state posed a difficult demographic challenge\nfor the Maronites, however. While they amounted to 76 percent of the population of\nMount Lebanon, they constituted only a negligible minority in the surrounding areas. As\na result, while the territory they hoped to add to Mount Lebanon was essential for the\nestablishment of a functional independent state, its inclusion also threatened to dilute\nthe Maronite share of the population to the point that they would no longer be either\nnumerically or politically dominant.80\nDetermined to push forward with a separate Lebanese state, France responded\nto this challenge in two ways. First, French officials drew the new state\u2019s borders with\ngreat care in order to ensure both that the Maronites continued to constitute a majority\nof Lebanon\u2019s population and that the non-Maronites remained sufficiently divided\nbetween Sunni, Shi\u02bfa, Druze, and other groups such that no single religious community\nhad adequate numbers to contest their dominant position. In this effort the French were\nquite successful: while substantially larger than the Maronites\u2019 traditional power base of\n77 Rogan, The Arabs, 212\u201316.\n78 Rogan, 212\u201316.\n79 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n89\u201390.\n80 Rogan, The Arabs, 212\u201316. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 377\nMount Lebanon, Greater Lebanon nonetheless remained 58 percent Maronite with the\nbalance so divided that none of the other confessional groups was strong enough to\nchallenge their preeminent political position. Second, Paris moved to divide the\nLebanese through the institutionalization of the confessional system: a political\narrangement with antecedents in the old Ottoman millet system that apportioned\nrepresentation among the country\u2019s confessional groups in proportion to their size.\nAccordingly, rather than having the seventeen seats on the elected Representative\nCouncil open to all people, the French instead divided the positions among the major\nreligious communities in proportion to each groups\u2019 share of the population: ten for the\nMaronites, four for the Sunnis, two for the Shi\u02bfa, and one for the Druze. This policy, too,\nproved enormously beneficial to the French. By keeping the Lebanese divided, it\nsucceeded in preventing the emergence of a mandate-wide, anti-French nationalist\nmovement. As a result, in sharp contrast to its experience in neighboring Syria, Paris\nfaced almost no organized opposition to its rule in Lebanon during the mandate era 81\nWhat these policies could not do, however, was to offset the precipitous drop in\nFrench power that had occurred during World War II\u2014a decline that would permit\nLebanon to gain its independence. As in Syria, the beginning of the end for France\u2019s\ncontrol of the mandate came when British and Free French troops seized the country\nfrom its Vichy rulers in 1941. Just as it did with regard to Syria, London followed the\ncampaign by compelling de Gaulle to promise to grant the mandate its independence. In\nno position to refuse thanks to his dependence on Britain, the Free French leader\nquickly complied. He was being disingenuous in doing so, however. Despite public\nassurances to the contrary, he and his colonialist supporters remained steadfastly\ncommitted to keeping Lebanon within Paris\u2019s sphere and schemed to restore full French\ncontrol. Given this goal, they grew alarmed in late 1943 when the Lebanese government\nannounced that it intended to strike from its constitution all provisions granting France\nspecial powers and privileges in the country. Fearing that those revisions would end any\nchance of restoring French rule, de Gaulle responded by ordering his soldiers to arrest\nPresident Beshara al-Khoury (r. 1943-1952).82\nThe crackdown proved to be France\u2019s last hurrah in Lebanon. Massive\ndemonstrations in Beirut and stiff pressure from Great Britain quickly compelled Paris to\ncapitulate and to free al-Khoury. France managed to preserve limited influence in\nLebanon for a few more years, but al-Khoury\u2019s release from custody effectively ended\nany chance that it might reassert control. Thus, by the end of 1943, Lebanon had\nsecured its full independence.83\n81 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n121\u201322, 193.\n82 Rogan, The Arabs, 242\u201344.\n83 Barr, A Line in the Sand: The Anglo-French Struggle for the Middle East, 1914-1948,\n244\u2013152. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 378\nThe National Pact\nHaving achieved independence, the Lebanese now faced the task of devising a\nnew system of government to replace the mandatory one. Doing so would prove to be\ntricky in light of the fact that the confessional system through which the French had\nruled had created powerful vested interests that were disinclined to cede power to a\ncentral state. In response, the leaders of the different sectarian groups negotiated an\ninformal, extraconstitutional power-sharing arrangement called the National Pact that\nwas, in essence, a modified version of the confessional system through which the\nFrench had ruled. Designed to ensure that each of the major religious groups enjoyed\nrepresentation in proportion to its share of the population in 1932\u2014the year of\nLebanon\u2019s most recent census\u2014it allocated seats in parliament according to a formula\nthat guaranteed six positions for the numerically dominant Maronites to every five held\nby representatives of the other confessional groups. In similar fashion, the National Pact\ndivided key positions in the government along religious lines. It stipulated that the\npresident of Lebanon would always be a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni, and the\nspeaker of parliament a Shi\u02bfi; other cabinet positions were reserved for smaller\nconfessional groups such as the Druze and Greek Orthodox Christians.84\nAt first, the National Pact seemed to be a durable and effective agreement.\nUnder it, Lebanon enjoyed substantial economic growth and a degree of stability that\nstood in sharp contrast to the experience of Syria and many other Arab states. Indeed,\nthrough the mid 1950s, Lebanon enjoyed a reputation as a stable and pragmatic state\nwith a capital so cultured and cosmopolitan it came to be known as \u201c\u2018the Paris of the\nMiddle East.\u2019\u201d Over the long term, however, the National Pact revealed itself to be\nenormously problematic for the country. Reinforcing narrow, particularist religious\nidentities, it inhibited the development of a strong civic-political culture that could bind\nthe different confessional groups together into a cohesive whole; in so doing, it\ninstitutionalized the division of the country along religious lines and sowed the seeds of\nboth the political strife that marked the mid-to-late1950s and, worse, the long and\ndebilitating civil war of the 1970s and 1980s. Thus, the French decision to apportion\npolitical power between confessional groups\u2014an action that was designed, at root, to\nachieve Paris\u2019s colonial ends\u2014saddled Lebanon with a legacy of conflict and division\nthat has long outlasted its brief time as a French-controlled mandate.85\nTransjordan\nThe most stable of the Middle Eastern mandates was the Emirate of Transjordan,\nso named because it lies on the east side of the Jordan River. About the size of Indiana,\nthe territory came under the rule of Faysal I\u2019s brother, the Emir Abdallah (r. 1921-1951),\nin 1921 before formally becoming a British mandate in 1922. Thanks to Abdallah\u2019s\n84 Rogan, The Arabs, 240\u201342.\n85 Quote from Jeremy Salt, The Unmaking of the Middle East: A History of Western\nDisorder in Arab Lands (University of California Press, 2008), 186; Rogan, The Arabs,\n241\u201342. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 379\nskilled leadership, this nearly landlocked territory would overcome its peculiar origins\nand a number of daunting early challenges to develop into a stable, if undemocratic,\nstate.\nTransjordan\u2019s relative success is surprising given its accidental\u2014and\ncomplicated\u2014emergence as a state. Initially, it had been part of the Arab Kingdom of\nSyria that Faysal I had established at the end of the First World War. As we have seen,\nParis had destroyed his kingdom in July 1920 and had followed by establishing a\nmandatory regime in Syria. France was unable to incorporate Transjordan into its Syrian\nmandate, however, since it lay within the region that the Sykes-Picot Agreement had\nassigned to Britain. As a consequence, after July 1920, Transjordan became a no-\nman\u2019s land that lacked a recognized government. It remained so until the spring of 1921\nwhen, as part of the \u201cSherifian Solution,\u201d the Cairo Conference acknowledged Abdallah,\nwho had occupied the territory in the fall of 1920, as the emir of Transjordan. To give\nlegal sanction to this move, Britain appended the territory to the Mandate of Palestine;\nhowever, it never intended for the two regions to be unified or for Transjordan to be part\nof a Jewish homeland. London made this clear in 1922 when it formally announced that\nthe land east of the Jordan River would neither be subject to the Balfour Declaration nor\npolitically connected to Palestine.86\nTransjordan\u2019s eventual emergence as a relatively stable state is also remarkable\nin light of the significant issues that Abdallah faced in the early 1920s. Some of those\nproblems were long-term ones. With a population of only 250,000 people, Transjordan\nwas uneasily divided between two groups\u2014the townspeople and the bedouin\u2014and was\ndesperately short of raw materials including ones as basic as water. As a consequence,\nit remained in dire economic circumstances even in comparison to its impoverished\nneighbors. Transjordan also faced a number of more transitory but still serious problems\nincluding rural tax revolts in 1921 and 1922, raids by Ibn Saud\u2019s (r. 1902-1953) al-\nIkhwan warriors, and efforts by Zionists and pro-Zionist British officials to depose\nAbdallah and annex his emirate to Palestine.87\nOn top of those challenges, Abdallah also confronted the fact that native\nTransjordanians and British officials alike were unhappy about the influence in his\ngovernment of the Istiqlalis: former officials from Faysal I\u2019s regime in Syria who\nconstituted Abdallah\u2019s closest confidants. Urban Transjordanians opposed the Istiqlalis\nbecause they viewed them as an alien ruling class that monopolized the best positions\nin the bureaucracy; London distrusted them because it perceived them to be\ntroublemakers who might embroil Britain in a crisis with France by raiding Syria.\nLondon\u2019s worries about the Istiqlalis rose steadily in the early 1920s as their influence\n86 Fieldhouse, Western Imperialism in the Middle East 1914-1958, 223\u201325; quote from\nRogan, The Arabs, 183.\n87 Maan Abu Nowar, The Development of Trans-Jordan 1929-1939: A History of the\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Reading, UK: Ithaca Press, 2006), 4\u20135; Philip Robins, A\nHistory of Jordan, Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019), 23\u2013\n31. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 380\nover Abdallah seemed to grow. Indeed, by early 1924, fears that the Istiqlalis were\ngoing to drag Britain into a costly conflict with France had become so acute that British\nofficials began to give serious consideration to the idea of replacing Abdallah as emir.88\nThe emir was a more effective leader than the British had initially assumed,\nhowever, and he ultimately proved that he could overcome the issues that the mandate\nfaced. Central to his success was his ability to secure good relations with the nomadic\ntribes. Cultivating close personal connections with the tribal shaykhs, he was able to\nbind the militarily powerful bedouins to his government. In turn, his links with the tribal\nleaders led key British officials to come to grasp his value in maintaining order in the\nmandate. As a result, rather than deposing him, they gave Abdallah an ultimatum in\n1924 requiring him to agree to abide by a series of conditions including, most\nimportantly, one demanding that he expel the Istiqlalis from Jordan within five days.\nIntent on maintaining his grip on the throne, Abdallah agreed\u2014a decision that may have\ncost him the backing of his old supporters but one that also improved his standing with\nboth native Transjordanians and, more importantly, the British.89\nAbdallah\u2019s subsequent success in maintaining order in Transjordan and his\ncontinued compliance with British wishes solidified his position. His standing rose so\nhigh, in fact, that London granted his principality official recognition in 1928 through a\ntreaty that formalized the bilateral relationship. It was a good deal for Abdallah, if\nperhaps not for his subjects. At the cost of ceding control of Transjordan\u2019s foreign\nrelations to London, the agreement committed Britain to defend the country from\nexternal attack, confirmed that Transjordan would not be absorbed into Palestine, and\nceded to Abdallah\u2019s government the power to legislate. Importantly, it also allocated\nfunds to strengthen the emirate\u2019s military\u2014the famous Arab Legion. Under the\ncommand of a British officer, John Glubb (1897-1986), it soon became the most\npowerful military force in the Arab world.90\nAbdallah\u2019s continued willingness to back Britain and his success in sustaining\ninternal stability paid further benefits following World War II. In response to\nTransjordan\u2019s steadfast support during the conflict, London agreed to grant it full\nindependence in 1946\u2014though it remained in an informal colonial relationship with\nBritain through the 1950s. Thus, as a result of Abdallah\u2019s adroit management of the\nBritish and his establishment of close ties with the powerful tribes, Transjordan\novercame its difficult beginnings to become an independent and comparatively stable\nstate.91\n88 Robins, A History of Jordan, 23\u201331.\n89 Yoav Alon, The Making of Jordan: Tribes, Colonialism and the Modern State (New\nYork: I.

Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 381\nThe Historical Debate: The Last Ottoman Generation\nScholars have long viewed the interwar era as a critical period in shaping the\ndevelopment of the Middle East. Not only did the imperial powers establish the region\u2019s\nmodern borders between 1920 and 1938, but nearly all of its current-day inter- and\nintra-national conflicts have their roots in the events of that period. In keeping with this\nunderstanding, historians and nationalists alike have long interpreted instances of\narmed resistance to European rule such as the Battle of Maysalun as the seminal\nevents\u2014indeed, as the defining myths\u2014in the establishment of particularist\nnationalisms by peoples expressing their newly-roused sense of national identity.92\nRecently however, the historian Michael Provence has challenged this\nunderstanding of the revolts and anticolonial movements of the 1920s and 1930s. He\nrejects the view that the early challenges to European hegemony in the interwar Arab\nstates constituted the first stirrings of nationalism by people exhibiting \u201crecently\nawakened national consciousness.\u201d On the contrary, he contends that those resistance\nefforts were components of a unified movement orchestrated by the final generation of\npeople who identified as Ottoman and whose intent was not to establish new nations\nbut instead to replace the peace settlement and the division of the region with a unified,\nmodern, and autocratic state laid out along lines similar to the late Ottoman Empire.93\nProvence maintains that the central figures in this effort were men born in the\n1880s and 1890s who graduated from the Ottoman Empire\u2019s elite military academies\nand who served in its armies during World War I. Imbued with the militarist,\nauthoritarian-modernist ideas of the late empire and inspired by Kemal Mustafa\u2019s\nsuccessful effort to overturn the postwar settlement in Anatolia, these officers organized\na broad resistance movement aimed at ejecting the European imperial powers from\nIraq, Syria, Lebanon, and, especially, Palestine. Theirs was an avowedly transnational\neffort, one that rejected the borders that the Europeans had applied to the Middle East\nfollowing World War I and that sought to free the entire region of Western control.\nAccordingly, movement leaders did not limit their resistance efforts to the states in\nwhich they resided, but instead crossed frontiers to fight against the colonial powers.\nThe career of Fawzi al-Qawuqji illustrates this point. A graduate of the Ottoman imperial\nmilitary academy, he participated in the Battle of Maysalun in 1920, helped start the\nGreat Syrian Revolt in 1925, led a militia force during the Arab Revolt in Palestine in the\n1930s, fought against the British in Iraq in 1941, and battled Zionists in 1948. As\nProvence notes, that someone with al-Qawuqji\u2019s background took an active role in\nthese campaigns was not unusual. Indeed, as he points out, former Ottoman officers led\n92 See for example Robert Fisk, The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the\nMiddle East (New York: Vintage, 2005), 813.\n93 Michael Provence, \u201cOttoman Modernity, Colonialism, and Insurgency in the Interwar\nArab Middle East,\u201d International Journal of Middle East Studies 43, no. 2 (2011): 207. Chapter Twelve: The Middle East Under European Control, 1923-1948 Page 382\nall of the resistance efforts in the Middle East between 1918 and 1948 and did so\nwithout regard to the frontiers that the imperial states had demarcated.94\nUltimately, the officers who constituted what Provence calls \u201cthe last Ottoman\ngeneration\u201d failed in their effort to overturn the peace settlement. In fact, despite multiple\nrevolts and insurgencies, they were entirely unsuccessful in their attempts to break\nWestern control of the Middle East. Only as a result of World War II, imperial\nexhaustion, and Great Power rivalry would the mandates gain full independence, by\nwhich point those with an Ottomanist perspective had largely passed from the scene.\nStill, the Ottoman-trained officers had an enormous influence over the development of\nthe postwar Arab states. While they had failed to push out the imperialists, they did\nsucceed in passing the militaristic, undemocratic \u201cauthoritarian modernity\u201d of the late-\nOttoman Empire on to the next generation of nationalist military leaders\u2014the very men\nwho would rule many of the Arab states after the Second World War.95\nConclusion\nThe undemocratic legacy of the last Ottoman generation was far-from obvious in\n1945, however. Instead, to the casual observer, the Arab states that had experienced\nEuropean rule in the 1920s and 1930s seemed poised to emerge from World War II as\nrelatively stable, civilian-led countries. Lebanon appeared to have arrived at a formula\nfor sharing power among its confessional groups, for example, while Transjordan had\nfound stability by building close ties between the monarch and the nomadic tribes. More\nimportantly, the larger, more populous states of Egypt, Iraq, and Syria all had\ndemocratic governments dominated by moderate, secular, political parties.\nAs we have seen, however, the appearance of stability in Egypt and the former\nmandates was a mirage. With the possible exception of Transjordan, those states had\nfailed to develop either close links with their people or strong civic-political cultures. By\nthe late 1940s, as a result, none of their governments and dominant political parties\nenjoyed meaningful legitimacy or broad support.\nIn a calmer era, the moderate elites who dominated those states might have\nmanaged to hold on to power and may have even been able to build the civic-political\nculture on which a state\u2019s legitimacy ultimately rests. Unfortunately for them, however,\nthey did not enjoy the luxury of stable times. Instead, the states they led emerged from\ncolonial dominance just as the contest between Arabs and Zionists for control of\nPalestine was reaching its culmination in 1948. Already on shaky ground, the moderate\nelites and the regimes they led lost all credibility thanks to their inability to prevent the\nestablishment of Israel and soon found themselves overthrown by the pan-Arabist\n94 Provence, 207; Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the\nModern Middle East, passim.\n95 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n3\u20137.

We shall now turn to the\nevents in Palestine that would set the stage for their rise to dominance. Chapter Thirteen, The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948\nTo most people enduring the horrors of World War I, Britain\u2019s conquest of\nPalestine and proclamation of the Balfour Declaration in late 1917 were matters of only\nmarginal consequence. The capture of Jerusalem in December 1917 was a boost to\nAllied morale, of course, and the Balfour Declaration did commit Britain to support the\nestablishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Neither seemed important, however,\nin comparison to the dramatic revolution then convulsing Russia or to the titanic military\nstruggle rapidly approaching its culmination in France.\nIn fact, the wartime events related to Palestine would prove to be of enormous\nregional and even global significance owing to the fact that they permitted the Zionists\nto make tangible progress for the first time in their heretofore halting effort to create a\nJewish state. In doing so, the Balfour Declaration and the conquest of Palestine would\nset in motion a bitter zero-sum struggle between two nationalist movements, one Jewish\nand one Palestinian, over which would control the land that lay between the Jordan\nRiver and the Mediterranean Sea. That struggle would end in a Zionist victory in a\nconflict that Israelis call the War of Independence and that Palestinians refer to as al-\nNakba, or the catastrophe. The result would be the establishment of the state of Israel,\nthe permanent exile of the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian population, and the\nbirth of the region\u2019s most enduring and damaging conflict.\nEstablishing the Mandate, 1918-1922\nZionism Triumphant?\nThe events of 1917 electrified the Zionists. Not only had Britain committed itself\nto supporting the establishment of a Jewish state\u2014as leaders like Chaim Weizmann\n(1874-1952) chose to interpret the Balfour Declaration\u2019s call for a \u201cnational home\u201d\u2014but,\ncritically, it had also taken possession of the territory in which the Zionists hoped to\nfound that state. Subsequent events further boosted their optimism. At the San Remo\nConference in April 1920, London secured Paris and Rome\u2019s formal endorsement of a\nBritish mandate over Palestine and thus ensured that it had the legal standing to put the\nBalfour Declaration into effect. To top it off, London announced that the prominent\nBritish Zionist Herbert Samuel (1870-1963) would serve as the territory\u2019s first high\ncommissioner.1\nThe Zionists\u2019 postwar euphoria peaked in 1919 and 1920. With Britain seemingly\nfirm in its commitment to their movement, Zionist leaders felt confident in pressing\naggressively for the rapid realization of their maximalist goals. Lobbying to secure\n1 Benny Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920\n(New York: Vintage Books, 2001), 75, 78, 80, 97; quote from \u201cThe Balfour Declaration,\nNovember 2, 1917,\u201d accessed May 29, 2020,\nhttps://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/balfour.asp.

Even the cautious Weizmann,\nthe driving force behind the Balfour Declaration, could not hide his excitement at the\nprospect of the rapid establishment of a Jewish state throughout the entirety of the\nmandate. Though he continued to use the amorphous term \u2018homeland\u2019 rather than the\nmore inflammatory word \u2018state\u2019 while attending the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, he\nwas so confident of the impending success of Zionism that he felt comfortable publicly\nexpressing his desire to \u201c\u2018make Palestine as Jewish as England is English.\u2019\u201d2\nThe Arab Riots of 1920 and 1921\nUltimately, Zionist confidence following World War I was badly misplaced. Not\nonly would the establishment of a Jewish state prove to be far from imminent, but Britain\nwould begin to back away from its commitment to the Balfour Declaration just a few\nyears after the conflict had ended. Indeed, more than a quarter century would pass\nbefore the movement finally succeeded in establishing a Jewish state in Palestine. What\naccounted for Zionism\u2019s postwar failure? Why was it unable at that time to achieve a\ngoal that had seemed so tantalizingly close?\nIronically, the movement\u2019s inability to secure a Jewish state at that time was a\nfunction not of its weakness but instead of its strength. With every success, Zionism\nengendered a growing fear among members of the indigenous, Arab-Palestinian\npopulation that a powerful and alien minority was in the process of displacing them from\nthe land on which they and countless generations of their ancestors had lived. The\nissuance of the Balfour Declaration, intemperate statements by Zionist leaders, rising\nJewish land purchases and the concomitant displacement of Arab peasants, or fellahin,\nand, especially, immigration\u201418,500 Jewish people arrived in the territory between\n1919 and 1921\u2014stoked those concerns. In response, the Palestinians began to\nespouse an incipient, proto nationalism. The formation of Muslim-Christian associations\nthroughout the territory in 1918 and the establishment of the First Palestinian Arab\nCongress in 1919 reflected this new outlook. Expressing widespread opposition to\nZionism, these organizations called on Britain to cede the entirety of Palestine to\nFaysal I\u2019s (1883-1933) Arab Kingdom of Syria. They also made clear that they viewed\nthe contest with the Zionists as an existential, winner-take-all fight. As one Arab bluntly\n2 Weizmann quoted in Avi Shlaim, The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World, Revised\nand Expanded (New York: W. W. Norton, 2014), 10; Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 75, 81.

Egged on by mayor Musa Kazi al-Husayni (1853-1934), a crowd of Arabs\nbegan attacking Jewish people and looting Jewish-owned shops in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City\nfollowing a Muslim religious procession on Easter Sunday. The rioting quickly got out of\nhand. Indeed, it was so intense and involved so many people that the British lost control\nof Jerusalem for three days and only managed to restore order after they declared\nmartial law and deployed troops. By the time the soldiers had suppressed the riot, five\nJewish people had been killed and 216 had been injured while four Arabs had died and\ntwenty-three had been wounded.4\nPalestinian fear of Zionism and mounting anger toward the British produced a\nsecond round of intercommunal clashes the following year. Stories of rising immigration\nand Jewish land purchases had left the Arabs primed for a fight; ironically, however, it\nwas a May Day brawl between rival Jewish communist and socialist groups in Jaffa that\nsparked the return of intercommunal violence. Initially, the fighting remained confined to\nthe leftist Zionist groups. Once it spilled over into a nearby Arab neighborhood,\nhowever, it quickly transformed into a vicious pogrom in which Arab mobs attacked\nJewish people and shops in both Jaffa and the surrounding countryside. The British\nonce more responded aggressively to the rioting. Declaring a state of emergency, they\nsent sizeable contingents of troops and armored cars into battle against armed bands of\nArabs and even dropped bombs on villages. When the smoke finally cleared, British\nofficials were shocked by the scale of the Jaffa riots: forty-seven Jewish people had\ndied and one-hundred-and-forty-six had been wounded, while forty-eight Arabs had\nbeen killed and seventy-three injured.5\nDominated by the Labor Zionists\u2014so called because they came from the\nsocialist parties and labor unions\u2014the Zionist leadership found the riots of 1920 and,\nespecially, 1921 deeply concerning. They questioned the capacity and willingness of the\nBritish to protect Jewish people in the mandate, wondered whether their movement\nwould be able to overcome Arab resistance, and worried that the Yishuv, the Jewish\ncommunity in Palestine, was vulnerable to further attacks. Above all, they were\nconcerned that the scale of the violence might lead either prospective Jewish\nimmigrants or the British to arrive at the truth: that the Zionists faced a coherent, proto-\nnationalist Palestinian opposition. If Jewish Europeans drew such a conclusion,\n3 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 198; quote from Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-\nArab Conflict, 1881-1920, 89\u201391.\n4 Tom Segev, One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate\n(New York: Metropolitan Books, 1999), 127\u201344.\n5 Michael Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern\nMiddle East (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017), 127\u201328; Segev, One\nPalestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, 173\u2013201. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 387\nimmigration would slow to a trickle and the Zionist share of the population in Palestine\nwould remain tiny; if the British did, London would almost certainly respond by\nweakening or even abandoning its commitment to the Balfour Declaration in order to\nappease the numerically superior Arabs. In either case, the goal of Zionism\u2014the\nestablishment of a Jewish state in Palestine\u2014would be doomed to failure.6\nTo counter such conclusions, the Zionists deployed two arguments. First,\ncontending that the Arab and Jewish peoples shared common interests, they rejected\nthe idea that ethnic tensions caused the riots and instead located the roots of the\nviolence in class conflict between the exploited fellahin, and the Palestinian notables\nwho owned the land they worked. The latter, the Zionists continued, had stirred up the\notherwise apolitical Arab masses with lurid tales of Jewish aggression and land\npurchases in a successful effort to divert the peasants\u2019 justified anger\u2014creating, in the\nprocess, a misplaced fury that soon manifested itself in the form of anti-Jewish rioting.\nSecond, the Labor Zionists not only disputed the idea that Zionism was a threat to the\nwell-being of the Arab peasants but argued that the continued inflow of Jewish\nimmigrants and capital would transform Palestine\u2019s feudal economy into a dynamic,\nmodern one that would dramatically lift Arab living standards. Once the economic\nbenefits of Zionism began to manifest themselves, they added, any lingering resentment\namong the Palestinian masses toward the movement would rapidly dissipate as they\nrefocused their anger on the landlords who had for so long exploited them.7\nThe Churchill White Paper of 1922\nThese arguments may have reassured Jewish Europeans thinking about\nimmigrating to Palestine, but they failed to move British officials. Administrators in the\nmandate possessed enough experience managing colonies to tell the difference\nbetween transitory unrest and serious problems, and what they saw in Palestine in 1920\nand 1921 deeply concerned them. Indeed, the sheer scale of the violence suggested\nnot only that Palestinian opposition to the Balfour Declaration was far more serious than\nthe Zionists claimed but that the disorder in the mandate was likely to continue unless\nthe British addressed at least some of the Arabs\u2019 objections.8\nThe riots also laid bare for the first time the existence of significant tension\nbetween policymakers in London and those serving in Palestine over the question of\nwhich community the British should favor. Officials in the capital lamented the recent\nviolence in Palestine but, insulated by distance from the disorder and in close contact\nwith key Zionist leaders, remained committed to fulfilling Britain\u2019s promise to establish a\nJewish homeland in the territory. To administrators in Jerusalem, in contrast, the Jaffa\nriots had exposed the contradictions inherent in London\u2019s simultaneous promise to\n6 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 104.\n7 David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the\nCreation of the Modern Middle East (New York: Avon Books, 1989), 516\u201327; Morris,\nRighteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 104\u20135.\n8 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 102\u20134. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 388\nestablish a national homeland for the Jews and its pledge to uphold the rights of the\n\u201cexisting non-Jewish communities.\u201d They argued that since there was simply no feasible\nway that Britain could meet both of those obligations and since the Palestinians\nconstituted the vast majority of the territory\u2019s population, the mandatory government\nshould pursue policies that favored the Arabs. In keeping with this line of thinking,\nofficials in Jerusalem moved to appease the Palestinians immediately after the Jaffa\nriots by placing temporary restrictions on immigration and by pressing London to back\naway from the commitment it had made in the Balfour Declaration to help the Zionists\nestablish a Jewish national home in Palestine.9\nReconciling these differences fell to Secretary of State for the Colonies Winston\nChurchill (1874-1965), who did so in 1922 in a statement colloquially referred to as the\nChurchill White Paper. It included three main provisions designed to ease Arab\nconcerns. First, while the document restated Britain\u2019s commitment to help the Zionists\nestablish a national home in Palestine and confirmed that Jewish people had a right to\nimmigrate to the territory, it also reassured the Arabs that the Balfour Declaration did not\nmean that all of Palestine \u201cshould be converted into a Jewish national home, but [only]\nthat such a home should be founded in Palestine.\u201d Second, it put restrictions on\nimmigration for the first time. Finally, the paper formally detached Transjordan from\nPalestine.10\nThe British moved quickly to put the Churchill White Paper into effect. To ensure\nZionist interests, London had the text of the Balfour Declaration formally incorporated\ninto the mandate charter that the League of Nations issued in July 1922, and it arranged\nfor the world body to accredit an important Yishuv organization, the Zionist Executive,\nas the official representative of the Jewish community in Palestine. Meanwhile, to ease\nArab concerns, British officials in the mandate began enforcing limits on immigration in\naccordance with the white paper.11\nChurchill was pleased with the results of his work. In his eyes, London had\naddressed each party\u2019s concerns and had done so in a way that resolved the\ncontradiction inherent in the Balfour Declaration. With limits on immigration now in\neffect, the Palestinians could be certain that they would not lose their livelihood to\nJewish settlers or see the entire mandate swallowed up by a Zionist state. With the\ndeclaration having been formally incorporated into the mandate charter, meanwhile, the\nZionists could rest assured that they would get the national home that they sought. For\n9 Charles D.

Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 389\na time, events in Palestine appeared to sustain Churchill\u2019s favorable assessment of\nLondon\u2019s new approach. Indeed, the absence of intercommunal violence in the\nmandate over the next few years suggested strongly that the colonial secretary really\nhad resolved the conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Jewish immigrants.12\nIn reality, neither the Palestinians nor the Zionists were in the least bit pleased\nwith the terms of the Churchill White Paper. The Arabs disliked it because they did not\nwant any further Jewish immigration and because they believed\u2014correctly\u2014that the\nZionists remained intent on establishing a Jewish state throughout the entirety of the\nmandate. For their part, meanwhile, the Labor Zionists who dominated the Zionist\nExecutive were unhappy with it because it appeared to indicate that Britain was backing\naway from the commitment it had made in the Balfour Declaration.13\nThe Simmering Conflict, 1922-1936\nZionism\u2019s New Approach\nNonetheless, the Zionist Executive opted to accept the terms of the Churchill\nWhite Paper. What explains this decision? Why did it agree to abide by a deal that most\nZionists believed was contrary to their movement\u2019s interests? It did so for two reasons.\nFirst, the Zionist leadership understood that Jewish people accounted for only a small\nminority of Palestine\u2019s population\u2014just 11 percent according to the 1922 census\u2014and\nwere thus not in a position to achieve the dream of a Jewish state without the continued\nbacking of their British patron. Second, they agreed to abide by the new limits that\nChurchill had imposed because they viewed those restrictions as merely temporary\nones that they would be able to discard after they had founded the Zionist state. That is,\nonce they had established control of a part of Palestine\u2014however small\u2014they could\nthen bring in as many immigrants as they liked and could expand their fledgling state to\ninclude additional territory.14\nAccordingly, the Labor Zionists effected a significant\u2014if tactical\u2014policy change\nfollowing the riots of 1920 and 1921 and the issuance of the Churchill White Paper. For\nthe time being, they abandoned the strategy they had adopted after World War I of\ntrying to secure the rapid establishment of a large Jewish state. Instead, in the words of\nthe historian Avi Shlaim, the Zionists adopted a more pragmatic, gradualist policy of\nbuilding up their position in Palestine \u201cstep by step, immigrant by immigrant, settlement\nby settlement\u201d until such time that they had the international support and domestic\nstrength needed to declare the establishment of the Zionist state.15\n12 Provence, 87\u201388.\n13 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 10.\n14 \u201cPalestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922,\u201d n.d.,\nhttps://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1922.pdf; Smith,\nPalestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 116.\n15 Shlaim, The Iron Waljl, 11. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 390\nRevisionist Zionism and the Iron Wall\nThe Zionists were not unanimous in supporting the shift to a gradualist policy,\nhowever. Instead, under the leadership of a dissident member of the Zionist Executive,\nthe Russian-born Ze\u2019ev Jabotinsky (1880-1940), a minority rejected the pragmatic\nstrategy of the mainstream Labor Zionists in favor of a far-more aggressive and\nmilitaristic approach. Called revisionists because they wanted to revise the mandate\u2019s\nterms so that Transjordan was again subject to the Balfour Declaration, Jabotinsky and\nhis supporters argued that the incremental strategy would not succeed and that the\nZionist Executive could achieve that goal only by abandoning gradualism in favor of the\nimmediate establishment of a Jewish state that included territory on both banks of the\nJordan River. Jabotinsky repeatedly laid out his position before the Zionist Executive in\nthe early 1920s; with the leadership firmly committed to gradualism, however, his\nobjections fell on deaf ears. Frustrated, he resigned his seat in 1923 and threw himself\ninto the task of organizing a political opposition movement, later known as the\nRevisionist Party, and an associated paramilitary youth organization called Betar. The\nnew party enjoyed only modest support at first and remained very much in the minority\nduring the interwar period; nonetheless, gaining a small-but-committed following, it\nprovided an influential ideological challenge to the Labor Zionists.16\nJabotinsky\u2019s embrace of militarism stemmed from his rejection of the Labor\nZionists\u2019 belief that a Jewish state could be established peacefully in Palestine. Their\nposition was an absurd one, he maintained; given the zero-sum nature of the dispute\nover the mandate, the question of which people would control Palestine could only be\nsettled through force. No promise of economic gain or assurance that a Jewish\nhomeland would not harm the territory\u2019s non-Jewish residents would placate the Arabs\nor obscure the fact that Zionism was, at heart, a \u201c\u2018colonizing venture\u2019\u201d\u2014one that the\nPalestinians, whom he openly acknowledged were a national group, were bound to\noppose. As he wrote,\n\"\u2018[e]very indigenous people . . . will resist alien settlers as long as they see\nany hope of ridding themselves of the danger of foreign settlement. This is\nhow the Arabs will behave and go on behaving so long as they possess a\ngleam of hope that they can prevent \u2018Palestine\u2019 from becoming the Land of\nIsrael.\u2019\u201d17\nIn light of this fact, he continued, the Zionists could ensure their security only\nthrough the erection of a metaphorical \u201c\u2018Iron Wall:\u2019\u201d a powerful military that would first\nestablish the Jewish state through brute strength and then protect it by responding to\nevery Arab provocation\u2014however minor\u2014with overwhelming force. Eventually, after\nrepeated defeats had exhausted the Palestinians of any hope that they could destroy\nthe Jewish state, the Zionists would finally be able to engage in productive negotiations\n16 Shlaim, 11\u201313.\n17 Rashid Khalidi, The Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian Struggle for Statehood,\nReprint Edition (Boston: Beacon Press, 2006), 72; quote from Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 14. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 391\nwith the Arabs aimed at granting them limited rights in a Jewish-controlled country.\nThus, in Jabotinsky\u2019s eyes, efforts to placate the Palestinians were a waste of time.\nOnly overwhelming force could establish the Jewish state, and only disproportionate\nstrength could ensure its survival.18\nJabotinksy\u2019s differences with the Labor Zionists thus appeared to be enormous.\nWhere he acknowledged that Palestinian resistance was inevitable and reflected\nnationalist sentiment, his labor opponents instead publicly clung to the view that the real\nconflict in the mandate was a class-based one that would disappear as the economy\nimproved. Likewise, while he asserted that the Zionists could only establish a Jewish\nstate through force, they continued to declare that the movement could do so through\nnegotiation and compromise. At heart, however, the disagreements between the Labor\nZionists and the Revisionists were more about tactics than substance. In truth, the\nmoderates shared many of Jabotinsky\u2019s views and pursued their seemingly more\nconciliatory approach not because it reflected deeply held views but because they\nbelieved it would avoid alienating Britain: the patron on whose assistance the\nachievement of their goal ultimately depended. 19\nTheir confidential statements made clear just how similar their views were to the\nRevisionists\u2019 position. For example, the prominent Zionist H. M. Kalvaryski admitted not\nlong after the Jaffa riots that the violence was not the product of class conflict; as he\nwrote,\u201c\u2018[i]t is pointless to consider this a question only of effendis [elites] . . . we should\nrealize that we have to reckon with an Arab national movement.\u2019\u201d More importantly,\ndespite their public commitment to peaceful coexistence, the Labor Zionist leaders who\ndominated the Zionist Executive\u2014renamed the Jewish Agency in 1929\u2014privately\nagreed with Jabotinsky that their movement would need to use force to establish and\nmaintain a Jewish state. As Ben Gurion wrote confidentially in the 1930s, only after\nrepeated military defeats had produced \u201c\u2018total despair on the part of the Arabs . . . may\nthe Arabs acquiesce in a Jewish Eretz [greater] Israel.\u2019\u201d Thus, though the Labor Zionists\ncontinued to declare their opposition to Jabotinsky in public, they privately accepted the\nbroad thrust of his thinking and disagreed with him far more about timing and rhetoric\nthan method or outcome.20\nZionist Institution Building\nIn the meantime, the mainstream Labor Zionists moved to strengthen the\nYishuv\u2019s position. With the Jewish community already possessing a mature national\nconsciousness, they focused on creating a series of interlocking political, cultural, and\neconomic structures that would serve as the foundation of the coming Jewish state and\nsociety. They established a parliament, the Haganah militia, an executive body known\nas the Jewish National Council, and the Histadrut, a federation of labor unions that\nrepresented workers but that also provided health care and pursued industrial\n18 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 13\u201315.\n19 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 104.\n20 Kalvaryski quoted in Morris, 104; Ben Gurion quoted in Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 18\u201320. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 392\ndevelopment. These organizations worked closely with the existing Jewish National\nFund, which purchased land for Jewish immigrants, and with the Zionist Executive,\nwhich, in addition to its role as the Yishuv\u2019s League of Nations-sanctioned\nrepresentative to the mandatory power, also promoted immigration to Palestine. Tying\nthese institutions together was the Ahdut HaAvoda, or Labor Unity Party, which, under\nthe leadership of Ben Gurion and his allies, had been instrumental in founding the\nHaganah and Histadrut. In 1930, it merged with another socialist party to become\nMapai\u2014the political party that would dominate Israeli politics during the country\u2019s first\nthree decades. Able to draw on the experience that highly educated European Jewish\nimmigrants brought with them, these institutions grew rapidly in scale and\nsophistication. By 1930, as a result, they functioned as a de facto government for the\nYishuv\u2014one, as we shall see, that left it well prepared for eventual independence.21\nJewish economic dynamism matched this institutional growth. Operating\nseparately from the Palestinian economy\u2014and thus implicitly undermining the claim that\nthe growth of the Jewish community would raise Arab living standards\u2014the Yishuv\neconomy underwent rapid growth during the mandate period. Benefitting from the\ncontinued arrival of highly educated Jewish European immigrants and the ongoing influx\nof huge quantities of capital, it expanded at a blistering average annual rate of\n13.2 percent during the 1920s\u2014roughly twice the rate at which the mandate\u2019s Arab\neconomy grew. Jewish economic development was impressively diversified, moreover.\nIt included not only industrial growth in urban areas but also the establishment of\ndozens of agricultural settlements in the countryside.22\nPalestinian Institution Building\nThe Palestinians, too, engaged in institution and nation building in the 1920s.\nThe Palestinian Arab Congress continued to meet regularly and, in 1920, elected a\ngoverning board called the Arab Executive to coordinate resistance to Zionism. The\nPalestinians also gained control of two new, British-created institutions: the Supreme\nMuslim Council (SMC), which administered awqaf revenue, and the post of Grand Mufti\nof Jerusalem and Palestine, which afforded its first holder, the young nationalist Hajj\nAmin al-Husayni (c. 1897-1974), with substantial authority thanks to the power it vested\nin him to name Islamic judges, or qadis, to their posts. Meanwhile, following France\u2019s\ndestruction of Faysal\u2019s Arab Kingdom of Syria in July 1920, the Palestinians abandoned\ntheir earlier pan-Arabist attempts to attach Palestine to greater Syria in favor of a new\neffort to transform the mandate into an independent, Arab state\u2014a change that abetted\nthe development of a strong, Palestinian nationalist identity.23\n21 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 109\u201310.\n22 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 13\u201315.\n23 Rashid Khalidi, \u201cThe Palestinians and 1948: The Underlying Cause of Failure,\u201d in The\nWar for Palestine: Rewriting the History of 1948, ed. Eugene L. Rogan and Avi Shlaim\n(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001), 21\u201323. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 393\nWhile these institution- and nation-building efforts may appear significant at first\nglance, they were anemic in comparison to the Zionists\u2019 accomplishments in the\ninterwar era. In stark contrast to the Yishuv\u2019s efficiently run bodies, Palestinian political\nstructures were weak, riven by debilitating factional disputes, and incapable of providing\nthe direction that modern states and societies require. What accounted for the\nineffectiveness of these institutions? Why were the Palestinians unable to keep pace\nwith the Yishuv in establishing the sort of quasi-state political, military, and economic\nstructures that could, when the time was right, be transformed into state institutions?\nTraditionally, historians have argued that three shortcomings intrinsic to\nPalestinian society explain the failure to develop governing structures comparable to\nthose of the Yishuv. First, they have maintained that sharp class, religious, and political\ndifferences prevented the Palestinians from presenting a unified front against either the\nZionists or the British. Most notably, the intense political rivalry between the grand mufti\nal-Husayni\u2019s dominant faction and the loose opposition party controlled by his family\u2019s\ntraditional rivals, the Nashashibi clan, diverted Arab energies away from confronting\nZionism and into internecine battles. Second, adherents of the traditional view have\nnoted that the Palestinians were far-less developed politically than the Zionists and\nlacked their rivals\u2019 organizational sophistication and diplomatic tact; as a result, the\nZionists were able to outmaneuver them at every turn. Finally, emphasizing historical\ncontingency, proponents of this interpretation have asserted that Palestinian leaders\nwere peculiarly ineffective and frequently inclined, as the historian Benny Morris puts it,\n\u201cto shoot themselves in the foot.\u201d24\nConsiderable evidence seems to support this interpretation. For example, the\nArabs initially rejected High Commissioner Samuel\u2019s proposal in 1922 to establish a\njoint legislative council for the mandate based on a proportional system of\nrepresentation that would have given them more seats than the Zionists. The\nPalestinians eventually warmed to the offer, but, as would seemingly happen again and\nagain, the proposal was no longer on the table when they belatedly changed their\nminds. Such episodes have long shaped interpretations of the Palestinian nationalist\neffort in the interwar era and have led many scholars to conclude that there is more than\na grain of truth to Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban\u2019s (1915-2002) famous quip that\n\u201c[t]he Palestinians never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d25\n24 Quote from Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-\n1920, 109; Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 65\u201366.\n25 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 65\u201366; Quote from Kofi Annan and Nader Mousavizadeh,\nInterventions: A Life in War and Peace (Penguin Books, 2013), 253; Appropriately,\ngiven his long tenure as Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Abba Eban actually said that \"the\nArabs never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity\u201d (italics mine). Over time,\nhowever, Abba Eban\u2019s quip has been transformed in the popular imagination to refer to\nthe Palestinians. Even former UN Secretary General Kofi Anan (1938-1918) got this\nwrong in his autobiography. See Jerome Slater, Mythologies Without End: The US, Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 394\nThe traditional view has not gone unchallenged, however. While acknowledging\nthe manifest failings of the Palestinian leadership, a number of historians have recently\ntaken issue with the conventional interpretation by arguing that it fails to capture\nadequately the significant constitutional constraints under which the Palestinians\noperated or to note the very different political circumstances in which the Arabs and\nZionists found themselves. Indeed, they maintain that trying to explain Palestinian\nfailures by focusing on their shortcomings vis-\u00e0-vis their Zionist rivals is of little\nanalytical value. As the historian Rashid Khalidi notes, contrasting the Palestinians with\nsophisticated immigrants from modern Europe amounts to \u201ccomparing the\nincomparable.\u201d Far more useful, he contends, is to contrast them with the Arabs who\nlived in other parts of the region. As he points out, the Arabs of Egypt, Syria, and Iraq\nwere no more sophisticated than the Palestinians yet were able to make significant\nprogress toward the achievement of independence in the face of vigorous resistance\nfrom the powerful British and French empires. Given Arab achievements against those\nmighty states, in other words, the Zionists\u2019 relative sophistication cannot alone explain\nthe Palestinians\u2019 remarkable lack of success in the interwar period.26\nToday, a growing number of historians argue that the Palestinians\u2019 lack of\ninstitutional success was largely a product of the mandate\u2019s peculiar political structure.\nScholars like Khalidi, the historian Michael Provence, and others now conclude that the\nPalestinians were unable to secure their goals not because they were less sophisticated\nthan the Zionists or because they suffered from peculiar amounts of factional infighting\nbut instead because they found themselves caught in a constitutional \u201ciron cage\u201d from\nwhich they were never able to escape. This trap was a brutal catch-22: to get formal\npolitical representation from the British, the Palestinians had to consent to the terms of\nthe mandate; accepting the mandate, however, meant acknowledging the right of the\nZionists to establish a national home in Palestine\u2014the precise turn of events that the\nPalestinians sought political standing to avert. To Provence, this dilemma explains why\nthe Arabs pursued seemingly counterproductive courses such as their refusal to go\nalong with Samuel\u2019s offer to establish a legislative council based on proportional\nrepresentation. As he notes, the Palestinians did not reject that proposal because they\nwere shortsighted or caught up in pointless factional infighting; they did so instead\nbecause it would have required them to formally accept the creation of the very Jewish\nhomeland that they were fighting to prevent. 27\nThese scholars also argue that British-imposed constitutional constraints\naccounted for many\u2014though not all\u2014of the fault lines that split the Palestinians. Here,\nthey center their critique on the Supreme Muslim Council and the Grand Mufti of\nJerusalem. The most powerful Arab institutions in the mandate, these structures were,\nin Khalidi\u2019s words, \u201c\u2018invented traditions\u2019\u201d that Britain had established to define the\nIsrael, and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1917-2020 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020),\n31.\n26 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, XLV, 22\u201330.\n27 Khalidi, 31\u201348; Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the\nModern Middle East, 196\u201397. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 395\nPalestinians in religious rather than national terms. Coming with attractive salaries and\npatronage opportunities, seats on the SMC and the post of grand mufti also amounted\nto de facto bribes that ensured that Palestinian elites were beholden to London and\nwould thus toe the imperial line and encourage acceptance of British rule. Finally, these\nscholars contend that Britain used these institutions to divide the Palestinians. By\ncarefully appointing members from both the dominant al-Husayni group and the al-\nNashashibi opposition to seats on the SMC, the British ensured that the body served as\nan arena for factional skirmishes among the Palestinian leadership rather than as a\ncenter of resistance to Zionism or imperial rule. In other words, the infighting that put the\nPalestinians at a disadvantage was not a function of flaws intrinsic to their society, but\ninstead the product of a deliberate British policy of divide and conquer.28\nImmigration and Land Purchases\nThe Zionists\u2019 institutional advantage over the Palestinians proved central to the\nrapid expansion of the Yishuv in the 1920s. Thanks to the efficient work of the Zionist\nAgency, more than 70,000 Ashkenazi Jews would immigrate to Palestine over the\ncourse of the decade. Many of those immigrants settled on the more than 240,000\nacres of arable land that the Jewish National Fund purchased for them in the 1920s\u2014\nland that not only dramatically increased the Jewish community\u2019s holdings but that also\nmade possible the establishment of more than fifty new agricultural settlements.29\nStepped up land purchases and immigration deeply troubled the mandate\u2019s\nPalestinian population in the decade after World War I. While immigration had been a\nconcern since the 1880s, it gained new salience in the 1920s owing to the rapid growth\nof the Jewish community, which, thanks to the aforementioned arrival of Ashkenazi\nJewish people more-than doubled between 1922 and 1931\u2014an ominous trend that fed\ngrowing concerns among the Arabs that the Zionists would soon have the critical mass\nneeded to declare the establishment of a Jewish state. Land transactions were equally\nworrisome. The Zionists were not only buying large tracts, but, in many cases, were\nalso evicting Palestinians whose families had worked that land as tenant farmers for\ngenerations. Reduced thereafter to seasonal agricultural work or day labor in the\nmandate\u2019s towns and cities, the dispossessed saw the security and stability that they\nhad once enjoyed replaced by a painful precarity.30\nLike all issues related to the Zionist-Palestinian conflict, the impact of Jewish land\npurchases on Arab tenant farmers remains hotly debated. Based on studies of mandate\nrecords, Israel\u2019s backers contend that property transfers to the Zionists resulted in the\ndisplacement only a small number of Arab farmers. Supporters of the Palestinians\n28 Khalidi, \u201cThe Palestinians and 1948: The Underlying Cause of Failure,\u201d 21\u201325.\n29 Rogan, The Arabs, 198.\n30 \u201cPalestine: Report and General Abstracts of the Census of 1922\u201d; \u201cCensus of\nPalestine 1931,\u201d n.d.,\nhttps://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1931.pdf; Smith,\nPalestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 130\u201331; Rogan, The Arabs, 198. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 396\ncounter by arguing that the documentary evidence masks the true extent of evictions\nand that the actual figure is far higher. Regardless, the political impact was clear:\nconcerns about being dispossessed radicalized many tenant farmers and\u2014to the\ndelight of those who feared being force off their land\u2014compelled the Arab leadership in\nthe mandate to loudly call for an outright ban on further land transfers. The fellahin\nwould likely have been much-less enthusiastic about those demands had they known\nthat many of the loudest voices publicly denouncing land transfers were at the same\ntime quietly profiting from the practice. Indeed, a significant share of the Palestinian\nleadership\u2014including fully one quarter of the men who served on the Arab Executive\u2014\nwere secretly selling land to the Zionists at the very time that they were vocally attacking\nthe practice.31\nStill, despite the Palestinians\u2019 apprehensions about continued immigration and\nland sales, the absence of significant conflict following the Jaffa riot in 1921 led British\nofficials to conclude that the Churchill White Paper had been successful in restoring\npeace to the mandate. Benefitting from good economic times for much of the 1920s,\nBritain\u2019s efforts to conciliate both parties did, indeed, appear to have eased\nintercommunal tensions and to have led the Palestinians and Zionists to come to an\naccommodation, even if they did so grudgingly. On top of that, a decline in immigration\nin the late 1920s\u2014the Jewish population remained essentially unchanged from 1926 to\n1932 and even fell slightly in 1927 when net emigration exceeded immigration\u2014\nsuggested to many that the struggle between Zionism and Palestinian nationalism had\npeaked and was winding down.32\nThe 1929 Palestine Riots\nA new round of intercommunal conflict at the end of the decade made clear,\nhowever, that the struggle for control of Palestine was as white hot as ever. Rising Arab\nworries about Jewish immigration and land purchases set the stage for renewed\nclashes, but it was a religious issue related to the Wailing, or Western Wall that\nultimately sparked the violence. A place where devout Jewish people had prayed for\ncenturies, the Wailing Wall is all that remains of the Second Temple that sat on the\nTemple Mount from 516 BCE until its destruction in 70 CE. While holy to Jewish people,\nthe wall is also part of the enclosure to Islam\u2019s third-holiest site, the Haram al-Sharif, or\nholy sanctuary, on which sits the Dome of the Rock shrine and the al-Aqsa Mosque,\nand is thus significant for Muslims as well.33\nThe Haram al-Sharif, the Wailing Wall, the alley that runs along the wall, and the\nadjoining neighborhood were all part of a waqf. However, the people who directed those\nendowments did not control entry to the sites. Instead, it was the Status Quo, a formal\n31 Segev, One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, 274\u2013\n75.\n32 Khalidi, \u201cThe Palestinians and 1948: The Underlying Cause of Failure,\u201d 24; Kirsten E.\nSchulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict (New York: Pearson, 2008), 8.\n33 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 131. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 397\narrangement that that the Ottoman government had adopted in the nineteenth century\nand that the British continued to observe, that governed access to the religious sites. By\nits terms, Jewish people were entitled to pray at the Wailing Wall; to ensure free\npassage along the alley, however, they were banned from placing furnishing of any kind\nin front of it.34\nA dispute over the observance of the Status Quo that began in 1928 would turn\nthe Wailing Wall into an intercommunal flashpoint and spark renewed violence the\nfollowing year. The conflict began on the Day of Atonement in September 1928 when\nconservative Jewish worshippers erected screens to separate men from women praying\nat the wall. Fearing that the dividers were part of a Zionist plot to take control of the\nWailing Wall and the Temple Mount, Muslim Palestinians demanded that the British\nrestore the Status Quo and remove the screens; eager to uphold the peace, the\nmandatory government complied. Restoration of the Status Quo did not put the issue to\nrest, however. Instead, extremists in both camps issued evermore provocative\nstatements and took increasingly inflammatory actions culminating in members of Betar\nholding a demonstration in front of the wall in mid-August 1929 at which they chanted\n\u201c\u2018the wall is ours.\u2019\u201d This affront was too much for Muslim Palestinians. On August 23,\n1929, enraged Arab peasants poured out of the Haram al-Sharif following Friday\nprayers and attacked Jewish people and businesses. As news of the attacks travelled,\nthe violence intensified and spread throughout the mandate. By the time British\nreinforcements finally managed to regain control on August 29, 133 Jewish people\u2014\nincluding nearly the entire Jewish community of Hebron\u2014and 116 Arabs had been\nkilled.35\nThe Passfield White Paper\nBritain\u2019s response revealed the intractable nature of the conflict. Shocked by the\nextent of the violence, London sent a delegation to Palestine called the Shaw\nCommission to ascertain the causes of the riots. It determined that the religious dispute\nwas merely a symptom of a larger issue: \u201c\u2018the twofold fear of the Arabs that by Jewish\nimmigration and land purchases they may be deprived of their livelihood and in time\npass under the political domination of the Jews.\u2019\u201d In response, the Labor Party\ngovernment of Prime Minister Ramsey MacDonald (r. 1929-1935) moved to formally\nalter Britain\u2019s approach to Palestine through the issuance of the Passfield White Paper\nin 1931. It marked a significant change in policy. By limiting further immigration to the\nmandate\u2019s \u201ceconomic \u2018absorptive capacity\u2019\u201d and by placing stringent restrictions on land\nsales to the Zionists, it effectively abandoned the Balfour Declaration\u2019s open-ended\ncommitment to a Jewish homeland in Palestine in favor of a more even-handed\napproach.36\n34 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n197.\n35 Provence, 197\u2013200.\n36 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 131\u201333. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 398\nUnsurprisingly, the Passfield White Paper created intense feelings among both\nPalestinians and Zionists. The Arabs were thrilled when they read its terms and\nconcluded that their appeals to justice and majority rule had finally made an impression\non the British. In contrast, Jewish leaders found the document alarming. Viewing it as\nan existential danger to the Zionist project\u2014one that threatened to prevent the Yishuv\nfrom ever having the numbers needed to establish a Jewish state\u2014they responded by\nmounting an intense and highly effective political pressure campaign against\nMacDonald. Vulnerable owing to the fact that his was a minority government, the prime\nminister soon capitulated. In February 1931, he issued a public letter addressed to\nChaim Weizmann in which he repudiated the Passfield White Paper and recommitted\nBritain to the terms of the Balfour Declaration. Drafted in its essentials by Weizmann,\nthe letter explicitly declared that London would place no limits on immigration or land\npurchases. Now, it was the Palestinians turn to be furious. With their hopes first raised\nand then dashed, they bitterly criticized the MacDonald government and denounced his\nnote to Weizmann by calling it the \u201c\u2018Black Letter.\u2019\u201d37\nThe riots of 1929 and the conflict over the Passfield White Paper laid to rest any\nillusion either that the situation in Palestine was peacefully resolving itself or that it could\nbe settled through negotiations. In response, Zionists, British officials, and Arabs alike\nreexamined their assumptions and approaches to the evolving situation in the mandate.\nFor the Palestinians, London\u2019s quick retreat from the Passfield White Paper indicated\nthat reasoned arguments based on appeals for justice and self-determination would\nneither arrest the continued growth of the Jewish community nor stop the establishment\nof a Zionist state; as a consequence, many younger, more extreme Arabs began to\norganize armed militias. For the Zionists, the ferocity of the Arab attacks in 1929 and\nBritain\u2019s shocking inability to protect the Yishuv ended any lingering hopes that they\nmight secure a Jewish state through peaceful means. After the riots, accordingly, the\nLabor Zionists transformed the Haganah from a weak, decentralized militia into a\npowerful proto army. Even that move did not go far enough for a small group of\nHaganah officers. Determined to retaliate aggressively to any further Arab attacks, they\nformed a separate militia group called Irgun that soon became the military arm of the\nRevisionist Party. For the British, finally, the events of 1929 laid bare for the first time\nthat Palestine was a poisoned chalice, a perpetual trouble spot that defied easy\u2014or, for\nthat matter, difficult\u2014solutions. They would spend the next decade seeking desperately\nto find some formula that could reconcile competing Arab and Zionist demands while\npermitting continued imperial control. They never succeeded.38\nThe Great Depression and Hitler\u2019s Rise to Power\nMeanwhile, surging antisemitism in Europe in the early 1930s and the German\ndictator Adolf Hitler\u2019s (r. 1933-1945) rise to power dramatically altered the situation in\nPalestine. Firmly in control of Germany by early 1933, Hitler and his supporters wasted\nno time in stepping up violence against Jewish people and in imposing ever-more\n37 Rogan, The Arabs, 199.\n38 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 118\u201320. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 399\nstringent restrictions on them. The Nazis forbade them from marrying Gentiles, banned\nthem from the professions and from teaching, and organized boycotts of Jewish\nbusinesses. The Nazi campaign against German Jews\u2014and similar efforts in nearby\nstates\u2014profoundly frightened Central and Eastern European Jewish people and led\ntens-of-thousands to consider emigration. Their options were far-more limited than they\nhad been in the recent past, however. Rising anti-Semitism and widespread opposition\nto immigration during a time of unprecedented global mass unemployment led\ntraditional havens such as Canada and the United States\u2014the fabled Golden\nMedene\u2014to maintain strict limits on Jewish immigration. As a result, European Jews\nhad nowhere to go but Palestine.39\nThe ensuing flood of refugees remade the mandate\u2019s demographic makeup and\nfundamentally altered the balance between the Jewish and Arab communities. In\ncontrast to the average of 5,000-6,000 Jewish people who had arrived annually\nbetween 1929 and 1931, the mid-1930s saw tens of thousands of refugees pour into the\nterritory each year. 30,000 immigrated in 1933, 42,000 more in 1934, 62,000 in 1935,\nand 30,000 in 1936. All told, this new wave of immigration\u2014by far the largest yet\u2014more\nthan doubled the Jewish population of the mandate, increasing it from 164,000 in 1930\nto 370,000 in 1936 and raising the Jewish share of Palestine\u2019s population from 18\npercent in 1930 to 27 percent in 1935. Predictably, the surge in the mandate\u2019s Jewish\npopulation created enormous alarm among the Arabs and fed a sharp rise in fears that\nthe Zionists would, with British help, displace them from Palestine.40\nLand purchases in the 1930s further contributed to Palestinian discontent. The\nZionists acquired fewer total acres over the course of that decade than they had in the\n1920s, but the land that they purchased in the 1930s tended to be cultivated rather than\nfallow and thus had a greater impact on the fellahin. Some Arabs tried to organize\nboycotts and extract pledges from landowners to prevent further property transfers.\nVigorous efforts to enforce such agreements failed in the face of surging land values,\nhowever. Indeed, with prices quadrupling between 1929 and 1935, even those deeply\nopposed to Zionism could not resist the temptation to make a windfall profit. As the\nGerman consul noted, \u201cArab nationalists \u2018in daylight were crying out against Jewish\nimmigration and in the darkness of night were selling land to the Jews.\u2019\u201d Double dealing\nof this kind harmed the interests of the peasants, but, perhaps more importantly, it also\npowerfully eroded Palestinian solidarity. Creating an atmosphere of suspicion, it would\nhelp to sow sharp divisions along lines of class\u2014ones that would hamstring Arab efforts\nto oppose the British and the Zionists for the duration of the mandate.41\n39 Ian Kershaw, To Hell and Back: Europe 1914-1949 (New York: Penguin Books,\n2015), 207\u201316.\n40 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 8\u20139; Rogan, The Arabs, 201.\n41 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 122\u201323. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 400\nThe Great Arab Revolt, 1936\nBy the mid 1930s, land sales and the surge in immigration had left the mandate\non a knife\u2019s edge. With Jewish refugees pouring into Palestine in unprecedented\nnumbers and rumors of impending displacement rife, Arab anger and resentment finally\nboiled over. The result was the outbreak of the Great Arab Revolt in the spring of 1936:\na mandate-wide rebellion against Zionism, British rule, and, to a lesser extent, the\npolitically dominant Arab notables. Begun with high hopes and great determination, the\nrebellion was, for a time, a serious challenge to the Zionists and a huge financial drain\non London. Ultimately, however, it failed to achieve its goal of compelling Britain to end\nits support for Zionism; as important, it left the Palestinians too weak, divided, and\ndemoralized to thereafter mount an effective resistance to Zionism.\nRevolt and General Strike, April-September 1936\nThe revolt began in early 1936. In April, a band of Palestinian militants murdered\ntwo Jewish men and wounded a third at a nighttime roadblock. The incident set off a\nspiral of violence throughout the mandate. Loosely organized groups of urban Arabs\nthrew rocks at police officers while their rural counterparts harassed British soldiers and\nengaged in acts of sabotage. The situation quickly escalated. In short order,\nincreasingly sophisticated Arab militia bands were sniping at imperial troops, ambushing\npatrols, laying mines, sabotaging railways, and attacking isolated Jewish settlements.\nMeanwhile, a loosely connected network of nationalist groups moved to support the\ninsurgency by organizing an economic boycott patterned after the recent Syrian General\nStrike. Designed to stop the flow of tax revenue that underwrote British control of the\nmandate, it rapidly attracted widespread support within the Palestinian community. By\nthe summer of 1936, as a result, Britain found itself in a difficult spot\u2014desperately trying\nto suppress a full-scale insurrection and to overcome a mandate-wide strike at the very\nmoment that its limited fiscal and military resources were already stretched thin by the\nincreasingly aggressive actions of fascist Germany and Italy.42\nImmigration and land purchases established the conditions for the revolt and the\nstrike, but what accounted for its timing? Two factors stand out. The first was\ngeostrategic. Britain\u2019s failure to contest Benito Mussolini\u2019s (r. 1922-1945) invasion of\nEthiopia in 1935 and its unwillingness to act when Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland in\nMarch 1936 suggested to Arab leaders that London lacked the fortitude to deal with a\ncostly insurrection and would quickly capitulate in the face of continued pressure so\nnear to the Suez Canal. The second reason was economic in nature. The sudden\ncollapse of the boom that the mandate had enjoyed between 1932 and 1935 left\nthousands of embittered Arabs confronting the prospects of unemployment\u2014some\nbecause their Jewish employers had responded to the downturn with a \u201c\u2018Hebrew labor\u2019\u201d\npolicy that involved replacing Palestinian workers with recent immigrants from Europe.\nBy early 1936, as a result, the mandate was brimming with young, resentful Arab men\n42 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n231\u201337. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 401\nwho, having little to lose, were only too willing to take up arms against the British or to\nenforce the economic boycott.43\nThe rebellion caught the Palestinian notables flat footed. Lulled into complacency\nby their dependence on the British for their salaries and patronage powers, the leading\nPalestinians in the al-Husayni and Nashashibi factions had quietly acquiesced to\ncontinued immigration and British rule during the 1920s and early 1930s and were thus\non the sidelines when the younger, more-radical nationalists launched the insurgency in\nApril 1936. Once the revolt began, however, the notables moved quickly to assume\ncontrol. On April 25, the factions agreed to put down their differences and formed the\nArab Higher Committee (AHC) to coordinate the economic resistance. The grand mufti\nserved as its chairperson. Its first act was to announce that the boycott, thereafter\nknown as the Arab General Strike, would continue until the British agreed to meet three\ndemands: the immediate cessation of immigration, a blanket ban on Jewish land\npurchases, and the establishment of a representative government for the mandate.\nPublicly, the AHC focused exclusively on coordinating the economic resistance and\ndenied that it had any connection to the militants; privately, however, it moved to\nsupport the insurgents and sought with mixed success to assume control of the\nrebellion.44\nLikewise caught off guard, the British initially responded as the Palestinians had\nanticipated. Desperate to avoid a costly anti-insurgency campaign, mandate authorities\npursued a passive appeasement policy that included new limits on immigration in hopes\nthat such an approach would undercut support for the rebellion. By the end of the\nsummer, however, London reluctantly came to conclude that conciliation was not\nworking and shifted to a more aggressive response. It deployed a division of troops to\nPalestine, imposed martial law, and instituted a system of collective punishment\nwherein British soldiers demolished houses and made mass arrests in Palestinian\nvillages suspected of supporting the revolt. The new tactics were ugly, but they were\nalso effective. By mid-autumn, it had become abundantly clear that the rebellion had\nfailed.45\nThe strike proved similarly unsuccessful. Despite imposing depression conditions\non the mandate\u2019s Arab population, it had been unable to compel the British to negotiate.\nWhy had the economic protest failed? More pertinently, why had it been unable to\nmatch the success of the concurrent Syrian General Strike? The explanation lies in the\npeculiar, bifurcated nature of Palestine\u2019s economy. Over the course of the prior two\ndecades, rapid Zionist commercial, industrial, and agricultural development had\nproduced a largely self-contained Jewish economic sector in the mandate. Far-more\nadvanced than the Palestinian economy, it accounted for the bulk of the taxes that the\n43 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 127\u201329.\n44 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n232\u201333; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920,\n129\u201333.\n45 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 130\u201334. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 402\nBritish collected. As a result, though the strike had all-but shut down the Palestinian\nsector of the economy, it had failed to depress tax receipts enough to force the British to\nthe table.46\nFaced with the failure of the insurgency and the prospect of impoverishment and\neven famine in the Palestinian community, the AHC began to consider bringing the\nuprising to a close. Ending the rebellion and the strike would prove tricky, however.\nComplicating the AHC\u2019s efforts to secure a negotiated settlement, the guerrilla\ncommanders in the field made clear that they would accept nothing less than a total\nvictory. As a result, the Arab Higher Committee would need to find\u2014or somehow\ngenerate\u2014political cover if it wished to push forward with a negotiated end to the strike\nand the revolt. It managed to do so in the fall of 1936 with the help of the emir of\nTransjordan and the kings of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Yemen. At the AHC\u2019s indirect\nbehest, those rulers issued statements appealing for an immediate end both to the\nstrike and the revolt. The gambit worked. In conjunction with London\u2019s pledge to send a\ncommittee to assess the situation in Palestine, their entreaties were sufficient to give the\nAHC the pretext it needed to bring the strike and the rebellion to an end in October.\nThere was a cost, however. In inviting the monarchs to assume a direct role in their\naffairs, the Palestinians had set in motion a process that would soon lead to the Arab\nheads of state taking charge of their cause\u2014a change in leadership that would, as we\nshall see, have baleful consequences for them.47\nThe Peel Commission Report, 1937\nNamed for its chair, Lord William Peel (1867-1937), the commission that London\nhad promised to send to the mandate arrived in November 1936. Its visit would prove to\nbe a crucial turning point for Palestine\u2014one that would fundamentally alter the terms of\nthe debate over the disposition of the mandate. The Zionists and Palestinians\napproached the commission very differently. Yishuv leaders viewed it as a golden\nopportunity to make their case and seized the opportunity to do so. Presenting Zionism\nas a moderate movement that was more-than willing to compromise, Weizmann, Ben\nGurion, and others promoted a plan before the commission that called for a partition of\nthe territory into separate Jewish and Arab states as a way to end intercommunal\nviolence. The Palestinians, in contrast, once again fumbled the opportunity to present\ntheir position. While the Zionist leadership was outwardly solicitous and claimed to be\neager to compromise, the AHC instead assumed a defiant attitude and initially refused\nto meet with the commission unless London first imposed an outright ban on further\nimmigration. Indeed, it was only just before the commission returned to Britain that\n46 Provence, The Last Ottoman Generation and the Making of the Modern Middle East,\n231, 237.\n47 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 111; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab\nConflict, 1881-1920, 134\u201335. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 403\noutside pressure finally succeeded in compelling the Palestinians to present their\ncase.48\nReleased in July 1937, the Peel Commission Report outlined a dramatic new\napproach to the mandate that would set the stage for its division in 1948. Admitting\nopenly for the first time that \u201can irrepressible conflict has arisen between two national\ncommunities\u201d and that a unitary state was doomed to failure, it proposed partitioning the\nmandate between the Jewish and Palestinian peoples. According to its plan, the\nZionists would establish a small state in territory that stretched northward from Tel Aviv\nto the Lebanese border and then east to the Sea of Galilee, and Britain would retain\ncontrol of Jerusalem and a corridor of land connecting it to the coast. The remaining\nterritory, about eighty percent of the mandate, would be appended to Transjordan. It\nseemed like a Solomonic solution: a wise division of the mandate that would satisfy both\nparties\u2019 interests. Resolving the clash between rival nationalist movements through\npartition raised a new issue, however: what was to happen to the Arabs who lived in\nthe area assigned to the Jewish state and to the Zionists who resided in the territory\nallotted to the Palestinians? The Peel commission proposed to solve this issue through\n\u201c\u2018population transfers\u2019\u201d similar to the exchange of people that occurred between Greece\nand Turkey in the Treaty of Lausanne. In other words, a process of ethnic cleansing\nwould take place in which Arabs would relocate from the Zionist state, and Jewish\npeople would move out of the territory assigned to the Palestinians.49\nAt first blush, the plan to forcibly move people to create ethnically homogenous\nstates appeared to be even handed. As a result of the population transfers, both the\nJewish state and the Arab one would have uniform populations and would thus be free\nof ethnic tension. Upon closer inspection however, the commission\u2019s proposal revealed\nitself to be entirely one sided. While the plan called for a mere 1,250 Jewish people to\nrelocate from the territory assigned to the Arabs, it required no fewer than 225,000\nPalestinians to depart from the new Zionist state\u2014a forced transfer that the Arabs\ncondemned as unacceptable. The Peel Commission\u2019s proposed population relocation\nwas a critical component of the partition plan, however. Without it, the Jewish state\nwould retain an Arab minority that was nearly as large as its Jewish population\u2014thus\nrendering moot the entire point of Zionism.50\nThe Zionist movement reacted with mixed emotions to the specifics of the\npartition plan but ultimately came to endorse the idea. Unsurprisingly, Jabotinsky and\nthe revisionists outright rejected the commission\u2019s recommendations on the grounds\nthat they did not immediately grant the Zionists the entirety of both Palestine and\nTransjordan. In contrast, though they were disappointed that the plan allotted the\nJewish state a mere 5,000 square kilometers of territory\u2014a bit larger than six times the\nsize of New York City\u2014prominent Labor Zionists like Weizmann, Ben Gurion, and\nMoshe Sharett (1894-1965) were enthusiastic about the proposal and lobbied\n48 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 138.\n49 Quotes from Rogan, The Arabs, 204\u20135.\n50 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 138\u201339. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 404\naggressively for its acceptance. They articulated two arguments in its favor. First, they\ncontended that sovereignty would mean the lifting of immigration limits and a\nconcomitant rapid increase in the Jewish state\u2019s population. Second, and more\nimportantly, they maintained that a state along the lines that the Peel Commission had\noutlined would not be Zionism\u2019s end product but would instead constitute a critical\nopening bid that its people could enlarge through negotiation or conquest. As Ben\nGurion privately wrote, \u201c\u2018I am certain [that] we will be able to settle in all the other parts\nof the country, whether through agreement with our Arab neighbours or in another\nway.\u2019\u201d These arguments proved persuasive. Accordingly, while the Twentieth Zionist\nCongress that met in Zurich in August 1937 rejected the specific borders that the Peel\nCommission had drawn up, it voted in favor of partition.51\nResumption, 1937-1939\nThe Palestinians, in contrast, reacted angrily to the report. Viewing the partition\nplan as unjust, they railed against the commission\u2019s proposal to expel hundreds-of-\nthousands of Arabs from Galilee and expressed their fear that the creation of a Jewish\nstate\u2014however small\u2014would result in a dramatic increase in immigration that would\nlead, inevitably, to the Zionist state\u2019s expansion. More importantly, they also responded\nto the report by resuming the revolt. Beginning in the fall of 1937, Palestinian irregulars\nwere once again harassing patrols, blowing up railroad tracks and viaducts, sniping at\nBritish soldiers, cutting telephone and telegraph wires, attacking Zionist settlements,\nand assassinating officials and suspected collaborators. For a time, they enjoyed\nsubstantial success. Indeed, by the summer of 1938, rebel forces controlled large\nswaths of rural Palestine and even several Arab towns.52\nBritain reacted aggressively to the renewed violence. Returning to the approach\nthat had brought the first phase of the rebellion to a conclusion, it deployed a rising tide\nof reinforcements to the mandate. By 1939, as a result, the British army in Palestine\nnumbered more than 100,000 troops\u2014equivalent to one quarter of the population of\nPalestinian men. Those soldiers employed brutal counterinsurgency tactics to suppress\nthe rebellion. They vigorously enforced martial law, put Arab hostages on the fronts of\ntrains and vehicles to discourage mine laying, blew up houses that belonged to rebels\nor their family members, arrested thousands without bringing them to trial, and\nsummarily executed Palestinians suspected of engaging in insurrection.53\nThis time, moreover, the British did not limit themselves to a military response.\nInstead, using the assassination of a British official in September 1937 as a pretext, the\nmandate government went after the Palestinians\u2019 political leadership by declaring the\nAHC illegal and by arresting and deporting many of its members to the Seychelles\n51 Quote from Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 20\u201323; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the\nZionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 139.\n52 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 144\u201345.\n53 Rashid Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine: A History of Settler\nColonialism and Resistance, 1917\u20132017 (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2020), 44\u201345. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 405\nIslands. The British executed their dragnet with characteristic skill; nonetheless, they\nfailed to apprehend their main target: the increasingly militant grand mufti. Slipping out\nof Palestine at night by boat, he joined a handful of other prominent Palestinians in\nLebanon, where, with little success, he tried to direct the rebellion.54\nThe Zionists also responded forcefully to the renewed violence. This new policy\nmarked a dramatic shift away from the approach that they had adopted during the first\nphase of the revolt. Eager to cultivate a moderate, accommodating image on the world\nstage, the Yishuv had responded cautiously in 1936 and early 1937 to Arab attacks on\nJewish settlements. After a series of high-profile Palestinian terrorist incidents in\nOctober 1937, however, the Labor Zionists abandoned their earlier restraint and fully\nembraced Jabotinsky\u2019s Iron Wall strategy. Using arms and training that the British had\nprovided, the Haganah shifted from a strictly defensive strategy to \u201can \u2018aggressive\ndefense\u2019 doctrine\u201d that involved both frequent patrolling outside isolated settlements and\nretaliatory killings of Arab villagers. Irgun went much further. Beginning in November\n1937, it began responding to Palestinian attacks by bombing bus stations,\nmarketplaces, and commercial districts that Arabs frequented. These attacks were\ndeadly. One in Haifa in July 1938 killed thirty-nine Palestinians and wounded seventy\nmore, while another in Jaffa the following month killed twenty-four Arabs and injured\nthirty-nine. Thereafter, such violence\u2014executed by both Arabs and Zionists\u2014became\ncommonplace throughout the mandate.55\nThanks to the aggressive efforts of the British and the Zionists, the revolt finally\npetered out in 1939. It had been a bitter failure for the Arabs. By the time imperial forces\nhad brought the rebellion to heel, 5,000 Palestinians had died, 10,000 had been\nwounded, and thousands more were languishing in prison. Meanwhile, valuable\norchards had been levelled, crops had been torched or uprooted, and thousands of\nhomes had been demolished. Perhaps worst of all, the Palestinians had become\nhopelessly divided along lines of class and faction as the revolt dragged on. Indeed, by\nlate 1938, the rebellion had almost completely transformed from an anticolonial revolt\ninto an Arab civil war replete with firefights, assassinations, and terrorist attacks.56\nIt is nearly impossible to overstate the significance of the failure of the Great Arab\nRevolt to the outcome of the contest for Palestine. Put simply, it set the Zionists and the\nArabs on very different trajectories. For its part, the Yishuv emerged from the rebellion\nmuch stronger than it had been at the insurrection\u2019s start. Largely unaffected by the\nconflict, its dynamic economy had maintained its rapid expansion while immigration had\ncontinued to fuel a Jewish population boom. In addition, boosted by British weapons\nand training, the Yishuv\u2019s armed forces had taken a huge step in their transition from\nmilitia to conventional military. Finally, continuing their rapid development, Zionist\n54 Khalidi, 44\u201345.\n55 Segev, One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate, 426\u2013\n32; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 147\u2013\n48.\n56 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 46\u201347. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 406\npolitical bodies had matured to the point that the Yishuv now constituted, in Rashid\nKhalidi\u2019s words, nothing less than a \u201cpara-state.\u201d57\nFor the Arabs, on the other hand, the Great Arab Revolt had been an unmitigated\ndisaster. Having played for broke, they had come up empty. The failed rebellion had\ngrievously weakened the Arab community\u2019s economy, badly strained its social\ncohesion, and gutted its military capabilities. Politically, it had left the Palestinians\nhopelessly divided and had resulted in the death or exile of so many prominent figures\nthat it created a debilitating leadership vacuum that the incompetent and rash grand\nmufti filled. The failure of the rebellion had been so total, in fact, that it rendered the\nPalestinians incapable of organizing either an effective resistance during World War II\nor a response to the Zionists when the question of who would control the territory was\nfinally resolved in 1948. Thus, as Rashid Khalidi correctly notes, it was the revolt of\n1936-1939 and not the war of 1948\u2014a conflict that he considers to be no more than a\n\u201cpostlude\u201d\u2014that constituted the critical turning point in the contest for Palestine.58\nThe White Paper of 1939\nAstonishingly, in light of the defeat they had suffered, the Palestinians received\none last opportunity to recover their position. They got this chance thanks to the rapidly\nworsening international situation. By the late spring of 1939, global war seemed\ninevitable. Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia in violation of an earlier promise to\nrespect its borders, Italy had seized Albania, and Japan had begun casting covetous\nlooks at Britain\u2019s valuable colonies in Southeast Asia. With hopes for global peace\nrapidly fading, London suddenly came to perceive its support for Zionism as a huge\nliability. Not only had it sparked a costly rebellion in Palestine that continued to divert\nscarce troops desperately needed elsewhere, but it had also alienated Arabs throughout\nthe Middle East and thus threatened the empire\u2019s access to critical oil supplies and its\ncontrol of the vital Suez Canal. Accordingly, London undertook a sweeping reappraisal\nof its approach to Palestine. The result was the release of a new policy statement: the\nWhite Paper of 1939. The latest in a long string of important documents regarding\nPalestine, it signaled a fundamental change in London\u2019s approach to the mandate. It\nimposed severe restrictions on land sales, limited immigration to 15,000 Jewish people\nper year until 1944\u2014after which further immigration could only occur with Arab\nconsent\u2014and promised the establishment in ten years of a democratic, multiethnic\ngovernment in the mandate that would be structured \u201c\u2018in such a way as to ensure that\nthe essential interests of each community are safeguarded.\u2019\u201d59\nThe White Paper came as a tremendous shock to the Zionists. It constituted a\nrejection not only of the partition proposal articulated in the Peel Commission Report\nbut, far more importantly, of the Balfour Declaration itself: the legal bedrock on which\n57 Khalidi, 47\u201354.\n58 Quote from Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 123; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the\nZionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 122.\n59 Rogan, The Arabs, 206\u20137. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 407\nZionism rested. More immediately, it also threatened to severely restrict immigration at\na time when growing Nazi violence made leaving Europe an imperative for Jewish\npeople. The Labor Zionists consequently rejected its terms and responded by once\nmore mounting an aggressive public relations campaign aimed at pressuring London\ninto reverting to its earlier, pro-Zionist policy. This effort did bear some fruit, but, thanks\nto Britain\u2019s increasingly single-minded focus on war preparation, it ultimately proved\nunsuccessful in reversing London\u2019s new policy toward Palestine.60\nCharacteristically, the Irgun went much further than the Labor Zionists in\nexpressing dissatisfaction with the White Paper. Furious at what it considered to be\nLondon\u2019s abandonment of its earlier commitment to a Jewish home in Palestine, the\ngroup responded by initiating sabotage and terrorist operations against the British\naimed at forcing them from the mandate\u2014a campaign that Irgun only reluctantly ended\nwhen the outbreak of war in Europe compelled it to take sides. Importantly, the decision\nto leave London unmolested did not enjoy unanimous support in the organization. On\nthe contrary, a small number of Irgun members who remained Single-mindedly focused\non pushing the British out of Palestine split from Irgun after the war began to form an\neven-more extreme splinter group called Lehi, or the Stern Gang. Unyielding, it\ncontinued to launch terrorist attacks until British police killed its founder, Avraham Stern\n(1907-1942), in 1942.61\nThe terms of the White Paper were far more favorable to the Palestinians than\nany previous British policy had been. Indeed, its provisions might well have given them\na genuine shot at preventing both the establishment of a Jewish state in the mandate\nand their eventual displacement. Nonetheless, the AHC dismissed the new British policy\noutright. What explains this choice? Why did they reject the opportunity that the White\nPaper seemed to present? Publicly, they did so because it failed to implement an\nimmediate ban on immigration and because it pushed independence too far into the\nfuture. These were no doubt genuine concerns, but they did not represent the real\nreason that the Arabs rejected the White Paper. Instead, it was the Palestinians\u2019 old\nproblem, factionalism, that led them to renounce its terms. While many members of the\nAHC wanted to respond favorably to the new British policy, the unremitting hostility to\nthe White Paper of the few remaining rebel bands still in the field and, more importantly,\nthe strident opposition of the grand mufti tied the higher committee\u2019s hands. As a result,\nthe Palestinians turned down what British Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald\n(1901-1981) called a \u201c\u2018golden opportunity\u2019\u201d and refused to embrace the last chance\u2014\nadmittedly a slender one\u2014that they would have to rescue themselves.62\n60 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 158\u201359.\n61 Morris, 158\u201359.\n62 Robert Fisk, The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East (New\nYork: Vintage, 2005), 359; Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 114\u20131245. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 408\nWorld War II\nPicking Sides\nThe war that the British had feared finally came in September 1939. For the\nLabor Zionists who dominated the Yishuv\u2019s leadership, the start of the conflict posed a\ndifficult dilemma. On the one hand, there was no question that they would fight against\nHitler\u2019s brutal, anti-Semitic regime; on the other, they also bitterly opposed the White\nPaper of 1939 and did not want to take any action that might suggest acquiescence to\nits terms. How, then, could they help the British defeat the Nazi regime without\nsimultaneously accepting\u2014implicitly or explicitly\u2014the terms of the hated White Paper?\nDavid Ben Gurion provided a way of resolving this predicament when he proposed that\nthe Zionists adopt a bifurcated approach to the war and to Britain\u2019s new policy position.\n\u201c\u2018We shall fight the war against Hitler as if there were no White Paper,\u2019 he declared in\n1939, \u2018and we shall fight the White Paper as if there were no war.\u2019\u201d63\nBen Gurion\u2019s two-track approach of contesting both Hitler and the British defined\nthe mainstream Zionists\u2019 approach to the war. Most rank-and-file Zionists pursued the\nfirst track. Seeking to help defeat Hitler, they either enlisted in Allied armies or joined the\nBritish-trained Jewish Brigade that served in Italy in 1945. Focused on the second track,\nmeanwhile, leaders like Ben Gurion instead undertook a skillfully executed diplomatic\ncampaign that centered on winning Washington\u2019s support for Zionism. Central to that\neffort was a meeting they held with a group of prominent Jewish Americans in New York\nCity\u2019s Biltmore Hotel in May 1942 at which they drafted a new Zionist policy statement.\nKnown as the Biltmore Program, it formally replaced the movements\u2019 earlier\nendorsement of partition with a call for the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth\nthat would occupy the entire mandate.64\nBoth tracks paid enormous dividends for the Yishuv. The creation of the Jewish\nBrigade and the enlistment of Zionists in Allied armies provided the Haganah with a\ncadre of experienced combat veterans who would later turn raw recruits into effective\nsoldiers. Endorsed by both the Democratic and Republican parties in their election\nplatforms in 1944, meanwhile, the Biltmore Program helped to secure critical American\ndiplomatic support for the Zionist effort to overturn the White Paper.65\nThe Palestinian leadership proved unable to match the Zionists\u2019 deft approach to\nthe war. Divided and in some cases jailed, the members of the AHC failed to provide\nany effective leadership whatsoever during a period that would prove critical in settling\n63 James L.

Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 409\nthe struggle for the mandate. Making matters worse for the Palestinians were the high-\nprofile statements of the exiled grand mufti. Living in Baghdad during the first two years\nof the conflict, he made no effort to hide his fervent hope that Germany would win the\nwar and, in the process, destroy the British Empire in the Middle East. He did not limit\nhimself to anti-British diatribes, moreover. Instead, putting words into action, he helped\nto orchestrate Iraqi Prime Minister Rashid Ali\u2019s (1892-1965) ill-fated, pro-Axis coup in\n1941, after which he spent the remainder of the war in Germany making propaganda\nbroadcasts and recruiting Muslim POWs for service in Axis armies. These actions may\nhave won al-Husayni accolades among anti-imperialists in the Arab world, but they also\ndamaged the Palestinians\u2019 reputation and thereby weakened their case in the court of\ninternational public opinion\u2014a venue that would prove to be of vital importance in the\ncritical years immediately following the war.66\nThe Holocaust\nWhile al-Husayni was striving to recruit Muslims, his hosts and their many\ncollaborators were profoundly if indirectly shaping Palestine\u2019s future through the\nHolocaust: the German-led effort to completely eradicate Europe\u2019s Jewish community.\nResulting in the systematic murder of 5,600,000 to 6,900,000 Jewish people, it came\nperilously close to achieving its goal before the Allied conquest of Poland and Germany\nfinally closed the death camps in 1945. Also known as the Shoah, the Holocaust\npowerfully influenced the contest for control of Palestine in three ways. First, it won\nenormous public sympathy for Zionism throughout Western Europe and especially in\nthe pivotally important United States. Believing that the Holocaust amounted to a\ncollective, civilizational moral failing, many Europeans and Americans came to conclude\nthat helping the Jewish people establish a state in Palestine was the only way that the\nWest could atone for its culpability in the Holocaust. Second, reinforcing the conviction\nthat the Jewish people could never be truly secure until they had their own state, the\nShoah hardened the Zionists\u2019 resolve and left them increasingly unwilling to\ncompromise. Finally, the Holocaust created a huge population of Jewish refugees\nfollowing the war who were, unsurprisingly, disinclined to live among people who had so\nrecently collaborated in the Nazi effort to kill them. Many of them wished to follow the\nexample of earlier generations and immigrate to the United States; however, a large\nproportion preferred the security that life in a Jewish state seemed to offer and\ndemanded that they be permitted to move immediately to Palestine.67\nPartition\nThe refugees and their aspiration to relocate to the mandate would play a central\nrole in the Zionists\u2019 postwar strategy. With the conclusion of the fighting in Europe in\nMay 1945, the leadership of the Yishuv believed that it was on the cusp of finally\n66 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 165\u201367.\n67 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 10\u201311; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 29; Douglas Little,\nAmerican Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945, Third Edition\n(Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), 77, 87. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 410\nachieving the Zionist dream of a Jewish state. To secure it, they planned to first bring\nhundreds of thousands of refugees to Palestine after which they would declare the\nestablishment of a Jewish state encompassing the entire mandate. Britain stood in the\nway of that dream, however. Eager to court the newly independent Arab states so as to\nretain its dominant position in the region, London continued to adhere to the more even-\nhanded policy toward Palestine that it had adopted with the White Paper of 1939. In\nkeeping with this approach, it made clear that it opposed the establishment of a Jewish\nstate, and it continued to enforce strict limits on immigration. London\u2019s approach thus\nput it on a collision course with the Labor Zionists and their plan to flood the mandate\nwith immigrants and quickly declare a Jewish state. In response, in the summer of 1945,\nBen Gurion and the Labor Zionists abandoned the cautious, bifurcated strategy that had\nguided their movement since the outbreak of World War II in favor of a militant approach\naimed at forcing London to quit Palestine as a prelude to the establishment of a Jewish\nstate.68\nThe Zionist Insurgency\nThe Haganah was late to the party, however. Furious about London\u2019s refusal to\nease immigration limits in response to the Holocaust, Irgun and Lehi had long since\nresumed their terror campaign against the British. Leadership changes in both\norganizations precipitated this new approach. Yitzhak Shamir (1915-2012), who would\nlater serve as prime minister, revived the Stern Gang\u2019s dormant terror campaign against\nthe British soon after he took charge of the group in 1943. In similar fashion, the Polish-\nJewish immigrant Menachem Begin (1913-1992)\u2014also a future prime minister\u2014\nrestarted the Irgun insurgency against the British just days after he assumed control of\nthe group in 1944. Focusing their efforts on weakening Britain\u2019s civil authority, both\norganizations soon made their presence felt. Beginning in 1944, the Irgun carried out a\nspectacular string of bombings against government offices and police stations. Lehi, in\ncontrast, focused on assassinations\u2014including the murder of the British High\nCommissioner to the Middle East, Lord Moyne (1880-1944), whom they targeted for his\nrole in enforcing the blockade on immigration to Palestine.69\nThe Haganah formally if secretly joined the insurgency in October 1945 when it\nentered into an alliance with Lehi and the Irgun called the Hebrew Rebellion Movement.\nIt called for the Haganah to complement the revisionist groups\u2019 campaign of bombings\nand assassinations by engaging in non-lethal acts of sabotage. Accordingly, while Lehi\nand Irgun forces pressed on with their terrorist attacks, Haganah units in late 1945 freed\nimmigrants from detention centers, bombed coast-guard installations in retaliation for\nthe seizure of ships carrying refugees, and sabotaged rail lines.70\n68 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 186\u201387; Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 173\u201374.\n69 Rogan, The Arabs, 247\u201349.\n70 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 123. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 411\nBritain\u2019s aggressive reaction to the stepped-up insurgency heightened the\nstandoff between London and the Zionists. The British initially responded to the rise in\nviolence by deploying 100,000 soldiers to the mandate in early 1946. Seeking to\npressure the Yishuv leadership into standing down, they followed by detaining hundreds\nof prominent Zionists including four members of the Jewish Agency at the end of June.\nThis last move rankled Irgun\u2019s leadership. Committed to responding forcefully to any\nslight, it retaliated a few weeks later by detonating a huge bomb in the seat of the\nmandate government: the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. The resulting explosion was\nmassive. Collapsing an entire wing of the hotel, it killed ninety-one people and wounded\nanother one hundred.71\nImmigration and Diplomacy\nThe bombing was too much for the Labor Zionists. While the Irgun and Lehi\npressed on with their terror attacks, the mainstream Zionists instead abandoned their\nsabotage campaign in favor of a return to a diplomatic approach. Their new strategy\nhad two components. The first involved using the plight of Jewish Holocaust survivors\nlanguishing in camps in Europe to turn American public opinion against British policy in\nPalestine. To do so, the Zionists arranged for thousands of Holocaust survivors to travel\nto the mandate aboard chartered steamers\u2014thereby compelling Britain either to permit\nthem to disembark or to divert thousands of them to internment camps on the island of\nCyprus. The second centered on solidifying Zionism\u2019s standing in the United States by\npresenting the movement as a moderate one. In support of that effort, the Labor\nZionists abandoned the Biltmore Program\u2019s demand for a Jewish state in the entirety of\nthe mandate and instead reembraced the more politically palatable idea of partition.72\nThe decision to pursue a diplomatic strategy soon bore fruit. By the middle of\n1946, the Labor Zionists\u2019 illegal-immigration campaign had made the predicament of\nHolocaust survivors suffering in refugee camps a major cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the US and\nhad turned American public opinion sharply against Great Britain. Among those who\nempathized with the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust was the president of the United\nStates, Harry Truman (r. 1945-1953). Inclined for his whole life to root for the underdog,\nTruman was genuinely moved by the plight of the refugees and increasingly sought a\nfavorable resolution of their situation. Empathy for the Jewish people was important in\nshaping Truman\u2019s position with regard to Palestine, but practical motives also played a\ncritical role in spurring him to challenge Britain\u2019s approach to the mandate. A shrewd\npolitician who had cut his teeth working for the Prendergast political machine in Kansas\nCity, he keenly grasped the electoral benefits that would accrue to the Democratic Party\nin the 1946 elections in states like Illinois and New York that had substantial Jewish\npopulations if he expressed his support for Zionist goals. \u201c\u2018I have to answer to hundreds\nof thousands who are anxious for the success of Zionism,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he told an aide. \u201c\u2018I do not\nhave hundreds of thousands of Arabs in my constituents.\u2019\u201d Truman was thus more-than\n71 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 176\u201379.\n72 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 25\u201328; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab\nConflict, 1881-1920, 176. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 412\nreceptive to the Zionists\u2019 blandishments\u2014particularly after they dropped their demand\nfor the entire mandate. Accordingly, he announced on Yom Kippur in October 1946 that\nhe favored both the immediate admission of 100,000 Holocaust survivors into Palestine\nand the partition of the mandate into Jewish and Palestinian states.73\nTruman\u2019s announcement that he supported the establishment of a Jewish state\nwas the final straw for the British in Palestine. Demoralized by the Irgun and Stern\nGang\u2019s ongoing terror campaign and now at odds with Washington, London began to\ngive serious consideration to abandoning what had become a thankless and expensive\ncommitment. Accordingly, after making one last futile effort to get the\nZionists and Arabs to agree to a compromise solution, the British\ngovernment announced in February 1947 that it was leaving Palestine the\nfollowing year and dumped the seemingly insoluble problem onto the two-\nyear-old United Nations (UN).74\nUNSCOP\nNow tasked with resolving the Palestine crisis, the UN General Assembly\nresponded by sending yet another fact-finding mission to the mandate. Called the\nUnited Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP), it spent five weeks touring\nthe mandate and conducting interviews in order to determine a path forward that was\nacceptable to all parties. Enjoying the considerable advantage of having bugged the\ncommittee\u2019s meeting rooms, the Zionists went to great lengths to make their case for\npartition. They presented their movement as moderate, compromising, and modern, and\nthey worked diligently to ingratiate themselves with the UNSCOP representatives. They\neven went so far as to arrange for committee members to meet with Jewish settlers who\nspoke their native language. In contrast, in what one British official described as\n\u201c\u2018exceedingly inept\u2019 diplomacy,\u201d the recently reconstituted AHC refused to present its\ncase and instead opted to boycott the committee entirely. It is true that officials from the\nindependent Arab countries did present an Arab plan to the UNSCOP representatives;\nhowever, their proposal for a single, Palestinian-dominated state in which Jewish people\nwould enjoy no political rights contrasted unfavorably with the Zionists\u2019 seeming\nreasonableness.75\nThe committee released its report in September 1947. By an eight-to-three vote,\nit recommended that the UN partition the mandate into Palestinian and Zionist states\nbound together\u2014as a function of practical necessity\u2014in an economic union.

Jerusalem\nwould join neither state. Instead, owing to its importance to the three Abrahamic faiths, it\nwould become a UN-administered international trusteeship.76\nBritain was delighted with the report. Palestine had become a booby prize for\nLondon\u2014an expensive obligation that sapped the army\u2019s morale and diverted resources\ndesperately needed to rebuild the British economy following World War II. In addition,\nthe detention of Jewish refugees seeking to flee persecution in Europe for the relative\nsafety of the mandate had done serious damage to Britain\u2019s international reputation.\nAccordingly, London wasted no time in using the report\u2019s publication to announce that it\nwas withdrawing from the mandate effective May 14, 1948.77\nCritics were quick to point out the many serious flaws and inequities inherent in\nthe UNSCOP plan. The Arab League, which the Arab states had established in 1945 to\ncoordinate their foreign policies, complained that while Zionists accounted for only one-\nthird of the population in Palestine, the report had assigned them 56 percent of the\nmandate including much of the best farmland. They also noted that while the share of\nthe territory allocated to the Palestinians possessed negligible numbers of Jewish\npeople, the portion granted to the Zionist state contained 407,000 Arabs. Other\nobservers focused on the Rube Goldberg-esque division of each state into three\nsegments that enjoyed only tangential connections with each other. As they noted, the\ntwo crossing points linking the sections of the Jewish state would be coincident with\nthose connecting the Palestinian territories\u2014an arrangement that all-but guaranteed\nfriction. More generally, they pointed out that the division of the proposed states into\nmultiple segments gave each of them long, nearly undefendable borders, and left them,\nin one British academic\u2019s words, \u201c\u2018entwined in an inimical embrace like two fighting\nserpents.\u2019\u201d In part because of these criticisms, the formal partition proposal, Resolution\n181, faced an uphill fight as it headed toward a vote in the UN General Assembly.78\nResolution 181, November 29, 1947\nIndeed, drawing strength from these criticisms, two challenges\u2014one practical,\nthe other political\u2014loomed increasingly large as the vote neared. First, passage\nrequired the support of a daunting two-thirds of the UN\u2019s member states, meaning that\nthe resolution would fail if a comparatively small number of states found the critiques of\nthe resolution sufficiently compelling to join the UN\u2019s six Arab members in opposing it.\nMore importantly, the resolution confronted substantial opposition among officials in the\nUS Departments of State and Defense and in the Central Intelligence Agency who\nwarned that support for Zionism could imperil America\u2019s increasingly important\n76 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 124.\n77 Gelvin, 124.\n78 Ussama Makdisi, Faith Misplaced: The Broken Promise of U.S.-Arab Relations: 1820-\n2001 (New York: PublicAffairs, 2010), 192\u201393; Quote from Louis, The British Empire in\nthe Middle East, 1945-1951, 369. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 414\neconomic interests in the Middle East and might even create an opening in the Arab\nworld that Moscow could exploit. Highly influential in shaping American foreign policy,\nthose officials could potentially turn the Truman administration against Resolution 181\u2014\na turn of events that would sway many of Washington\u2019s allies to vote against the\npartition plan and thus doom it to failure.79\nFortunately for the Zionists, President Truman was unreceptive to the American\nforeign-policy establishment\u2019s objections. With his eyes firmly locked on the upcoming\n1948 presidential election, he rejected its recommendations. Instead, he not only\ninstructed the US ambassador to the UN to vote in favor of partition but also\naggressively strong-armed wavering states into supporting the resolution. His efforts\nworked. Thanks to his pressure tactics, Resolution 181 narrowly passed on November\n29, 1947, with thirty-three states in favor\u2014including both the US and the USSR\u2014\nthirteen opposed, and ten abstaining.80\nUnsurprisingly, the Jewish and Arab communities in the mandate responded very\ndifferently to the resolution\u2019s passage. To the Palestinians, the vote marked yet another\ndemoralizing injustice imposed by imperialist Westerners\u2014one that called on them to\ncede the land of their ancestors to a foreign invader. To the Zionists, in contrast, the\npassage of Resolution 181 was a moment of triumph. At long last, their dream of a\nJewish state appeared to be at hand.81\nZionist confidence was apt, for the Yishuv was well-prepared for the\nindependence that Resolution 181 appeared to have secured. Politically, it had strong\nparties, a sense of unity, and a sophisticated parastate replete with a strong connection\nto its people and a suite of sophisticated and well-run ministries. Indeed, as the events\nof 1948 would show, its well-developed administrative structure needed only a name\nchange and international recognition to become a modern state. The effort to establish\na powerful army had been equally successful. While the Haganah may have suffered\nfrom a shortage of heavy weapons, it was nonetheless well-position to defend the\nYishuv. It fielded 35,000 soldiers including many battle-hardened veterans of World\nWar II, and it maintained factories capable of producing mortars, small arms, and\nammunition. Perhaps most importantly, it possessed a highly capable general staff that\nwas able to coordinate complex operations and to provide logistical support for units in\nthe field.82\nThe contrast with the Palestinians could hardly have been starker. Militarily, the\nArabs\u2019 modest militia forces possessed only a handful of modern weapons and had no\n79 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 124\u201325.\n80 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 198.\n81 Hugh Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game: The CIA\u2019s Secret Arabists and the Shaping of\nthe Modern Middle East (New York: Basic Books, 2013), 56\u201363; Smith, Palestine and\nthe Arab-Israeli Conflict, 198.\n82 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 200; Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 188.

Worse, the Palestinians did not\nmerely lack a coordinating body comparable to the Haganah\u2019s general staff but in fact\nenjoyed no central direction of their military forces whatsoever. Politically, the AHC did\nnot function like a parastate along the lines of the Yishuv\u2019s government. Instead, it was\nan organization largely focused on infighting and factional maneuvering\u2014one that\nlacked functionally defined ministries and that was incapable of offering the sort of\neffective leadership and oversight that are the hallmarks of modern states.83\nEven when the AHC made wise decisions, its endemic internal dissension\nensured poor outcomes. In 1946, for example, it established the Arab Office to serve as\na quasi-foreign ministry. Staffed with highly educated and professional people, it\nshowed great promise and appeared poised to give the Palestinians an effective\ninternational presence for the first time. Unfortunately for the mandate\u2019s Arab\npopulation, however, it soon fell victim to factionalism\u2014in this case, the grand mufti\u2019s\ninsistence that he personally control all of the Palestinians\u2019 quasi-governmental\ninstitutions. As a result, by mid 1947\u2014a peculiarly fateful moment in the contest for\nPalestine\u2014the Arab Office had been weakened to the point that it was no longer able to\nprovide the effective international representation that the Palestinians so desperately\nneeded.84\nThe Palestinians\u2019 abject lack of preparedness in 1947 had multiple sources but\nwas primarily a legacy of the events of the interwar period and the manifestly unequal\nnature of the mandate. From the start, the \u201ciron cage\u201d that London had imposed on\nthem in the early 1920s had prevented the Palestinians from establishing the\nfoundations of an effective government or from gaining the international legitimacy that\nthe mandate charter had accorded the Zionists. Britain\u2019s defeat of the Great Arab Revolt\nin the 1930s had been even more damaging. It left the Palestinians bitterly divided and\ndesperately short of the experienced troops, arms, and capable military commanders\nthat they would need to counter the Zionists in 1948. As a result, as the moment of\nreckoning approached, the Palestinians found themselves without either effective\ngoverning institutions or a capable military\u2014deficits that would leave them thoroughly\noutmatched by the Zionists.85\nThe First Arab-Israeli War, 1947-1949\nThe final contest to determine whether the Zionists or the Palestinians would\ndominate the territory began the day after the UN vote and continued until January\n1949. It had two phases. The first was an unofficial civil war between the Zionists and\nPalestinians that occurred between November 1947 and May 1948. The second, was a\nconventional conflict between the newly declared Zionist state of Israel and the\nmilitaries of five Arab states.\n83 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 62\u201368.\n84 Khalidi, 62\u201368.\n85 Khalidi, 62\u201370. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 416\nCivil War, November 30, 1947-May 14, 1948\nPhysical geography and Zionist strategic choices gave the Palestinians the upper\nhand during the early part of the civil war. Focused at that time on reorganizing the\nHaganah into a conventional military force, the Zionists initially adopted a defensive\nstrategy that centered on securing population centers and on keeping isolated\nsettlements and the 100,000 Jewish people who lived in West Jerusalem supplied. This\nstrategy would pay significant benefits in the long run, but, in the immediate term, it\nplayed to the Arabs\u2019 strength. With most Haganah units tied down either defending\nscattered settlements or undergoing reorganization, Palestinian forces\u2014joined in\nJanuary 1948 by Fawzi al-Qawuqji\u2019s (1890-1977) Arab League-sponsored Arab\nLiberation Army (ALA)\u2014were able to exploit their well-positioned villages to achieve a\nnumber of local victories. Launching hit-and-run attacks, they interdicted the roads on\nwhich Zionist supply trucks traveled and succeeded in preventing Haganah convoys\nfrom bringing supplies to the increasingly desperate Jewish population of West\nJerusalem. Even more concerning for Zionist leaders like Ben Gurion, the Haganah\u2019s\nlack of tangible military success also created a dangerous diplomatic environment for\nthe Zionists. Most notably, in an effort to end the violence, the US State Department\nbegan working on a new proposal that called for shelving the partition plan in favor of a\nUN trusteeship over the entire mandate.86\nBy March, as a result, the Yishuv\u2019s leaders had grown increasingly desperate. As\nthey well understood, their hopes of establishing a Jewish state required not only that\nthey promptly resupply Jewish West Jerusalem but also that they secure a quick military\nvictory that could stave off the trusteeship proposal. Accordingly, they moved to\nabandon the defensive orientation they had adopted at the start of the civil war in favor\nof a mandate-wide conventional offensive called Plan Dalet slated to begin in early\nApril. Plan Dalet was a bold and ambitious operation designed to create an enlarged\nand contiguous Zionist state. It called for the now-fully reformed Haganah to secure\nlines of communication to outlying settlements and Jerusalem before seizing control of\nthose Palestinian towns and villages that lay within the territory that the UN had\nassigned to the Zionists. Once those areas had been secured, the Haganah would\nmount an offensive aimed at knitting the three Jewish territories into a unified whole by\ntaking control of land that Resolution 181 had allocated to the Arabs. Importantly, it\nauthorized field commanders to destroy hostile Palestinian villages.87\nPlan Dalet was an enormous success right from the start. While the Palestinians\u2019\ndecentralized command structure and hit-and-run attacks had been well-geared to the\nearly part of the conflict, they proved poorly suited to the conventional warfare that\ncharacterized the Haganah offensive. As a result, Zionist units quickly achieved their\nobjectives in all parts of the mandate\u2014particularly on the Jerusalem front. There, they\nfocused on capturing the strategic hilltop-village of al-Qastal, which commanded the\n86 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 196\u2013\n204.\n87 Morris, 204\u20136. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 417\nroad to the Holy City. In heavy fighting that saw the settlement change hands several\ntimes, Zionist troops not only secured control of the village in early April, but, in the\nprocess, also killed the Palestinians\u2019 only competent military commander, Abd al-Qadir\nal-Husayni (1907-1948).88\nAn event of even greater significance occurred in the nearby village of Deir Yasin\non the same day that Zionist forces took al-Qastal. Though the settlement had not taken\npart in any of the fighting, Lehi and Irgun decided to launch a joint operation to seize\ncontrol of it so as to ensure the security of the road to Jerusalem. Despite heavy\nresistance and substantial Zionist casualties, they managed to secure the village by\nnoon. It was what happened next that made the attack on Deir Yasin so critical to the\noutcome of the war. Following the battle, the attackers brutally massacred 115 of the\nsurvivors\u2014the majority of whom were women, children, or the elderly. Some were\nparaded through West Jerusalem before they were killed; others had their mutilated\ncorpses shoved down the village\u2019s wells. While the incident would soon become\ninfamous, it was not entirely unique in the fighting for control of the mandate. Indeed,\njust four days after the massacre, Palestinian irregulars retaliated by ambushing a\nZionist medical convoy outside Jerusalem and killing seventy nurses and doctors.89\nThe capture of al-Qastal, the loss of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, and, especially, the\nmassacre at Deir Yasin profoundly altered the course of the war. Permanently tipping\nthe military balance on the Jerusalem front in favor of the Zionists, Al-Husayni\u2019s death\nand the Haganah victory at al-Qastal were of enormous military significance. From that\npoint forward, supplies could flow unimpeded to Jewish West Jerusalem\u2014a situation\nthat greatly eased the Yishuv\u2019s heretofore-challenging strategic situation.90\nIn contrast, the massacre at Deir Yasin was of little military consequence, but\nproved to be of decisive psychological significance. Immediately following the incident,\nboth the Arab states and the Jewish terrorist organizations that had perpetrated the\nmassacre aggressively publicized the incident\u2014the former to damage the Zionists\u2019\nreputation, and the latter to weaken the Palestinians\u2019 will to fight and to encourage them\nto flee. Lehi and Irgun received a vastly greater return on their effort than did the Arab\nstates. While news of the attack on Deir Yassin did tarnish Israel\u2019s reputation, its\nprimary impact was to so thoroughly demoralize the Palestinian people that they\nabandoned all organized resistance to the Zionists and fled for safety. Most notably,\nwhen the Haganah and Irgun attacked Arab cities such as Haifa, Jaffa, and Tiberias\nduring the latter stages of Plan Dalet, tens of thousands of Palestinians, fearing for their\nlives, took to the road in desperate flight. As a result, by mid-May at least 300,000 had\nbecome refugees.91\n88 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 132\u201334.\n89 Rogan, The Arabs, 258\u201359; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 202\u20133.\n90 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 72\u201374.\n91 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 203. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 418\nWith the success of Plan Dalet as a backdrop, David Ben Gurion formally\ndeclared the birth of the Jewish state\u2014which the Zionists named Israel\u2014on May 14,\n1948, the date of Britain\u2019s official departure from the mandate. The Yishuv was well\nprepared for this momentous day. In sharp contrast to the Palestinians, who had failed\nto establish effective governing bodies and whose society had crumbled under the\nweight of Plan Dalet, the Zionists had succeeded in building strong administrative\nstructures that they could easily convert into the institutions of a modern state. The\nJewish National Council seamlessly transformed into the provisional government, and\nthe Haganah, with little more than a name change, became the new state\u2019s military: the\nIsraeli Defense Force (IDF). Yishuv leaders had also skillfully laid the groundwork for\nIsrael\u2019s formal diplomatic recognition As a result, almost immediately after Ben Gurion\ndeclared the establishment of Israel, the world\u2019s two most powerful countries\u2014the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union\u2014extended diplomatic recognition.92\nStill, the day was not an entirely sunny one. In the wake of Plan Dalet, the Arab\nLeague states had decided to reverse an earlier decision to send only volunteers and\narms in support of the Palestinians and declared that they were preparing to mount a\ncoordinated assault against the new state. This was grim news for the Israeli\ngovernment, and it cast the future of the new state in doubt. Indeed, when a concerned\nBen Gurion asked IDF leaders for an assessment of the new strategic situation, they\ninformed him that Israel had no better than fifty-fifty odds of surviving a concerted Arab\nLeague attack.93\nConventional War, May 15, 1948-January 9, 1949\nThus, just as the civil war between Zionists and Palestinians was coming to an\nend, the first formal Arab-Israeli War began. The conflict was a start-and-stop affair that\ninvolved three rounds of often-fierce fighting interrupted by two lengthy, UN-sponsored\nceasefires during which diplomats desperately sought a peaceful resolution of the\nconflict. Like the civil war that preceded it, the conventional contest between Israel and\nthe Arab states ended in a decisive victory for the Zionists\u2014one that resulted in the\npermanent expulsion from Israel of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees.94\nDespite its eventual victory, Israel did not seem to be in a commanding position\nduring the first round of fighting. The day after British troops evacuated the mandate,\nforces from Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq\u2014later joined by token\ncontingents from Yemen and Saudi Arabia\u2014invaded Palestine just as their\ngovernments had promised. The IDF deployed units to contain these advances in the\nsouth and in the Galilee while it launched a concurrent offensive aimed at seizing East\nJerusalem and its holy sites. In response, Transjordan\u2019s powerful Arab Legion occupied\npositions in and around the Old City. Disciplined and well equipped, it stopped the IDF\nassault on East Jerusalem cold and then defeated a series of fierce attacks on the\n92 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 34\u201335; Oren, Power, Faith, and Fantasy, 498\u2013500.\n93 Oren, Power, Faith, and Fantasy, 498\u2013500; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 34\u201335.\n94 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 35, 56. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 419\nnearby fortified hilltop town of Latrun, which commanded the road between the Holy City\nand Tel Aviv.95\nExhausted by the fighting, both sides agreed to a United Nations-brokered\nceasefire that went into effect on June 11, 1948. During the truce, the UN imposed an\narms embargo on the region and tasked the Swedish diplomat Count Folke Bernadotte\n(1895-1948) with finding a way to end the fighting. A skilled mediator, he put forward a\nproposal in late June that centered on jettisoning the UN partition plan in favor of a\nfederated union of Palestine and Transjordan that had autonomous Jewish and Arab\nsections. According to his proposal, Transjordan would annex the territory near\nJerusalem that Resolution 181 had assigned to the Palestinians as well the Negev\nDesert in the south that the UN had allotted to the Jewish state; the Arab territory would\nthus be a contiguous block. Meanwhile, Israel would gain control of the fertile Western\nGalilee region that the original partition plan had granted to the Palestinians and that its\nforces had already overrun. As a result, the Jewish state would also possess a unified\nterritory. It was a sound idea given the circumstances\u2014and a much-more realistic\nproposal than the UNSCOP plan. Nonetheless, setting a pattern that would torpedo\nother peace proposal for decades to come, both sides rejected it out of hand in hopes\nthat they could instead achieve a total victory.96\nIn the meantime, Israel took advantage of the ceasefire to strengthen its military\nposition. It smuggled in previously purchased heavy weapons, integrated new recruits\ninto its formations, and completed a secret arms purchase with Czechoslovakia. By\nearly July, as a result, the balance of forces had tipped dramatically in favor of the\nIDF.97\nThe second round of fighting reflected that shift. Taking advantage of an\nEgyptian violation of the truce, the IDF used its new weapons to launch offensives on all\nfronts. Aimed at securing Jerusalem, the main effort faltered in the face of continued stiff\nresistance on the part of the Arab Legion. The enormous success that the Israelis\nenjoyed on all other fronts more than offset that failure, however. IDF troops\nsimultaneously took the undefended towns of Lydda and Ramle southeast of Tel Aviv,\ndrove the Lebanese and Syrians back in the north, and badly bloodied the Egyptians in\nthe south. As a result, by the time the second round of fighting had stopped, Israel had\ndramatically improved its military position and had\u2014by seizing control of land that the\nUN had assigned to the Palestinians\u2014substantially increased the amount of territory\nthat it possessed.98\n95 Avi Shlaim, \u201cIsrael and the Arab Coalition in 1948,\u201d in The War for Palestine:\nRewriting the History of 1948, ed.

Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 420\nWith both sides once again looking to pause the fighting, the UN succeeded in\nimposing a second ceasefire on July 18. Taking advantage of the lull, Bernadotte\nreworked his earlier proposal in hopes of finding a formula that could serve as the basis\nfor a lasting peace. Announced on September 16, his new plan followed the broad\noutlines of his previous proposal in terms of territorial adjustments but discarded the\nfederal structure in favor of two, distinct states: Israel and an expanded Transjordan.\nImportantly, it also included a provision guaranteeing that the hundreds of thousands of\nPalestinians who had recently fled their homes would enjoy the right of return.\nBernadotte\u2019s proposal was once again a reasonable one given the circumstances. It\noffered both a means of ending the immediate conflict and a way of establishing a\ndurable peace. At the same time, however, it was also highly unpopular among both\nArabs and Zionists\u2014especially the Israeli revisionists, who viewed it as a threat to their\nmaximalist territorial goals. Indeed, future Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other Lehi\nleaders perceived it to be such a serious danger that they had Bernadotte assassinated\njust a day after he announced the new plan, thereby rendering his revised peace\nproposal stillborn.99\nThe final round of fighting that began on October 15 confirmed Israel\u2019s dominant\nposition. It began in the south. Seeking to take undisputed possession of the Negev\nDesert, IDF forces drove the now-thoroughly demoralized Egyptian army back toward\nthe border. The Israelis then followed with Operation Hiram, which pushed Lebanese\ntroops and Qawuqji\u2019s ALA out of central Galilee and thereby secured full control of the\nnorthernmost territory that Resolution 181 had allotted to the Palestinians. In the\nprocess, IDF troops expelled the Palestinian civilians who lived in the area, with the\nresult that the land Israel had acquired was, in the words of one Israeli officer, \u201c\u2018clean\u2019\nand \u2018empty\u2019 of Arabs.\u201d Finally, after one last Israeli offensive that pushed the Egyptians\nacross the frontier, the UN secured a ceasefire on January 7, 1949, that brought the\n1948 War to an end. By that point, the scale of Israel\u2019s victory was undeniable. The\nZionist state had not merely survived the conflict that accompanied its birth, but had, in\nthe process, secured control of the vast majority of the territory that had composed the\nMandate of Palestine.100\nArmistice Agreements\nPeace talks commenced on January 13, 1949, on the island of Rhodes. With the\nhelp of Bernadotte\u2019s successor, the African American statesmen and civil-rights leader\nRalph Bunche (1904-1971), Israel soon concluded a series of bilateral understandings\nwith the Arab League states that brought the fighting to an end. These agreements did\nnot formally terminate hostilities, however. Instead, since the documents were\nceasefires rather than peace treaties, Israel remained in a technical state of war with its\nneighbors. As such, it could not trade with those countries, exchange ambassadors with\n99 Rogan, The Arabs, 266.\n100 Shlaim, \u201cIsrael and the Arab Coalition in 1948,\u201d 98\u2013100; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 56. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 421\nthem, or establish civil-aviation links between its airports and theirs; Egypt even barred\nships bound for Israel from transiting the Suez Canal.101\nThe armistice agreements also formalized the division of the former mandate\nbetween Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. Israel retained the territory it held at the end of the\nfighting, which totaled 78 percent of the mandate rather than the 56 percent that the UN\nhad allotted it. For its part, Egypt assumed control over the twenty-five-mile-long, five-\nmile-wide ribbon of territory that extended from the Egyptian border northward along the\nMediterranean that has been known since 1948 as the Gaza Strip. Finally, Abdallah\u2019s\nkingdom\u2014renamed Jordan in 1949\u2014formally annexed what came to be called the West\nBank: a slightly reduced version of the block of territory around Jerusalem that the UN\nhad originally assigned to the Palestinians. Finally, Israel and Jordan split the city of\nJerusalem proper between them, with West Jerusalem joining the Jewish state, and the\nOld City, which included the Haram al-Sharif and the Wailing Wall, falling under\nJordanian rule.102\nThe Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Crisis\nThe talks may have ended the fighting, but they did not resolve the situation of\nthe refugees that the war had created. During the conflict, the overwhelming majority of\nthe Arabs who lived in the territory that became Israel had fled their homes. As a result,\nat the time the war ended, while a small minority, roughly 160,000, remained in Israel,\nsome 700,000 other Palestinians found themselves living as displaced persons either in\nthe West Bank, the Gaza Strip, or in the adjoining Arab states. They would never see\ntheir homes again. Instead, thanks to Israel\u2019s adamant refusal to permit them to return\nafter the fighting had ceased, the displaced Palestinians remained refugees following\nthe conflict.103\nWhat accounted for this situation? How could Israel justify its refusal to permit the\nPalestinians the right to return to their homes\u2014a right enshrined in international law?\nBen Gurion\u2019s government advanced two claims in defense of its position. First, it\nasserted that the refugees\u2019 flight was, in itself, a hostile act in support of Arab military\noperations against Israel; as such, the Palestinians had forfeited any right to return to\ntheir homes. Second, after 1950, it argued that the Arab states\u2019 retaliatory expulsion of\n300,000 Middle Eastern and North African Jews obviated Israel of any obligation to\ncontribute to a solution to the Palestinian refugee crisis. After all, it had its own refugee\nsituation to deal with.104\nThe treatment that the Palestinians received from the Arab states to which they\nhad fled was not much better. With the notable exception of Jordan, which granted\ncitizenship to refugees living in its territory, states such as Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria\n101 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 43\u201349.\n102 Shlaim, 43\u201349.\n103 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 82\u201383.\n104 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 230\u201332. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 422\nimposed severe restrictions on the Palestinians. They confined them to the refugee\ncamps that the UN had set up, tightly controlled their movements, and denied them the\nright to employment.105\nWhy did the Arab states refuse to absorb the displaced Palestinians after Israel\nhad made clear that it was not going to permit them to return to their homes? To a\nsubstantial degree, they did so out of fear that the Palestinians might cause unrest\neither by engaging in political activity or by competing for jobs. More cynically, countries\nsuch as Egypt refused to integrate the Palestinians into their societies because they\nperceived a propaganda advantage in keeping them in the camps: images of destitute\nrefugees dwelling in tents provided them with stark visual evidence that could be\ndeployed to damage Israel\u2019s reputation in the increasingly important court of public\nopinion. Thus, despite a UN resolution explicitly calling for the refugees to have the right\nto return to their homes and despite Arab claims of solidarity with the Palestinians,\nhundreds of thousands of refugees and millions of their descendants would languish for\ndecades in dismal, overcrowded refugee camps in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, the\nWest Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Many remain in them to the present day.106\nThe Historical Debate: The New Historians\nThe clich\u00e9 that history is written by the victors accurately characterizes the\nenduring historiographical influence of the unabashedly pro-Zionist traditional\ninterpretation of Israel\u2019s founding. First articulated by Zionist leaders immediately after\nthe 1948 War, that perspective has thoroughly dominated early Western and Israeli\nviews of the establishment of the Jewish state and continues to shape popular\nunderstandings to the present day. Its broad outlines are straightforward. It maintains\nthat the Zionists hoped to peacefully establish a small state in the Holy Land that could\nserve as a refuge for the war-weary Jewish people. Though the Zionists made\nnumerous efforts to arrive at a mutually beneficial understanding with the Palestinians,\nthe Arabs remained implacably opposed and rejected their entreaties out of hand.\nInstead, military forces from seven Arab states invaded Israel just after it declared its\nindependence in an effort to kill the Jewish state in the cradle. In support of that effort,\nArab leaders ordered hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to leave their homes so as\nto ensure that the invading armies could maneuver freely against the IDF. Israel\nappeared to be doomed in the face of this onslaught. Despite being badly outnumbered,\nhowever, the plucky Zionists somehow managed to pull off a miraculous, David-versus-\nGoliath victory against the attackers that secured their new state. Meanwhile, once the\nfighting had ended, the Israelis made clear that they were willing to make substantial\nconcessions in order to secure a just peace for all parties; unfortunately, the Arabs\nremained as implacably hostile as ever and refused to negotiate. Thus, despite its\n105 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 51\u201352.\n106 Edward W. Said, \u201cAfterword: The Consequence of 1948,\u201d in The War for Palestine:\nRewriting the History of 1948, ed. Eugene L.

Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 423\nyearning for peace, Israel remained in a technical state of war with the Arab countries\nfor the next few decades.107\nBased on memoirs, interviews with participants, and, in many cases, lived\nexperience, this account would quickly come to dominate Western and Israeli\nunderstandings of the events of 1947-1948. In Israel, people from across the political\nspectrum accepted it as an accurate account of their nation\u2019s founding, and it served as\nthe basis for the country\u2019s secondary-school history curriculum. In America, it informed\nthe storyline of Leon Uris\u2019s 1958 novel, Exodus, as well as the plot of the film adaptation\nthat director Otto Preminger released in 1960. Both the movie and the novel were huge\nhits. Uris\u2019s book was the most successful work of fiction since Margaret Mitchell\u2019s Gone\nwith the Wind while Preminger\u2019s adaptation was the third highest grossing movie of\n1960. As such, they firmly established the conventional narrative as the dominant\nunderstanding of Israel\u2019s founding in the United States.108\nThe traditional interpretation stood largely without question in Israel and the West\nfor several decades after the 1948 War. Beginning in the 1980s, however, a group of\nyounger Israeli scholars known as the New Historians began to raise questions about its\naccuracy. Drawing on recently declassified Israeli documents,109 New Historians like Avi\nShlaim, Simha Flapan, Benny Morris and Ilan Papp\u00e9 argue not only that the\nconventional narrative\u2014or, as Shlaim calls it, the \u201cheroic-moralistic version\u201d\u2014grossly\ndistorts the events of 1948, but that the people who popularized it did so as part of a\ndeliberate effort to create a sense of national cohesion in Israel and to secure\ninternational support for the Jewish state. These scholars challenge nearly every aspect\nof the conventional narrative, but their most pointed differences with the traditionalists\ncenter on three key topics: the relative disparity in forces, the cause of the Palestinian\nrefugee crisis, and the failure of the combatants to conclude peace and normalized\nrelations following the war.110\nThe New Historians argue, first, that far from being at a military disadvantage,\nIsrael held the upper hand throughout the fighting. They note, for example, that the IDF\nenjoyed a substantial advantage in firepower\u2014particularly after it received a large\nshipment of Czech arms during the first ceasefire. They also demonstrate that Israel not\nonly possessed a numerical advantage from the start of the fighting, but that the\nbalance of forces tipped further and further in the IDF\u2019s favor as the war progressed. As\nAvi Shlaim points out, its strength rose from 35,000 in May 1948 to 65,000 in July to\n107 Avi Shlaim, \u201cThe War of the Israeli Historians,\u201d Annales 59, no. 1 (2004): 161\u201369.\n108 Melani McAlister, Epic Encounters: Culture, Media, and U.S. Interests in the Middle\nEast since 1945, Updated Edition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), 159\u2013\n65; Shlaim, \u201cThe War of the Israeli Historians,\u201d 166.\n109 Israel, to its credit, follows the British thirty-year rule and has thus long since\ndeclassified diplomatic documents pertaining to the 1948 War.

Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 424\n96,000 in December. In contrast, the Arab states deployed only 25,000 troops in\nPalestine at the start of the war and lacked the logistical capabilities to match the IDF\u2019s\ngrowth.111\nThe Arabs were not just outnumbered and out gunned, moreover, but were\nsharply divided among themselves. As Shlaim notes, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia\nsuspected that Abdallah was scheming with the Israelis to annex the West Bank as a\nfirst step toward the creation of a greater Syria under his rule; accordingly, they sent\nforces into Palestine less to attack Israel than to check his ambitions. Their suspicions\nwere correct. Meeting secretly with future Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meier (1898-\n1978) before the war, Abdallah had promised to respect Israeli territory in exchange for\nMeier\u2019s pledge that Israel would accept his annexation of the West Bank. As Shlaim\npoints out, it is true that the deal broke down over the question of which state would\npossess Jerusalem and that Israel and Transjordan subsequently engaged in some of\nthe heaviest fighting of the war on the outskirts of the Holy City. Nonetheless, in the\nbroadest sense, the outline of the agreement held: Israel accepted Transjordan\u2019s\nannexation of the West Bank, and Abdallah kept his troops out of Israeli territory. Happy\nto have one of his Arab rivals taken down a notch, the emir even permitted the IDF to\nshift the bulk of its forces to the Egyptian front in October 1948 unmolested. Thus, Israel\nbenefited not merely from having more and better armed troops, but also from the fact\nthat it faced divided enemies that were as focused on weakening their Arab rivals as on\nattacking the Jewish state.112\nSecond, the New Historians take issue with the conventional interpretation\u2019s\nassessment of the refugee crisis. While acknowledging some instances in which Arab\nleaders urged Palestinians to flee the area of battle, they reject the idea that such\nencouragement was the primary reason that the Palestinians left their homes. Instead,\nthey argue that it was a combination of Israeli attacks on Arab cities during Plan Dalet,\norders instructing IDF commanders to expel Palestinians from villages\u2014often couched\nin euphemistic phrases such as one that encouraged them \u201c\u2018to assist the Arabs to\ndepart\u2019\u201d\u2014and, above all, the rapid spread of news about the Deir Yasin massacre that\nimpelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to flee beginning in April 1948. In other\nwords, in the view of the New Historians, it was Zionist actions rather than Arab\ndirectives that ultimately produced the Palestinian exodus.113\nFinally, the New Historians debunk the idea that Arab intransigence was solely\nresponsible for the inability of the two sides to establish peace and normalized relations\nfollowing the war. Relying on Israeli diplomatic documents, they instead demonstrate\nthat the Arab states bucked popular anti-Israeli sentiment and made a series of\nconciliatory peace proposals following the conclusion of the fighting. For example, they\nshow that Egypt\u2019s king Faruq (r. 1936-1952) had sent out peace feelers as early as\nSeptember 1948 and that Abdallah had long signaled his openness to a deal. They also\n111 Shlaim, \u201cIsrael and the Arab Coalition in 1948,\u201d 79\u2013101.\n112 Shlaim, 79\u2013101.\n113 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 257. Chapter Thirteen: The Establishment of Israel, 1918-1948 Page 425\npoint out that Syrian Colonel Husni Zaim (r. 1949), who had seized power in March\n1949, offered not only to recognize Israel but to permanently resettle 300,000\nPalestinian refugees in his country in exchange for a small strip of territory and control\nof the eastern half of the Sea of Galilee. Still, as substantial as this offer was, Ben\nGurion rejected it out of hand. Believing that Israel had time on its side and that it had\ngotten everything it needed through the armistice arrangements, he refused to consider\nyielding even a fraction of an acre of Israeli territory in exchange for peace. \u201c\u2018I am not in\na hurry and I can wait ten years,\u2019\u201d he told one reporter, \u201c\u2018We are under no pressure\nwhatsoever.\u2019\u201d Thus, the New Historians conclude, it was Israeli intransigence rather\nthan Arab hostility that ensured that the two sides failed to secure a durable peace at\nthe conclusion of the 1948 War.114\nPeace?\nProblematically, the increasingly inflexible positions that each side adopted\nfollowing the conflict meant that stability and normalized relations became less rather\nthan more likely as the years passed. For the Israelis, the hardening of attitudes was a\nfunction of recent Jewish history. The contrast between the Jewish experience in the\nHolocaust and the 1948 War had driven home the lesson that they could never again let\nhostile acts go unpunished; as a result, both revisionists and Labor Zionists alike\nredoubled their commitment to the Iron Wall strategy of securing peace through\noverwhelming strength. For Arab leaders, meanwhile, growing inflexibility toward Israel\nwas a product of public opinion. Repeatedly, the Arab people made clear that, at a\nminimum, there could be no peace that did not involve the return of the Palestinians to\ntheir homes\u2014a possibility that the Israelis had declared, with equal insistence, to be off\nthe table. Unsurprisingly, given these positions, the two sides would remain locked in a\nstate of war for decades. Indeed, Israel only ended its formal state of war with Egypt in\n1979 and with Jordan in 1994; remarkably, it remains in a technical state of war with\nSyria and Lebanon at the time of this writing.115\nConclusion\nFew grasped in the years leading up to 1948 that Israel\u2019s creation would have\nsuch a disruptive impact on the Middle East. Perhaps the most far sighted among them\nwas a young, British-born member of the AHC\u2019s Arab Office named Albert Hourani\n(1915-1993), who would go on to be one of the greatest historians of the region. While\ngiving testimony to a fact-finding group in the late 1940s, he predicted that the\nestablishment of a Jewish state in Palestine would completely destabilize the region. It\nwould, he argued, \u201c\u2018involve a terrible injustice and could only be carried out at the\nexpense of dreadful repressions and disorders, with the risk of bringing down in ruins\nthe whole political structure of the Middle East.\u2019\u201d Hourani\u2019s statement proved painfully\nprophetic\u2014accurately predicting the sweeping changes and embrace of radicalism that\nthe region would experience over the course of the 1950s and 1960s.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967\nIntroduction\nBy the late 1940s, the core of the Arab Middle East\u2014Egypt, Syria, Lebanon,\nJordan, and Iraq\u2014had secured formal independence from the European imperial\npowers that had controlled the region during the interwar period. Now free to chart their\nown course, the people of those states expected rapid economic growth, political\npopulism, unity, the defeat of Israel, and an assertive, independent foreign policy.\nDespite persistent instability in the region, they appeared to be well on their way toward\nrealizing those aspirations under the dominant political figure of the age: Egypt\u2019s\ncharismatic president, Gamal abdel Nasser (r. 1954-1970). Indeed, to the delight of the\nArab people, he defied the imperial powers, imposed sweeping economic and political\nreforms, threatened Israel, and even, for a brief period, seemed poised to erase the\nfrontiers that Europe had imposed on the region following the First World War. It was an\nexhilarating period for nationalists\u2014a time of hope and anticipation for a brighter future\nfor the Arab people.\nFraming the Postwar Middle East\nThe Middle East that Nasser dominated was, even by the standards of the times,\na complex and volatile place. Between 1949 and 1967, the region experienced a\ndizzying array of coups, assassinations, purges, covert operations, conspiracies,\nterrorist incidents, interstate conflicts, Great Power interventions, and diplomatic crises.\nWhat explains the Middle East\u2019s volatility during this period? Why did it experience such\na high degree of instability? Many local, regional, and international forces played a role\nin spurring the volatility that characterized the 1950s and 1960s in the Middle East.\nUltimately however, it was a combination of four overlapping currents\u2014decolonization,\nthe ideology of Arab nationalism, the Cold War, and the Arab-Israeli conflict\u2014that,\ncollectively, constituted the wellsprings of regional instability during this period.\nDecolonization\nThe first of these, decolonization, began in the interwar period. Decolonization\nwas the often-contested process by which subject peoples used diplomacy, force, and\ncollective popular actions to challenge and then dissolve their subordinate relationships\nwith the imperial powers. It played a central role in framing the development of the\nMiddle East in the 1950s and 1960s. Indeed, decolonization shaped nearly all of the\nconflicts and political disturbances that the region experienced during those years. That\nit did so is perhaps surprising in light of the fact that the Arab countries at the core of the\nregion had all achieved political independence by 1946. As such, they exercised the\nprerogatives of sovereign members of the international community such as maintaining\ndiplomatic relations with other states and holding seats in the United Nations (UN). Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 428\nAppearances very much obscured the fact that Britain continued to dominate the\nArab Middle East well into the postwar era, however. Through treaties, ties with political\nclients, economic concessions, and the maintenance of military bases, London\ncontinued to informally dominate a number of Arab states coming out of World War II. In\nJordan, a $35 million annual subsidy coupled with continued control of the country\u2019s\npowerful Arab Legion afforded London enormous leverage. In neighboring Iraq, Britain\u2019s\npossession of two airbases, its dominant position in the consortium that held the\nconcession to exploit oil, and its close relations with King Faysal II (r. 1939-1958) and\nthe country\u2019s leading politician, Nuri al-Said (1888-1958), assured it of substantial\ninfluence. In Egypt, finally, Britain\u2019s ownership of the strategic Suez Canal, its control of\nSudan\u2014which Cairo hoped to retain as an Egyptian colony\u2014and its maintenance by\nway of treaty of a huge military complex ensured that it continued to hold a commanding\nposition.1\nBritain and the Arab states\u2019 divergent goals in the region ensured that the\ndecolonization endgame in the Middle East would be fractious, bitterly contested, and\ndestabilizing. London, for its part, was disinclined to withdraw from the region or even to\nmoderate its involvement. Weakened by World War II and by the loss of its valuable\ncolony in India in 1947, Britain believed that its position in the Middle East was essential\nto its continued status as a Great Power; as a result, it vigorously resisted demands that\nit loosen its grip on the region. The Arabs were no more inclined to compromise than\nwas London. Nationalist army officers, Islamic organizations, and popular Arab political\nmovements alike found Britain\u2019s ongoing indirect control of the Middle East to be utterly\nintolerable and loudly insisted on an immediate end to its influence in the region. As a\nresult, the British government and anti-imperialist forces in the Arab world would find\nthemselves locked in a bitter struggle over decolonization in the immediate postwar\nera\u2014a contest that would come to color nearly all aspects of the Middle East\u2019s\ndevelopment.2\nArab Nationalism\nThe ideology of Arab nationalism also played a critical role in shaping the\npostwar Middle East. Maturing during the interwar period and especially in the 1940s,\nArab nationalism held that the Arabs constituted a single people linked by a common\nhistory, culture, and language, and that their present subordinate situation stemmed\nlargely from the fact that the Europeans had deliberately partitioned the Middle East\nfollowing the First World War in order to weaken them. Their prescription for the ills of\nthe Arab world followed from this view. By overthrowing collaborationist governments\nsuch as Jordan\u2019s and Iraq\u2019s and by replacing the European-imposed fragmentation of\n1 Salim Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism: The Eisenhower Doctrine and the Middle\nEast, First Edition (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 121;\nArthur Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt (New York: Checkmark Books, 2008), 140.\n2 Eugene Rogan, The Arabs: A History \u2013 Revised and Updated Edition (New York:\nBasic Books, 2012), 277\u2013318. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 429\nthe Arab world with political unity and shared purpose, the Arabs could once again\nstand up and restore themselves to the glory of their ancestors.3\nTwo schools of Arab-nationalist thought\u2014moderate and Ba\u2019athist\u2014vied for\ndominance in the two decades after World War II. Moderates acknowledged the reality\nof local nationalist sentiments and thus accepted the political division of the Arab world\ninto separate states. As such, rather than pushing for the unification of existing\ngovernments into a single state, they called for the Arab countries to work collectively to\ncoordinate their economic programs, defense policies, and, especially, diplomatic\nstrategies. It was this line of thinking that led to the development of the Arab League in\n1945.4\nSharply critical of the moderates, the Ba\u2019athists instead championed a more\nradical and far-reaching construction of Arab nationalism. Two Syrians, the Christian\nMichel Aflaq (1910-1989) and the Muslim Salah al-Din al-Bitar (1912-1980), developed\nthe basic tenets of the ideology in the 1940s and founded the transnational Ba\u2019ath or\n\u201cRenaissance\u201d Party in 1947. With branches in a number of Arab countries, the\nmovement focused on the achievement of two overarching goals: the establishment of\nan equitable society and, more importantly, the replacement of the existing, Western-\ncreated Arab countries with a single, unified state. Achieving those goals would not be\neasy. The leaders of the existing Arab monarchies and republics not only had a vested\ninterest in the continued division of the Middle East, but, deeply embedded as they were\nin the imperialist powers\u2019 exploitive economic system, could be relied upon to oppose\nthe call for equity and social justice. Thus, the Ba\u2019athists concluded, the Arab people\ncould only achieve a true rebirth rooted in equity and social justice by first overthrowing\nthe collaborationist governments.5\nThe Cold War\nThe third current that shaped the region in the postwar era was the diplomatic,\neconomic, and military competition between the US and the USSR known as the Cold\nWar. For two reasons, the global contest between the superpowers would have a\npeculiar focus on the Middle East. First, though both produced enormous quantities of\noil, the Soviet Union and the US alike correctly perceived the strategic and economic\nsignificance that petroleum would play as the world continued to industrialize.\nAccordingly, each sought to control the Middle East\u2019s oil reserves to meet its future\nneeds and, in America\u2019s case, to ensure that its allies in Europe and Japan could\naccess the cheap energy on which the postwar reconstruction of their shattered\neconomies depended. Second, both understood the geostrategic significance of the\nMiddle East in a future superpower conflict. Situated just to the south of the Soviet\n3 Ira M.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 430\nborder, it was, immediately after World War II, the only territory from which long-range\nAmerican B-29 bombers could strike Soviet industrial targets in the Ural region; later, it\nwould provide the Soviets with bases from which their naval and air forces could\nmenace American strategic, ballistic-missile submarines operating in the Mediterranean\nSea.6\nGiven its strategic and economic importance, it is unsurprising that the Middle\nEast emerged as one of the first theaters in the Cold War. As we saw in chapter eleven,\nthe Soviet Union had sought to secure an oil concession in northern Iran and had\nattempted to strongarm Turkey into giving it control over the Bosporus and Dardanelles\nStraits immediately following the end of World War II. Two of the most important\nopening salvos in the Cold War, these events powerfully influenced Washington\u2019s\nevolving views of Soviet behavior. In particular, they played an important part in shaping\nthe containment policy that the American diplomat George Kennan (1904-2005) first\narticulated in 1947. Predicated on the assumption that the USSR would collapse if it\ncould no longer expand, containment called for the US to counter Moscow\u2019s efforts to\nincrease its influence outside the Eastern Bloc. The crises in Iran and Turkey not only\nshaped Kennan\u2019s thinking but also proved critical in leading President Harry Truman\n(r. 1945-1953) to put containment into practice through the issuance of the Truman\nDoctrine in 1947. One of the most critical initiatives of the Cold War, it justified a request\nfor $400 million in economic and military aid in support of Greek and Turkish efforts to\nresist communist aggression in part on the need to prevent \u201c\u2018confusion and disorder\n[from] spreading throughout the entire Middle East.\u2019\u201d7\nThe region\u2019s importance as a theater in the Cold War grew substantially over the\ncourse of the 1950s and 1960s. In the process, the superpower contest powerfully\u2014and\nadversely\u2014affected the region. Both the USSR and the US frequently interpreted\nevents in the Middle East through a Cold War lens, and both sought to use their power\nand patronage to shape the region to their advantage in the global struggle. Proxies and\nallies within the Middle East did not always share their patrons\u2019 Cold War perspective;\nhowever, they were more than happy to exploit the superpower conflict to achieve their\nown ends\u2014an approach that often resulted in the global struggle intensifying existing\nregional conflicts. Thus, in sharp contrast to Europe where the superpower contest\nwould come to inhibit intraregional conflicts, the Cold War would interact with other\nforces in the Middle East, such as decolonization and Arab nationalism, to deepen fault\nlines and intensify regional conflicts.8\n6 Rashid Khalidi, Sowing Crisis: The Cold War and American Dominance in the Middle\nEast (Boston: Beacon Press, 2010), 15\u201316, 44\u201346, 111.\n7 \u201cThe Truman Doctrine,\u201d March 12, 1947,\nhttps://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=81&page=transcript.\n8 Khalidi, Sowing Crisis, 101\u201358. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 431\nThe Arab-Israeli Conflict\nThe final current that shaped the postwar Middle East, the Arab-Israeli conflict,\nwas not only the most intense but also likely the most important in shaping the region\u2019s\ndevelopment between 1949 and 1967. The battle lines here were hard and fast. With\nmany of its citizens having recently experienced the horrors of the Holocaust or been\nexpelled from their homes in the Arab world, there existed in Israel an overwhelming\npreference for an aggressive, Iron Wall-informed approach to national security over one\nthat sought peace through compromise or negotiation. For their part, the Arabs, saw\nwhat they termed the \u201c\u2018Zionist entity\u2019\u201d as an affront to their nationalist aspirations and as\na European settler-colonial venture\u2014\u201c\u2018the fruit,\u2019\u201d in Nasser\u2019s words, \u201c\u2018of imperialism.\u2019\u201d As\na result, Arab governments refused to recognize Israel and loudly and publicly called for\nits destruction.9\nExacerbated by the ongoing plight of the Palestinian refugees, the standoff\nbetween Israel and its Arab neighbors dramatically shaped both the internal political\nevolution of the Middle Eastern states and their foreign policies. Domestically, it\ninflamed popular sentiments, generated friction between leaders committed to a\nhardline approach and those willing to consider a negotiated settlement, and, in the\nArab states, justified violence and extraconstitutional actions that would destabilize\ncountries for decades to come. In the realm of international relations, meanwhile, the\nArab-Israeli conflict led both Israel and the Arab states to become enmeshed in the Cold\nWar\u2014even when they explicitly rejected the Manichaean logic on which it rested\u2014\nbecause affiliation with one camp or the other provided the only reliable way to get the\ndiplomatic support and sophisticated weapons needed to keep pace with the other side.\nIn sum, in the 1950s and 1960s, the Arab-Israeli conflict would\u2014in conjunction with\ndecolonization, Arab nationalism, and the Cold War\u2014militarize the Middle East, distort\nits political, social, and economic development, and ensure that the region failed to\nestablish a stable international order.10\nThe Legacy of the 1948 War, 1949-1955\nThe interplay between the Arab-Israeli conflict and the forces of decolonization,\nArab nationalism, and the Cold War was especially strong in the years immediately after\nIsrael\u2019s founding. As we saw in chapter thirteen, the 1948 War that had accompanied\nthe Jewish state\u2019s birth was a watershed moment that dramatically reshaped the\npolitical and ideological contours of the Middle East. It affected Israel and its Arab\nenemies very differently, however. For the Arab states, defeat at the hands of Israel\u2014\nparticularly after their governments had promised an easy victory\u2014had delegitimated\nthe ruling elites and set the stage for a period of instability and sweeping political\nchange that lent strength to both the decolonization process and Arab nationalism. For\nIsrael, in contrast, success in 1948 buoyed public spirits, legitimated its government,\n9 Benny Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920\n(New York: Vintage Books, 2001), 267.\n10 Khalidi, Sowing Crisis, 114\u201340. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 432\nand solidified support for the hardline, Iron Wall approach that Ze\u2019ev Jabotinsky (1880-\n1940) had first articulated and that David Ben Gurion (r. 1948-1954, 1955-1963) and\nother Labor Zionists had come to adopt as their own.11\nIsrael: Infiltration and the Iron Wall\nIsraelis emerged from the 1948 War with a newfound sense of confidence and a\nreaffirmation of the belief that they could best ensure the survival of their country\nthrough military force. Celebrating the \u201c\u2018New Zionist Man\u2019\u201d who refused to let any slight\npass unpunished, they looked favorably on their army\u2019s aggressive and successful\ndefense of their infant country and contrasted it with the seeming helplessness with\nwhich Europe\u2019s Jewish people had responded to the Holocaust. The country\u2019s\nleadership shared this view. Despite overtures from some Arab leaders, they refused to\nnegotiate after the victory in 1948. Instead, aware that a Western arms embargo called\nthe Tripartite Agreement had frozen Israel\u2019s dominant military position in place, David\nBen Gurion\u2019s Labor Zionist coalition government opted to rely on an Iron Wall strategy\nof military intimidation to maintain Israel\u2019s security.12\nPalestinian infiltration into Israel following the 1948 War soon presented a test of\nthat commitment. Even before the fighting had ceased in early 1949, refugees had\nbegun crossing the frontier into Israel. The vast majority of them did so for benign\nreasons. Most merely sought to harvest crops on their former land, to recover property,\nto visit relatives, or to smuggle goods. However, a small proportion entered Israel to\nengage in sabotage or to launch terrorist attacks. Though disorganized and infrequent,\nthose incursions imposed a tangible and painful cost on the Jewish state. They resulted\nin the deaths of nineteen Israelis in 1950, forty-eight in 1952, and a further forty-two in\n1953. They were especially demoralizing to the North African, or Maghribian, and\nMiddle Eastern, or Mizrahim, immigrants whom the government had settled in\nmoshavim: communal agricultural settlements established along the frontier for the\npurpose of asserting control over the border. Indeed, infiltration attacks had led so many\nMizrahim and Maghribian Jewish people to flee the moshavim by the early 1950s, that\nofficials in the Jewish Agency were coming to fear that the effort to use the settlements\nto control the border was teetering on the edge of failure.13\nWith its experience in the 1948 War having affirmed the belief that the Arabs\ncould be best deterred through force, David Ben Gurion\u2019s Labor Zionist government\nopted to respond to rising infiltration with an aggressive, Iron Wal approach. Initially, Tel\nAviv moved to discourage incursions through actions on the Israeli side of the border.\nIsraeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers set booby traps, laid mines, organized ambushes,\n11 Charles D.

Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict (New York: Pearson, 2008), 24. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 433\nand adopted a deadly \u201c\u2018free fire\u2019 policy\u201d in which they shot at suspected infiltrators\nwithout warning. All told, this approach resulted in the deaths of between 2,700 and\n5,600 Palestinians between 1949 and 1956.14\nSomewhat later, the IDF began to supplement that strategy with an even-more\naggressive policy centered on launching disproportionate retaliatory attacks against the\nvillages from which the infiltrators had originated. This new approach had three\ninterrelated goals: it sought to deter future infiltration, to spur the Arab states to prevent\nfurther incursions, and, in keeping with the Iron Wall approach\u2019s emphasis on military\nintimidation, to demonstrate the futility of contesting Israel\u2019s overwhelming military\nsuperiority. Collective punishment of Arab villages suspected of aiding infiltration began\nin 1951 and crested in October 1953 when Unit 101, an elite special-operations force\ncommanded by future prime minister Ariel Sharon (1928-2014), attacked the Jordanian-\nruled West Bank Village of Qibya. Resulting in the demolition of forty-five homes and\nthe deaths of sixty-nine Palestinians\u2014two thirds of whom were women and children\u2014\nthe operation proved popular in the Jewish state but inflamed public opinion in the Arab\nworld and sparked international condemnation of Israeli militarism.15\nThe Arab States: Assassination, Instability and Leadership Changes\nIsrael\u2019s victory in 1948 also profoundly affected the Arab monarchies and\nrepublics. The war\u2019s impact on those states was very different than it had been on\nIsrael, however. While success had solidified support for Ben Gurion\u2019s government,\ndefeat had instead dramatically weakened approval of the Arab states. The abject\nfailure of the Arab governments to prevent the establishment of Israel\u2014and, especially,\ntheir inability to provision their armies with adequate food and ammunition\u2014thoroughly\ndelegitimated their governments and ruling elites and left them vulnerable, isolated, and\nweak. The result was a series of rapid and often bloody coups and assassination\nattempts immediately after 1948 that ended with a new group, the officer corps,\nassuming a dominant position in the Arab states.16\nThis process began in Syria. Frustrated by the civilian government\u2019s poor support\nof the war effort, Colonel Husni al-Za\u2019im (r. 1949) seized control of the government in\nMarch 1949 in a coup so well executed that CIA officers subsequently studied it as a\nmodel of effective regime change. Za\u2019im proved considerably less successful in\nmaintaining his grip on power than on assuming it, however. Opposed to his willingness\nto pursue peace with Israel, a hardline faction of officers overthrew and executed him in\nAugust 1949; they in turn fell from power in a third coup that December. Za\u2019im was not\nthe only Arab leader to perish at that time as a result of a willingness to negotiate with\nIsrael, moreover. In what amounted to a declaration of popular opposition to peace with\n14 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 272\u201374.\n15 Avi Shlaim, The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World, Revised and Expanded (New\nYork: W.

Following the brief and\nunhappy rule of Abdallah\u2019s mentally unstable son, Talal (r. 1951-1952), his sixteen-year-\nold grandson, Hussein (r. 1952-1999), succeeded to the throne.17\nThe Egyptian Revolution, 1952\nThe next change in government in the region was far-more consequential.\nLaunched in 1952, the Egyptian Revolution not only put the officer corps in charge of\nthe largest Arab state but also set the stage for the military\u2019s dominance of the entire\nArab world for the following two decades. Dissatisfaction with civilian rule among the\nEgyptian officers had grown rapidly in the years before 1948. Many had long been\nfrustrated with King Faruq\u2019s (r. 1936-1952) venality and with the Wafd Party\u2019s corruption\nand inability to end Western dominance; some had even toyed with the idea of a coup in\nthe past. It was Egypt\u2019s defeat at the hands of Israel, however, that turned them\nirrevocably against the old order. Blaming their failure in 1948 on the government\u2019s\ninability to provide adequate supplies to the units deployed to Palestine, a group of\njunior officers hailing largely from the lower-middle-class resolved that Egypt could only\nachieve real independence and national greatness under a new, reform-minded,\nmilitary-dominated, Arab-nationalist government. Led by a thirty-four-year-old son of a\npostal worker, Lieutenant Colonel Gamal abdel Nasser, they organized a secret,\nrevolutionary society immediately after the war called the Free Officers and began\nplotting not merely the overthrow of Faruq but the end of the entire liberal order. It was a\nbold objective for a group of young men of comparatively low rank; accordingly, the\nFree Officers recruited a sympathetic senior figure, the fifty-one-year-old General\nMuhammad Naguib (1901-1984) to serve as a figurehead who could, once they\nassumed power, lend them the gravitas that they lacked.18\nGovernment missteps soon gave them the chance to act. Seeking to restore the\nWafd Party\u2019s popular standing after the war by negotiating a revision of the Anglo-\nEgyptian Treaty of 1936, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Nahhas (1879-1965) initiated talks\nwith London in early 1950. Begun with great fanfare, the negotiations soon\ndeadlocked\u2014just as they had in the 1920s and 1930s. This time, the discussions\nfoundered over London\u2019s insistence on retaining control of the massive base complex it\npossessed in the Canal Zone. Frustrated, al-Nahhas adopted a more forceful approach\nin October 1951. Seeking to pressure the British, he unilaterally abrogated the treaty\nand encouraged popular guerrilla attacks and acts of sabotage against imperial troops\nand installations. It was an ill-considered move. Paramilitary attacks on imperial\npositions along the canal spurred British soldiers to respond with a series of escalating\n17 Hugh Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game: The CIA\u2019s Secret Arabists and the Shaping of\nthe Modern Middle East (New York: Basic Books, 2013), 100\u2013108; Philip Robins, A\nHistory of Jordan, Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2019), 77\u2013\n85.\n18 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 144\u201345. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 435\nmilitary actions that culminated in January 1952 in a massive assault on a police\nbarracks in Isma\u2019iliyya that killed forty-six Egyptian police officers. Infuriated,\nmainstream nationalists scheduled a general strike in Cairo for the following day to\nprotest the incident. Unfortunately for them, the demonstration rapidly degenerated into\nan orgy of violence and looting. By the time the smoke cleared on what came to be\nknown as Black Saturday, fifty Egyptians and seventeen foreigners lay dead, and\ndozens of businesses associated with the West and the Egyptian upper class\u2014\ndepartment stores, automobile dealerships, night clubs, and high-end hotels\u2014had been\nreduced to ashes in a series of well-planned arson attacks.19\nThose buildings were not all that lay in ruins that day. The fighting in Isma\u2019iliyya\nand the destruction and looting on Black Saturday also marked the end of the line for\nEgypt\u2019s old regime. Unable either to negotiate an end to Britain\u2019s presence in the canal\nzone or to maintain order in the capital, Faruq, the Wafd Party, and the entire\nparliamentary system had lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the Egyptian people and\nwere, from that point forward, living on borrowed time.20\nThe Free Officers\u2019 revolution finally came on July 23, 1952. Thanks to the old\norder\u2019s unpopularity, Nasser and his allies were able to seize control of the government\nwith little difficulty in a nearly bloodless coup. They followed by establishing a new\nexecutive organ, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), nominally headed by\nNaguib, to oversee the political changes that they intended to implement.21\nDespite the Free Officers\u2019 later reputation as militant revolutionaries, they did not\nimmediately implement a radical agenda. Instead, having no firm ideological positions at\nthat time beyond adherence to moderate Arab nationalism and an ambiguous\ncommitment to social progress, they focused initially on securing three objectives that\nwould strengthen their position: the elimination of rival sources of political power, the\npassage of a series of populist reforms, and the signing of an agreement with London\nthat would\u2014at last\u2014secure the removal of British troops from Egypt.22\nConsolidation of Power\nNasser and the officers first moved to eliminate any potential threats to their\ncontrol of Egypt. They dissolved the legislature, suspended the constitution, arrested\nkey political leaders on corruption charges, and deposed and replaced King Faruq with\nhis infant son, Fuad II (r. 1952-1953). They also outlawed all political parties including\n19 Rogan, The Arabs, 280\u201381.\n20 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 142.\n21 Arthur Goldschmidt Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State (New York:\nRoutledge, 2004), 144\u201346.\n22 Alain Roussillon, \u201cRepublican Egypt Interpreted: Revolution and Beyond,\u201d in The\nCambridge History of Egypt.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 436\nthe Egyptian Communist Party and replaced them with a new mass movement called\nthe Liberation Rally. Renamed the National Union in 1956 when the Free Officers\nreorganized it along more explicitly pan-Arabist lines, the Liberation Rally was not a\npolitical party in the conventional sense. Instead, it was a device that the officers\ncreated to connect with, control, and mobilize the masses in support of the RCC and its\ninitiatives. Finally, seeking to blunt leftist criticisms, they formally abolished the\nmonarchy in June 1953 and declared Egypt a republic. For lack of a better candidate,\nNasser and the RCC decided to elevate Naguib to the newly created office of\npresident.23\nNasser and his supporters\u2019 efforts to assume a monopoly over political power\nwere not yet entirely complete, however. Two challenges remained to be addressed: the\nMuslim Brotherhood and President Naguib. While initially cordial, relations between the\nofficers and the brotherhood had grown strained over the course of 1953 owing to the\nfact that neither wished to share power. Nasser and his allies consequently began to\nconsider taking steps to curb the organization in early 1954. They realized in short\norder, however, that doing so lay beyond their capabilities at that time. The brotherhood\npossessed a large following, a robust apparatus of schools and social welfare\norganizations, and a potent paramilitary wing. Accordingly, the officers decided to wait\nuntil they were in a stronger position before moving against the brotherhood.\nMeanwhile, to the surprise of many, Naguib had emerged as a genuine threat to Nasser\nand his allies. A supporter of the pluralistic, democratic system that the RCC had been\nsystematically dismantling, the general had become popular with the masses and, more\ndangerously, had secured a substantial following among the officers. This threat was\none that Nasser and his allies could not put off. Accordingly, they engineered a\nbureaucratic showdown in the spring of 1954 that ended with Naguib being purged from\nthe government. Thereafter, Nasser, who formally took the title of president in 1956,\nenjoyed unquestioned control of the RCC and, by extension, the country of Egypt.24\nPopulism\nIn the meantime, Nasser and his RCC allies were also moving to secure the\nrevolution by implementing a series of populist economic and social reforms. On the\nsurface, these changes appeared to be far reaching. They included a ban on the use of\ntraditional titles such as pasha and bey, caps on rents, the establishment of wage\nminimums, and the legalization of unions. Most importantly, they included a package of\nland-reform laws. Designed to improve the lot of the poorest peasants, the program\nplaced limits on the amount of property any single individual could own and redistributed\nthe excess land to poor peasants.25\n23 Steven A. Cook, The Struggle for Egypt: From Nasser to Tahrir Square, Reprint\nedition (Oxford University Press, 2011), 91\u201392; Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The\nFormation of a Nation State, 104\u201313.\n24 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 147\u201352.\n25 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 44\u201347. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 437\nA closer look reveals, however, that the RCC\u2019s early reform package was in fact\nquite tepid. Reflecting the fact that the officers remained as yet uncommitted to a\nparticular ideological position, the changes they implemented tended to be modest in\nterms of both method and impact. The officers\u2019 conservatism was most evident in their\nsignature initiative: land reform. That program did not simply take land from absentee\nowners and directly redistribute it the fellahin. Instead, it reimbursed property owners for\ntheir losses and required the destitute peasants who had obtained land through the\nprogram to shoulder part of the cost. As a result, it did little to alter the distribution of\nwealth and power in Egypt.26\nStill, the broader reform program did pay two important dividends for the officers.\nFirst, by improving the lot of the impoverished masses\u2014however modestly\u2014it turned\nthe fellahin and urban poor into vociferous supporters of Nasser and the officers.\nSecond, the land redistribution component of the officers\u2019 reform program weakened the\neconomic and political power of a critical component of the Wafd Party: the landed elite.\nIn so doing, it left the Wafd too weak to mount a serious challenge during the RCC\u2019s\nvulnerable early years.27\nThe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1954\nMeanwhile, Nasser entered negotiations with London in 1953 that finally secured\nthe evacuation of British troops from the canal zone. Two changes made an agreement\npossible. First, the development of the hydrogen bomb rendered large base complexes\nsuch as the one Britain maintained along the Suez Canal obsolete; As a result, London\nwas more inclined to make concessions than it had been in the past. Second, unlike\nearlier Egyptian leaders, Nasser was willing to drop Egypt\u2019s claims to Sudan. With these\nstumbling blocks out of the way, the two sides were able to quickly reach an agreement.\nSigned in July 1954, the resulting Anglo-Egyptian Treaty called for Britain to remove its\nremaining troops from Egypt no later than June 1956. To the consternation of Egyptian\nnationalists, however, the deal also permitted the British to reoccupy the base complex\nin the event of a war in the Middle East.28\nThe agreement set the stage for Nasser\u2019s final consolidation of power. It was the\nweakness of the treaty, ironically, that made his success possible. Sensing an\nopportunity to challenge the Egyptian leader on nationalist grounds, the Muslim\nBrotherhood launched a coordinated campaign against Nasser\u2019s government that\nculminated in an assassination attempt on the Egyptian leader while he was giving a\nspeech in Alexandria in October 1954. Nasser\u2019s cool response to the attack\u2014he\nremained unflustered and finished his speech as if nothing had happened\u2014created a\nsurge of support that gave him the political capital to mount an aggressive move against\nthe Muslim Brotherhood. The ensuing campaign was a success. The regime arrested\n26 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 146.\n27 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 107.\n28 Douglas Little, American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since\n1945, Third Edition (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), 127\u201328. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 438\nthousands of brotherhood members, imprisoned its leadership, and dismantled its\ninstitutional structure. Severely weakened, it would not recover until the 1970s. Thus, by\nthe end of 1954, Nasser had eliminated the last serious threat to his power. Thereafter,\nhe ruled Egypt without challenge.29\nNasserism\nNasser had risen to power without fixed views or a formal ideology. By the time\nhe consolidated his position in 1954, however, he had come to develop a guiding\nphilosophy, Nasserism, that would shape his subsequent approach to governance,\nregional relations, and global affairs. Nasserism was very much a product of its times.\nCalling for social justice, Arab unity, an end to imperialism, neutrality in the Cold War,\nand the defeat of Israel, it reflected the main ideological currents that shaped the Arab\nworld in the 1950s and 1960s. For a time, it was enormously popular both inside and\noutside Egypt\u2014constituting, from the mid 1950s through 1967, the dominant ideology in\nthe Arab world.30\nDomestically, Nasserism made rapid economic modernization and the\nimprovement of living standards for the neglected lower classes its central objectives.\nLike many other rulers in the Developing World, Nasser did not attempt to achieve these\ngoals through a conventional, market-oriented approach. Leery of the capitalist system\nof development that the imperialist powers championed, he instead sought to attain his\nobjectives through a state directed, Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) model of\ndevelopment based loosely on the program that Ataturk (r. 1923-1938) had\nimplemented in Turkey. Nasser\u2019s new modernization drive focused on agricultural\nexpansion and, especially, the creation of state-owned industrial concerns. Central to\nboth efforts was a planned hydroelectric project, the Aswan High Dam, in upper Egypt.\nThough fabulously expensive\u2014its estimated cost was a then-staggering $1 billion\u2014it\npromised to revolutionize life in Egypt. Once completed, it was expected to expand the\namount of cultivable land in the country by more than one-million feddan\u2014equivalent to\nabout one-million acres\u2014and to supply sufficient electricity not merely for Egypt\u2019s\nplanned industrial expansion but for all of the country\u2019s needs.31\nInternationally, Nasserism focused on securing complete Arab independence\nfrom the imperial powers. A moderate Arab nationalist, the Egyptian president did not\ninsist as the Ba\u2019athists did that the Arab world needed to come together into a single\npolitical union in order to end colonial dominance. Instead, he believed that the\nindependent Arab states could free themselves of Western control by following a shared\nforeign policy and by working collectively.32\n29 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 60\u201361.\n30 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 31\u201332; Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 111.\n31 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 157.\n32 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 31\u201332. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 439\nHis commitment to Arab nationalism led him to pursue a stridently independent,\nanti-imperialist foreign policy in the 1950s. Global in tone but regional in focus, it\nincluded four broad components. First, arguing that they were tools of continued\nimperial control, he vociferously criticized the continuation of Britain\u2019s defensive treaties\nwith Jordan and Iraq. Second, he steadfastly resisted American-sponsored efforts to\ndraw Egypt and the Arabs into the Cold War on the Western side through collective-\nsecurity alliances such as the Baghdad Pact that Iraq, Britain, Turkey, Iran, and\nPakistan established in early 1955. As he noted acidly, Israel and Britain\u2014the latter a\nsignatory to the Baghdad Pact\u2014were far-more immediate threats to the Arab people\nthan were the distant Soviets. Third, he called for the Arabs to use the Cold War to their\nadvantage through a policy he called Positive Neutrality, in which they would exploit\ntheir independence in the global struggle to cut favorable deals with both superpowers.\nFinally, to the consternation of US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (1888-1959),\nwho viewed the Cold War in starkly black-and-white terms, Nasser became a major\nleader in the emerging Non-Aligned Movement.33\nNasserism rapidly gained influence in the Arab world in the mid 1950s. Its\nsuccess stemmed from a combination of humble technological developments and the\nEgyptian leader\u2019s high-profile achievements in foreign relations. Diplomatically, Nasser\u2019s\nability to finally secure the evacuation of British troops from Egypt and his willingness to\nstand up to the dominant Western powers dramatically raised his stature both globally\nand within the Arab Middle East. Technologically, the widespread adoption of new, low-\ncost transistor radios permitted the Egyptian leader to bypass other Arab governments\nand to speak directly to their peoples via Radio Cairo\u2019s powerful transmitters. The new\nmedium made for a potent propaganda tool\u2014one that Nasser used with consummate\nskill to influence politics in other Arab states. In February 1955, for example, he used\nRadio Cairo to spark a coup in Syria that resulted in a neutralist, pro-Nasserist\ngovernment seizing power from one that had close ties with Iraq\u2019s conservative,\nHashimite monarchy. A concerted radio campaign later that year against the Baghdad\nPact not only compelled King Hussein to abandon plans to join the alliance, but also\nspurred Palestinians\u2014who constituted a majority of the population\u2014to hold violent\ndemonstrations against his government. Desperate to mollify the protestors so he could\nhang onto his throne, Hussein responded by dismissing the British officers who led the\nJordanian army and by agreeing to hold free elections in 1956\u2014a vote that a strongly\npro-Nasserist party handily won.34\nThe Suez Crisis, 1956\nNasserism reached dizzying heights of popularity as a result of one of the\ndefining international crises of the 1950s: the brief war between Egypt on the one hand\nand an alliance of Israel, Britain, and France on the other that occurred in late 1956.\nKnown as the Suez Crisis in the West and as the Tripartite Aggression in Egypt, the\nconflict was the culmination of the interplay between the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Cold\n33 Rogan, The Arabs, 289\u201391; Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 31\u201332.\n34 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 38\u201341. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 440\nWar, Arab nationalism, and decolonization. The last, desperate gasp of classical,\nnineteenth-century style imperialism in the region, the crisis would remake the\ngeostrategic outlines of the Middle East and would vault Nasser to a new level of\ninfluence that would solidify his status as the region\u2019s dominant figure for the next\ndecade.\nThe Gaza Raid, February 1955\nThe war had its origins in the ongoing dispute over infiltration into Israel. As we\nhave seen, Tel Aviv\u2019s commitment to the Iron Wall had led it to launch retaliatory raids\naimed both at deterring Palestinians from crossing the border and at encouraging the\nArab states\u2014including Egypt\u2014to curb infiltration. Unsurprisingly, those punitive actions\ndid not sit well with the nationalistic Free Officers. Furious about Tel Aviv\u2019s repeated\nviolations of Egyptian territory, they began sending small groups of soldiers into Israel in\nearly 1954 with orders to mount guerrilla attacks and to collect intelligence.35\nAdhering to Jabotinsky\u2019s Iron Wall policy, Tel Aviv was deeply committed to\nresponding swiftly and overwhelmingly to any incursion. Accordingly, after one such\noperation ended in the death of a cyclist in February 1955, the Israeli government\ndecided to retaliate by attacking an Egyptian military installation in the Gaza Strip.\nDesigned to embarrass Nasser by revealing Egypt\u2019s military weakness, the assault was\na stunning success. Commanded by Ariel Sharon, the force of 150 elite paratroopers\nthat executed the Gaza Raid killed thirty-seven Egyptian soldiers during the operation\nand left their base a smoldering ruin.36\nThe Czech Arms Deal, September 1955\nThe Gaza Raid infuriated Nasser. As Tel Aviv had intended, the attack\ndemonstrated that he lacked the power to defend Egypt and thus threatened to\nundermine his grip on power. Feeling that he had no choice but to respond, Nasser\nfollowed the Gaza Raid with two actions\u2014one designed to harm Israel and the other to\nredress the military balance. First, to strike back at the Jewish state, he tightened\nEgypt\u2019s four-year-old blockade of the Strait of Tiran that controls access to the Israeli\nport of Eilat that sits at the head of the Red Sea. In conjunction with the earlier closure\nof the Suez Canal to vessels bound for Israel, this action ensured that ships travelling\nfrom the Far East could only access the Jewish state by making a costly\ncircumnavigation of Africa. Second, he moved to modernize the Egyptian army by\nseeking to purchase advanced weapons abroad.37\nThis latter task appeared to be a daunting one. The Tripartite Agreement had\nmade arms purchases all-but impossible, and Washington, Nasser\u2019s first choice for\n35 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 131\u201337.\n36 Shlaim, 131\u201337; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict,\n1881-1920, 282\u201383.\n37 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 39\u201340. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 441\nweapons, had indicated that it would only consider making an exception for Egypt if it\njoined an anti-Soviet security treaty like the Baghdad Pact. Determined to pursue an\nindependent foreign policy, Nasser found that condition unacceptable and pressed on\nwith his search. He finally met with success behind the Iron Curtain. In September 1955,\nhe worked out an agreement with the Kremlin to purchase arms from the Soviet client\nstate of Czechoslovakia. It was a good deal for Nasser. Egypt would receive a massive\npackage of weapons over the following year including submarines, 230 T-34 tanks,\n200 armored personnel carriers, 50 Il-28 medium bombers, more than 100 advanced\nMiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets, and 600 artillery pieces. In exchange, Nasser agreed to\nprovide Czechoslovakia with 100,000 tons of cotton valued at $86 million.38\nIn three ways, the Czech arms agreement completely disarranged the strategic\nbalance in the Middle East. First, it effectively nullified the Tripartite Agreement that had\nbanned arms sales to the region. Indeed, France, which sought to curb Nasser\u2019s power\nin response to his support for Arab rebels in its Algerian colony, promptly followed the\ndeal by selling AMX-13 light tanks, artillery, and advanced Myst\u00e8re IV fighter jets to\nIsrael. Second, the agreement threatened the preponderant military position that Israel\nhad enjoyed since 1950. Once Egypt had integrated the arms into its military, it would\u2014\nto Tel Aviv\u2019s chagrin\u2014possess a military that was at least as powerful as the IDF.\nFinally, the deal dramatically altered the Cold War balance in the Middle East. With the\nconclusion of the agreement, the USSR had not merely leapfrogged over America\u2019s\nefforts to contain its influence in the region but had established close ties with the\nlargest and most important Arab state.39\nFinancing the Aswan High Dam\nUnsurprisingly, the Eisenhower administration found the Czech arms deal deeply\ntroubling. It feared that the agreement would, like the proverbial camel\u2019s nose under the\ntent, be the pivotal first step in a longer Soviet campaign of subversion that would end\nwith Egypt and perhaps other Arab states absorbed into the Eastern Bloc\u2014an outcome\nthat would shift the Cold War balance substantially in the USSR\u2019s favor. Determined to\nprevent Moscow from consolidating its influence in Egypt before it was too late, the\nadministration let Nasser know in December 1955 that it was prepared to help finance\nthe centerpiece of Egypt\u2019s economic development scheme: the Aswan High Dam. The\nAmerican proposal included a $200 million World Bank loan, as well as grants of $56\nmillion from the US and $14 million from Britain to help fund the first phase of the\nproject. Washington and London also pledged to provide loans for later phases of the\n38 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 190\u201391; Guy Ziv, \u201cShimon Peres and the French-\nIsraeli Alliance, 1954-9,\u201d Journal of Contemporary History 45, no. 2 (2010): 418; Little,\nAmerican Orientalism, 168.\n39 Khalidi, Sowing Crisis, 182; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab\nConflict, 1881-1920, 284. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 442\ndam\u2019s construction. In exchange, they insisted that Egypt forgo future arms purchases\nfrom the Eastern Bloc and that it open its economy to the West.40\nDespite what seemed like a promising offer, the deal gradually fell apart over the\nspring and early summer of 1956. Nasser had been eager to secure foreign aid to\nkickstart the dam\u2019s construction and was pleased when he first learned of the\nEisenhower administration\u2019s proposal. His enthusiasm cooled, however, when he\nbecame aware of the conditions that the Americans had attached to their offer; to\nNasser, they smacked of the colonialist limits that Britain had imposed on Egypt in the\nlate-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Accordingly, Nasser refrained from\nimmediately accepting the US offer; instead, in keeping with his policy of Positive\nNeutrality, he moved in the spring of 1956 to see if he could shop it to get a better deal\nfrom Moscow. That initiative appeared promising for a time; in the end, however, the\nUSSR was unable to provide a financing package as attractive as Washington\u2019s. As a\nresult, in July, Nasser instructed the Egyptian ambassador to the US to let Secretary of\nState Dulles know that Egypt had agreed to Washington\u2019s terms.41\nBy that point, however, the administration had decided to pull its funding offer. It\nmade this about face for three reasons. First, Dulles and President Dwight Eisenhower\n(r. 1953-1961) believed that the Egyptian government would need to impose crippling\nausterity measures to service the loans and worried that its people would come to hate\nthe countries from which Egypt had borrowed the funds. Better that they vent their\nspleens at the Soviet Union\u2014which Dulles and Eisenhower presumed would step in as\nthe project\u2019s primary foreign backer\u2014than at the US. Second, Washington had grown\nweary of Nasser\u2019s efforts to play both sides of the street. Dulles\u2019s Manichean belief that\nhumanity was locked in an epochal struggle between the Free World and the totalitarian\nSoviet Bloc accorded no legitimacy to fence sitters. Given this outlook, Nasser\u2019s\ncontinued efforts to play Washington off Moscow through Positive Neutrality and his\npropaganda broadcasts against pro-Western states rankled the secretary of state and\nsoured him on the Egyptian leader. Finally, in May 1956, Nasser extended formal\ndiplomatic recognition to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)\u2014a state that the US\nhad been working aggressively to keep isolated. That move was the final straw for\nDulles and Eisenhower. Furious with Nasser for breaking with the US on such an\nimportant issue, they decided to pull the plug on the aid package. Thus, on July 19, the\nsecretary of state informed the disappointed Egyptian ambassador that the US was\nwithdrawing its offer to finance the dam.42\n40 Little, American Orientalism, 168\u201369; Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of\na Nation State, 121.\n41 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 121.\n42 Steven Z.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 443\nNationalization of the Suez Canal, July 1956\nJust as Cold War considerations had shaped Washington\u2019s decision to withdraw\nits funding offer, so did Nasser\u2019s commitment to decolonization guide Egypt\u2019s response.\nThe Egyptian president was livid about the Eisenhower administration\u2019s decision to pull\nits funding offer. In his eyes, Washington\u2019s action was not merely a threat to the\nfoundation of Egypt\u2019s economic development program but an effort to embarrass and\nweaken his government. Nasser could not let the slight go without a reply. In short\norder, he came up with a response that was as bold as it was ingenious: he would\nnationalize the Western-owned and controlled Suez Canal and use the toll revenues it\ngenerated to finance the dam.43\nWith a dramatic flair, he announced his new plan in a live radio address just eight\ndays after Dulles had withdrawn the American financing offer. Upon hearing Nasser\nutter a codeword in his speech\u2014de Lesseps, the name of the French engineer who had\noverseen the construction of the waterway\u2014Egyptian forces took possession of the\ncanal and assumed control of its operations. The announcement thrilled people in Egypt\nand throughout the Developing World. To their delight, Nasser had not merely found a\nmeans of offsetting the loss of American funding for the Aswan High Dam but had done\nso in a way that directly challenged lingering Western imperialist influence in Egypt.44\nHis action had the added benefit of being perfectly legal. In taking control of the\nwaterway, Egypt promised to reimburse the Suez Canal Company\u2019s shareholders\nbased on the closing value of its stock the day Nasser had ordered the waterway\nnationalized. The seizure of the canal was thus consistent with international law.\nIndeed, as Egyptians delightedly pointed out in response to London\u2019s howls of protest, it\nwas no different than the Labor government\u2019s nationalization of Britain\u2019s railroads and\nsteel industry immediately following World War II.45\nThe Tripartite Aggression, October-November 1956\nLegal or not, Nasser\u2019s move elicited angry protests in Britain and France. On the\nsurface, Paris and London\u2019s concerns were narrowly economic in nature. With the\nBritish government owning 44 percent of the canal and French investors holding the\nbalance, both London and Paris were insistent that Egypt restore their property\u2014\npromises of reimbursement be damned. More fundamentally, however, French and\nBritish rage was a function of the symbolism of Egypt\u2019s seizure of the canal. Nasser, an\nupstart from the Developing World, was challenging what they saw as the natural order\nof things in which Western Great Powers dictated to the weak and not the reverse.\n43 Rogan, The Arabs, 299\u2013300.\n44 Rogan, 299\u2013300.\n45 Little, American Orientalism, 172. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 444\nAccordingly, determined to reassert their primacy, London and Paris committed\nthemselves to overturning his action\u2014peacefully or otherwise.46\nWashington took a more temperate approach to the crisis. Well aware of the\nserious damage that an attack on Egypt would do to the West\u2019s reputation among the\nworld\u2019s many recently decolonized people, the Eisenhower administration was\ndetermined to see the impasse resolved through diplomacy rather than force.\nAccordingly, the president and his advisors floated a succession of plans to settle it that\nrevolved around the idea of placing the canal under international control. In every case,\ntheir efforts proved to be stillborn. Committed to keeping the canal in Egyptian hands,\nNasser repeatedly rebuffed Washington\u2019s proposals and made emphatically clear that\nhis government would reject any solution that did not involve his country retaining\nuntrammeled sovereignty over the canal. Egypt\u2019s success in operating the waterway\nfollowing nationalization strengthened his hand\u2014and even raised questions about\nwhether Nasser\u2019s action constituted a problem. Indeed, as several American\ncongresspeople pointed out during a briefing on the situation, if the Egyptians could run\nthe canal and if they were willing to compensate the Suez Canal Company\u2019s\nshareholders, then there was no crisis to resolve.47\nEgypt\u2019s ability to operate the waterway may have satisfied American\ncongressional leaders, but it failed to meet French Prime Minister Guy Mollet\u2019s (r. 1956-\n1957) and British Prime Minister Anthony Eden\u2019s (r. 1955-1957) insistence that France\nand Britain regain control of the canal. Accordingly, ignoring Washington\u2019s clear desire\nto see the situation resolved peacefully, they began hatching a plot in conjunction with\nIsrael to regain control of the canal through force. Designed to disguise what was, at\nheart, an act of naked imperialist aggression, the scheme was as preposterous as it\nwas out of step with the times. It called for Israel\u2014which joined the conspiracy on\nOctober 21\u2014to set the plan in motion by first invading Egypt through the Sinai\nPeninsula. Next, pretending that they were impartial parties acting only to ensure that\ntrade could continue to flow through the canal, France and Britain would use the fighting\nas a pretext to issue an ultimatum demanding that both Israeli and Egyptian forces\nwithdraw immediately from the canal zone. When Nasser refused to comply\u2014as the\nconspirators knew he would\u2014French and British troops would then seize control of the\nwaterway.48\nLondon, Paris, and Tel Aviv were confident in this plan. They not only believed\nthat it would result in a quick victory, but that it would allow them to achieve all of their\ngoals vis-\u00e0-vis Egypt. Britain would regain control of the canal, France would end\nNasser\u2019s support for the Algerian rebels and recover its shareholders\u2019 property, and\nIsrael would destroy the military equipment that Nasser had acquired from\nCzechoslovakia before the Egyptian army could integrate it into its forces\u2014thus\n46 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 68; Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 47.\n47 Tony Judt, Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 (New York: Penguin Books,\n2005), 295; Little, American Orientalism, 173\u201374.\n48 Judt, Postwar, 295\u201396. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 445\nensuring the perpetuation of the IDF\u2019s regional military dominance. Finally, though they\nwere less certain of this outcome, they were also hopeful that a quick military victory\nover Egypt might prove so embarrassing for Nasser that the Egyptian people would\noverthrow him.49\nThe conspirators wasted no time in putting their scheme into action. As per the\nplan that they had drawn up, the war began with Israeli forces launching a surprise\ninvasion of the Sinai Peninsula. Well led and equipped, three columns of IDF troops\nquickly steamrolled their way through Egypt\u2019s ill-prepared defenses on October 29 and\nbegan to advance rapidly westward toward the canal. A fourth column swung south to\ntake control of Sharm al-Shaykh, the town that commanded the Strait of Tiran. London\nand Paris issued their ultimatum the next day. When Egypt refused to comply by the\ndeadline they had set, they joined the war\u2014first by bombing Egyptian airbases and\nthen, on November 5, by dropping paratroopers in the canal zone. The next day, Royal\nMarines stormed ashore near the northern entrance of the waterway. Brushing aside\nEgyptian forces, they quickly seized control of the city of Port Said.50\nDespite this military success, however, it had already become quite clear that the\npolitical side of the operation was not unfolding in accordance with the conspirator\u2019s\nplan. From the very start, the entire world had seen right through London and Paris\u2019s\nludicrous pretense that they were acting for the good of the international community and\nquickly intuited the broad outlines of the conspiracy. As a result, the parties to the\ncollusion found themselves squeezed from all quarters. Wildly inconsistent with\ndecolonizing spirit of the times, their imperialistic actions faced near-universal\ncondemnation in the UN General Assembly and in the world press. Worse, they\nconfronted economically devastating fuel shortages thanks to concerted Arab actions.\nNot only did Egypt block the flow of oil through the canal by scuttling cement-filled ships\nin it, but the Syrian government responded to the war by cutting the pipeline that\nconnected the oil fields of Iraq to the terminals on the Mediterranean. As a result, the\nflow of oil to Europe slowed to a trickle. Making matters all-the grimmer, the Kremlin\npiled on by issuing a statement on November 5 threatening to launch rockets on Paris\nand London if France and Britain did not cease their aggression.51\nFar more important, however, was the economic and diplomatic pressure that\nthey faced from across the Atlantic. Eisenhower was apoplectic with Eden, Mollet, and\nBen Gurion for organizing the attack on Egypt. He resented that they had acted without\nWashington\u2019s approval, expressed concern that their invasion might fatally damage the\nWest\u2019s reputation in the Arab world, and fumed that they had undertaken such a shabby\nand transparent act of imperialism so close to the American presidential election. Above\nall, Eisenhower was furious that the attack had permitted Moscow to crush the\n49 Donald Neff, Warriors at Suez: Eisenhower Takes America into the Middle East (New\nYork: The Linden Press, 1981), 335\u201336; Judt, Postwar, 295\u201396.\n50 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 291\u201397.\n51 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 52\u201353. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 446\nHungarian Revolution\u2014a concurrent uprising aimed at ending Soviet control of\nHungary\u2014without suffering significant damage to its international reputation.52\nEisenhower moved quickly to ratchet up the pressure on Tel Aviv, Paris, and\nLondon. On the diplomatic front, he secured passage of a UN resolution regarding the\nSuez Crisis on November 2. It called for an immediate ceasefire, the withdrawal of\nFrench, British, and Israeli troops from Egypt, and the Installation of United Nations\nEmergency Force (UNEF) peacekeepers in the Sinai. Concurrently, he took two\neconomic actions that grievously imperiled France and, especially, Britain. First, he\naccelerated a devastating war-induced run on Britain\u2019s currency by instructing the\nFederal Reserve Board to dump America\u2019s holding of pounds and by blocking London\u2019s\nattempt to secure an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nSecond, the president barred efforts to redirect oil from the Western Hemisphere to\nFrance and Britain as part of an effort to offset the loss of Middle Eastern petroleum. As\nhe told an aide, he was leaving Paris and London to \u201c\u2018boil in their own oil\u2019\u201d until they\ncame to their senses.53\nFaced with this pressure, France and Britain quickly buckled. On November 6,\nthey brought the war to a speedy conclusion by agreeing to the terms of the UN\nceasefire. Thanks to continuing American pressure, they followed by quickly\nwithdrawing their troops from Egypt. Israel was more reluctant to pull out but finally\nagreed to remove the last of its soldiers from the Sinai in March 1957. Immediately after\ntheir withdrawal, UNEF peacekeepers took up positions at Sharm al-Shaykh and along\nthe Egyptian side of the frontier with Israel to ensure against the outbreak of a new\nconflict.54\nConsequences\nMomentous in significance, the Suez Crisis fundamentally restructured the power\ndynamics of the Middle East. The biggest winner by far was Nasser. Though Egypt had\nsuffered a clear military defeat, his diplomatic triumph over the despised imperial\npowers and the hated Israelis massively raised his stature in the Arab world and\ninstantly turned him into the leader of the anti-Zionist cause. Israel also strengthened its\nposition as a result of the war. It is true that Washington had compelled Tel Aviv to yield\nthe territory its army had conquered in the Sinai. However, the stationing of UNEF\ntroops at Sharm al-Shaykh opened the Gulf of Aqaba to Israel-bound shipping while the\nsuccess of its soldiers further enhanced the IDF\u2019s military reputation. Washington, too,\nemerged in a stronger position. Thanks to its support of Egypt, the US gained prestige\nin the Arab world\u2014at least for a time. The Kremlin saw its reputation rise much further,\n52 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 259.\n53 Quote from George C.

Its promise in October 1958 to provide critical funding for the Aswan High\nDam and, more importantly, the widespread belief in the Middle East that Moscow\u2019s\nultimatum to France and Britain had been decisive in bringing the war to a swift\nconclusion had substantially raised its standing with people throughout the Arab world.55\nIn contrast, Paris and, especially, London emerged from the crisis the clear\nlosers. The conflict demolished their reputations in the region, hastened Britain\u2019s\ndeparture from the Middle East, and grievously undermined the position of Arab states\nlike Iraq that continued to maintain close ties with London. More broadly, Suez marked\nthe swan song of London\u2019s pretensions as a global imperial power. As the Sunday\nTimes later wrote, Anthony Eden had been \u201c\u2018the last prime minister to believe Britain\nwas a great power and the first to confront a crisis which proved beyond doubt that she\nwas not.\u2019\u201d56\nThe Eisenhower Doctrine\nThe US responded aggressively to the new power dynamic that existed in the\nMiddle East following the Suez Crisis. Fearing that the sudden decline of British\ninfluence would create a vacuum that the USSR could fill, the president announced a\nnew policy toward the region, the Eisenhower Doctrine, in an address to congress in\nJanuary 1957. Echoing the language of the Truman Doctrine, it declared that the United\nStates would provide military and economic aid to Middle Eastern countries that faced\n\u201covert armed aggression from any nation controlled by International Communism\u201d and\nwould, if necessary, even commit its forces to their defense.57\nDespite the rhetorical emphasis on Marxism, Moscow was not the main focus of\nthe Eisenhower Doctrine. Instead, as the historian Salim Yaqub has demonstrated,\nEisenhower and Dulles designed the new policy primarily to contain the radical Arab\nnationalism that Nasser championed. In their estimation, the Egyptian president\u2019s\npromotion of Positive Neutrality made him an unwitting pawn whose actions threatened\nto give the USSR a backdoor way into the Middle East. The administration was\nconfident that the conservative Arab states were capable of checking Nasser\u2019s\nambitions in the region; however, it also believed that those states would not act directly\nagainst such a powerful and popular figure unless they enjoyed clear American backing.\nAccordingly, the administration devised the Eisenhower Doctrine as a way of assuring\nthe conservative Arab regimes that they would have the support of the United States in\nany conflict with Nasser.58\n55 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 30\u201331; Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 63\u2013\n64.\n56 Avi Shlaim, War and Peace in the Middle East: A Concise History, Revised and\nUpdated, Revised ed. edition (New York: Penguin Books, 1994), 29\u201331.\n57 Dwight Eisenhower, \u201cThe Eisenhower Doctrine, January 5, 1957,\u201d accessed March\n28, 2022, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1957eisenhowerdoctrine.asp.\n58 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 1\u20132. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 448\nApproved by congress in March 1957, the Eisenhower Doctrine appeared to pay\nimmediate dividends. Strengthened by the prospect of American assistance, Jordan\u2019s\nKing Hussein purged his government of Nasserists in April and successfully stared\ndown a challenge by insubordinate pan-Arabist army officers. Buttressed by American\naid money and the deployment of the Sixth Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean, he then\nsolidified his grip on power by cracking down on the Nasserist opposition and by\nimposing martial law. Events in Lebanon reinforced the perception that the doctrine was\na success. With clandestinely provided American funds, pro-Western Maronite\nPresident Camille Chamoun (r. 1952-1958) orchestrated a decisive electoral victory\nover the Nasserist United National Front (UNF) opposition\u2014which had itself received\ncovert aid from Egypt\u2014in parliamentary elections held in June. Thus, by the early\nsummer of 1957, the Eisenhower Doctrine seemed to be well on its way to achieving its\npurpose of containing Nasserism.59\nThe Lebanese elections marked the policy\u2019s high point, however. For the next\ntwelve months, Washington\u2019s effort to limit or rollback Nasserism failed completely\u2014\nmost notably, in Syria. That country had become more and more concerning for the\nEisenhower administration over the course of 1957. Two issues stood out. First,\nMoscow\u2019s influence in Damascus had grown dramatically thanks to its agreement early\nthat year to provide Soviet military hardware and development loans in exchange for\nSyrian wheat. Second, exploiting the post-Suez rise in anti-Western sentiment, the\nBa\u2019ath Party and Syrian Communist Party (SCP) had succeeded in compelling the\ngovernment to agree to increase the number of leftists in the cabinet in December\n1957\u2014a change in the political balance that suggested that the Soviet Union was\npoised to assume a dominant position in Damascus.60\nDetermined to prevent Syrian pan-Arabists from delivering their country to\nMoscow, American officials responded by sponsoring a pro-Western coup and by\nprodding the conservative Arab regimes to put diplomatic pressure on Damascus.\nBegun with high hopes, these efforts went nowhere. The coup plot quickly fizzled thanks\nto the swift actions of the very capable head of the Syrian security service, Abd al-\nHamid Sarraj (1925-2013). Meanwhile, the conservative Arab states\u2019 willingness to\nsupport the administration\u2019s hardline approach collapsed after Nasser launched a\nblistering, radio-based propaganda campaign against them that resonated with their\npeople and thus threatened their grip on power. Seeking to end the Egyptian leader\u2019s\nattacks, they soon began to urge Washington to moderate its position toward\nDamascus. Lacking either supportive regional allies or proxies inside Syria, the\nadministration had no choice but to comply. Thus, by the end of 1957, the once\npromising Eisenhower Doctrine lay in tatters.61\n59 Yaqub, 119\u201345.\n60 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 268\u201376.\n61 Wilford, 268\u201376. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 449\nNasserism at High Tide, 1958-1961\nBy 1958, Nasser\u2019s popularity had reached dizzying heights. As we have seen, his\nsuccess in the Suez Crisis had dramatically raised his stature and had rendered him the\nunquestioned leader of the anti-Zionist cause. His subsequent ability to intimidate the\nconservative Arab states during the Syria crisis further enhanced his standing and made\nclear that he enjoyed enormous political influence in the Arab world. By 1958, as a\nresult Nasser bestrode the Arab Middle East like a colossus\u2014a figure of enormous\npower who appeared, for a time at least, ready to bring all the Arabs together under his\nrule in a unified state.\nThe United Arab Republic\nThat expectation stemmed from a stunning turn of events in early 1958: the\npolitical merger of Egypt and Syria. While Cairo would ultimately dominate the union,\nunification had its genesis in the aspirations of the Syrian Ba\u2019ath Party. During the mid-\n1950s, it had entered into a mutually beneficial marriage of convenience with the rival\nSCP that had allowed the two comparatively small parties to assume dominant positions\nin the government. To the Ba\u2019athists\u2019 alarm, however, the country\u2019s increasingly close\nrelationship with Moscow had boosted the SCP\u2019s standing to such a degree that it\nappeared likely that the communists would soon eclipse the Ba\u2019ath and assume sole\ncontrol of the state. Desperate, party leaders concluded that the only way that they\ncould forestall that outcome was by securing the political merger of Syria and Egypt.\nTalk turned into action in early 1958 thanks to a precipitate move by a cabal of Ba\u2019athist\narmy officers. Acting without prior approval, a group of them\u2014later joined by Ba\u2019ath\nParty cofounder Salah al-Din al-Bitar\u2014travelled to Egypt and pitched Nasser on the\nidea of unifying their states under his rule.62\nThe Egyptian leader initially expressed skepticism. A moderate Arab nationalist,\nhe had long interpreted pan-Arabism to mean that the Arab states would closely\ncoordinate their foreign policies rather than formally join together in a political union. He\nwas also leery of taking on the challenges intrinsic in running a country that was not\nterritorially contiguous, and he blanched at the idea of becoming involved in Syria\u2019s\nbyzantine political arena. At the same time, however, he grasped that union would\nsubstantially strengthen his position in the Arab world and afford him greater clout on\nthe global stage. He consequently set aside his doubts and agreed to the proposal\nsubject to three conditions: Syria\u2019s political parties had to immediately dissolve, its\nmilitary officers needed to abandon any involvement in politics, and its state institutions\nhad to be absorbed into\u2014and thus subordinated to\u2014Egypt\u2019s existing government. The\nexpansiveness of Nasser\u2019s terms surprised the Ba\u2019athists but did not faze them.\nConfident that their organizational and ideological sophistication would allow them to\ndominate the unified government, they accepted Nasser\u2019s conditions with little debate.\n62 Rogan, The Arabs, 304\u20136. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 450\nAs a result, on February 1, 1958, Nasser proclaimed that Egypt and Syria had joined\ntogether to form a new state: the United Arab Republic (UAR).63\nThe union of Egypt and Syria seemed to mark a watershed moment in the region\nevery bit as significant as the Suez Crisis or the establishment of Israel. To Arab\nnationalists, the erasure of the borders that the European powers had imposed at the\nconclusion of World War I heralded nothing less than the end of imperial dominance\nand the beginning of an Arab revival. It was a heady moment\u2014one that emboldened\npan-Arabists throughout the region and raised expectations even in the conservative\nGulf monarchies that the entire Arab world would imminently enter the union.64\nThe pressure to join fell most heavily on Lebanon and, especially, Jordan.\nExcited by the merger of Syria and Egypt, many Jordanians joined opposition groups to\ndemand that King Hussein abdicate as the first step in a process that would end with\ntheir country joining the UAR. This pressure was substantial and, for a time, seemed\nlikely to sweep the Jordanian king from power. Hussein was not prepared to go quietly,\nhowever. Instead, taking advantage of the fact that he had solidified his control of the\nmilitary the prior year, he responded with a proposal that used the language of unity and\nnationalism to fortify the Hashimite position. It called for Jordan and Iraq to come\ntogether in a federal union wherein each would continue to enjoy domestic autonomy\nbut would fully integrate their militaries and would pursue a joint foreign policy. Equally\nconcerned about the danger of Nasserism, Faysal II\u2019s government was receptive.\nAccordingly, just thirteen days after Syria and Egypt had merged, the two Hashimite\nkingdoms announced the birth of a rival superstate, the Arab Union.65\nIn Lebanon, meanwhile, the establishment of the UAR appeared not only to have\nreinvigorated the opposition to Camille Chamoun, but to have created the expectation\nthat the country would soon join Nasser\u2019s superstate. For a time, in fact, the question of\nwhether Lebanon should merge with the UAR seemed to have left the country teetering\non the edge of civil war between the president\u2019s mostly Christian, pro-Western\nsupporters and the largely Sunni Nasserists. Ultimately, however, while many people in\nLebanon were enthusiastic about the idea of union, the question of whether the country\nwould join the UAR was of only secondary importance in spurring the political crisis that\ngripped Lebanon in 1958. Far more critical in dividing the country was President Camille\nChamoun\u2019s effort to remain in power beyond his constitutionally limited six-year term.\nIndeed, the country remained tense but peaceful in the months following the creation of\nthe UAR and only descended into crisis when Chamoun made clear in May 1958 that\nhe intended to have the constitution amended to permit him to serve a second term.66\n63 Rogan, 306\u20138.\n64 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 189.\n65 Charles Tripp, A History of Iraq (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002),\n145\u201346.\n66 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 192\u201396, 206\u201311. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 451\nThe Iraqi Coup, July 1958\nUltimately, the state most dramatically affected by the merger of Syria and Egypt\nwas Iraq. The announcement of the establishment of the UAR had electrified Iraqis\nopposed to the old order and led many to conclude that their country\u2019s future lay in\njoining Nasser\u2019s superstate. Such sentiments were particularly prominent among a\ngroup of pro-Nasserist army officers who had earlier formed a secret organization called\nthe Free Officers. Excited about the pan-Arabist implications of the UAR, they began\nplotting a coup in 1958 under the leadership of General Abd al-Karim Qasim (r. 1958-\n1963) and Colonel Abd al-Salam Arif (r. 1963-1966) aimed at ending the monarchy and\nfinally freeing Iraq of Western dominance.67\nTheir chance came in July 1958. Taking advantage of the movement of an\ninfantry brigade through the capital\u2014ordered, ironically, for the purpose of deterring a\nrumored coup against Hussein \u2014the Free Officers made their move. In a well-planned\noperation, they seized government buildings, the palace, and, critically, the radio\nstation, from which Arif declared the establishment of a republic and urged people to\ntake to the streets to forestall any counterrevolutionary actions. The subsequent, rapid\ndestruction of the old order proved to be anarchic and bloody. The soldiers sent to\ndetain the king instead massacred the royal family and hastily buried them in shallow\ngraves on the palace grounds. The savvy Nuri Said managed to avoid capture for a time\nbut he, too, was executed after he was discovered trying to slip out of Baghdad\ndisguised as a woman. Meanwhile, the street protests that Arif had called for to protect\nthe new government rapidly got out of hand. Unleashing three decades of pent-up fury,\nthe mob sought vengeance in an orgy of violence against anything and anyone\nassociated with the previous regime. They tore down a statue of Faysal I (r. 1921-1933),\ntorched the British Chancery, dug up and mutilated the body of the former regent, Abd\nil-Alah (1913-1958), and killed a number of officials by dragging them to death behind\ncars.68\nIt was a grim day for Washington. Qasim and the other coup plotters followed the\nrevolution by immediately withdrawing Iraq from the Baghdad Pact. Worse, not long\nafter, they established close relations with the USSR. In other words, the coup had not\nonly thoroughly gutted the alliance system that Eisenhower and Dulles had so carefully\nconstructed for the purpose of preventing Moscow from extending its power into the\nMiddle East but had also given the Soviets immediate influence over an important Arab\nstate.69\n67 Phebe Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, Second Edition (Boulder: Routledge, 2004),\n83\u201384.\n68 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 146\u201350.\n69 Rogan, The Arabs, 312\u201314. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 452\n1958 Lebanese and Jordanian Crises\nPanic gripped the leaders of the conservative Arab regimes following the Iraq\ncoup. Blaming the tumultuous events on Nasser, they frantically called on the Western\nstates to protect their governments lest they be the next to fall. Jordan was the most\nvulnerable of the conservative states. Keenly aware of his country\u2019s exposure, King\nHussein immediately requested the deployment of Western troops to his capital to\nprotect his government. London was receptive. Eager to prevent Nasserism from\nsweeping through the entire Middle East, it quickly acceded to his request. As a result,\nthe first of 3,700 British paratroopers began arriving on July 17.70\nChamoun also demanded Western intervention. Claiming that Nasser would\nfollow the Iraq coup by seeking to subvert his government, he invoked the Eisenhower\nDoctrine just hours after he learned of the events in Baghdad and requested the\nimmediate deployment of US troops to his country. Chamoun\u2019s appeal put the\nadministration in a difficult position. By that point, the American president and his\nadvisors had long since determined that the 1957 Lebanese political crisis had been the\nproduct of confessional divisions and Chamoun\u2019s overweening ambitions rather than\nNasser\u2019s interference and were leery of once more becoming involved in the country\u2019s\ninternal affairs. As important, having concluded from the Syria debacle that the\nEisenhower Doctrine had failed to achieve its goals, the administration had quietly\nbegun to pursue a policy of rapprochement toward the Egyptian leader. Nonetheless,\nthe day after the Iraq coup, it acceded to Chamoun\u2019s request and began landing a force\nin Lebanon that eventually numbered more than 15,000 soldiers.71\nWhat explains Eisenhower\u2019s apparent change of heart? Why did he agree to\nChamoun\u2019s request? According to the historian Douglas Little, the driving force behind\nthe president\u2019s decision to deploy troops was his desire to uphold American credibility.\nIn Little\u2019s view, Eisenhower believed that the US had no choice but to act if it wished to\nmaintain its standing in the region. As the president reasoned, if Washington failed to\nanswer Chamoun\u2019s request for help, friendly governments in the Middle East would first\nbegin to doubt Washington\u2019s commitment and then come to terms with Nasser to the\ndetriment of Western interests. Thus, regardless of Chamoun\u2019s intent, the president felt\nhe had to act.72\nIn the end, the intervention had at best equivocal results for the US. On the\npositive side, Washington managed to secure a promise from Nasser to respect\nJordanian and Lebanese independence in exchange for the withdrawal of British and\nAmerican troops from those states. It also brokered a deal in Lebanon that resulted in\nthe election of the popular head of the army, the Maronite General Fuad Shihab\n(r. 1958-1964), to the presidency at the end of Chamoun\u2019s term. Respected by all the\nfactions, he pursued a policy of reconciliation and moderation that soon restored\n70 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 222, 231.\n71 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 286\u201387.\n72 Little, American Orientalism, 134\u201335. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 453\norder\u2014thus permitting Eisenhower to honor his deal with Nasser and withdraw\nAmerican troops. At the same time, however, the intervention also imposed significant\ncosts on Washington. Most notably, having more-than-a whiff of neo-colonialism to it,\nthe deployment had stripped away any residual goodwill that the United States had\nearned in the Arab world as a result of its support for Nasser during the Suez Crisis.73\nKarim Qasim\nThe events in Jordan and Lebanon aside, Nasserism seemed unstoppable in the\nsummer of 1958. Far more important, the coup in Iraq seemed to suggest not only that\nNasserism was the wave of the future, but that Iraq\u2019s territory, its substantial population\nand, most critically, its enormous oil wealth would soon be under the Egyptian leader\u2019s\ncontrol. Few doubted this outcome. The US, the Soviet Union, the European states, and\nArab nationalists alike agreed that it was only a matter of time before the Iraqi Free\nOfficers petitioned Cairo to add Iraq to the UAR. The future appeared bright indeed for\nNasser.74\nThat assessment soon proved to be off the mark. Despite the widespread belief\nthat union was inevitable, the new government in Baghdad ultimately chose not to join\nthe UAR. That decision reflected Qasim\u2019s victory in an internal dispute with Arif in the\nweeks immediately following the coup. On one level, the conflict between them was a\nsimple power struggle over which man would rule. On another, however, it reflected a\nlarger debate over Iraq\u2019s national identity\u2014one that revolved around the question of\nwhether it should remain an independent, multi-ethnic, multi-confessional country, or\nwhether it should instead be a component of a larger, progressive, secular-but-\npredominantly Sunni Arab state. Arif favored the latter position, and, with the support of\nIraq\u2019s Ba\u2019athists, Arab nationalists, and many Sunni Arabs, pressed for the country to\nimmediately join the UAR. Qasim disagreed. Uninterested in ceding national\nsovereignty or Iraq\u2019s ample oil revenue to Egypt, he countered by promoting an \u201c\u2018Iraq\nfirst\u2019\u201d policy that enjoyed the support of heretofore marginalized groups such as the Shi\u02bfi\nand Kurdish communities as well as the Iraq Communist Party (ICP), which was leery\nthat Nasser would compel them to disband. With their backing, Qasim was able to force\nArif out of the government in late 1958 after which he consolidated his position by\npurging Ba\u2019athists and pan-Arabists. Furious, Nasser responded by launching a\nvigorous propaganda campaign against Qasim and by seeking to isolate Iraq in the\nArab world. Aware that the ICP was a key pillar of Qasim\u2019s rule, he also vented his\nfrustration by clamping down on the communist party in Egypt.75\nNasser did manage to find a silver lining in his defeat. A savvy political strategist,\nhe believed that he could use the crackdown on the communists to improve relations\nwith the US and to secure much-needed American food aid. He was correct on both\n73 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 244\u201345, 251\u201353; Wilford, America\u2019s Great\nGame, 288.\n74 Little, American Orientalism, 202.\n75 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 151\u201354. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 454\ncounts. Having already decided to seek a rapprochement with Nasser following the\nfailure of the Eisenhower Doctrine, the administration found the Egyptian leader\u2019s move\nagainst the communists encouraging. It consequently agreed to permit Cairo to\npurchase $110 million worth of wheat through the PL-480 \u201cFood for Peace\u201d program. It\nwas a good deal for Nasser. Payable in UAR pounds rather than in scarce hard\ncurrency, the agreement provided Egypt with much-needed aid at a heavily discounted\nprice.76\nNasser was nevertheless right to be upset about Qasim\u2019s decision to stay out of\nthe UAR. Iraq\u2019s refusal to join the union was a major diplomatic defeat for him and the\nlarger Nasserist movement he led. It demoralized nationalists throughout the region,\nundermined the Egyptian leader\u2019s claim to speak for all Arabs, and strongly suggested\nthat pan-Arabism was not, in fact, the wave of the future. In sum, though Nasserism\nremained a powerful force in the Arab world after 1958, the wind had come out of its\nsails and few continued to view Arab unification as inevitable.77\nDemise of the UAR\nDespite these diminished expectations, most observers were still shocked when\nSyria, in a sudden move, seceded from the UAR in September 1961. Its departure was\nthe result of growing disenchantment in Damascus with the union. As we saw, despite\nNasser\u2019s insistence that Egyptians would control the upper echelon of the government,\nthe Ba\u2019athists had wagered in 1958 that they would be able to outmaneuver their less-\nideologically sophisticated partners and would thus assume a dominant voice in the\nUAR. That bet proved to be a bad one. Instead of manipulating officials in Cairo, they\nfound themselves unhappily shunted to the side and thoroughly dominated by the\nimperious Egyptians. Syrian landlords and businesspeople similarly chafed under\nNasserist rule. They railed against the imposition of a land-reform program that Cairo\nhad initiated in 1958 and\u2014capitalist to the core\u2014fumed at the Egyptian government\u2019s\nheavy-handed intervention in the economy.78\nThe UAR collapsed under the weight of these differences in the summer of 1961.\nTwo events led to the final break. First, the promulgation of the July Laws\u2014a sweeping\nnew package of economic regulations that called for the nationalization of most\nbusinesses\u2014destroyed what little enthusiasm for union remained among Syria\u2019s\ninfluential landowner and business classes. Second, Cairo\u2019s decision to force Sarraj\nfrom his post as chief of intelligence in Syria infuriated many Syrian military leaders. In\nfact, this move was the final straw for Syria\u2019s Ba\u2019athist army officers. Just a week after\nSarraj stepped down, they responded with a coup that resulted in Syria immediately\nseceding from the UAR. Caught off guard, an initially furious Nasser vowed to compel\nSyria to return to the union. Cooler heads soon prevailed, however. Realizing that he\ncould not regain control of Syria if its military opposed him, he abandoned the effort and\n76 Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 44; Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 257\u201358.\n77 Rogan, The Arabs, 316\u201317.\n78 Rogan, 320. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 455\nagreed to a peaceful separation. Egypt formally retained the UAR name until 1971 and\nthe two states periodically entered into perfunctory reunification talks, but, from that\npoint forward, the united Arab state\u2014the cherished dream of Arab nationalists\u2014was\ndead.79\nPolitical, Social, and Economic Development, 1958-1967\nWhile the officers who dominated Egypt, Syria, and Iraq in the late 1950s and\n1960s gave a great deal of attention to foreign relations, they by no means neglected\ndomestic concerns. On the contrary, seeking both to improve the lot of the impoverished\nmasses and to consolidate their grip on political power, they promoted a populist, state-\ncentered economic vision in all three states. Though the specifics differed from country\nto country, the broad outline of their efforts were remarkably similar. In each state, the\nofficers sought to foster rapid economic growth, to distribute income more equitably,\nand to establish political institutions designed to mobilize popular support behind the\ngovernment. For a time, their efforts seemed to be quite successful.\nEgypt: Arab Socialism\nEgypt had already taken tentative steps toward a more state-centered economy\nin the years following the Free Officers\u2019 coup. As we have seen, its government had\nadopted an economic development model based loosely on Mustafa Kemal\u2019s ISI system\nand had implemented a series of socio-economic changes such as land reform aimed at\nimproving life for the poorest Egyptians. Egypt\u2019s shift to a state-led economic model\naccelerated dramatically in the early 1960s when it adopted a new program dubbed\nArab Socialism. Unsurprisingly, Nasser was the driving force behind this change.\nIncreasingly influenced by Soviet economic ideas, he believed that a system of central\nplanning was the only way that Egypt could industrialize rapidly and equitably.80\nThe transition to Arab Socialism took place with great speed in the early 1960s.\nNasser initiated the process at the start of the decade when he ordered the\nnationalization of the largest banks and decreed the start of Egypt\u2019s first Five Year Plan\n(1960-1964). He went substantially further the following year when he promulgated the\nJuly Laws. Sweeping in extent, they nationalized many industries including insurance,\ntextiles, steel production, and shipping, and resulted in the government taking a 10-50\npercent stake in nearly all other firms. The July Laws also instituted a minimum wage,\ncapped the salaries of highly compensated individuals, adopted a highly progressive tax\nregime that set the top marginal rate at a confiscatory 90 percent, and effected a far-\nreaching land-reform program that limited individuals to no more than 100 feddans\u2014a\nlittle more than 100 acres\u2014and redistributed the excess property to landless\npeasants.81\n79 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 76.\n80 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 168\u201369.\n81 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 135\u201336. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 456\nNasser completed the move to Arab Socialism in 1964. That year, the state\ndramatically expanded the public educational system in order to ensure that the country\nhad the trained workers needed to manage its ongoing industrial development; as a\nresult, the share of the population that held a college degree began to increase\nsubstantially. More importantly, the Egyptian president also issued a new decree in\n1964 that resulted in the nationalization of nearly all of the firms over which the\ngovernment had assumed partial ownership three years earlier.82\nConcurrently, Nasser orchestrated a series of changes designed both to radically\nrestructure Egyptian society and to solidify his control of the country\u2019s people. He first\nreorganized the National Union into the Arab Socialist Union (ASU) and used it to\nmobilize the people in support of the regime and its economic program. To ensure\nagainst the emergence of organized criticism of the government and its economic\npolicies, he followed by having the state assume control over previously autonomous\ngroups such as labor unions, student organizations, and universities. Finally, he\noversaw the issuance of a new National Charter in 1962 that formalized Egypt\u2019s\ncommitment to Arab Socialism and radical change. It was a truly revolutionary\ndocument. Most notably, it called for women to enjoy equal rights and acknowledged for\nthe first time the need for contraception to help control the country\u2019s rapidly growing\npopulation.83\nFor some time, Nasser\u2019s economic program appeared to be quite successful.\nWorkers enjoyed enhanced benefits, many peasants acquired land, and the distribution\nof income became increasingly equitable. Even the middle class benefited from the shift\nto Arab Socialism. While some blanched at the adoption of a state-centered\ndevelopment scheme, most were delighted when Nasser had guaranteed work for the\nmiddle class by decreeing in 1962 that all university graduates who could not find jobs\non their own would be given government employment.84\nEconomic and demographic data sustained the belief that Arab Socialism was a\nsuccess. Gross domestic product rose at an impressive clip during the early and mid\n1960s, for example, while Egypt\u2019s average life expectancy increased by more than three\nyears between 1954 and 1969. It is true that per capita income only rose by 2 percent a\nyear during the decade thanks largely to Egypt\u2019s robust population growth. It was also\nthe case that many landlords and members of the bourgeoisie had left Egypt in\nresponse to the imposition of Arab Socialism\u2014an emigration that deprived it of capital\nand entrepreneurs. Still, on balance, the country appeared to be much better off.\nNasser, it seemed, could justifiably take pride in having quickly improved Egypt\u2019s\neconomy.85\n82 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 77\u201378; Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of\na Nation State, 135\u201336.\n83 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 171\u201372; Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 78\u201382.\n84 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 71\u201372.\n85 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 136\u201337. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 457\nIraq\u2014Political Instability and Autocracy\nIn the broadest sense, Iraq\u2019s social, political, and economic development\nbetween 1958 and 1967 paralleled the course that Nasser had charted. Like Egypt, Iraq\nhad a populist, if undemocratic, military-dominated regime. Its government also\npromoted an Egyptian-style, state-centered development model and took steps to break\nthe power of the established elite in order to quickly achieve a more equitable\ndistribution of income. In several critical ways, however, Iraq\u2019s experience in the late\n1950s and 1960s differed substantially from Egypt\u2019s\u2014most notably in terms of its\npolitical instability and in its failure to develop meaningful connections between the\npeople and the state.\nIraq\u2019s difficult history after 1958 reflected the country\u2019s awkward early years.\nStitched together to serve British interests, it emerged from the mandatory period with a\nweak civic-political culture, a powerful, coercive state, and a political elite that ruled on\nthe basis of patronage and personal ties rather than popular support. The subsequent\nbrief dominance in the 1930s of Sunni officers who had absorbed the late Ottoman\nEmpire\u2019s authoritarian, militarized conception of the state only served to reinforce and\ninstitutionalize that political system. The result would be the hardening of ethnoreligious\nfault lines and the institutionalization of a state that conferred near-unchecked powers of\ncoercion and patronage upon those who controlled it\u2014a legacy that ensured that the\ncountry\u2019s post-coup governments would focus far-more on buttressing the state that\ngranted them such overwhelming authority than on reforming society.86\nQasim\u2019s government certainly reflected and perpetuated the pattern that had\nbeen established during the mandate and the monarchy. That it did so marked a\nsignificant move away from the public declarations that the Free Officers had made\nimmediately following the coup. At that time, the country\u2019s new leaders had declared\ntheir intention to liberalize Iraq. They promised to end the former government\u2019s\ncorruption and exploitation, to democratize the country both politically and economically,\nand to grant rights to minority groups\u2014particularly the Kurds. Unsurprisingly, as a\nresult, many of the Free Officers\u2019 civilian allies and supporters anticipated that the coup\nwould mark a fundamental turning point for Iraq\u2014one that would result in both state and\nsociety being restructured along genuinely liberal lines.87\nThey were to be bitterly disappointed. Intoxicated by the enormous power that he\nhad inherited from the Hashimite government, Qasim instead focused on quickly\nconsolidating power in his hands. He did so with great skill. He first used his personal\nties to other figures in the military and the enormous patronage powers that the state\nafforded him to cement his control of the officer corps. Next, he took advantage of\nfighting between communist party irregulars and government troops in Mosul in March\n1959 to institute a sweeping purge of army officers and civilian administration who might\noppose him. Shortly after, he used ICP demonstrations in Kirkuk that had devolved into\n86 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 148\u201349, 152.\n87 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 83\u201384; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 148. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 458\nviolence between the communists and the city\u2019s more conservative, middle- and upper-\nclass Turkoman people as a pretext to rein in the now-emboldened party. Finally, in\nOctober 1959, he used a failed assassination attempt against him to justify crushing\nIraq\u2019s small Ba\u2019athist party.88\nQasim\u2019s focus may have been on exploiting the patronage powers of the state to\nsolidify his position, but that is not to suggest that he completely abandoned the idea of\nadvancing social progress. To the contrary, one of the new regime\u2019s first acts was the\nAgrarian Reform Law, a land-reform program that divided large estates into small plots\nand redistributed them to landless peasants. While limited\u2014the fellahin had to pay for\nthe land that they acquired\u2014it nonetheless improved the position of many peasants.\nQasim also instituted several reforms aimed at placating the Kurds. Shortly after taking\npower, he issued a new constitution that accorded them equal status in Iraq, and he\nwelcomed the Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani (1903-1979) back from exile in the Soviet\nUnion. For a time, he also acknowledged the far-left Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) as\none of the country\u2019s few legitimate parties.89\nOther reforms were more-far reaching. For example, the revised Personal Status\nLaw extended to women far-greater rights than they had previously enjoyed. Among\nother provisions, it ended child marriage, limited polygamy, and gave women equal\ninheritance rights. Focused on the oil industry, meanwhile, Public Law 80 substantially\nredressed the imbalance in power between the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) and\nBaghdad. Issued in October 1961, it returned over 99.5 percent of the IPC concession\nto the state including the valuable Rumaila field and thus gave the country much greater\ncontrol over its oil reserves.90\nWhile people were universally enthusiastic about Public Law 80, Qasim\u2019s reform\npackage as a whole engendered substantial criticism. It was especially unpopular\namong the Shi\u02bfi clerics. They condemned the revisions he had made to the Personal\nStatus Law, attacked his regime\u2019s embrace of leftist ideas and tolerance of communists,\nand condemned his land-reform program\u2014the latter because it reduced the tithes that\nShi\u02bfi estate owners had paid. The Shi\u02bfi clergy were so put off by Qasim\u2019s reforms, in\nfact, that some\u2014most notably, the young cleric Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr (1935-\n1980)\u2014abandoned their traditional quietism and became active in political groups such\nas the Islamic Da\u02bfwa Party.91\nFor Barzani and the Kurds, in contrast, it was the absence of meaningful reforms\nthat fueled dissatisfaction with Qasim\u2019s government. The primary issue for them was\nautonomy. Barzani demanded that the central government permit the use of Kurdish in\neducation, that it devolve substantial power to local authorities, and, above all, that it\ngrant the Kurds immediate political autonomy. Qasim resisted those conditions.\n88 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 156\u201358; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 94.\n89 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 98\u2013100, 104\u20135.\n90 Marr, 100\u2013102.\n91 Marr, 103\u20137. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 459\nConcerned that Barzani would try to transform autonomy into full independence, he\nsought to walk a fine line wherein he appeared to move toward granting autonomy even\nas he dragged his feet on ceding any real power to the Kurds. No stranger to Iraq\u2019s\nhardball political tactics, Barzani was quick to deduce that Qasim did not intend to meet\nKurdish demands, Accordingly, after quietly building up his military power in the rural\nnorth, he issued an ultimatum in August 1961 demanding immediate autonomy. When\nQasim refused to meet it, he ordered his forces to revolt.92\nBy that point, Qasim\u2019s grip on power was beginning to slip. Three issues\ncontributed to his increasingly vulnerable position. The first was his mishandling of the\nKurdish situation. To the frustration of his fellow officers, the Kurdish revolt that Qasim\nhad failed to prevent had resulted in the Iraqi army becoming mired in an expensive and\nseemingly unwinnable war. The Second was his rejection of pan-Arabism in favor of an\n\u201c\u2018Iraq first\u2019\u201d foreign policy. That decision left Iraq isolated in the Arab world and alienated\nmany pan-Arab Free Officers who favored union with the UAR. The third was Qasim\u2019s\nill-thought-out attempt to annex Kuwait shortly after that country won its independence\nfrom Britain in June 1961. This effort revived a 1938 claim to the emirate and furthered\nwhat the historian Charles Tripp calls an Iraqi \u201cnational myth\u201d: the idea that Kuwait fell\nwithin Iraq\u2019s \u201c\u2018natural\u2019 boundaries\u201d and that the British had maliciously hived the emirate\noff to weaken it. Bold but amateurish, Qasim\u2019s effort to annex Kuwait went nowhere.\nThe quick deployment of British troops to the emirate and Nasser\u2019s equally rapid\nextension of a security guarantee to it compelled the Iraqi leader to hurriedly back down.\nThe diplomatic equivalent of shooting oneself in the foot, the failed attempt cost him a\ngreat deal of prestige and, critically, further undermined his standing among his fellow\nofficers.93\nAs dissatisfaction with Qasim surged, a coalition consisting of the reconstituted\nBa\u2019ath Party and a group of pan-Arabist officers led by Qasim\u2019s former partner, Abd al-\nSalam Arif, organized a conspiracy to overthrow the Iraqi dictator. They moved against\nQasim in February 1963. Taking advantage of his failure to establish the connections\nbetween state and society that could be used to mobilize the masses to support him,\nthe plotters overwhelmed regime loyalists after two days of bitter fighting in Baghdad\nand then arrested and summarily executed Qasim. They followed by establishing a\nBa\u2019athist state ruled by the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC),\nwhich included a mix of party members and pan-Arab officers; Abd al-Salam Arif, who\nwas not himself a Ba\u2019athist, served as president.94\nSharply divided along ideological lines between the radical Ba\u2019athists and the\nmore conservative pan-Arabist military officers, the regime was not destined to last. The\ntwo factions clashed over a number of points including the broader question of the\ncountry\u2019s future direction and the more immediate issue of which group would dominate\ntheir increasingly shaky coalition. A particular sticking point for the officers was the\n92 Marr, 103\u20137.\n93 Marr, 107, 111\u201315.\n94 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 169\u201371. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 460\nBa\u2019ath Party\u2019s development of a militia\u2014the Ba\u2019athist National Guard\u2014that it used to\nbloodily suppress the rival ICP. The more-moderate pan-Arabist officers were delighted\nthat their governing partners had destroyed the communists as a political force;\nhowever, they also viewed the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s growing radicalism and, especially, the\nrapid expansion of its militia with mounting trepidation. Fearing that the Ba\u2019athists would\nbecome unassailable if their paramilitary force were permitted to grow unchecked, Abd\nal-Salam Arif decided to mount a pre-emptive move against the party. Launched in\nNovember 1963, the operation succeeded both in destroying the National Guard and in\npurging the Ba\u2019athists from the NCRC.95\nAbd al-Salam Arif had indicated to his supporters that he planned to liberalize\nIraq once he had taken control of the government. As he came to understand fully the\nunchecked authority he commanded, however, he, like Qasim before him, became\nintoxicated with power and instead opted to establish an authoritarian regime that bore\na striking resemblance to his predecessor\u2019s government. Like Qasim, he made no effort\nto legitimize his rule by fostering a civic-political culture in Iraq or by securing the\nconsent of the governed; instead, he chose to rule through a combination of the state\u2019s\nenormous powers of coercion, patronage, and the personal relationships that he had\nestablished with key members of the officer corps. The central role that ties of mutual\nobligation and patron-client relationships played in the functioning of his government\nwas made clear in the immediate aftermath of his death in a helicopter crash in 1966.\nAs it was well understood that continued stability in Iraq rested on the perpetuation of\nthe network of personal connections, mutual obligations, and patronage that Arif had\ncreated, the officers decided to replace him with the only person who could be trusted to\nmaintain that system: his brother, Abd al-Rahman Arif (r. 1966-1968).96\nSyria\u2014the Ba\u2019ath in Power\nThough the Iraqi Ba\u2019ath party had lost power in 1963\u2014temporarily, as we shall\nsee in the next chapter\u2014its sister branch managed to assume control of Syria the same\nyear. Its return to power was largely a function of the weak nature of the government in\nDamascus following the demise of the UAR. The conservative military officers who had\norchestrated Syria\u2019s secession from Egypt had opted to reestablish the parliamentary\nsystem that had existed prior to the 1958 union and had entrusted the government to\nthe same class of urban notables that had earlier dominated the country. Out of step\nwith the times, those men were unable to provide Syria with effective leadership or to\ncontrol the cliques that had emerged within the officer corps. As future Syrian President\nHafiz al-Asad (r. 1970-2000) aptly put it, \u201c\u2018[i]t was a government without a people and\nwithout an army, the rule of a class which had had its day.\u2019\u201d Taking advantage of the\nregime\u2019s lack of popular support, Ba\u2019athism\u2019s founders, Aflaq and al-Bitar, set about\nreconstituting the Ba\u2019ath Party and began scheming with dissatisfied army officers to\noverthrow the government. They did not have to wait long. Taking advantage of the\nregime\u2019s lack of popular support, a coalition of Nasserist officers and the Ba\u2019ath Party\n95 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 117\u201323.\n96 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 171\u201385. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 461\nlaunched a successful coup that ended parliamentary government in Syria once and for\nall.97\nThe new government proved every bit as wobbly as the one it had supplanted. Its\ninstability stemmed from two significant problems. First, with ostensibly like-minded\nregimes in power in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, the new regime felt compelled to focus a\ngreat deal of its energy on unification talks aimed at bringing the three states into a re-\nformed UAR. On the surface, these discussions were amicable ones between like-\nminded leaders seeking a common end. In reality, however, Nasser, the Ba\u2019athists in\nSyria, and those in Iraq were bitter rivals, and each would only accept union if their\nregime enjoyed complete dominance. As a result, the negotiations were little more than\na Potemkin exercise in which diplomats politely discussed the finer points of political\nunity while their governments and parties fired off propaganda broadsides at each other.\nUnsurprisingly, the unity talks soon collapsed in mutual recrimination.98\nSecond, the new government found itself paralyzed by a split in the Ba\u2019ath Party\nbetween a civilian faction and a group of officers called the Military Committee.\nDominated by Aflaq, the civilians stressed pan-Arabism and downplayed Ba\u2019athism\u2019s\ncalls for dramatic economic reforms. In contrast, their more radical opponents in the\nMilitary Committee deemphasized Arab unity and instead focused on imposing a quasi-\nMarxist-Leninist system on Syria. A theoretician rather than a political infighter, Aflaq\nwas unable to slow either the radicals\u2019 full-throated assault on Syria\u2019s traditional market-\nbased economy or their increasing dominance of the party and government. Finally, in\n1966, the Military Committee launched a coup that formalized its growing power by\nforcing Aflaq out and by putting the radical General Salah Jadid (r. 1966-1970) in control\nof the government.99\nThe 1966 coup had three important ramifications for Syria. First, the purge of\nAflaq created an open rift with the Iraqi branch of the Ba\u2019ath Party, which had remained\nsupportive of the movement\u2019s founder. As a result, following the Ba\u2019athist seizure of\npower in Baghdad in 1968, Syria and Iraq found themselves locked in a bitter cold war\nas each vied for dominance of the broader Ba\u2019athist movement. Second, the change in\ngovernment resulted in Syria pursuing a radical economic restructuring plan aimed at\nreplacing the country\u2019s traditional capitalist economic system with a socialist one.\nForced through on an aggressive timetable, it created significant economic problems\nand social dislocation for the country even as it succeeded in imposing state dominance\nof the economy. Finally, the coup resulted in Syria pursuing a radically aggressive\nforeign policy. Under Jadid, it developed close ties with the Soviet Union, expressed\nhostility toward the conservative Arab states, and, most importantly, adopted recklessly\n97 Patrick Seale, Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East (Berkeley: University of\nCalifornia Press, 1989), 67\u201380.\n98 John McHugo, Syria: A History of the Last Hundred Years (New York: The New\nPress, 2014), 144; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 174.\n99 Seale, Asad, 81\u201383, 86\u2013104. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 462\nbellicose policies toward Israel that would\u2014as we shall see presently\u2014help to spark a\nthird Arab-Israeli war.100\nThe Arab Cold War\nMeanwhile, even as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq competed with each other for\ndominance of pan-Arabism, a broader, ideological conflict was emerging between them\nand the conservative, monarchical Arab states. Dubbed the Arab Cold War by the\npolitical scientist Malcolm Kerr, it took shape as a result of a coup in Yemen in the early\n1960s. Inspired by Egyptian radio propaganda, Nasserist army officers led by General\nAbdallah al-Sallal (r. 1962-1967) deposed the Zaidi Shi\u02bfi Imam Muhammad Badr\n(r. 1962) in September 1962 and declared the establishment of a Nasserist state: the\nYemen Arab Republic (YAR). For a brief time, it seemed like another victory for\nNasserist pan-Arabism. To the chagrin of the officers, however, the imam had managed\nto slip out of the palace before al-Sallal\u2019s troops could arrest him and had escaped to\nthe mountainous north. There, he set to work organizing a pro-royalist tribal insurgency\nagainst the new government.101\nIt did not remain a local struggle for long. Instead, almost immediately after the\ncoup, the civil War in Yemen transformed into a broader regional contest between\nNasserist Egypt and a Saudi-led coalition of conservative Arab monarchies. Riyadh took\nthe first step. Fearing that radical republicanism would spread throughout the Arabian\npeninsula if the Yemeni Nasserists were able to consolidate their position, the Saudi\nregent, Faisal bin Abdulaziz al Saud (r. 1964-1975), began to supply the rebels with\narms in the fall of 1962. Nasser was quick to respond. The Kingdom\u2019s actions not only\nchallenged his dominance of the Arab world but, as important, also presented him with\na golden opportunity to restore his tarnished reputation following Syria\u2019s embarrassing\nsecession from the UAR. Accordingly, he agreed to provide aid to the republicans\u2014first\nby supplying them with weapons and then by deploying 20,000 Egyptian troops to\nYemen. As a result, what had begun as a local, internal dispute in Yemen had, by the\nend of 1962, become a full-fledged proxy fight between Egypt and Saudi Arabia.102\nBegun with high hopes, the Egyptian intervention in Yemen quickly turned into a\ndebacle. Despite eventually sending 70,000 of its best-equipped troops to the YAR,\nEgypt found itself incapable of defeating the imam\u2019s increasingly sophisticated guerrilla\nfighters. Indeed, \u201cNasser\u2019s Vietnam\u201d quickly turned into a major drain on Egypt. The war\nsapped the country\u2019s economy, weakened morale in its military, and damaged its\nleader\u2019s reputation\u2014particularly after his troops employed chemical weapons against\nthe rebels. The fighting also produced enormous numbers of casualties.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 463\nestimated 26,000 Egyptian soldiers died in Yemen between 1962 and the withdrawal of\nNasser\u2019s expeditionary force in 1968.103\nNasser\u2019s intervention in Yemen also brought his country into conflict with the US.\nInitially, President John F. Kennedy (r. 1961-1963) had hoped that the fighting in Yemen\nwould not interfere with the recent improvement in ties between Washington and Cairo.\nIndeed, it was in part to forestall such an eventuality that he pressed both the royalists\nand the republicans to accept a UN-brokered end to the conflict. The failure of that\ninitiative and, especially, Nasser\u2019s decision to deploy Egyptian troops to Yemen\neventually compelled Kennedy to rethink America\u2019s approach to Egypt. The result was\nthe abandonment of the effort to cultivate Nasser that Eisenhower had begun in 1958 in\nfavor of a return to the earlier containment policy. The Kennedy administration made\nthis shift emphatically clear in 1963 when it responded to an Egyptian attack on royalist\nguerrilla bases inside Saudi Arabia by deploying a squadron of F-100 fighter-bombers to\nthe kingdom.104\nKennedy\u2019s successor, Lyndon Johnson (r. 1963-1969), went even further. Seeing\nconsiderably less value in pursuing relations with Nasser than his predecessor, he\naccelerated the pivot back to a policy of containment\u2014most notably by ending PL-480\nwheat sales to Egypt in 1965. Nasser was furious about what he viewed as an attempt\nto blackmail his country. In response, he launched a fresh wave of propaganda attacks\nagainst the West, held a prominent meeting with the Argentine Marxist revolutionary,\nChe Guevara (1928-1967), and\u2014in an action especially nettlesome to Johnson\u2014\nallowed the communist Vietnamese National Liberation Front (NLF) to establish an\noffice in Egypt.105\nThe Middle Eastern Arms Race\nThe United States and Israel\nWashington\u2019s concurrent move to begin providing arms to Israel further angered\nNasser. Kennedy set this new policy in motion in 1962. Believing that Egypt\u2019s Soviet-\nsupplied bombers gave Nasser a first-strike advantage that could destabilize the region,\nthe president broke with America\u2019s longstanding refusal to provide weapons to Israel\nand agreed to sell it powerful Hawk antiaircraft missiles. Johnson went considerably\nfurther. After reassessing the strategic balance in the Middle East in 1965, he moved to\ncounter the Arab states\u2019 growing arsenals of Eastern Bloc weapons by supplying\noffensive American arms to Israel for the first time. That year, he agreed to sell to the\n103 Quote from Bass, 143; Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 77.\n104 Little, American Orientalism, 184\u201386.\n105 Little, 184\u201386.

He followed in 1966 by providing the IDF with\nforty-eight advanced A-4 Skyhawk jets.106\nRising Soviet Influence\nMoscow\u2019s arms sales to the republican Arab states had indeed been substantial.\nBetween 1961 and 1965, Egypt alone had acquired from the USSR 530 tanks, 170\nMiG-19 and MiG-21 fighters, and 25 Tu-16 bombers. Syria and Iraq received similarly\nsubstantial deliveries of advanced Soviet weapons. Why did the USSR lavish these\narms on its Arab allies? What did it hope to gain? Moscow had two primary reasons for\nsupplying the weapons. First, it did so as part of a quid pro quo designed to achieve one\nof its key Cold War-related security goals. In exchange for advanced weapons, the\nUSSR received the right to develop bases at Alexandria in Egypt and at Tartus in Syria\nfrom which its aircraft and ships could hunt American Polaris-missile-armed strategic\nsubmarines operating in the Eastern Mediterranean. Second, providing arms to the\nArab republics left those states dependent on Moscow for spare parts, ammunition, and\ntechnical support and thus dramatically enhanced Soviet influence in the region.107\nThe Six Day War\nThe flood of high-tech weapons into the region helped set the stage for another\nenormously consequential conflict: The Six Day War. Ending in an overwhelming Israeli\nvictory, the confrontation reshaped the Middle East\u2019s political and diplomatic structure\nand fundamentally altered the nature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It is difficult to overstate\nthe importance of this brief war. Indeed, in a century replete with turning points, the Six\nDay War stands alongside the post-World War I division of the region, the establishment\nof Israel in 1948, and the events of 1979 as one of the defining moments in the creation\nof the modern Middle East.\nRising Tensions\nRising tensions in the mid 1960s set the stage for the conflict. After a period of\nrelative quiet in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Arab-Israeli relations took a turn for the\nworse as a result of a conflict over a resource that is peculiarly scarce in the region:\nwater. In late 1963, Tel Aviv stood on the verge of completing the National Water\nCarrier, a major infrastructure scheme designed to divert water from the Sea of Galilee\nin the north to the arid Negev Desert in the south. Israelis were excited about the project\nand the growth that it promised to bring. The Arabs, in contrast, found it deeply\ntroubling. They feared that it would give Israel the arable land needed to absorb another\nthree-million Jewish immigrants and would thus permit it to become so populous that its\n106 Bass, Support Any Friend, 148\u201350, 155\u201357; Zach Levey, \u201cThe United States\u2019\nSkyhawk Sale to Israel, 1966: Strategic Exigencies of an Arms Deal,\u201d Diplomatic History\n28, no. 2 (April 2004): 255\u201376.\n107 Levey, \u201cThe United States\u2019 Skyhawk Sale to Israel, 1966: Strategic Exigencies of an\nArms Deal,\u201d 259; Khalidi, Sowing Crisis, 29\u201330, 37.

Tired of\nthe Egyptian leader\u2019s interference in their internal affairs, radical republicans and\nconservative monarchs alike had long had their eyes out for any means of chipping\naway at his dominant position in the Arab world. The gap between Nasser\u2019s vocal anti-\nZionism and his caution with regard to the water diversion plan seemed to provide just\nthe opening they been looking for. Accordingly, taking advantage of a well-known fact\nin Arab political circles\u2014that Arab leaders could weaken their rivals by denouncing\nthem for being soft on Israel even when they themselves were privately opposed to any\naction that risked bringing down the wrath of the IDF\u2014states like Jordan and Syria\nbegan firing off a series of withering propaganda attacks in which they criticized Nasser\nfor his failure to match his anti-Israeli rhetoric with commensurate action against the\nwater carrier. The critique proved effective. Indeed, in short order, the Egyptian leader\u2019s\nstanding in the Arab world began to sink.109\nSmarting from the criticism, Nasser moved to restore his anti-Zionist bona fides\nat an Arab League summit in Cairo called to address the water diversion scheme.\nMeeting in January 1964, the attendees agreed to put down their differences and to\nunify in opposition to Israel and its plans to use Galilee water to reclaim land in the\nNegev. The meeting proposed two concrete actions. First, the attendees established the\nUnited Arab Command (UAC) to coordinate their militaries and placed it under Egyptian\ncontrol. Second, with financial support from the other Arab states, they called on Syria\nto divert the headwaters of the Jordan River in order to deny Israel the water needed to\nirrigate the Negev. The summit thus appeared to have been a great success for Nasser.\nIt had put a stop to the propaganda attacks against him and it had done so in a way that\nneither cost him his standing as the leading anti-Zionist figure nor required Egypt to fight\na war with Israel that he believed\u2014correctly\u2014it would lose.110\nBegun with high hopes, the effort to redirect the Jordan proved to be entirely\nunsuccessful in the face of unusually fierce Israeli opposition. The intensity of the\nresistance to the scheme was a function of what Brigadier General Israel Lior called\n\u201c\u2018Syrian Syndrome\u2019\u201d: the tendency of IDF officers stationed on the northern front to hold\na particularly strong commitment to the ideology of the Iron Wall. Enthusiastically\nemploying disproportionate force against the bulldozers, tractors, and dredges involved\nin the diversion effort, those officers were able to prevent Syria from making any\nprogress in 1964 and 1965. The failure of the diversion effort frustrated and\nembarrassed Syria\u2019s Ba\u2019athist government and led it to seek some way of hitting back at\n108 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 273; Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 303.\n109 Michael B.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 466\nthe Israelis. Aware that its military could not hope to stand against the might of the IDF,\nit opted for an alternative, asymmetric response in which Syrian-supported Palestinian\nguerrillas mounted raids into Israel either directly across the border or through\nJordanian territory.111\nThese incursions and the fighting in the Galilee put Nasser in a difficult position.\nThat Syria rather than Egypt was leading the charge against Israel and that Damascus\nrather than Cairo was risking retaliation by permitting Palestinian raids from its territory\nwas embarrassing to the man who had been the self-declared leader of the anti-Zionist\ncause since his diplomatic victory in the Suez Crisis. Even worse, his decision to accept\ncommand of the UAC\u2014which seemed at the time to insulate him from censure\u2014had\nleft him vulnerable to renewed criticism from his Arab rivals. Most notably, after Israel\ndramatically raised tensions by retaliating for the Palestinian raids with a devastating\nattack on the West Bank village of Samu in 1966, they tore into him for his failure as\nUAC leader to respond. Long the subject of the Egyptian leader\u2019s propaganda\nbroadsides, Jordan\u2019s King Hussein was particularly unstinting in his criticism. Where, he\nasked bitterly, was Nasser\u2019s vaunted air force? More importantly, why did Egypt\ncontinue to hide behind the UNEF peacekeepers that separated its forces from Israel?\nBy the end of 1966, these criticisms had put Nasser squarely on the defensive. Already\nweakened by his country\u2019s seemingly endless entanglement in Yemen, he was now in\ndanger of losing his influence in the Arab world.112\nThe Road to War\nIn the meantime, the situation on the Israeli-Syrian frontier intensified\ndangerously in early 1967. The proximate cause of the rise in tensions was the change\nthat had occurred in Syria\u2019s government in 1966. More extreme and aggressive than the\ngovernment it replaced, Salah Jadid\u2019s radical Ba\u2019athist regime had encouraged the\nPalestinian guerrillas to step up the frequency of their attacks into Israel. IDF officers\nafflicted with \u201c\u2018Syrian syndrome\u2019\u201d had little patience for the resulting guerrilla incursions\nor for Syria\u2019s tolerance of them and responded by seeking to incite a clash that could\njustify punitive action. Their efforts bore fruit on April 7 when Syrian forces fired on an\narmored tractor that the IDF had, as a provocation, sent into the Demilitarized Zone\n(DMZ) that had divided the two countries since 1948. Escalating rapidly, the incident\nended with Israeli aircraft shooting down six Syrian MiGs and\u2014to the intense\nembarrassment of the Syrian government\u2014overflying Damascus.113\nThe crisis soon widened. On May 13, 1967, Moscow\u2014likely trying to bolster its\nSyrian ally\u2014falsely informed Egypt that Israel was massing troops in the north for an\ninvasion of Syria. Nasser quickly determined that the Soviet warning was untrue;\nnonetheless, he followed it by taking a very public action that appeared to be designed\n111 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 242\u201347.\n112 Oren, Six Days of War, 24\u201327, 31\u201338.\n113 Tom Segev, 1967: Israel, the War, and the Year That Transformed the Middle East\n(New York: Henry Holt and Company, 2005), 195\u2013204. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 467\nto deter Israel. Shortly after he received the Soviet warning, he ordered the Egyptian\narmy to call up its reserves and to deploy offensive units into the Sinai. If Israel invaded\nSyria, his action appeared to say, it would face an immediate Egyptian attack.114\nWhat impelled Nasser to undertake such a seemingly aggressive action if he\nknew that the Soviet report of an impending Israeli attack on Syria was false? He did so\nnot because he wanted a war\u2014he understood all too well that the Arabs lacked the\npower to defeat Israel, particularly with the cream of the Egyptian army hundreds of\nmiles away in Yemen\u2014but because he saw in it an opportunity to restore his standing\nas the leading anti-Zionist. That is, he deployed troops to the Sinai because he believed\nthat doing so would allow him to credibly claim that he had intimidated the Israelis and\nhad thus saved Syria from an IDF attack; best of all, since Tel Aviv was not in fact\npreparing to attack Syria, he could act without running any real risk of war. In other\nwords, as the historian Avi Shlaim notes, the entire operation was \u201can exercise in\nbrinksmanship\u201d: an elaborate charade designed to impress Arab public opinion and to\nsilence his critics without drawing Egypt into a conflict it could not win. As such, it had\nbeen a huge success. Nasser was once again the toast of the Arab world and the\nundisputed leader of the anti-Zionist cause.115\nIt was at that point, however, that events began to get ahead of Nasser. Carried\nalong by the accolades he had received in the Arab world, he followed the deployment\nin the Sinai by demanding that UN Secretary General U Thant (1909-1974) remove the\nUNEF peacekeepers that had been stationed along the Egyptian side of the border with\nIsrael since the Suez Crisis. Nasser\u2019s request posed a serious dilemma for the\nsecretary general. On the one hand, protocol demanded that he withdraw the\npeacekeepers immediately; after all, Egypt was a sovereign state and thus had the right\nto order the UNEF forces to leave. On the other, the pursuit of a peaceful resolution of\nthe crisis suggested that he should slow-walk Nasser\u2019s request and thus give the\nEgyptian leader ample opportunity to reverse course.116\nActing correctly but unwisely, U Thant went with protocol. Stressing that the UN\nhad to respect the wishes of a sovereign state, he agreed to remove the UNEF troops.\nWorse, he not only insisted that the UN had to withdraw all of the peacekeepers\u2014\nincluding those stationed in the Gaza Strip and, crucially, those positioned at Sharm al-\nShaykh\u2014but ordered them to leave on an accelerated timetable. By the end of May, as\na result, no barrier separated Egyptian troops from Israeli soldiers, and nothing\nprevented Nasser from reoccupying the entire Sinai Peninsula. A victim of his own\nsuccess, the Egyptian president now faced enormous pressure in the Arab world to\ndeploy troops along the Israeli border and to reimpose the blockade of the Strait of\nTiran. Unable to resist, he bowed to the might of popular opinion and did so\u2014ordering\n114 Laura James, \u201cEgypt: Dangerous Illusions,\u201d in The 1967 Arab Israeli War: Origins\nand Consequences, ed.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 468\nhis soldiers forward and declaring the strait once again closed to ships bound for\nIsrael.117\nIn the immediate term, Nasser\u2019s actions were a huge success. Having apparently\nintimidated Israel, which had made no response to the Egyptian army\u2019s redeployment,\nhe had reclaimed his position as the leading anti-Zionist and had regained the adulation\nof the Arab world. Indeed, Baghdad, Beirut, Jerusalem, Hebron, and many other Arab\ncities saw massive, spontaneous rallies in favor of the Egyptian president and his\naggressive actions. That public surge in support paid substantial and immediate\ndiplomatic dividends for Nasser. Most notably, thanks to the Egyptian leader\u2019s newfound\npopularity in Jordan, King Hussein\u2014typically at odds with Nasser\u2014felt compelled to\ntravel to Cairo at the end of May and sign a mutual defense treaty with Egypt.118\nWhile Nasser and Egypt were flying high, Israel was gripped with indecision and\nanxiety. The deployment of Egyptian forces to the Sinai had not initially alarmed most\nIsraelis; after all, the UN continued to maintain peacekeepers along the border.\nComplacency had given way to shock and fear, however, when U Thant had ordered\nthe removal of UNEF forces and, especially, when Nasser had reinstituted the blockade\nof the Strait of Tiran. From that point, the country experienced \u201c\u2018the waiting,\u2019\u201d a time of\nsearing anxiety during which its people\u2014many of them survivors of the Holocaust\u2014dug\ntrenches, filled sandbags, and prepared for the worst. The mood was little better in the\ngovernment. Consumed by fear that the Jewish state was in mortal peril, the cabinet\nengaged in a tense debate in late May about how Israel should respond to Nasser\u2019s\nprovocative actions. On one side were those like Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin (1922-\n1995) who, contending that the IDF\u2019s deterrent value would wither away if it failed to\nrespond to the closure of the strait, called for an immediate, preemptive attack. On the\nother, were those like Prime Minister Levi Eshkol (r. 1963-1969) who urged caution and\nwho argued that Israel could only act if it could first convince a reluctant Washington to\nsupport such a move.119\nIt was a peculiarly difficult few weeks for the cabinet. Caught between American\nreluctance and Egyptian bellicosity, Israeli leaders found themselves operating under\ncrushing stress. Finally, in early June, a path forward opened up: American Secretary of\nDefense Robert McNamara (1916-2009) informed the head of Mossad, the Israeli\nintelligence service, that President Johnson had experienced a change of heart and was\nnow willing to support an IDF preemptive attack. The news came as an enormous relief\nto Eshkol\u2019s government and ended the indecision that had paralyzed the cabinet.

Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 469\nenjoying a clear green light from Washington, it promptly voted to launch a surprise\nattack scheduled to begin at daybreak on June 5.120\nThe Conflict, June 5-10, 1967\nIronically in light of the handwringing in Tel Aviv that preceded it, the war was an\nIsraeli rout from start to finish. The IDF initiated the conflict on June 5 by mounting a\nsurprise, dawn air attack that annihilated nearly the entire Egyptian air force as it sat\ndefenseless on the ground. Desperate for assistance, Nasser lured Jordan, Iraq, and\nSyria into launching a series of air strikes against Israel later that morning by claiming\nthat Egypt was in the process of inflicting a decisive defeat on the IDF. Israel easily\nparried those attacks and followed with a sequence of devastating, late-afternoon\nretaliatory raids on Jordanian and Syrian air bases. By nightfall, it had become clear that\nthe IDF\u2019s first-day air offensive had been a total success. All told, its planes had\ndestroyed more than 400 Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian aircraft and had, in doing so,\nsecured total air superiority.121\nThe ground war was similarly one-sided. Israeli troops launched a series of\ndevastating and well-executed offensive drives beginning on June 5 that sent Arab\narmies reeling. As a result, by the time the war ended with a UN-brokered ceasefire on\nJune 10, the IDF had seized the Golan Heights from Syria, the West Bank and\nJerusalem from Jordan, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt. In doing\nso, it had tripled the territory that Israel controlled.122\nAftermath\nThe sheer totality of Israel\u2019s victory over the Arabs had consequences that were\nboth profound and ironic. Four stand out. First, the defeat thoroughly discredited many\nof the Arab governments. Indeed, much as the 1948 War had delegitimated earlier\nregimes and generated a wave of political change, the Six Day War produced a series\nof coups that altered the political landscape in the Arab states of the Middle East and\nNorth Africa. Ironically, however, none of the changes in government that followed the\nSix Day War involved the overthrow of the officer-dominated regimes that had failed so\nspectacularly in the recent conflict with Israel. Instead, the wave of coups that began in\n1967 either reshuffled the leadership of the existing military-controlled governments\u2014as\nhappened in Syria and Iraq\u2014or resulted in radical Arab nationalists toppling\nconservative regimes such as occurred in Libya.123\nSecond, the war altered and complicated the relationship between Tel Aviv and\nWashington. Following the conflict, the US pursued a two-pronged approach to Israel.\nOn the one hand, it pressed Tel Aviv to accept a comprehensive settlement with the\n120 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 252\u201357.\n121 Shlaim, 257\u201367.\n122 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 289\u201390.\n123 Rogan, The Arabs, 340\u201341. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 470\nArab states on the basis of the exchange of the land it had conquered in 1967 for peace\nand recognition. On the other, it abandoned its earlier pretense of neutrality in the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict and thereafter assumed the role of Israel\u2019s military, diplomatic, and\neconomic patron\u2014a relationship to which Washington lent substance by providing Tel\nAviv with fifty advanced, F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers in 1968. Though it was not\nentirely obvious at first, these policies worked at cross purposes. Ironically in fact, the\nmore that the US provided Israel with military and diplomatic support, the more that Tel\nAviv could safely ignore Washington\u2019s efforts to press it to trade land for peace.124\nThird, the war set in motion a process that would fundamentally change the\nnature of the Arab-Israeli conflict. At first, the sheer scale of the IDF victory seemed to\nsuggest that the contest was effectively over. Indeed, Israel\u2019s triumph had been so total\nthat it appeared to have accorded the Jewish state complete dominance in the struggle.\nHowever, even as Israel\u2019s success had given it a commanding position vis-\u00e0-vis the\nArab states, its assumption of control over the West Bank, Jerusalem, and the Gaza\nStrip had revived the older conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Thereafter, Israeli\nrule created a new, shared experience of oppression among the Palestinians that would\nquickly reinvigorate their sense of national identity and their demands for self-rule.\nIronically, in other words, as total as the Israeli triumph over the Arab states may have\nbeen, it merely created a more visceral and immediate clash between Zionists and\nPalestinians and, thus, as we shall see in chapters sixteen and seventeen, a return of\nthe struggle to its origins as a contest between competing nationalisms.125\nThe final irony was that neither side was prepared\u2014despite the enormity of\nIsrael\u2019s military victory\u2014to engage in peace negotiations. In Tel Aviv, a sense of hubris\nalmost instantly replaced the fear that had gripped the nation during \u201c\u2018the waiting\u2019\u201d; as a\nresult, while the government theoretically endorsed the idea of trading land for peace, it\nfelt no pressure to negotiate with the Arab states or to yield any of the strategic territory\nit had acquired. For Arab leaders, in contrast, both the sheer extent of their defeat and\nthe vast degree of Israel\u2019s continued military superiority rendered productive talks\nimpossible. How could they negotiate when Israel held all the cards? As a result, even\nas it was clear that their armies lacked the strength to regain the territory lost in June,\nthe Arab governments issued the famous \u201cthree nos\u201d at the Khartoum Conference in\nSeptember 1967: no negotiations, no recognition of Israel, and no peace.126\nResolution 242\nIn November, meanwhile, the UN Security Council established the parameters\nfor a broad settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict through the passage of Resolution\n242. On the surface, its call for Israel to withdraw \u201cfrom territories occupied in the recent\n124 Yaacov Bar-Siman-Tov, \u201cThe United States and Israel since 1948: A \u2018Special\nRelationship\u2019?,\u201d Diplomatic History 22, no. 2 (1998): 241\u201342; Rogan, The Arabs, 340\u2013\n41; Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 413\u201315.\n125 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 338\u201343.\n126 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 274\u201377. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 471\nconflict\u201d and its declaration that \u201cevery state in the area had the right to \"live in peace\nwithin secure and recognized boundaries\u201d appeared to establish the basis for a\nstraightforward settlement in which Israel would exchange the land it had taken in the\nSix Day War for peace and recognition. In reality, Resolution 242 was a complex and\nslippery document\u2014\"a masterpiece of deliberate British ambiguity,\u201d in Avi Shlaim\u2019s\nwords\u2014that employed intentionally vague language that left it subject to competing\ninterpretation. Pointing to the French version, which used the definite article, The Arabs\nargued that it required Israel to withdraw from all of the territories it had taken in 1967;\nTel Aviv, in contrast, maintained that the reference to secure borders left open the\npossibility that it could retain Jerusalem and those portions of the West Bank that it felt\nwere necessary for its national security. Thus, in the short term, the resolution designed\nto establish the basis of a durable peace merely served to create a new arena of\nrhetorical dispute. Still, Resolution 242 did mark an important milestone in the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict and remains to the present day the starting point for all negotiations\nbetween Israel, its Arab neighbors, and the Palestinians.127\nThe Historical Debate: Israel\u2019s Motives\nUnsurprisingly, given its significance, the Six Day War has proven to be an\nenormously contentious subject. Nasser\u2019s decision making, Washington\u2019s role, and the\nSoviet Union\u2019s actions in the run up to war have all received scrutiny. However, the\nmost contentious debate has centered on the question of why Tel Aviv decided to\nlaunch the surprise attack on June 5. Calling attention to the speed and extent of the\nIDF\u2019s achievement on the first day of the war, many Arab governments contended even\nbefore the fighting had ceased that Israel had initiated the war not out of fear or for\ndefensive purposes, but instead out of a desire to seize territory. In support of this\nargument, they have noted that the Israeli government was well aware that the most\nexperienced Egyptian formations remained mired in Yemen and have pointed out that\nthe US had shared intelligence with Tel Aviv indicating that the formations Nasser had\nsent into the Sinai had assumed a defensive posture and were thus in no position to\nattack Israel.128\nOther officials and scholars\u2014even many who are often critical of Israel\u2014dispute\nthis view, however. Noting the deep concern that gripped the Jewish state in the weeks\nleading up to the conflict, for example, the historian Avi Shlaim contends that Tel Aviv\nacted out of a fundamental concern for its security and that it gained land through\nopportunity and military exigencies rather than through a preconceived strategy. As he\nwrites, the Eshkol government had no \u201cmaster plan for territorial aggrandizement. Its\nterritorial aims were defined not in advance but in response to developments on the\nbattlefield.\u201d Others emphasize the role of credibility in Israeli thinking. As the historian\nand former Israeli Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren argues, Eshkol\u2019s\n127 \u201cUnited Nation\u2019s Resolution 242,\u201d November 22, 1967; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 277\u2013\n78; Oren, Six Days of War, 136.\n128 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 257\u201358. Chapter Fourteen: The Age of Nasser, 1949-1967 Page 472\ngovernment went to war not to gain land but instead because it feared that failing to do\nso would suggest weakness and would thus invite a devastating Arab attack.129\nConclusion\nThough the pan-Arabist officer-dominated states survived and even flourished in\nthe years following the Arabs\u2019 stunning defeat, the Age of Nasser itself came to an\nabrupt end the moment Israeli bombs began to strike their targets on the morning of\nJune 5. Indeed, the enormity of Nasserism\u2019s defeat in the Six Day War had, with\nshocking suddenness, laid bare the movement\u2019s fundamental failings. It had promised\npolitical populism but had delivered dictatorship and corruption; had championed pan-\nArabism but had left the Arab states locked in petty ideological and political feuds; and\nhad pledged independence from the imperial powers but had rendered Egypt\ndependent on the USSR for military and economic aid. Above all, its adherents had\ndeclared loudly and repeatedly that Nasserism would bring Israel to heel and permit the\nPalestinians to return to their homes; as the smoking remains of the Egyptian air force\nmade emphatically clear, however, Nasserism had failed utterly to do so and had, in the\nprocess, left the Palestinians even further from statehood than they had been at the end\nof the 1948 War. Over the following decade, as a result, proponents of new, more\nextreme variants of Arab nationalism and, later, Islamism would gain popular support at\nthe expense of Nasserism by claiming that they could achieve the ends that the\nEgyptian leader had promised but had failed to deliver: Israel\u2019s defeat, the return of the\nPalestinian refugees to their homes, and sustained economic growth.\nThose new ideologies did not emerge in isolation, however. Instead, events\noccurring at the same time outside the core of the Middle East would influence them in\ncritical ways. It is to the post-World War II experience of those geographically peripheral\nareas\u2014Turkey, the Gulf States, and, especially, Iran that we will next turn.\n129 Oren, Six Days of War, 62; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 258\u201362. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979\nIntroduction\nWhile pan-Arabism and the Arab-Israeli conflict gave coherence to events in the\ncore of the Middle East during the 1950s and 1960s, they had little impact on the\nregion\u2019s peripheral states. Instead, countries like Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the\nGulf States largely followed their own paths. Turkey struggled to transition to\ndemocracy, Iran pursued a top-down modernization effort under the direction of its ruler,\nShah Muhammad Reza (r. 1941-1979), and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates fought\nto get a greater share of the revenue that their vast oil holdings generated. As such, the\nregion\u2019s peripheral states exercised only limited influence over the rest of the Middle\nEast during the 1950s and 1960s.\nThat situation changed dramatically in the 1970s. While Turkey remained largely\noutside of the region\u2019s mainstream during that decade, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf\nemirates vaulted to prominence and began to exert substantial influence over the other\nstates of the Middle East. To a considerable degree, their growing significance reflected\nimportant economic changes. Most notably, oil revenue stemming from surging demand\nin the industrialized world transformed Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States into\nimportant regional and even global economic players in the 1970s. However, political\nchanges also played a critical part in giving the peripheral states greater influence\u2014\nparticularly Iran. There, the cataclysmic Iranian Revolution of 1979 would put the first\nmodern, Islamist government in power in the Middle East and would, in so doing,\nencourage further Islamist challenges throughout the region.\nSaudi Arabia and the Gulf States\nAt the end of World War II, the Arabian peninsula was an impoverished\nbackwater that fell within Britain\u2019s sphere of influence. By 1979, in contrast, it had\nbecome a fabulously rich region that occupied a prominent place within the American\neconomic and strategic order\u2014all thanks to its vast petroleum reserves and to the\nsuccess of the producing states in gaining control of that resource. Indeed, the oil that\nthey possessed not only raised living standards to previously unimagined heights but\ngave the Arab producer states substantial regional and even global influence.\nPetroleum was not an absolute good for the Arab producer states, however. Even as it\nprovided enormous economic and political benefits, it would also spark significant\ndomestic and international security issues for the Gulf States and, importantly, would\nhelp to midwife the birth of the violent, destabilizing Jihadist ideology that would begin to\ngain prominence in the 1980s.\nThe Hydrocarbon Age\nOil loomed large in the years immediately following World War II for the\ndeveloped states of the West. Petroleum had emerged as the most vital resource of the Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 474\nage\u2014one that fueled both the ongoing process of industrialization and the steady rise in\nliving standards that millions had come to expect. A key raw material in the manufacture\nof many goods, it was essential to the production of fertilizer, chemicals, and plastics.\nMore importantly, it had become the essential commodity on which nearly all forms of\ntransportation had come to depend. This was especially true in the wealthy United\nStates. There, inexpensive gasoline not only facilitated the movement of goods and\npeople, but, more broadly, rendered the social and spatial revolution of mass\nsuburbanization possible. Already in motion before World War II, suburbanization\naccelerated rapidly after the conflict\u2019s conclusion as Americans took advantage of\ninexpensive, government-subsidized loans and the construction of limited-access\nhighways to buy new, detached homes in auto-dependent greenfield developments\noutside the central city. Automobile ownership rates made the sheer scale of this trend\nclear. Between 1945 and 1950 alone, the number of registered cars in the US nearly\ndoubled, rising from twenty-six million to fifty million.1\nThe affluence of the postwar United States was not a foregone conclusion,\nhowever. The suburbanization of the US that created so many jobs and that produced\nso much wealth depended on the continued flow of cheap, plentiful fuel; inexpensive\ngas, in other words, was the literal oil that kept the machine of American prosperity\ngoing. There was a potential problem, however: the domestic supply of petroleum on\nwhich prosperity rested did not appear to be limitless. This issue was not lost on\npolicymakers in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt (r. 1933-1945). Indeed, as we\nsaw in chapter eleven, many policymakers had become so concerned during World War\nII that domestic reserves of oil were not sufficient to meet future demand that they had\nbegun to seek alternative sources of petroleum abroad. They did not have to look very\nhard. With seemingly limitless reserves, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States appeared to\nbe the obvious place from which to obtain that oil.2\nAmerican policymakers were hardly alone in linking cheap petroleum to postwar\nabundance or in connecting continued economic growth to the Middle East\u2019s vast\nreserves. Instead, nearly all of the industrialized states made clear that they saw\ninexpensive Middle Eastern oil as the foundation of continued prosperity. For example,\nBritish Foreign Minister Ernest Bevin (1881-1951) declared after World War II that\ncontinued access to the region\u2019s reserves was necessary if Britain hoped \u201c\u2018to achieve\nthe standard of living at which we are now aiming.\u2019\u201d3\nThe Middle East\u2019s petroleum reserves were also essential to the achievement of\nvital American geostrategic goals. In the late 1940s, policymakers feared that the\ntremendous postwar economic dislocation in Western Europe could lead the region\u2019s\nimpoverished people to turn in desperation to communism and, in so doing, to bring\ntheir states into the Soviet Bloc\u2014thereby irrevocably tipping the global balance of power\n1 Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power (New York:\nTouchstone Books, 1991), 409, 542, 551\u201353.\n2 Yergin, 410, 427.\n3 Yergin, 410, 427. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 475\nin Moscow\u2019s favor. To forestall such a train of events, Washington moved aggressively\nto rebuild Western Europe\u2019s shattered economy through the passage of the Marshall\nPlan in 1948. Substantial in scale, it provided the critical injection of funds needed to\njumpstart the region\u2019s reconstruction and to spark a revival in living standards. American\ngrants could not achieve a recovery by themselves, however. Implicit in Washington\u2019s\neconomic plans for Europe was the steady availability of inexpensive and plentiful\nMiddle Eastern oil; without it, Marshall Plan aid\u2014however generous\u2014would be unable\neither to turn Western Europe\u2019s moribund economy around or, by extension, to contain\ncommunism in the region.4\nThe Fifty-Fifty Deal\nDeeply committed to opposing Marxism, King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (r. 1902-1953)\nwas only too happy to contribute to the American effort to contain the USSR. At the\nsame time, however, he had become increasingly dissatisfied with the royalty\narrangement that Saudi Arabia had negotiated with Aramco. This new perspective\nconstituted a significant shift from the king\u2019s earlier view of the concession. As we saw\nin chapter eleven, he had initially been more than content with the terms of the\nagreement and with the share of oil revenue he was receiving. Not only had the Aramco\nconcession put all of the risk on the petroleum companies, but, since the late 1930s, it\nhad also provided the kingdom with heretofore unimaginable amounts of wealth through\nthe sale of its oil.5\nIn time, however, Riyadh\u2019s views of the concession began to change. The sheer\nscale of Aramco\u2019s profits\u2014they were three times the amount that the Saudi government\nreceived in royalties\u2014and the fact that the US Treasury had collected $43 million in tax\nrevenue from the sale of Saudi oil in 1949 while the kingdom had received only $39\nmillion in royalty payments led Saud and his advisors to conclude that the terms of the\nconcession needed to be revised. News of Venezuela\u2019s success in securing a fifty-fifty\narrangement wherein it received half of the revenue from the sale of its oil reinforced\nthat line of thinking and spurred the king to demand a new agreement based on similar\nterms. In doing so, however, Riyadh did not want to put Aramco at a competitive\ndisadvantage by raising its costs. Accordingly, Saudi officials focused less on getting a\nlarger share of Aramco\u2019s revenue than on capturing some or all of the substantial tax\nreceipts that the American government collected on the company\u2019s Saudi operations.6\nWith the assistance of high-priced American tax attorneys, Saud\u2019s advisors found\na way to divert that revenue. The solution lay in exploiting a component of the US tax\n4 Melvyn P.

In other words, by agreeing to pay taxes to Riyadh that would then be offset\ndollar for dollar on its American return, Aramco could permit Saudi Arabia to enjoy a\nfifty-fifty split of its profits at no cost to the company\u2019s bottom line. Implemented in 1951,\nthe new arrangement worked as advertised. Riyadh\u2019s share of oil revenue grew from\n$60 million in royalties in 1950 to $110 million in royalties and tax receipts in 1951,\nwhile, over the same period, the US Treasury\u2019s saw the revenue it received on the sale\nof Saudi oil in the United States fall from $50 million to just $6 million. Company profits\nremained unaffected.7\nSurprisingly, officials in President Harry Truman\u2019s (r. 1945-1953) administration\nwere not merely tolerant of this arrangement but outright enthusiastic about it. They\nrecognized that it provided a way for them to advance an important but stalled regional\nagenda. During the late 1940s, Truman had sought to provide the kingdom with\neconomic and military assistance designed to aid in the containment of the USSR; that\neffort had faltered, however, in the face of congressional hostility to the allocation of\nfunds to states hostile to Israel. The Foreign Tax Credit provided a way around that\nopposition. Not requiring action on the part of congress, it permitted the administration\nto indirectly provide Riyadh with aid and thus gave a delighted Truman administration a\nbackdoor means of securing its regional objectives.8\nThe new deal that Saud and Aramco officials negotiated had implications that\nwent well beyond the kingdom. Other states in the Middle East quickly followed suit and\nrenegotiated the terms of their concessions along similar lines with the result that the\nfifty-fifty deal became the new standard. The leaders of the Arab producer states were\nevery bit as delighted with the terms of the new arrangement as ibn Saud had been.\nAfter all, it meant that they were now receiving a much larger share of the profits on the\nextraction and sale of their oil.9\nAt the same time, however, they quickly realized that the new profit-sharing\nagreement they had won was a more qualified achievement than it appeared at first\nblush. The issue was one of control. While the petroleum states received a larger share\nof the profits, the oil companies continued to make all decisions related to the price and\namount of crude extracted. In other words, while the producing countries earned more\nmoney as a result of the fifty-fifty deal, they had moved no closer to securing what was\ngradually becoming a critical goal for them: winning control of the petroleum that\nconstituted the primary source of their wealth.10\n7 Rachel Bronson, Thicker Than Oil: America\u2019s Uneasy Partnership with Saudi Arabia\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 56.\n8 Douglas Little, American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since\n1945, Third Edition (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2008), 54\u201355.\n9 Yergin, The Prize, 447\u201349.\n10 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 55\u201356. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 477\nSaudi Arabia, 1953-1970\nDuring the two decades following its adoption of the fifty-fifty agreement, Saud\nArabia focused more on nation building and on developing the sinews of a modern\neconomy than on assuming control of its oil. Initially, the kingdom found the going\ndifficult. Poor leadership, power struggles within the ruling family, persistently depressed\noil prices, and Nasserist-inspired instability combined to frustrate efforts to modernize\nSaudi Arabia in the 1950s and early 1960s. Under Ibn Saud\u2019s son Faisal (r. 1964-1975),\nhowever, the Saudi state would finally find its footing and would establish a stable\nregime that would provide a model for the other oil-producing states located along the\nPersian Gulf.\nUpon ibn Saud\u2019s death, his son, Saud (r. 1953-1964), became the kingdom\u2019s\nsecond monarch. The new king faced three daunting challenges upon acceding to the\nthrone. First, as Saudi Arabia lacked a functioning bureaucracy and did not yet even\nadhere to a budget, he needed to quickly develop the state capacity that the kingdom\u2019s\nincreasingly sophisticated economy required. Second, thanks to ibn Saud\u2019s free\nspending, he had to address a substantial budget deficit and to find a way to impose\nfiscal discipline on the Saudi state and the country\u2019s very large royal family. Finally, he\nwas compelled to parry the increasingly dangerous ideological challenges that\nNasserism and Ba\u2019athism posed to his state and to his family\u2019s rule.11\nSaud enjoyed at best mixed success in addressing these problems. To his credit,\nhe did manage to establish the foundations of a modern government by expanding the\nsize and reach of the bureaucracy and by creating a number of new departments such\nas the Ministries of Education and Communications. At the same time, however, his\npersonal vices and diplomatic inexperience left him ill equipped to resolve the other\nissues that the kingdom confronted. Rather than addressing Saudi Arabia\u2019s budget\ndeficit, for example, he made it worse. Wasteful to an almost comedic degree, it took\nhim just five years to turn the $200 million debt that he inherited in 1953 into a whopping\n$480 million deficit.12\nHis efforts to meet the third challenge, fending off pan-Arabism, likewise fell flat.\nSaud initially sought to ensure the kingdom\u2019s security by developing a close relationship\nwith Gamal abdel Nasser (r. 1954-1970). He felt compelled to abruptly change course in\n1956, however, when he learned that the Egyptian leader had gained a worryingly large\nfollowing in Saudi Arabia and, worse, had begun plotting a coup attempt against him.\nDetermined to push back, the king responded in 1957 by offering the apparently\nreceptive head of the Syrian security service, Abd al-Hamid Sarraj (1925-1913), a\n\u00a31.9 million bribe conditioned on the intelligence chief preventing the union of Syria and\nEgypt. Unfortunately for the king, Sarraj had no intention of blocking the creation of the\nUnited Arab Republic (UAR) and promised to do so only so that he could lure the\n11 James Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, Second Edition (New York:\nCheckmark Books, 2004), 208\u201313.\n12 Wynbrandt, 211, 216, 218. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 478\ninexperienced and overconfident Saudi king into a trap. Sarraj\u2019s plan worked to\nperfection. Releasing unimpeachable evidence of Saud\u2019s plot to the press, he\nthoroughly embarrassed the Saudi king\u2014destroying his credibility both internationally\nand, more critically, within the ruling family.13\nAccordingly, though Saud retained the formal title of king, his half-brother, Crown\nPrince Faisal, assumed control of the Saudi government in 1958 at the behest of the\nother princes. The change in leadership was very much to the kingdom\u2019s benefit. Pious,\nfiscally prudent, shrewd, and diplomatic, Faisal was everything that his brother was not.\nHe immediately launched a successful anticorruption campaign and, with the assistance\nof the International Monetary Fund (IMF), quickly restored the kingdom\u2019s fiscal position.\nDespite Faisal\u2019s success, however, Saud was not yet fully out of the picture. As a result,\nthere followed a six-step forward, five-step back dance in which the two brothers traded\npower over the next few years. That struggle only ended in 1964 when Saud\u2019s threat to\nstart a debilitating civil war led sixty-five \u02bfulama\u02be and one-hundred princes to depose\nhim and to formally elevate Faisal as the kingdom\u2019s third ruler.14\nNow king in his own right, Faisal moved aggressively to legitimate the rule of the\nSaudi family and to inoculate the country from the threat of radical ideologies and Arab\nnationalism. He approached this task with a three-pronged strategy. First, in what\namounted to an updated version of the traditional Arab practice of building loyalty\nthrough generosity, the new king devoted an increasing share of the state\u2019s oil revenue\nto the provision of patronage. Beginning in the early 1960s, Saudis enjoyed steadily\nimproving healthcare and welfare benefits, access to an expanding educational system,\nand growing employment opportunities in the expanding army and central bureaucracy.\nSecond, he acted to improve the quality of life in the kingdom by funding development\nprojects aimed at providing Saudi Arabia with modern infrastructure\u2014particularly, as we\nshall see, after the price of oil exploded in the 1970s. Finally, he secured the support of\nthe Wahhabi religious scholars by giving them the perquisites and salaries of state\nemployees and by establishing religious universities.15\nReligion was also central to Faisal \u2018s efforts to combat Arab nationalism outside\nthe kingdom. Personally pious and politically conservative, he disapproved of the\nsecular and socialist ideas of the Ba\u2019athists and Nasserists and viewed those ideologies\nas dangerous to the well-being of the Arab people. Determined to blunt their appeal, he\npromoted pan-Islamism as an alternative form of identity and sought to bolster the\nkingdom\u2019s standing with more-conservative, religious Arabs by emphasizing Saudi\nArabia\u2019s role as guardian of the Holy Places. More concretely, he gave sanctuary and\nsupport to Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood and, as we saw in chapter fourteen, challenged\n13 Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 196\u201397.\n14 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 75\u201377, 82\u201383, 91\u201392.\n15 al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 120\u201328.

To a substantial\ndegree, their unhappiness was a function of the growing oil surplus that had emerged\nover the course of the prior decade. A product of the imbalance between a sharp\nincrease in the supply of petroleum and a far-more modest rise in demand, the glut put\nstrong downward pressure on prices. The entry of the USSR into the global oil\nmarketplace in 1955 dramatically exacerbated this trend. Flooding the world with cheap\npetroleum, Moscow made an already-bad situation even worse for the oil-producing\nstates.17\nAt first, the glut affected the oil companies rather than the producer states. That it\ndid so was a function of corporate policy. While the companies continued to pay\nroyalties based on the official posted rate, they increasingly had to discount the price at\nwhich they sold their oil on the open market\u2014meaning, in other words, that they were\nforced to eat the difference between the market rate and the official one. The\ncompanies were willing to continue doing so for a time but, by the end of the 1950s,\nfound the practice no longer tenable. British Petroleum (BP), formerly the Anglo-Iranian\nOil Company (AIOC), was the first to act. To the shock of the producing states, it cut the\nposted price of oil by a substantial eighteen cents per barrel in 1959. For a time, it stood\nalone. In August 1960, however, Standard Oil of New Jersey announced that it, too,\nwas reducing the amount paid to the producing states for oil\u2014in its case chopping the\nper barrel price by fourteen cents, a drop of 7 percent. This move broke the dam. In\nshort order, the rest of the petroleum companies followed suit with cuts of their own.18\nThe leaders of the oil producing states were enraged. The August 1960 reduction\nof the posted price meant a corresponding drop in royalty payments to states that\nderived nearly all of their revenue from the sale of petroleum. Worse, the oil companies\nhad announced the change unilaterally; indeed, they had not even offered so much as a\nby-your-leave to the countries that actually owned the oil.19\nThe producer states responded with collective action. Already unhappy about the\nfailure of revenue to rise sufficiently in the years since the fifty-fifty agreements went into\neffect, the governments of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela met in\nBaghdad in September 1960 to explore the creation of a collective organization that\ncould better represent them in negotiations with the oil companies. Under the direction\nof the head of the Saudi Directorate of Oil and Mining Affairs, Abdullah Turayqi (1919-\n16 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 70; Yaqub, Containing Arab Nationalism, 123, 133\u201334.\n17 Yergin, The Prize, 514\u201315.\n18 Yergin, 521\u201323.\n19 Rogan, The Arabs, 82. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 480\n1997), the attendees established the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\n(OPEC). Intended to limit the global supply of oil, it was empowered to establish\nmaximum production quotas for each of the member states. In other words, the\norganization that Turayqi and his fellow ministers had created was a cartel designed to\nraise prices by limiting supply.20\nThe organization would later assume a powerful position in global economic and\npolitical affairs. Initially, however, it enjoyed at best mixed success. On the positive side,\nOPEC rapidly gained many new member states over the course of the 1960s and, by\ndint of its mere existence, compelled the oil companies to think twice about cutting\nprices or taking further unilateral action. At the same time, however, the ongoing oil\nglut\u2014made worse by the entrance into the market of major new producers like Libya\u2014\nensured that prices remained low and that the organization could not raise them by\nlimiting production.21\nThe attempt by the Arab oil states to embargo the sale of petroleum to pro-Israeli\ncountries during the Six Day War demonstrated the producers\u2019 continued weakness.\nSeeking to help Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, the oil ministers of Libya, Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi\nArabia, and Algeria announced on June 6, 1967, that they were deploying what they\ncalled the \u201c\u2018oil weapon\u2019\u201d: an immediate embargo of the sale of petroleum to countries\nfriendly to Israel including the US, Britain, and West Germany. The embargo\u2019s impact\non Middle Eastern production was immediate and substantial. Coupled with the closure\nof the Suez Canal, it depressed oil exports from the region to a mere 40 percent of their\nprewar level.22\nDespite this significant drop in supply, however, the oil weapon ultimately proved\nunsuccessful in preventing countries friendly to Israel from receiving adequate supplies\nof petroleum. What had gone wrong? How was it that a substantial drop in Middle\nEastern production did not produce a concomitant shortfall in the consuming states? Put\nsimply, the embargo\u2019s failure was a function of America\u2019s excess domestic capacity.\nTaking advantage of the country\u2019s ability to quickly ramp up production, the\nadministration of President Lyndon Johnson (r. 1963-1969) ordered American oil\ncompanies to expand domestic production and directed them to restructure supply\nchains so that the US could make good West Germany and Britain\u2019s petroleum deficits;\nas a result, the embargo proved to be little more than a costly failure for the Arab oil\nproducers. Indeed, the lesson was clear: so long as America retained the excess\ncapacity needed to serve as the world\u2019s swing producer\u2014meaning that it constituted a\nsupplier of last resort that could raise production to offset shortfalls elsewhere\u2014the oil\nweapon would remain ineffective.23\n20 Rogan, 357\u2013458.\n21 Yergin, The Prize, 523\u201330.\n22 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 99\u2013102.\n23 Bronson, 101\u20132; Quote from Yergin, The Prize, 554\u201358. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 481\nThe Gulf States: \u201cEast of Suez\u201d\nMeanwhile, a significant changing of the guard took place in the Persian Gulf in\nthe late 1960s and early 1970s. During the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, as\nwe have seen, Britain had assumed a colonial relationship with Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar,\nOman, and the seven smaller emirates known collectively as the Trucial States. In\ncontrast to Britain\u2019s diminished role in other parts of the Middle East, that arrangement\nremained essentially unchanged following the Suez Crisis. By the mid 1960s, however,\nthe breakup of the empire had rendered the arrangement between London and the Gulf\nprincipalities anachronistic and had made the stationing of the 6,000 British troops that\ngarrisoned the emirates a needless burden on the exchequer\u2014one that seemed\nincreasingly incompatible with Britain\u2019s more-and-more challenging fiscal situation. As\nsuch, it was hardly surprising that Prime Minister Harold Wilson (r. 1964-1970, 1974-\n1976) responded to the onset of a severe balance-of-payments crisis in January 1968 in\npart by announcing the liquidation of Britain\u2019s remaining military obligations \u201ceast of\nSuez.\u201d24\nWilson\u2019s announcement set off a panic in the Gulf States. The leaders of those\noil-rich but vulnerable countries had at times chafed under British dominance, but they\nalso valued the protection that it afforded them both against broad ideological\nchallenges like pan-Arabism and against more acute military threats like the radical\nPopular Front for the Liberation of Oman and the Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG) guerrilla\nmovement that had emerged in the 1960s. Indeed, the sheikhs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi\nwere so concerned about the loss of British security that they offered to defray the cost\nof the garrisons if Britain agreed to retain them. Ultimately, London opted not to take\nthem up on this offer. Instead, it helped the seven Trucial States join together to form\nthe United Arab Emirates (UAE) so that they could better protect each other, and it\nprovided Oman with military assistance in its campaign to defeat the PFLOAG. These\ninitiatives were successful. As a result, despite the anxiety that some of the leaders of\nthe Gulf States had expressed at the time of Wilson\u2019s announcement, the Persian Gulf\nregion remained stable following the withdrawal of British troops in 1971.25\nThe Turning Point\nIts stability after Britain\u2019s withdrawal was likely in part a function of the\nastonishing increase in the price of oil that occurred during the 1970s. At root, the\ndramatic run up in prices that occurred over the course of that decade was a function of\nsupply and demand. Thanks largely to suburbanization in the US and increased\nautomobile ownership in Western Europe, North America, and Japan in the 1960s,\nconsumption of oil in the non-communist world exploded\u2014rising from nineteen million\nbarrels per day in 1960 to a then-staggering forty-four million barrels per day in 1972.\nSupply also increased during this period, but, in a turnaround from the situation in the\n1950s, it failed to match pace with the now-galloping surge in demand. Irresistibly, as a\n24 Ulrichsen, Insecure Gulf, 21; Yergin, The Prize, 565\u201366.\n25 Ulrichsen, Insecure Gulf, 21. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 482\nresult, the price of crude oil began to tick upward. The rate of increase was slow at first,\nbut it began to accelerate dramatically after 1970\u2014doubling between that year and the\nend of 1972 alone.26\nChanges in the American oil market contributed significantly to the rise in prices\nand made possible an important shift in power from consuming to producing states.\nWhile the United States remained the world\u2019s largest producer into the 1970s, it reached\nits peak, pre-fracking production total of 11.2 million barrels per day in 1970. Thereafter,\nwith domestic production flat and demand continuing to rapidly grow, the US was\ncompelled to make up the difference between the amount of oil it produced and the\namount it consumed by increasing the quantity that it imported. That rise was\nenormous, and it came shockingly fast. Indeed, imports surged from 2.2 million barrels\nper day in 1967 to a staggering 6 million barrels per day in 1972. The growing gap\nbetween domestic production and consumption would have two important effects. First,\nthe mounting shortfall would play an important part in spurring the rise in world oil\nprices. Second, though few noted it at the time, the American petroleum deficit had a\nsecondary impact of even greater consequence. With its spare capacity having\ndisappeared thanks to the combination of plateauing domestic production and rising\ndemand, the United States was no longer able to offset supply shocks or to prevent\nprice surges by pumping more oil as it had in the past. With enormous consequences\nfor the price of oil, in other words, the US had ceded its role as the global swing\nproducer\u2014a position that Saudi Arabia would henceforth occupy.27\nMeanwhile, as a result of the changing balance between producers and\nconsumers, the OPEC states were now finally in a position to begin shifting control over\nthe supply and price of oil from the companies to the producer countries. That process\nbegan in 1971 with the Tripoli and Tehran Agreements. Made possible by the growing\nimbalance between supply and demand, those deals included both substantial price\nincreases and a move from the fifty-fifty arrangement that had obtained for the prior two\ndecades to a new system that granted the oil states 55 percent of the profits from the\nsale of their oil.28\nThis success merely whetted the OPEC states\u2019 appetite for further concessions.\nThe following year, they pushed for what Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral\nResources Ahmed Zaki Yamani (1930-2021) called \u201c\u2018participation\u2019\u201d: partial ownership of\nthe companies that held the oil concessions in their states. This process followed two\npaths. Intent on avoiding substantial disruptions to the market, some states like Saudi\nArabia agreed on a gradual process of nationalization. In its case, it began with a 25\npercent ownership position that gradually increase to 51 percent in 1983. Others such\nas Algeria and Libya pursued a far-more aggressive path and assumed majority stakes\nimmediately. Regardless of the approach, participation succeeded in substantially\nincreasing the producer states\u2019 share of what were, thanks to rising demand, rapidly\n26 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 111; Yergin, The Prize, 567.\n27 Yergin, The Prize, 567\u201368.\n28 Yergin, 582\u201383. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 483\ngrowing profits. It is important to keep in mind, however, that revenue was not the main\nreason that the OPEC states pursued ownership. On the contrary, while they certainly\nenjoyed the added income they received, they sought partial ownership primarily as a\nway for them to challenge the concession system and, critically, to secure control\u2014and,\nthus, sovereignty\u2014over their countries\u2019 most valuable resource.29\nThe transformation of the relationship between the producing and consuming\nstates reached its culmination during the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the Arab\nrepublics of Egypt and Syria in October 1973 (we will explore the conflict itself in\nchapter sixteen). Rapidly increasing prices were the first sign of the changed\nenvironment. OPEC had already succeeded in raising the price of a barrel of oil by 12\npercent to $2.90 in June and was preparing at the time the war started to demand\nanother big increase at a meeting with oil company representatives scheduled to begin\nin Vienna on October 8. Already fraught owing to the crisis atmosphere created by the\nfighting between Israel, Egypt, and Syria, the negotiations collapsed when oil company\nrepresentatives balked at the producers\u2019 shocking demand for a doubling of prices. The\nfailure of the negotiations did not stop the Arab oil ministers from increasing prices,\nhowever. On the contrary, emboldened by the fighting, they adjourned to Kuwait City\nwhere they unilaterally raised the cost of a barrel of oil to $5.12.30\nMore importantly, they once again deployed the oil weapon. The day after they\nraised prices, the Arab ministers announced significant production cuts scheduled to\ntake effect immediately. A few days later, they followed by imposing an embargo on the\nsale of petroleum to countries like the US that supported Israel. This time, the oil\nweapon worked. With Saudi Arabia having replaced the US as the world\u2019s swing\nproducer, the embargo and, especially, the production cuts created oil shortages and\nsevere economic pain in the industrialized world. The result was steep inflation, biting\nrecessionary conditions, and wrenching social discontent among Western consumers\nlong conditioned to expect cheap energy.31\nMore broadly, the embargo and the production cuts signaled that the producing\nstates, rather than the consuming ones, now called the shots when it came to the\nsupply and price of petroleum. The OPEC states were quick to take advantage. While\nmotorists in the US endured gas lines and fumed about rationing, the producers\ncheerfully exploited their newfound power to complete the process of nationalizing their\noil industries that had begun with the \u201c\u2018participation\u2019\u201d agreements in 1972. Henceforth,\nas a result, those states would hold title to their most valuable natural resource.\nWestern consumers were largely unaware of that shift, but they were intimately familiar\nwith another change that OPEC put in place at the shah\u2019s urging.

Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 484\nDecember 1973, the organization increased the price of oil to $11.65 a barrel\u2014a four-\nfold increase in less than six months.32\nThe Good Times\nThe next four years were, in the words of one of the organization\u2019s executives,\n\u201c\u2018OPEC\u2019s Golden Age.\u2019\u201d They were indeed good times for producer countries like Saudi\nArabia and the Gulf States. The massive influx of petrodollars\u2014meaning US dollar\nholdings earned through the sale of oil\u2014provided the means for them to thoroughly\ntransform and modernize their economies. The amounts were mind boggling. Between\n1965 and 1975, Saudi Arabia\u2019s GDP rose from 10.4 billion Saudi Riyals to over 164\nbillion Riyals thanks almost entirely to the massive surge in oil prices that occurred in\nthe early 1970s. No one benefited more from this flood of wealth than the thousands of\nprinces who made up the royal family. Drawing little distinction between state revenue\nand dynastic wealth, they waged an arms race of conspicuous consumption in which\nthey spent extravagant sums on fleets of cars, new palaces, huge yachts, and\nEuropean luxury properties. All told, the royal family alone skimmed off an estimated\n30 to 40 percent of the kingdom\u2019s oil revenue.33\nWhile the princes certainly enjoyed their newfound income, the scale and\nopenness of their spending also threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the royal\nfamily. After all, their gambling, drinking, and naked materialism were hardly consistent\nwith the strictures of Wahhabi Islam. Aware of the potential danger that the gap\nbetween the kingdom\u2019s professed values and the behavior of its rulers posed to the\ndynasty\u2019s legitimacy, Faisal used the surge in oil revenue to prevent the emergence of\ndiscontent. To limit any objections that the \u02bfulama\u02be might have raised to the princes\u2019\nlifestyle, he increased the subsidies that he provided to mosques and religious colleges\nand lavished funds on the religious scholars\u2019 effort to bring Wahhabi ideas to Muslims\noutside the kingdom. Meanwhile, though he refused to consider any genuine move\ntoward democratic government, he took two steps designed to retain the support of the\nemerging middle class. First, he steadily increased the number of people directly\nemployed by the state. Second, he dramatically accelerated a series of ambitious, five-\nyear modernization programs that had begun at the start of the 1970s. Thanks to the\nquadrupling of oil prices in 1973, for example, he was able to raise the amount allocated\nto the first five-year plan (1970-1975) from $9.2 billion to $21 billion. Later programs\nwere even larger. Most notably, as a result of the windfall that followed the Yom Kippur\n32 Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 112, 122.\n33 Kim Ghattas, Black Wave: Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the Forty-Year Rivalry That\nUnraveled Culture, Religion, and Collective Memory in the Middle East (New York:\nHenry Holt and Co., 2020), 52\u201353; quote from Yergin, The Prize, 634; Lawrence Wright,\nThe Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 (New York: Vintage Books, 2006),\n100. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 485\nWar, the Saudi government was able to assign an order of magnitude more money\u2014a\nstaggering $200 billion\u2014to the second five-year plan (1976-1980).34\nAs a result of these programs and a third completed in the early 1980s, Saudi\nArabia experienced a stunning transformation in a remarkably brief period of time.\nBetween 1970 and 1985, it completed a huge array of modern infrastructure projects\nincluding highways, ports, electric power networks, universities, powerplants, housing\ndevelopments, and hospitals, and it massively increased the social welfare benefits\nprovided to the Saudi people. Faisal did not survive to see the success of the economic-\ndevelopment plans that he had launched, however. Shot by one his nephews as\nrevenge for the death of a sibling during demonstrations against the introduction of\ntelevision in the 1960s, he died in 1975. Thus, it was his brothers and successors,\nKhalid (r. 1975-1982), and Fahd (r. 1982-2005), who, having continued his policies,\nreaped the fruit of his modernization program.35\nDifferences over Israel notwithstanding, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf principalities\nretained strong relations with the US in the 1970s. To a substantial degree, the\nperpetuation of close ties with Washington was a function of the oil producers\u2019\nperceived vulnerability. Concerned that the flood of wealth that they had begun\nreceiving had transformed them into tempting targets for foreign enemies, they sought\nthe security that only Washington could provide. Faisal led the way. Determined to\nensure his kingdom\u2019s security, he went to great lengths to maintain good relations with\nWashington. Even during the Yom Kippur War when ties between the two countries\nwere at a low ebb, for example, he took steps to minimize the breech and even went so\nfar as to secretly provide oil to the US Navy. Likewise, it was the Saudi king who\npersuaded the other Arab producer states to bring the oil embargo to an end in March\n1974.36\nMore broadly, aware that recessionary conditions in the developed world would\nultimately hurt the producing states, the Saudi king also agreed to help the US resolve\nthe balance-of-payments problem that the sudden rise in petroleum prices had caused.\nAccordingly, over the next few years, his government undertook a series of actions\ndesigned to repatriate a huge share of the petrodollars that it had acquired from the sale\nof oil in the US. It purchased American goods for its modernization effort, acquired\n$34 billion worth of arms from Washington, invested in businesses and real estate in the\nUnited States, and bought US government securities. These latter purchases were\nsubstantial. Indeed, by the end of the 1970s, the kingdom held more US debt than any\nother entity.37\n34 al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 124\u201327, 138; Wynbrandt, A Brief History of\nSaudi Arabia, 338.\n35 Wynbrandt, A Brief History of Saudi Arabia, 233\u201335.\n36 Yergin, The Prize, 606\u201332.\n37 al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 135\u201336; Bronson, Thicker Than Oil, 118\u201322. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 486\nWhile the close relationship with America may have helped secure Saudi Arabia\nfrom foreign dangers, it contributed to significant tensions within the kingdom. The\nproblem was the newly empowered Wahhabi \u02bfulama\u02be. As previously noted, Faisal had\nsought to legitimate the regime and to mute opposition to modernization in part by\nembracing religion. Central to this campaign was his effort to secure the support of the\nreligious scholars. To do so, he had put them on the state payroll, ceded domestic\npower to them, given them control of higher education, and lavished revenue on their\nefforts to spread Wahhabism abroad. For a time, this strategy seemed to work.\nSupported by ample state funds, the \u02bfulama\u02be largely refrained from criticizing the royal\nfamily and instead focused on spreading their severe construction of Islam both to\npeople within the kingdom\u2014particularly the hundreds of thousands of Arab guest\nworkers who lived in Saudi Arabia\u2014and, more broadly, to Muslims across the globe.38\nBy the mid 1970s, however, Faisal\u2019s effort to secure the support of the religious\nscholars had begun to boomerang. Though they appreciated the state\u2019s largesse, the\nWahhabi \u02bfulama\u02be increasingly recoiled at the kingdom\u2019s close relationship with the US\nand at the Saudi princes\u2019 over-the-top lifestyles and began to doubt the regime\u2019s\ncommitment to the Islamic values it claimed to espouse. As a result, even as the\nWahhabi \u02bfulama\u02be were using the government\u2019s substantial financial assistance to\nspread extreme Islamist and jihadist ideas throughout the Arab world\u2014particularly, as\nwe shall see, in Egypt\u2014they were also quietly fostering domestic opposition to a state\nthat many religious scholars had come to conclude was not adhering to the tenets of\nWahhabism. Indeed, unbeknownst to the Saudis, Wahhabi ideas had given birth to a\nsecretive, insurgent Islamist movement within the kingdom. Led by a man who claimed\nto be the Mahdi, the group had emerged out of the Religious University of Medina\u2014\nwhere, not coincidentally, members of Egypt\u2019s uncompromising Muslim Brotherhood\nhad found sanctuary\u2014and had, in the late 1970s, quietly begun to plot the overthrow of\nthe Saudi government.39\nTurkey: Democracy and Its Discontents\nFor the Republic of Turkey, the period between 1945 and 1980 was one of both\ntumult and continuity. During that time, the country experienced dramatic changes\nincluding the transition from a single-party state to a multiparty democracy, the rise of\npolitical extremism on both the right and left, substantial, if uneven, economic growth,\nand tremendous social and demographic change including rapid urbanization. At the\nsame time, however, the military\u2019s assumption of an extraconstitutional role as the\nguarantor of both Kemalism and political stability ensured that postwar Turkey enjoyed\nsubstantial continuity with the values and ideas of the early republic.\n38 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 330\u201332.\n39 al-Rasheed, A History of Saudi Arabia, 135\u201336, 142\u201344; Gerges, Making the Arab\nWorld, 330\u201332. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 487\nThe Transition to Multiparty Democracy, 1945-1980\nAt the end of the Second World War, Turkish President Ismet Inonu (r. 1938-\n1950) and the Republican People\u2019s Party (RPP) that had ruled the country since the\nearly 1920s found themselves in a difficult position. They had successfully navigated the\nchallenging diplomatic waters of the war years but had done so only by pursuing\npolicies that alienated three key components of the Kemalist political coalition: the urban\nbourgeoisie, government administrators, and the large landowners of rural Turkey. The\nbureaucrats had seen inflation destroy the purchasing power of their salaries thanks to\nthe expansion of the money supply required to pay for a bigger military, the large\nlandowners had endured costly price caps on agricultural products, and the bourgeoisie\nhad suffered under confiscatory wartime taxes. By 1945, as a result, these influential\nparts of the ruling party\u2019s base had quietly begun to demand fundamental political\nchanges.40\nThis discontent set the stage for the liberalization of Turkey\u2019s political system\nimmediately following World War II. The process started when four dissident members\nof the assembly including future prime minister Adnan Menderes (1899-1961) and\nfuture president Celal Bayar (r. 1950-1960) openly opposed a land-reform bill, arguing\nthat it would weaken faith in the government\u2019s commitment to private property and thus\ndiscourage investment. Though the law passed over their objections, Menderes and his\ncolleagues remained undaunted. They followed their defeat by calling for political\nliberalization and full democracy. These demands were too much for the RPP. It\nresponded by kicking Menderes and two fellow dissidents out of the party\u2014a move that\nappeared to doom their push to liberalize Turkey. Salvation came from an unexpected\nsource. In a dramatic speech at the opening of the assembly in November 1945,\nPresident Inonu rescued the liberalization drive by calling for a gradual transition to full\ndemocracy. Having been given a second political life, Menderes and Bayar followed by\nofficially establishing the republic\u2019s first meaningful opposition party, the Democratic\nParty (DP), in January 1946.41\nThe creation of the DP shook up the political system. Appealing directly to groups\nlike the bourgeoisie, the landlords, and the peasants, the new party amassed an\nenthusiastic following and made a good showing in elections held in May 1946. The\nDP\u2019s success deeply alarmed the leaders of the RPP. Worried that they might continue\nto lose support, they responded by coopting the Democratic Party\u2019s main policy\nproposals. They jettisoned the latest five-year plan in favor of a free-market approach\ndesigned to appease the bourgeoisie, devalued the Turkish currency\u2014the lira\u2014and\nmoved to weaken support for the DP among the religiously minded peasantry by\nallowing schools to teach religion once again. These changes seemed to work. Coupled\nwith the defection of a number of DP assembly members to the newly formed Nation\n40 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 206\u20138.\n41 Z\u00fcrcher, 209\u201312. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 488\nParty in 1948, the new policies put the RPP in a commanding position going into the\n1950 election.42\nThe DP\u2019s upset victory thus came as a startling surprise. In what amounted to an\nelectoral revolution, the party won 54 percent of the vote and an overwhelming majority\nin the assembly. It was a shocking upset\u2014one that led the RPP and its allies to\nconsider a variety of responses to its rival\u2019s success. Indeed, the military leadership\neven quietly proposed staging a coup. To his credit, however, Inonu decided to respect\nthe wishes of the voters and declined the offer. As a result, for the first time since its\nformation, the party that had secured the country\u2019s independence and territorial integrity\nafter the Great War had lost its monopoly on power. Turkey had become a genuine\nmulti-party democracy.43\nThe Democratic Party in Power, 1950-1960\nThanks to its promotion of policies that appealed to its business and especially\nrural constituencies, the Democratic Party enjoyed widespread popularity during its first\nfew years in power. Under Menderes, who served as prime minister, its key reforms fell\ninto two areas. First, while the DP retained a broad commitment to secularism, it also\neased some of Kemalism\u2019s more extreme restrictions on religion. It ended the ban on\nmaking the call to prayer in Arabic, endorsed teaching Islam in public schools, and\npermitted religious broadcasts on the radio. Second, it instituted a series of sweeping\neconomic changes designed to liberalize the economy and to encourage the agricultural\nsector. It established the Turkish Industrial Development Bank to loan state funds to\ncapitalists, gave farmers easy credit from the Agricultural Bank, maintained high wheat\nprices, and, with the help of the Marshall Plan, facilitated the \u201c\u2018tractorization\u2019\u201d of\nagriculture through the importation of American farm equipment. The results were\nimpressive. Benefitting from good weather and a 50 percent increase in the amount of\nland under cultivation, the economy grew at a12 percent clip during the early 1950s.44\nEconomic growth translated into continued success at the polls for Menderes and\nthe Democratic Party during the 1950s. Boosted by the booming agricultural sector, the\nDP cruised to an easy victory in the 1954 elections. It won 58 percent of the vote to the\nRPP\u2019s 35 percent\u2014giving the Democrats 503 seats in the assembly as compared to a\nmere 31 for the Republicans. The DP did not fare as well in elections held in 1957,\nhowever. That year, it won just 47 percent of the vote while the RPP\u2019s share rose to\n41 percent. Still, since the Turkish political system rewarded the leading party with a\ndisproportionate share of assembly seats, the DP retained a tight grip on power.45\n42 Howard, The History of Turkey, 118\u201319.\n43 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 217\u201318.\n44 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 307, 325; Howard, The History of\nTurkey, 120.\n45 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 223\u201324, 231\u201332. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 489\nThe precipitous decline in support for Menderes and the DP in 1957 stemmed\nlargely from Turkey\u2019s worsening economic circumstances. Resting as it did on the\ncontinued importation of tractors and other agricultural equipment, the growth that had\nboosted the party in the early 1950s had produced a steadily rising balance-of-\npayments deficit. By 1958, the bill finally came due. Desperate for an infusion of\nadditional foreign cash, Prime Minister Menderes\u2019s government was forced to agree to\nimplement a series of harsh austerity reforms in exchange for a $359 million IMF\nstabilization loan. The resulting economic pain fueled growing opposition to the DP\u2014\nparticularly among urbanites, who saw the purchasing power of their salaries eroded by\ninflation, and among farmers, who no longer enjoyed favorable treatment from the\ngovernment.46\nMenderes\u2019s increasingly heavy-handed political repression also contributed to\nthe DP\u2019s declining popularity. Taking a page from the RPP, his party freely used the\npower of the state against its political rivals. Most notably, shortly after taking control of\nthe government, the prime minister had ordered the treasury to confiscate property that\nthe RPP had obtained when it had controlled the state in the 1930s. After its big victory\nin 1954, the DP went even further. It implemented changes to the electoral system that\nimposed new burdens on the opposition and passed a law that permitted the\ngovernment to force long-tenured RPP bureaucrats, judges, and academics to take\nearly retirement. Later, as its political position weakened, the DP embraced outright\nilliberalism\u2014organizing a parliamentary commission to investigate the RPP and banning\nthe party\u2019s representatives from sitting in parliament.47\nThe Coup of 1960\nThis last action was too much for the military. Alarmed by the DP\u2019s increasingly\nautocratic actions and, more importantly, by its deviation from Kemalism, a group of\nmilitary officers launched a coup on May 27, 1960. Citing the need \u201c\u2018to prevent fratricide\u2019\nand to \u2018extricate the parties from the irreconcilable situation into which they had fallen,\u2019\u201d\nthe coup\u2019s leader, Colonel Alparslan Turkes (1917-1997), announced over the radio that\nthe army had assumed control of the state. The junta promptly closed parliament,\nsuspended the constitution, named a popular general as head of state, and established\na new body, the National Unity Committee (NUC), to run the country until a new\nconstitution could be drawn up and new elections held. They also outlawed the DP and\narrested all of the party\u2019s assembly members including Menderes and Bayar.48\nDiffering visions of Turkey\u2019s future soon split the NUC into radical and\nconservative factions. The key issues dividing the body were the duration of military rule\nand the extent of the reforms that the coup leaders intended to put in place. Led by\nTurkes, the radical faction wanted the military to rule for a long period so that it could\nimpose a top-down political and cultural revolution designed to turn Turkey into an\n46 Z\u00fcrcher, 228\u201330.\n47 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 306\u20139.\n48 Howard, The History of Turkey, 125\u201326, 134. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 490\nauthoritarian state along the lines of Nasser\u2019s Egypt. The rival conservatives instead\ncalled for a quick end to military rule and for a limited series of reforms aimed at\nensuring the perpetuation of Kemalism and at preventing future political parties from\nabusing power as the DP had. For a time, the two factions coexisted uneasily in the\nNUC. The balance tilted irrevocably toward the conservatives, however, after the\nradicals undertook a purge in the army in August. Alienating many moderate officers\nheretofore unaffiliated with either faction, this move left Turkes and his supporters so\nisolated that the conservatives were able to force them from the NUC in November\n1960.49\nHaving dealt with the radicals, the conservative faction then moved to revamp\nTurkey\u2019s political system and to implement a new constitution. They did so in hopes of\nachieving two overarching goals. First, they wanted to prevent future political parties\nfrom trampling basic rights as the DP had. Accordingly, they devoted fully one third of\nthe new constitution to provisions assuring civil liberties such as the independence of\nthe media and the right to collective bargaining. Second, they sought to ensure the\nperpetuation of the Kemalist revolution. To do so, they strengthened the judiciary,\ncreated a bicameral legislature, and established a new institution, the State Planning\nOrganization (SPO), to coordinate economic development through a series of five-year\nplans modeled on the etatist practices of the 1930s. Most importantly, they created a\nnew executive body called the National Security Council (NSC). Composed of the\npresident, the chief of the general staff, and the heads of the service branches, it\nadvised the government on national security issues. Its remit did not remain confined to\nmatters of defense for long, however. Instead, through a process of bureaucratic\nmission creep wherein its members perceived a growing range of topics to be relevant\nto national security, the NSC soon became an enormously influential body\u2014one that\nensured a powerful voice for the Kemalist officers in the new government.50\nEstablishing the Second Republic, the coup of 1960 marked a watershed\nmoment in Turkey\u2019s political development. Not only did it break the DP\u2019s grip on power,\nbut it also set two lasting precedents. First, it established that the military had an\nextraconstitutional right to take control of the state if the politicians abused power or\nstrayed too far from the Kemalist legacy. Second, the coup set the standard that future\nmilitary involvement in politics would be temporary and that the officers would return\npower to the civilian government as soon as feasible.51\nThe Second Republic, 1960-1980\nThe performance of the economy during the early years of the Second Republic\nseemed to validate the coup. Under the direction of the SPO, Turkey shifted away from\nthe DP\u2019s emphasis on private enterprise and back to the etatist, Import Substitution\nIndustrialization (ISI) approach that had shaped the Turkish economy during the heyday\n49 Howard, 134\u201335.\n50 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 245; Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 311.\n51 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 310. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 491\nof Kemalism in the 1930s. There was one substantial difference, however. This time,\nthe drivers of economic growth were private firms rather than state-controlled\noperations. Sheltered by protective tariffs and ensured access to imported raw materials\nthrough the maintenance of an artificially strong lira, the powerful, oligopolistic\ncorporations that emerged in the 1960s quickly came to thoroughly dominate the\nTurkish economy. For a time, they led an impressive expansion. Indeed, to the\nsatisfaction of the officers who had overseen the creation of the Second Republic,\neconomic growth averaged an impressive 6.9 percent per year between 1963 and\n1967.52\nThe coup leaders were far-less pleased with the political system that emerged\nduring the early years of the Second Republic, however. Their frustration began with the\nfirst post-coup election in the fall of 1961. While Inonu\u2019s RPP won the election as they\nhad hoped, it secured the backing of just 37 percent of the electorate, while parties that\ndrew support from the same groups that had backed the now-outlawed Democratic\nParty took 49 percent of the votes cast. This suggested both the continued appeal of the\nDP\u2019s platform, and the depth and breadth of popular opposition to the coup. Inonu did\nmanage to oversee several RPP-dominated coalition governments in the early 1960s,\nbut those governments were shaky and the RPP was never able to find its footing.\nInstead, to the chagrin of the military it was seven-time Prime Minister and future\nPresident Suleyman Demirel\u2019s (1924-2015), center-right Justice Party (JP) that would\nemerge as the dominant political force during the Second Republic.53\nMore troublingly from the perspective of the military, the mainstream parties no\nlonger enjoyed a monopoly on political power in Turkey. Instead, thanks to rapid\ndemographic growth and, ironically, the liberal constitution that the officers had put in\nplace, new, extremist political movements of both right and left proliferated in the\ndecade following the coup. Inspired by Marxist writings and by the transnational,\nantiestablishment zeitgeist of the 1960s, leftist movements won a following among\nuniversity students and Turkey\u2019s small-but-growing working class. These organizations\ngrew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s but failed to make substantial\npolitical inroads in part because they splintered along ideological fault lines. For\nexample, the Marxist Federation of the Revolutionary Youth acrimoniously split at the\nbeginning of the 1970s into competing Guevarist and Maoist factions. In contrast, the\nfar-right ultranationalist groups that developed in the 1960s\u2014including, most notably,\nAlparslan Turkes\u2019s National Action Party (NAP)\u2014enjoyed substantial coherence and\nunity.54\nPredictably, the rise of extremist political organizations produced violence and\ninstability. Inspired by the dramatic global revolutionary events of 1968 such as the Tet\nOffensive in Vietnam and the French student revolt in Paris, far-left organizations began\nto engage in aggressive political acts such as seizing control of Istanbul University and\n52 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 264\u201366.\n53 Howard, The History of Turkey, 137\u201339.\n54 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 314\u201315. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 492\noccupying a tire factory. They grew substantially bolder and more militant in the early\n1970s. Over the course of the decade, far-left groups organized guerilla movements,\nrobbed banks, and kidnapped American military personnel as part of their effort to\noverthrow the state. Furious, the ultranationalists did not permit these actions to go\nunchallenged. Instead, with the tacit support of Demirel\u2019s government, rightist militias\nsuch as the NAP-affiliated Gray Wolves joined the state\u2019s security apparatus in\naggressively combatting leftist violence.55\nFed up with the volatility and the Marxist threat to Turkey\u2019s political system, the\nmilitary moved to restore order in 1971. In what became known as the Coup by\nMemorandum, the chief of staff gave Prime Minister Demirel a letter in March 1971\nindicating that the army would once more assume power if the government did not\nimplement sweeping reforms and \u201c\u2018neutralize the current anarchical situation\u2019\u201d\u2014a threat\nthat impelled Demirel to promptly resign. The officers followed by moving to curtail the\nleftist challenge. Declaring martial law, the NSC directed a brutal and far-reaching\ncrackdown on leftist organizations and pressured the assembly to approve a series of\nconstitutional amendments designed to prevent further disorder. They included curbs on\nthe autonomy of the universities, restrictions on press freedoms, and limits on the\nindependence and power of the courts. Ironically, in other words, the same officers who\nhad so insistently enshrined civil liberties in the constitution of 1961 were now, just a\ndecade later, acting to place severe limits on those very rights.56\nTurkish Foreign Policy\nThe story of Turkey\u2019s diplomatic relations between 1945 and 1980 was far-more\nstraightforward than the course of its anarchic internal political system. Its foreign policy\nduring that time centered on achieving two overarching goals. First, in conjunction with\nthe United States, it worked to prevent the USSR from expanding its influence into the\nMiddle East. Second, it sought to ensure that Britain\u2019s majority-Greek colony of Cyprus\nwould become a separate state rather than a province of Greece when it won\nindependence and that its government would respect the rights of the island\u2019s Turkish\nminority. For the most part, these goals were in harmony. Coming into conflict in the\n1970s, however, they briefly drove a wedge between Washington and Ankara.57\nTurkey was an early partner in America\u2019s effort to contain the Soviet Union. As\nwe have seen, Washington had worked closely with Ankara to foil Joseph Stalin\u2019s\n(r. 1928-1953) effort to gain control of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits in 1946 and\nhad made Turkey a recipient of American military and economic aid through the Truman\nDoctrine the following year. The relationship became even closer when Turkey joined\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952. Assuming the role of an\n\u201c\u2018unsinkable aircraft carrier\u2019\u201d for the United States, it thereafter hosted combat jets, U-2\nspy planes, and\u2014until President John F. Kennedy (r. 1961-1963) removed them\n55 Findley, 315\u201316.\n56 Howard, The History of Turkey, 147\u201348.\n57 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 208\u20139, 234\u201337. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 493\nfollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014Jupiter nuclear missiles. Despite acrimony over the\nwithdrawal of the rockets, Turkey remained a committed and faithful partner in\nWashington\u2019s containment policy.58\nA crisis stemming from the decolonization of the island of Cyprus would threaten\nthat relationship, however. In the early 1950s, the Cypriots had entered into negotiations\nwith London aimed at ending British rule of the island. Two factors complicated those\ntalks. First, the population of Cyprus was divided uneasily between a Greek majority\nthat lived largely in the south and a Turkish minority\u2014about 20 percent of the\npopulation\u2014that predominated on the island\u2019s north side. Second, under their\nnationalist leader, the Archbishop Makarios (r. 1960-1977), the Greek Cypriots were\npushing for enosis, or union with Greece, rather than independence.59\nThe possibility of Cyprus joining Greece was unacceptable to the Turkish\ngovernment. It feared that enosis would both imperil the rights of the Turkish Cypriot\nminority and present Ankara with a serious strategic dilemma should it find itself in a\nconflict with Athens. Accordingly, the Turkish government first successfully pressured\nBritain into making Cyprus an independent state rather than a part of Greece and then\nensured that the new state\u2019s constitution guaranteed the civil and political rights of the\nisland\u2019s Turkish minority. Despite a push among Greek Cypriots to curtail those\nassurances following the country\u2019s independence in 1960 and an outburst of\nintercommunal violence in 1964, relative calm prevailed during Cyprus\u2019s first decade.\nThus, by the early 1970s, it appeared to casual observers that the island had put ethnic\nconflict behind it and that it was well on its way to becoming a stable, multi-ethnic\nnation-state.60\nEvents soon made clear that such conclusions were wildly inaccurate. Rather\nthan continuing to come together as a unified polity, Cyprus would instead shatter along\nethnic lines in 1974. The cause was the continued desire among Greek-Cypriot\nultranationalists to achieve enosis. Intent on securing that goal, extremists in the Cypriot\nNational Guard deposed Makarios in 1974 and\u2014with the encouragement of the military\njunta then ruling Greece\u2014declared their commitment to immediate union. The Turkish\ngovernment reacted aggressively to this precipitate action. Viewing the move as both a\nserious threat to its national security interests and as an unacceptable violation of the\ncivil and political rights of the Turkish Cypriots, it responded by deploying troops to the\npredominantly Turkish northern half of the island in July. The landing dramatically\nenflamed the situation and sparked the start of a sustained campaign of ethnic\ncleansing across Cyprus that resulted in the flight of Greek Cypriots to the south and\nTurkish Cypriots to the north. Ankara followed by formally partitioning the island and by\nestablishing a Turkish Cypriot government in the territory its troops occupied. That state\n58 Herring, From Colony to Superpower, 609, 614\u201315; Howard, The History of Turkey,\n128\u201329, 145; quote from Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 309.\n59 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 237\u201338.\n60 Z\u00fcrcher, 237\u201338. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 494\ngained nominal independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983;\nhowever, Ankara was the only government to recognize it.61\nThe intervention in Cyprus may have been popular among Turkish nationalists,\nbut it sparked a growing rift between Washington and Ankara. Angry at Turkey\u2019s\nprecipitate move, congress responded by promptly imposing a sweeping embargo on\nmilitary aid. The American move did little to restrain Turkey, however. Instead, furious at\nwhat it saw as unwanted interference in a Turkish domestic issue, Ankara retaliated by\nimmediately shutting all American military facilities in Turkey save for the NATO airbase\nat Incirlik. The rift was not merely deep but also long lasting. Pressured by Greek-\nAmerican and Armenian-American lobbying groups, congress did not lift its ban on the\nprovision of military aid to Turkey until July 1978. Only then did bilateral relations begin\na gradual thaw.62\nThe 1980 Turkish Coup D\u2019etat\nIn the meantime, Turkey experienced mounting domestic economic and political\nchallenges over the course of the 1970s. The country\u2019s economic woes had two\nsources. First, while it had enjoyed high growth during the \u201c\u2018easy\u2019\u201d period of ISI\ndevelopment when domestic demand for consumer goods remained unmet, it had, by\nthe early 1970s, entered the \u201c\u2018hard\u2019\u201d phase during which it was unable to shift to an\nexport-oriented growth strategy\u2014and thus offset plateauing internal demand\u2014owing to\nthe fact that its protected industries were too inefficient to compete in global markets.\nSecond, the revolution in oil prices that occurred in 1973 proved peculiarly challenging\nfor developing states such as Turkey that depended on imported petroleum for\ncontinued economic growth. Indeed, thanks to the quadrupling of crude prices in 1973,\nTurkey was soon spending an astonishing two-thirds of its foreign-currency earnings on\nimported oil and thus had only limited reserves with which to purchase imported capital\nequipment. Unwilling to abandon its expansionary policies, the government responded\nby accepting a dramatic increase in its external debt and by dealing with the resulting\nbalance-of-payment problems by increasing the money supply. This approach worked\nfor a time, but, coupled with the rise in fuel prices that followed the Iranian Revolution, it\nalso pushed inflation to an unsustainable 90 percent in 1979.63\nDespite an accompanying declaration of martial law and an intensive crackdown\non leftist organizations, meanwhile, the Coup by Memorandum had failed to restore\nstability to the political system. Two problems stood out. First, thanks to the mainstream\nparties\u2019 unwillingness to work with each other and their inability to secure outright\nmajorities, small parties\u2014particularly far-right ones\u2014found themselves in a position to\nwield influence well beyond what their numbers justified. For example, Turkes\u2019s NAP\nwas able to translate the paltry three seats it held in the assembly in 1975 into two\n61 Z\u00fcrcher, 275\u201376.\n62 Howard, The History of Turkey, 151.\n63 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 267; Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 329. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 495\ncabinet posts thanks to its ability to give Demirel the slim majority he needed to form a\ngovernment.64\nSecond, the late 1970s witnessed a return to the political instability and violence\nthat had marked the early part of the decade. The resurgence of bloodshed began in\nMay 1977 when clashes between police and demonstrators during a May Day parade\nresulted in thirty-nine deaths and a retaliatory bombing campaign by leftists. The\nfollowing year, the murder of the retired rector of Istanbul Technical University created\nfears of worsening political disorder, while five-days of confessional conflict between\nSunnis and Alevis\u2014a mystical variant of Twelver Shi\u02bfism\u2014raised the specter of\nsustained religious clashes. The situation deteriorated rapidly from that point. All told,\npolitical violence claimed the lives of 5,000 people between January 1978 and\nSeptember 1980\u2014a wave of violence that made clear that the civilian government had\nlost its ability to maintain order. In response, the military once again stepped in\u2014\norchestrating a bloodless coup in September 1980 that finally brought the tumultuous\nSecond Republic to an end.65\nIran: From Coup to Revolution\nIran had a far-more difficult time after World War II than did Turkey. That it did so\nis perhaps surprising in light of the country\u2019s enormous oil reserves and the significant\ngrowth it experienced under the rule of the shah. After all, a rising standard of living is\ntypically associated with political stability. Such was not the case in Iran, however.\nRather than producing political and social stability in the country, the economic\nexpansion served merely to mask seething, broad-based discontent with the regime\u2014\ndissatisfaction, ironically, that the rapid, oil-fueled process of growth helped to create.\nTamped down for many years, that pent-up resentment would burst forth in a sudden\npolitical deluge in the late 1970s that would, in an astonishingly brief period of time, first\nsweep aside the shah\u2019s regime and then establish a purportedly traditional, but\nultimately revolutionary new state under the firm dominance of the Shi\u02bfi clerical\nestablishment.\nThe Nationalist Challenge, 1950-1953\nThe early years of Muhammad Reza\u2019s reign would prove pivotal in setting the\nstage for the revolution. Two issues dominated Iran at that time. The first was the\nquestion of who would rule. Would it be the young shah, whom the Allies had place on\nthe throne in 1941 and who enjoyed the backing of the armed forces? Or would it\ninstead be the majlis, the Iranian parliament, which the rural notables dominated? The\nsecond issue revolved around the question of who would control the country\u2019s oil\nresources and receive the lion\u2019s share of the revenue from its sale. Would it be the\nBritish-owned AIOC, which earned far-more profit and paid far-more in taxes to the\nBritish government than it provided in royalties to Iran, or would it instead be the\n64 Findley, Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity, 317\u201318.\n65 Howard, The History of Turkey, 153\u201354. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 496\ngovernment in Tehran and, by extension, the Iranian people that earned the majority of\nthe profits?66\nThese two issues would come together at the end of the 1940s to profoundly\nshape the trajectory of Iran\u2019s political development. Initially, the shah appeared to hold\nthe upper hand in the struggle for political dominance. Emboldened by a failed\nassassination attempt in February 1949, the heretofore weak monarch acted to\ncentralize power in his hands by declaring martial law and by taking an active role in the\ndirection of the country for the first time. He followed by pursuing negotiations aimed at\nreplacing the 1932 agreement between Iran and the AIOC with a new one patterned\nafter the far-more-generous fifty-fifty deal that Venezuela had obtained in 1943. It was a\nbold initiative\u2014one that if successful would not only increase the amount of revenue\nthat his government received each year but would also boost his nationalist credentials\nto such a degree that he would be able to fully restore the power that the monarchy had\nlost when the Allies had deposed his father.67\nThe AIOC was unreceptive to the shah\u2019s proposal, however. On the contrary, the\ncompany indicated that it was willing to agree to no more than comparatively modest\nrevisions to the existing system of royalty payments. Given the disparity in power\nbetween his state and the British-government-controlled AIOC, the shah felt that he had\nlittle choice but to accept the company\u2019s offer; accordingly, he soon signed what came\nto be known as the Supplemental Agreement. He was far-from disappointed with the\nnew arrangement, however. Instead, believing that the deal was enough for him to\nsecure the nationalist credentials needed to consolidate his dominance of the\ngovernment, he was more than satisfied with the terms that the British offered. There\nremained one substantial complication, however: the new understanding with the AIOC\nwould not go into effect until the majlis had approved it.68\nUnfortunately for the shah, the emergence in 1949 of a powerful new opposition\nmovement prevented him from securing the legislature\u2019s formal endorsement of the\nSupplemental Agreement. It was led by an elderly notable named Mohammad\nMossadegh (1882-1967). A strong nationalist and proponent of democratic rule,\nMossadegh had long been a prominent figure in Iran. He had participated in the\nConstitutional Revolution, held office as a majlis deputy, and served as a cabinet\nminister until Shah Reza Kahn (r. 1925-1941) forced him into a long internal exile.69\nHis time in the political wilderness ended in spectacular fashion just after the\nshah\u2019s government revealed the terms of the Supplemental Agreement. Opposed to the\nshah\u2019s power grab and to any deal with the AIOC that gave Iran less than 50 percent of\nthe profits, he organized and launched a series of mass popular demonstrations in\nOctober 1949 that directly challenged both of the dominant power centers in the country\n66 Keddie, Modern Iran, 123\u201324.\n67 Yergin, The Prize, 452\u201354.\n68 Abrahamian, The Coup, 46\u201348; Yergin, The Prize, 452\u201354.\n69 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 114. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 497\nat that time: the shah and the British. He followed by establishing a new, populist\npolitical party called the National Front. Mossadegh\u2019s actions immediately reshaped the\nbalance of political power in Iran. Drawing support from a broad range of groups that\nincluded the Westernized middle class, the bazaar merchants, many leftists, and the\nfollowers of the influential Ayatollah Abol Ghasem Kashani (1882-1962), the party gave\nMossadegh the strength to block approval of the Supplemental Agreement in the majlis.\nIt also provided him with the institutional basis needed to mobilize people in support of a\nslate of far-reaching goals that included free elections, the suspension of martial law,\nstrict royal adherence to the 1906 constitution and, to\u2014great popular acclaim\u2014the\nnationalization of the AIOC.70\nFrom that point, he had little trouble dealing with the inexperienced shah. Taking\nadvantage of the chaos that followed the assassination of Prime Minister Ali Razmara\n(r. 1950-1951) in March 1951, he succeeded in persuading the majlis to approve his\nnationalization plan and to name him prime minister. He solidified his position the\nfollowing summer by luring Muhammad Reza into a political blunder. It started when\nMossadegh demanded that the shah cede to him the power to name the minister of\ndefense\u2014a change that would give him control over the military. The shah\u2019s refusal to\ndo so prompted Mossadegh to resign; thus, for a brief period, it appeared that\nMuhammad Reza\u2019s steadfastness had allowed him to reassert royal control. In fact, the\nshah had fallen into a well-planned trap. At Mossadegh\u2019s behest, the National Front and\nthe communist Tudeh Party responded by holding massive demonstrations in Tehran\nthat quickly compelled the young monarch to back down. Thereafter, Mossadegh, who\nhad resumed his post as prime minister and assumed the defense portfolio, ruled Iran\nalmost without challenge.71\nHaving subordinated the shah, the prime minister next set his sights on the\nBritish. Determined to take control of Iran\u2019s oil, he followed the passage of the\nnationalization bill in the majlis by seizing the oilfields and by announcing his desire to\nenter into talks with the British aimed at determining how much Iran would have to pay\nAIOC shareholders as compensation for the nationalization of the company\u2019s assets.\nThe British government did not prove to be as easily intimidated as the young shah had\nbeen, however. Determined to retain control over Iran\u2019s oilfields, it steadfastly refused to\naccept nationalization or to discuss compensation and indicated that it was willing to\nnegotiate only over the size of Iran\u2019s royalty payments and not over ownership or\ncontrol. To show it meant business, it simultaneously undertook a series of aggressive\nactions designed to force Tehran to back down. It brought suit against Iran in the World\nCourt, beefed up its military forces in the Persian Gulf, froze Iranian assets, and\nimposed a blockade designed to prevent Mossadegh\u2019s government from selling oil. It\nalso waged an aggressive and racist propaganda campaign designed to damage\n70 Abrahamian, The Coup, 48\u201357; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 114.\n71 Amanat, Iran, 525\u201341. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 498\nMossadegh\u2019s reputation in the West by painting him as an emotional and irrational\nman.72\nThe Iranian prime minister was taken aback by these nakedly imperialist actions\nand appealed to the United States for aid. He got precious little support for his troubles.\nOfficials in the Truman administration were not unsympathetic to Iran and did take steps\nto try to bridge the divide between London and Tehran. At the same time, however, they\nwere disinclined to undermine the position of a key Cold War ally and concerned that\nthe nationalization of the oil concession in Iran might encourage other countries in the\nDeveloping World to follow suit. Accordingly, Washington focused not on getting London\nto accept Mossadegh\u2019s action, but instead on an ill-conceived\u2014and ultimately\nunsuccessful\u2014campaign to find the right mix of verbiage and enhanced profit sharing\nthat would allow Mossadegh to accept continued British control over Iran\u2019s oil.73\nOperation Ajax, 1953\nWith America refusing to take Tehran\u2019s side, London\u2019s strategy of pressuring Iran\nappeared to be bearing fruit in early 1953. Increased unemployment, rising inflation\nresulting from the Iranian prime minister\u2019s decision to continue to pay the country\u2019s idle\noil workers, and a general economic slowdown stemming from the British blockade\neroded support for the National Front. Likewise, Mossadegh\u2019s growing reliance on\nextraconstitutional methods such as his move to suspend voting midway through\nelections in 1952 alienated many of his allies including Kashani\u2014a loss of support that\nhis increasingly close relationship with the Tudeh Party only partially counterbalanced.74\nThese problems would grievously erode Mossadegh\u2019s support, but it was a shift\nin American policy that would ultimately do him in. The change was in part a function of\nelectoral politics. As we have seen, the Truman administration had sought to maintain at\nleast a public neutrality in the crisis. The administration of Truman\u2019s successor, Dwight\nEisenhower (r. 1953-1961) had no such compunction. Instead, fearing that\nMossadegh\u2019s reliance on the Tudeh had undermined his ability to resist Soviet\nsubversion, it adopted an explicitly pro-British line. It urged Mossadegh to accept a\ncompromise solution that came nowhere near to meeting Iran\u2019s minimum conditions and\nrefused Tehran\u2019s request for a desperately needed loan. The president went much\nfurther in the late spring of 1953. Fearing the Tudeh Party\u2019s rising influence, he\ninstructed the CIA to foment a coup aimed at removing Mossadegh from power and at\ninstalling the pro-Western shah as the dominant political force in the country.75\nDirection of the coup\u2014codenamed Operation AJAX\u2014fell to former President\nTheodore Roosevelt\u2019s (r. 1901-1909) grandson, the CIA agent, Kermit \u201cKim\u201d Roosevelt\n72 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 117.\n73 Herring, From Colony to Superpower, 672; Abrahamian, The Coup, 82, 113\u201317, 132\u2013\n33.\n74 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 235\u201336; Keddie, Modern Iran, 129.\n75 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 160\u201364. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 499\n(1916-2000). A covert-operations veteran, he devised a plan in the early summer of\n1953 to restore the shah and remove Mossadegh from power. It called for Imperial\nGuard troops to deliver a firman, or royal decree, to the prime minister dismissing him\nfrom office and naming General Fazlollah Zahedi (1892-1963) as his successor.\nConcurrently, other units loyal to the shah would arrest National Front leaders, seize\nkey sites in Iran including the telegraph office and the radio station, and occupy\nstrategic positions in the capital so as to prevent a repeat of the mass demonstrations\nthat had thwarted the shah\u2019s attempt to dismiss Mossadegh in the summer of 1952. It\nwas a well-developed operation\u2014albeit a nakedly colonialist one\u2014and the\nadministration quickly approved it. Accordingly, in July Roosevelt entered Iran by car\nfrom Iraq with a can-do attitude and a briefcase full of cash.76\nOperation AJAX may have been a sound plan on paper, but it flopped badly\nwhen royalist forces tried to execute it on August 15. Tipped off by an informer,\nMossadegh arranged for a large force of loyal troops to meet the unit sent to deliver the\nfirman to him and had its commander arrested. Meanwhile, he ordered other soldiers to\nprevent royalist forces from leaving their barracks. As a result, the coup collapsed\nbefore it had even started.77\nDespair and euphoria coexisted in Iran in the immediate aftermath of the failed\ncoup. On one side, Mossadegh\u2019s supporters were exuberant that the operation had\nflopped so badly. Huge crowds of National Front and, especially, Tudeh loyalists poured\ninto the streets the following day to celebrate what they saw as a great victory over\nIran\u2019s foreign and domestic enemies. On the other, the coup\u2019s demoralized supporters\nwere in complete disarray. The shah and his wife had fled by plane for what they\nbelieved would be permanent exile as soon as they had learned of Operation AJAX\u2019s\nfailure; many other coup plotters\u2014including Zahedi\u2014were forced to lie low to avoid\narrest. For its part, the Eisenhower administration could neither hide nor escape.\nInstead, it ordered Roosevelt to return home and glumly pondered how it could salvage\nits relationship with Mossadegh in hopes that he might continue to help the US contain\nSoviet influence in Iran.78\nRoosevelt, however, was not yet ready to abandon the operation. Instead,\nconfident that his network of Iranian assets remained intact, he hurriedly put in motion a\nnew plan designed to exploit Mossadegh\u2019s post-coup complacency. The operation\nunfolded in two phases. First, on August 18, the US ambassador persuaded\nMossadegh to have security forces clear the Tudeh mobs from the streets of Tehran by\nhinting that the US might withdraw its recognition of his government if he could not\nmaintain order. Confident that the royalists had been thoroughly routed, the prime\nminister agreed to do so immediately. Accordingly, later that day, army and police units\nforced thousands of Tudeh supporters to return to their homes. With the streets no\nlonger controlled by Mossadegh\u2019s defenders, the stage was now set for the second\n76 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 180\u201385; Yergin, The Prize, 468.\n77 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 165.\n78 Abrahamian, The Coup, 183\u201387. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 500\nphase of Roosevelt\u2019s improvised plan. Deftly exploiting London\u2019s contacts with key\nunderworld figures, he used the cash he brought with him to Iran to arrange for a pro-\nshah mob composed of toughs from the athletic clubs of south Tehran to begin\nrampaging through the capital on the morning of August 19. Predictably, Mossadegh\nordered the army to break up the riot. When he did, Roosevelt struck. He arranged to\nhave pro-shah units occupy the telephone-telegraph office, the military staff\nheadquarters, and the radio station. Most importantly, he directed a substantial force to\nlay siege to Mossadegh\u2019s home.79\nThe American CIA agent\u2019s ad-libbed plan was a complete success. By the end of\nthe day, pro-royalist forces held all key government ministries as well as the critical\ncommunications exchanges. More importantly, after a short and bloody firefight outside\nMossadegh\u2019s residence, they had arrested the prime minister. Three days later, a\ndelighted shah returned from Italy to reclaim his throne\u2014determined, this time, not\nmerely to reign but to rule Iran as an absolutist.80\nOperation AJAX had momentous consequences for Iran, Britain, and the United\nStates. For London, the results were mixed. On the surface, the AIOC\u2014renamed British\nPetroleum (BP) in 1954\u2014was in a significantly weaker position in Iran than it had been\nbefore the oil-nationalization dispute. It had not only been forced to agree to the fifty-fifty\nsplit in profits that had become standard throughout the world, but it had also been\ncompelled to accept a consortium arrangement in Iran in which it held only 40 percent of\nthe shares while Royal Dutch Shell, a group of American companies, and the\nCompagnie Fran\u00e7ais assumed the balance. Indeed, the outcome for Britain seemed to\nhave proven former Secretary of State Dean Acheson\u2019s (1893-1971) famous quip about\nthe standoff between London and Tehran to be true: \u201c\u2018[n]ever had so few lost so much\nso stupidly in so short a time.\u2019\u201d In truth, though, Britain\u2019s losses were far-less severe\nthan they appeared at first blush. Not only did it retain control over pricing and\nproduction decisions in Iran, but\u2014thanks to the fact that Royal Dutch Shell was really a\nBritish company\u2014it also continued to hold the dominant position in the consortium.81\nThe results of the coup were also ambiguous for Washington, though they did not\nappear to be so at the time. Indeed, so far as the Eisenhower administration was\nconcerned, the coup had been an enormous success. It replaced a figure whose Cold\nWar bona fides were in doubt with one of impeccable anticommunist credibility and had\ndone so at a minimal cost. As such, it appeared to be a great victory\u2014one that helped\nto institutionalize covert operations as a preferred tool of American foreign policy. The\ncoup\u2019s success ultimately proved to be short lived, however. With enormous\nconsequences, as we shall see, it permanently tarnished Washington\u2019s image in Iran\n79 Stephen Kinzer, All the Shah\u2019s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East\nTerror (New York: Wiley, 2003), 168\u201385.\n80 Wilford, America\u2019s Great Game, 166.\n81 Abrahamian, The Coup, 205\u201326; Acheson quote from Abrahamian, A History of\nModern Iran, 46\u201348. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 501\nand left many Iranians bitter at what they perceived to be a serious betrayal of both their\ncountry and American principles.82\nFor Iran, in contrast, the results were almost entirely adverse. Most obviously, by\nentrenching the autocratic shah in power, the coup severely set back efforts to\ninstitutionalize a system of representative government. It also grievously weakened the\nmoderate, secular opposition movements and thus created an opening that more\nextreme forces would later exploit. It had another, subtler implication as well.\nRoosevelt\u2019s ability to pull victory from the sure jaws of defeat led Iranians of all social\nclasses to conclude that the US\u2014especially the CIA\u2014had an almost-preternatural\nability to manipulate political events in Iran. As we shall see, that belief would play a key\nrole in shaping events during the Iranian Revolution.83\nWhere Historians Disagree: The Iran Coup\nWestern interpretations of the 1953 coup have traditionally emphasized the\nstrategic dimensions of the crisis. Locating the coup firmly within the structure of the\nCold War, scholars and writers have long maintained that Washington went forward with\nOperation AJAX out of fear that the USSR would exploit the chaos in Iran if it failed to\nact. For example, the journalist Robert Fisk argues that the Eisenhower administration\nundertook the coup because it was \u201cfearful that Mossadeq would hand his country to the\nSoviets\u201d if Iran secured control of its oil. In a similar vein, the political scientist Mark\nGasiorowski asserts that Washington moved to topple the Iranian prime minister not for\neconomic reasons but instead out of concern that his unwillingness to come to terms\nwith London could create the proper conditions for the communist Tudeh Party to take\ncontrol of Iran and bring it into the Soviet orbit.84\nIn recent years, the historian Ervand Abrahamian has forcefully challenged this\nunderstanding of the coup. Emphasizing economic rather than strategic considerations,\nhe repudiates the idea that Cold War concerns about potential communist inroads in\nIran shaped either Washington\u2019s decision to support Britain in the dispute or its\nwillingness to go forward with Operation AJAX. Instead, he contends that American\ninflexibility on the question of continued British control was a product of a desire to\nprevent the establishment of a precedent that could lead to the nationalization of\nWestern oil concessions in other developing states and that could thus threaten\nAmerican interests. As he asserts, Eisenhower was acting not out of concerns about\nSoviet inroads in Iran but instead out of fear of \u201cthe repercussions that oil nationalization\ncould have on such faraway places as Indonesia and South America.\u201d In other words, in\nAbrahamian\u2019s conception, the coup that deposed Mossadegh was not, at heart, an\n82 Herring, From Colony to Superpower, 672\u201373.\n83 Abrahamian, The Coup, 205\u201326.\n84 Fisk, The Great War for Civilisation, 95; Mark Gasiorowski, \u201cUS Foreign Relations\nToward Iran During the Mussadiq Era,\u201d in The Military and the United States: A\nHistorical and Political Reassessment, ed.

He immediately outlawed the\nNational Front and other opposition parties, arrested many of their leaders, and denied\nnon-regime-approved candidates the right to run for office. Later, he established a pair\nof parties so subservient to the throne that cynical Iranians referred to them as the \u201c\u2018yes\u2019\nand the \u2018yes, sir\u2019\u201d parties. Making liberal use of the regime\u2019s now-uncontested power, he\nalso ordered the police to destroy the Tudeh Party. This effort was not entirely\nsuccessful thanks to the party\u2019s robust, organizational structure; still, the campaign did\nsucceed in driving it underground. Later, with the assistance of the CIA and its Israeli\nequivalent, Mossad, the shah\u2019s government established a ruthless secret-police\norganization known by its Persian acronym, SAVAK. Making liberal use of force, torture,\nand arbitrary arrest, it worked to prevent the emergence of any effective political\nopposition. Finally, the shah exploited Iran\u2019s surging oil income\u2014it rose by a factor of\nfive between 1950 and 1960\u2014 to provide patronage to his key supporters and to fund\nsubstantial pay raises designed to ensure the loyalty of the bureaucracy and the army.86\nThe shah\u2019s effort to solidify his control of Iran in the years immediately following\nthe coup was quite successful. High pay, pensions, generous benefits, and new\nequipment from the US secured the loyalty of the military, while his expansion of the\nbureaucracy substantially increased the number of people who were dependent on the\nregime for their livelihood. More broadly, the steady rise in oil revenue underwrote a\ngrowing prosperity that seemed to erode popular support for the opposition during the\nlatter half of the 1950s. Indeed, coming on top of the support the regime enjoyed from\nconservative clerics such as Kashani and the Ayatollah Borujerdi (1875-1961), the\neconomic good times seemed to have cemented the shah\u2019s hold on power.87\nNew Challenges, 1960-1963\nAppearances were not what they seemed, however, and anti-regime sentiment\ncontinued to simmer just beneath the surface. Three events brought it into the open in\nthe early 1960s. First, the onset of a severe economic contraction ended the good times\nand rekindled anger toward the government on the part of many poor and middle-class\nIranians. Second, pressure from the Kennedy administration for democratic reforms\ncompelled the regime to implement a series of liberalizing measures\u2014including an end\nto the ban on the National Front\u2014and thus created room for anti-shah political activity\nfor the first time since 1953. Finally, the government\u2019s naked vote rigging and ballot-box\n85 Abrahamian, The Coup, 2\u20135.\n86 Garthwaite, The Persians, 247; quote from Axworthy, A History of Iran, 240.\n87 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 125\u201327; Axworthy, A History of Iran, 240. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 503\nstuffing in successive majlis elections infuriated Iranians of all classes. The result was a\nwave of popular strikes and demonstrations in the early 1960s organized by the\nWesternized middle class to protest the shah\u2019s autocratic rule.88\nMuhammad Reza\u2019s difficulties broadened considerably in 1963 when an\ninfluential cleric, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (1900-1989), began denouncing the\ngovernment in a series of sermons he gave in the main madrasa in the religious city of\nQom. A scholar of Aristotelian logic, Khomeini was an uncompromising figure who\ndespised the shah for his embrace of secular, Western reforms and who advocated an\nextreme and austere version of Shi\u02bfism. Many of his key ideas\u2014such as his opposition\nto constitutionalism, his hostility to the idea of female suffrage, and his insistence on\ngender separation even among children\u2014were unpopular with the majority of Iranians.\nKhomeini was savvy enough to avoid making those positions public, however, and\ninstead focused on three lines of attack that he grasped would win him broad popular\nsupport: criticizing the autocratic nature of the regime, condemning the shah for selling\noil to Israel, and, especially, demanding an end to American dominance of Iran.89\nThis last line of attack took on a new intensity in 1964. Eager to strengthen Iran\u2019s\nrelationship with the US, the shah accepted a $200 million loan for the purchase of\nmilitary equipment and signed a status-of-forces agreement that granted diplomatic\nimmunity to US military personnel stationed in Iran. Khomeini loudly condemned both\ndeals. In a series of scathing sermons, he argued that the status-of-forces agreement\n\u201c\u2018reduced the Iranian people to a level lower than that of an American dog\u201d and likened\nthe American loan to the one-sided concessions that the venal Qajar shahs had sold to\nEuropeans in the nineteenth century. These criticisms were effective and quickly won\nhim a substantial following.90\nThe White Revolution\nThe shah responded aggressively to the challenges of the early 1960s. To signal\nto both the National Front and its more radical offshoot, the Freedom Movement, that\nthere were limits to the amount of political dissent he was willing to tolerate, he\ninstructed state security forces to violently suppress student riots at the University of\nTehran in January 1962. To assert his power over the clerics, he ordered SAVAK\nagents and army paratroopers to storm the madrasa in Qom and arrest Khomeini in\nJune 1963. The move against the ayatollah was bloody. Several seminary students died\nin the operation and hundreds more perished when the military brutally suppressed\ndemonstrations in support of Khomeini in Tehran over the next few days. The regime\nsoon released the ayatollah, but twice rearrested him after he continued to preach\n88 Keddie, Modern Iran, 140\u201347; Axworthy, A History of Iran, 242.\n89 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 242\u201346.\n90 Quote from Peter L. Hahn, Caught in the Middle East: U.S. Policy toward the Arab-\nIsraeli Conflict, 1945-1961 (The University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 145; Keddie,\nModern Iran, 147\u201348. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 504\nagainst the shah\u2019s rule. Finally, in 1964, the government moved to blunt his criticism by\nexiling him from Iran.91\nThe attempt to diminish Khomeini\u2019s influence was a complete failure. Settling in\nthe Shi\u02bfi religious center of Najaf in Iraq, Khomeini began giving a series of influential\nsermons inveighing against the shah that soon drew an audience among the thousands\nof Iranians who visited the tomb of the First Imam, Ali Ibn Talib (601-661), each year.\nSmuggled home by pilgrims, copies of the ayatollah\u2019s increasingly vitriolic addresses\nwould win him a substantial following throughout Iran.92\nMeanwhile, though the regime relied heavily on repression to cow its critics, it\nalso took steps to coopt them. Most notably, it paired its use of force with a reform\nprogram called the White Revolution. Intended to prevent either a \u201cblack\u201d Shi\u02bfi\nrevolution or a \u201cred\u201d communist one, it sought to rally the people to the state by\nmodernizing Iran and by eliminating many of the country\u2019s worst inequities. It instituted\nprofit sharing for industrial workers, legalized women\u2019s suffrage, and established an\neducational initiative\u2014based on a successful Cuban model\u2014aimed at teaching illiterate\nIranians to read and write. Most importantly, it put in place an aggressive land reform\nprogram aimed at making the peasants independent and at weakening the political\npower of the rural notables. The regime went even further in 1967 when it passed the\nFamily Protection Law. Designed to emancipate women, it raised the age of marriage to\nfifteen, made divorce more difficult for men, and barred husbands from taking more than\none wife without the consent of his existing spouse or spouses. It also discouraged the\npractice of veiling, though it did not outright ban the practice. The White Revolution and\nthe Family Protection Law were not without their detractors, and they did nothing to\nloosen the monarch\u2019s grip on power. Nonetheless, they proved to be broadly popular\u2014\nsufficiently so that they helped to blunt the challenges that the shah faced in the early\n1960s.93\nThe Oil Boom\nEqually important in taking the air out of the opposition was the robust, oil-fueled\neconomic growth that Iran experienced in the late 1960s and, especially, in the early-\nand-mid 1970s. As we have seen, surging global demand for oil beginning in the 1960s\nhad given the producers the upper hand vis-\u00e0-vis both the consumer states and the oil\ncompanies and had dramatically raised the price of petroleum. The result was an\nabsolute bonanza of foreign revenue for Iran. Its oil income shot up from a\ncomparatively modest $34 million in 1953-1954 to $5 billion in 1973-1974 before hitting\na mind-boggling $20 billion in 1975-1976\u2014a nominal increase of 59,000 percent in a\nlittle more than two decades!94\n91 Amanat, Iran, 594\u2013601.\n92 Keddie, Modern Iran, 143\u201348, 192.\n93 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 134; Keddie, Modern Iran, 144\u201346, 167.\n94 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 247; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 123\u201324. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 505\nSustained by the massive inrush of petrodollars, the White Revolution and other\nmodernization initiatives produced impressive results. In the countryside, the land\nreform program resulted in more than two-million peasant families acquiring legal title to\ntheir own farms while the construction of huge new dams provided ample water for\nirrigation. In the cities, petrodollars and ISI policies produced a period of rapid\nindustrialization. With government support in the form of tariffs and subsidized loans,\nentrepreneurs connected to the palace established thousands of industrial facilities\nincluding textile mills, machine tool factories, and soft-drink bottling plants, while the\nregime itself underwrote the construction of larger industrial concerns such as steel\nmills, automobile assembly plants, and even a nuclear powerplant. Education and\nhealth programs enjoyed similarly rapid growth. Between 1963 and 1977, elementary-\nschool enrollment rose by 250 percent while college registration quadrupled. Over the\nsame period, the number of doctors in the country tripled.95\nIt was in many regards a tremendous achievement. Fueled by the vast surge in\noil revenue, the regime had succeeded both in rapidly developing Iran\u2019s economy and in\nmodernizing much of the country\u2019s infrastructure\u2014and it had done so in record time. It\nis certainly true that the shah\u2019s stated goal of making Iran one of the globes top-five\npowers by the end of the century was little more than hyperbole. Still, sustained by the\nhuge inflow of petrodollars, Iran experienced undeniable and enviable economic growth\nin the late 1960s and early 1970s.96\nAt the same time, the shah misspent a huge share of Iran\u2019s oil windfall. In\nparticular, his regime devoted an absurd amount of its new wealth to arms purchases\ndesigned to fulfill the shah\u2019s ambition to serve as the \u201cgulf policeman.\u201d This aspiration\nmeshed well with a new American foreign-policy initiative, the Nixon Doctrine, that\nPresident Richard Nixon (r. 1969-1974) had announced in 1969. Designed to prevent\nthe US from ever again becoming bogged down in a conflict like the Vietnam War, it\ncalled for Washington to refrain from deploying American troops to the Developing\nWorld and to instead rely on powerful regional allies to contain Soviet adventurism.\nStaunchly anticommunist, the government of Iran appeared well suited to fill that role in\nthe Gulf region.97\nThe shah\u2019s regional ambitions also complemented America\u2019s now-pressing need\nto redress the balance-of-payments deficit that surging oil prices had created. As we\nsaw in the context of Saudi Arabia, Washington understood that the sale of advanced\nweapon systems to the producer countries would allow the US to repatriate a\nsubstantial share of the petrodollars that had begun flowing to the Middle East in the\nearly 1970s. Accordingly, after the Yom Kippur War, the Nixon administration lifted\nnearly all restrictions on arms purchases to Iran and encouraged the shah and his\n95 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 133\u201334; Axworthy, A History of Iran, 246\u201347.\n96 James F.

Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 506\ngenerals to go on a shopping spree. They did so with abandon. Over the next five\nyears, Iran bought billions of dollars\u2019 worth of sophisticated American weapons including\nF-14 fighter jets, destroyers, and the latest antiaircraft missiles. Washington was not\nalone in providing Tehran with high-tech arms. Also looking to redress its balance-of-\npayments deficit, Britain sold substantial quantities of weapons to the Iranian military. In\nfact, it provided so many Chieftain tanks to Iran in the 1970s that the shah\u2019s army ended\nup fielding more of them than did the British military.98\nThe shah also squandered a significant amount of oil revenue on spectacles\ndesigned to enhance the prestige of the monarchy. These included his formal\ncoronation ceremony held in 1967 and, especially, his commemoration of the Iranian\nmonarchy\u2019s two-and-a-half millennia anniversary in 1971. Attended by a vast\nassemblage of heads of state and other notables, the celebration was a bacchanalian\noccasion of epic proportions. Held at the ruins of the ancient Persian capital of\nPersepolis, this lavish and ahistorical event involved thousands of actors in period\ncostumes, a series of bizarre speeches in which the shah linked himself to Cyrus the\nGreat (r. 559-530 BCE), and a succession of almost comically indulgent feasts. Catered\nby Maxim\u2019s of Paris, the elaborate meals were served on the finest Limog\u00e8s china and\nwashed down with a staggering 25,000 bottles of wine including prized vintages such as\nCh\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild. To the shock of ordinary Iranians, the total bill for the event\nwas $21 million\u2014an obscene figure for the time.99\nRenewed Discontent\nThe commemoration of the Iranian monarchy at Persepolis was not merely a\nconspicuously expensive affair, but also one that failed utterly to achieve its purpose.\nDesigned to bind the shah\u2019s subjects to the regime through the construction of a new,\nnational identity, the elaborate ceremony had little resonance with a people that\nperceived its history not in dynastic terms but instead in an Islamic framework. Indeed,\nrather than building loyalty to the regime, the event contributed to a rising sense of\nalienation and helped to feed a growing opposition that, ironically, drew increasing\nstrength from the same oil-fueled economic boom and reform program that had\ndissipated the protest movements of the early 1960s. What explains this paradox? How\ncould the reforms of the White Revolution and the rapid economic growth that had\nraised living standards for most Iranians have gone from easing dissatisfaction with the\nregime in the 1960s to producing widespread discontent in the 1970s?100\nThree consequences of the economic expansion and the modernization effort\nexplain this apparent contradiction. First, while the oil boom resulted in an absolute rise\nin per capita income, it also badly exacerbated Iran\u2019s already stark income inequality.\nThat it did so was largely a function of the fact that the regime\u2019s economic-development\n98 Keddie, Modern Iran, 163\u201364.\n99 Amanat, Iran, 664\u201366; Michael Axworthy, Revolutionary Iran: A History of the Islamic\nRepublic (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016), 76\u201377.\n100 Keddie, Modern Iran, 167\u201368. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 507\nstrategy was a top-down program that centered on distributing oil revenue to the\nwealthiest Iranians so that they could invest it in businesses that would, it was hoped,\nraise living standards for the lower classes. As a result, the flood of oil money that\npoured into Iran in the 1970s went disproportionately to regime officials and their\nhangers on\u2014a fact that the upper class\u2019s increasingly brazen displays of conspicuous\nconsumption made obvious to all.101\nSecond, while the oil boom and the shah\u2019s modernization program were popular,\nthey also challenged the position of two highly influential groups in Iranian society: the\nbazaar merchants and the religious scholars. For the bazaar merchants, the period\nsince the White Revolution had been a difficult one. The oil boom and the growing\nintegration of Iran into the global economy had produced a rise in cheap imports that\nundercut the price of the artisanal handicrafts that were their livelihood, while the\ndevelopment of Western-style stores threatened their longstanding dominance of the\nretail sector. For the \u02bfulama\u02be, the problem was less the economic changes that Iran was\nexperiencing than the reforms that the shah had pushed through. Most notably, they\nbitterly opposed the Family Protection Law\u2019s transfer of marriage, divorce, and\ninheritance proceedings from shari\u02bfa courts to secular ones. That change not only\ncontradicted their deeply held understanding of how a properly functioning Muslim\nsociety should be organized but, as important, directly undercut their authority,\ninfluence, and income.102\nFinally, and most importantly, the reforms of the White Revolution and the rapid\neconomic expansion that followed raised expectations that the shah\u2019s regime either\ncould not\u2014or would not\u2014meet. The issue of unmet expectations existed up and down\nthe social ladder. For rural Iranians, the White Revolution had led them to conclude that\nthey would soon acquire land and see the benefits of modernity extended to their\nvillages. Instead, to their mounting frustration, most continued to live in communities\nthat lacked basic elements of modern life such as electricity, plumbing, and schools.\nWorse, while many peasants did gain title to their farms thanks to the land-reform\nprogram, the poorest\u2014the rural laborers\u2014received no land at all and frequently lost\ntheir jobs due to the mechanization of agriculture that the influx of oil wealth had made\npossible. Millions consequently found themselves with no choice but to move to the\nshantytowns that were springing up around the country\u2019s cities. There, they eked out a\nmeager existence as low-wage, unskilled workers\u2014a far cry from the life that the White\nRevolution and the oil bonanza had promised.103\nMembers of the westernized middle class fared much better than rural Iranians\nduring the economic expansion of the 1970s, but they too were bitter\u2014not just about\nthe regime\u2019s failure to meet their economic expectations but, as important, about its\nrefusal to satisfy their political aspirations. Their economic frustration stemmed to a\n101 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 140\u201341; Garthwaite, The Persians, 251\u201352.\n102 Keddie, Modern Iran, 223; Axworthy, A History of Iran, 247; Garthwaite, The\nPersians, 250.\n103 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 141\u201343. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 508\nlarge degree from their inability to fill the best jobs or to access the housing to which\nthey aspired. Instead, the top positions managing the shah\u2019s infrastructure and\nmaintaining the military\u2019s new, high-tech military equipment went to highly skilled\nAmerican contractors; thanks to the lavish salaries the regime had to offer to attract\nthem, they were also well-positioned to outbid Iranians for increasingly scarce housing.\nPolitically, meanwhile, the White Revolution had reinforced the expectation of middle-\nclass Iranians that they should and would enjoy the right to participate in the\ngovernance of the state in accordance with their economic importance. To their\nfrustration, the shah instead continued to jealously maintain his tight grip on power.104\nAs anger at the regime mounted in the 1970s, many workers, students, and\nmembers of the intelligentsia began to join underground political organizations or to\nadhere to radical new ideologies. Militant leftists gravitated toward a pair of underground\nguerrilla organizations: the Fedayin-e Khalq, an offshoot of the Tudeh Party that drew\non the works of radical thinkers like Frantz Fanon (1925-1961), and the Mojahedin-e\nKhalq, a radical outgrowth of the Freedom Movement that promoted a mix of Shi\u02bfi and\nMarxist thought. Put off by the violence that those groups espoused, other, more-\nmoderate leftists instead fell under the influence of the French-educated intellectual Ali\nShariati (1933-1977). Drawing on both progressive Western thought and the spirit of\nJamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838-1897), he articulated a new, radical conception of Shi\u02bfism\nas a populist, revolutionary ideology and likened the Imam Husayn (626-680) to\nmodern-day insurgents like Che Guevara (1928-1967). A prolific author, he criticized the\n\u02bfulama\u02be for quietism and for collaborating with the upper classes, and he attacked the\nPahlavi state for its autocratic rule and failure to adhere to the social-justice values that\nhe maintained lay at the heart of what he called the \u201cRed Shi\u02bfism of the Imams.\u201d\nShariati\u2019s death under suspicious circumstances while in exile in 1977 ended his\ncriticism of the regime but did not diminish his popularity. On the contrary, his ideas\ncontinued to inform the views of millions of Iranians during the revolution.105\nWhile many leftist students and intellectuals gravitated toward Shariati, the large,\nwesternized middle class instead coalesced around the National Front and Mehdi\nBazargan\u2019s (1907-1995) Freedom Movement. Revived in 1977 by two veterans of\nMossadegh\u2019s government, Shapur Bakhtiar (1914-1991) and Karim Sanjabi (1905-\n1995), the National Front was a liberal secular political party that demanded free\nelections and a return to the constitution of 1906. Itself an offshoot of the National Front,\nBazargan\u2019s Freedom Movement similarly called for a return to democracy and promoted\na moderate, Islamic-modernist form of government that integrated Western science and\ntechnology with Muslim values.106\nFor their part, the urban poor, the baazaris, and the \u02bfulama\u02be increasingly adhered\nto the views of the exiled Khomeini. Spread by cassette tapes that returning pilgrims\n104 Garthwaite, The Persians, 243, 251\u201352; Keddie, Modern Iran, 164.\n105 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 128\u201329; quote from Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran,\n143\u201346, 148\u201349.\n106 Keddie, Modern Iran, 198\u2013200, 232. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 509\nsmuggled into Iran, the ayatollah\u2019s weekly sermons offered a scathing critique of the\nPahlavi state. He condemned the regime for its economic shortcomings, its corruption,\nits inability to extend the benefits of modernization to rural people, its refusal to protect\nthe bazaaris from foreign competition, and, especially, its subservience to the US.\nSeemingly rooted in traditional Shi\u02bfi thinking, these critiques resonated deeply with\nmillions of poorer and more conservative Iranians.107\nIn fact, Khomeini\u2019s ideas broke sharply with longstanding Shi\u02bfi teachings. He\nmade this clear in a book he published in the early seventies called Velayat-e Faqeh, or\nThe Jurist\u2019s Guardianship. Arguing that the idea of monarchical government was a relic\nof pre-Islamic times, it called for Iran to be restructured as a theocratic state in which the\nsenior clerics ruled the country as the representatives of the Hidden Imam. Khomeini\nclaimed in the book that his idea for religious rule was well grounded in longstanding\nShi\u02bfi thought. Despite some precedent among late-Safavid-era clerics, however, it in\nfact marked a radical break with earlier Shi\u02bfi thinking\u2014an innovation that had no basis\nin either Qur\u02beanic teaching or the guidance of the Twelve Imams.108\nKhomeini was well aware that his guardianship idea would be unpopular with\nmany Iranians and that it would engender fierce opposition from pro-Western reformers\nand advocates of democracy. Accordingly, taking advantage of the fact that the book\nwas all-but-unknown beyond a small circle of seminary students, he shrewdly refrained\nfrom discussing it publicly and instead presented himself as a typical Shi\u02bfi conservative.\nIndeed, as we shall see, it was only after he had curbed or defeated his rivals in 1979\nthat he would begin to pursue openly the theocratic state that he had envisioned in\nVelayat-e Faqeh.109\nVacillation\nMeanwhile, even as dissatisfaction with the shah\u2019s regime deepened, rising\ncriticism from the international community put further pressure on the Iranian\ngovernment in the mid 1970s and encouraged the opposition to act more boldly.\nHuman-rights groups including the International Commission of Jurists and, especially,\nAmnesty International, brought global attention to the lack of due process and to the\nshocking prevalence of torture in the Iranian legal system. Far more important, however,\nwas the criticism coming out of Washington. Implying that the US might limit or end\narms shipments if Iran did not end its more egregious human rights\u2019 violations, the new\nAmerican president, Jimmy Carter (r. 1977-1981), aggressively pressed the shah to\nease his government\u2019s worst human-rights abuses. In response, the regime\nimplemented an assortment of high-profile, but ultimately modest reforms including the\nrelaxation of censorship laws and the release of some political prisoners.110\n107 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 147\u201348.\n108 Nasr, The Shia Revival, 125.\n109 Nasr, 125.\n110 Keddie, Modern Iran, 214\u201317. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 510\nThese reforms may not have been substantive, but because they signaled\nweakness they had the unintended consequence of spurring opposition groups to step\nup their criticism of the shah\u2019s government. Most notably, in 1977, newly formed\nprofessional associations issued petitions attacking the government while the National\nFront released a public letter that boldly demanded the restoration of civil liberties and\nfree elections. Owing in part to the treatment that Muhammad Reza had begun to\nreceive for the cancer that would soon kill him, the government seemed unable to\nmaintain a consistent line toward the opposition groups and instead veered erratically\nbetween conciliation and repression. Most notably, while state security forces violently\nattacked protestors at demonstrations held in Tehran in November 1977, the courts\nquickly acquitted and released those whom the police had arrested. This lack of\nconsistency proved disastrous for the regime. Continued repression merely stoked anti-\nshah anger, while conciliatory gestures suggested not moderation or restraint but\ninstead a degree of indecision and vulnerability that served only to embolden the\nregime\u2019s opponents to further action.111\nThe Iranian Revolution, 1978-1979\nIndeed, the regime\u2019s vacillation in 1977 would inspire the outbreak of a protest by\nseminary students in Qom in January 1978 that is conventionally understood to mark\nthe beginning of the revolution. The demonstration had its origin in an inflammatory\neditorial in a government-controlled newspaper that accused Khomeini of engaging in\nimmoral behavior. Concluding from the inconsistent response to the recent\ndemonstrations in Tehran that they could protest without bringing the wrath of the state\ndown on them, thousands of conservative seminary students in Qom reacted by taking\npart in a march organized to protest the attack on the ayatollah. Furious about the\ninsults to Khomeini, they demanded that the shah\u2019s government issue a formal apology\nand that it permit him to return to Iran. The religious students had in fact badly\nmisjudged the regime\u2019s willingness to tolerate dissent, however. This time\u2014in sharp\ncontrast to their more-measured handling of the protests in Tehran\u2014the police used\ndeadly force to break up the demonstrations.112\nA watershed event in the revolution, the violence set in motion a train of events\nthat would result in the protests spreading rapidly throughout Iran. Key to that process\nwas the deft exploitation of the Shi\u02bfi custom of holding a commemorative service forty\ndays following a person\u2019s death. Shrewdly turning the memorial services into\ndemonstrations against the regime, the religious protestors ensured that the state would\nrespond to the services with deadly force\u2014thus guaranteeing that a series of even\nbigger protests would occur in an even-larger number of cities and towns forty days\nlater. Still, even as the demonstrations grew in size and number, there was little sense\nat that time that the protests were going to produce a change of regime in Iran. Indeed,\nthe situation began to stabilize in the early summer after a moderate ayatollah,\n111 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 252\u201353; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 156\u201358.\n112 William R. Polk, Understanding Iran (Basingstoke: Griffin, 2011), 124. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 511\nMohammad Shariatmadari (1906-1986), called for an end to the memorial\ndemonstrations in order to prevent further bloodshed.113\nThe lull proved to be very brief, however. Following a deadly arson attack on the\nRex Theater in Abadan in August that resulted in the deaths of 377 people, the protests\nroared back to life with a vengeance. Widely\u2014if incorrectly\u2014blamed on SAVAK, the\nincident galvanized popular opinion against the shah. As a result, the demonstrations\nthat followed the cinema fire were different in kind and size from those that had\noccurred in the spring. Considerably larger and involving a far-broader and more-\nmoderate cross section of the population, they reflected surging dissatisfaction with the\nshah\u2019s regime among the technocratic middle class.114\nThe new round of protests culminated with a massive demonstration in Tehran\non September 8. Known as Black Friday, the huge rally and the regime\u2019s violent\nresponse to it marked the beginning of the end for the shah. Though the government\u2019s\nuse of force that day resulted in the deaths of far-fewer people than was commonly\nunderstood at the time, the violence poisoned the waters and ended any chance that\nthe shah could negotiate an agreement that permitted him to remain in power.\nThereafter, all elements of Iranian society worked together to force the shah out. Most\nnotably, oil workers, bazaar merchants, bank employees, railroad engineers, and even\nthe shah\u2019s own bureaucrats followed the violence on September 8 by launching a\ncoordinated, nation-wide strike aimed at compelling him to step down.115\nShutting down the Iranian economy, the strike left the shah isolated and weak.\nIndeed, popular opposition was so strong by December that the regime felt it had no\nchoice but to permit a massive opposition march in Tehran involving an estimated two-\nmillion people. If the sheer size of the rally did not make adequately clear that the\npeople of Iran wanted the shah to go, the protestors\u2019 approval of a series of resolutions\ndemanding Khomeini\u2019s return and the transformation of the country into an Islamic\nrepublic surely did. With desertions from the military rapidly rising, even the shah began\nto grasp that his time as Iran\u2019s ruler was coming to an end. In desperation, he asked\nShapur Bakhtiar to serve as prime minister. On December 30, the latter agreed to do\nso\u2014an action that resulted in his prompt expulsion from the National Front\u2014but only on\nthe condition that Muhammad Reza depart Iran immediately. The shah dragged his feet\nfor a time, but, on January 16, 1978, he and his family finally left the country. Just\nsixteen days later Khomeini returned to a hero\u2019s welcome.116\nKhomeini\u2019s Victory, 1979-1981\nThe departure of the shah and Khomeini\u2019s triumphal homecoming marked the\nend of the first phase of the Iranian revolution and the beginning of its far-more divisive\n113 Axworthy, Revolutionary Iran, 104\u20139, 112\u201313.\n114 Amanat, Iran, 716\u201318.\n115 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 159\u201361.\n116 Keddie, Modern Iran, 234\u201335. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 512\nand complex second stage. The first phase had centered on the twin questions of\nwhether the shah would continue to rule and whether Iran would remain a monarchy.\nOn those points, nearly all Iranians agreed. The second addressed a more fundamental\nand divisive issue: whether the country would have a democratic state controlled by the\npeople or a fundamentally religious one dominated by the Shi\u02bfi clergy.117\nThat there was a second phase to the revolution came as a surprise to the\nmoderates in the Freedom Movement and the National Front. Since all political parties\nsave for the far-left ones agreed on a shared vision of the country as an Islamic\nrepublic, the moderates had assumed that the departure of the shah marked the end of\nthe revolution and the beginning of Iran\u2019s transformation into a democratic state. They\nsoon discovered, however, that their idea of an Islamic republic was decidedly different\nfrom the conception that Khomeini held. Where they interpreted the term to mean that\nIran would be a Western-style, multiparty democracy that rested on Shi\u02bfi values,\nKhomeini instead understood it to describe a state based on the concept of velayet-e\nfaqeh that he had earlier developed\u2014meaning that the clerics would hold the final say\nover political and social questions. In other words, the moderates were assuming that\nIran would become a democratic state while Khomeini was calling for it to be, at root, a\ntheocracy. Still, the leaders of the moderate parties were not particularly concerned\nabout Khomeini\u2019s undemocratic conception of what an Islamic republic entailed. Despite\nthe ayatollah\u2019s enormous popularity\u2014three-million people greeted him upon his return\nfrom exile\u2014he was politically inexperience and appeared to be both naive and\nfundamentally backward looking. In other words, he seemed like a lightweight\u2014\nsomeone the moderates were confident they would run rings around.118\nFor a brief time, events seemed to reinforce this view. It is true that Khomeini\nforced Bakhtiar from office by declaring that he would not recognize the legitimacy of\nany figure associated with the shah\u2019s regime. However, faced with the popular and\nsavvy liberal politicians, a seemingly chastened Khomeini agreed to establish a liberal\nprovisional government and named Freedom Movement leader Mehdi Bazargan as its\nprime minister. He likewise accepted an arrangement in which the liberal parties held\ntwo-thirds of the cabinet posts in the new government, and\u2014critically\u2014indicated that he\nno longer supported the idea of clerical rule. Accordingly, Bazargan and the other\nmoderates turned their attention away from Khomeini following his return and focused\non drafting a new constitution that would transform Iran into an Islamic republic\ndominated by secular political parties.119\nEvents would soon make clear that the moderates had badly underestimated\nKhomeini. He was not, as they believed, either backward looking or naive. On the\ncontrary, he was an unusually savvy and ruthless political figure\u2014a skilled bureaucratic\ninfighter and a charismatic leader who was capable of deftly manipulating public\nopinion. Shrewdly exploiting the rapidly shifting events of the revolution, he\n117 Garthwaite, The Persians, 255.\n118 Garthwaite, 225\u201329.\n119 Keddie, Modern Iran, 240\u201343; Garthwaite, The Persians, 256. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 513\noutmaneuvered the moderates over the next year and solidified his position as the\ndominant figure in Iran.120\nKhomeini began by quietly moving to strengthen his political position at the\nmoderates\u2019 expense. First, to divide his opponents and to prevent the emergence of a\nbroad coalition against him, he struck a temporary alliance with the Tudeh and the\nFedayin-e Khalq. He followed by establishing an increasingly powerful Islamist shadow\nstate that paralleled Bazargan\u2019s provisional government. Dominated by the \u02bfulama\u02be, this\nextraconstitutional body was composed of the Revolutionary Council, which passed\nlaws and checked the authority of the Provisional Government, and the Central\nCommittee, which coordinated the many local Islamist groups and militias that had\nemerged in late 1978 and early 1979 as the shah\u2019s state was imploding. Other moves\nsoon followed. Over the course of the spring and early summer of 1979, Khomeini\narrested and executed members of the shah\u2019s regime, assumed control over the\njudiciary, and\u2014most critically\u2014created a new Islamist paramilitary force called the\nRevolutionary Guard that he could use to break up the moderates\u2019 political rallies.\nUndertaking all of these initiatives with consummate skill, Khomeini quickly solidified his\npolitical position. As a result, by the summer of 1979, he was ready to vie with the\nmoderates for control of the revolution.121\nKhomeini focused his challenge on the constitution that the liberals had been\nwriting. In June 1979, Bazargan and the moderates had completed a draft document\nbased on the constitution of France\u2019s Fifth Republic. While rooted in Shi\u02bfi values, the\nnew constitution was a strongly democratic document. It emphasized the rule of the\npeople, eliminated the monarchy, and, importantly, assigned no meaningful power to\nthe clergy. Satisfied with their work, the liberals were ready to present their draft to the\npeople for formal ratification. Before they could do so, however, Khomeini\u2019s supporters\nobjected. Calling for a formal review before the document went to a public vote, they\ndemanded that a council of prominent Shi\u02bfi legal scholars, the Assembly of Experts, first\nexamine and refine the draft. Stacked as it was with Khomeini\u2019s supporters, the\nassembly unsurprisingly released a revised draft that was very different from the one\nthat the moderates had produced. Far more theocratic than democratic in both structure\nand character, it drew explicitly on the concept of velayet-e faqeh to assign the clerics\nand, especially, Khomeini, enormous power. Emblematic of these changes was its\ndeclaration that the ayatollah\u2019s rule was divinely ordained and that he answered to none\nbut God.122\nStill, Khomeini\u2019s position and the passage of the revised constitution were far-\nfrom assured. Many Iranians, perhaps even a majority, supported neither the ayatollah\nnor his idea of clerical rule and instead backed moderate parties like the Freedom\nMovement and the National Front. Women were particularly vocal in expressing their\nopposition. Fearing the loss of the rights that they had gained since the White\n120 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 162\u201363.\n121 Keddie, Modern Iran, 241\u201345.\n122 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 162\u201364; Keddie, Modern Iran, 246\u201348. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 514\nRevolution, they organized mass demonstrations to make clear their refusal to accept\nthe imposition of new restrictions. Even many of the \u02bfulama\u02be opposed Khomeini. Most\nnotably, a number of influential moderate clerics found his velayet-e faqeh idea to be\ntroubling both because it lacked grounding in Shi\u02bfi thought and because it broke with\nthe religious scholars\u2019 longstanding practice of acknowledging the government\u2019s\nauthority over secular matters in exchange for the state respecting the clergy\u2019s\ndominance over religious and social affairs. In other words, Khomeini may have had\nenormous influence, but he also continued to face substantial opposition that limited his\ncapacity to force through the radical changes enumerated in the revised draft of the\nconstitution.123\nUltimately, it was Khomeini\u2019s deft exploitation of the Hostage Crisis with the US\nthat assured both his victory in the struggle for power and the passage of the revised\nconstitution. The conflict\u2019s genesis lay in President Carter\u2019s decision to permit the exiled\nshah to travel to New York City for cancer treatment in October 1979. While\nunsuccessful\u2014Muhammad Reza died in 1980\u2014the president\u2019s decision breathed life\ninto an elaborate conspiracy theory in Iran that held that Washington was plotting to\noverthrow the revolution and to return the shah to power. Such an action was wildly\nbeyond the capabilities of even the powerful CIA, but it appeared entirely plausible to a\npeople well aware of the agency\u2019s role in overthrowing Mossadegh in 1953. As one\nhostage taker later declared, \u201c\u2018In the back of everybody's mind hung the suspicion that,\nwith the admission of the Shah to the United States, the countdown for another coup\nd'etat had begun.\u2019\u201d Attention quickly centered on the US embassy in Tehran. Fearing\nthat the CIA was using it as a base from which to execute a change of government\u2014\njust as it had in 1953\u2014a group of Iranian students loyal to Khomeini seized it on\nNovember 4, 1979, and took a number of American State Department personnel\nhostage.124\nIn two ways, the occupation of the embassy immediately and fundamentally\naltered the political balance in Iran. First, acute conflicts with a foreign power typically\ncreate a rally-round-the-flag effect in which patriotic sentiment and approval for a\ncountry\u2019s leader rise rapidly. Such was certainly the case in Iran in 1979 and 1980.\nEven among people who opposed his ideas, support for Khomeini soared following the\nonset of the Hostage Crisis. Second, just as the conflict with the US enhanced\nKhomeini\u2019s influence, so did it grievously damage the moderates\u2019 political standing.\nChampioning an essentially American-style system of constitutional government,\nFreedom Movement and National Front leaders suffered a sharp loss of support due to\ntheir association in the public imagination with the US.125\nNow in a commanding position, Khomeini shrewdly exploited the crisis. He kept\nhis moderate rivals on their heels by preventing Bazargan from securing the release of\nthe hostages\u2014a move that prompted the prime minister to resign\u2014and by steadily\n123 Garthwaite, The Persians, 259\u201361.\n124 Kinzer, All the Shah\u2019s Men, 203.\n125 Amanat, Iran, 821\u201325. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 515\nreleasing copies of embassy files detailing meetings between them and American\nofficials that, while unremarkable, appeared ominous in the hothouse atmosphere of\nrevolutionary Iran. He also muted dissent by equating criticism of the government during\na time of crisis with treason. Most importantly, he took advantage of the upsurge in\npatriotic sentiment that the Hostage Crisis produced to secure popular approval of the\nrevised constitution in a referendum held in December 1979.126\nThe passage of the constitution was a major political victory for Khomeini that\nsolidified his control of Iran. Based on the ideas that he had outlined in The Jurist\u2019s\nGuardianship, the document established an Iranian state that bore only a superficial\nresemblance to the kind of government that people like Bazargan had envisioned. While\nthe constitution did assign the power to conduct the routine business of state to a\nsecular president and majlis, it placed them firmly under the thumb of an interlocking\napparatus of powerful, unelected institutions controlled by the clergy. At the top of that\nstructure stood Khomeini: the supreme leader who officially ruled in the name of the\nHidden Imam. The constitution accorded him vast powers. He held the authority to\ndeclare war, to grant amnesty, and to appoint many high-ranking officials including the\ncommander of the military, the head of the Revolutionary Guard, and the chief justice.\nJust beneath him was an unelected, twelve-man body called the Guardian Council that\nhad the power to determine who could\u2014and who could not\u2014stand for election to the\nmajlis. More importantly, functioning like an Islamic supreme court, it could veto any\nlegislation that it determined was contrary to Shi\u02bfi principles as it defined them and thus\nheld the unchecked power to determine the constitutionality of any law the majlis\npassed.127\nThe constitution did not merely vest enormous power in the religious scholars,\nbut also created a complex, self-reinforcing structure that ensured that any effort to chip\naway at their authority was doomed to failure. To start with, the supreme leader was not\npopularly elected; instead, the Assembly of Experts selected him from among their\nranks. He, in turn, appointed half of the Guardian Council. The majlis had the power to\nname the other six members, but it had to choose them from a list of candidates created\nby a body called the Supreme Judicial Council, which was itself composed of clerics\nappointed by the supreme leader. To complete the series of closed loops that Khomeini\nand his supporters had put in place to ensure perpetual clerical dominance, the\nGuardian Council enjoyed the power to vet the legal scholars on the Assembly of\nExperts who chose the supreme leader. In other words, since the top-ranked clerics\neffectively named each other to the key posts and councils in the government and since\none of those bodies, the\u2014Guardian Council\u2014determined the constitutionality of all\nlaws, only the clerics could meaningfully alter the structure of government or, critically,\nshift power from the \u02bfulama\u02be to the secular state. Unsurprisingly, they have vigorously\n126 Keddie, Modern Iran, 248\u201349.\n127 Amanat, Iran, 783\u201389; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 164\u201365. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 516\nresisted proposals to do so. Thus, despite periods of intense public dissatisfaction with\nreligious rule, Iran\u2019s government has remained essentially unchanged since 1979.128\nKhomeini claimed that the new constitution and the system of religious rule were\nfirmly grounded in longstanding Shi\u02bfi religious traditions. In fact, it was a radical\ninnovation with almost no past precedent. The very core of it\u2014the concept of velayet-e\nfaqeh\u2014had traditionally formed the legal justification for the clergy\u2019s oversight of those\nwho could not care for themselves such as widows, children, and the developmentally\ndisabled, and had never before constituted the basis for a government. Likewise, the\nShi\u02bfi clergy had at no point in the past exercised political power and had instead been\ncontent to adhere to a form of separation of church and state wherein the secular\ngovernment dealt with the affairs of the world while the clergy held sway over religious\nand social matters. In other words, while carefully camouflaged in a conservative\nwrapper, the new state that Khomeini\u2019s constitution established in fact constituted a\nfundamental break with past practice\u2014one that vested nearly all power in the hands of\nthe ayatollah and his closest allies.129\nThe passage of the new constitution marked the end of the second phase of the\nrevolution and the culmination of Khomeini\u2019s nearly total political victory. By the time the\nconstitution had gone into effect, he had neutered the moderate parties that had been\nhis most serious rivals and had assumed complete control of the government. It is true\nthat he still had to deal with the leftist organizations with which he had entered into an\nalliance of convenience against the liberals in 1979. Likewise, he continued to face a\nspirited, if doomed, opposition from the first president of the republic, Abolhassan Bani\nSadr (r. 1980-1981). By 1980, however, neither the president nor the leftists could\novercome Khomeini\u2019s commanding ideological and institutional position. Thus, despite a\nsavage terror campaign on the part of the Mojahedin-e Khalq, he was able to brush\naside his remaining political enemies and cement his total dominance of Iran\u2014a reality\nmade emphatically clear when Bani Sadr and the leader of the Mojahedin-e Khalq fled\nthe country together aboard a commandeered jet in July 1981.130\nThe Transformation of Iranian Society\nKhomeini\u2019s political victory had enormous ramifications for Iran. Most obviously, it\npermitted the ayatollah and his supporters to impose a sweeping Islamist social\nrevolution on the country. They wasted no time in doing so. The new government\nimmediately banned alcohol and most Western movies, quickly closed newspapers that\ndid not hew to the official line, compelled schoolteachers to adopt a stilted curriculum\ndeveloped by the state, launched a violent campaign to Islamicize the universities, and\nreimposed shari\u02bfa law\u2014including traditional criminal penalties such as flogging. No\ngroup felt the effects of the Khomeinist social revolution more acutely than did women.\nThe regime required them to veil, revoked the rights they had received under the Family\n128 Keddie, Modern Iran, 247\u201348.\n129 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 146, 176\u201377.\n130 Garthwaite, The Persians, 266\u201367. Chapter Fifteen: Arabia, Turkey, and Iran, 1949-1979 Page 517\nProtection Law, discouraged them from wearing Western clothing, forced them from the\njudiciary and teaching, reimposed gender segregation, and even revived practices such\nas child marriage. Implemented at breakneck speed, the changes that Khomeini had\nimposed were far reaching and constituted a true social revolution\u2014one that\ntransformed Iran into a visibly different country than it had been just a few years\nearlier.131\nUnsurprisingly, the Khomeinist social revolution was far from universally popular.\nWhile the ayatollah\u2019s reform program received a warm reception among rural Iranians\nand shantytown dwellers, it faced staunch opposition among members of the\ntechnocratic middle class who were bitterly disappointed that the overthrow of the shah\nhad resulted not in a genuinely representative government but instead in a state that\nwas even more autocratic than the one it had replaced. In light of the new order\u2019s\nwillingness to make liberal use of brute force against any protests, however, there was\nlittle that they could do to protest Khomeini\u2019s regime. Defeated, the Westernized middle\nclass thereafter adopted a cynical view of the government that saw it as an alien and\neven hostile entity that they had to endure so long as they remained in Iran. Not all of\nthem chose to do so. Weary of the repression they faced at home, more than one\nmillion members of the middle class voted with their feet in the years after the revolution\nand\u2014at great economic cost to Iran\u2014took their considerable education, skills, and\nentrepreneurial abilities with them to the West in search of a better life and greater\nfreedom.132\nConclusion\nThe Iranian Revolution was yet another of the watershed events that the Middle\nEast experienced during the tumultuous twentieth century. It greatly weakened\nAmerica\u2019s position in the region, stoked Sunni- Shi\u02bfi conflict, and, most importantly,\nannounced the arrival of Islamism as a major political force in the Muslim world. It was\nnot, however, the only major event to occur in the region in 1979. Indeed, while it was\nclearly the most important, it was but one of a series of cataclysmic changes that would,\ncollectively, effect a fundamental restructuring of the Middle East that year. It is to these\nevents and to their complex genesis that we will now turn.\nChapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979\nIntroduction\nAs we saw in chapter fourteen, the Six Day War was one of the seminal events in\nthe making of the modern Middle East. Its impact was pervasive but uneven. In the Arab\nstates, it produced an ideological sea change, inspired a series of coups, and created\n131 Amanat, Iran, 809\u201315; Keddie, Modern Iran, 257.\n132 Garthwaite, The Persians, 269. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 518\npressure for another war with Israel that could restore Arab honor and resolve the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict once and for all. The changes were equally significant in Israel and the\nOccupied Territories. For a growing number of Israelis, the seizure of the Sinai, Golan\nHeights, West Bank, and Gaza Strip created a tempting opportunity to expand their\ncountry; for the Palestinians, in contrast, the war produced a new, shared experience of\noppression that would quickly reinvigorate their sense of national identity. More broadly,\nthe Six Day War fundamentally transformed the tenor of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nEffecting changes that would result in the establishment of peace between Israel and\nEgypt and in the emergence of an organized Palestinian resistance movement, it set in\nmotion a process that would transform the struggle between Israelis and Arabs from a\nstate-to-state dispute back into what it had been before 1948: a contest between two\npeoples for control of the land of Palestine.\nNot every major trend in the decade following the Six Day War was directly\nrelated to the conflict, however. Nurtured by Gamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s (r. 1954-1970)\nsuccessor, Anwar Sadat (r. 1970-1981), and supported financially by the Arab oil states,\na new movement, Islamism, emerged as a force in the Arab world. Focused initially on\nrecruiting members and on building institutional structures, the Islamists and their Jihadi\noffshoots would burst forth at the end of the 1970s to mount a powerful and persistent\nchallenge to Arab states across the political spectrum\u2014one that would, in conjunction\nwith a series of dramatic events in 1979, once more reshape the region.\nThe Legacy of 1967\nAs we shall see, few would have predicted Islamism\u2019s imminent rise to\nprominence in the years that immediately followed the Six Day War. What was obvious\nat the time, however, was the fact that the conflict had thoroughly delegitimated\nNasserism: the pan-Arabist ideology that had so thoroughly dominated the Arab world\nduring the prior decade. The deficiencies of Egypt\u2019s military leadership, the rash\ndecision to engage in brinksmanship with Israel at a time when the cream of the\nEgyptian army was bogged down more than 1,000 kilometers away in Yemen, and the\nsheer totality of Israel\u2019s victory combined to thoroughly discredited Nasserism in both\nEgypt and the broader Arab world.1424\nEgypt\u2019s defeat was so total and crushing, in fact, that, for a time, Nasser himself\nappeared to be in danger of losing power. Shortly before the war had ended, a group of\ngenerals had blamed him for the defeat and demanded that he step down immediately.\nChastened, Nasser announced his resignation in a televised speech to the stunned\nEgyptian people on the evening of June 9, 1967. His retirement ultimately proved to be\ntemporary. The regime and the ideology of Nasserism may have suffered black eyes as\na result of the war, but its leader continued to retain the affection of the masses.\nAccordingly, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians reacted to his address by pouring into\nthe streets of Cairo and demanding that he remain Egypt\u2019s leader. The impact of these\ndemonstrations was immediate. Nasser stayed in power while the officers who had so\n1424 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 92, 98\u2013101. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 519\nrecently tried to remove him instead found themselves purged or, in some cases,\nkilled.1425\nDefeat may have discredited Nasserism, but it did not weaken support for the\nradical economic policies or Arab nationalist views that lay at its core. Despite the\nenormous scale of the Arab states\u2019 failure against Israel, in fact, popular support for the\ncore ideas of Nasserism\u2014pan-Arabism, secular nationalism, and socialism\u2014remained\nstrong. As a result, rather than shifting to the right in response to Israel\u2019s triumph, the\npolitical center of gravity in much of the Arab world lurched sharply leftward in the years\nimmediately following the Six Day War. Indeed, both civic groups such as Egypt\u2019s\nheretofore-Nasserist Organization of Socialist Youth and states such as the People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic of South Yemen (PDRY) either outwardly embraced more radical\nMarxist-Leninist forms of Arab nationalism following the Six Day War or adopted policies\nand methods consistent with them. Thus, ironically, while the defeat in 1967 destroyed\nNasserism\u2019s credibility in the Arab world, it produced not a repudiation of the ideology\u2019s\nunderlying ideas but instead an embrace of more extreme versions of them.1426\nPolitical Changes\nThe changes in government that occurred in the wake of the war reflected this\nparadox. Just as had happened after 1948, the Arab states experienced a series of\ncoups following their defeat at Israeli hands. This time, however, the new regimes did\nnot turn against the prevailing ideology of the day as their predecessors had, but\ninstead doubled down on it. Libya\u2019s youthful Lieutenant Muammar el Qadaffi (r. 1969-\n2011) and Sudan\u2019s Colonel Ja\u2019far al-Numayri (r. 1969-1985) launched successful coups\nfollowing the Six Day War that replaced moderate governments with openly radical\nones. Meanwhile, in Iraq, a loose alliance of army officers and Ba\u2019athists led by Ahmed\nal-Bakr (r. 1968-1979) overthrew President Abd al-Rahman Arif (r. 1966-1968) and his\nNasserist prime minister, Tahir Yahya (1916-1986) and established a radical Ba\u2019athist\ngovernment. Finally, in Damascus, Defense Minister Hafiz al-Asad (r. 1970-2000)\npushed President Salah Jadid (r. 1966-1970) from power in a bloodless coup in 1970. In\nevery case but Syria\u2014which retained the same Ba\u2019athist regime under new\nleadership\u2014the change of government marked a substantial shift to the left.1427\nIsrael, the Palestinians, and the Occupied Territories\nWhile the Arabs grappled with the implications of defeat, the Israelis instead dealt\nwith the challenges of victory. The Israeli Defense Force\u2019s (IDF) staggering success in\n1967 presented the young country with a dilemma. On the one hand, the war had given\nit valuable strategic depth and had ended with it holding territories, particularly the West\nBank, that growing numbers of Israelis argued should\u2014for historical and religious\n1425 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 344\u2013\n45.\n1426 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 284\u2013313.\n1427 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 417; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 188\u201391. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 520\nreasons\u2014be incorporated into Israel. On the other, retention of the captured land raised\nseveral thorny problems beyond the obvious one that seizing territory through conquest\nis illegal. First, while the Labor Party coalition that ruled Israel intended from the start to\nretain the symbolically vital city of Jerusalem and the strategically important Jordan\nRiver valley, it had endorsed Resolution 242 and had thus committed Israel to swap\nmost of the land it had captured in the war in exchange for peace and diplomatic\nrecognition. Second, more than one-million Palestinians lived in the territories that\nadvocates of annexation most coveted: the Gaza Strip and, especially, the West Bank.\nAnnexing that land would thus confront the government with the unpalatable choice of\neither imposing a costly military occupation on the territories or granting citizenship to\nthe Palestinians who resided in them\u2014a move that would risk the Jewish demographic\ndominance of Israel that was intrinsic to the Zionist project. Prime Minister Levi\nEshkol (r. 1963-1969) neatly captured the crux of this dilemma in a remark to his\nsuccessor, Golda Meir (r. 1969-1974), after the war. \u201c\u2018The dowry pleases you,\u2019\u201d he\nquipped, \u201c\u2018but the bride does not.\u2019\u201d1428\nWhile the cabinet wrestled with these issues, popular pressure for annexation\nand the construction of settlements in the Occupied Territories increased rapidly.\nLeading the charge was a new movement, Greater Land of Israel, that formed shortly\nafter the war ended. Drawing support from adherents of Revisionist Zionism but also\nfrom a growing number of Laborites, it loudly demanded that the cabinet move quickly\nto annex the conquered territories. Greater Land of Israel did not merely lobby,\nmoreover. Instead, it also took direct action to ensure permanent control of the land that\nIsrael had conquered. Most notably, in parallel with the government\u2019s establishment of\nstrategic military settlements, its members began constructing illegal settlements in the\nWest Bank and Golan Heights in an effort to \u201c\u2018create facts\u2019\u201d that would, by their very\nexistence, prevent future Israeli cabinets from ever yielding those territories. Those\nwildcat settlements posed a serious challenge for Eshkol\u2019s government. Caught\nbetween its commitment to Resolution 242 and the popularity of Greater Land of Israel,\nhis cabinet equivocated before ultimately agreeing to retroactively approve the illegal\nsettlements\u2014a move that served only to encourage the annexationists to begin\nplanning further wildcat settlements.1429\nAt the same time, much as it had altered political views in Israel, so had the\nconquest of the territories profoundly reshaped the outlook and expectations of the\nPalestinians. Since 1949, they had, with some notable exceptions, patiently and\npassively waited for Arab leaders such as Nasser to put their bellicose rhetoric into\naction and crush Israel. The Arab defeat in 1967 had made a mockery of those\nexpectations. Rather than gaining self-rule as a result of the war, the one-million\n1428 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 307\u20138; quote from Paul T.\nChamberlin, The Global Offensive: The United States, the Palestine Liberation\nOrganization, and the Making of the Post-Cold War Order, Reprint edition (Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2012), 35.\n1429 Quote from Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 307\u20138; Morris, Righteous\nVictims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 335. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 521\nPalestinians who resided in the West Bank and Gaza Strip instead found themselves\nunder an oppressive occupation regime in which the despised Zionists\u2014who exercised\ntotal control of key resources such as water\u2014strove to prevent the emergence of any\nkind of organized opposition or nationalist movement. It was a dispiriting turn of events\nto say the least. The Israeli conquest of the territories did not end the Palestinians\u2019\naspirations for political independence, however. Instead, Tel Aviv\u2019s harsh rule and\nseeming desire to once again displace them from their land renewed the Palestinians\u2019\nsense of shared identity and rekindled their nationalist hopes\u2014just as the Zionist\nmovement had sparked the emergence of Palestinian nationalism during the first half of\nthe twentieth century.1430\nEgypt after the Six Day War\nIn the meantime, having solidified his political position in the aftermath of Egypt\u2019s\ndefeat in June 1967, Nasser moved to force a resolution of the conflict with Israel\nthrough a limited-war strategy. Begun with high hopes, that effort would ultimately fail to\nachieve that goal. Worse, coming at a time when the state-centered economic policies\nthat Nasser had championed were beginning to create real problems for Egypt, the\ndrive to force a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict would reveal that the Egyptian\npresident\u2019s expansive foreign and domestic policy goals were not merely in conflict but\nhad caught his regime in a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma.\nThe War of Attrition\nThe imbalance in power between the IDF and the militaries of the Arab states\nmade the task of resolving that conflict peculiarly difficult. As we have seen, Israel\u2019s\nmilitary preponderance was so total that it felt no pressure to make concessions, while\nthe Arab states were so weak that they had nothing with which to bargain. Faced with\nthis situation, Nasser devised a plan to end the impasse by waging a limited conflict in\nthe canal zone. With it, he aimed to achieve two goals. First, he hoped to make clear to\nTel Aviv that its continued occupation of the Sinai would come at an unacceptable cost.\nSecond, he sought to create a crisis that would impel the international community to\nforce Israel to withdraw from the land it had taken in 1967.\nIn preparation for this campaign, Nasser first took steps to buttress Egypt\u2019s\nmilitary, diplomatic, and fiscal positions. Toward that end, he pursued a rapprochement\nwith Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies shortly after the end of the Six Day War. The two\nsides quickly reached a deal. In exchange for Nasser withdrawing his troops from\nYemen, the Kuwaiti and Saudi governments agreed to provide Egypt with an annual\nsubsidy of $266 million. Nasser next moved to reequip his devastated army. With\nMoscow embarrassed by the poor performance of its proxies\u2019 Soviet-equipped\nmilitaries, he was able to persuade the Kremlin to quickly replace the arms that Egypt\nhad lost in 1967 with more advanced weapons including powerful surface-to-air missiles\n1430 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 336\u2013\n43. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 522\n(SAMs); in exchange he agreed to grant the USSR substantial additional basing\nrights.1431\nWith his fiscal situation stabilized and his military reequipped, Nasser followed by\nannouncing in March 1969 the start of the War of Attrition: an intense but limited\ncampaign in which Egyptian artillery bombarded the Bar-Lev Line, a defensive complex\nconsisting of a massive sand berm and a series of heavily fortified strongpoints that the\nIsraelis had constructed along the east bank of the canal.1432\nNasser\u2019s effort to compel negotiations in 1969 through a limited-war strategy got\noff to a poor start. The international community did not intervene, and Israel responded\nwith a retaliatory air offensive that not only mauled Egypt\u2019s antiaircraft defenses but\nalso\u2014to Nasser\u2019s great embarrassment\u2014struck targets deep inside the country. The\nEgyptian leader refused to back down, however. Desperate to restore the military\nbalance, he asked the Kremlin in January 1970 to provide yet-more weapons that would\ngive Egypt the strength to end Israel\u2019s dominance of the air. After initially balking,\nMoscow agreed to supply Egypt with squadrons of MiG-21 fighters and large numbers\nof advanced SAM missiles; more importantly, it also quietly sent 200 pilots to fly the jets\nand thousands of Soviet technicians to operate and support the anti-aircraft batteries.\nReinforced in this way, the Egyptian military was able to extend its SAM umbrella slowly\nand at great cost eastward into the Canal Zone over the spring and summer of 1970. At\nthat point Washington intervened. Fearing further escalation and the possibility of a\nsuperpower conflict, it succeeded in compelling both sides to accept a ceasefire under\nthe auspices of an otherwise still-born peace initiative.1433\nThe War of Attrition was at best a mixed success for Egypt. It is true that the\nfighting had succeeded in compelling the international community to pay attention to the\nArab-Israeli conflict and had allowed Egypt to extend its now much-more-powerful SAM\nnetwork into the Canal Zone\u2014a situation that put Nasser\u2019s armed forces in a\nsignificantly better strategic position than they had been at the start of the conflict. At the\nsame time, however, the improvement in the military balance hardly justified the\ndestruction of canal-side cities such as Isma\u2019iliyya in the fighting or, more importantly,\nthe deaths of an estimated 10,000 Egyptian soldiers and civilians.1434\nEconomic Problems\nThe cost of the War of Attrition also contributed substantially to a troubling\neconomic slowdown in Egypt. The stagnation marked a significant turnabout from the\nearly part of the decade. As we saw in chapter fourteen, the adoption of Arab Socialism\n1431 Morris, 344.\n1432 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 316\u201317.\n1433 Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 55\u201356; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict,\n316\u201317.\n1434 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 360\u2013\n63. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 523\nhad helped to produce an impressive economic expansion in the early 1960s\u2014one that\nhad not only produced a 30 percent increase in per-capita income but that had also\nhelped to fund expanded welfare benefits for industrial workers and to underwrite a new\nand more-aggressive program of land reform for the country\u2019s peasants. To the delight\nof the middle class, Nasser had even guaranteed government employment for all\ncollege graduates who could not otherwise find work.1435\nBy 1965, however, serious cracks had begun to appear. The reliance on foreign\nborrowing and imported commodities had created significant balance-of-payments\nissues that left Egypt struggling to service its debt. As a consequence, economic growth\nhad stalled and the poverty rate had begun to climb. Unsurprisingly the Six Day War\nexacerbated these problems. The conflict itself had not only imposed a substantial fiscal\ndrain on Egypt but had also deprived it of its three main sources of foreign currency\u2014\nexports from its Sinai oil fields, toll revenue from the now-closed Suez Canal, and\ntourism. Meanwhile, though Nasser had long-since learned that the state did not have\nanywhere close to enough jobs to meet the employment guarantee that he had rashly\ngiven to college graduates in 1962, he had neither modified nor abandoned his promise.\nInstead, he had responded by having the government provide unemployed degree\nholders with make-work jobs. By 1970, as a result, his employment pledge had left\nEgypt saddled with a bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that further dragged on its\neconomy.1436\nThe country\u2019s worsening economic situation created a serious dilemma for\nNasser. Since 1956, his regime had based its legitimacy on a combination of a rising\nstandard of living and the international prestige that it had enjoyed as a result of his role\nas the leading anti-Zionist and Arab-nationalist figure. By 1970, these competing\nagendas had trapped him in a variation of the classic guns-versus-butter quandary. If he\nmoved to ease his country\u2019s economic problems by abandoning his role as the leader of\nthe pan-Arab struggle against Israel, he risked losing the support of those Egyptians\nwho demanded justice for the Palestinians. If he instead pressed on with the struggle\nagainst Israel, he would impose new burdens on Egypt\u2019s already faltering socialist\neconomy that would lower living standards and thus alienate the masses.\nAnwar Sadat and the \u201cCorrective Revolution\u201d\nIt was not Nasser who would resolve this predicament, however. Instead, thanks\nto the Egyptian leader\u2019s sudden death from a heart attack in September 1970, the task\nof finding a way out of the trap into which Nasser had led Egypt fell to his vice president\nand successor, Anwar Sadat. The son of a minor bureaucrat, Sadat was a longtime\nArab nationalist and leading member of the Free Officers who, like Nasser, had joined\nthe army after the Wafd Party had opened the military academy to members of the\nlower-middle class. Considered a political lightweight, he appeared to be an unlikely\n1435 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 288.\n1436 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 171, 180; Rogan,\nThe Arabs, 264. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 524\ncandidate to resolve the dilemma that Nasser\u2019s policies had created. In fact, he had\nmanaged to secure the influential Arab Socialist Union\u2019s (ASU) pivotal endorsement of\nhis succession to the presidency only by promising the entrenched and powerful\npolitical figures who dominated it that he would continue his predecessor\u2019s policies and,\ncritically, that he would oversee a collective system of rule in which he would be no\nmore than a first-among equals.1437\nIt soon became clear, however, that Sadat\u2019s political rivals had badly\nunderestimated him. A shrewd operator, the new president deftly maneuvered them out\nof power in late 1970 and early 1971 by rallying to his side lower-ranking officers, mid-\ntier bureaucrats, leftists, the police, and others who loathed the ASU leadership for its\npart in the debacle in June 1967. He followed with what he called the \u201c\u2018corrective\nrevolution\u2019\u201d: a thorough restructuring of the government and the ruling party. Vast in\nscope, it included the extension of limited civil liberties, new elections for the ASU and\nthe National Assembly designed to purge those bodies of extreme Nasserites, and\u2014in\nacknowledgement of the reality that Arab unification schemes were dead\u2014a change in\nthe country\u2019s name from the United Arab Republic to the Arab Republic of Egypt. Thus,\ndismissed by many in 1970 as little more than a functionary, Sadat had succeeded in\neliminating all of his challengers and had consolidated power in his hands by mid\n1971.1438\nIn spite of his political victory, however, Sadat was in no position to rest on his\nlaurels. Instead, facing the same dilemma that had trapped his predecessor during his\nfinal years in power, he appeared to be caught between two equally ruinous options. On\nthe one hand, he could seek to revive the economy by ending the expensive\nmobilization of the Egyptian army\u2014a move that would effectively cede permanent\ncontrol of the Occupied Territories and the Sinai to Israel and thus turn Egyptian\nnationalists against him. On the other, he could continue Nasser\u2019s aggressive military\nposturing in hopes that it would force Israel to yield the lands it had acquired in 1967\u2014\nan approach that would further contribute to the country\u2019s declining economic prospects\nand therefore alienate the masses. It was a daunting and dangerous situation for Sadat,\none that would almost assuredly cost him his position as Egypt\u2019s president if he failed to\nquickly find a favorable resolution of it.1439\nTransforming the Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Yom Kippur War\nYear of Decision, 1971\nA shrewd statesman, Sadat opted for an innovative solution that he hoped would,\nby compelling Tel Aviv to engage in productive talks, free him from the binary choice of\neither saving the Egyptian economy or contesting Israel. It centered on improving\nrelations with the United States. Grasping that Washington held the key to resolving\n1437 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 113\u201318.\n1438 Cook, 119\u201323.\n1439 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 190; Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 127. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 525\nboth his country\u2019s domestic and foreign-policy problems, he would first, with American\nassistance, bring the costly contest with Israel to an end through a negotiated peace\nsettlement that would return the Sinai and\u2014hopefully\u2014the Occupied Territories to Arab\nrule in exchange for peace and recognition. Freed from the expense of the conflict with\nIsrael and now receiving American foreign aid thanks to its improved ties with\nWashington, Cairo would follow by restructuring and reviving Egypt\u2019s moribund\neconomy through a liberalization program designed to restore growth and prosperity.1440\nSadat launched his initiative in February 1971. It called for Israel to withdraw its\ntroops forty kilometers east of the Suez Canal; in exchange, Cairo would extend the\nexisting ceasefire with Tel Aviv, grant Israeli ships the right to transit the Suez Canal,\nand accept the return of peacekeepers to the Sinai. US-mediated peace talks aimed at\narriving at a final settlement on the basis of Resolution 242 would follow. It was a\nremarkable proposal\u2014one that constituted a dramatic break with the \u201cthree nos\u201d of the\nKhartoum Resolution. Nonetheless, it went nowhere. Golda Meier was unwilling to cede\nany territory without a full peace treaty, while US President Richard Nixon (r. 1969-\n1974) was leery of applying pressure to Israel lest he alienate the Jewish vote just\nbefore the upcoming presidential election. As a result, Tel Aviv was able to fend off\nSadat\u2019s proposal by insisting on unacceptable conditions such as Israel\u2019s retention of\nSharm al-Shaykh1441\nFrustrated, Sadat followed with an uncharacteristically amateurish move.\nDeclaring 1971 the \u201c\u2018year of decision,\u2019\u201d he insisted that Egypt was no longer willing to\ntolerate the \u201c\u2018no war, no peace\u2019\u201d situation that had prevailed since the end of the War of\nAttrition and would return to fighting if no progress was made toward a resolution of the\nArab-Israeli conflict. It was an obvious bluff and a poorly executed one at that. Golda\nMeir\u2019s government knew that Egypt was not prepared for war and left Sadat in the lurch\nby refusing to respond. Embarrassed, the Egyptian leader was only able to extricate\nhimself by lamely claiming that the Indo-Pakistani War that had broken out in December\n1971 had created too much international uncertainty for Egypt to resume fighting. The\nepisode did little to dispel doubts about Sadat\u2019s abilities. Internationally, the Israelis and\nAmericans concluded that he was a weak and impetuous ruler and no longer took his\npronouncements seriously. Domestically, his failure to back his words with actions had\nresulted in widespread demonstrations against his regime by frustrated nationalists. As\na result, the pressure on Sadat had ratcheted up considerably. If he wanted to remain\nEgypt\u2019s leader, he needed to produce tangible results\u2014and he needed to do so\nquickly.1442\n1440 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 41\u201342; Rogan, The Arabs, 364\u201366.\n1441 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 388\u2013\n91.\n1442 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 127\u201329; quotes from Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 390\u201391. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 526\nThe Road to War\nSadat demonstrated far greater skill in managing his next attempt to break the\nimpasse. Having failed to lure Tel Aviv to the negotiating table through a peace\nproposal, he shifted gears and began preparing to go to war. The conflict he sought was\nan unusual one, however. Sadat did not hope to destroy Israel or even to achieve a\ndecisive victory. Instead, he intended to wage a limited conflict aimed only at securing a\nmodest amount of territory on the east bank of the canal. Doing so, he believed, was all\nthat was needed to set the stage for genuine peace discussions. It would shake Israeli\nconfidence, compel Washington to help him negotiate with Tel Aviv, and end the\npsychological and military imbalance that had heretofore prevented the two sides from\nengaging in productive talks. As National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger (1923- ) later\nwrote, \u201cSadat aimed not so much for territorial gain but for a crisis that would alter the\nattitudes into which the parties were frozen\u2014and thereby open the way for\nnegotiations.\u201d1443\nHe first moved to prepare Egypt for the war by breaking with the USSR.\nExpressing anger about the gratingly imperious attitude of Soviet troops in Egypt and\nabout the Kremlin\u2019s foot dragging on arms deliveries, he abruptly ordered the expulsion\nof 15,000 Soviet advisors in July 1972. Most observers at the time viewed this move as\na rash action\u2014a case, in Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban\u2019s (1915-2002) words, of\nSadat taking \u201c\u2018an emotional satisfaction at the expense of his strategic and political\npower.\u2019\u201d In fact, it was a shrewd maneuver that paid manifold dividends to the Egyptian\nleader. First, by suggesting that Cairo was seeking to end its close relationship with the\nUSSR, it led the Nixon administration to reconsider its relationship with Egypt and thus\nset the stage for Washington to adopt a more even-handed approach to the Arab-Israeli\nconflict. Second, Sadat\u2019s move had the ironic effect of compelling Moscow to change\ncourse regarding the provision of weapons to Egypt. Fearing that it might lose access to\nthe valuable Egyptian bases from which its ships and aircraft tracked American missile\nsubmarines operating in the Mediterranean, Moscow quickly agreed to provide Sadat\nwith sophisticated new weapons. Accordingly, during late 1972 and early 1973, the\nEgyptian military received a huge infusion of new arms including MiG-23 jet fighters,\nSU-20 attack aircraft, advanced SAM batteries, late-model tanks, and powerful wire-\nguided Sagger antitank missiles. Finally, the eviction of Soviet advisors helped create a\nsense of complacency in Tel Aviv. Coming so soon after Sadat\u2019s failure to follow\nthrough with his threat during the \u201cyear of decision,\u201d the rupture between Cairo and\nMoscow led Israeli intelligence officials to conclude that Egypt was in no position to go\nto war in 1973.1444\nHaving secured new weapons and having set the stage for improved relations\nwith Washington, Sadat next moved to recruit allies in the Arab world. He began with\n1443 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 131; quote from Henry Kissinger, Years of Upheaval\n(Boston: Little Brown & Company, 1982), 460.\n1444 Eban quoted in Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 318\u201319; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History\nof the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 391; Rogan, The Arabs, 366. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 527\nSyria. Knowing that Asad was as determined to regain control of the Golan Heights as\nhe was to retake the Sinai, Sadat struck an agreement with the Syrian leader in April\n1973 to launch a coordinated, two-front attack on Israel designed to apply maximum\npressure on the IDF. He followed by securing Saudi support. Meeting with King Faisal\nbin Abdulaziz Al Saud (r. 1964-1975) in August 1973, he asked that Saudi Arabia\nsupport his military assault with a coordinated economic campaign designed to pressure\nIsrael\u2019s Western backers\u2014above all the US\u2014by cutting the export of Saudi petroleum\nto those countries after the war had begun. As we have seen, the oil weapon had\nproven ineffective in 1967; by 1973, however, the balance between consumer and\nproducer states had swung drastically in favor of the latter. Most significantly, Saudi\nArabia had supplanted the US as the world\u2019s swing producer and, as such, was in a\nposition to unleash the oil weapon with devastating effect against the suddenly\nvulnerable West. Well aware that the balance of power had shifted in favor of the\nproducer states, Faisal, assured Sadat of Saudi support and promised not only to\ndeploy the oil weapon once the war began, but, in the meantime, to provide Egypt with\nthe enormous sum of $500 million to help it prepare for the conflict.1445\nWith Riyadh now on board, the Egyptians and Syrians hurried to complete their\nplanning. They decided to launch the attack on Saturday, October 6, 1973, the same\ndate as Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. They chose the holiday for two\nreasons. First, since there would be no moonlight after midnight on that date, Egyptian\nengineers would be able to bring bridging equipment up to the canal undetected.\nSecond, since radio and television stations in Israel were closed on High Holy Days, the\nIDF would have difficulty mobilizing reservist; as a result, Egypt would be in a position to\ndeploy substantial forces across the canal before they faced the inevitable\ncounterattack.1446\nDespite close coordination in the run up to the war, however, Egypt and Syria\nhad in fact adopted very different strategies aimed at achieving decidedly different\nobjectives. From the start, Sadat had intended to wage a cautious, limited campaign\ndesigned to break the impasse that had obtained since the end of the Six Day War. His\ngenerals had consequently developed a plan in which Egyptian troops would cross the\ncanal and take up defensive positions ten kilometers to the east\u2014an approach that\nwould achieve Sadat\u2019s goal of shattering the status quo but that would also keep\nEgyptian ground forces safely under the cover of their powerful-but-immobile SAM\numbrella. This strategy was a sound one. It was not, however, likely to entice Damascus\nto join Egypt in attacking Israel. As Sadat knew, Asad wanted to retake the entire Golan\nHeights\u2014an objective that the Syrian army could only achieve if Egypt was committed\nto an all-out offensive. The Egyptian president consequently kept quiet about his true\nintentions, and instead told his Syrian counterpart in April 1973 that he intended to\nretake all of Egypt\u2019s lost territory and that his army would continue its offensive deep\ninto the Sinai. Believing, as a result, that he was on the same page as Sadat, Asad\nordered his generals to devise a strategy that called for the Syrian army to push forward\n1445 Yergin, The Prize, 593\u201398.\n1446 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 391. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 528\naggressively based on the erroneous assumption that Egypt\u2019s drive into the Sinai would\ntie down a large portion of the Israeli army. This difference in strategy was critical, and it\nwould have an enormous effect on the war and its outcome.1447\nThe Yom Kippur War\nTo the Israelis\u2019 shock, the Yom Kippur War, also known as the October War,\nbegan very differently than had any of the prior four Arab-Israeli conflicts. This time it\nwas the Arabs rather than the Israelis who caught the enemy napping and who, at first\nat least, flawlessly executed a series of complex and well-planned military operations. In\nthe north, the Syrians mounted a tactically sound offensive that scored significant gains\nand nearly unhinged Israel\u2019s defensive line in the Golan Heights. Egyptian troops\nperformed even more impressively in the south. After crossing the canal in dinghies and\nquickly erecting pontoon bridges, engineers used 450 water cannons to blast passages\nfor troops and vehicles in the sand berm that the Israelis had erected. As a result, the\nEgyptian army was able to push its way through the purportedly impregnable Bar-Lev\nLine with little difficulty. Indeed, by the evening of October 7, 100,000 troops, 13,500\nvehicles, and more than 1,000 tanks had taken up defensive positions ten kilometers\neast of the canal. Tel Aviv bordered on panic. Already surprised by the ease with which\nSadat\u2019s troops had broken through the first line of defense, Israeli leaders were\npositively stunned when the Egyptians easily swatted away a concerted counterattack\nby two IDF armored divisions in an engagement that cost the Israelis eighty tanks\u2014\nalmost as many as they had lost over the course of the entire Six Day War.1448\nAs the losses mounted, Tel Aviv became increasingly concerned that the Arab\nattack constituted an existential threat to Israel. Emblematic of this fear was the change\nin the demeanor of the country\u2019s normally confident defense minister, Moshe Dayan\n(1915-1981). Expressing panic for Israel\u2019s survival during the early days of the conflict,\nhe at one point histrionically declared that \u201c\u2018the third temple [meaning Israel] is going\nunder.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, shocked to learn that the Arabs had knocked out 500 tanks in the\nfirst three days of fighting, Prime Minister Golda Meir begged Washington to send\ndesperately needed equipment, supplies, and, especially, ammunition. Now serving as\nsecretary of state, Kissinger initially demurred. Assured by Sadat that Egypt\u2019s goals\nwere limited, he was leery of needlessly antagonizing the Arab oil states and believed\nthat a stalemate or even a minor defeat would leave Israel more tractable and thus\nwilling to make the concessions on which a durable peace depended.1449\nThe commencement of a huge Soviet effort to resupply Egypt and Syria on\nOctober 10 quickly changed his attitude, however. Symbolically turning the conflict into\na superpower proxy war, the Soviet move impelled Nixon and Kissinger to take steps to\n1447 Salim Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers: Americans, Arabs, and U.S.\u2013Middle East\nRelations in the 1970s (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2016), 117.\n1448 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 411\u2013\n19.\n1449 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 131\u201334; quote from Yergin, The Prize, 604.

The most important of those began on October 14, when\nmassive US Air Force C5-A Galaxy transport planes laden with supplies, tanks, and\nammunition began landing in Israel. Nixon soon went even further. On October 19, he\nrequested that congress provide Israel with an additional $2.2 billion of military aid\u2014an\namount greater than the total sum Israel had spent on defense in 1972.1450\nBolstered by the aid, the now fully mobilized IDF soon began to turn the tide.\nRealizing after a few days that the Egyptians were not going to advance beyond their\nprotective SAM umbrella, the Israelis concentrated their forces for a blistering\ncounterattack against Asad\u2019s overextended army. Driving the Syrians back nearly to\nDamascus, the attack not only effectively knocked Syria out of the war but, as\nimportant, also indirectly set the stage for Israeli success against Egypt. Key here was\nthe intervention of the USSR. As the IDF counteroffensive in the Golan was unfolding,\nMoscow began frantically pushing Sadat to order a new advance into the Sinai that\nwould relieve pressure on Asad\u2019s forces. The Egyptian leader initially refused, but,\nfacing insistent Soviet demands, soon relented. Accordingly, on October 14, Egyptian\nforces started advancing further into the Sinai\u2014moving well beyond not just the canal\nbut also, critically, the SAM umbrella that protected them from Israel\u2019s powerful air\nforce.1451\nThe offensive proved to be a disastrous mistake. Not only was the attack costly\u2014\nthe IDF knocked out 250 Egyptian tanks in just a few hours\u2014but it also completely\ndisarranged the carefully constructed defensive position that Sadat\u2019s soldiers had\nestablished near the canal. The Israelis were quick to take advantage. After breaking\nthrough to the east bank of the waterway on October 15, IDF troops stunned the\nEgyptians by securing a bridgehead on the west side of the canal. After briefly\nconsolidating their position, they began pushing south in a drive designed to cut the\nEgyptian Third Army off from its supply lines.1452\nIt was at that juncture that the Arab states and Iran unleashed the oil weapon.\nMeeting in Kuwait City, representatives of Iran and five Arab oil-producing states agreed\nto raise the price of a barrel of petroleum by a jaw-dropping 70 percent. Ramping up the\npressure, they announced the following day that they would immediately cut production\nby 5 percent and would continue to cut it by 5 percent each month \u201cuntil \u2018the total\nevacuation of Israeli forces from all Arab territory.\u2019\u201d They were not finished.

Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 530\nArab oil-producing states announced on October 20 that they were immediately\nembargoing the sale of petroleum to the US.1453\nThanks in part to the oil weapon, the war soon came to an end. On October 22,\nthe United Nations (UN) Security Council moved to bring the fighting to a stop through\nthe passage of Resolution 338. It called for a ceasefire, immediate implementation of\nResolution 242, and talks \u201caimed at establishing a just and durable peace.\u201d\nNonetheless, military operations did not immediately cease. Instead, Israel\u2019s effort to\nimprove its negotiating position by completing the encirclement of Egypt\u2019s Third Army\nextended the war for two more days. Indeed, it was only after the IDF\u2019s maneuvers led\nthe superpowers to engage in a brief bit of nuclear brinksmanship in support of their\nregional proxies that the fighting finally halted.1454\nThe Yom Kippur War was enormously consequential for the Middle East and\ngreatly redressed the imbalance in power between Israel and the Arab states that had\nprecluded productive negotiations after the Six Day War. Militarily, it is true, Israel had\nbounced back from its early setbacks and was in a stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis Egypt and\nSyria than it had been on the morning of October 6. At the same time, however, its near\ndefeat and its serious losses\u2014Israel suffered 2,838 dead and 8,800 wounded, and it\nlost 840 tanks and 103 aircraft\u2014had destroyed the hubris and sense of military\ninvulnerability that had gripped the Jewish state since 1967 and had left a stunned\nIsraeli government receptive to negotiations. The war was thus a major triumph for\nSadat. Hailed thereafter as the \u201cHero of the Crossing,\u201d he had succeeded in\nestablishing a very different diplomatic climate in the region than had existed since the\nSix Day War and, in so doing, had\u2014for the first time\u2014created the proper conditions for\nIsrael and the Arab states to finally begin to negotiate a resolution of the region\u2019s most\nbitter and enduring conflict.1455\nTransforming the Arab-Israeli Conflict: The PLO\nMeanwhile, at the same time that the Egyptian government was groping for a\nway out of the costly Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestinians were moving to once more\ntake charge of the struggle with Israel. That effort began almost before the Six Day War\nhad ended. Fed up with the Arab states\u2019 inability to restore them to their land,\nPalestinian militant groups initiated a new campaign of terrorist and insurgent attacks\nbeginning in 1967. Though their efforts failed to meaningfully harm Israel, they\nnonetheless had important consequences. They restored hope to the Palestinian\npeople, put their national aspirations back on the front burner internationally, and won\nsubstantial diplomatic support for their cause. Above, all they proved pivotal in helping\n1453 Yergin, The Prize, 606\u20139.\n1454 Quote from \u201cUnited Nations Resolution 338,\u201d October 22, 1973; Daniel Sargent, A\nSuperpower Transformed: The Remaking of American Foreign Relations in the 1970s\n(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 150\u201351.\n1455 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 45\u201346; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 324\u201326. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 531\nto turn what had been, since 1948, an interstate dispute back into a conflict between\ncompeting nationalisms.\nThe Palestine Liberation Organization and Fatah\nFor the Palestinians, the years between 1949 and 1967 had been dark ones.\nExpelled from their homes in 1948, the majority lived during that period in crowded\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria,\nthe Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip, and the Jordanian-controlled West Bank. As we\nsaw in chapter fourteen, the Palestinians were not treated well by the governments of\nthose states. Denied the right to citizenship or employment everywhere but Jordan, they\nled a meager existence as stateless refugees\u2014unable to meaningfully improve their\ncircumstances let alone recover their lost homes. Too weak to challenge Israel, they\nplaced their hopes for redemption in the hands of pan-Arabist leaders such as Nasser\nwho, knowing that tough talk toward Israel played well with the masses, launched\nfrequent broadsides against the Jewish state and promised to destroy it when the time\nwas right.1456\nThe Palestinians were not completely inert between 1949 and 1967, however. In\nthe late 1950s and early 1960s, they had established a number of competing\norganizations dedicated to liberating Palestine. The most important of these was the\nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO). It originated out of a call Nasser had made in\nthe early 1960s for a new body to coordinate the Palestinians\u2019 resistance to Israel. At\nhis urgings, the Palestine National Council (PNC)\u2014which functioned as a legislature in\nexile\u2014met in May 1964 to establish the new organization and to draft its covenant, the\nPalestine National Charter. Uncompromising in tone and objectives, that document\nforthrightly called both for the destruction of Israel and for the establishment of a\nPalestinian state in the entirety of the former mandate.1457\nDespite a great deal of sound and fury, however, the charter amounted at the\ntime to little more than empty words. It was Nasser rather than the Palestinians who\ncontrolled the PLO, and he had proposed its establishment not to create an organization\nthat could lead an armed insurgency against the Jewish state but merely to build the\nimpression that he was actively supporting Palestinian efforts to liberate their homeland\nand, thus, to rebut intense criticism from his Arab rivals for his failure to back his anti-\nIsraeli rhetoric with action. He certainly had no intention of inviting IDF reprisals by\npermitting the PLO to raid Israel from Egyptian territory; in fact, he deliberately arranged\nfor a passive functionary, the Lebanese-born Palestinian diplomat Ahmad\nShuqayri (1908-1980), to serve as the first chairperson of the organization, and he\nsecured a pledge from Shuqayri that the PLO would\u2014under no circumstances\nwhatsoever\u2014undertake an attack on Israel from Egyptian-controlled territory.1458\n1456 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 230\u201331.\n1457 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 33.\n1458 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 198\u201399. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 532\nIn contrast, a competing organization called Fatah was forthright in its\ncommitment to armed struggle. Founded in Kuwait in 1959 by a group of Palestinians\nheaded by Yasir Arafat (1929-2004), it eschewed a commitment to pan-Arabism or\nMarxism in favor of a non-ideological\u2014albeit leftist\u2014approach. As such, it did not\nconcern itself in the early 1960s with the broader pan-Arabist effort to unify the Arab\nworld and instead focused on liberating Palestine through the same violent guerrilla\ntactics that anticolonial organizations had successfully employed in in places like\nVietnam and Indonesia. Enjoying the support of the Syrian government, which at the\ntime was seeking to displace Egypt as the leader of the anti-Zionist cause, Fatah\u2019s\nguerilla soldiers, or fedayeen, began launching raids against Israel from Syrian and\nJordanian-controlled territory in January 1965. Though those operations were almost\nuniversally unsuccessful, they compared favorably with the unwillingness of Arab\nleaders like Nasser to match their tough rhetoric toward Israel with action; as a result,\nthe organization quickly won the support of many Palestinians.1459\nUltimately, however, it was the events that followed the Six Day War rather than\nthese ineffectual raids that vaulted Fatah to prominence. Initially, the organization\nresponded to the Israeli seizure of the West Bank by undertaking insurgent operations\nagainst the occupying forces. Believing that it could spark a spontaneous \u201c\u2018popular\nrebellion\u2019\u201d among the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories, it began with an\n\u201c\u2018interior\u2019\u201d campaign in the late summer and fall of 1967 in which fedayeen launched\nattacks from within the occupied West Bank. As poorly executed as it was organized,\nthe operation soon collapsed in the face of Israel\u2019s brutally efficient counterinsurgency\ntactics. Fatah was undeterred, however, and responded not by ceasing its attacks but\ninstead by shifting to an \u201c\u2018exterior\u2019\u201d strategy in which guerrillas raided Israeli-controlled\nterritory from bases in Jordan. In the immediate term, these attacks were only\nmarginally more effective than the \u201c\u2018interior\u2019\u201d campaign and thus had little direct\nconsequence for either Israelis or Palestinians. Leading as they did to a fateful, IDF\nretaliatory attack against the Jordanian village of Karameh on March 21, 1968, however,\nthe cross-border raids would come to have a significant, long-term impact\u2014one that\nwould dramatically alter the nature and direction the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.1460\nKarameh, March 1968\nLaunched in response to Fatah incursions, the attack on Karameh aimed to\ndestroy the organization\u2019s forward headquarters. The Israelis anticipated that the raid\nwould follow the pattern of earlier punitive operations: IDF soldiers would seize control\nof the village, kill a few guerrillas, and demolish a large number of houses before\nleisurely returning to Israel. This time, however, the operation did not follow the usual\npattern. Instead, knowing that they enjoyed the support of Jordanian artillery and tanks\ndug in on the heights overlooking the village, the fedayeen decided to stand their\nground. As a result, the IDF troops that approached Karameh found themselves in an\n1459 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 114\u201315.\n1460 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 365\u2013\n68. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 533\nunexpectedly serious firefight with tough, disciplined Fatah militants. Though they did\nmanage to push their way into the village, the Israelis incurred serious losses\u2014thirty-\nthree dead, 161 wounded, four tanks destroyed, and a fighter-bomber shot down\u2014and\nended up retreating in disarray back across the Jordan River.1461\nThe battle was a watershed moment for Fatah that benefitted the organization in\na number of ways. First, thanks to its success against the IDF\u2014and to King Hussein\u2019s\n(r. 1952-1999) willingness to let the organization take full credit for the victory\u2014Fatah\nwas able to establish itself as the leading organization in the broader Palestinian\nresistance movement. Recruits thereafter flocked to its banner, and it soon enjoyed the\nstrength to impose its control over the refugee camps near the Jordanian capital of\nAmman. Second, Fatah was able to translate its military success into significant\nfinancial support from the increasingly wealthy Gulf principalities\u2014funding that gave it a\ndegree of independence from states like Egypt and Syria that had long sought to control\nthe Palestinian militant groups. Finally, Karameh helped win the diplomatic backing of\nscores of newly independent states in the Developing World that saw in the Palestinian\nstruggle echoes of their own recent anticolonial efforts. As we shall see, their assistance\nwould prove invaluable in the Fatah-led campaign to secure international recognition of\nthe Palestinian cause in the 1970s.1462\nKarameh also permitted Arafat to assume a dominant position within the PLO. By\nearly 1968, that organization was in serious disarray. Espousing restraint at a time when\nPalestinians were pushing for direct action, it appeared to be out of touch and risked\ncollapsing into irrelevance. Indeed, members of the PLO\u2019s executive board gave serious\nconsideration to dissolving the organization in the wake of the Six Day War. Ultimately,\nhowever, they rejected that course of action. Instead, aware that the PLO\u2019s founding\nunder the auspices of the PNC lent it a degree of legitimacy that other resistance\ngroups lacked, executive committee members moved to remake the PLO into a\ngenuinely independent, Palestinian-controlled umbrella organization. In short order, they\nforced the ineffectual Shuqayri to resign, established the PLO\u2019s autonomy from Nasser,\nand invited militant groups like Fatah to join. They also opted to assign seats on the\nrevamped executive committee to the different Palestinian resistance groups on the\nbasis of their size.1463\nThis last move was enormously beneficial to Fatah. Enjoying broad support\namong Palestinians thanks to its victory at Karameh, it assumed a controlling position in\nthe PLO and secured Arafat\u2019s election as the organization\u2019s new chair\u2014a post he would\nhold continuously from February 1969 until his death in 2004. Arafat and the other\nFatah leaders wasted little time in bringing the PLO\u2019s goals and methods in line with\ntheir more explicitly militaristic approach. Most notably, they successfully amended the\nPalestine National Charter so that it called for the liberation of Palestine through \u201c\u2018armed\n1461 Morris, 368\u201370.\n1462 Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 46\u201349; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of\nthe Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 369\u201370.\n1463 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 313\u201314. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 534\nstruggle,\u2019\u201d and they declared the organization\u2019s primary goal to be the establishment of\na secular Palestinian state in the entirety of the former mandate.1464\nSplinter Groups\nFatah was not the only Palestinian militant group to gain prominence following\nthe Six Day War, however. Beginning in 1968, a number of smaller, newly created\nsplinter groups also won followings by launching guerrilla and terrorist attacks on Israel.\nMotivated by the same far-left ideologies that were sweeping through the Arab states\nfollowing the decline of Nasserism, organizations such as the Palestinian Popular\nStruggle Front (PPSF), the Iraqi-dominated Arab Liberation Front (ALF), George\nHabash\u2019s (1926-2008) Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and its\noffshoots, the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PDFLP) and the\nPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine \u2013 General Command (PFLP-GC), took a\nfar-more extreme and uncompromising line than did the more ideologically flexible\nFatah. Those groups also adopted a more transnational outlook and strategy than did\nArafat\u2019s organization. Most notably, committed as they were to both Marxism and pan-\nArabism, they believed that the radicalization and unification of the Arab states had to\noccur before the militants could defeat Israel and redeem Palestine.1465\nJoining the PLO shortly after Fatah, these groups greatly complicated Arafat\u2019s\nability to direct the organization. In hopes of precluding internecine conflict, he had from\nthe start adopted an inclusive approach wherein the constituent organizations would\nresolve their differences through consensus, compromise, and negotiation rather than\nthrough conflict. Unfortunately for Arafat, the PFLP and PDFLP\u2014soon renamed the\nDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)\u2014were ideologically inflexible\nand thus disinclined to follow his consensual approach. Indeed, they not only engaged\nin factional infighting within the PLO, but, more importantly, used Arafat\u2019s commitment\nto consensus and compromise to box him in. Insisting that the organization maintain a\nhardline approach, for example, they prevented the PLO chair from taking advantage of\npassing opportunities and they delayed vital policy changes such as a shift from the\nunobtainable goal of destroying Israel to a more-realistic willingness to accept a\nPalestinian state confined to the Gaza Strip and West Bank.1466\nParticularly problematic for Arafat were the radical groups\u2019 terrorist operations.\nToo small to mount effective attacks across the heavily defended border between\nJordan and the West Bank, the PFLP and DFLP instead focused on high-profile\noperations against soft targets abroad. The PFLP initiated this new approach in July\n1968 when it hijacked an El Al airliner and successfully exchanged the hostages it had\ntaken for fifteen Palestinian prisoners. Wildly successful in drawing world attention to\nthe Palestinian cause, the operation spurred the organization to follow with further\nhijackings in 1969. Meanwhile, in February 1970, the smaller PFLP-GC joined the\n1464 Gelvin, 199; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 313\u201314.\n1465 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 313.\n1466 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 204\u20138. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 535\ncampaign in spectacular fashion by detonating a bomb on a Swissair flight that killed all\nforty-seven people on board.1467\nArafat had been unenthusiastic about such operations through that point but\ncould accept them as a modest price to pay for unity within the PLO. The PFLP\u2019s terror\nattacks in Jordan in 1970 were a different matter altogether, however. These operations\nemerged out of the splinter organizations\u2019 ideological commitment to effecting radical\npolitical change in the Arab world as a first step in their campaign against Israel.\nDeclaring \u201c\u2018that the road to Jerusalem begins in Amman,\u2019\u201d the PFLP and DPFLP\nmaintained that they had to first replace King Hussein\u2019s conservative government with a\nradical, Palestinian one before they could mount an effective challenge to the Jewish\nstate. Accordingly, the splinter groups moved to spark a Palestinian revolution in Jordan\nby launching a series of terrorist attacks designed to embarrass and weaken Hussein\u2019s\ngovernment. These included two assassination attempts against the king, the seizure of\nthirty-three Western hostages at popular tourist hotels in June 1970, and, most\nspectacularly, the destruction of three hijacked Western airliners at a derelict RAF\nairfield just outside Amman in September 1970.1468\nBlack September, September 1970\nThe hijacking incident was the final straw for Hussein. Furious both that the\nmilitant groups were challenging his rule and that Arafat had established what\namounted to an autonomous Palestinian state in Jordan replete with tax collectors,\ncourts, and uniformed military personnel, he ordered his army to move against PLO\nforces in the camps shortly after the PFLP\u2019s destruction of the three airliners. In a civil\nconflict known as Black September, Hussein\u2019s troops handily crushed Arafat\u2019s forces\nand seized control of the camps in and around Amman\u2014killing an estimated 3,500\nPalestinians in the process. A new offensive pushed the organization out of Jordan\naltogether the following year. Transiting through Syria, PLO guerrillas set up a new base\nof operations in Lebanon in the fall of 1971. Taking full advantage of an autonomy deal\nthat Nasser had brokered in 1969 to ease a growing conflict between the PLO guerrillas\nand the Lebanese government, Arafat quickly established what amounted to a\nPalestinian state-within-a-state in southern Lebanon and began organizing attacks\nacross the border with Israel.1469\nThe PLO\u2019s Global Offensive\nShortly after its relocation to Lebanon, however, the PLO largely abandoned its\nefforts to bring the fight directly to Israel. Two factors produced this change. First, at a\nlength of only 81 kilometers, Israel\u2019s border with Lebanon is considerably shorter than\n1467 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 376\u2013\n78.\n1468 Morris, 370, 373\u201374; quote from Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 208.\n1469 Robins, A History of Jordan, 138\u201339; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict,\n322\u201324. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 536\nthe frontier that divides it and the occupied West Bank from Jordan and was thus much\nmore difficult to cross undetected. Second, the PLO had never managed to devise a set\nof tactics for combating the overwhelmingly powerful IDF. As a result, while the\norganization continued to mount the occasional fedayeen raid across the border and to\nlob shells into Israel, it shifted in 1971 to a new approach in its effort to secure a state.\nThereafter, it pursued what the historian Paul Thomas Chamberlin calls the \u201cglobal\noffensive\u201d\u2014a strategy designed to draw international attention to the Palestinians\u2019\nsituation and to build support for their cause across the world.1470\nThe PLO waged this campaign on two fronts: one ideological, the other\noperational. First, using the existing rhetoric of anti-colonial liberation and emphasizing\nthat it was fighting a \u201c\u2018common imperial enemy,\u2019\u201d the organization waged a skilled\npublic-relations campaign aimed at linking the Palestinian cause to other national\nliberation movements in the Global South such as the Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale\n(FLN) in Algeria and the National Liberation Front (NLF) in South Vietnam, as well as to\nradical terrorist organizations like Germany\u2019s Baader-Meinhof Gang and the Japanese\nRed Army. While the embrace of radicalism and anti-colonial ideas was more a matter\nof tactics than conviction for Fatah, it was central to the more-ideologically rigid splinter\ngroups. Indeed, those organizations were unflinching in their support for radical social\nand political change. Most notably, making clear its commitment to both national and\nwomen\u2019s liberation, the PFLP unabashedly assigned women such as Leila\nKhaled (1944- ) and Amina Dahbour (1945- ) to lead many of the organization\u2019s high-\nprofile hijacking operations.1471\nSuch incidents were a core part of the Global Offensive\u2019s other component: the\noperational front. Aimed at drawing attention to the Palestinian cause, PLO \u201c\u2018external\noperations\u2019\u201d included the assassination of Jordan\u2019s Prime Minister Wasfi Tal (1919-\n1971) in November 1971 by a shadowy new group affiliated with Fatah called the Black\nSeptember Organization. More spectacular were two incidents in 1972: a brutal PFLP-\naffiliated Japanese Red Army operation in which gunmen killed twenty-six people at\nIsrael\u2019s Lod International Airport in May and, especially, the Black September terrorist\nattack at the Munich Olympics that September that resulted in the murder of eleven\nIsraeli athletes.1472\nThe PLO\u2019s Global Offensive effected a rapid shift in international public opinion\nregarding the conflict between Israel and the Arab states. The use of national-liberation\nrhetoric and the establishment of transnational linkages with other revolutionary, non-\nstate actors raised the organization\u2019s stature and won it the sympathy of people living in\nrecently decolonized African and Asian states. Likewise, the terrorist attacks ensured\nthat the issue of the Palestinians remained at the center of global affairs. The\ngovernments of newly independent states did express regret at the loss of life in those\n1470 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 119, 125; quote from Chamberlin,\nThe Global Offensive, 5, 148.\n1471 Rogan, The Arabs, 348\u201349; Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 4\u20135, 52\u201353, 157.\n1472 Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 142\u201374, quote from page 148. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 537\nincidents, but, having themselves only recently\u2014and often forcefully\u2014thrown off\nimperial rule, they also vigorously defended the Palestinian struggle for self-\ndetermination and maintained that violence remained a legitimate tool in the pursuit of\nnational liberation. The Global Offensive\u2019s success in altering perceptions of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict is perhaps rendered clearest in the verbiage of a UN General Assembly\nResolution on terrorism passed in December 1972. Though that resolution called for\ninternational efforts to control terrorism, it also upheld the right of colonized people to\nuse violence to achieve national liberation and forthrightly condemned states that\n\u201cden[ied] peoples their legitimate right to self determination and independence.\u201d1473\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the PLO\u2019s global offensive proved especially fruitful in\nthe Arab world. It not only raised the organization\u2019s stature, but, more importantly, also\nhelped it to gain official standing with the Arab League. That change occurred at the\nArab League Summit held in Rabat, Morocco in October 1974. There, the member\nstates formally rejected King Hussein of Jordan\u2019s longstanding claim to represent the\nPalestinians. Instead, acknowledging that Arafat\u2019s organization enjoyed the support of\nthe overwhelming majority of Palestinians and noting both the extent of its global\nterrorist operations and the success of its diplomatic initiatives, it voted to recognize the\nPLO as \u201cthe sole legitimate representative organization for the Palestinian people in any\nPalestinian territory that is liberated.\u201d1474\nAs its role in securing official standing for the PLO made clear, moreover, the\nglobal offensive also played a key part in accelerating the transformation of the Arab-\nIsraeli conflict back into a contest between rival nationalisms. For years, as we have\nseen, the Palestinians had been passive observers in that struggle\u2014a people who\nlooked to leaders like Nasser to restore them to the land they had lost in 1948. Thanks\nto the failure of Arab armies in the Six Day War and the success of the PLO\u2019s global\noffensive, however, the dynamics of the Arab-Israeli contest had changed. Enjoying the\nrecognition of nearly all Palestinians and a growing number of states, the PLO\nhenceforth took the lead in the conflict with Israel. No longer, in other words, were the\nPalestinians wards of the Arab states or dependent upon them for their salvation;\ninstead, under the PLO, they enjoyed agency in their struggle for the first time since\n1948.\nProgress and Frustration: Peace Talks, 1973-1977\nIn the meantime, the shocking events of the Yom Kippur War thoroughly\nscrambled the Arab-Israeli conflict. Thanks to Egypt\u2019s military success and to the Arab\noil producers\u2019 newfound global economic clout, the imbalance in power between Israel\nand the Arab states had been narrowed to such a degree that the two sides agreed to\n1473 Chamberlin, 175\u2013217, quote from page 180.\n1474 \u201cSeventh Arab League Summit Conference Resolution on Palestine,\u201d October 28,\n1974, https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-194621/. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 538\ntake part in peace talks for the first time. As a result, for a brief period after the 1973\nWar, hopes were high that a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict was at hand.\nThe Geneva Conference, December 1973\nThe peace talks began in December 1973 when the US and USSR cosponsored\na meeting in Geneva under the aegis of the UN for the purpose of securing a settlement\non the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338. The conference was well attended. All of the\nrelevant parties sent representatives save for Syria and the PLO\u2014the former because\nAsad insisted that Israel had to pledge to withdraw from all of the Occupied Territories\nas a precondition for his country\u2019s participation and the latter because Washington and\nTel Aviv objected to the organization\u2019s participation. The conference opened on\nDecember 21. After a series of speeches, the attendees ended the meeting\u2019s first day\nby voting to put the conference on hold until the belligerent states had first negotiated a\nseries of bilateral disengagement agreements designed to disentangle their military\nforces. It never restarted. Instead, thanks to Washington\u2019s desire to exclude the USSR\nfrom the peace process, the negotiations ended up following a bilateral path rather than\nthe multilateral approach envisioned at Geneva.1475\nThe PLO\u2019s Diplomatic Push\nMeanwhile, at the same time that the diplomats were preparing for the Geneva\nConference, moderates in the PLO were beginning to promote a strategy oriented not\non force but instead on diplomacy. They pursued this new approach for two reasons.\nFirst, they feared that the continued construction of settlements in the West Bank would\neventually result in so many Jewish people living in the territory that future Israeli\ngovernments would be unable to cede it even if they wanted to; in other words, time\nwas not on the Palestinians\u2019 side. Second, Arafat and his advisors perceived that the\nYom Kippur War had altered the diplomatic situation and had made possible a\ncomprehensive peace agreement that could potentially include provisions for a\nPalestinian state.1476\nAs Arafat was well aware, however, participation in the peace talks would require\nthe PLO to take two important steps. First, it would need to cease the operational side\nof the global offensive\u2014meaning, in other words, that it would need to end the military\nand terrorist attacks that had proven so effective at bringing attention to the Palestinian\ncause. Second, it would have to devise realistic negotiating positions that could serve\nas the basis for productive discussions. Accordingly, in late 1973, Arafat and his allies\nbegan to shut down the PLO\u2019s military operations. As important, they also started to lay\nthe groundwork for the abandonment of the organization\u2019s longstanding support for a\none-state solution, wherein the Palestinians would establish a state in the entire territory\nof the former mandate, in favor of a two-state solution, wherein they would have a state\n1475 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 152; Rogan, The Arabs, 371\u201372.\n1476 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 334; Chamberlin, The Global\nOffensive, 218\u201319. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 539\nin the Occupied Territories that stood alongside an Israeli one that existed within its pre-\n1967 borders.1477\nShifting to a diplomatic approach did not promise to be easy, however. Arafat\nand the other moderates understood that the pursuit of a negotiated settlement and,\nespecially, the promotion of a two-state solution would generate fierce opposition within\nthe Palestinian community. To a degree, this was a problem of Fatah\u2019s own making.\nThough its leadership had been well aware that the fedayeen lacked the power to\ndefeat the IDF and conquer Israel, it had nonetheless publicly maintained that the\nPalestinians could, through revolutionary action, achieve a complete triumph that would\nresult in them regaining control of all of their ancestral lands. Primed in this way to\nbelieve that a total victory was possible, most Palestinians would strongly oppose a\ncompromise solution and would instead demand the unconditional success that Fatah\nhad earlier promised.1478\nTwo important groups were particularly inclined to resist any settlement short of a\ntotal victory. Drawn largely from the Palestinians who had fled Israel in 1948 and who\nnow lived in the refugee camps, the bulk of the PLO\u2019s guerrillas were strongly against a\nresolution to the conflict that did not permit them to return to their homes in Israel\nproper. Meanwhile, the more radical splinter groups\u2014particularly the PFLP-GC and\nGeorge Habash\u2019s PFLP\u2014were opposed to any compromise settlement. In fact, those\norganizations had earlier declared that the peace process between Israel and the Arab\nstates was an act of treachery and had demanded that Arafat promise to refrain from\ntaking part in the talks. The PFLP-GC had even tried to torpedo negotiations by\nlaunching a bloody terrorist attack against the Israeli village of Kirva Shimona in April\n1974.1479\nArafat and his allies thus had to walk a very fine line. They needed to make clear\nto Israel and its Western supporters that the organization would accept a two-state\nsolution, and they needed to do so in such a way that did not alienate the many\nPalestinians who remained focused on securing a total victory. Their answer was to\ncarefully characterize the organization\u2019s willingness to accept a rump state in the West\nBank and Gaza Strip not as the end product of a two-state solution\u2014which was in fact\nthe goal that they now sought\u2014but instead as merely the first step in a larger effort\naimed at eventually retaking all of Palestine.1480\nThe PLO leadership moved forward with this strategy in June 1974 at the twelfth\nPNC meeting when it formally endorsed a new statement of strategy: the Ten-Point\nProgram. A formal expression of the organization\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis the ongoing peace\n1477 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 125; Chamberlin, The Global\nOffensive, 218\u201321.\n1478 Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 221\u201325.\n1479 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 208; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli\nConflict, 335\u201336.\n1480 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 164\u201365. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 540\nprocess, this document reaffirmed the PLO\u2019s traditional commitment to armed struggle\nand to the reconquest of all of Palestine. Crucially, however, it also declared that the\norganization would \u201cemploy all means\u201d toward the achievement of that goal including\nthe establishment of a \u201cnational authority\u201d in liberated territories as an interim step. To\nthe untrained eye, this declaration may have appeared to be just a recapitulation of the\nPLO\u2019s earlier hardline position, but it in fact marked a dramatic change: with it, the\norganization signaled\u2014however elliptically\u2014that it was open to negotiations and that\nhenceforth it was willing to accept a ministate in the occupied Gaza Strip and West\nBank.1481\nIf the full import of the Ten-Point Program was not apparent to the casual\nobserver, it was emphatically clear to those attuned to the subtleties of diplomatic\nlanguage. US State Department officials immediately grasped that the document\nmarked both the PLO\u2019s implicit acceptance of Israel\u2019s right to exist and its willingness to\nsettle for a ministate in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinian hardliners in splinter\ngroups like the PFLP and the ALF likewise understood the document\u2019s thrust. They\nwere not happy about it. Furious that Arafat was willing to consider anything less than a\ntotal victory, they moved to counter the Ten Point Program by organizing the\nRejectionist Front. Under its banner, they issued propaganda broadsides against Arafat\nand the moderates and sought to rally Palestinians against any move toward a two-\nstate solution. The existence of the front significantly constrained Arafat and his allies.\nThey understood that if they publicly pursued a diplomatic settlement and then failed to\nattain one, the more militant groups would be able to exploit the resulting frustration\namong the Palestinian people to make substantial political inroads at their expense.\nAccordingly, Arafat and his supporters remained coy about their diplomatic goals and\ncontinued to disguise their support for negotiations and their acceptance of a two-state\nsolution in extremist rhetoric.1482\nBuilding on the success of the Global Offensive, the PLO\u2019s turn to diplomacy\nproduced some exciting achievements following the Yom Kippur War. Three stand out.\nFirst, the UN invited Arafat to address the world body in November 1974. His speech\nwas enthusiastically received, and the UN General Assembly followed by granting\nofficial observer status to the PLO. Second, thanks to a combination of rising sympathy\nfor the Palestinian people and fear of the oil weapon, states like France extended de\nfacto recognition to the organization. Finally, the PLO\u2019s successful lobbying and the\ngrowing power of the globe\u2019s developing states resulted in the UN General Assembly\nissuing a resolution in 1975 declaring that \u201cZionism is a form of racism and racial\ndiscrimination.\u201d1483\n1481 Quote from \u201cTen Point Plan of the PLO,\u201d June 8, 1974,\nhttps://ecf.org.il/media_items/995; Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 164\u201365.\n1482 Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 237\u201340, 252.\n1483 Quote from \u201cUN Resolution 3379,\u201d November 10, 1975,\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761 Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 541\nThese were important achievements, and they marked a dramatic improvement\nin the Palestinians\u2019 position in a remarkably brief period. At the same time, however, the\nPLO was unable to build on them or even to use them to secure a seat at the peace\ntalks. What accounted for this failure? Why had the PLO\u2019s diplomatic initiative flopped?\nTwo factors worked together to thwart the PLO\u2019s diplomatic offensive. First,\nWashington and Tel Aviv remained unwilling to negotiate with the organization. Arguing\nthat the establishment of a Palestinian state in the territories \u201c\u2018would be the beginning of\nthe end of the State of Israel,\u2019\u201d Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (r. 1974-1977, 1992-1995)\nsteadfastly refused to take part in direct talks with the PLO or to countenance\nconcessions that could lead to the creation of a Palestinian state in the territories.\nUnwilling to apply pressure to its most important regional ally, Washington supported his\nstance. Second, the Palestinians\u2019 internal political differences prevented Arafat from\nmaking concessions that might force Israel to negotiate. It is conceivable that he might\nhave leveraged the PLO\u2019s newfound international political strength to overcome\nWashington and Tel Aviv\u2019s opposition to direct talks if he could have openly declared\nthe organization\u2019s willingness both to recognize Israel and to settle for a ministate in the\nOccupied Territories. However, the political threat posed by the splinter groups\ncompelled Arafat to continue to call publicly for unconditional victory\u2014a position that\ngave Washington and Tel Aviv the excuse they needed to refuse to negotiate. As a\nresult, the PLO would remain outside the formal peace process during the 1970s.1484\nShuttle Diplomacy\nIn the meantime, the disengagement talks that had started in Geneva in\nDecember 1973 had begun to produce tangible progress. Taking charge of the\ndiplomatic effort to disentangle the military forces of the combatants, Secretary of State\nKissinger used shuttle diplomacy\u2014so called because it involved him shuttling back and\nforth by plane between Tel Aviv, Cairo, and Damascus\u2014to lay the groundwork for a\nseries of promising disengagement agreements based on Resolution 242. It was a\ngrueling effort. Traveling nearly 39,000 kilometers on forty-one separate flights and\ndealing with obstinate rulers like Asad and Rabin, Kissinger won plaudits in the press for\nhis apparently single-minded determination to end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for\nall.1485\nAppearances, in this case, were deceiving. In reality, the secretary of state was\nnot seeking a comprehensive settlement based on Resolution 242. Instead, he was\nplaying a very careful diplomatic gambit designed to achieve two related American\nobjectives: weakening the USSR\u2019s position in the Middle East and strengthening Israel\nby permitting it to retain much of the territory it had acquired in 1967. Grasping that\nSadat was willing to break with the other Arab states to secure peace with Israel,\nC1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1; Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 246\u201347,\n255\u201356.\n1484 Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 242\u201344, 264\u201367.\n1485 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 160. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 542\nKissinger correctly perceived that he could achieve both of these ends by brokering a\nseparate peace between Tel Aviv and Cairo. Such an agreement would end the\npossibility that Israel would have to fight a two-front war and would thus free it from\nneeding to make substantial concessions regarding the remaining Occupied Territories.\nMore importantly it would also shift Egypt from the Soviet camp to the American one\nand thus dramatically tip the superpower balance in the Middle East. Kissinger knew,\nhowever, that he could not openly pursue a bilateral agreement. A savvy diplomat, he\nunderstood all too well that Soviet and Arab pressure on Sadat would derail any open\neffort to secure a separate peace. He consequently opted for an incremental, \u201c\u2018step-by-\nstep\u2019\u201d diplomatic strategy\u2014one designed to disguise his pursuit of a narrowly bilateral\nagreement between Tel Aviv and Cairo.1486\nKissinger\u2019s efforts quickly bore fruit. As a result of his shuttle diplomacy, Israel\nand Egypt signed the Disengagement of Forces agreement, popularly known as Sinai I,\nin January 1974. It secured the withdrawal of IDF forces from the canal zone, severely\nlimited the number of soldiers that either side could station within thirty kilometers of the\nwaterway, and established a UN-controlled buffer area between Egyptian and Israeli\ntroops. It was a robust agreement\u2014one that involved meaningful concessions on Egypt\nand, especially, Israel\u2019s part. Indeed, it was significant enough to persuade the Arab oil\nstates to end the embargo on the sale of petroleum to the US.1487\nHe next turned his attention to Syria. A deal between Tel Aviv and Damascus\nthat resulted in Asad regaining all of the land Israel had taken in 1973 and a small part\nof the territory it had seized in 1967 was vital to his plan. By making it appear that he\nwas securing agreements between Israel and all the Arab states from which it had taken\nterritory, the secretary of state could provide Sadat with the diplomatic cover he needed\nto pursue a de facto separate peace. Persuading Asad to accept anything less than the\nreturn of the entire Golan Heights and overcoming Israeli doubts proved to be a serious\nchallenge, however. Indeed, it was only after Kissinger had shuttled multiple times over\na thirty-four-day period between Damascus and Tel Aviv that he was finally able to coax\nIsrael and Syria to come to terms. Signed in May 1974, the resulting separation of\nforces agreement achieved Kissinger\u2019s goals. It secured Israel\u2019s withdrawal from all of\nthe territory it had won in 1973 and, of great symbolic significance to Asad, required it to\nreturn the city of Quneitra that it had acquired in 1967.1488\nKissinger found the going much tougher after Israel and Syria signed this\nagreement, however. The problem was the Labor Alignment\u2019s weakened domestic\npolitical situation. Punished by the electorate for failing to detect Egypt and Syria\u2019s\nsurprise attack in 1973, the party no longer dominated Israeli politics as it had in the\npast. Not only did Labor Prime Minister Rabin confront a new rightist challenge in the\nform of the Likud Party\u2014which future Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon (r. 2001-2006) and\nMenachem Begin (r. 1977-1983) had created in 1973 by merging a number of small\n1486 Yaqub, 148\u201350.\n1487 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 327\u201329; Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 60.\n1488 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 158\u201362. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 543\nrightwing parties together\u2014but he also had to make concessions to Labor\u2019s traditional\npartner, the National Religious Party (NRP), which was deeply committed to retaining\ncontrol of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As a result, Rabin found himself so boxed\nin politically that he was unable to make the concessions that both Sadat and Kissinger\nsought. He did not get much sympathy from Gerald Ford (r. 1974-1976), who had\nbecome president when Nixon resigned in August 1974 as a result of the Watergate\nscandal. Furious about Tel Aviv\u2019s intransigence, he signaled his displeasure by calling\nfor a \u201c\u2018reassessment\u2019\u201d of America\u2019s relationship with Israel and by holding up an existing\narms agreement.1489\nThe threats appeared to work. Rabin\u2019s government soon indicated that it was\nwilling to compromise, though it also indicated that it expected the US to make\nconcessions to Israel in return. With Tel Aviv now demonstrating flexibility, Kissinger\nreturned to work and quickly secured a second disengagement accord between Israel\nand Egypt. Signed in September 1975, the Sinai Interim Agreement, commonly known\nas Sinai II, called for Israel to withdraw its forces in the Sinai east of the strategic Gidi\nand Mitla Passes. In exchange, Cairo pledged to allow ships traveling to Israeli ports to\ntransit the Suez Canal and promised not to use force against the Jewish state.1490\nNegotiated separately, the concessions that Rabin\u2019s government had demanded\nof Washington were far reaching. At Tel Aviv\u2019s insistence, the US agreed to provide\nIsrael with substantial ongoing economic and military aid, promised to refrain from\ntalking with or recognizing the PLO unless that organization first acknowledged Israel\u2019s\nright to exist, and pledged not to initiate any diplomatic initiatives in the region without\nprior consultation. These terms were enormously beneficial for Israel. It not only\nreceived a staggering $4 billion worth of American arms over the next three years\nalone\u2014twice the annual amount that the US had heretofore provided\u2014but could now\nrest assured that the US would not enter into negotiations with the PLO that might\ncompel it to cede territory to the Palestinians.1491\nFor Syria and, especially, the PLO, Sinai II and the promises Washington had\nmade to Tel Aviv were a disaster. By ending the possibility of a two-front war, the\nagreement freed Israel from having to make any further concessions to Syria regarding\nthe Golan heights. Meanwhile, by giving Israel what amounted to a near veto over\nAmerican policy toward the PLO, Washington\u2019s pledge not to talk to the Palestinians\nderailed Arafat\u2019s diplomatic offensive and prevented him from turning the organization\u2019s\ninternational success into tangible gains in the struggle to establish a Palestinian state.\nAbove all, the American concessions to Israel put the PLO in a cruel catch-22 situation\nthat echoed the \u201cIron Cage\u201d into which the British mandatory authorities had trapped the\nPalestinians in the 1920s. It could not talk with the US unless it first recognized Israel\u2019s\n1489 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 331\u201332; Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers,\n168\u201370.\n1490 Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 61.\n1491 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 342\u201346. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 544\nright to exist, but it simultaneously could not negotiate effectively with Israel if it yielded\nits only real diplomatic leverage\u2014recognition\u2014before discussions had even begun.1492\nIsrael\u2019s Rightward Turn\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s rightward tilt accelerated in the late 1970s. Already under\npressure from the NRP and Likud, the Labor government faced a new conservative\nchallenge in the form of a populist movement composed of young religious people\ncalled Gush Emunim, or Bloc of the Faithful, that was dedicated to the permanent\nretention of the Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and West Bank. Believing that God had\npromised the Occupied Territories to the Jewish people, the movement staged public\nprotests and built illegal settlements as part of a sustained campaign to compel the\ngovernment to annex the territories. The pressure on Rabin was enormous\u2014enough, in\nconjunction with the Labor Alignment\u2019s worsening electoral position, to compel his\ncabinet to bend to public opinion and approve a substantial number of new\nsettlements.1493\nDemographic changes also played an important part in shifting Israel to the right.\nThanks to their higher birthrates, the Mizrahim and Maghribian Jewish immigrants and\ntheir descendants had come to account for about half the country\u2019s population by the\nmid 1970s. Having endured discrimination, high unemployment rates, and the Labor\ngovernment\u2019s failure to provide them with adequate housing in the 1950s and 1960s,\nthey were angry with both the party and the Ashkenazi establishment. Expelled from\ntheir former homes in the Middle East and North Africa, they also had a special animus\nfor the Arab states and steadfastly opposed making concessions to them.1494\nThe new Likud Party was well position to take advantage of the demographic and\nideological changes that Israel was experiencing in the 1970s. Its pledge to take a hard\nline with the Arab states was sufficient to win for the party the overwhelming support of\nthe Maghribian and Mizrahim Jewish people. Meanwhile, Likud\u2019s declaration in its party\nplatform that \u201c[t]he right of the Jewish people to the land of Israel is eternal and\nindisputable\u201d was sufficient to secure it the backing of the settlement movement. The\nresulting electoral realignment proved decisive., Likud not only won a stunning electoral\nvictory in 1977, but, in the process, displaced the Labor Alignment as Israel\u2019s dominant\npolitical party.1495\nLikud\u2019s success did not bode well for the peace process. Committed to retaining\nthe Occupied Territories, the new prime minister, Menachem Begin, expressed little\ninterest in continuing the talks begun under his predecessors. As a result, the already\n1492 Quote from Khalidi, The Iron Cage, x, 156; Chamberlin, The Global Offensive, 254\u2013\n55.\n1493 Ari Shavit, My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel (New York:\nSpiegel and Grau, 2013), 204\u20136; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 336.\n1494 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 49\u201350.\n1495 Quote from Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 188\u201389. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 545\nfaltering negotiations between Egypt and Israel\u2014on which Sadat had staked so much\u2014\nunceremoniously ground to a halt.1496\nThe Infitah\nBegin\u2019s victory was far from the only problem that Sadat confronted in 1977.\nEven more troubling for him was the failure of his economic liberalization program.\nCalled, the Infitah, or opening, he had introduced it with great fanfare during the heady\ndays immediately following the Yom Kippur War. Designed to restore growth to the\nEgyptian economy by effecting a rapid transition from the sclerotic state-centered,\nNasserist system to a more-dynamic, profit-based, free-market one, it was far reaching\nin terms of both scope and depth. It included the relegalization of direct foreign\ninvestment, the reintegration of Egypt into the Western economic order, and the\nconcomitant abandonment of the Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) model of\ndevelopment that Nasser had championed. As such, it promised to thoroughly remake\nthe Egyptian economy and\u2014Sadat promised\u2014to dramatically raise living standards.1497\nThe Infitah succeeded in doing away with the worst excesses of Arab Socialism,\nbut it failed to produce the promised economic growth. Instead, it brought corruption,\ncrony capitalism, economic stagnation, and punishing inflation. The worst came in early\n1977. In January of that year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had compelled\nEgypt to severely reduce subsidies on common consumer goods including flour,\ncooking oil, and sugar in order to qualify for a desperately needed stabilization loan.\nComing on top of the recent inflation, the cutbacks hit peasants and working-class\nEgyptians with peculiar savagery. The result was civil insurrection. Bitter that Sadat\u2019s\neconomic liberalization program had not only failed to live up to its promise but had\nrendered them even poorer, lower-class Egyptian\u2019s rose up in a series of massive,\nspontaneous riots. Security forces managed to reestablish order in a few days\u2014killing\n150 people in the process\u2014and the state soon placated the lower classes by restoring\nthe subsidies on consumer goods; however, the incident had made emphatically clear\nthat popular enthusiasm for the Egyptian president had faded precipitously since the\nwar. For someone as politically attuned as Sadat, the lesson was clear: he needed a\nsubstantial political success if he wished to ensure his continued authority, and he\nneeded it soon.1498\nSadat\u2019s Breakthrough, November 1977\nSadat manufactured one in the fall of 1977 with a bold gesture that jump started\nthe faltering peace talks. As we have seen, the peace process had slowed after the\nsigning of the Sinai II Accord before grinding to a halt with the Likud victory in the spring\nof 1977. It began to pick up speed in the summer of that year thanks to the efforts of the\nnew American president, Jimmy Carter (r. 1977-1981). Committed to achieving a\n1496 Gelvin, 188\u201389.\n1497 Cook, The Struggle for Egypt, 137\u201338.\n1498 Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 201. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 546\ngenuine, comprehensive peace settlement, he moved quickly to breathe life into the\nfaltering peace process during his first year in office. However, his efforts quickly\nfoundered over the question of whether the Arab states would negotiate with Israel\nbilaterally, as Begin demanded, or as a unified delegation, as the Arabs insisted. As a\nresult, Carter\u2019s bid to restart the talks went nowhere, and the peace process remained\nmoribund.1499\nIt was at that point that Sadat made his move. Speaking before the Egyptian\nNational Assembly on November 9, he restated his commitment to a negotiated\nsettlement before declaring that he was \u201c\u2018prepared to go to the ends of the earth for\npeace, even to the Knesset [Israel\u2019s parliament].\u2019\u201d It was an audacious statement\u2014one\nthat not only tacitly recognized the Jewish state but also made clear that Sadat was\nwilling to break with longstanding Arab positions to achieve peace. Begin was receptive\nto Sadat\u2019s overture. He may have been unalterably opposed to yielding the Golan\nHeights, Gaza Strip, and West Bank, but he was willing to cede territory in the Sinai\nPeninsula if doing so would end hostility between Israel and its most dangerous\nneighbor. Accordingly, on November 20, just eleven days after he had made his\nelectrifying announcement, Sadat spoke before the Knesset at Begin\u2019s invitation. In his\naddress, he reiterated the Arabs\u2019 long-held position that any peace would have to be a\ncomprehensive one that accorded the Palestinians self-determination. At the same time,\nhowever, he also broke with longstanding Arab League policy by calling on the other\nArab governments to recognize Israel\u2019s right to enjoy peace and normalized\nrelations.1500\nIt was a bold move on Sadat\u2019s part\u2014one that would break the psychological\nimpasse and set the stage for productive bilateral negotiations. In the short run,\nhowever, it produced more smoke than fire. Indeed, when the two sides met for\nsubstantive discussions at Sadat\u2019s winter residence in Isma\u2019iliyya on\nDecember 25, 1977, the talks quickly deadlocked. Poor chemistry was part of the\nproblem; Begin and Sadat never managed to establish the personal rapport that can\noften see difficult negotiations through to a successful conclusion. More fundamentally,\nthe discussions failed to produce progress because the two sides were far apart on the\nobjectives that they sought. Cairo pursued two goals: a narrow Israeli-Egyptian\nagreement that would secure the return of the Sinai and a broader settlement that would\nachieve a just resolution of the Palestinian situation. Tel Aviv, in contrast, remained\nunwilling to discuss anything beyond a bilateral deal with Egypt.1501\nThe Ba\u2019athist States\nSadat\u2019s aggressive pursuit of peace with Israel and his effort to liberalize Egypt\u2019s\neconomy put him decidedly out of step with the radicalism that many Arab states and\nmovements had embraced following the Six Day War. This was particularly true with\n1499 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 50.\n1500 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 367\u201369; Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 252\u201354.\n1501 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 261; Rogan, The Arabs, 390\u201391. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 547\nregard to the Ba\u2019athist regimes in Syria and Iraq. Though they remained bitter rivals, the\ntwo states continued to pursue the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s radical agenda. They promoted a\ndramatic restructuring of society, sought to implement Arab-socialist economic policies,\nand worked to promote pan-Arabism\u2014albeit in a watered-down form. Ironically,\nhowever, neither regime maintained control as a result of its adherence to the Ba\u2019athist\nideology that had propelled them to power. Instead, in both states, the ruling party\u2019s\nposition ultimately rested on traditional structures such as patronage networks and the\nclan and religious ties that bound the ruling class together.\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s Iraq\nThe reliance on kinship networks proved especially critical in the Ba\u2019athist\nleaderships\u2019 gradual consolidation of power in Iraq in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nSharing control of the government with a group of army officers, the tiny Ba\u2019ath Party\ninitially had only a tenuous grip on the Iraqi state. However, under the duo of al-Bakr\nand his relative and second-in-command, Saddam Husayn (r. 1979-2003), it quickly\nsolidified its control of the government. The two men complemented each other well. A\nformer prime minister, President al-Bakr lent a veneer of legitimacy and stability to the\nregime. Ruthless and driven, meanwhile, Saddam Husayn did the dirty work needed to\nundermine rival power centers in the party. He proved peculiarly adept at this task.\nUsing a series of imaginary coup plots and conspiracies, he purged Western\nbusinesspeople, Nasserites, independent-minded Ba\u2019athists, and others perceived as\nthreats to his and al-Bakr\u2019s rule. He balanced that ruthlessness with political savvy.\nMost notably, at the same time that he was removing potential enemies, he was also\nmaking skillful use of patronage and traditional kinship relationships to put reliable\nmembers of his Tikrit-based al-Bu Nasir clan in key positions of power. This move\nproved critical in his and al-Bakr\u2019s effort to consolidate power. With their help, he was\nable to force out the few remaining military leaders from the inner circle in 1970\u2014thus\nsecuring the Ba\u2019ath Party\u2019s dominance of the government.1502\nAs his reliance on people from the al-Bu Nasir clan makes clear, Saddam\nHusayn had not institutionalized Ba\u2019athist rule out of deeply held convictions. Largely\nnon-ideological and uninterested in Ba\u2019athist beliefs, he instead strengthened the\nparty\u2014and his control of it\u2014because he saw it as a powerful instrument he could use to\nposition himself as al-Bakr\u2019s successor. He was successful in this effort. Deftly\nexploiting the patronage that his position as party secretary afforded him, he gradually\nassumed control of the party; by the mid 1970s, as a result, he had emerged as the\npower behind the throne.1503\nHe followed by moving to extend his control over the rest of the country. He first\nfocused on securing his complete dominance of the state\u2014a goal he achieved by\ninsinuating loyal Ba\u2019athists into key decision-making positions in the bureaucracy. With\nthe state now his to command, he next moved to assert control over the Iraqi people.\n1502 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 194\u201399.\n1503 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 148\u201352. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 548\nHe achieved this end by transforming the once-tiny Ba\u2019ath Party into a huge\norganization that extended its tentacles to the local level. Finally, to ferret out any\nchallenges to the regime before they could establish roots, he built up a vast,\ninterlocking web of competing security services loyal to him that kept watch on the Iraqi\npeople\u2014and each other. Periodic show trials, purges of unreliable people, and public\nexecutions further ensured compliance.1504\nIf the security services constituted the stick that Saddam Husayn used to control\nthe Iraqi people, then the patronage and social-welfare benefits derived from the\nrevenue Iraq earned on the sale of oil constituted the carrot. Having already won\npopular acclaim by nationalizing the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) in 1972, he took\nadvantage of the growth in oil revenues from $1 billion in 1973 to a staggering\n$26 billion in 1980 to expand social-welfare benefits and to develop a modern, Arab-\nsocialist economy. Economic development was unquestionably impressive. Under his\ndirection, the regime constructed desperately needed infrastructure such as electrical\ngeneration plants and highways and established collective farms and state-run industrial\nfacilities like iron works and petrochemical plants. Social reforms and welfare benefits\nwere equally remarkable. The regime expanded educational opportunities, provided free\nhealth care, and, in a move that delighted the country\u2019s rural population, paired the\nrevocation of the hated Law Governing the Rights and Duties of Cultivators with an\naggressive land-reform program. Extending to nearly every Iraqi, the substantial welfare\nbenefits that the state provided quickly succeeded in building popular support for the\nregime. As important, they drew the entire population into the patronage system that\nHusayn had constructed and thus rendered nearly all Iraqis beholden to the state,\nand\u2014by extension\u2014to Husayn himself.1505\nDespite the remarkable economic growth and the expansion of social-welfare\nbenefits, however, many Iraqis remained unhappy with Ba\u2019athist rule. Dissatisfaction\nwas particularly prominent among the country\u2019s Shi\u02bfi Arab minority. They disliked their\nsecond-class status, opposed the Ba\u2019athist promotion of secular rule, and resented the\nban on religious processions that the regime had imposed. They voiced their discontent\nby periodically rioting and by backing the cleric Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr\u2019s (1935-1980)\nal-Da\u02bfwa movement, which called for the establishment of a government based on Shi\u02bfi\nreligious principles. Still, the Shi\u02bfa were a manageable problem for Husayn\u2014one that\nhis government could address through a mix of rewards and threats.1506\nThe Kurds were a different matter. Having long sought greater autonomy, they\nhad viewed the Ba\u2019athist coup in 1968 as an opportunity to extract concessions from the\ngovernment. Accordingly, under Mustafa Barzani (1903-1979), the powerful head of the\nKurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and leader of the powerful peshmerga militia, the\nKurds issued a series of sweeping demands shortly after al-Bakr and Husayn took\npower. They included recognition of Kurdish as an official language, Kurdish control of a\n1504 Marr, 148\u201352.\n1505 Polk, Understanding Iraq, 124\u201328.\n1506 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 202\u20134. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 549\nshare of the revenue generated from the Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq, and, most\nimportantly, immediate autonomy. For a time, the regime was able to mollify the Kurds\nby indicating that it would meet their key demands. By 1974, however, it was no longer\nable to disguise the fact that it had no intention of ceding oil revenue or giving the Kurds\nany control over finances. In response, Barzani once again ordered the peshmerga to\nrise up in revolt. This time, the Kurds enjoyed foreign support. Seeking to pressure\nBaghdad into agreeing to move the border between Iran and Iraq from the Iranian shore\nof the strategic Shatt al-Arab Waterway to the thalweg\u2014the midpoint of its deepest\nchannel\u2014 Shah Muhammad Reza\u2019s (r. 1941-1979) government began to provide heavy\nweapons, supplies, and ammunition to Barzani\u2019s forces. The new arms proved decisive.\nWith them, the peshmerga fighters had little difficulty in defeating the Iraqi army and\nassuming control of most of the country\u2019s mountainous north. The Kurdish uprising was\nan embarrassing setback for Saddam Husayn\u2014one, he grasped, that threatened to\ndamage his political standing if he were unable to quickly bring it to heel.1507\nAccordingly, he moved with haste to find a way to end the insurgency.\nConcluding that the military could not defeat the Kurds so long as they were receiving\narms from Iran, he swallowed his pride and pursued a diplomatic settlement, the Algiers\nAgreement, with the shah. Signed in March 1975, it secured an Iranian promise to\nimmediately end its support of the Kurds in exchange for Iraq assenting to the border\nadjustment along the Shatt al-Arab Waterway that the shah had been seeking. While it\nwas an unpopular agreement in Iraq, it did tip the balance in the war with the Kurdish\ninsurgents in the regime\u2019s favor. Stripped of the supplies that had sustained their\ncampaign, the peshmerga were no longer able to stand up to the Iraqi army and quickly\nwent down to defeat. In the aftermath, the already faction-ridden Kurds split between\nthe KDP\u2014led by Barzani\u2019s sons after his death in 1979\u2014and a new, leftist party, the\nPatriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), headed by future Iraqi President Jalal Talabani\n(1933-2017). The Algiers Accord was thus a mixed bag for Saddam had certainly\ntarnished his reputation, but by making the victory over the Kurds possible, the\nagreement had also permitted him to restore his standing within the regime.1508\nAsad\u2019s Syria\nHafiz al-Asad\u2019s rule in Syria in the 1970s bore more than a superficial\nresemblance to Husayn\u2019s regime in contemporary Iraq. Like his counterpart and rival,\nAsad lacked a deep commitment to Ba\u2019athism and established control of the party and\nthe state far more in pursuit of his personal ambitions than in service to any larger\nideological agenda. Similarly, much as Saddam Husayn had done in Iraq, Asad\nmaintained his grip on power through traditional patronage arrangements and a reliance\non kinship networks\u2014in his case, among Syria\u2019s Alawite minority. Finally, Asad shared\nHusayn\u2019s reliance on internal security services to maintain order. Ruthless and corrupt,\n1507 Tripp, 199\u2013202, 211\u201314.\n1508 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 152\u201357. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 550\nthe Syrian mukhabarat used fear and intimidation to ensure loyalty and to find and\neradicate challenges to the regime.1509\nAsad did not secure acquiescence to his rule strictly through repression,\nhowever. As in Iraq, the regime also used patronage, economic development, and\nsocial welfare benefits to win the backing of the people. Here, he made effective use of\nBa\u2019athist ideology and its socialist economic program. He substantially expanded the\nstate-run component of the economy and strengthened its links with the traditional,\ncapitalist sector in order to increase the state\u2019s share of economic activity and to\ninsinuate the regime\u2019s patronage network deep into the private sphere\u2014a move that\ngave him the power to reward those loyal to him and to punish those who sought to\ndisobey his wishes. He also followed through with the Ba\u2019athist Party\u2019s promise to build\na significant amount of desperately needed modern infrastructure including the\nexpansion of Syria\u2019s network of railways and hard-surface roads and the construction of\nthe Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates River. Improving living standards, these projects\nsecured the support of many poor, rural Syrians. Finally, in keeping with Ba\u2019athism\u2019s\nemphasis on radical social change, he raised literacy rates and ended the landlord\nclass\u2019s tradition of lending money to peasants at usurious rates\u2014moves that won him\nthe backing of those most committed to the Ba\u2019athist call for an equitable society.1510\nUltimately, though, the economic development and social-welfare programs that\nAsad pursued in the 1970s were far-less successful than were Husayn\u2019s. The reason\nwas simple: oil, or, to be more precise, the lack thereof. Absent the enormous revenue\nthat Iraq enjoyed thanks to its vast petroleum production, Syria did not have the same\neasy access that Iraq did to the imported goods and capital equipment on which rapid\neconomic development depended. The results were predictable. Without the windfall\nthat oil revenue provided to Iraq, the Syrian economy could not overcome the\ncorruption, the extensive use of patronage for political purposes, and, especially, the\nsclerotic, crony-socialist development scheme that Asad had pursued. As a result, the\ncountry endured a grim combination of weak growth and high inflation over the course\nof the 1970s.1511\nIronically, relations between Syria and Iraq remained frosty following the Six Day\nWar despite both states having Ba\u2019athist governments. The rival regimes fought over\nwhich of them was the real leader of the Ba\u2019ath movement and worked to weaken each\nother through hostile propaganda. Here, too, Husayn enjoyed the upper hand. The\ngradual flow of prominent Syrian Ba\u2019athists into exile in Iraq after Asad took power\nboosted his claims to leadership in the movement, particularly after one of the party\u2019s\nfounders, Michele Aflaq (1910-1989), fled to Baghdad in 1970. In addition, Damascus\u2019s\nwillingness to sign the disengagement accord with Tel Aviv bolstered Iraq\u2019s claim that it\nwas the more militantly anti-Israel Ba\u2019athist state. Finally, Husayn scored points with\nBa\u2019athists throughout the Middle East at Asad\u2019s expense by criticizing Syria\u2019s\n1509 McHugo, Syria, 183\u201385, 188\u201389.\n1510 McHugo, 183\u201387, 195.\n1511 McHugo, 183\u201387. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 551\nintervention on the conservative side in the Lebanese civil war in 1975\u2014an action, the\nIraqi president argued, that made clear that the Syrian president lacked a sincere\ncommitment to Ba\u2019athist ideology.1512\nThe Lebanese Civil War\nDespite coming dangerously close on a few occasions, Lebanon had largely\nmanaged to avoid the instability that had gripped nearby Arab states such as Iraq and\nSyria after 1948. That situation changed following the Six Day War. Thereafter, it could\nno longer insulate itself from either the effects of the Arab-Israeli conflict or the radical\nideologies then coursing through the Arab states. As a result, Lebanon descended into\na brutal civil war in 1975 that would last, with times of tense peace, until 1990.\nTwo issues set the stage for the conflict. First, the National Pact\u2019s division of\npolitical power along confessional lines\u2014recall that it had allocated seats in the\nparliament according to the 1932 census\u2014had begun to produce growing frustration\namong non-Christian Lebanese who increasingly chafed under Maronite dominance.\nThe disparity in political power was bad enough; what was worse was the Maronites\u2019\nsteadfast unwillingness to conduct a new census that might alter the political balance\u2014\ndespite the fact that divergent birth rates had long since resulted in the country having a\nmajority Muslim population.1513\nInfluenced by the radical political ideas then sweeping through the Arab World,\nthe leftist Druze leader Kamal Jumblatt (1917-1977) responded to continued Maronite\nintransigence by founding the leftist Lebanese National Movement (LNM) in the early\n1970s. It demanded the replacement of the National Pact that had governed the country\nsince 1943 with a new political structure based on majority rule, and it quickly gained a\nwide following among Shi\u02bfa, Druze, and even some Christians. Unsurprisingly,\nJumblatt\u2019s campaign and the enthusiastic response it received worried the country\u2019s\nestablishment. Concerned that they would lose power under his proposal, most\nMaronite politicians\u2014and even some Sunni leaders\u2014started to organize against the\nLNM. Ominously, as part of this effort, they began to form religiously defined militias.1514\nSecond, the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians had begun to spill over\ninto Lebanon with disastrous consequences for the country\u2019s internal cohesion. The\npresence of 350,000 dispossessed Palestinians had already weakened the bonds that\nheld the country together even before the PLO relocated to Lebanon in 1971 and\nstarted using it as a base from which to attack Israel. Thereafter, fedayeen raids and\ncross-border shelling invited destabilizing IDF reprisals, while Arafat\u2019s establishment of\na state-within-a-state in Lebanon deepened the country\u2019s division. The results were\nstark. No longer able to contain either the conflict over the internal distribution of political\n1512 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 209\u201310.\n1513 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 210\u201311.\n1514 Rogan, The Arabs, 381. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 552\npower or the destabilizing impact of the PLO\u2019s presence, Lebanon in the mid 1970s had\nbecome a tinderbox ready to go up in flames.1515\nIt finally ignited in early 1975. That March, a bloody government crackdown on a\nMuslim protest over fishing rights led to a series of skirmishes in Sidon between the\nLebanese army and leftists militias. The violence gradually spread until, on April 13, the\npowerful Phalange militia killed twenty-eight Palestinians on a bus in retaliation for a\nfailed assassination attempt on Pierre Gemayel (1905-1984), the leader of the far-right\nMaronite Phalange Party. By then, Lebanon had reached the point of no return. The\ncountry thereafter steadily fractured along confessional lines\u2014devolving into a complex\ncivil war marked by sporadic firefights, brutal massacres, savage bombardments, and\nvicious terrorist attacks.1516\nInevitably, the fighting drew the PLO into the civil war. While the organization had\ntried to carefully navigate Lebanon\u2019s internal conflict up to that point, rightist attacks on\nPalestinian refugee camps in the winter of 1975-1976 finally compelled Arafat to join the\nconflict on the side of the LNM. Coupled with the sudden dissolution of the army in\nMarch 1976, the entry of the PLO into the civil war tipped the balance decisively in favor\nof the leftists. Indeed, by the spring of that year, the PLO and the LNM stood on the\ncusp of a decisive victory.1517\nIt was at that point that Hafiz al-Asad intervened in the civil war. Ironically, he did\nnot do so to help his ideological allies in the LNP and PLO, whose commitment to Arab\nnationalism and radicalism he ostensibly shared. Instead, fearing that a leftist victory\nwould draw Israel into Lebanon\u2014with disastrous consequences for Syria in terms of\nboth prestige and strategic position\u2014he opted to promote a negotiated settlement\nknown as the Constitutional Document. It proposed the retention of the confessional\nsystem albeit with a slight increase in Muslim political representation, and it called for\nthe Lebanese government to exercise limited authority over the heretofore autonomous\nPalestinian refugee camps. Unsurprisingly, while the Maronites were enthusiastic about\nAsad\u2019s plan, neither Jumblatt nor Arafat agreed to its terms. On the contrary, close to\ndefeating their enemies, they rejected the Constitutional Document in favor of a final\noffensive designed to secure a total victory over the Maronites. Furious that his\nideological allies would not follow his lead. In response, Asad deployed a substantial\nmilitary force into Lebanon with instructions to rescue the Maronites from defeat and to\nrestore order to the war-torn country.1518\nMaking allies out of longtime rivals and enemies out of previous friends, Asad\u2019s\ninvasion thoroughly scrambled the region\u2019s fault lines. Not only was radical Syria\nsupporting conservative forces in Lebanon, but, more remarkably, Tel Aviv and\n1515 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 355\u201357; Hourani, A History of the\nArab Peoples, 430.\n1516 Rogan, The Arabs, 381\u201383.\n1517 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 355\u201357.\n1518 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 222\u201326. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 553\nDamascus found themselves in the odd position of backing the same faction. The two\nsworn enemies even came to a modus vivendi in which Israel accepted Asad\u2019s military\ndeployment based on the assumption that the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon\nwould curtail PLO attacks. While Tel Aviv was happy to have the Syrian army impose\norder in northern and central Lebanon, however, it had no intention of permitting Asad\nto deploy troops to the south. Instead, the Israelis moved to control that area with a\nproxy force called the South Lebanese Army (SLA). Unsurprisingly, the marriage of\nconvenience between Israel and Syria left many seasoned observers bemused. As one\nlongtime American veteran of Middle Eastern diplomacy succinctly declared, \u201c\u2018[i]t\u2019s\nweird. It\u2019s truly weird.\u2019\u201d It may have been strange, but it also managed to bring to a\nconclusion the first phase of the Lebanese Civil War\u2014a conflict that had already\nclaimed more than 30,000 lives.1519\nThe Rise of Islamism\nAs the popularity of the LNP\u2019s progressive agenda made clear in the run up to\nthe civil war, radical pan-Arabism continued to define the Arab world in the decade\nfollowing the Six Day War. Arab nationalism retained its position as the prevailing\npolitical ideology, Arab socialism continued to dominate economic thinking, and radical\nideas and imagery remained commonplace. Leading states and organizations reflected\nthe continued dominance of radical pan-Arabism. The PLO was not merely staunchly\nsecular, for instance, but deliberately used the iconography of the upraised AK-47\nassault rifle as a way of symbolizing its connection to similar far-left revolutionary\nmovements across the globe. Likewise, despite Husayn and Asad\u2019s personal lack of\nideological conviction, Ba\u2019athist propaganda continued to stress radical themes of social\nequality and pan-Arab unity.\nAs powerful as it may have been immediately following the Six Day War,\nhowever, the dominance of radical Arab nationalism proved to be remarkably short\nlived. At the very moment of its ascendency in the 1970s, a dramatically different\nideological vision, Islamism, was quietly reemerging in the Arab world. With roots\nstretching back to Hassan al-Banna (1906-1949) and to the Saudi al-ikhwan, it held that\nthe problems of the Muslim world stemmed not from its technological or scientific\ninferiority to the West, but instead from the fact that Muslims had adopted secular\ngovernments that\u2014in direct contravention of longstanding Islamic practice\u2014separated\nreligion and state. Fortunately, the Islamists argued, there was a straightforward\nsolution. By replacing its Western-style governments with Islamic ones that enforced\nshari\u02bfa law, the Muslim world would again enjoy God\u2019s grace and thus once more\nassume its rightful place as the globe\u2019s dominant civilization.1520\n1519 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 133; Quote from Yaqub, Imperfect\nStrangers, 124\u201329, 232\u201335.\n1520 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 28. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 554\nModerate Islamism\nMost Islamists adhered to a moderate version of the ideology. First taking root in\nthe 1970s among younger, educated Egyptians, moderate Islamism emphasized social\njustice and called for Muslims to abandon Western consumerism and social mores in\nfavor of a return to traditional Islamist values and practices. The movement had its first\ntangible success in Egypt\u2019s universities. Over the course of the decade, Islamist\nstudents wrested control of the politically important student unions from Nasserists and\ndemanded\u2014with some success\u2014that the country restructure higher education along\nIslamic lines through curricular changes and the adoption of gender-segregated\nclassrooms. Later, many joined the Muslim Brotherhood, which, having sworn off\nviolence, grew rapidly after Sadat released its members from prison.1521\nSayyid Qutb and the Emergence of Extreme Islamism\nWhile most Islamists were moderates who hoped to persuade people to adopt\ntheir views, a small subset known as jihadis instead sought to effect change through\nviolence. They drew inspiration from the works of Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966), the\nEgyptian intellectual whose writings constituted the ideological foundation of the\nmovement. Though always a religious man, he came to embrace Islamist ideas as a\nresult of an extended trip he took to the United States in the late 1940s to study\neducational administration. Shocked by American materialism and by what he perceived\nto be the country\u2019s spiritual emptiness, he concluded that only Islamic laws and values\ncould serve as the foundation for a just society. Accordingly, shortly after returning to\nEgypt in 1950, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood. Respected as an intellectual, he soon\nbecame the movement\u2019s ideological guide\u2014a role he would retain even after his death\nin 1966.1522\nDespite his rapid rise in the organization, Qutb\u2019s time in the Muslim Brotherhood\nwas anything but easy. Arrested in the roundup that followed the failed assassination\nattempt on Nasser in 1954, he languished in prison until the Egyptian president\u2014having\nassumed incorrectly that the organization had been completely dismantled\u2014amnestied\nQutb and his associates in 1964. The movement\u2019s shockingly quick revival soon led\nNasser to conclude that his decision to release the brothers had been a dangerous\nmistake. Accordingly, he soon had Qutb and the rest of the organization\u2019s leadership\nrearrested and tried for treason. Qutb\u2019s trial was more an exercise in government public\nrelations than a legitimate judicial proceeding. Using torture to extract incriminating\ntestimony from his associates, the prosecution secured a pro forma guilty verdict in July\n1966. The following month, the regime had him executed.1523\n1521 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 321\u201324.\n1522 Esposito, Islam, 237\u201338.\n1523 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 138\u201339; Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda\nand the Road to 9/11, 17\u201328. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 555\nIf Nasser had hoped that death would end Qutb\u2019s influence, he was sadly\nmistaken. On the contrary, thanks to the books he had written while in prison, Qutb\nwould enjoy a vastly greater influence in death than he ever had in life. By far the most\nimportant of those works was a slim volume called Milestones that he had written\nspecifically for the most committed jihadis. Composed in small snippets that his\nassociates smuggled out of jail, it reflected the radicalization he had experienced while\nconfined to Nasser\u2019s brutal prison system. He argued in the book that the secular,\nmaterialistic states that predominated in the Muslim world were based on human-\nderived ideas rather than on God\u2019s laws; as such, they had produced not progress or\nenlightenment but only ignorance or jahiliyya\u2014the same term Muhammad had used to\ndescribe pre-Islamic Arabia. To free themselves from jahiliyya, true Muslims needed to\nbring about governments that were rooted in the divinely provided shari\u02bfa code. But how\nwere they to do so? That is, how could they replace the existing jahili regimes with\nIslamist ones?1524\nIt was in answering this question that Qutb provided the justification for terrorism\nand an Islamic revolution. Drawing on the ideas of the fourteenth-century legal scholar\nibn Taymiyyah (1263-1328), he argued that rulers who had failed to establish shari\u02bfa\nlaw in their states were kafirs, or apostates, and thus subject to takfir\u2014\nexcommunication\u2014and death. As such, the Islamist vanguard was not merely justified\nin using \u201c\u2018physical power and jihad for abolishing the organizations and authorities of the\njahili system\u2019\u201d but in fact enjoined to do so. In other words, he maintained that violence,\neven against rulers and others who claimed to be Muslims, was an appropriate tool that\nthe vanguard would need to use to return society to the justice and peace that he\nbelieved were inherent to a shari\u02bfa-based state.1525\nMilestones had an enormous influence on subsequent generations of jihadis. Its\ncall for a dedicated vanguard to lead a revolution aimed at replacing the existing secular\nArab states with new, shari\u02bfa-based Islamic ones captivated a growing number of\nyounger Muslims and resulted in the emergence of new, underground militant\norganizations in the 1970s. As important, his promotion of jihad and call for takfir\nensured that those groups would make violence a central component of their\nrevolutionary effort.1526\nQutb\u2019s vanguard began to take shape in Egypt in the 1970s. In a hint of things to\ncome, a jihadi group called the Youth of Muhammad tried unsuccessfully to storm the\narmory at the Military Technical College in Cairo in 1974 in a failed effort to seize\nweapons with which it planned to overthrow the government. While the organization\ncollapsed following the execution of its leader, other jihadi groups soon emerged to\nreplace it. By the middle of the decade, for example, the cells that would later combine\nto form Jamaat al-Jihad, or Egyptian Islamic Jihad, had taken shape\u2014including one led\n1524 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 34.\n1525 Quote from Rogan, The Arabs, 401\u20132; Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and\nthe Road to 9/11, 34.\n1526 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 35.

Likewise, a second organization, Gamaat Islamiya, or the Islamic\nGroup, grew rapidly in the mid-to-late 1970s\u2014particularly among university students.1527\nQutb-inspired groups did not remain confined to Egypt. Instead, influenced by\nMilestones, jihadi organizations began to quietly take shape throughout the Arab world\nover the course of the 1970s\u2014most notably in Syria. There, the heretofore peaceful\nSyrian Muslim Brotherhood began to organize against the Alawite-dominated Ba\u2019ath\nParty and its secular agenda. The Syrian jihadis first made their presence known in\n1973 when they led demonstrations in Hama to express their opposition to the regime\u2019s\npromulgation of a new constitution that did not require the president to be a Muslim.\nLater, in 1976, they used violence for the first time when they responded to Asad\u2019s\nintervention on the Maronite side in the Lebanese Civil War with a campaign of terror\nbombings that ended only after a sharp government crackdown.1528\nHistorical Disagreements: Islamism and the Six Day War\nSince the Iranian Revolution in 1979, historians and other observers have drawn\na direct connection between the emergence of Islamism in the 1970s and the Arab\ndefeat in the Six Day War in 1967. According to the standard account, Israel\u2019s triumph\nover the secular Arab states had so totally discredited those regimes that it produced a\nsudden, populist ideological sea change in the Middle East in which the masses rapidly\nabandoned radical Arab nationalism in favor of Islamism. Gaining broad currency after\n1979, this interpretation remains to the present day the conventional wisdom regarding\nthe growth of Islamism. Emblematic of its continued dominance are the views of the\njournalist Lawrence Wright, who argues in his Pulitzer Prize-winning study of al-Qaeda\nthat \u201cthe appeal of Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt and elsewhere was born in [the]\nshocking debacle\u201d of 1967.1529\nIn recent years, however, the scholar Fawaz Gerges has persuasively\nchallenged this interpretation. He raises two important objections. First, he contends\nthat contemporary Islamism did not originate as a populist movement but was instead a\ntop-down phenomenon that benefited from substantial active state assistance. Sadat\nwas the key figure here. Seeking support against the Nasserists who continued to\ndominate the government during the early part of his tenure, the Egyptian leader\npresented himself as a great champion of Islam and its values. Referring to himself as\n\u201c\u2018the believer president,\u2019\u201d he altered the constitution in 1971 to assert that \u201c\u2018the\nprinciples of Shari\u2019a are the main sources of legislation.\u2019\u201d More importantly, he provided\ndirect state assistance to Egypt\u2019s Islamist groups. Most notably, he freed those\n1527 Wright, 48\u201350, 141\u201342; Goldschmidt, A Brief History of Egypt, 208.\n1528 McHugo, Syria, 191; Rogan, The Arabs, 405\u20136.\n1529 Quote from Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 45; Fawaz\nA.

William Roger Louis and\nAvi Shlaim (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), 287, 312\u201313. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 557\nmembers of the Muslim Brotherhood who remained in prison and supplied arms to\nGamaat Islamiya in support of its effort to displace the Nasserists in the influential\nstudent unions. Sadat was not alone in nurturing Islamism. The government of Saudi\nArabia, with which the Egyptian president had become close, also began to back the\nIslamists in the 1970s\u2014most notably by providing huge amounts of petrodollars to\nfinance the spread of Wahhabi religious ideas throughout the Muslim world. Thus,\nGerges concludes, Islamism was not a bottom-up phenomenon, but instead a top-down\none that depended heavily during its early years on state support.1530\nSecond and more importantly, he takes issue with the idea that Islamism swiftly\ngained in popularity at radical Arab nationalism\u2019s expense in the wake of the Six Day\nWar. In his view, the conventional interpretation has it backwards. That is, rather than\nlosing popularity, Arab nationalism instead gained in influence in the decade following\nthe war even as Islamism remained little more than a fringe movement. As he notes, all\nof the regime changes that occurred in the Arab world in the aftermath of the conflict put\nArab-nationalists rather than Islamists in power. Likewise, the splinter groups that rose\nto prominence in the PLO after the Six Day War were secular adherents of Marxism and\nnot disciples of Qutb. Even Egypt\u2014the home of the Muslim Brotherhood\u2014was not\nimmune to the shift to radical Arab nationalism. When members of the state-affiliated\nOrganization for Socialist Youth found themselves disillusioned with Nasser following\nthe war, for example, they did not abandon Nasserism for Islamism; instead, they\nembraced Marxism. Thus, as Gerges demonstrates, Islamism remained an\nunderground movement during the 1970s while radical pan-Arabism retained its position\nas the dominant ideology in the Arab world.1531\n1979\nIndeed, Islamism would only be in a position to begin flexing its muscles during\nanother of the twentieth-century Middle East\u2019s watershed years: 1979. It was a long and\nenormously consequential year for the region. Bracketed by the shah\u2019s departure from\nIran\u2014discussed in chapter fifteen\u2014and the Soviet Union\u2019s invasion of Afghanistan, the\nevents of those fateful twelve months would reflect the trends, movements, and conflicts\nof the post-1967 Middle East and would, collectively, restructure the region socially,\npolitically, and diplomatically.\nThe Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty\nThe signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty in March 1979 certainly\nreshaped the Arab-Israeli conflict. That Sadat and Begin were able to find common\nground at that time was remarkable in light of the fraught state of bilateral talks in the\nearly summer of 1978. As we have seen, the two sides had been unable to build on the\ndisengagement agreements and Sadat\u2019s dramatic speech before the Knesset. Instead,\nthe subsequent negotiations had revealed that Sadat and Begin held sharply divergent\n1530 Gerges, Making the Arab World, 314\u201342.\n1531 Gerges, 284\u2013313. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 558\npositions on key issues such as the disposition of the Occupied Territories. As a result,\nby the summer of 1978, the talks were at an impasse.1532\nIt was at that point that President Carter stepped in. Summoning the two leaders\nto the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland in September 1978, he oversaw\nthirteen days of difficult negotiations in an effort to bring the two sides together so that\nthey could conclude an agreement. The differences between them were significant.\nSadat offered Israel full recognition and peace in exchange for the return of the Sinai\nPeninsula but insisted that the agreement also include a general statement of principle\nthat bound Israel both to return all the land it had taken in 1967 and to recognize the\nPalestinians\u2019 right to self-determination. Begin countered by expressing his willingness\nto return much of the Sinai in exchange for peace with Egypt; however, he adamantly\nrefused to discuss yielding the West Bank and Gaza Strip or to consider giving the\nPalestinians any more than limited, local autonomy under Israeli rule.1533\nCarter eventually arrived at a way of bridging the differences that was acceptable\nto both sides. Aware that the main stumbling block was the status of the West Bank and\nThe Gaza Strip, the president devised an agreement regarding those territories that was\nsufficiently vague that each party could accept it. He also secured an oral commitment\nfrom Begin to impose a moratorium on the construction of settlements for five years.\nThanks to this approach, the negotiations were able to produce two unlinked, interim\nagreements collectively known as the Camp David Accords. The first, \u201cA Framework for\nPeace in the Middle East,\u201d called for the establishment of a Palestinian \u201c\u2018self-governing\nauthority\u2019\u201d in the West Bank and Gaza Strip followed by a five-year \u201c\u2018transitional period\u2019\u201d\nthat would conclude with \u201cfinal status\u201d negotiations. The second, \u201cA Framework for the\nConclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel,\u201d outlined a bilateral agreement\nbased on Resolution 242\u2019s call for an exchange of land for peace and recognition.\nSadat and Begin signed the accords on September 17, 1978.1534\nAfter further negotiations to refine the Camp David Accords, the two leaders\nsigned the formal Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty on the White House lawn on March\n26, 1979. The agreement committed Egypt to end the state of war that existed between\nit and Israel, to establish full, normalized relations with Tel Aviv, to acknowledge the\nright of Israeli ships to freely transit the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran, and to\naccept the stationing of a permanent UN peacekeeping force on its side of the two\ncountries\u2019 common border. In exchange, Israel promised to complete a staged\nwithdrawal from the Sinai.1535\n1532 Yaqub, Imperfect Strangers, 261.\n1533 David W.

Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 559\nDespite intense criticism in the Arab world, the treaty\u2019s provisions regarding the\nSinai went into effect as scheduled. The two countries established normalized relations\nin 1980, and Tel Aviv gradually withdrew its forces from the Sinai culminating in the\nevacuation of the remaining Israeli-controlled territory in 1982. Thanks to Israeli\nstonewalling, however, the unlinked \u201cFramework for Peace in the Middle East\u201d that\naccompanied the bilateral agreement went nowhere. As early as the fall of 1978, Begin\nhad indicated that he interpreted the agreement in the loosest possible terms and that\nhe did not view its provisions as binding on his country. He went even further after\nsigning the formal peace treaty. He bluntly refused to recognize that the Palestinians\nenjoyed any collective rights as a people and claimed that he had agreed at Camp\nDavid merely to grant autonomy to individual Palestinians\u2014a position that rendered the\npossibility of negotiations with the PLO dead on arrival. Begin also embarrassed Carter\nby pausing the construction of settlements for a bare three months rather than the five\nyears he had promised, and he demonstrated his determination to establish permanent\ncontrol of the territories by expropriating private Palestinian land on the West Bank.\nIndeed, the prime minister could not have made his position on the territories any\nclearer. He had no intention of yielding them or of permitting the creation of a\nPalestinian state, and\u2014having secured the separate peace with Egypt that he had\nsought all along\u2014he faced no pressure whatsoever to do so.1536\nPeace between Israel and Egypt had three enormous consequences. First, in the\nshort run at least, the normalization of relations made Cairo a pariah in the Arab world.\nThe Arab states immediately broke diplomatic relations with Egypt, imposed an\neconomic boycott on it, and expelled it from the Arab League. Second, the peace\nagreement permanently tipped the balance in the Arab-Israeli conflict in Tel Aviv\u2019s favor.\nBy removing the most powerful Arab state from the equation, it restored Israel to a\nposition of unquestioned military preponderance and ensured that it would take part in\nany future negotiations from a position of overwhelming strength. Third, the new\nrelationship between Cairo and Tel Aviv marked the point at which the Arab-Israeli\nconflict completed the transformation from a state-to-state contest back into a struggle\nbetween Palestinian and Israeli nationalisms that had begun with the Six Day War.\nThus, just as critics had predicted, peace between Israel and Egypt gave Tel Aviv the\nfree hand it had sought in its relations with the other Arab states and the Palestinians\u2014\na situation, as we shall see in chapter seventeen, that all-but guaranteed that Tel Aviv\nwould take aggressive actions following the agreement\u2019s full implementation.1537\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s Coup\nMeanwhile, just a few months after the signing of the peace treaty, Saddam\nHusayn would formally assume control of Iraq. As we have seen, his rise to the top had\nbeen a long time coming. Nominally al-Bakr\u2019s subordinate, he had long since\nestablished himself not only as the regime\u2019s strongman but as Iraq\u2019s de facto ruler. By\n1979, however, he was no longer content to rule from behind the throne. Accordingly, in\n1536 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 371\u201372, 382\u201393.\n1537 Lesch, 1979, 82\u201393. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 560\nJuly, he mounted a bloodless coup that began with al-Bakr resigning and that ended\nwith the Ba\u2019ath Party naming Husayn as his successor.1538\nNot content merely to assume the top post, the new president followed with a\nseries of bold and brutal actions designed to permanently eliminate any independent\npower bases in the Ba\u2019ath Party that could conceivably threaten his authority. He\ninitiated this campaign at a carefully orchestrated, televised party meeting held on\nJuly 22. Addressing the assembled leaders, he announced the discovery of a plot\nagainst the state organized by top-ranking Ba\u2019athists who, he claimed, were in league\nwith Syria; chillingly, he had the alleged conspirators, many of whom were in\nattendance, immediately arrested on trumped up charges. In the dubious judicial\nproceedings that followed, he arranged for twenty-two of them to be condemned to\ndeath and for thirty-three others to be sentenced to long prison terms. He followed by\nordering the execution of another five-hundred high-ranking Ba\u2019athists whose loyalty he\ndoubted. Brutally effective, Husayn\u2019s coup seamlessly transformed Iraq from a one-\nparty state into a personal autocracy\u2014one that no longer rested on a shared ideological\nvision but instead on clan ties, patronage, and, above all, personal loyalty to Saddam\nHusayn.1539\nHis seizure of power would have a decisive effect on the Middle East over the\nnext twenty-five years. No longer bound by any internal checks or challenges, he was\nfree to follow an aggressive foreign policy designed to achieve his dream of turning Iraq\ninto the dominant power in the region and himself into its leading political figure.\nUltimately, as we shall see in the next two chapters, Husayn was unable to realize his\naspirations. Rather than making Iraq the region\u2019s leading state, his aggressive approach\nto foreign relations would produce a series of disastrous conflicts that beggared his\ncountry, destabilized the Middle East, and drew the ire of the US.\nThe Islamist Onslaught\nMeanwhile, the Sunni Islamist vanguard that Qutb had hoped to inspire\nannounced its emergence in 1979 with a pair of spectacular terrorist attacks. The first\noccurred in Syria. Supported by wealthy families angry about the regime\u2019s program of\nland reform, the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood launched a bold assault on a military\nacademy in Aleppo that resulted in the deaths of eighty-three Alawite cadets. The\nincident was the opening salvo in what would be a peculiarly savage war between the\nbrothers and the government\u2014one that would produce steadily rising casualties over\nthe next few years. Occurring in Saudi Arabia, the second incident was far-more\nshocking. That November, more than four-hundred militant followers of Juhayman al-\nOtaybi (1936-1980), stunned the Muslim world by seizing control of the Grand Mosque\nin Mecca and demanding the replacement of the Saudi regime with an Islamist state. It\ntook two weeks of brutal fighting for the government to finally regain control of the\n1538 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 222.\n1539 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 60; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 178\u201381.

Officially, 127 soldiers, a dozen hostages, and 117 jihadis died in the fighting;\nhowever, unofficial estimates put the death toll at more than 4,000.1540\nThe spectacular emergence of Sunni Islamism in 1979 helped to spread jihadi\nthought throughout the Middle East. Indeed, in conjunction with the Iranian Revolution, it\nwas the attacks in Syria and, especially, Saudi Arabia, that gave the jihadi groups the\nlegitimacy needed to rapidly win new recruits to the cause of overthrowing the secular\njahili regimes. As we shall see, those organizations would ultimately be unsuccessful in\ntheir attempts to establish Islamic governments in the Arab countries; nonetheless, their\nactivities\u2014and, especially, the efforts of states like Saudi Arabia to divert their zeal\noutward\u2014would powerfully shape the region\u2019s development in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan\nThe final event that shook the region in 1979 occurred just before the end of the\nyear. In December, the USSR invaded Afghanistan in an effort to prop up the\ngovernment of an important satellite state that was attempting to put down a Sunni\ninsurgency. While Moscow committed 80,000 well-equipped soldiers to assist the\nAfghan government, it soon found itself bogged down in a costly quagmire with the\nmujahidin, the Sunni guerrillas who operated in the country\u2019s vast hinterlands. Almost\nfrom the start, the mujahidin benefited from substantial amounts of miliary aid from the\nUS and Saudi governments. Somewhat later, they also began to receive funds and\nrecruits from newly formed transnational jihadi groups operating in the Arab states.1541\nWhile it occurred just outside of the boundaries of the Middle East, the invasion\nof Afghanistan was yet another event in 1979 that would have enormous consequences\nfor the region. Two stand out. First, the invasion dramatically boosted the position and\norganizational capacity of the jihadi groups. While the militarily inexperienced Arabs\nthey sent to Afghanistan had almost no impact on the course of the war, the process of\nrecruiting, training, and supporting fighters gave the movement invaluable experience\nas well as the opportunity to expose sympathetic people to their ideas. Second, the\nSoviet invasion created fears in Washington that the move was the first step in a plan to\nseize the region\u2019s oil fields. It thus led President Carter to enunciate the Carter Doctrine\nin January 1980. Committing the US to defend the Persian Gulf from Soviet attack, this\ncritical statement of policy would set the stage for deeper American involvement in the\nregion in the 1980s and 1990s.1542\n1540 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 101\u20139; Rogan, The\nArabs, 405\u20137.\n1541 Lesch, 1979, 52\u201354, 101\u20132.\n1542 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 121\u201323, 127\u201329;\nHerring, From Colony to Superpower, 854\u201355. Chapter Sixteen: The Middle East After Nasser, 1967-1979 Page 562\nConclusion\nThe period from 1967 to 1979 was an enormously transformational one for the\nMiddle East. Like the Ernest Hemingway character\u2019s description of his fall into\nbankruptcy, the change that the region experienced during this time happened\n\u201c\u2018gradually and then suddenly,\u2019\u201d with 1979 marking the pivotal before-and-after moment.\nThe momentous events of that year\u2014above all, the Iranian Revolution\u2014would,\ncollectively, establish a new set of fault lines, conflicts, and issues that would shape the\nregion\u2019s history in ensuing decades. Indeed, as the historian David Lesch succinctly\nnotes, \u201c1979 constituted a major watershed, if not the major watershed, in modern\nMiddle Eastern history.\u201d It is to this new, and very different Middle East that we will now\nturn.1543\n1543 Hemingway quote from Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises (New York: Charles\nScribner and Sons, 1926), 136; Lesch quote from Lesch, 1979, 2. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990\nIntroduction\nNineteen seventy-nine came as a profound shock to the people of the Middle\nEast. The transformative events of that pivotal year\u2014the Iranian Revolution, the Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan, Saddam Husayn\u2019s (r. 1979-2003) consolidation of power, the\nsudden emergence of jihadi groups, and the signing of the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty\u2014\nshook the region to its very foundations and led many observers to predict new and\ntrying times ahead. They were not wrong. During the next decade, the Middle East\nexperienced a brutal, eight-year-long war between Islamic Iran and Ba\u02bfthist Iraq, a wave\nof Islamist insurgencies, an Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and a popular uprising in the\nWest Bank and Gaza Strip. It was, in sum, a critical decade\u2014one of important\ntransitions and bitter stalemates.\nThe Islamist Challenge\nIn many ways, the most fundamental change that occurred in the region after\n1979 was the rapid growth of Islamism. As we saw in chapter sixteen, Islamism had\nemerged in the 1970s thanks to the support of the Saudi government and, especially,\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat (r. 1970-1981). By the early 1980s, however, it had\ntransformed into a decidedly grassroots movement\u2014one that was neither beholden to\nnor controlled by its former patrons. Indeed, by that point, it had grown so strong that it\nhad not only begun to supplant Arab nationalism as the most powerful insurgent\nideology in the Middle East but had also\u2014in both its mainstream and jihadi variants\u2014\nbecome the primary challenge to pan-Arabist and conservative regimes alike.\nArab Presidents for Life\nThat Islamism had displaced secular Arab-nationalism as the primary\nrevolutionary ideology in the Middle East is hardly surprising in light of the changes that\nhad gradually occurred in the pan-Arabist states since the Six Day War. By the early\n1980s, regimes such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq that had once promoted sweeping\npolitical change in the region and that had fought to drastically reduce inequality at\nhome had lost much of their radical drive. They continued to justify their rule by claiming\nthat they were seeking to advance the general will and they still reliably mouthed\nrevolutionary platitudes, but the increasingly bloated and sclerotic pan-Arabist regimes\nno longer invested those slogans with any real meaning. On the contrary, the leaders of\nthose states had long since abandoned their earlier commitment to revolutionary\nchange in favor of a more practical and cynical goal: retaining their grip on power.1\n1 Roger Owen, The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life (Cambridge: Harvard\nUniversity Press, 2012), 1\u201311. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 564\nThe particulars differed in important ways, but the transformation of those\nregimes largely followed the same pattern. First, their rulers constructed intricate\nadministrative structures designed to collect power in their hands and to prevent lower-\nranking members of the ruling class from challenging them. For instance, Hafez al-\nAsad (r. 1970-2000) carefully fostered tension among the governing elite in Damascus\nand required all high-ranking officials to report only to him\u2014a tactic that prevented his\nsubordinates from creating a unified front powerful enough to insinuate itself into the\ndecision-making process. Second, while leaders like Asad continued to rule through\nnominally autonomous political parties, they increasingly manipulated and controlled\nthose organizations through traditional patronage networks that were often based on\nclan and ethnoreligious ties. As we saw in chapter sixteen, for example, Saddam\nHusayn ran Iraq and its ostensibly independent Ba\u02bfth Party through a small, reliable\ngroup of Sunni Arabs linked together not through shared ideological convictions but\ninstead through their common membership in the al-Bu Nasir clan to which he\nbelonged. Similarly, Asad controlled Syria through a patronage network based in the\nAlawite community from which he came.2\nFinally, with the partial exception of oil-rich Iraq, each of the pan-Arabist states\nabandoned Arab-socialist economic policies when it became clear that those\napproaches could no longer generate the tax revenue required to provide the\nsubsidized goods that kept the masses satisfied or to fund the security services that\nheld them in check when they were not. This shift did not represent an ideological\nchange of heart or an endorsement of a free-enterprise system, however. Instead, it\namounted to a cynical, calculated embrace of crony capitalism for the purpose of\nbuttressing the regime. Compelled to auction off state assets as part of a debt\nsettlement deal, for instance, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak (r. 1981-2011)\narranged for a group of well-connected capitalists to purchase state monopolies at\nprices that were well-below market value\u2014thereby ensuring that his regime continued\nto have access to the wealth that those assets generated.3\nNo subject was more emblematic of the radical regimes\u2019 shift from being agents\nof revolution to defenders of the kleptocratic status quo than the issue of the\nsuccession. All of the pan-Arabist governments had originally established succession\nprocedures that, while undemocratic, reserved to high-ranking party officials the power\nto select the next ruler. By the 1980s and 1990s, however, the reigning leaders of the\nArab-nationalist states were dismantling those systems in favor of an informal new\narrangement wherein the incumbent rulers anointed their sons as their successors.\nThus, Saddam Husayn designated his son, Qusay (1966-2003), as heir apparent in\n2001, Asad named his son, Bashir al-Asad (r. 2000- ), to succeed him in 1994, and\nMubarak began grooming his son, Gamal (1963- ), for the presidency during the last\nyears of his tenure. It is true that of the three only Bashir al-Asad went on to succeed his\nfather, but that was only because exigent circumstances\u2014the American invasion of Iraq\nin 2003 and the Arab Spring in 2011\u2014prevented Qusay and Gamal from following suit.\n2 Seale, Asad, 340\u201341; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 224\u201326.\n3 Owen, The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life, 40\u201353, 67\u201368, 81\u201382. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 565\nThus, the radical republics that had once challenged the imperial order abroad, attacked\nprivilege at home, and claimed to represent the general will had, by the late-twentieth\ncentury, been transformed into de facto dynastic monarchies headed by \u201cpresidents for\nlife\u201d dedicated above all else to keeping power in the hands of the ruling family.4\nPeople might have tolerated the ruling classes\u2019 corruption and even the\nautocratic nature of their regimes had those governments proven able to deliver the\nmaterial improvements that they had promised. They could not. Instead, as the passage\nof time had so painfully revealed, the pan-Arabist regimes had proven to be as\nincompetent as they were corrupt. This reality was particularly obvious in Egypt. Neither\nGamal Abdel Nasser\u2019s (r. 1952-1970) much ballyhooed Arab Socialism nor Sadat\u2019s\nprogram of economic liberalization, the Infitah, had succeeded in generating anything\neven remotely close to the living standards that the regime had assured would be\nforthcoming.5\nFor many, the pan-Arabist regimes\u2019 inability to achieve the economic growth that\nthey had promised was the last straw. Coupled with the undemocratic nature of the\nArab-nationalist states and their endemic corruption, the failure to produce a rising\nstandard of living resulted in a precipitous decline in enthusiasm beginning in the late\n1970s for the once-radical regimes and, more broadly, for the ideology of pan-Arabism\nthat they claimed to champion. As a result, more and more people in the Arab world\nbegan to search for a political alternative. Increasingly, they found it in Islamism.6\nMainstream Islamists\nModerate Islamist groups that sought to reform society from within were the\nprime beneficiaries of the ideology\u2019s growing appeal. This was certainly the case in\nEgypt. There, the revived\u2014and now peaceful\u2014Muslim Brotherhood experienced a\nsurge in membership over the course of the 1980s as people who had lost faith in the\nsecular state flocked to its banner. The organization worked tirelessly and successfully\nto translate its growing popularity into political power, winning an impressive thirty-six\nseats in the Egyptian parliament in 1987. It also moved to increase its social influence\nby gaining control of important civic bodies including the professional societies for\ndoctors, lawyers, and scientists. By the late 1980s, as a result, the Muslim Brotherhood\nhad not merely reestablished itself but had become a major social and political force.7\nA shift in values and mores in Egypt over the course of the 1980s and 1990s\nreflected Islamism\u2019s surging popularity. Led by Egyptians who had absorbed Wahhabist\nideas while working in Saudi Arabia, a steadily rising share of the population began to\n4 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 286; Owen, The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life, 70\u2013\n72, 83.\n5 Goldschmidt, Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation State, 170\u201371, 180.\n6 Rogan, The Arabs, 394\u201395.\n7 Owen, The Rise and Fall of Arab Presidents for Life, 67; Gerges, Making the Arab\nWorld, 370. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 566\nembrace traditional Islamic practices. Qur\u02beanic recitations replaced music on the radio,\nalcohol consumption fell, and family photographs came down from their perches on\nwalls and atop dressers. This change was most evidence in a return to longstanding\nIslamic gender norms. Men took to wearing traditional clothing and to sporting beards,\nwhile rising numbers of women embraced practices that had fallen out of favor among\nmiddle-class Egyptians during the mid-twentieth century such as gender segregation\nand, especially, veiling. This last change was impossible to miss. While only 30 percent\nof Egyptian women had covered their heads in the 1970s, fully 65 percent did so by the\n1990s.8\nEgypt was hardly alone in experiencing the Islamist revolution. Over the course\nof the 1980s and 1990s, a growing share of people in other Arab countries followed suit\nin abandoning secular mores in favor of Islamic practices and values. As had happened\nin Egypt, Islamic books grew in popularity, women who once favored Western modes of\ndress began to wear traditional Muslim attire, and, thanks to lavish Saudi funding, the\nnumber of mosques and the rate of mosque attendance rose steadily. Meanwhile,\neverywhere they were legal, Islamist political parties began to make big gains. Even\nTurkey, with its long secular tradition, witnessed the emergence of a potent Islamist\npolitical movement, the Islamist Welfare Party, in the 1980s and 1990s. Its growth was\nso rapid, in fact, that the party managed to briefly win control of Turkey\u2019s government in\n1996. It was a taste of things to come.9\nJihadis\nMeanwhile, inspired by the ideas of the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb (1906-1966)\nand, after 1979, by the success of the Iranian Revolution, a small minority eschewed\nmoderate groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and instead swelled the ranks of the\nmilitant Islamist organizations that had begun to emerge in the 1970s. The jihadis\nshared many of the same goals as the moderates but differed sharply with them over\nthe best way to secure those ends. While mainstream Islamists hoped to achieve an\nIslamic government peacefully from within the constituted political system, the jihadis\ninstead sought to impose Islamic rule through violence. In fact, these groups believed\nthat individual Muslims were not merely permitted but were in fact obligated to\noverthrow the secular state\u2014which the Egyptian theorist of radical Islam Muhammad\nFaraj (1954-1982) had dubbed the \u201c\u2018near enemy\u2019\u201d\u2014as the first step toward establishing\nan Islamic polity governed by the shari\u02bfa code. Only then, Faraj maintained, could the\nMuslim Middle East end its subordination to the \u201c\u2018far enemy\u2019\u201d\u2014meaning the West\u2014and\nregain its rightful place as the globe\u2019s leading civilization.10\n8 Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 442; Rogan, The Arabs, 437\u201338; Ghattas,\nBlack Wave, 192\u201395.\n9 Z\u00fcrcher, Turkey, 288\u2013301; Hourani, A History of the Arab Peoples, 442.\n10 Fawaz A.

Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 567\nEgypt once more led the way. Long the center of jihadism, the country already\nhad a number of well-established extremist organizations at the start of the 1980s\nincluding Islamic Jihad and the \u201cblind sheikh\u201d Omar abdel Rahman\u2019s (1938-2017)\nGamaat Islamiya. Dedicated to establishing an Islamist state through force, these\ngroups had become bitterly disillusioned with Sadat\u2019s government for its unwillingness\nto impose Islamism on the country. They seethed as his failure to implement the shari\u02bfa\ncode as he had promised and derided him as a hypocrite whose claim to be the \u201c\u2018pious\npresident\u2019\u201d reflected little more than a cynical ploy to win popular support. They even\nrailed at his willingness to permit his wife, Jihan (1933-2021), to engage in \u201c\u2018immoral\nconduct\u2019\u201d such as her televised dance with President Jimmy Carter (r. 1977-1981) at a\nWhite House function.11\nThe peace treaty with Israel was the final straw. Furious that Sadat had\nabandoned the Palestinians and accepted Israeli rule of Jerusalem, Islamic Jihad began\nplotting his assassination shortly after he had signed the deal. It did not take the\norganization long to succeed. During a televised military parade in 1981 celebrating the\nanniversary of the successful assault across the Suez Canal during the 1973 war, four\nsoldiers affiliated with Islamic Jihad leapt from a troop transport and poured a hail of\ngunfire into the presidential reviewing stand. Riddled with bullets, Sadat died at the\nscene; lightly injured in the attack, his vice president, Husni Mubarak, succeeded him as\nEgypt\u2019s president.12\nThe strength of the Egyptian jihadi organizations waxed and waned over the next\nfew years. In the immediate aftermath of Sadat\u2019s assassination, the regime arrested so\nmany jihadis that their organizations nearly collapsed. Thanks to the government\u2019s\ninexplicable decision to release most of them from prison in the mid 1980s, however,\nboth Gamaat Islamiya and Islamic Jihad\u2014now under the leadership of Ayman\nZawahiri (1951-2022)\u2014were able to reconstitute themselves in the late 1980s. They\nfollowed by initiating a brutal terror campaign in 1992 that targeted security personnel\nand foreign tourists, whom they blamed for bringing Western corruption to their country.\nTo the shock of many Egyptians, they also attacked intellectuals including the prominent\ndefender of secularism, Farag Foda (1946-1992), whom they killed in 1992, and the\nPulitzer Prize-winning novelist, Naguib Mahfouz (1911-2006), who survived a stabbing\nin 1994. All told, more than 1,300 people died in the jihadis\u2019 wave of terror.13\nMeanwhile, in Syria, the violence between the Asad regime and the jihadist\nSyrian Muslim Brotherhood that had begun in the late 1970s escalated dramatically in\nthe early part of the 1980s. The new round of violence began in June 1980 when the\njihadis, who were utterly opposed to the idea of an Alawite-dominated secular\ngovernment, set off a retaliatory cycle of violence by attempting to assassinate Asad.\nThe regime\u2019s reaction was as swift as it was savage. Shortly after the attack, state\nsecurity forces entered a prison in Palmyra and ruthlessly executed hundreds of\n11 Gerges, 45\u201347.\n12 Ghattas, Black Wave, 101\u20139.\n13 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 209\u201310. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 568\nIslamists detained there. Dramatically upping the ante, the jiahdis responded to that\naction by seizing the city of Hama in February 1982 in a bid to precipitate a broad revolt\nagainst Asad. Though well executed, the plan ultimately failed. Thanks to the quick\nmobilization of the army, the regime was able to prevent the nationwide uprising that the\nbrotherhood hoped to provoke. Under the command of Asad\u2019s brother, Rifaat al-\nAsad (1937- ), its forces mercilessly bombarded Hama with tanks, artillery, and missiles.\nTo Hafiz al-Asad\u2019s satisfaction, the siege not only succeeded in retaking the city but\nalso in breaking the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and, thus, in ending the Islamist\nchallenge to the government. The cost was enormous, however: the fighting flattened\nmost of Hama and resulted in the deaths of between 5,000 and 25,000 people.14\nSaudi Arabia\nWhile the relationship between the jihadis and the government was clear in Syria,\nit was considerably more complex in Saudi Arabia and reflected the contradictions\ninherent in the Kingdom. On the one hand, the ruling house had long rooted its\nlegitimacy in its embrace of the austere, Wahhabi version of Islam that had emerged in\ncentral Saudi Arabia in the eighteenth century. The people of Arabia thus lived under an\nIslamist system well before it would become fashionable in the rest of the Middle East.\nOn the other, the thousands of members of the royal family had come to view the state\nas a vast ATM machine that they could use to fund a lifestyle of conspicuous\nconsumption that frequently included haram activities such as gambling, drinking, and\nthe intermixing of the genders. In other words, the often-very public behavior of the\ndynasty directly contradicted the Islamic values on which it claimed to base its rule. To\nobscure this inconsistency, the Saudi family had emphasized its role as the protector of\nthe Holy Places; more importantly, it had made a point of courting the Wahhabi religious\nscholars and their supporters. It did so by providing patronage to the \u02bfulama\u02be in the form\nof salaries and other perquisites, by using the state\u2019s enormous oil wealth to underwrite\nthe spread of Wahhabism throughout the Muslim world, and by permitting the\nmutawaa\u2014the religious police from the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and\nPrevention of Vice\u2014to enforce public morality. For decades, this arrangement had\nseemed to work. By promoting the Saudi family as the champion of Islam and by\nproviding patronage to the \u02bfulama\u02be, it had ensured domestic stability and upheld the\nlegitimacy of the royal family.15\nThe events of 1979 thus came as a great shock to the ruling house. The seizure\nof the Grand Mosque by extremist Muslims not only indicated that the Saudi dynasty\u2019s\ncontrol of the kingdom was far-less secure than previously assumed, but, worse, also\nundermined its legitimacy by suggesting that it could not fulfill its role as the protector of\nthe Holy Cities. Smelling blood, the regime\u2019s opponents were quick to pounce. At home,\nconservative \u02bfulama\u02be and the mutawaa began to openly criticize the government and to\ndemand greater autonomy and increased authority over morality and social laws.\nInternationally, the kingdom faced biting criticism from the newly empowered Ayatollah\n14 McHugo, Syria, 189\u201394; quote from Seale, Asad, 322\u201323.\n15 Ghattas, Black Wave, 52\u201353, 73\u201375. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 569\nKhomeini (1902-1989). Publicly castigating the Saudis for their questionable morality,\nhe inspired a wave of civil unrest among the Shi\u02bfi minority that lived in the kingdom\u2019s\nstrategic, oil-rich Eastern Province. Worse, he mounted a frontal assault on the Saudi\nfamily\u2019s legitimacy by arguing that the protection of Mecca and Medina should\nhenceforth become the collective responsibility of a consortium of Muslim states\nincluding Iran.16\nThe Saudis were in trouble, and they knew it. Faced with what they perceived to\nbe an existential challenge, they responded with a vigorous three-pronged campaign\naimed at blunting the regime\u2019s internal and external threats and at restoring its\nlegitimacy. First, they moved to end domestic criticism by ceding to the \u02bfulama\u02be and the\nmutawaa vastly greater control over social life. Newly empowered, the religious scholars\npromptly banned music, censored art, drove women from employment, and compelled\nthe closure of the small number of cinemas that existed in the kingdom. Meanwhile, the\nnow-unrestrained mutawaa made liberal use of their swagger sticks to tighten\nenforcement of dress codes for women and to compel people to go to mosques at\nprayer times. By the early 1990s, as a result, the Wahhabi religious scholars and their\nallies enjoyed near-unchecked power over social life in the kingdom.17\nSecond, the Saudis sought to counter Iranian criticism among Sunnis who lived\noutside the kingdom by doubling down on their support for the spread of Wahhabi ideas.\nThey did so both by paying for thousands of religious students to study in the kingdom\nunder Wahhabi clerics and by devoting a substantial share of oil revenue to the\nconstruction of a vast network of Wahhabi-run mosques, madrasas, and seminaries\nthroughout the Muslim world. This exercise in soft power would have enormous\nconsequences. In conjunction with Iran\u2019s efforts to promote Khomeini\u2019s extreme\nconstruction of Shi\u02bfism internationally, it helped to precipitate a bitter religious cold war\nin which Wahhabi Saudi Arabia and Shi\u02bfi Iran competed for the hearts and minds of the\nglobe\u2019s Muslim population.18\nAt first, that contest simmered quietly in the background. It boiled over with great\nsuddenness in 1987, however, when clashes between Saudi security forces and Iranian\npilgrims visiting Mecca during the hajj resulted in the deaths of more than 400 people.\nBlaming Khomeini, Riyadh broke relations with Tehran, increased markedly its financial\nsupport for Baghdad in the Iran-Iraq War (a topic we shall explore presently), and\nstepped up its efforts to spread Wahhabism. Iran countered by calling on Muslims to go\nto war with Saudi Arabia and by threatening to attack the Arab states that were\nsupporting Iraq.19\n16 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 169; Nasr, The Shia\nRevival, 150\u201352.\n17 Ghattas, Black Wave, 73\u201375; Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to\n9/11, 167\u201370; Nasr, The Shia Revival, 155\u201357.\n18 Ghattas, Black Wave, 163.\n19 Ghattas, 163. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 570\nFinally, the third component of the Saudi campaign centered on Afghanistan.\nLike Washington, Riyadh viewed Moscow\u2019s action in that country in 1979 with alarm.\nPerceiving the invasion as the first step toward a potential move on the Strait of\nHormuz, the Saudis were determined to prevent the USSR from solidifying its control of\nAfghanistan. Accordingly, in conjunction with the US, the dynasty provided billions of\ndollars\u2019 worth of military aid to the mujahidin, the Afghan guerrillas who were fighting\nSoviet troops with growing efficacy. With this aid\u2014particularly with the introduction of\nportable American Stinger anti-aircraft missiles in 1986\u2014the mujahidin were able to\ngrind the Red Army down until, in 1989, Moscow had become so exhausted that it\npulled its troops out of Afghanistan.20\nWhile the Saudis financed the insurgency in Afghanistan primarily to achieve\ngeostrategic goals, they were quick to grasp that doing so could also help them to\nsecure their ideological objectives. Indeed, supporting the anti-Soviet cause in\nAfghanistan appeared to provide them with a golden opportunity not only to prove their\nIslamist bona fides and to restore their reputation as the protectors of the Holy Cities but\nalso to divert jihadi rage away from the royal family and toward a new, external enemy.\nThey moved to achieve this last end by providing financial backing to a new Islamist\norganization dedicated to fighting the Soviets called the Service Bureau. Operating out\nof Peshawar, Pakistan by the \u02bfulama\u02be Abdullah Azzam (1941-1988) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a\nyoung Saudi man named Osama bin Laden (1957-2011), it recruited and trained Arab\nIslamists to fight alongside the Afghans.21\nFrom a narrowly military perspective, the return on this investment was quite\npoor. Despite receiving substantial funds from both the Saudi government and the\nkingdom\u2019s private citizens, the Service Bureau and its \u201cArab Afghan\u201d recruits\u2014as the\nfighters it trained were known\u2014were of negligible consequence in the war with the\nSoviets. For the Saudi regime, however, the military efficacy of the Arab Afghans was\nbeside the point. It had not lavished funds on the Service Bureau for the purpose of\ndefeating the USSR\u2014the tough, Afghan mujahidin fighters could take care of the\nSoviets\u2014but had instead done so in order to divert the ire of militant Islamists away\nfrom the royal family and toward a new, external enemy. Judged according to that\nyardstick, support for Azzam and Bin Laden was a smashing success. It helped to\nrestore the government\u2019s Islamist reputation at an affordable cost, and it removed a\nsubstantial number of potentially dangerous people from the kingdom during a sensitive\nperiod. To the Saudis, in sum, it had been money very well spent.22\nThere was, however, a potential downside to Riyadh\u2019s support for the Service\nBureau. Diverting jihadis to Afghanistan via the organization had certainly redirected the\nfocus of potential troublemakers away from criticizing the Saudi government and had\nthus served the dynasty\u2019s immediate interests. At the same time, however, support for\n20 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 119\u201327.\n21 Gerges, The Far Enemy, 67\u201368, 75\u201376.\n22 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 121; Gerges, The Far\nEnemy, 67\u201368, 75\u201376. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 571\nthe Service Bureau had helped to create a cadre of well-organized, battle-hardened\nextremists who, having helped defeat the Soviets, might next turn their ire on Riyadh\nand the other governments of the Middle East. That was a problem for the future,\nhowever. In the meantime, the dynasty could celebrate the success of its Afghan\npolicy.23\nThe Lebanese Civil War, 1980-1985\nThough the war in Afghanistan remained a major issue during the 1980s,\nrenewed fighting in Lebanon overshadowed it during the early part of the decade. That\nperiod proved to be a peculiarly difficult one for the Lebanese people. Not only was the\ncivil war still smoldering, but Israel would invade the country in 1982 as the centerpiece\nof an audacious and reckless play to take advantage of the peace treaty with Egypt to\npermanently transform the strategic map of the Middle East in its favor. The brainchild\nof Prime Minister Menachem Begin (r. 1977-1983) and Defense Minister Ariel\nSharon (1928-2014), the Israeli gambit appeared for a time to be a huge success.\nUltimately, however, it would prove to be a spectacular failure, one that would\ndramatically\u2014if unintentionally\u2014alter the course of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nBy the end of the 1970s, the civil war in Lebanon had become enormously\ncomplex. Replete with ambushes, massacres, assassinations, and double dealing, it\nhad devolved into a byzantine struggle in which rival confessional factions entered into\nand then abandoned alliances with dizzying regularity as each struggled to carve out an\nautonomous position within the country. Dominating the situation like a spider was\nAsad. Seeking to exploit the shifting balance in order to render Syria\u2019s dominance of\nLebanon permanent, he had skillfully manipulated events in the country to his\nadvantage. Most notably, while he had intervened in 1976 to prevent a coalition of leftist\nMuslims and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from defeating the Christians,\nhe had\u2014in Machiavellian fashion\u2014promptly shifted sides when the balance of power\nhad begun to tip back toward the Maronites. Now once more in danger of being\noverwhelmed, the leader of the Christian Phalange Party, Pierre Gemayel (1905-1984),\nresponded by entering into a tacit alliance with Israel in which Tel Aviv provided his\nforces with a substantial infusion of much-needed arms.24\nIsrael\u2019s involvement in the Lebanese Civil War went considerably further than\nmerely supplying weapons to the Phalange. As we saw in chapter sixteen, Tel Aviv had\nresponded to the outbreak of the civil war by sponsoring a Lebanese proxy force called\nthe South Lebanese Army (SLA). Equipped with arms provided by the Israeli Defense\nForce (IDF), the SLA maintained a security zone along the border designed to buffer\nIsrael from PLO infiltration and attacks. It was only partially successful in achieving that\nend, however. It could neither prevent all incursions nor inhibit bombardment by the\nPalestinians\u2019 long-range weapons. Accordingly, in keeping with the ideology of the Iron\nWall, the IDF periodically undertook operations in Lebanon designed to weaken or\n23 Gerges, The Far Enemy, 69\u201370.\n24 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 501\u20135. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 572\ndestroy the PLO. Most notably, it used a deadly terrorist attack on a bus near Haifa in\nMarch 1978 as a pretext for a large-scale invasion aimed at eliminating the\norganization\u2019s military infrastructure in southern Lebanon. To Tel Aviv\u2019s frustration,\nhowever, the incursion failed to degrade PLO capabilities.25\nEven worse were the results of a new round of fighting between Israeli and PLO\nforces along the border with Lebanon in the summer of 1981. What began as a series of\nartillery duels quickly escalated into IDF air attacks on the PLO\u2019s headquarters in Beirut\nand massive Palestinian retaliatory bombardments of Israeli settlements in the Galilee\nregion. Eager to prevent the violence from spinning further out of control, Washington\nsent the veteran envoy Philip Habib (1920-1992) to the Middle East to broker a truce.\nNegotiating with the Palestinians through intermediaries, he secured an agreement in\nJuly 1981 that called for the two sides to refrain from further attacks across the\nLebanese border. The ceasefire thus succeeded in ending the bombardment of Israeli\nsettlements in the Galilee; to the frustration of Begin and his political allies, however, the\ndeal also raised the PLO\u2019s international standing and, worse, added fuel to Saudi and\nEuropean peace initiatives that sought the establishment of a Palestinian state on the\nWest Bank and Gaza Strip.26\nThis situation was deeply troubling to Begin and Sharon. Like the rest of the\nLikud Party, the two men firmly backed a maximalist interpretation of Israel\u2019s territory\nand insisted on retaining the Gaza Strip and, especially, the West Bank. Indeed, after\nthe party\u2019s electoral victory in 1981, Begin\u2019s cabinet had, in contravention of Resolution\n242 and a bevy of other agreements, formally annexed the Golan Heights and declared\nthat the claim \u201c\u2018of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel [is] an eternal unassailable\nright\u2019\u201d\u2014meaning, in other words, that Israel had a divinely endorsed claim to the\nOccupied Territories. Unsurprisingly, given these sentiments, Begin and Sharon viewed\nthe peace initiatives and the PLO\u2019s adherence to the ceasefire with grave concern. So\nlong as Yasir Arafat (1929-2004) complied with the truce, pressure for a settlement in\nwhich the Palestinians would secure a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would\ncontinue to build while, in inverse proportion, the prospects for permanent Israeli control\nof the Occupied Territories would diminish.27\nOperation Peace for Galilee, 1982\nIf Begin and Sharon saw danger in Lebanon, they also sensed opportunity.\nIndeed, by the fall of 1981, the two men had come to perceive that country as a venue\nfor a bold military campaign that they believed had the potential to permanently remake\nthe strategic and diplomatic landscape of the region in Israel\u2019s favor. Grand in scope,\ntheir design would not only permanently end the PLO threat in Lebanon, but, more\n25 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 56\u201357.\n26 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 378\u201379.\n27 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 400\u2013405; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-\nArab Conflict, 1881-1920, 508\u20139. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 573\nimportantly, would also permit them to achieve all of the Likud Party\u2019s expansive\nterritorial and security goals.\nInvolving four steps, their plan was a complex one. First, it called for the IDF to\nlaunch a fast-moving offensive into Lebanon that would maul Syrian forces in the\nstrategic Beqaa Valley and, after surrounding the Lebanese capital, isolate the PLO\u2019s\nleadership and the bulk of the organization\u2019s fighters in Muslim West Beirut. Second, in\nexchange for the Phalangist militia destroying the now-trapped PLO, Israel would use its\npower and influence to ensure that the Lebanese parliament selected Pierre Gemayel\u2019s\nson, Bashir (1947-1982), as the country\u2019s new president during elections scheduled for\nAugust 1982. Third, beholden to Tel Aviv, Lebanon\u2019s new president would sign a peace\ntreaty that would establish normalized diplomatic relations with Israel. Bolstered by the\nIDF, finally, Bashir Gemayel would restore his government\u2019s authority over the country\nand, in so doing, inflict a serious diplomatic defeat on Asad\u2014one that would bring a\npermanent end to Syria\u2019s dominance of Lebanon.28\nThe result, Begin and Sharon hoped, would be a thoroughly reconfigured Middle\nEast\u2014one that would permit the Likud Party both to permanently ensure Israel\u2019s\nsecurity needs and to complete the Zionist project begun a century earlier. Coupled with\nthe peace treaty with Egypt, Syria\u2019s military and diplomatic defeat in Lebanon would\nmean that Israel would never again have to worry about its security. More importantly,\nthe destruction of the PLO would so thoroughly demoralize the Palestinians as a people\nthat it would permanently extinguish their sense of nationalism. As a result, Israel would\nbe able to annex the West Bank\u2014territory that the Likud Party viewed as an integral\npart of the Jewish state.29\nBreathtaking in scope, the plan faced several substantial obstacles. First, more\nmoderate members of the cabinet had already made clear when Begin and Sharon had\nraised the idea of another invasion that they flatly opposed military operations that\nextended as far north as Beirut and would only consider authorizing an incursion in\nresponse to a major Palestinian attack. Second, though broadly supportive of Israel, the\nadministration of President Ronald Reagan (r. 1981-1989) had shown itself to be\nsqueamish about the kind of civilian casualties that would inevitably result from an\noperation along the lines that Sharon and Begin were proposing and had already\nindicated to Tel Aviv that it would tolerate an Israeli violation of the ceasefire only if it\ncame in response to a serious PLO attack and only if it extended no further than forty\nkilometers from the border.30\nSecuring cabinet and American approval for an invasion of Lebanon thus\ndepended on the PLO first launching an attack on Israel. Normally, Sharon and Begin\n28 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 406\u20137.\n29 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 509.\n30 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 74\u201375; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict,\n379\u201380; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920,\n514. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 574\ncould count on the organization obliging with a pretext in the form of sporadic shelling or\na terrorist incursion. To their dismay, however, the PLO was pursuing a peace offensive\nat that time and was scrupulously adhering to the ceasefire. As a result, during the\nwinter and spring of 1982, Begin and Sharon found themselves thoroughly boxed in.31\nTo their relief, a Palestinian splinter group freed them to act by mounting a high-\nprofile attack on Israeli interests in the spring of 1982. On June 3, the radical, Iraqi-\nbacked Abu Nidal Group, a bitter opponent of Fatah, critically wounded the Israeli\nambassador to Britain in a botched assassination attempt outside London\u2019s posh\nDorchester Hotel in what was likely an attempt to undermine Arafat by derailing the\nceasefire. Seizing the opportunity that the incident presented, Sharon and Begin asked\nthe cabinet to authorize a massive, 120,000-troop invasion that they disingenuously\nnamed Peace for Galilee. Their colleagues approved the operation; however, they did\nso only after securing promises from Begin and Sharon that the incursion would be a\nlimited one.32\nThis stipulation did not faze the two men. Instead, confident that they would be\nable to use military exigencies to manipulate the cabinet into expanding the war, they\naccepted the terms without complaint. They were correct in this assumption. Taking\nadvantage of the inevitable clashes between IDF and Syrian troops, they had little\ndifficulty over the next few days in persuading the cabinet to approve the steady\nwidening of the conflict.33\nAs a result, Begin and Sharon\u2019s plan proceeded as intended. IDF forces\nsmashed Asad\u2019s divisions in the Beqaa Valley, brushed aside the PLO\u2019s main-force\nbattalions in the south and raced northward to seize the Beirut-Damascus Highway\u2014an\nobjective that lay well beyond the forty-kilometer limit they had discussed with the US.\nFurious with the Israelis for ignoring the conditions that he had set, Reagan sent Philip\nHabib back to the region. Quickly imposing a ceasefire, the American envoy soon\nbrought the invasion to a halt. Before the truce could go into effect, however, the IDF\u2019s\nlead elements were able to link up with Phalangist forces and complete the\nencirclement of Beirut. Thus, despite significant domestic and international obstacles,\nBegin and Sharon\u2019s bid to remake the region was unfolding precisely as they had\nintended.34\nEvacuation of the PLO\nIt was at that point, however, that their plan ran into its first problem. Aware that\nan assault on PLO and Sunni militia positions in West Beirut would not only incur\nmassive casualties but would also undermine the credibility of his presidency before it\neven began, Bashir Gemayel reneged on an earlier promise and informed the Israeli\n31 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 509\u201310.\n32 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 414\u201321.\n33 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 143; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 414\u201321.\n34 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 515\u201331. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 575\ngovernment that the Phalange militia would not lead the assault on the PLO. This\ndecision put Sharon and Begin in a bind. Like Gemayel, they too understood that\nassaulting West Beirut would result in a politically unsustainable level of casualties.\nAccordingly, they shifted from seeking to destroy the PLO outright to attempting to force\nit out of Lebanon. To achieve that new goal, they ordered the IDF to impose a blockade\non Muslim West Beirut and to periodically shell the city\u2014a move that resulted in\nthousands of civilian casualties over the course of a siege that ended up lasting seven\nweeks.35\nThe mounting death toll was too much for the Reagan administration. Keenly\naware of the damage that the casualties were causing to Israel and the United States\u2019s\ninternational reputation, the president once again sent Philip Habib back to the region\u2014\nthis time with instructions to broker a settlement that would safely relocate the PLO from\nWest Beirut. The subsequent talks were characteristically fraught and drawn out, but, on\nAugust 12, Habib finally secured an agreement. It called for the PLO to leave Lebanon\nby ship under the protection of a Multinational Force (MNF) composed of US, French,\nand Italian troops.36\nThe operation went off without a hitch. Beginning on August 21, 11,000\nPalestinian officials and soldiers left Beirut for Tunisia aboard Greek and Italian ships\nescorted by the US Sixth Fleet. A few days after the last contingent of PLO fighters had\ndeparted, the soldiers of the MNF followed suit. Returning to their ships under a banner\nthat read \u201cMission Accomplished,\u201d they left Lebanese waters in early September.37\nSharon and Begin were now ready to put the rest of their grand design in motion.\nThe next step was to ensure that Bashir Gemayel became Lebanon\u2019s new president. To\ndo so, they let Lebanese members of parliament know that peace would return to their\ncountry only if it had a government that enjoyed Israel\u2019s approval, and they instructed\nthe IDF to help friendly deputies travel to Beirut to take part in the vote and to prevent\nhostile ones from making it to the capital. This assistance tipped the balance and\nallowed Bashir Gemayel to handily clear the two-thirds majority needed to become\nLebanon\u2019s next president. As a result, by early September 1982, Begin and Sharon\u2019s\nplan appeared to be back on track. Lebanon was in friendly hands, the PLO was now\nincapable of attacking Israel thanks to its relocation to distant Tunisia, and Syria was\nisolated and weakened.38\nSabra and Shatila\nAt that point, however, the wheels came off their plan to remake the region. Its\ndemise began on September 14 with the assassination of Bashir Gemayel by a Syrian\n35 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 421\u201323.\n36 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 59; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the\nZionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 536\u201338.\n37 Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, 66.\n38 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 425\u201326. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 576\nintelligence agent just a few days before he was to be sworn in as president. In his\nplace, the Lebanese parliament elected his brother, Amin Gemayel (1942- ) as the\ncountry\u2019s new head of state. To Begin and Sharon\u2019s chagrin, Amin intended to follow a\nvery different approach than had his brother. Most notably, despite Israel\u2019s support for\nAmin\u2019s candidacy, the new president made clear once he was sworn in that he was\ncommitted to a neutral, if not pro-Syrian line, and that he opposed closer ties with Tel\nAviv. All at once, in other words, the ground on which Begin and Sharon\u2019s plans for\nLebanon rested\u2014a peace treaty, a tacit alliance, and diplomatic recognition\u2014had\ncollapsed.39\nBegin and Sharon took desperate action to recover the situation. Fearing that a\nforce of 2,000 PLO fighters that he believed had secretly remained behind in the Sabra\nand Shatila refugee camps in West Beirut might further destabilize Israel\u2019s position in\nLebanon, Sharon immediately ordered troops into the city. Rapidly occupying West\nBeirut, IDF units surrounded but did not occupy the camps. Instead, on September 16,\nthey permitted a force of 150 Phalange militia members to enter the camps in order to\nclear out fighters alleged to have \u201c\u2018gone civilian\u2019\u201d when the PLO had evacuated the city.\nOnce inside, the Phalangists made no effort whatsoever to uncover a clandestine\nmilitary apparatus or to ferret out guerrillas. Instead, blaming the Palestinians for Bashir\nGemayel\u2019s death, they set about methodically massacring civilian residents of the\ncamps. Over a roughly thirty-six-hour period, they raped countless Palestinian women\nand murdered between 700 and 2,000 residents of the camps. The vast majority of the\nvictims were women and children.40\nNews of the massacres destroyed what little credibility the invasion of Lebanon\nhad managed to retain. Domestically, IDF involvement in the killings sparked sustained\nopposition to a military operation for the first time in the country\u2019s history. Most notably,\na rally that the antiwar group Peace Now organized to protest both the massacre and\nthe ongoing occupation of Lebanon drew 300,000 Israelis\u2014equivalent to 10 percent of\nthe country\u2019s population\u2014and succeeded in forcing the government to appoint a panel\nheaded by the President of the Israeli Supreme Court, Yitzhak Kahan (1913-1985), to\ninvestigate the killings. Released in February 1983, the Kahan Commission report\nconcluded that the IDF should have known that the Phalangists would seek revenge for\nBashir Gemayel\u2019s assassination and that it thus bore indirect responsibility for the\nkillings. It assigned special responsibility to Ariel Sharon, who, though he remained\nminister without portfolio in the cabinet, was compelled to step down as defense\nminister.41\n39 Shlaim, 427\u201328; Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 60.\n40 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 59\u201360.\n41 Rogan, The Arabs, 417\u201318; Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab\nConflict, 1881-1920, 548. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 577\nAmerican Intervention, 1982-1984\nMeanwhile, the revelation of the massacre resulted in international calls for the\nMNF to return to Lebanon and to help restore order in the capital. In response, the\nrecently departed MNF soldiers disembarked from their ships on September 29 and\ntook up new positions around the airport and in West Beirut. Reagan was enthusiastic\nabout the redeployment. Eager to bring peace to Lebanon, he was convinced that their\npresence would both return security to the city and help the Lebanese government\nrestore its authority over the capital and the territory immediately surrounding it. Many\nwere dubious of his optimism, however. Indeed, critics both inside and outside the\nadministration were skeptical that a force of only a few-thousand soldiers could achieve\nsuch a broad objective and cautioned that involvement in the Lebanese Civil War would\nlikely lead the combatants to begin targeting MNF soldiers. Unheeded, those warnings\nwould prove prescient.42\nReagan followed by pursuing a diplomatic settlement aimed at ending Israel\u2019s\noccupation of Lebanon. Here, the administration abandoned any pretense of neutrality.\nViewing the world through a Cold War lens, it tacitly took Israel\u2019s side in the talks and\nworked to produce an agreement that centered primarily on curbing Syria\u2019s position in\nLebanon. While it did not include formal diplomatic recognition, the resulting treaty was\nnonetheless very favorable to Tel Aviv and seemed to salvage key parts of Begin and\nSharon\u2019s grand design. Signed in May 1983, it ended the technical state of war that had\nexisted between the two countries since 1948 and required Lebanon to prevent attacks\nagainst Israel from its territory. It even permitted Tel Aviv to maintain its ties with the\nSLA and thus to retain its grip on south Lebanon. In exchange, Israel agreed to pull its\ntroops out\u2014though, importantly, only after Syria had completely withdrawn its forces.43\nPredictably, the treaty met with an icy reception in both Lebanon and Syria. The\nLebanese Druze, Shi\u02bfa, and Sunni factions resented what they saw as an Israeli effort\nto impose a one-sided agreement and began to perceive the US not as a neutral party\nbut instead as a hostile combatant. For his part, Asad interpreted the deal as an effort\nby Washington and Tel Aviv to isolate his country and to compel it to abandon the\ndominant position in Lebanon that he had so carefully constructed over the prior seven\nyears. Determined to retain his gains, he responded by unleashing his Lebanese\nproxies against the IDF and the MNF. Accordingly, in the summer of 1983, insurgents\nbegan to step up their use of hit-and-run raids, ambushes, and roadside bombings\nagainst Israeli troops, and, ominously, began to harass the marines and soldiers of the\nMNF with sniper and artillery fire. The Reagan administration found these attacks\nintolerable and responded by ordering Sixth Fleet warships to bombard Druze\nemplacements and by deploying the intimidating World War II-era battleship\nUSS New Jersey to Lebanese waters as a show of strength. To the delight of the\n42 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 549.\n43 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 383\u201384. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 578\npresident, the use of force appeared to work: shortly after the navy turned its five-inch\nguns on them, the Druze called for a ceasefire.44\nIn reality, the bombardment had not cowed the Lebanese factions in the least.\nInstead, it merely caused them to shift tactics. The result was a pair of horrifying, near-\nsimultaneous truck-bombing attacks by a shadowy new terrorist group on October 23:\none that killed fifty-eight French paratroopers and destroyed the nine-story building that\nserved as their headquarters and an even-bigger one that killed 241 marines and\nobliterated their four-story barracks in what remains the single deadliest day the Marine\nCorps has experienced since the Battle of Iwo Jima. Washington was in shock. Reagan\ninitially favored keeping the marines in Lebanon and claimed that leaving would damage\nAmerican credibility. Faced with staunch opposition from within his administration,\nhowever, he relented and agreed to pull US forces out in February 1984\u2014though not\nbefore demonstrating American resolve by ordering the USS New Jersey to pummel\nSyrian and Druze positions with barrages of 1,900-pound, sixteen-inch shells.45\nIsrael was not far behind. With IDF troops facing an average of more than one-\nhundred Shi\u02bfi attacks per month by the middle of 1984, Lebanon had become a\nquagmire that was growing more challenging and dispiriting by the day. The situation\nhad become so dangerous in early 1985 that infantry units had to have tanks\naccompany them when they went out on even routine patrol. The end finally came when\nthe Labor Party\u2019s Shimon Peres (r. 1977, 1984-1986, 1995-1996), became prime\nminister in 1984. Peres was determined to end Israel\u2019s occupation of Lebanon, but, as\nthe head of a national unity government, was compelled to move slowly. As a result, it\nwas only in early 1985 that he managed to win enough votes in his cabinet for a\nwithdrawal to the security zone just north of the Israeli border. Completed in June 1985,\nthe move formally ended the war that Begin and Sharon had started with such\nanticipation three years earlier.46\nConsequences\nThe war in Lebanon ultimately proved to be a costly disaster for Israel. Sharon\nand Begin had launched it in order to restructure the strategic and diplomatic landscape\nof the Middle East in Israel\u2019s favor and to set the stage for the annexation of the West\nBank. It had failed to achieve either goal. Instead, their gambit had not only left their\ncountry less secure than it had been before the invasion but had also greatly\ncomplicated their effort to annex the West Bank.\nIronies abounded. First, the Israeli invasion ended up solidifying Asad\u2019s control\nover Lebanon\u2014an outcome that would have beggared belief in the summer of 1982. As\nwe have seen, Syria had suffered a humiliating military setback at the start of Operation\n44 Rogan, The Arabs, 419\u201320; Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 384.\n45 Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, 72\u201373; Ghattas, Black Wave,\n138.\n46 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 552\u201358. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 579\nPeace for Galilee that had made emphatically clear that its army could not compete with\nthe mighty IDF. Its defeat had been so total, in fact, that most observers had concluded\nthat its influence over Lebanese affairs was at an end. Asad was unfazed, however.\nRather than abandoning his position in Lebanon in the face of superior Israeli power, he\nshifted to a new strategy that relied on Syria\u2019s Lebanese proxies to achieve his ends. As\nwe have seen, that approach proved to be wildly successful. Not only did it force the\nUnited States and Israel out of Lebanon, but it also compelled Amin Gemayel to\nabrogate the May 1983 agreement with Tel Aviv and to accept Syrian dominance of his\ncountry. Thus, ironically, a conflict designed in part to push Asad out of Lebanon had\ninstead ended with him tightening his grip over it.47\nSecond, the war ended with Israel confronting a new enemy in Lebanon: the Shi\u02bfi\nIslamist group Hizbullah. Prior to 1982, the Shi\u02bfa had resented the PLO\u2019s domination of\nLebanon\u2019s south; as a result, they had viewed the IDF soldiers who arrived that June as\nliberators and even showered them with rose petals and rice\u2014a traditional Lebanese\ngreeting. That sentiment did not last, however. Instead, a combination of heavy-handed\nIsraeli rule and the arrival of Iranian agents quickly turned the Lebanese Shi\u02bfi against\nthe occupying army. Tehran\u2019s efforts were particularly important in sparking this shift.\nDetermined to expand its influence, it built schools, subsidized goods such as gasoline,\nspread Khomeini\u2019s Islamist ideology, and provided training in military and terrorist\noperations to a growing number of recruits eager to strike back at Israel.48\nThe result was the establishment in mid-1982 of a new terrorist organization,\nIslamic Jihad. Despite the traditional Muslim ban on killing oneself, the group initially\nfocused on using suicide attacks to combat Israeli and Western forces in Lebanon. It\nbegan in November 1982, when a suicide bomber\u2014the first in the history of the modern\nMiddle East\u2014killed seventy-five IDF soldiers by driving a bomb-laden truck into their\ncommand post in Tyre. It followed with the bombing of the US embassy in April 1983\nand the shocking attacks on the Multinational Force the following October. Islamic Jihad\nalso kidnapped and killed a number of Westerners in Lebanon including the president of\nthe American University in Beirut, Malcolm Kerr (1931-1984).49\nLater, under Iranian guidance, Islamic Jihad would evolve into Hizbullah, or\n\u201cParty of God,\u201d a political party with a powerful militant wing. Highly effective, its\noperations played a key part in impelling the IDF to retreat to the south in 1985.\nHizbullah fighters did not stop their attacks following the Israeli withdrawal to the\nsecurity zone, moreover. Instead, dedicated to pushing Israel out of all of Lebanon, they\ncontinued to harass IDF forces in the south and periodically fired rockets at settlements\nin the Galilee. Thus, in a bitter irony for Israel, the invasion that Begin and Sharon had\ndesigned in part to end PLO attacks across the Lebanese border had merely served to\n47 Rogan, The Arabs, 419\u201320; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 433\u201334.\n48 Rogan, The Arabs, 420\u201323.\n49 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 166\u201367; Rogan, The Arabs, 421\u201322. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 580\nreplace Arafat\u2019s guerrillas with far-better disciplined and equipped Hizbullah fighters\nwho were able to launch similar strikes with far-greater efficacy.50\nThird, the PLO\u2019s military defeat in Lebanon had failed to produce the collapse in\nmorale among the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories that Begin and Sharon had\nanticipated. On the contrary, frustrated by the inability of the Arab states and the PLO to\ndeliver them from the Israeli occupation, the people of the Gaza Strip and the West\nBank had come to adopt a new resolve in the wake of the war in Lebanon that would\nsoon set the stage for the most significant progress that the Palestinians had achieved\nsince before the Nakba in 1948. Thus, ironically, Operation Peace for Galilee had\nrendered Begin and Sharon\u2019s cherished goal of annexing the West Bank more rather\nthan less difficult.51\nFinally, the invasion altered dramatically the nature of the Palestinian-Israeli\nstruggle. It is true that Operation Peace for Galilee had succeeded in destroying the\nmilitary infrastructure with which the PLO had threatened northern Israel. However, the\norganization had always been so feeble compared to the IDF that it could never have\nsecured its objectives on the battlefield. In fact, as we have seen, nearly all the PLO\u2019s\nsuccess had come through diplomacy rather than force. Thus, by compelling the\norganization to relocate to distant Tunisia, Operation Peace for Galilee weakened the\nPLO hardliners who supported military operations while simultaneously strengthening\nthe moderates who backed negotiations\u2014in the process, ironically, setting the\norganization on a course that was far-more likely to succeed.52\nThe Palestinian Revival\nInitially, Arafat\u2019s efforts to pursue diplomacy following the PLO\u2019s relocation to\nTunisia proved unsuccessful. Two obstacles stood in his way. First, backed by strong\nUS support, Israel remained implacably opposed not merely to making territorial or\npolitical concessions, but to the very idea of taking part in negotiations with the PLO at\nall. Second, Arafat\u2019s diplomatic initiatives faced concerted hostility from the Palestinian\nsplinter groups. Indeed, those organizations were so determined to regain all of the\nterritory that had composed mandatory Palestine that they deliberately acted to poison\nthe waters anytime Arafat\u2019s diplomatic push seemed to be making headway. For\nexample, when a joint Palestinian-Jordanian initiative appeared to show promise in\n1985, the People\u2019s Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) moved to scotch it by\nhijacking an Italian cruise ship, the MS Achille Lauro, and murdering one of its\npassengers, a disabled Jewish-American man named Leon Klinghoffer (1916-1985).53\n50 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 556\u201359.\n51 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 406.\n52 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 165; Morris, Righteous Victims: A\nHistory of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 558.\n53 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 410. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 581\nBy 1986, even the Arab states were distancing themselves from Arafat. Egypt\u2019s\nrehabilitation in the Arab world made this shift clear. Concluding that Saddam Husayn\ndesperately needed Egypt\u2019s material and diplomatic support in his war with Iran, the\nArab League states renewed diplomatic relations with Mubarak in 1987 over vigorous\nPLO objections. Demoralizingly, when Arafat traveled to Jordan to object, King\nHusayn (r. 1952-1990) did not have the PLO chair greeted with the pomp and\ncircumstance he had enjoyed in the past. Instead, in a calculated snub that reflected\nArafat\u2019s declining influence, the king sent a mere subcabinet-level official to pick him up\nat the airport.54\nThe circumstances in which the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories found\nthemselves paralleled the PLO\u2019s waning fortunes. Initially, Israeli rule had been\nunwelcomed but tolerable and even\u2014in some ways\u2014beneficial for the residents of the\nGaza Strip and West Bank. Now free to work in Israel, for example, the Palestinians\nwere able to access substantially higher-paying jobs than they had under Jordanian or\nEgyptian administration. Meanwhile, though the Israelis were building settlements, they\nwere doing so at a low rate and had made a point of situating them well away from Arab\ntowns.55\nLife under Israeli rule changed dramatically with the Likud victory in 1977,\nhowever. With the goal of preventing future cabinets from ceding land or agreeing to a\nPalestinian state in the Occupied Territories, the Begin government dramatically\nstepped up the pace of settlement construction; as a consequence, the 5,000 Israeli\nsettlers who lived in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1977 ballooned to 60,000 by\n1987. The Likud government also imposed increasingly obnoxious and humiliating\nregulations on the Palestinians. They affected travel, land use, and employment, and\nincluded water and agriculture policies so restrictive that they resulted in the\nPalestinians farming fewer acres in 1987 than they had in 1947. Meanwhile, the onset\nof a deep recession in the early 1980s produced soaring unemployment and a sharply\ndeclining standard of living in the territories that further immiserated the Palestinians. By\n1987, as a consequence, the Occupied Territories were a place of barely contained\nfrustration and fury\u2014a tinderbox ready to burst into flames.56\nThe Intifada\nThe match that ignited it came in the form of a traffic accident at a checkpoint\nbetween the Gaza Strip and Israel. On December 8, 1987, an IDF driver killed four\nPalestinians when his transport slammed into a line of cars carrying workers back from\ntheir jobs in Israel. With frustration already at a fever pitch, rumors that the crash was\nintentional led thousands of mostly young Palestinians to explode in a spontaneous\nuprising in the Gaza Strip immediately after the victims\u2019 funerals. Despite their anger,\n54 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 214.\n55 Gelvin, 185.\n56 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 69; Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 189\u201391,\n215. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 582\nthe protestors neither engaged in deadly attacks nor targeted settlements. Instead,\nseeking to put maximum moral pressure on Israel, they agreed to confine themselves to\nnon-lethal acts including demonstrations, rock throwing, and a refusal to pay the taxes\nthat supported the occupation. Coming at a time of enormous anger in the territories,\nthe uprising\u2014soon known as the Intifada or \u201cshaking off\u201d\u2014rapidly spread to the West\nBank and East Jerusalem. As a result, within just a few short weeks, the entirety of the\nOccupied Territories was in open revolt against the Israelis.57\nSensing that the Intifada could produce tangible gains, the Palestinians in the\nOccupied Territories quickly moved to organize themselves to ensure its effectiveness.\nThis effort involved a division of labor by age. While the huge number of young people\nin the Occupied Territories threw rocks and baited Israeli security forces, more\nmoderate, middle-aged community leaders established a new body called the Unified\nNational Leadership (UNL) to coordinate the uprising. Convinced that the Palestinians\nwould enjoy greater success if they avoided causing bloodshed, the UNL took steps to\nensure that the protestors continued to eschew outright violence. It also drafted and\nreleased a manifesto\u2014the Fourteen Points\u2014that formally articulated the Intifada\u2019s\npolitical goals. Moderate in tone and realistic in objective, it called for the establishment\nof an independent Palestinian state under PLO administration in the Gaza Strip and\nWest Bank that would live in peace alongside Israel.58\nThe Israelis badly mishandled the protests. The unity government headed by\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir (r. 1986-1992) believed that Israel needed not merely to\nrestore order in the territories but, more importantly, to crush any hope among the\nPalestinians that the Intifada might produce a favorable political settlement for them. In\nkeeping with this approach, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin (1922-1995) instructed\nIsraeli security forces to employ \u201c\u2018might, force, and beatings\u2019\u201d and even to break the\narms of children who threw rocks. Accordingly, the IDF enforced curfews, arrested\nthousands, and fired rubber bullets at unarmed teenagers. It also closed schools and\nuniversities in the territories and demolished the homes of those suspected of throwing\nstones. It was an over-the-top response, and it imposed enormous costs on the\nPalestinians. Indeed, during its first year alone, Israeli security forces killed 626\nPalestinians, wounded 37,000, and jailed 35,000 more.59\nDespite the arrests and the loss of life, the Israeli response failed to cow the\nPalestinians. Instead, the use of overwhelming force backfired badly during the\nIntifada\u2019s early years both inside and outside the territories. In the Gaza Strip and West\nBank, the resort to massive repression and reliance on collective punishment not only\nfailed to break the resistance but also served to create a strong sense of solidarity that\ninspired less-committed Palestinians to join the protests. Internationally, televised\nfootage of IDF troops firing on and beating unarmed Palestinian teenagers rapidly\ntransformed Israel\u2019s image from that of a plucky David into that of an overbearing\n57 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 412, 419.\n58 Smith, 420\u201322; Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 217\u201319.\n59 Rogan, The Arabs, 433\u201337. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 583\nGoliath. The violent response even went over poorly within the Jewish state. The use of\noverwhelming force against unarmed Palestinians reinvigorated opposition groups such\nas Peace Now and demoralized soldiers who had joined the IDF under the expectation\nthat they would be protecting Israel from foreign attack rather than violently policing\ncivilians. In fact, during the Intifada\u2019s first seven months alone, over 600 soldiers\nclaimed conscientious objector status in order to avoid serving in the Occupied\nTerritories.60\nThe Palestinian Declaration of Independence\nAt the same time that the Intifada was posing serious challenges to the Israeli\ngovernment, it was throwing a lifeline to the beleaguered PLO. Arafat was quick to take\nadvantage. He first used the UNL\u2019s call for a Palestinian state in the territories as a way\nto marginalize the inflexible militants in the splinter groups. With the extremists safely\ncontained, he followed by orchestrating a pair of bold moves designed to advance the\nprospects of a two-state solution in which the Palestinians would have a state in the\nWest Bank and Gaza Strip that stood alongside a Zionist one within Israel\u2019s pre-1967\nborders. First, in November 1988, he arranged for the Palestine National Council (PNC)\nto issue the Palestinian Declaration of Independence and to express its willingness to\nnegotiate on the basis of United Nations (UN) Resolutions 242 and 338. Second, at\nAmerican urgings, he formally and publicly renounced terrorism in December 1988.\nThese announcements marked the culmination of the diplomatic approach that he had\ncautiously initiated in the 1970s, and they quickly bore fruit. Eighty-four countries\nincluding the People\u2019s Republic of China and the USSR promptly extended diplomatic\nrecognition to the new Palestinian state. Meanwhile, with Arafat having satisfied the\nconditions Washington had set for direct contact, PLO and US representatives began\nholding regular discussions. It was a heady moment\u2014a time when the prospects for a\nresolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had never been brighter.61\nHamas\nArafat\u2019s bold initiative did not enjoy universal support among the Palestinians,\nhowever. In addition to the now-marginalized splinter groups, a new and dynamic\nIslamist organization called Hamas expressed unbending opposition to his diplomatic\nprogram. The group\u2019s origins were intimately tied to the Intifada. Just five days after the\nrebellion began, the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood established Hamas in the Gaza\nStrip to help coordinate the uprising. Influential from the start, the organization began\nlaying out its goals in a formal charter that it issued in August 1988. Taking direct aim at\nboth the PLO\u2019s secular nationalism and the two-state solution, it announced that\nPalestine was a divinely provided \u201c\u2018Islamic trust\u2019\u201d that no ruler or people could alienate\nor divide. Accordingly, the charter declared forthrightly that the organization\u2019s twin goals\nwere the destruction of Israel through jihad and the establishment of a shari\u2019a-based\nPalestinian state that would occupy the entirety of the former mandate. It was a strident\n60 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 71; Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 216\u201321.\n61 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 481\u201382; Rogan, The Arabs, 435\u201336. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 584\nprogram that ran directly counter to the UNL\u2019s more conciliatory vision. It was also one\nthat was working fertile ground. Thanks to Saudi Arabia\u2019s generous funding of Wahhabi-\ninfluenced charities and mosques in the Occupied Territories, many Palestinians were\npredisposed to the group\u2019s explicitly religious message. As a result, Hamas soon won a\nsubstantial following\u2014particularly in the Gaza Strip.62\nImpasse\nThe failure of Arafat\u2019s diplomatic push to produce results accelerated Hamas\u2019s\ngrowth in 1989 and 1990. At first, the PLO\u2019s bold initiative appeared to be successful.\nThanks to Arafat\u2019s willingness to formally embrace the two-state solution, the\nadministration of President George H. W. Bush (r. 1989-1993) had begun pressuring\nTel Aviv to respond to the PLO\u2019s peace initiative. Unable to stonewall its American\npatron, Shamir\u2019s government issued an Israeli plan for the territories in May 1989. Thin\non details, it proposed elections in the Occupied Territories that would lead to a vaguely\ndefined form of autonomy for the Palestinians under an arrangement in which Israel\nwould continue to oversee key issues such as security, the distribution of land, and the\nconstruction of settlements.63\nWhile Shamir\u2019s proposal may have amounted to something of a step forward on\nthe part of the Israeli government, it was not, at the end of the day, a substantive plan\naimed at achieving peace. On the contrary, as Arafat and his allies well understood, it\nwas an effort to delay genuine talks while Shamir\u2019s government constructed further\nsettlements in the Occupied Territories\u2014partly to house a sudden influx of Jewish\nimmigrants from the USSR but, more broadly, to create further \u201c\u2018facts on the ground\u2019\u201d\nthat could ensure Israel\u2019s perpetual control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Indeed, an\naddendum to the plan made explicit the limits of Shamir\u2019s proposal. It declared\nunequivocally that Israel would neither negotiate with the PLO nor permit the\nPalestinians to create a state in the occupied territories.64\nShamir\u2019s response put the PLO chair and his moderate allies in a difficult spot.\nArafat\u2019s inability to secure any meaningful gains in exchange for his renunciation of\nterrorism had, in zero-sum fashion, weakened the PLO and the UNL to the benefit of\nHamas. In fact, Hamas felt strong enough in early 1990 to begin mounting a serious\nchallenge to the PLO-aligned UNL for control of the Intifada and, thus, for a dominant\nposition in the Occupied Territories. Arafat did not take the Islamists\u2019 threat lightly. He\nunderstood that he faced a dangerous threat and that he would need to find a way to\ninduce Israel to make concessions if he wished to avoid seeing the PLO eclipsed by\nHamas. Accordingly, in the spring of 1990, he moved to restore his control over the\nPalestinian movement and to breathe life into his diplomatic effort by developing closer\n62 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 221\u201326.\n63 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 609\u201310.\n64 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 424\u201325; quote from Rashid Khalidi,\nPalestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness (New York:\nColumbia University Press, 1997), xxv. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 585\nties with the only Arab leader who possessed the military power to threaten Israel and\nthus to compel it to negotiate: Saddam Husayn.65\nThe Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988\nAt that point, Saddam Husayn\u2019s country was less than two years removed from a\ndevastating, near-decade long conflict: the Iran-Iraq War. By far the deadliest military\ncontest in the post-World War II Middle East, the struggle between Ba\u02bfthist Iraq and\nShi\u02bfi Iran proved to be ruinously expensive for both states\u2014an outcome that would\nhave surprised Saddam Husayn at the time it began. Indeed, as we shall explore in\nmore detail in a moment, he had started the conflict believing that postrevolutionary\nIran\u2019s already substantial divisions would widen considerably in the face of an Iraqi\nattack and thereby render Tehran incapable of mounting an effective defense. He was\nthus blithely confident both that the war would be no more than a brief, limited contest\nand that it would quickly compel Iran to make concessions favorable to Iraq.\nThe Early War\nThe war began in September 1980. Unilaterally declaring the revocation of the\nAlgiers Accord, Saddam Husayn sent the Iraqi army across the Shatt al-Arab Waterway\nin a limited offensive aimed at securing territory that Iraq could then trade for\nconcessions from Tehran. Despite ominously heavy resistance, his troops quickly\nseized control of 26,000 square kilometers of Iranian territory including the strategic city\nof Khorramshahr. Having taken what he believed was sufficient land to achieve his\ndiplomatic ends, Husayn then ordered his army to assume defensive positions and\nawaited Tehran\u2019s appeal for a negotiated settlement.66\nIt did not come. Saddam Husayn had been correct about Iran\u2019s internal divisions,\nbut he had badly miscalculated the impact of his attack on its domestic political\nsituation. Rather than undermining the revolutionary government by stoking further\ndiscord, the Iraqi invasion had instead presented Iranians with a common enemy that\nthey could unify against. Khomeini was quick to take advantage. Exploiting the surge in\nnationalist and Shi\u02bfi sentiment that the invasion had engendered, he rallied support for\nhis regime and recruited huge numbers of new soldiers for his armies. As a result, his\ngovernment was able to quickly expand the Revolutionary Guard into a 120,000-strong\nmilitary force and to secure hundreds of thousands of volunteers for the Basej-e\nMostazefan, or the \u201cMobilization of the Oppressed\u201d: a militia composed of ideologically\nmotivated but militarily untrained youth who were prepared to sacrifice their lives in\ndefense of the revolution.67\nMany of them did. In a series of huge, human-wave attacks in early 1982,\nRevolutionary Guard, Basej-e Mostazefan, and regular army forces furiously struck Iraqi\n65 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 425\u201328.\n66 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 232\u201333.\n67 Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 171, 175. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 586\npositions. These assaults resulted in huge numbers of Iranian casualties, but they also\nsucceeded in forcing the invaders to retreat back across the Shatt-al-Arab Waterway in\nJune 1982. It was an impressive victory for the Iranian military. Khomeini refused to let\nhis generals rest on their laurels, however. Determined to finish off Saddam Husayn and\nhis Ba\u02bfthist regime, he instead instructed them to press forward and to continue the\noffensive across the border.68\nWar of Attrition\nThe next few years were trying ones for Iraq. To a substantial degree, its\nproblems were fiscal in nature. The war had quickly become incredibly expensive\u2014\ncompelling Husayn\u2019s government to spend a staggering $1 billion per month on its\ndirect costs alone. Worse, thanks to the destruction of much of Iraq\u2019s port infrastructure\nin the fighting and to Iranian ally Hafez al-Asad\u2019s closure of the trans-Syrian pipeline, oil\nrevenue had collapsed from $26 billion in 1979 to a paltry $11 billion in 1987\u2014an\namount that was insufficient to pay for the war let alone the substantial social-welfare\nbenefits that Saddam Husayn had introduced in the 1970s.69\nStill, however bleak Iraq\u2019s fiscal position may have been, its military situation was\neven grimmer. Between 1983 and 1985, Iranian forces launched a new series of\nhuman-wave offensives against heavily fortified Iraqi defensive positions. Though\nunsuccessful, these assaults inflicted enormous casualties and left the Iraqi army\ndemoralized and badly overstretched. The situation worsened dramatically in 1986\nwhen Iranian-supported Kurdish guerrillas opened a second front in the north that\ndiverted scarce Iraqi troops from the main theater. Taking advantage, Iranian forces\nlaunched a huge offensive in the south that captured the strategic al-Faw peninsula and\nimperiled Iraq\u2019s only port: the city of Basra.70\nUltimately, it was international concerns about an Iranian victory that rescued\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s regime from defeat. Determined to avoid a situation in which\nKhomeini\u2019s government dominated the Persian Gulf, Western countries and the Gulf\nStates loaned Iraq the enormous sums needed to continue the war. Baghdad used\nthose funds to procure billions of dollars\u2019 worth of high-tech equipment including Soviet\nT-72 tanks and Exocet-missile-equipped French Mirage jets as well as dual-use goods\nsuch as pesticides that could be converted into chemical weapons. The Iraqi\ngovernment even received assistance from the US. Despite holding serious misgivings\nabout Husayn, the Reagan administration gradually tilted toward Baghdad over the\ncourse of the mid 1980s. It took Iraq off the list of states that sponsor terrorism in 1982,\nextended it agricultural credits in 1983, and, most importantly, began providing it with\nvital satellite intelligence in 1984.71\n68 Keddie, Modern Iran, 251; Axworthy, A History of Iran, 268.\n69 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 187, 203\u20135.\n70 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 238\u201342.\n71 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 77\u201380. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 587\nWhat led Iraq and the US to cooperate? Why did two countries so hostile to one\nanother that they had not had formal diplomatic relations since 1967 put aside their\ndifferences? They did so for reasons of realpolitik. That is, while their specific concerns\nwere very different, they collaborated because each feared the prospects of an Iranian\nvictory more than they opposed each other. Indeed, their shared concern about Iran\nwas enough that they were able to look past not just older differences but new ones as\nwell in pursuit of their mutual goal. Thus, Iraq did not dwell on the administration\u2019s\namateurish, Iran-Contra efforts to secure the release of Western hostages in Lebanon\nby selling antitank missiles and spare parts to Tehran, while the US chose to look the\nother way when Iraqi forces used chemical weapons against Iranian troops.72\nButtressed by Western and Gulf State aid, Iraq\u2019s reequipped army began to turn\nthe tide in 1987. In brutal fighting early that year, it managed to decisively defeat a huge\nIranian drive aimed at taking control of the city of Basra. Building on this success, the\nIraqis followed by returning to the offensive for the first time since 1980. In the north, Ali\nHasan al-Majid (1941-2010), better known as Chemical Ali, subdued the rebellious\nKurds through the savage al-Anfal, \u201c\u2018spoils of war\u2019\u201d campaign that began in the spring of\n1988. It was a ruthless effort even by the standards of Saddam Husayn\u2019s Iraq.\nFrequently employing chemical weapons\u2014most notably in an attack on the town of\nHalabja that killed between 3,500 and 5,000 people\u2014Iraqi soldiers destroyed five-\nhundred villages, executed countless men, and confined women and children to prison-\nlike camps. All told an estimated fifty thousand to one-hundred thousand Kurds perished\nin the al-Anfal campaign. Meanwhile, in the south, the massively expanded Iraqi army\nmade liberal use of chemical weapons in an offensive that regained control of the al-\nFaw peninsula and thus ended the Iranian threat to Basra. In support of that push, Iraq\nfired hundreds of long-range SCUD surface-to-surface missiles at Iranian cities.73\nTanker Wars\nThe Iraqi offensive also benefited from the outbreak in 1987 of an undeclared\nnaval conflict between Iran and the US known as the Tanker War. Its origins stretched\nback to a campaign that Saddam Husayn had launched in 1984 to pressure Iran by\nfiring on ships bound for its ports. Taking advantage of the fact that Iraq was equally\nvulnerable to such operations, Khomeini had countered by striking tankers bound for\nIraq and its Gulf State backers. The impact of these attacks was substantial. Between\n1984 and 1986, Iranian mines and other weapons damaged sixty-seven ships including\neight Kuwaiti-registered tankers in a series of attacks that raised doubts about whether\nthe Gulf States could continue to export oil. By 1987, such worries pushed an\nincreasingly nervous Kuwaiti government to ask Washington to reflag eleven of its\nsupertankers so that they would enjoy US naval protection as they made the long and\nvulnerable transit of the Persian Gulf. Despite congressional concern that complying\nmight draw the US into a war with Iran\u2014a fear made all-too real by an accidental Iraqi\nattack on the frigate USS Stark in May 1987 that killed thirty-seven sailors\u2014the Reagan\n72 Hahn, 77\u201380; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 187\u201388.\n73 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 188\u201391, 200\u2013202. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 588\nadministration agreed to the request. Two months later, US Navy ships began escorting\nreflagged tankers to and from Kuwait.74\nAs critics had predicted, it was not long before the operation turned into a\nshooting war. In a series of clashes that took place between September 1987 and April\n1988, US forces sank most of Iran\u2019s navy and destroyed many of the offshore oil\nplatforms from which Revolutionary Guard speedboats had mounted hit-and-run\nattacks. The operation was thus successful in ensuring the free flow of petroleum from\nthe Gulf. It ended in tragedy, however. On July 3, 1988, the cruiser USS Vincennes\naccidentally shot down Flight 655, an Iranian Airbus 300 jetliner, it misidentified as an\nattacking F-14 fighter jet\u2014killing all 290 people on board.75\nThe incident played a small-but-significant part in spurring Tehran to agree to a\nproposed UN ceasefire in the summer of 1988. By that point, Iran was in dire straits. It\nwas not only suffering serious battlefield defeats, but, more importantly, was witnessing\nthe slow implosion of its economy. In response, an overwhelming consensus of Iranian\nofficials had come to conclude that the fighting needed to come to an end and that it\nneeded to do so as soon as possible. Khomeini was not one of them. Still firmly\ncommitted to the war, he adamantly rejected his advisors\u2019 insistent claims that Iran\ndesperately needed to accept the ceasefire. As a result, despite its increasingly grim\ncircumstances, Iran continued to fight on.76\nIt was the muted response to the downing of Flight 655 that finally changed his\nmind. The ayatollah could ignore the bleak economic and military situation that Iran\nconfronted, but he could no longer disregard either the growing war weariness at home\nor, especially, the country\u2019s worsening diplomatic isolation abroad that the subdued\nreaction to the downing of the airliner had revealed. As a result, though he derided it as\na \u201c\u2018poisoned chalice,\u2019\u201d Khomeini finally relented and agreed to accept the UN ceasefire\nproposal in July 1988.77\nWhere Historians Disagree: The Iran-Iraq War\u2019s Origins\nSince 1980, a lively debate has taken place regarding the origins of the Iran-Iraq\nWar. Scholars largely agree that the Iranian Revolution set the stage for the conflict and\nthat Iraq fired the first shot; however, they continue to argue about Saddam Husayn\u2019s\nmotivations. Some maintain that he was behaving opportunistically. Historians like\nCharles Tripp contend that the Iraqi dictator had acted in hopes of taking advantage of\nIran\u2019s postrevolutionary divisions and isolation to compel it to abrogate the Algiers\nAccord that the Iraqi dictator had signed with Iran in 1975\u2014an outcome that would both\n74 Little, American Orientalism, 250\u201352.\n75 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 82.\n76 Ghattas, Black Wave, 177\u201378.\n77 Ghattas, 177\u201378. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 589\nreverse the damage that the agreement had done to his reputation and enhance his\nstanding as a champion of Arab nationalism.78\nOthers instead argue that defensive considerations predominated in motivating\nthe Iraqi dictator to go to war. While not denying Husayn\u2019s opportunism, for example,\nthe writer Phebe Marr maintains that aggressive Iranian actions played a critical role in\nhis decision making. As she notes, Khomeini had begun inciting a Shi\u02bfi uprising in Iraq\nalmost from the moment he had returned to Tehran in 1979. Deeply concerned about\nthis threat, Husayn sought to exploit the disarray in Iran to launch a limited invasion that\nwould compel Khomeini to halt his call for a Shi\u02bfi revolt in Iraq and, in so doing, end\nwhat had become a serious threat to his regime.79\nConsequences\nRegardless of the war\u2019s causes, the end of the fighting could not have come\nsoon enough for Iran. the conflict had been a draining and devastating one for a country\nfresh from a cataclysmic revolution. More than 16,000 Iranian civilians and over 190,000\nsoldiers had died in the fighting, and the Iraqi attacks on its cities had left thousands\nmore homeless. The war had also greatly weakened the economy. Per capita income\nwas a shocking 40 percent lower at the end of the conflict than it had been a decade\nearlier, and vast amounts of vital infrastructure and industry had been destroyed or\nheavily damaged in the fighting. Reconstruction was projected to take many years,\nmoreover, meaning that depressed economic conditions would likely endure long after\nthe fighting had stopped.80\nAs bad as the war had been for Iran, it was even more disastrous for Iraq. The\ndrawn-out fighting had devastated the country\u2019s cities, killed over 250,000 Iraqis, and\ncaused the economy to contract sharply. Equally bad was the conflict\u2019s fiscal impact.\nThe war had saddled Iraq with a staggering $50 billion in foreign debt while wartime\ndamage to oil facilities and a sharp decline in the price of petroleum in the late 1980s\nhad left nominal oil revenue 58 percent lower than it had been a decade earlier. As a\nresult, Baghdad lacked the funds either to service its international debt or to rebuild its\neconomy\u2014a predicament that raised doubts about Husayn\u2019s ability to retain his grip on\npower.81\nConclusion\nUltimately, the Iraqi dictator\u2019s efforts to resolve this dilemma would plunge the\nregion into a new conflict: the Gulf War. Ending in a decisive victory by an American-led\ncoalition, that conflict seemed for a time to have set the stage for a new dawn in the\nMiddle East. Indeed, in its immediate wake, the region appeared to be moving toward a\n78 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 232\u201333.\n79 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 182\u201383.\n80 Axworthy, A History of Iran, 269; Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, 171, 175.\n81 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 248\u201351; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 205. Chapter Seventeen: Transition and Stalemate, 1980-1990 Page 590\nresolution of the many conflicts\u2014new and old\u2014that had marked the region during the\n1980s and, thus, toward a new era of peace and stability. It is to the crisis that\nprecipitated the Gulf War and to the apparent easing of tension that followed its\nconclusion that we shall now turn. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001\nIntroduction\nThe 1990s picked up in the Middle East where the 1980s had left off: with conflict\nand instability endemic to the region. Many of its disputes were longstanding ones. Shi\u02bfi\nIran and Sunni Saudi Arabia persisted in the fierce, Islamic cold war that they had been\nwaging with each other since 1979, jihadism continued to pose a serious threat to\nregimes everywhere in the Middle East, and, most consequentially, Israelis and\nPalestinians remained locked in a bitter, nationalist struggle over the disposition of the\nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip. Not all of the Middle East\u2019s conflicts were old, however.\nMost notably, in August 1990, Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn (r. 1979-2003) precipitated\na destabilizing new crisis that threatened both the regional balance of power and the\nglobal economy when he occupied the oil-rich Emirate of Kuwait.\nJust a few years later, however, the issues and conflicts that lay behind the\nregion\u2019s instability appeared to be resolving. Most obviously, in early 1991, a US-led\ncoalition defeated Saddam Husayn\u2019s vaunted military and ended his efforts to dominate\nthe region. Not long thereafter, Arab states like Egypt succeeded in crushing the jihadi\nthreat while Saudi Arabia and Iran appeared to have negotiated an end to their religious\ncold war. Most startlingly, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Israeli\ngovernment seemed poised to end the region\u2019s most bitter and longstanding struggle\nthrough a negotiated settlement. For a time, as a result, the people of the Middle East\ncautiously dared to hope that they might finally be able to move beyond the struggles\nand disputes that had beset the region since the end of World War I.\nThe Gulf War, 1991\nIn many ways, the Gulf War of 1991 was the defining crisis of the decade in the\nMiddle East. Pitting a coalition of states led by the US against Iraq, this brief conflict\nended in a decisive military victory for America and its allies and appeared, for a time, to\nmark a real turning point for the region. Indeed, with serious efforts coming in its wake\nto resolve longstanding conflicts, the war seemed to mark a watershed event\u2014one that\npresaged the beginning of a new-and-brighter era in the Middle East.\nOrigins\nThe difficult situation that Saddam Husayn found himself in following the Iran-Iraq\nWar (1980-1988) led directly to the crisis. His problems were primarily fiscal in nature,\nand they caught him on the horns of twin dilemmas. First, with the price of oil having\nfallen precipitously in the late 1980s, he had insufficient revenue to service the massive,\n$50 billion foreign debt he had incurred fighting the war with Iran and still provide the\npatronage and welfare benefits needed to keep the Iraqi people quiescent and bound to\nhis regime. Meanwhile, he also lacked the resources either to maintain Iraq\u2019s now-\nmassive 1.3-million-person army or to provide the employment needed to prevent Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 592\ndemobilized soldiers from revolting. These were serious problems for Husayn, and they\nseemed utterly insoluble in light of his Arab creditors\u2019 unwillingness to consider his\nrequest to write off the loans that he had incurred to finance the war with Iran. Indeed,\nabsent a rapid, dramatic change in Iraq\u2019s circumstance, his days as its leader were\nlikely numbered.1\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s huge army may have contributed to the fiscal vise that he\nfound himself in, but it also suggested a way for him to wriggle free. He realized that if\nhe could not persuade his Arab creditors to forgive the loans they had made to Iraq, he\ncould instead use his powerful military to intimidate them into doing so. Accordingly,\nclaiming that he had fought the war with Iran in part to protect Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\nfrom a hostile Tehran, the Iraqi leader mounted a strident diplomatic campaign against\ntheir governments in the spring of 1990\u2014backed by the implicit threat of force\u2014aimed\nat coercing them into recharacterizing the loans they had made to Iraq into grants. He\neven demanded that they provide an additional $30 billion in aid to help rebuild his\ncountry\u2019s devastated economy.2\nAs the price of oil plummeted from $21 per barrel in January 1990 to just $11 per\nbarrel that summer, his rhetoric grew even more heated. He claimed that Kuwait owed\nIraq $2.5 billion for stealing petroleum from the Rumaila oil field by drilling near the\nborder, and he accused it of deliberately pushing the price of oil down by exceeding its\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) quotas. He followed by\ndemanding that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cut production and by stepping up his call for\ndebt relief. Ominously, he asked Egyptian President Husni Mubarak (r. 1981-2011) and\nJordan\u2019s King Hussein (r. 1953-1999) to let the leaders of the Gulf States know \u201c\u2018that if\nthey do not give this money to me, I will know how to get it.\u2019\u201d Still, despite these threats,\nKuwait and Saudi Arabia remained unmoved and refused to restructure Iraq\u2019s debt or to\nprovide reconstruction aid.3\nWith his intimidation campaign having failed, Saddam Husayn began to pursue a\nriskier but potentially more rewarding course of action. At some point in the late spring\nor early summer of 1990, he started to consider using Iraq\u2019s powerful army not to\nintimidate Kuwait but instead to occupy it outright. His thinking here echoed the logic\nthat had informed his decision-making at the start of the Iran-Iraq War. Confident that\nWashington would not act, he believed that the Gulf States would have no choice but to\nseek a negotiated settlement\u2014just as he had expected Tehran to have done in 1980.\nHe would then find himself in the enviable position of being able to choose between two\nappealing options: either annexing the emirate outright or having the Gulf States write\noff Iraq\u2019s debt in exchange for the withdrawal of his army. Either way, having solved\nIraq\u2019s immediate fiscal crisis, Saddam Husayn would not merely have solidified his\ndomestic standing but also finally assumed the dominant position in the Middle East that\n1 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 250\u201352; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 219.\n2 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 220\u201321.\n3 Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 106\u20137; Quote from Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 220\u2013\n21. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 593\nhe had long sought. It seemed to be a golden opportunity\u2014one too good for Husayn to\npass up. Accordingly, in late July, he ordered Iraqi troops to begin massing along the\nKuwaiti border.4\nBy August, Saddam Husayn was ready to pull the trigger. Despite Kuwait\nindicating a willingness to make meaningful concessions at talks hosted by Saudi King\nFahd bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (r. 1982-2005) in Jidda on July 31, he ordered his army to\noccupy the emirate at dawn on August 2. Other than failing to capture the royal family,\nthe invasion was a total success. Facing no meaningful resistance, the Iraqi army\ncrossed the frontier without difficulty and took control of Kuwait and its vital oil fields in a\nsingle day. Saddam Husayn was thrilled at the apparent success of his plan. Indeed, he\nwas so delighted that he cast caution to the wind and announced on August 8 that Iraq\nwas annexing the emirate. In the meantime, satisfied that his control of 20 percent of\nthe globe\u2019s supply of oil gave him real leverage, he ordered his forces to dig in and\nawaited requests to negotiate.5\nOperation Desert Shield\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s confidence was almost comically misplaced. Rather than\nfielding desperate requests to negotiate, he instead faced almost immediate\ncondemnation on all fronts. The United Nations (UN) Security Council moved first.\nPassed on the day of the invasion, Resolution 660 called for Iraq to withdraw\nimmediately and unconditionally from Kuwait. The Arab League followed with its own\nformal denunciation of the invasion a few days later. Most importantly, President\nGeorge H. W. Bush (r. 1989-1993) made clear that the US would not tolerate Iraq\u2019s\noccupation of the emirate. Declaring that \u201c\u2018this will not stand, this aggression against\nKuwait,\u2019\u201d he acted quickly to pressure Saddam Husayn into withdrawing his forces.\nTaking advantage of the mood of international cooperation that accompanied the end of\nthe Cold War, Prsident Bush secured passage on August 6, 1990, of a second UN\nSecurity Council Resolution, number 661, that put teeth into the earlier call for Saddam\nHusayn to withdraw by imposing a tough sanctions regime on Iraq. Enforced by the US\nnavy, it resulted in Iraq\u2019s exports falling by 90 percent and its imports plummeting by\n97 percent.6\nBush also moved swiftly to prevent Saddam Husayn from seizing any more of the\nregion\u2019s oil fields. On the same day that the UN Security Council passed Resolution\n661, he obtained King Fahd\u2019s leave to begin stationing American troops in Saudi Arabia.\nDeployed under the codename Operation Desert Shield, the first contingent of soldiers\narrived in the kingdom the following day. Hundreds of thousands more would follow.7\n4 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 251\u201353.\n5 Rogan, The Arabs, 444\u201345; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 227\u201329.\n6 Quote from Hahn, Crisis and Crossfire, 108; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 252; Marr, The\nModern History of Iraq, 234.\n7 Little, American Orientalism, 256\u201357. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 594\nWhy did Bush react so forcefully to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait? Two considerations\ninformed his actions. First, so long as Saddam Husayn retained possession of Kuwait,\nhe would enjoy a chokehold on the globe\u2019s oil supply and would thus be in a position to\nhold the world economy hostage at his whim. Second, with the Cold War in the process\nof ending, Bush had hoped to establish a \u201c\u2018new world order\u2019\u201d under American leadership\nbased on the Wilsonian principles of collective security, self-determination, and the rule\nof law. In the president\u2019s eyes, Iraq\u2019s occupation of Kuwait amounted to a dangerous\nfrontal assault on that system\u2014one that the US and its allies had to defeat if his vision\nfor the globe was to go into effect.8\nThere followed a period of diplomatic jockeying on the part of both the US and\nIraq. Using a mix of persuasion and the promise of tangible rewards, Bush built a\nmilitary coalition of nearly thirty states that included Britain, France, Morocco, Egypt,\nArgentina, Syria, Senegal, New Zealand, and Egypt and secured the diplomatic support\nof traditional rivals such as the Soviet Union. While the president took a global\napproach, Husayn instead focused narrowly on the Arab world. Seeking to fragment the\ncoalition by peeling off its Arab states, he shrewdly drew attention to the hypocrisy\nevident in the contrast between Washington\u2019s forceful approach to the Kuwait crisis and\nits comparatively kid-glove treatment of Israel\u2019s occupation of the Gaza Strip and West\nBank. He also declared that Iraq was willing to pull out of Kuwait, but only as part of a\nbroader regional settlement in which Israel withdrew from the Occupied Territories and\nSyria departed from Lebanon.9\nThese arguments had little resonance globally, but they struck a chord in the\nArab world. Indeed, demonstrations against participation in Operation Desert Shield\nbroke out in many Arab states\u2014including, notably, countries closely aligned with the US\nsuch as Egypt and Morocco\u2014shortly after Saddam Husayn announced his proposal.\nMeanwhile, drawn to the Iraqi leader\u2019s bellicose rhetoric toward Israel and his\nwillingness to stand up to Washington, the Palestinians demonstrated their support by\norganizing pro-Iraq rallies in the Occupied Territories and Jordan. Here, Yasir Arafat\n(1929-2004) was in the vanguard. Having moved closer to Saddam Husayn following\nthe failure of the PLO\u2019s diplomatic push in the late 1980s, he expressed open and\nenthusiastic support for the Iraqi leader following the occupation of Kuwait\u2014a position\nthat restored his standing among Palestinians disappointed by his inability to turn the\nconcessions he had made in the late 1980s into tangible gains. Thus, Bush\u2019s skillful\ndiplomacy may have gained the support of Arab governments for Operation Desert\nShield and almost assuredly tipped global popular opinion in favor of the US, but\nSaddam Husayn\u2019s successful effort to link the seizure of Kuwait with the Israeli\noccupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank had clearly won the hearts and minds of\nthe vast majority of Arabs.10\n8 George C. Herring, From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776\n(New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 908\u20139.\n9 Little, American Orientalism, 257; Rogan, The Arabs, 450\u201351.\n10 Rogan, The Arabs, 450\u201351. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 595\nOperation Desert Storm\nThe success of Saddam Husayn\u2019s propaganda message deeply troubled\nWashington. If given time, his campaign had the potential to peel off enough Arab states\nto make the effort to stop Iraq politically impossible\u2014thus permitting him to retain\ncontrol of Kuwait. The Bush administration reacted in two ways. First, abandoning the\ndefensive disposition of Desert Shield in favor of an offensive deployment, the president\nannounced in early November that he was doubling the size of the American force in\nSaudi Arabia to over 500,000 personnel\u2014nearly as many as had been deployed to\nSoutheast Asia during the height of the Vietnam War. Second, he secured approval of a\nnew, and more forceful UN resolution designed to ensure that Saddam Husayn did not\nhave the time needed to fracture the coalition. Passed on November 15, Resolution 678\nauthorized the US-led coalition to use \u201c\u2018all necessary means\u2019\u201d to push Iraq out of Kuwait\nif it did not withdraw by January 15, 1991.11\nIn two ways, the resolution trapped the Iraqi leader. First, by leaving insufficient\ntime for him to divide the global community or to hive off some of the Arab states, it\nneutralized his diplomatic strategy. Second, and more important, it confronted the Iraqi\ndictator with an unpalatable choice. If he capitulated and withdrew his forces from the\nemirate, he would be discredited and his emboldened Ba\u02bfth Party subordinates would\nlikely remove him from power; if he instead remained in Kuwait, the powerful US military\nwould surely attack the Iraqi army and force it to retreat.12\nUltimately, Saddam Husayn decided that staying put was the less-risky option.\nAfter all, he reasoned, there was hope that high American casualties might spark such\nintense antiwar protests in the United States that Bush would be forced to call of the\nattack; in contrast, a retreat coming so close on the heels of the disastrous war with Iran\nwould surely precipitate a coup. Accordingly, he ordered his troops to hunker down for\nthe expected assault.13\nCode-named Operation Desert Storm, the war began on January 17, 1991, with\na lengthy aerial campaign by coalition forces designed to soften up Iraq\u2019s defenses. It\nfocused initially on key military and political targets. Coalition planes attacked air\ndefenses, command-and-control installations, intelligence facilities, Ba\u02bfth Party\nheadquarters, and sites suspected of producing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs).\nThe air offensive did not remain confined to such targets for long, however. Instead, it\nsoon expanded to include refineries, power stations, water treatment plants, and other\ncivilian infrastructure.14\nSaddam Husayn knew that he could not hope to compete with the awesome\npower of the American military. At the same time, however, he believed that if he could\n11 Little, American Orientalism, 258; Rogan, The Arabs, 448\u201349.\n12 Herring, From Colony to Superpower, 909\u201310.\n13 Herring, 909\u201310.\n14 Little, American Orientalism, 261. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 596\nchange the terms of the struggle, he might yet be able to emerge from the war\nvictorious. Accordingly, even before the fighting had commenced, he had begun\ndevising a strategy to turn the military contest into a more-complex political one that\nwould, he hoped, shatter Bush\u2019s carefully assembled coalition and thus allow Iraq to\nride out the storm. He put his plan into effect on the second day of the war. On his\norders, the Iraqi military began launching SCUD ground-to-ground missiles at Israel, a\ncountry that Bush had pointedly refrained from asking to join the coalition. Unguided,\nthe rockets Iraq fired at the Jewish state were tactically insignificant. At the same time,\nhowever, they were freighted with potentially explosive political significance. Were Tel\nAviv to reply to them with force in keeping with its Iron Wall ideology, the missile attacks\nwould have folded the Gulf War into the broader Arab-Israeli conflict, and, in so doing,\ncompelled the Arab states to abandon the fight with Saddam Husayn\u2014thus both\nshattering the coalition that Bush had so carefully put together and permitting Iraq to\nretain possession of Kuwait. It was a savvy ploy that suggested a subtle grasp of\nregional political realities.15\nUltimately, however, Saddam Husayn\u2019s gambit did not prove to be effective.\nThrough a combination of heavy diplomatic pressure and the deployment of powerful\nAmerican Patriot anti-missile batteries to Israel, the president succeeded in persuading\nTel Aviv to refrain from taking countermeasures. As a result, the coalition remained\nintact.16\nMeanwhile, the US-led war effort continued. The aerial bombardment of Iraq and\nits military forces that had begun on January 17 continued unabated and largely\nuncontested for six full weeks. Finally, on February 24, the coalition initiated the second\nphase of its war plan: a massive ground attack in Kuwait and southern Iraq. Every bit as\none sided as the aerial campaign that had preceded it, the one-hundred-hour-long\nground assault first drove Husayn\u2019s formations out of Kuwait and then annihilated them\nwhen they tried to retreat back to Iraq on a stretch of road that came to be known as the\n\u201chighway of death.\u201d17\nHaving ejected the Iraqi army from the emirate, the US then faced the tantalizing\nprospects of taking Baghdad and deposing Saddam Husayn. For a time, Bush was\nsorely tempted. Doing so would result in a tidy ending to the war and would permanently\neliminate a dangerous and destabilizing regime. For two reasons, however, the\npresident ultimately opted not to push on to the Iraqi capital. First, he was leery of\ntarnishing America\u2019s great victory by getting bogged down in what he feared might\nbecome a costly quagmire. Second, his administration believed that regional security\nrequired the retention of an Iraqi state sufficiently coherent that it could contain Iran. The\n15 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 101.\n16 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 612.\n17 Herring, From Colony to Superpower, 910\u201311. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 597\npresident consequently refrained from advancing on Baghdad and instead agreed to a\nceasefire on February 28.18\nBush may have been content to leave the Iraqi government in place, but he still\nwished to remove Saddam Husayn from power. Accordingly, in an effort to signal to top-\nranking Ba\u02bfthists that the US would support a leadership change, he indicated on\nMarch 1 that he hoped the Iraqis would \u201c\u2018take matters into their own hands\u2019\u201d and depose\nthe Iraqi leader. In the meantime, ignorant of the 10,000-30,000 Iraqi soldiers killed in\naction and the 2,280 Iraqi civilians who died in the bombing campaign, Americans\ncelebrated a triumph that came at the astonishingly low cost of only 147 US lives.19\nPostwar Uprisings\nBush\u2019s effort to incite a putsch in Baghdad would have important if unintended\nconsequences that took much of the bloom off that victory, however. The president\u2019s\ncall for a change in leadership in Iraq did not produce the intended Ba\u02bfthist coup against\nSaddam Husayn, who retained his grip on power, but instead inspired the outbreak of\nlarge, popular Kurdish and Shi\u02bfi revolts against the regime in March 1991.Those\nrebellions began in the south. On March 1, furious Shi\u02bfi soldiers in Basra attacked\nsymbols of the regime like local Ba\u02bfth Party headquarters and the offices of the security\nservices.\nFrom these modest beginnings, anti-regime activities quickly spread. Within\ndays, all of the Shi\u02bfi-dominated towns and cities in southern Iraq were in open revolt\nagainst Husayn and had forced government troops and officials to withdraw. Meanwhile,\ninspired by news of the Shi\u02bfi rebellion, the Kurds launched their own revolt against the\nBa\u02bfthist state a few days later. Over the ensuing two weeks, they established control of\nIraq\u2019s mountainous north and even occupied the strategic city of Kirkuk. Thus, by mid-\nMarch, Saddam Husayn\u2019s situation looked very grim indeed. With half the country in\nrebellion, his days as Iraq\u2019s leader appeared to be numbered.20\nUnfortunately for the Shi\u02bfa and Kurds, however, the Iraqi president was well\nprepared for their revolts. He had held his elite Republican Guard units in reserve in\nanticipation of unrest, and he wasted little time in unleashing them on the rebels. They\nbegan their counteroffensive in the south. Using indiscriminate force that left tens of\nthousands of civilians dead and that compelled even more to flee, the Republican\nGuard troops quickly crushed the poorly organized Shi\u02bfi revolt. With southern Iraq now\npacified, Saddam Husayn then redeployed his soldiers to the north. Once again using\noverwhelming force, they quickly put down the Kurdish uprising.21\n18 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 104\u20136.\n19 Quote from Hahn, 104\u20139; Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 235\u201339.\n20 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 243\u201345, 248\u201350.\n21 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 255\u201356. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 598\nThe return of government forces created an even bigger panic in the north than it\nhad in the south. Fearing a repeat of the recent al-Anfal campaign, two million Kurds\nresponded to the Iraqi army\u2019s counterattack by fleeing into the mountains\u2014a mass\nmovement that created an immediate and grave humanitarian crisis. Pressure quickly\nmounted on Washington to provide help. In response, President Bush agreed to supply\nassistance through Operation Provide Comfort and to impose a No Fly Zone north of\nthe thirty-sixth parallel that ensured a quick end to the regime\u2019s military operations in\nthat part of the country. Later, in August 1992, the US extended the No Fly Zone to the\nregion south of the thirty-second parallel.22\nWhile the Shi\u02bfa and Kurds endured enormous privation as a result of the\nregime\u2019s efforts to crush their rebellions, they were not the only civilians to suffer\nfollowing the Gulf War. Also experiencing trying times in the wake of the conflict were\nthe Palestinians\u2014in their case, as retribution for the PLO\u2019s rash decision to side with\nSaddam Husayn. That punishment came in several forms. Most obviously, Kuwait\ndeported 300,000 Palestinian guest workers to Jordan in the conflict\u2019s immediate\naftermath. Massively disruptive, this action not only created enormous suffering for the\naffected Palestinians but, by terminating the annual, $400 million flow of remittances\nthat guest workers in Kuwait sent to their families in the Occupied Territories, also\ndeprived the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip of foreign currency and thus\nfurther depressed their perennially weak economy. To top it off, Saudi Arabia and\nKuwait had already suspended their heretofore generous financial support of the PLO in\nresponse to Arafat\u2019s declaration of solidarity with Husayn. The Gulf War was thus as\nmuch a defeat for the Palestinians as it had been for Iraq. Having effectively bet\neverything on Saddam Husayn and lost, they had\u2014at last\u2014seemingly found rock\nbottom.23\nIn contrast, thanks to his army\u2019s success in suppressing the uprisings, Saddam\nHusayn was able to hold on to power despite his phenomenally poor handling of the\nKuwaiti crisis. Still, the war had imposed serious restraints on the Iraqi leader. Passed\non April 12, 1991, UN Security Council Resolution 687 called on Iraq to destroy all\nWMDs and their production facilities and required it to submit to on-site visits by UN\ninspection teams. Until they could verify that Iraq had complied with the resolution, the\nembargo\u2014with limited exemptions for food and medicine\u2014would remain in effect. Thus,\nSaddam Husayn may have retained his grip on power, but, with his army substantially\nweakened by the war and with his WMD program shut down, he was no longer in a\nposition to threaten his neighbors.24\n22 Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, 133; Hahn, Missions\nAccomplished?, 108; Tripp, A History of Iraq, 256\u201358.\n23 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 612\u201313.\n24 Marr, The Modern History of Iraq, 240. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 599\nA New Beginning?\nDespite the failure to remove Saddam Husayn from power, the Gulf War\nappeared for a time to have constituted a vital inflection point for the Middle East\u2014one\nthat had set in motion a series of changes that appeared like they would resolve many\nof the region\u2019s most enduring conflicts. The progress was tangible. The Lebanese civil\nwar came to a conclusion, Mubarak\u2019s government ended the jihadis\u2019 terror campaign in\nEgypt, and Saudi Arabia and Iran began to engage in talks aimed at achieving d\u00e9tente\nin the religious cold war they had been waging against each other since 1979. Most\nimportantly, the PLO and Israel entered into peace talks that seemed to be leading to a\ngenuine resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Accordingly, hopes rose that the Middle\nEast\u2014a region that had been beset by so much strife since the West had bequeathed\nto it a modern state system just after World War I\u2014was finally entering an era of peace\nand stability.\nLebanon: The Taif Accord\nThe conclusion of the Lebanese Civil War in the early 1990s was the first\nindication that the Middle East might be entering a more hopeful period. Ironically, the\nstrife that had bedeviled Lebanon since 1975 only came to an end after the country had\nfirst slid yet further into chaos during the selection of a new president in 1988. Already a\npersistent source of conflict, the choice of a new head of state was even more fraught\nthan usual that year owing to the ongoing civil war. Thanks to that conflict, the country\nhad been unable to hold parliamentary elections since 1972 and many legislators were\neither dead or living abroad; unable to muster quorum as a result, parliament lacked the\nlegal standing to select a new president. In such situations, the constitution assigned\nthe powers of the president to the sitting prime minister until a new election could be\nheld\u2014meaning, in this case, that the Syrian-backed Sunni prime minister, Selim al-Hoss\n(1929- ), stood poised to serve as Lebanon\u2019s interim chief executive.25\nThis situation deeply alarmed the Maronite head of the army, Michel Aoun\n(1933- ). Fearing that al-Hoss might dismantle the confessional system that guaranteed\nChristians a substantial share of political power, he established a rival interim\ngovernment. Receiving arms shipments from Iraq, Aoun was well positioned to assert\nhis claim to power. In fact, he even felt strong enough to start a war with Syria in March\n1989 aimed at liberating the country from Asad\u2019s control. The result was six months of\nintense-but-inconclusive fighting that solved nothing even as it further immiserated the\npeople of Lebanon and forced tens of thousands more to flee the country.26\nThe significant civilian death toll horrified people in the Arab world and created\npressure for a political settlement. Accordingly, at the behest of the Arab League, Saudi\nKing Fahd, the Algerian president, and the Moroccan king began working in the spring\nof 1989 to secure a diplomatic solution to the conflict that would be acceptable to all\n25 Rogan, The Arabs, 458\u201359.\n26 Rogan, 458\u201359. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 600\nparties. Though the going was tough, they succeeded in getting the different factions to\nagree to a ceasefire and in arranging for the Lebanese parliament to convene in Taif,\nSaudi Arabia in the fall of 1989 for the purpose of arriving at a final resolution of the civil\nwar. Sixty-two members of parliament\u2014now a full seventeen years into their terms\u2014\ntook part in the talks.27\nThe resulting Taif Accord promised to restore peace to a land riven by years of\nfactional infighting. The agreement retained the distribution of offices along confessional\nlines that dated to the National Pact of 1943 and, bowing to reality, acknowledged\nSyria\u2019s dominant position in Lebanon. Importantly, however, it also replaced the earlier\npractice of reserving six parliamentary seats for the Christians for every five held by\nMuslims with a new arrangement that accorded each faith an equal number of deputies.\nIt also shifted substantial power from the Maronite president to the Sunni prime minister.\nCarefully negotiated, the Taif Accord received nearly unanimous acceptance in\nLebanon; critically, however, Aoun and his Iraqi-armed militia continued to oppose the\ndeal. Though tantalizingly close, in other words, Lebanon was still not yet free of the\ncivil war that was entering its fifteenth year.28\nIt was at this point that the Gulf conflict helped to finally bring the Lebanese Civil\nWar to an end. Bush needed Syria\u2019s participation in the coalition against Iraq in order to\ncounter Saddam Husayn\u2019s argument that the American-led effort was a case of modern-\nday imperialism; deftly taking advantage, Asad made clear that his price was a free\nhand in Lebanon. Accordingly, compelled to prioritize the effort to eject Iraq from\nKuwait, the Bush administration gave its tacit sanction to a major Syrian offensive in\nLebanon that began in October 1990. The resulting campaign ended in a decisive\nvictory for Asad\u2019s troops. With the UN embargo on Iraq preventing Aoun\u2019s forces from\nreceiving further weapons and ammunition, the Syrian military handily defeated his\nChristian militia and swiftly reunited the country under a government based on the\narrangement that had been negotiated in Taif. Damascus followed by compelling all the\nmilitias to disarm and disband\u2014a move that ensured that peace would endure. The only\nexception was Iran\u2019s powerful prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Lebanon, Hizbollah, which was permitted to\ncontinue its increasingly sophisticated insurgency against Israeli forces in the security\nzone that the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) maintained in southern Lebanon.

Frosty since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, relations\nbetween the two countries had deteriorated considerably in the mid 1980s.

Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 601\nworsening the climate between them had been the Bloody Friday clash between Iranian\npilgrims and Saudi security forces during the hajj in 1987 that had resulted in the deaths\nof four-hundred people. As we have seen, Riyadh had followed that incident by breaking\nrelations with Tehran and by increasing its financial support for the Iraqi war effort, while\nIran had responded by urging Muslims to go to war with the Saudis and by threatening\nto attack countries that supported Iraq.30\nTwo developments made possible the start of a rapprochement in 1990. First,\nIran had recently experienced an important change in leadership. Following the\nAyatollah Khomeini\u2019s death (1902-1989) in 1989, the Iranian president, Ayatollah Ali\nKhamenei (1939- ), became Supreme Leader while the relatively pragmatic Ayatollah\nAli Akbar Rafsanjani (r. 1989-1997) succeeded to the presidency. Though they largely\nshared Khomeini\u2019s values, these men were considerably more flexible and willing to\ncompromise and were thus open to a deal with the Saudis. Second, Saddam Husayn\u2019s\ninvasion of Kuwait had scrambled the regional balance of forces and turned Iraq, the\ncountry Riyadh had heretofore relied upon to contain Iran, into a dangerous enemy.\nFeeling enormously vulnerable as a result of this sudden shift, the Saudis were now\nwilling to consider sweeping foreign-policy changes that would have been off the table\neven just a few months earlier.31\nBoth states saw much to gain from improved relations. Concerned about the\nthreat that Iraq had become, the Saudi government now perceived Iran as a potential\npartner in the containment of Saddam Husayn. Meanwhile, Tehran wanted to increase\nthe number of Iranians who could participate in the hajj and hoped to raise its OPEC\nallotment so that it could generate the funds desperately needed to reconstruct its war-\nshattered economy. Accordingly, the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers began to hold\nmeetings in New York in early 1991 designed to lay the groundwork for a lasting\nd\u00e9tente. That effort bore fruit in March 1991 when they jointly announced that their\ncountries would be resuming diplomatic relations and that Saudi Arabia was more than\ndoubling the number of Iranians who could participate in the hajj. Thus, with their shared\nfear of Iraq having cut the Gordian Knot, the two bitter rivals appeared at last to have\nabandoned the Islamic cold war that they had been waging since the Iranian Revolution\nin favor of a new relationship based on cooperation.32\nThe Saudi response to a terror attack in the kingdom made clear just how\ndurable the rapprochement with Iran was. In June 1996, militants detonated a massive\ntruck bomb in front of an eight-story building that was part of the al-Khobar Towers\ndevelopment, a residential complex in which American service personnel stationed in\nthe Kingdom were housed. Shearing off the entire face of the building, the huge\nexplosion killed nineteen Americans and wounded another four hundred. While\nsuspicion initially fell on former Service Bureau head Osama bin Laden (1957-2011),\nthe US soon uncovered evidence indicating that the perpetrators were in fact members\n30 Ghattas, Black Wave, 163.\n31 Ghattas, 181\u201382.\n32 Ghattas, 208\u201310. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 602\nof a shadowy, Iran-linked Shi\u02bfi terrorist group known as Hizbollah al-Hejaz. The\nrevelation of this evidence was shocking, but it did not lead Riyadh to break relations or\neven to censure Iran. Instead, fearing that criticism might weaken the position of the\nIranian moderates they had been courting and thus imperil the five-year-old\nrapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran, Saudi officials chose to keep mum.33\nJihadism Contained\nIn the wake of the Gulf War, even the jihadi threat appeared to be on the wane.\nIndeed, the 1990s would prove to be a tough decade for the militant Islamists.\nThroughout the Middle East, the organizations that had arisen in the late 1970s and\nearly 1980s suffered significant defeats in the mid 1990s at the hands of the \u201c\u2018near\nenemy\u2019\u201d: the secular regimes in the region whose downfall they hoped to achieve. Egypt\nwas a case in point. There, the terror campaign that Ayman Zawahiri\u2019s (1951-2022)\nIslamic Jihad and the blind sheikh Omar abdel Rahman\u2019s (1938-2017) Gamaat Islamiya\nhad launched in 1992 to overthrow the government had gone so badly that the jihadis\nfelt compelled to issue a unilateral ceasefire in 1997. What explained their lack of\nsuccess? Why had their effort failed so quickly and so totally?34\nTwo issues undid the jihadis\u2019 campaign in Egypt. First, the brutal terror attacks\nthey launched alienated ordinary Egyptians. Two incidents in particular turned public\nopinion against the militant Islamists. One was a failed car-bomb attack on the prime\nminister in 1993 that wounded twenty-one bystanders and killed a schoolgirl, Shayma\nAbdel-Halim. Angry at Islamic Jihad for its callousness, the huge crowd that turned out\nat her funeral vented their fury at the militants by chanting \u201c\u2018[t]errorism is the enemy of\nGod!\u2019\u201d The other occurred four years later. On November 17, 1997, Gamaat Islamiya\ngunmen disguised as police officers entered the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor and\nsystematically murdered four Egyptians and fifty-eight tourists including a five-year-old\ngirl and four Japanese newlywed couples. The incident did not go over well in Egypt.\nThe savagery of the attack, the resulting collapse in the country\u2019s economically critical\ntourism industry, and the attendant job losses infuriated the Egyptian people and cost\nthe jihadis what little support they had managed to retain.35\nSecond, Mubarak\u2019s state security succeeded in grievously weakening Islamic\nJihad and Gamaat Islamiya through a ruthless and highly effective crackdown in the mid\n1990s that involved mass arrests and the demoralizing harassment of the jihadis\u2019 wives.\nThe incompetence of Islamic Jihad\u2019s leadership greatly aided the government in this\neffort. While the organization had adopted a cell structure so that an arrested member\ncould only disclose the names of a handful of associates\u2014a standard practice in\ninsurgent and terrorist groups stretching back at least to the nineteenth century\u2014its\nmembership director had inexplicably maintained a database with the names,\naddresses, aliases, and hideouts of the entire organization\u2019s membership; as a result,\n33 Ghattas, 210\u201311.\n34 Gerges, The Far Enemy, 9\u201311, 44, 151\u201353.\n35 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 210\u201311, 290\u201393. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 603\nstate security forces were able to arrest some eight-hundred members\u2014nearly\neveryone who belonged to Islamic Jihad\u2014in a single, coordinated operation.\nKneecapped in this way, the organization was unable to recover and drifted off into\nirrelevance. Thus, while non-violent Islamist groups continued to make gains in Egypt,\nthe jihadis had been reduced to irrelevance, crushed by Mubarak\u2019s effective security\nservices.36\nThe Peace Process, 1991-1995\nPerhaps the clearest sign that the Middle East was in the process of putting the\nstrife of the twentieth century behind it was the opening of a dialogue between Israel\nand the PLO aimed at finally ending the region\u2019s most enduring conflict. Like the Saudi-\nIranian rapprochement and the end of the Lebanese Civil War, the peace process had\nits roots in the Gulf War. Stung by Saddam Husayn\u2019s accusation of hypocrisy, President\nBush opted to use some of the substantial political capital he had gained from his\nvictory to convene a conference aimed at finally resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict on the\nbasis of Resolution 242. Though the resulting negotiations did not follow the path that\nthe president had laid out, they nonetheless produced tangible progress and raised\nhopes that the long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians was at last coming to an\nend.\nThe Madrid Conference\nGetting all of the relevant parties to agree to meet was a tall order. Particularly\nproblematic were Israel and Syria, which, for very different reasons, did not want to take\npart. For Asad, the issue was Lebanon. Fearful that the talks might put pressure on\nSyria to cede the position he had so carefully constructed in that country, he resisted\nefforts to compel his government to attend. Meanwhile, outright opposed to the idea of\nengaging in talks based on Resolution 242\u2019s call for the exchange of land for peace,\nPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir\u2019s (r. 1986-1992) Likud government waged a bitter\ncampaign to avoid participating.37\nThanks to the end of the Cold War, however, both Israel and Syria were\npeculiarly susceptible at that time to American pressure. Bereft of Soviet diplomatic\nsupport and military aid, Syria had become thoroughly isolated and thus vulnerable over\nthe prior few years. Israel was in an even more exposed situation. In a stark reversal of\nlongstanding policy, Moscow had recently agreed to permit hundreds of thousands of\nRussian Jews to emigrate to Israel. This dramatic change in Soviet policy delighted Tel\nAviv, but it also required the Jewish state to undertake a crash housing-construction\nprogram\u2014one that could only be financed with an American loan guarantee. Bush deftly\nexploited these weaknesses to compel the two countries to come to Madrid. Taking\nadvantage of Syria\u2019s diplomatic isolation, he first strongarmed Damascus into\nparticipating in the conference. Then, making clear that the US would only provide\n36 Wright, 209\u201311.\n37 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 502. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 604\nfinancial underwriting for the Israeli housing loan if Tel Aviv took part, he followed by\nforcing Shamir to capitulate and agree to send a delegation.38\nIn contrast, the PLO did not enjoy formal representation at the talks in Madrid. Its\nabsence was a function of Arafat\u2019s ill-fated decision to back the wrong horse in the Gulf\nWar. Angry at the Palestinian leader for this move, Bush acted to punish him by refusing\nto permit the PLO to take part in the conference. It is important to note, however, that\nthe president\u2019s ban was only a partial one. Thanks to the organization\u2019s loose affiliation\nwith a group of Palestinians from the territories who were participating in the conference\nas members of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, the PLO did have a voice in the\nproceedings\u2014albeit an indirect one.39\nOpening in Madrid to great anticipation on October 30, 1991, the conference did\nnot prove fruitful. Instead, under the glare of intense press coverage, the discussions\nquickly deadlocked. The Palestinians insisted on nothing less than full, uninhibited self-\ndetermination and the establishment of an independent state in the West Bank and\nGaza Strip. Firmly opposed to ceding any of the land acquired in 1967, the Shamir\ngovernment rejected this position out of hand and countered with an offer of autonomy\nfor the Palestinian people on land that remained under Israeli control\u2014a proposal that\nwas utterly unacceptable to the Palestinians. As a result, the conference failed to\nproduce the hoped-for breakthrough. Still, the talks marked an important milestone. Not\nonly were the Palestinians and Israelis negotiating directly for the first time, but they\nwere doing so on the basis of Resolution 242 and its call for the exchange of land for\nrecognition.40\nOslo I Agreement, September 1993\nWhile the public nature of the Madrid conference prevented the two sides from\nmaking progress in the formal talks, a separate, secret negotiating track in Oslo,\nNorway that began in December 1992 under Norwegian auspices soon showed\npromise. For different reasons, both sides had become more open to negotiations by\nthat point. While still wary of the PLO, newly elected Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak\nRabin (r. 1974-1977, 1992-1995) was interested in ending the costly occupation of the\nterritories and was increasingly prepared to make real concessions to do so;\naccordingly, he authorized two Israeli academics to take part. Meanwhile, having\nsteadily shed supporters to Hamas, Arafat, too, was willing to compromise and agreed\nto send the treasurer of the PLO, Ahmad Quray\u2018 (1938-2023), to participate in the\ndiscussions. Conducted without pressure because of their informal nature, the talks\nsoon produced real progress toward a final settlement of the century-old conflict over\nPalestine. As a result, in August 1993, a shocked and delighted world learned that\n38 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 431.\n39 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 501\u20134.\n40 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 432\u201333. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 605\nIsraeli and Palestinian negotiators had secretly produced a draft of a comprehensive\nsettlement.41\nKnown as the Oslo I Accord, the agreement had two components. The first was\nan exchange of letters of mutual recognition on September 9,1993. Signed four days\nlater on the White House lawn and consummated by an awkward handshake between\nArafat and Rabin, the second component, the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-\nGovernment Arrangements, outlined the phased devolution of power in the Occupied\nTerritories from Israel to a provisional Palestinian government over a period of five\nyears on the basis of Resolution 242. It called for the PLO to first assume control of the\nWest Bank-town of Jericho and the entirety of the Gaza Strip; in later phases, Israel\nwould cede authority over health, welfare, taxes, education, and internal security in the\nrest of the West Bank to an elected Palestinian Council and would gradually withdraw\nits police and military forces from populated areas. Tel Aviv would retain control of\nexternal defense and foreign affairs as well as the security of the Jewish settlements\nuntil the two sides concluded a final agreement at the end of the five-year period.\nImportantly, both parties agreed to defer discussion of contentious topics such as\nborders, the right of refugees to return to their homes, settlements, Jerusalem, and,\nabove all, the Temple Mount until final status negotiations took place in hopes that the\nsuccess of the phased approach would build the trust needed to resolve those thorny\nissues.42\nThe Oslo I Accord marked a dramatic change in the Israeli-Palestinian\nrelationship\u2014one that suddenly made possible a number of important breakthroughs.\nSubstantially weakening the rationale for the Arab states\u2019 continued rejection of Israel\u2019s\nlegitimacy, for example, it permitted Israel to normalize relations with Jordan and to\nopen liaison offices in Morocco and Tunisia. More dramatically, the agreement allowed\nArafat to establish a government in the Occupied Territories, and it secured for the first\ntime Tel Aviv\u2019s acknowledgement that the Palestinians constituted a people. 43\nAt the same time, however, the accord also generated fierce opposition.\nRejectionist Palestinians howled that Arafat had rashly squandered the PLO\u2019s strongest\ncard\u2014recognition of Israel\u2014by failing to secure the formal acceptance of a Palestinian\nstate in return. They also complained that the deal was impossibly vague and noted that\nit did not ban further settlement construction. Many Israelis expressed similar disdain for\nthe accord. Some questioned Arafat\u2019s commitment to peace and wondered whether the\ndeal imperiled the Jewish state\u2019s security. Others\u2014particularly militant members of the\nsettlement movement\u2014protested the very notion of ceding any land whatsoever to the\nPalestinians. One of them, the American-born Baruch Goldstein (1956-1994), took\nmatters into his own hands. Seeking to derail further progress, he murdered twenty-nine\nMuslims while they prayed in the Mosque of Abraham in February 1994 before some of\n41 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 196\u201397; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 530\u2013\n34.\n42 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 534\u201338.\n43 Shlaim, 546\u201347, 556\u201365, 600. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 606\nthe survivors managed to beat him to death. Likewise opposed to a compromise\nsettlement, Hamas responded with a pair of deadly suicide bombings aimed nominally\nat achieving retaliation but really at undermining the trust on which future progress\ndepended.44\nOslo II, September 1995\nWhile the violence succeeded in temporarily halting talks and in pushing back the\ntimeline that Israel and the PLO had agreed to in 1993, it failed to prevent further\nnegotiations. Conducted in secret, those talks soon produced a new agreement. Signed\nby Arafat and Rabin in Washington in September 1995, the Israeli-Palestinian Interim\nAgreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip\u2014known colloquially as the Oslo II\nAccord\u2014laid out the next steps in the peace process. It articulated the powers that\nArafat\u2019s government would exercise, scheduled elections for the Palestinian Council\nand presidency, provided for the establishment of routes connecting the Gaza Strip to\nthe West Bank, and authorized the creation of a Palestinian seaport. It also permitted\nTel Aviv to construct a network of bypass roads linking the West Bank settlements with\neach other and with Israel proper. Meanwhile, of great symbolic importance, it called for\nthe Palestinian Council to formally strike language from the Palestinian National Charter\ncalling for Israel\u2019s destruction.45\nFinally, it divided the West Bank into three zones\u2014the A, B, and C Areas\u2014for\nthe purpose of establishing where, when, and to what extent the Palestinian Council\nwould exercise authority. Constituting 4 percent of the territory, the A Areas included the\nmain Palestinian population centers of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Qalqilya,\nTulkarm, and Hebron and would, by the terms of the interim agreement, fall under\nimmediate Palestinian control. Consisting of smaller Palestinian villages, the 25 percent\nof the West Bank that comprised the B Areas would occupy an interim position. They\nwould come under immediate Palestine Council civil authority while Israel continued to\nretain responsibility for security. Finally, the settlements, military bases, and unoccupied\nland that made up the balance of the West Bank constituted the C Areas and would\nremain under Tel Aviv\u2019s control pending final status negotiations. Importantly, this\ndivision of the West Bank was dynamic. That is, it called for the C Areas to gradually\nshrink as Israel withdrew its forces and ceded responsibility for that land to Palestinian\ncivil control.46\nThe Oslo II Accord began to go into effect almost immediately after Arafat and\nRabin signed it. Palestinian police replaced Israeli security forces in the main\nPalestinian towns in the fall of 1995 save for Hebron, for which the agreement had\nstipulated a later withdrawal date, and elections went off as scheduled in January 1996.\nPredictably, Arafat handily won the presidency, and PLO candidates swept a solid\nmajority of seats on the council. In April 1996, the new government followed by voting to\n44 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 451\u201361.\n45 Smith, 461\u201363.\n46 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 545\u201346. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 607\ndelete the language in the Palestinian National Charter that called for Israel\u2019s\ndestruction. These were welcome steps and, collectively, they appeared to constitute a\nwatershed moment. Indeed, to many observers, it seemed that the main source of\ninstability and conflict in the Middle East was finally coming to an end\u2014a change that\nsuggested that the region as a whole was at last poised to enter a new era of peace and\nstability.47\nA Return to Conflict\nSuch sentiments proved to be sadly misplaced. Starting in the mid 1990s,\nconflicts that had appeared to be winding down instead suddenly roared back to life. In\nthe Gulf region, American efforts to contain both Iran and Iraq produced steadily rising\ntensions thanks to Baghdad\u2019s increasingly assertive resistance. In the Occupied\nTerritories, meanwhile, the effort to establish a just and lasting peace between Israel\nand the Palestinians collapsed amid growing violence and mutual recriminations.\nFinally, even as the jihadis faced defeat at the hands of the \u201c\u2018near enemy,\u2019\u201d a new\nstruggle pitting transnational jihadis against the \u201c\u2018far enemy\u2019\u201d\u2014the United States\u2014\nbegan to take shape. As a result, hopes that the people of the region were finally\nmoving beyond the conflicts that had dominated the twentieth century gradually and\npainfully evaporated.48\nThe Failure of the Oslo Accords, 1995-2000\nPerhaps the biggest setback was the collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian peace\nprocess. Begun with such high hopes, it started to come apart just a few months after\nthe signing of the Oslo II Accord. It did so thanks to the determined opposition of\nextremist groups on both sides. Unwilling to accept anything less than a total victory,\nrightwing Israelis and Hamas militants waged parallel terrorist campaigns to prevent the\nachievement of a final negotiated settlement. That strategy began to gain traction in\nNovember 1995, when a young Israeli named Yigal Amir (1970- ) assassinated Prime\nMinister Rabin just after the latter had spoken at a peace rally in Tel Aviv. A messianic\nZionist, Amir shared the belief of many on Israel\u2019s religious right that God, Himself had\nmade possible the conquest of the West Bank and that, by extension, ceding any of it\namounted not merely to treason but to outright apostasy\u2014a crime, in Amir\u2019s eyes, that\nwas justly punishable by death. Hamas was not to be outdone. It moved to undermine\nthe faltering trust on which the peace process rested by launching a wave of suicide\nbombings in February and March 1996 that killed sixty Israelis. The attacks had the\ndesired effect. They not only furthered frayed the mutual confidence that had made\npeace talks possible, but, more importantly, helped tip the Israeli election held in May\n1996 in favor of the Likud candidate for prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu (r. 1996-\n47 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 629.\n48 Gerges, The Far Enemy, 10\u201311. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 608\n1999, 2009-2021, 2023- ), who narrowly defeated Labor\u2019s Shimon Peres (r. 1977, 1984-\n1986, 1995-1996).49\nIn retrospect, Rabin\u2019s death marked a clear turning point in the Oslo process.\nWhile he had been a tough negotiator and had expressed doubts about the\nestablishment of a Palestinian state, he had also approached the talks with a pragmatic\noutlook and a willingness to compromise. Netanyahu, in contrast, showed no such\nflexibility. On the contrary, he was militantly opposed to any further progress on the\npeace process and was absolutely dead set against the creation of a Palestinian state.50\nIndeed, Netanyahu\u2019s election amounted to putting the fox in charge of the hen\nhouse\u2014a reality made emphatically clear in a formal statement of policy that his\ngovernment released a few weeks after the election. Called the \u201c\u2018Basic Guidelines,\u2019\u201d it\nexplicitly rejected the possibility of a Palestinian state, declared that Israeli control of\nJerusalem was \u201c\u2018nonnegotiable,\u2019\u201d and called for a dramatic expansion in the number of\nsettlements in the Occupied Territories. Netanyahu further hindered progress by\ndragging his feet in implementing many provisions in the Oslo II Accord\u2014including\nwithdrawal from Hebron and the phased handover of C Areas\u2014and by making clear\nthat he had no intention of engaging in final-status negotiations. Pressure from the\nadministration of President Bill Clinton (r. 1993-2001) did belatedly force Netanyahu to\nhand over Hebron and to promise to agree to the Wye River Memorandum in October\n1998, which committed Israel to make further withdrawals from C Areas. Thanks to\nintense opposition from rightwing cabinet members, however, the prime minister\nreneged on that pledge just weeks after he had made it.51\nNetanyahu\u2019s efforts to sabotage the negotiations contributed to a precipitous\ndecline in the Palestinians\u2019 confidence in the peace process. This change marked a\nsubstantial turnabout in Palestinian attitudes. Initially, they had greeted news of the talks\nbetween the PLO and the Israeli government with great anticipation. The announcement\nof the Oslo Accords had raised hopes not only that they soon would be citizens of a\nPalestinian state but that they would also experience greater freedom as the\nnegotiations gradually unfolded. The peace process had not met those expectations,\nhowever. Instead, rather than enjoying improved conditions, the Palestinians confronted\nstepped-up harassment and a steadily rising Israeli presence\u2014particularly in the West\nBank.52\nTwo issues in particular rankled Palestinians who lived there. First, thanks to the\nIsraeli government\u2019s aggressive construction of new settlements, the settler population\ndoubled between 1993 and 2000\u2014a trend hardly suggestive of the idea that the\nPalestinians would soon have their own state or that they would ever be free from Israeli\nrepression. Second, the construction of Israeli-only bypass roads that the Oslo II Accord\n49 Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 566\u201372, 571, 582\u201384.\n50 Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 470.\n51 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 640\u201349.\n52 Gelvin, The Israel-Palestine Conflict, 238\u201339. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 609\nhad permitted had not only resulted in the expropriation of Arab land but also in the\nfurther fragmentation of the West Bank. This last trend was ominous in the eyes of the\nPalestinians. Increasingly, they concluded from it that the Israelis had not taken part in\nthe peace process with the intention of arriving at a compromise agreement but had\ninstead done so for the purpose of dividing the Palestinians of the West Bank into a\nseries of isolated, more easily controlled enclaves. The concurrent establishment of\nIsraeli checkpoints outside the Palestinian population centers powerfully reinforced this\nconclusion. Prior to the Oslo Accords, the Palestinians of the West Bank had suffered\nunder Israeli rule but had at least enjoyed unhindered freedom of movement within the\nterritory; now, as a result of the checkpoints, they had to endure lengthy waits and\nsearches if they wished to travel even short distances. These changes were dispiriting,\nand they soured growing numbers of Palestinians not only toward the peace process\nbut also toward Arafat and the PLO.53\nThe prospects for continued progress were little better on the Israeli side. It is\ntrue that the collapse of Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet and the election of a Labor government\nunder Ehud Barak (r. 1999-2001) in May 1999 had briefly renewed hopes that Israel\nmight make further concessions. However, Barak\u2019s political support had rapidly\nevaporated as a result of domestic political problems and Israel\u2019s botched withdrawal\nfrom southern Lebanon in the spring of 2000\u2014a situation that left the Likud Party poised\nto retake control of the government. In response, President Clinton decided to take a\nbold and risky step designed to breathe life into the faltering peace process. Looking to\ncement his legacy, he invited Barak and Arafat to a summit at Camp David in July 2000\nin hopes that he could broker a deal that was acceptable to both parties.54\nThe summit saw real breakthroughs on some issues, but ultimately ended in\nfailure and mutual recriminations. True to expectations, Barak showed vastly greater\nflexibility than had Netanyahu. At one point, he even proposed ceding 91 percent of the\nWest Bank to the Palestinians\u2014by far the most generous proposal that Israel had yet\nmade. Substantial as that offer may have been, however, it nonetheless included\nprovisions that were unacceptable to the Palestinians. It would have permitted Israel to\nretain permanent possession of the Jordan River Valley and to maintain final say over\nthe disposition of the West Bank\u2019s finite water resources. Most importantly, if\nimplemented, Barak\u2019s proposal would have left the Palestinians with non-contiguous\nterritories, meaning that they would have had to endure the hated Israeli checkpoints in\nperpetuity.\nThese issues notwithstanding, it is entirely likely that the two sides might have\nfound common ground had they had the opportunity to complete the necessary\npreparatory work of narrowing differences over difficult issues and of establishing\ncommon frames of reference in the months leading up to the meeting. After all, the\n53 Khalidi, The Iron Cage, 199\u2013203.\n54 Clinton, of course, also wanted to secure a deal before his term expired.

Barak\u2019s tenuous political\nposition in the summer of 2000 denied them the luxury of being able to engage in\npreliminary talks, however; accordingly, the attendees were compelled to make snap\ndecisions in the hothouse atmosphere of a summit meeting\u2014a circumstance that was\nhardly conducive to compromise or a willingness to make substantial concessions.\nThus, though intended to achieve a breakthrough, the talks instead served only to\nfurther frustrate the Israelis and to embitter and disillusion the Palestinians\u2014particularly\nafter Barak and Clinton unfairly blamed Arafat for the meeting\u2019s failure.55\nHaving had their expectations once more raised, the Palestinians greeted the\ncollapse of the Camp David summit with anger and frustration. Where, they asked, was\nthe independence that they had been promised? Where was the freedom from\nharassment that they had come to expect? Coming as it did after seven years of peace\ntalks, it was an infuriating moment for the Palestinians\u2014one that left the Occupied\nTerritories poised to explode.56\nThe spark that ignited them came in the form of a visit by Likud Party leader Ariel\nSharon (r. 2001-2006) in September 2000 to what is surely the most contested piece of\nreal estate on Earth: the hill that Jewish people refer to as the Temple Mount and that\nMuslims know as the Haram al-Sharif. Accompanied by a phalanx of security personnel,\nSharon made his appearance to assert Israel\u2019s claim to the site and to embarrass and\nweaken Barak, against whom he was then running for prime minister. Deliberately\nprovocative, his action was the final straw for the Palestinians. Already seething over\nthe failure of the Oslo process to meet the expectations it had raised, they responded by\nlaunching a new, unplanned uprising known as the Second Intifada.57\nIt began the day after Sharon\u2019s visit. Muslims leaving the Haram al-Sharif after\nFriday prayers spontaneously protested his provocative move by rioting and throwing\nrocks at the police. Israeli security forces escalated the situation by responding with\noverwhelming force including live fire that killed four Palestinians and wounded another\none hundred. From that point, the riots quickly got out of hand. Drawing inspiration from\nthe recent success of Hizbullah guerrillas against the IDF in Lebanon, the Palestinians\nsought to use mass, populist violence to compel the Israelis to unilaterally cede the\nentirety of the territories. The Second Intifada failed to attain that goal, however;\ninstead, the rioting and the forceful Israeli response merely served to destroy the few\nlingering shreds of trust on which the negotiations of the prior seven years had rested\u2014\nespecially after Sharon won election as prime minister in February 2001. In this way,\n55 Douglas Little, Us versus Them: The United States, Radical Islam, and the Rise of the\nGreen Threat (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2016), 115\u201318; Khalidi,\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 211.\n56 Rashid Khalidi, Brokers of Deceit: How the U.S. Has Undermined Peace in the Middle\nEast (Boston: Beacon Press, 2013), 38.\n57 Morris, Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1920, 660\u201362. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 611\nweakened by the deliberate actions of hardliners on both sides, the peace process that\nfor a time had seemed so promising came to a bitter and ignominious end.58\nHistorical Disagreements: The Oslo Accords\nUnsurprisingly in light of the intense feelings that have long surrounded the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, scholars began offering sharply differing interpretations of the\nOslo Accords almost from the moment that Arafat and Rabin signed the first agreement\nin 1993. Some historians cast the negotiations in a largely positive light. While\nacknowledging the peace process\u2019s obvious limitations and eventual failure, they argue\nthat it constituted a major step toward the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian struggle.\nFor example, the historian Kirsten Schulze contends that the Oslo I Accord \u201cwas of\nhistoric significance\u201d because it involved each party recognizing that the other was a\nlegitimate nation and that they could together arrive at a solution to the long-standing\ncrisis. Avi Shlaim also takes a positive view of the first accord. He contends that the\ntalks in Norway constituted a genuine \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and that Israel\u2019s willingness to\nnegotiate with the PLO amounted to \u201ca diplomatic revolution.\u201d Above all, he maintains\nthat the shift from the mutual denial of each other\u2019s \u201cright to self-determination\u201d to a\nshared acceptance that each side had a legitimate claim to part of the territory\nconstituted a change of such consequence as to render the Oslo Accords worthy of the\n\u201cepithet \u2018historic.\u2019\u201d59\nThis view does not represent a consensus of scholars, however. On the contrary,\nnoting that the agreements offered few real concessions to the Palestinians, many\nhistorians vehemently dispute the idea that the Oslo Accords marked a substantial step\ntoward peace. Writing shortly after the signing of the first agreement, for example, the\nbrilliant and influential Palestinian-American academic Edward Said denounced the deal\nas a poorly negotiated \u201c\u2018Palestinian Versailles\u2019\u201d that conceded control of the West Bank\nto Israel in exchange for what amounted to a highly constrained form of autonomy. More\nrecently, the historian Ussama Makdisi has extended Said\u2019s critique. He maintains that\nthe Oslo Accords\u2019 failure to achieve the removal of Israeli settlements or to explicitly\nendorse the establishment of a Palestinian state rendered the agreements painfully one\nsided. Indeed, he concludes that the accords left the Palestinians with essentially the\nsame limited autonomy arrangement that Begin had offered in 1978\u2014save that Arafat\u2019s\npseudo-government now had the added responsibility of helping to ensure Israel\u2019s\nsecurity.60\nThe historian Rashid Khalidi offers perhaps the most damning indictment of the\npeace process. He argues that the Oslo Accords were a disaster for the Palestinians in\nevery regard and that they made a just settlement of the ongoing conflict more rather\n58 Schulze, The Arab-Israeli Conflict, 83\u201384.\n59 Schulze, 79; Shlaim, The Iron Wall, 530, 536\u201337 Note, though, that Shlaim did not\nperceive the Oslo Accords to be as pathbreaking in the revised edition of The Iron Wall\npublished in 2014 as he did in the first edition published in 2000.\n60 Said quoted in Makdisi, Faith Misplaced, 342\u201344. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 612\nthan less difficult. In his eyes, the agreements were completely one-sided and secured\nfor the Palestinians no more than \u201ca highly restricted form of self-rule in a fragment of\nthe Occupied Territories\u201d\u2014an arrangement that merely served to lay the foundation for\nfuture oppression and conflict. Indeed, he concludes, the agreements had achieved so\nlittle and cost so much for the Palestinians that \u201ca failure to reach a deal would have\nbeen better than the deal that emerged from Oslo.\u201d61\nKhalidi is particularly unstinting in his criticism of Yasir Arafat\u2019s management of\nthe negotiations. He locates the genesis of the PLO chair\u2019s mishandling of the Oslo\nprocess in his shortsighted decision to back Saddam Husayn in the conflict between\nIraq and the United States in 1990-1991. Desperate to restore relevance to the PLO in\nthe wake of Husayn\u2019s defeat, Arafat followed that disastrous move by plunging\nheadlong into the peace talks. Signing deals that Palestinian experts had not yet vetted,\nhe agreed to let Israel retain total authority over key issues such as borders and water.\nEven worse, Khalidi argues, was Arafat\u2019s decision to recognize Israel in exchange for its\nrecognition of the PLO. Khalidi allows that Rabin\u2019s formal acknowledgment of the\nPalestinians as a people marked a significant shift in Israel\u2019s position; however, he also\nnotes that this concession came at the cost of the only meaningful card Arafat had to\nplay\u2014recognition of Israel\u2014and asserts that the PLO chair should have kept it in his\nhand until Israel committed to a Palestinian state in the Occupied Territories.62\nIraq: Dual Containment\nThe Gulf area experienced a similar rise in tension during the mid-to-late 1990s.\nIn that region, the rising conflict was a product of Washington\u2019s ongoing effort to restrain\nboth Ba\u02bfthist Iraq and revolutionary Iran. Since the end of the Gulf War, the US had\nsought to achieve those ends through an approach called \u201c\u2018dual containment.\u2019\u201d\nDesigned to neutralize Saddam Husayn while simultaneously preventing Iran from\ntaking advantage of his weakness to expand its influence into Iraq, it was a complex\npolicy\u2014one that relied on a combination of force, economic leverage, and extensive\ninternational cooperation to keep both countries weak.63\nWashington\u2019s efforts to limit Tehran\u2019s influence were fairly straightforward.\nInvolving an escalating series of sanctions designed to weaken Iran\u2019s economy, the\ncampaign initially banned American oil companies from participating in the extraction of\nIranian petroleum and barred American citizens from doing business in the country.\nMore controversially, after 1996 the sanctions regime expanded to include penalties on\nforeign companies that invested more than token amounts of money in Iran\u2019s oil\nindustry.64\n61 Khalidi, The Hundred Years\u2019 War on Palestine, 200\u2013201.\n62 Khalidi, 184\u201385, 198\u2013201.\n63 Steven Hurst, The United States and Iraq since 1979: Hegemony, Oil and War\n(Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), 119\u201321.\n64 Keddie, Modern Iran, 565. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 613\nCentering on the aggressive enforcement of Gulf War-era UN Security Council\nResolutions, the American effort to restrain Iraq was more complex. It involved three\ncomponents. First, Washington aggressively pursued an intrusive arms inspection\nregime, the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), that the UN had\nauthorized for the purpose of uncovering and destroying Iraq\u2019s WMD programs.\nSecond, it vigorously enforced UN financial and trade sanctions that were to remain in\neffect until the Security Council had determined that Iraq was in full compliance with all\nUN resolutions. Finally, the US maintained and expanded the existing No Fly Zones\nover northern and southern Iraq and launched punitive air attacks when Iraqi forces\nresisted.65\nFor the first few years, dual containment was successful. The Iraqi regime went\nto substantial lengths to mislead the arms inspectors, but it nonetheless grudgingly\npermitted them access to its weapons\u2019 production facilities. Meanwhile, the strict\nenforcement of sanctions on Iran prevented Tehran from taking advantage of Iraq\u2019s\nweakness. More encouragingly, the election of the moderate Seyyed Mohammed\nKhatami (r. 1997-2005) as Iran\u2019s president in 1997 appeared to suggest that Iran was\nno longer the ideological threat it had once been, and that the US could consider\nloosening the enforcement of the sanctions it had imposed on Tehran.66\nThere was no corresponding thaw in Iraqi-American relations, however. Instead,\nbeginning in the mid 1990s, Saddam Husayn became increasingly aggressive in his\nefforts to win international support for an end to the UN sanctions on his country. He\nbegan by exploiting reports that there had been a massive increase in infant mortality in\nIraq following the end of the Gulf War. More detailed investigations later revealed that\nthese studies were based on doctored Iraqi figures and that the child-mortality rate had\nnot meaningfully increased; in the immediate term, however, Saddam Husayn\u2019s effort\nproved surprisingly effective in generating pressure on the UN Security Council. Indeed,\nthe Iraqi campaign was so successful that the UN responded in 1995 with a new\ncarveout to the sanctions\u2019 regime called the Oil-for-Food Program. Designed to end the\nsuffering of the Iraqi people while simultaneously keeping sanctions in place, it\npermitted Iraq to sell large quantities of petroleum with the stipulation that it use the\nproceeds to buy only food, medicine, and other necessities.67\nPleased to have cracked the sanctions regime, Saddam Husayn next moved to\neliminate it altogether. To do so, he first sought to drive a wedge between the US\u2014\nwhich pressed for the continued vigorous enforcement of sanctions\u2014and countries like\nFrance, Russia, and China that increasingly wanted to pursue commercial opportunities\n65 Gary Sick, \u201cThe United States in the Persian Gulf: From Twin Pillars to Dual\nContainment,\u201d in The Middle East and the United States: A Historical and Political\nReassessment, ed.

Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 614\nin Iraq. He followed by stepping up his resistance to UNSCOM\u2019s arms control\ninspections. Claiming that the inspectors were intruding on Iraqi security sites, he began\nstonewalling them in 1997 before ceasing to comply with the inspection regime\naltogether in the fall of 1998.68\nIraq\u2019s increasing defiance put the Clinton administration in a bind. On the one\nhand, the American public showed no stomach for another war with Iraq. On the other,\ndual containment had clearly failed to curb Saddam Husayn. Further complicating\nmatters, a group of newly influential conservative policymakers known as \u201c\u2018Neocons\u2019\u201d\nbegan to pressure the administration to abandon containment in favor of outright regime\nchange. Clinton rejected that course but did respond to Husayn\u2019s unilateral termination\nof the inspection program with a massive four-day air assault on Iraq in December 1998\ncodenamed Operation Desert Fox. The president also signed the Iraq Liberation Act in\nOctober of that year, which made \u201c\u2018regime change\u2019\u201d formal American policy. The act\nwas largely symbolic and did not meaningfully change the US approach to Iraq, but it\ndid signal Washington\u2019s increased willingness to pursue a more confrontational\napproach. It also made clear the frustration of many in the US government with the fact\nthat nearly a decade after they had celebrated a victory believed to have neutralized\nSaddam Husayn, they still found themselves locked in an expensive conflict with him\nthat showed no signs of resolution.69\nTransnational Jihad\nThe sanctions and American punitive attacks on Iraq played a part in fueling a\nnew struggle that pitted the United States against a shadowy transnational terrorist\norganization called al-Qa\u02bfida that Osama bin Laden had first organized in 1988 while\nthe Afghan insurgency was winding down. The seeds of that conflict first took root\nduring the chaotic days immediately following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. As\nwe have seen, Riyadh had responded to Saddam Husayn\u2019s aggression by agreeing to\nthe deployment of American forces to Saudi Arabia. That decision shocked Osama bin\nLaden. He strongly agreed that Iraq needed to be pushed out of Kuwait, but he recoiled\nat the thought of thousands of non-Muslim Westerners being stationed on land that he\nviewed as sacred.70\nIn response, he devised a strategy to resolve the crisis that relied not on Western\nforces but instead on Muslim guerrillas patterned on the \u201c\u2018Afghan Arabs\u2019\u201d who had\nfought the Soviets in the 1980s. Parlaying the influence he had gained from his work in\nAfghanistan, he was able to present his plan to several powerful Saudi princes. The\nstrategy he laid out was a bold one. Claiming that he could quickly raise an army of\n100,000 disciplined, well-trained fighters, he argued that his soldiers would force the\nIraqis to retreat using the same tactics that had compelled the USSR to abandon\n68 Tripp, A History of Iraq, 278\u201379.\n69 Hahn, Missions Accomplished?, 127\u201331.\n70 Fawaz A. Gerges, The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda (Oxford: Oxford University Press,\n2014), 48\u201349. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 615\nAfghanistan in 1988. Exuding absolute confidence in his approach, he blithely assured\none prince that \u201c\u2018we are ready to get the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.\u201d He was thus\nshocked when Riyadh rejected his proposal out of hand. Dubious that Bin Laden could\nraise the promised troops or defeat Iraq\u2019s enormous army, King Fahd instead preferred\nto stick with America\u2019s more-dependable military might.71\nBitter about Saudi Arabia\u2019s decision to allow Westerners into the land of the Holy\nPlaces, Bin Laden prepared to go to war with both the US and the kingdom. He did not\nimmediately organize attacks against them, however. Instead, facing Saudi government\npressure for his criticism of the royal family, he first moved to establish a new base of\noperations in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum in 1992. There, under a friendly Islamist\ngovernment that happily entertained both anti-Western terrorists such as Carlos the\nJackal (1949- ) and jihadi figures like Zawahiri, he prepared for the coming conflict by\nbuilding up al-Qa\u02bfida\u2019s infrastructure and organizational capacity. As part of that effort,\nhe created training camps, founded a series of businesses at which he employed many\njihadis, planned terrorist attacks, and cemented his ties with members of Egypt\u2019s\nGamaat Islamiya and Islamic Jihad.72\nAbove all, he spent his time in Sudan publicly castigating Riyadh for permitting\nthe US military deployment in Saudi Arabia to continue. Fahd had pledged that it would\nlast only until the end of the Gulf War; with Saudi-based US aircraft enforcing the\nsouthern No Fly Zone in Iraq, however, it certainly appeared to have become\npermanent. Bin Laden\u2019s criticism of the Saudi dynasty for its continued willingness to\npermit Washington to base forces in the kingdom irritated Riyadh and led it to\nsuccessfully pressure the government in Khartoum to kick Bin Laden out of Sudan in\n1996. He found sanctuary in Afghanistan where a group of religious students called the\nTaliban had recently established an austere, Wahhabi-based Islamist state.73\nIt was during this time that Bin Laden developed a radical new construction of\njihad. Heretofore, a consensus had existed that the movement needed to defeat the\nnear enemy\u2014meaning the secular regimes that dominated the Middle East\u2014and\nreestablish shari\u02bfa law before the Muslim world would have the strength to confront the\nfar enemy. Bin Laden turned this strategy on its head. He argued that instead of\nfocusing on the near enemy\u2014an approach that had nearly destroyed the jihadi\norganizations in the 1990s\u2014militant Muslims should go to war with the far enemy. But\nhow would this plan work? How would attacking the world\u2019s wealthiest and most\npowerful country help the jihadis to achieve their goals? For Bin Laden, the key was\nWashington\u2019s reaction. He argued that attacking America would spur the US to mount a\nresponse so devastating that it would finally rouse the globe\u2019s Muslims to action against\nthe West. In the process, the now-reawakened Muslim community would overthrow the\n71 Gerges, The Far Enemy, 145\u201348.\n72 Lawrence Wright, The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State (New York:\nAlfred A. Knopf, 2016), 185\u201392.\n73 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 185\u201392; Gerges, The\nRise and Fall of Al-Qaeda, 56. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 616\napostate, near-enemy states and replace them with Islamist ones. Living under God\u2019s\nlaw, the Islamic world would then defeat the far enemy and once again assume its\nrightful position of global leadership.74\nBin Laden\u2019s new idea sharply divided the militant organizations. Some, most\nnotably Ayman Zawahiri, enthusiastically endorsed his new, transnational approach and\nurged jihadis to attack the \u201c\u2018head of the snake.\u2019\u201d In contrast, many others argued that\nwaging war against the only remaining superpower was folly and refused to take part.\nIndeed, Gamaat Islamiya went so far as to release a statement affirming that \u201c\u2018[w]e are\nnot a party in any front that confronts Americans.\u2019\u201d75\nBin Laden and Zawahiri were unmoved by these objections, however, and\ninstead pressed ahead with their transnational campaign. Most notably, in February\n1998, al-Qa\u02bfida announced the establishment of a new organization, the International\nIslamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, and issued a formal declaration of\nwar on the United States. It charged the US with three offenses: occupying the sacred\nland of Arabia, making war on the Iraqi people via sanctions and punitive attacks, and\nsupporting Israel. Importantly, it also declared that all Muslims bear an \u201cindividual duty\u201d\nto kill Americans in order to end its war on the Islamic world.76\nThe organization did not confine itself to a war of words, moreover. Instead, it\nfollowed the declaration with its first large-scale terror operation. Timing the attack to\ncoincide with the eighth anniversary of the first Desert Shield deployment, Al-Qa\u02bfida\nsuicide bombers simultaneously detonated truck bombs outside the US embassies in\nKenya and Tanzania in August 1998. Twelve Americans and 212 Africans died in those\nattacks, and another four thousand people were injured. Alarmed, Washington retaliated\nby launching cruise missiles at an al-Qa\u02bfida training camp in Afghanistan and at a\npharmaceutical plant in Sudan it suspected\u2014incorrectly\u2014of producing chemical\nweapons. Undeterred by the American response, Bin Laden followed with a series of\nlargely failed terror operations across the globe during the celebration of the new\nmillennium, and then with a successful suicide-bombing attack on the guided-missile\ndestroyer USS Cole in Aden harbor that killed seventeen sailors and nearly made the\nvessel the first American warship sunk in combat since the end of the Second World\nWar. Meanwhile, planning continued for a major attack on the American homeland\u2014\none to be of such scale and impact that it would ignite the Islamic-Christian clash of\ncivilizations that Bin Laden believed would finally reunite the umma under shari\u02bfa law.77\n74 Gerges, The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda, 55, 65\u201366.\n75 Gerges, 65\u201367.\n76 Wright, The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, 294\u201395; Quote from\nGerges, The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda, 78.\n77 Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, 205\u201313. Chapter Eighteen: The Gulf War and Its Legacy, 1990-2001 Page 617\nConclusion\nThus, by the year 2000, the earlier hope that the Middle East was poised to move\nbeyond the conflicts that had characterized the region during the twentieth century had\nfaded. It is true that the religious cold war between Iran and Saudi Arabia had ended,\nbut other conflicts persisted.78 Baghdad and Washington continued to clash over\nenforcement of the UN sanctions regime, transnational jihadis were increasingly\ndetermined to incite a conflict with America, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict that had\nseemed so tantalizingly close to a peaceful resolution now appeared to be as\ndepressingly insoluble as ever.\nThere was also an important change to the geostrategic balance in the Middle\nEast that seemed to further complicate events in the area. The US now had a\nsubstantial military presence in the region\u2014one that had become, in the words of the\nhistorian Andrew Bacevich, \u201cpermanent and sustained, rather than occasional and\nepisodic\u201d and that had, by its very presence, stoked the conflict between the emerging\ntransnational jihadis and the West. Still, if the optimism of the early 1990s had faded,\nthe Middle East nonetheless seemed no worse off than it had been in recent decades.\nIndeed, few at the turn of the century had the least inkling about the shocking events\nand metastasizing conflicts that would come to characterize the Middle East during the\nfirst decade of the new millennia.79\n78 Note, though, that the conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia would roar back to life\nwith a vengeance in the 2000s.\n79 Bacevich, America\u2019s War for the Greater Middle East, 112."
