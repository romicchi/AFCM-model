Sasha Gomez, 16, of Queens, ended\nup with the phone. She decided to keep it and use it. She did not realize the consequences. She was\nhumiliated, harassed, and arrested. And she became the subject of a public shaming ritual only possible\nby today\u2019s media in today\u2019s culture.\nThe phone was an expensive model, a T-Mobile Sidekick that sold for $350. Sasha began using the phone\nto take photographs and send instant messages to friends and family. The woman who lost the phone\nthought she would never see the phone again. She bought another Sidekick, logged onto her account and\nfound that the old phone was being used. She saw photographs and messages by Sasha. The woman\nwanted her old phone back. She had a media-savvy friend, Evan Guttman. Evan was able to track down\nSasha by her instant messages. He contacted Sasha and asked her to return the phone to his friend.\n\u201cBasically, she told me to get lost,\u201d Evan later told The New York Times. [1]\nEvan decided to fight for his friend\u2019s phone\u2014through the media. He put up a web page that told the story\nof the lost cell phone. He put up the pictures of Sasha and her family. The story spread. Evan began\ngetting dozens and then hundreds of sympathetic emails from other people who had lost phones and\nunderstood his frustration with Sasha. Two technology blogs, Diggs and Gizmodo, linked to the story and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n4 web page. Evan then got thousands of emails, some from as far off as Africa and Asia. Lawyers and police\nofficers contacted Evan about property law and told him how to approach the police. Some people went\nfurther than writing supportive emails. They found Sasha\u2019s MySpace page. They sent Sasha and her\nfriends messages demanding the return of the phone. Other people learned her home address in Queens,\ndrove by her apartment building and shouted \u201cthief.\u201d\nSasha and her family were outraged and alarmed. They contacted Evan. Sasha still refused to return the\nphone. Her brother too communicated with Evan. He said he was a military policeman, and he warned\nEvan to leave Sasha alone. Evan posted those comments online. He soon heard from others in the\nmilitary. They told him that the brother\u2019s threats were a violation of military policy. They said they would\nreport the threats to the brother\u2019s superiors.\nArmed with all this information, Evan contacted Sasha one more time. He said he and his friend would\nnext go the police. Evan said he was threatened again. He and his friend went to the police who then\narrested Sasha. The charge was possession of stolen property. Sasha\u2019s mother came forward and said she\nhad bought the phone for $50 on a subway platform and given it to Sasha. Police confiscated the phone\nfor the original owner. And Evan became a minor cultural celebrity. The story appeared in The New York\nTimes and the International Herald Tribune and was broadcast on MSNBC and other outlets. It was a\nmodern morality tale caused by, and then made possible by, the intersection of media technology and\nculture.\nI thought the story of the lost cell phone would be a great introduction for a text on understanding media\nand culture and used The New York Times story to write the previous paragraphs. Long after, when I\nshowed the introduction to a colleague, he looked at me and said, \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d He showed me a\nthen-recent book by media scholar Clay Shirky, Here Comes Everybody, a book on the power of\norganizing through new media. Shirky begins his book\u2014with the same story of the lost cell phone. With\nsome wry amusement over fate, I decided that I would keep my introduction as well. In some ways, the\nmovement of the lost cell phone story from Evan\u2019s website through The New York Times through MSNBC\nthrough Clay Shirky\u2019s text through my book on understanding media and culture is symbolic, as we will\nsee, of the multitude of flows between media and culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n5 Understanding Media and Culture\nThis book\u2019s title tells its intent. It is written to help you understand media and culture. The media and\nculture are so much a part of our days that sometimes it is difficult to step back and appreciate and\napprehend their great impact on our lives.\nThe book\u2019s title, and the book itself, begin with a focus squarely on media. Think of your typical day. If you\nare like many people, you wake to a digital alarm clock or perhaps your cell phone. Soon after waking, you\nlikely have a routine that involves some media. Some people immediately check the cell phone for text\nmessages. Others will turn on the computer and check Facebook, email, or websites. Some people read the\nnewspaper. Others listen to music on an iPod or CD. Some people will turn on the television and watch a\nweather channel, cable news, or Sports Center. Heading to work or class, you may chat on a cell phone or\nlisten to music. Your classes likely employ various types of media from course management software to\nPowerPoint presentations to DVDs to YouTube. You may return home and relax with video games,\ntelevision, movies, more Facebook, or music. You connect with friends on campus and beyond with text\nmessages or Facebook. And your day may end as you fall asleep to digital music. Media for most of us are\nentwined with almost every aspect of life and work. Understanding media will not only help you\nappreciate the role of media in your life but also help you be a more informed citizen, a more savvy\nconsumer, and a more successful worker. Media influence all those aspects of life as well.\nThe book\u2019s title also has links to a highly influential book in media studies, Understanding Media, by the\nsocial theorist and critic, Marshall McLuhan.[2] In the midst of the 20th century and the rise of television\nas a mass medium, McLuhan foresaw how profoundly media would shape human lives. His work on\nmedia spanned four decades, from the 1950s to his death in 1980. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the\nheight of television\u2019s popularity and the emergence of computers, he became an international celebrity.\nHe appeared on magazine covers and television talk shows. He had a cameo appearance in the Woody\nAllen film, Annie Hall. Wired magazine listed him on its masthead as \u201cpatron saint.\u201d In universities,\nhowever, McLuhan was often dismissed, perhaps because of his celebrity, his outlandish style, and his\nbroad and sweeping declarations. Yet as media continued to develop in ways anticipated by his writings,\nMcLuhan again found an audience in media studies.\nIn Understanding Media, McLuhan offered some provocative thoughts. He said that the media\nthemselves were far more important than any content they carried. Indeed, he said, each medium, such as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n6 print or broadcast, physically affects the human central nervous system in a certain way. Media influence\nthe way the brain works and how it processes information. They create new patterns of thought and\nbehavior. Looking back over time, McLuhan found that people and societies were shaped by the dominant\nmedia of their time. For example, McLuhan argued, people and societies of the printing press era were\nshaped by that medium. And, he said, people and societies were being shaped in new ways by electronic\nmedia. Summing up, in one of his well-known phrases, he said, \u201cThe medium is the message.\u201d\nThis book\u2019s title uses McLuhan\u2019s title\u2014and adds culture. McLuhan well understood how media shape\nculture. However, one weakness in McLuhan\u2019s work, especially his early work, is that he did not fully\naccount for how culture shapes media. Culture can be a vague and empty term. Sometimes culture is\ndefined in a very narrow sense as \u201cthe arts\u201d or some sort of fashionable refinement. Another definition of\nculture is much more expansive, however. In this broader sense, culture is a particular way of life and how\nthat life is acted out each day in works, practices, and activities. Thus, we can talk about Italian culture,\nJavanese culture, or the culture of the ancient Greeks. Another communication theorist, James Carey,\nelegantly captures this expansive view of culture. In \u201cA Cultural Approach to Communication,\u201d Carey\nwrote the following:\n\u201cWe create, express, and convey our knowledge of and attitudes toward reality through the construction of\na variety of symbol systems: art, science, journalism, religion, common sense, mythology. How do we do\nthis? What are the differences between these forms? What are the historical and comparative variations in\nthem? How do changes in communication technology influence what we can concretely create and\napprehend? How do groups in society struggle over the definition of what is real?\u201d [3]\nThat large sense of culture will be used in this book. The chapters to come will provide an in-depth look at\nthe relationship of media and culture. We will look at many kinds of media and how those media shape\nand are shaped by culture. Media and culture shape each other around the globe, of course. The focus in\nthis book primarily will be on the United States. This focus is not because U.S. media have such global\nreach but because understanding media and culture in one setting will allow you to think about media and\nculture in other settings. This intellectual journey should be interesting and fun. You live, study, work,\nand play with media in culture. By the book\u2019s end, you should have a much deeper appreciation and\nunderstanding of them.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n7 [1] Nicholas Confessore, \u201cTale of a Lost Cellphone, and Untold Static,\u201d The New York Times,June 21, 2006.\nWeb. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/nyregion/21sidekick.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=evan+guttman&st=nyt\n[2] Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man.

New York: Taylor & Francis, 2006, p. 24.\n1.1\nIntersection of American Media and Culture\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Distinguish between mass communication and mass media.\n2. Define culture.\n3. Pose questions that will be explored in the rest of the text.\nMass Communication, Mass Media, and Culture\nWe use all kinds of terms to talk about media. It will be useful to clarify them. It will be especially\nimportant to distinguish between mass communication and mass media, and to attempt a working\ndefinition of culture. You likely are reading this book as part of a class dedicated to mass communication,\nso let\u2019s start with mass communication first. Note that adjective: mass. Here is a horrible definition\nof mass from an online dictionary: Of, relating to, characteristic of, directed at, or attended by a large\nnumber of people. But the definition gets the point across. Communication can take place just between\ntwo people, or among a few people, or maybe even within one person who is talking to\nhimself. Mass communication is communication of, relating to, characteristic of, directed at, or attended\nby a large number of people. That\u2019s pretty ugly. Let\u2019s try the following: Mass communication refers to\ncommunication transmitted to large segments of the population.\nHow does that happen? The transmission of mass communication happens using one or more of many\ndifferent kinds of media (people sometimes forget that media is the plural of the singular, medium). A\nmedium is simply an instrument or means of transmission. It can be two tin cans connected by a string. It\ncan be television. It can be the Internet. A mass medium is a means of transmission designed to reach a\nwide audience. It is not tin cans on a string, unless you have a lot of cans, but it can be television or the\nInternet. Media are more than one medium. So mass media refers to those means of transmission that are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n8 designed to reach a wide audience. Mass media are commonly considered to include radio, film,\nnewspapers, magazines, books, and video games, as well as Internet blogs, podcasts, and video sharing.\nLastly, let\u2019s define culture a bit more. All this mass communication over mass media takes place among\npeople in a particular time and place. Those people share ideas about reality and the world and\nthemselves. They act out those ideas daily in their lives, work, and creative expressions, and they do so in\nways that are different from other people in other places and other times. We can use culture to refer to\nthe acting out of these shared ideas.\nOne of the great scholars of culture, anthropologist Clifford Geertz, offered this definition. He said, culture\nis \u201can historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited\nconceptions expressed in symbolic forms by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop\ntheir knowledge about and their attitudes toward life\u201d (1973, 89). That\u2019s difficult language, but you can get\nthe idea\u2014culture is historically transmitted knowledge and attitudes toward life expressed in symbolic\nform. Or perhaps more simply,culture is the expressed and shared values, attitudes, beliefs, and practices\nof a social group, organization, or institution. It is OK if that still seems broad and fluid. Scholars too\nwrestle with the term because it must capture so much. Culture should not be easy to define.\nWhat this book will do is bring together media and culture in the context of the American experience.\nThroughout American history, evolving media technologies have changed the way we relate socially,\neconomically, and politically. Here\u2019s one example from long ago that is still talked about today. In 1960,\nthe first televised presidential debates changed American history forever. The young senator, John F.\nKennedy, looked wonderful on television. He appeared energetic, crisp and at ease, while Vice President\nRichard Nixon looked nervous and uncomfortable. His makeup was caked on. He hunched and slouched.\nPeople who listened to the debate on the radio considered it a tie. But most people who watched the\ndebate on television believed that Kennedy crushed Nixon. Kennedy upset Nixon and won the presidency.\nA few months later, the newly-elected president gave credit to technology for changing public perceptions\nand enabling his win. He claimed that \u201cit was TV more than anything else that turned the tide.\u201d [1] Ever\nsince Kennedy, American presidential hopefuls have had to be increasingly television-ready and media\nsavvy. Indeed, evolving technology has helped change what the American public wants out of its leaders.\nIn today\u2019s wired world of smartphones and streaming satellite feeds, our expectations of our leaders,\ncelebrities, teachers, and even ourselves are changing in drastic ways. This book aims to provide you with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n9 the context, tools, and theories to understand changes brought about by the commingling of media and\nculture. Rather than telling you what to think, this book hopes to provide you with a framework to\nconsider some of the crucial issues affecting media and culture in today\u2019s world. The following are some\nquestions to consider now and to keep in mind as you move forward in this book:\n\uf0b7 The second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century saw a huge growth of media\nforms, including radio, cinema, television, the Internet, and cell phone. Understanding the evolution\nof media technology can help you understanding not only the media of today but also the media of\ntomorrow. What then are the roots of media in U.S. history? What were the dominant forms of media\npresent in the United States during the Revolution? The Industrial Revolution? World Wars I and II?\nHow did these forms of media differ from the ones we have today? How did they help shape the way\npeople interacted with and understood the world they lived in?\n\uf0b7 Contemporary Americans have more means of getting information and entertainment than ever\nbefore. What are the major media present in the United States today? How do these forms of media\ninteract with one another? How do they overlap? How are they distinct?\n\uf0b7 What is the role of media in American culture today? Some people argue that dramatic and\ncontroversial events help fuel the demand for 24-hour news access. In June 2011, people around the\nworld spent hours glued to coverage of the Casey Anthony trial. More recently, in November of 2011,\nsports coverage moved from football scores to the Penn State football sex-abuse scandal. What are\nsome other ways that culture affects media? Conversely, how do media affect culture? Do violent\ntelevision shows and video games influence viewers to become more violent? Is the Internet making\nour culture more open and democratic, or more shallow and distracted?\n\uf0b7 Though we may not (yet) have space-age technology, such as time travel, hover cars, and\nteleportation, today\u2019s electronic gadgets would probably stun Americans of a century ago. Will we be\nstunned by future media? How can today\u2019s media landscape help us understand what might await us\nin years to come? What will the future of American media and culture look like?\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Mass communication refers to a message transmitted to a large audience; the means of transmission is\nknown as mass media. Many different kinds of mass media exist and have existed for centuries. Both have\nan effect on culture, which is a shared and expressed collection of behaviors, practices, beliefs, and values\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n10 that are particular to a group, organization, or institution. Culture and media exert influence on each\nother in subtle, complex ways.\n\uf0b7 The 1960 election is an example of how changes in media technology have had a major impact on culture.\nBut the influence goes both ways, and culture shapes media in important ways, even how media evolve.\nEXERCISE\nReread the previous questions about media and culture. Write down some of your initial responses or\nreactions, based on your prior knowledge or intuition. Keep the piece of paper somewhere secure and\nreturn to it on the last day of the course. Were your responses on target? How has your understanding of\nmedia and culture changed? How might you answer questions differently now?\n[1] Louis Menand, \u201cMasters of the Matrix,\u201d The New Yorker, January 5, 2004.\n1.2\nHow Did We Get Here? The Evolution of Media\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Discuss events that impacted the adaptation of mass media.\n2. Explain how different technological transitions have shaped media industries.\n3. Identify four roles the media perform in our society.\n\u201cWell, how did I get here?\u201d a baffled David Byrne sings in the Talking Heads song, \u201cOnce in a\nLifetime.\u201d The contemporary media landscape is so rich, deep, and multifaceted that it\u2019s easy to\nimagine American media consumers asking themselves the same question. In 2010, Americans could\nturn on their television and find 24-hour news channels, as well as music videos, nature\ndocumentaries, and reality shows about everything from hoarders to fashion models. That\u2019s not to\nmention movies available on-demand from cable providers, or television and video available online\nfor streaming or downloading. Half of American households receive a daily newspaper, and the\naverage person holds 1.9 magazine subscriptions. [1] A University of California San Diego study\nclaimed that U.S. households consumed around 3.6 zettabytes of information in 2008, the digital\nequivalent of a 7-foot high stack of books covering the entire United States, including Alaska\u2014a 350\npercent increase since 1980. [2] Americans are exposed to media in taxicabs and busses, in classrooms\nand doctors\u2019 offices, on highways and in airplanes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n11 Later chapters will offer in-depth explorations of how particular media developed in different eras.\nBut we can begin to orient ourselves here by briefly examining a history of media in culture, looking\nat the ways technological innovations have helped to bring us to where we are today, and finally\nconsidering the varied roles the media fill in our culture today.\nA Brief History of Mass Media and Culture\nUntil Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s 15th-century invention of the movable type printing press, books were\npainstakingly handwritten, and no two copies were exactly the same. The printing press made the mass\nproduction of print media possible. Not only was it much cheaper to produce written material, but new\ntransportation technologies also made it easier for texts to reach a wide audience. It\u2019s hard to overstate\nthe importance of Gutenberg\u2019s invention, which helped usher in massive cultural movements like the\nEuropean Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. In 1810, another German printer, Friedrich\nKoenig, pushed media production even further when he essentially hooked the steam engine up to a\nprinting press, enabling the industrialization of printed media. In 1800, a hand-operated printing press\ncould produce about 480 pages per hour; Koenig\u2019s machine more than doubled this rate. (By the 1930s,\nmany printing presses had an output of 3000 pages an hour.) This increased efficiency helped lead to the\nrise of the daily newspaper.\nAs the first Europeans settled the land that would come to be called the United States of America, the\nnewspaper was an essential medium. At first, newspapers helped the Europeans stay connected with\nevents back home. But as the people developed their own way of life\u2014their own culture\u2014newspapers\nhelped give expression to that culture. Political scientist Benedict Anderson has argued that newspapers\nalso helped forge a sense of national identity by treating readers across the country as part of one unified\ngroup with common goals and values. Newspapers, he said, helped create an \u201cimagined community.\u201d\nThe United States continued to develop, and the newspaper was the perfect medium for the increasingly\nurbanized Americans of the 19th century, who could no longer get their local news merely through gossip\nand word of mouth. These Americans were living in an unfamiliar world, and newspapers and other\npublications helped them negotiate the rapidly changing world. The Industrial Revolution meant that\npeople had more leisure time and more money, and media helped them figure out how to spend both.\nIn the 1830s, the major daily newspapers faced a new threat with the rise of the penny press\u2014newspapers\nthat were low-priced broadsheets. These papers served as a cheaper, more sensational daily news source\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n12 and privileged news of murder and adventure over the dry political news of the day. While earlier\nnewspapers catered to a wealthier, more educated audience, the penny press attempted to reach a wide\nswath of readers through cheap prices and entertaining (often scandalous) stories. The penny press can be\nseen as the forerunner to today\u2019s gossip-hungry tabloids.\nFigure 1.3\nThe penny press appealed to readers\u2019 desires for lurid tales of murder and scandal.\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, the first major non-print forms of mass media\u2014film and radio\u2014\nexploded in popularity. Radios, which were less expensive than telephones and widely available by the\n1920s, especially had the unprecedented ability of allowing huge numbers of people to listen to the same\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n13 event at the same time. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge\u2019s preelection speech reached more than 20\nmillion people. Radio was a boon for advertisers, who now had access to a large and captive audience. An\nearly advertising consultant claimed that the early days of radio were \u201ca glorious opportunity for the\nadvertising man to spread his sales propaganda\u201d thanks to \u201ca countless audience, sympathetic, pleasure\nseeking, enthusiastic, curious, interested, approachable in the privacy of their homes.\u201d [3]\nThe reach of radio also further helped forge an American culture. The medium was able to downplay\nregional differences and encourage a unified sense of the American lifestyle\u2014a lifestyle that was\nincreasingly driven and defined by consumer purchases. \u201cAmericans in the 1920s were the first to wear\nready-made, exact-size clothing\u2026to play electric phonographs, to use electric vacuum cleaners, to listen to\ncommercial radio broadcasts, and to drink fresh orange juice year round.\u201d [4] This boom in consumerism\nput its stamp on the 1920s, and, ironically, helped contribute to the Great Depression of the 1930s. [5]\nThe post-World War II era in the United States was marked by prosperity, and by the introduction of a\nseductive new form of mass communication: television. In 1946, there were about 17,000 televisions in\nthe entire United States. Within seven years, two-thirds of American households owned at least one set.\nAs the United States\u2019 gross national product (GNP) doubled in the 1950s, and again in the 1960s, the\nAmerican home became firmly ensconced as a consumer unit. Along with a television, the typical U.S.\nfamily owned a car and a house in the suburbs, all of which contributed to the nation\u2019s thriving consumer-\nbased economy.\nBroadcast television was the dominant form of mass media. There were just three major networks, and\nthey controlled over 90 percent of the news programs, live events, and sitcoms viewed by Americans. On\nsome nights, close to half the nation watched the same show! Some social critics argued that television\nwas fostering a homogenous, conformist culture by reinforcing ideas about what \u201cnormal\u201d American life\nlooked like. But television also contributed to the counterculture of the 1960s. The Vietnam War was the\nnation\u2019s first televised military conflict, and nightly images of war footage and war protestors helped\nintensify the nation\u2019s internal conflicts.\nBroadcast technology, including radio and television, had such a hold of the American imagination that\nnewspapers and other print media found themselves having to adapt to the new media landscape. Print\nmedia was more durable and easily archived, and allowed users more flexibility in terms of time\u2014once a\nperson had purchased a magazine, he could read it whenever and wherever he\u2019d like. Broadcast media, in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n14 contrast, usually aired programs on a fixed schedule, which allowed it to both provide a sense of\nimmediacy but also impermanence\u2014until the advent of digital video recorders in the 21st century, it was\nimpossible to pause and rewind a television broadcast.\nThe media world faced drastic changes once again in the 1980s and 1990s with the spread of cable\ntelevision. During the early decades of television, viewers had a limited number of channels from which to\nchoose. In 1975, the three major networks accounted for 93 percent of all television viewing. By 2004,\nhowever, this share had dropped to 28.4 percent of total viewing, thanks to the spread of cable television.\nCable providers allowed viewers a wide menu of choices, including channels specifically tailored to people\nwho wanted to watch only golf, weather, classic films, sermons, or videos of sharks. Still, until the mid-\n1990s, television was dominated by the three large networks. The Telecommunications Act of 1996, an\nattempt to foster competition by deregulating the industry, actually resulted in many mergers and buyouts\nof small companies by large companies. The broadcast spectrum in many places was in the hands of a few\nlarge corporations. In 2003, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) loosened regulation even\nfurther, allowing a single company to own 45 percent of a single market (up from 25 percent in 1982).\nTechnological Transitions Shape Media Industries\nNew media technologies both spring from and cause cultural change. For this reason, it can be difficult to\nneatly sort the evolution of media into clear causes and effects. Did radio fuel the consumerist boom of the\n1920s, or did the radio become wildly popular because it appealed to a society that was already exploring\nconsumerist tendencies? Probably a little bit of both. Technological innovations such as the steam engine,\nelectricity, wireless communication, and the Internet have all had lasting and significant effects on\nAmerican culture. As media historians Asa Briggs and Peter Burke note, every crucial invention came with\n\u201ca change in historical perspectives.\u201d [6] Electricity altered the way people thought about time, since work\nand play were no longer dependent on the daily rhythms of sunrise and sunset. Wireless communication\ncollapsed distance. The Internet revolutionized the way we store and retrieve information.\nThe contemporary media age can trace its origins back to the electrical telegraph, patented in the United\nStates by Samuel Morse in 1837. Thanks to the telegraph, communication was no longer linked to the\nphysical transportation of messages. Suddenly, it didn\u2019t matter whether a message needed to travel five or\nfive hundred miles. Suddenly, information from distant places was nearly as accessible as local news.\nWhen the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, allowing near-instantaneous communication from the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n15 United States to Europe, The London Times described it as \u201cthe greatest discovery since that of Columbus,\na vast enlargement\u2026given to the sphere of human activity.\u201d [7]Celebrations broke out in New York as\npeople marveled at the new media. Telegraph lines began to stretch across the globe, making their own\nkind of world wide web.\nNot long after the telegraph, wireless communication (which eventually led to the development of radio,\ntelevision, and other broadcast media) emerged as an extension of telegraph technology. Although many\n19th-century inventors, including Nikola Tesla, had a hand in early wireless experiments, it was Italian-\nborn Guglielmo Marconi who is recognized as the developer of the first practical wireless radio system.\nThis mysterious invention, where sounds seemed to magically travel through the air, captured the world\u2019s\nimagination. Early radio was used for military communication, but soon the technology entered the home.\nThe radio mania that swept the country inspired hundreds of applications for broadcasting licenses, some\nfrom newspapers and other news outlets, while other radio station operators included retail stores,\nschools, and even cities. In the 1920s, large media networks\u2014including the National Broadcasting\nCompany (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS)\u2014were launched, and they soon began to\ndominate the airwaves. In 1926, they owned 6.4 percent of U.S. broadcasting stations; by 1931, that\nnumber had risen to 30 percent. [8]\nThe 19th-century development of photographic technologies would lead to the later innovations of cinema\nand television. As with wireless technology, several inventors independently came up with photography at\nthe same time, among them the French inventors Joseph Niepce and Louis Daguerre, and British scientist\nWilliam Henry Fox Talbot. In the United States, George Eastman developed the Kodak camera in 1888,\nbanking on the hope that Americans would welcome an inexpensive, easy-to-use camera into their homes,\nas they had with the radio and telephone. Moving pictures were first seen around the turn of the century,\nwith the first U.S. projection hall opening in Pittsburgh in 1905. By the 1920s, Hollywood had already\ncreated its first stars, most notably Charlie Chaplin. By the end of the 1930s, Americans were watching\ncolor films with full sound, including Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.\nTelevision, which consists of an image being converted to electrical impulses, transmitted through wires\nor radio waves, and then reconverted into images, existed before World War II but really began to take off\nin the 1950s. In 1947, there were 178,000 television sets made in the United States; five years later, there\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n16 were 15 million. Radio, cinema, and live theater all saw a decline in the face of this new medium that\nallowed viewers to be entertained with sound and moving pictures without having to leave their homes.\nHow was this powerful new medium going to be operated? After much debate, the United States opted for\nthe market. Competing commercial stations (including the radio powerhouses of CBS and NBC) owned\nstations and sold advertising and commercial-driven programming dominated. Britain took another track\nwith its government-managed British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Funding was driven by licensing\nfees instead of advertisements. In contrast to the American system, the BBC strictly regulated the length\nand character of commercials that could be aired. U.S. television, propelled by prosperity, advertising and\nincreasingly powerful networks, flourished. By the beginning of 1955, there were 36 million television sets\nin the United States, and 4.8 million in all of Europe. [9] Important national events, broadcast live for the\nfirst time, were an impetus for consumers to buy sets and participate in the spectacle\u2014both England and\nJapan saw a boom in sales before important royal weddings in the 1950s.\nFigure 1.4\nIn the 1960s, the concept of a useful portable computer was still a dream; huge mainframes were\nrequired to run a basic operating system.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n17 For the last stage in this fast history of media technology, how\u2019s this for a prediction? In 1969,\nmanagement consultant Peter Drucker predicted that the next major technological innovation after\ntelevision would be an \u201celectronic appliance\u201d that would be \u201ccapable of being plugged in wherever there is\nelectricity and giving immediate access to all the information needed for school work from first grade\nthrough college.\u201d He said it would be the equivalent of Edison\u2019s light bulb in its ability to revolutionize\nhow we live. He had, in effect, predicted the computer. He was prescient about the effect that computers\nand the Internet would have on education, social relationships, and the culture at large. The inventions of\nrandom access memory (RAM) chips and microprocessors in the 1970s were important steps along the\nway to the Internet age. As Briggs and Burke note, these advances meant that \u201chundreds of thousands of\ncomponents could be carried on a microprocessor.\u201d The reduction of many different kinds of content to\ndigitally stored information meant that \u201cprint, film, recording, radio and television and all forms of\ntelecommunications [were] now being thought of increasingly as part of one complex.\u201d This process, also\nknown as convergence, will be discussed in later chapters and is a force that\u2019s shaping the face of media\ntoday.\nWhy Media? What Do Media Do for Us?\nEven a brief history of media can leave one breathless. The speed, reach, and power of the technology are\nhumbling. The evolution can seem almost natural and inevitable, but it is important to stop and ask a\nbasic question: Why? Why do media seem to play such an important role in our lives and our culture?\nWith reflection, we can see that media fulfill several basic roles.\nOne obvious role is entertainment. Media can act as a springboard for our imaginations, a source of\nfantasy, and an outlet for escapism. In the 19th century, Victorian readers, disillusioned by the grimness\nof the Industrial Revolution, found themselves drawn into books that offered fantastic worlds of fairies\nand other unreal beings. In the first decade of the 21st century, American television viewers could relax at\nthe end of a day by watching singers, both wonderful and terrible, compete to be idols or watch two\nfootball teams do battle. Media entertain and distract us in the midst of busy and hard lives.\nMedia can also provide information and education. Information can come in many forms, and often blurs\nthe line with entertainment. Today, newspapers and news-oriented television and radio programs make\navailable stories from across the globe, allowing readers or viewers in London to have access to voices and\nvideos from Baghdad, Tokyo, or Buenos Aires. Books and magazines provide a more in-depth look at a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n18 wide range of subjects. Online encyclopedias have articles on topics from presidential nicknames to child\nprodigies to tongue-twisters in various languages. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has\nposted free lecture notes, exams, and audio and video recordings of classes on its OpenCourseWare\nwebsite, allowing anyone with an Internet connection access to world-class professors.\nAnother useful aspect of media is its ability to act as a public forum for the discussion of important issues.\nIn newspapers or other periodicals, letters to the editor allow readers to respond to journalists, or voice\ntheir opinions on the issues of the day. These letters have been an important part of U.S. newspapers even\nwhen the nation was a British colony, and they have served as a means of public discourse ever since.\nBlogs, discussion boards, and online comments are modern forums. Indeed, the Internet can be seen as a\nfundamentally democratic medium that allows people who can get online the ability to put their voices out\nthere\u2014though whether anyone will hear is another question.\nMedia can also serve to monitor government, business, and other institutions. Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1906\nnovel The Jungle exposed the miserable conditions in the turn-of-the-century meatpacking industry. In\nthe early 1970s, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered evidence of the\nWatergate break-in and subsequent cover-up, which eventually led to the resignation of then-president\nRichard Nixon. Online journalists today try to uphold the \u201cwatchdog\u201d role of the media.\nThinking more deeply, we can recognize that certain media are better at certain roles. Media have\ncharacteristics that influence how we use them. While some forms of mass media are better suited to\nentertainment, others make more sense as a venue for spreading information. For example, in terms of\nprint media, books are durable and able to contain lots of information, but are relatively slow and\nexpensive to produce. In contrast, newspapers are comparatively cheaper and quicker to create, making\nthem a better medium for the quick turnover of daily news. Television provides vastly more visual\ninformation than radio, and is more dynamic than a static printed page; it can also be used to broadcast\nlive events to a nationwide audience, as in the annual State of the Union addresses given by the U.S.\npresident. However, it is also a one-way medium\u2014that is, it allows for very little direct person-to-person\ncommunication. In contrast, the Internet encourages public discussion of issues and allows nearly\neveryone who wants a voice to have one. However, the Internet is also largely unmoderated and\nuncurated. Users may have to wade through thousands of inane comments or misinformed amateur\nopinions in order to find quality information.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n19 As mentioned at the start of this chapter, the 1960s media theorist Marshall McLuhan took these ideas\none step further, with the phrase \u201cthe medium is the message.\u201d McLuhan emphasized that each medium\ndelivers information in a different way and that content is fundamentally shaped by that medium. For\nexample, although television news has the advantage of offering video and live coverage, making a story\ncome vividly alive, it is also a faster-paced medium. That means stories get reported in different ways than\nprint. A story told on television will often be more visual, have less information, and be able to offer less\nhistory and context than the same story covered in a monthly magazine. This feature of media technology\nleads to interesting arguments. For example, some people claim that television presents \u201cdumbed down\u201d\ninformation. Others disagree. In an essay about television\u2019s effects on contemporary fiction, writer David\nFoster Wallace scoffed at the \u201creactionaries who regard TV as some malignancy visited on an innocent\npopulace, sapping IQs and compromising SAT scores while we all sit there on ever fatter bottoms with\nlittle mesmerized spirals revolving in our eyes\u2026Treating television as evil is just as reductive and silly as\ntreating it like a toaster with pictures.\u201d [10]\nWe do not have to cast value judgments but can affirm: People who get the majority of their news from a\nparticular medium will have a particular view of the world shaped not just by the content of what they\nwatch but also by its medium. Or, as computer scientist Alan Kay put it, \u201cEach medium has a special way\nof representing ideas that emphasize particular ways of thinking and de-emphasize others.\u201d [11] The\nInternet has made this discussion even richer because it seems to hold all other media within it\u2014print,\nradio, film, television and more. If indeed the medium is the message, the Internet provides us with an\nextremely interesting message to consider.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the printing press enabled the mass production of media, which was then\nindustrialized by Friedrich Koenig in the early 1800s. These innovations enabled the daily newspaper,\nwhich united the urbanized, industrialized populations of the 19th century.\n\uf0b7 In the 20th century, radio allowed advertisers to reach a mass audience and helped spur the consumerism\nof the 1920s\u2014and the Great Depression of the 1930s. After World War II, television boomed in the\nUnited States and abroad, though its concentration in the hands of three major networks led to\naccusations of conformity. The spread of cable and subsequent deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s led\nto more channels, but not necessarily more diverse ownership.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n20 \uf0b7 Technological transitions have also had great effect on the media industry, although it is difficult to say\nwhether technology caused a cultural shift or rather resulted from it. The ability to make technology small\nand affordable enough to fit into the home is an important aspect of the popularization of new\ntechnologies.\n\uf0b7 Media fulfill several roles in culture, including the following:\no Entertaining and providing an outlet for the imagination\no Educating and informing\no Serving as a public forum for the discussion of important issues\no Acting as a watchdog for government, business, and other institutions\nEXERCISE\nChoose two different types of mass communication\u2014radio shows, television broadcasts, Internet sites,\nnewspaper advertisements, and so on from two different kinds of media. Make a list of what role(s) each\none fills, keeping in mind that much of what we see, hear, or read in the mass media has more than one\naspect. Consider the following questions: Does the type of media suit the social role? Why did the creators\nof this particular message present it in the particular way, and in this particular medium?\n[1] Journalism.org, The State of the News Media 2004,http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/ (accessed July 15,\n2010); Jim Bilton, \u201cThe Loyalty Challenge: How Magazine Subscriptions Work,\u201d In Circulation, January/February\n2007.\n[2] Doug Ramsey, \u201cUC San Diego Experts Calculate How Much Information Americans Consume.\u201d University of San\nDiego News Center, December 9, 2009.\n[3] Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet(Malden, MA: Polity\nPress, 2005).\n[4] Digital History, \u201cThe Formation of Modern American Mass Culture,\u201d The Jazz Age: The American 1920s,\n2007, http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?hhid=454 (accessed July 15, 2010).\n[5] Library of Congress, \u201cRadio: A Consumer Product and a Producer of Consumption,\u201d\nhttp://lcweb2.loc.gov:8081/ammem/amrlhtml/inradio.html (accessed July 15, 2010).\n[6] Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet (Malden, MA: Polity\nPress, 2005).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n21 [7] Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet (Malden, MA: Polity\nPress, 2005).\n[8] Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet (Malden, MA: Polity\nPress, 2005).\n[9] Asa Briggs and Peter Burke, A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet (Malden, MA: Polity\nPress, 2005).\n[10] David Foster Wallace, A Supposedly Fun Thing I\u2019ll Never Do Again (New York: Little Brown, 1997).\n[11] Alan Kay, \u201cThe Infobahn is Not the Answer,\u201d Wired, May 1994.\n1.3\nHow Did We Get Here? The Evolution of Culture\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Define cultural period, and give examples of recent cultural periods.\n2. Discuss particular characteristics of the modern era, and explain how it was shaped by the Industrial\nRevolution.\n3. Explain the ways that the postmodern era differs from the modern era.\nWe have spoken easily of historical eras. Can we speak of cultural eras? It can actually be a useful\nconcept. There are many ways to divide time into cultural eras. But for our purposes,\na cultural period is a time marked by a particular way of understanding the world through culture and\ntechnology. Changes in cultural periods are marked by fundamental changes in the way we perceive\nand understand the world. For example, you may have had readings about the \u201cMiddle Ages,\u201d a\nmarker for European history from the 5th to 15th Century. In that era, technology and\ncommunication were in the hands of authorities like the king and church who could dictate what was\n\u201ctrue.\u201d The Renaissance, the era that followed the Middle Ages, turned to the scientific method as a\nmeans of reaching truth through reason. This change in cultural period was galvanized by the\nprinting press. (In 2008, Wired magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief proclaimed that the application of\nInternet technology through Google was about to render the scientific method obsolete. [1]) In each of\nthese cultural eras, the nature of truth had not changed. What had changed was the way that humans\nused available technology to make sense of the world.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n22 Using technology to make sense of the world? You likely can anticipate that for the purpose of\nstudying culture and mass media, the modern and postmodern ages are some of the most exciting\nand relevant ones to explore, eras in which culture and technology have intersected like never before.\nThe Modern Age\u2014Modernity\nThe Modern Age is the post-Medieval era, beginning roughly after the 14th century, a wide span of time\nmarked in part by technological innovations, urbanization, scientific discoveries, and globalization. The\nModern Age is generally split into two parts: the early and the late modern periods. Scholars often talk of\nthe Modern Age as modernity.\nThe early modern period began with Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the movable type printing press in the late\n15th century and ended in the late 18th century. Thanks to Gutenberg\u2019s press, the European population of\nthe early modern period saw rising literacy rates, which led to educational reform. As noted earlier,\nGutenberg\u2019s machine also greatly enabled the spread of knowledge, and in turn spurred the Renaissance\nand the Protestant Reformation. During the early modern period, transportation improved, politics\nbecame more secularized, capitalism spread, nation-states grew more powerful, and information became\nmore widely accessible. Enlightenment ideals of reason, rationalism, and faith in scientific inquiry slowly\nbegan to replace the previously dominant authority of king and church.\nHuge political, social, and economic changes marked the end of the 18th century and the beginning of\nthe late modern period. The Industrial Revolution, which began in England around 1750, combined with\nthe American Revolution in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789, indicated that the world was\nundergoing massive changes. The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences. It did not merely\nchange the way goods were produced\u2014it also fundamentally changed the economic, social, and cultural\nframework of its time.\nThe Industrial Revolution doesn\u2019t have clear start or end dates. However, during the 19th century, several\ncrucial inventions\u2014the internal combustion engine, steam-powered ships, and railways, among others\u2014\nled to other innovations across various industries. Suddenly, steam power and machine tools meant that\nproduction increased dramatically. But some of the biggest changes coming out of the Industrial\nRevolution were social in character. An economy based on manufacturing instead of agriculture meant\nthat more people moved to cities, where techniques of mass production led to an emphasis on efficiency\nboth in and out of the factory. Newly urbanized factory laborers no longer had the skill or time to produce\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n23 their own food, clothing, or supplies and instead turned to consumer goods. Increased production led to\nincreases in wealth, though income inequalities between classes also started to grow as well. Increased\nwealth and nonrural lifestyles led to the development of entertainment industries. Life changed rapidly.\nIt is no coincidence that the French and American Revolutions happened in the midst of the Industrial\nRevolution. The huge social changes created changes in political systems and thinking. In both France and\nAmerica, the revolutions were inspired by a rejection of a monarchy in favor of national sovereignty and\nrepresentative democracy. Both revolutions also heralded the rise of secular society, as opposed to\nchurch-based authority systems. Democracy was well-suited to the so-called Age of Reason, with its ideals\nof individual rights and its belief in progress.\nMedia were central to these revolutions. As we have seen, the fusing of steam power and the printing\npress enabled the explosive expansion of books and newspapers. Literacy rates rose, as did support for\npublic participation in politics. More and more people lived in the city, had an education, got their news\nfrom the newspaper, spent their wages on consumer goods, and identified themselves as citizens of an\nindustrialized nation. Urbanization, mass literacy, and new forms of mass media contributed to a sense of\nmass culture that united people across regional, social, and cultural boundaries.\nA last note on the terminology for the cultural era of the Modern Age or modernity: A similar term\u2014\nmodernism\u2014also has come into use. However, modernism is a term for an artistic, cultural movement,\nrather than era. Modernism refers to the artistic movement of late-19th and early-20th centuries that\narose out of the widespread changes that swept the world during that period. Most notably, modernism\nquestioned the limitations of \u201ctraditional\u201d forms of art and culture. Modernist art was in part a reaction\nagainst the Enlightenment\u2019s certainty of progress and rationality. It celebrated subjectivity through\nabstraction, experimentalism, surrealism, and sometimes pessimism or even nihilism. Prominent\nexamples of modernist works include James Joyce\u2019s stream-of-consciousness novels, cubist paintings by\nPicasso, atonal compositions by Debussy, and absurdist plays by Pirandello. It\u2019s not too confusing\u2014\nmodernism was an artistic movement taking place during the modern age.\nThe Postmodern Age\nIf you go on to graduate study in almost any field in the humanities or social sciences, you will eventually\nencounter texts debating the postmodern era. While the exact definition and dates of\nthe postmodern era are still debated by cultural theorists and philosophers, the general consensus is that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n24 the postmodern era began during the second half of the 20th century, and was marked by skepticism, self-\nconsciousness, celebration of difference, and the reappraisal of modern conventions. Modernity\u2014the\nModern Age\u2014took for granted scientific rationalism, the autonomous self, and the inevitability of\nprogress. The postmodern age questioned or dismissed many of these assumptions. If the modern age\nvalued order, reason, stability, and absolute truth, the postmodern age reveled in contingency,\nfragmentation, and instability. The aftermath of World War II, the Holocaust, the Cold War, the\ndigitization of culture, the rise of the Internet, and numerous other factors fed into the skepticism and\nself-consciousness of the postmodern era.\nModernity\u2019s belief in objective truth is one of the major assumptions turned on its head in the postmodern\nera. Postmodernists instead took their cues from Schr\u00f6dinger, the quantum physicist who famously\ndevised a thought experiment in which a cat is placed inside a sealed box with a small amount of radiation\nthat may or may not kill it. (Remember, this is a thought experiment, and is not real.) While the box\nremains sealed, Schr\u00f6dinger proclaimed, the cat exists simultaneously in both states, dead and alive. Both\npotential states are equally true. Although the thought experiment was devised to explore issues in\nquantum physics, it appealed to postmodernists in its assertion of radical uncertainty. What is reality?\nRather than being an absolute objective truth, accessible by rational procedures and experimentation, the\nstatus of reality was contingent, and depended on the observer.\n\u201cThe postmodern\u201d affected fields from philosophy to political science to literature. Novelists and poets, for\nexample, embraced this new approach to reality. While Victorian novelists took pains to make their books\nseem more \u201creal,\u201d postmodern narratives distrusted professions of \u201creality\u201d and constantly reminded\nreaders of the artificial nature of the story they were reading. The emphasis was not on the all-knowing\nauthor but instead on the reader. For the postmodernists, meaning was not injected into a work by its\ncreator, but depended on the reader\u2019s subjective experience of the work.\nAnother way postmodernity differed from modernity was in its rejection of what philosopher Jean-\nFrancois Lyotard deemed \u201cgrand narratives.\u201d The Modern Age was marked by different large-scale\ntheories that attempted to explain the totality of human experience, including theories of capitalism,\nMarxism, rationalism, Freudianism, Darwinism, fascism, and so on. But the postmodern era called into\nquestion the sorts of theories that claimed to explain everything at once. Such thinking, postmodernists\nwarned, led to 20th-century totalitarian regimes, such as Hitler\u2019s Third Reich and the USSR under Stalin.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n25 The postmodern age, Lyotard theorized, was one of micro-narratives instead of grand narratives\u2014that is,\na multiplicity of small, localized understandings of the world, none of which can claim an ultimate or\nabsolute truth. The diversity of human experience also was a marked feature of the postmodern world. As\nLyotard noted, \u201ceclecticism is the degree zero of contemporary general culture; one listens to reggae,\nwatches a Western, eats McDonald\u2019s food for lunch and local cuisine for dinner, wears Paris perfume in\nTokyo and retro clothes in Hong Kong; knowledge is a matter for TV games.\u201d [2]\nPostmodernists even mistrusted the idea of originality\u2014the supposed arrogance of thinking one had a\n\u201cnew thought\u201d\u2014and freely borrowed across cultures and genres. William S. Burroughs gleefully\nproclaimed a sort of call-to-arms for his postmodern generation of writers in 1985: \u201cOut of the closets and\ninto the museums, libraries, architectural monuments, concert halls, bookstores, recording studios and\nfilm studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated thief.\u2026Words, colors, light,\nsounds, stone, wood, bronze belong to the living artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the\nLouvre! A bas l\u2019originalit\u00e9 (down with originality), the sterile and assertive ego that imprisons us as it\ncreates. Vive le sol (long live the sun)-pure, shameless, total. We are not responsible. Steal anything in\nsight.\u201d Burroughs\u2019s words embodied the mixed skepticism and glee that marked the postmodern era. As\nthe new millennium began, Bob Dylan\u2019s album, \u201cLove and Theft,\u201d carried on Burroughs\u2019s tradition. Its\ntitle and many of its lyrics are taken from numerous sources across cultures, eras and fields.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 A cultural period is a time marked by a particular way of understanding the world through culture and\ntechnology. Changes in cultural periods are marked by fundamental changes in the way we perceive and\nunderstand the world. The modern era began after the Middle Ages and lasted through the early decades\nof the 20th century, when the postmodern era began.\n\uf0b7 The modern era was marked by Enlightenment philosophy, which focused on the individual and placed a\nhigh value on rational decision making. This period saw the wide expansion of capitalism, colonialism,\ndemocracy, and science-based rationalism. The Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the American\nand French Revolutions, and World War I are all significant events that took place during the modern era.\nOne of the most significant, however, was the Industrial Revolution; its emphasis on routinization and\nefficiency helped society restructure itself along those terms as well.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n26 \uf0b7 Postmodernity differed from modernity in its questioning of reason, rejection of grand narratives, and\nemphasis on subcultures. Rather than searching for one ultimate truth that could explain all of history,\nthe postmodernists focused on contingency, context, and diversity.\nEXERCISE\nDraw a Venn diagram of the two cultural periods discussed at length in this chapter. Make a list of the\nfeatures, values, and events that mark each period. Is there any overlap? How do they differ?\n[1] Chris Anderson, \u201cThe End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete,\u201d Wired, June 23,\n2008, http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory (accessed July 15, 2010).\n[2] Jean-Francois Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge (Minneapolis: University of\nMinnesota Press, 1984).\n1.4\nMedia Mix: Convergence\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Define convergence and discuss examples of it in contemporary life.\n2. Name the five types of convergence identified by Henry Jenkins.\n3. Examine how convergence is affecting culture and society.\nEach cultural era is marked by changes in technology. What happens to the \u201cold\u201d technology? When\nradio was invented, people predicted the end of newspapers. When television was invented, people\npredicted the end of radio and film. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the implementation of new\ntechnologies does not mean that the old ones simply vanish into dusty museums. Today\u2019s media\nconsumers still read newspapers, listen to radio, watch television, and get immersed in movies. The\ndifference is that it\u2019s now possible to do all those things and do all those things through one device\u2014\nbe it a personal computer or a smartphone\u2014and through the medium of the Internet. Such actions\nare enabled by media convergence, the process by which previously distinct technologies come to\nshare content, tasks and resources. A cell phone that also takes pictures and video is an example of\nthe convergence of digital photography, digital video, and cellular telephone technologies. A news\nstory that originally appeared in a newspaper and now is published on a website or pushed on a\nmobile phone is another example of convergence.\nKinds of Convergence\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n27 Convergence isn\u2019t just limited to technology. Media theorist Henry Jenkins has devoted a lot of time to\nthinking about convergence. He argues that convergence isn\u2019t an end result but instead a process that\nchanges how media is both consumed and produced. Jenkins breaks convergence down into five\ncategories:\n1. Economic convergence is the horizontal and vertical integration of the entertainment industry, in\nwhich a single company has interests across and within many kinds of media. For example, Rupert\nMurdoch\u2019s News Corporation owns numerous newspapers (The New York Post, The Wall Street\nJournal) but is also involved in book publishing (HarperCollins), sports (the Colorado Rockies),\nbroadcast television (Fox), cable television (FX, National Geographic Channel), film (20th Century\nFox), Internet (Facebook), and many others.\n2. Organic convergence is what happens when someone is watching television while chatting online and\nalso listening to music\u2014such multitasking seems like a natural outcome in a diverse media world.\n3. Cultural convergence has several different aspects. One important component is stories flowing\nacross several kinds of media platforms\u2014for example, novels that become television series\n(Dexter or Friday Night Lights); radio dramas that become comic strips (The Shadow); even\namusement park rides that become film franchises (Pirates of the Caribbean). The character Harry\nPotter exists in books, films, toys, amusement park rides, and candy bars. Another aspect of cultural\nconvergence is participatory culture\u2014that is, the way media consumers are able to annotate, comment\non, remix, and otherwise talk back to culture in unprecedented ways.\nFigure 1.5\nNigeria\u2019s Nollywood produces more films annually than any other country besides India.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n28 4. Global convergence is the process of geographically distant cultures influencing one another despite\nthe oceans and mountains that may physically separate them. Nigeria\u2019s \u201cNollywood\u201d cinema takes its\ncues from India\u2019s Bollywood, which of course stemmed from Hollywood; old Tom and Jerry cartoons\nand newer Oprah shows are popular on Arab satellite television channels; successful American horror\nmovies like The Ring and The Grudge are remakes of Japanese hits; the hit television show,\n\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d was a remake of a British show. The advantage of global convergence is worldwide\naccess to a wealth of cultural influence. Its downside, some critics posit, is the threat\nof cultural imperialism, defined by Herbert Schiller as the way that developing countries are\n\u201cattracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to,\nor even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system.\u201d That is, less\npowerful nations lose their cultural traditions as more powerful nations spread their culture through\ntheir media and other forms. Cultural imperialism can be a formal policy or can happen more subtly,\nas with the spread of outside influence through television, movies, and other cultural projects.\n5. Technological convergence is the merging of technologies. When more and more different kinds of\nmedia are transformed into digital content, as Jenkins notes, \u201cwe expand the potential relationships\nbetween them and enable them to flow across platforms.\u201d [1]\nEffects of Convergence\nJenkins\u2019 concept of \u201corganic convergence\u201d\u2014particularly, multitasking\u2014is perhaps most evident in your\nown lives. To many who grew up in a world dominated by so-called old media, there is nothing organic\nabout today\u2019s mediated world. As a New York Times editorial sniffed, \u201cFew objects on the planet are\nfarther removed from nature\u2014less, say, like a rock or an insect\u2014than a glass and stainless steel\nsmartphone.\u201d [2] But modern American culture is plugged in as never before, and many students today\nhave never known a world where the Internet didn\u2019t exist. Such a cultural sea change causes a significant\ngeneration gap between those who grew up with new media and those who didn\u2019t.\nA 2010 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that Americans aged 8 to 18 spend more than 7.5\nhours with electronic devices each day\u2014and, thanks to multitasking, they\u2019re able to pack an average of 11\nhours of media content into that 7.5 hours. [3] These statistics highlight some of the aspects of the new\ndigital model of media consumption: participation and multitasking. Today\u2019s teenagers aren\u2019t passively\nsitting in front of screens, quietly absorbing information. Instead, they are sending text messages to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n29 friends, linking news articles on Facebook, commenting on YouTube videos, writing reviews of television\nepisodes to post online, and generally engaging with the culture they consume. Convergence has also\nmade multitasking much easier, as many devices allow users to surf the Internet, listen to music, watch\nvideos, play games, and reply to emails and texts on the same machine.\nHowever, this multitasking is still quite new and we do not know how media convergence and immersion\nare shaping culture, people, and individual brains. In his 2005 book Everything Bad Is Good for You,\nSteven Johnson argues that today\u2019s television and video games are mentally stimulating, in that they pose\na cognitive challenge and invite active engagement and problem-solving. Poking fun at alarmists who see\nevery new technology as making children more stupid, Johnson jokingly cautions readers against the\ndangers of book reading: it \u201cchronically understimulates the senses\u201d and is \u201ctragically isolating.\u201d Even\nworse, books \u201cfollow a fixed linear path. You can\u2019t control their narratives in any fashion\u2014you simply sit\nback and have the story dictated to you.\u2026This risks instilling a general passivity in our children, making\nthem feel as though they\u2019re powerless to change their circumstances. Reading is not an active,\nparticipatory process; it\u2019s a submissive one.\u201d [4]\nA 2010 book by Nicholas Carr, The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains is more\npessimistic. Carr worries that the vast array of interlinked information available through the Internet is\neroding attention spans and making contemporary minds distracted and less capable of deep, thoughtful\nengagement with complex ideas and arguments. He mourns the change in his own reading habits. \u201cOnce I\nwas a scuba diver in a sea of words,\u201d Carr reflects ruefully. \u201cNow I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet\nSki.\u201d Carr cites neuroscience studies showing that when people try to do two things at once, they give less\nattention to each and perform the tasks less carefully. In other words, multitasking makes us do a greater\nnumber of things poorly. Whatever the ultimate cognitive, social, or technological results, though,\nconvergence is changing the way we relate to media today.\nVideo Killed the Radio Star: Convergence Kills Off Obsolete Technology\u2014\nOr Does It?\nWhen was the last time you used a rotary phone? How about a payphone on a street? Or a library\u2019s card\ncatalog? When you need brief, factual information, when was the last time you reached for a handy\nvolume of Encyclopedia Britannica? Odds are, it\u2019s been a while. Maybe never. All of these habits,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n30 formerly common parts of daily life, have been rendered essentially obsolete through the progression of\nconvergence.\nBut convergence hasn\u2019t erased old technologies; instead, it may have just altered the way we use them.\nTake cassette tapes and Polaroid film, for example. The underground music tastemaker Thurston Moore\nof Sonic Youth recently claimed that he only listens to music on cassette. Polaroid Corporation, creators of\nthe once-popular instant film cameras, was driven out of business by digital photography in 2008, only to\nbe revived two years later\u2014with pop star Lady Gaga as the brand\u2019s creative director. Several iPhone apps\npromise to apply effects to photos to make them look more like Polaroids.\nCassettes, Polaroids, and other seemingly obsolete technologies have been able to thrive\u2014albeit in niche\nmarkets\u2014both despite and because of Internet culture. Instead of being slick and digitized, cassette tapes\nand Polaroid photos are physical objects that are made more accessible and more human, according to\nenthusiasts, because of their flaws. \u201cI think there\u2019s a group of people\u2014fans and artists alike\u2014out there to\nwhom music is more than just a file on your computer, more than just a folder of mp3s,\u201d says Brad Rose,\nfounder of a Tulsa-based cassette label. The distinctive Polaroid look\u2014caused by uneven color saturation,\nunder- or over-development, or just daily atmospheric effects on the developing photograph\u2014is\nemphatically analog. In an age of high resolution, portable printers, and camera phones, the Polaroid\u2019s\nappeal has something to do with ideas of nostalgia and authenticity. Convergence has transformed who\nuses these media and for what purposes, but it hasn\u2019t run them out of town yet.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Twenty-first century media culture is increasingly marked by convergence, or the coming together of\npreviously distinct technologies, as in a cell phone that also allows users to take video and check email.\n\uf0b7 Media theorist Henry Jenkins identifies the five kinds of convergence as the following:\n1. Economic convergence, when a single company has interests across many kinds of media.\n2. Organic convergence is multimedia multitasking, or the \u201cnatural\u201d outcome of a diverse media world.\n3. Cultural convergence, when stories flow across several kinds of media platforms, and when readers or\nviewers can comment on, alter, or otherwise talk back to culture.\n4. Global convergence, when geographically distant cultures are able to influence one another.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n31 5. Technological convergence, in which different kinds of technology merge. The most extreme example of\ntechnological convergence would be the as-yet hypothetical \u201cblack box,\u201d one machine that controlled\nevery media function.\n\uf0b7 The jury is still out on how these different types of convergence will affect people on an individual and\ncultural level. Some theorists believe that convergence and new media technologies make people smarter\nby requiring them to make decisions and interact with the media they\u2019re consuming; others fear that the\ndigital age is giving us access to more information but leaving us shallower.\nEXERCISE\nWhich argument do you find more compelling, Johnson\u2019s or Carr\u2019s? Make a list of points, examples, and\nfacts that back up the theory that you think best explains the effects of convergence. Alternatively, come\nup with your own theory of how convergence is changing individual and society as a whole.

Name and discuss two limitations on free speech that are based on cultural values.\n2. Identify examples of propaganda in mass media.\n3. Define gatekeeper, and explain the role of the gatekeeper in mass media.\nIn a 1995 Wired magazine article, Jon Katz suggested that the Revolutionary War patriot Thomas\nPaine should be held up as \u201cthe moral father of the Internet.\u201d The Internet, Katz wrote, \u201coffers what\nPaine and his revolutionary colleagues hoped for\u2014a vast, diverse, passionate, global means of\ntransmitting ideas and opening minds.\u201d In fact, according to Katz, the emerging Internet era is closer\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n32 in spirit to the 18th-century media world than the 20th-century\u2019s so-called old media (radio,\ntelevision, print). \u201cThe ferociously spirited press of the late 1700s\u2026was dominated by individuals\nexpressing their opinions. The idea that ordinary citizens with no special resources, expertise, or\npolitical power\u2014like Paine himself\u2014could sound off, reach wide audiences, even spark revolutions,\nwas brand-new to the world.\u201d [1]\nAs we continue our introduction to understanding media and culture, Katz\u2019s impassioned defense of\nPaine\u2019s plucky independence reminds us of how cultural values shape media. Paine\u2019s values led to his\nbooks and pamphlets that helped lead to a new nation. In all eras, cultural values shape the way\nmedia are created, used, and controlled. Keeping Katz\u2019s words in mind, we can ask ourselves further\nquestions about the role of cultural values in our media today. How do cultural values shape our\nmedia and mass communication? And how, in turn, do media and mass communication shape our\nvalues? We\u2019ll start with a key American cultural value: free speech.\nFree Speech as Cultural Value\nThe value of free speech is central to American mass communication, and has been since the nation\u2019s\nrevolutionary founding. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s very first amendment guarantees the freedom of speech\nand of the press. Thanks to the First Amendment and subsequent statutes, the United States has some of\nthe broadest protections on speech of any industrialized nation. We can see the value that American\nculture places on free speech. However, speech and the press are not always free\u2014cultural values have\nplaced limits and those limits, like values, have shifted over time.\nObscenity, for example, has not often been tolerated. Indeed, the very definition of obscenity has shifted\nover time with the nation\u2019s changing social attitudes. James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, ranked by the Modern\nLibrary as the best English-language novel of the 20th century, was illegal to publish in the United States\nbetween 1922 and 1934. The 1954 Supreme Court case, Roth v. The United States, tried to lessen\nrestrictions and defined obscenity more narrowly. It allowed for differences depending on \u201ccommunity\nstandards.\u201d Obscenity became even more of an issue during the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Cultural\nchanges of that era made it even more difficult to pin down just what was obscene and what was meant by\n\u201ccommunity standards.\u201d Today, obscenity continues its tug-of-war with cultural values. Sexually explicit\nmagazines, such as Playboy, are available in nearly every U.S. airport, but pornography on the Internet is\nstill a subject of concern.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n33 Copyright law also puts limits on free speech. Here we see a conflict between cultural values of free speech\nand the right to protect your creative rights. Intellectual property law was originally intended to protect\njust that\u2014the proprietary rights, both economic and intellectual, of the originator of a creative work.\nWorks under copyright can\u2019t be reproduced without the authorization of the creator, nor can anyone else\nuse them to make a profit. Inventions, novels, musical tunes, and even phrases can all be covered by\ncopyright law. The first copyright statute in the United States set 14 years as the maximum term for\ncopyright protection. This number has risen exponentially in the 20th century; some works are now\ncopyright protected for up to 120 years. In recent years, an Internet culture that enables file sharing,\nmixing, mash-ups, and YouTube parodies has raised questions about copyright. Can you refer to a\ncopyrighted work? What is fair use of a copyrighted work? The exact line between what expressions are\nprotected or prohibited by law are still being set by courts; and as the changing values of the U.S. public\nevolve, copyright law\u2014like obscenity law\u2014will continue to change as well.\nPersuasion and Cultural Values\nCultural values also shape mass media messages when producers of media content have vested interests\nin particular social goals. The producers offer media content that promotes or refutes particular\nviewpoints. Governments, corporations, nonprofits, colleges, indeed most organizations, all try to shape\nmedia content to promote themselves and their values. In its most heavy-handed form, at the level of\ngovernment, this type of media influence can become propaganda, communication that intentionally\nattempts to persuade its audience for ideological, political, or commercial purposes. Propaganda often\n(but not always) distorts the truth, selectively presents facts, or uses emotional appeals. In war time,\npropaganda often includes caricatures of the enemy.\nDuring World War I, for example, the U.S. government created the Creel Commission to act as a sort of\npublic relations agency for the American entry into the war. The commission used radio, movies, posters,\nand in-person speakers to present a positive slant on the American war effort and demonize the opposing\nGermans. George Creel, chairman of the commission, acknowledged the committee\u2019s attempt at\ninfluencing the public, but he shied away from calling its work propaganda:\nIn no degree was the committee an agency of censorship, a machinery of concealment or repression.\u2026In\nall things, from first to last, without halt or change, it was a plain publicity proposition, a vast enterprise\nin salesmanship, the world\u2019s greatest adventures in advertising\u2026We did not call it propaganda, for that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n34 word, in German hands, had come to be associated with deceit and corruption. Our effort was educational\nand informative throughout, for we had such confidence in our case as to feel that no other argument was\nneeded than the simple, straightforward presentation of the facts. [2]\nFigure 1.7\nWorld War I propaganda posters were sometimes styled to resemble movie posters in an attempt to glamorize the\nwar effort.\nOf course, the line between the selective (but \u201cstraightforward\u201d) presentation of the truth and the\nmanipulation of propaganda is not an obvious or distinct one. (Another of the commission\u2019s members was\nlater deemed \u201cthe father of public relations\u201d and authored a book titled Propaganda.) Advertisers craft\nmessages so viewers want to buy their products. Some news sources, such as cable news channels or\npolitical blogs, have an explicit political slant. For our purposes, we simply want to keep in mind how\ncultural values shape much media content.\nThe Cultural Value of Gatekeepers\nIn 1960, journalist A. J. Liebling wryly observed that \u201cfreedom of the press is guaranteed only to those\nwho own one.\u201d Although he may not have put it in those terms, Liebling was talking about the role of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n35 gatekeepers in the media industry, another way in which cultural values influence mass communication.\nGatekeepers are the people who help determine which stories make it to the public, including reporters\nwho decide what sources to use, and editors who pick what gets published and which stories make it to the\nfront page. Media gatekeepers are part of culture and thus have their own cultural values, whether\nconsciously or unconsciously. In deciding what counts as newsworthy, entertaining, or relevant,\ngatekeepers use their own values to create and shape what gets presented to the wider public. Conversely,\ngatekeepers may decide that some events are unimportant or uninteresting to consumers. Those events\nmay never reach the eyes or ears of a larger public.\nIn one striking example of how cultural values shape gatekeeping, journalist Allan Thompson points to\nthe news media\u2019s sluggishness in covering the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Almost one million people were\nkilled in ferocious attacks in just 100 days. Yet, as Thompson notes, few foreign correspondents were in\nAfrica, and the world was slow to learn of the atrocities in Rwanda. Instead, the nightly news was\npreoccupied by the O. J. Simpson murder trial, Tonya Harding\u2019s attack on a fellow figure skater, or the\nless-bloody conflict in Bosnia (a European country, where more reporters were stationed). Thompson\nargues that the lack of international media attention allowed politicians to remain complacent. With little\nmedia coverage, there was little outrage about the Rwandan atrocities, which contributed to a lack of\npolitical will to invest time and troops in a faraway conflict. Richard Dowden, Africa Editor for the British\nnewspaper The Independent during the Rwandan genocide, bluntly explained the news media\u2019s larger\nreluctance to focus on African issues: \u201cAfrica was simply not important. It didn\u2019t sell newspapers.\nNewspapers have to make profits. So it wasn\u2019t important. Cultural values by gatekeepers on the individual\nand institutional level downplayed the genocide at a time of great crisis, and potentially contributed to the\ndeaths of hundreds of thousands of people.\u201d [3]\nGatekeepers had an especially strong influence in old media, in which space and time were limited. A\nnews broadcast could only last for its allotted half hour, 22 minutes with commercials, while a newspaper\nhad a set number of pages to print. The Internet, in contrast, has room for infinite news reports. The\ninteractive nature of the medium also minimizes the gatekeeper function of the media by allowing media\nconsumers to have a voice as well. News aggregators like Digg.com allow readers to decide what makes it\non to the front page. That is not to say that the wisdom or cultural values of the crowd is always wise\u2014\nrecent top stories on Digg have featured headlines like \u201cTop 5 Hot Girls Playing Video Games\u201d and \u201cThe\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n36 girl who must eat every 15 minutes to stay alive.\u201d Media expert Mark Glaser noted that the digital age\nhasn\u2019t eliminated gatekeepers; it\u2019s just shifted who they are: \u201cthe editors who pick featured artists and\napps at the Apple iTunes store, who choose videos to spotlight on YouTube, and who highlight Suggested\nUsers on Twitter,\u201d among others. And unlike traditional media, these new gatekeepers rarely have public\nbylines, making it difficult to figure out who makes such decisions and on what basis. [4]\nObserving how distinct cultures and subcultures present the same story can be indicative of those\ncultures\u2019 various cultural values. Another way to look critically at today\u2019s media messages is to examine\nhow the media has functioned in the world and in the United States during different cultural periods.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 American culture puts a high value on free speech; however, other cultural values sometimes take\nprecedence. Shifting ideas about what constitutes obscenity, a kind of speech that is not legally protected\nby the First Amendment, is a good example of how cultural values impact mass communication\u2014and of\nhow those values change over time. Copyright law, another restriction put on free speech, has had a\nsimilar evolution over the nation\u2019s history.\n\uf0b7 Propaganda is a message that attempts to persuade its audience for ideological, political, or social\npurposes. Some propaganda is obvious, explicit, and manipulative; however, advertising and public\nrelations also are persuasive strategies that try to influence audiences.\n\uf0b7 Gatekeepers influence culture by deciding what stories are considered newsworthy. Gatekeepers can\npromote cultural values either consciously or unconsciously. The digital age has lessened the power of\ngatekeepers somewhat, as the Internet allows for nearly unlimited space to cover any number of events\nand stories.\nEXERCISES\n1. Find an advertisement\u2014either in print, broadcast, or online\u2014that you have recently found to be\nmemorable. Now find a non-advertisement media message. Compare and contrast the ways that the ad\nand the non-ad express cultural values. Are the cultural values the same for each of them? Is the\ninfluence overt or covert? Why did the message\u2019s creators choose to present their message in this way?\n2. Go to a popular website that uses user-uploaded content (YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, Metafilter, etc.). Look\nat the content on the site\u2019s homepage. Can you tell how this particular content was selected to be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n37 featured? Does the website list a policy for featured content? What factors do you think go into the\nselection process?\n[1] Jon Katz, \u201cThe Age of Paine,\u201d Wired, May 1995,\nhttp://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.05/paine.html (accessed July 15, 2010).\n[2] George Creel, How We Advertised America (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1920).\n[3] POLISMedia, \u201cThe Media and the Rwanda Genocide,\u201d Lecture Delivered at The Crisis States Research Centre\nand POLIS at the London School of Economics, January 17, 2007,\nhttp://www.polismedia.org/rwandatranscript.aspx (accessed July 15, 2010).\n[4] Mark Glaser, \u201cNew Gatekeepers Twitter, Apple, YouTube Need Transparent Editorial Picks,\u201d PBS Mediashift,\nMarch 26 2009.\n1.6\nMass Media and Popular Culture\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Define tastemakers, and give examples of their influence in traditional media.\n2. Examine the ways the digital age is undermining the traditional role of tastemakers.\n3. Analyze how Internet culture now allows creators to bypass gatekeepers, and discuss the potential effects\nof this.\nIn 1850, an epidemic swept America\u2014but instead of leaving victims sick with fever or flu, this was a\nrabid craze for the music of Swedish soprano Jenny Lind. American showman P. T. Barnum (who\nwould later go on to found the circus we now know as Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus), a\nshrewd marketer and self-made millionaire, is credited with spreading \u201cLindomania\u201d through a\nseries of astute show-business moves. Barnum promised Lind an unprecedented thousand-dollar-a-\nnight fee (the equivalent of close to $30,000 in today\u2019s dollars) for her entire 93-performance tour of\nthe United States. Ever the savvy self-promoter, Barnum turned this huge investment to his\nadvantage, using it to drum up publicity\u2014and it paid off. When the Swedish soprano\u2019s ship docked\non U.S. shores, she was greeted by 40,000 ardent fans; another 20,000 swarmed her hotel. Congress\nwas adjourned during Lind\u2019s visit to Washington, DC, where the National Theater had to be enlarged\nin order to accommodate her audiences. A town in California and an island in Canada were named in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n38 her honor. Enthusiasts could purchase Jenny Lind hats, chairs, boots, opera glasses, and even\npianos.\nA little more than a century later, a new craze transformed American teenagers into screaming,\nfainting Beatle-maniacs. When the British foursome touched down at Kennedy Airport in 1964, they\nwere met by more than 3,000 frenzied fans. Their performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was seen by\n73 million people, or 40 percent of the U.S. population. The crime rate that night dropped to its\nlowest level in 50 years. Beatlemania was at such a fever pitch that Life magazine cautioned that \u201cA\nBeatle who ventures out unguarded into the streets runs the very real peril of being dismembered or\ncrushed to death by his fans.\u201d [1] The BBC helpfully pointed out that there was plenty of paraphrenalia\nfor true fans to spend their money on: \u201cT-shirts, sweat shirts, turtle-neck sweaters, tight-legged\ntrousers, night shirts, scarves, and jewellery inspired by the Beatles\u201d were all available, as were\nBeatles-style moptop wigs.\nIn the 21st century, rabid fans could actually help decide the next pop stars through the reality\ntelevision program American Idol. Derived from a British show, American Idol hit the airwaves in\n2002 and became the only television program ever to earn the top spot in the Neilsen ratings for six\nseasons in a row, often averaging more than 30 million nightly viewers. Rival television networks\nquaked in fear, deeming the pop behemoth \u201cthe ultimate schoolyard bully,\u201d \u201cthe Death Star,\u201d or even\n\u201cthe most impactful show in the history of television.\u201d [2]Newspapers put developments on the show\non their front pages. New cell phone technologies allowed viewers to have a direct role in the\nprogram\u2019s star-making enterprise through casting votes. Fans also could sign up for text alerts or\nplay trivia games on their phones. In 2009, AT&T estimated that Idol-related text traffic amounted to\n178 million messages.\nAn important consideration in any discussion of media and culture is the concept of popular culture.\nIf culture is the expressed and shared values, attitudes, beliefs, and practices of a social group,\norganization, or institution, then what is popular culture? Popular culture is the media, products, and\nattitudes considered to be part of the mainstream of a given culture and the everyday life of common\npeople. It is often distinct from more formal conceptions of culture that take into account moral,\nsocial, religious beliefs and values, such as our earlier definition of culture. It is also distinct from\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n39 what some consider elite or high culture. For some people, American Idol is pop culture and opera is\nculture.\nPop culture and American media are inextricably linked\u2014it\u2019s no coincidence that Jenny Lind, the\nBeatles, and American Idol were each promoted using a then-new technology\u2014photography for Lind;\ntelevision for the Beatles; the Internet and text messaging for American Idol. For as long as mass\nmedia have existed in the United States, they have helped to create and fuel mass crazes,\nskyrocketing celebrities, and pop culture manias of all kinds. Whether through newspaper\nadvertisements, live television broadcasts, or integrated Internet marketing, media industry\n\u201ctastemakers\u201d help to shape what we care about. Even in our era of seemingly limitless\nentertainment options, mass hits like American Idol still have the ability to dominate the public\u2019s\nattention.\n\u201cThe Tastemakers\u201d\nHistorically, popular culture has been closely associated with mass media that introduce and encourage\nthe adoption of certain trends. We can see these media as \u201ctastemakers\u201d\u2014people or institutions that shape\nthe way others think, eat, listen, drink, dress and more. Similar in some ways to the media gatekeepers\ndiscussed above, tastemakers can have huge influence. For example, The New York Times\u2019 restaurant and\ntheater reviews used to be able to make or break a restaurant or show with their opinions. Another\nexample is Ed Sullivan\u2019s variety show, which ran from 1948 to 1971, and is most famous for hosting the\nfirst U.S. appearance of the Beatles\u2014a television event that was at the time the most-watched television\nprogram ever. Sullivan hosted musical acts, comedians, actors, and dancers, and had the reputation of\nbeing able to turn an unknown performer into a full-fledged star. Comedian Jackie Mason compared\nbeing on The Ed Sullivan Show to \u201can opera singer being at the Met. Or if a guy is an architect that makes\nthe Empire State Building.\u2026This was the biggest.\u201d [3]Sullivan was a classic example of an influential\ntastemaker of his time. American Idol\u2019s Simon Cowell had similar influence as his show helped turn\nunknown local performers into international stars. Television hosts and comics Jon Stewart and Stephen\nColbert can be understood as tastemakers of progressive national politics.\nFigure 1.9\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n40 Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert at Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cRally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear\u201d.\nSource: Photo by Jeff Snyder/PictureGroup via AP Images\nAlong with encouraging a mass audience to keep an eye out for (or skip) certain movies, television shows,\nvideo games, books, or fashion trends, tastemaking is also used to create demand for new products.\nCompanies often turn to advertising firms to help create a public hunger for an object that may have not\neven existed six months previously. In the 1880s, when George Eastman developed the Kodak camera for\npersonal use, photography was the realm of professionals. Ordinary people simply did not think about\ntaking photographs. \u201cThough the Kodak was relatively cheap and easy to use, most Americans didn\u2019t see\nthe need for a camera; they had no sense that there was any value in visually documenting their lives,\u201d\nnoted New Yorker writer James Surowiecki. [4] George Eastman\u2019s advertising introduced the very idea of\nphotography to everyday Americans. Kodak became a wildly successful company not because Eastman\nwas good at selling cameras, but because he understood that what he really had to sell was photography.\nTastemakers can help keep culture vital by introducing the public to new ideas, music, programs, or\nproducts. But the ability to sway or influence the tastes of consumers can be worth millions of dollars. In\nthe traditional media model, media companies set aside large advertising budgets to promote their most\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n41 promising projects. Tastemakers are encouraged to buzz about \u201cthe next big thing.\u201d In untraditional\nmodels, bribery and backroom deals also have helped promote performers or projects. For example, the\nPayola Scandal of the 1950s involved record companies paying the disc jockeys of radio stations to play\ncertain records so those records would become hits. Payola is a combination of the words \u201cpay\u201d and\n\u201cVictrola,\u201d a record player. Companies today sometimes pay bloggers to promote their products.\nA Changing System for the Internet Age\nIn retrospect, the 20th century was a tastemaker\u2019s dream. Media choices were limited. Many cities and\ntowns had just three television channels, one or two newspapers, and one or two dominant radio stations.\nAdvertisers, critics, and other cultural influencers had access to huge audiences through a small number\nof mass communication platforms. However, by the end of the century, the rise of cable television and the\nInternet had begun to make tastemaking a much more complicated enterprise. While The Ed Sullivan\nShow regularly reached 50 million people in the 1960s, the most popular television series of 2009\u2014\nAmerican Idol\u2014averaged around 25.5 million viewers per night, despite the fact that the 21st century\nUnited States could claim more people and more television sets than ever before. The proliferation of\ntelevision channels and other, competing forms of entertainment meant that no one program or channel\ncould dominate the attention of the American public as in Sullivan\u2019s day.\nTable 1.1 Viewings of Popular Television Broadcasts\nShow/Episode Number of Viewers Percentage of Households Year\nThe Ed Sullivan Show, Beatles\u2019 first appearance 73 million 45.1 1964\nThe Ed Sullivan Show, Elvis\u2019s first appearance 60 million 82.6 1956\nI Love Lucy, \u201cLucy Goes to the Hospital\u201d 44 million 71.7 1953\nM*A*S*H series finale 106 million 60.2 1983\nSeinfeld series finale 76 million 41.3 1998\nAmerican Idol season five finale 36 million 17 2006\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n42 The very concept of a \u201ctastemaker\u201d is undergoing a transformation. While theAmerican Idol season five\nfinale was reaching 36 million viewers, a low-tech home recording of a little boy acting loopy after a visit\nto the dentist (\u201cDavid After Dentist\u201d) garnered more than 37 million YouTube viewings in 2009 alone. The\nInternet appears to be eroding some of the tastemaking power of the traditional media outlets. No longer\nare the traditional mass media the only dominant forces in creating and promoting trends. Instead,\ninformation can spread across the globe without any involvement of traditional media. Websites made by\nnonprofessionals can reach more people daily than a major newspaper. Music review sites such\nas Pitchfork.com keep their eyes out for the next big thing, whereas review aggregators\nlike RottenTomatoes.com allow readers to read hundreds of reviews by amateurs and professionals alike.\nMobile applications like Yelp allow consumers to get individual reviews of a restaurant while they are\nstanding outside it. Blogs make it possible for anyone with Internet access to potentially reach an\naudience of millions. Some popular bloggers transitioned from the traditional media world to the digital\nworld, but others became well known without formal institutional support. The celebrity gossip chronicler\nPerez Hilton had no formal training in journalism when he started his blog, PerezHilton.com, in 2005;\nwithin a few years, he was reaching millions of readers a month.\nEmail and text messages allow for the near-instant transmission of messages across vast geographic\nexpanses. Although personal communications continue to dominate, email and text messages are\nincreasingly used to directly transmit information about important news events. When Barack Obama\nwanted to announce his selection of Joe Biden as his vice-presidential running mate in the 2008 election,\nhe bypassed the traditional televised press conference and instead sent the news to his supporters directly\nvia text message\u20142.9 million text messages, to be exact. [5] Social networking sites, such as Facebook, and\nmicroblogging services, such as Twitter, are another source of late-breaking information. When Michael\nJackson died of cardiac arrest in 2009, \u201cRIP Michael Jackson\u201d was a top trending topic on\nTwitter before mainstream media first reported the news.\nThanks to these and other digital-age media, the Internet has become a pop culture force, both a source of\namateur talent and a source of amateur promotion. However, traditional media outlets still maintain a\nlarge amount of control and influence over U.S. pop culture. One key indicator is the fact that many\nsingers or writers who first make their mark on the Internet quickly transition to more traditional media\u2014\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n43 YouTube star Justin Bieber was snapped up by a mainstream record company, and blogger Perez Hilton is\nregularly featured on MTV and VH1. New media stars are quickly absorbed into the old media landscape.\nGetting Around the Gatekeepers\nNot only does the Internet allow little known individuals to potentially reach a huge audience with their\nart or opinions, but it also allows content-creators to reach fans directly. Projects that may have not\nsucceeded as part of the established pop culture/mass media machine may get a chance in the digital\nworld. For example, the media establishment has been surprised by the success of some self-published\nbooks: First-time author Daniel Suarez had his novel manuscript rejected by dozens of literary agents\nbefore he decided to self-publish in 2006. Through savvy self-promotion via influential bloggers, Suarez\ngarnered enough attention to land a contract with a major publishing house.\nFigure 1.10\nE-readers offer authors a way to get around the traditional publishing industry, but their thousands of options can make\nchoosing hard on readers.\nSuarez\u2019s story, though certainly exceptional, points to some of the questions facing creators and\nconsumers of pop culture in the Internet age. Without the influence of an agent, editor, or public relations\nfirm, self-published content may be able to remain closer to the creator\u2019s intention. However, how then\ndoes the content reach the public? Does every artist have to have the public relations and marketing skills\nof Suarez? And with so many self-published, self-promoted works uploaded to the Internet every day, how\nwill any work\u2014even great work\u2014get noticed?\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n44 It\u2019s not impossible. Critic Laura Miller spells out some of the ways in which writers in particular are able\nto take control of their own publishing: Writers can upload their works to services run by Amazon, Apple,\nand Barnes & Noble, she notes, \u201ctransforming them into e-books that are instantly available in high-\nprofile online stores. Or they can post them on services like Urbis.com, Quillp.com,\nor CompletelyNovel.com and coax reviews from other hopeful users.\u201d Miller also points out that many of\nthese companies can produce hard copies of books as well. While such a system may be a boon for writers\nwho haven\u2019t had success with the traditional media establishment, Miller notes that it may not be the best\noption for readers, who \u201crarely complain that there isn\u2019t enough of a selection on Amazon or in their local\nsuperstore; they\u2019re more likely to ask for help in narrowing down their choices.\u201d [6]\nThe commingling of the Internet and popular culture poses many intriguing questions for our future: Will\nthe Internet era be marked by a huge and diffuse pop culture, where the power of traditional mass media\ndeclines and, along with it, the power of the universalizing blockbuster hit? Or will the Internet create a\nnew set of tastemakers\u2014influential bloggers or Tweeters? Or will the Internet serve as a platform for the\nold tastemakers to take on new forms? Or will the tastemakers become everyone?\nMore Reviewers=More Accurate Reviews\u2026Right?\nIn 1993, The New York Times restaurant critic Ruth Reichl visited one of Manhattan\u2019s snootiest\nrestaurants, Le Cirque, first as herself, a fashionable New Yorker, and then, one week later, in the guise of\na frumpy Midwesterner. In her shocking review, the critic lambasted the restaurant\u2019s rude treatment of\n\u201cMidwestern Molly\u201d\u2014an early battle in the fight for democratic reviews. Part of the point of Reichl\u2019s\nexperiment was to find out how ordinary people were treated in restaurants. Now ordinary people can tell\ntheir own tales. The Internet, which has turned everyone with the time and interest into a potential\nreviewer, allows those ordinary people to have their voices heard. In the mid-2000s, websites such as Yelp\nand TripAdvisor boasted hundreds of reviews of restaurants, hotels, and salons provided by users.\nAmazon allowed users to review any product it sells, from textbooks to fertilizer to bathing suits. The era\nof the democratized review was upon us, and tastemaking was now everyone\u2019s job.\nBy crowd-sourcing the review process, the idea was, these sites would arrive at a more accurate\ndescription of the service in choice. One powerful reviewer would no longer be able to wield\ndisproportionate power. Instead, the wisdom of the crowd would make or break restaurants, movies, and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n45 everything else. Anyone who felt treated badly or scammed now had recourse to tell the world about it. By\n2008, Yelp boasted four million reviews.\nHowever, mass tastemaking isn\u2019t as perfect as some people had promised. One determined reviewer can\noverly influence a product\u2019s overall rating by contributing multiple votes. One study found that a handful\nof Amazon users were casting hundreds of votes, while most rarely wrote reviews at all. Online reviews\nalso tend to skew to extremes\u2014more reviews are written by the ecstatic and the furious, while the\nmoderately pleased aren\u2019t riled up enough to post online about their experiences. And while traditional\ncritics are supposed to uphold ethics, there\u2019s no such standard for online reviews. Savvy authors or\nrestaurant owners have been known to slyly insert positive reviews of themselves, or have attempted to\nskew ratings systems. In order to get an accurate picture, potential buyers may find themselves wading\nthrough 20 or 30 online reviews, most of them from non-professionals. Consider these Amazon user\nreviews of William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHamlet\u201d: \u201cThere is really no point and it\u2019s really long,\u201d \u201cI really didn\u2019t\nenjoy reading this book and I wish that our English teacher wouldn\u2019t force my class to read this play,\u201d and\n\u201cdon\u2019t know what Willy Shakespeare was thinking when he wrote this one play tragedy, but I thought this\nsure was boring! Hamlet does too much talking and not enough stuff.\u201d\nSuch unhelpful reviews have begun to remind people of the point of having reviews in the first place\u2014that\nit\u2019s an advantage to have certain places, products, or ideas examined and critiqued by a trusted source. In\nan article about Yelp, The New York Times noted that one of the site\u2019s elite reviewers had racked up more\nthan 300 reviews in 3 years, then snidely pointed out that \u201cBy contrast, a The New York Times restaurant\ncritic might take six years to amass 300 reviews. The critic visits a restaurant several times, strives for\nanonymity and tries to sample every dish on the menu.\u201d [7]Whatever your vantage point, it\u2019s clear that old-\nstyle tastemaking is still around and still valuable\u2014but the democratic review is here to stay.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Traditionally, pop culture hits were often initiated or driven by the active support of media tastemakers.\nWhen mass media are limited in number, people with access to platforms for mass communication wield\nquite a bit of power in what becomes well-known, popular, or even infamous. Ed Sullivan\u2019s wildly popular\nvariety show in the 1950s and 1960s served as a star-making vehicle and a tastemaker extraordinaire of\nthat period.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n46 \uf0b7 The digital age, with its proliferation of accessible media, has undermined the traditional role of the\ntastemaker. In contrast to the traditional media, Internet-based mass media is not limited by time or\nspace and allows bloggers, critics, or wannabe stars to potentially reach millions without the backing of\nthe traditional media industry.\n\uf0b7 However, this democratization has its downsides as well. An abundance of mass communication without\nsome form of selection can lead to information overload. Additionally, online reviews can be altered or\nbiased.\nEXERCISE\nFind a popular newspaper or magazine that discusses popular culture. Look through it to determine what\npop culture movements, programs, or people it seems to be covering. What is its overall tone? What\nmessages does it seem to be promoting, either implicitly or explicitly? Next, find a website that also deals\nwith popular culture and ask yourself the same questions. Are there differences between the traditional\nmedia\u2019s and the new media\u2019s approach to popular culture? Do they focus on the same subjects? Do they\ntake similar attitudes?

Define media literacy, and explain why it is relevant to today\u2019s world.\n2. Discuss the role of individual responsibility and accountability when responding to pop culture.\n3. List the five key questions that can be asked about any media message.\nIn Gutenberg\u2019s age and the subsequent modern era, literacy\u2014the ability to read and write\u2014was a\nconcern not only of educators but also of politicians, social reformers, and philosophers. A literate\npopulation, many reasoned, would be able to seek out information, stay informed about the news of\nthe day, communicate with others, and make informed decisions in many spheres of life. Because of\nthis, the reasoning went, literate people made better citizens, parents, and workers. In the 20th\ncentury, as literacy rates grew around the globe, there was a new sense that merely being able to read\nand write was not enough. In a world dominated by media, individuals needed to be able to\nunderstand, sort through and analyze the information they were bombarded with every day. In the\nsecond half of the 20th century, a name was finally put to this skill of being able to decode and\nprocess the messages and symbols transmitted via media: media literacy. According to the nonprofit\nNational Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE), a person who is media literate is able\nto access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate information. Put another way by John Culkin, a\npioneering advocate for media literacy education, \u201cthe new mass media\u2014film, radio, TV\u2014are new\nlanguages, their grammar as yet unknown.\u201d [1] Media literacy seeks to give media consumers the\nability to understand this new language.\nWhy Be Media Literate?\nCulkin called the pervasiveness of media \u201cthe unnoticed fact of our present,\u201d noting that media\ninformation was as omnipresent and easy to overlook as the air we breathe (and, he noted, \u201csome would\nadd that it is just as polluted\u201d). Our exposure to media starts early\u2014a study by the Kaiser Family\nFoundation found that 68 percent of children aged two and younger spend an average of two hours in\nfront of a screen (either computer or television) each day, while children under six spend as much time in\nfront of a screen as they do playing outside. As previously noted, U.S. teenagers are spending an average\nof 7.5 hours with media daily, nearly as long as they spend in school. Media literacy isn\u2019t merely a skill for\nyoung people, however. Today, Americans of all ages get much of their information from various media\nsources. One crucial role of media literacy education is to enable all of us to skeptically examine the often-\nconflicting media messages we receive every day.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n48 Advertising\nMany of the hours people spend with media are with commercial-sponsored content. The Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) estimated that children aged 2 to 11 saw, on average, 25,629 television commercials a\nyear, or more than 10,700 minutes of ads. Adults saw 52,469 ads, or about 15.5 days worth of television\nadvertising. [2] Children (and adults) are bombarded with contradictory messages\u2014newspaper articles\nabout the obesity epidemic are side by side with ads touting soda, candy, and fast food. The American\nAcademy of Pediatrics maintains that advertising directed at children under eight is \u201cinherently\ndeceptive\u201d and exploitative because young children cannot tell the difference between programs and\ncommercials. [3]\nAdvertising raises other issues as well. It often uses techniques of psychological pressure to influence\ndecision making. Ads might appeal to vanity, insecurity, prejudice, fear, or the desire for adventure. This\nis not always a negative thing\u2014antismoking public service announcements may rely on disgusting images\nof blackened lungs to shock viewers. Nonetheless, media literacy attempts to teach people to be informed\nand guarded consumers, and to evaluate claims with a critical eye. Do \u201cfour out of five doctors\u201d really\nendorse the product?\nBias, Spin, and Misinformation\nAdvertisements may have the explicit goal of selling a product or idea, but they\u2019re not the only kind of\nmedia message with an agenda. A politician may hope to persuade potential voters that she has their best\ninterests at heart. An ostensibly objective journalist may allow his or her own political leanings to subtly\nslant articles. Magazine writers might avoid criticizing companies that advertise heavily in their pages.\nBroadcast news reporters may sensationalize stories in order to boost ratings\u2014and advertising rates.\nAn important part of media literacy is remembering that mass communication messages are created by\nindividuals, each with a set of values, assumptions, and priorities. Accepting media messages at face value\ncould lead to head-spinning confusion, thanks to all the contradictory information that\u2019s out there. For\nexample, in 2010, a highly contested governor\u2019s race in New Mexico led to conflicting ads from both\ncandidates, Diane Denish and Susana Martinez. Each claimed that the other agreed to policies that\nbenefited sex offenders. According to the media watchdog site Factcheck.org, the Denish team\u2019s ad \u201cshows\na pre-teen girl\u2014seemingly about 9 years old\u2014going down a playground slide in slow-motion, while\nominous music plays in the background and an announcer discusses two sex crime cases. It ends with an\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n49 empty swing, as the announcer says: \u2018Today we don\u2019t know where these sex offenders are lurking, because\nSusana Martinez didn\u2019t do her job.\u2019\u201d The opposing ad proclaims that \u201ca department in Denish\u2019s cabinet\ngave sanctuary to criminal illegals [sic], like child molester Juan Gonzalez.\u201d Both claims are highly\ninflammatory, play on fear, and distort the reality behind each situation. Media literacy attempts to give\npeople the skills to look critically at these and other media messages\u2014to sift through various claims, and\nto make sense of the often-conflicting information we face every day.\nThe Center for Media Literacy\u2019s Five Core Concepts\n1. All media messages are constructed.\n2. Media messages are constructed using a creative language with its own rules.\n3. Different people experience the same media message differently.\n4. Media have embedded values and points of view.\n5. Most media messages are organized to gain profit and/or power. [4]\nNew Skills for a New World\nIn the past, one goal of education was to provide students with the information deemed necessary to\nsuccessfully engage with the world. Students memorized multiplication tables, state capitals, famous\npoems, and notable dates. In today\u2019s world, however, vast amounts of information are available at the\nclick of a mouse. Even before the advent of the Internet, noted communications scholar David Berlo\nforesaw the consequences of expanding information technology: \u201cMost of what we have called formal\neducation has been intended to imprint on the human mind all of the information that we might need for\na lifetime.\u201d Changes in technology necessitate changes in how we learn, Berlo noted, and these days\n\u201ceducation needs to be geared toward the handling of data rather than the accumulation of data.\u201d [5]\nOnline technology surely has changed how we learn. For example, Wikipedia, a hugely popular Internet\nencyclopedia, is at the center of a debate on the proper use of online sources. In 2007, Middlebury College\nbanned the use of Wikipedia as a source in history papers and exams. One of the school\u2019s librarians noted\nthat the online encyclopedia \u201csymbolizes the best and worst of the Internet. It\u2019s the best because everyone\ngets his/her say and can state their views. It\u2019s the worst because people who use it uncritically take for\ntruth what is only opinion.\u201d [6] Or as comedian and satirist Stephen Colbert put it, \u201cany user can change\nany entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true.\u201d In 2007, CIA computers were used\nto make edits on the site\u2019s article about the President of Iran. The Vatican allegedly doctored the entry for\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n50 Irish activist and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. A computer registered to the U.S. Democratic Party\nchanged the site\u2019s page for Rush Limbaugh to proclaim that he was \u201cracist\u201d and a \u201cbigot.\u201d [7] Media literacy\nteaches today\u2019s students how to sort through the Internet\u2019s cloud of data, ferret out reliable sources, and\nbe aware of bias and unreliable sources.\nIndividual Accountability and Popular Culture\nUltimately, media literacy teaches that messages and images are constructed with various aims in mind\nand that each individual has the responsibility to evaluate and interpret these media messages. Mass\ncommunication may be created and disseminated by individuals, businesses, governments, or\norganizations, but they are always received by an individual, even if that individual is sitting in a crowded\ntheater. Education, life experience, and a host of other factors allow each person to interpret constructed\nmedia in different ways; there is no \u201cright answer,\u201d or one way to read the media. But media literacy skills\nhelp us to function better in our media-rich environment, enabling us to be better democratic citizens,\nsmarter shoppers, and more skeptical media consumers. As a means to this end, NAMLE has come up\nwith a list of five questions to ask when analyzing media messages:\n1. Who created this message?\n2. What creative techniques are used to attract my attention?\n3. How might different people understand this message differently?\n4. What values, lifestyles, and points of view are represented in, or omitted from, this message?\n5. Why is this message being sent?

K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books about a young boy\u2019s education as a wizard caused many parents\u2014at\nleast initially\u2014to be somewhat wary. When they received an email warning them about the content of\nbooks, some of these parents had their fears justified. It seemed Rowling, the author of the books, was a\nSatan worshiper! According to the email, Rowling said the following:\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absolute rubbish to protest children\u2019s books on the grounds that they are luring children to\nSatan,\u201d Rowling told a London Times reporter in a July 17 interview. \u201cPeople should be praising them for\nthat! These books guide children to an understanding that the weak, idiotic Son Of God is a living hoax\nwho will be humiliated when the rain of fire comes \u2026 while we, his faithful servants, laugh and cavort in\nvictory.\u201d [1]\nFigure 2.1\nWeb publication WorldNetDaily posted an article at about the same time that used similar quotes,\nprovoking a number of concerned letters and emails to the London Times. Both outlets, however, had\nquoted from the same source: the satirical newspaper The Onion. The original article was an intentially\nover-the-top satire of the Harry Potter phenomenon. In typical Onion fashion, the article included absurd,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n56 fake quotes from 6-year-old Satanists reported in a straightforward style. Unbelievably, both the email\nand the WorldNetDaily article quoted The Onion article apparently without realizing the article was a\nparody. [2]\nThis example of a rumor gone wild is a remarkable, if bizarre, example of how people worry about media\neffects. On the surface, the email typifies some people\u2019s fears of the media\u2019s influence on children. This\nfear reflects the ways some parents process new-media information and react to the media\u2019s influence on\nthe lives of children and teens. The concerns about one medium did not, however, stop the author of the\nemail from using another medium to spread a false rumor. The concerned parents who believed the email\ntrusted it because it was a form of media that validated their own preconceptions.\nIronically enough, The Onion article itself addressed such overblown fears. By satirizing the sometimes-\nhysterical concerns of parents in such a convincing reporting style, the article positioned itself as\nknowledgeable and comfortable within the framework of competing media claims. The article was, in\nessence, predicated on the idea that the readers of The Onion are savvy enough to understand media\nmessages and that they have no reason to fear the media because they understand it.\nYet the rumor also validates concerns about media\u2019s effects on culture. By quoting from an unsourced\narticle that was read without regard for its context, the emailer and the WorldNetDaily writer presented\nthe kind of woeful scholarship that online media has enabled. The email and its underlying narrative\nillustrate the fear that new forms of media can be used more readily than traditional media as tools for\nunfounded propaganda and biased punditry.\nThe story provides an intriguing introduction to the various ways media messages are created and\nconsumed and the widespread concern over media effects. As a constant presence in modern life, media\nserve numerous functions and send seemingly unlimited messages. Studying the possible effects of media\nprovides a crucial perspective on modern culture.\n[1] Barbara Mikkelson and David Mikkelson, \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d Snopes.com, May 30, 2008,\nhttp://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/potter.asp.\n[2] Barbara Mikkelson and David Mikkelson, \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d Snopes.com, May 30, 2008,\nhttp://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/potter.asp.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n57 2.1\nMass Media and Its Messages\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Explain the different ways mass media affects culture.\n2. Analyze cultural messages that the media send.\n3. Explain the ways new media have affected culture.\nWhen media consumers think of media messages, they may think of televised public service\nannouncements or political advertisements. These obvious examples provide a venue for the transfer\nof a message through a medium, whether that message is a plea for fire safety or the statement of a\npolitical position. But what about more abstract political advertisements that simply show the logo of\na candidate and a few simple words? Media messages can range from overt statements to vague\nexpressions of cultural values.\nDisagreements over the content of media messages certainly exist. Consider the common allegations\nof political bias against various news organizations. Accusations of hidden messages or agenda-\ndriven content have always been an issue in the media, but as the presence of media grows, the\ndebate concerning media messages increases. This dialogue is an important one; after all, mass\nmedia have long been used to persuade. Many modern persuasive techniques stem from the use of\nmedia as a propaganda tool. The role of propaganda and persuasion in the mass media is a good\nplace to start when considering various types of media effects.\nPropaganda and Persuasion\nEncyclopedia Britannica defines propaganda simply as the \u201cmanipulation of information to influence\npublic opinion.\u201d [1] This definition works well for this discussion because the study and use of propaganda\nhas had an enormous influence on the role of persuasion in modern mass media. In his book The Creation\nof the Media, Paul Starr argues that the United States, as a liberal democracy, has favored employing an\nindependent press as a public guardian, thus putting the media in an inherently political position. [2] The\nUnited States\u2014in contrast to other nations where media are held in check\u2014has encouraged an\nindependent commercial press and thus given the powers of propaganda and persuasion to the public. [3]\nFigure 2.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n58 Benjamin Franklin used a powerful image of a severed snake to emphasize the importance of the colonies joining\ntogether during the American Revolution.\nLike any type of communication, propaganda is not inherently good or bad. Whether propaganda has a\npositive or negative effect on society and culture depends on the motivations of those who use it and the\nunderstandings of those who receive it. People promoting movements as wide-ranging as Christianity, the\nAmerican Revolution, and the communist revolutions of the 20th century have all used propaganda to\ndisseminate their messages. [4]Newspapers and pamphlets that glorified the sacrifices at Lexington and\nConcord and trumpeted the victories of George Washington\u2019s army greatly aided the American\nRevolution. For example, Benjamin Franklin\u2019s famous illustration of a severed snake with the caption\n\u201cJoin, or Die\u201d serves as an early testament to the power and use of print propaganda. [5]\nAs you will learn in Chapter 4 \"Newspapers\", the penny press made newspapers accessible to a mass\naudience and became a force for social cohesion during the 1830s. [6] Magazines adopted a similar format\nlater in the 19th century, and print media\u2019s political and social power rose. In an infamous example of the\nnew power of print media, some newspapers encouraged the Spanish-American War of 1898 by\nfabricating stories of Spanish atrocities and sabotage. [7] For example, after the USS Maine sunk off the\ncoast of Havana, Cuba, some newspapers blamed the Spanish\u2014even though there was no evidence\u2014\nfueling the public\u2019s desire for war with Spain.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n59 The present-day, pejorative connotation of propaganda recalls the utilization of mass media by World\nWar I\u2013era governments to motivate the citizenry of many countries to go to war. Some media outlets\ncharacterized that war as a global fight between Anglo civilization and Prussian barbarianism. Although\nsome of those fighting the war had little understanding of the political motivations behind it, wartime\npropaganda convinced them to enlist. [8] As you will read in Chapter 12 \"Advertising and Public Relations\",\nWorld War I legitimized the advertising profession in the minds of government and corporate leaders\nbecause its techniques were useful in patriotic propaganda campaigns. Corporations quickly adapted to\nthis development and created an advertising boom in the 1920s by using World War I propaganda\ntechniques to sell products. [9]\nIn modern society, the persuasive power of the mass media is well known. In the years after 9/11, there\nwere multiple reports of the death of Osama bin Laden; people desperately wanted to believe he was\nkilled. In reality, he was killed in 2011. Governments, corporations, nonprofit organizations, and political\ncampaigns rely on both new and old media to create messages and to send them to the general public.\nDuring and since the 2008 Presidential election, there has been constant scrutiny over Barack Obama\u2019s\nbirthplace and citizenship; the reports are discredited, but the questions resurface. The comparatively\nunregulated nature of U.S. media has made, for better or worse, a society in which the tools of public\npersuasion are available to everyone.\nMedia Effects and Behavior\nAlthough the mass media send messages created specifically for public consumption, they also convey\nmessages that are not properly defined as propaganda or persuasion. Some argue that these messages\ninfluence behavior, especially the behavior of young people. [10] Violent, sexual, and compulsive behaviors\nhave been linked to media consumption and thus raise important questions about the effects of media on\nculture.\nViolence and the Media\nOn April 20, 1999, students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold entered their Denver-area high school,\nColumbine High School, armed with semiautomatic weapons and explosives. Over the next few hours, the\npair killed 12 classmates and one faculty member before committing suicide. [11] The tragedy and its\naftermath captured national attention, and in the weeks following the Columbine High School shootings,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n60 politicians and pundits worked to assign blame. Their targets ranged from the makers of the first-person\nshooter video game Doom to the Hollywood studios responsible for The Matrix. [12]\nHowever, in the years since the massacre, research has revealed that the perpetrators were actually\nattempting a terrorist bombing rather than a first-person shooter style rampage. [13] But did violent video\ngames so desensitize the two teenagers to violence that they could contemplate such a plan? Did movies\nthat glorify violent solutions create a culture that would encourage people to consider such methods?\nBecause modern culture is so immersed in media, the issue becomes a particularly complex one, and it\ncan be difficult to understand the types of effects that violent media produce.\nA number of studies have verified certain connections between violent video games and violent behavior\nin young people. For example, studies have found that some young people who play violent video games\nreported angry thoughts and aggressive feelings immediately after playing. Other studies, such as one\nconducted by Dr. Chris A. Anderson and colleagues, point to correlations between the amount of time\nspent playing violent video games and increased incidence of aggression. [14] However, these studies do\nnot prove that video games cause violence. Video game defenders argue that violent people can be drawn\nto violent games, and they point to lower overall incidence of youth violence in recent years compared to\npast decades. [15] Other researchers admit that individuals prone to violent acts are indeed drawn to\nviolent media; however, they claim that by keeping these individuals in a movie theater or at home,\nviolent media have actually contributed to a reduction in violent social acts. [16]\nWhether violent media actually cause violence remains unknown, but unquestionably these forms of\nmedia send an emotional message to which individuals respond. Media messages are not limited to overt\nstatements; they can also use emotions, such as fear, love, happiness, and depression. These emotional\nreactions partially account for the intense power of media in our culture.\nSex and the Media\nIn many types of media, sexual content\u2014and its strong emotional message\u2014can be prolific. A recent study\nby researchers at the University of North Carolina titled \u201cSexy Media Matter: Exposure to Sexual Content\nin Music, Movies, Television, and Magazines Predicts Black and White Adolescents\u2019 Sexual Behavior\u201d\nfound that young people with heavy exposure to sexually themed media ranging from music to movies are\ntwice as likely to engage in early sexual behavior as young people with light exposure. Although the study\ndoes not prove a conclusive link between sexual behavior and sexually oriented media, researchers\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n61 concluded that media acted as an influential source of information about sex for these youth\ngroups. [17] Researcher Jane Brown thinks part of the reason children watch sexual content is related to\npuberty and their desire to learn about sex. While many parents are hesitant to discuss sex with their\nchildren, the media can act like a \u201csuper peer,\u201d providing information in movies, television, music, and\nmagazines. [18] Reality series, such as Teen Mom and 16 and Pregnant, are prevalent on the popular MTV\nstation. We will explore in greater detail the impact of sexual content in the media in Chapter 14 \"Ethics of\nMass Media\".\nCultural Messages and the Media\nThe media sends messages that reinforce cultural values. These values are perhaps most visible in\ncelebrities and the roles that they adopt. Actors such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Scarlett Johansson have\ncome to represent aspects of masculinity and femininity that have been adopted into mainstream culture\nin the last 10 years. In recent years, baseball player Derek Jeter appeared in television, film, magazines,\nand advertising campaigns as a model of athleticism and willpower. Singers such as Bono of U2 have\nrepresented a sense of freedom and rebellion against mainstream culture.\nAlthough many consider celebrity culture superficial and a poor reflection of a country\u2019s values, not all\ncelebrities are simply entertainers. Civil rights leaders, social reformers, and other famous public figures\nhave come to represent important cultural accomplishments and advancements through their\nrepresentations in the media. When images of Abraham Lincoln or Lady Gaga appear in the media, they\nresonate with cultural and historical themes greatly separated from mere fame.\nCelebrities can also reinforce cultural stereotypes that marginalize certain groups. Television and\nmagazines from the mid-20th century often portrayed women in a submissive, domestic role, both\nreflecting and reinforcing the cultural limitations imposed on women at the time. Advertising icons\ndeveloped during the early 20th century, such as Aunt Jemima and the Cream of Wheat chef, similarly\nreflected and reinforced a submissive, domestic servant role for African Americans. Other famous\nstereotypes\u2014such as the Lone Ranger\u2019s Native American sidekick, Tonto, or Mickey Rooney\u2019s Mr.\nYunioshi role in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u2014also reinforced American preconceptions about ethnic\npredispositions and capabilities.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n62 Whether actual or fictional, celebrities and their assumed roles send a number of different messages about\ncultural values. They can promote courageous truth telling, hide and prolong social problems, or provide a\nconcrete example of an abstract cultural value.\nNew Media and Society\nNew media\u2014the Internet and other digital forms of communication\u2014have had large effects on society.\nThis communication and information revolution has created a great deal of anguish about digital literacy\nand other issues that inevitably accompany such a social change. In his book on technology and\ncommunication, A Better Pencil, Dennis Baron discusses this issue:\nFor Plato, only speech, not writing, can produce the kind of back-and-forth\u2014the dialogue\u2014that\u2019s needed\nto get at the truth \u2026 the text, orphaned by its author once it\u2019s on the page, cannot defend itself against\nmisreading\u2026. These are strong arguments, but even in Plato\u2019s day they had been rendered moot by the\nsuccess of the written word. Although the literacy rate in classical Greece was well below 10 percent,\nwriting had become an important feature of the culture. People had learned to trust and use certain kinds\nof writing\u2014legal texts, public inscriptions, business documents, personal letters, and even literature\u2014and\nas they did so, they realized that writing, on closer examination, turned out to be neither more nor less\nreliable or ambiguous than the spoken word, and it was just as real. [19]\nBaron makes the point that all communication revolutions have created upheavals and have changed the\nstandards of literacy and communication. This historical perspective gives a positive interpretation to\nsome otherwise ominous developments in communication and culture.\nInformation\nThe Internet has made an incredible amount of new information available to the general public. Both this\nwealth of information and the ways people process it are having an enormous effect on culture. New\nperceptions of information have emerged as access to it grows. Older-media consumption habits required\nin-depth processing of information through a particular form of media. For example, consumers read,\nwatched, or viewed a news report in its entirety, typically within the context of a news publication or\nprogram. Fiction appeared in book or magazine form.\nToday, information is easier to access, thus more likely to traverse several forms of media. An individual\nmay read an article on a news website and then forward part of it to a friend. That person in turn\ndescribes it to a coworker without having seen the original context. The ready availability of information\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n63 through search engines may explain how a clearly satirical Onion article on the Harry Potter phenomenon\ncame to be taken as fact. Increasingly, media outlets cater to this habit of searching for specific bits of\ninformation devoid of context. Information that will attract the most attention is often featured at the\nexpense of more important stories. At one point on March 11, 2010, for example, The Washington\nPost website\u2019s most popular story was \u201cMaintaining a Sex Life.\u201d [20]\nAnother important development in the media\u2019s approach to information is its increasing subjectivity.\nSome analysts have used the term cyberbalkanization to describe the way media consumers filter\ninformation. Balkanization is an allusion to the political fragmentation of Eastern Europe\u2019s Balkan states\nfollowing World War I, when the Ottoman Empire disintegrated into a number of ethnic and political\nfragments. Customized news feeds allow individuals to receive only the kinds of news and information\nthey want and thus block out sources that report unwanted stories or perspectives. Many cultural critics\nhave pointed to this kind of information filtering as the source of increasing political division and\nresulting loss of civic discourse. When media consumers hear only the information they want to, the\ncommon ground of public discourse that stems from general agreement on certain principles inevitably\ngrows smaller. [21]\nLiteracy\nOn one hand, the growth of the Internet as the primary information source exposes the public to\nincreased levels of text, thereby increasing overall literacy. Indeed, written text is essential to the Internet:\nWeb content is overwhelmingly text-based, and successful participation in Internet culture through the\nuse of blogs, forums, or a personal website requires a degree of textual literacy that is not necessary for\nengagement in television, music, or movies.\nCritics of Internet literacy, however, describe the majority of forum and blog posts as subliterate and\nargue that the Internet has replaced the printed newspapers and books that actually raised the standards\nof literacy. One nuanced look at the Internet\u2019s effect on the way a culture processes and perceives\ninformation states that literacy will not simply increase or decrease but will change\nqualitatively. [22] Perhaps the standards for literacy will shift to an emphasis on simplicity and directness,\nfor example, rather than on elaborate uses of language.\nNews\nFigure 2.5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n64 President Barack Obama fired General Stanley McChrystal after a controversial Rolling\nStone story in which McChrystal spoke poorly of the Obama administration was leaked on the\nInternet.\nCertainly, the Internet has affected the way that cultures consume news. The public expects to receive\ninformation quickly, and news outlets respond rapidly to breaking stories. On Monday, June 21, 2010, for\nexample, a spokesperson for Rolling Stone magazine first released quotes from a story featuring General\nStanley McChrystal publicly criticizing members of the Obama administration on matters of foreign\npolicy. By that evening, the story had become national news despite the fact Rolling Stone didn\u2019t even post\nit to its website until Tuesday morning\u2014some time after several news outlets had already posted the\nentire story on their own sites. Later that same day, McChrystal issued a public apology, and on\nWednesday flew to Washington where President Barack Obama fired him. The printed Rolling Stone issue\nfeaturing the article hit newsstands Friday, two days after McChrystal had been replaced. [23]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n65 Convergence Culture\nAs we have seen, the term convergence can hold several different meanings. In Convergence Culture:\nWhere Old and New Media Collide, Henry Jenkins offers a useful definition of convergence as it applies\nto new media:\n\u201cBy convergence, I mean the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between\nmultiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in\nsearch of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want.\u201d [24]\nA self-produced video on the YouTube website that gains enormous popularity and thus receives the\nattention of a news outlet is a good example of this migration of both content and audiences. Consider this\nflow: The video appears and gains notoriety, so a news outlet broadcasts a story about the video, which in\nturn increases its popularity on YouTube. This migration works in a number of ways. Humorous or\npoignant excerpts from television or radio broadcasts are often posted on social media sites and blogs,\nwhere they gain popularity and are seen by more people than had seen the original broadcast.\nThanks to new media, consumers now view all types of media as participatory. For example, the massively\npopular talent show American Idol combines an older-media format\u2014television\u2014with modern media\nconsumption patterns by allowing the home audience to vote for a favorite contestant. However,\nAmerican Idol segments regularly appear on YouTube and other websites, where people who may never\nhave seen the show comment on and dissect them. Phone companies report a regular increase in phone\ntraffic following the show, presumably caused by viewers calling in to cast their votes or simply to discuss\nthe program with friends and family. As a result, more people are exposed to the themes, principles, and\nculture of American Idol than the number of people who actually watch the show. [25]\nNew media have encouraged greater personal participation in media as a whole. Although the long-term\ncultural consequences of this shift cannot yet be assessed, the development is undeniably a novel one. As\naudiences become more adept at navigating media, this trend will undoubtedly increase.\nBert Is Evil\nFigure 2.6\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n66 In 2001, high school student Dino Ignacio created a collage of Sesame Street character Bert with terrorist\nOsama bin Laden as part of a series for his website. Called \u201cBert Is Evil,\u201d the series featured the puppet\nengaged in a variety of illicit activities. A Bangladesh-based publisher looking for images of bin Laden\nfound the collage on the Internet and used it in an anti-American protest poster, presumably without\nknowledge of who Bert was. This ended up in a CNN report on anti-American protests, and public outrage\nover the use of Bert made Ignacio\u2019s original site a much-imitated cult phenomenon.\nThe voyage of this collage from a high school student\u2019s website to an anti-American protest poster in the\nMiddle East to a cable television news network and finally back to the Internet provides a good illustration\nof the ways in which content migrates across media platforms in the modern era. As the collage crossed\ngeographic and cultural boundaries, it grew on both corporate and grassroots media. While this is not the\nnorm for media content, the fact that such a phenomenon is possible illustrates the new directions in\nwhich media is headed. [26]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Propaganda and persuasion have long been a part of the interactions between media and culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n67 \uf0b7 Most studies on media and behavior do not establish direct links between the two but do reveal\nimportant correlations among media, violence, and sexual behavior.\n\uf0b7 Through the media, celebrities have come to signify important cultural values and tendencies, and they\ntransmit specific cultural messages.\n\uf0b7 New digital forms of media have revolutionized the way people access and consume media content.\nRather than simply replacing old media, however, new forms of media encourage participatory media\nconsumption and content migration.\nEXERCISES\n1) Celebrities can represent cultural values and principles when they are portrayed in the media.

Identify the basic theories of media effects.\n2. Explain the uses of various media effects theories.\nEarly media studies focused on the use of mass media in propaganda and persuasion. However,\njournalists and researchers soon looked to behavioral sciences to help figure out the possible effect of\nmass media and communications on society. Scholars have developed many different approaches\nand theories to figure this out. Other scholars challenge whether research can ever untangle the\nrelationship of media and effects. You can refer to these theories as you consider for yourself the\nmedia\u2019s effect on individuals and culture.\nIn one of the earliest formulations of media effects, widespread fear that mass-media messages could\noutweigh other stabilizing cultural influences, such as family and community, led to what is known\nas the direct effects model of media studies. This model, prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s, assumed\nthat audiences passively accepted media messages and would exhibit predictable reactions in\nresponse to those messages. For example, following the radio broadcast of War of the Worlds in 1938\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n70 (which was a fictional news report of an alien invasion), some people panicked and believed the story\nto be true.\nChallenges to the Direct Effects Theory\nThe results of the People\u2019s Choice Study challenged this model. Conducted in 1940, the study attempted to\ngauge the effects of political campaigns on voter choice. Researchers found that voters who consumed the\nmost media had generally already decided for which candidate to vote, while undecided voters generally\nturned to family and community members to help them decide. The study thus discredited the direct\neffects model and influenced a host of other media theories. [1] These theories do not necessarily give an\nall-encompassing picture of media effects but rather work to illuminate a particular aspect of media\ninfluence.\nMarshall McLuhan\u2019s Influence on Media Studies\nAs noted in Chapter 1 \"Media and Culture\", during the early 1960s, English professor Marshall McLuhan\nwrote two books that had an enormous effect on the history of media studies. Published in 1962 and 1964,\nrespectively, the Gutenberg Galaxy and Understanding Media both traced the history of media\ntechnology and illustrated the ways these innovations had changed both individual behavior and the\nwider culture. Understanding Media introduced the phrase that McLuhan has become known for: \u201cThe\nmedium is the message.\u201d This notion represented a novel take on attitudes toward media\u2014that the media\nthemselves are instrumental in shaping human and cultural experience.\nHis bold statements about media gained McLuhan a great deal of attention as both his supporters and\ncritics responded to his utopian views about the ways media could transform 20th-century life. McLuhan\nspoke of a media-inspired \u201cglobal village\u201d at a time when Cold War paranoia was at its peak and the\nVietnam War was a hotly debated subject. Although 1960s-era utopians received these statements\npositively, social realists found them cause for scorn. Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014these\ncontroversies, McLuhan became a pop culture icon, mentioned frequently in the television sketch-comedy\nprogram Laugh-In and appearing as himself in Woody Allen\u2019s film Annie Hall.\nThe Internet and its accompanying cultural revolution have made McLuhan\u2019s bold utopian visions seem\nlike prophecies. Indeed, his work has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Analysis of\nMcLuhan\u2019s work has, interestingly, not changed very much since his works were published. His\nsupporters point to the hopes and achievements of digital technology and the utopian state that such\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n71 innovations promise. The current critique of McLuhan, however, is a bit more revealing of the state of\nmodern media studies. Media scholars are much more numerous now than they were during the 1960s,\nand many of these scholars criticize McLuhan\u2019s lack of methodology and theoretical framework.\nDespite his lack of scholarly diligence, McLuhan had a great deal of influence on media studies. Professors\nat Fordham University have formed an association of McLuhan-influenced scholars. McLuhan\u2019s other\ngreat achievement is the popularization of the concept of media studies. His work, perhaps ironically,\nbrought the idea of media effects into the public arena and created a new way for the public to consider\nthe influence of media on culture. [2]\nAgenda-Setting Theory\nIn contrast to the extreme views of the direct effects model, the agenda-setting theory of media stated that\nmass media determine the issues that concern the public rather than the public\u2019s views. Under this theory,\nthe issues that receive the most attention from media become the issues that the public discusses, debates,\nand demands action on. This means that the media are determining what issues and stories the public\nthinks about. Therefore, when the media fail to address a particular issue, it becomes marginalized in the\nminds of the public. [3]\nWhen critics claim that a particular media outlet has an agenda, they are drawing on this theory. Agendas\ncan range from a perceived liberal bias in the news media to the propagation of cutthroat capitalist ethics\nin films. For example, the agenda-setting theory explains such phenomena as the rise of public opinion\nagainst smoking. Before the mass media began taking an antismoking stance, smoking was considered a\npersonal health issue. By promoting antismoking sentiments through advertisements, public relations\ncampaigns, and a variety of media outlets, the mass media moved smoking into the public arena, making\nit a public health issue rather than a personal health issue. [4] More recently, coverage of natural disasters\nhas been prominent in the news. However, as news coverage wanes, so does the general public\u2019s interest.\nFigure 2.7\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n72 Through a variety of antismoking campaigns, the health risks of smoking became a public agenda.\nMedia scholars who specialize in agenda-setting research study the salience, or relative importance, of an\nissue and then attempt to understand what causes it to be important. The relative salience of an issue\ndetermines its place within the public agenda, which in turn influences public policy creation. Agenda-\nsetting research traces public policy from its roots as an agenda through its promotion in the mass media\nand finally to its final form as a law or policy.[5]\nUses and Gratifications Theory\nPractitioners of theuses and gratifications theory study the ways the public consumes media. This theory\nstates that consumers use the media to satisfy specific needs or desires. For example, you may enjoy\nwatching a show like Dancing With the Stars while simultaneously tweeting about it on Twitter with your\nfriends. Many people use the Internet to seek out entertainment, to find information, to communicate\nwith like-minded individuals, or to pursue self-expression. Each of these uses gratifies a particular need,\nand the needs determine the way in which media are used. By examining factors of different groups\u2019\nmedia choices, researchers can determine the motivations behind media use. [6]\nA typical uses and gratifications study explores the motives for media consumption and the consequences\nassociated with use of that media. By studying how and why people watch Dancing With the Stars while\nusing Twitter, scholars suggest people are using the Internet as way to be entertained and to connect with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n73 friends. Researchers have identified a number of common motives for media consumption. These include\nrelaxation, social interaction, entertainment, arousal, escape, and a host of interpersonal and social needs.\nBy examining the motives behind the consumption of a particular form of media, researchers can better\nunderstand both the reasons for that medium\u2019s popularity and the roles that the medium fills in society. A\nstudy of the motives behind a given user\u2019s interaction with Facebook, for example, could explain the role\nFacebook takes in society and the reasons for its appeal.\nUses and gratifications theories of media are often applied to contemporary media issues. The analysis of\nthe relationship between media and violence that you read about in preceding sections exemplifies this.\nResearchers employed the uses and gratifications theory in this case to reveal a nuanced set of\ncircumstances surrounding violent media consumption, as individuals with aggressive tendencies were\ndrawn to violent media. [7]\nSymbolic Interactionism\nAnother commonly used media theory, symbolic interactionism, states that the self is derived from and\ndevelops through human interaction. This means the way you act toward someone or something is based\non the meaning you have for a person or thing. To effectively communicate, people use symbols with\nshared cultural meanings. Symbols can be constructed from just about anything, including material\ngoods, education, or even the way people talk. Consequentially, these symbols are instrumental in the\ndevelopment of the self.\nThis theory helps media researchers better understand the field because of the important role the media\nplays in creating and propagating shared symbols. Because of the media\u2019s power, it can construct symbols\non its own. By using symbolic interactionist theory, researchers can look at the ways media affects a\nsociety\u2019s shared symbols and, in turn, the influence of those symbols on the individual. [8]\nOne of the ways the media creates and uses cultural symbols to affect an individual\u2019s sense of self is\nadvertising. Advertisers work to give certain products a shared cultural meaning to make them desirable.\nFor example, when you see someone driving a BMW, what do you think about that person? You may\nassume the person is successful or powerful because of the car he or she is driving. Ownership of luxury\nautomobiles signifies membership in a certain socioeconomic class. Equally, technology company Apple\nhas used advertising and public relations to attempt to become a symbol of innovation and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n74 nonconformity. Use of an Apple product, therefore, may have a symbolic meaning and may send a\nparticular message about the product\u2019s owner.\nMedia also propagate other noncommercial symbols. National and state flags, religious images, and\ncelebrities gain shared symbolic meanings through their representation in the media.\nSpiral of Silence\nThe spiral of silence theory, which states that those who hold a minority opinion silence themselves to\nprevent social isolation, explains the role of mass media in the formation and maintenance of dominant\nopinions. As minority opinions are silenced, the illusion of consensus grows, and so does social pressure\nto adopt the dominant position. This creates a self-propagating loop in which minority voices are reduced\nto a minimum and perceived popular opinion sides wholly with the majority opinion. For example, prior\nto and during World War II, many Germans opposed Adolf Hitler and his policies; however, they kept\ntheir opposition silent out of fear of isolation and stigma.\nBecause the media is one of the most important gauges of public opinion, this theory is often used to\nexplain the interaction between media and public opinion. According to the spiral of silence theory, if the\nmedia propagate a particular opinion, then that opinion will effectively silence opposing opinions through\nan illusion of consensus. This theory relates especially to public polling and its use in the media. [9]\nMedia Logic\nThe media logic theory states that common media formats and styles serve as a means of perceiving the\nworld. Today, the deep rooting of media in the cultural conciousness means that media consumers need\nengage for only a few moments with a particular television program to understand that it is a news show,\na comedy, or a reality show. The pervasiveness of these formats means that our culture uses the style and\ncontent of these shows as ways to interpret reality. For example, think about a TV news program that\nfrequently shows heated debates between opposing sides on public policy issues. This style of debate has\nbecome a template for handling disagreement to those who consistently watch this type of program.\nMedia logic affects institutions as well as individuals. The modern televangelist has evolved from the\nadoption of television-style promotion by religious figures, while the utilization of television in political\ncampaigns has led candidates to consider their physical image as an important part of a campaign.[10]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n75 Cultivation Analysis\nThe cultivation analysis theory states that heavy exposure to media causes individuals to develop\u2014or\ncultivate\u2014an illusory perception of reality based on the most repetitive and consistent messages of a\nparticular medium. This theory most commonly applies to analyses of television because of that medium\u2019s\nuniquely pervasive nature. Under this theory, someone who watches a great deal of television may form a\npicture of reality that does not correspond to actual life. Televised violent acts, whether those reported on\nnews programs or portrayed on television dramas, for example, greatly outnumber violent acts that most\npeople encounter in their daily lives. Thus, an individual who watches a great deal of television may come\nto view the world as more violent and dangerous than it actually is.\nCultivation analysis projects involve a number of different areas for research, such as the differences in\nperception between heavy and light users of media. To apply this theory, the media content that an\nindividual normally watches must be analyzed for various types of messages. Then, researchers must\nconsider the given media consumer\u2019s cultural background of individuals to correctly determine other\nfactors that are involved in his or her perception of reality. For example, the socially stabilizing influences\nof family and peer groups influence children\u2019s television viewing and the way they process media\nmessages. If an individual\u2019s family or social life plays a major part in her life, the social messages that she\nreceives from these groups may compete with the messages she receives from television.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The now largely discredited direct effects model of media studies assumes that media audiences passively\naccept media messages and exhibit predictable reactions in response to those messages.\n\uf0b7 Credible media theories generally do not give as much power to the media, such as the agenda-setting\ntheory, or give a more active role to the media consumer, such as the uses and gratifications theory.\n\uf0b7 Other theories focus on specific aspects of media influence, such as the spiral of silence theory\u2019s focus on\nthe power of the majority opinion or the symbolic interactionism theory\u2019s exploration of shared cultural\nsymbolism.\n\uf0b7 Media logic and cultivation analysis theories deal with how media consumers\u2019 perceptions of reality can\nbe influenced by media messages.\nEXERCISES\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n76 1) Media theories have a variety of uses and applications.

Identify the prominent media research methods.\n2. Explain the uses of media research methods in a research project.\nMedia theories provide the framework for approaching questions about media effects ranging from\nas simple as how 10-year-old boys react to cereal advertisements to as broad as how Internet use\naffects literacy. Once researchers visualize a project and determine a theoretical framework, they\nmust choose actual research methods. Contemporary research methods are greatly varied and can\nrange from analyzing old newspapers to performing controlled experiments.\nContent Analysis\nContent analysis is a research technique that involves analyzing the content of various forms of media.\nThrough content analysis, researchers hope to understand both the people who created the content and\nthe people who consumed it. A typical content analysis project does not require elaborate experiments.\nInstead, it simply requires access to the appropriate media to analyze, making this type of research an\neasier and inexpensive alternative to other forms of research involving complex surveys or human\nsubjects.\nContent analysis studies require researchers to define what types of media to study. For example,\nresearchers studying violence in the media would need to decide which types of media to analyze, such as\ntelevision, and the types of formats to examine, such as children\u2019s cartoons. The researchers would then\nneed to define the terms used in the study; media violence can be classified according to the characters\ninvolved in the violence (strangers, family members, or racial groups), the type of violence (self-inflicted,\nslapstick, or against others), or the context of the violence (revenge, random, or duty-related). These are\njust a few of the ways that media violence could be studied with content-analysis techniques. [1]\nArchival Research\nAny study that analyzes older media must employ archival research, which is a type of research that\nfocuses on reviewing historical documents such as old newspapers and past publications. Old local\nnewspapers are often available on microfilm at local libraries or at the newspaper offices. University\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n78 libraries generally provide access to archives of national publications such as The New York\nTimes or Time; publications can also increasingly be found in online databases or on websites.\nOlder radio programs are available for free or by paid download through a number of online sources.\nMany television programs and films have also been made available for free download, or for rent or sale\nthrough online distributors. Performing an online search for a particular title will reveal the options\navailable.\nResources such as the Internet Archive (www.archive.org) work to archive a number of media sources.\nOne important role of the Internet Archive is website archiving. Internet archives are invaluable for a\nstudy of online media because they store websites that have been deleted or changed. These archives have\nmade it possible for Internet content analyses that would have otherwise been impossible.\nSurveys\nSurveys are ubiquitous in modern life. Questionaires record data on anything from political preferences to\npersonal hygiene habits. Media surveys generally take one of the following two forms.\nA descriptive survey aims to find the current state of things, such as public opinion or consumer\npreferences. In media, descriptive surveys establish television and radio ratings by finding the number of\npeople who watch or listen to particular programs. An analytical survey, however, does more than simply\ndocument a current situation. Instead, it attempts to find out why a particular situation exists.\nResearchers pose questions or hypotheses about media and then conduct analytical surveys to answer\nthese questions. Analytical surveys can determine the relationship between different forms of media\nconsumption and the lifestyles and habits of media consumers.\nSurveys can employ either open-ended or closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions require the\nparticipant to generate answers in their own words, while closed-ended questions force the participant to\nselect an answer from a list. Although open-ended questions allow for a greater variety of answers, the\nresults of closed-ended questions are easier to tabulate. Although surveys are useful in media studies,\neffective use requires keeping their limitations in mind.\nSocial Role Analysis\nAs part of child rearing, parents teach their children about social roles. When parents prepare children to\nattend school for example, they explain the basics of school rules and what is expected of a student to help\nthe youngsters understand the role of students. Like the role of a character in a play, this role carries\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n79 specific expectations that differentiate school from home. Adults often play a number of different roles as\nthey navigate between their responsibilities as parents, employees, friends, and citizens. Any individual\nmay play a number of roles depending on his or her specific life choices.\nSocial role analysis of the media involves examining various individuals in the media and analyzing the\ntype of role that each plays. Role analysis research can consider the roles of men, women, children,\nmembers of a racial minority, or members any other social group in specific types of media. For example,\nif the role children play in cartoons is consistently different from the role they play in sitcoms, then\ncertain conclusions might be drawn about both of these formats. Analyzing roles used in media allows\nresearchers to gain a better understanding of the messages that the mass media sends. [2]\nDepth Interviews\nThe depth interview is an anthropological research tool that is also useful in media studies. Depth\ninterviews take surveys one step further by allowing researchers to directly ask a study participant specific\nquestions to gain a fuller understanding of the participant\u2019s perceptions and experiences. Depth\ninterviews have been used in research projects that follow newspaper reporters to find out their reasons\nfor reporting certain stories and in projects that attempt to understand the motivations for reading\nromance novels. Depth interviews can provide a deeper understanding of the media consumption habits\nof particular groups of people. [3]\nRhetorical Analysis\nRhetorical analysis involves examining the \u201cstyles\u201d used in media and attempting to understand the kinds\nof messages those styles convey. Media styles refer to form, presentation, composition, use of metaphors,\nand reasoning structure. Rhetorical analysis reveals the messages not apparent in a strict reading of\ncontent. Studies involving rhetorical analysis have focused on media such as advertising to better\nunderstand the roles of style and rhetorical devices in media messages. [4]\nFocus Groups\nLike depth interviews, focus groups allow researchers to better understand public responses to media.\nUnlike a depth interview, however, a focus group allows the participants to establish a group dynamic that\nmore closely resembles that of normal media consumption. In media studies, researchers can employ\nfocus groups to judge the reactions of a group to specific media styles and to content. This can be a\nvaluable means of understanding the reasons for consuming specific types of media.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n80 Figure 2.8\nFocus groups are effective ways to obtain a group opinion on media.\nExperiments\nMedia research studies also sometimes use controlled experiments that expose a test group to an\nexperience involving media and measure the effects of that experience. Researchers then compare these\nmeasurements to those of a control group that had key elements of the experience removed. For example,\nreseachers may show one group of children a program with three incidents of cartoon violence and\nanother control group of similar children the same program without the violent incidents. Researchers\nthen ask the children from both groups the same sets of questions, and the results are compared.\nParticipant Observation\nIn participant observation, researchers try to become part of the group they are studying. Although this\ntechnique is typically associated with anthropological studies in which a researcher lives with members of\na particular culture to gain a deeper understanding of their values and lives, it is also used in media\nresearch.\nMedia consumption often takes place in groups. Families or friends gather to watch favorite programs,\nchildren may watch Saturday morning cartoons with a group of their peers, and adults may host viewing\nparties for televised sporting events or awards shows. These groups reveal insights into the role of media\nin the lives of the public. A researcher might join a group that watches football together and stay with the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n81 group for an entire season. By becoming a part of the group, the researcher becomes part of the\nexperiment and can reveal important influences of media on culture. [5]\nResearchers have studied online role-playing games, such as World of Warcraft, in this manner. These\ngames reveal an interesting aspect of group dynamics: Although participants are not in physical\nproximity, they function as a group within the game. Researchers are able to study these games by playing\nthem. In the book Digital Culture, Play, and Identity: A World of Warcraft Reader, a group of\nresearchers discussed the results of their participant observation studies. The studies reveal the surprising\ndepth of culture and unwritten rules that exist in the World of Warcraft universe and give important\ninterpretations of why players pursue the game with such dedication. [6]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Media research methods are the practical procedures for carrying out a research project. These methods\ninclude content analysis, surveys, focus groups, experiments, and participant observation.\n\uf0b7 Research methods generally involve either test subjects or analysis of media. Methods involving test\nsubjects include surveys, depth interviews, focus groups, and experiments. Analysis of media can include\ncontent, style, format, social roles, and archival analysis.\nEXERCISES\nMedia research methods offer a variety of procedures for performing a media study. Each of these\nmethods varies in cost; thus, a project with a lower budget would be prohibited from using some of the\nmore costly methods. Consider a project on teen violence and video game use. Then answer the following\nshort-response questions. Each response should be a minimum of one paragraph.\n1. Which methods would a research organization with a low budget favor for this project? Why?\n2. How might the results of the project differ from those of one with a higher budget?\n[1] Arthur Asa Berger, Media Research Techniques (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998), 23\u201324.\n[2] Arthur Asa Berger, Media Research Techniques (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998), 45\u201348.\n[3] Susanna Hornig Priest, Doing Media Research: An Introduction (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2010), 16\u201322.\n[4] Barrie Gunter, Media Research Methods: Measuring Audiences, Reactions and Impact (Thousand Oaks, CA:\nSage, 2000), 89.\n[5] Susanna Hornig Priest, Doing Media Research: An Introduction (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2010), 96\u201398.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n82 [6] Hilde Corneliussen and Jill Walker Rettberg, \u201cIntroduction: \u2018Orc ProfessorLFG,\u2019 or Researching in Azeroth,\u201d\nin Digital Culture, Play, and Identity: A World of Warcraft Reader, ed. Hilde Corneliussen and Jill Walker Rettberg\n(Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2008), 6\u20137.\n2.4\nMedia Studies Controversies\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Explain some of the major objections to specific media theories.\n2. Identify ways media studies are used to support political opinions.\n3. Differentiate between proper and improper use of media studies.\nImportant debates over media theory have questioned the foundations and hence the results of\nmedia research. Within academia, theories and research can represent an individual\u2019s lifework and\nlivelihood. As a result, issues of tenure and position, rather than issues of truth and objectivity, can\nsometimes fuel discussion over theories and research.\nProblems with Methodology and Theory\nAlthough the use of advanced methodologies can resolve many of the questions raised about various\ntheories, the fact remains that the use of these theories in public debate generally follows a broader\nunderstanding. For example, if a hypothetical study found that convicted violent offenders had aggressive\nfeelings after playing the video game Mortal Kombat, many would take this as proof that video games\ncause violent acts without considering other possible explanations. Often, the nuances of these studies are\nlost when they enter the public arena.\nActive versus Passive Audience\nA significant division among media studies theorists is the belief that audiences are passive or active.\nA passive audience, in the most extreme statement of this position, passively accepts the messages that\nmedia send it. An active audience, on the other hand, is fully aware of media messages and makes\ninformed decisions about how to process and interact with media. Newer trends in media studies have\nattempted to develop a more complex view of media audiences than the active versus passive debate\naffords, but in the public sphere, this opposition frames many of the debates about media influence. [1]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n83 Arguments against Agenda-Setting Theory\nA number of criticisms have dogged agenda-setting theory. Chief among these is that agenda-setting\nstudies are unable to prove cause and effect; essentially, no one has truly shown that the media agenda\nsets the public agenda and not the other way around. An agenda-setting study could connect the\nprevalence of a topic in the media with later changes in public policy and may conclude that the media set\nthis agenda. However, policy makers and lobbyists often conduct public relations efforts to encourage the\ncreation of certain policies. In addition, public concern over issues generates media coverage as well,\nmaking it difficult to tell if the media are responding to public desire for coverage of an issue or if they are\npushing an issue on their own agenda. [2]\nArguments against Uses and Gratifications Theory\nThe general presuppositions of the uses and gratifications theory have drawn criticism. By assuming that\nmedia fulfill a functional purpose in an individual\u2019s life, the uses and gratifications theory implicitly\njustifies and reaffirms the functional place of media in the public sphere; critics say that people do not\nalways use media to fulfill a function. They ask whether unconscious motivations or social rituals might be\nat play. Furthermore, because it focuses on personal, psychological aspects of media, the theory cannot\nquestion whether media are artificially imposed on an indivdual. Studies involving the uses and\ngratifications theory are often sound methodologically, but the overall assumptions of the studies are left\nunquestioned. [3]\nArguments against Spiral of Silence Theory\nAlthough many regard the spiral of silence theory as useful when applying its broadest principles, it is\nweak when dealing with specifics. For example, the phenomenon of the spiral of silence is most visible in\nindividuals who are fearful of social isolation. Those who are less fearful are less likely to be silent if public\nopinion turns against them. Nonconformists contradict the claims of the spiral of silence theory.\nCritics have also pointed out that the spiral of silence theory relies heavily on the values of various cultural\ngroups. A public opinion trend in favor of gun control may not silence the consensus within National Rifle\nAssociation meetings. Every individual is a part of a larger social group with specific values. Although\nthese values may differ from widespread public opinion, individuals need not fear social isolation within\ntheir particular social group. [4]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n84 Arguments against Cultivation Analysis Theory\nCritics have faulted cultivation analysis theory for relying too heavily on a broad definition of violence.\nDetractors argue that because violence means different things to different subgroups and individuals, any\nclaim that a clear message of violence could be understood in the same way by an entire culture is false.\nThis critique would necessarily extend to other studies involving cultivation analysis. Different people\nunderstand media messages in varying ways, so broad claims can be problematic. Cultivation analysis is\nstill an important part of media studies, but critics have questioned its unqualified validity as a theory. [5]\nPolitics and Media Studies\nMedia theories and studies afford a variety of perspectives. When proponents of a particular view employ\nthose theories and studies, however, they are often oversimplified and can result in contradictory claims.\nIn fact, when politicians and others employ media studies to validate a political perspective, this is a\ncommon result.\nMedia Bias\nA good example of the ways that media can bolster political opinion is through coverage, which leads to\nthe debate over media bias. One 1985 study found that journalists were more likely to hold liberal views\nthan were members of the public. Over the years, many have cited this study to support the opinion that\nthe media holds a liberal bias. However, another study found that between the years of 1948 and 1990, 78\npercent of newspaper presidential endorsements were for Republicans. [6]\nMedia favoritism again became a source of contention during the 2008 presidential race. A random\nsampling of campaign coverage in the run-up to the election found that 82 percent of stories featured\nBarack Obama, while only 52 percent discussed John McCain. [7] Allegations that the media favored\nObama seemed to bolster the idea of a liberal bias. But other studies belied this belief. Research\nconducted during the election showed that favorable media coverage of Obama occurred only after his\npoll numbers rose, hinting that the media were reacting to public opinion rather than attempting to\ninfluence it. [8]\nFigure 2.9\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n85 Allegations of media bias are a recurring theme in political debates.\nMedia Decency\nDecency standards in media have long been an issue, and they continue to change in ways that are not\nnecessarily predictable. Once banned in the United States for obscenity, James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses is now\nconsidered a classic of modern literature, while many schools have banned children\u2019s classicAdventures of\nHuckleberry Finn for its use of ethnic slurs. Because of the regulatory powers that government possesses\nover the media, decency is also an inherently political issue. As media studies have progressed, they have\nincreasingly appeared in the debates over decency standards. Although media studies cannot prove a\nword or image is indecent, they can help discern the impact of that word or image and, thus, greatly\ninfluence the debate.\nOrganizations or figures with stated goals often use media studies to support those aims. For example, the\nParents Television Council reported on a study that compared the ratio of comments about nonmarital\nsex to comments about marital sex during the hours of 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. The study employed content\nanalysis to come up with specific figures; however, the Parents Television Council then used those\nfindings to make broad statements, such as \u201cthe institution of marriage is regularly mocked and\ndenigrated.\u201d [9] Because content analysis does not analyze the effect on audiences or analyze how material\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n86 is presented, it does not offer a scientific way to judge whether a comment is mocking and denigrating\nmarriage, so such interpretations are arguably unsupported by the research. For example, researchers\nperforming a content analysis by documenting the amount of sex or violence on television are not\nanalyzing how this content is interpreted by the audience. They are simply noting the number of\ninstances. Equally, partisan groups can use a number of different linguistic turns to make media studies\nfit their agenda.\nMedia studies involving violence, pornography, and profanity are inherently politically charged, and\npoliticians have also conducted their own media studies. In 2001, for example, a Senate bill aimed at\nInternet decency that had little support in Congress came to the floor. One of the sponsoring senators\nattempted to increase interest by bringing to the Senate floor a file full of some of the most egregious\npornographic images he could find on the Internet. The bill passed 84 to 16. [10]\nJack Thompson versus Violent Video Games\nOne of the most outspoken critics of violent video games is the now-disbarred lawyer Jack Thompson.\nDespite questionable use of media research, Thompson has made many claims referencing research. In an\ninterview with CBS News, Thompson stated that \u201chundreds of studies\u201d existed that proved the link\nbetween violent video games and real violence. Later in the interview, he listed increasing school murder\nstatistics as proof of the effects of violent video games. [11] In light of the media effects theories elucidated\nin this chapter, Thompson was obviously not being honest about the findings of video game\u2013violence\nresearch and was making claims that no media effects scholar could confidently make.\nThompson initiated several lawsuits against Grand Theft Auto video game developer Take 2 Interactive,\nclaiming that the company should be held liable for encouraging violent actions by minors. His lawsuits\nwere thrown out of court, and he eventually came to a settlement with Take 2 Interactive\u2014who had\ncountersued\u2014to drop all litigation. [12] Thompson\u2019s frivolous use of the legal system caused the state of\nAlabama to revoke his license to practice law in 2005, and, in 2008, the Florida Supreme Court disbarred\nhim for life. [13]\nJack Thompson\u2019s actions may seem extreme, but he represents a common pattern of media study\nmisrepresentation. Pundits, social reformers, and politicians frequently use the results of media studies to\nsupport their agenda without regard for accuracy. The use of media research to lend credence to a political\nopinion is widespread even as the public struggles to understand the effects of new media on culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n87 Media Consolidation\nAlthough media consolidation will be discussed in more depth in later chapters, the topic\u2019s intersection\nwith media studies results deserves a place here. Media consolidation occurs when large media companies\nbuy up smaller media outlets to create giant conglomerates. Some scholars predict that a handful of\ncompanies will soon control most of the world\u2019s media. Although government regulation has historically\nstymied this trend in the United States by prohibiting ownership of a large number of media outlets, the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) has loosened many of the restrictions on large media\ncompanies in recent years.\nMedia studies often prove vital to decisions regarding media consolidation. These studies measure the\nimpact that consolidation has had on the media\u2019s public role and on the content of local media outlets to\ncompare it with that of conglomerate-owned outlets. The findings often vary depending on the group\nconducting the test. Sometimes tests are ignored entirely.\nIn 2003, the FCC loosened restrictions on owning multiple media outlets in the same city, citing studies\nthat the agency had developed to weigh the influence of particular media outlets such as newspapers and\ntelevision stations. [14] In 2006, however, reports surfaced that a key study had been discarded during the\n2003 decision. The study showed an increase in time allocated for news when TV stations were owned\nlocally, thus raising questions about whether media consolidation was a good thing for local news. [15]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Audience interpretation is vital to media studies. Media theories generally fall between the active and\npassive audience interpretations. Agenda-setting theory favors the passive audience interpretation, and\nconsequently must prove that the public is affected by media agendas. The uses and gratifications theory\nfavors the active audience, and consequently justifies the place of media in the public sphere.\n\uf0b7 In politics, media studies are often used to support various opinions. Among the more prominent media\nstudies employed are those that deal with media bias, violence in the media, and indecency.\n\uf0b7 The use of media studies in public debate has led to subjective studies that have a predetermined\noutcome. Many studies conducted by special interest groups use definitions that favor their perspectives.\nPoliticians often copy the style, rather than the substance, of a media study in an attempt to give\nauthority to their points of view.\nEXERCISES\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n88 Media studies are often used to support specific opinions, regardless of whether their results justify such a\nuse.

Reading\u2014or, more aptly put, not reading. According to the\nreport, Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America, less than half the population engaged\nin any literary reading in 2002, a record low since the survey\u2019s beginnings in 1982. [1]\nThe report, which asked respondents whether they had read any literary fiction (novels, short stories,\nplays, or poetry) over the past year showed especially stark numbers among the youngest adults. Those\naged 18\u201324 saw a rate of decline 55 percent greater than the total adult population. (Books read for school\nor work weren\u2019t counted in the survey, which was examining Americans\u2019 leisure reading habits.)\nAccording to the NEA, the overall 10 percent drop in literary readers represented a loss of 20 million\npotential readers, most of them young. In 1982, young adults (people aged 18\u201334) were most likely to\nengage in literary reading; by 2002, they were the least likely group. Based on this, the report asks, \u201cAre\nwe losing a generation of readers?\u201d [2]\nDespite these facts, the publishing industry\u2019s releasing more books than ever before. In 2003, just 1 year\nafter the NEA issued its gloomy warning about the state of reading, 175,000 new titles were published in\nthe United States\u2014a 19 percent jump from the year before. [3] Since the early part of the 21st century, the\nUnited States publishing industry has had an average annual monetary growth rate of 1.1 percent;\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n92 however, net sales have dropped from $26 billion to $23 billion in the past year. [4] Meanwhile, as the NEA\nreport notes, 24 percent of Americans\u2019 recreational spending went to electronics, while books accounted\nfor only 5.6 percent in 2002. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the households that watched television more read\nless. The report warned that \u201cat the current rate of loss, literary reading as a leisure activity will virtually\ndisappear in half a century.\u201d [5]\nAs a response to the alarming statistics, in 2006 the NEA launched its Big Read program, essentially a\ncity-wide book club in which community members are encouraged to read the same book at the same\ntime. The NEA provided publicity, funding for kickoff parties, and readers\u2019 guides. The residents of\nTampa, Florida, read The Joy Luck Club and were accorded a visit by author Amy Tan, and the residents\nof Washington, DC, chose Ernest J. Gaines\u2019s A Lesson Before Dying with hopes that it would spur\nconversations about race, justice, and violence. The Big Read\u2019s DC program director said that he hoped\nthe book got young people talking, noting that the book raises all sorts of relevant questions, such as \u201cDo\nwe offer second chances for people after making mistakes, especially youth in DC? What about youth in\nthe justice system? So many people who have been through the juvenile justice system will testify a book\nset them free,\u201d he claimed. [6]\nWhen the NEA\u2019s 2008 numbers were released, many people were again surprised. The statistics showed\nthat the decline in reading had reversed, the first such increase in 26 years. Once again, the change was\nmost significant among young adults, who had a 21 percent increase from 2002. [7] The NEA credited the\n\u201cmillions of parents, teachers, librarians, and civic leaders [who] took action\u2026 [to ensure that] reading\nbecame a higher priority in families, schools, and communities.\u201d [8] Another factor may have been in play,\nhowever; the 2008 study was the first to include online reading. To understand what books mean in the\npresent world of e-readers and digital libraries, it helps to examine how they functioned in the past and to\nconsider how they might change in the future.\n[1] National Endowment for the Arts, Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America (New York: Author,\n2004).\n[2] National Endowment for the Arts, Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America (New York: Author,\n2004).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n93 [3] Bowker, \u201cU.S. Book Production Soars to 175,000 New Titles in 2003; Trade Up, University Presses Down,\u201d news\nrelease, May 27, 2004, http://www.bowker.com/press/bowker/2004_0527_bowker.htm.\n[4] Association of American Publishers, \u201cIndustry Statistics 2009: AAP Reports Book Sales Estimated at $23.9 Billion\nin 2009,\u201d http://www.publishers.org/main/IndustryStats/indStats_02.htm.\n[5] National Endowment for the Arts, Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America (New York: Author,\n2004).\n[6] DeNeen Brown, \u201cErnest J.

Identify the material and cultural origins of the book in ancient and medieval times.\n2. Indicate the influence of mechanical movable type on modern society.\n3. Explain the evolution of contemporary copyright law and of the contemporary publishing industry.\nAncient Books\nMost historians trace the origins of the book back to the ancient Egyptians, whose papyrus scrolls looked\nvery different from the books we\u2019re accustomed to today. From the time they first developed a written\nscript, around 3000 BCE (Before Common Era), Egyptians wrote on many different surfaces, including\nmetal, leather, clay, stone, and bone. Most prominent, though, was the practice of using reed pens to write\non papyrus scrolls. In many ways, papyrus was an ideal material for the Egyptians. It was made using the\ntall reeds that grew plentifully in the Nile Valley. Individual sheets of papyrus were glued or sewn together\nto make scrolls. A standard scroll was around 30 feet long and 7 to 10 inches wide, while the longest\nEgyptian scroll ever found stretched over 133 feet, making it almost as long as the Statue of Liberty when\nit was rolled all the way out. [1]\nBy the 6th century BCE, papyrus was the most common writing surface throughout the Mediterranean\nand was used by the Greeks and Romans. Because papyrus grew in Egypt, the Egyptians had a virtual\nmonopoly over the papyrus trade. Many ancient civilizations housed their scrolls in large libraries, which\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n94 acted as both repositories of knowledge and displays of political and economic power. The Royal Library\nof Alexandria boasted around half a million scrolls in its collection; some scholars claim that this was\nbetween 30 and 70 percent of all books in existence at the time. [2] But other powerful entities in the\nancient world were growing tired of the Egyptians\u2019 monopoly over the papyrus trade.\nParchment was made from treated animal skins that were scraped thin to create a flexible, even surface.\nParchment had several advantages over papyrus: It was more durable, both sides could be written on, and\nits trade wasn\u2019t monopolized by the Egyptians. Its spread coincided with another crucial development in\nthe history of the book. Between the 2nd and 4th centuries, the Romans began sewing folded sheets of\npapyrus or parchment together, and binding them between wooden covers. This form, called the codex,\nhas essentially the same structure as today\u2019s books. The codex was much more user-friendly than was the\npapyrus scroll: more portable, easier to store and handle, and less expensive to produce. It also allowed\nreaders to quickly flip between sections. While reading a scroll was a two-handed activity, a codex could\nbe propped open in front of a reader, allowing for note taking. Traditions changed slowly in the ancient\nworld, however, and the scroll remained the dominant form for secular works for several centuries. The\ncodex was the preferred form for early Christian texts, and the spread of Christianity eventually brought\nabout the dominance of the codex; by the 6th century CE, it had almost entirely replaced the scroll.\nThe next major innovation in the history of books, the use of block printing on paper, began in Tang\nDynasty China around 700 CE, though it wouldn\u2019t arrive in Europe for nearly 800 years. The first known\nexamples of text printed on paper are tiny, 2.5-inch-wide scrolls of Buddhist prayers commissioned by\nJapan\u2019s Empress Sh\u014dtoku in 764 CE. The earliest example of a dated, printed book is a Buddhist text\ncalled the Diamond Sutra (868 CE). Woodblock printing was a meticulous process that involved carving\nan entire page of text onto a wooden block, then inking and pressing the block to print a page.\nIn medieval Europe, however, scribes were still laboriously copying texts by hand. Book culture in the\nMiddle Ages was dominated by monasteries, which became centers of intellectual life. The largest\nmonasteries had rooms calledscriptoria where monks copied, decorated, and preserved both religious and\nsecular volumes. Many of the classical texts we have today owe their preservation to diligent medieval\nmonks, who thought of scholarship, even the study of secular and pre\u2013Christian writers, as a way to\nbecome closer to God. The hand-copied books produced in the Middle Ages were much more ornate than\nthe mass-produced books of today. These wereilluminated manuscripts that included painted\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n95 embellishments that were added on to the handwritten books. The word illuminate comes from the\nLatinilluminare, which means to light up, and some medieval books were literally made to shine through\napplications of gold or silver decorations. Other ornate additions included illustrations, decorative capital\nletters, and intricately drawn borders. The degree of embellishment depended on the book\u2019s intended use\nand the wealth of its owner. Medieval manuscripts were so highly valued that some scribes placed so-\ncalled book curses at the front of their manuscripts, warning that anyone who stole or defaced the copy\nwould be cursed. Written in a copy of the Vulgate Bible, for example, is this warning: \u201cWhoever steals this\nbook let him die the death; let be him be frizzled in a pan; may the falling sickness rage within him; may\nhe be broken on the wheel and be hanged.\u201d [3]\nThough illuminated books were highly prized, they were also expensive and labor-intensive to create. By\nthe end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in Avignon, France, held only a few thousand manuscripts\ncompared to the nearly half-million texts found at the Library of Alexandria in ancient\ntimes. [4]Bookmaking in the Western world became somewhat less expensive when paper emerged as the\nprimary writing surface. Making paper from rags and other fibers, a technique that originated in 2nd-\ncentury China, reached the Islamic world in the 8th century and led to a flowering of book culture there.\nBy the 12th century, Marrakesh, in modern-day Morocco, was said to have had a street lined with a\nhundred booksellers. But it wasn\u2019t until the 14th century that paper manufacturing began in earnest in\nEurope.\nGutenberg\u2019s Industry-Changing Invention\nPapermaking coincided with another crucial step forward in the history of books: Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s\ninvention of mechanical movable type in 1448. Though the simple act of crafting small, movable letters\nmay seem mundane in the contemporary world of digital devices and microchips, it is difficult to overstate\nthe importance of Gutenberg\u2019s invention and the effect it had on the world. The Biography Channel and\nA&E both named Gutenberg as the single most influential person of the second millennium, ahead of\nShakespeare, Galileo, and Columbus, and Time magazine cited movable type as the single most important\ninvention of the past 1,000 years. Through his invention, Gutenberg indisputably changed the world.\nMuch of Gutenberg\u2019s life is shrouded in mystery. It is known that he was a German goldsmith and book\nprinter and that he spent the 1440s collecting investors for a mysterious project. That invention turned\nout to be the printing press, which combined existing technologies\u2014such as the screw press, which was\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n96 already used for papermaking\u2014with his own innovation\u2014individual metal letters and punctuation marks\nthat could be independently rearranged\u2014to revolutionize how books were made. Though Gutenberg\nprobably printed other, earlier materials, it was the Bible he printed in 1455 that brought him renown. In\nhis small print shop in his hometown of Mainz, Germany, Gutenberg used his movable type press to print\n180 copies of the Bible, 135 on paper and 45 on vellum. [5] This book, commonly called the Gutenberg\nBible, ushered in Europe\u2019s so-called Gutenberg Revolution and paved the way for the commercial mass\nprinting of books. In 1978, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center of the University of Texas at\nAustin purchased a complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible for $2.4 million.\nOver the next few centuries, the printing press changed nearly everything about how books were made,\ndistributed, and read. Printing books was a vastly swifter system than handwriting books was, and paper\nwas much less expensive to produce than parchment. Before the printing press, books were generally\ncommissioned and then copied. The printing press meant that multiple identical editions of the same\nbook could be printed in a relatively short time, while it probably would\u2019ve taken a scribe at least a year to\nhandwrite the Bible. As Gutenberg\u2019s invention led to more and more printing shops springing up all over\nEurope, the very idea of what a book looked like began to change. In medieval times, books were the\nvaluable, rare product of hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of work, and no two were the same. After\nGutenberg, books could be standardized, plentiful, and relatively cheap to produce and disseminate. Early\nprinted books were made to look like illuminated manuscripts, complete with hand-drawn decorations.\nHowever, printers soon realized the economic potential of producing multiple identical copies of one text,\nand book printing soon became a speculative business, with printers trying to guess how many copies a\nparticular book could sell. By the end of the 15th century, 50 years after Gutenberg\u2019s invention of movable\ntype, printing shops had sprung up throughout Europe, with an estimated 300 in Germany alone.\nGutenberg\u2019s invention was a resounding success, and the printing and selling of books boomed. The Harry\nRansom Humanities Research Center estimates that before the invention of the printing press, the total\nnumber of books in all of Europe was around 30,000. By 1500 CE, the book was thriving as an industrial\nobject, and the number of books in Europe had grown to as many as 10 to 12 million. [6]\nEffects of the Mass Production of Books\nThe post-Gutenberg world was revolutionized by the advent of the printed book. One thing that did not\nsubstantially change, however, was the form of the book itself. Despite minor tweaks and alterations, the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n97 ancient form of the codex remained relatively intact. What did rapidly evolve was the way books were\nproduced and distributed and the way information circulated through the world.\nSimply put, the mechanical reproduction of books meant that there were more books available at a lower\ncost, and the growth of international trade allowed these books to have a wider reach. The desire for\nknowledge among the growing middle class and the new availability of classical texts from ancient Greece\nand Rome helped fuel the Renaissance, a period of celebration of the individual and of a turn toward\nhumanism. For the first time, texts could be widely dispersed, allowing political, intellectual, religious,\nand cultural ideas to spread widely. Also for the first time, many people could read the same books and be\nexposed to the same ideas at the same time, giving rise to mass media and mass culture. Science was\nrevolutionized as well. For example, standardized, widely dispersed texts meant that scientists in Italy\nwere exposed to the theories and discoveries of scientists in England. Because of improved\ncommunication, technological and intellectual ideas spread more quickly, enabling scientists from\ndisparate areas to more easily build on the breakthroughs and successes of others.\nAs the Renaissance progressed, the size of the middle class grew, as did literacy rates. Rather than a few\nhundred precious volumes housed in monastery or university libraries, books were available to people\noutside monastic or university settings, which meant that more books were available to women. In effect,\nthe mass production of books helped knowledge become democratized. However, this spread of\ninformation didn\u2019t proceed without resistance. Thanks in part to the spread of dissenting ideas, the\nRoman Catholic Church, the dominant institution of medieval Europe, found its control slipping. In 1487,\nonly a few decades after Gutenberg first printed his Bible, Pope Innocent VIII insisted that all books be\nprescreened by church authorities before they were allowed to be printed. [7] One book the church banned\nwas the Bible printed in any language other than Latin\u2014a language that few people outside of clerical or\nscholarly circles understood. In 1517, Martin Luther instigated the Protestant Reformation. He challenged\nthe church\u2019s authority by insisting that people had the right to read the Bible in their own language. The\nchurch rightly feared the spread of vernacular Bibles; the more people who had access to the text, the less\ncontrol the church was able to exert over how it was interpreted. Since the church\u2019s interpretation of the\nBible dictated in no small part the way many people lived their lives, the church\u2019s sway over the hearts and\nminds of the faithful was severely undermined by accessible printed Bibles and the wave of Protestantism\nthey encouraged. The Catholic Church\u2019s attempt to control the printing industry proved impossible to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n98 maintain, and over the next few centuries, the church would see its power decline significantly, as it was\nno longer the sole keeper of religious knowledge as it had been throughout the Middle Ages.\nThe Bible wasn\u2019t the only text that was beginning to be published in languages other than Latin. The\nRenaissance saw a growing interest in texts published in the vernacular, the speech of the \u201ccommon\npeople.\u201d As books became more available to the middle class, people wanted to read books written in their\nnative tongue. Early well-known works in the vernacular included Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy (first printed in\nItalian in 1472) and Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales(published in Middle English in the 15th century). Genres\nwith popular appeal, such as plays and poetry, became increasingly widespread. In the 16th and 17th\ncenturies, inexpensive chapbooks (the name derives, appropriately enough, from cheap books) became\npopular. Chapbooks were small and cheaply printed, and they often included popular ballads, humorous\nstories, or religious tracts. The proliferation of chapbooks showed just how much the Gutenberg\nRevolution had transformed the written word. In just a few hundred years, many people had access to\nreading material, and books would no longer be considered sacred objects.\nBecause of the high value placed on human knowledge during the Renaissance, libraries flourished during\nthis time period. As they had been in ancient Egypt, libraries were once again a way of displaying national\npower and wealth. The German State Library in Berlin was founded in 1661, and other European centers\nsoon followed, such as the National Library of Spain in Madrid in 1711 and the British Library (the world\u2019s\nlargest) in London in 1759. Libraries were also associated with universities, clubs, and museums;\nhowever, these were often only for subscribers. The United Kingdom\u2019s Public Libraries Act of 1850\nfostered the development of free, public lending libraries. After the American Civil War, public libraries\nflourished in the newly reunified United States, helped by fundraising and lobbying by women\u2019s clubs.\nPhilanthropist Andrew Carnegie helped bring the Renaissance ideals of artistic patronage and\ndemocratized knowledge into the 20th century when he helped found more than 1,700 public libraries\nbetween 1881 and 1919. [8]\nHistory of Document Control\nWhile Gutenberg\u2019s invention of the printing press ushered in an age of democratized knowledge and\nincipient mass culture, it also transformed the act of authorship, making writing a potentially profitable\nenterprise. Before the mass production of books, authorship had few financial rewards (unless a generous\npatron got involved). As a consequence, pre-Renaissance texts were often collaborative, and many books\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n99 didn\u2019t even list an author. The earliest concept of the copyright, from the time of the scriptoria, was who\nhad the right to copy a book by hand. The printed book, however, was a speculative commercial\nenterprise, in that large numbers of identical copies could be sold. The explosive growth of the European\nprinting industry meant that authors could potentially profit from the books they made and then wrote if\ntheir legal rights were recognized. In contemporary terms, copyright allows a person the right to exclude\nothers from copying, distributing, and selling a work. This is a right usually given to the creator, although\nthat right can be sold or otherwise transferred. Works not covered by copyright or for which the copyright\nhas expired are part of the public domain, which means that they are essentially public property and can\nbe used freely by anyone without permission or royalty payments.\nThe origins of contemporary copyright law are usually traced back to the Statute of Queen Anne. This law,\nenacted in England in 1710, was the first to recognize the legal rights of authors, though in an incomplete\nmanner. It granted a book\u2019s publisher 14 years of exclusive rights and legal protection, renewable for\nanother 14-year term if the author was still living. Anyone who infringed on a copyrighted work paid a\nfine, half of which went to the author and half to the government. Early copyright was intended to limit\nmonopoly and censorship, to provide a sense of stability to authors, and to promote learning by ensuring\nthat documents would be widely accessible.\nThe United States established its first copyright law not long after the Declaration of Independence. The\nU.S. Constitution granted Congress the power \u201cto promote the progress of science and useful arts, by\nsecuring for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and\ndiscoveries\u201d in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8. The first federal copyright law, the Copyright Law of 1790,\nwas modeled on the Statute of Queen Anne and it similarly granted exclusive rights for 14 years,\nrenewable for 14 more if the author was living at the end of the first term.\nThe \u201climited times\u201d mentioned in the Constitution have steadily lengthened since the 18th century. The\nCopyright Act of 1909 allowed for an initial 28-year term of copyright, which was renewable for one\nadditional 28-year term. The Copyright Act of 1976, which preempted the 1909 act, extended copyright\nprotection to \u201ca term consisting of the life of the author and 50 years after the author\u2019s death,\u201d was\nsubstantially longer than the original law\u2019s potential 56-year term. In 1998, copyright was extended even\nfurther, to 70 years after the author\u2019s death. The 1998 law, called the Copyright Term Extension Act, also\nadded a 20-year extension to all currently copyrighted works. This automatic extension meant that no\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n100 new works would enter the public domain until 2019 at the earliest. Critics of the Copyright Term\nExtension Act called it the Mickey Mouse Protection Act because the Walt Disney Company lobbied for\nthe law. [9]Because of the 20-year copyright extension, Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters\nremained out of the public domain, which meant that they were still the exclusive property of Disney.\nThe 1976 law also codified the terms of fair use for the first time. Fair-use law specifies the ways in which\na work (or parts of a work) under copyright could legally be used by someone other than the copyright\nholder for \u201cpurposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for\nclassroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\u201d That is, a book review\nquoting snippets of a book, or a researcher citing someone else\u2019s work is not infringing on copyright.\nGiven an Internet culture that thrives on remixes, linking, and other creative uses of source material, the\nboundaries of the legal definition of fair use have met with many challenges in recent years.\nHistory of the Book-Publishing Industry\nWith the exception of self-published works, the author isn\u2019t the person in charge of producing the book or\nsending it out into the world. These days, the tasks of editing, designing, printing, promoting, and\ndistributing a book generally fall to the book\u2019s publisher. Although authors are usually the ones with their\nnames prominently displayed on the spine, a published book is actually the product of many different\nkinds of labor by many different people.\nEarly book printers acted as publishers, because they produced pages and sold them commercially. In\nEngland, the Stationer\u2019s Company, which was essentially a printer\u2019s guild, had a monopoly over the\nprinting industry and was also allowed to censor texts. The Statute of Queen Anne, the 1710 copyright law,\ncame about partially as a result of some of these early publishers overstepping their bounds.\nIn the 19th-century United States, publishers fulfilled many roles, and it was not uncommon for one\ncompany to print, wholesale, and even retail their own books. Although bookstores and printers existed in\nthe United States, the Northeast emerged as the nation\u2019s publishing epicenter, with hotspots in\nPhiladelphia, New York, and Boston. During the 1800s, the U.S. book industry swiftly expanded. In 1820,\nthe books manufactured and sold in the United States totaled about $2.5 million; by 1850, even though\nthe price of books had dropped substantially, sales figures had quintupled. [10] Technological advances in\nthe 19th century, including machine-made paper and the Linotype typesetting machine, made book\npublishing simpler and more profitable. Many of today\u2019s large publishing companies were created in the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n101 19th century; for example, Houghton Mifflin originated in 1832; Little, Brown and Company formed in\n1837; and Macmillan was founded in Scotland in 1843 and opened its U.S. branch in 1869. By the turn of\nthe century, New York was the center of publishing in the United States.\nThe rapid growth of the publishing industry and evolving intellectual property laws meant that authors\ncould make money from their writing during this period. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise, then, to learn that the\nfirst literary agents also emerged in the late 19th century. Literary agents act as intermediaries between\nthe author and the publisher, negotiating contracts and parsing difficult legal language. The world\u2019s first\nliterary agent, A.P. Watt, worked in London in 1881 and essentially defined the role of the contemporary\nliterary agent\u2014he got paid to negotiate on behalf of the author. A former advertising agent, Watt decided\nto charge based on commission, meaning that he would take in a set percentage of his clients\u2019 earnings.\nWatt set the fee as 10 percent, which is still considered standard today.\nThe biggest change to hit publishing in the first half of the 20th century was the increasing popularity of\nthe paperback book. Books covered in less expensive, less durable paper existed since Renaissance\nchapbooks were invented, but they were usually crudely printed works that were meant only as passing\nentertainment. In 1935, the publishing industry was changed forever when Penguin Books Ltd., a\npaperback publisher, launched in England, ushered in the so-called paperback revolution. Instead of\nbeing crude and cheaply made, Penguin titles were simple but well designed. Though Penguin sold\npaperbacks for only 25 cents, it concentrated on providing works of literary merit, thus fundamentally\nchanging the idea of what quality books should look like. Some early Penguin titles included Ernest\nHemingway\u2019s A Farewell to Arms and Dashiell Hammett\u2019s The Thin Man. In the decades that followed,\nmore and more paperback publishing companies were launched by people hoping to capitalize on\nPenguin\u2019s success. The first U.S.-based paperback company was Pocket Books, founded in 1939. By 1960,\npaperbacks were outselling hardbacks in the United States. [11]\nThe second half of the 20th century was marked by the consolidation of the U.S. book-publishing industry\nand by a larger trend toward media consolidation. Between 1960 and 1989, about 578 mergers and\nacquisitions occurred in the U.S. book industry; between 1990 and 1995, 300 occurred; and between 1996\nand 2000, nearly 380 occurred. [12] This was just a part of the larger international trend toward mass\nmedia consolidation, where large international media empires acquired smaller companies in many\ndifferent industries. For example, the German media company Bertelsmann AG had aquired Bantam\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n102 Books, Doubleday, and Random House; London-based Pearson owned Viking, Penguin, Putnam, and the\nDutton Group; and AOL Time Warner owned Little, Brown and Company and Warner Books. Because\npublicly traded companies have obligations to their shareholders, the publishing industry found itself\npressured to turn increasingly high profits. By 2010, roughly 60 percent of all books sold in the United\nStates were published by six large publishing houses, often referred to as the Big Six (see ). [13] In the first\nyears of the third millennium, book publishing was an increasingly centralized, profit-driven industry.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Papyrus scrolls were the earliest forms of books, superseded in the 6th century by the codex. The codex\nwas more portable, sturdier, and easier to store, which made it a more popular format. During the Middle\nAges, books were handwritten on parchment and then painstakingly decorated. At this time, monasteries\nwere the centers of intellectual life, and most book copying happened in their scriptoria. Until the\ninvention of mechanical movable type, books were expensive and not widely available.\n\uf0b7 The Gutenberg Revolution changed how information circulated around the globe. The invention of\nmechanical movable type made books much cheaper and quicker to produce, which led to the swifter\nspread of ideas. Access to classical texts spurred the European Renaissance and led to higher literacy\nrates among women. With millions of books circulating in the world, popular literature soon emerged,\nsometimes in the form of inexpensive chapbooks.\n\uf0b7 Copyright law was originally meant to protect authors from censorship and to allow them to profit from\ntheir work. The first copyright law was England\u2019s Statute of Queen Anne in 1710. In the 20th century,\nAmerican copyright law steadily increased the terms of protection for works under copyright.\n\uf0b7 The publishing industry arose to help authors produce and distribute copies of their work. Early printers\nacted as wholesale booksellers. In the 20th century, paperback books revived the publishing industry by\nmaking high literature available in an inexpensive, portable format. By the turn of the century, book\npublishing was dominated by six publishing companies, themselves part of large media conglomerations.\nEXERCISES\nQuestions about the exact extent of fair use of copyrighted materials have been especially relevant in\nrecent years because of the popularity of using and manipulating copyrighted materials on the Internet.\nGo on a website with user-uploaded content (such as YouTube or Wikipedia) and find examples of works\nthat use copyrighted content in a way that you think is justified under fair use.

Identify the change in women\u2019s roles after the American Revolution and how it impacted early U.S.\nliterature.\n2. Name some distinctive aspects of American style used by 19th-century writers.\n3. Identify popular works of 20th-century fiction.\nFigure 3.4\nCommon Sense, a pamphlet published anonymously in 1776, argued for the American colonies\u2019 independence from\nBritain.\nAt the turn of the 18th century, the American colonies could only claim about 250 published\nbooks. [1] In 2010 alone, more than 288,000 new titles were published. As the United States has\ngrown and developed, books have grown and developed along with it. Sometimes books have\namplified differences within the nation, sometimes their authors have worked to proclaim a\ndistinctive American style; sometimes the author has tried to expose hypocrisies in government and\nsociety, and sometimes the author has celebrated America\u2019s multifaceted population. Throughout the\nhistory of the United States, books have influenced American popular culture and have been\ninfluenced by it as well.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n105 In the years leading up to the American Revolution, newspapers and pamphlets were the publication\nmethod of choice because they could be quickly printed and were ideal for circulating short political\nand news items at a moment of rapid change. Thomas Paine\u2019s Common Sense, first published\nanonymously in 1776, could be considered America\u2019s first bestseller. As literacy rates soared in post-\nindependence America and the nation became more stable, the market for longer books increased.\nWilliam Hill Brown\u2019s The Power of Sympathy: or, The Triumph of Nature, published in 1789, is\nconsidered the first American novel. Brown\u2019s epistolary novel, which is a novel made up of letters of\ncorrespondence, warned about the dangers of seduction. Brown\u2019s novel shares some features with a\nnovel published 2 years later, Charlotte Temple by Susannah Rowson, another cautionary tale about a\nwoman falling prey to seduction.\nThough women were often the subjects of popular novels, they were increasingly the audience as\nwell. Eighteenth-century Americans were influenced by Enlightenment values, which maintained\nthat a strong nation needed an educated, moral population. Although the public realm of education,\nemployment, and politics was dominated by men, women had control over the domestic sphere and\nthe education of the next generation. The 18th-century idea that American women should educate\ntheir children for the good of the emerging nation, sometimes called republican motherhood, helped\nto legitimize, expand, and improve women\u2019s education. Women\u2019s literacy rates rose sharply during\nthis period, and more and more books were tailored to women\u2019s interests, as women tended to have\nmore leisure time for reading. Authors such as Frances Burney and Mary Wollstonecraft wrote about\nissues facing women of the period and openly criticized the fixed role of females in society.\nHowever, in these early years of the American novel, some people found the form potentially\ndangerous and subversive because it was too entertaining and it appealed to people\u2019s, especially\nwomen\u2019s, imaginations. A character in The Boarding School by Hannah Webster Foster, a popular\nwriter of the time period, espouses this particular viewpoint:\nNovels, are the favorite and the most dangerous kind of reading, now adopted by the generality of young\nladies\u2026. Their romantic pictures of love, beauty, and magnificence, fill the imagination with ideas which\nlead to impure desires, a vanity of exterior charms, and a fondness for show and dissipation, by no means\nconsistent with that simplicity, modesty, and chastity, which should be the constant inmates of the female\nbreast. [2]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n106 Part of the perceived threat of novels was their widespread popularity with many different kinds of\npeople. An early biography of Susannah Rowson characterized the wide readership of her novel:\nIt has stolen its way alike into the study of the divine and into the workshop of the mechanic, into the\nparlor of the accomplished lady and the bed-chamber of her waiting maid, into the log-hut on the extreme\nborder of modern civilization and into the forecastle of the whale ship on the lonely ocean. It has been\nread by the grey bearded professor after his \u2018divine Plato\u2019; by the beardless clerk after balancing his\naccounts at night, by the traveler waiting for the next conveyance at the village inn; by the school girl\nstealthfully in her seat at school. [3]\nThese popular 18th-century novels were preoccupied with providing moral guidance and cautionary\ntales to the citizens of the newly formed United States. Questions of freedom and responsibility were\nparamount as the emerging nation attempted to establish a uniquely American literature.\nBooks in the 1800s\u2014How Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin Helped Start a War\nRowson\u2019s Charlotte Temple became the most popular book in the 1800s until Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was\npublished. [4] Written by abolitionist and preacher Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1852\u20149 years before the\nbeginning of the Civil War\u2014Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was a smash hit by any definition. An impassioned\ncritique of slavery that tugged on readers\u2019 emotions, the novel sold 300,000 copies in its first year and\nbecame the century\u2019s second-best-selling book after the Bible. [5]Stowe\u2019s novel has been credited with\nheightening tensions between the North and the South. The novel was not only popular domestically. The\nfirst London edition sold 200,000 copies in a year, and the book was the first American novel to be\ntranslated into Chinese. [6] The absence of international copyright law meant that Stowe was not\ncompensated for most of these translations. Many unauthorized stage versions of the play were produced\nas well, causing historians to theorize that more people saw theatrical adaptations of the play than read\nthe book. As with today\u2019s stage and film adaptations of books, some of these versions of Stowe\u2019s story were\nfaithful to the novel, while others changed the story\u2019s ending or even twisted the story to make it pro-\nslavery. In the early 1900s, 9 silent film versions of the novel were released, making Uncle Tom\u2019s\nCabin the most-filmed story of the silent film era. With her book, Stowe helped establish the political\nnovel as an important touchstone of American literature.\nFigure 3.5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n107 Before strict copyright law, many different versions of Stowe\u2019s novel cropped up.\nOther 19th-century writers in the United States concentrated on developing a uniquely American style, a\nmode of self-expression distinct from European models. James Fenimore Cooper, author of The Last of\nthe Mohicans (1826), wrote adventure stories that celebrated the American frontier, championing a theme\nthat would intrigue U.S. writers for centuries to come. Poet Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass (1855),\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n108 a collection of poems that shocked readers with its frank sexuality and fresh use of language. In contrast\nto most other English-language poets at the time, Whitman wrote in free verse, mimicking the rhythms of\nactual speech in his poems. He was purposefully informal; he valued everyday speech; he spoke openly\nabout sexual themes; and he was an important figure in establishing an American idiom that was open,\ninformal, and focused on the experiences of common people. Washington Irving, author of the now-iconic\nshort stories \u201cRip Van Winkle\u201d (1819) and \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d (1820), helped establish satire\nand wit as important aspects of the emerging American style.\nMark Twain famously used humor in his many works of journalism, travel writing, and fiction. Twain\u2019s\ncharacters\u2019 voices are funny, irreverant, and full of off-the-wall idioms and odd regional coinages. This\npassage, from the first chapter of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884), shows Twain\u2019s use of\ndistinctively American speech patterns: \u201cThe Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she\nwould sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and\ndecent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn\u2019t stand it no longer I lit out.\u201d [7] Twain was also\none of the first writers to use a then-newfangled invention\u2014the typewriter.\nEdgar Allan Poe is best known for writing macabre stories and poems like \u201cThe Raven\u201d (1845), \u201cThe Cask\nof Amontillado\u201d (1846), and \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d (1843). A master of the Gothic genre, Poe is also\ncredited with writing the first detective story, 1841\u2019s \u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue.\u201d (Some people also\ncredit Poe with the invention of the horror story and the science fiction story.) In this and other stories,\nPoe established many of the classic features of detective stories, including Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock\nHolmes tales: a brilliant, crime-solving detective who works outside the standard police system; the\ndetective\u2019s assistant or friend, who serves as narrator; and an emphasis on analysis and solving a crime\nthrough reason. Poe had such a strong effect on the mystery genre that the Mystery Writers of America\nannually give out the Edgar Awards, named in honor of Poe.\nAt the end of the 1800s, American literature could be broadly categorized as reflecting an interest in the\nnatural landscape, preoccupation with questions of identity (both of the individual and the nation), an\ninterest in humor or satire, a pride in common speech, and an interest in politics. An emerging interest in\nwhat we now call genre fiction was increasing and would become a fully fledged movement as the 20th\ncentury progressed.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n109 Twentieth Century and Beyond\nThe production of books in the 1900s was cheaper than ever because of improved technology. The 20th\ncentury saw a multiplicity of genres that began to better reflect the diversity of experiences and interests\nin the United States. Furthermore, the paperback revolution eroded the distinction between high and low\nart. By the end of the century, however, books were facing competition for attention with films, television,\nvideo games, and the Internet.\nIn 1900, L. Frank Baum published The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a novel set in the fantastical world of Oz.\nIt became the best-selling children\u2019s book for the next 2 years and went on to spawn 13 sequels. Baum\u2019s\nbook is considered part of the so-called golden age of children\u2019s literature, which is considered to have\nbegun with Lewis Carroll\u2019s Adventures of Alice in Wonderland (1865) and ended with A. A. Milne\u2019s\nWinnie-the-Pooh books (1924\u20131928). Along with children\u2019s literature, other kinds of genre fiction saw\ntheir birth or growth in the 20th century. Owen Wister\u2019s The Virginian (1902) and Zane Grey\u2019s Riders of\nthe Purple Sage(1912) established the Western as a uniquely American genre that would influence the\npopular Wild West films of the 1920s and beyond. Other genres including science fiction, horror, mystery,\nand romance sprung up out of the late-19th and early-20th dime novels, named for their cheap cost and\nknown for their sensational, quickly written stories. The dime novel gave way to the even-cheaper pulp\nmagazines and books, inexpensive publications named for the cheap pulp paper they were printed\non. Pulp stories were generally sensational and featured sordid tales of murder, prostitution, and gangster\nviolence; others told fantastical stories of aliens or monsters. The pulps were gleefully low culture and\nwere quite popular with readers. Conan the Barbarian, Tarzan, Zorro, and The Shadow all made their first\nappearances as characters in early pulps. The paperback revolution of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s gave\ngenre stories a wider reach in a more durable format.\nFigure 3.6\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n110 L. Frank Baum\u2019s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was the basis for the famous 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.\nFigure 3.7\nPulp publications captured readers with their lurid, colorful covers.\nWhile many 19th-century U.S. writers worked to create a distinctive American style, some 20th-century\nwriters aimed to debunk American myths. After World War II, the United States emerged as a dominant\nworld power. Some writers became preoccupied with critiquing American society and government.\nDissatisfied with the widespread 1950s ideals of conformity and homogeneity, Beat Generation authors\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n111 wrote in a freewheeling, informal style and proudly described their drug use and sexual exploits.\nTouchstone works of the Beat Generation include Allen Ginsberg\u2019s Howl and Other Poems (1956), Jack\nKerouac\u2019s On the Road (1957), and William S. Burroughs\u2019s Naked Lunch (1959). These books celebrated\nroad trips, drug trips, spritual yearning, distrust of the mass media, and gleeful obscenity, and they helped\npave the way for the hippie movement of the 1960s.\nAfter the end of the Cold War in 1991, American literature saw an upswing in books that expressed the\ndiversity of voices and experiences of late-20th-century America. Jhumpa Lahiri and Amy Tan wrote\nabout the immigrant experience; Sherman Alexie and Louise Erdrich penned acclaimed novels about\nNative American life; and Toni Morrison explored the political and historical dimensions of slavery and\nrace in the United States. Sometimes called multicultural literature, these and other books were\ncelebrated as a way to promote cross-cultural understanding by examining the different value systems,\nhistories, traditions, and speech patterns of people in America.\nThe 21st-century market has so far been dominated by several massively popular novel franchises\u2014such\nas Left Behind, Harry Potter, The Twilight Saga, and The Da Vinci Code\u2014that have collectively sold\nhundreds of millions of copies. These haven\u2019t only been popular as books; they\u2019ve also spawned equally\nlucrative films and merchandise tie-ins. Consumers who are so inclined can purchase Twilight Saga wall\ndecals, Harry Potter earrings, or Da Vinci Code board games. In some ways, such novel franchises harken\nback to Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin in the 19th century, which was a multiplatform success popular on the page,\nstage, and screen.\nDefining Obscenity: \u201cHowl\u201d Goes on Trial\nAllen Ginsberg\u2019s poem \u201cHowl\u201d met with strong reactions, both positive and negative, when it was released\nby City Lights Books in 1956. Ginsberg\u2019s poem was instantly notorious for its descriptions of sexual acts,\nboth heterosexual and homosexual, drug use, mental hospitals, and antiestablishment conspiracies. Many\nreaders were shocked by Ginsberg\u2019s words; however, that was precisely his intent. He once described\n\u201cHowl\u201d as \u201can emotional time bomb that would continue exploding in U.S. consciousness in case our\nmilitary-industrial-nationalist complex solidified.\u201d [8] In 1957, U.S. customs officials seized a shipment of\ncopies of the book on the grounds of obscenity, but soon after dropped their charges. However, the poem\u2019s\nlegal struggles weren\u2019t over; that same year, the California police sent plainclothes officers to City Lights\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n112 Bookstore to buy a copy and then promptly arrested the salesclerk and the store owner on charges of\nobscenity.\nThe \u201cHowl\u201d trial came in the same year as several other landmark Supreme Court cases that liberalized\nthe legal definition of obscenity in the United States. Before 1957, a more strict definition held that any\nmaterial with a possible immoral influence was obscene. This stance led to a ban on works by authors\nsuch as James Joyce and D. H. Lawrence. Under the new law, a work would be judged by \u201ccommunity\nstandards\u201d and could only be judged obscene if its \u201cdominant theme taken as a whole appeals to the\nprurient interest.\u201d In other words, books could no longer be deemed obscene on the basis of a single four-\nletter word. It also meant that the poem\u2019s obscenity would have to be judged against the relatively liberal\nstandards of San Francisco, where the police sting operation had taken place.\nThe ACLU leapt to City Lights\u2019 defense, and the presiding judge overturned the obscenity charge, citing\nthe poem\u2019s \u201credeeming social importance.\u201d In hindsight, the judge seems undoubtedly correct about the\npoem\u2019s social importance. \u201cHowl\u201d and the obscenity rulings of 1957 marked a crucial bridge between the\npost\u2013World War II years of enthusiastic patriotism and social conformity and the 1960s ethos of free love\nand antigovernment sentiment. By the time of Ginsberg\u2019s death in 1997, Howl and Other Poems had sold\nmore than 800,000 copies. [9]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 After the Revolutionary War, the United States was preoccupied with questions of self-determination.\nMany popular books reflected similar concerns about freedom through stories that explored the dangers\nof seduction for women. During this time, the ideals of republican motherhood also boosted literacy rates\nfor women, although reading novels was still seen by some as a potentially subversive activity.\n\uf0b7 During the 19th century, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was a national sensation that heightened divisions between\nthe North and South and that may have hastened the outbreak of the Civil War. The book was also\npopular as a stage play and, later, as a silent film. Other American writers of this period tried to establish\na distinctive American voice, whether through political engagement, satire, interest in the natural world,\nor use of regional dialects and idioms.\n\uf0b7 In the 20th century, genre fiction came to prominence through popular, sensational pulp novels. Genres\nsuch as children\u2019s literature, science fiction, mystery, and romance were given a boost beginning in the\n1930s by the spread of the paperback book. The second half of the 20th century was marked by writers\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n113 who challenged conformist ideas of the United States. The Beat Generation risked jail time for obscenity,\nwhile multicultural literature celebrated a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints.\n\uf0b7 The 21st century has so far been dominated by a number of novel franchises with massive sales and\nmultiple marketing tie-ins.\nEXERCISES\nConsider a novel or book from any era in U.S. history that has made an impression on you.

Determine the role of hardcover books in the publishing industry.\n2. Identify the differences in the two major formats of paperback books.\n3. Recognize the changes that e-books bring to the publishing industry.\nFrom ancient Egyptian papyrus scrolls to scrollable 21st-century e-books, a book can come in many\ndifferent formats. However, in some ways, it seems like the more things change, the more they stay\nthe same. In the same way that early printed books were painstakingly illuminated to look more like\nmedieval books, today\u2019s e-books use e-paper technology to mimic the look of a printed page. Even\nthe hardcover books we\u2019re familiar with today are direct descendants of the ancient codex.\nHardcover\nWhile the first codices enclosed bound papers between wooden covers (the word codex means block of\nwood in Latin), contemporary hardcover book covers are usually made of cardboard sheathed in cloth,\npaper, or leather. The printed pages of the book are either sewn or glued to the cover. Until the early\n1800s, most books were sold unbound. A buyer would purchase a sheath of printed papers that would be\nbound either by the bookseller or by a commissioned bindery. British publisher William Pickering is\nconsidered the first publisher to issue books in uniform cloth bindings in 1820. About a decade later, dust\njackets, the detachable outer covers that sheathe most hardback books today, arrived on the scene. Dust\njackets were initially meant only as a protective covering for the binding, but soon they became a place\nwhere designers could create a colorful and distinctive cover for a book.\nThe durability of hardcover books makes them attractive to both authors and book purchasers. However,\nthe competitive economics of today\u2019s publishing industry means that some books are never issued in\nhardcover. Because hardcover books are more expensive to produce and almost always cost more than\ntheir paperback equivalents, publishers tend to reserve the format for books that they expect will sell well.\nBased on projected sales, publishers must decide how big of a print run to order for a new hardcover\nbook. A book\u2019s print run refers to all the copies made in one setup of the printing apparatus. A failed book\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n115 may only have one, while a successful book may have 50 or more printings. Figuring out how many copies\nof a book to print is an inexact science, as publishers must essentially guess how well a book will sell.\nThere is no standard size for a print run. The U.K. edition of the first Harry Potter book had an initial\nprint run of only 500 copies; the U.S. print run of the seventh and final book in the series was a record-\nbreaking 12 million. When an initial print run is sold out, the book is either reprinted (these copies are\nconsidered a second printing) or is considered out of print. The contemporary publishing industry will\noften issue a first-run hardcover printing, followed by subsequent paperback editions.\nPaperback\nInexpensive paper-bound books have been around for centuries in formats like the chapbook, the British\npenny dreadful, and the American dime novel. However, the hardcover book, whether as an ancient codex\nor its contemporary equivalent, was the dominant format in the book world for thousands of years. The\nintroduction of a new format in the 1930s, the paperback, was considered revolutionary. The so-called\npaperback revolution began during the Great Depression, when paperbacks were marketed as inexpensive\nalternatives to hardcover editions. Penguin Books, Ltd., the first majorly successful paperback publishing\ncompany, kept prices low by ordering large print runs and selling books in nontraditional retailers, such\nas Woolworth\u2019s drugstores. Penguin also broke the traditional paperback mold by avoiding pulp fiction\nentertainment novels and instead printing books that were both cheap and intellectually stimulating.\nDonald Porter Geddes, the editor of Pocket Books, the first paperback publishing house in the United\nStates, spelled out this new approach to bookselling in 1944: \u201cThe best books apparently have the greatest\nappeal to the greatest number of people \u2026 the larger American public need no longer suffer from the\ndelusion that it is intellectually inferior, or, from a literary point of view, lacking in any aspect in good\ntaste, judgment, and appetite.\u201d [1] By 1960, when paperback books first outsold hardcovers, these early\npaperback innovators were proved right.\nWhile paperback publishing first issued only reprints of books that had already been issued in\nhardcover, paperback originals, books that had their initial print run as a paperback edition, emerged in\nthe 1950s. Paperback originals were another step in helping to remove the stigma from the paperback\nbook. In 1999, Jhumpa Lahiri\u2019s The Interpreter of Maladies was the first paperback original to win the\nPulitzer Prize for fiction.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n116 Today\u2019s books published in paperback are traditionally divided into two broad categories: mass-market\npaperbacks and trade paperbacks. Mass-market paperbacks are small, inexpensive editions that are\nsometimes issued after a hardcover edition, although many genre novels are printed only in mass-market\npaperback editions. Trade paperbacks are larger and generally of better quality. They\u2019re often printed on\nhigher-quality paper (sometimes acid-free paper). If the trade paperback follows a hardcover release, the\npaperback will be the same size as the hardcover and will have the same pagination and page layout as the\nhardcover edition.\nTraditionally, hardcover books have been seen as more prestigious than paperbacks, though that\nstereotype may be beginning to change. In recent years, some publishers of literary fiction were seeing 50\nto 75 percent of the hardcover books they shipped to bookstores returned to them unsold. As a response,\ncertain publishers opted to release books with uncertain sales potential as trade paperbacks, bypassing\nthe hardcover format entirely. \u201cGetting somebody to spend $22 on a book by an author who they\u2019ve never\nheard of is hard, but getting them to spend $13.95 on a paperback is much easier,\u201d Random House\u2019s Jane\nvon Mehren told The New York Times in 2006. [2] Some publishers are concerned that book reviewers\ndon\u2019t take trade paperback editions as seriously, but that too may be slowly changing. Another publishing\nstrategy is to release hardcover and trade paperback editions simultaneously rather than delaying the\npaperback edition for several months (or even years, in the case of exceptionally popular books). Such a\ntechnique is intended to drive up sales, taking advantage of initial publicity to capture readers who may be\nunwilling to pay the full hardcover price for a book.\nWhatever the concerns that publishers may have about issuing paperbacks, the format is still dominant in\nthe U.S. publishing industry. According to the American Association of Publishers, 35 percent of the\nbooks sold in 2009 were trade paperbacks; 35 percent hardcovers; 21 percent mass market paperbacks; 2\npercent audio books; 2 percent e-books; and 5 percent \u201cother.\u201d [3]\nE-Books\nThe hardcover book\u2019s expensive, durable binding seemed to say that it was an object intended for\nposterity. If paperback books disrupted the traditional concept of books by making them cheaper and\nmore portable, then the e-book is poised to cause an even greater change in how readers interact with a\ntext. E-books, also known as electronic or digital books, are the digital media equivalent of printed books.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n117 That is, they are books read on the screen of an electronic device, whether a cell phone, personal\ncomputer, or dedicated e-book reader.\nE-books differ from their print equivalents in many significant ways. For one, there\u2019s no physical\nproduction cost, which means that e-books are generally less expensive than traditional books. There\u2019s\nalso no cost to store or transport e-books. Because an e-book\u2019s publisher doesn\u2019t need to order a set print\nrun, a text issued as an e-book doesn\u2019t ever have to go out of print. E-books also appeal to readers who\nwant instant gratification. Instead of having to travel to a brick-and-mortar bookstore or wait for a\ndelivery, a reader can download an e-book in a matter of minutes.\nEarly e-books were mostly technical manuals or digitized versions of works in the public domain. As the\nInternet took off and as electronic devices became increasingly mobile, book publishers began to issue\ndigital editions of their works. In the first decade of the 21st century, various companies began issuing\nsoftware and hardware platforms for electronic books, each competing for dominance in this emerging\nmarket.\nAlthough e-books make up only a small percentage of total book sales, that number is growing. Dan\nBrown\u2019s The Lost Symbol, the follow-up to his massively popular novel The Da Vinci Code, sold more\ncopies as a Kindle e-book than as a hardcover in the first few days after its September 2009 release.\nHowever, e-book successes have led to a threat that faces many kinds of digital content: online piracy.\nOnly a few days after its initial release, Brown\u2019s novel had been illegally downloaded more than 100,000\ntimes. Some authors and publishers are concerned that Internet users expect free content and will find a\nway around spending money on e-books. American novelist Sherman Alexie recently voiced some of these\nanxieties, \u201cWith the open-source culture on the Internet, the idea of ownership\u2014of artistic ownership\u2014\ngoes away.\u201d [4] Other prominent authors have reacted to the e-book in various ways. In 2000, Stephen\nKing published his novella Riding the Bullet as a digital file that could only be read on a computer; in\ncontrast, J. K. Rowling has stated that the Harry Potter novels won\u2019t ever be released as e-\nbooks. [5] However, piracy has struck Rowling\u2019s novels as well. Every Harry Potter novel is available in\npirated form, either as a scanned copy or one that was manually typed out by fans.\nAnother concern with e-books is the possibility of digital decay. All an e-book is, after all, is a collection of\ndata saved to a disk. It turns out that digital formats tend to decay much faster than their physical\ncounterparts. [6] The swift turnover of digital devices is another concern; the possibility exists that a book\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n118 bought on a Kindle device in 2010 will be not be compatible with an equivalent device in 2035 or even\n2015.\nE-book sales still make up a small part of the overall book market, 3 to 5 percent by most estimates, but\ntheir sales increased by 177 percent in 2009. The New Yorker cites a projection that e-books will someday\naccount for between 25 and 50 percent of all book sales. [7] And with newer models of e-book readers, such\nas the iPad, boasting full-color screens and the ability to embed web links and video in a book\u2019s text, e-\nbooks may fundamentally reshape how people read in the future.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Hardcover books are a direct descendant of the ancient codex. Because they are more durable and more\nexpensive, they are considered more prestigious than paperback books. Traditionally, publishers order an\ninitial print run in hardcover, followed by a paperback release.\n\uf0b7 Paperback books are popular because they are more portable and less expensive than their hardcover\nequivalents are. Books issued in paperback can be either mass market paperbacks or trade paperbacks,\nwhich are pricier and higher quality. To stay competitive and to attract customers, publishers are\nreleasing some novels simultaneously in hardcover and paperback; other books skip hardcover and are\nreleased as paperback originals.\n\uf0b7 Although they make up only 3 to 5 percent of current sales, e-books have the potential to transform the\nbook market. Gaining currency with customers only in recent years, the e-book has the advantage of\nbeing cheaper and more portable than even most paperbacks. Some concerns with e-books include the\nprevalence of piracy and the potential for digital decay.\nEXERCISES\nCreate a list of the three book formats mentioned in this section, and then answer the following questions:\n\uf0b7 What are the features, advantages, and drawbacks of each format?\n\uf0b7 How do they differ?

Indicate the effect of blockbuster syndrome on the publishing industry.\n2. Recognize how book superstores have changed the business of bookselling.\n3. Identify the causes and results of price wars in the book industry.\nThe last few decades have seen a sharp rise in electronic entertainment. In 2009, the average\nAmerican spent 56 percent of his or her free time watching television, and less than 7 percent of his\nor her free time reading. [1] Video game sales rose 19 percent in 2008 alone and has continued to\nclimb. [2] In a world full of diverting entertainments, each clamoring for people\u2019s time, the publishing\nindustry is endeavoring to do everything it can to capture readers\u2019 attention.\nBlockbuster Syndrome\nImagine this scenario: A young author has spent the last few years slaving over his novel, rewriting and\nrevising until the whole thing is polished, exciting, and fresh. He sends out his manuscript and is lucky\nenough to find a literary agent eager to support his work. The agent sells the book to a publisher, netting\nthe author a decent advance; the book goes on to get great reviews, win some awards, and sell 20,000\ncopies. To most people, this situation sounds like a dream come true. But in an increasingly\ncommercialized publishing industry, with a focus on finding the next blockbuster, this burgeoning author\ncould be at risk of not getting his contract renewed.\nIn an industry increasingly dominated by large media corporations with obligations to stockholders,\npublishers feel pressured to turn a profit. As a result, they tend to bank on sure-fire best sellers, books that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n120 are expected to sell millions (or tens of millions) of copies, regardless of literary merit. The industry\u2019s\ngrowing focus on a few best-selling authors, called blockbuster syndrome, often means less support and\nless money for the vast majority of writers who don\u2019t sell millions of copies.\nAn advance is a sum of money paid to the author in expectation of future royalties. Royalties are a\npercentage of the book\u2019s sale price. So if a publisher gives an author a $10,000 advance, the author has\nimmediate access to that money, but the first $10,000 worth of royalties goes to the publisher. After that,\nthe author accumulates royalties for every book sold. In this way, an advance is a cross between a loan and\na gamble. If the book doesn\u2019t sell well, the author doesn\u2019t have to pay back the advance; however, he or\nshe won\u2019t earn any additional money from royalties. However, as many as three-quarters of books don\u2019t\nearn back their advances, meaning that their authors aren\u2019t making any money from sales at all.\nPublishers and writers are notoriously hush-hush about the actual sums of advances. A recent New York\nTimes article estimated an average advance to be around $30,000, though actual figures vary widely.\nKeeping in mind that a book may take years to write, it\u2019s clear that many authors are barely eking out a\nliving from their books.\nFigure 3.10 All Advances Aren\u2019t Equal\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n121 Bret Easton Ellis, American Psycho: $300,000 [3]\nDonna Tartt, A Secret History: $450,000 [4]\nSarah Palin, Going Rogue: $1.25 million [5]\nBill Clinton, My Life: $15 million [6]\nThese days, though, most of the media attention is focused on the few books each year that earn their\nauthors huge advances and go on to sell massive numbers of copies\u2014the blockbusters. But the focus on\nblockbusters can have a damaging effect on emerging writers. Because publishing is a gamble, advances to\nnew or unproven writers are generally low. Additionally, because a publishing house wants to recoup its\ninitial investment, a book that earned an author a big advance will probably get a big publicity budget.\nUnfortunately, the flip side is also true; a small advance equals a small publicity budget, which can trap\nmany authors in a vicious circle. In most cases, a book without much promotion won\u2019t have the chance to\nbecome a hit. If the book isn\u2019t a hit, the publisher can justify an even lower advance for the next book and\na lower budget for promotion. The result is that many books by emerging authors get lost in the shuffle.\n\u201cIt used to be that the first book earned a modest advance, then you would build an audience over time\nand break even on the third or fourth book,\u201d Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove/Atlantic, told The\nNew York Times. \u201cNow the first book is expected to land a huge advance and huge sales\u2026. Now we see a\nnovelist selling 9,000 hardcovers and 15,000 paperbacks, and they see themselves as a failure.\u201d [7]\nPotential blockbusters come at a high price for the publisher as well. They threaten to eat up publicity\nbudgets and dominate publishers\u2019 attention. An extremely large advance will only pay off if a massive\nnumber of copies sell, which makes the publishing houses less likely to take a gamble on unconventional\nbooks. This can also lead to a glut of similar books being pushed by publishers. After Dan Brown\u2019s huge\nsuccess with The Da Vinci Code in 2003, publishers rushed to capitalize on its success by releasing similar\nart history\u2013conspiracy\u2013mystery thrillers, few of which interested readers.\nTo a certain extent, focusing on blockbusters has worked for the publishing industry. Today\u2019s best sellers\nsell more copies than best sellers did 10 years ago and make up a larger share of the market. However,\noverall book sales have remained relatively flat over the past 8 years. [8] In other words, it\u2019s not that more\nbooks are being sold; it\u2019s just that more of the sales are taken up by a few heavily promoted blockbusters.\nHowever, the blockbuster syndrome threatens to damage the industry in other ways. In a bestseller-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n122 driven system, literature becomes a commodity, with little value placed on a book\u2019s artistic merit. Instead,\nthe primary concern is whether or not it will sell.\nAuthors Say \u201cNo\u201d to Blockbuster Syndrome\nDiscontented with the industry\u2019s focus on blockbusters at the expense of other books, some authors are\ntaking control of publishing their materials. John Edgar Wideman, a celebrated author who has been a\nfinalist for the National Book Award and is the only writer to have twice won the International\nPEN/Faulkner Award, had published more than 20 books through the traditional publishing system. But\nby the time he was looking for a home for his new collection of short stories, Briefs: Stories for the Palm\nof the Mind, he was ready for something new. \u201cThe blockbuster syndrome is a feature of our social\nlandscape that has gotten out of hand,\u201d Wideman said. \u201cUnless you become a blockbuster, your book\ndisappears quickly. It becomes not only publish or perish, but sell or perish.\u201d [9] Wideman eventually\ndecided to team up with self-publishing service Lulu, which meant that he gave up a traditional contract\nand advance payment in favor of greater control and a higher percentage of royalties. Other authors are\nturning away from the Big Six publishers and seeking out independent publishing houses, which often\noffer a different model. McSweeney\u2019s offers low advances and splits all profits with the author evenly.\nVanguard offers no advances, but gives authors high royalties and guarantees a high marketing budget.\nThese nontraditional systems allow authors more flexibility at a time when the publishing industry is\nfacing rapid change. As Wideman puts it, \u201cI like the idea of being in charge. I have more control over what\nhappens to my book. And I have more control over whom I reach.\u201d[10]\nRise (and Fall?) of Book Superstores\nFigure 3.11\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n123 Small independent bookstores find it hard to compete with multibillion-dollar corporations.\nIn the late 20th century, a new group of colossal bookstores reshaped the retail sale of books in the United\nStates. Two of the most well-known and prevalent book retailers, Barnes & Noble and Borders (the largest\nand second-largest book retailers in the United States, respectively) expanded extensively by building\nbook superstores in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These large retail outlets were different from\ntraditional, smaller bookstores in several ways. They often sold many products other than books,\nincluding calendars, paper goods, and gifts. Many also housed in-store cafes, allowing patrons to browse\nbooks and sip lattes under the same roof. They were also physically bigger, and such megastores drew\ncustomers because of their wide selection and their ability to offer books at deeply discounted prices.\nMany independent bookstores couldn\u2019t compete with the large chains\u2019 discounts, wide selection, and\nupscale atmosphere. According to Publishers Weekly, independent booksellers\u2019 share of the book market\nfell from 58 percent in 1972 to 15.2 percent in 1999. The American Booksellers Association (ABA), a trade\nassociation of bookstores, notes that its membership peaked at 5,200 in 1991; by 2005, that number had\ndeclined by 65 percent to 1,791. The decline of the independent bookstore coincided with the\nconsolidation of the publishing industry, and some supporters of independent bookstores see a link\nbetween the two. Richard Howorth\u2014owner of Square Books\u2014an independent bookstore in Oxford,\nMississippi, told Mother Jones magazine that \u201cwhen the independent bookselling market was thriving in\nthe \u201970s and \u201980s, more books were being published, more people were reading books, the sales of books\nwere higher, and publishers\u2019 profit margins were much greater. With the rise of the corporate retailing\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n124 powers and the consolidation in publishing, all of those things have declined.\u201d [11] Book superstores\nemphasized high turnover and high-volume sales, placing a higher emphasis on best sellers and returning\nsome mass market paperbacks to publishers after only 6 weeks on the shelves.\nIn more recent years, the book superstores have been under threat themselves. In 2009, large retailers\nlike Target, Wal-Mart, and Costco sold more books than both independent and chain bookstores\ncombined: nearly 45 percent of the market. [12] These stores didn\u2019t specialize in books and tended to offer\nonly a few heavily promoted blockbuster titles. Large discount stores were able to negotiate favorable\ndeals with publishers, allowing them to discount books even further than the book superstores in some\ncases. In more recent years, book superstores have also faced a threat from the increasing number of\nbooks purchased online. By 2010, Amazon, the largest online bookseller, accounted for around 15 to 20\npercent of book sales in the United States.\nThe shift away from independent bookstores and toward bigger retailers, such as book superstores or\nnonspecialized retailers like Wal-Mart, has benefited the industry in some ways, most notably by making\nbooks cheaper and more widely available. Mega best sellers, such as the Harry Potter and Twilight series,\nwere able to set sales records at least in part because the books were available for purchase in malls,\nconvenience stores, supermarkets, and other nontraditional venues. However, overall book sales have not\nrisen. And though consumers may be paying less for the books they\u2019re buying through these retailers,\nsomething may be lost as well. Jonathan Burnham, a publisher from HarperCollins, discussed the value of\nindependent bookstores with The New Yorker, noting how they are similar to community centers:\n\u201cThere\u2019s a serendipitous element involved in browsing\u2026. We walk in and know the people who work there\nand like to hear their reading recommendations.\u201d\nPrice Wars\nPart of the reason book superstores were able to crowd out smaller, independent retailers was their ability\nto offer significant discounts on a book\u2019s cover price. Because the big chains sell more books, they can\nnegotiate better deals with publishers and then pass the discounts to their customers. Not surprisingly,\ndeep discounts appeal to customers, which is one reason the book superstores gained such a large share of\nthe market in the 1990s. The superstores are able to sell books at such a sharp discount, sometimes even\nhalf of the listed price, because their higher sales numbers gives them bargaining power with the\npublishers. Independent bookstores buying the books at a normal wholesale rate (usually half the list\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n125 price) are at a disadvantage; they can\u2019t offer deep discounts and, as a result, they must charge higher\nprices than the superstores. This deep discount policy is one reason bestseller sales have risen over the\npast decade (book superstores usually slash the prices of best sellers and new releases only). However,\nlarge discounts encourage high-volume selling, and emphasizing on high-volume selling encourages safe\npublishing choices. That is, the bookstores are able to make up for the big discounts only by selling tons of\ncopies, and the books most likely to sell this well are blockbuster works by known-quantity authors. The\nthreat of deep discounting to independent bookstores and its effect on the publishing industry has led\nsome European countries to regulate prices. For example, bookstores in France are prohibited from\ndiscounting more than 5 percent, and in Germany, price slashing can only happen 9 months after a book\u2019s\nrelease.\nFigure 3.12\nWhy do books cost so much?\nThe brick-and-mortar bookstores aren\u2019t the only book discounters in the mix. Wal-Mart and other\ndiscount retailers sell more copies of the few books they offer at their stores, so they can negotiate even\nmore favorable terms with publishers. Amazon, which dominates online book sales, routinely discounts\nbooks 20 percent or more.\nRecently, other online retailers have been battling with Amazon for online bookselling profits. In October\n2009, as retailers were preparing for the holiday season, Amazon and Wal-Mart were preparing to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n126 compete for sales. When Wal-Mart announced that it would lower preorder prices for 10 highly\nanticipated hardcover books to only $10, Amazon responded by matching that price the next day. Wal-\nMart then lowered its price to $9, and Amazon followed. Unwilling to give up the fight, Wal-Mart lowered\nits prices by a penny, listing the 10 books at $8.99. Then another online retailer, Target, joined the fray,\nmatching Wal-Mart\u2019s price. Wal-Mart dropped its list prices again by a penny, listing the books at\n$8.98. [13]\nWhile there\u2019s something almost comical about major retailers duking it out over pennies, it\u2019s also a\nsituation that looked quite sobering to book retailers, from the independents to the large chains. The\nstartling thing about the price wars among Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart was that no one involved\nexpected to make any money from these deeply discounted books. At $9 or less, these books were almost\ncertainly selling at below retail value, perhaps by quite a lot.\nIf a book\u2019s list price is $35, its wholesale price is usually around half of that, in this case $17. If that book is\npriced at $9, that means an $8 loss to the retailer per copy. Although at first this seems like blatantly bad\nbusiness, it works because all of these retailers are in the business of selling much more than just books.\nLarge online retailers use the deep discounts to lure customers to their websites in hopes that these\ncustomers will purchase other items. These book sales are valuable as a way to drive traffic to the retailer\u2019s\nwebsite. However, booksellers whose main business is still selling books, such as local independent\nbookstores, don\u2019t have this luxury.\nE-books have also entered into the retail struggle. Because there are no printing costs, e-books are\nrelatively cheap to make, and consumers expect to see the savings on their end. However, book publishers\nstill sell the books to distributors at wholesale prices\u2014about half of the retail value of the hardcover\nversion. To tempt buyers, companies such as Amazon charge only $9.99 for the average e-title, once again\ntaking a loss. [14] Many hope to make up for it with device sales\u2014consumers are more likely to spend\nhundreds of dollars on an inexpensive reader to access cheaper books. While major retailers may\neventually profit from this method of sales, many wonder how long it will last. Author David Baldacci\nargues that a book industry based solely on profit isn\u2019t sustainable. In the end, he argues, \u201cthere won\u2019t be\nanyone selling [books] anymore because you just can\u2019t make any money.\u201d [15]\nThe inclination to focus only on net profits is indicative of a larger trend in the book industry. Retailers\nare getting larger, consumer prices are getting lower, and popular books are receiving the majority of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n127 attention. While this has positive short-term results for consumers and large retailers, the effects are\ndevastating for most authors and smaller bookstores. Although, in the end, the introduction of e-books\nmay be no more harmful to the industry than the explosion of paperbacks was in the early 1900s, the\nlarger emphasis on quantity over quality threatens the literary value and sustainability of books.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Blockbuster syndrome refers to the publishing industry\u2019s focus on books with best-seller potential at the\nexpense of works that may not sell as well. Fueled by high advances that depend on high publicity\nbudgets for high sales, less-popular authors often get lost in the shuffle. Such a system evaluates books\non the basis of their commercial potential instead of their literary merit. Fed up with what they see as the\nindustry\u2019s exclusive focus on blockbusters, some authors are turning away from the Big Six publishers and\nare opting for different publishing models.\n\uf0b7 Book superstores rose to prominence in the 1990s because their low prices, large selection, and upscale\natmosphere made them popular with book buyers. As a result, large numbers of independent bookstores\nclosed. In recent years, the book superstores have been losing market share to large retailers such as Wal-\nMart and Costco. These stores don\u2019t focus on selling books, and so they only have the shelf space for a\nfew best sellers, thus helping to fuel the blockbuster syndrome. Additionally, brick-and-mortar stores are\ncoming under threat from Amazon and other online retailers.\n\uf0b7 Stores that sell a large volume of books are able to negotiate favorable terms with book publishers and\nthey are then able to pass along deep discounts to their customers. Smaller independent bookstores are\nnot able to do this, and so are less economically competitive. Recent price wars have erupted among\nonline retailers like Amazon, Wal-Mart, and Target, who competed to sell books and e-books at prices so\nlow they amounted to a net loss per sale. Retailers used these sales to drive business to their websites\nand to encourage customers to buy other products.\nEXERCISES\nExamine a recent list of best sellers (some lists to consider include those by The New York Times, USA\nToday, Book Sense, or The Washington Post).

Determine the benefits and drawbacks of digital libraries.\n2. Define print-on-demand and self-publishing.\nThe book industry has changed enormously since its creation. From the invention of the papyrus\nscroll to the introduction of the e-book, new technologies continuously affect how people view and\nexperience literature. With the advent of digital media, old-media industries, such as the book\nindustry, must find ways to adapt. Some fear that this new technology will destroy the industry,\nwhile others maintain that it works to the industry\u2019s advantage. However, one thing is clear\u2014digital\ntechnology promises to reshape the publishing industry as we know it.\nE-Books\nThe first e-book readers were related to the personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, pocket-sized\nelectronics that could store and display large amounts of text, that became popular in the 1990s. However,\nearly e-book readers lingered on the market, popular in certain techy niches but unable to gain traction\nwith the wider population. Early e-readers had minimal battery life and text that was difficult to read.\nThrough the 2000s, technological advances allowed for smaller and sleeker models, the Apple iPhone and\nthe iPad helped make readers more comfortable with reading on a small screen. The second half of the\ndecade saw the release of many e-readers. The technology got a boost when Oprah Winfrey praised the\nKindle on her show in October 2008. By that holiday season, e-book reader sales were booming, and it\nwasn\u2019t just the technologically savvy individuals who were interested anymore. Despite being criticized by\nsome as providing an inferior reading experience to dedicated e-readers, the Apple iPad has been a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n130 powerful driving force behind e-book sales\u2014more than 1.5 million books were downloaded on the Apple\niPad during its first month of release in 2010. [1]\nE-books make up less than 5 percent of the current book market, but that number is growing. At the\nbeginning of 2010, Amazon had about 400,000 titles available for the Kindle device. Some devices offer\nwireless accessibility, meaning that an e-reader doesn\u2019t have to be connected to a computer to access\ntitles; an open Wi-Fi connection is all it needs. With access to a dazzling array of books available with just\na few clicks, it\u2019s no wonder the contemporary consumer seems enamored with the e-book. An e-book\nreader has the space to store thousands of titles in an object smaller and lighter than the average\nhardcover novel. And though the devices themselves can be expensive, e-books are usually cheaper than\ntheir hardcopy equivalents; sometimes they\u2019re even free. Thanks to efforts like the Gutenberg Project and\nGoogle Books (see Section 3.5.2 \"Digitizing Libraries\"), more than a million public domain titles are\navailable as free e-books.\nAnything that gets people excited about books and reading should be good for the publishing industry,\nright? Unfortunately for U.S. publishers, it\u2019s not that simple. Some publishers worry that e-book sales may\nactually end up hurting their bottom lines. During the Kindle\u2019s first year, Amazon essentially set the\nstandard price for bestselling or new release e-books at $9.99. Since Amazon was acting as a wholesaler\nand buying these books for half the publisher\u2019s list price\u2014generally around $25 for a new hardcover\u2014the\ncompany was selling these titles at a loss. However, for Amazon, a short-term loss might have had long-\nterm payoffs. At the start of 2010, the company controlled a 90 percent share of the e-book market. Faced\nwith e-books that cost less than $10, traditional publishers worried that consumers would avoid\npurchasing a new hardcover priced at $25 (or even a $13 trade paperback).\nFigure 3.13\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n131 Most e-readers are the size and shape of one hardcover book.\nIn January 2010, the conflict between Amazon and the publishing establishment came to a head.\nMacmillan, one of the six major publishing companies in the United States, suggested a new business\nmodel to Amazon, one that resembled the deal that the Big Six publishers had worked out with Apple for\ne-book sales on the Apple iPad. Essentially, Amazon had been able to buy books from publishers at\nwholesale rates\u2014half the hardcover list price\u2014and then set whatever retail price it wanted. This allowed\nAmazon to choose to sell books at a loss in the hope of convincing more people to buy Kindles. Macmillan\nproposed a system in which Amazon would act more as a commission-earning agent than a wholesaler. In\nMacmillan\u2019s proposed model, the publisher would set the retail price and take 70 percent of each sale,\nleaving 30 percent for the retailer. Macmillan couldn\u2019t force Amazon to agree to this deal, but the\npublisher could strike a hard bargain: If Amazon refused Macmillan\u2019s offer, it could still sell Macmillan\ntitles under the wholesale model, but the publisher would delay e-book editions for 7 months after\nhardcover releases. What followed was a standoff. Amazon didn\u2019t just reject Macmillan\u2019s proposal; it\nremoved the \u201cbuy\u201d button from all Macmillan books listed on its website (including print books),\nessentially refusing to sell Macmillan titles. However, after a few days, Amazon capitulated and agreed to\nMacmillan\u2019s terms, but not before issuing a strongly worded press release claiming that they agreed to sell\nMacmillan\u2019s titles \u201cat prices we believe are needlessly high for e-books,\u201d because \u201cMacmillan has a\nmonopoly over their own titles.\u201d [2] Still, Macmillan and the other publishers seem to have won this battle:\nAmazon agreed that e-books for most new fiction and nonfiction books for adults will be priced at $12.99\nto $14.99, though best sellers will still be $9.99. [3]\nBut the $10 book may be the least of the publishing industry\u2019s worries. At the start of 2010, more than half\nof the bestselling titles on Kindle were free. Some of these were public domain novels such as Pride and\nPrejudice, but many others were books by living authors being promoted by publishers by giving away the\nbook. The industry hasn\u2019t yet come to a consensus about the utility of free e-books. Some publishers\nconsider it a practice that devalues books in the eyes of customers. \u201cAt a time when we are resisting the\n$9.99 price of e-books,\u201d David Young of the Hachette Book Group told The New York Times, \u201cit is illogical\nto give books away for free.\u201d [4] Other publishers consider free e-books a promotional tool to build word-\nof-mouth and to introduce readers to new authors.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n132 Other e-books emerge from outside the traditional publishing system. Four of the five bestselling novels\nin Japan in 2007 were cell phone novels, books that were both written and intended to be read on cell\nphones. Cell-phone novels are traditionally written by amateurs who post them on free websites. Readers\ncan download copies at no cost, which means no one is making much of a profit from this new genre.\nAlthough the phenomenon has not caught on in the United States yet, the cell phone novel is feared by\nsome publishers as a further sign of the devaluation of books in a world where browsers expect content to\nbe free.\nWith e-book sales expected to triple by 2015, it\u2019s hard to say what such a quickly growing industry will\nlook like in the future. [5] Some people have theorized that e-readers will lead to an increasing popularity\nof the short story, which can be bought and read in short increments. Others have claimed that they\u2019ll\ndestroy the book industry as we know it. Whatever the future of books looks like, everything\u2014from the\nway books are produced to the way we read them\u2014continues to change rapidly because of new\ntechnologies.\nDigitizing Libraries\nThe idea of a digitized library has been around since the early years of the Internet. A digital library stores\nits materials in a digital format, accessible by computers. Some digital libraries can be accessed locally;\nothers can be accessed remotely through a computer network. Michael Hart founded Project Gutenberg,\nthe oldest digital library, in 1971, 3 years before the Internet went live. Hart\u2019s initial goal was to make\n10,000 of the most-consulted books publicly available and free by the end of the century. The forward-\nthinking Hart named his project after the inventor of the movable type printing press, perhaps realizing\nthat book digitization had the potential to revolutionize the way humans produce and read books as much\nas Gutenberg\u2019s invention had centuries earlier. At first, the process was slow for Hart and his fellow book-\ndigitizing volunteers because they were forced to copy text manually until 1989. In the early 1990s,\nscanners and text-recognition software allowed them to somewhat automate the process.\nFast-forward to 2010. Project Gutenberg\u2019s free online library boasts more than 30,000 public domain\nworks available for free download. Stanford University uses a robotic page-turning scanner machine to\ndigitize 1,000 book pages an hour. Stanford\u2019s partner in digital library production is Google Books, which\nhas scanned over 10 million books since it began Google Books in 2004. A Chinese company claims to\nhave digitized more than half of all books that have been published in Chinese since 1949. In 2006, The\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n133 New York Times estimated that humans have published at least 32 million books throughout history; the\nhuge push for book digitization makes it seem entirely possible that nearly all known books could be\ndigitized within 50 years. [6]\nSome liken the prospect of these widely accessible, easily searchable, free libraries to the proliferation of\nfree libraries in the 19th century, which led to a surge in literacy rates. One of Project Gutenberg\u2019s stated\ngoals is \u201cto break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy\u201d through its library of digitized books. [7]Digital\nlibraries make a huge selection of texts available to people with Internet access, giving them the amazing\npotential to democratize knowledge. As Bill McCoy, the general manager of Adobe\u2019s e-publishing\nbusiness, told The New York Times in 2006, \u201c[s]ome of us have thousands of books at home, can walk to\nwonderful big-box bookstores and well-stocked libraries and can getAmazon.com to deliver next day. The\nmost dramatic effect of digital libraries will be not on us, the well-booked, but on the billions of people\nworldwide who are underserved by ordinary paper books.\u201d [8] Digitized libraries can make fragile materials\navailable to browsers without damaging originals; academic libraries are also able to share important\ntexts without shipping books across the country.\nGoogle Books, the largest online library, is not run by an academic institution, though it does claim\nseveral as partners. The bulk of free digital books available from Google Books or elsewhere come from\nthe public domain, which constitutes approximately 15 percent of all books. Google Books has made over\na million of these titles fully and freely searchable and downloadable. Other works in the Google Books\ndigital library include in-print texts whose publishers have worked out a deal with Google. Some of these\ntitles have their full text available online; others allow only a limited number of page previews. As part of\nits partnership with publishers, a Google Books search result will often provide links to the publisher\u2019s\nwebsite and to booksellers.\nGoogle Books ran into trouble, however, when it began to digitize the millions of books with unclear legal\nstatus, such as out-of-print works that weren\u2019t yet in the public domain. Many of these are\nconsidered orphan works, meaning that no one is exactly sure who owns their copyright. In 2004, the site\nannounced plans to scan these texts and to make them searchable, but it would only show sentence-long\nsnippets to searchers. Copyright holders could ask Google to remove these snippets at any time. Google\nclaimed that this digitization plan would benefit authors, whose books would no longer linger in out-of-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n134 print limbo; it would also help researchers and readers, who would be able to locate (and perhaps\npurchase) previously unavailable works.\nPublishers and authors did not agree with Google. Many objected to Google\u2019s plan to scan first and look\ninto copyright ownership later; others saw Google\u2019s profiting from works still under copyright as a clear\nviolation of intellectual property law. In 2005, the Authors Guild of America and the American\nAssociation of Publishers (AAP) sued Google for \u201cmassive copyright infringement.\u201d Google argued that it\nwas essentially creating a massive online card catalog; the Authors Guild and AAP alleged that Google was\nattempting to monopolize information and profit from it. In 2008, Google agreed to a $125 million\nsettlement with the publishers and the Authors Guild. Some of that money would go directly to copyright\nholders; some would pay for legal fees; and some would go to found the Book Rights Registry, an\nindependent nonprofit association that would ensure content users (like Google) are paying copyright\nowners. Copyright owners would get money from Google and from potential book sales; Google would get\nmoney from advertisers, book sales, and institutional subscriptions by libraries.\nStill, not everyone agreed with the decision. The Open Book Alliance was formed by a diverse partnership\nof organizations, including Amazon, Internet Archive, and the National Writers Union, who fear that\nGoogle\u2019s proprietary control of so much copyrighted material was an antitrust violation. As the group\nstates on its website:\nWe will assert that any mass book digitization and publishing effort be open and competitive. The process\nof achieving this promise must be undertaken in the open, grounded in sound public policy and mindful\nof the need to promote long-term benefits for consumers rather than isolated commercial interests. The\nOpen Book Alliance will counter Google, the Association of American Publishers and the Authors\u2019 [sic]\nGuild\u2019s scheme to monopolize the access, distribution and pricing of the largest digital database of books\nin the world.\nAnother concern, which was mentioned earlier, in the digital library world is digital decay. One librarian\nat Harvard University told The New York Times that \u201c[w]e don\u2019t really have any methodology [to preserve\ndigital material] as of yet\u2026. We just store the disks in our climate-controlled stacks, and we\u2019re hoping for\nsome kind of universal Harvard guidelines.\u201d [9]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n135 Print-on-Demand and Self-Publishing\nPart of what made Gutenberg\u2019s printing press so revolutionary was that it allowed books to be mass\nproduced. In medieval times, readers often commissioned a scribe to copy a text by hand, a process that\ncould take months or even years. But despite their many conveniences, printed books carry their own\nrisks for authors and publishers. Producing books in bulk means that publishers are taking a gamble,\nattempting to publish enough books to satisfy demand, but not so many that unwanted copies linger in\nwarehouses. When a book doesn\u2019t sell as much as expected, the publisher may end up taking a loss if the\ncosts of publishing the book exceed the revenue from its sale. Interestingly, modern technology has made\nit feasible for some authors and publishers to turn to an updated version of the medieval model of\nproducing books on demand for specific customers, allowing them to avoid the risk of carrying a large\ninventory of books that may or may not sell. Print-on-demand, a system in which a book is printed only\nafter an order is received, and the increasing trend of self-publishing may reshape the industry in the 21st\ncentury.\nSelf-publishing\u2014a system that involves an author, not a third-party company, being in charge of\nproducing and publishing a work\u2014is not a new concept. Many authors self-published works in their\nlifetimes, including Virginia Woolf and Oscar Wilde. More recently, popular books like The Joy of\nCooking and the Chicken Soup for the Soul series had their origins in self-publishing. Many authors also\nself-publish when they\u2019re unable to get support from the traditional publishing world. Daniel Suarez\u2019s\ntechno-thriller Daemon was rejected by 48 agents before he opted for self-publishing. After creating\ninterest on blogs, Suarez eventually got a two-book deal with Dutton, an imprint of Random\nHouse. [10] Additionally, self-publishing can be an attractive option for authors who want control over their\nown content. Instead of leaving decisions up to the publisher, authors can control their own editing,\ndesigning, and marketing.\nOne major challenge for authors who choose to strike out on their own is the stigma that\u2019s sometimes\nattached to self-published books. Until recent years, most self-published authors went through the so-\ncalled vanity presses, which charge writers a premium for published copies of their books. As the name\nimplies, these types of self-publishing ventures were often seen as preying on writers\u2019 need to see their\nown work in print. To justify the cost of printing, a minimum order of a thousand copies was standard,\nand unless authors were able to find an audience, they had little hope of selling them all. Because there\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n136 was no quality control and vanity presses would usually publish anyone with money, some readers were\nskeptical of self-published books. Major retailers and distributors generally refused to carry them,\nmeaning that authors had to rely on their own marketing efforts to sell the books. Before the advent of the\nInternet, this usually meant either selling copies in person or relying on mail-order catalogs, neither of\nwhich is a very reliable way to sell enough copies to recoup costs.\nHowever, beginning in the early 2000s, self-publishing has changed dramatically. Advances made in\npublishing technology have made it easier for self-published books to more closely resemble traditionally\npublished ones. Free professional typesetting software has allowed writers to format their text for the\npage; Adobe Photoshop and similar programs have made image editing and graphic design feasible for\namateurs and professionals. The Internet has revolutionized marketing and distribution, allowing authors\nof books about niche subjects to reach a worldwide audience. As a result, many new Internet-based self-\npublishing companies have sprung up, offering a variety of services. Some companies, such as Lulu\nEnterprises and CreateSpace, feature a low-cost service without many bells and whistles; others offer a\npackage of services that may include professional editing, cover design, and marketing. The process has\nbecome streamlined as well. For example, to publish a book with Lulu, an author just has to upload a PDF\nof a properly formatted text file; decide what size, paper, and binding options to use; and make a cover\nusing a premade template. Self-published books are generally quicker to produce and allow an author a\nhigher share of the royalties, though it usually costs more on a per-book basis. As a result, self-published\nbooks often have a higher list price.\nWhereas vanity publishers were stigmatized for charging authors sometimes thousands of dollars to\npublish their books, creating a book using the services of Lulu or CreateSpace doesn\u2019t cost the author\nanything. That\u2019s because users who upload their content aren\u2019t creating an actual, physical copy of a book;\ninstead, they\u2019re essentially making a potential volume. With print-on-demand technology, books aren\u2019t\nprinted until an order is placed, which significantly lowers the financial risk for self-publishers. Print-on-\ndemand is especially useful for books with a limited or niche audience. Print-on-demand isn\u2019t only being\nused by self-publishers; both small presses and academic publishers are using the technology for older\nbooks without much of an audience. With print-on-demand, books that may only sell a few dozen copies a\nyear can stay in print without the publisher having to worry about printing a full run of copies and being\nstuck with unsold inventory.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n137 Although some self-published authors manage to find a huge audience, most don\u2019t. Bob Young, the\nfounder of Lulu, told the London Times that his goal is to publish 1 million books that each sell 100\ncopies, rather than 100 books that sell 1 million copies each. [11] Lulu and other enterprising self-\npublishers disrupt the traditional notion of the publishing house, which acted as a sort of gatekeeper for\nthe book industry\u2014ushering a few talented, lucky writers in and keeping others out. In the world of self-\npublishing, there are no barriers\u2014anyone with a book in a PDF file can whip up a nice-looking paperback\nin under 1 hour. This has democratized the industry, allowing writers who had been rejected by the\ntraditional publishers to find their own audience. But it has also meant that a lot of writing with little\nliterary merit has been published as well. Additionally, if a bestseller in the Lulu world is a book that sells\n500 copies, as Bob Young told the London Times, then few authors are going to be able to make a living\nthrough self-publishing. Indeed, most of the self-publishing success stories involve writers whose self-\npublished efforts sold well enough to get them a book deal with one of the traditional publishing houses, a\nsign that for better or for worse, the traditional publishing model still has the social cachet and sales to\ndominate the industry.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 E-books have been increasing in popularity with customers since the 1990s. However, the publishing\nindustry is worried that setting the price for e-books at $9.99, as Amazon initially did for most titles,\nwould turn consumers away from buying more expensive physical books. Amazon lost money on every\n$9.99 e-book but hoped that the low prices would act as an incentive to buy its e-book reader, the Kindle\ndevice. In 2010, Macmillan and other publishers forced Amazon to change its pricing model to give\npublishers more control over e-book prices.\n\uf0b7 Digital libraries began with Project Gutenberg in 1971. Digitized books allow anyone with an Internet\nconnection access to millions of volumes, and some advocates hope that digital libraries will lead to a rise\nin global literacy rates. Millions of books in the public domain are available for free download. Google\nBooks, the largest digital library, has run into trouble with its plan to digitize as many books as possible,\neven books under current copyright. The Open Book Alliance accuses Google of monopolizing copyrighted\ncontent to make a profit.\n\uf0b7 Self-publishing used to carry a social stigma as well as a high cost. Thanks to print-on-demand services,\nself-publishing is an increasingly popular option for amateur and professional writers. It appeals to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n138 authors who may have a niche audience or who want more control over their work. Print-on-demand\nmakes it possible for books to never go out of print.\nEXERCISES\nGo to the website of a company that specializes in print-on-demand or self-publishing services and\nexamine some of the books featured there.

[1] Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Wall Street\nJournal, had announced that his paper was launching a new section, one covering local stories north of\nWall Street, something that had been part of The New York Times\u2019 focus since it first began over a century\nbefore. New York Times Chairman Arthur Sultzberger Jr. and CEO Janet Robinson pertly responded to\nthe move, welcoming the new section and acknowledging the difficulties a startup can face when\ncompeting with the well-established New York Times. [2]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n143 Despite The New York Times\u2019 droll response, Murdoch\u2019s decision to cover local news indeed presented a\nthreat to the newspaper, particularly as the two publications continue their respective moves from the\nprint to the online market. In fact, some believe that The Wall Street Journal\u2019s decision to launch the new\nsection has very little to do with local coverage and everything to do with the Internet. Newspapers are in\na perilous position: Traditional readership is declining even as papers are struggling to create a profitable\nonline business model. Both The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times are striving to remain\nrelevant as competition is increasing and the print medium is becoming unprofitable.\nIn light of the challenges facing the newspaper industry, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s new section may have\na potentially catastrophic effect on The New York Times. Wired magazine described the decision, calling\nit \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d to \u201cstarve the enemy and capture territory.\u201d [3] By offering advertising space at a discount\nin the new Metro section, The Journal would make money while partially cutting The Times off from\nsome of its primary support. Wired magazine also noted that the additional material would be available to\nsubscribers through the Internet, on smartphones, and on the iPad. [4]\nAttracting advertising revenue from The New York Times may give The Wall Street Journal the financial\nedge it needs to lead in the online news industry. As newspapers move away from print publications to\nonline publications, a strong online presence may secure more readers and, in turn, more advertisers\u2014\nand thus more revenue\u2014in a challenging economic climate.\nThis emerging front in the ongoing battle between two of the country\u2019s largest newspapers reveals a\nproblem the newspaper industry has been facing for sometime. New York has long been a battleground\nfor other newspapers, but before Murdoch\u2019s decision, these two papers coexisted peacefully for over 100\nyears, serving divergent readers by focusing on different stories. However, since the invention of radio,\nnewspapers have worried about their future. Even though readership has been declining since the 1950s,\nthe explosion of the Internet and the resulting accessibility of online news has led to an unprecedented\ndrop in subscriptions since the beginning of the 21st century. Also hit hard by the struggling economy\u2019s\nreluctant advertisers, most newspapers have had to cut costs. Some have reinvented their style to appeal\nto new audiences. Some, however, have simply closed. As this struggle for profit continues, it\u2019s no surprise\nthat The Wall Street Journal is trying to outperform The New York Times. But how did newspapers get to\nthis point? This chapter provides historical context of the newspaper medium and offers an in-depth\nexamination of journalistic styles and trends to illuminate the mounting challenges for today\u2019s industry.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n144 [1] Eliot Van Burskirk, \u201cPrint War Between NYT and WSJ Is Really About Digital,\u201d Wired, April 26,\n2010, http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/print-war-between-nyt-and-wsj-is-really-about-digital.\n[2] Eliot Van Burskirk, \u201cPrint War Between NYT and WSJ Is Really About Digital,\u201d Wired, April 26,\n2010, http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/print-war-between-nyt-and-wsj-is-really-about-digital.\n[3] Eliot Van Burskirk, \u201cPrint War Between NYT and WSJ Is Really About Digital,\u201d Wired, April 26,\n2010, http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/print-war-between-nyt-and-wsj-is-really-about-digital.\n[4] Eliot Van Burskirk, \u201cPrint War Between NYT and WSJ Is Really About Digital,\u201d Wired, April 26,\n2010, http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/04/print-war-between-nyt-and-wsj-is-really-about-digital.\n4.1\nHistory of Newspapers\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describe the historical roots of the modern newspaper industry.\n2. Explain the effect of the penny press on modern journalism.\n3. Define sensationalism and yellow journalism as they relate to the newspaper industry.\nOver the course of its long and complex history, the newspaper has undergone many\ntransformations. Examining newspapers\u2019 historical roots can help shed some light on how and why\nthe newspaper has evolved into the multifaceted medium that it is today. Scholars commonly credit\nthe ancient Romans with publishing the first newspaper, Acta Diurna, or daily doings, in 59 BCE.\nAlthough no copies of this paper have survived, it is widely believed to have published chronicles of\nevents, assemblies, births, deaths, and daily gossip.\nIn 1566, another ancestor of the modern newspaper appeared in Venice, Italy. These avisi, or\ngazettes, were handwritten and focused on politics and the military conflicts. However, the absence\nof printing-press technology greatly limited the circulation for both the Acta Diurna and the Venetian\npapers.\nThe Birth of the Printing Press\nFigure 4.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n145 Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press exponentially increased the rate at which printed materials could be\nreproduced.\nJohannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press drastically changed the face of publishing. In 1440, Gutenberg\ninvented a movable-type press that permitted the high-quality reproduction of printed materials at a rate\nof nearly 4,000 pages per day, or 1,000 times more than could be done by a scribe by hand. This\ninnovation drove down the price of printed materials and, for the first time, made them accessible to a\nmass market. Overnight, the new printing press transformed the scope and reach of the newspaper,\npaving the way for modern-day journalism.\nEuropean Roots\nThe first weekly newspapers to employ Gutenberg\u2019s press emerged in 1609. Although the papers\u2014\nRelations: Aller Furnemmen, printed by Johann Carolus, and Aviso Relations over Zeitung, printed by\nLucas Schulte\u2014did not name the cities in which they were printed to avoid government persecution, their\napproximate location can be identified because of their use of the German language. Despite these\nconcerns over persecution, the papers were a success, and newspapers quickly spread throughout Central\nEurope. Over the next 5 years, weeklies popped up in Basel, Frankfurt, Vienna, Hamburg, Berlin, and\nAmsterdam. In 1621, England printed its first paper under the title Corante, or weekely newes from Italy,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n146 Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, France and the Low Countreys. By 1641, a newspaper was printed\nin almost every country in Europe as publication spread to France, Italy, and Spain.\nFigure 4.3\nNewspapers are the descendants of the Dutchcorantos and the German pamphlets of the 1600s.\nThese early newspapers followed one of two major formats. The first was the Dutch-style corantos, a\ndensely packed two- to four-page paper, while the second was the German-style pamphlet, a more\nexpansive 8- to 24-page paper. Many publishers began printing in the Dutch format, but as their\npopularity grew, they changed to the larger German style.\nGovernment Control and Freedom of the Press\nBecause many of these early publications were regulated by the government, they did not report on local\nnews or events. However, when civil war broke out in England in 1641, as Oliver Cromwell and Parliament\nthreatened and eventually overthrew King Charles I, citizens turned to local papers for coverage of these\nmajor events. In November 1641, a weekly paper titled The Heads of Severall Proceedings in This Present\nParliament began focusing on domestic news. [1] The paper fueled a discussion about the freedom of the\npress that was later articulated in 1644 by John Milton in his famous treatise Areopagitica.\nFigure 4.4\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n147 John Milton\u2019s 1644Areopagitica, which criticized the British Parliament\u2019s role in regulating texts and helped pave the way\nfor the freedom of the press.\nAlthough the Areopagitica focused primarily on Parliament\u2019s ban on certain books, it also addressed\nnewspapers. Milton criticized the tight regulations on their content by stating, \u201c[w]ho kills a man kills a\nreasonable creature, God\u2019s image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of\nGod, as it were in the eye.\u201d [2] Despite Milton\u2019s emphasis on texts rather than on newspapers, the treatise\nhad a major effect on printing regulations. In England, newspapers were freed from government control,\nand people began to understand the power of free press.\nPapers took advantage of this newfound freedom and began publishing more frequently. With biweekly\npublications, papers had additional space to run advertisements and market reports. This changed the\nrole of journalists from simple observers to active players in commerce, as business owners and investors\ngrew to rely on the papers to market their products and to help them predict business developments. Once\npublishers noticed the growing popularity and profit potential of newspapers, they founded daily\npublications. In 1650, a German publisher began printing the world\u2019s oldest surviving daily paper,\nEinkommende Zeitung, and an English publisher followed suit in 1702 with London\u2019s Daily Courant.\nSuch daily publications, which employed the relatively new format of headlines and the embellishment of\nillustrations, turned papers into vital fixtures in the everyday lives of citizens.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n148 Colonial American Newspapers\nNewspapers did not come to the American colonies until September 25, 1690, when Benjamin Harris\nprinted Public Occurrences, Both FORREIGN and DOMESTICK. Before fleeing to America for publishing\nan article about a purported Catholic plot against England, Harris had been a newspaper editor in\nEngland. The first article printed in his new colonial paper stated, \u201c[t]he Christianized Indians in some\nparts of Plimouth, have newly appointed a day of thanksgiving to God for his Mercy.\u201d [3] The other articles\nin Public Occurrences, however, were in line with Harris\u2019s previously more controversial style, and the\npublication folded after just one issue.\nFourteen years passed before the next American newspaper, The Boston News-Letter, launched. Fifteen\nyears after that, The Boston Gazette began publication, followed immediately by the American Weekly\nMercury in Philadelphia. Trying to avoid following in Harris\u2019s footsteps, these early papers carefully\neschewed political discussion to avoid offending colonial authorities. After a lengthy absence, politics\nreentered American papers in 1721, when James Franklin published a criticism of smallpox inoculations\nin the New England Courant. The following year, the paper accused the colonial government of failing to\nprotect its citizens from pirates, which landed Franklin in jail.\nAfter Franklin offended authorities once again for mocking religion, a court dictated that he was\nforbidden \u201cto print or publish The New England Courant, or any other Pamphlet or Paper of the like\nNature, except it be first Supervised by the Secretary of this Province.\u201d [4] Immediately following this\norder, Franklin turned over the paper to his younger brother, Benjamin. Benjamin Franklin, who went on\nto become a famous statesman and who played a major role in the American Revolution, also had a\nsubstantial impact on the printing industry as publisher of The Pennsylvania Gazette and the conceiver of\nsubscription libraries.\nThe Trial of John Peter Zenger\nFigure 4.5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n149 The New York Weekly Journal founder John Peter Zenger brought controversial political discussion to the New\nYork press.\nBoston was not the only city in which a newspaper discussed politics. In 1733, John Peter Zenger\nfounded The New York Weekly Journal. Zenger\u2019s paper soon began criticizing the newly appointed\ncolonial governor, William Cosby, who had replaced members of the New York Supreme Court when he\ncould not control them. In late 1734, Cosby had Zenger arrested, claiming that his paper contained \u201cdivers\nscandalous, virulent, false and seditious reflections.\u201d [5] Eight months later, prominent Philadelphia lawyer\nAndrew Hamilton defended Zenger in an important trial. Hamilton compelled the jury to consider the\ntruth and whether or not what was printed was a fact. Ignoring the wishes of the judge, who disapproved\nof Zenger and his actions, the jury returned a not guilty verdict to the courtroom after only a short\ndeliberation. Zenger\u2019s trial resulted in two significant movements in the march toward freedom of the\npress. First, the trial demonstrated to the papers that they could potentially print honest criticism of the\ngovernment without fear of retribution. Second, the British became afraid that an American jury would\nnever convict an American journalist.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n150 With Zenger\u2019s verdict providing more freedom to the press and as some began to call for emancipation\nfrom England, newspapers became a conduit for political discussion. More conflicts between the British\nand the colonists forced papers to pick a side to support. While a majority of American papers challenged\ngovernmental authorities, a small number of Loyalist papers, such as James Rivington\u2019s New York\nGazetteer, gave voice to the pro-British side. Throughout the war, newspapers continued to publish\ninformation representing opposing viewpoints, and the partisan press was born. After the revolution, two\nopposing political parties\u2014the Federalists and the Republicans\u2014emerged, giving rise to partisan\nnewspapers for each side.\nFreedom of the Press in the Early United States\nIn 1791, the nascent United States of America adopted the First Amendment as part of the Bill of Rights.\nThis act states that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the\nfree exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people\npeaceable to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d [6] In this one sentence,\nU.S. law formally guaranteed freedom of press.\nHowever, as a reaction to harsh partisan writing, in 1798, Congress passed the Sedition Act, which\ndeclared that any \u201cwriting, printing, uttering, or publishing any false, scandalous and malicious writing or\nwritings against the government of the United States\u201d was punishable by fine and imprisonment. [7] When\nThomas Jefferson was elected president in 1800, he allowed the Sedition Act to lapse, claiming that he\nwas lending himself to \u201ca great experiment \u2026 to demonstrate the falsehood of the pretext that freedom of\nthe press is incompatible with orderly government.\u201d [8] This free-press experiment has continued to\nmodern times.\nNewspapers as a Form of Mass Media\nAs late as the early 1800s, newspapers were still quite expensive to print. Although daily papers had\nbecome more common and gave merchants up-to-date, vital trading information, most were priced at\nabout 6 cents a copy\u2014well above what artisans and other working-class citizens could afford. As such,\nnewspaper readership was limited to the elite.\nThe Penny Press\nAll that changed in September 1833 when Benjamin Day created The Sun. Printed on small, letter-sized\npages, The Sun sold for just a penny. With the Industrial Revolution in full swing, Day employed the new\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n151 steam-driven, two-cylinder press to print The Sun. While the old printing press was capable of printing\napproximately 125 papers per hour, this technologically improved version printed approximately 18,000\ncopies per hour. As he reached out to new readers, Day knew that he wanted to alter the way news was\npresented. He printed the paper\u2019s motto at the top of every front page of The Sun: \u201cThe object of this\npaper is to lay before the public, at a price within the means of every one, all the news of the day, and at\nthe same time offer an advantageous medium for advertisements.\u201d [9]\nThe Sun sought out stories that would appeal to the new mainstream consumer. As such, the paper\nprimarily published human-interest stories and police reports. Additionally, Day left ample room for\nadvertisements. Day\u2019s adoption of this new format and industrialized method of printing was a huge\nsuccess. The Sun became the first paper to be printed by what became known as the penny press. Prior to\nthe emergence of the penny press, the most popular paper, New York City\u2019s Courier and Enquirer, had\nsold 4,500 copies per day. By 1835, The Sun sold 15,000 copies per day.\nFigure 4.6\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n152 Benjamin Day\u2019s Sun, the first penny paper. The emergence of the penny press helped turn newspapers into a truly\nmass medium.\nAnother early successful penny paper was James Gordon Bennett\u2019s New York Morning Herald, which\nwas first published in 1835. Bennett made his mark on the publishing industry by offering nonpartisan\npolitical reporting. He also introduced more aggressive methods for gathering news, hiring both\ninterviewers and foreign correspondents. His paper was the first to send a reporter to a crime scene to\nwitness an investigation. In the 1860s, Bennett hired 63 war reporters to cover the U.S. Civil War.\nAlthough the Herald initially emphasized sensational news, it later became one of the country\u2019s most\nrespected papers for its accurate reporting.\nGrowth of Wire Services\nAnother major historical technological breakthrough for newspapers came when Samuel Morse invented\nthe telegraph. Newspapers turned to emerging telegraph companies to receive up-to-date news briefs\nfrom cities across the globe. The significant expense of this service led to the formation of the Associated\nPress (AP) in 1846 as a cooperative arrangement of five major New York papers: the New York Sun,\nthe Journal of Commerce, the Courier and Enquirer, the New York Herald, and the Express. The success\nof the Associated Press led to the development of wire services between major cities. According to the AP,\nthis meant that editors were able to \u201cactively collect news as it [broke], rather than gather already\npublished news.\u201d [10] This collaboration between papers allowed for more reliable reporting, and the\nincreased breadth of subject matter lent subscribing newspapers mass appeal for not only upper- but also\nmiddle- and working-class readers.\nYellow Journalism\nIn the late 1800s, New York World publisher Joseph Pulitzer developed a new journalistic style that relied\non an intensified use of sensationalism\u2014stories focused on crime, violence, emotion, and sex. Although he\nmade major strides in the newspaper industry by creating an expanded section focusing on women and by\npioneering the use of advertisements as news, Pulitzer relied largely on violence and sex in his headlines\nto sell more copies. Ironically, journalism\u2019s most prestigious award is named for him. His New York\nWorld became famous for such headlines as \u201cBaptized in Blood\u201d and \u201cLittle Lotta\u2019s Lovers.\u201d [11] This\nsensationalist style served as the forerunner for today\u2019s tabloids. Editors relied on shocking headlines to\nsell their papers, and although investigative journalism was predominant, editors often took liberties with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n153 how the story was told. Newspapers often printed an editor\u2019s interpretation of the story without\nmaintaining objectivity.\nAt the same time Pulitzer was establishing the New York World, William Randolph Hearst\u2014an admirer\nand principal competitor of Pulitzer\u2014took over the New York Journal. Hearst\u2019s life partially inspired the\n1941 classic filmCitizen Kane. The battle between these two major New York newspapers escalated as\nPulitzer and Hearst attempted to outsell one another. The papers slashed their prices back down to a\npenny, stole editors and reporters from each other, and filled their papers with outrageous, sensationalist\nheadlines. One conflict that inspired particularly sensationalized headlines was the Spanish-American\nWar. Both Hearst and Pulitzer filled their papers with huge front-page headlines and gave bloody\u2014if\nsometimes inaccurate\u2014accounts of the war. As historian Richard K. Hines writes, \u201cThe American Press,\nespecially \u2018yellow presses\u2019 such as William Randolph Hearst\u2019s New York Journal [and] Joseph\nPulitzer\u2019s New York World \u2026 sensationalized the brutality of the reconcentrado and the threat to\nAmerican business interests. Journalists frequently embellished Spanish atrocities and invented\nothers.\u201d [12]\nComics and Stunt Journalism\nAs the publishers vied for readership, an entertaining new element was introduced to newspapers: the\ncomic strip. In 1896, Hearst\u2019s New York Journal published R. F. Outcault\u2019s the Yellow Kid in an attempt\nto \u201cattract immigrant readers who otherwise might not have bought an English-language\npaper.\u201d [13]Readers rushed to buy papers featuring the successful yellow-nightshirt-wearing character. The\ncartoon \u201cprovoked a wave of \u2018gentle hysteria,\u2019 and was soon appearing on buttons, cracker tins, cigarette\npacks, and ladies\u2019 fans\u2014and even as a character in a Broadway play.\u201d [14] Another effect of the cartoon\u2019s\npopularity was the creation of the term yellow journalism to describe the types of papers in which it\nappeared.\nFigure 4.7\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n154 R. F. Outcault\u2019s the Yellow Kid, first published in William Randolf Hearst\u2019s New York Journal in 1896.\nPulitzer responded to the success of the Yellow Kid by introducing stunt journalism. The publisher hired\njournalist Elizabeth Cochrane, who wrote under the name Nellie Bly, to report on aspects of life that had\npreviously been ignored by the publishing industry. Her first article focused on the New York City Lunatic\nAsylum on Blackwell Island. Bly feigned insanity and had herself committed to the infamous asylum. She\nrecounted her experience in her first article, \u201cTen Days in a Madhouse.\u201d \u201cIt was a brilliant move. Her\nmadhouse performance inaugurated the performative tactic that would become her trademark reporting\nstyle.\u201d [15] Such articles brought Bly much notoriety and fame, and she became known as the first stunt\njournalist. Although stunts such as these were considered lowbrow entertainment and female stunt\nreporters were often criticized by more traditional journalists, Pulitzer\u2019s decision to hire Bly was a huge\nstep for women in the newspaper business. Bly and her fellow stunt reporters \u201cwere the first\nnewspaperwomen to move, as a group, from the women\u2019s pages to the front page, from society news into\npolitical and criminal news.\u201d [16]\nDespite the sometimes questionable tactics of both Hearst and Pulitzer, each man made significant\ncontributions to the growing journalism industry. By 1922, Hearst, a ruthless publisher, had created the\ncountry\u2019s largest media-holding company. At that time, he owned 20 daily papers, 11 Sunday papers, 2\nwire services, 6 magazines, and a newsreel company. Likewise, toward the end of his life, Pulitzer turned\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n155 his focus to establishing a school of journalism. In 1912, a year after his death and 10 years after Pulitzer\nhad begun his educational campaign, classes opened at the Columbia University School of Journalism. At\nthe time of its opening, the school had approximately 100 students from 21 countries. Additionally, in\n1917, the first Pulitzer Prize was awarded for excellence in journalism.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Although newspapers have existed in some form since ancient Roman times, the modern newspaper\nprimarily stems from German papers printed in the early 1600s with Gutenberg\u2019s printing press. Early\nEuropean papers were based on two distinct models: the small, dense Dutch corantos and the larger,\nmore expansive German weeklies. As papers began growing in popularity, many publishers started\nfollowing the German style.\n\uf0b7 The Sun, first published by Benjamin Day in 1833, was the first penny paper. Day minimized paper size,\nused a new two-cylinder steam-engine printing press, and slashed the price of the paper to a penny so\nmore citizens could afford a newspaper. By targeting his paper to a larger, more mainstream audience,\nDay transformed the newspaper industry and its readers.\n\uf0b7 Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst were major competitors in the U.S. newspaper industry in\nthe late 1800s. To compete with one another, the two employed sensationalism\u2014the use of crime, sex,\nand scandal\u2014to attract readers. This type of journalism became known as yellow journalism. Yellow\njournalism is known for misleading stories, inaccurate information, and exaggerated detail.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Explain how objective journalism differs from story-driven journalism.\n2. Describe the effect of objectivity on modern journalism.\n3. Describe the unique nature of literary journalism.\nLocation, readership, political climate, and competition all contribute to rapid transformations in\njournalistic models and writing styles. Over time, however, certain styles\u2014such as sensationalism\u2014\nhave faded or become linked with less serious publications, like tabloids, while others have\ndeveloped to become prevalent in modern-day reporting. This section explores the nuanced\ndifferences among the most commonly used models of journalism.\nObjective versus Story-Driven Journalism\nIn the late 1800s, a majority of publishers believed that they would sell more papers by reaching out to\nspecific groups. As such, most major newspapers employed a partisan approach to writing, churning out\npolitical stories and using news to sway popular opinion. This all changed in 1896 when a then-failing\npaper, The New York Times, took a radical new approach to reporting: employing objectivity, or\nimpartiality, to satisfy a wide range of readers.\nThe Rise of Objective Journalism\nAt the end of the 19th century, The New York Times found itself competing with the papers of Pulitzer and\nHearst. The paper\u2019s publishers discovered that it was nearly impossible to stay afloat without using the\nsensationalist headlines popularized by its competitors. Although The New York Times publishers raised\nprices to pay the bills, the higher charge led to declining readership, and soon the paper went bankrupt.\nAdolph Ochs, owner of the once-failing Chattanooga Times, took a gamble and bought The New York\nTimes in 1896. On August 18 of that year, Ochs made a bold move and announced that the paper would no\nlonger follow the sensationalist style that made Pulitzer and Hearst famous, but instead would be \u201cclean,\ndignified, trustworthy and impartial.\u201d [1]\nThis drastic change proved to be a success. The New York Times became the first of many papers to\ndemonstrate that the press could be \u201ceconomically as well as ethically successful.\u201d [2] With the help of\nmanaging editor Carr Van Anda, the new motto \u201cAll the News That\u2019s Fit to Print,\u201d and lowered prices, The\nNew York Times quickly turned into one of the most profitable impartial papers of all time. Since the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n158 newspaper\u2019s successful turnaround, publications around the world have followed The New York Times\u2019\nobjective journalistic style, demanding that reporters maintain a neutral voice in their writing.\nThe Inverted Pyramid Style\nOne commonly employed technique in modern journalism is the inverted pyramid style. This style\nrequires objectivity and involves structuring a story so that the most important details are listed first for\nease of reading. In the inverted pyramid format, the most fundamental facts of a story\u2014typically the who,\nwhat, when, where, and why\u2014appear at the top in the lead paragraph, with nonessential information in\nsubsequent paragraphs. The style arose as a product of the telegraph. The inverted pyramid proved useful\nwhen telegraph connections failed in the middle of transmission; the editor still had the most important\ninformation at the beginning. Similarly, editors could quickly delete content from the bottom up to meet\ntime and space requirements. [3]\nThe reason for such writing is threefold. First, the style is helpful for writers, as this type of reporting is\nsomewhat easier to complete in the short deadlines imposed on journalists, particularly in today\u2019s fast-\npaced news business. Second, the style benefits editors who can, if necessary, quickly cut the story from\nthe bottom without losing vital information. Finally, the style keeps in mind traditional readers, most of\nwho skim articles or only read a few paragraphs, but they can still learn most of the important\ninformation from this quick read.\nFigure 4.8\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n159 Interpretive Journalism\nDuring the 1920s, objective journalism fell under critique as the world became more complex. Even\nthough The New York Times continued to thrive, readers craved more than dry, objective stories. In\n1923, Time magazine launched as the first major publication to step away from simple objectivity to try to\nprovide readers with a more analytical interpretation of the news. As Time grew, people at some other\npublications took notice, and slowly editors began rethinking how they might reach out to readers in an\nincreasingly interrelated world.\nDuring the 1930s, two major events increased the desire for a new style of journalism: the Great\nDepression and the Nazi threat to global stability. Readers were no longer content with the who, what,\nwhere, when, and why of objective journalism. Instead, they craved analysis and a deeper explanation of\nthe chaos surrounding them. Many papers responded with a new type of reporting that became known\nas interpretive journalism.\nInterpretive journalism, following Time\u2019s example, has grown in popularity since its inception in the\n1920s and 1930s, and journalists use it to explain issues and to provide readers with a broader context for\nthe stories that they encounter. According to Brant Houston, the executive director of Investigative\nReporters and Editors Inc., an interpretive journalist \u201cgoes beyond the basic facts of an event or topic to\nprovide context, analysis, and possible consequences.\u201d [4] When this new style was first used, readers\nresponded with great interest to the new editorial perspectives that newspapers were offering on events.\nBut interpretive journalism posed a new problem for editors: the need to separate straight objective news\nfrom opinions and analysis. In response, many papers in the 1930s and 1940s \u201cintroduced weekend\ninterpretations of the past week\u2019s events \u2026 and interpretive columnists with bylines.\u201d [5] As explained by\nStephen J. A. Ward in his article, \u201cJournalism Ethics,\u201d the goal of these weekend features was to\n\u201csupplement objective reporting with an informed interpretation of world events.\u201d [6]\nCompetition From Broadcasting\nThe 1930s also saw the rise of broadcasting as radios became common in most U.S. households and as\nsound\u2013picture recordings for newsreels became increasingly common. This broadcasting revolution\nintroduced new dimensions to journalism. Scholar Michael Schudson has noted that broadcast news\n\u201creflect[ed] \u2026 a new journalistic reality. The journalist, no longer merely the relayer of documents and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n160 messages, ha[d] become the interpreter of the news.\u201d[7] However, just as radio furthered the interpretive\njournalistic style, it also created a new problem for print journalism, particularly newspapers.\nSuddenly, free news from the radio offered competition to the pay news of newspapers. Scholar Robert W.\nMcChesney has observed that, in the 1930s, \u201cmany elements of the newspaper industry opposed\ncommercial broadcasting, often out of fear of losing ad revenues and circulation to the\nbroadcasters.\u201d [8]This fear led to a media war as papers claimed that radio was stealing their print stories.\nRadio outlets, however, believed they had equal right to news stories. According to Robert W. McChesney,\n\u201ccommercial broadcasters located their industry next to the newspaper industry as an icon of American\nfreedom and culture.\u201d [9] The debate had a major effect on interpretive journalism as radio and\nnewspapers had to make decisions about whether to use an objective or interpretive format to remain\ncompetitive with each other.\nThe emergence of television during the 1950s created even more competition for newspapers. In response,\npaper publishers increased opinion-based articles, and many added what became known as op-ed pages.\nAn op-ed page\u2014short foropposite the editorial page\u2014features opinion-based columns typically produced\nby a writer or writers unaffiliated with the paper\u2019s editorial board. As op-ed pages grew, so did\ninterpretive journalism. Distinct from news stories, editors and columnists presented opinions on a\nregularly basis. By the 1960s, the interpretive style of reporting had begun to replace the older descriptive\nstyle. [10]\nLiterary Journalism\nStemming from the development of interpretive journalism, literary journalism began to emerge during\nthe 1960s. This style, made popular by journalists Tom Wolfe (formerly a strictly nonfiction writer) and\nTruman Capote, is often referred to as New Journalism and combines factual reporting with sometimes\nfictional narration. Literary journalism follows neither the formulaic style of reporting of objective\njournalism nor the opinion-based analytical style of interpretive journalism. Instead, this art form\u2014as it is\noften termed\u2014brings voice and character to historical events, focusing on the construction of the scene\nrather than on the retelling of the facts.\nImportant Literary Journalists\nFigure 4.9\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n161 The works of Tom Wolfe are some of the best examples of literary journalism of the 1960s.\nTom Wolfe was the first reporter to write in the literary journalistic style. In 1963, while his newspaper,\nNew York\u2019s Herald Tribune, was on strike, Esquire magazine hired Wolfe to write an article on\ncustomized cars. Wolfe gathered the facts but struggled to turn his collected information into a written\npiece. His managing editor, Byron Dobell, suggested that he type up his notes so that Esquire could hire\nanother writer to complete the article. Wolfe typed up a 49-page document that described his research\nand what he wanted to include in the story and sent it to Dobell. Dobell was so impressed by this piece\nthat he simply deleted the \u201cDear Byron\u201d at the top of the letter and published the rest of Wolfe\u2019s letter in\nits entirety under the headline \u201cThere Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake\nStreamline Baby.\u201d The article was a great success, and Wolfe, in time, became known as the father of new\njournalism. When he later returned to work at the Herald Tribune, Wolfe brought with him this new style,\n\u201cfusing the stylistic features of fiction and the reportorial obligations of journalism.\u201d [11]\nTruman Capote responded to Wolfe\u2019s new style by writing In Cold Blood, which Capote termed a\n\u201cnonfiction novel,\u201d in 1966. [12] The tale of an actual murder that had taken place on a Kansas farm some\nyears earlier, the novel was based on numerous interviews and painstaking research. Capote claimed that\nhe wrote the book because he wanted to exchange his \u201cself-creative world \u2026 for the everyday objective\nworld we all inhabit.\u201d [13] The book was praised for its straightforward, journalistic style. New York\nTimes writer George Plimpton claimed that the book \u201cis remarkable for its objectivity\u2014nowhere, despite\nhis involvement, does the author intrude.\u201d [14] After In Cold Blood was finished, Capote criticized Wolfe\u2019s\nstyle in an interview, commenting that Wolfe \u201c[has] nothing to do with creative journalism,\u201d by claiming\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n162 that Wolfe did not have the appropriate fiction-writing expertise. [15] Despite the tension between these\ntwo writers, today they are remembered for giving rise to a similar style in varying genres.\nThe Effects of Literary Journalism\nAlthough literary journalism certainly affected newspaper reporting styles, it had a much greater impact\non the magazine industry. Because they were bound by fewer restrictions on length and deadlines,\nmagazines were more likely to publish this new writing style than were newspapers. Indeed, during the\n1960s and 1970s, authors simulating the styles of both Wolfe and Capote flooded magazines such\nas Esquire and The New Yorker with articles.\nLiterary journalism also significantly influenced objective journalism. Many literary journalists believed\nthat objectivity limited their ability to critique a story or a writer. Some claimed that objectivity in writing\nis impossible, as all journalists are somehow swayed by their own personal histories. Still others,\nincluding Wolfe, argued that objective journalism conveyed a \u201climited conception of the \u2018facts,\u2019\u201d which\n\u201coften effected an inaccurate, incomplete story that precluded readers from exercising informed\njudgment.\u201d [16]\nAdvocacy Journalism and Precision Journalism\nThe reactions of literary journalists to objective journalism encouraged the growth of two more types of\njournalism: advocacy journalism and precision journalism. Advocacy journalists promote a particular\ncause and intentionally adopt a biased, nonobjective viewpoint to do so effectively. However, serious\nadvocate journalists adhere to strict guidelines, as \u201can advocate journalist is not the same as being an\nactivist\u201d according to journalist Sue Careless. [17] In an article discussing advocacy journalism, Careless\ncontrasted the role of an advocate journalist with the role of an activist. She encourages future advocate\njournalists by saying the following:\nA journalist writing for the advocacy press should practice the same skills as any journalist. You don\u2019t\nfabricate or falsify. If you do you will destroy the credibility of both yourself as a working journalist and\nthe cause you care so much about. News should never be propaganda. You don\u2019t fudge or suppress vital\nfacts or present half-truths. [18]\nDespite the challenges and potential pitfalls inherent to advocacy journalism, this type of journalism has\nincreased in popularity over the past several years. In 2007, USA Today reporter Peter Johnson stated,\n\u201c[i]ncreasingly, journalists and talk-show hosts want to \u2018own\u2019 a niche issue or problem, find ways to solve\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n163 it, and be associated with making this world a better place.\u201d [19] In this manner, journalists across the\nworld are employing the advocacy style to highlight issues they care about.\nOprah Winfrey: Advocacy Journalist\nTelevision talk-show host and owner of production company Harpo Inc., Oprah Winfrey is one of the\nmost successful, recognizable entrepreneurs of the late-20th and early-21st centuries. Winfrey has long\nbeen a news reporter, beginning in the late 1970s as a coanchor of an evening television program. She\nbegan hosting her own show in 1984, and as of 2010, theOprah Winfrey Show is one of the most popular\ntelevision programs on the air. Winfrey has long used her show as a platform for issues and concerns,\nmaking her one of today\u2019s most famous advocacy journalists. While many praise Winfrey for using her\ncelebrity to draw attention to causes she cares about, others criticize her techniques, claiming that she\nuses the advocacy style for self-promotion. As one critic writes, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how Oprah\u2019s endless self-\npromotion of how she spent millions on a school in South Africa suddenly makes her \u2018own\u2019 the \u2018education\nniche.\u2019 She does own the trumpet-my-own-horn niche. But that\u2019s not \u2018journalism.\u2019\u201d [20]\nYet despite this somewhat harsh critique, many view Winfrey as the leading example of positive advocacy\njournalism. Sara Grumbles claims in her blog \u201cBreaking and Fitting the Mold\u201d: \u201cOprah Winfrey obviously\npractices advocacy journalism\u2026. Winfrey does not fit the mold of a \u2018typical\u2019 journalist by today\u2019s\nstandards. She has an agenda and she voices her opinions. She has her own op-ed page in the form of a\nmillion dollar television studio. Objectivity is not her strong point. Still, in my opinion she is a\njournalist.\u201d[21]\nRegardless of the arguments about the value and reasoning underlying her technique, Winfrey\nunquestionably practices a form of advocacy journalism. In fact, thanks to her vast popularity, she may be\nthe most compelling example of an advocacy journalist working today.\nPrecision journalism emerged in the 1970s. In this form, journalists turn to polls and studies to\nstrengthen the accuracy of their articles. Philip Meyer, commonly acknowledged as the father of precision\njournalism, says that his intent is to \u201cencourage my colleagues in journalism to apply the principles of\nscientific method to their tasks of gathering and presenting the news.\u201d [22] This type of journalism adds a\nnew layer to objectivity in reporting, as articles no longer need to rely solely on anecdotal evidence;\njournalists can employ hard facts and figures to support their assertions. An example of precision\njournalism would be an article on voting patterns in a presidential election that cites data from exit polls.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n164 Precision journalism has become more popular as computers have become more prevalent. Many\njournalists currently use this type of writing.\nConsensus versus Conflict Newspapers\nAnother important distinction within the field of journalism must be made\nbetween consensus journalism and conflict journalism. Consensus journalism typically takes place in\nsmaller communities, where local newspapers generally serve as a forum for many different voices.\nNewspapers that use consensus-style journalism provide community calendars and meeting notices and\nrun articles on local schools, events, government, property crimes, and zoning. These newspapers can\nhelp build civic awareness and a sense of shared experience and responsibility among readers in a\ncommunity. Often, business or political leaders in the community own consensus papers.\nConversely, conflict journalism, like that which is presented in national and international news articles\nin The New York Times, typically occurs in national or metropolitan dailies. Conflict journalists define\nnews in terms of societal discord, covering events and issues that contravene perceived social norms. In\nthis style of journalism, reporters act as watchdogs who monitor the government and its activities.\nConflict journalists often present both sides of a story and pit ideas against one another to generate\nconflict and, therefore, attract a larger readership. Both conflict and consensus papers are widespread.\nHowever, because they serve different purposes and reach out to differing audiences, they largely do not\ncompete with each other.\nNiche Newspapers\nNiche newspapers represent one more model of newspapers. These publications, which reach out to a\nspecific target group, are rising in popularity in the era of Internet. As Robert Courtemanche, a certified\njournalism educator, writes, \u201c[i]n the past, newspapers tried to be everything to every reader to gain\ncirculation. That outdated concept does not work on the Internet where readers expect expert, niche\ncontent.\u201d [23] Ethnic and minority papers are some of the most common forms of niche newspapers. In the\nUnited States\u2014particularly in large cities such as New York\u2014niche papers for numerous ethnic\ncommunities flourish. Some common types of U.S. niche papers are papers that cater to a specific ethnic\nor cultural group or to a group that speaks a particular language. Papers that cover issues affecting\nlesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals\u2014like the Advocate\u2014and religion-oriented publications\u2014\nlike The Christian Science Monitor\u2014are also niche papers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n165 The Underground Press\nSome niche papers are part of the underground press. Popularized in the 1960s and 1970s as individuals\nsought to publish articles documenting their perception of social tensions and inequalities, the\nunderground press typically caters to alternative and countercultural groups. Most of these papers are\npublished on small budgets. Perhaps the most famous underground paper is New York\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013\nwinning Village Voice. This newspaper was founded in 1955 and declares its role in the publishing\nindustry by saying:\nThe Village Voice introduced free-form, high-spirited and passionate journalism into the public discourse.\nAs the nation\u2019s first and largest alternative newsweekly, the Voice maintains the same tradition of no-\nholds-barred reporting and criticism it first embraced when it began publishing fifty years ago. [24]\nDespite their at-times shoestring budgets, underground papers serve an important role in the media. By\noffering an alternative perspective to stories and by reaching out to niche groups through their writing,\nunderground-press newspapers fill a unique need within the larger media marketplace. As journalism has\nevolved over the years, newspapers have adapted to serve the changing demands of readers.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Objective journalism began as a response to sensationalism and has continued in some form to this day.\nHowever, some media observers have argued that it is nearly impossible to remain entirely objective\nwhile reporting a story. One argument against objectivity is that journalists are human and are, therefore,\nbiased to some degree. Many newspapers that promote objectivity put in place systems to help their\njournalists remain as objective as possible.\n\uf0b7 Literary journalism combines the research and reporting of typical newspaper journalism with the writing\nstyle of fiction. While most newspaper journalists focus on facts, literary journalists tend to focus on the\nscene by evoking voices and characters inhabiting historical events. Famous early literary journalists\ninclude Tom Wolfe and Truman Capote.\n\uf0b7 Other journalistic styles allow reporters and publications to narrow their editorial voice. Advocacy\njournalists encourage readers to support a particular cause. Consensus journalism encourages social and\neconomic harmony, while conflict journalists present information in a way that focuses on views outside\nof the social norm.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n166 \uf0b7 Niche newspapers\u2014such as members of the underground press and those serving specific ethnic groups,\nracial groups, or speakers of a specific language\u2014serve as important media outlets for distinct voices. The\nrise of the Internet and online journalism has brought niche newspapers more into the mainstream.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Describe two ways that newspapers control stories.\n2. Define watchdog journalism.\n3. Describe how television has impacted journalistic styles.\nSince 1896, The New York Times has printed the phrase \u201cAll the News That\u2019s Fit to Print\u201d as its\nmasthead motto. The phrase itself seems innocent enough, and it has been published for such a long\ntime now that many probably skim over it without giving it a second thought. Yet, the phrase\nrepresents an interesting phenomenon in the newspaper industry: control. Papers have long been\ncriticized for the way stories are presented, yet newspapers continue to print\u2014and readers continue\nto buy them.\n\u201cAll the News That\u2019s Fit to Print\u201d\nIn 1997, The New York Times publicly claimed that it was \u201can independent newspaper, entirely fearless,\nfree of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare.\u201d [1] Despite this public\nproclamation of objectivity, the paper\u2019s publishers have been criticized for choosing which articles to print\nbased on personal financial gain. In reaction to that statement, scholar Edward S. Herman wrote that the\nissue is that The New York Times \u201cdefin[es] public welfare in a manner acceptable to their elite audience\nand advertisers.\u201d [2] The New York Times has continually been accused of determining what stories are\ntold. For example, during the 1993 debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), The\nNew York Times clearly supported the agreement. In doing so, the newspaper exercised editorial control\nover its publication and the information that went out to readers.\nHowever, The New York Times is not the only newspaper to face accusations of controlling which stories\nare told. In his review of Read All About It: The Corporate Takeover of America\u2019s Newspapers, Steve\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n169 Hoenisch, editor ofCriticism.com, offers these harsh words about what drives the stories printed in\ntoday\u2019s newspaper:\nI\u2019ve always thought of daily newspapers as the guardians of our\u2014meaning the public\u2019s\u2014right to know. The\nguardians of truth, justice, and public welfare and all that. But who am I fooling? America\u2019s daily\nnewspapers don\u2019t belong to us. Nor, for that matter, do they even seek to serve us any longer. They have\nmore important concerns now: appeasing advertisers and enriching stockholders. [3]\nMore and more, as readership declines, newspapers must answer to advertisers and shareholders as they\nchoose which stories to report on.\nHowever, editorial control does not end there. Journalists determine not only what stories are told but\nalso how those stories are presented. This issue is perhaps even more delicate than that of selection. Most\nnewspaper readers still expect news to be reported objectively and demand that journalists present their\nstories in this manner. However, careful public scrutiny can burden journalists, while accusations of\ncontrolling information affect their affiliated newspapers. However, this scrutiny takes on importance as\nthe public turns to journalists and newspapers to learn about the world.\nJournalists are also expected to hold themselves to high standards of truth and originality. Fabrication\nand plagiarism are prohibited. If a journalist is caught using these tactics, then his or her career is likely to\nend for betraying the public\u2019s trust and for damaging the publication\u2019s reputation. For example, The New\nYork Times reporter Jayson Blair lost his job in 2003 when his plagiary and fabrication were discovered,\nand The New Republic journalist Stephen Glass was fired in 1998 for inventing stories, quotes, and\nsources.\nDespite the critiques of the newspaper industry and its control over information, the majority of\nnewspapers and journalists take their roles seriously. Editors work with journalists to verify sources and\nto double-check facts so readers are provided accurate information. In this way, the control that\njournalists and newspapers exert serves to benefit their readers, who can then be assured that articles\nprinted are correct.\nThe New York Times Revisits Old Stories\nDespite the criticism of The New York Times, the famous newspaper has been known to revisit their old\nstories to provide a new, more balanced view. One such example occurred in 2004 when, in response to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n170 criticism on their handling of the Iraq War, The New York Times offered a statement of apology. The\napology read as follows:\nWe have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. In some\ncases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified\nor allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining\nthe claims as new evidence emerged\u2014or failed to emerge. [4]\nAlthough the apology was risky\u2014it essentially admitted guilt in controlling a controversial story\u2014The\nNew York Times demonstrated a commitment to ethical journalism.\nWatchdog Journalism\nOne way that journalists control stories for the benefit of the public is by engaging\nin watchdog journalism. This form of journalism provides the public with information about government\nofficials or business owners while holding those officials to high standards of operation. Watchdog\njournalism is defined as \u201c(1) independent scrutiny by the press of the activities of government, business\nand other public institutions, with an aim toward (2) documenting, questioning, and investigating those\nactivities, to (3) provide publics and officials with timely information on issues of public concern.\u201d [5]\nOne of the most famous examples of watchdog journalism is the role that Bob Woodward and Carl\nBernstein of The Washington Post played in uncovering information about the Watergate break-in and\nscandal that ultimately resulted in President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. Newspapers and journalists\noften laud watchdog journalism, one of the most important functions of newspapers, yet it is difficult to\npractice because it requires rigorous investigation, which in turn demands more time. Many journalists\noften try to keep up with news as it breaks, so journalists are not afforded the time to research the\ninformation\u2014nor to hone the skills\u2014required to write a watchdog story. \u201cSurviving in the newsroom\u2014\ndoing watchdog stories\u2014takes a great deal of personal and political skill. Reporters must have a sense of\nguerilla warfare tactics to do well in the newsroom.\u201d [6]\nTo be successful, watchdog journalists must investigate stories, ask tough questions, and face the\npossibility of unpopularity to alert the public to corruption or mismanagement while elevating the public\u2019s\nexpectations of the government. At the same time, readers can support newspapers that employ this style\nof journalism to encourage the press to engage in the challenging watchdog form of journalism. As\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n171 scholars have observed, \u201cnot surprisingly, watchdog journalism functions best when reporters understand\nit and news organizations and their audiences support it.\u201d [7]\nImpact of Television and the Internet on Print\nNewspapers have control over which stories are told and how those stories are presented. Just as the\nnewspaper industry has changed dramatically over the years, journalistic writing styles have been\ntransformed. Many times, such changes mirrored a trend shift in readership; since the 1950s, however,\nnewspapers have had to compete with television journalism and, more recently, the Internet. Both\ntelevision and the Internet have profoundly affected newspaper audiences and journalistic styles.\nCase Study: USA Today\nUSA Today, founded in 1982 and known for its easy-to-read stories, is but one example of a paper that\nhas altered its style to remain competitive with television and the Internet. In the past, newspapers placed\ntheir primary focus on the written word. Although some newspapers still maintain the use of written\nnarration, many papers have shifted their techniques to attract a more television-savvy audience. In the\ncase of USA Today, the emphasis lies on the second track\u2014the visual story\u2014dominated by large images\naccompanied by short written stories. This emphasis mimics the television presentation format, allowing\nthe paper to cater to readers with short attention spans.\nA perhaps unexpected shift in journalistic writing styles that derives from television is the more frequent\nuse of present tense, rather than past tense, in articles. This shift likely comes from television journalism\u2019s\ntendency to allow a story to develop as it is being told. This subtle but noticeable shift from past to present\ntense in narration sometimes brings a more dramatic element to news articles, which may attract readers\nwho otherwise turn to television news programs for information.\nLike many papers, USA Today has redesigned its image and style to keep up with the sharp immediacy of\nthe Internet and with the entertainment value of television. In fact, the paper\u2019s management was so\nserious about their desire to compete with television that from 1988 to 1990 they mounted a syndicated\ntelevision series titled USA Today: The Television Show (later retitled USA Today on TV). [8] Despite its\nshort run, the show demonstrated the paper\u2019s focus on reaching out to a visual audience, a core value that\nit has maintained to this day. Today, USA Today has established itself as a credible and reliable news\nsource, despite its unorthodox approach to journalism.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n172 \uf0b7 Newspapers control which stories are told by selecting which articles make it to print. They also control\nhow stories are told by determining the way in which information is presented to their readers.\n\uf0b7 Watchdog journalism is an investigative approach to reporting that aims to inform citizens of occurrences\nin government and businesses.\n\uf0b7 Television has not only contributed to the decline of readership for newspapers but has also impacted\nvisual and journalistic styles. Newspapers, such as USA Today, have been profoundly affected by the\ntelevision industry. USA Today caters to television watchers by incorporating large images and short\nstories, while primarily employing the present tense to make it seem as though the story is unfolding\nbefore the reader.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts. Each response should be a minimum of one paragraph.\n1. Compare the journalistic styles of USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. Examine differences in the\nvisual nature of the newspapers as well as in the journalistic style.\n2. How has television affected these particular newspapers?\n3. What noticeable differences do you observe? Can you find any similarities?\n4. How did each newspaper cover events differently? How did each newspaper\u2019s coverage change the\nfocus and information told? Did you find any watchdog stories, and, if so, what were they?\n[1] Edward S.

Identify newspapers with high circulations.\n2. Describe the decline of the newspaper industry.\nPopular media such as television and the Internet have forever changed the newspaper industry. To\nfully understand the impact that current technology is having on the newspaper industry, it is\nnecessary to first examine the current state of the industry.\nMajor Publications in the U.S. Newspaper Industry\nAlthough numerous papers exist in the United States, a few major publications dominate circulation and,\nthus, exert great influence on the newspaper industry. Each of these newspapers has its own unique\njournalistic and editorial style, relying on different topics and techniques to appeal to its readership.\nUSA Today\nUSA Today currently tops the popularity chart with a daily circulation of 2,281,831. [1] This national\npaper\u2019s easy-to-read content and visually focused layout contribute to its high readership numbers.\nAlthough the paper does not formally publish on weekends, it does have a partner paper titled USA\nWeekend.USA Today consists of four sections: news, money, sports, and life; for the ease of its readers,\nthe newspaper color-codes each section. Owned by the Gannett Company, the paper caters to its audience\nby opting for ease of comprehension over complexity.\nThe Wall Street Journal\nEstablished in the late 1800s, The Wall Street Journal closely trails USA Today, with a circulation of\n2,070,498. [2] In fact, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal have competed for the top circulation spot\nfor many years. An international paper that focuses on business and financial news, The Wall Street\nJournal primarily uses written narration with few images. Recent changes to its layout, such as adding\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n174 advertising on the front page and minimizing the size of the paper slightly to save on printing costs, have\nnot dramatically shifted this long-standing focus. The paper runs between 50 and 96 pages per issue and\ngives its readers up-to-date information on the economy, business, and national and international\nfinancial news.\nThe New York Times\nThe New York Times is another major publication, with circulation at 1,121,623.[3] Founded in 1851, the\nNew York City\u2013based paper is owned by the New York Times Company, which also publishes several\nsmaller regional papers. The flagship paper contains three sections: news, opinion, and features. Although\nits articles tend to be narrative-driven, the paper does include images for many of its articles, creating a\nbalance between the wordier layout of The Wall Street Journal and the highly visual USA Today. The\nNew York Times publishes international stories along with more local stories in sections such as Arts,\nTheater, and Metro. The paper has also successfully established itself on the Internet, becoming one of the\nmost popular online papers today.\nLos Angeles Times\nThe Los Angeles Times\u2014currently the only West Coast paper to crack the top 10 circulation list\u2014has also\ncontributed much to the newspaper industry. First published in 1881, the California-based paper has a\ndistribution of 907,977. [4]Perhaps the most unique feature of the paper is its Column One, which focuses\non sometimes-bizarre stories meant to engage readers. Known for its investigative journalistic approach,\nthe Los Angeles Times demands that its journalists \u201cprovide a rich, nuanced account\u201d of the issues they\ncover. [5] By 2010, the paper had won 39 Pulitzer Prizes, including 5 gold medals for public service. [6]\nThe Washington Post\nFirst published in 1877, The Washington Post is Washington, DC\u2019s oldest and largest paper, with a daily\ncirculation of 709,997. [7] According to its editors, the paper aims to be \u201cfair and free and wholesome in its\noutlook on public affairs and public men.\u201d [8] In this vein, The Washington Post has developed a strong\ninvestigative journalism style, perhaps most exemplified by its prominent investigation of the Watergate\nScandal.\nThe paper also holds the principle of printing articles fit \u201cfor the young as well as the old.\u201d [9] In 2003, The\nWashington Post launched a new section called the Sunday Source which targets the 18- to 34-year-old\nage group in an attempt to increase readership among younger audiences. This weekend supplement\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n175 section focused on entertainment and lifestyle issues, like style, food, and fashion. Although it ceased\npublication in 2008, some of its regular features migrated to the regular paper. Like the Los Angeles\nTimes, The Washington Post holds numerous Pulitzer Prizes for journalism.\nChicago Tribune\nOne other major publication with a significant impact on the newspaper industry is the Chicago Tribune,\nwielding a circulation of 643,086. [10] First established in 1847, the paper is often remembered for\nfamously miscalling the 1948 presidential election with the headline of \u201cDewey Defeats Truman.\u201d\nFigure 4.10\nThe Chicago Tribune\u2019s inaccurate declaration of the results of the tight 1948 presidential election has become one of\nthe most famous headlines of all time.\nDespite this error, the Chicago Tribune has become known for its watchdog journalism, including a\nspecific watchdog section for issues facing Chicago, like pollution, politics, and more. It proudly proclaims\nits commitment \u201cto standing up for your interests and serving as your watchdog in the corridors of\npower.\u201d [11]\nDeclining Readership and Decreasing Revenues\nDespite major newspapers\u2019 large circulations, newspapers as a whole are experiencing a dramatic decline\nin both subscribers and overall readership. For example, on February 27, 2009, Denver\u2019s Rocky Mountain\nNews published its final issue after nearly 150 years in print. The front-page article \u201cGoodbye, Colorado\u201d\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n176 reflected on the paper\u2019s long-standing history with the Denver community, observing that \u201cIt is with great\nsadness that we say goodbye to you today. Our time chronicling the life of Denver and Colorado, the\nnation and the world, is over.\u201d [12]\nReadership Decline\nThe story of Rocky Mountain News is neither unique nor entirely unexpected. For nearly a half-century,\npredictions of the disappearance of print newspapers have been an ongoing refrain. The fear of losing\nprint media began in the 1940s with the arrival of the radio and television. Indeed, the number of daily\npapers has steadily decreased since the 1940s; in 1990, the number of U.S. dailies was just 1,611. By 2008,\nthat number had further shrunk to 1,408. [13] But the numbers are not as clear-cut as they appear. As one\nreport observed, \u201cThe root problems go back to the late 1940s, when the percentage of Americans reading\nnewspapers began to drop. But for years the U.S. population was growing so much that circulation kept\nrising and then, after 1970s, remained stable.\u201d [14]During the 1970s when circulation stopped rising, more\nwomen were entering the workforce. By the 1990s when \u201ccirculation began to decline in absolute\nnumbers,\u201d the number of women in the workforce was higher than had ever been previously\nexperienced. [15] With women at work, there were fewer people at home with leisure time for reading daily\npapers for their news. This, combined with television journalism\u2019s rising popularity and the emergence of\nthe Internet, meant a significant decrease in newspaper circulation. With newer, more immediate ways to\nget news, the disconnect between newspapers and consumers deepened.\nCompounding the problem is newspapers\u2019 continuing struggle to attract younger readers. Many of these\nyoung readers simply did not grow up in households that subscribed to daily papers and so they do not\nturn to newspapers for information. However, the problem seems to be more complex \u201cthan fewer people\ndeveloping the newspaper habit. People who used to read every day now read less often. Some people who\nused to read a newspaper have stopped altogether.\u201d [16]\nYet the most significant challenge to newspapers is certainly the Internet. As print readership declines,\nonline readership has grown; fast, free access to breaking information contributes to the growing appeal\nof online news. Despite the increase in online news readers, that growth has not offset the drop in print\nreadership. In 2008, the Pew Research Center conducted a news media consumption survey in which only\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n177 39 percent of participants claimed to having read a newspaper (either print or online) the day before,\nshowing a drop from 43 percent in 2006. Meanwhile, readership of print newspapers fell from 34 percent\nto 25 percent in that time period. [17]\nThe study also observed that younger generations are primarily responsible for this shift to online\nreading. \u201cThe changes in reader habits seem to be similar amongst both Generation X and Y\ndemographics, where marked increases in consulting online news sources were observed.\u201d [18] Baby\nboomers and older generations do, for the most part, still rely on printed newspapers for information.\nPerhaps this distinction between generations is not surprising. Younger readers grew up with the Internet\nand have developed different expectations about the speed, nature, and cost of information than have\nolder generations. However, this trend suggests that online readership along with the general decline of\nnews readers may make printed newspapers all but obsolete in the near future.\nJoint Operating Agreements\nAs readership began to decline in the 1970s and newspapers began experiencing greater competition\nwithin individual cities, Congress issued the Newspaper Preservation Act authorizing the structure of\njoint operating agreements (JOAs). The implementation of JOAs means that two newspapers could \u201cshare\nthe cost of business, advertising, and circulation operations,\u201d which helped newspapers stay afloat in the\nface of an ever-shrinking readership. [19] The Newspaper Preservation Act also ensured that two competing\npapers could keep their distinct news divisions but merge their business divisions.\nAt its peak, 28 newspaper JOAs existed across the United States, but as the industry declines at an\nincreasingly rapid rate, JOAs are beginning to fail. With today\u2019s shrinking pool of readers, two\nnewspapers simply cannot effectively function in one community. In 2009, only nine JOAs continued\noperations, largely because JOAs \u201cdon\u2019t eliminate the basic problem of one newspaper gaining the upper\nhand in circulation and, hence, advertising revenue.\u201d [20] With advertising playing a key role in\nnewspapers\u2019 financial survival, revenue loss is a critical blow. Additionally, \u201cin recent years, of course, the\nInternet has thrown an even more dramatic wrench into the equation. Classified advertising has migrated\nto Internet sites like craigslist.org while traditional retail advertisers \u2026 can advertise via their own\nwebsites.\u201d [21] As more advertisers move away from the newspaper industry, more JOAs will likely\ncrumble. The destruction of JOAs will, in turn, result in the loss of more newspapers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n178 Newspaper Chains\nAs newspapers diminish in number and as newspaper owners find themselves in financial trouble, a\ndramatic increase in the consolidation of newspaper ownership has taken place. Today, many large\ncompanies own several papers across the country, buying independently owned papers to help them stay\nafloat. The change has been occurring for some time; in fact, \u201csince 1975, more than two-thirds of\nindependently owned newspapers \u2026 have disappeared.\u201d [22]However, since 2000, newspaper\nconsolidation has increased markedly as more papers are turning over control to larger companies.\nIn 2002, the 22 largest newspaper chains owned 39 percent of all the newspapers in the country (562\npapers). Yet those papers represent 70 percent of daily circulation and 73 percent of Sunday. And their\ninfluence appears to be growing. These circulation percentages are a full percentage point higher than\n2001. [23]\nAmong the 22 companies that own the largest percentage of the papers, four chains stand out: Gannett,\nthe Tribune Company, the New York Times Company, and the McClatchy Company. Not only do these\ncompanies each own several papers across the country, but they also enjoy a higher-than-normal profit\nmargin relative to smaller chains.\nRecent Ownership Trends\nIn addition to consolidation, the decline of print newspapers has brought about several changes in\nownership as companies attempt to increase their revenue. In 2007, media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s\nNews Corporation purchased The Wall Street Journal with an unsolicited $5 billion bid, promising to\n\u201cpour money into the Journal and its website and use his satellite television networks in Europe and Asia\nto spread Journal content the world over.\u201d [24] Murdoch has used the buyout to move the paper into the\ntechnological world, asking readers and newspapers to embrace change. In 2009, he published an article\nin The Wall Street Journal assuring his readers that \u201cthe future of journalism is more promising than\never\u2014limited only by editors and producers unwilling to fight for their readers and viewers, or\ngovernment using its heavy hand either to overregulate or subsidize us.\u201d [25] Murdoch believes that the\nhope of journalism lies in embracing the changing world and how its inhabitants receive news. Time will\ntell if he is correct.\nDespite changes in power, the consolidation trend is leveling off. Even large chains must cut costs to avoid\nshuttering papers entirely. In January 2009, the newspaper industry experienced 2,252 layoffs; in total,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n179 the U.S. newspaper industry lost 15,114 jobs that year. [26] With the dual challenges of layoffs and\ndecreasing readership, some in the journalism industry are beginning to explore other options for\nownership, such as nonprofit ownership. As one article in the Chronicle of Philanthropy puts it, \u201c[i]t may\nbe time for a more radical reinvention of the daily newspaper. The answer for some newspapers may be to\nadopt a nonprofit ownership structure that will enable them to seek philanthropic contributions and\nbenefit from tax exemptions.\u201d [27]\nIt is clear that the newspaper industry is on the brink of major change. Over the next several years, the\nindustry will likely continue to experience a complete upheaval brought on by dwindling readership and\nmajor shifts in how individuals consume news. As newspapers scramble to find their footing in an ever-\nchanging business, readers adapt and seek out trustworthy information in new ways.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Some key players in the U.S. newspaper market include the USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New\nYork Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and the Chicago Tribune.\n\uf0b7 Although readership has been declining since the invention of the radio, the Internet has had the most\nprofound effect on the newspaper industry as readers turn to free online sources of information.\n\uf0b7 Financial challenges have led to the rise of ever-growing newspaper chains and the creation of JOAs.\nNevertheless, newspapers continue to fold and lay off staff.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Describe two ways in which online reporting may outperform traditional print reporting.\n2. Explain the greatest challenges newspapers face as they transition to online journalism.\nThe proliferation of online communication has had a profound effect on the newspaper industry. As\nindividuals turn to the Internet to receive news for free, traditional newspapers struggle to remain\ncompetitive and hold onto their traditional readers. However, the Internet\u2019s appeal goes beyond free\ncontent. This section delves further into the Internet and its influence on the print industry. The\nInternet and its role in media are explored in greater detail in of this textbook.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n182 Competition From Blogs\nWeb logs, or blogs, have offered a new take on the traditional world of journalism. Blogs feature news and\ncommentary entries from one or more authors. However, journalists differ on whether the act of writing a\nblog, commonly known as blogging, is, in fact, a form of journalism.\nIndeed, many old-school reporters do not believe blogging ranks as formal journalism. Unlike journalists,\nbloggers are not required to support their work with credible sources. This means that stories published\non blogs are often neither verified nor verifiable. As Jay Rosen, New York University journalism professor,\nwrites, \u201cBloggers are speakers and writers of their own invention, at large in the public square.\nThey\u2019re participating in the great game of influence called public opinion.\u201d [1] Despite the blurry lines of\nwhat constitutes \u201ctrue\u201d journalism\u2014and despite the fact that bloggers are not held to the same standards\nas journalists\u2014many people still seek out blogs to learn about news. Thus, blogs have affected the news\njournalism industry. According to longtime print journalist and blogger Gina Chen, \u201cblogging has changed\njournalism, but it is not journalism.\u201d [2]\nAdvantages Over Print Media\nBeyond the lack of accountability in blogging, blogs are free from the constraints of journalism in other\nways that make them increasingly competitive with traditional print publications. Significantly, Internet\npublication allows writers to break news as soon as it occurs. Unlike a paper that publishes only once a\nday, the Internet is constantly accessible, and information is ready at the click of a mouse.\nIn 1998, the Internet flexed its rising journalistic muscle by breaking a story before any major print\npublication: the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal. The Drudge Report, an online news website that\nprimarily consists of links to stories, first made the story public, claiming to have learned of the scandal\nonly after Newsweek magazine failed to publish it. On January 18, 1998, the story broke online with the\ntitle \u201cNewsweek Kills Story on White House Intern. Blockbuster Report: 23-year-old, Former White\nHouse Intern, Sex Relationship with President.\u201d The report gave some details on the scandal, concluding\nthe article with the phrase \u201cThe White House was busy checking the Drudge Report for details.\u201d [3] This\nact revealed the power of the Internet because of its superiority in timeliness, threatening the relevancy of\nslower newspapers and news magazines.\nPrint media also continuously struggle with space constraints, another limit that the Internet is spared. As\nnewspapers contemplate making the transition from print to online editions, several editors see the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n183 positive effect of this particular issue. N. Ram, editor-in-chief of The Hindu, claims, \u201cOne clear benefit\nonline editions can provide is the scope this gives for accommodating more and longer articles\u2026. There\nneed be no space constraints, as in the print edition.\u201d [4] With the endless writing space of the Internet,\nonline writers have the freedom to explore topics more fully, to provide more detail, and to print\ninterviews or other texts in their entirety\u2014opportunities that many print journalists have longed for since\nnewspapers first began publishing.\nOnline writing also provides a forum for amateurs to enter the professional realm of writing. With cost-\ncutting forcing newspapers to lay off writers, more and more would-be journalists are turning to the\nInternet to find ways to enter the field. Interestingly, the blogosphere has launched the careers of\njournalists who otherwise may never have pursued a career in journalism. For example, blogger Molly\nWizenberg founded the blog Orangette because she didn\u2019t know what to do with herself: \u201cThe only thing I\nknew was that, whatever I did, it had to involve food and writing.\u201d [5] After Orangette became a successful\nfood blog, Wizenberg transitioned into writing for a traditional media outlet: food magazine Bon Appetit.\nOnline Newspapers\nWith declining readership and increasing competition from blogs, most newspapers have embraced the\nculture shift and have moved to online journalism. For many papers, this has meant creating an online\nversion of their printed paper that readers will have access to from any location, at all times of the day. By\n2010, over 10,000 newspapers had gone online. But some smaller papers\u2014particularly those in two-paper\ncommunities\u2014have not only started websites but have also ceased publication of their printed papers\nentirely.\nOne such example is Seattle\u2019s Post-Intelligencer. In 2009, the newspaper stopped printing, \u201cleaving the\nrival Seattle Times as the only big daily in town.\u201d[6] As Steve Swartz, president of Hearst Newspapers and\nowner of the Post-Intelligencer, commented about the move to online-only printing, \u201cBeing the second\nnewspaper in Seattle didn\u2019t work. We are very enthusiastic, however, about this experiment to create a\ndigital-only business in Seattle with a robust community website at its core.\u201d [7] For the Post-Intelligencer,\nthe move meant a dramatic decrease in its number of staff journalists. The printed version of the paper\nemployed 135 journalists, but the online version, Seattlepi.com, employs only 2 dozen. For Seattlepi.com,\nthis shift has been doubly unusual because the online-only newspaper is not really like a traditional\nnewspaper at all. As Swartz articulated, \u201cVery few people come to our website and try to re-create the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n184 experience of reading a newspaper\u2014in other words, spending a half-hour to 45 minutes and really reading\nmost of the articles. We don\u2019t find people do that on the Web.\u201d [8] The online newspaper is, in reality, still\ntrying to figure out what it is. Indeed, this is an uncomfortable position familiar to many online-only\npapers: trapped between the printed news world and the online world of blogs and unofficial websites.\nDuring this transitional time for newspapers, many professional journalists are taking the opportunity to\nenter the blogosphere, the realm of bloggers on the Internet. Journalist bloggers, also known\nas beatbloggers, have begun to utilize blogs as \u201ctool[s] to engage their readers, interact with them, use\nthem as sources, crowdsource their ideas and invite them to contribute to the reporting process,\u201d says\nbeatblogger Alana Taylor. [9] As beatblogging grows, online newspapers are harnessing the popularity of\nthis new phenomenon and taking advantage of the resources provided by the vast Internet audience\nthrough crowdsourcing (outsourcing problem solving to a large group of people, usually volunteers).\nBlogs are becoming an increasingly prominent feature on news websites, and nearly every major\nnewspaper website displays a link to the paper\u2019s official blogs on its homepage. This subtle addition to the\nweb pages reflects the print industry\u2019s desire to remain relevant in an increasingly online world.\nEven as print newspapers are making the transformation to the digital world with greater or less success,\nInternet news sites that were never print papers have begun to make waves. Sites such as The Huffington\nPost, The Daily Beast, and the Drudge Report are growing in popularity. For example, The Huffington\nPost displays the phrase \u201cThe Internet Newspaper: News, Blogs, Video, Community\u201d as its masthead,\nreiterating its role and focus in today\u2019s media-savvy world. [10] In 2008, former Vanity Fair editor Tina\nBrown cofounded and began serving as editor-in-chief of The Daily Beast. On The Daily Beast\u2019s website,\nBrown has noted its success: \u201cI revel in the immediacy, the responsiveness, the real-time-ness. I used to\nbe the impatient type. Now I\u2019m the serene type. Because how can you be impatient when everything\nhappens right now, instantly?\u201d [11]\nSome newspapers are also making even more dramatic transformations to keep up with the changing\nonline world. In 2006, large newspaper conglomerate GateHouse Media began publishing under a\nCreative Commons license, giving noncommercial users access to content according to the license\u2019s\nspecifications. The company made the change to draw in additional online viewers and, eventually,\nrevenue for the newspapers. Writer at the Center for Citizen Media, Lisa Williams, explains in her article\npublished by PressThink.org:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n185 GateHouse\u2019s decision to CC license its content may be a response to the cut-and-paste world of weblogs,\nwhich frequently quote and point to newspaper stories. Making it easier\u2014and legal\u2014for bloggers to quote\nstories at length means that bloggers are pointing their audience at that newspaper. Getting a boost in\ntraffic from weblogs may have an impact on online advertising revenue, and links from weblogs also have\nan impact on how high a site\u2019s pages appear in search results from search engines such as Google. Higher\ntraffic, and higher search engine rankings build a site\u2019s ability to make money on online ads. [12]\nGateHouse Media\u2019s decision to alter its newspapers\u2019 licensing agreement to boost advertising online\nreflects the biggest challenge facing the modern online newspaper industry: profit. Despite shrinking\nprint-newspaper readership and rising online readership, print revenue remains much greater than digital\nrevenue because the online industry is still determining how to make online newspapers profitable. One\narticle notes the following:\nThe positive news is that good newspapers like The New York Times, The Guardian, The Financial Times,\nand The Wall Street Journal now provide better, richer, and more diverse content in their Internet\neditions\u2026. The bad news is that the print media are yet to find a viable, let alone profitable, revenue\nmodel for their Internet journalism. [13]\nThe issue is not only that information on the Internet is free but also that advertising is far less expensive\nonline. As National Public Radio (NPR) reports, \u201cThe online-only plan for newspapers remains an\nunproven financial model; there are great savings by scrapping printing and delivery costs, but even\ngreater lost revenues, since advertisers pay far more money for print ads than online ads.\u201d [14]\nFigure 4.11\nSources of Newspaper Revenue\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n186 Despite these challenges, newspapers both in print and online continue to seek new ways to provide the\npublic with accurate, timely information. Newspapers have long been adapting to cultural paradigm\nshifts, and in the face of losing print newspapers altogether, the newspaper industry continues to reinvent\nitself to keep up with the digital world.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Print newspapers face increasing challenges from online media, particularly amateur blogs and\nprofessional online news operations.\n\uf0b7 Internet reporting outperforms traditional print journalism both with its ability to break news as it\nhappens and through its lack of space limitations. Still, nonprofessional Internet news is not subject to\nchecks for credibility, so some readers and journalists remain skeptical.\n\uf0b7 As newspapers move to online journalism, they must determine how to make that model profitable. Most\nonline newspapers do not require subscriptions, and advertising is significantly less expensive online than\nit is in print.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

The decision came as a shock to many readers who, since 1941, had\nbelieved that \u201cGourmet was to food what Vogue is to fashion, a magazine with a rich history and a perch\nhigh in the publishing firmament.\u201d [1] Although Cond\u00e9 Nast folded three other publications\u2014parenting\nmagazine Cookie and bridal magazines Elegant Bride and Modern Bride\u2014the elimination\nof Gourmet received the most attention because of the publication\u2019s long history and popularity. Although\nsome readers were angry about the sudden print halt, some understood that the closure was simply a\nreflection of a changing market.\nMagazine publishers have been struggling with competition for advertising dollars for years. The\nmagazine industry took a dramatic hit from the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2007, with many\npublications folding altogether, several moving to online-only models, and nearly all implementing mass\nlayoffs to cut costs. [2] The crisis forced the high-end retailers that support Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines to slash\ntheir advertising budgets, and the subsequent decline in advertising revenue put the Cond\u00e9 Nast\npublications in jeopardy. [3]\nAlthough this appears to be grim news for an industry that has survived since the 17th century, magazines\nmay not be truly obsolete. Many analysts are hopeful that the magazine industry, with its long, complex\npast, is simply in a slump. According to the Magazine Publishers of America, some 7,383 magazines\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n191 appeared in publication in 2008. [4] The following year, media private-equity firm Veronis Suhler\nStevenson predicted that magazine ad revenues would stabilize in 2013. [5] Former Newsweek financial\nwriter Daniel Gross\u2014though admittedly biased\u2014believes that the industry will strengthen. He describes\nthe panic of some who refer to the demise of print media as symptoms of an \u201cirrational depression\nsurrounding print.\u201d [6] Yet even he admits that he may be mistaken in his belief that the current downward\ntrend is just a bump in the road. As Gross stated, \u201c[i]f I\u2019m wrong, I may have to eat my words. And I\u2019ll be\ndoubly sad because I won\u2019t have Gourmet to tell me what wine goes best with them.\u201d [7]So, many have\nbegun to wonder, what will the future of the magazine business hold?\nIf Gourmet\u2019s closure is any indication, the magazines of the future will be a product of cross-media\nintegration, particularly between print and television. \u201cAdvertising support for luxurious magazines\nlike Gourmet has dwindled, while grocery store advertisers have continued to buy pages at more\naccessible, celebrity-driven magazines like Every Day with Rachel Ray, which specializes in 30-minute\nmeals, and Food Network Magazine.\u201d [8] This trend suggests that the best\u2014and perhaps only\u2014way for\nmagazines to remain viable is to gain an audience via another medium and then use that celebrity-driven\nstatus to sell the print product.\nThe magazine industry may change drastically over the next several years. This evolution may be affected\nby a number of variables, such as the Internet, a new generation of readers, the fluctuation of advertising\ncosts, and the recovery from the 2008 recession. What remains to be seen is whether the magazine\nindustry can continue to be a dominant force in American culture in the midst of these changes.\n[1] Stephanie Clifford, \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast Closes Gourmet and 3 Other Magazines,\u201d New York Times, October 6, 2009,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html.\n[2] Vocus Research, State of the Media Report 2011: Adapting, Surviving, and Reviving,\nhttp://www.vocus.com/resources/state-of-media/2011-report-adapting-surviving-reviving.pdf.\n[3] Daniel Gross, \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Eat My Words,\u201d Newsweek, October 7, 2009,\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html.\n[4] Association of Magazine Media, \u201cClearing up Misperceptions about Magazine Closings,\u201d white paper, August\n2009, http://www.magazine.org/ASSETS/ACC5AFCF184843B9B8A4CE13080DB232/misperceptions-about-\nmagazine-closings-082009.pdf.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n192 [5] Stephanie Clifford, \u201cA Look Ahead at the Money in the Communications Industry,\u201d New York Times, August 3,\n2009, http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/media/04adco.html.\n[6] Daniel Gross, \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Eat My Words,\u201d Newsweek, October 7, 2009,\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html.\n[7] Daniel Gross, \u201cDon\u2019t Make Me Eat My Words,\u201d Newsweek, October 7, 2009,\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html.\n[8] Stephanie Clifford, \u201cCond\u00e9 Nast Closes Gourmet and 3 Other Magazines,\u201d New York Times, October 6, 2009,\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html.\n5.1\nHistory of Magazine Publishing\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describe the European roots of the modern magazine.\n2. Identify the changes that took place in magazine printing in the 1830s United States.\n3. Describe the trends in journalism that arose during the 20th century.\nLike the newspaper, the magazine has a complex history shaped by the cultures in which it\ndeveloped. Examining the industry\u2019s roots and its transformation over time can contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the modern industry.\nEarly Magazines\nAfter the printing press became prevalent in Europe, early publishers began to conceptualize the\nmagazine. Forerunners of the familiar modern magazine first appeared during the 17th century in the\nform of brochures, pamphlets, and almanacs. Soon, publishers realized that irregular publication\nschedules required too much time and energy. A gradual shift then occurred as publishers sought regular\nreaders with specific interests. But the early magazine was unlike any other previous publication. It was\nnot enough of a news source to be a newspaper, but it could not be considered pleasure reading either.\nInstead, early magazines occupied the middle ground between the two. [1]\nGermany, France, and the Netherlands Lead the Way\nGerman theologian and poet Johann Rist published the first true magazine between 1663 and 1668.\nTitled Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen, or Edifying Monthly Discussions, Rist\u2019s publication inspired\na number of others to begin printing literary journals across Europe: Denis de Sallo\u2019s French Journal des\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n193 S\u00e7avans (1665), the Royal Society\u2019s English Philosophical Transactions (1665), and Francesco Nazzari\u2019s\nItalian Giomale de\u2019letterati (1668). In 1684, exiled Frenchman Pierre Bayle published Novelles de la\nR\u00e9publique des Lettres in the Netherlands to escape French censorship. Profoundly affected by a general\nrevival of learning during the 1600s, the publications inspired enthusiasm for education.\nAnother Frenchman, Jean Donneau de Viz\u00e9, published the first \u201cperiodical of amusement,\u201d Le Mercure\nGalant (later renamed Mercure de France), in 1672, which contained news, short stories, and poetry. This\ncombination of news and pleasurable reading became incredibly popular, causing other publications to\nimitate the magazine. [2] This lighter magazine catered to a different reader than did the other, more\nintellectual publications of the day, offering articles for entertainment and enjoyment rather than for\neducation.\nWith the arrival of the 18th century came an increase in literacy. Women, who enjoyed a considerable rise\nin literacy rates, began reading in record numbers. This growth affected the literary world as a whole,\ninspiring a large number of female writers to publish novels for female readers. [3] This influx of female\nreaders also helped magazines flourish as more women sought out the publications as a source of\nknowledge and entertainment. In fact, many magazines jumped at the chance to reach out to women.\nThe Athenian Mercury, the first magazine written specifically for women, appeared in 1693.\nBritish Magazines Appear\nMuch as in newspaper publication, Great Britain closely followed Continental Europe\u2019s lead in producing\nmagazines. During the early 18th century, three major influential magazines published regularly in Great\nBritain: Robinson Crusoe author Daniel Defoe\u2019s the Review, Sir Richard Steele\u2019s the Tatler, and Joseph\nAddison and Steele\u2019s the Spectator.\nFigure 5.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n194 Great Britain\u2019s first magazines emerged during the early 18th century, shortly after publishers had popularized the\nformat in Europe.\nAll three of these publications were published either daily or several times a week. While they were\nsupplied as frequently as newspapers, their content was closer to that of magazines. The Review focused\nprimarily on domestic and foreign affairs and featured opinion-based political articles. The\nSpectator replaced the Tatler, which published from 1709 to 1711. Both Tatler and Spectator emphasized\nliving and culture and frequently used humor to promote virtuous behavior. [4] Tatler and Spectator, in\nparticular, drew a large number of female readers, and both magazines eventually added female-targeted\npublications: Female Tatler in 1709 and Female Spectator in 1744.\nAmerican Magazines\nThe first American magazines debuted in 1741, when Andrew Bradford\u2019s American Magazine and\nBenjamin Franklin\u2019s General Magazine began publication in Philadelphia a mere 3 days apart from each\nother. Neither magazine lasted long, however; American Magazine folded after only 3 months\nand General Magazine after 6. The short-lived nature of the publications likely had less to do with the\noutlets themselves and more to do with the fact that they were \u201climited by too few readers with leisure\ntime to read, high costs of publishing, and expensive distribution systems.\u201d [5] Regardless of this early\nsetback, magazines began to flourish during the latter half of the 18th century, and by the end of the\n1700s, more than 100 magazines had appeared in the nascent United States. Despite this large publication\nfigure, typical colonial magazines still recorded low circulation figures and were considered highbrow.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n195 Mass-Appeal Magazines\nAll this changed during the 1830s when publishers began taking advantage of a general decline in the cost\nof printing and mailing publications and started producing less-expensive magazines with a wider\naudience in mind. Magazine style also transformed. While early magazines focused on improvement and\nreason, later versions focused on amusement. No longer were magazines focused on the elite class.\nPublishers took advantage of their freshly expanded audience and began offering family magazines,\nchildren\u2019s magazines, and women\u2019s magazines. Women\u2019s publications again proved to be a highly\nlucrative market. One of the earliest American women\u2019s magazines was Godey\u2019s Lady\u2019s Book, a\nPhiladelphia-based monthly that printed between 1830 and 1898. This particular magazine reached out to\nfemale readers by employing nearly 150 women.\nThe Saturday Evening Post\nThe first truly successful mass circulation magazine in the United States was The Saturday Evening Post.\nThis weekly magazine first began printing in 1821 and remained in regular print production until 1969,\nwhen it briefly ceased circulation. However, in 1971 a new owner remodeled the magazine to focus on\nhealth and medical breakthroughs. From the time of its first publication in the early 1800s, The Saturday\nEvening Post quickly grew in popularity; by 1855, it had a circulation of 90,000 copies per year. [6] Widely\nrecognized for transforming the look of the magazine, the publication was the first to put artwork on its\ncover, a decision that The Saturday Evening Post has said \u201cconnected readers intimately with the\nmagazine as a whole.\u201d [7] Certainly, The Saturday Evening Post took advantage of the format by featuring\nthe work of famous artists such as Norman Rockwell. Using such recognizable artists boosted circulation\nas \u201cAmericans everywhere recognized the art of the Post and eagerly awaited the next issue because of\nit.\u201d [8]\nFigure 5.3\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n196 The Saturday Evening Post popularized the use of artwork of its cover, setting a standard for other publications to follow.\nBut The Saturday Evening Post did not only feature famous artists; it also published works by famous\nauthors including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, and Ring Lardner. The popularity of these writers\ncontributed to the continuing success of the magazine.\nYouth\u2019s Companion\nAnother early U.S. mass magazine was Youth\u2019s Companion, which published between 1827 and 1929\nwhen it merged with The American Boy. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, this periodical featured fairly\nreligious content and developed a reputation as a wholesome magazine that encouraged young readers to\nbe virtuous and pious. Eventually, the magazine sought to reach a larger, adult audience by including\ntame entertainment pieces. Nevertheless, the magazine in time began featuring the work of prominent\nwriters for both children and adults and became \u201ca literary force to be reckoned with.\u201d [9]\nPrice Decreases Attract Larger Audiences\nWhile magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post and Youth\u2019s Companionwere fairly popular, the\nindustry still struggled to achieve widespread circulation. Most publications cost the then-hefty sum of 25\nor 35 cents per issue, limiting readership to the relative few who could afford them. This all changed in\n1893 when Samuel Sidney McClure began selling McClure\u2019s Magazine, originally a literary and political\nmagazine, at the bargain price of only 15 cents per issue. The trend caught on.\nSoon, Cosmopolitan (founded 1886) began selling for 12.5 cents, while Munsey Magazine (1886\u20131929)\nsold for only 10 cents. All three of these periodicals were widely successful. Frank A. Munsey, owner\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n197 of Munsey Magazine, estimated that between 1893 and 1899 \u201cthe ten-cent magazine increased the\nmagazine-buying public from 250,000 to 750,000 persons.\u201d [10] For the first time, magazines could be sold\nfor less than they cost to produce. Because of greater circulation, publications could charge more for\nadvertising space and decrease the cost to the customer.\nBy 1900, advertising had become a crucial component of the magazine business. In the early days of the\nindustry, many publications attempted to keep advertisements out of their issues because of publishers\u2019\nnatural fondness toward literature and writing. [11] However, once circulation increased, advertisers\nsought out space in magazines to reach the larger audience. Magazines responded by raising advertising\nrates, ultimately increasing their profitability. By the turn of the 20th century, advertising became the\nnorm in magazines, particularly in some women\u2019s magazine, where advertisements accounted for nearly\nhalf of all content.\nEarly 20th-Century Developments\nThe arrival of the 20th century brought with it new types of magazines, including news, business, and\npicture magazines. In time, these types of publications came to dominate the industry and attract vast\nreaderships.\nNewsmagazines\nAs publishers became interested in succinctly presenting the fresh increase of worldwide information that\ntechnology made available during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they designed the newsmagazine.\nIn 1923, Time became the first newsmagazine that focused on world news. Time first began publication\nwith the proposition that \u201cpeople are uninformed because no publication has adapted itself to the time\nwhich busy men are able to spend simply keeping informed.\u201d [12] Although the periodical struggled during\nits early years, Time hit its stride in 1928 and its readership grew. The magazine\u2019s signature style of well-\nresearched news presented in a succinct manner contributed greatly to its eventual success.\nSeveral other newsmagazines came onto the market during this era as well. Business Week was founded in\n1929 with a focus on the global market. Forbes, currently one of the most popular financial magazines,\nbegan printing in 1917 as a biweekly publication. In 1933, a former Time foreign editor founded\nNewsweek, which now has a circulation of nearly 4 million readers. Today, Newsweek and Time continue\nto compete with each other, furthering a trend that began in the early years of Newsweek.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n198 Picture Magazines\nPhotojournalism, or the telling of stories through photography, also became popular during the early 20th\ncentury. Although magazines had been running illustrations since the 19th century, as photography grew\nin popularity so did picture magazines. The most influential picture magazine was Henry Luce\u2019s Life,\nwhich regularly published between 1936 and 1972. Within weeks of its initial publication, Life had a\ncirculation of 1 million. In Luce\u2019s words, the publication aimed \u201cto see life; to see the world; to witness\ngreat events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things.\u201d [13] It did\nnot disappoint. Widely credited with establishing photojournalism, Life captured the attention of many on\nfirst read. With 96 large-format glossy pages, even the inaugural issue sold out. The opening photograph\ndepicted an obstetrician holding a newborn baby with the caption \u201cLife begins\u201d.\nWhile Life was the most influential picture magazine, it was certainly not the only photo-centric\npublication. Popular biweekly picture magazine Look printed between 1937 and 1971, claiming to compete\nwith Life by reaching out to a larger audience. Although Look offered Life stiff competition during their\nalmost identical print runs, the latter magazine is widely considered to have a greater legacy. Several other\nphoto magazines\u2014including Focus, Peek, Foto, Pic, and Click\u2014also took their inspiration from Life.\nInto the 21st Century\nDuring the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the advent of online technology began to greatly affect both\nthe magazine industry and the print media as a whole. Much like newspaper publishers, magazine\npublishers have had to rethink their structure to reach out to an increasingly online market. The specifics\nof the changes made to the magazine industry will be discussed in further detail later in this chapter.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The first magazine was published in Germany during the 17th century. The success of this publication led\nto the introduction of magazines across Europe. During the 17th and 18th centuries, publishers founded\nseveral different types of periodicals aimed at diverse audiences, including the elite and women.\n\uf0b7 The 1830s triggered the arrival of mass circulation magazines in the United States. Magazines began\noffering less expensive magazines to a wider audience, promoting greater consumption of the print\nmedia.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n199 \uf0b7 The introduction of newsmagazines and picture magazines dramatically changed the U.S. magazine\nindustry during the early 20th century. Today, newsmagazines such as Time and Newsweek continue to\ndominate the magazine industry.\nEXERCISES\nSelect a magazine that you enjoy reading and research its history.

Identify the change in regional and widespread advertising that occurred in the early 1900s.\n2. Describe the backlash against pulp magazines in the 1930s.\nAlthough magazines\u2019 great contributions to the development of culture and popular trends are today\nwidely acknowledged, the industry has not always been influential. Because of the significant costs\nassociated with printing and mailing publications, magazines originally reached out only to regional\naudiences. Not until these expenses declined and advertising revenues increased were magazines\nable to justify the cost of mass circulation.\nAdvertising for a National Market\nThe late 19th century brought with it an increase in mass circulation for the U.S. magazine industry. This\nmeant that magazines that had once targeted only a small part of the country suddenly began reaching a\nnationwide audience. In addition to the obvious benefit of increased magazine revenue, this shift to broad\ncirculation caused an interesting phenomenon: the introduction of national trends. For the first time in\nU.S. history, mass circulation allowed news, stories, consumer goods, and fashions to be diffused and\nadvertised to widespread, rather than regional, audiences. Mass circulation of magazines united the\ncountry as geographically diverse consumers read the same stories and saw the same advertisements.\nDue to this growth in readership, advertisements became increasingly vital to the magazine industry.\nAdvertisers sought to reach a large audience, and magazines willingly afforded them that opportunity,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n201 selling advertising space at higher rates. One business manager of Scribner\u2019s Monthly, an early popular\nmagazine, solicited advertisements by discussing the readership boom:\nThe publishers of Scribner\u2019s Monthly will insert in each number of the magazine certain pages devoted to\nadvertisements of a character likely to interest magazine readers. These will not increase the postage,\nwhile they will add materially to the ability of the publishers to render their magazines readable and\nattractive. The press of advertisements upon our first number shows how quickly the claims of the new\nmonthly upon the business public are recognized. Our edition will be very large, and it will have a national\ncirculation. It is now well understood that a first-class popular magazine furnishes to all men who seek a\nnational market the very best medium for advertising that exists. [1]\nThat national market was an entirely new one for publishers and advertisers. By the 1930s, market\nresearch had become the norm for periodicals as magazines\u2014and advertisers\u2014worked to better\nunderstand what readers wanted in their publications. However, market research has its limits; many\npublishers instead embraced the potential of magazines to simply tell people what they want or need, thus\nsolidifying the role of the magazine as a driver of popular culture. As one editor of Vogue articulated, \u201cIf\nwe find out what people want, it\u2019s already too late.\u201d [2]\nPopular Literature in Magazines\nMagazines offered a place not only for advertisers but also for authors and poets to reach a large audience.\nSeveral publications regularly hired both new and established authors to write stories. As circulation\nincreased, so did the desire for these authors to publish their work.\nLiterary magazines enjoyed a boom during the 19th century, publishing some of the period\u2019s most\nimportant fiction. At one point or another, nearly every important American writer contributed to literary\nmagazines; for example, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, and Ernest Hemingway all\npublished in periodicals throughout their careers. Even writers working outside the country such as Ezra\nPound and James Joyce sought out U.S. magazines to publish works that had been banned elsewhere.\nJust as magazines offered authors a chance to display their writing to a large audience, they also allowed\nreaders a taste of available literature. Even today, magazines print portions of books, which give readers a\npreview of the complete text. Portions of literary classics including Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, Walden, Moby-\nDick, Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn, and Ulysses all made their debuts in magazines. Some novels\u2014\nsuch as Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019s Tarzan of the Apes, John Hersey\u2019s Hiroshima, and Ernest\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n202 Hemingway\u2019s The Old Man and the Sea\u2014even appeared in magazines in full before being published in\nbook form. The opportunity to publish in magazines has been invaluable for authors, but literary\npublications have also proved essential for the development of American culture. In publishing literary\ntexts, journals have promoted now-classic stories, like the previously mentioned examples, that have\ndefined American literary history and have shaped the U.S. story.\nPulp Magazines\nDuring the late 1800s, a new type of magazine was established: the pulp magazine, an all-fiction\npublication named for its rough wood-pulp paper. At the time, dime novels did not qualify for the same\ninexpensive postal rates that magazines did\u2014but the pulps did. Suddenly, individuals had the opportunity\nto read popular genre fiction in these cheap magazines, like Adventure, Horror Stories, Startling Stories,\nand Weird Tales.\nCommonly acknowledged to be the invention of Frank Munsey, the pulps got their start as adventure\nmagazines, but they eventually diverged into several categories such as love, detective, and western. The\nfiction stories did remarkably well until the mid-1930s, when newspaper comics first offered competition\nby printing collections on the same pulp paper. In 1937, however, the two genres collided with Detective\nComics (where Batman made his first appearance), and the industry experienced a major boom. Although\nintended for children, the violent, horror-soaked comics drew a large adult audience. However, the\ngraphic content of the pulp strips caused a stir, with the public divided on the nature of this new media.\nDefenders of the comics called them harmless, while critics thought they would provoke people to mimic\nthe violent subject matter. [3] Just as legislators struggle today with debates over censorship of television,\nmusic, and the Internet, they did so with pulp comics as well. Negative backlash against pulp comics was\nencouraged through several articles published by child psychologist Fredric Wertham, who alleged that\ncomics were leading children into lives of crime. [4] In response to the controversy, an industry group\nknown as the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers established a Publishers Code in 1948 with the\naim of regulating the content of pulp comics. The Publishers Code was not well enforced, however; many\npublishers choose to ignore the code, and thus the controversy continued to rage. When Senate hearings\nraised the threat of government regulation in 1954, the pulp comics industry opted for self-censorship,\nand as a result the much stricter Comics Code Authority was established to control what material reached\nconsumers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n203 In spite of the controversy surrounding the magazines, the industry flourished, and eventually new forms\nof pulp magazines emerged. Amazing Stories offered science fiction, and hand-drawn pinups filled so-\ncalled Girlie Pulps, which found an audience despite experiencing a setback in 1934 when police seized\n10,000 copies and burned them. Even though both new genres attracted outcry from the public for their\nindecency, the pulps continued to grow in popularity. Many have argued that the difficulties of the Great\nDepression and the uncertainty of a looming world war made 1930s audiences ripe for the entertainment\noffered by fictional heroes, giving the pulp genre a ready audience.\nEntertainment Magazines\nThe success of the pulps encouraged another major transformation in mainstream journalism: the rise of\nentertaining fan magazines. Typically focused on television, film, and music, fan magazines emerged as\nnational entertainment during the early 20th century. During the early years of motion pictures,\nmagazines such as Photoplay, Picture Play, Movie Mirror, and Movieland began publication, offering\nsubscribers behind-the-scenes glimpses of well-known films. These periodicals were so successful that, as\nradio and television became popular, similar magazines came into existence to cover these new media.\nTelevision- and radio-focused magazines also provided weekly timetables of programs for their viewers\nand listeners. Although the emphasis of the fan magazine has changed over the years, even today much of\nthe magazine industry is dominated by entertainment publications, like Entertainment Weekly, Rolling\nStone, and TV Guide. In addition to providing entertainment news to readers, these publications are also\nuseful to celebrities and media producers as a platform to market their new products.\nTeen Magazines\nDuring the 1940s, many publishers began pursuing teenagers, a previously ignored\ndemographic. Seventeen magazine hit shelves in 1944, setting the stage for later publications such\nas Tiger Beat and Teen People. These magazines targeted young women, offering stories on fashion,\nmakeup, celebrity news, and lifestyles. Since their beginnings, teen magazines have kept their articles\nrelatively brief, instead reaching their target audiences with bright and bold photos. Tiger Beat, for\nexample, is known for its collaged covers featuring a popular teen celebrity of the moment. Teen\nmagazines influence popular culture not only through their reporting on celebrities, but also through their\narticles on celebrity fashion, which readers use to adopt fashion trends worn by celebrities. Like\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n204 entertainment magazines, teen magazines are also useful marketing tools for celebrities and other media\nproducers.\nDuring their early years, most teen magazines sought out readers in their late teens, even offering articles\non colleges. Today, however, to reach a wider audience, these same magazines intentionally target the\npreteen market by featuring younger actors and including more teenage celebrity gossip. In doing so, the\nmagazine industry continues to influence younger and younger audiences, thus making a greater impact\non American popular culture.\nFigure 5.5\nFirst popularized during the 1940s, teen magazines today target both tween and teenage\naudiences, bringing popular culture to the young.\nDo Magazine Images Negatively Influence Teenage Girls?\nIn 2006, the Madrid fashion show made headlines by banning overly thin models to project an image of\nbeauty and health. According to fashion show organizers, \u201cmodels had to be within a healthy weight\nrange. That means a 5-foot-9 woman would need to be at least 125 pounds.\u201d [5] The debate over thin\nmodels has been around since the 1960s when model Twiggy entered the field. Since then, extremely thin\nmodels have ruled the runway despite claims to the contrary: Most American runway models measure\nwithin an inch or two of 6 feet tall, but weigh between just 120 and 124 pounds. With images of these\nmodels everywhere, many are growing concerned about their effect on American youths, especially teen\ngirls.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n205 Studies have shown that images of ultra-thin models distort women\u2019s views of health and beauty, leading\nto depression, extreme dieting, and eating disorders. In one study, 69 percent of girls said that fashion\nmodels influence their idea of the perfect body shape, despite the fact that most models weigh 23 percent\nless than the average female. [6] Another study showed that 68 percent of Stanford University\nundergraduate and graduate students felt worse about themselves after looking through a women\u2019s\nmagazine. [7] Even more worrisome is the fact that young girls are being negatively affected by magazine\nimages. \u201cThe number one wish for girls 11 to 17 is to be thinner, and girls as young as 5 have expressed\nfears of getting fat. Eighty percent of 10-year-old girls have dieted.\u201d [8]\nSome companies are fighting the trend of using super-thin models in their advertising. In 2004, Dove\nlaunched its Dove Campaign for Real Beauty; the company claims the goal of the ad campaign is to \u201chelp\nfree ourselves and the next generation from beauty stereotypes.\u201d [9] Dove\u2019s ads feature women of many\nshapes, sizes, and ethnicities in little more than their undergarments. Dove has stated that it plans to\ncontinue using \u201creal women\u201d in marketing campaigns. [10]\nCelebrity Magazines\nCelebrity gossip is not just reserved for teen audiences. A stroll through a supermarket checkout lane\nreveals the vast assortment of celebrity magazines\u2014also known as gossip magazines\u2014that target adults.\nFirst popularized during the 1970s, these celebrity magazines offer readers an inside perspective on the\nlives of the famous. Many magazines publish gossip stories that humanize celebrities by featuring them in\na negative light. Despite the best efforts of celebrities and their agents, placement in these magazines can\nmake or break celebrities\u2019 reputations and foster much drama within the celebrity community. Because of\nintense competition for stories, celebrity magazines may pay large sums of money to celebrities or other\nsources for exclusive stories and photos. Celebrity magazines will be discussed in detail later in this\nchapter.\nKEY TAKEAWAY\n\uf0b7 When magazines began distributing nationwide, advertising underwent significant changes. Advertisers\ntook advantage of the widespread audience and started marketing national trends. Advertising costs\nskyrocketed, as individuals across the country would now see and be influenced by the ads in magazines.\n\uf0b7 During the 20th century, new types of magazines\u2014such as literary magazines, pulp magazines, fan\nmagazines, teen magazines, and celebrity magazines\u2014all contributed to shared pop culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n206 EXERCISES\nLook through a teen magazine like Seventeen or CosmoGIRL! and examine the models present in them.\nThen, answer the following writing prompts.\n1. Do you see any images that might negatively affect young readers? Do you see any images that\npromote a healthy body image? How might magazines alter their advertisements and articles to more\npositively affect young audiences?\n2. How does this magazine differ from the magazines in the early 1900s? What advertising differences\ndo you see?\n3. How might the backlash against pulp magazines in the 1930s have contributed to the rise of teen\nmagazines?\n[1] Richard Ohmann, Selling Culture: Magazines, Markets, and Class at the Turn of the Century (New York: Verso,\n1996), 26.\n[2] Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. \u201cHistory of Publishing,\u201d\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing.\n[3] Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. \u201cHistory of Publishing,\u201d\nhttp://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing.\n[4] Jamie Coville, \u201cThe Comic Book Villain, Dr. Fredric Wertham, M.D.,\u201d Seduction of the Innocents and the Attack\non Comic Books, http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html.\n[5] Nanci Hellmich, \u201cDo Thin Models Warp Girls\u2019 Body Image?\u201d USA Today, September 26,\n2006, http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-25-thin-models_x.htm.\n[6] Healthy Place, \u201cEating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,\u201d December 11, 2008,\nhttp://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/.\n[7] Healthy Place, \u201cEating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,\u201d December 11, 2008,\nhttp://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/.\n[8] Healthy Place, \u201cEating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,\u201d December 11, 2008,\nhttp://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/.\n[9] Dove, \u201cCampaign for Real Beauty,\u201d http://www.dove.us/#/cfrb/about_cfrb.aspx.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n207 [10] Sophia Morrell, \u201cIs the Use of Eating-Disorder Sufferers in Dove\u2019s Ad Campaign an Act of\nDesperation?\u201d Marketing Week, August 16, 2007, http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/analysis/is-the-use-of-eating-\ndisorder-sufferers-in-doves-ad-campaign-an-act-of-desperation?/2057515.article.\n5.3\nMajor Publications in the Magazine Industry\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. List the top three highest circulation journals.\n2. Discuss the controversial transformation of Cosmopolitan magazine.\nMagazines have evolved significantly since their inception. Magazines have affected the world by\nbringing news, entertainment, literature, and photography to their readers. Additionally, the\nmagazine industry has profoundly affected U.S. popular culture. As magazines have developed over\ntime, individual publications have targeted specific groups and have found particular niches. This\nsection explores a number of popular periodicals and their effect on their target audiences.\nHigh-Circulation Magazines\nThe top-10 highest circulating magazines in the United States differ greatly in style and audience.\nFrom AARP to Better Homes and Gardens, from National Geographic to Family Circle, the list\ndemonstrates the wide pool of readers and interests attracted to the medium. This section will explore the\ntop three publications: AARP The Magazine, AARP Bulletin, and Reader\u2019s Digest.\nAARP The Magazine and AARP Bulletin\nSome may be surprised to learn that the two magazines with the highest circulation in the United States\nare not ones readily available to buy at a newsstand or grocery store: AARP The Magazine and AARP\nBulletin. Published by the nonprofit organization AARP (formerly known as the American Association of\nRetired Persons), both are automatically sent to the organization\u2019s more than 40 million members.\nA bimonthly publication that is \u201cgeared exclusively towards 50+ Americans seeking to enhance their\nquality of life as they age,\u201d [1] AARP The Magazine publishes lifestyle articles and includes sections\ndedicated to health, money, work, relationships, and travel, among others. Its mission statement reads as\nfollows:\nAARP The Magazine provides three editorial versions targeted to different life stages (50\u201359, 60\u201369,\n70+) to empower readers with editorial written just for them. Annual editorial packages, strong service\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n208 journalism, and celebrity profiles will be presented in a warm, vibrant and inviting format to encourage\nreaders to reflect, engage and enjoy. [2]\nAARP also publishes AARP Bulletin, which is \u201ca monthly news publication that reaches influential\nconsumers and policymakers.\u201d [3] Rather than presenting lifestyle stories, this publication focuses on news\nstories of interest to its target audience.\nAARP Bulletin chronicles and interprets important social issues that affect 50+ Americans. News,\nbalanced analysis and concise stories, in an accessible format, motivates these influential readers to\nengage in public policy on health care, financial well-being and consumer protection. [4]\nReader\u2019s Digest\nReader\u2019s Digest boasts the third-highest circulation among U.S. magazines. First published in 1922 as a\n\u201cdigest of condensed articles of topical interest and entertainment value taken from other\nperiodicals,\u201d [5] this famous pocket-sized journal was first produced on a low budget by a husband and wife\nteam who believed the magazine would sell despite numerous rejections from magazine\npublishers. [6] They were right. Reader\u2019s Digest was an almost immediate success and now regularly\noutsells competitors. The monthly magazine has subscribers around the globe and seeks to \u201ccreate\nproducts that inform, enrich, entertain and inspire people of all ages and cultures around the world.\u201d [7]\nNews Magazines\nAs discussed in , newsmagazines became popular during the 1920s. Today, newsmagazines make up a\nlarge portion of magazine sales, with multiple news periodicals ranking in the top 30 for circulation. Over\ntime, a number of newsmagazines have established themselves in the industry, including Time,\nNewsweek, and U.S. News & World Report.\nNewsweek\nNewsweek\u2019s initial February 1933 issue was called News-Week and featured seven different photographs\nfrom the week\u2019s news on its cover. The weekly publication currently \u201coffers comprehensive coverage of\nworld events with a global network of correspondents, reporters and editors covering national and\ninternational affairs, business, science and technology, society and the arts and entertainment.\u201d [8] Relying\non a wide array of reporters, Newsweek also uniquely publishes a reader-penned section titled \u201cMy Turn.\u201d\nThe magazine has been hugely successful over the years and holds more prestigious National Magazine\nAwards than any other newsweekly.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n209 The magazine has not been without its trials, however. In November of 2009Newsweek published an\narticle discussing Sarah Palin\u2019s book, Going Rogue: An American Life. The cover of that issue featured a\nphoto of Palin that had been used in an issue of Runner\u2019s World with Palin in running attire. The words\n\u201cHow Do You Solve a Problem Like Sarah?\u201d were splayed across the photograph.\nThe cover caused a popular backlash, with readers calling it sexist and unfair. One reader suggested that\nNewsweek would never print a photograph of Barack Obama in such attire. In response, Newsweek\npublished a photo of President Obama in his swim trunks in its following issue, although this photo was\nsmaller and on an inside page rather than on the cover.\nTime\nTime has remained an influential publication during the decades since its inception. Today, the\npublication prides itself on its \u201crare convergence of incisive reporting, lively writing and world-renowned\nphotography,\u201d which combined have earned it the praise of being \u201cjournalism at its best.\u201d[9] The magazine\nis divided into four main sections: Briefing, The Well, Life, and Arts. Briefing includes concise stories on\nmajor news events in the United States and other countries. The Well section features longer articles,\nincluding the cover story and articles on world and business. Life contains stories on health, science,\ntechnology, and the environment. Finally, Arts consists of reviews of theater, film, literature, music,\nexhibits, and architecture. LikeNewsweek, Time has won numerous awards and prides itself on being \u201cthe\nguide through chaos\u201d in an era of information overload. [10]\nU.S. News & World Report\nCreated through the merger of a newspaper and a magazine, U.S. News & World Report has gained great\nprestige over the years. In 1933\u2014the same year that Newsweek debuted\u2014journalist David Lawrence\nbegan publishing a weekly newspaper called the United States News. Six years later, he founded a weekly\nmagazine titled World Report. In 1948, the two weeklies merged to create the new U.S. News & World\nReport. The magazine\u2019s focus is similar to those of Time and Newsweek, but U.S. News & World\nReport concentrates more on political, economic, health, and education stories, perhaps in part because it\nis based in Washington, DC. Although for most of its long history the magazine published weekly, in 2008\nit announced its transition to a monthly printing schedule, vowing to concentrate on its website.\nThe magazine is perhaps best known for its annual ranking of U.S. colleges. This ranking began in 1983\nand has since evolved to include newsstand books of America\u2019s Best Colleges and America\u2019s Best\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n210 Graduate Schools. Since the ranking system began, students turn to the publication for information about\nthe strengths and weaknesses of institutions of higher learning.\nWomen\u2019s Magazines\nFemale readers have been important to the magazine industry since the early 19th century, initially\nbecause women were not traditionally part of the workforce and were believed to have more leisure time\nto read. This lucrative market has only grown over time. In an increasingly online era, many magazines\nhave sought ways to expand their scope to reach a larger audience. Yet others, such as Ladies\u2019 Home\nJournal, Good Housekeeping, and Better Homes and Gardens, have maintained their original scope and\nhave still managed to turn profits. These three periodicals are part of the \u201cSeven Sisters,\u201d a group of\nmagazines traditionally targeted at women.\nLadies\u2019 Home Journal\nLadies\u2019 Home Journal began in 1879 as a column for women published in the Tribune and\nFarmer newspaper. The wife of the publisher was not entirely impressed with her husband\u2019s column and\nso began writing it herself. [11] The column grew in popularity so rapidly that, by 1883, Louisa Knapp\nCurtis had published her first major supplement called the Ladies Home Journal and Practical\nHousekeeper. Today, the publishers of the Ladies\u2019 Home Journal state that it is \u201ca unique lifestyle\nmagazine dedicated to the millions of American women who want to look good, do good and feel\ngreat.\u201d [12] Ranked twelfth in circulation, the magazine presently has a readership of nearly 4\nmillion. [13]Ladies\u2019 Home Journal focuses on style, health, relationships, and food. Perhaps its most\nrecognizable feature is a column titled \u201cCan This Marriage Be Saved?,\u201d which made its debut in 1953. The\nregular column features stories of real-life couples struggling in their marriages, offers advice from\nmarriage and family therapists, and projects the outcomes.\nGood Housekeeping\nIn May of 1885, Good Housekeeping began publishing with the intention of providing \u201cinformation about\nrunning a home, a broad range of literary offerings, and opportunities for reader input.\u201d [14] Fifteen years\nlater, the magazine founded the Good Housekeeping Research Institute. The research institute includes a\nproduct-evaluation laboratory where a staff of scientists, engineers, nutritionists, and researchers evaluate\na wide variety of products. The magazine then reports their findings to its readers to \u201cimprove the lives of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n211 consumers and their families through education and product evaluation.\u201d [15]The magazine describes itself\nas follows:\nDevoted to contemporary women. Monthly articles focus on food, fitness, beauty, and childcare using the\nresources of the Good Housekeeping Institute. From human interest stories and social issues to money\nmanagement and travel, the magazine will encourage positive living for today\u2019s woman. [16]\nWith over 4.6 million readers, Good Housekeeping currently ranks ninth highest in U.S. circulation. [17]\nBetter Homes and Gardens\nMaking its print debut in 1922, Better Homes and Gardens entered the industry later than its\ncounterparts. Currently, the magazine is ranked fifth in circulation in the United States with a readership\nof more than 7.6 million. [18] Since its inception, the publication has focused on home and gardening style\nand decorations. Its positioning statement reads as follows:\nFor the woman who reads Better Homes and Gardens, home is where she creates her life story. It\u2019s her\nhaven, where she raises her family, entertains friends, and celebrates life\u2019s big\u2014and small\u2014\naccomplishments. It\u2019s where she indulges her dreams and builds a world of her own. Home is her\nemotional center\u2014it\u2019s where life happens. Better Homes and Gardens recognizes this and inspires her\nwith infinite possibilities for creativity and self-expression. Each issue delivers smart, approachable\neditorial on design and individual style, decorating and gardening, food and entertaining, and personal\nand family well-being. Better Homes and Gardens helps her bridge the gap between dreaming and\ndoing. [19]\nThe monthly magazine is divided into six sections: Food and Nutrition, Home, Health, Family, Gardening,\nand Lifestyle.\nCosmopolitan\nFirst published in 1886, the female-targeted Cosmopolitan has changed dramatically over time from its\noriginal intent of being a \u201cfirst-class family magazine.\u201d [20] In the first issue, the editor told readers that\n\u201cthere will be a department devoted exclusively to the interests of women, with articles on fashions, on\nhousehold decoration, on cooking, and the care and management of children, etc., also a department for\nthe younger members of the family.\u201d [21]Just 2 years later, however, the original publishing company went\nout of business, and after several publisher changes Cosmopolitan was eventually purchased by\nnewspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst in 1905.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n212 The magazine became more successful during the 1960s when Helen Gurley Brown \u201ctransformed an\nantiquated general-interest mag called Cosmopolitan into the must-read for young, sexy single\nchicks.\u201d [22] Brown transformed the magazine from the family-focused publication it was to the somewhat\ncontroversial read with an emphasis on sex, work, and fashion that it is today. The magazine describes the\ntransformation saying the following:\nOver the years, Cosmo has not only become the number-one-selling monthly magazine on the newsstand,\nbut it has also served as an agent for social change, encouraging women everywhere to go after what they\nwant (whether it be in the boardroom or the bedroom). [23]\nIn 1965, Cosmopolitan revamped its journal with Brown\u2019s vision in mind. The first retooled issue had an\narticle about birth-control pills, then a relatively new and controversial innovation. The magazine\u2019s\nprovocative articles attracted a large readership, but many found it offensive. Conservatives believed that\nthe content was too racy, while some feminists thought it was too focused on beauty and pleasing\nmen. [24] Yet the publishers of Cosmopolitan believed that they were introducing a new form of\nfeminism. [25] Brown argued that \u201cCosmo is feminist in that we believe women are just as smart and\ncapable as men are and can achieve anything men can. But it also acknowledges that while work is\nimportant, men are too. The Cosmo girl absolutely loves men!\u201d [26]\nToday, Cosmopolitan continues to attract readers by maintaining the same ideals that Brown put forth in\nthe 1960s. Nearly 30 percent of every issue is dedicated to relationships, sex especially. The rest provides\narticles on beauty, fashion, entertainment, health and fitness, and self-improvement.\nMen\u2019s Magazines\nJust as women\u2019s magazines have existed for much of the history of the medium, over the years many\nmagazines have been devoted to male readers. One of the most enduring and popular of those magazines\nis Sports Illustrated.\nSports Illustrated\nWhen Time cocreator Henry Luce launched Sports Illustrated in 1954, his staff was doubtful about its\nchances. Spectator sports had not yet reached the level of popularity they have today, and the new\nmagazine failed to make a profit for its first 12 years of publication. As television brought spectator sports\nto the growing suburbs, however, their popularity quickly rose, and Sports Illustrated became a success.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n213 Managing editor Andre Laguerre assembled a staff of talented, loyal writers and instituted the extensive\nuse of color photographs, developing the basis for the format the magazine still uses.\nIn 1964, Laguerre initiated the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition as a way of increasing sales during the\nwinter months when there are fewer developments in sports. Putting model Babette March on the cover in\na bikini helped the magazine sell, and the swimsuit edition became an annual tradition. Filled with\npictures of models in revealing swimwear, the issue generates its share of controversy but is consistently\nthe best-selling issue of the magazine each year.\nCelebrity Magazines\nDespite being criticized at times for their less-than-sophisticated approach to journalism, celebrity\nmagazines bring in enormous profits and help shape U.S. pop culture, fueling the obsession some\nAmericans have with the mundane day-to-day details of the lives of celebrities. Three of the most\nprominent celebrity magazines currently publishing are People, OK!, and Us Weekly.\nPeople\nSince it first began publishing as a spin-off of Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPeople\u201d section in 1974, People has been a\nleading celebrity magazine. The publication sets itself apart from other celebrity gossip magazines by\npublishing human-interest stories alongside photos and articles about celebrities. The publishers\nof Peoplestate that they avoid pure Hollywood gossip articles and they refuse to publish stories without\nsome sort of verification. [27] This editorial slant is unique among celebrity magazines, and, as such, the\npublication frequently receives exclusive interviews and photo shoots with celebrities. The somewhat\nmore respectful relationship between the publishers and some celebrities has helped People become the\nmost popular celebrity magazine in circulation, ranking thirteenth overall with a verified readership of\nover 3.6 million in 2010. [28]\nOK!\nA British-run magazine that began publishing in 1993, OK! claims to \u201cbring you the truth and the inside\nscoop about celebrities.\u201d [29] Known for its exclusive interviews that often lead to public announcements on\npregnancies and engagements, OK! initially had a policy to print only positive celebrity profiles.[30] That\npolicy changed in 2007 thanks to an erratic interview with pop singer Britney Spears, which was so\nsurprising that the magazine decided to break with tradition and publish it anyway. [31] In 2008, Spears\nagreed to a second interview with the publication in which she discussed her previous behavior, leading to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n214 a more positive profile of the singer. The widely successful magazine has readers around the world along\nwith several branch publications.\nUs Weekly\nFounded in 1977, Us Weekly followed the format of a bimonthly entertainment news and review magazine\nuntil 2000, when it switched formats to become a weekly leader in celebrity news and style. The\npublication \u201cdelivers a mass audience of young, educated, and affluent adults who are compelled by\nbreaking celebrity news, Hollywood style and the best in entertainment.\u201d [32] Us Weekly has become\nknown for its fashion sections such as \u201cWho Wore It Best?,\u201d a reader poll comparing two celebrities\nwearing the same outfit, and \u201cFashion Police,\u201d in which comedians comment on celebrity fashion mishaps\nand successes. With a circulation of nearly 2 million in December 2010, Us Weekly prides itself on being a\nleader in the celebrity magazine industry.

Describe how the formats of newspapers and magazines differ.\n2. Explain the impact of advertisements on story.\nMagazines control the public\u2019s access to information in a variety of ways. Like the newspaper\nindustry, the magazine industry dictates not only which stories get told but also how those stories are\npresented. Although significant similarities between the newspaper and magazine industries\u2019 control\nover information exist, some notable differences within the industries themselves deserve\nexploration.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n217 Format\nIn general, the format of most magazines allows for a more in-depth discussion of a topic than is possible\nin the relatively constrained space available in newspapers. Most large newspapers, such as The\nWashington Post or the Los Angeles Times, generally cap even their longest articles at 1,000\nwords. [1]Magazines, however, frequently allow for double that word count when publishing articles of\ngreat interest. [2] Length, however, varies from magazine to magazine and story to story. Coverage of the\nwar in Iraq offers a good example of this variance. Researchers studied magazine coverage of Iraq over a\nperiod of 4 weeks in 2003 by examining the difference in reporting among Time, Newsweek, and U.S.\nNews & World Report.\nIn these four issues, the war in Iraq accounted for more than a fifth (22 percent) of all stories and roughly\na third (32 percent) of all the space. These stories were also more likely than others to be long and in\ndepth\u2026. There were also differences in the way that the three magazines covered the situation. Time\ndevoted the most space to the war, 37 percent, compared to the 34 percent for Newsweek and 24 percent\nfor U.S. News. And again, Time had more long stories (seven stories in the four issues studied were more\nthan 2,000 words).Newsweek ran six long stories in the four issues studied and U.S. News ran two long\nstories. [3]\nAlthough these differences might not appear that great, the results reflect editorial choice and, therefore,\nthe power the magazine industry has over information control.\nChoice to Publish\nJust as newspapers do, magazines control which stories reach the public by deciding which articles to\ninclude in their publications. As might be expected, the choice of stories depends on the political climate\nand on global events.\nLeading newsmagazines Time and Newsweek both underwent major transitions in their content during\nthe late 20th century. Between the 1970s and 1990s, both greatly increased science articles, entertainment\narticles, and stories on personal health. Interestingly, despite both publications\u2019 stated commitment to\nnews, a dramatic decrease took place in articles on domestic- and foreign-government affairs. Whether\nthese changes reflected a change in reader interest or an alteration in the editors\u2019 perspectives remains\nunclear; however, these shifts demonstrate that what is published is entirely up to the magazine and its\neditorial staff, as they are the ones who have the final word.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n218 Advertisers\u2019 Influence\nMagazines derive approximately half of their income from advertisers. [4] With such a large stake in the\nmagazine industry, advertisers can play a major role in deciding which stories are printed. Because\nmagazines are so dependent on advertisers for their revenue, they are cautious about the content they\nplace in their pages.\nMagazines tend to shy away from controversial content that can turn off advertisers. Recently, a large\nAmerican auto manufacturer sent a memo to about 50 magazines asking that their ad agency be notified if\nfuture issues of the magazine contained articles that addressed political, sexual, or social issues that might\nbe seen as provocative, controversial, or offensive. [5]\nThe balance that magazines must maintain to keep advertisers happy is a delicate one. With ad prices\ndriving the magazine industry, many publications are forced to satisfy advertisers by avoiding potentially\ncontroversial stories.\nAnother anecdote about advertisers controlling stories illustrates how some publishers must conform to\nadvertiser demands.\nIn an even more blatant attempt to influence magazine content, another large corporation informed a\nnumber of magazine publishers that the content of their magazines would be carefully monitored for\nseveral months and that a large advertising contract would be awarded to the publication that portrayed\ntheir industry in the most favorable light. [6]\nWith stories such as these, it may seem easy to paint the advertising industry as an evil, controlling entity\nthat seeks to keep stories from the public. While advertisers may exhibit some control over stories, they\nalso have a lot at stake.\nAs online media grows, today many advertisers are pulling their expensive print ads in favor of cheaper,\nweb-based advertisements. [7] Advertising revenue has decreased steadily since the 1990s, mirroring the\nrise in online readership. [8]This drop in advertising may, in fact, force magazines to give advertisers more\ncontrol over their content to avoid losing further funding. While it may be difficult to precisely pin down\nthe level of influence advertisers exert over magazine content, evidence suggests they do exert some\ncontrol.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n219 Editorial Leanings\nEach magazine has its own editorial slant, which helps determine which stories get published and how\nthose stories are presented. A 2003 study examining leading newsmagazines Time, Newsweek, and U.S.\nNews & World Report verified these differences by demonstrating variations in how the publications\npresented their articles to the reading public.\nU.S. News & World Report \u2026 is the most information-laden, the most likely to publish highly traditional\nhard news topics and the most likely to report in a neutral manner\u2014a more straightforward accounting of\nthe facts of events with less of a writer\u2019s \u201ctake\u201d or opinion on what those events mean. Newsweek is\nlighter, more oriented toward lifestyle and celebrity coverage, and more likely to publish stories that\ncontain an emotional component. Time magazine is something of a hybrid between the two. Its content is\nmore like U.S. News\u2019\u2014neutral and information driven. Its covers, on the other hand, look a good deal\nmore like Newsweek\u2019s\u2014highlighting lifestyle and entertainment. [9]\nThese distinctions among the three publications may seem slight, but they have an effect on the\ninformation contained between their covers. However, these editorial leanings do not make one magazine\nmore prestigious or valid than the others; U.S. News & World Report may offer facts and figures about a\nparticular event, while Newsweek may provide the human side of the story. Readers should understand,\nthough, that several variables affect the articles that they see in each publication.\nOnline News Sources\nThe Internet has significantly changed the way that the public receives information. The advent of online\nnews sources has somewhat lessened the control that magazines have over information. Today, several\nonline-only magazines provide, for little to no cost, news and coverage that would have previously been\navailable only through print publications. Online-only magazines include Slate, which offers a daily digest\nof information from newspapers around the globe, and Salon, which provides readers many stories for\nfree and more in-depth coverage for a subscription cost. Like their print counterparts, online magazines\nrely on revenue from advertisers, but because that advertising is less costly, advertisers may have less of a\nstake in online content. All these factors contribute to changing perspectives on the way that information\nis being controlled in the journalism industry.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n220 \uf0b7 In general, magazine formats offer more space for coverage than newspapers. This increased space\npermits greater coverage and can give readers more in-depth information about events.\n\uf0b7 Advertisers, which provide approximately half of all magazine revenue, maintain some control over the\nmagazine industry by threatening to pull ads from magazines that print stories that are considered too\nracy, too political, or not consistent with their beliefs.\nEXERCISES\nSelect a current major news event that interests you. Read an article from a major newspaper and an\narticle from a magazine on the event. Then, answer the following writing prompts.\n1. How do the articles differ? How are they similar?\n2. What advertisements surround the article? How might they affect the story or reveal who the target\naudience is?\n3. Do you think that this audience has an effect on the way the story is covered?

Identify different types of specialized magazines.\n2. Recognize ways that advertisers benefit from the specialization of magazines.\nOver the last century, magazines have slowly moved into more specialized, fragmented groupings.\nThis transformation from general-interest to niche publications began with the popularization of\ntelevision. To survive the threat posed by the success of broadcast media, print publications worked\nto stand out from their competitors by developing market niches. During this transition, magazine\neditors found that by specializing they were also appealing to advertisers hoping to reach specific\naudiences. No longer were ads just going out to the general public. Instead, advertisers could target\ngroups by gender, age, race, class, and social and cultural interests. [1]\nFrom the medical field to the auto industry, specialization has become necessary to compete in an\never-growing market. Yet the trend is perhaps most obvious in mass media and in the publishing\nindustry in particular. \u201cIn 2006, the Magazine Publishers of America trade organization listed more\nthan 40 special categories of consumer magazines.\u201d [2] This wide variety of niche publications reflects\nthe increasing specificity of markets and audiences. \u201cIn publishing, demand for specialized\nmagazines and books can be evidenced by looking at the magazine rack. [There are] magazines\nfocusing on photography to cars, to economics and foreign affairs and more.\u201d [3] Specialization is\nlikely to increase, rather than decrease. \u201cMarket fragmentation has and probably will continue to\nproliferate. Customization and individualization will probably be the continuing trend.\u201d [4]\nProfessional Trade Publications\nNearly every trade group produces some sort of professional publication for its members. Many trade\norganizations even have their own libraries that house publications solely dedicated to their specific\ngroups. For example, if a person wishes to find information on agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting\norganizations, the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland, near Washington, DC, might offer\na starting point. This library is one of four national libraries of the United States and has one of the\nworld\u2019s largest agricultural information collections and links a nationwide network of state land-grant and\nU.S. Department of Agriculture field libraries. [5] This is but one example of the array of trade-group\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n222 publications available. Resources such as the Career Resource Library are also available to those who wish\nto browse publications by trade groups.\nScholarly Publications\nAcademic journals have, in some form, been around since the early years of magazine publication. During\nthe 17th century, the Universal Historical Biblioth\u00e8que became the first journal to invite scholarly\ncontributions. Today, hundreds of scholarly journals exist, such as the American Economic Review\nand The Journal of Marriage and Families, and every academic field has its own array of journals to\nwhich scholars can contribute. Most university libraries allow students and faculty access to these journals\nvia library databases.\nIn every academic field, journals are ranked based on the types of articles they publish and on their\nselectiveness. Most academic journals use a peer-reviewing process to determine which articles are\nprinted. During this process, a panel of readers reviews an anonymous article and then decides whether to\naccept the paper, accept with changes, or reject it altogether. Scholarly publication is essential for\ngraduate students and university faculty members alike as they seek to disseminate their ideas and\nprogress in their careers.\nReligious Groups\nWith faith at the center of many individuals\u2019 lives, it is hardly surprising that there are hundreds of\nmagazines dedicated to religious groups. From Christianity Today to Catholic Digest, Christian\npublications make up the largest group of religious magazines. But Christianity is not the only faith\nrepresented in periodicals. Kashrus Magazine targets the Jewish community, and Shambhala Sun is\naffiliated with the Buddhist faith. Additionally, certain magazines, such as CrossCurrents, are designed\nfor people of all faiths. The magazine\u2019s publishers state that CrossCurrents serves as \u201ca global network for\npeople of faith and intelligence who are committed to connecting the wisdom of the heart and the life of\nthe mind.\u201d [6]\nPolitical Groups\nPolitical groups also have capitalized on the magazine industry. Whether liberal or conservative, most\npeople can find a publication that reflects their political opinions. Two such magazines are The American\nProspect and The American Conservative. The American Prospect targets Democrats with \u201cthoughtful\nviews of America\u2019s progressive liberal Democratic issues, ideas, politics and policy.\u201d[7] Conversely, the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n223 American Conservative is aimed at right-leaning individuals. Edited by well-known conservatives Pat\nBuchanan and Taki Theodoracopulos, this biweekly \u201cis dedicated to reigniting the conservative\nconversation, engaging the neo-conservative agenda through its espousal of traditional conservative\nthemes.\u201d [8]\nPulp and Genre Fiction Magazines\nAlthough today not as many pulp magazines publish as did at the style\u2019s height of popularity, during the\n1930s, this unique niche still plays an important role in the magazine industry. One such example\nis Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, a science fiction magazine founded in 1977 and still popular today. Founded\nbecause \u201cone of science fiction\u2019s most influential and prolific writers, Isaac Asimov wanted to provide a\nhome for new SF (science fiction) writers\u2014a new magazine that young writers could break into. Asimov\u2019s\nScience Fiction remains that home, as well as the publisher of some of the field\u2019s best known\nauthors.\u201d [9] True to its original intention, the magazine publishes stories of varying lengths for the avid\nscience fiction fan.\nAnother modern example of a genre magazine is Ellery Queen\u2019s Mystery Magazine. First launched in\n1941 to \u201craise the sights of mystery writers generally to a genuine literary form,\u201d to \u201cencourage good\nwriting among our colleagues by offering a practical market not otherwise available,\u201d and to \u201cdevelop new\nwriters seeking expression in the genre,\u201d [10] the journal has published a large number of now famous\nwriters including Rudyard Kipling, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, and Alice\nWalker. Today, the publication prides itself on being \u201con the cutting edge of crime and mystery fiction,\noffering readers the very best stories being written in the genre anywhere in the world.\u201d [11] Though pulp\nand genre fiction magazines tend to have a fairly low circulation\u2014Asimov\u2019s circulation in 2009 was about\n17,000\u2014the caliber of the authors they often attract gives these publications a great degree of influence\nwithin their respective niches. [12]\nHobby and Interest Magazines\nPerhaps the most populated classification is that of hobby and special-interest magazines, a reflection of\nthe wide array of hobbies and interests that different individuals enjoy. Within this classification of\njournals, one can find magazines on such topics as sports (Sports Illustrated), wellness (Health), cooking\n(Bon App\u00e9tit), home decoration and renovation (This Old House), and travel and geography (National\nGeographic).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n224 Readers interested in specific hobbies can generally find a magazine that caters to them. Photographers,\nfor example, can subscribe to the British Journal of Photography, the world\u2019s longest-running\nphotography magazine, in publication since 1854. This journal prints \u201cprofiles of emerging talent\nalongside star names, a picture-led Portfolio section, business analysis and detailed technology\nreviews.\u201d [13] Music enthusiasts can choose from an array of publications ranging from more general ones\nsuch as Spin and the International Early Music Review to highly specific such as the Journal of the\nInternational Double Reed Society and Just Jazz Guitar. There are also magazines entirely devoted to\ncrafting, such as Creating Keepsakes for scrapbook enthusiasts, and for pet ownership, such as the\nappropriately named Pet.\nFashion has provided a highly lucrative and visible interest magazine market. Founded in 1892, the most\nfamous fashion magazine is Vogue. \u201cVogue has been America\u2019s cultural barometer, putting fashion in the\ncontext of the larger world we live in\u2014how we dress, live, socialize; what we eat, listen to, watch; who\nleads and inspires us.\u201d [14] The magazine has a huge following, with a circulation topping 1.2 million\nreaders. Vogue\u2019s mission statement declares an intent to lead the way in the fashion magazine industry:\nVogue\u2019s story is the story of women, of culture, of what is worth knowing and seeing, of individuality and\ngrace, and of the steady power of earned influence. For millions of women each month, Vogue is the eye of\nthe culture, inspiring and challenging them to see things differently, in both themselves and the world. [15]\nDespite Vogue\u2019s high circulation, most special-interest magazines have a smaller readership. This can be\nworrisome for editors charged with adding more subscriptions to make a larger profit. However, the\nappeal of such specific audiences generates more revenue from advertisers, who can purchase magazine\nspace knowing that their ads are reaching a targeted audience.\nVogue Crosses Media Lines\nIn recent years, Vogue has served as inspiration for two major films: The Devil Wears Prada (2006)\nand The September Issue (2009). Based on Lauren Weisberger\u2019s novel of the same name, The Devil\nWears Prada is a feature film about a young woman living in New York dreaming of becoming a magazine\nwriter. She lands a job as the assistant to the city\u2019s most ruthless magazine editor, Miranda Priestly\u2014\nplayed by Meryl Streep\u2014who runs Runway magazine, a fictionalized version of Vogue. This coming-of-\nage story highlights the work that goes into producing a magazine of such prestige. Streep was nominated\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n225 for an Oscar award for her performance and, appropriately for a film about fashion, the costume designer\nwas also nominated for Best Achievement in Costume Design.\nThe September Issue is a documentary chronicling Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour\u2019s preparation for\nthe 2007 fall fashion issue. Wintour, the editor upon whom Streep\u2019s character in The Devil Wears\nPrada was loosely based, [16] is well known for being a powerful influence on the fashion industry and a\ndemanding editor. The film, however, humanizes her, while still demonstrating her obsession with\nfashion and with perfection in her magazine.\nThe success of both films reveals a fascination with the fashion and publishing industries. The fact that\nthese two films would be released as the magazine industry is in decline is surprising but perhaps reflects\nan interest in journalism from a younger audience. The use of publishing as a topic in the film medium\nshows how magazines, though struggling, remain relevant and how special-interest magazines, like those\nin fashion, can transcend the medium and cross over into other mass media.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Niche publications include magazines that cater to hobbyists in such diverse fields as sports, crafts, music,\nand even pets. Some modern niche publications hearken back to the pulp magazines of the 1930s.\n\uf0b7 Although niche markets for magazines mean fewer readers, advertisers often prefer to publish ads in\nthese more specialized publications because their ads will reach a more targeted demographic, thus\nensuring that nearly everyone reading the journal will have an interest in their product.\nEXERCISES\nConsider the specialized magazines discussed in this section, as well as others you are familiar with, and\nidentify whether or not you are among the target audience for each. Then, read a copy of a magazine\ntargeting a specialized group or demographic you are not a part of.

Describe how print magazines have adapted to an online market.\n2. Indicate a unique benefit of print magazines archiving back issues on their websites.\nIn March of 2010, Consumerist published a story titled \u201cPrint edition of TV Guide tells me to go\nonline to read most of cover story.\u201d According to the article, TV Guide printed a story listing \u201cTV\u2019s\nTop 50 Families,\u201d but shocked readers by including only the top 20 families in its print version. To\ndiscover the rest of the list, readers needed to go online. [1] As dismayed as some readers were, this\nstory reflects an ongoing trend in magazine journalism: the move toward online reporting.\nJust like their newspaper cousins, magazines have been greatly affected by the influence of the\nInternet. With so much information available online, advertisers and readers are accessing content\non the Internet, causing declines in both revenue and readership. These changes are forcing\nmagazines to adapt to an increasingly online market.\nOnline-Only Magazines\nIn 1995, Salon launched the first major online-only magazine athttp://www.salon.com. \u201cSalon, the\naward-winning online news and entertainment website, combines original investigative stories, breaking\nnews, provocative personal essays and highly respected criticism along with popular staff-written blogs\nabout politics, technology and culture.\u201d [2] Like many print magazines, the site divides content into\nsections including entertainment, books, comics, life, news and politics, and technology and business.\nWith an average of 5.8 million monthly unique visitors, this online magazine demonstrates the potential\nsuccesses of Internet-based publications. [3]\nOther online-only magazines include Slate and PC Magazine. All three magazines, like most online\npublications, support themselves in part through ads that appear alongside articles and other content.\nFounded in 1996, Slate is a \u201cgeneral interest publication offering analysis and commentary about politics,\nnews, and culture.\u201d [4] Considering itself \u201ca daily magazine on the Web,\u201d Slateoffers its readers\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n228 information on news and politics, arts, life, business, technology, and science via online articles, podcasts,\nand blogs. [5] The successful magazine has been recognized with numerous awards for its contributions to\njournalism.\nPC Magazine differs somewhat from Slate or Salon in that it was originally a print publication. First\npublished in 1982, the computer magazine published hard-copy issues for over 15 years before\nannouncing in 2008 that its January 2009 issue would be its last printed edition. In an open letter to its\nreaders, PC Magazine discussed the transition:\nStarting in February 2009, PC Magazine will become a 100-percent digital publication. So, in addition to\nour popular network of Websites \u2026 we\u2019ll offer PC Magazine Digital Edition to all of our print subscribers.\nThe PC Magazine Digital Edition has actually been available since 2002. So for thousands of you, the\nbenefits of this unique medium are already clear. And those benefits will continue to multiply in the\ncoming months, as we work hard to enhance your digital experience. [6]\nWhile it is perhaps fitting that this computer-focused publication is one of the first print magazines to\nmove to an entirely online form, its reasons for the transition were financial rather than creative. In\ndescribing the decision, Jason Young, chief executive of Ziff Davis Media, said, \u201c[t]he viability for us to\ncontinue to publish in print just isn\u2019t there anymore.\u201d [7] Unfortunately for the magazine industry, Young\u2019s\nsentiment reflects a trend that has been building for some time. Several other publications have followed\nin PC Magazine\u2019s footsteps, making the move from print to online-only. Journals such as Elle\nGirl and Teen People that were once available in print can now be viewed only via the Internet. As\nprinting costs rise and advertising and subscription revenues decrease, more magazines will likely be\nmaking similar shifts.\nMagazine-Like Websites\nIn recent years, websites that function much as magazines once did without officially being publications\nthemselves have become an increasingly popular online model. For example, Pitchfork Media is an\nInternet publication on the music industry. Established in 1995, the site offers readers criticism and\ncommentary on contemporary music and has many of the same features as a traditional music magazine:\nreviews, news, articles, and interviews. Whether the site is capitalizing on the success of print magazines\nby following their format or if it is simply responding to its readers by providing them with an accessible\nonline experience is a debatable point. Of course, the website also has many features that would not be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n229 available in print, such as a streaming playlist of music and music videos. This hybrid of magazine-like\ncontent with new-media content offers a possible vision of the digital future of print publications.\nPrint Magazines with Online Presences\nIndeed, most print magazines have created websites. Nearly every major print publication has a site\navailable either for free or through subscription. Yet there are intrinsic differences between the print and\nonline media. Bernadette Geyer, author of a poetry chapbook, What Remains, discusses the practical\ncontrasts between online and print journals:\nI will read a print journal cover to cover because I can bookmark where I left off\u2026. Simply taking all the of\nthe content of what would have been a print issue and putting it online with links from a Table of\nContents is all well and good in theory, but I have to ask, how many people actually sit and read all of the\ncontents of an online journal that publishes several authors/genres per issue? [8]\nHer question is a good one, and one which most magazines have already asked themselves. In light of this\ndilemma, magazines with online editions have sought ways to attract readers who may not, in fact, read\nmuch. Most websites also include online-only content such as blogs, podcasts, and daily news updates\nthat, naturally, are not available in print form. The additional features on magazines\u2019 websites likely stem\nfrom a need to attract audiences with shorter attention spans and less time to devote to reading entire\narticles.\nAnother way that magazines court online readers is by offering back-issue content. Readers can browse\nold articles without having to remember in which issue the content first appeared. The cost for this varies\nfrom publication to publication. For example, CooksIllustrated.com reprints recipes from previous issues\nas part of a paid online membership service, while CookingLight.com offers back issues for free. Some\nmagazines have online archive collections, though those collections generally do not print entire articles\nor complete issues. Time, for example, offers \u201chand-picked covers and excerpts from the best articles on a\nwide variety of subjects.\u201d [9] Time suggests that one should \u201cuse them as chronological guides to Time\u2019s\npast coverage of a person, event, or topic.\u201d [10] Still, even without the entire collection online, there is a\ndistinct benefit of being able to search back for articles from 1923 from a computer.\nIs Print Dead?\nThe question Is print dead? has dominated the magazine and newspaper industries for several years. In\n2008, The New York Times printed an article titled \u201cMourning Old Media\u2019s Decline,\u201d in which author\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n230 David Carr describes multiple announcements of job loss in the print industry. Thousands of individuals\nworking at magazines and newspapers faced layoffs because of reduced subscriber and advertiser\ndemand. \u201cClearly the sky is falling,\u201d he writes, \u201cThe question now is how many people will be left to cover\nit.\u201d [11] At the same time, Carr articulates the shift in readership from print to web, saying, \u201cThe paradox of\nall these announcements is that newspapers and magazines do not have an audience problem\u2014newspaper\nwebsites are a vital source of news, and growing\u2014but they do have a consumer problem.\u201d [12] With a\nmajority of magazines and newspapers now available for free online, one has to wonder how the industry\nwill stay afloat. Although advertisements pay for a portion of the cost of running a magazine, it may not be\nenough.\nThe debate over whether print is still viable is a heated one that is infiltrating the magazine industry. At a\n2006 magazine editorial meeting, Glamour\u2019s editor in chief, Cindi Leive, claimed that she \u201cloves this\nquestion\u2026. Is print dead? Discuss!\u201d [13] The editor in chief of More magazine responded to the statement\nsaying, \u201c[i]t\u2019s what we talk about all day long.\u201d [14] But for as many people who are fighting for the print\nindustry to remain profitable, there is an equally vocal group arguing for the elimination of the print\nmedium altogether. In a 2005 published debate on the topic, former print editor-turned-blogger Jeff\nJarvis squared off against John Griffin, president of the National Geographic Society\u2019s magazine group.\nJarvis claimed, \u201cPrint is not dead. Print is where words go to die.\u201d But Griffin countered, \u201cActually print is\nwhere words go to live\u2014we\u2019re still reading the ancient Greeks.\u201d [15]\nRegardless of your position, the fact that the print industry is facing hardships is unquestionable.\nMagazines are rethinking their marketing strategies to remain viable in an increasingly online world. But\nmany are hopeful that journals will find a way to publish both in print and on the Internet. After all,\n\u201c[t]here\u2019s something special and unique, even luxurious about reading a big, glossy magazine\u2026. Or, in the\nwords of Marie Claire editor Joanna Coles, \u2018As long as people take baths, there will always be a monthly\nmagazine.\u2019\u201d [16]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Print journals are adapting to an increasingly online market by offering web-only features such as blogs,\npodcasts, and daily news updates. Regularly updating websites may help publications remain relevant as\nmore readers turn to the Internet to receive information.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n231 \uf0b7 As more magazines archive back issues on their websites, readers benefit by being able to search for old\narticles and, sometimes, entire editions. Many back issues are offered for free, but some publications\nrequire a subscription fee for this perk.\nEXERCISES\nExplore the website of one of your favorite magazines. Consider how the site maintains the look and feel\nof its print edition, and how the site distinguishes itself from its original print version. Then, answer the\nfollowing writing prompts.\n1.

Although her audio\nengineer father, Ken Caillat, coproduced one of the biggest selling albums of all time, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s\nRumours, Colbie had never considered booking a studio, much less campaigning for a record deal. She\nconsidered her music to be a hobby rather than a career choice. [1] Fast-forward a year later and Caillat\u2019s\ndebut album, Coco, was at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart, on its way to achieving platinum\nstatus. How did an unknown artist from Malibu, California, become a best-selling star in so little time?\nCaillat\u2019s success can be attributed, in part, to the social networking website MySpace.\nHugely popular among teens and young adults in the mid-2000s, MySpace enables people to set up a\npersonal profile on which they can post original music for the public to listen to and comment on. One of\nCaillat\u2019s friends thought that her music merited a wider audience and set up a page on which Caillat could\npost her tunes. Six months later, Caillat was the MySpace website\u2019s top unsigned artist. [2] The site enables\npeople to \u201cfriend\u201d artists or performers whose music they enjoy. As Caillat\u2019s friend count climbed to\n100,000, music labels began to notice. In 2007, she signed with Universal Records and released her debut\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n236 album, Coco. Boosted by the online success of the single \u201cBubbly,\u201d Coco reached No. 5 on the Billboard\nchart and established Caillat as a bona fide pop star. She has since won a Grammy award for \u201cLucky,\u201d her\nduet with Jason Mraz, toured with artists such as the Goo Goo Dolls and John Mayer, and in 2009,\nreleased a second successful album, Breakthrough. The combined sales of Caillat\u2019s first two albums are\nupward of 4 million copies worldwide.\nCaillat\u2019s story highlights one area in which the Internet is changing the face of the music industry.\nAspiring artists no longer need to rely on expensive publicists, recording studios, or contacts within the\nindustry; they can connect directly with fans to sell their music. Social networking sites, like MySpace, and\nvirtual worlds, like Second Life, make it easier for fans to search for new music and easier for artists to\ncommunicate with fans. In fact, MySpace has been so influential that it teamed with several major labels\nto create the MySpace music website. Generating a buzz on social networking sites is sometimes enough\nto achieve fame and stardom. Of course, for every Colbie Caillat, there are thousands of unknown singers\nand bands trying to promote their music online with little or no success. Despite this, it\u2019s clear that social\nnetworking sites have taken some control away from record labels and placed it in the hands of the artists\nthemselves.\nArtists are also using social networking sites to develop a more intimate relationship with fans. In the past\ncouple of years, the Twitter social networking website has become hugely popular among musicians and\nfans alike. The microblogging service enables users to send a tweet message\u2014a short post of 140\ncharacters or less that is displayed on the author\u2019s profile page and delivered to his or her subscribers.\nMusicians such as John Mayer, Alicia Keys, Britney Spears, and Lily Allen regularly post on Twitter,\nproviding their fans with real-time updates about their daily lives and promoting their musical endeavors.\nSocial networking sites are just the latest technological development in the music business. An in-depth\nlook at the history and evolution of popular music throughout the last century will help explain some of\nthe current processes and trends in the industry.\n[1] \u201cColbie Caillat Turns Hobby into Billboard Success, Will Perform at Baylor\u2019s Diadeloso,\u201d Waco Tribune-Herald,\nApril 15, 2010, http://www.wacotrib.com/accesswaco/arts/Colbie-Caillat-turns-hobby-into-Billboard-success-will-\nperform-at-Baylors-Diadeloso.html.\n[2] \u201cColbie Caillat,\u201d ColbieCaillat.com, http://www.colbiecaillat.com/colbie.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n237 6.1\nThe Evolution of Popular Music\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Assess the impact of three technologies that changed the face of the music industry.\n2. Determine the influences and characteristics of each genre of popular music.\n3. Describe the evolution of pop music throughout the last century.\nThe first stirrings of popular or pop music\u2014any genre of music that appeals to a wide audience or\nsubculture\u2014began in the late 19th century, with discoveries by Thomas Edison and Emile Berliner.\nIn 1877, Edison discovered that sound could be reproduced using a strip of tinfoil wrapped around a\nrotating metal cylinder. Edison\u2019s phonograph provided ideas and inspiration for Berliner\u2019s\ngramophone, which used flat discs to record sound. The flat discs were cheaper and easier to produce\nthan were the cylinders they replaced, enabling the mass production of sound recordings. This would\nhave a huge impact on the popular music industry, enabling members of the middle class to purchase\ntechnology that was previously available only to an elite few. Berliner founded the Berliner\nGramophone Company to manufacture his discs, and he encouraged popular operatic singers such as\nEnrico Caruso and Dame Nellie Melba to record their music using his system. Opera singers were the\nstars of the 19th century, and their music generated most of the sheet music sales in the United\nStates. Although the gramophone was an exciting new development, it would take 20 years for disc\nrecordings to rival sheet music in commercial importance. [1]\nIn the late 19th century, the lax copyright laws that existed in the United States at the beginning of\nthe century were strengthened, providing an opportunity for composers, singers, and publishers to\nwork together to earn money by producing as much music as possible. Numerous publishers began\nto emerge in an area of New York that became known as Tin Pan Alley. Allegedly named because the\ncacophony of many pianos being played in the publishers\u2019 demo rooms sounded like people\npounding on tin pans, Tin Pan Alley soon became a prolific source of popular music, with its\npublishers mass-producing sheet music to satisfy the demands of a growing middle class. Whereas\nclassical artists were exalted for their individuality and expected to differ stylistically from other\nclassical artists, popular artists were praised for conforming to the tastes of their intended audience.\nPopular genres expanded from opera to include vaudeville\u2014a form of variety entertainment\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n238 containing short acts featuring singers, dancers, magicians, and comedians that opened new doors\nfor publishers to sell songs popularized by the live shows\u2014and ragtime, a style of piano music\ncharacterized by a syncopated melody.\nFigure 6.2\nFor most of the 20th century, gramophone records were the primary medium used for commercial music\nreproduction.\nThe Tin Pan Alley tradition of song publishing continued throughout the first half of the 20th\ncentury with the show tunes and soothing ballads of Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George\nGershwin, and songwriting teams of the early 1950s, such as Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. By hiring\nsongwriters to compose music based on public demand and mainstream tastes, the Tin Pan Alley\npublishers introduced the concept of popular music as we know it.\nThe Roaring 1920s: Radio versus Records\nIn the 1920s, Tin Pan Alley\u2019s dominance of the popular music industry was threatened by two\ntechnological developments: the advent of electrical recording and the rapid growth of radio.\nDuring the early days of its development, the gramophone was viewed as a scientific novelty that posed\nlittle threat to sheet music because of its poor sound quality. However, as inventors improved various\naspects of the device, the sales of gramophone records began to affect sheet music sales. The Copyright\nAct of 1911 had imposed a royalty on all records of copyrighted musical works to compensate for the loss\nin revenue to composers and authors. This loss became even more prominent during the mid-1920s, when\nimprovements in electrical recording drastically increased sales of gramophones and gramophone\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n239 records. The greater range and sensitivity of the electrical broadcasting microphone revolutionized\ngramophone recording to such an extent that sheet music sales plummeted. From the very beginning, the\nrecord industry faced challenges from new technology.\nComposers and publishers could deal with the losses caused by an increase in gramophone sales because\nof the provisions made in the Copyright Act. However, when radio broadcasting emerged in the early\n1920s, both gramophone sales and sheet-music sales began to suffer. Radio was an affordable medium\nthat enabled listeners to experience events as they took place. Better yet, it offered a wide range of free\nmusic that required none of the musical skills, expensive instruments, or sheet music necessary for\ncreating one\u2019s own music in the home, nor the expense of purchasing records to play on the gramophone.\nThis development was a threat to the entire recording industry, which began to campaign for, and was\nultimately granted, the right to collect license fees from broadcasters. With the license fees in place, the\nrecording industry eventually began to profit from the new technology.\nFigure 6.3\nRadio sales dramatically increased throughout the 1920s because radios were an affordable way\nto listen to free music and live events.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n240 The 1930s: The Rise of Jazz and Blues\nThe ascendance of Tin Pan Alley coincided with the emergence of jazz in New Orleans. An improvisational\nform of music that was primarily instrumental, jazz incorporated a variety of styles, including African\nrhythms, gospel, and blues. Established by New Orleans musicians such as King Oliver and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9,\nLouis Armstrong, who is considered by many to be one of the greatest jazz soloists in history, jazz spread\nalong the Mississippi River by the bands that traveled up and down the river playing on steamboats.\nDuring the Prohibition era in the 1920s and early 1930s, some jazz bands played in illegal speakeasies,\nwhich helped generate the genre\u2019s reputation for being immoral and for threatening the country\u2019s cultural\nvalues. However, jazz became a legitimate form of entertainment during the 1930s, when white orchestras\nbegan to incorporate jazz style into their music. During this time, jazz music began to take on a big band\nstyle, combining elements of ragtime, black spirituals, blues, and European music. Key figures in\ndeveloping the big jazz band included bandleaders Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, and Glenn Miller.\nThese big band orchestras used an arranger to limit improvisation by assigning parts of a piece of music to\nvarious band members. Although improvisation was allowed during solo performances, the format\nbecame more structured, resulting in the swing style of jazz that became popular in the 1930s. As the\ndecade progressed, social attitudes toward racial segregation relaxed and big bands became more racially\nintegrated.\nAt the heart of jazz, the blues was a creation of former black slaves who adapted their African musical\nheritage to the American environment. Dealing with themes of personal adversity, overcoming hard luck,\nand other emotional turmoil, the blues is a 12-bar musical form with a call-and-response format between\nthe singer and his guitar. Originating in the Mississippi Delta, just upriver from New Orleans, blues music\nwas exemplified in the work of W. C. Handy, Ma Rainey, Robert Johnson, and Lead Belly, among others.\nUnlike jazz, the blues did not spread significantly to the Northern states until the late 1930s and 1940s.\nOnce Southern migrants introduced the blues to urban Northern cities, the music developed into\ndistinctive regional styles, ranging from the jazz-oriented Kansas City blues to the swing-based West\nCoast blues. Chicago blues musicians such as Muddy Waters were the first to electrify the blues through\nthe use of electric guitars and to blend urban style with classic Southern blues. The electric guitar, first\nproduced by Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931, changed music by intensifying the sound and creating a louder\nvolume that could cut through noise in bars and nightclubs. [2] By focusing less on shouting, singers could\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n241 focus on conveying more emotion and intimacy in their performances. This electrified form of blues\nprovided the foundations of rock and roll.\nThe 1920s through the 1950s is considered the golden age of radio. During this time, the number of\nlicensed radio stations in the United States exploded from 5 in 1921 to over 600 by 1925. [3] The\nintroduction of radio broadcasting provided a valuable link between urban city centers and small, rural\ntowns. Able to transmit music nationwide, rural radio stations broadcast local music genres that soon\ngained popularity across the country.\nThe 1940s: Technology Progresses\nTechnological advances during the 1940s made it even easier for people to listen to their favorite music\nand for artists to record it. The introduction of the reel-to-reel tape recorder paved the way for several\ninnovations that would transform the music industry. The first commercially available tape recorders\nwere monophonic, meaning that they only had one track on which to record sound onto magnetic tape.\nThis may seem limiting today, but at the time it allowed for exciting innovations. During the 1940s and\n1950s, some musicians\u2014most notably guitarist Les Paul, with his song \u201cLover (When You\u2019re Near Me)\u201d\u2014\nbegan to experiment with overdubbing, in which they played back a previously recorded tape through a\nmixer, blended it with a live performance, and recorded the composite signal onto a second tape recorder.\nBy the time four-track and eight-track recorders became readily available in the 1960s, musicians no\nlonger had to play together in the same room; they could record each of their individual parts and\ncombine them into a finished recording.\nFigure 6.5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n242 Reel-to-reel tape recorders and magnetic tape not only helped artists experiment with overdubbing, but they also\nwere a compact method for reproducing and preserving audio.\nWhile the reel-to-reel recorders were in the early stages of development, families listened to records on\ntheir gramophones. The 78 revolutions per minute (rpm) disc had been the accepted recording medium\nfor many years despite the necessity of changing the disc every 5 minutes. In 1948, Columbia Records\nperfected the 12-inch 33 rpm long-playing (LP) disc, which could play up to 25 minutes per side and had a\nlower level of surface noise than the earlier (and highly breakable) shellac discs. [4] The 33 rpm discs\nbecame the standard form for full albums and would dominate the recorded music industry until the\nadvent of the compact disc (CD).\nDuring the 1940s, a mutually beneficial alliance between sound recording and radio existed. Artists such\nas Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald profited from radio exposure. Until this time, music had primarily\nbeen recorded for adults, but the popularity of Sinatra and his contemporaries revealed an entirely\nuntapped market: teenagers. The postwar boom of the 1930s and early 1940s provided many teenagers\nspending money for records. Radio airplay helped to promote and sell records and the recording artists\nthemselves, which in turn stabilized the recording industry. The near riots caused by the appearance of\nNew Jersey crooner Frank Sinatra in concert paved the way for mass hysteria among Elvis Presley and\nBeatles fans during the rock and roll era.\nThe 1950s: The Advent of Rock and Roll\nNew technology continued to develop in the 1950s with the introduction of television. The new medium\nspread rapidly, primarily because of cheaper mass-production costs and war-related improvements in\ntechnology. In 1948, only 1 percent of America\u2019s households owned a television; by 1953 this figure had\nrisen to nearly 50 percent, and by 1978 nearly every home in the United States owned a television. [5] The\nintroduction of television into people\u2019s homes threatened the existence of the radio industry. The radio\nindustry adapted by focusing on music, joining forces with the recording industry to survive. In an effort\nto do so, it became somewhat of a promotional tool. Stations became more dependent on recorded music\nto fill airtime, and in 1955 the Top 40 format was born. Playlists for radio stations were based on\npopularity (usually the Billboard Top 40 singles chart), and a popular song might be played as many as 30\nor 40 times a day. Radio stations began to influence record sales, which resulted in increased competition\nfor spots on the playlist. This ultimately resulted in payola\u2014the illegal practice of receiving payment from\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n243 a record company for broadcasting a particular song on the radio. The payola scandal came to a head in\nthe 1960s, when Cleveland, Ohio, DJ Alan Freed and 8 other disc jockeys were accused of taking money\nfor airplay. Following Freed\u2019s trial, an antipayola statute was passed, making payola a misdemeanor\ncrime.\nTechnology wasn\u2019t the only revolution that took place during the 1950s. The urban Chicago blues typified\nby artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, and B. B. King surged in popularity among white and\nblack teenagers alike. Marketed under the name rhythm and blues, or R&B, the sexually suggestive lyrics\nin songs such as \u201cSexy Ways\u201d and \u201cSixty Minute Man\u201d and the electrified guitar and wailing harmonica\nsounds appealed to young listeners. At the time, R&B records were classified as \u201crace music\u201d and their\nsales were segregated from the white music records tracked on the pop charts. [6] Nonetheless, there was a\nconsiderable amount of crossover among audiences. In 1952, the Dolphin\u2019s of Hollywood record store in\nLos Angeles, which specialized in R&B music, noted that 40 percent of its sales were to white\nindividuals. [7]\nAlthough banned from some stations, others embraced the popular new music. In 1951, Freed started a\nlate-night R&B show called The Moondog Rock & Roll House Party and began referring to the music he\nplayed as rock and roll. [8]Taking its name from a blues slang term for sex, the music obtained instant\nnotoriety, gaining widespread support among teenage music fans and widespread dislike among the older\ngeneration. [9] Frenetic showmen Little Richard and Chuck Berry were early pioneers of rock and roll, and\ntheir wild stage performances became characteristic of the genre. As the integration of white and black\nindividuals progressed in the 1950s with the repeal of segregation laws and the initiation of the civil rights\nmovement, aspects of black cultures, including music, became more widely accepted by many white\nindividuals. However, it was the introduction of a white man who sang songs written by black musicians\nthat helped rock and roll really spread across state and racial lines. Elvis Presley, a singer and guitarist,\nthe \u201cKing of Rock and Roll,\u201d further helped make music written by black individuals acceptable to\nmainstream white audiences and also helped popularize rockabilly\u2014a blend of rock and country music\u2014\nwith black audiences during the mid-1950s. Heavily influenced by his rural Southern roots, Presley\ncombined the R&B music of bluesmen B. B. King, John Lee Hooker, and Howlin\u2019 Wolf with the country-\nwestern tradition of Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, and Jimmie Rodgers, and added a touch of gospel. [10] The\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n244 reaction Presley inspired among hordes of adolescent girls\u2014screaming, crying, rioting\u2014solidified his\nreputation as the first true rock and roll icon.\nThe 1960s: Rock and Roll Branches Out From R&B\nPrior to 1964, rock and roll was primarily an American export. Although U.S. artists frequently reached\nthe top of the charts overseas, few European artists achieved success on this side of the Atlantic. This\nsituation changed almost overnight, with the arrival of British pop phenomenon the Beatles. Combining\nelements of skiffle\u2014a type of music played on rudimentary instruments, such as banjos, guitars, or\nhomemade instruments\u2014doo-wop, and soul, the four mop-haired musicians from Liverpool, England,\ncreated a genre of music known as Merseybeat, named after the River Mersey. The Beatles\u2019 genial\npersonalities and catchy pop tunes made them an instant success in the United States, and their\npopularity was heightened by several appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. When the Beatles arrived in\nNew York in 1964, they were met by hundreds of reporters and police officers and thousands of fans.\nTheir appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show a few days later was the largest audience for an American\ntelevision program, with approximately one in three Americans (74 million) tuning in. [11] Beatlemania\u2014\nthe term coined to describe fans\u2019 wildly enthusiastic reaction to the band\u2014extended to other British\nbands, and by the mid-1960s, the Kinks, the Zombies, the Animals, Herman\u2019s Hermits, and the Rolling\nStones were all making appearances on the U.S. charts. The Rolling Stones\u2019s urban rock sound steered\naway from pop music and remained more true to the bluesy, R&B roots of rock and roll. During their first\nappearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the Stones were lewd and vulgar, prompting host Ed Sullivan to\ndenounce their behavior (although he privately acknowledged that the band had received the most\nenthusiastic applause he had ever seen). [12] The British Invasion transformed rock and roll into the all-\nencompassing genre of rock, sending future performers in two different directions: the melodic, poppy\nsounds of the Beatles, on the one hand, and the gritty, high-volume power rock of the Stones on the other.\nThe branching out of rock and roll continued in several other directions throughout the 1960s. Surf music,\nembodied by artists such as the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, and Dick Dale, celebrated the aspects of youth\nculture in California. With their twanging electric guitars and glossy harmonies, the surf groups sang of\ngirls, beaches, and convertible cars cruising along the West Coast. In Detroit, some black performers were\ndeveloping a sound that would have crossover appeal with both black and white audiences. Combining\nR&B, pop, gospel, and blues into a genre known as soul, vocalists such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n245 Otis Redding, and Wilson Pickett sang about the lives of black Americans. Producer and songwriter Berry\nGordy Jr. developed soul music through the creation of his Motown label, which would become one of the\nmost successful businesses owned by a black individual in American history. [13]Capitalizing on the 1960s\ngirl-group craze, Gordy produced hits by the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, and, most\nsuccessfully, Diana Ross and the Supremes. For his bands, he created a slick, polished image designed to\nappeal to the American mainstream.\nIn the late 1960s, supporters of the civil rights movement\u2014along with feminists, environmentalists, and\nVietnam War protesters\u2014were gravitating toward folkmusic, which would become the sound of social\nactivism. Broadly referring to music that is passed down orally through the generations, folk music\nretained an unpolished, amateur quality that inspired participation and social awareness. Carrying on the\nlegacy of the 1930s labor activist Woody Guthrie, singer-songwriters such as Joan Baez; Peter, Paul, and\nMary; and Bob Dylan sang social protest songs about civil rights, discrimination against black Americans,\nand the Cuban Missile Crisis. Having earned himself a reputation as a political spokesperson, Dylan was\nlambasted by traditional folk fans for playing an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival.\nHowever, his attempt to reach a broader crowd inspired the folk rock genre, pioneered by the Los Angeles\nband the Byrds [14]. Even though many fans questioned his decision to go electric, Dylan\u2019s poetic and\npolitically charged lyrics were still influential, inspiring groups like the Beatles and the Animals. Protest\nmusic in the 1960s was closely aligned with the hippie culture, in which some viewed taking drugs as a\nform of personal expression and free speech. Artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, the\nGrateful Dead, and the Doors believed that the listening experience could be enhanced using mind-\naltering drugs. [15] This spirit of freedom and protest culminated in the infamous Woodstock festival in the\nsummer of 1969, although the subsequent deaths of many of its stars from drug overdoses cast a shadow\nover the psychedelic culture.\nThe 1970s: From Glam Rock to Punk\nAfter the Vietnam War ended, college students began to settle down and focus on careers and families.\nFor some selfish views took the place of concern with social issues and political activism, causing writer\nTom Wolfe to label the 1970s the \u201cme\u201d decade. [16] Musically, this ideological shift resulted in the creation\nof glam rock, an extravagant, self-indulgent form of rock that incorporated flamboyant costumes, heavy\nmakeup, and elements of hard rock and pop. A primarily British phenomenon, glam rock was popularized\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n246 by acts such as Slade, David Bowie, the Sweet, Elton John, and Gary Glitter. It proved to be a precursor\nfor the punk movement in the late 1970s. Equally flamboyant, but rising out of a more electronic\nsound, disco also emerged in the 1970s. Popular disco artists included KC and the Sunshine Band, Gloria\nGaynor, the Bee Gees, and Donna Summer, who helped to pioneer its electronic sound. Boosted by the\nsuccess of 1977 film Saturday Night Fever, disco\u2019s popularity spread across the country. Records were\ncreated especially for discos, and record companies churned out tunes that became huge hits on the dance\nfloor.\nReacting against the commercialism of disco and corporate rock, punk artists created a minimalist, angry\nform of rock that returned to rock and roll basics: simple chord structures, catchy tunes, and politically\nmotivated lyrics. Like the skiffle bands of the 1950s, the appeal of punk rock was that anyone with basic\nmusical skills could participate. The punk rock movement emerged out of CBGB, a small bar in New York\nCity that featured bands such as Television, Blondie, and the Ramones. Never a huge commercial success\nin the United States, punk rock exploded in the United Kingdom, where high unemployment rates and\nclass divisions had created angry, disenfranchised youths. [17] The Sex Pistols, fronted by Johnny Rotten,\ndeveloped an aggressive, pumping sound that appealed to a rebellious generation of listeners, although\nthe band was disparaged by many critics at the time. In 1976, British music paper Melody\nMaker complained that \u201cthe Sex Pistols do as much for music as World War II did for the cause of\npeace.\u201d [18] Punk bands began to abandon their sound in the late 1970s, when the punk style became\nassimilated into the rock mainstream.\nThe 1980s: The Hip-Hop Generation\nWhereas many British youths expressed their displeasure through punk music, many disenfranchised\nblack American youths in the 1980s turned to hip-hop\u2014a term for the urban culture that includes break\ndancing, graffiti art, and the musical techniques of rapping, sampling, and scratching records. Reacting\nagainst the extravagance of disco, many poor urban rappers developed their new street culture by\nadopting a casual image consisting of T-shirts and sportswear, developing a language that reflected the\neveryday concerns of the people in low-income, urban areas, and by embracing the low-budget visual art\nform of graffiti. They described their new culture as hip-hop, after a common phrase chanted at dance\nparties in New York\u2019s Bronx borough.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n247 The hip-hop genre first became popular among black youths in the late 1970s, when record spinners in\nthe Bronx and Harlem started to play short fragments of songs rather than the entire track (known as\nsampling). [19] Early hip-hop artists sampled all types of music, like funk, soul, and jazz, later adding\nspecial effects to the samples and experimenting with techniques such as rotating or scratching records\nback and forth to create a rhythmic pattern. For example, Kool Moe Dee\u2019s track \u201cHow Ya Like Me Now\u201d\nincludes samples from James Brown\u2019s classic funk song \u201cPapa\u2019s Got a Brand New Bag.\u201d The DJs would\noften add short raps to their music to let audiences know who was playing the records, a trend that grew\nmore elaborate over time to include entire spoken verses. Artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the\nFurious Five added political and social commentary on the realities of life in low-income, high-crime\nareas\u2014a trend that would continue with later rappers such as Public Enemy and Ice-T.\nIn the early 1980s, a second wave of rap artists brought inner-city rap to American youths by mixing it\nwith hard guitar rock. Pioneered by groups such as Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys, the new music\nappealed to black and white audiences alike. Another subgenre that emerged was gangsta rap, a\ncontroversial brand of hip-hop epitomized by West Coast rappers such as Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur.\nHighlighting violence and gang warfare, gangsta rappers faced accusations that they created violence in\ninner cities\u2014an argument that gained momentum with the East Coast\u2013West Coast rivalry of the 1990s.\nThe 1990s: New Developments in Hip-Hop, Rock, and Pop\nHip-hop and gangsta rap maintained their popularity in the early 1990s with artists such as Tupac\nShakur, the Notorious B.I.G., Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg at the top of the charts. West\nCoast rappers such as Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg favored gangsta rap, while East Coast rappers, like\nthe Notorious B.I.G. and Sean Combs, stuck to a traditional hip-hop style. The rivalry culminated with the\nmurders of Shakur in 1996 and B.I.G. in 1997.\nAlong with hip-hop and gangsta rap, alternative rock came to the forefront in the 1990s with grunge. The\ngrunge scene emerged in the mid-1980s in the Seattle area of Washington State. Inspired by hardcore\npunk and heavy metal, this subgenre of rock was so-called because of its messy, sludgy, distorted guitar\nsound, the disheveled appearance of its pioneers, and the disaffected nature of the artists. Initially\nachieving limited success with Seattle band Soundgarden, Seattle independent label Sub Pop became\nmore prominent when it signed another local band, Nirvana. Fronted by vocalist and guitarist Kurt\nCobain, Nirvana came to be identified with Generation X\u2014the post\u2013baby boom generation, many of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n248 whom came from broken families and experienced violence both on television and in real life. Nirvana\u2019s\nangst-filled lyrics spoke to many members of Generation X, launching the band into the mainstream.\nIronically, Cobain was uncomfortable and miserable, and he would eventually commit suicide in 1994.\nNirvana\u2019s success paved the way for other alternative rock bands, including Green Day, Pearl Jam, and\nNine Inch Nails. More recently, alternative rock has fragmented into even more specific subgenres.\nBy the end of the 1990s, mainstream tastes leaned toward pop music. A plethora of boy bands, girl bands,\nand pop starlets emerged, sometimes evolving from gospel choir groups, but more often than not created\nby talent scouts. The groups were aggressively marketed to teen audiences. Popular bands included the\nBackstreet Boys, \u2019N Sync, and the Spice Girls. Meanwhile, individual pop acts from the MTV generation\nsuch as Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Prince continued to generate hits.\nThe 2000s: Pop Stays Strong as Hip-Hop Overtakes Rock in Popularity\nThe 2000s began right where the 1990s left off, with young singers such as Christina Aguilera and\nDestiny\u2019s Child ruling the pop charts. Pop music stayed strong throughout the decade with Gwen Stefani,\nMariah Carey, Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, and Lady Gaga achieving mainstream success. By the end of the\ndecade, country artists, like Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, transitioned from country stars to bona\nfide pop stars. While rock music started the decade strong, by the end of the 2000s, rock\u2019s presence in\nmainstream music had waned, with a few exceptions such as Nickelback, Linkin Park, and Green Day.\nUnlike rock music, hip-hop maintained its popularity, with more commercial, polished artists such as\nKanye West, Jay-Z, Lupe Fiasco, and OutKast achieving enormous success. While some gangsta rappers\nfrom the 1990s\u2014like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg\u2014softened their images, other rappers\u2014such as 50 Cent and\nEminem\u2014continued to project a tough image and to use violent lyrics. An alternative style of hip-hop\nemerged in the 2000s that infused positive messages and an element of social conscience to the music\nthat was missing from early hip-hop tracks. Artists such as Common, Mos Def, and the Black Eyed Peas\nfound success even though they didn\u2019t represent traditional stereotypes of hip-hop.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Popular music as we know it originated out of the Tin Pan Alley tradition that emerged at the beginning of\nthe 20th century in which composers, singers, and publishers worked together to create hit songs. The\nprimary difference between popular music and classical music is that, whereas classical artists were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n249 exalted for their individuality and expected to differ stylistically from other classical composers, popular\nartists were praised for conforming to the tastes of their intended audience.\n\uf0b7 Technological developments played a vital role in bringing popular music to people\u2019s homes. The\ninvention of the phonograph and gramophone in the late 19th century enabled the reproduction and\nmass distribution of sound recordings for the first time. The invention of the reel-to-reel tape recorder\nand the development of vinyl records in the 1940s drastically improved this process. The postwar\nprevalence of radio hugely impacted popular music, with radio airplay of popular songs promoting record\nsales.\n\uf0b7 Throughout the last century, tastes in popular music have evolved to encompass a wide variety of styles.\nPeople who enjoyed opera at the turn of the 20th century saw the rise of vaudeville and ragtime in the\nTin Pan Alley era. Jazz and blues emerged from New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta during the 1930s,\nand musical styles adapted as people migrated to Northern urban areas. Rhythm and blues laid the\ngroundwork for rock and roll that shook up popular music in the 1950s. Popular music diversified in the\n1960s to encompass surf, folk, and soul music. In the 1970s, glam rock and disco became popular, and\npunk rockers revolted against the excesses of these styles. Hip-hop dominated the 1980s, and its\npopularity continued into the 1990s and 2000s. Pop was also successful in the 1990s and 2000s, while\nmainstream interest in alternative rock waned at the end of the 2000s.\nEXERCISE\nChoose a decade between 1900 and 2010. Research a technological development that took place during\nthis time that influenced pop music\u2014for example, the development of the electric guitar and its influence\non rock and roll.

Identify ways in which culture and music have influenced each other.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n251 The tightknit relationship between music and culture is almost impossible to overstate. For example,\npolicies on immigration, war, and the legal system can influence artists and the type of music they\ncreate and distribute. Music may then influence cultural perceptions about race, morality, and\ngender that can, in turn, influence the way people feel about those policies.\nCultural Influences on Music\nThe evolution of popular music in the United States in the 20th century was shaped by a myriad of\ncultural influences. Rapidly shifting demographics brought previously independent cultures into contact\nand also created new cultures and subcultures, and music evolved to reflect these changes. Among the\nmost important cultural influences on music are migration, the evolution of youth culture, and racial\nintegration.\nMigration\nOne of the major cultural influences on the popular music industry over the past century is migration. In\n1910, 89 percent of black Americans still lived in the South, most of them in rural farming areas. [1] Three\nyears later, a series of disastrous events devastated the cotton industry. World cotton prices plummeted, a\nboll weevil beetle infestation destroyed large areas of crops, and in 1915, flooding destroyed many of the\nhouses and crops of farmers along the Mississippi River. Already suffering from the restrictive \u201cJim Crow\u201d\nlaws that segregated schools, restaurants, hotels, and hospitals, black sharecroppers began to look to the\nNorth for a more prosperous lifestyle. Northern states were enjoying an economic boom as a result of an\nincreased demand for industrial goods because of the war in Europe. They were also in need of labor\nbecause the war had slowed the rate of foreign immigration to Northern cities. Between 1915 and 1920, as\nmany as 1 million black individuals moved to Northern cities in search of jobs, closely followed by another\nmillion throughout the following decade. [2] The mass exodus of black farmers from the South became\nknown as the Great Migration, and by 1960, 75 percent of all Black Americans lived in cities. [3] The Great\nMigration had a huge impact on political, economic, and cultural life in the North, and popular music\nreflected this cultural change.\nFigure 6.13\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n252 During the Great Migration, the 12 states in blue had the largest population growth of black\nindividuals, while the states in red had the 10 largest net losses. [4]\nSome of the black individuals who moved to Northern cities came from the Mississippi Delta, home of the\nblues. The most popular destination was Chicago. Delta-born pianist Eddie Boyd later told Living\nBlues magazine, \u201cI thought of coming to Chicago where I could get away from some of that racism and\nwhere I would have an opportunity to, well, do something with my talent\u2026. It wasn\u2019t peaches and cream,\nman, but it was a hell of a lot better than down there where I was born.\u201d [5] At first, the migrants brought\ntheir style of country blues to the city. Characterized by the guitar and the harmonica, the Delta blues was\nidentified by its rhythmic structure and strong vocals. Migrant musicians were heavily influenced by Delta\nblues musicians such as Charley Patton and legendary guitarist Robert Johnson. However, as the urban\nsetting began to influence the migrants\u2019 style, they started to record a hybrid of blues, vaudeville, and\nswing, including the boogie-woogie and rolling-bass piano. Mississippi-born guitarist Muddy Waters, who\nmoved to Chicago in the early 1940s, revolutionized the blues by combining his Delta roots with an\nelectric guitar and amplifier. He did so partly out of necessity, since he could barely make himself heard in\ncrowded Chicago clubs with an acoustic guitar. [6]Waters\u2019s style was peppier and more buoyant than the\nsullen country blues. His plugged-in electric blues became the hallmark of the Chicago blues style,\ninfluencing countless other musicians and creating the underpinnings of rock and roll. Other migrant\nbluesmen helped to create regional variations of the blues all around the country, including John Lee\nHooker in Detroit, Michigan, and T-Bone Walker in Los Angeles, California.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n253 Youth Culture\nPrior to 1945, most music was created with adults in mind, and teenage musical tastes were barely a\nconsideration. Young adults had few freedoms\u2014most males were expected to join the military or get a job\nto support their fledgling families, while most females were expected to marry young and have children.\nFew young adults attended college, and personal freedom was limited. Following World War II, this\nsituation changed drastically. A booming economy helped create an American middle class, which created\nan opening for a youth consumer culture. Unsavory memories of the war discouraged some parents from\nforcing their children into the military, and many emphasized enjoying life and having a good time. As a\nresult, teenagers found they had a lot more freedom. This new liberalized culture allowed teenagers to\nmake decisions for themselves, and, for the first time, many had the financial means to do so. Whereas\nmany adults enjoyed the traditional sounds of Tin Pan Alley, teens were beginning to listen to rhythm and\nblues songs played by radio disc jockeys such as Alan Freed. Increased racial integration within the\nyounger generation made them more accepting of black musicians and their music, which was considered\n\u201ccool,\u201d and provided a welcome escape from the daunting political and social tension caused by Cold War\nanxieties. The wide availability of radios, juke boxes, and 45 rpm records exposed this new style of rock\nand roll music to a broad teenage audience.\nOnce teenagers had the buying power to influence record sales, record companies began to notice.\nBetween 1950 and 1959, record sales in the United States skyrocketed from $189 million to nearly $600\nmillion. [7] The 45 rpm vinyl records that were introduced in the late 1940s were an affordable option for\nteens with allowances. Dick Clark, a radio presenter in Philadelphia, soon tuned in to the new teenage\ntastes. Sensing an opportunity to tap in to a potentially lucrative market, he acquired enough advertising\nsupport to turn local hit music telecast Bandstand into a national television phenomenon.\nThe result was the launch of American Bandstand in 1957, a music television show that featured a group\nof teenagers dancing to current hit records. The show\u2019s popularity prompted record producers to create a\nlegion of rock and roll acts specifically designed to appeal to a teenage audience, including Fabian and\nFrankie Avalon. [8] During its almost 40-year run, American Bandstand was a prominent influence on\nteenage fashions and musical tastes and, in turn, reflected the contemporary youth culture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n254 Racial Integration\nFollowing the Great Migration, racial tensions increased in Northern cities. Whereas many Northerners\nhad previously been unconcerned with the issue of race relations in the South, they found themselves\nconfronted with the very real issue of having to compete for jobs with black migrant workers. Black\nworkers found themselves pushed into undesirable neighborhoods, often living in crowded, unsanitary\nslums where they were charged exorbitant rates by unscrupulous landlords. During the 1940s, racial\ntensions boiled over into race riots, most notably in Detroit. The city\u2019s 1943 riot caused the deaths of 34\npeople, 25 of whom were black. [9]\nFrustrated with inequalities in the legal system that distinguished black and white individuals, members\nof the civil rights movement pushed for racial equality. In 1948, an executive order granted by President\nHarry Truman integrated the military. The move toward equality gained further momentum in 1954, with\nthe U.S. Supreme Court decision to end segregation in public schools in the landmark case Brown v.\nBoard of Education. The civil rights movement escalated throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, aided\nby highly publicized events such as Rosa Parks\u2019s refusal to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger\nin Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955. In 1964, Congress passed the most sweeping civil rights legislation\nsince the Civil War, forbidding discrimination in public places and authorizing financial aid to enable\nschool desegregation.\nAlthough racist attitudes did not change overnight, the cultural changes brought on by the civil rights\nmovement laid the groundwork for the creation of an integrated society. The Motown sound developed by\nBerry Gordy Jr. in the 1960s both reflected and furthered this change. Gordy believed that by coaching\ntalented but unpolished black artists, he could make them acceptable to mainstream culture. He hired a\nprofessional to head an in-house finishing school, teaching his acts how to move gracefully, speak politely,\nand use proper posture. [10] Gordy\u2019s commercial success with gospel-based pop acts such as the Supremes,\nthe Temptations, the Four Tops, and Martha and the Vandellas reflected the extent of racial integration in\nthe mainstream music industry. Gordy\u2019s most successful act, the Supremes, achieved 12 No. 1 singles on\nthe Billboard Hot 100 chart.\nMusical Influences on Culture\nEven though pop music is frequently characterized as a negative influence on society, particularly with\nrespect to youth culture, it also has positive effects on culture. Many artists in the 1950s and 1960s pushed\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n255 the boundaries of socially acceptable behavior with sexually charged movements and androgynous\nappearances. Without these precedents, acts like the Rolling Stones or David Bowie may have never made\nthe transition into mainstream success.\nOn the other hand, over the past 50 years, critics have blamed rock and roll for juvenile delinquency,\nheavy metal for increased teenage aggression, and gangsta rap for a rise in gang warfare among young\nurban males. One recent study claimed that youths who listen to music with sexually explicit lyrics were\nmore likely to have sex at an early age, stating that exposure to lots of sexually degrading music gives\nteens \u201ca specific message about sex.\u201d [11] In addition to its effects on youth culture, popular music has\ncontributed to shifting cultural values regarding race, morality, and gender.\nRace\nAs the music of Chuck Berry and Little Richard gained popularity among white teens in the United States\nduring the 1950s, most of the new rock acts were signed to independent labels, and larger companies such\nas RCA were losing their share of the market.\nTo capitalize on the public\u2019s enthusiasm for rock and roll and to prevent the loss of further potential\nprofits, big record companies signed white artists to cover the songs of black artists. The songs were often\ncensored for the mainstream market by the removal of any lyrics that referenced sex, alcohol, or drugs.\nPat Boone was the most successful cover artist of the era, releasing songs originally sung by artists such as\nFats Domino, the El Dorados, Little Richard, and Big Joe Turner. Releasing a cover of a black performer\u2019s\nsong by a white performer was known as hijacking a hit, and this practice usually left black artists signed\nto independent labels broke. Because large companies such as RCA could widely promote and distribute\ntheir records\u2014six of Boone\u2019s recordings reached the No. 1 spot on the Billboard chart\u2014their records\nfrequently outsold the original versions. Many white artists and producers would also take writing credit\nfor the songs they covered and would buy the rights to songs from black writers without giving\nthem royalties or songwriting credit. This practice fueled racism within the music industry. Independent\nrecord producer Danny Kessler of Okeh Records said, \u201cThe odds for a black record to crack through were\nslim. If the black record began to happen, the chances were that a white artist would cover\u2014and the big\nstations would play the white records\u2026. There was a color line, and it wasn\u2019t easy to cross.\u201d [12]\nAlthough cover artists profited from the work of black R&B singers, occasionally they also helped to\npromote the original recordings. Many teenagers who heard covers on mainstream radio stations sought\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n256 out the original artists\u2019 versions, increasing sales and prompting Little Richard to refer to Pat Boone as\n\u201cthe man who made me a millionaire.\u201d [13] Benefiting from covers also worked both ways. In 1962, soul\nsinger Ray Charles covered Don Gibson\u2019s hit \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Stop Loving You,\u201d which became a hit on\ncountry and western charts and furthered mainstream acceptance of black musicians. Other black artists\nto cover hits by white performers included Otis Redding, who performed the Rolling Stones hit\n\u201cSatisfaction,\u201d and Jimi Hendrix, who covered Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cAll Along the Watchtower.\u201d\nHijacking Hits\nReleasing cover versions of hit songs was fairly standard practice before the 1950s because it was\nadvantageous for songwriters and producers to have as many artists as possible sing their records to\nmaximize royalties. Several versions of the same song often appeared in the music charts at the same\ntime. However, the practice acquired racial connotations during the 1950s when larger music labels\nhijacked R&B hits, using their financial strength to promote the cover version at the expense of the\noriginal recording, which often exploited black talent. As a result, many 1950s R&B artists lost out\non royalties.\nTwo contemporary black performers who were victims of this practice were R&B singer LaVern Baker and\nblues singer Arthur \u201cBig Boy\u201d Crudup. Baker, who was signed with then small-time label Atlantic Records,\nhad been promoted as a pop singer. Because her songs appealed to mainstream audiences, they were ideal\nfor covering, and industry giant Mercury Records took full advantage of this. When Baker released her\n1955 hit \u201cTweedle Dee,\u201d Mercury immediately put out its own version, a note-for-note cover sung by white\npop singer Georgia Gibbs. Atlantic could not match Mercury\u2019s marketing budget, and Gibbs\u2019 version\noutsold Baker\u2019s recording, causing her to lose an estimated $15,000 in royalties. [14]\nAround the same time, Arthur Crudup was producing hits such as \u201cSo Glad You\u2019re Mine,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Been\nFoolin\u2019 You,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s All Right Mama,\u201d and \u201cMy Baby Left Me,\u201d which were subsequently released by\nperformers such as Elvis Presley, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Rod Stewart for huge financial gain,\nCrudup\u2019s songs made everybody rich\u2014except him. This realization caused him to quit playing altogether\nin the late 1950s. A later attempt to collect back royalties was unsuccessful. [15] Baker filed a lawsuit in an\nattempt to revise the Copyright Act of 1909, making it illegal to copy an arrangement verbatim without\npermission. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and Gibbs continued to cover Baker\u2019s songs. [16]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n257 Morality\nWhen Elvis Presley burst onto the rock and roll scene in the mid-1950s, any conservative parents of\nteenagers all over the United States were horrified. With his gyrating hips and sexually suggestive body\nmovements, Presley was viewed as a threat to the moral well-being of young women. Television critics\ndenounced his performances as vulgar, and on a 1956 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, cameras\nfilmed him only from the waist up. One critic for the New York Daily News wrote that popular music \u201chas\nreached its lowest depths in the \u2018grunt and groin\u2019 antics of one Elvis Presley.\u201d [17] Despite the critics\u2019\nopinions, Presley immediately gained a fan base among teenage audiences, particularly adolescent girls,\nwho frequently broke into hysterics at his concerts. Rather than tone down his act, Presley defended his\nmovements as manifestations of the music\u2019s rhythm and beat and continued to gyrate on stage. Liberated\nfrom the constraints imposed by morality watchdogs, Presley set a precedent for future rock and roll\nperformers and marked a major transition in popular culture.\nIn addition to decrying raunchy onstage performances by rock and roll artists, moralists in the\nconservative Eisenhower era objected to the sexually suggestive lyrics found in original rock and roll\nsongs. Big Joe Turner\u2019s version of \u201cShake, Rattle, and Roll\u201d used sexual phrases and referred to the\nbedroom, while Little Richard\u2019s original version of \u201cTutti Frutti\u201d contained the phrase \u201ctutti frutti, loose\nbooty.\u201d [18] Although many of these lyrics were sanitized for mainstream white audiences when they were\nrereleased as cover versions, the idea that rock and roll was a threat to morality had been firmly\nimplanted in many people\u2019s minds.\nIronically, many of the controversial key figures in the rock and roll era came from extremely religious\nbackgrounds. Presley was a member of the evangelical First Assembly of God Church, where he acquired\nhis love of gospel music. [19]Similarly, Ray Charles soaked up gospel influences from his local Baptist\nchurch.[20] Jerry Lee Lewis came from a strict Christian background and often struggled to reconcile his\nreligious beliefs with the moral implications of the music he created. During a recording session in 1957,\nLewis argued with manager Sam Phillips that the hit song \u201cGreat Balls of Fire\u201d was too \u201csinful\u201d for him to\nrecord.[21] The religious backgrounds of the rock and roll pioneers both influenced and challenged moral\nnorms. When Ray Charles recorded \u201cI Got a Woman\u201d in 1955, he reworded the gospel tune \u201cJesus Is All\nthe World to Me,\u201d drawing criticism that the song was sacrilegious. Despite the objections, Charles\u2019s style\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n258 caught on with other musicians, and his experimentation with merging gospel and R&B resulted in the\nbirth of soul music.\nGender\nWhile Presley was revolutionizing people\u2019s notions of sexual freedom and expression, other performers\nwere changing cultural norms regarding gender identity. Dressed in flamboyant clothing with a\npompadour hairstyle and makeup, Little Richard was an exotic, androgynous performer who blurred\ntraditional gender boundaries and shocked 1950s audiences with his blatant campiness. Between his wild\nonstage antics, bisexual tendencies, and love of post-concert orgies, the self-proclaimed \u201cKing and Queen\nof Rock and Roll\u201d challenged many social conventions of the time. [22] Little Richard\u2019s flamboyant, gender-\nbending appearance was so outrageous that it was not taken seriously during the 1950s\u2014he was\nconsidered an entertainer whose androgynous look bore no relevance to the real world. However, Richard\npaved the way for future entertainers to shift cultural perceptions of gender. Later musicians such as\nDavid Bowie, Prince, and Boy George adopted his outrageous style, frequently appearing on stage wearing\nglittery costumes and heavy makeup. The popularity of these 1970s and 1980s pop idols, along with other\ngender-bending performers such as Annie Lennox and Michael Jackson, helped make androgyny more\nacceptable in mainstream society.\nFigure 6.17\nLittle Richard. Gender-bending performers such as Little Richard, David Bowie, Boy George, and\nPrince helped to change social attitudes toward androgyny.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n259 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The relationship between music and culture is reciprocal. Cultural influences on music include factors\nsuch as migration, youth culture, and racial integration. Musical influences on culture include factors such\nas racism within the music industry, content of particular genres of music that push conventional ideas of\nmorality, and the physical appearance of individual performers.\n\uf0b7 The mass migration of Southern black individuals to urban areas during the early 20th century brought\nthe blues to the North. Influenced by their new urban setting, migrant musicians incorporated new styles,\nincluding vaudeville and swing, into their music. Muddy Waters began playing electric guitar to make\nhimself heard in the Chicago clubs and inadvertently created a new style known as Chicago blues.\n\uf0b7 Young people in the 1950s had increased financial and personal freedom, giving them the power to\ninfluence record sales. Record companies began marketing rock and roll records specifically to teens, and\nthe popularity of the new genre was enhanced by radio airplay and TV shows such as American\nBandstand.\n\uf0b7 The civil rights movement helped bring about desegregation in the 1950s. Although racial tensions\npersisted and race riots occurred in several Northern cities, racial integration gradually took place. The\nmove toward integration was furthered and reflected by the Motown sound created by Berry Gordy Jr.\nMotown had crossover appeal among black and white audiences, illustrated by the mainstream success\nof groups such as the Supremes.\n\uf0b7 Large record companies fueled racism in the music industry by hijacking the hits of black performers and\nreleasing censored cover versions by white artists. The practice cost black artists royalties. Although many\nperformers were angered by the trend, some believed it helped popularize their original recordings.\n\uf0b7 Rock and roll music was denounced for its negative impact on morality. Elvis Presley\u2019s \u201cvulgar\u201d onstage\ngyrations outraged critics in the conservative Eisenhower era. Sexually suggestive song lyrics were also\nheld responsible by many for a decline in moral values, although they were often censored cover\nversions.\n\uf0b7 Gender-bending performers such as Little Richard, David Bowie, and Annie Lennox helped normalize\nandrogyny in American culture.\nEXERCISE\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n260 Choose a genre of popular music from the last century.

Assess the influence of the major record labels in the music industry.\n2. Describe the role played by independent labels in the music industry.\nIn Weezer\u2019s 2008 song \u201cPork and Beans,\u201d vocalist Rivers Cuomo sings, \u201cTimbaland knows the way to\nreach the top of the charts/Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art.\u201d [1] The lyrics, a reference\nto hip-hop producer Timbaland\u2019s multiple high-profile collaborations, are an angry reaction to a\nmeeting between Cuomo and record executives at the band\u2019s Geffen label. During the meeting, the\nexecutives told the band members they needed to write more commercial material, prompting a\ndefiant (though commercially successful) response. [2] The incident is a reflection of the balance\nbetween commercial success and artistic expression in the music industry. Record labels need artists\nthat inspire the record-buying public, while artists need the financial backing and expertise of record\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n262 labels and their marketing teams. In recent years, tensions between artists and their labels have been\nheightened by the cost-cutting measures that have taken place at many companies due to the impact\nof online file sharing on profits.\nThe Influence of Major Record Labels\nDuring the 1990s, the record industry was booming. Music lovers were busy replacing their cassette tapes\nand vinyl records with CDs, and sales were high. In 1999, the total revenue from music sales and licensing\npeaked at $14.6 billion.[3] Ten years later, record label executives were not as successful. Revenue had\nplunged to $6.3 billion, with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) reporting declining\nrevenue in 9 of the 10 previous years, with album sales dropping an average of 8 percent every\nyear. [4] Why the drastic decline? Experts agree that the primary culprit is the growing popularity of digital\nmusic, which initially began through peer-to-peer file sharing\u2014the process of swapping media files over\nthe Internet\u2014such as the Napster service.\nDespite a massive loss in profits over the past decade, the global music business still comprises a\npowerful oligopoly\u2014a market condition in which a few firms dominate most of an industry\u2019s production\nand distribution. The global reach of these few companies means that they have the promotion and\nmarketing muscle to determine which types of music reach listeners\u2019 ears and which become obsolete.\nEach of the major record labels has a strong infrastructure that oversees every aspect of the music\nbusiness, from production, manufacture, and distribution to marketing and promotion.\nBetween 1950 and 1980, a large number of major record labels and numerous independent labels\ncompeted for a share of the musical pie. Gradually, the larger labels began buying up the independent\nlabels, and then started trying to purchase each other. By the late 1990s, only six major labels remained:\nWarner, Universal, Sony, BMG, EMI, and Polygram. In 1998, Universal acquired Polygram, and 6 years\nlater Sony and BMG merged. Sony later bought out BMG to obtain sole ownership of the company.\nCurrently, the music industry is dominated by the so-called Big Four: Sony Music Entertainment, EMI,\nUniversal Music Group, and Warner Music Group. The Big Four control over 85 percent of the U.S.\nrecording music industry. [5] shows a graph of the current distribution of market share.\nFigure 6.18\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n263 Four major music labels control over 85 percent of the U.S. recording music industry.\nSony Music Entertainment\nIn 2004, Japanese-owned Sony Music Entertainment (part of Sony) and German-owned BMG\nEntertainment (part of Bertelsmann) merged to create Sony BMG. The joint venture was a bid to\novercome weak retail sales, online file sharing, and fierce competition from rival forms of\nmedia. [6] Independent music companies opposed the merger in Europe, arguing that it created a market\nimbalance, but the European Commission upheld its decision to allow the consolidation. In 2008, Sony\nbought out BMG\u2019s 50 percent stake for $1.2 billion. [7] The company now has full ownership of the second-\nlargest record label in the world. Subsidiary labels owned by Sony include Arista, Columbia, Epic, Jive,\nRCA, and Zomba, and the company represents numerous artists, including Alicia Keys, Ke$ha, and Sade.\nEMI Group\nThe EMI Group is a British company, most famous for introducing the Beatles to the world through its\nParlaphone subsidiary. Originally formed in 1931, through a merger of the UK Columbia Gramophone\nCompany and the Gramophone Company, the money-losing company was taken over in 2007 by private\nequity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd. for $6.5 billion. [8] In an attempt to return the company to\nprofit following the deal, Terra Firma head Guy Hands began slashing costs, eliminating more than 1,000\njobs in the process. [9] Following the takeover, several high-profile artists quit the label, including\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n264 Radiohead, who described the new management structure as \u201ca confused bull in a china shop.\u201d[10] As of\n2010, the struggling company, which represents artists such as Coldplay, Lily Allen, and Pink Floyd, faces\nbeing taken over by its bankers after failing to secure a deal to sell its North American distribution rights\nto one of the other major labels. [11]\nWarner Music Group\nOriginally launched as Warner Bros. Records in 1958, the Warner Music Group gained momentum during\nthe 1960s and 1970s with the purchase of several important new labels, including Elektra and Atlantic.\nLike the other major labels, the company began to suffer from declining sales due to the advent of free\nonline music swapping. In 2004, Time Warner decided to abandon its record label and offloaded its music\ndivision to an investor group so that it could focus on more profitable areas, such as Time Warner Cable.\nThe $2.6 billion deal included more than 800 artists, including Linkin Park, Metallica, and Kid Rock, as\nwell as the group\u2019s publishing arm, Warner/Chapell Music, which owned more than a million\ncopyrights. [12]\nAfter a brief period of independence, Warner Music Group went public in 2005, making the company the\nonly stand-alone music company to be publically traded in the United States. To prepare for its public\noffering, the company made around $250 million in cuts through layoffs and consolidation. [13] The move\ncaused concern among the label\u2019s artists that investors\u2019 interests would take priority over performers\u2019\ninterests and prompted rock-rap group Linkin Park to demand an early release from its contract with\nWarner. Guitarist Brad Delson characterized the company as \u201cbad news,\u201d adding, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t want to be\naround to see what happens.\u201d [14] The band eventually worked out a lucrative new deal with the company.\nAs of 2010, Warner Music Group is considering the possibility of purchasing EMI should the struggling\ncompany fail to meet its debt repayments. [15]\nUniversal Music Group\nThe largest of the Big Four record labels, Universal Music Group established itself as an industry giant in\n1998, with the merger of PolyGram and Universal. Both companies already owned numerous subsidiaries,\nand the merger of the two entertainment conglomerates created the largest music company in the world.\nWholly owned by French international media firm Vivendi since 2006, the company has gone on to\nacquire BMG Music Publishing and Univision Music Group, among smaller labels. Its acquisition of U.K.\nlabels Sanctuary Music Group and V2 in 2007 drew criticisms from the independent sector that the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n265 recording giant was heading toward a monopoly. [16] The Association of Independent Music claimed that\nthe deals would \u201cfurther marginalize a vibrant independent sector, serving to stifle competition and\nnarrow consumer choice.\u201d[17] Despite the objections, both deals went ahead.\nUniversal Music Group\u2019s catalog of artists includes U2, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, and the\nBlack Eyed Peas. Despite its powerful status, the company has suffered from declining sales of physical\nproducts along with the rest of the music industry. As of 2010, UMG plans to lure customers back to\npurchasing physical CDs by lowering prices to under $10 (the average price of a digitally purchased\nalbum). [18]\nIndependent Record Labels: A Smaller Share of the Pie\nIn addition to the four major record labels, independent production companies, or indie record labels,\noperate without the financial assistance of one of the Big Four (although in recent years, the definition has\nshifted to incorporate indies that are partially owned by one of the major labels). Ranging from small\ngrassroots or garage labels to large, profitable businesses, indie labels typically produce music that is less\ncommercially viable and more eclectic than the music produced by the larger mainstream companies.\nIndie Origins\nIndependent labels have played a small but significant role in the music industry for as long as there has\nbeen a market. When patents held on sound recording technologies entered the public market in the\n1920s, opportunities arose for small recording companies to enter the business. To avoid competing with\nlarger firms such as RCA and Edison, the new independent companies focused on neglected areas of the\nmusic industry, such as folk, gospel, and rural blues. When the major labels decided during World War II\nto abandon then-unprofitable music recorded by black artists, the independent labels quickly rushed in to\nfill the void, enjoying a boom during the rock and roll era when R&B music soared in popularity. Between\n1955 and 1959, the U.S. market share of the major companies had dropped from 78 percent to 44 percent,\nwhile the market share of independent companies rose from 22 percent to 56 percent. [19] Sun Records\nplayed a particularly important role in the development of both rock and roll and country music by\nreleasing records by Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, and Roy Orbison.\nDuring the 1970s punk era, indie labels profited from the antimainstream, anticorporate attitude of many\npunk rock bands, which disassociated themselves from the major labels. The indie-rock movement grew\nthroughout the 1980s and 1990s, with labels such as Sub Pop, I.R.S., and Epitaph and epitomized by the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n266 music of the Smiths, the Stone Roses, R.E.M., and the Jesus and Mary Chain. This movement was known\nas \u201ccollege rock,\u201d which would later become alternative rock. However, as alternative rock grew in\npopularity, grunge bands such as Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream. This\nattracted the attention of major record labels, which began to look at the music with a commercially\noriented approach. Many artists found themselves faced with a dilemma: stay true to their indie roots or\n\u201csell out\u201d to a major record label in the hope of financial gain.\nThe Pressure to Sell Out: Nirvana\nWhen Seattle grunge band Nirvana began to achieve success in the late 1980s, they were signed to\nindependent label Sub Pop. Popular among college students, the band\u2019s 1989 album Bleach sold well\nenough for the band to consider moving to a bigger label. Amid rumors that Sub Pop was planning on\nsigning as a subsidiary of a major record company because of financial difficulties, the band decided to cut\nout the middleman and seek a new contract itself. [20] Signing with DGC Records (an imprint of Geffen),\nNirvana released Nevermind in 1991 and found itself thrust into the mainstream. Within 9 months of its\nrelease, the album had sold more than 4 million copies (compared to 30,000 copies of Bleach), knocked\nMichael Jackson\u2019s Dangerous from the top of the Billboard chart, and placed Nirvana at the forefront of\npublic attention.\nFor Sub Pop, Nirvana\u2019s success was both a blessing and a curse. Under severe financial stress, the label\nhad begun layoffs in the spring of 1991, reducing its staff of 25 to a core group of five employees. [21] With\nthe royalties it received from Nevermind, along with the buyout from Nirvana\u2019s contract, and potential\nroyalties from any future albums, Sub Pop was pulled back from the brink of collapse. However, the\ncarefully crafted niche that Sub Pop had found in the music industry vanished. Eager to discover the next\nbig thing in grunge, major labels began scoping out Seattle bands, offering them large advances against\nwhich the smaller independent companies could not compete. Sub Pop chief Bruce Pavitt said of one\nband, \u201cI was told by our head A&R agent that they would be happy with a $5,000 advance. Two months\nlater we were giving them a check for $150,000.\u201d [22]In 1995, the company sold 49 percent of its shares to\nWarner Bros in exchange for financial backing.\nNirvana had equally ambivalent feelings about the transition from a small independent label to a major\nrecord company. At a concert shortly after the band signed their deal with DGC, lead singer Kurt Cobain\ndeclared to the crowd, \u201cHello, we\u2019re major-label corporate rock sellouts.\u201d [23] Having spent several years\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n267 among the anticommercial, do-it-yourself grunge crowd in Seattle, the band\u2019s members were\nuncomfortable with their new position as wealthy rock stars.\nAdvantages of Indie Labels\nAlthough they frequently lose their talent to industry heavyweights, indie labels hold several advantages\nover major record companies. They are generally smaller, enabling them to respond to changing popular\nmusical tastes more quickly than large companies with more cumbersome processes and procedures in\nplace. This enables them to pick up on emerging trends and bring them to market quickly. Although\nunable to compete with the distribution and promotion power of the major labels, indie labels can focus\non niche markets, tapping into regional trends. For example, hip-hop\u2019s initial commercial successes in the\nlate 1970s and early 1980s came through small independent labels such as Tommy Boy and Sugar Hill.\nRealizing that record executives would find the raw street version of hip-hop unworkable, the labels came\nup with the idea of using house bands to play with emcees to improve the commercial viability of the\ngenre. An early example of this process was Sugarhill Gang\u2019s \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight,\u201d which was a worldwide\nhit. [24]\nThe nature of the independent production process may also prove advantageous. A shorter path from\ncreation of the music to distribution and promotion makes it easier to maintain the artist\u2019s original vision.\nFor this reason, many artists prefer to work with independent labels, believing the final product to be\nmore authentic. This argument is also used by some fans of independent labels, who trust companies that\nonly produce one brand of music to adhere to a consistent sound and musical style.\nVanity Labels\nA popular trend among major record labels is to allow high-profile recording artists to front their own\nindie labels with the financial backing of the larger company. Frequently referred to as vanity labels, these\nare spin-offs of the parent company that enable artists to run \u201ca label within a label\u201d and release music by\nother performers that they admire. Examples include Madonna\u2019s Maverick, Trent Reznor\u2019s Nothing, and\nMichael Jackson\u2019s MJJ. Allowing an artist to create a vanity label benefits a major record label in several\nways: It encourages artists to remain with the parent company for longer than they may have otherwise\ndone, it reduces the amount of promotional effort required by the label because fans are likely to be\nattracted to new music based on the recommendation of favorite artists, and it increases the likelihood\nthat bands in niche genres will become big moneymakers for the company.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n268 However, vanity label projects often prove risky and unsuccessful because the label provides all of the\nmoney while the proven artist is responsible for developing new acts, and recent losses in the music\nindustry have caused major labels to cut funding for artist-run ventures. For example, Mariah Carey\u2019s\nlabel, Crave, ended up dissolving less than a year after it opened. In 2004, Universal Records President\nMonte Lipman commented, \u201cBack in the day, when the industry was a lot healthier, it was \u2018OK, here\u2019s $2\u2013\n$3million. Go start your label and let us know when you\u2019re ready to start your first act.\u2019 Those days are\nabsolutely over.\u201d [25]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The global music business constitutes a powerful oligopoly\u2014a market condition in which a few firms\ndominate most of an industry\u2019s production and distribution. Major record labels make up over 85 percent\nof the music industry. Currently, the four major record labels (known as the Big Four) are EMI, Sony Music\nEntertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group.\n\uf0b7 Indie record labels are smaller labels that operate without financial assistance from the Big Four and\ntypically produce less commercially viable music. Although they do not have the marketing and\npromotional power of the major labels, indies have several advantages. They are smaller and more\nflexible than major labels, enabling them to respond more quickly to trends in the industry. Indies are also\nable to tap into niche markets, and their simple structure often means that the music stays closer to the\nartist\u2019s original vision. Major labels often allow high-profile stars to set up their own indie labels, known\nas vanity labels because they reflect the personal musical tastes of the high-profile artist.\nEXERCISE\nDraw a T-chart.

Identify ways in which the Internet has enabled artists to sell music directly to fans.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n271 In the mid-1990s, CD sales were booming. Cassette tapes were all but obsolete, and record\ncompanies were reaping the benefits of sales to consumers who wanted their music collections in the\nlatest technological format. This boom was a familiar step in the evolution of technology. In past\ndecades, records seemed to have an ironclad lock on sales, but they were eventually passed by\ncassette sales. Cassettes, as previously mentioned, were then passed by CD sales. However, despite a\nfew advantages in quality and convenience, there were several areas in which CDs were lacking. They\nwere expensive for consumers to purchase, and consumers had to buy a full album even if they were\nonly interested in listening to one or two songs on it because every album came as a complete\npackage.\nAt the height of the CD revolution, new digital technology was being developed that would eliminate\nthese disadvantages and revolutionize digital music storage. In 1989, German company Fraunhofer-\nGesellshaft discovered how to compress digital audio to approximately one-tenth the size of the\noriginal audio with almost no discernable loss in quality to the average listener. Small enough to be\ntransmitted over a modem, the so-called MP3 files (the MP stands for Moving Pictures Experts Group,\nwhich is the group that sets the standard for audio and video compression and transmission, and\nthe 3 refers to the most popular layer or scheme with the standard) could be downloaded onto a\nwebsite or FTP site in a relatively short amount of time. Initially done only by a tech-savvy elite, the\nprocess of downloading and sharing audio files was a painstaking process because MP3 files were not\nin one centralized location. Peer-to-peerfile sharing\u2014the process in which two or more computer\nsystems are connected over the Internet for the purpose of sharing music or video files\u2014became a\nworldwide phenomenon in 1999 with the development of centralized online file-sharing system\nNapster.\nFile Sharing: From Illegal Downloading to Digital Music Stores\nIn 1999, Northeastern University student Shawn Fanning dropped out of school to complete work on a\nsoftware project that would simplify finding and downloading MP3 files on the Internet. [1] The result was\na free downloadableNapster program that transformed PCs into servers for exchanging music files over\nthe Internet. The program also sported a chat-room feature that served a community of music fans eager\nto discuss their favorite bands. Originally an experiment between Fanning and his friends, the program\u2019s\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n272 popularity spread through word of mouth. By the end of the first week, 15,000 people had downloaded the\nprogram. [2]\nAlthough music fans were thrilled by their newfound ability to download free songs (albeit illegally), the\nrecord industry was not happy. In December 1999, all four major record labels, together with the\nRecording Industry Association of America (RIAA), launched a series of lawsuits against Fanning and his\nsite for copyright infringement. Citing the nonpayment of royalties and the loss of revenue through lost\nCD sales, the RIAA also claimed that artists would be unwilling to create new songs now that they could\nbe obtained for free. In response, Napster argued that it merely provided the software for people to share\nmusic files and no copyrighted material appeared on the site itself. In addition, Fanning claimed that the\nsite encouraged people to go out and buy CDs based on the exposure artists received from Napster. [3]\nAs the number of the Napster program users grew, the lawsuit began to garner publicity. Some Napster\nsupporters, many of them college students, viewed the legal battle as a David versus Goliath situation and\nrooted for Fanning to beat the corporate music giants. Most recording artists sided with the record labels,\nwith heavy metal rock group Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre launching their own separate lawsuits\nagainst Napster in April 2000. However, some bands discovered a way to use the site to their advantage.\nAlternative rock group Radiohead promoted its album Kid A by secretly releasing the record to Napster 3\nweeks before its street release date, creating a wave of publicity that launched the album to the No. 1 spot\non the Billboard 200 chart in October 2000. [4]Reggae-rock band Dispatch poured free recordings onto\nthe site, increasing its fan base to such an extent that it sold out multiple nights at Madison Square\nGarden in early 2007. [5] Dispatch bassist Pete Heimbold said, \u201c[w]hat we found was it really didn\u2019t deter\nkids from coming to shows and buying CDs. In fact, I think it had the opposite effect\u2014people heard songs\noff Napster and had a lot of merchandise and CDs.\u201d [6]\nDespite the Napster program\u2019s many advantages, including a built-in user base of 26.4 million people, the\nmajor record labels were unable to reach a deal with the site to create any form of fee-based service. In\n2007, former EMI Executive Ted Cohen said, \u201c[t]he record labels had an opportunity to create a digital\necosystem and infrastructure to sell music online, but they kept looking at the small picture instead of the\nbig one. They wouldn\u2019t let go of CDs.\u201d [7] A court injunction in 2000 ordered Napster to remove all\ncopyrighted material from its servers, and within two days the website was effectively shut down.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n273 Following a bankruptcy liquidation, the Napster program was reinvented as a paid subscription service in\n2003. Under its new terms, users pay a fee to access music.\nThe Post-Napster Universe: Gnutella and Kazaa\nNapster\u2019s initial success resulted in a wave of similar sites emerging throughout 2000. The creators of\nthese new services recognized that Napster\u2019s legal problems were the result of maintaining a central file\nserver. By keeping a list of all the users on the network, Napster was able to control its users\u2019 activities by\nblocking illegal downloads. When the court ordered the service to halt illegal downloading, the absence of\na central database destroyed the entire Napster network.\nTo avoid a similar fate, new peer-to-peer (P2P) systems adopted two different approaches.\nThe Gnutella network, which serves clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX, avoided\nmaintaining a central database. Instead, it dispersed information about file locations across computer\n\u201cnodes\u201d around the world. Users were able to find each other, but the service could disclaim the ability to\nprevent copyright infringements. The lack of a centralized server and multiple client base meant that,\nunlike Napster, it would be impossible to shut down the entire Gnutella network through a simple court\norder. Courts would need to block all Gnutella network traffic at the Internet service provider (ISP) level\nof the Internet, a far trickier prospect than simply shuting down a central database.\nIn addition to a lack of a central database, some P2P providers set up in offshore locations to take\nadvantage of less-restrictive copyright laws and weaker enforcement. Kazaa was initially based in the\nPacific island nation of Vanuata and operated out of Australia. However, the company\u2019s offshore location\ndid not protect it from copyright infringement laws. After a series of legal wrangles, Kazaa was ordered to\nmodify its software in Australia in 2005 and agreed to pay $100 million in damages to the record\nindustry. In 2006, the site became a legal music download service. [8]\nNot content with pursuing providers of illegal music downloads, the RIAA also took legal action against\nthe users of sites such as LimeWire and Kazaa. In 2003, the recording industry sued 261 American music\nfans for illegally sharing songs on P2P networks. [9] Athough fines under U.S. copyright law can rise to up\nto $150,000 per illegally downloaded track, most of the cases were settled for much less. As of 2008, the\nRIAA had sued or threatened to sue more than 30,000 individuals for copyright infringement. [10]\nBusted! Woman Fined $1.92 Million\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n274 In an ongoing legal battle with the RIAA, Minnesota woman Jammie Thomas was found guilty of\ncopyright infringement for a second time in 2009 and fined $1.92 million for illegally downloading 24\nsongs on file-sharing Kazaa website. First fined $222,000 for using the Kazaa service, the 30-year-old\nsingle mother of four refused to settle with the recording industry out of court. Thomas claimed her\ninnocence, maintaining that she was not the Kazaa service user whose files had been detected by RIAA\ninvestigators. [11]\nThe case became the first of its kind to go before a jury in 2007, and Thomas faced fines ranging from\n$18,000 to $3.6 million under the Copyright Act of 1976. After deliberating for 5 hours, a jury found her\nguilty of copyright infringement and awarded the RIAA $222,000 in damages. The verdict was thrown out\na year later when a federal judge declared a mistrial. However, jurors in Thomas\u2019s second trial found her\nguilty again, upping the fine to $1.92 million. A federal judge later reduced the damages to $50,000. In\nJanuary 2010, the RIAA offered to close the case for $25,000, but Thomas continued to refuse to pay. [12]\nThomas\u2019s case has provoked strong reactions on both sides of the debate. RIAA spokeswoman Cara\nDuckwork said, \u201c[i]t is a shame that Ms. Thomas-Rasset continues to deny any responsibility for her\nactions rather than accept a reasonable settlement offer and put this case behind her.\u201d [13] Joe Sibley, one\nof Thomas\u2019s lawyers, argued, \u201cThey want to use this case as a bogeyman to scare people into doing what\nthey want, to pay exorbitant damages.\u201d [14] The RIAA is currently winding down its 6-year campaign\nagainst illegal downloaders, approximately 30,000 lawsuits in all. Instead the RIAA is focusing on\ncreating a program with Internet providers to discontinue service to users who continue to break online\ncopyright laws.[15]\nThe Advent of Digital Music Stores\nWith the closure of the Napster program and the crackdown on illegal downloading, a void in the music\ndistribution market opened and was almost immediately filled by fee-based online music providers. This\nvoid helped to resurrect one company many feared was declining. Apple launched\ntheiTunes appliance program\u2014a free application for the Mac computer that converted audio CDs into\ndigital music files, organized digital music collections, and played Internet radio\u2014and the iPod\u2014a\nportable media player compatible with the iTunes appliance program software\u2014in 2001, and both\nproducts have dominated the market ever since. In 2003, the company signed deals with all of the major\nrecord labels and launched the iTunes Store, a virtual store that enabled people to buy and download\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n275 digital music on demand. Initially featuring 200,000 songs at a cost of $0.99 each to download, the store\nquickly revolutionized the digital music industry. Within a week, iTunes Store customers purchased 1\nmillion songs. [16] Six months later, Apple convinced the record labels to expand the service to Microsoft\nWindows operating system users, and by the following year, the iTunes Store had gone international.\nWithin 5 years of its launch, the iTunes Store was the top music seller in the United States, and in\nFebruary 2010, Apple celebrated its 10 billionth download. [17]\nSeveral companies have attempted to cash in on the success of iTunes appliance program, with varying\nresults. In 2007, Internet giant Amazon.com launched the Amazon MP3 digital music download store that\ninitially offered more than 2 million songs priced between $0.89 and $0.99. [18] Amazon\u2019s major selling\npoint was its lack of digital rights management (DRM) software, which enabled music downloads to be\nplayed on any hardware device. In contrast, songs downloaded through the iTunes appliance program\ncould only be played on Apple products. Apple removed these restrictions in 2009 after negotiating an\nagreement with the major record labels. Despite its efforts to topple Apple from the top spot in the digital\nmusic arena, the Amazon MP3 service only commanded 8 percent of the digital music market in 2009,\ncompared with Apple\u2019s 69 percent of the market. [19] Napster has also stayed in the game by releasing a\nnew design plan in 2009 after being purchased by Best Buy. The plan requires users to pay a fee to access\nall the music in its catalog. This plan has kept Napster in business; however, the company only had 1\npercent to 2 percent of the market share at the beginning of 2010. [20] Other online music stores are\noperated by Walmart, Rhapsody, and Yahoo! Music.\nThe Impact of Digital Music Technology\nOnce digital music technology was introduced to the world, its domination of the music industry was\nalmost instantaneous. MP3 players have several key advantages over CD players. They are smaller and\nmore portable, eliminating the necessity of lugging around bulky CD carrying cases. Whereas CDs can\nonly hold a relatively small amount of data, MP3 players are able to compress thousands of songs onto a\nsingle device (this lack of packaging and manufacturing has caused disputes between artists and labels\nover royalties, which will be discussed later on). The lack of moving parts means MP3 players can be taken\njogging or cycling without the risk of a song skipping every time the user hits a bumpy patch of road.\nUsers are also no longer obligated to buy entire albums; instead, they can pick and choose their favorite\nsongs from a catalog of online music.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n276 Of the many brands of MP3 player currently available on the market, Apple\u2019s iPod has been the dominant\nforce in the digital music industry since its launch in 2001 (see Figure 6.15). Former Apple CEO Steve\nJobs attributed the success of his product to its simple design. In a 2005 interview he said, \u201cOne of the\nbiggest insights we have was that we decided not to try to manage your music library on the iPod, but to\nmanage it in iTunes. Other companies tried to do everything on the device itself and made it so\ncomplicated that it was useless.\u201d [21] The iPod has also reaped the benefits of a successful marketing\ncampaign and constant reinvention of its original format. Customers now have the choice of several\ndifferent iPod models according to their need for storage space and desire for additional services such as\nInternet access and video-playing capability.\nFigure 6.20\nSince its launch in 2001, Apple\u2019s iPod has remained the biggest-selling brand of MP3 player. [22]\nProfit Division\nOne effect that Apple iTunes and other online retailers have had on the music industry is to shake up the\nway that profits are divided among artists and record labels. Because of the unanticipated boom in digital\nrecord sales, recording artists and their publishers were unprepared for the possibility that they might\nneed to renegotiate their contracts to include digital downloads. Many artists discovered to their cost that\ntheir contracts predated the digital download era, leaving them open to exploitative royalty rates for\ndigital downloads of songs and ringtones.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n277 The very definition of digital royalties is still under negotiation\u2014should a download be classified as\nlicensed use of an artist\u2019s music (which nets the artist approximately 50 percent of the download fee in\nroyalties), or should it be classified as a retail sale (which nets the artist approximately 12 percent of the\ndownload fee in royalties)? [23] The answer depends on the contractual agreement between artists and\nrecord labels. In 2009, rapper Eminem\u2019s publishing company FBT Productions sued Universal Music\nGroup for $1.6 million of unpaid royalties, arguing that the downloads should fall under the \u201clicensing\u201d\nagreements that cover physical releases such as CDs, rather than the \u201cdistribution\u201d agreements put forth\nby Universal Music Group. [24] A jury agreed that a song sold online is no different from a song bought in a\nstore and ruled in favor of the record label.\nBecause online retailers such as Apple are responsible for the marketing, management, and delivery of\ndownloaded music, record labels\u2019 overheads are much lower. This new industry trend has prompted many\nartists and publishers to demand a bigger share of labels\u2019 profits. As of 2010, a $0.99 download from the\niTunes appliance program generates $0.30 for Apple and $0.70 for the record label, of which $0.09 goes\nto the songwriter and publisher as a standard mechanical royalty. [25]\nCD Sales\nThe burgeoning popularity of digital music has drastically reduced revenue brought in from CD sales since\n2001. Although many people have switched from illegally downloading to purchasing music on digital\nstores, paid digital downloads have not yet begun to make up for the loss of revenue from CD sales, and\nillegal downloads remain a problem for the recording industry. According to online download tracker\nBigChampagne Media Measurement, unauthorized downloads still represent about 90 percent of the\nmarket. [26] With album sales declining at a rate of 8 percent a year, music executives are trying to figure\nout how to stem the flow of money flooding out of the CD sales market. Former head of Yahoo! Music\nDavid Goldberg said, \u201cThe digital music business is a war of attrition that nobody seems to be winning.\nThe CD is still disappearing, and nothing is replacing it in entirety as a revenue generator.\u201d [27] In 2009,\ndigital revenue sales rose and were well on the way to equaling CD sales, which were on the decline.\nFigure 6.21\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n278 Saylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n279 Digital Music Sales versus Physical Music Sales. [28]\nTo partially make up for lost sales, the music industry has been generating revenue through licensing fees,\nincluding fees for ringtones, music played on Internet radio stations such as MySpace Music and Pandora,\nand music videos on the YouTube video-sharing website that is owned by Google. In 2009, digital\nlicensing revenue reached $84 million and continues to grow. [29] Meanwhile, recording artists are\nfocusing their attention on live performances and merchandise, which have become their main source of\nrevenue. Demand for concert tickets rose at least 7 percent in 2008 to $4.2 billion, according to touring\nindustry trade magazine Pollstar. [30]\nUtilizing the Internet: A New Level of Indie\nOver the past few years, the Internet has begun to level the proverbial playing field between major and\nindependent record labels. Exemplifying how smaller indie labels are able to latch on to trends more\nquickly than the Big Four, indies have embraced new technology, including blogging, online video sites,\nand online social networking sites, as a means of promoting their music, while the major labels have fallen\nbehind the curve. With social networking sites enabling artists to communicate directly with their fans,\nthe need for extensive financial backing or an industry middleman is all but eliminated. Now, artists can\nupload their music onto a social networking site for free and generate record sales purely through word of\nmouth.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n280 Although a few indie artists have become household names entirely through the buzz generated on social\nnetworking sites, many others find that they need some guidance. The direct-to-fan business model has\ncreated opportunities for web-based companies such as Nimbit and ReverbNation, which provide\nsoftware that enables independent artists and record labels to market their music online, keep track of\nsales, create demand for their music, and communicate with fans. The companies offer social networking\napplications that enable fans to purchase music directly from the artists rather than being redirected to a\nthird-party website. Other advantages for bands include automatic updates to fans across a variety of\nnetworking sites, digital distribution through the iTunes appliance program and other stores, and real-\ntime sales updates.\nMany established artists have also embraced the direct-to-fan business model. In 2007, Nine Inch Nails\nfrontman Trent Reznor announced that the band was splitting from its contractual obligations to\nUniversal Music Group to distribute its next albums independently. Well known for his vocal distaste of\nmajor record labels and their profiteering, Reznor encouraged fans in Australia to steal his album Year\nZero because he believed it was priced too highly there. [31]Commenting on the state of the music industry\nin a 2007 interview he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a battle where I\u2019m trying to put out quality material that matters and\nI\u2019ve got fans that feel it\u2019s their right to steal it and I\u2019ve got a company that\u2019s so bureaucratic and clumsy\nand ignorant and behind the times they don\u2019t know what to do, so they rip the people off.\u201d [32] Following\nthe band\u2019s split with Universal, they released studio album The Slip as a free digital download in 2008.\nReznor stated, \u201c[t]his one\u2019s on me,\u201d on his website, thanking fans for their loyalty. The album was\ndownloaded 1.4 million times within the first 6 weeks of its release. [33] A similar technique used by tech-\nsavvy alternative band Radiohead reaped even higher rewards in 2007, when its retail release of In\nRainbows entered the album chart at No. 1 even though the digital version had been offered online at a\nprice of the customer\u2019s choosing several months earlier (see Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social\nMedia\" for more information about Radiohead\u2019s In Rainbows release). [34] The web-based direct release\nmodel allows bands such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails to obtain vital information about their fan\nbases\u2014including email addresses\u2014that they can use for future promotions. Whether or not the practice\nproves to be a passing fad, the traditional music industry model is shifting as new technology makes it\neasier for artists to communicate directly with their fans.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n281 \uf0b7 The introduction of digital music technology and peer-to-peer file sharing in 1999 changed the nature of\nthe music industry. Websites, such as the Napster service, which enabled users to share free music,\nnegatively impacted CD sales. Although the RIAA successfully shut down Napster, other sites emerged\nthroughout the early 2000s, such as the Gnutella network and the Kazaa service. Rather than figuring out\na way to make money from digital music, the recording industry focused its efforts on bringing lawsuits\nagainst illegal downloaders. By the time iTunes and other fee-based music sites became available,\nirreversible damage had been done to the industry\u2019s sales figures.\n\uf0b7 Apple\u2019s iTunes Store is the dominant digital music retailer in the United States, commanding almost 70\npercent of the digital music market. The boom in digital music sales has affected the music industry in\nseveral ways: It has changed the way that profits are distributed among recording artists and labels, it has\ncaused a massive decline in CD sales, and it has prompted industry executives to seek profits elsewhere\n(for example, through licensing fees).\n\uf0b7 The Internet has proved advantageous for smaller indie labels that take advantage of blogging, social\nnetworking sites, and video websites as a means to promote their music. Companies such as Nimbit and\nReverbNation are replacing some of the functions performed by major record labels, enabling artists to\npromote and distribute their own music directly to fans. Established bands such as Radiohead and Nine\nInch Nails have separated from major labels and used the Internet to successfully distribute their music at\nlittle or no cost to fans. The ready availability and low cost of this new technology is changing the music\nindustry, and the Big Four companies may need to adapt traditional business models to return to profit.\nEXERCISE\nVisit the Apple website (http://www.apple.com/) and compare its digital music services and products with\nthose of its nearest competitors.

Their investment paid off\nwith the success of their station. By 1990, WOXY had grown in prestige to become one of Rolling\nStone magazine\u2019s top 15 radio stations in the country and had even been made famous by a reference in\nthe 1988 film Rain Man. [2] In 1998, the station launched a web cast and developed a national following,\nranking 12th among Internet broadcasters for listenership in 2004. [3]\nWhen the station\u2019s owners decided to retire and sell the frequency allocation in 2004, they hoped to find\ninvestors to continue the online streaming version of the station. After several months of unsuccessful\nsearching, however, the station went off the air entirely\u2014only to find a last-minute investor willing to fund\nan Internet version of the station. [4]\nThe online version of the station struggled to make ends meet until it was purchased by the online music\nfirm Lala. [5] The now-defunct Lala sold WOXY to music company Future Sounds Inc., which moved the\nstation and staff from Ohio to Austin, Texas. In March 2010, citing \u201ccurrent economic realities and the\nlack of ongoing funding,\u201d WOXY.com went off the air with only a day\u2019s notice. [6]\nTaken in the context of the modern Internet revolution and the subsequent faltering of institutions such\nas newspapers and book publishers, the rise and fall of WOXY may seem to bode ill for the general fate of\nradio. However, taken in the larger context of radio\u2019s history, this story of the Internet\u2019s effect on radio\ncould prove to be merely another leap in a long line of radio revolutions. From the shutting down of all\nbroadcasts during World War I to the eclipse of radio by television during the 1950s, many arbiters of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n288 culture and business have prophesized the demise of radio for decades. Yet this chapter will show how the\ninherent flexibility and intimacy of the medium has allowed it to adapt to new market trends and to\ncontinue to have relevance as a form of mass communication.\n[1] WOXY, \u201cThe History of WOXY,\u201d 2009, http://woxy.com/about/.\n[2] Lauren Bishop, \u201c97X Farewell,\u201d Cincinnati Enquirer, May 10, 2004,\nhttp://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/05/10/tem_tem1a.html.\n[3] Lauren Bishop, \u201c97X Farewell,\u201d Cincinnati Enquirer, May 10, 2004,\nhttp://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/05/10/tem_tem1a.html.\n[4] WOXY, \u201cThe History of WOXY,\u201d 2009, http://woxy.com/about/.\n[5] Jacqui Cheng, \u201cBad Luck, Funding Issues Shutter Indie Station WOXY.com,\u201d Ars Technica(blog), March 23,\n2010, http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2010/03/bad-luck-funding-issues-shutter-indie-station-woxycom.ars.\n[6] Jacqui Cheng, \u201cBad Luck, Funding Issues Shutter Indie Station WOXY.com,\u201d Ars Technica(blog), March 23,\n2010, http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2010/03/bad-luck-funding-issues-shutter-indie-station-woxycom.ars.\n7.1\nEvolution of Radio Broadcasting\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Identify the major technological changes in radio as a medium since its inception.\n2. Explain the defining characteristics of radio\u2019s Golden Age.\n3. Describe the effects of networks and conglomerates on radio programming and culture.\nAt its most basic level, radio is communication through the use of radio waves. This includes radio\nused for person-to-person communication as well as radio used for mass communication. Both of\nthese functions are still practiced today. Although most people associate the term radio with radio\nstations that broadcast to the general public, radio wave technology is used in everything from\ntelevision to cell phones, making it a primary conduit for person-to-person communication.\nThe Invention of Radio\nGuglielmo Marconi is often credited as the inventor of radio. As a young man living in Italy, Marconi read\na biography of Hienrich Hertz, who had written and experimented with early forms of wireless\ntransmission. Marconi then duplicated Hertz\u2019s experiments in his own home, successfully sending\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n289 transmissions from one side of his attic to the other. [1] He saw the potential for the technology and\napproached the Italian government for support. When the government showed no interest in his ideas,\nMarconi moved to England and took out a patent on his device. Rather than inventing radio from scratch,\nhowever, Marconi essentially combined the ideas and experiments of other people to make them into a\nuseful communications tool. [2]\nFigure 7.2\nGuglielmo Marconi developed an early version of the wireless radio.\nIn fact, long-distance electronic communication has existed since the middle of the 19th century. The\ntelegraph communicated messages through a series of long and short clicks. Cables across the Atlantic\nOcean connected even the far-distant United States and England using this technology. By the 1870s,\ntelegraph technology had been used to develop the telephone, which could transmit an individual\u2019s voice\nover the same cables used by its predecessor.\nWhen Marconi popularized wireless technology, contemporaries initially viewed it as a way to allow the\ntelegraph to function in places that could not be connected by cables. Early radios acted as devices for\nnaval ships to communicate with other ships and with land stations; the focus was on person-to-person\ncommunication. However, the potential for broadcasting\u2014sending messages to a large group of potential\nlisteners\u2014wasn\u2019t realized until later in the development of the medium.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n290 Broadcasting Arrives\nThe technology needed to build a radio transmitter and receiver was relatively simple, and the knowledge\nto build such devices soon reached the public. Amateur radio operators quickly crowded the airwaves,\nbroadcasting messages to anyone within range and, by 1912, incurred government regulatory measures\nthat required licenses and limited broadcast ranges for radio operation. [3] This regulation also gave the\npresident the power to shut down all stations, a power notably exercised in 1917 upon the United States\u2019\nentry into World War I to keep amateur radio operators from interfering with military use of radio waves\nfor the duration of the war. [4]\nWireless technology made radio as it is known today possible, but its modern, practical function as a mass\ncommunication medium had been the domain of other technologies for some time. As early as the 1880s,\npeople relied on telephones to transmit news, music, church sermons, and weather reports. In Budapest,\nHungary, for example, a subscription service allowed individuals to listen to news reports and fictional\nstories on their telephones. [5] Around this time, telephones also transmitted opera performances from\nParis to London. In 1909, this innovation emerged in the United States as a pay-per-play phonograph\nservice in Wilmington, Delaware. [6] This service allowed subscribers to listen to specific music recordings\non their telephones. [7]\nIn 1906, Massachusetts resident Reginald Fessenden initiated the first radio transmission of the human\nvoice, but his efforts did not develop into a useful application. [8] Ten years later, Lee de Forest used radio\nin a more modern sense when he set up an experimental radio station, 2XG, in New York City. De Forest\ngave nightly broadcasts of music and news until World War I halted all transmissions for private\ncitizens. [9]\nRadio\u2019s Commercial Potential\nAfter the World War I radio ban lifted with the close of the conflict in 1919, a number of small stations\nbegan operating using technologies that had developed during the war. Many of these stations developed\nregular programming that included religious sermons, sports, and news. [10] As early as 1922, Schenectady,\nNew York\u2019s WGY broadcast over 40 original dramas, showing radio\u2019s potential as a medium for drama.\nThe WGY players created their own scripts and performed them live on air. This same groundbreaking\ngroup also made the first known attempt at television drama in 1928. [11]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n291 Businesses such as department stores, which often had their own stations, first put radio\u2019s commercial\napplications to use. However, these stations did not advertise in a way that the modern radio listener\nwould recognize. Early radio advertisements consisted only of a \u201cgenteel sales message broadcast during\n\u2018business\u2019 (daytime) hours, with no hard sell or mention of price.\u201d [12] In fact, radio advertising was\noriginally considered an unprecedented invasion of privacy, because\u2014unlike newspapers, which were\nbought at a newsstand\u2014radios were present in the home and spoke with a voice in the presence of the\nwhole family. [13] However, the social impact of radio was such that within a few years advertising was\nreadily accepted on radio programs. Advertising agencies even began producing their own radio programs\nnamed after their products. At first, ads ran only during the day, but as economic pressure mounted\nduring the Great Depression in the 1930s, local stations began looking for new sources of revenue, and\nadvertising became a normal part of the radio soundscape. [14]\nThe Rise of Radio Networks\nNot long after radio\u2019s broadcast debut, large businesses saw its potential profitability and\nformed networks. In 1926, RCA started the National Broadcasting Network (NBC). Groups of stations that\ncarried syndicated network programs along with a variety of local shows soon formed its Red and Blue\nnetworks. Two years after the creation of NBC, the United Independent Broadcasters became the\nColumbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and began competing with the existing Red and Blue networks. [15]\nAlthough early network programming focused mainly on music, it soon developed to include other\nprograms. Among these early innovations was the variety show. This format generally featured several\ndifferent performers introduced by a host who segued between acts. Variety shows included styles as\ndiverse as jazz and early country music. At night, dramas and comedies such as Amos \u2019n\u2019 Andy, The Lone\nRanger, and Fibber McGee and Molly filled the airwaves. News, educational programs, and other types of\ntalk programs also rose to prominence during the 1930s. [16]\nThe Radio Act of 1927\nIn the mid-1920s, profit-seeking companies such as department stores and newspapers owned a majority\nof the nation\u2019s broadcast radio stations, which promoted their owners\u2019 businesses. [17] Nonprofit groups\nsuch as churches and schools operated another third of the stations. As the number of radio stations\noutgrew the available frequencies, interference became problematic, and the government stepped into the\nfray.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n292 The Radio Act of 1927 established the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to oversee regulation of the\nairwaves. A year after its creation, the FRC reallocated station bandwidths to correct interference\nproblems. The organization reserved 40 high-powered channels, setting aside 37 of these for network\naffiliates. The remaining 600 lower-powered bandwidths went to stations that had to share the\nfrequencies; this meant that as one station went off the air at a designated time, another one began\nbroadcasting in its place. The Radio Act of 1927 allowed major networks such as CBS and NBC to gain a\n70 percent share of U.S. broadcasting by the early 1930s, earning them $72 million in profits by\n1934.[18] At the same time, nonprofit broadcasting fell to only 2 percent of the market. [19]\nIn protest of the favor that the 1927 Radio Act showed toward commercial broadcasting, struggling\nnonprofit radio broadcasters created the National Committee on Education by Radio to lobby for more\noutlets. Basing their argument on the notion that the airwaves\u2014unlike newspapers\u2014were a public\nresource, they asserted that groups working for the public good should take precedence over commercial\ninterests. Nevertheless, the Communications Act of 1934 passed without addressing these issues, and\nradio continued as a mainly commercial enterprise. [20]\nThe Golden Age of Radio\nThe so-called Golden Age of Radio occurred between 1930 and the mid-1950s. Because many associate\nthe 1930s with the struggles of the Great Depression, it may seem contradictory that such a fruitful\ncultural occurrence arose during this decade. However, radio lent itself to the era. After the initial\npurchase of a receiver, radio was free and so provided an inexpensive source of entertainment that\nreplaced other, more costly pastimes, such as going to the movies.\nRadio also presented an easily accessible form of media that existed on its own schedule. Unlike reading\nnewspapers or books, tuning in to a favorite program at a certain time became a part of listeners\u2019 daily\nroutine because it effectively forced them to plan their lives around the dial.\nDaytime Radio Finds Its Market\nDuring the Great Depression, radio became so successful that another network, the Mutual Broadcasting\nNetwork, began in 1934 to compete with NBC\u2019s Red and Blue networks and the CBS network, creating a\ntotal of four national networks.[21] As the networks became more adept at generating profits, their\nbroadcast selections began to take on a format that later evolved into modern television programming.\nSerial dramas and programs that focused on domestic work aired during the day when many women were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n293 at home. Advertisers targeted this demographic with commercials for domestic needs such as\nsoap. [22] Because they were often sponsored by soap companies, daytime serial dramas soon became\nknown as soap operas. Some modern televised soap operas, such as Guiding Light, which ended in 2009,\nactually began in the 1930s as radio serials.[23]\nThe Origins of Prime Time\nDuring the evening, many families listened to the radio together, much as modern families may gather for\ntelevision\u2019s prime time. Popular evening comedy variety shows such as George Burns and Gracie\nAllen\u2019s Burns and Allen, the Jack Benny Show, and the Bob Hope Show all began during the 1930s. These\nshows featured a central host\u2014for whom the show was often named\u2014and a series of sketch comedies,\ninterviews, and musical performances, not unlike contemporary programs such as Saturday Night Live.\nPerformed lived before a studio audience, the programs thrived on a certain flair and spontaneity. Later in\nthe evening, so-called prestige dramas such as Lux Radio Theater and Mercury Theatre on the Air aired.\nThese shows featured major Hollywood actors recreating movies or acting out adaptations of literature. [24]\nFigure 7.3\nMany prime-time radio broadcasts featured film stars recreating famous films over the air.\nInstant News\nBy the late 1930s, the popularity of radio news broadcasts had surpassed that of newspapers. Radio\u2019s\nability to emotionally draw its audiences in close to events made for news that evoked stronger responses\nand, thus, greater interest than print news could. For example, the infant son of famed aviator Charles\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n294 Lindbergh was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Radio networks set up mobile stations that covered\nevents as they unfolded, broadcasting nonstop for several days and keeping listeners updated on every\ndetail while tying them emotionally to the outcome. [25]\nAs recording technology advanced, reporters gained the ability to record events in the field and bring\nthem back to the studio to broadcast over the airwaves. One early example of this was Herb Morrison\u2019s\nrecording of the Hindenburg disaster. In 1937, the Hindenburg blimp exploded into flames while\nattempting to land, killing 37 of its passengers. Morrison was already on the scene to record the descent,\ncapturing the fateful crash. The entire event was later broadcast, including the sound of the exploding\nblimp, providing listeners with an unprecedented emotional connection to a national disaster. Morrison\u2019s\nexclamation \u201cOh, the humanity!\u201d became a common phrase of despair after the event. [26]\nRadio news became even more important during World War II, when programs such as Norman\nCorwin\u2019s This Is War! sought to bring more sober news stories to a radio dial dominated by\nentertainment. The program dealt with the realities of war in a somber manner; at the beginning of the\nprogram, the host declared, \u201cNo one is invited to sit down and take it easy. Later, later, there\u2019s a war\non.\u201d [27]In 1940, Edward R. Murrow, a journalist working in England at the time, broadcast firsthand\naccounts of the German bombing of London, giving Americans a sense of the trauma and terror that the\nEnglish were experiencing at the outset of the war. [28] Radio news outlets were the first to broadcast the\nattack on Pearl Harbor that propelled the United States into World War II in 1941. By 1945, radio news\nhad become so efficient and pervasive that when Roosevelt died, only his wife, his children, and Vice\nPresident Harry S. Truman were aware of it before the news was broadcast over the public airwaves. [29]\nThe Birth of the Federal Communications Commission\nThe Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and ushered in\na new era of government regulation. The organization quickly began enacting influential radio decisions.\nAmong these was the 1938 decision to limit stations to 50,000 watts of broadcasting power, a ceiling that\nremains in effect today. [30] As a result of FCC antimonopoly rulings, RCA was forced to sell its NBC Blue\nnetwork; this spun-off division became the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1943. [31]\nAnother significant regulation with long-lasting influence was the Fairness Doctrine. In 1949, the FCC\nestablished the Fairness Doctrine as a rule stating that if broadcasters editorialized in favor of a position\non a particular issue, they had to give equal time to all other reasonable positions on that issue. [32] This\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n295 tenet came from the long-held notion that the airwaves were a public resource and that they should thus\nserve the public in some way. Although the regulation remained in effect until 1987, the impact of its core\nconcepts are still debated. This chapter will explore the Fairness Doctrine and its impact in greater detail\nin a later section.\nRadio on the Margins\nDespite the networks\u2019 hold on programming, educational stations persisted at universities and in some\nmunicipalities. They broadcast programs such as theSchool of the Air and College of the Air as well as\nroundtable and town hall forums. In 1940, the FCC reserved a set of frequencies in the lower range of the\nFM radio spectrum for public education purposes as part of its regulation of the new spectrum. The\nreservation of FM frequencies gave educational stations a boost, but FM proved intitally unpopular due to\na setback in 1945, when the FCC moved the FM bandwidth to a higher set of frequencies, ostensibly to\navoid problems with interference. [33] This change required the purchase of new equipment by both\nconsumers and radio stations, thus greatly slowing the widespread adoption of FM radio.\nOne enduring anomaly in the field of educational stations has been the Pacifica Radio network. Begun in\n1949 to counteract the effects of commercial radio by bringing educational programs and dialogue to the\nairwaves, Pacifica has grown from a single station\u2014Berkeley, California\u2019s KPFA\u2014to a network of five\nstations and more than 100 affiliates. [34] From the outset, Pacifica aired newer classical, jazz, and folk\nmusic along with lectures, discussions, and interviews with public artists and intellectuals. Among\nPacifica\u2019s major innovations was its refusal to take money from commercial advertisers, relying instead on\ndonations from listeners and grants from institutions such as the Ford Foundation and calling itself\nlistener-supported. [35]\nAnother important innovation on the fringes of the radio dial during this time was the growth\nof border stations. Located just across the Mexican border, these stations did not have to follow FCC or\nU.S. regulatory laws. Because the stations broadcast at 250,000 watts and higher, their listening range\ncovered much of North America. Their content also diverged\u2014at the time markedly\u2014from that of U.S.\nstations. For example, Dr. John Brinkley started station XERF in Del Rio, Mexico, after being forced to\nshut down his station in Nebraska, and he used the border station in part to promote a dubious goat gland\noperation that supposedly cured sexual impotence. [36] Besides the goat gland promotion, the station and\nothers like it often carried music, like country and western, that could not be heard on regular network\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n296 radio. Later border station disc jockeys, such as Wolfman Jack, were instrumental in bringing rock and\nroll music to a wider audience. [37]\nTelevision Steals the Show\nA great deal of radio\u2019s success as a medium during the 1920s and 1930s was due to the fact that no other\nmedium could replicate it. This changed in the late 1940s and early 1950s as television became popular. A\n1949 poll of people who had seen television found that almost half of them believed that radio was\ndoomed. [38] Television sets had come on the market by the late 1940s, and by 1951, more Americans were\nwatching television during prime time than ever.[39] Famous radio programs such as The Bob Hope\nShow were made into television shows, further diminishing radio\u2019s unique offerings. [40]\nSurprisingly, some of radio\u2019s most critically lauded dramas launched during this period. Gunsmoke, an\nadult-oriented Western show (that later become television\u2019s longest-running show) began in 1952; crime\ndrama Dragnet, later made famous in both television and film, broadcast between 1949 and 1957;\nandYours Truly, Johnny Dollar aired from 1949 to 1962, when CBS canceled its remaining radio dramas.\nHowever, these respected radio dramas were the last of their kind. [41] Although radio was far from\ndoomed by television, its Golden Age was.\nTransition to Top 40\nAs radio networks abandoned the dramas and variety shows that had previously sustained their formats,\nthe soundscape was left to what radio could still do better than any other mass medium: play music. With\nadvertising dollars down and the emergence of better recording formats, it made good business sense for\nradio to focus on shows that played prerecorded music. As strictly music stations began to rise, new\ninnovations to increase their profitability appeared. One of the most notable and far-reaching of these\ninnovations was the Top 40 station, a concept that supposedly came from watching jukebox patrons\ncontinually play the same songs. [42] Robert Storz and Gordon McLendon began adapting existing radio\nstations to fit this new format with great success. In 1956, the creation of limited playlists further refined\nthe format by providing about 50 songs that disc jockeys played repeatedly every day. By the early 1960s,\nmany stations had developed limited playlists of only 30 songs. [43]\nAnother musically fruitful innovation came with the increase of black disc jockeys and programs created\nfor black audiences. Because its advertisers had nowhere to go in a media market dominated by white\nperformers, black radio became more common on the AM dial. As traditional programming left radio, disc\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n297 jockeys began to develop as the medium\u2019s new personalities, talking more in between songs and\ndeveloping followings. Early black disc jockeys even began improvising rhymes over top of the music,\npioneering techniques that later became rap and hip-hop. This new personality-driven style helped bring\nearly rock and roll to new audiences. [44]\nFM: The High-Fidelity Counterculture\nAs music came to rule the airwaves, FM radio drew in new listeners because of its high-fidelity sound\ncapabilities. When radio had primarily featured dramas and other talk-oriented formats, sound quality\nhad simply not mattered to many people, and the purchase of an FM receiver did not compete with the\npurchase of a new television in terms of entertainment value. As FM receivers decreased in price and\nstereo recording technology became more popular, however, the high-fidelity trend created a market for\nFM stations. Mostly affluent consumers began purchasing component stereos with the goal of getting the\nhighest sound quality possible out of their recordings. [45] Although this audience often preferred classical\nand jazz stations to Top 40 radio, they were tolerant of new music and ideas. [46]\nBoth the high-fidelity market and the growing youth counterculture of the 1960s had similar goals for the\nFM spectrum. Both groups eschewed AM radio because of the predictable programming, poor sound\nquality, and over-commercialization. Both groups wanted to treat music as an important experience\nrather than as just a trendy pastime or a means to make money. Many adherents to the youth\ncounterculture of the 1960s came from affluent, middle-class families, and their tastes came to define a\nnew era of consumer culture. The goals and market potential of both the high-fidelity lovers and the youth\ncounterculture created an atmosphere on the FM dial that had never before occurred. [47]\nBetween the years 1960 and 1966, the number of households capable of receiving FM transmissions grew\nfrom about 6.5 million to some 40 million. The FCC also aided FM by issuing its nonduplication ruling in\n1964. Before this regulation, many AM stations had other stations on the FM spectrum that simply\nduplicated the AM programming. The nonduplication rule forced FM stations to create their own fresh\nprogramming, opening up the spectrum for established networks to develop new stations. [48]\nThe late 1960s saw new disc jockeys taking greater liberties with established practices; these liberties\nincluded playing several songs in a row before going to a commercial break or airing album tracks that\nexceeded 10 minutes in length. University stations and other nonprofit ventures to which the FCC had\ngiven frequencies during the late 1940s popularized this format, and, in time, commercial stations tried to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n298 duplicate their success by playing fewer commercials and by allowing their disc jockeys to have a say in\ntheir playlists. Although this made for popular listening formats, FM stations struggled to make the kinds\nof profits that the AM spectrum drew. [49]\nIn 1974, FM radio accounted for one-third of all radio listening but only 14 percent of radio\nprofits. [50] Large network stations and advertisers began to market heavily to the FM audience in an\nattempt to correct this imbalance. Stations began tightening their playlists and narrowing their formats to\nplease advertisers and to generate greater revenues. By the end of the 1970s, radio stations were\nbeginning to play specific formats, and the progressive radio of the previous decade had become difficult\nto find. [51]\nThe Rise of Public Radio\nAfter the Golden Age of Radio came to an end, most listeners tuned in to radio stations to hear music. The\nvariety shows and talk-based programs that had sustained radio in early years could no longer draw\nenough listeners to make them a successful business proposition. One divergent path from this general\ntrend, however, was the growth of public radio.\nGroups such as the Ford Foundation had funded public media sources during the early 1960s. When the\nfoundation decided to withdraw its funding in the middle of the decade, the federal government stepped\nin with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This act created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting\n(CPB) and charged it with generating funding for public television and radio outlets. The CPB in turn\ncreated National Public Radio (NPR) in 1970 to provide programming for already-operating stations.\nUntil 1982, in fact, the CPB entirely and exclusively funded NPR. Public radio\u2019s first program was All\nThings Considered, an evening news program that focused on analysis and interpretive reporting rather\nthan cutting-edge coverage. In the mid-1970s, NPR attracted Washington-based journalists such as Cokie\nRoberts and Linda Wertheimer to its ranks, giving the coverage a more professional, hard-reporting\nedge. [52]\nHowever, in 1983, public radio was pushed to the brink of financial collapse. NPR survived in part by\nrelying more on its member stations to hold fundraising drives, now a vital component of public radio\u2019s\nbusiness model. In 2003, Joan Kroc, the widow of McDonald\u2019s CEO and philanthropist Ray Kroc,\nbequeathed a grant of over $200 million to NPR that may keep it afloat for many years to come.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n299 Having weathered the financial storm intact, NPR continued its progression as a respected news provider.\nDuring the first Gulf War, NPR sent out correspondents for the first time to provide in-depth coverage of\nunfolding events. Public radio\u2019s extensive coverage of the 2001 terrorist bombings gained its member\nstations many new listeners, and it has since expanded. [53] Although some have accused NPR of\npresenting the news with a liberal bias, its listenership in 2005 was 28 percent conservative, 32 percent\nliberal, and 29 percent moderate. Newt Gingrich, a conservative Republican and former speaker of the\nhouse, has stated that the network is \u201ca lot less on the left\u201d than some may believe. [54] With more than 26\nmillion weekly listeners and 860 member stations in 2009, NPR has become a leading radio news\nsource. [55]\nPublic radio distributors such as Public Radio International (PRI) and local public radio stations such as\nWBEZ in Chicago have also created a number of cultural and entertainment programs, including quiz\nshows, cooking shows, and a host of local public forum programs. Storytelling programs such as This\nAmerican Life have created a new kind of free-form radio documentary genre, while shows such as PRI\u2019s\nvariety show A Prairie Home Companion have revived older radio genres. This variety of popular public\nradio programming has shifted radio from a music-dominated medium to one that is again exploring its\nvast potential.\nConglomerates\nDuring the early 1990s, many radio stations suffered the effects of an economic recession. Some stations\ninitiated Local Marketing Agreements (LMAs) to share facilities and resources amid this economic\ndecline. LMAs led to consolidation in the industry as radio stations bought other stations to create new\nhubs for the same programming. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 further increased consolidation by\neliminating a duopoly rule prohibiting dual station ownership in the same market and by lifting the\nnumerical limits on station ownership by a single entity.\nAs large corporations such as Clear Channel Communications bought up stations around the country, they\nreformatted stations that had once competed against one another so that each focused on a different\nformat. This practice led to mainstream radio\u2019s present state, in which narrow formats target highly\nspecific demographic audiences.\nUltimately, although the industry consolidation of the 1990s made radio profitable, it reduced local\ncoverage and diversity of programming. Because stations around the country served as outlets for a single\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n300 network, the radio landscape became more uniform and predictable. [56] Much as with chain restaurants\nand stores, some people enjoy this type of predictability, while others prefer a more localized, unique\nexperience. [57]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The Golden Age of Radio covered the period between 1930 and 1950. It was characterized by radio\u2019s\noverwhelming popularity and a wide range of programming, including variety, music, drama, and theater\nprograms.\n\uf0b7 Top 40 radio arose after most nonmusic programming moved to television. This format used short\nplaylists of popular hits and gained a great deal of commercial success during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\uf0b7 FM became popular during the late 1960s and 1970s as commercial stations adopted the practices of\nfree-form stations to appeal to new audiences who desired higher fidelity and a less restrictive format.\n\uf0b7 Empowered by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, media conglomerates have subsumed\nunprecedented numbers of radio stations by single companies. Radio station consolidation brings\npredictability and profits at the expense of unique programming.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

Describe the use of radio station formats in the development of modern stations.\n2. Analyze the effects of formats on radio programming.\nEarly radio network programming laid the groundwork for television\u2019s format, with many different\nprograms that appealed to a variety of people broadcast at different times of the day. As television\u2019s\npopularity grew, however, radio could not compete and so it turned to fresh programming\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n305 techniques. A new type of format-driven station became the norm. Propelled by the development of\nnew types of music such as psychedelic rock and smooth jazz, the evolution of\nradio station formats took place. Since the beginning of this shift, different stations have tended to\nfocus on the music that certain demographics preferred. For example, many people raised on Top 40\nradio of the 1950s and 1960s did not necessarily want to hear modern pop hits, so stations playing\nolder popular songs emerged to meet their needs.\nModern formats take into account aging generations, with certain stations specifically playing the\npop hits of the 1950s and early 1960s, and others focusing on the pop hits of the late 1960s, 1970s,\nand 1980s. These formats have developed to target narrow, defined audiences with predictable tastes\nand habits. Ratings services such as Arbitron can identify the 10-year age demographic, the education\nlevel, and even the political leanings of listeners who prefer a particular format. Because advertisers\nwant their commercials to reach an audience likely to buy their products, this kind of audience\ntargeting is crucial for advertising revenue.\nTop Radio Formats\nThe following top radio formats and their respective statistics were determined by an Arbitron survey that\nwas released in 2010. [1] The most popular formats and subformats cover a wide range of demographics,\nrevealing radio\u2019s wide appeal.\nCountry\nCountry music as a format includes stations devoted both to older and newer country music. In 2010, the\ncountry music format stood as the most popular radio format, beating out even such prominent nonmusic\nformats as news and talk. The format commanded the greatest listener share and the second largest\nnumber of stations dedicated to the style. Favored in rural regions of the country, the country music\nformat\u2014featuring artists like Keith Urban, the Dixie Chicks, and Tim McGraw\u2014appeals to both male and\nfemale listeners from a variety of income levels. [2]\nNews/Talk/Information\nThe news/talk/information format includes AM talk radio, public radio stations with talk programming,\nnetwork news radio, sports radio, and personality talk radio. This format reached nearly 59 million\nlisteners in 2010, appealing particularly to those aged 65 and older; over 70 percent of its listeners had\nattended college. These listeners also ranked the highest among formats in levels of home ownership. [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n306 Adult Contemporary\nGenerally targeted toward individuals over 30, the adult contemporary (AC) format favors pop music\nfrom the last 15 to 20 years as opposed to current hits. Different subformats, such as hot AC and modern\nAC, target younger audiences by playing songs that are more current. In 2010, the majority of AC\naudience were affluent, married individuals divided roughly along the national average politically. Adult\ncontemporary listeners ranked highest by format in at-work listening. Hot AC, a subformat of AC that\nplays more current hits, ranked seventh in the nation. Urban AC, a version of AC that focuses on older\nR&B hits, ranked eighth in the nation in 2010. [4]\nPop Contemporary Hit Radio\nPop contemporary hit radio, or pop CHR, is a subformat of contemporary hit radio (CHR). Other\nsubformats of CHR include dance CHR and rhythmic CHR. Branded in the 1980s, this format\nencompasses stations that have a Top 40 orientation but draw on a wide number of formats, such as\ncountry, rock, and urban. [5] In 2010, pop CHR ranked first among teenaged listeners, with 65 percent of\nits overall listeners aged under 35. This music, ranging from popular artists like Taylor Swift and Kanye\nWest to Shakira, was played in the car more than at home or work and saw its largest listening times in\nthe evenings. Rhythmic CHR, a subformat focusing on a mix of rhythmic pop, R&B, dance, and hip-hop\nhits, also ranked high in 2010. [6]\nClassic Rock\nClassic rock stations generally play rock singles from the 1970s and 1980s, like \u201cStairway to Heaven,\u201d by\nLed Zeppelin, and \u201cYou Shook Me All Night Long,\u201d by AC/DC. Another distinct but similar format is\nalbum-oriented rock (AOR). This format focuses on songs that were not necessarily released as singles,\nalso known as album cuts. [7] In 2010, classic rock stations ranked fifth in listener figures. These\nindividuals were overwhelmingly men (70 percent) between the ages of 35 and 54 (54 percent). Classic\nrock was most often listened to in the car and at work, with only 26 percent of its listeners tuning in at\nhome. [8]\nUrban Contemporary\nThe urban contemporary format plays modern hits from mainly black artists\u2014such as Lil Wayne, John\nLegend, and Ludacris\u2014featuring a mix of soul, hip-hop, and R&B. In 2010, the format ranked eleventh in\nthe nation. Urban contemporary focuses on listeners in the 18\u201334 age range. [9]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n307 Mexican Regional\nThe Mexican regional format is devoted to Spanish-language music, particularly Mexican and South\nAmerican genres. In 2010, it ranked thirteenth in the nation and held the top spot in Los Angeles, a\nreflection of the rise in immigration from Mexico, Central America, and South America. Mexican\nregional\u2019s listener base was over 96 percent Hispanic, and the format was most popular in the Western\nand Southwestern regions of the country. However, it was less popular in the Eastern regions of the\ncountry; in New England, for example, the format held a zero percent share of listening. The rise of the\nMexican regional format illustrates the ways in which radio can change rapidly to meet new demographic\ntrends. [10]\nAn increasingly Spanish language\u2013speaking population in the United States has also resulted in a number\nof distinct Spanish-language radio formats. These include Spanish oldies, Spanish adult hits, Spanish\nreligious, Spanish tropical, and Spanish talk among others. Tejano, a type of music developed in Hispanic\nTexan communities, has also gained enough of an audience to become a dedicated format. [11]\nOther Popular Formats\nRadio formats have become so specialized that ratings group Arbitron includes more than 50\ndesignations. What was once simply called rock music has been divided into such subformats as\nalternative and modern rock. Alternative rock began as a format played on college stations during the\n1980s but developed as a mainstream format during the following decade, thanks in part to the popular\ngrunge music of that era. As this music aged, stations began using the term modern rock to describe a\nformat dedicated to new rock music. This format has also spawned the active rock format, which plays\nmodern rock hits with older rock hits thrown in. [12]\nNostalgia formats have split into a number of different formats as well. Oldies stations now generally\nfocus on hits from the 1950s and 1960s, while the classic hits format chooses from hits of the 1970s,\n1980s, and 1990s. Urban oldies, which focuses on R&B, soul, and other urban music hits from the 1950s,\n1960s, and 1970s, has also become a popular radio format. Formats such as adult hits mix older songs\nfrom the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a small selection of popular music, while formats such as \u201980s hits\npicks mainly from the 1980s. [13]\nRadio station formats are an interesting way to look at popular culture in the United States. The evolution\nof nostalgia formats to include new decades nods to the size and tastes of the nation\u2019s aging listeners. Hits\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n308 of the 1980s are popular enough with their demographic to have entire stations dedicated to them, while\nother generations prefer stations with a mix of decades. The rise of the country format and the continued\npopularity of the classic rock format are potential indicators of cultural trends.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Radio station formats target demographics that can generate advertising revenue.\n\uf0b7 Contemporary hit radio was developed as a Top 40 format that expanded beyond strictly pop music to\ninclude country, rock, and urban formats.\n\uf0b7 Spanish-language formats have grown in recent years, with Mexican regional moving into the top 10\nformats in 2008.\n\uf0b7 Nostalgia genres have developed to reflect the tastes of aging listeners, ranging from mixes of music from\nthe 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with current hits to formats that pick strictly from the 1980s.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Analyze radio as a form of mass media.\n2. Describe the effects of radio on the spread of different types of music.\n3. Analyze the effects of the Fairness Doctrine on political radio.\n4. Formulate opinions on controversial issues in radio.\nSince its inception, radio\u2019s impact on American culture has been immense. Modern popular culture\nis unthinkable without the early influence of radio. Entire genres of music that are now taken for\ngranted, such as country and rock, owe their popularity and even existence to early radio programs\nthat publicized new forms.\nA New Kind of Mass Media\nMass media such as newspapers had been around for years before the existence of radio. In fact, radio was\ninitially considered a kind of disembodied newspaper. Although this idea gave early proponents a useful,\nfamiliar way to think about radio, it underestimated radio\u2019s power as a medium. Newspapers had the\npotential to reach a wide audience, but radio had the potential to reach almost everyone. Neither illiteracy\nnor even a busy schedule impeded radio\u2019s success\u2014one could now perform an activity and listen to the\nradio at the same time. This unprecedented reach made radio an instrument of social cohesion as it\nbrought together members of different classes and backgrounds to experience the world as a nation.\nRadio programs reflected this nationwide cultural aspect of radio. Vox Pop, a show originally based on\nperson-in-the-street interviews, was an early attempt to quantify the United States\u2019 growing mass culture.\nBeginning in 1935, the program billed itself as an unrehearsed \u201ccross-section of what the average person\nreally knows\u201d by asking random people an assortment of questions. Many modern television shows still\nemploy this format not only for viewers\u2019 amusement and information but also as an attempt to sum up\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n310 national culture.[1] Vox Pop functioned on a cultural level as an acknowledgement of radio\u2019s entrance into\npeople\u2019s private lives to make them public. [2]\nRadio news was more than just a quick way to find out about events; it was a way for U.S. citizens to\nexperience events with the same emotions. During the Ohio and Mississippi river floods of 1937, radio\nbrought the voices of those who suffered as well as the voices of those who fought the rising tides. A West\nVirginia newspaper explained the strengths of radio in providing emotional voices during such crises:\n\u201cThanks to radio \u2026 the nation as a whole has had its nerves, its heart, its soul exposed to the needs of its\nunfortunates \u2026 We are a nation integrated and interdependent. We are \u2018our brother\u2019s keeper.\u2019\u201d [3]\nRadio\u2019s presence in the home also heralded the evolution of consumer culture in the United States. In\n1941, two-thirds of radio programs carried advertising. Radio allowed advertisers to sell products to a\ncaptive audience. This kind of mass marketing ushered in a new age of consumer culture. [4]\nWar of the Worlds and the Power of Radio\nDuring the 1930s, radio\u2019s impact and powerful social influence was perhaps most obvious in the aftermath\nof the Orson Welles\u2019s notorious War of the Worlds broadcast. On Halloween night in 1938, radio\nproducer Orson Welles told listeners of the Mercury Theatre on the Air that they would be treated to an\noriginal adaptation of H. G. Wells\u2019s classic science fiction novel of alien invasion War of the Worlds. The\nadaptation started as if it were a normal music show that was interrupted by news reports of an alien\ninvasion. Many listeners had tuned in late and did not hear the disclaimer, and so were caught up by the\nrealism of the adaptation, believing it to be an actual news story.\nAccording to some, an estimated 6 million people listened to the show, with an incredible 1.7 million\nbelieving it to be true. [5] Some listeners called loved ones to say goodbye or ran into the street armed with\nweapons to fight off the invading Martians of the radio play. [6] In Grovers Mill, New Jersey\u2014where the\nsupposed invasion began\u2014some listeners reported nonexistent fires and fired gunshots at a water tower\nthought to be a Martian landing craft. One listener drove through his own garage door in a rush to escape\nthe area. Two Princeton University professors spent the night searching for the meteorite that had\nsupposedly preceded the invasion. [7]As calls came in to local police stations, officers explained that they\nwere equally concerned about the problem. [8]\nAlthough the story of the War of the Worlds broadcast may be funny in retrospect, the event traumatized\nthose who believed the story. Individuals from every education level and walk of life had been taken in by\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n311 the program, despite the producers\u2019 warnings before, during the intermission, and after the\nprogram. [9] This event revealed the unquestioning faith that many Americans had in radio. Radio\u2019s\nintimate communication style was a powerful force during the 1930s and 1940s.\nRadio and the Development of Popular Music\nOne of radio\u2019s most enduring legacies is its impact on music. Before radio, most popular songs were\ndistributed through piano sheet music and word of mouth. This necessarily limited the types of music that\ncould gain national prominence. Although recording technology had also emerged several decades before\nradio, music played live over the radio sounded better than it did on a record played in the home. Live\nmusic performances thus became a staple of early radio. Many performance venues had their own radio\ntransmitters to broadcast live shows\u2014for example, Harlem\u2019s Cotton Club broadcast performances that\nCBS picked up and broadcast nationwide.\nRadio networks mainly played swing jazz, giving the bands and their leaders a widespread audience.\nPopular bandleaders including Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Tommy Dorsey and their jazz bands\nbecame nationally famous through their radio performances, and a host of other jazz musicians flourished\nas radio made the genre nationally popular. [10] National networks also played classical music. Often\npresented in an educational context, this programming had a different tenor than did dance-band\nprogramming. NBC promoted the genre through shows such as the Music Appreciation Hour, which\nsought to educate both young people and the general public on the nuances of classical music. [11] It\ncreated the NBC Symphony Orchestra, a 92-piece band under the direction of famed conductor Arturo\nToscanini. The orchestra made its first performance in 1937 and was so popular that Toscanini stayed on\nas conductor for 17 years. [12] The Metropolitan Opera was also popular; its broadcasts in the early 1930s\nhad an audience of 9 million listeners. [13]\nRegional Sounds Take Hold\nThe promotional power of radio also gave regional music an immense boost. Local stations often carried\ntheir own programs featuring the popular music of the area. Stations such as Nashville, Tennessee\u2019s WSM\nplayed early country, blues, and folk artists. The history of this station illustrates the ways in which\nradio\u2014and its wide range of broadcasting\u2014created new perspectives on American culture. In 1927,\nWSM\u2019s program Barn Dance, which featured early country music and blues, followed an hour-long\nprogram of classical music. George Hay, the host of Barn Dance, used the juxtaposition of classical and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n312 country genres to spontaneously rename the show: \u201cFor the past hour we have been listening to music\ntaken largely from Grand Opera, but from now on we will present \u2018The Grand Ole Opry.\u2019\u201d [14] NBC picked\nup the program for national syndication in 1939, and it is currently one of the longest-running radio\nprogram of all time.\nFigure 7.6\nThe Grand Ole Opry gave a national stage to country and early rock musicians.\nShreveport, Louisiana\u2019s KWKH aired an Opry-type show called Louisiana Hayride. This program\npropelled stars such as Hank Williams into the national spotlight. Country music, formerly a mix of folk,\nblues, and mountain music, was made into a genre that was accessible by the nation through this show.\nWithout programs that featured these country and blues artists, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash would not\nhave become national stars, and country music may not have risen to become a popular genre. [15]\nIn the 1940s, other Southern stations also began playing rhythm and blues records recorded by black\nartists. Artists such as Wynonie Harris, famous for his rendition of Roy Brown\u2019s \u201cGood Rockin\u2019 Tonight,\u201d\nwere often played by white disc jockeys who tried to imitate black Southerners. [16] During the late 1940s,\nboth Memphis, Tennessee\u2019s WDIA and Atlanta, Georgia\u2019s WERD were owned and operated by black\nindividuals. These disc jockeys often provided a measure of community leadership at a time when few\nblack individuals were in powerful positions. [17]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n313 Radio\u2019s Lasting Influences\nRadio technology changed the way that dance and popular music was performed. Because of the use of\nmicrophones, vocalists could be heard better over the band, allowing singers to use a greater vocal range\nand create more expressive styles, an innovation that led singers to become an important part of popular\nmusic\u2019s image. The use of microphones similarly allowed individual performers to be featured playing\nsolos and lead parts, features that were less encouraged before radio. The exposure of radio also led to\nmore rapid turnover in popular music. Before radio, jazz bands played the same arrangement for several\nyears without it getting old, but as radio broadcasts reached wide audiences, new arrangements and songs\nhad to be produced at a more rapid pace to keep up with changing tastes. [18]\nThe spotlight of radio allowed the personalities of artists to come to the forefront of popular music, giving\nthem newfound notoriety. Phil Harris, the bandleader from the Jack Benny Show, became the star of his\nown program. Other famous musicians used radio talent shows to gain fame. Popular programs such\nas Major Bowes and His Original Amateur Hour featured unknown entertainers trying to gain fame\nthrough exposure to the show\u2019s large audience. Major Bowes used a gong to usher bad performers\noffstage, often contemptuously dismissing them, but not all the performers struck out; such successful\nsingers as Frank Sinatra debuted on the program. [19]\nTelevision, much like modern popular music, owes a significant debt to the Golden Age of Radio. Major\nradio networks such as NBC, ABC, and CBS became\u2014and remain\u2014major forces in television, and their\nprogramming decisions for radio formed the basis for television. Actors, writers, and directors who\nworked in radio simply transferred their talents into the world of early television, using the successes of\nradio as their models.\nRadio and Politics\nOver the years, radio has had a considerable influence on the political landscape of the United States. In\nthe past, government leaders relied on radio to convey messages to the public, such as President Franklin\nD. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats.\u201d Radio was also used as a way to generate propaganda for World War II.\nThe War Department established a Radio Division in its Bureau of Public Relations as early as 1941.\nPrograms such as the Treasury Hour used radio drama to raise revenue through the sale of war bonds,\nbut other government efforts took a decidedly political turn. Norman Corwin\u2019s This Is War! was funded\nby the federal Office of Facts and Figures (OFF) to directly garner support for the war effort. It featured\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n314 programs that prepared listeners to make personal sacrifices\u2014including death\u2014to win the war. The\nprogram was also directly political, popularizing the idea that the New Deal was a success and bolstering\nRoosevelt\u2019s image through comparisons with Lincoln. [20]\nFDR\u2019s Fireside Chats\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Depression-era radio talks, or \u201cfireside chats,\u201d remain one of the most\nfamous uses of radio in politics. While governor of New York, Roosevelt had used radio as a political tool,\nso he quickly adopted it to explain the unprecedented actions that his administration was taking to deal\nwith the economic fallout of the Great Depression. His first speech took place only 1 week after being\ninaugurated. Roosevelt had closed all of the banks in the country for 4 days while the government dealt\nwith a national banking crisis, and he used the radio to explain his actions directly to the American\npeople. [21]\nRoosevelt\u2019s first radio address set a distinct tone as he employed informal speech in the hopes of inspiring\nconfidence in the American people and of helping them stave off the kind of panic that could have\ndestroyed the entire banking system. Roosevelt understood both the intimacy of radio and its powerful\noutreach. [22] He was thus able to balance a personal tone with a message that was meant for millions of\npeople. This relaxed approach inspired a CBS executive to name the series the \u201cfireside chats.\u201d [23]\nRoosevelt delivered a total of 27 of these 15- to 30-minute-long addresses to estimated audiences of 30\nmillion to 40 million people, then a quarter of the U.S. population. [24] Roosevelt\u2019s use of radio was both a\ntestament to his own skills and savvy as a politician and to the power and ubiquity of radio during this\nperiod. At the time, there was no other form of mass media that could have had the same effect.\nCertainly, radio has been used by the government for its own purposes, but it has had an even greater\nimpact on politics by serving as what has been called \u201cthe ultimate arena for free speech.\u201d [25] Such\ninfamous radio firebrands as Father Charles Coughlin, a Roman Catholic priest whose radio program\nopposed the New Deal, criticized Jews, and supported Nazi policies, aptly demonstrated this capability\nearly in radio\u2019s history. [26] In recent decades, radio has supported political careers, including those of U.S.\nSenator Al Franken of Minnesota, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, and presidential aspirant\nFred Thompson. Talk show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh have gained great political influence, with some\neven viewing Limbaugh as the de facto leader of the Republican Party. [27]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n315 The Importance of Talk Radio\nAn important contemporary convergence of radio and politics can be readily heard on modern talk radio\nprograms. Far from being simply chat shows, the talk radio that became popular in the 1980s features a\nhost who takes callers and discusses a wide assortment of topics. Talk radio hosts gain and keep their\nlisteners by sheer force of personality, and some say shocking or insulting things to get their message\nacross. These hosts range from conservative radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh to so-called shock jocks\nsuch as Howard Stern.\nRepeal of the Fairness Doctrine\nWhile talk radio first began during the 1920s, the emergence of the format as a contemporary cultural and\npolitical force took place during the mid- to late-1980s following the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine. [28] As\nyou read earlier in this chapter, this doctrine, established in 1949, required any station broadcasting a\npolitical point of view over the air to allow equal time to all reasonable dissenting views. Despite its noble\nintentions of safeguarding public airwaves for diverse views, the doctrine had long attracted a level of\ndissent. Opponents of the Fairness Doctrine claimed that it had a chilling effect on political discourse as\nstations, rather than risk government intervention, avoided programs that were divisive or\ncontroversial. [29] In 1987, the FCC under the Reagan administration repealed the regulation, setting the\nstage for an AM talk radio boom; by 2004, the number of talk radio stations had increased by 17-fold. [30]\nThe end of the Fairness Doctrine allowed stations to broadcast programs without worrying about finding\nan opposing point of view to balance the stated opinions of its host. Radio hosts representing all points of\nthe political spectrum could say anything that they wanted to\u2014within FCC limits\u2014without fear of\nrebuttal. Media bias and its ramifications will be explored at greater length in Chapter 14 \"Ethics of Mass\nMedia\".\nThe Revitilization of AM\nThe migration of music stations to the FM spectrum during the 1960s and 1970s provided a great deal of\nspace on the AM band for talk shows. With the Fairness Doctrine no longer a hindrance, these programs\nslowly gained notoriety during the late 1980 and early 1990s. In 1998, talk radio hosts railed against a\nproposed congressional pay increase, and their listeners became incensed; House Speaker Jim Wright\nreceived a deluge of faxes protesting it from irate talk radio listeners from stations all over the\ncountry. [31] Ultimately, Congress canceled the pay increase, and various print outlets acknowledged the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n316 influence of talk radio on the decision. Propelled by events such as these, talk radio stations rose from\nonly 200 in the early 1980s to more than 850 in 1994. [32]\nCoast to Coast AM\nAlthough political programs unquestionably rule AM talk radio, that dial is also home to a kind of show\nthat some radio listeners may have never experienced. Late at night on AM radio, a program airs during\nwhich listeners hear stories about ghosts, alien abductions, and fantastic creatures. It\u2019s not a fictional\ndrama program, however, but instead a call-in talk show called Coast to Coast AM. In 2006, this unlikely\nsuccess ranked among the top 10 AM talk radio programs in the nation\u2014a stunning feat considering its 10\np.m. to 2 a.m. time slot and bizarre format. [33]\nOriginally started by host Art Bell in the 1980s, Coast to Coast focuses on topics that mainstream media\noutlets rarely treat seriously. Regular guests include ghost investigators, psychics, Bigfoot biographers,\nalien abductees, and deniers of the moon landing. The guests take calls from listeners who are allowed to\nask questions or talk about their own paranormal experiences or theories.\nCoast to Coast\u2019s current host, George Noory, has continued the show\u2019s format. In some areas, its ratings\nhave even exceeded those of Rush Limbaugh\u2019s. [34] For a late-night show, these kinds of high ratings are\nrare. The success of Coast to Coast is thus a continuing testament to the diversity and unexpected\npotential of radio. [35]\nOn-Air Political Influence\nAs talk radio\u2019s popularity grew during the early 1990s, it quickly became an outlet for political ambitions.\nIn 1992, nine talk show hosts ran for U.S. Congress. By the middle of the decade, it had become common\nfor many former\u2014or failed\u2014politicians to attempt to use the format. Former California governor Jerry\nBrown and former New York mayor Ed Koch were among the mid-1990s politicians that had AM talk\nshows. [36] Both conservatives and liberals widely agree that conservative hosts dominate AM talk radio.\nMany talk show hosts, such as Limbaugh, who began his popular program 1 year after the repeal of the\nFairness Doctrine, have made a profitable business out of their programs.\nDuring the 2000s, AM talk radio continued to build. Hosts such as Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, and\nBill O\u2019Reilly furthered the trend of popular conservative talk shows, but liberal hosts also became popular\nthrough the short-lived Air America network. The network closed abruptly in 2010 amid financial\nconcerns. [37] Although the network was unsuccessful, it provided a platform for such hosts as MSNBC TV\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n317 news host Rachel Maddow and Minnesota Senator Al Franken. Other liberal hosts such as Bill Press and\nRon Reagan, son of President Ronald Reagan, have also found success in the AM political talk radio\nfield. [38] Despite these successes, liberal talk radio is often viewed as unsustainable. [39] To some, the\nfailure of Air America confirms conservatives\u2019 domination of AM radio. In response to the conservative\ndominance of talk radio, many prominent liberals, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have advocated\nreinstating the Fairness Doctrine and forcing stations to offer equal time to contrasting opinions. [40]\nFreedom of Speech and Radio Controversies\nWhile the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives radio personalities the freedom to say nearly\nanything they want on the air without fear of prosecution (except in cases of obscenity, slander, or\nincitement of violence, which will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 15 \"Media and Government\"),\nit does not protect them from being fired from their jobs when their controversial comments create a\npublic outrage. Many talk radio hosts, such as Howard Stern, push the boundaries of acceptable speech to\nengage listeners and boost ratings, but sometimes radio hosts push too far, unleashing a storm of\ncontroversy.\nMaking (and Unmaking) a Career out of Controversy\nTalk radio host Howard Stern has managed to build his career on creating controversy\u2014despite being\nfined multiple times for indecency by the FCC, Stern remains one of highest-paid and most popular talk\nradio hosts in the United States. Stern\u2019s radio broadcasts often feature scatalogical or sexual humor,\ncreating an \u201canything goes\u201d atmosphere. Because his on-air antics frequently generate controversy that\ncan jeopardize advertising sponsorships and drive away offended listeners\u2014in addition to risking fines\nfrom the FCC\u2014Stern has a history of uneasy relationships with the radio stations that employ him. In an\neffort to free himself of conflicts with station owners and sponsors, in 2005 Stern signed a contract with\nSirius Satellite Radio, which is exempt from FCC regulation, so that he can continue to broadcast his show\nwithout fear of censorship.\nStern\u2019s massive popularity gives him a lot of clout, which has allowed him to weather controversy and\ncontinue to have a successful career. Other radio hosts who have gotten themselves in trouble with poorly\nconsidered on-air comments have not been so lucky. In April 2007, Don Imus, host of the long-\nrunning Imus in the Morning, was suspended for racist and sexist comments made about the Rutgers\nUniversity women\u2019s basketball team. [41] Though he publically apologized, the scandal continued to draw\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n318 negative attention in the media, and CBS canceled his show to avoid further unfavorable publicity and the\nwithdrawal of advertisers. Though he returned to the airwaves in December of that year with a different\nstation, the episode was a major setback for Imus\u2019s career and his public image. Similarly, syndicated\nconservative talk show host Dr. Laura Schelssinger ended her radio show in 2010 due to pressure from\nradio stations and sponsors after her repeated use of a racial epithet on a broadcast incited a public\nbacklash. [42]\nAs the examples of these talk radio hosts show, the issue of freedom of speech on the airwaves is often\ncomplicated by the need for radio stations to be profitable. Outspoken or shocking radio hosts can draw in\nmany listeners, attracting advertisers to sponsor their shows and bringing in money for their radio\nstations. Although some listeners may be offended by these hosts and may stop tuning in, as long as the\nhosts continue to attract advertising dollars, their employers are usually content to allow the hosts to\nspeak freely on the air. However, if a host\u2019s behavior ends up sparking a major controversy, causing\nadvertisers to withdraw their sponsorship to avoid tarnishing their brands, the radio station will often fire\nthe host and look to someone who can better sustain advertising partnerships. Radio hosts\u2019 right to free\nspeech does not compel their employer to give them the forum to exercise it. Popular hosts like Don Imus\nmay find a home on the air again once the furor has died down, but for radio hosts concerned about the\nstability of their careers, the lesson is clear: there are practical limits on their freedom of speech.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Radio was unique as a form of mass media because it had the potential to reach anyone, even the\nilliterate. Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events home to\nthe listening public in a way that gave the nation a sense of unity.\n\uf0b7 Radio encouraged the growth of national popular music stars and brought regional sounds to wider\naudiences. The effects of early radio programs can be felt both in modern popular music and in television\nprogramming.\n\uf0b7 The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated that radio\nstations must give equal time to contrasting points of view on an issue. An enormous rise in the\npopularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.\n\uf0b7 The need for radio stations to generate revenue places practical limits on what radio personalities can say\non the air. Shock jocks like Howard Stern and Don Imus test, and sometimes exceed, these limits and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n319 become controversial figures, highlighting the tension between freedom of speech and the need for\nbusinesses to be profitable.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Distinguish the differences between satellite radio, HD radio, Internet radio, and podcasting.\n2. Identify the development of new radio technologies.\nAlthough the future of radio has been doubted many times throughout its history, it is still in\nexistence. The inherent portability of the medium gives it an advantage over other types of media\nthat require an individual\u2019s full attention, such as television or print. The simplicity of radio has leant\nitself to a variety of uses.\nIn recent years, new technologies have promised to expand the reach of radio and to expand the\nkinds of programming it offers. Satellite and HD radio have increased the amount and diversity of\navailable programming by making more stations available. Internet radio has increased the\naccessibility of radio communication, and practically anyone who has access to a computer can\ncreate subscription podcasts to distribute around the world. These new technologies promise to\nmake radio an enduring, innovative form of media.\nSatellite Radio\nIn 1998, the FCC awarded licenses to two businesses interested in creating a radio version of cable\ntelevision\u2014without the cables. This act was the beginning of satellite radio, and the companies soon\nbecame XM and Sirius. These two networks sold special receivers that could pick up satellite\ntransmissions broadcasting a wide range of formats on different channels to listeners who paid a monthly\nfee for the commercial-free programming.\nLike cable television, satellite radio was not required to censor its disc jockeys or guests for profanity. This\nattracted somewhat controversial radio personalities known for their conflicts with the FCC, such as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n323 Howard Stern and Opie and Anthony. The networks also drew hosts such as NPR\u2019s Bob Edwards and\nBruce Springsteen\u2019s guitarist \u201cLittle\u201d Steven Van Zandt to create their own shows. Because listeners paid\none price for access to all of the channels, disc jockeys experienced less pressure to adhere to the limited\nplaylist style of programming that was the norm for terrestrial radio stations. [1] In 2008, Sirius and XM\nmerged to form Sirius XM. In 2010, the company recorded its first profits. [2]\nHD Radio\nDeveloped around 2001 to help terrestrial radio stations compete with emerging satellite radio\ntechnology, HD radio is essentially a digital transmission of radio signals resulting in less static and better\nsound quality, even for AM stations. Upgraded quality is not the major benefit of HD radio, however; the\ntechnology allows signals to be compressed so that one station can air so-called shadow stations on the\nsame frequency as its regular broadcast. Although listeners need an HD radio to receive these channels,\nthey pay no subscription fee, as independent stations provide their own programming as they deem\nnecessary. [3]\nStations such as NPR\u2019s WAMU in Washington, DC, broadcast different types of programming on their\nshadow channels. For example, the station\u2019s 88.5-1 broadcasts the regular analog schedule of WAMU,\nwhile 88.5-2 broadcasts bluegrass and country music programming, and 88.5-3 broadcasts public radio\nprograms not available on the analog version of 88.5. [4]\nHD radio allows current broadcasters to provide content that they would normally put aside in favor of\nmore commercial programs. WAMU\u2019s bluegrass and country shadow station plays content originally\nplayed over the airwaves but relegated to the Internet in favor of more marketable programs. The\ninnovation of HD radio allowed the station to reintroduce the programs without risking its financial\nstability. With this financial freedom, HD radio offers a host of programming possibilities for traditional\nradio.\nInternet Radio and Podcasting\nBroadcasting is both a strength and limitation of broadcasting. Although technological advances of the\npast 50 years, such as audio recorders and microphones, have made creating a radio program simple,\nfinding a way to broadcast that program presents difficulties for the average person. The expansion of the\nInternet, however, has changed this limitation into a manageable hurdle for both businesses and\nindividuals alike.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n324 Internet Radio\nAt its core, Internet radio is simply the streaming of audio programs through the medium of the Internet.\nAs early as 1994, radio stations such as Chapel Hill, North Carolina\u2019s WXYC were broadcasting their\nsignal over the Internet, and so potentially gaining a worldwide audience. [5] Soon, online-only radio\nstations were created to broadcast programs. Services such as Live 365, founded in 1999, have acted as\ndistributors for Internet radio programs, charging broadcasters fees to stream their programs to a large\nlistening audience.\nAnother type of Internet radio service is Pandora radio. This radio website does not distribute existing\nprograms but rather allows users to create their own custom music radio stations. A listener creates a\nPandora account and types in a song, composer, or artist, and the service creates a station that plays songs\nthat are similar to the user\u2019s selection. This analysis of music attempts to collect as many details about a\nsong as possible, from lyrics to instrumentation to harmony, and then categorizes songs according to\nthese attributes, making it possible for listeners to customize their own stations based on one or more of\nthe cataloged attributes. The listener can delete unwanted songs from the playlist and create new stations\nas well. Pandora currently relies on on-screen advertising and has implemented audio advertisements as\nwell. [6] Other music services such as Yahoo! Music, AOL Radio, and Jango offer radio stations with\nmultiple programmed genres.\nProblems of Internet Broadcasting\nDespite the rise of Internet radio over the past several years, its success has never been a sure thing. As\nthe trend gained momentum, many inexperienced broadcasters confronted the issue of royalties, and\nmany experienced broadcasters encountered new legal issues related to streaming. Stations that broadcast\nover the airwaves must pay publishing royalties to the musicians and songwriters behind the recordings.\nRather than pay an individual musician or songwriter each time a recording is played, however,\nbroadcasters\u2014including radio station, coffee shops, and restaurants\u2014pay for a blanket license that allows\nthem to play any song. As Internet broadcasting grew, musicians and record labels began demanding\nroyalties from Internet stations and specifying new licensing restrictions. For instance, Pandora radio\u2019s\nlicense specifies that users can buy a song, but they can\u2019t replay a song without purchasing it, nor can they\nskip more than six songs per hour.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n325 Other issues arose as terrestrial stations began streaming on the Internet. Since its inception, the medium\nhas struggled with such concerns as whether advertisers should pay for commercials played over the\nInternet as well as over the air and what types of licenses should be used for Internet radio stations. In\ntime, the federal government mediated an agreement between broadcasters and record companies with\nthe Webcasters Settlement Act of 2009. This legislation designated Internet-only stations as pure-play\nstations, dividing them according to the types of coverage they offer. Each category pays royalties in\ndifferent ways, ensuring both fair compensation for artists and the future viability of Internet radio. [7]\nPodcasting\nUnlike Internet radio, podcasting employs downloadable rather than streamed programs. The\nterm podcasting itself stems from the use of MP3 players such as Apple\u2019s iPod to use programs on\ndemand. Many terrestrial stations have employed podcasting to supplement their traditional over-the-air\nbroadcasting. Because these are single programs rather than continuous stations, podcasts are an easier\nmedium to produce than is Internet radio.\nSome podcast producers, such as Mignon Fogarty, have created programs that led to book deals and a\nsteady income. Fogarty\u2019s weekly Grammar Girl: Quick and Dirty Tricks podcast focuses on simple\ngrammar rules. Within a year of its inception, this podcast racked up 1 million downloads and received\nnational acclaim. [8] Nevertheless, podcasting does not fit neatly into the traditional concept of radio. Yet,\nthere is no question that it is following in the footsteps of past radio programs, and that it provides a\npotential vision of the medium\u2019s place in years to come. Just as radio evolved from a medium for soap\noperas and live music to talk shows and recorded music, podcasts are a window into what radio may\nevolve into in the future.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Radio\u2019s flexibility as a medium has allowed it to adjust to the fluctuations of audience tastes and markets.\n\uf0b7 Satellite radio is a subscription-based service, while HD radio is provided at no cost by current radio\nproviders.\n\uf0b7 Internet radio and podcasting have allowed many new programs and stations to be broadcast at low cost.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Avatar grossed over\n$1.8 billion in theaters worldwide, $1.35 billion from 3-D sales alone. [1] Following in that vein, dozens of\nother movie studios released 3-D films, resulting in lesser box office successes such as Alice in\nWonderland, Clash of the Titans, and Shrek Forever After. Many film reviewers and audiences seemed\nadamant\u20143-D movies were the wave of the future.\nHowever, could this eye-popping technology actually ruin our moviegoing experience? Brian Moylan, a\ncritic for Gawker.com, argues that it already has. The problem with 3-D, he says, is that \u201cIt is so mind-\nnumbingly amazing that narrative storytelling hasn\u2019t caught up with the technology. The corporate\nscreenwriting borgs are so busy trying to come up with plot devices to highlight all the newfangled\nwhoosiwhatsits\u2014objects being hurled at the audience, flying sequences, falling leaves, glowing Venus\nFlytraps\u2014that no one is really bothering to tell a tale.\u201d [2]\nJames Cameron, director of Avatar, agrees. \u201c[Studios] think, \u2018what was [sic] the takeaway lessons\nfrom Avatar? Oh you should make more money with 3-D.\u2019 They ignore the fact that we natively authored\nthe film in 3-D, and [they] decide that what we accomplished in several years of production could be done\nin an eight week (post-production 3-D) conversion [such as] with Clash of the Titans.\u201d[3] Cameron makes\nthe following point: While recent films such as Avatar (2009) and Beowulf (2007) were created\nexclusively for 3-D, many other filmmakers have converted their movies to 3-D after filming was already\ncomplete. Clash of the Titans is widely criticized because its 3-D effects were quickly added in\npostproduction. [4]\nWhat effect does this have on audiences? Aside from the complaints of headaches and nausea (and the\nfact that some who wear glasses regularly can find it uncomfortable or even impossible to wear 3-D\nglasses on top of their own), many say that the new technology simply makes movies looks worse. The\nfilm critic Roger Ebert has continuously denounced the technology, noting that movies such as The Last\nAirbender look like they\u2019re \u201cfilmed with a dirty sheet over the lens.\u201d [5] 3-D technology can cause a movie\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n330 to look fuzzier, darker, and generally less cinematically attractive. However, movie studios are finding 3-D\nfilms attractive for another reason.\nBecause seeing a movie in 3-D is considered a \u201cpremium\u201d experience, consumers are expected to pay\nhigher prices. And with the increasing popularity of IMAX 3D films, many moviegoers were amazed by\nthe 3-D film Avatar 3-D, tickets may surpass $20 per person. [6] This gives 3-D films an advantage over 2-\nD ones as audiences are willing to pay more to do so.\nThe recent 3-D boom has often been compared to the rise of color film in the early 1950s. However, some\nmaintain that it\u2019s just a fad. Will 3-D technology affect the future of filmmaking?

Identify key points in the development of the motion picture industry.\n2. Identify key developments of the motion picture industry and technology.\n3. Identify influential films in movie history.\nThe movie industry as we know it today originated in the early 19th century through a series of\ntechnological developments: the creation of photography, the discovery of the illusion of motion by\ncombining individual still images, and the study of human and animal locomotion. The history\npresented here begins at the culmination of these technological developments, where the idea of the\nmotion picture as an entertainment industry first emerged. Since then, the industry has seen\nextraordinary transformations, some driven by the artistic visions of individual participants, some by\ncommercial necessity, and still others by accident. The history of the cinema is complex, and for\nevery important innovator and movement listed here, others have been left out. Nonetheless, after\nreading this section you will understand the broad arc of the development of a medium that has\ncaptured the imaginations of audiences worldwide for over a century.\nThe Beginnings: Motion Picture Technology of the Late 19th Century\nWhile the experience of watching movies on smartphones may seem like a drastic departure from the\ncommunal nature of film viewing as we think of it today, in some ways the small-format, single-viewer\ndisplay is a return to film\u2019s early roots. In 1891, the inventor Thomas Edison, together with William\nDickson, a young laboratory assistant, came out with what they called the kinetoscope, a device that would\nbecome the predecessor to the motion picture projector. The kinetoscope was a cabinet with a window\nthrough which individual viewers could experience the illusion of a moving image. [1] [2] A\nperforated celluloid film strip with a sequence of images on it was rapidly spooled between a lightbulb and\na lens, creating the illusion of motion. [3] The images viewers could see in the kinetoscope captured events\nand performances that had been staged at Edison\u2019s film studio in East Orange, New Jersey, especially for\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n332 the Edison kinetograph (the camera that produced kinetoscope film sequences): circus performances,\ndancing women, cockfights, boxing matches, and even a tooth extraction by a dentist. [4]\nFigure 8.2\nThe Edison kinetoscope.\nAs the kinetoscope gained popularity, the Edison Company began installing machines in hotel lobbies,\namusement parks, and penny arcades, and soon kinetoscope parlors\u2014where customers could pay around\n25 cents for admission to a bank of machines\u2014had opened around the country. However, when friends\nand collaborators suggested that Edison find a way to project his kinetoscope images for audience\nviewing, he apparently refused, claiming that such an invention would be a less profitable venture. [5]\nBecause Edison hadn\u2019t secured an international patent for his invention, variations of the kinetoscope\nwere soon being copied and distributed throughout Europe. This new form of entertainment was an\ninstant success, and a number of mechanics and inventors, seeing an opportunity, began toying with\nmethods of projecting the moving images onto a larger screen. However, it was the invention of two\nbrothers, Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re\u2014photographic goods manufacturers in Lyon, France\u2014that saw the\nmost commercial success. In 1895, the brothers patented the Cin\u00e9matographe (from which we get the\ntermcinema), a lightweight film projector that also functioned as a camera and printer. Unlike the Edison\nkinetograph, the Cin\u00e9matographe was lightweight enough for easy outdoor filming, and over the years the\nbrothers used the camera to take well over 1,000 short films, most of which depicted scenes from\neveryday life. In December 1895, in the basement lounge of the Grand Caf\u00e9, Rue des Capucines in Paris,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n333 the Lumi\u00e8res held the world\u2019s first ever commercial film screening, a sequence of about 10 short scenes,\nincluding the brother\u2019s first film, Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory, a segment lasting less than a\nminute and depicting workers leaving the family\u2019s photographic instrument factory at the end of the day,\nas shown in the still frame here in Figure 8.3. [6]\nBelieving that audiences would get bored watching scenes that they could just as easily observe on a\ncasual walk around the city, Louis Lumi\u00e8re claimed that the cinema was \u201can invention without a\nfuture,\u201d [7] but a demand for motion pictures grew at such a rapid rate that soon representatives of the\nLumi\u00e8re company were traveling throughout Europe and the world, showing half-hour screenings of the\ncompany\u2019s films. While cinema initially competed with other popular forms of entertainment\u2014circuses,\nvaudeville acts, theater troupes, magic shows, and many others\u2014eventually it would supplant these\nvarious entertainments as the main commercial attraction. [8] Within a year of the Lumi\u00e8res\u2019 first\ncommercial screening, competing film companies were offering moving-picture acts in music halls and\nvaudeville theaters across Great Britain. In the United States, the Edison Company, having purchased the\nrights to an improved projecter that they called the Vitascope, held their first film screening in April 1896\nat Koster and Bial\u2019s Music Hall in Herald Square, New York City.\nFilm\u2019s profound impact on its earliest viewers is difficult to imagine today, inundated as many are by\nvideo images. However, the sheer volume of reports about the early audience\u2019s disbelief, delight, and even\nfear at what they were seeing suggests that viewing a film was an overwhelming experience for many.\nSpectators gasped at the realistic details in films such as Robert Paul\u2019s Rough Sea at Dover, and at times\npeople panicked and tried to flee the theater during films in which trains or moving carriages sped toward\nthe audience. [9] Even the public\u2019s perception of film as a medium was considerably different from the\ncontemporary understanding; the moving image was an improvement upon the photograph\u2014a medium\nwith which viewers were already familiar\u2014and this is perhaps why the earliest films documented events in\nbrief segments but didn\u2019t tell stories. During this \u201cnovelty period\u201d of cinema, audiences were more\ninterested by the phenomenon of the film projector itself, so vaudeville halls advertised the kind of the\nprojector they were using (for example, \u201cThe Vitascope\u2014Edison\u2019s Latest Marvel\u201d) [10], rather than the\nnames of the films. [11]\nBy the close of the 19th century, as public excitement over the moving picture\u2019s novelty gradually wore off,\nfilmmakers were also beginning to experiment with film\u2019s possibilities as a medium in itself (not simply,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n334 as it had been regarded up until then, as a tool for documentation, analogous to the camera or the\nphonograph). Technical innovations allowed filmmakers like Parisian cinema owner Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s to\nexperiment with special effects that produced seemingly magical transformations on screen: flowers\nturned into women, people disappeared with puffs of smoke, a man appeared where a woman had just\nbeen standing, and other similar tricks. [12]\nNot only did M\u00e9li\u00e8s, a former magician, invent the \u201ctrick film,\u201d which producers in England and the\nUnited States began to imitate, but he was also the one to transform cinema into the narrative medium it\nis today. Whereas before, filmmakers had only ever created single-shot films that lasted a minute or less,\nM\u00e9li\u00e8s began joining these short films together to create stories. His 30-sceneTrip to the Moon (1902), a\nfilm based on a Jules Verne novel, may have been the most widely seen production in cinema\u2019s first\ndecade. [13] However, M\u00e9li\u00e8s never developed his technique beyond treating the narrative film as a staged\ntheatrical performance; his camera, representing the vantage point of an audience facing a stage, never\nmoved during the filming of a scene. In 1912, M\u00e9li\u00e8s released his last commercially successful\nproduction, The Conquest of the Pole, and from then on, he lost audiences to filmmakers who were\nexperimenting with more sophisticated techniques. [14]\nFigure 8.4\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019 Trip to the Moon was one of the first films to incorporate fantasy elements and to use \u201ctrick\u201d filming\ntechniques, both of which heavily influenced future filmmakers.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n335 The Nickelodeon Craze (1904\u20131908)\nOne of these innovative filmmakers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist and engineer for the Edison\nCompany. Porter\u2019s 12-minute film, The Great Train Robbery (1903), broke with the stagelike\ncompositions of M\u00e9li\u00e8s-style films through its use of editing, camera pans, rear projections, and\ndiagonally composed shots that produced a continuity of action. Not only did The Great Train\nRobbery establish the realistic narrative as a standard in cinema, it was also the first major box-office hit.\nIts success paved the way for the growth of the film industry, as investors, recognizing the motion\npicture\u2019s great moneymaking potential, began opening the first permanent film theaters around the\ncountry.\nKnown as nickelodeons because of their 5 cent admission charge, these early motion picture theaters,\noften housed in converted storefronts, were especially popular among the working class of the time, who\ncouldn\u2019t afford live theater. Between 1904 and 1908, around 9,000 nickelodeons appeared in the United\nStates. It was the nickelodeon\u2019s popularity that established film as a mass entertainment medium. [15]\nThe \u201cBiz\u201d: The Motion Picture Industry Emerges\nAs the demand for motion pictures grew, production companies were created to meet it. At the peak of\nnickelodeon popularity in 1910, [16] there were 20 or so major motion picture companies in the United\nStates. However, heated disputes often broke out among these companies over patent rights and industry\ncontrol, leading even the most powerful among them to fear fragmentation that would loosen their hold\non the market. [17] Because of these concerns, the 10 leading companies\u2014including Edison, Biograph,\nVitagraph, and others\u2014formed the Motion Picture Patents Company (MPPC) in 1908. The MPPC was a\ntrade group that pooled the most significant motion picture patents and established an exclusive contract\nbetween these companies and the Eastman Kodak Company as a supplier of film stock. Also known as the\nTrust, the MPPC\u2019s goal was to standardize the industry and shut out competition through monopolistic\ncontrol. Under the Trust\u2019s licensing system, only certain licensed companies could participate in the\nexchange, distribution, and production of film at different levels of the industry\u2014a shut-out tactic that\neventually backfired, leading the excluded, independent distributors to organize in opposition to the\nTrust. [18]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n336 The Rise of the Feature\nIn these early years, theaters were still running single-reel films, which came at a standard length of 1,000\nfeet, allowing for about 16 minutes of playing time. However, companies began to import multiple-reel\nfilms from European producers around 1907, and the format gained popular acceptance in the United\nStates in 1912 with Louis Mercanton\u2019s highly successful Queen Elizabeth, a three-and-a-half reel \u201cfeature,\u201d\nstarring the French actress Sarah Bernhardt. As exhibitors began to show more features\u2014as the multiple-\nreel film came to be called\u2014they discovered a number of advantages over the single-reel short. For one\nthing, audiences saw these longer films as special events and were willing to pay more for admission, and\nbecause of the popularity of the feature narratives, features generally experienced longer runs in theaters\nthan their single-reel predecessors. [19] Additionally, the feature film gained popularity among the middle\nclasses, who saw its length as analogous to the more \u201crespectable\u201d entertainment of live\ntheater. [20] Following the example of the French film d\u2019art, U.S. feature producers often took their\nmaterial from sources that would appeal to a wealthier and better educated audience, such as histories,\nliterature, and stage productions. [21]\nAs it turns out, the feature film was one factor that brought about the eventual downfall of the MPPC. The\ninflexible structuring of the Trust\u2019s exhibition and distribution system made the organization resistant to\nchange. When movie studio, and Trust member, Vitagraph began to release features like A Tale of Two\nCities (1911) and Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin (1910), the Trust forced it to exhibit the films serially in single-reel\nshowings to keep with industry standards. The MPPC also underestimated the appeal of the star system, a\ntrend that began when producers chose famous stage actors like Mary Pickford and James O\u2019Neill to play\nthe leading roles in their productions and to grace their advertising posters. [22] Because of the MPPC\u2019s\ninflexibility, independent companies were the only ones able to capitalize on two important trends that\nwere to become film\u2019s future: single-reel features and star power. Today, few people would recognize\nnames like Vitagraph or Biograph, but the independents that outlasted them\u2014Universal, Goldwyn (which\nwould later merge with Metro and Mayer), Fox (later 20th Century Fox), and Paramount (the later\nversion of the Lasky Corporation)\u2014have become household names.\nHollywood\nAs movie going increased in popularity among the middle class, and as the feature films began keeping\naudiences in their seats for longer periods of time, exhibitors found a need to create more comfortable and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n337 richly decorated theater spaces to attract their audiences. These \u201cdream palaces,\u201d so called because of\ntheir often lavish embellishments of marble, brass, guilding, and cut glass, not only came to replace the\nnickelodeon theater, but also created the demand that would lead to the Hollywood studio system. Some\nproducers realized that the growing demand for new work could only be met if the films were produced on\na regular, year-round system. However, this was impractical with the current system that often relied on\noutdoor filming and was predominately based in Chicago and New York\u2014two cities whose weather\nconditions prevented outdoor filming for a significant portion of the year. Different companies attempted\nfilming in warmer locations such as Florida, Texas, and Cuba, but the place where producers eventually\nfound the most success was a small, industrial suburb of Los Angeles called Hollywood.\nHollywood proved to be an ideal location for a number of reasons. Not only was the climate temperate\nand sunny year-round, but land was plentiful and cheap, and the location allowed close access to a\nnumber of diverse topographies: mountains, lakes, desert, coasts, and forests. By 1915, more than 60\npercent of U.S. film production was centered in Hollywood. [23]\nThe Art of Silent Film\nWhile the development of narrative film was largely driven by commercial factors, it is also important to\nacknowledge the role of individual artists who turned it into a medium of personal expression. The motion\npicture of the silent era was generally simplistic in nature; acted in overly animated movements to engage\nthe eye; and accompanied by live music, played by musicians in the theater, and written titles to create a\nmood and to narrate a story. Within the confines of this medium, one filmmaker in particular emerged to\ntransform the silent film into an art and to unlock its potential as a medium of serious expression and\npersuasion. D. W. Griffith, who entered the film industry as an actor in 1907, quickly moved to a directing\nrole in which he worked closely with his camera crew to experiment with shots, angles, and editing\ntechniques that could heighten the emotional intensity of his scenes. He found that by practicing\nparallel editing, in which a film alternates between two or more scenes of action, he could create an\nillusion of simultaneity. He could then heighten the tension of the film\u2019s drama by alternating between\ncuts more and more rapidly until the scenes of action converged. Griffith used this technique to great\neffect in his controversial film The Birth of a Nation, which will be discussed in greater detail later on in\nthis chapter. Other techniques that Griffith employed to new effect included panning shots, through which\nhe was able to establish a sense of scene and to engage his audience more fully in the experience of the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n338 film, and tracking shots, or shots that traveled with the movement of a scene, [24]which allowed the\naudience\u2014through the eye of the camera\u2014to participate in the film\u2019s action.\nMPAA: Combating Censorship\nAs film became an increasingly lucrative U.S. industry, prominent industry figures like D. W. Griffith,\nslapstick comedian/director Charlie Chaplin, and actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks grew\nextremely wealthy and influential. Public attitudes toward stars and toward some stars\u2019 extravagant\nlifestyles were divided, much as they are today: On the one hand, these celebrities were idolized and\nimitated in popular culture, yet at the same time, they were criticized for representing a threat, on and off\nscreen, to traditional morals and social order. And much as it does today, the news media liked to\nsensationalize the lives of celebrities to sell stories. Comedian Roscoe \u201cFatty\u201d Arbuckle, who worked\nalongside future icons Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, was at the center of one of the biggest scandals\nof the silent era. When Arbuckle hosted a marathon party over Labor Day weekend in 1921, one of his\nguests, model Virginia Rapp, was rushed to the hospital, where she later died. Reports of a drunken orgy,\nrape, and murder surfaced. Following World War I, the United States was in the middle of significant\nsocial reforms, such as Prohibition. Many feared that movies and their stars could threaten the moral\norder of the country. Because of the nature of the crime and the celebrity involved, these fears became\ninexplicably tied to the Artbuckle case. [25] Even though autopsy reports ruled that Rapp had died from\ncauses for which Arbuckle could not be blamed, the comedian was tried (and acquitted) for manslaughter,\nand his career was ruined.\nThe Arbuckle affair and a series of other scandals only increased public fears about Hollywood\u2019s impact.\nIn response to this perceived threat, state and local governments increasingly tried to censor the content\nof films that depicted crime, violence, and sexually explicit material. Deciding that they needed to protect\nthemselves from government censorship and to foster a more favorable public image, the major\nHollywood studios organized in 1922 to form an association they called the Motion Picture Producers and\nDistributers of America (later renamed the Motion Picture Association of America, orMPAA). Among\nother things, the MPAA instituted a code of self-censorship for the motion picture industry. Today, the\nMPAA operates by a voluntary rating system, which means producers can voluntarily submit a film for\nreview, which is designed to alert viewers to the age-apropriateness of a film, while still protecting the\nfilmmakers\u2019 artistic freedom. [26]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n339 Silent Film\u2019s Demise\nIn 1925, Warner Bros. was just a small Hollywood studio looking for opportunities to expand. When\nrepresentatives from Western Electric offered to sell the studio the rights to a new technology they called\nVitaphone, a sound-on-disc system that had failed to capture the interest of any of the industry giants,\nWarner Bros. executives took a chance, predicting that the novelty of talking films might be a way to make\na quick, short-term profit. Little did they anticipate that their gamble would not only establish them as a\nmajor Hollywood presence but also change the industry forever.\nThe pairing of sound with motion pictures was nothing new in itself. Edison, after all, had commisioned\nthe kinetoscope to create a visual accompaniment to the phonograph, and many early theaters had\norchestra pits to provide musical accompaniment to their films. Even the smaller picture houses with\nlower budgets almost always had an organ or piano. When Warner Bros. purchased Vitaphone\ntechnology, it planned to use it to provide prerecorded orchestral accompaniment for its films, thereby\nincreasing their marketability to the smaller theaters that didn\u2019t have their own orchestra pits. [27] In 1926,\nWarner debuted the system with the release of Don Juan, a costume drama accompanied by a recording\nof the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; the public responded enthusiastically. [28] By 1927, after a $3\nmillion campaign, Warner Bros. had wired more than 150 theaters in the United States, and it released its\nsecond sound film, The Jazz Singer, in which the actor Al Jolson improvised a few lines of synchronized\ndialogue and sang six songs. The film was a major breakthrough. Audiences, hearing an actor speak on\nscreen for the first time, were enchanted.[29] While radio, a new and popular entertainment, had been\ndrawing audiences away from the picture houses for some time, with the birth of the \u201ctalkie,\u201d or talking\nfilm, audiences once again returned to the cinema in large numbers, lured by the promise of seeing and\nhearing their idols perform. [30] By 1929, three-fourths of Hollywood films had some form of sound\naccompaniment, and by 1930, the silent film was a thing of the past. [31]\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Think We\u2019re in Kansas Anymore\u201d: Film Goes Technicolor\nAlthough the techniques of tinting and hand painting had been available methods for adding color to films\nfor some time (Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, for instance, employed a crew to hand-paint many of his films), neither\nmethod ever caught on. The hand-painting technique became impractical with the advent of mass-\nproduced film, and the tinting process, which filmmakers discovered would create an interference with\nthe transmission of sound in films, was abandoned with the rise of the talkie. However, in 1922, Herbert\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n340 Kalmus\u2019 Technicolor company introduced a dye-transfer technique that allowed it to produce a full-length\nfilm, The Toll of the Sea, in two primary colors. [32] However, because only two colors were used, the\nappearance of The Toll of the Sea (1922), The Ten Commandments (1923), and other early Technicolor\nfilms was not very lifelike. By 1932, Technicolor had designed a three-color system with more realistic\nresults, and for the next 25 years, all color films were produced with this improved system. Disney\u2019s Three\nLittle Pigs (1933) and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves (1936) and films with live actors, like\nMGM\u2019s The Wizard of Oz(1939) and Gone With the Wind (1939), experienced early success using\nTechnicolor\u2019s three-color method.\nDespite the success of certain color films in the 1930s, Hollywood, like the rest of the United States, was\nfeeling the impact of the Great Depression, and the expenses of special cameras, crews, and Technicolor\nlab processing made color films impractical for studios trying to cut costs. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t until the\nend of the 1940s that Technicolor would largely displace the black-and-white film.[33]\nRise and Fall of the Hollywood Studio\nThe spike in theater attendance that followed the introduction of talking films changed the economic\nstructure of the motion picture industry, bringing about some of the largest mergers in industry history.\nBy 1930, eight studios produced 95 percent of all American films, and they continued to experience\ngrowth even during the Depression. The five most influential of these studios\u2014Warner Bros., Metro-\nGoldwyn-Mayer, RKO, 20th Century Fox, and Paramount\u2014were vertically integrated; that is, they\ncontrolled every part of the system as it related to their films, from the production, to release, distribution,\nand even viewing. Because they owned theater chains worldwide, these studios controlled which movies\nexhibitors ran, and because they \u201cowned\u201d a stock of directors, actors, writers, and technical assistants by\ncontract, each studio produced films of a particular character.\nThe late 1930s and early 1940s are sometimes known as the \u201cGolden Age\u201d of cinema, a time of\nunparalleled success for the movie industry; by 1939, film was the 11th-largest industry in the United\nStates, and during World War II, when the U.S. economy was once again flourishing, two-thirds of\nAmericans were attending the theater at least once a week. [34] Some of the most acclaimed movies in\nhistory where released during this period, including Citizen Kane andThe Grapes of Wrath. However,\npostwar inflation, a temporary loss of key foreign markets, the advent of the television, and other factors\ncombined to bring that rapid growth to an end. In 1948, the case of the United States v. Paramount\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n341 Pictures\u2014mandating competition and forcing the studios to relinquish control over theater chains\u2014dealt\nthe final devastating blow from which the studio system would never recover. Control of the major studios\nreverted to Wall Street, where the studios were eventually absorbed by multinational corporations, and\nthe powerful studio heads lost the influence they had held for nearly 30 years. [35]\nFigure 8.5\nRise and Decline of Movie Viewing During Hollywood\u2019s \u201cGolden Age\u201d\nPost\u2013World War II: Television Presents a Threat\nWhile economic factors and antitrust legislation played key roles in the decline of the studio system,\nperhaps the most important factor in that decline was the advent of the television. Given the opportunity\nto watch \u201cmovies\u201d from the comfort of their own homes, the millions of Americans who owned a television\nby the early 1950s were attending the cinema far less regularly than they had only several years\nearlier. [36] In an attempt to win back diminishing audiences, studios did their best to exploit the greatest\nadvantages film held over television. For one thing, television broadcasting in the 1950s was all in black\nand white, whereas the film industry had the advantage of color. While producing a color film was still an\nexpensive undertaking in the late 1940s, a couple of changes occurred in the industry in the early 1950s to\nmake color not only more affordable but also more realistic in its appearance. In 1950, as the result of\nantitrust legislation, Technicolor lost its monopoly on the color film industry, allowing other providers to\noffer more competitive pricing on filming and processing services. At the same time, Kodak came out with\na multilayer film stock that made it possible to use more affordable cameras and to produce a higher\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n342 quality image. Kodak\u2019s Eastmancolor option was an integral component in converting the industry to\ncolor. In the late 1940s, only 12 percent of features were in color; however, by 1954 (after the release of\nKodak Eastmancolor) more than 50 percent of movies were in color. [37]\nAnother clear advantage on which filmmakers tried to capitalize was the sheer size of the cinema\nexperience. With the release of the epic biblical film The Robein 1953, 20th Century Fox introduced the\nmethod that would soon be adopted by nearly every studio in Hollywood: a technology that allowed\nfilmmakers to squeeze a wide-angle image onto conventional 35-mm film stock, thereby increasing\nthe aspect ratio (the ratio of a screen\u2019s width to its height) of their images. This wide-screen format\nincreased the immersive quality of the theater experience. Nonetheless, even with these advancements,\nmovie attendance never again reached the record numbers it experienced in 1946, at the peak of the\nGolden Age of Hollywood. [38]\nMass Entertainment, Mass Paranoia: HUAC and the Hollywood\nBlacklist\nThe Cold War with the Soviet Union began in 1947, and with it came the widespread fear of communism,\nnot only from the outside, but equally from within. To undermine this perceived threat, the House Un-\nAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) commenced investigations to locate communist sympathizers in\nAmerica, who were suspected of conducting espionage for the Soviet Union. In the highly conservative\nand paranoid atmosphere of the time, Hollywood, the source of a mass-cultural medium, came under fire\nin response to fears that subversive, communist messages were being embedded in films. In November\n1947, more than 100 people in the movie business were called to testify before the HUAC about their and\ntheir colleagues\u2019 involvement with communist affairs. Of those investigated, 10 in particular refused to\ncooperate with the committee\u2019s questions. These 10, later known as the Hollywood Ten, were fired from\ntheir jobs and sentenced to serve up to a year in prison. The studios, already slipping in influence and\nprofit, were eager to cooperate in order to save themselves, and a number of producers signed an\nagreement stating that no communists would work in Hollywood.\nThe hearings, which recommenced in 1951 with the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy\u2019s influence, turned\ninto a kind of witch hunt as witnesses were asked to testify against their associates, and a blacklist of\nsuspected communists evolved. Over 324 individuals lost their jobs in the film industry as a result of\nblacklisting (the denial of work in a certain field or industry) and HUAC investigations. [39]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n343 Down with the Establishment: Youth Culture of the 1960s and 1970s\nMovies of the late 1960s began attracting a younger demographic, as a growing number of young people\nwere drawn in by films like Sam Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch (1969), Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space\nOdyssey (1968), Arthur Penn\u2019sBonnie and Clyde (1967), and Dennis Hopper\u2019s Easy Rider (1969)\u2014all\nrevolutionary in their genres\u2014that displayed a sentiment of unrest toward conventional social orders and\nincluded some of the earliest instances of realistic and brutal violence in film. These four films in\nparticular grossed so much money at the box offices that producers began churning out low-budget\ncopycats to draw in a new, profitable market. [40] While this led to a rise in youth-culture films, few of them\nsaw great success. However, the new liberal attitudes toward depictions of sex and violence in these films\nrepresented a sea of change in the movie industry that manifested in many movies of the 1970s, including\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u2019s The Godfather (1972), William Friedkin\u2019s The Exorcist (1973), and Steven\nSpielberg\u2019s Jaws (1975), all three of which saw great financial success. [41]\nBlockbusters, Knockoffs, and Sequels\nIn the 1970s, with the rise of work by Coppola, Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, and others, a\nnew breed of director emerged. These directors were young and film-school educated, and they\ncontributed a sense of professionalism, sophistication, and technical mastery to their work, leading to a\nwave of blockbuster productions, including Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977), Star\nWars (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The computer-\ngenerated special effects that were available at this time also contributed to the success of a number of\nlarge-budget productions. In response to these and several earlier blockbusters, movie production and\nmarketing techniques also began to shift, with studios investing more money in fewer films in the hopes of\nproducing more big successes. For the first time, the hefty sums producers and distributers invested\ndidn\u2019t go to production costs alone; distributors were discovering the benefits of TV and radio advertising\nand finding that doubling their advertising costs could increase profits as much as three or four times\nover. With the opening of Jaws, one of the five top-grossing films of the decade (and the highest grossing\nfilm of all time until the release of Star Wars in 1977), Hollywood embraced the wide-release method of\nmovie distribution, abandoning the release methods of earlier decades, in which a film would debut in\nonly a handful of select theaters in major cities before it became gradually available to mass\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n344 audiences. Jaws was released in 600 theaters simultaneously, and the big-budget films that followed\ncame out in anywhere from 800 to 2,000 theaters nationwide on their opening weekends.[42]\nThe major Hollywood studios of the late 1970s and early 1980s, now run by international corporations,\ntended to favor the conservative gamble of the tried and true, and as a result, the period saw an\nunprecedented number of high-budget sequels\u2014as in the Star Wars, Indiana Jones,\nand Godfather films\u2014as well as immitations and adaptations of earlier successful material, such as the\nplethora of \u201cslasher\u201d films that followed the success of the 1979 thriller Halloween. Additionally,\ncorporations sought revenue sources beyond the movie theater, looking to the video and cable releases of\ntheir films. Introduced in 1975, the VCR became nearly ubiquitous in American homes by 1998 with 88.9\nmillion households owning the appliance. [43] Cable television\u2019s growth was slower, but ownership of VCRs\ngave people a new reason to subscribe, and cable subsequently expanded as well. [44] And the newly\nintroduced concept of film-based merchandise (toys, games, books, etc.) allowed companies to increase\nprofits even more.\nThe 1990s and Beyond\nThe 1990s saw the rise of two divergent strands of cinema: the technically spectacular blockbuster with\nspecial, computer-generated effects and the independent, low-budget film. The capabilities of special\neffects were enhanced when studios began manipulating film digitally. Early examples of this technology\ncan be seen in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and Jurassic Park (1993). Films with an epic scope\u2014\nIndependence Day (1996), Titanic(1997), and The Matrix (1999)\u2014also employed a range of computer-\nanimation techniques and special effects to wow audiences and to draw more viewers to the big\nscreen. Toy Story (1995), the first fully computer-animated film, and those that came after it, such\nas Antz (1998), A Bug\u2019s Life (1998), and Toy Story 2(1999), displayed the improved capabilities of\ncomputer-generated animation.[45] At the same time, independent directors and producers, such as the\nCoen brothers and Spike Jonze, experienced an increased popularity, often for lower-budget films that\naudiences were more likely to watch on video at home. [46] A prime example of this is the 1996 Academy\nAwards program, when independent films dominated the Best Picture category. Only one movie from a\nbig film studio was nominated\u2014Jerry Maguire\u2014and the rest were independent films. The growth of both\nindependent movies and special-effects-laden blockbusters continues to the present day. You will read\nmore about current issues and trends and the future of the movie industry later on in this chapter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n345 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The concept of the motion picture was first introduced to a mass audience through Thomas Edison\u2019s\nkinetoscope in 1891. However, it wasn\u2019t until the Lumi\u00e8re brothers released the Cin\u00e9matographe in 1895\nthat motion pictures were projected for audience viewing. In the United States, film established itself as a\npopular form of entertainment with the nickelodeon theater in the 1910s.\n\uf0b7 The release of The Jazz Singer in 1927 marked the birth of the talking film, and by 1930 silent film was a\nthing of the past. Technicolor emerged for film around the same time and found early success with\nmovies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. However, people would continue to make films in\nblack and white until the late 1950s.\n\uf0b7 By 1915 most of the major film studios had moved to Hollywood. During the Golden Age of Hollywood,\nthese major studios controlled every aspect of the movie industry, and the films they produced drew\ncrowds to theaters in numbers that have still not been surpassed. After World War II, the studio system\ndeclined as a result of antitrust legislation that took power away from studios and of the invention of the\ntelevision.\n\uf0b7 During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a rise in films\u2014including Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, 2001:\nA Space Odyssey, and Easy Rider\u2014that celebrated the emerging youth culture and a rejection of the\nconservatism of the previous decades. This also led to looser attitudes toward depictions of sexuality and\nviolence in film. The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of the blockbuster, with films like Jaws, Star\nWars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Godfather.\n\uf0b7 The adoption of the VCR by most households in the 1980s reduced audiences at movie theaters but\nopened a new mass market of home movie viewers. Improvements in computer animation led to more\nspecial effects in film during the 1990s with movies like The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully\ncomputer-animated film, Toy Story.\nEXERCISES\nIdentify four films that you would consider to be representative of major developments in the industry and\nin film as a medium that were outlined in this section.

Recognize how movies reflect cultural attitudes, trends, and events.\n2. Indicate how movies influence culture.\nMovies Mirror Culture\nThe relationship between movies and culture involves a complicated dynamic; while American movies\ncertainly influence the mass culture that consumes them, they are also an integral part of that culture, a\nproduct of it, and therefore a reflection of prevailing concerns, attitudes, and beliefs. In considering the\nrelationship between film and culture, it is important to keep in mind that, while certain ideologies may\nbe prevalent in a given era, not only is American culture as diverse as the populations that form it, but it is\nalso constantly changing from one period to the next. Mainstream films produced in the late 1940s and\ninto the 1950s, for example, reflected the conservatism that dominated the sociopolitical arenas of the\ntime. However, by the 1960s, a reactionary youth culture began to emerge in opposition to the dominant\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n350 institutions, and these antiestablishment views soon found their way onto screen\u2014a far cry from the\nattitudes most commonly represented only a few years earlier.\nIn one sense, movies could be characterized as America\u2019s storytellers. Not only do Hollywood films reflect\ncertain commonly held attitudes and beliefs about what it means to be American, but they also portray\ncontemporary trends, issues, and events, serving as records of the eras in which they were produced.\nConsider, for example, films about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks: Fahrenheit 9/11, World\nTrade Center, United 93, and others. These films grew out of a seminal event of the time, one that\npreoccupied the consciousness of Americans for years after it occurred.\nBirth of a Nation\nIn 1915, director D. W. Griffith established his reputation with the highly successful film The Birth of a\nNation, based on Thomas Dixon\u2019s novel The Clansman, a prosegregation narrative about the American\nSouth during and after the Civil War. At the time, The Birth of a Nation was the longest feature film ever\nmade, at almost 3 hours, and contained huge battle scenes that amazed and delighted audiences. Griffith\u2019s\nstorytelling ability helped solidify the narrative style that would go on to dominate feature films. He also\nexperimented with editing techniques such as close-ups, jump cuts, and parallel editing that helped make\nthe film an artistic achievement.\nGriffith\u2019s film found success largely because it captured the social and cultural tensions of the era. As\nAmerican studies specialist Lary May has argued, \u201c[Griffith\u2019s] films dramatized every major concern of\nthe day.\u201d [1] In the early 20th century, fears about recent waves of immigrants had led to certain racist\nattitudes in mass culture, with \u201cscientific\u201d theories of the time purporting to link race with inborn traits\nlike intelligence and other capabilities. Additionally, the dominant political climate, largely a reaction\nagainst populist labor movements, was one of conservative elitism, eager to attribute social inequalities to\nnatural human differences. [2] According to a report by the New York Evening Post after the film\u2019s release,\neven some Northern audiences \u201cclapped when the masked riders took vengeance on\nNegroes.\u201d [3] However, the outrage many groups expressed about the film is a good reminder that\nAmerican culture is not monolithic, that there are always strong contingents in opposition to dominant\nideologies.\nWhile critics praised the film for its narrative complexity and epic scope, many others were outraged and\neven started riots at several screenings because of its highly controversial, openly racist attitudes, which\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n351 glorified the Ku Klux Klan and blamed Southern blacks for the destruction of the war. [4] Many Americans\njoined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in denouncing the film,\nand the National Board of Review eventually cut a number of the film\u2019s racist sections. [5] However, it\u2019s\nimportant to keep in mind the attitudes of the early 1900s. At the time the nation was divided, and Jim\nCrow laws and segregation were enforced. Nonetheless, The Birth of a Nation was the highest grossing\nmovie of its era. In 1992, the film was classified by the Library of Congress among the \u201cculturally,\nhistorically, or aesthetically significant films\u201d in U.S. history.\nFigure 8.6\nThe Birth of a Nation expressed racial tensions of the early 20th century.\n\u201cThe American Way\u201d\nUntil the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, American films after World War I generally reflected the\nneutral, isolationist stance that prevailed in politics and culture. However, after the United States was\ndrawn into the war in Europe, the government enlisted Hollywood to help with the war effort, opening the\nfederal Bureau of Motion Picture Affairs in Los Angeles. Bureau officials served in an advisory capacity on\nthe production of war-related films, an effort with which the studios cooperated. As a result, films tended\ntoward the patriotic and were produced to inspire feelings of pride and confidence in being American and\nto clearly establish that America and its allies were forced of good. For instance, critically\nacclaimed Casablanca paints a picture of the ill effects of fascism, illustrates the values that heroes like\nVictor Laszlo hold, and depicts America as a place for refugees to find democracy and freedom. [6]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n352 These early World War II films were sometimes overtly propagandist, intended to influence American\nattitudes rather than present a genuine reflection of American sentiments toward the war. Frank\nCapra\u2019s Why We Fight films, for example, the first of which was produced in 1942, were developed for the\nU.S. Army and were later shown to general audiences; they delivered a war message through\nnarrative. [7] As the war continued, however, filmmakers opted to forego patriotic themes for a more\nserious reflection of American sentiments, as exemplified by films like Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Lifeboat.\nYouth versus Age: From Counterculture to Mass Culture\nIn Mike Nichols\u2019s 1967 film The Graduate, Dustin Hoffman, as the film\u2019s protagonist, enters into a\nromantic affair with the wife of his father\u2019s business partner. However, Mrs. Robinson and the other\nadults in the film fail to understand the young, alienated hero, who eventually rebels against them. The\nGraduate, which brought in more than $44 million at the box office, reflected the attitudes of many\nmembers of a young generation growing increasingly dissatisfied with what they perceived to be the\nrepressive social codes established by their more conservative elders. [8]\nThis baby boomer generation came of age during the Korean and Vietnam wars. Not only did the youth\nculture express a cynicism toward the patriotic, prowar stance of their World War II\u2013era elders, but they\ndisplayed a fierce resistance toward institutional authority in general, an antiestablishmentism\nepitomized in the 1967 hit film Bonnie and Clyde. In the film, a young, outlaw couple sets out on a cross-\ncountry bank-robbing spree until they\u2019re killed in a violent police ambush at the film\u2019s close. [9]\nBonnie and Clyde\u2019s violence provides one example of the ways films at the time were testing the limits of\npermissible on-screen material. The youth culture\u2019s liberal attitudes toward formally taboo subjects like\nsexuality and drugs began to emerge in film during the late 1960s. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Sam\nPeckinpah\u2019s 1969 Western The Wild Bunch, displays an early example of aestheticized violence in film.\nThe wildly popular Easy Rider (1969)\u2014containing drugs, sex, and violence\u2014may owe a good deal of its\ninitial success to liberalized audiences. And in the same year, Midnight Cowboy, one of the first\nHollywood films to receive an X rating (in this case for its sexual content), won three Academy Award\nawards, including Best Picture. [10] As the release and subsequently successful reception of these films\nattest, what at the decade\u2019s outset had been countercultural had, by the decade\u2019s close, become\nmainstream.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n353 The Hollywood Production Code\nWhen the MPAA (originally MPPDA) first banded together in 1922 to combat government censorship and\nto promote artistic freedom, the association attempted a system of self-regulation. However, by 1930\u2014in\npart because of the transition to talking pictures\u2014renewed criticism and calls for censorship from\nconservative groups made it clear to the MPPDA that the loose system of self-regulation was not enough\nprotection. As a result, the MPPDA instituted the Production Code, or Hays Code (after MPPDA director\nWilliam H. Hays), which remained in place until 1967. The code, which according to motion picture\nproducers concerned itself with ensuring that movies were \u201cdirectly responsible for spiritual or moral\nprogress, for higher types of social life, and for much correct thinking,\u201d [11] was strictly enforced starting in\n1934, putting an end to most public complaints. However, many people in Hollywood resented its\nrestrictiveness. After a series of Supreme Court cases in the 1950s regarding the code\u2019s restrictions to\nfreedom of speech, the Production Code grew weaker until it was finally replaced in 1967 with the MPAA\nrating system. [12]\nMPAA Ratings\nAs films like Bonnie and Clyde and Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) tested the limits on violence\nand language, it became clear that the Production Code was in need of replacement. In 1968, the MPAA\nadopted a ratings system to identify films in terms of potentially objectionable content. By providing\nofficially designated categories for films that would not have passed Production Code standards of the\npast, the MPAA opened a way for films to deal openly with mature content. The ratings system originally\nincluded four categories: G (suitable for general audiences), M (equivalent to the PG rating of today), R\n(restricted to adults over age 16), and X (equivalent to today\u2019s NC-17).\nThe MPAA rating systems, with some modifications, is still in place today. Before release in theaters, films\nare submitted to the MPAA board for a screening, during which advisers decide on the most appropriate\nrating based on the film\u2019s content. However, studios are not required to have the MPAA screen releases\nahead of time\u2014some studios release films without the MPAA rating at all. Commercially, less restrictive\nratings are generally more beneficial, particularly in the case of adult-themed films that have the potential\nto earn the most restrictive rating, the NC-17. Some movie theaters will not screen a movie that is rated\nNC-17. When filmmakers get a more restrictive rating than they were hoping for, they may resubmit the\nfilm for review after editing out objectionable scenes. [13]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n354 The New War Film: Cynicism and Anxiety\nUnlike the patriotic war films of the World War II era, many of the films about U.S. involvement in\nVietnam reflected strong antiwar sentiment, criticizing American political policy and portraying war\u2019s\ndamaging effects on those who survived it. Films like Dr. Strangelove (1964), M*A*S*H (1970), The Deer\nHunter (1978), and Apocalypse Now (1979) portray the military establishment in a negative light and\ndissolve clear-cut distinctions, such as the \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality, of earlier war films. These, and the\ndozens of Vietnam War films that were produced in the 1970s and 1980s\u2014Oliver Stone\u2019s Platoon (1986)\nandBorn on the Fourth of July (1989) and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Full Metal Jacket(1987), for example\u2014reflect\nthe sense of defeat and lack of closure Americans felt after the Vietnam War and the emotional and\npsychological scars it left on the nation\u2019s psyche. [14] A spate of military and politically themed films\nemerged during the 1980s as America recovered from defeat in Vietnam, while at the same time facing\nanxieties about the ongoing Cold War with the Soviet Union.\nFears about the possibility of nuclear war were very real during the 1980s, and some film critics argue that\nthese anxieties were reflected not only in overtly political films of the time but also in the popularity of\nhorror films, like Halloween and Friday the 13th, which feature a mysterious and unkillable monster, and\nin the popularity of the fantastic in films like E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark,\nand Star Wars, which offer imaginative escapes. [15]\nMovies Shape Culture\nJust as movies reflect the anxieties, beliefs, and values of the cultures that produce them, they also help to\nshape and solidify a culture\u2019s beliefs. Sometimes the influence is trivial, as in the case of fashion trends or\nfigures of speech. After the release of Flashdance in 1983, for instance, torn T-shirts and leg warmers\nbecame hallmarks of the fashion of the 1980s. [16] However, sometimes the impact can be profound,\nleading to social or political reform, or the shaping of ideologies.\nFilm and the Rise of Mass Culture\nDuring the 1890s and up until about 1920, American culture experienced a period of rapid\nindustrialization. As people moved from farms to centers of industrial production, urban areas began to\nhold larger and larger concentrations of the population. At the same time, film and other methods of mass\ncommunication (advertising and radio) developed, whose messages concerning tastes, desires, customs,\nspeech, and behavior spread from these population centers to outlying areas across the country. The effect\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n355 of early mass-communication media was to wear away regional differences and create a more\nhomogenized, standardized culture.\nFilm played a key role in this development, as viewers began to imitate the speech, dress, and behavior of\ntheir common heroes on the silver screen. [17] In 1911, the Vitagraph company began publishing The\nMotion Picture Magazine, America\u2019s first fan magazine. Originally conceived as a marketing tool to keep\naudiences interested in Vitagraph\u2019s pictures and major actors, The Motion Picture Magazine helped\ncreate the concept of the film star in the American imagination. Fans became obsessed with the off-screen\nlives of their favorite celebrities, like Pearl White, Florence Lawrence, and Mary Pickford. [18]\nAmerican Myths and Traditions\nAmerican identity in mass society is built around certain commonly held beliefs, or myths about shared\nexperiences, and these American myths are often disseminated through or reinforced by film. One\nexample of a popular American myth, one that dates back to the writings of Thomas Jefferson and other\nfounders, is an emphasis on individualism\u2014a celebration of the common man or woman as a hero or\nreformer. With the rise of mass culture, the myth of the individual became increasingly appealing because\nit provided people with a sense of autonomy and individuality in the face of an increasingly homogenized\nculture. The hero myth finds embodiment in the Western, a film genre that was popular from the silent\nera through the 1960s, in which the lone cowboy, a seminomadic wanderer makes his way in a lawless,\nand often dangerous, frontier. An example is 1952\u2019s High Noon. From 1926 until 1967, Westerns\naccounted for nearly a quarter of all films produced. In other films, like Frank Capra\u2019s 1946 movie It\u2019s a\nWonderful Life, the individual triumphs by standing up to injustice, reinforcing the belief that one person\ncan make a difference in the world. [19] And in more recent films, hero figures such as Indiana Jones, Luke\nSkywalker (Star Wars), and Neo (The Matrix) have continued to emphasize individualism.\nSocial Issues in Film\nAs D. W. Griffith recognized nearly a century ago, film has enormous power as a medium to influence\npublic opinion. Ever since Griffith\u2019s The Birth of a Nation sparked strong public reactions in 1915,\nfilmmakers have been producing movies that address social issues, sometimes subtly, and sometimes very\ndirectly. More recently, films like Hotel Rwanda (2004), about the 1994 Rwandan genocide, or The Kite\nRunner (2007), a story that takes place in the midst of a war-torn Afghanistan, have captured audience\nimaginations by telling stories that raise social awareness about world events. And a number of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n356 documentary films directed at social issues have had a strong influence on cultural attitudes and have\nbrought about significant change.\nIn the 2000s, documentaries, particularly those of an activist nature, were met with greater interest than\never before. Films like Super Size Me (2004), which documents the effects of excessive fast-food\nconsumption and criticizes the fast-food industry for promoting unhealthy eating habits for profit,\nand Food, Inc.(2009), which examines corporate farming practices and points to the negative impact\nthese practices can have on human health and the environment, have brought about important changes in\nAmerican food culture. [20] Just 6 weeks after the release of Super Size Me, McDonald\u2019s took the supersize\noption off its menu and since 2004 has introduced a number of healthy food options in its\nrestaurants. [21] Other fast-food chains have made similar changes. [22]\nOther documentaries intended to influence cultural attitudes and inspire change include those made by\ndirector Michael Moore. Moore\u2019s films present a liberal stance on social and political issues such as health\ncare, globalization, and gun control. His 2002 film Bowling for Columbine, for example, addressed the\nColumbine High School shootings of 1999, presenting a critical examination of American gun culture.\nWhile some critics have accused Moore of producing propagandistic material under the label of\ndocumentary because of his films\u2019 strong biases, his films have been popular with audiences, with four of\nhis documentaries ranking among the highest grossing documentaries of all time.Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004),\nwhich criticized the second Bush administration and its involvement in the Iraq War, earned $119 million\nat the box office, making it the most successful documentary of all time. [23]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 As products of mass culture, movies reflect cultural attitudes, trends, and concerns:\n1. D. W. Griffith\u2019s film The Birth of a Nation, presenting a racist perspective on the U.S. Civil War and its\naftermath, reflected racist concerns of the era in which it was produced.\n2. During World War II, films reflected the patriotic, prowar sentiments of the time.\n3. In the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of an antiestablishment youth culture, movies adopted more liberal\nstances toward sexuality and violence and displayed a cynicism toward established social structures.\n\uf0b7 After the failure of the Vietnam War, films reflected a more ambivalent attitude toward war.\n\uf0b7 The MPAA rating system, established in 1968, gave filmmakers greater freedom in the content they were\nable to portray on screen.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n357 \uf0b7 Movies shape cultural attitudes and customs, as audiences adopt the attitudes and styles of the\ncharacters they watch on screen. Filmmakers may use their movies to influence cultural attitudes toward\ncertain social issues, as in Fahrenheit 9/11 and Super Size Me.\nEXERCISES\n1. Consider three films you have watched in the last year. In what ways have these films reflected\ncurrent concerns, trends, or attitudes? Of these movies, which do you think have the most potential\nto shape cultural attitudes or bring about social change? How do you think these movies might bring\nabout this change?\n2. Locate a film that has been remade and watch the original and remade versions. Besides the obvious\nchanges in fashion and technology, what other differences do you notice that reflect the cultural\nattitudes, trends, and events in which each film was produced?\n[1] Lary May, \u201cApocalyptic Cinema: D.

Recognize the role the major Hollywood studios have in shaping the movie industry today.\n2. Identify the major economic concerns involved in the production and distribution of films.\n3. Describe the effects of piracy on the movie industry.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n359 Filmmaking is both a commercial and artistic venture. The current economic situation in the film\nindustry, with increased production and marketing costs and lower audience turnouts in theaters, often\nsets the standard for the films big studios are willing to invest in. If you wonder why theaters have\nreleased so many remakes and sequels in recent years, this section may help you to understand the\nmotivating factors behind those decisions.\nThe Influence of Hollywood\nIn the movie industry today, publicity and product are two sides of the same coin. Even films that get a\nlousy critical reception can do extremely well in ticket sales if their marketing campaigns manage to create\nenough hype. Similarly, two comparable films can produce very different results at the box office if they\nhave been given different levels of publicity. This explains why the film What Women Want, starring Mel\nGibson, brought in $33.6 million in its opening weekend in 2000, while a few months later, The Million\nDollar Hotel, also starring Gibson, only brought in $29,483 during its opening weekend. [1] Unlike in the\ndays of the Hollywood studio system, no longer do the actors alone draw audiences to a movie. The\nowners of the nation\u2019s major movie theater chains are keenly aware that a film\u2019s success at the box office\nhas everything to do with studio-generated marketing and publicity. What Women Want was produced by\nParamount, one of the film industry\u2019s six leading studios, and widely released (on 3,000 screens) after an\nextensive marketing effort, while The Million Dollar Hotel was produced by Lionsgate, an independent\nstudio without the necessary marketing budget to fill enough seats for a wide release on opening\nweekend. [2]\nThe Hollywood \u201cdream factory,\u201d as Hortense Powdermaker labeled it in her 1950 book on the movie\nindustry, [3] manufactures an experience that is part art and part commercial product. [4] While the studios\nof today are less factory-like than they were in the vertically integrated studio system era, the coordinated\nefforts of a film\u2019s production team can still be likened to a machine calibrated for mass production. The\nfilms the studios churn out are the result of a capitalist enterprise that ultimately looks to the \u201cbottom\nline\u201d to guide most major decisions. Hollywood is an industry, and as in any other industry in a mass\nmarket, its success relies on control of production resources and \u201craw materials\u201d and on its access to mass\ndistribution and marketing strategies to maximize the product\u2019s reach and minimize competition. [5] In\nthis way, Hollywood has an enormous influence on the films to which the public has access.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n360 Ever since the rise of the studio system in the 1930s, the majority of films have originated with the leading\nHollywood studios. Today, the six big studios control 95 percent of the film business. [6] In the early years,\naudiences were familiar with the major studios, their collections of actors and directors, and the types of\nfilms that each studio was likely to release. All of that changed with the decline of the studio system;\nscreenwriters, directors, scripts, and cinematographers no longer worked exclusively with one studio, so\nthese days, while moviegoers are likely to know the name of a film\u2019s director and major actors, it\u2019s unusual\nfor them to identify a film with the studio that distributes it. However, studios are no less influential. The\npreviews of coming attractions that play before a movie begins are controlled by the studios. [7] Online\nmarketing, TV commercials, and advertising partnerships with other industries\u2014the name of an\nupcoming film, for instance, appearing on some Coke cans\u2014are available tools for the big-budget studios\nthat have the resources to commit millions to prerelease advertising. Even though studios no longer own\nthe country\u2019s movie theater chains, the films produced by the big six studios are the ones the multiplexes\ninvariably show. Unlike films by independents, it\u2019s a safe bet that big studio movies are the ones that will\nsell tickets.\nThe Blockbuster Standard\nWhile it may seem like the major studios are making heavy profits, moviemaking today is a much riskier,\nless profitable enterprise than it was in the studio system era. The massive budgets required for the global\nmarketing of a film are huge financial gambles. In fact, most movies cost the studios much more to market\nand produce\u2014upward of $100 million\u2014than their box-office returns ever generate. With such high stakes,\nstudios have come to rely on the handful of blockbuster films that keep them afloat, [8] movies\nlike Titanic, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Avatar. [9] The blockbuster film becomes a touchstone, not only\nfor production values and story lines, but also for moviegoers\u2019 expectations. Because studios know they\ncan rely on certain predictable elements to draw audiences, they tend to invest the majority of their\nbudgets on movies that fit the blockbuster mold. Remakes, movies with sequel setups, or films based on\nbest-selling novels or comic books are safer bets than original screenplays or movies with experimental or\nedgy themes.\nJames Cameron\u2019s Titanic (1997), the second highest grossing movie of all time, saw such success largely\nbecause it was based on a well-known story, contained predictable plot elements, and was designed to\nappeal to the widest possible range of audience demographics with romance, action, expensive special\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n361 effects, and an epic scope\u2014meeting the blockbuster standard on several levels. The film\u2019s astronomical\n$200 million production cost was a gamble indeed, requiring the backing of two studios, Paramount and\n20th Century Fox. [10]However, the rash of high-budget, and high-grossing, films that have appeared\nsince\u2014Harry Potter and the Sorceror\u2019s Stone and its sequels (2002\u20132011),Avatar (2009), Alice in\nWonderland (2010), The Lord of the Rings films (2001\u20132003), The Dark Knight (2008), and others\u2014are\nan indication that, for the time being, the blockbuster standard will drive Hollywood production.\nThe Role of Independent Films\nWhile the blockbuster still drives the industry, the formulaic nature of most Hollywood films of the 1980s,\n1990s, and into the 2000s has opened a door for independent films to make their mark on the industry.\nAudiences have welcomed movies like Fight Club (1999), Lost in Translation (2003), and Juno(2007) as\na change from standard Hollywood blockbusters. Few independent films reached the mainstream\naudience during the 1980s, but a number of developments in that decade paved the way for their\nincreased popularity in the coming years. The Sundance Film Festival (originally the U.S. Film Festival)\nbegan in Park City, Utah, in 1980 as a way for independent filmmakers to showcase their work. Since\nthen, the festival has grown to garner more public attention, and now often represents an opportunity for\nindependents to find market backing by larger studios. In 1989, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s sex, lies, and\nvideotape, released by Miramax, was the first independent to break out of the art-house circuit and find\nits way into the multiplexes.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, independent directors like the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and\nQuentin Tarantino made significant contributions to contemporary cinema. Tarantino\u2019s 1994 film, Pulp\nFiction, garnered attention for its experimental narrative structure, witty dialogue, and nonchalant\napproach to violence. It was the first independent film to break $100 million at the box office, proving that\nthere is still room in the market for movies produced outside of the big six studios. [11]\nThe Role of Foreign Films\nEnglish-born Michael Apted, former president of the Director\u2019s Guild of America, once said, \u201cEuropeans\ngave me the inspiration to make movies \u2026 but it was the Americans who showed me how to do\nit.\u201d [12] Major Hollywood studio films have dominated the movie industry worldwide since Hollywood\u2019s\ngolden age, yet American films have always been in a relationship of mutual influence with films from\nforeign markets. From the 1940s through the 1960s, for example, American filmmakers admired and were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n362 influenced by the work of overseas auteurs\u2014directors like Ingmar Bergman (Sweden), Federico Fellini\n(Italy), Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut (France), and Akira Kurosawa (Japan), whose personal, creative visions were\nreflected in their work. [13] The concept of the auteur was particularly important in France in the late 1950s\nand early 1960s when French filmmaking underwent a rebirth in the form of the New Wave movement.\nThe French New Wave was characterized by an independent production style that showcased the personal\nauthorship of its young directors. [14] The influence of the New Wave was, and continues to be, felt in the\nUnited States. The generation of young, film school-educated directors that became prominent in\nAmerican cinema in the late 1960s and early 1970s owe a good deal of their stylistic techniques to the\nwork of French New Wave directors.\nIn the current era of globalization, the influence of foreign films remains strong. The rapid growth of the\nentertainment industry in Asia, for instance, has led to an exchange of style and influence with U.S.\ncinema. Remakes of a number of popular Japanese horror films, including The Ring (2005), Dark\nWater(2005), and The Grudge (2004), have fared well in the United States, as have Chinese martial arts\nfilms like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Hero(2002), and House of Flying Daggers (2004).\nAt the same time, U.S. studios have recently tried to expand into the growing Asian market by purchasing\nthe rights to films from South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong for remakes with Hollywood actors. [15]\nCultural Imperialism or Globalization?\nWith the growth of Internet technology worldwide and the expansion of markets in rapidly developing\ncountries, American films are increasingly finding their way into movie theaters and home DVD players\naround the world. In the eyes of many people, the problem is not the export of a U.S. product to outside\nmarkets, but the export of American culture that comes with that product. Just as films of the 1920s\nhelped to shape a standardized, mass culture as moviegoers learned to imitate the dress and behavior of\ntheir favorite celebrities, contemporary film is now helping to form a mass culture on the global scale, as\nthe youth of foreign nations acquire the American speech, tastes, and attitudes reflected in film. [16]\nStaunch critics, feeling helpless to stop the erosion of their national cultures, accuse the United States of\ncultural imperialism through flashy Hollywood movies and commercialism\u2014that is, deliberate conquest\nof one culture by another to spread capitalism. At the same time, others argue that the worldwide impact\nof Hollywood films is an inevitable part of globalization, a process that erodes national borders, opening\nthe way for a free flow of ideas between cultures. [17]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n363 The Economics of Movies\nWith control of over 95 percent of U.S. film production, the big six Hollywood studios\u2014Warner Bros.,\nParamount, 20th Century Fox, Universal, Columbia, and Disney\u2014are at the forefront of the American film\nindustry, setting the standards for distribution, release, marketing, and production values. However, the\nhigh costs of moviemaking today are such that even successful studios must find moneymaking potential\nin crossover media\u2014computer games, network TV rights, spin-off TV series, DVD and releases on Blu-ray\nDisc format, toys and other merchandise, books, and other after-market products\u2014to help recoup their\nlosses. The drive for aftermarket marketability in turn dictates the kinds of films studios are willing to\ninvest in. [18]\nRising Costs and Big Budget Movies\nIn the days of the vertically integrated studio system, filmmaking was a streamlined process, neither as\nrisky nor as expensive as it is today. When producers, directors, screenwriters, art directors, actors,\ncinematographers, and other technical staff were all under contract with one studio, turnaround time for\nthe casting and production of a film was often as little as 3 to 4 months. Beginning in the 1970s, after the\ndecline of the studio system, the production costs for films increased dramatically, forcing the studios to\ninvest more of their budgets in marketing efforts that could generate presales\u2014that is, sales of\ndistribution rights for a film in different sectors before the movie\u2019s release. [19]This is still true of\nfilmmaking today. With contracts that must be negotiated with actors, directors, and screenwriters, and\nwith extended production times, costs are exponentially higher than they were in the 1930s\u2014when a film\ncould be made for around $300,000. [20] By contrast, today\u2019s average production budget, not including\nmarketing expenses, is close to $65 million today. [21]\nConsider James Cameron\u2019s Avatar, released in 2009, which cost close to $340 million, making it one of\nthe most expensive films of all time. Where does such an astronomical budget go? When weighing the\ntotal costs of producing and releasing a film, about half of the money goes to advertising. In the case of\nAvatar, the film cost $190 million to make and around $150 million to market.[22] Of that $190 million\nproduction budget, part goes toward above-the-line costs, those that are negotiated before filming begins,\nand part to below-the-line costs, those that are generally fixed. Above-the-line costs include screenplay\nrights; salaries for the writer, producer, director, and leading actors; and salaries for directors\u2019, actors\u2019,\nand producers\u2019 assistants. Below-the-line costs include the salaries for nonstarring cast members and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n364 technical crew, use of technical equipment, travel, locations, studio rental, and catering. [23] For Avatar,\nthe reported $190 million doesn\u2019t include money for research and development of 3-D filming and\ncomputer-modeling technologies required to put the film together. If these costs are factored in, the total\nmovie budget may be closer to $500 million. [24] Fortunately for 20th Century Fox, Avatar made a profit\nover these expenses in box-office sales alone, raking in $750 million domestically (to make it the highest-\ngrossing movie of all time) in the first 6 months after its release. [25] However, one thing you should keep\nin mind is that Avatar was released in both 2-D and 3-D. Because 3-D ticket prices are more expensive\nthan traditional 2-D theaters, the box-office returns are inflated.\nThe Big Budget Flop\nHowever, for every expensive film that has made out well at the box office, there are a handful of others\nthat have tanked. Back in 1980, when United Artists (UA) was a major Hollywood studio, its epic\nwestern Heaven\u2019s Gate cost nearly six times its original budget: $44 million instead of the proposed $7.6\nmillion. The movie, which bombed at the box office, was the largest failure in film history at the time,\nlosing at least $40 million, and forcing the studio to be bought out by MGM. [26] Since then, Heaven\u2019s\nGate has become synonymous with commercial failure in the film industry. [27]\nMore recently, the 2005 movie Sahara lost $78 million, making it one of the biggest financial flops in film\nhistory. The film\u2019s initial production budget of $80 million eventually doubled to $160 million, due to\ncomplications with filming in Morocco and to numerous problems with the script. [28]\nPiracy\nMovie piracy used to be perpetrated in two ways: Either someone snuck into a theater with a video\ncamera, turning out blurred, wobbly, off-colored copies of the original film, or somebody close to the film\nleaked a private copy intended for reviewers. In the digital age, however, crystal-clear bootlegs of movies\non DVD and the Internet are increasingly likely to appear illegally, posing a much greater threat to a film\u2019s\nprofitability. Even safeguard techniques like digital watermarks are frequently sidestepped by tech-savvy\npirates. [29]\nIn 2009, an unfinished copy of 20th Century Fox\u2019s X-Men Origins: Wolverine appeared online 1 month\nbefore the movie\u2019s release date in theaters. Within a week, more than 1 million people had downloaded\nthe pirated film. Similar situations have occurred in recent years with other major movies, including The\nHulk (2003) and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). [30]According to a 2006 study\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n365 sponsored by the MPAA, Internet piracy and other methods of illegal copying cost major Hollywood\nstudios $6.1 billion in the previous year. [31] The findings of this report have since been called into\nquestion, with investigators claiming that there was no clear methodology for how researchers estimated\nthose figures. [32] Nonetheless, the ease of theft made possible by the digitization of film and improved file-\nsharing technologies like BitTorrent software, a peer-to-peer protocol for transferring large quantities of\ninformation between users, have put increased financial strain on the movie industry.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 A film\u2019s performance at the box office is often directly related to the studio marketing budget that backs\nit.\n\uf0b7 Because of high marketing and production costs, the major studios have increasingly come to rely on\nblockbuster films to keep themselves profitable.\n\uf0b7 Independent films found increased popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, in part because they represented a\nbreak from the predictable material often released by studios.\n\uf0b7 With the rise of digital filming technology and online movies, movie piracy has become an increasing\nconcern for Hollywood.\nEXERCISES\nIn Section 8.3 \"Issues and Trends in Film\", you learned that blockbuster films rely on certain predictable\nelements to attract audiences. Think about recent blockbusters like Alice in Wonderland, Avatar,\nand Pirates of the Caribbean and consider the following:\n1. What elements do these films have in common? Why do you think these elements help to sell\nmovies?\n2. How have the big Hollywood studios shaped these elements?\n3. How do economic concerns, like box-office totals, promote predictable elements?\n4. Have these movies been affected by piracy? If so, how? If not, why?\n[1] Nash Information Services, \u201cWhat Women Want,\u201d The Numbers: Box Office Data, Movie Stars, Idle\nSpeculation, http://www.the-numbers.com/2000/WWWNT.php; Nash Information Services, \u201cThe Million Dollar\nHotel,\u201d The Numbers: Box Office Data, Movie Stars, Idle Speculation, http://www.the-\nnumbers.com/2001/BHOTL.php.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n366 [2] Edward Jay Epstein, \u201cNeither the Power nor the Glory: Why Hollywood Leaves Originality to the Indies,\u201d Slate,\nOctober 17, 2005, http://www.slate.com/id/2128200.\n[3] Hortense Powdermaker, \u201cHollywood, the Dream Factory,\u201d\nhttp://astro.temple.edu/~ruby/wava/powder/intro.html.\n[4] Caryn James, \u201cCritic\u2019s Notebook: Romanticizing Hollywood\u2019s Dream Factory,\u201d New York Times, November 7,\n1989, http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-romanticizing-hollywood-s-dream-\nfactory.html.\n[5] John Belton, American Cinema/American Culture.

Identify the impact of home-entertainment technology on the motion picture industry.\n2. Recognize the role the DVD market plays in the economics of moviemaking.\n3. Describe the impact of digital cinematography on the film industry.\nNew technologies have a profound impact, not only on the way films are made, but also on the\neconomic structure of the film industry. When VCR technology made on-demand home movie\nviewing possible for the first time, filmmakers had to adapt to a changing market. The recent switch\nto digital technology also represents a turning point for film. In this section, you will learn how these\nand other technologies have changed the face of cinema.\nEffects of Home Entertainment Technology\nThe first technology for home video recording, Sony\u2019s Betamax cassettes, hit the market in 1975. The\ndevice, a combined television set and videocassette recorder (VCR), came with the high price tag of\n$2,495, making it a luxury still too expensive for the average American home. Two years later, RCA\nreleased the vertical helical scan (VHS) system of recording, which would eventually outsell Betamax,\nthough neither device was yet a popular consumer product. Within several years however, the concept of\nhome movie recording and viewing was beginning to catch on. In 1979, Columbia Pictures released 20\nfilms for home viewing, and a year later Disney entered the market with the first authorized video rental\nplan for retail stores. By 1983, VCRs were still relatively uncommon, found in just 10 percent of American\nhomes, but within 2 years the device had found a place in nearly one-third of U.S. households. [1]\nAt the same time, video rental stores began to spring up across the country. In 1985, three major video\nrental chains\u2014Blockbuster, Hastings, and Movie Gallery\u2014opened their doors. The video rental market\ntook off between 1983 and 1986, reaching $3.37 billion in 1986. Video sales that year came to $1 billion,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n369 for total revenue of more than $4 billion, marking the first time in history that video would eclipse box-\noffice revenues ($3.78 billion that year). [2]\nVideo sales and rentals opened a new mass market in the entertainment industry\u2014the home movie\nviewer\u2014and offered Hollywood an extended source of income from its films. On the other hand, the VCR\nalso introduced the problem of piracy.\nVCRs Legal, Just Barely\nIn an age when Hollywood was already struggling financially because of increased production costs,\nSony\u2019s release of home video recording technology became a major source of anxiety for Hollywood\nstudios. If people could watch movies in their own homes, would they stop going to the movies altogether?\nIn the 1976 case Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Universal Studios and the Walt Disney\nCompany sued Sony in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The suit argued that\nbecause Sony was manufacturing a technology that could potentially be used to break copyright law, the\ncompany was therefore liable for any copyright infringement committed by VCR purchasers. The District\nCourt struggled with the case, eventually ruling against Sony. However, Sony appealed to the Supreme\nCourt, where the case was again highly debated. Part of the struggle was the recognition that the case had\nwider implications: Does a device with recording capabilities conflict with copyright law? Is an individual\nguilty of copyright infringement if she records a single movie in her own home for her own private use?\nEventually the Supreme Court ruled that Sony and other VCR manufacturers could not be held liable for\ncopyright infringement. This case represented an important milestone for two reasons. It opened up a\nnew market in the entertainment sector, enabling video rental and home movie sales. Additionally, the\ncase set a standard for determining whether a device with copying or recording capability violated\ncopyright law. The court ruled that because nonprofit, noncommercial home recording did not constitute\ncopyright violation, VCR technology did have legitimate legal uses, and Sony and other companies could\nnot be held liable for any misuse of their devices. Recently, this case has posed interpretive challenges in\nlegal battles and in debates over file sharing through the Internet. [3]\nThe Optical Disc System\nIn 1980, around the time when consumers were just beginning to purchase VCRs for home use, Pioneer\nElectronics introduced another technology, the LaserDisc, an optical storage disc that produced higher\nquality images than did VHS tapes. Nonetheless, because of its large size (12 inches in diameter) and lack\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n370 of recording capabilities, this early disc system never became popular in the U.S. market. However, the\nLaserDisc\u2019s successor, the digital versatile disc (DVD) was a different story. Like LaserDisc, the DVD is an\noptical storage disc\u2014that is, a device whose encoded information follows a spiral pattern on the disc\u2019s\nsurface and can be read when illuminated by a laser diode. However, unlike the analog-formatted\nLaserDisc, the DVD\u2019s information storage is entirely digital, allowing for a smaller, lighter, more\ncompressed medium.\nThe first DVDs were released in stores in 1997, impressing consumers and distributers with their\nnumerous advantages over the VHS tape: sharper-resolution images, compactness, higher durability,\ninteractive special features, and better copy protection. In only a few years, sales of DVD players and discs\nsurpassed those of VCRs and videos, making the DVD the most rapidly adopted consumer electronics\nproduct of all time. [4]\nIn 1999, the movie rental market was revolutionized by Netflix. Netflix began in 1997 as a video rental\nstore in California. In 1999, the company began offering a subscription service online. Subscribers would\nselect movies that they wanted to see on Netflix\u2019s website, and the movies would arrive in their mailbox a\nfew days later, along with a prepaid return envelope. This allowed users to select from thousands of\nmovies and television shows in the privacy of their own home.\nMore recently, DVD technology has been surpassed by the Blu-ray Disc format, intended for storing and\nproducing high-definition video. Released in 2006, the Blu-ray Disc technology has the same physical\ndimensions as DVDs, but because they are encoded to be read by lasers with a shorter wavelength, the\ndiscs have more than five times the storage capacity of the DVD. [5] By 2009 there were 10.9 million Blu-\nray Disc players in U.S. homes. [6] However, the technology has yet to replace the DVD in rental stores and\namong the majority of U.S. consumers.\nDVD Revenues and Decline\nDVD rentals and sales make up a major source of revenue for the movie industry, accounting for nearly\nhalf of the returns on feature films. In fact, for some time the industry has been exploiting the profitability\nof releasing some films directly to DVD without ever premiering them in theaters or of releasing films on\nDVD simultaneously with their theater releases. According to one estimate, for every movie that appears\nin theaters, there are three that go straight to DVD. [7] While direct-to-DVD has become synonymous with\npoor production values and ill-conceived sequels, there are a number of reasons why a studio might\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n371 bypass the multiplexes. Prequels and sequels of box-office hits, shot on a lower production budget, are\noften released this way and can generate considerable income from the niche market of hard-core fans.\nThe fourth American Pie film, Bring It On: In It to Win It, and Ace Ventura Pet Detective, Jr. are all\nexamples of successful direct-to-DVD films. However, in other cases, the costs of theatrical promotion and\nrelease may simply be too high for a studio to back. This is especially true among independently produced\nfilms that lack the big-studio marketing budgets. Slumdog Millionaire (2009) was almost one of these\ncases. However, the film did make it to theaters, going on to win eight Academy Award awards in 2009,\nincluding Best Picture. [8] Finally, a film may go straight to DVD when its content is too controversial to be\nreleased in theaters. For example, almost all porn films are direct-to-DVD releases.\nBetween 2005 and 2008, the number of direct-to-DVD releases grew 36 percent as studios began to see\nthe profitability of the strategy. [9] After a movie\u2019s success at the box office, a prequel, sequel, or related\nmovie might earn the same profit pound-for-pound at the rental store if filmmakers slash the production\nbudget, often replacing the original celebrity actors with less expensive talent. In 2008, direct-to-DVD\nbrought in around $1 billion in sales.[10]\nDespite the profitability of the DVD market, the economic downturn that began in 2007, along with the\nconcurrent release of Blu-ray Disc technology and online digital downloads, have brought about a decline\nin DVD sales among U.S. consumers. [11] With the rise in digital downloads, Netflix broadened its appeal\nin 2007 by offering subscribers live-streaming movies and TV shows. This allowed viewers to watch\nprograms on their computers, handheld devices, the Nintendo Wii game system, the Sony PlayStation 3\ngame system, and the Microsoft Xbox 360 game system without ever having the disc itself.\nAdditionally, by late 2007 film studios also became anxious over another trend: the Redbox rental system.\nRedbox, an American company that places DVD rental vending machines in pharmacies, grocery stores,\nand fast-food chains around the country, had placed a kiosk in approximately 22,000 locations by\n2009. [12] For the movie industry, the trouble isn\u2019t the widespread availability of Redbox rentals, it\u2019s the\nprice. As of March 2001, customers can rent DVDs from a Redbox kiosk for only $1 per day, which has\nalready led to a severe decline in rental revenue for the film industry. [13] According to the traditional\npricing model, prices for rentals are based on a release window; newly released films cost more to rent for\na specified period of time after their release. When customers can rent both older and newly released\nmovies at the same low price, rentals don\u2019t produce the same returns. [14]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n372 Hollywood has also suffered major losses from online piracy. Since 2007, studios have been teaming up to\nturn this potential threat into a source of income. Now, instead of illegally downloading their favorite\nmovies from file-sharing sites, fans can go to legal, commercial-supported sites like Hulu.com, where they\ncan access a selected variety of popular movies and TV shows for the same price as accessing NBC, ABC,\nand CBS\u2014free. In April 2010, Hulu announced it has already launched this service, the Hulu Plus service,\nin addition to its free service, for users who want access to even more programs, such as Glee. [15] Hulu\ndoesn\u2019t allow viewers to download the films to their home computers, but it does provide a home-viewing\nexperience through online streaming of content. [16]\nThe Industry Goes Digital\nIn an industry where technological innovations can transform production or distribution methods over\nthe course of a few years, it\u2019s incredible to think that most movies are still captured on celluloid film, the\nsame material that Thomas Edison used to capture his kinetoscope images well over a century ago. In\n2002, George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones became the first major Hollywood movie\nfilmed on high-definition digital video. However, the move to digitally filmed movies has been gradual;\nmuch of the movie industry\u2014including directors, producers, studios, and major movie theater chains\u2014\nhas been slow to embrace this major change in filming technology. At the time that Lucas filmed Attack of\nthe Clones, only 18 theaters in the country were equipped with digital projectors. [17]\nHowever, digital cinematography has become an increasingly attractive, and increasingly popular, option\nfor a number of reasons. For one thing, during production, it eliminates the need to reload film. A scene\nfilmed in the traditional method, requiring multiple takes, can now be filmed in one continuous take\nbecause no raw material is being used in the process. [18] The digital format streamlines the editing process\nas well. Rather than scanning the images into a computer before adding digital special effects and color\nadjustments, companies with digitally filmed material can send it electronically to the editing suite.\nAdditionally, digital film files aren\u2019t susceptible to scratching or wear over time, and they are capable of\nproducing crystal-clear, high-resolution images. [19]\nFor distributers and production companies, digitally recorded images eliminate the costs of purchasing,\ndeveloping, and printing film. Studios spend around $800 million each year making prints of the films\nthey distribute to theaters and additional money on top of that to ship the heavy reels. [20] For a film like\nAttack of the Clones, widely released in 3,000 theaters, printing and shipping costs for 35-mm film would\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n373 be around $20 million. [21] On the other hand, with digital format, which requires no printing and can be\nsent to theaters on a single hard drive, or, as the system develops, over cable or satellite, these costs are\nvirtually eliminated. [22]\nIn part, the change has been gradual because, for theaters, the costs of making the digital switch (at\naround $125,000 for a high-quality digital projector[23]) is high, and the transformation offers them fewer\nshort-term incentives than it does for distributors, who could save a significant amount of money with\ndigital technology. Furthermore, theaters have already heavily invested in their current projection\nequipment for 35-mm film. [24] In the long run, the high-definition picture capabilities of digital movies\nmight boost profits as more moviegoers turn out at the theaters, but there are no guarantees. In the\nmeantime, the major studios are negotiating with leading theater chains to underwrite some of the\nconversion expenses. [25]\nAnother financial pitfall of digital film is, surprisingly, the cost of storage once the film is out of major\ncirculation. For major studios, a significant portion of revenues\u2014around one-third\u2014comes from the\nrerelease of old films. Studios invest an annual budget of just over $1,000 per film to keep their 35-\nmillimeter masters in archival storage. [26] Keeping the film stock at controlled temperature and moisture\nlevels prevents degradation, so masters are often stored in mines, where these conditions can be met most\noptimally. [27]\nDigital data however, for all of its sophistication, is actually less likely to last than traditional film is; DVDs\ncan degrade rapidly, with only a 50 percent chance of lasting up to 15 years, [28] while hard drives must be\noperated occasionally to prevent them from locking up. As a result, the storage cost for digital originals\ncomes closer to $12,500 per film per year. [29] Moreover, as one generation of digital technology gives way\nto another, files have to be migrated to newer formats to prevent originals from becoming unreadable.\nThe Resurgence of 3-D\nAfter World War II, as movie attendance began to decline, the motion picture industry experimented with\nnew technologies to entice audiences back into increasingly empty theaters. One such gimmick, the 3-D\npicture, offered the novel experience of increased audience \u201cparticipation\u201d as monsters, flying objects, and\nobstacles appeared to invade the theater space, threatening to collide with spectators. The effect was\nachieved by manipulating filming equipment to work like a pair of human eyes, mimicking the depth of\nfield produced through binocular vision. By joining two cameras together and spacing them slightly apart\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n374 with their lenses angled fractionally toward one another, filmmakers could achieve an effect similar to\nthat created by the overlapping fields of vision of the right and left eye. In theaters, the resulting images\nwere played simultaneously on two separate projectors. The 3-D glasses spectators wore were polarized to\nfilter the images so that the left eye received only \u201cleft eye\u201d projections and the right eye received only\n\u201cright eye\u201d projections. [30]\n3-D was an instant sensation. House of Wax, the first big-budget 3-D movie, released in 1953, brought in\nover $1 million during its first 3 weeks in theaters, making it one of the most successful films of the year.\nBest of all for investors, 3-D could be created with fairly inexpensive equipment. For this reason, a boom\nof 3-D development soon occurred nationwide. Forty-six 3-D movies were filmed in a span of 2 years.\nHowever, 3-D proved to be a brief success, with its popularity already beginning to wane by the end of\n1953. [31]\n3-D soon migrated from the realm of common popular entertainment to novelty attraction, appearing in\nIMAX cinemas, as an occasional marketing draw for kids\u2019 movies, and in theme-park classics like Captain\nEo and Honey, I Shrunk the Audience. Captain Eo, a Disneyland attraction from 1986 to 1993, featured\npop sensation Michael Jackson in his heyday. Following Jackson\u2019s death, the film was rereleased for a\nlimited time in 2010.[32]\nDespite the marginal role 3-D has played since the midcentury fad died out, new technologies have\nbrought about a resurgence in the trend, and the contemporary 3-D experience seems less like a gimmick\nand more like a serious development in the industry. DreamWorks animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, for\none, likened the new 3-D to the introduction of color. [33] One of the downfalls that lead to the decline of 3-\nD in the 1950s was the \u201c3-D headache\u201d phenomenon audiences began to experience as a result of\ntechnical problems with filming. [34] To create the 3-D effect, filmmakers need to calculate the point where\nthe overlapping images converge, an alignment that had to be performed by hand in those early years.\nAnd for the resulting image to come through clearly, the parallel cameras must run in perfect sync with\none another\u2014another impossibility with 35-millimeter film, which causes some distortion by the very fact\nof its motion through the filming camera.\nToday the 3-D headache is a thing of the past, as computerized calibration makes perfect camera\nalignment a reality and as the digital recording format eliminates the celluloid-produced distortion.\nFinally, a single digital projector equipped with a photo-optical device can now perform the work of the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n375 two synchronized projectors of the past. For the theater chains, 3-D provides the first real incentive to\nmake the conversion to digital. Not only do audiences turn out in greater numbers for an experience they\ncan\u2019t reproduce at home, even on their HD television sets, but theaters are also able to charge more for\ntickets to see 3-D films. In 2008, for example, Journey to the Center of the Earth, which grossed $102\nmillion, earned 60 percent of that money through 3-D ticket sales, even though it played in 3-D on only 30\npercent of its screens. [35] Two of the top-grossing movies of all time, Avatar (2009) and Alice in\nWonderland (2010), were both released in 3-D.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The introduction of the VCR in the late 1970s made home movie viewing easy. The VCR was replaced by\nDVD technology in the late 1990s, which is currently being replaced by Blu-ray Disc technology.\n\uf0b7 DVD sales and rentals account for about a third of film revenues. Some films are released straight to DVD\nwithout ever appearing in theaters.\n\uf0b7 Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002) was the first big-budget film to be recorded digitally.\nSince then, many more films have been made with digital cinematography. However a full-scale industry\nchange has been gradual, mainly because of the costs of conversion.\n\uf0b7 Three-dimensional movies were a fad in the 1950s. In recent years, because of improved technologies, 3-\nD movies have seen a resurgence.\nEXERCISES\nImagine you work for a major Hollywood studio and you are negotiating a contract with a large theater\nchain to switch to a digital projection system.

Lasting for more than 3 months, the strike disrupted many hit shows in\n2008 and cost the Los Angeles economy $2.5 billion. [1] While production for many television shows was\non hiatus, several industry executives were thinking of new ways to reach their audience. Declaring that it\nwas \u201ctime to change the face of Show Business as we know it,\u201d Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss\nWhedon started writing a three-part musical series specifically designed to be released on the\nInternet. [2]Starring Neil Patrick Harris as an aspiring supervillain eager to join the Evil League of Evil, Dr.\nHorrible\u2019s Sing-Along Blog featured three 14-minute acts that told the story of Dr. Horrible; his nemesis,\nCaptain Hammer (Nathan Fillion); and their mutual love interest, Penny (Felicia Day). Whedon cowrote\nthe musical with his brothers and funded the $200,000 project, filming the series in a small studio he set\nup in his Los Angeles loft and at several outdoor locations in the city. None of the cast or crew initially\nreceived compensation for the project.\nThe first act of Dr. Horrible was released on its official website on July 15, 2008, hosted by free online\nvideo service Hulu. Act II followed on July 17 and Act III appeared 2 days later. Viewers could watch all\nthree episodes for free online anywhere in the world. Shortly after the free viewing, the tragicomic musical\nwas made available for purchase on iTunes, where it reached No. 1 on the video chart, totaling 2.2 million\ndownloads per week. The soundtrack was also released via iTunes, obtaining the No. 1 spot on the first\nday of its release and debuting at No. 39 on the Billboard 200 chart. Capitalizing on the musical\u2019s online\nsuccess, Whedon greenlit, or authorized, the creation of a DVD, which was released exclusively\nthrough Amazon.com on December 19, 2008, and reached the No. 3 position for Amazon\u2019s movies and\ntelevision sales. Illustrating the participatory nature of the new medium, the DVD extras featured several\nvideo submissions from fans. The 3-minute video clips were winning entries from a competition\nannounced at Comic-Con\u2014an annual comic book and fan convention held in San Diego\u2014in which fans\nexplained why they should be inducted into the Evil League of Evil. The DVD also featured a singing\ncommentary from the cast and crew, performed both in and out of character. Internet downloads, DVD\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n381 sales, and soundtrack sales enabled Whedon to pay back the cast and crew of Dr. Horrible and confirmed\nthe online musical as a viable model for future independent productions.\nAlthough Dr. Horrible was an unlikely commercial success, it quickly became a media sensation. Named\none of the best inventions of 2008 by Time magazine and awarded an Emmy for best short-format live-\naction entertainment program, the online supervillain musical challenged traditional notions that a big-\nbudget studio is necessary to create a hit television series. Along with other successful web television\nseries such as The Guild, Dorm Life, and Lonelygirl15, Dr. Horrible has helped to pave the way for\nsmaller independent companies to create popular entertainment. An understanding of how television\nevolved and how it is beginning to merge with the Internet will provide insight into the future of content\ndelivery and viewer patterns.\n[1] Associated Press, \u201cWriters Strike Cost L.A.

Identify two technological developments that paved the way for the evolution of television.\n2. Explain why electronic television prevailed over mechanical television.\n3. Identify three important developments in the history of television since 1960.\nSince replacing radio as the most popular mass medium in the 1950s, television has played such an\nintegral role in modern life that, for some, it is difficult to imagine being without it. Both reflecting\nand shaping cultural values, television has at times been criticized for its alleged negative influences\non children and young people and at other times lauded for its ability to create a common experience\nfor all its viewers. Major world events such as the John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King\nassassinations and the Vietnam War in the 1960s, the Challenger shuttle explosion in 1986, the 2001\nterrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, and the impact and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in\n2005 have all played out on television, uniting millions of people in shared tragedy and hope. Today,\nas Internet technology and satellite broadcasting change the way people watch television, the\nmedium continues to evolve, solidifying its position as one of the most important inventions of the\n20th century.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n382 The Origins of Television\nInventors conceived the idea of television long before the technology to create it appeared. Early pioneers\nspeculated that if audio waves could be separated from the electromagnetic spectrum to create radio, so\ntoo could television waves be separated to transmit visual images. As early as 1876, Boston civil servant\nGeorge Carey envisioned complete television systems, putting forward drawings for a \u201cselenium camera\u201d\nthat would enable people to \u201csee by electricity\u201d a year later. [1]\nDuring the late 1800s, several technological developments set the stage for television. The invention of\nthe cathode ray tube (CRT) by German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897 played a vital role as the\nforerunner of the television picture tube. Initially created as a scanning device known as the cathode ray\noscilloscope, the CRT effectively combined the principles of the camera and electricity. It had a florescent\nscreen that emitted a visible light (in the form of images) when struck by a beam of electrons. The other\nkey invention during the 1880s was the mechanical scanner system. Created by German inventor Paul\nNipkow, the scanning disk was a large, flat metal disk with a series of small perforations arranged in a\nspiral pattern. As the disk rotated, light passed through the holes, separating pictures into pinpoints of\nlight that could be transmitted as a series of electronic lines. The number of scanned lines equaled the\nnumber of perforations, and each rotation of the disk produced a television frame. Nipkow\u2019s mechanical\ndisk served as the foundation for experiments on the transmission of visual images for several decades.\nIn 1907, Russian scientist Boris Rosing used both the CRT and the mechanical scanner system in an\nexperimental television system. With the CRT in the receiver, he used focused electron beams to display\nimages, transmitting crude geometrical patterns onto the television screen. The mechanical disk system\nwas used as a camera, creating a primitive television system.\nFigure 9.1\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n383 Two key inventions in the 1880s paved the way for television to emerge: the cathode ray tube and\nthe mechanical disk system.\nMechanical Television versus Electronic Television\nFrom the early experiments with visual transmissions, two types of television systems came into\nexistence: mechanical television and electronic television. Mechanical television developed out of\nNipkow\u2019s disk system and was pioneered by British inventor John Logie Baird. In 1926, Baird gave the\nworld\u2019s first public demonstration of a television system at Selfridge\u2019s department store in London. He\nused mechanical rotating disks to scan moving images into electrical impulses, which were transmitted by\ncable to a screen. Here they showed up as a low-resolution pattern of light and dark. Baird\u2019s first\ntelevision program showed the heads of two ventriloquist dummies, which he operated in front of the\ncamera apparatus out of the audience\u2019s sight. In 1928, Baird extended his system by transmitting a signal\nbetween London and New York. The following year, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) adopted\nhis mechanical system, and by 1932, Baird had developed the first commercially viable television system\nand sold 10,000 sets. Despite its initial success, mechanical television had several technical limitations.\nEngineers could get no more than about 240 lines of resolution, meaning images would always be slightly\nfuzzy (most modern televisions produce images of more than 600 lines of resolution). The use of a\nspinning disk also limited the number of new pictures that could be seen per second, resulting in excessive\nflickering. The mechanical aspect of television proved to be a disadvantage that required fixing in order\nfor the technology to move forward.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n384 At the same time Baird (and, separately, American inventor Charles Jenkins) was developing the\nmechanical model, other inventors were working on an electronic television system based on the CRT.\nWhile working on his father\u2019s farm, Idaho teenager Philo Farnsworth realized that an electronic beam\ncould scan a picture in horizontal lines, reproducing the image almost instantaneously. In 1927,\nFarnsworth transmitted the first all-electronic television picture by rotating a single straight line\nscratched onto a square piece of painted glass by 90 degrees.\nFarnsworth barely profited from his invention; during World War II, the government suspended sales of\ntelevision sets, and by the time the war ended, Farnsworth\u2019s original patents were close to expiring.\nHowever, following the war, many of his key patents were modified by RCA and were widely applied in\nbroadcasting to improve television picture quality.\nFigure 9.2\nThe low image resolution of John Logie Baird\u2019s mechanical television was a major disadvantage that led to the\ntechnology\u2019s replacement by electronic television systems.\nHaving coexisted for several years, electronic television sets eventually began to replace mechanical\nsystems. With better picture quality, no noise, a more compact size, and fewer visual limitations, the\nelectronic system was far superior to its predecessor and rapidly improving. By 1939, the last mechanical\ntelevision broadcasts in the United States had been replaced with electronic broadcasts.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n385 Early Broadcasting\nTelevision broadcasting began as early as 1928, when the Federal Radio Commission authorized inventor\nCharles Jenkins to broadcast from W3XK, an experimental station in the Maryland suburbs of\nWashington, DC. Silhouette images from motion picture films were broadcast to the general public on a\nregular basis, at a resolution of just 48 lines. Similar experimental stations ran broadcasts throughout the\nearly 1930s. In 1939, RCA subsidiary NBC (National Broadcasting Company) became the first network to\nintroduce regular television broadcasts, transmitting its inaugural telecast of the opening ceremonies at\nthe New York World\u2019s Fair. The station\u2019s initial broadcasts transmitted to just 400 television sets in the\nNew York area, with an audience of 5,000 to 8,000 people. [2]\nTelevision was initially available only to the privileged few, with sets ranging from $200 to $600\u2014a hefty\nsum in the 1930s, when the average annual salary was $1,368. [3] RCA offered four types of television\nreceivers, which were sold in high-end department stores such as Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdale\u2019s, and\nreceived channels 1 through 5. Early receivers were a fraction of the size of modern television sets,\nfeaturing 5-, 9-, or 12-inch screens. Television sales prior to World War II were disappointing\u2014an\nuncertain economic climate, the threat of war, the high cost of a television receiver, and the limited\nnumber of programs on offer deterred numerous prospective buyers. Many unsold television sets were\nput into storage and sold after the war.\nNBC was not the only commercial network to emerge in the 1930s. RCA radio rival CBS (Columbia\nBroadcasting System) also began broadcasting regular programs. So that viewers would not need a\nseparate television set for each individual network, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\noutlined a single technical standard. In 1941, the panel recommended a 525-line system and an image rate\nof 30 frames per second. It also recommended that all U.S. television sets operate\nusing analog signals (broadcast signals made of varying radio waves). Analog signals were replaced\nby digital signals (signals transmitted as binary code) in 2009.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, many companies, including RCA and General Electric, turned their\nattention to military production. Instead of commercial television sets, they began to churn out military\nelectronic equipment. In addition, the war halted nearly all television broadcasting; many television\nstations reduced their schedules to around 4 hours per week or went off the air altogether.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n386 Color Technology\nAlthough it did not become available until the 1950s or popular until the 1960s, the technology for\nproducing color television was proposed as early as 1904, and was demonstrated by John Logie Baird in\n1928. As with his black-and-white television system, Baird adopted the mechanical method, using a\nNipkow scanning disk with three spirals, one for each primary color (red, green, and blue). In 1940, CBS\nresearchers, led by Hungarian television engineer Peter Goldmark, used Baird\u2019s 1928 designs to develop a\nconcept of mechanical color television that could reproduce the color seen by a camera lens.\nFollowing World War II, the National Television System Committee (NTSC) worked to develop an all-\nelectronic color system that was compatible with black-and-white television sets, gaining FCC approval in\n1953. A year later, NBC made the first national color broadcast when it telecast the Tournament of Roses\nParade. Despite the television industry\u2019s support for the new technology, it would be another 10 years\nbefore color television gained widespread popularity in the United States, and black-and-white television\nsets outnumbered color television sets until 1972. [4]\nThe Golden Age of Television\nFigure 9.3\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n387 During the so-called \u201cgolden age\u201d of television, the percentage of U.S. households that owned a\ntelevision set rose from 9 percent in 1950 to 95.3 percent in 1970.\nThe 1950s proved to be the golden age of television, during which the medium experienced massive\ngrowth in popularity. Mass-production advances made during World War II substantially lowered the cost\nof purchasing a set, making television accessible to the masses. In 1945, there were fewer than 10,000\ntelevision sets in the United States. By 1950, this figure had soared to around 6 million, and by 1960 more\nthan 60 million television sets had been sold. [5]Many of the early television program formats were based\non network radio shows and did not take advantage of the potential offered by the new medium. For\nexample, newscasters simply read the news as they would have during a radio broadcast, and the network\nrelied on newsreel companies to provide footage of news events. However, during the early 1950s,\ntelevision programming began to branch out from radio broadcasting, borrowing from theater to create\nacclaimed dramatic anthologies such as Playhouse 90 (1956) and The U.S. Steel Hour (1953) and\nproducing quality news film to accompany coverage of daily events.\nTwo new types of programs\u2014the magazine format and the television spectacular\u2014played an important\nrole in helping the networks gain control over the content of their broadcasts. Early television programs\nwere developed and produced by a single sponsor, which gave the sponsor a large amount of control over\nthe content of the show. By increasing program length from the standard 15-minute radio show to 30\nminutes or longer, the networks substantially increased advertising costs for program sponsors, making it\nprohibitive for a single sponsor. Magazine programs such as the Today show and The Tonight Show,\nwhich premiered in the early 1950s, featured multiple segments and ran for several hours. They were also\nscreened on a daily, rather than weekly, basis, drastically increasing advertising costs. As a result, the\nnetworks began to sell spot advertisements that ran for 30 or 60 seconds. Similarly, the television\nspectacular (now known as the television special) featured lengthy music-variety shows that were\nsponsored by multiple advertisers.\nIn the mid-1950s, the networks brought back the radio quiz-show genre. Inexpensive and easy to produce,\nthe trend caught on, and by the end of the 1957\u20131958 season, 22 quiz shows were being aired on network\ntelevision, including CBS\u2019s $64,000 Question. Shorter than some of the new types of programs, quiz\nshows enabled single corporate sponsors to have their names displayed on the set throughout the show.\nThe popularity of the quiz-show genre plunged at the end of the decade, however, when it was discovered\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n388 that most of the shows were rigged. Producers provided some contestants with the answers to the\nquestions in order to pick and choose the most likable or controversial candidates. When a slew of\ncontestants accused the show Dotto of being fixed in 1958, the networks rapidly dropped 20 quiz shows. A\nNew York grand jury probe and a 1959 congressional investigation effectively ended prime-time quiz\nshows for 40 years, until ABC revived the genre with its launch of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in\n1999. [6]\nThe Rise of Cable Television\nFormerly known as Community Antenna Television, or CATV, cable television was originally developed in\nthe 1940s in remote or mountainous areas, including in Arkansas, Oregon, and Pennsylvania, to enhance\npoor reception of regular television signals. Cable antennas were erected on mountains or other high\npoints, and homes connected to the towers would receive broadcast signals.\nIn the late 1950s, cable operators began to experiment with microwave to bring signals from distant cities.\nTaking advantage of their ability to receive long-distance broadcast signals, operators branched out from\nproviding a local community service and began focusing on offering consumers more extensive\nprogramming choices. Rural parts of Pennsylvania, which had only three channels (one for each network),\nsoon had more than double the original number of channels as operators began to import programs from\nindependent stations in New York and Philadelphia. The wider variety of channels and clearer reception\nthe service offered soon attracted viewers from urban areas. By 1962, nearly 800 cable systems were\noperational, serving 850,000 subscribers.\nFigure 9.5\nThe Evolution of Television\nCable\u2019s exponential growth was viewed as competition by local television stations, and broadcasters\ncampaigned for the FCC to step in. The FCC responded by placing restrictions on the ability of cable\nsystems to import signals from distant stations, which froze the development of cable television in major\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n389 markets until the early 1970s. When gradual deregulation began to loosen the restrictions, cable operator\nService Electric launched the service that would change the face of the cable television industry\u2014pay TV.\nThe 1972 Home Box Office (HBO) venture, in which customers paid a subscription fee to access premium\ncable television shows and video-on-demand products, was the nation\u2019s first successful pay cable service.\nHBO\u2019s use of a satellite to distribute its programming made the network available throughout the United\nStates. This gave it an advantage over the microwave-distributed services, and other cable providers\nquickly followed suit. Further deregulation provided by the 1984 Cable Act enabled the industry to expand\neven further, and by the end of the 1980s, nearly 53 million households subscribed to cable television\n(see Section 6.3 \"Current Popular Trends in the Music Industry\"). In the 1990s, cable operators upgraded\ntheir systems by building higher-capacity hybrid networks of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.\nThese broadband networks provide a multichannel television service, along with telephone, high-speed\nInternet, and advanced digital video services, using a single wire.\nThe Emergence of Digital Television\nFollowing the FCC standards set out during the early 1940s, television sets received programs via analog\nsignals made of radio waves. The analog signal reached television sets through three different methods:\nover the airwaves, through a cable wire, or by satellite transmission. Although the system remained in\nplace for more than 60 years, it had several disadvantages. Analog systems were prone to static and\ndistortion, resulting in a far poorer picture quality than films shown in movie theaters. As television sets\ngrew increasingly larger, the limited resolution made scan lines painfully obvious, reducing the clarity of\nthe image. Companies around the world, most notably in Japan, began to develop technology that\nprovided newer, better-quality television formats, and the broadcasting industry began to lobby the FCC\nto create a committee to study the desirability and impact of switching to digital television. A more\nefficient and flexible form of broadcast technology, digital television uses signals that translate television\nimages and sounds into binary code, working in much the same way as a computer. This means they\nrequire much less frequency space and also provide a far higher quality picture. In 1987, the Advisory\nCommittee on Advanced Television Services began meeting to test various television systems, both analog\nand digital. The committee ultimately agreed to switch from analog to digital format in 2009, allowing a\ntransition period in which broadcasters could send their signal on both an analog and a digital channel.\nOnce the switch took place, many older analog television sets were unusable without a cable or satellite\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n390 service or a digital converter. To retain consumers\u2019 access to free over-the-air television, the federal\ngovernment offered $40 gift cards to people who needed to buy a digital converter, expecting to recoup its\ncosts by auctioning off the old analog broadcast spectrum to wireless companies. [7] These companies were\neager to gain access to the analog spectrum for mobile broadband projects because this frequency band\nallows signals to travel greater distances and penetrate buildings more easily.\nThe Era of High-Definition Television\nAround the same time the U.S. government was reviewing the options for analog and digital television\nsystems, companies in Japan were developing technology that worked in conjunction with digital signals\nto create crystal-clear pictures in a wide-screen format. High-definition television, or HDTV, attempts to\ncreate a heightened sense of realism by providing the viewer with an almost three-dimensional\nexperience. It has a much higher resolution than standard television systems, using around five times as\nmany pixels per frame. First available in 1998, HDTV products were initially extremely expensive, priced\nbetween $5,000 and $10,000 per set. However, as with most new technology, prices dropped\nconsiderably over the next few years, making HDTV affordable for mainstream shoppers.\nAs of 2010, nearly half of American viewers are watching television in high definition, the fastest adoption\nof television technology since the introduction of the VCR in the 1980s. [8] The new technology is attracting\nviewers to watch television for longer periods of time. According to the Nielsen Company, a company that\nmeasures television viewership, households with HDTV watch 3 percent more prime-time television\u2014\nprogramming screened between 7 and 11 p.m., when the largest audience is available\u2014than their\nstandard-definition counterparts. [9] The same report claims that the cinematic experience of HDTV is\nbringing families back together in the living room in front of the large wide-screen television and out of\nthe kitchen and bedroom, where individuals tend to watch television alone on smaller screens. However,\nthese viewing patterns may change again soon as the Internet plays an increasingly larger role in how\npeople view television programs. The impact of new technologies on television is discussed in much\ngreater detail in Section 9.4 \"Influence of New Technologies\" of this chapter.\nFigure 9.7\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n391 Since 1950, the amount of time the average household spends watching television has almost\ndoubled.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Two key technological developments in the late 1800s played a vital role in the evolution of television: the\ncathode ray tube and the scanning disk. The cathode ray tube, invented by German physicist Karl\nFerdinand Braun in 1897, was the forerunner of the television picture tube. It had a florescent screen that\nemitted a visible light (in the form of images) when struck by a beam of electrons. The scanning disk,\ninvented by German inventor Paul Nipkow, was a large, flat metal disk that could be used as a rotating\ncamera. It served as the foundation for experiments on the transmission of visual images for several\ndecades.\n\uf0b7 Out of the cathode ray tube and the scanning disk, two types of primitive television systems evolved:\nmechanical systems and electronic systems. Mechanical television systems had several technical\ndisadvantages: low resolution caused fuzzy images, and the use of a spinning disk limited the number of\nnew pictures that could be seen per second, resulting in excessive flickering. By 1939, all mechanical\ntelevision broadcasts in the United States had been replaced by electronic broadcasts.\n\uf0b7 Early televisions were expensive, and the technology was slow to catch on because development was\ndelayed during World War II. Color technology was delayed even further because early color systems\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n392 were incompatible with black-and-white television sets. Following the war, television rapidly replaced\nradio as the new mass medium. During the \u201cgolden age\u201d of television in the 1950s, television moved away\nfrom radio formats and developed new types of shows, including the magazine-style variety show and the\ntelevision spectacular.\n\uf0b7 Since 1960, several key technological developments have taken place in the television industry. Color\ntelevision gained popularity in the late 1960s and began to replace black-and-white television in the\n1970s. Cable television, initially developed in the 1940s to cater to viewers in rural areas, switched its\nfocus from local to national television, offering an extensive number of channels. In 2009, the traditional\nanalog system, which had been in place for 60 years, was replaced with digital television, giving viewers a\nhigher-quality picture and freeing up frequency space. As of 2010, nearly half of American viewers have\nhigh-definition television, which offers a crystal-clear picture in wide-screen to provide a cinematic\nexperience at home.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following writing prompts.

Identify ways in which American culture is reflected on television.\n2. Identify ways in which television affects the development of American culture.\nSince its inception as an integral part of American life in the 1950s, television has both reflected and\nnurtured cultural mores and values. From the escapist dramas of the 1960s, which consciously\navoided controversial issues and glossed over life\u2019s harsher realities in favor of an idealized portrayal,\nto the copious reality television shows in recent years, on which participants discuss even the most\npersonal and taboo issues, television has held up a mirror to society. But the relationship between\nsocial attitudes and television is reciprocal; broadcasters have often demonstrated their power to\ninfluence viewers, either consciously through slanted political commentary, or subtly, by portraying\ncontroversial relationships (such as single parenthood, same-sex marriages, or interracial couplings)\nas socially acceptable. The symbiotic nature of television and culture is exemplified in every\nbroadcast, from family sitcoms to serious news reports.\nCultural Influences on Television\nIn the 1950s, most television entertainment programs ignored current events and political issues. Instead,\nthe three major networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) developed prime-time shows that would appeal to a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n394 general family audience. Chief among these types of shows was the domestic comedy\u2014a generic family\ncomedy that was identified by its character-based humor and usually set within the home. Seminal\nexamples included popular 1950s shows such as Leave It to Beaver, The Donna Reed Show, and The\nAdventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Presenting a standardized version of the white middle-class suburban\nfamily, domestic comedies portrayed the conservative values of an idealized American life. Studiously\navoiding prevalent social issues such as racial discrimination and civil rights, the shows focused on mostly\nwhite middle-class families with traditional nuclear roles (mother in the home, father in the office) and\nimplied that most domestic problems could be solved within a 30-minute time slot, always ending with a\nstrong moral lesson.\nAlthough these shows depicted an idealized version of American family life, many families in the 1950s\nwere traditional nuclear families. Following the widespread poverty, political uncertainty, and physical\nseparation of the war years, many Americans wanted to settle down, have children, and enjoy the peace\nand security that family life appeared to offer. During the booming postwar era, a period of optimism and\nprosperity, the traditional nuclear family flourished. However, the families and lifestyles presented in\ndomestic comedies did not encompass the overall American experience by any stretch of the imagination.\nAs historian Stephanie Coontz points out, \u201cthe June Cleaver or Donna Stone homemaker role was not\navailable to the more than 40 percent of black women with small children who worked outside the\nhome.\u201d [1] Although nearly 60 percent of the U.S. population was labeled middle class by the mid-1950s,\n25 percent of all families and more than 50 percent of two-parent black families were poor. Migrant\nworkers suffered horrific deprivations, and racial tensions were rife. None of this was reflected in the\nworld of domestic comedies, where even the Hispanic gardener in Father Knows Best was named Frank\nSmith. [2]\nNot all programs in the 1950s were afraid to tackle controversial social or political issues. In March 1954,\njournalist Edward R. Murrow broadcast an unflattering portrait of U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy on his\nshow See It Now. McCarthy, a member of the Senate Investigation Committee, had launched inquiries\nregarding potential Communist infiltration in U.S. institutions. Murrow thought that McCarthy\u2019s\naggressive tactics were a potential threat to civil liberties. His portrait cast the senator from Wisconsin in\nan unflattering light by pointing out contradictions in his speeches. This led to such an uproar that\nMcCarthy was formally reprimanded by the U.S. Senate. [3]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n395 Entertainment programs also tackled controversial issues. The long-running television western\nGunsmoke, which aired on CBS from 1955 to 1975, flourished in a Cold War society, where U.S. Marshal\nMatt Dillon (James Arness) stood up to lawlessness in defense of civilization. The characters and\ncommunity in Gunsmoke faced relevant social issues, including the treatment of minority groups, the\nmeaning of family, the legitimacy of violence, and the strength of religious belief. During the 1960s, the\nshow adapted to the desires of its viewing audience, becoming increasingly aware of and sympathetic to\nethnic minorities, in tune with the national mood during the civil rights era. This adaptability helped the\nshow to become the longest-running western in television history.\nViolence and Escapism in the 1960s\nDuring the 1960s, television news broadcasts brought the realities of real-world events into people\u2019s living\nrooms in vivid detail. The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, which debuted in 1962, quickly\nbecame the country\u2019s most popular newscast, and by the end of the decade, journalist Walter Cronkite was\nknown as the most trusted man in America. Following John F. Kennedy\u2019s election to the presidency at the\nbeginning of the decade, the 1960s took an ominous turn. Shocked viewers tuned into Cronkite\u2019s\nbroadcast on November 22, 1963, to learn about the assassination of their president. During the next few\ndays, viewers followed every aspect of the tragedy on television, from the tremor in Cronkite\u2019s voice as he\nremoved his glasses and announced the news of Kennedy\u2019s death, to the frantic scenes from Dallas police\nheadquarters where the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was gunned down by nightclub owner Jack Ruby, to\nthe thousands of mourners lining up next to the president\u2019s flag-draped coffin.\nAround the same time as Kennedy\u2019s assassination, horrific images from Vietnam were streaming into\npeople\u2019s living rooms during the nation\u2019s first televised war. With five camera crews on duty in the Saigon\nbureau, news crews captured vivid details of the war in progress. Although graphic images were rarely\nshown on network television, several instances of violence reached the screen, including a CBS report in\n1965 that showed Marines lighting the thatched roofs of the village of Cam Ne with Zippo lighters and an\nNBC news report in 1968 that aired a shot of South Vietnamese General Nyuyen Ngoc Loan executing a\ncaptive on a Saigon street. Further images, of children being burned and scarred by napalm and prisoners\nbeing tortured, fueled the antiwar sentiments of many Americans. In addition to the devastation caused\nby the president\u2019s death and the Vietnam War, Americans were also feeling the pressure of the Cold War\u2014\nthe clash between the United States and the Soviet Union in the years following World War II. This\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n396 pressure was especially great during periods of tension throughout the 1950s and 1960s, such as the 1962\nCuban Missile Crisis, a confrontation that caused many people to fear nuclear war.\nAs a result of the intense stress faced by many Americans during the 1960s, broadcasters and viewers\nturned to escapist programs such as I Dream of Jeannie, a fantasy show about a 2,000-year-old genie\nwho marries an astronaut, and Bewitched, a supernatural-themed show about a witch who tries to live as\na suburban housewife. Both shows typified the situation comedy, or sitcom, a comedy genre featuring a\nrecurring cast of characters who resolve zany situations based on their everyday lives. Other popular\nsitcoms in the 1960s included The Beverly Hillbillies, a show about a poor backwoods family who move to\nBeverly Hills, California, after finding oil on their land, and Gilligan\u2019s Island, the ultimate escapist\ncomedy about seven characters shipwrecked on an uncharted island. None of the 1960s sitcoms\nmentioned any of the political unease that was taking place in the outside world, providing audiences with\na welcome diversion from real life. Other than an occasional documentary, television programming in the\n1960s consisted of a sharp dichotomy between prime-time escapist comedy and hard news.\nDiversity and Politics in the 1970s\nDuring the 1970s, broadcasters began to diversify families on their shows to reflect changing social\nattitudes toward formerly controversial issues such as single parenthood and divorce. Feminist groups\nincluding the National Organization for Women (NOW), the National Women\u2019s Political Caucus, and the\nCoalition of Labor Union Women pushed for equality on issues such as pay and encouraged women to\nenter the workforce. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court sanctioned women\u2019s right to abortion, giving them\ncontrol over their reproductive rights. Divorce rates skyrocketed during the 1970s, as states adopted no-\nfault divorce laws, and the change in family dynamics was reflected on television. Between 1972 and 1978,\nCBS aired the socially controversial sitcom Maude. Featuring a middle-aged feminist living with her\nfourth husband and divorced daughter, the show exploded the dominant values of the white middle-class\ndomestic sitcom and its traditional gender roles. Throughout its 7-year run, Maude tackled social and\npolitical issues such as abortion, menopause, birth control, alcoholism, and depression. During its first\nfour seasons, the show was in the top 10 in Nielsen ratings, illustrating the changing tastes of the viewing\naudience, who had come of age during the era of civil rights and Vietnam protests and developed a taste\nfor socially conscious television. Other 1970s sitcoms took the same approach, including Maude\u2019s CBS\npredecessor, All in the Family, which covered issues ranging from racism and homophobia to rape and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n397 miscarriage, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which reflected changing attitudes toward women\u2019s rights\nby featuring television\u2019s first never-married independent career woman as the central character. Even\nwholesome family favorite The Brady Bunch, which ran from 1969 to 1974, featured a non-nuclear family,\nreflecting the rising rates of blended families in American society.\nIn addition to changing family dynamics on sitcoms and other prime-time shows, variety and comedy\nsketch shows developed a political awareness in the 1970s that reflected audiences\u2019 growing appetite for\nsocial and political commentary. Sketch comedyshow Saturday Night Live (SNL) premiered on NBC in\n1975 and has remained on air ever since. Featuring a different celebrity guest host every week and\nrelatively unknown comedy regulars, the show parodies contemporary popular culture and politics,\nlambasting presidential candidates and pop stars alike. Earlier NBC sketch comedy show Laugh-In, which\nran from 1968 to 1973, also featured politically charged material, though it lacked the satirical bite of later\nseries such as SNL. By the end of the decade, television broadcasting reflected a far more politically\nconscious and socially aware viewing audience.\nThe Influence of Cable Television in the 1980s\nUntil the mid-1980s, the top three networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) dominated television broadcasting in\nthe United States. However, as cable services gained popularity following the deregulation of the industry\nin 1984, viewers found themselves with a multitude of options. Services such as Cable News Network\n(CNN), Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN), and Music Television (MTV)\nprofoundly altered the television landscape in the world of news, sports, and music. New markets opened\nup for these innovative program types, as well as for older genres such as the sitcom. During the 1980s, a\nrevival of family sitcoms took place with two enormous hits: The Cosby Show and Family Ties. Both\nfeatured a new take on modern family life, with the mothers working outside of the home and the fathers\npitching in with housework and parental duties. Despite their success on network television, sitcoms faced\nstiff competition from cable\u2019s variety of choices. Between 1983 and 1994, weekly broadcast audience\nshares (a measure of the number of televisions in use that are tuned to a particular show) for network\ntelevision dropped from 69 to 52, while cable networks\u2019 shares rose from 9 to 26. [4]\nWith a growing number of households subscribing to cable television, concern began to grow about the\nlevels of violence to which children were becoming exposed. In addition to regularly broadcast network\nprograms, cable offered viewers the chance to watch films and adult-themed shows during all hours,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n398 many of which had far more violent content than normal network programming. One study found that by\nthe time an average child leaves elementary school, he or she has witnessed 8,000 murders and more\nthan 100,000 other acts of violence on television. [5] Although no conclusive links have been drawn\nbetween witnessing violence on television and carrying out violence in real life, the loosening boundaries\nregarding sexual and violent content on television is a persistent cause for concern for many parents. For\nmore information on the social effects of violence in the media, please refer to Chapter 2 \"Media Effects\".\nSpecialization in the 1990s and 2000s\nAlthough television viewership is growing, the vast number of cable channels and other, newer content\ndelivery platforms means that audiences are thinly stretched. In recent years, broadcasters have been\nnarrowing the focus of their programming to meet the needs and interests of an increasingly fragmented\naudience. Entire cable channels devoted to cooking, music, news, African American interests (see sidebar\nbelow), weather, and courtroom drama enable viewers to choose exactly what type of show they want to\nwatch, and many news channels are further specialized according to viewers\u2019 political opinions. This trend\ntoward specialization reflects a more general shift within society, as companies cater increasingly to\nsmaller, more targeted consumer bases. Business magazine editor Chris Anderson explains, \u201cWe\u2019re\nleaving the watercooler era, when most of us listened, watched and read from the same relatively small\npool of mostly hit content. And we\u2019re entering the microculture era, when we are all into different\nthings.\u201d [6] Just as cable broadcasters are catering to niche markets, Internet-based companies such\nas Amazon.com and Netflix are taking advantage of this concept by selling large numbers of books, DVDs,\nand music albums with narrow appeal. Section 9.3 \"Issues and Trends in the Television\nIndustry\" and Section 9.4 \"Influence of New Technologies\" of this chapter will cover the recent trends and\nissues of this era in television.\nBlack Entertainment Television (BET)\nLaunched in 1980, Black Entertainment Television (BET) was the first television network in the United\nStates dedicated to the interests of African American viewers. The basic-cable franchise was created in\nWashington, DC, by media entrepreneur Robert Johnson, who initially invested $15,000 in the venture.\nWithin a decade, he had turned the company into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, and in 1991 it became\nthe first black-controlled company on the New York Stock Exchange. The company was sold to Viacom in\n2003 for $3 billion.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n399 Predating MTV by a year, BET initially focused on black-oriented music videos but soon diversified into\noriginal urban-oriented programs and public affairs shows. Although BET compensated somewhat for the\nunderrepresentation of blacks on television (African Americans made up 8 percent of the prime-time\ncharacters on television in 1980 but made up 12 percent of the population), viewers complained about the\nportrayal of stereotypical images and inappropriate violent or sexual behavior in many of the rap videos\nshown by the network. In a 2004 interview with BET vice president of communications Michael Lewellen,\nformer BET talk show host Bev Smith said, \u201cWe had videos on BET in those days that were graphic but\ndidn\u2019t proliferate as they seem to be doing now. That\u2019s all you do seem to see are scantily dressed women\nwho a lot of African American women are upset about in those videos.\u201d [7] Despite the criticisms, BET\nremained the No. 1 cable network among blacks 18 to 34 in 2010 and retained an average audience of\n524,000 total viewers during the first quarter of the year. [8]\nTelevision\u2019s Influence on Culture\nDespite entering a microculture era with a variety of niche markets, television remains the most\nimportant unifying cultural presence in the United States. During times of national crises, television news\nbroadcasts have galvanized the country by providing real-time coverage of major events. When terrorists\ncrashed planes into the World Trade Center towers in 2001, 24-hour television news crews provided\nstunned viewers around the world with continuous updates about the attack and its aftermath.\nMeanwhile, network blockbusters such as Lost and 24 have united viewers in shared anticipation,\nlaunching numerous blogs, fan sites, and speculative workplace discussions about characters\u2019 fates.\nTelevised coverage of the news has had several cultural effects since the 1950s. Providing viewers with\nfootage of the most intense human experiences, televised news has been able to reach people in a way that\nradio and newspapers cannot. The images themselves have played an important role in influencing viewer\nopinion. During the coverage of the civil rights movement, for example, footage of a 1963 attack on civil\nrights protesters in Birmingham, Alabama, showed police blasting African American demonstrators\u2014\nmany of them children\u2014with fire hoses. Coupled with images of angry white segregationist mobs squaring\noff against black students, the news footage did much to sway public opinion in favor of liberal legislation\nsuch as the 1964 Voting Rights Act. Conversely, when volatile pictures of the race riots in Detroit and\nother cities in the late 1960s hit the airwaves, horrified viewers saw the need for a return to law and order.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n400 The footage helped create an anti-civil-rights backlash that encouraged many viewers to vote for\nconservative Republican Richard Nixon during the 1968 presidential election.\nDuring the past few decades, mass-media news coverage has gone beyond swaying public opinion through\nmere imagery. Trusted centrist voices such as that of Walter Cronkite, who was known for his impartial\nreporting of some of the biggest news stories in the 1960s, have been replaced by highly politicized news\ncoverage on cable channels such as conservative Fox News and liberal MSNBC. As broadcasters narrow\ntheir focus to cater to more specialized audiences, viewers choose to watch the networks that suit their\npolitical bias. Middle-of-the-road network CNN, which aims for nonpartisanship, frequently loses out in\nthe ratings wars against Fox and MSNBC, both of which have fierce groups of supporters. As one reporter\nput it, \u201cA small partisan base is enough for big ratings; the mildly interested middle might rather\nwatch Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d [9]Critics argue that partisan news networks cause viewers to have less\nunderstanding of opposing political opinions, making them more polarized.\nTable 9.1 Partisan Profile of Television News Audiences 2008\nNews Channel Republican (%) Democratic (%) Independent (%)\nFox News 39 33 22\nNightly Network 22 45 26\nMSNBC 18 45 27\nCNN 18 51 23\nNewsHour 21 46 23\nSource: \u201cPartisanship and Cable News Audiences,\u201d Oct. 30, 2009, Pew Research Center for the People &\nthe Press, a project of the Pew Research Center.\nSocial Controversy\nThe issue of whether television producers have a responsibility to promote particular social values\ncontinues to generate heated discussion. When the unmarried title character in the CBS series Murphy\nBrown\u2014a comedy show about a divorced anchorwoman\u2014got pregnant and chose to have the baby\nwithout any involvement from the father, then\u2013Vice President Dan Quayle referenced the show as an\nexample of degenerating family values. Linking the 1992 Los Angeles riots to a breakdown of family\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n401 structure and social order, Quayle lambasted producers\u2019 poor judgment, saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help matters\nwhen prime-time TV has Murphy Brown, a character who supposedly epitomizes today\u2019s intelligent,\nhighly paid professional woman, mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone, and calling it\njust another \u2018lifestyle choice.\u2019\u201d [10]Quayle\u2019s outburst sparked lively debate between supporters and\nopponents of his viewpoint, with some praising his outspoken social commentary and others dismissing\nhim as out of touch with America and its growing number of single mothers.\nSimilar controversy arose with the portrayal of openly gay characters on prime-time television shows.\nWhen the lead character on the ABC sitcom Ellen came out in 1997 (2 weeks after Ellen DeGeneres, the\nactress who played the role, announced that she was gay), she became the first leading gay character on\nboth broadcast and cable networks. The show proved to be a test case for the nation\u2019s tolerance of openly\ngay characters on prime-time television and became the subject of much debate. Embraced by liberal\nsupporters and lambasted by conservative objectors (evangelical Baptist minister Jerry Falwell\ninfamously dubbed her \u201cEllen DeGenerate\u201d), both the actress and the show furthered the quest to make\nhomosexuality acceptable to mainstream audiences. Although Ellen was canceled the following year (amid\ndisagreements with producers about whether it should contain a parental advisory warning), DeGeneres\nsuccessfully returned to television in 2003 with her own talk show. Subsequent shows with prominent gay\ncharacters were quick to follow in Ellen\u2019s footsteps. According to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against\nDefamation (GLAAD), 18 lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender characters accounted for 3 percent of\nscripted series regulars in the 2009\u20132010 broadcast television schedule, up from 1.3 percent in 2006. [11]\nCreating Stars via Reality Television\nEmerging out of the 1948 television series Candid Camera, in which people were secretly filmed\nresponding to elaborate practical jokes, reality television aimed to capture real, unscripted life on camera.\nThe genre developed in several different directions, from home-video clip shows (America\u2019s Funniest\nHome Videos, America\u2019s Funniest People) to true-crime reenactment shows (America\u2019s Most\nWanted, Unsolved Mysteries) to thematic shows based on professions of interest (Project Runway, Police\nWomen of Broward County, Top Chef). Near the turn of the millennium, the genre began to lean toward\nmore voyeuristic shows, such as MTV\u2019s The Real World, an unscripted \u201cdocumentary\u201d that followed the\nlives of seven strangers selected to live together in a large house or apartment in a major city. The show\ndrew criticisms for glamorizing bad behavior and encouraging excessive drinking and casual sex, although\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n402 its ratings soared with each successive controversy (a trend that critics claim encouraged producers to\nactively stage rating-grabbing scenarios). During the late 1990s and 2000s, a wave of copycat reality\ntelevision shows emerged, including the voyeuristic series Big Brother, which filmed a group of strangers\nliving together in an isolated house full of cameras in an attempt to win large amounts of cash,\nand Survivor, a game show in which participants competed against each other by performing endurance\nchallenges on an uninhabited island. Survivor\u2019s success as the most popular show on television in the\nsummer of 2000 ensured the continued growth of the reality television genre, and producers turned their\nattention to reality dating shows such as The Bachelor, Temptation Island, and Dating in the Dark.\nCheap to produce, with a seemingly never-ending supply of willing contestants and eager advertising\nsponsors, reality television shows continue to bring in big ratings. As of 2010, singing talent\ncompetition American Idol is television\u2019s biggest revenue generator, pulling in $8.1 million in advertising\nsales every 30 minutes it is on the air. [12]\nReality television has created the cultural phenomenon of the instant celebrity. Famous for simply being\non the air, reality show contestants are extending their 15 minutes in the spotlight. Kate Gosselin, star\nof Jon & Kate Plus 8, a cable television show about a couple who have eight children, has since appeared\nin numerous magazine articles, and in 2010 she starred on celebrity reality dance show Dancing with the\nStars. Survivor contestant Elisabeth Hasselbeck became a co-host on television talk show The View, and\nseveral American Idol contestants (including Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood) have become\nhousehold names. The genre has drawn criticism for creating a generation that expects to achieve instant\nwealth without having to try very hard and also for preying on vulnerable people whom critics call\n\u201cdisposable.\u201d When Britain\u2019s Got Talent star Susan Boyle suffered a public meltdown in 2009 after the\nstress of transitioning from obscurity to stardom in an extremely short time period, the media began to\npoint out the dangers of reality television. In 2009, TheWrap.com investigated the current lives of former\nstars of reality shows such as The Contender, Paradise Hotel, Wife Swap, and Extreme Makeover and\nfound that at least 11 participants had committed suicide as an apparent result of their appearances on\nscreen. [13]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Television has been reflecting changing cultural values since it first gained popularity after World War II.\nDuring the 1950s, most programs ignored current events and political issues in favor of family-friendly\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n403 domestic comedies, which featured white suburban middle-class families. Extreme stress during the\n1960s, caused by political events such as the Vietnam War and the Cuban Missile Crisis, led people to turn\nto escapist television offered by fantasy sitcoms. These provided a sharp dichotomy with the hard-news\nshows of the era. Social consciousness during the 1970s prompted television producers to reflect\nchanging social attitudes regarding single parenthood, women\u2019s roles, and divorce, and sitcom families\nbegan to reflect the increasing number of non-nuclear families in society. The increasing popularity of\ncable television in the 1980s led to an explosion of news and entertainment channels, some of which\nraised concerns about the levels of violence on television. During the 1990s and 2000s, television\nnetworks became more specialized, catering to niche markets in order to meet the needs of an\nincreasingly fragmented audience.\n\uf0b7 Television reflects cultural values, and it also influences culture. One example of this is the polarization of\ncable television news, which is no longer centrist but caters to individual political tastes. Critics argue that\nthis influences cable news viewers\u2019 opinions and makes them less open to opposing political viewpoints.\nEntertainment programs also play an influential role within society. By portraying controversial\nrelationships such as single parents or gay couples as acceptable, television shows have the power to\nshape viewers\u2019 attitudes. In recent years, broadcasters have created the concept of the instant celebrity\nthrough the genre of reality television. Contestants on reality television shows now permeate every\naspect of culture and the media, from the music charts to popular magazines and newspapers.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

Explain the influence of sponsors on program content.\n2. Describe the major trends among the broadcasting and cable networks.\nWhen television was in its infancy, producers modeled the new medium on radio. Popular radio\nshows such as police drama Dragnet and western cowboy series Gunsmoke were adapted for\ntelevision, and new television shows were sponsored by single advertisers, just as radio shows had\nbeen. Television was dominated by three major networks\u2014NBC, ABC, and CBS\u2014and these networks\naccounted for more than 95 percent of all prime-time viewing until the late 1970s. Today, the\ntelevision industry is far more complex. Programs are sponsored by multiple advertisers;\nprogramming is controlled by major media conglomerates; and the three major networks no longer\ndominate the airwaves but instead share their viewers with numerous cable channels. Several factors\naccount for these trends within the industry, including technological developments, government\nregulations, and the creation of new networks.\nThe Influence of Corporate Sponsorship\nEarly television programs were often developed, produced, and supported by a single sponsor, which\nsometimes reaped the benefits of having its name inserted into the program\u2019s title\u2014Colgate Comedy\nHour, Camel Newsreel, Goodyear TV Playhouse. However, as production costs soared during the 1950s\n(a single one-hour television show cost a sponsor about $35,000 in 1952 compared with $90,000 at the\nend of the decade), sponsors became increasingly unable to bear the financial burden of promoting a show\nsingle-handedly. This suited the broadcast networks, which disliked the influence sponsors exerted over\nprogram content. Television executives, in particular NBC\u2019s Sylvester L. \u201cPat\u201d Weaver, advocated the\nmagazine concept, in which advertisers purchased one- or two-minute blocks rather than the entire\nprogram, just as magazines contained multiple advertisements from different sponsors. The presence of\nmultiple sponsors meant that no one advertiser controlled the entire program.\nAlthough advertising agencies relinquished control of production to the networks, they retained some\ninfluence over the content of the programs they sponsored. As one executive commented, \u201cIf my client\nsells peanut butter and the script calls for a guy to be poisoned eating a peanut butter sandwich, you can\nbet we\u2019re going to switch that poison to a martini.\u201d [1] Sponsors continue to influence program content\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n406 indirectly by financially supporting shows they support and pulling funding from those they do not. For\nexample, in 1995, pharmaceutical giant Procter & Gamble, the largest television advertiser, announced it\nwould no longer sponsor salacious daytime talk shows. The company provided producers with details\nabout its guidelines, pulling out of shows it deemed offensive and supporting shows that dealt with\ncontroversial subject matter responsibly. Communications heavyweight AT&T took a similar path,\nreviewing shows after they were taped but before they aired in order to make decisions about corporate\nsponsorship on an individual basis. [2] In 2009, advertisers used their financial might to take a stand\nagainst Fox News host Glenn Beck, who offended viewers and sponsors alike with his incendiary\ncomments that President Obama was a \u201cracist\u201d and had a \u201cdeep-seated hatred for white people.\u201d Sponsors\nof the Glenn Beck television talk show began to remove advertising spots from the program in protest of\nBeck\u2019s comments. A spokeswoman for Progressive car insurance said, \u201cWe place advertising on a variety\nof programming with the goal of reaching a broad range of insurance consumers who might be interested\nin our products. We also seek to avoid advertising on programming that our customers or potential\ncustomers may find extremely offensive.\u201d [3] Other shows whose advertisers have pulled ads include NBC\u2019s\nlong-running sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, BET\u2019s Hot Ghetto Mess, and ABC\u2019s Ellen sitcom.\nPublic Television and Corporate Sponsorship\nCorporate sponsorship does not just affect network television. Even public television has become subject\nto the influence of advertising. Established in 1969, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) developed out of a\nreport by the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television, which examined the role of educational,\nnoncommercial television on society. The report recommended that the government finance public\ntelevision in order to provide diversity of programming during the network era\u2014a service created \u201cnot to\nsell products\u201d but to \u201cenhance citizenship and public service.\u201d [4] Public television was also intended to\nprovide universal access to television for viewers in rural areas or viewers who could not afford to pay for\nprivate television services. PBS focused on educational program content, targeting viewers who were less\nappealing to the commercial networks and advertisers, such as the over-50 age demographic and children\nunder 12.\nThe original Carnegie Commission report recommended that Congress create a federal trust fund based\non a manufacturer\u2019s excise tax on the sale of television sets to finance public television. Following intense\nlobbying by the National Association of Broadcasters, the proposal was removed from the legislation that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n407 established the service. As a result, public television subsists on viewer contributions and federal funding\nand the latter has been drastically reduced in recent years. Although a 2007 proposal by President George\nW. Bush to eliminate more than half of the federal allocation to public broadcasting ($420 million out of\n$820 million) was overturned, PBS has become increasingly dependent on corporate sponsorship to stay\nafloat. By 2006, corporate sponsors funded more than 25 percent of all public television. Sponsorship has\nsaved many programs that would otherwise have been lost, but critics have bemoaned the creeping\ncommercialism of public television. When PBS began selling banner advertisements on its website in\n2006, Gary Ruskin, executive director of consumer group Commercial Alert, commented, \u201cIt\u2019s just one\nmore intrusion of the commercial ethos into an organization that was supposed to be firmly\nnoncommercial. The line between them and the commercial networks is getting fuzzier and\nfuzzier.\u201d [5] Despite such criticisms, the drop in federal funding has forced public television executives to\nseek more creative ways of obtaining financial backing\u2014for example, through online banner ads. In 2009,\nPBS shortened the length of time companies were required to sponsor some programs in an effort to\nencourage advertisers. [6] As of 2010, the future of PBS remained uncertain. With better-funded cable\nchannels offering niche-interest shows that were traditionally public television\u2019s domain (BBC nature\nseries Planet Earth was shown on the Discovery Channel, while historical dramas John Adams and The\nTudors are shown on premium cable channels HBO and Showtime), PBS is left to rely on shows that have\nbeen around for decades, such as Nova and Nature, to attract audiences. [7] Only time will tell how PBS\nfares in the face of competition.\nThe Rise and Fall of the Network\nThe period between 1950 and 1970 is historically recognized as the network era. Aside from a small\nportion of airtime controlled by public television, the three major networks (known as the Big Three)\ndominated the television industry, collectively accounting for more than 95 percent of prime-time\nviewing. In 1986, Rupert Murdoch, the head of multinational company News Corp, launched the Fox\nnetwork, challenging the dominance of the Big Three. In its infancy, Fox was at best a minor irritation to\nthe other networks. With fewer than 100 affiliated stations (the other networks all had more than 200\naffiliates each), reaching just 80 percent of the nation\u2019s households (compared with the Big Three\u2019s 97\npercent coverage rate), and broadcasting just one show (The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers), Fox was\nbarely a consideration in the ratings war. During the early 1990s, these dynamics began to change.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n408 Targeting young viewers and black audiences with shows such as Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, In\nLiving Color, and The Simpsons, Fox began to establish itself as an edgy, youth-oriented network. Luring\naffiliates away from other networks to increase its viewership, Fox also extended its programming\nschedule beyond the initial 2-night-a-week broadcasts. By the time the fledgling network acquired the\nrights to National Football League (NFL) games with its $1.58 billion NFL deal in 1994, entitling it to 4\nyears of NFL games, Fox was a worthy rival to the other three broadcast networks. Its success turned the\nBig Three into the Big Four. In the 1994\u20131995 television season, 43 percent of U.S. households were\nwatching the Big Four at any given moment during prime time.[8]\nFox\u2019s success prompted the launch of several smaller networks in the mid-1990s. UPN (owned by\nParamount, recently acquired by Viacom) and WB (owned by media giant Time Warner) both debuted in\nJanuary 1995. Using strategies similar to Fox, the networks initially began broadcasting programs 2\nnights a week, expanding to a 6-day schedule by 2000. Targeting young and minority audiences with\nshows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Moesha, Dawson\u2019s Creek, and The Wayans Bros., the new\nnetworks hoped to draw stations away from their old network affiliations. However, rather than repeating\nthe success of Fox, UPN and WB struggled to make an impact. Unable to attract many affiliate stations,\nthe two fledgling networks reached fewer households than their larger rivals because they were\nunobtainable in some smaller cities. High start-up costs, relatively low audience ratings, and increasing\nproduction expenses spelled the end of the \u201cnetlets,\u201d a term coined by Variety magazine for minor-league\nnetworks that lacked a full week\u2019s worth of programming. After losing $1 billion each, parent companies\nCBS (having split from Viacom) and Time Warner agreed to merge UPN and WB, resulting in the creation\nof the CW network in 2006. Targeting the desirable 18\u201334 age group, the network retained the most\npopular shows from before the merger\u2014America\u2019s Next Top Model and Veronica Mars from UPN\nand Beauty and the Geek and Smallville from WB\u2014as well as launching new shows such as Gossip\nGirl and The Vampire Diaries. Despite its cofounders\u2019 claims that the CW would be the \u201cfifth great\nbroadcast network,\u201d the collaboration got off to a shaky start. Frequently outperformed by Spanish-\nlanguage television network Univision in 2008 and with declining ratings among its target audience,\ncritics began to question the future of the CW network. [9] However, the relative success of shows such\nas Gossip Girl and90210 in 2009 gave the network a foothold on its intended demographic, quashing\nrumors that co-owners CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. might disband the network. Warner Bros.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n409 Television Group President Bruce Rosenblum said, \u201cI think the built-in assumption and the expectation is\nthat the CW is here to stay.\u201d [10]\nFigure 9.14\nDespite launching several new shows geared toward its target demographic, the CW remains fifth\nin the network rankings.\nCable Challenges the Networks\nA far greater challenge to network television than the emergence of smaller competitors was the\nincreasing dominance of cable television. Between 1994 and 2009, the percentage of U.S. households\nwatching the Big Four networks during prime time plummeted from 43 percent to 27 percent. [11] Two key\nfactors influenced the rapid growth of cable television networks: industry deregulation and the use of\nsatellites to distribute local television stations around the country.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n410 During the 1970s, the growth of cable television was restricted by FCC regulations, which protected\nbroadcasters by establishing franchising standards and enforcing anti-siphoning rules that prevented\ncable from taking sports and movie programming away from the networks. However, during the late\n1970s, a court ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority, and the anti-siphoning rules were repealed.\nThis decision paved the way for the development of cable movie channels, contributing to the exponential\ngrowth of cable in the 1980s and 1990s. Further deregulation of cable in the 1984 Cable Communications\nPolicy Act removed restrictions on cable rates, enabling operators to charge what they wanted for cable\nservices as long as there was effective competition to the service (a standard that over 90 percent of all\ncable markets could meet). Other deregulatory policies during the 1980s included the eradication of\npublic-service requirements and the elimination of regulated amounts of advertising in children\u2019s\nprogramming, expanding the scope of cable channel stations. Deregulation was intended to encourage\ncompetition within the industry but instead enabled local cable companies to establish monopolies all\nover the country. In 1989, U.S. Senator Al Gore of Tennessee commented, \u201cPrecipitous rate hikes of 100\npercent or more in one year have not been unusual since cable was given total freedom to charge whatever\nthe market will bear\u2026. Since cable was deregulated, we have also witnessed an extraordinary\nconcentration of control and integration by cable operators and program services, manifesting itself in\nblatantly anticompetitive behavior toward those who would compete with existing cable operators for the\nright to distribute services.\u201d [12] The FCC reintroduced regulations for basic cable rates in 1992, by which\ntime more than 56 million households (over 60 percent of the households with televisions) subscribed to a\ncable service.\nThe growth of cable television was also assisted by a national satellite distribution system. Pioneered by\nTime Inc., which founded cable network company HBO, the corporation used satellite transmission in\n1975 to beam the \u201cThrilla from Manila\u201d\u2014the historic heavyweight boxing match between Muhammad Ali\nand Joe Frazier\u2014into people\u2019s homes. Shortly afterward, entrepreneur Ted Turner, owner of independent\nAtlanta-based station WTBS, uplinked his station\u2019s signal onto the same satellite as HBO, enabling cable\noperators to downlink the station on one of their channels. Initially provided free to subscribers to\nencourage interest, the station offered television reruns, wrestling, and live sports from Atlanta. Having\ncreated the first \u201csuperstation,\u201d Turner expanded his realm by founding 24-hour news network CNN in\n1980. At the end of the year, 28 national programming services were available, and the cable revolution\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n411 had begun. Over the next decade, the industry underwent a period of rapid growth and popularity, and by\n1994 viewers could choose from 94 basic and 20 premium cable services.\nFigure 9.15\nThe 1975 \u201cThrilla from Manila\u201d was one of the first offerings by HBO.\nNarrowcasting\nBecause the proliferation of cable channels provided viewers with so many choices, broadcasters began to\nmove away from mass-oriented programming in favor of more targeted shows. Whereas the broadcast\nnetworks sought to obtain the widest audience possible by avoiding programs that might only appeal to a\nsmall minority of viewers, cable channels sought out niche audiences within specific demographic\ngroups\u2014a process known as narrowcasting. In much the same way that specialist magazines target\nreaders interested in a particular sport or hobby, cable channels emphasize one topic, or group of related\ntopics, that appeal to specific viewers (often those who have been neglected by broadcast television).\nPeople interested in current affairs can tune into CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, or any number of other news\nchannels, while those interested in sports can switch on ESPN or TSN (The Sports Network). Other\nchannels focus on music, shopping, comedy, science fiction, or programs aimed at specific cultural or\ngender groups. Narrowcasting has proved beneficial for advertisers and marketers, who no longer need to\ntime their communications based on the groups of people who are most likely to watch television at\ncertain times of the day. Instead, they concentrate their approach on subscription channels that appeal\ndirectly to their target consumers.\nImpact on Networks\nThe popularity of cable television has forced the Big Four networks to rethink their approach to\nprogramming over the past three decades. Because of the narrowcasting mode of distribution and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n412 exhibition, cable television has offered more explicit sexual and violent content than broadcast television\ndoes. To compete for cable channels\u2019 viewing audience, broadcast networks have loosened restrictions on\ngraphic material and now frequently feature partial nudity, violence, and coarse language. This has\nincreased viewership of mildly controversial shows such as CSI, NCIS, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and Private\nPractice, while opening the networks to attacks from conservative advocacy groups that object to extreme\ncontent.\nThe broadcast networks are increasingly adapting narrowcasting as a programming strategy. Newer\nnetworks, such as the CW, deliberately target the 18\u201334 age group (women in particular). Since its\ninception, the CW has replaced urban comedies such as Everybody Hates Chris with female-oriented\nseries such as Gossip Girl and The Vampire Diaries. Older networks group similar programs that appeal\nto specific groups in adjacent time slots to retain viewers for as long as possible. For example, ABC\nsitcoms Modern Family and Cougar Town run back to back, while Fox follows reality police\nseries Cops with crime-fighting show America\u2019s Most Wanted.\nDespite responding to challenges from cable, the broadcast networks\u2019 share of the total audience has\ndeclined each year. Between 2000 and 2009, the networks saw their numbers drop by around 8 million\nviewers. [13]\nFigure 9.16\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n413 Increased competition from cable channels has caused a steady decline in the networks\u2019 audience\nratings.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 During the 1950s, the cost of producing a single television show increased as shows became longer and\nproduction costs soared. Sponsorship on network television shifted from single sponsorship, in which a\nprogram was entirely supported and produced by one advertiser, to multiple sponsorship, in which\nadvertisers bought 1- or 2-minute spots on the show. Although no one advertiser controlled the content\nof the show, sponsors had some say in the program\u2019s subject matter. Sponsors have retained some\ncontrol over program content by withdrawing funding from shows that are deemed to have offensive or\ninappropriate content.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n414 \uf0b7 Public television was created to enhance citizenship and also to provide a television service for people in\nrural areas or those who could not afford to pay for a private television service. Despite its origins as a\nnoncommercial entity, public television has increasingly had to turn to commercial sponsorship to stay\nafloat. Government funding for public television has declined over the years, and competition from niche\ncable channels has rendered its future uncertain.\n\uf0b7 Between 1950 and 1970, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) accounted for around 95 percent of\nprime-time viewing. The addition of Fox in 1986 created the Big Four; however, attempts to create an\nadditional major network have been unsuccessful. CBS-owned UPN and Time Warner-owned WB merged\nin 2006 to create the CW. Targeted at women age 18\u201334, the CW consistently ranks a low fifth in the\nratings.\n\uf0b7 The primary challenge to network television has been the rapid growth of cable, which grew\nexponentially in the 1980s and 1990s as a result of industry deregulation and the use of satellites to\ndistribute local channels to a national audience (pioneered by HBO in the 1970s). Cable broadcasters use\na process known as narrowcasting to target niche audiences for their shows. Channels usually focus on a\nsingle topic, such as news, weather, shopping, or comedy. Competition from cable has forced network\ntelevision to loosen its restrictions regarding sex and violence on shows, and the networks have turned\nincreasingly to narrowcasting in an effort to retain audiences. Despite its efforts, competition from cable\nand other sources has caused prime-time viewing audiences of the Big Four networks to drop from 43\npercent in 1994 to 27 percent in 2009.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

Describe the difference between satellite television and cable television.\n2. Identify two of the major satellite companies in today\u2019s market.\n3. Identify ways in which the Internet has affected content delivery and viewing patterns.\nThe experience of watching television is rapidly changing with the progression of technology. No\nlonger restricted to a limited number of channels on network television, or even to a television\nschedule, viewers are now able to watch exactly what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.\nNon-television delivery systems such as the Internet, which enables viewers to download traditional\ntelevision shows onto a computer, laptop, iPod, or smartphone, are changing the way people watch\ntelevision. Meanwhile, cable and satellite providers are enabling viewers to purchase television\nshows to watch at their convenience through the use of video-on-demand services, changing the\nconcept of prime-time viewing. Digital video recording (DVR) systems such as TiVo, which enable\nusers to record particular shows onto the system\u2019s computer memory, are having a similar effect.\nAlthough television audiences are becoming increasingly fragmented, they are also growing because\nof the convenience and availability of new technology. In 2009, Nielsen\u2019s Three Screen Report, which\nencompassed television, cell phone, and computer usage, reported that the average viewer watched\nmore than 151 hours of television per month, up 3.6 percent from the previous year. [1]Viewers might\nnot all be sitting together in the family room watching prime-time shows on network television\nbetween 7 and 11 p.m., but they are watching.\nThe War Between Satellite and Cable Television\nThe origins of satellite television can be traced to the space race of the 1950s, when the United States and\nthe Soviet Union were competing to put the first satellite into space. Soviet scientists accomplished the\ngoal first with the launch of Sputnik in 1957, galvanizing Americans (who were fearful of falling behind in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n417 space technology during the Cold War era) into intensifying their efforts and resulting in the creation of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958. AT&T launched Telstar, the first\nactive communications satellite, on July 10, 1962, and the first transatlantic television signal\u2014a black-\nand-white image of a U.S. flag waving in front of the Andover Earth Station in western Maine\u2014\ntransmitted that same day. However, the television industry did not utilize satellites for broadcasting\npurposes until the late 1970s when PBS introduced Public Television Satellite Service. Satellite\ncommunication technology caught on and was used by broadcasters as a distribution method between\n1978 and 1984 by pioneering cable channels such as HBO, TBS (Turner Broadcasting System), and CBN\n(Christian Broadcasting Network, later the Family Channel).\nThe trouble with early satellite television systems was that once people purchased a satellite system, they\nhad free access to every basic and premium cable service that was broadcasting via satellite signals. The\nFCC had an \u201copen skies\u201d policy, under which users had as much right to receive signals as broadcasters\nhad the right to transmit them. Initially, the satellite receiver systems were prohibitively expensive for\nmost families, costing more than $10,000. However, as the price of a satellite dish dropped toward the\n$3,000 mark in the mid-1980s, consumers began to view satellite television as a cheaper, higher-quality\nalternative to cable. Following the initial purchase of a dish system, the actual programming\u2014consisting\nof more than 100 cable channels\u2014was free. Cable broadcasters lobbied the government for legal\nassistance and, under the 1984 Cable Act, were allowed to encrypt their satellite feeds so that only people\nwho purchased a decoder from a satellite provider could receive the channel.\nFollowing the passing of the Cable Act, the satellite industry took a dramatic hit. Sales of the\npopular direct-to-home (DTH) systems (precursors to the smaller, more powerful direct broadcast\nsatellite systems introduced in the 1990s) that had offered free cable programming slumped from 735,000\nunits in 1985 to 225,000 units a year later, and around 60 percent of satellite retailers went out of\nbusiness. The satellite industry\u2019s sudden drop in popularity was exacerbated by large-scale anti-dish\nadvertising campaigns by cable operators, depicting satellite dishes as unsightly. Although sales picked up\nin the late 1980s with the introduction of integrated receiving and decoding units and the arrival of\nprogram packages, which saved consumers the time and effort of signing up for individual programming\nservices, the growth of the satellite industry was stunted by piracy\u2014the theft of satellite signals. Of the 1.9\nmillion units manufactured between 1986 and 1990, fewer than 500,000 were receiving signals\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n418 legally. [2] The problem was ultimately solved by the actions of the Satellite Broadcasting and\nCommunications Association (SBCA), an association created in 1986 by the merger of two trade\norganizations\u2014the Society of Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE) and the Direct Broadcast\nSatellite Association (DBSA). SPACE was composed of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of direct-\nto-home systems, and DBSA represented companies interested in direct broadcast satellite systems. The\nSBCA set up an antipiracy task force, aggressively pursuing illegal hackers with the FBI\u2019s help.\nOnce the piracy problem was under control, the satellite industry could move forward. In 1994, four major\ncable companies launched a first-generation direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system called PrimeStar. The\nsystem, a small-dish satellite-delivered program service specifically intended for home reception, was the\nfirst successful attempt to enter the market in the United States. Within a year, PrimeStar was beaming 67\nchannels into 70,000 homes for a monthly fee of $25 to $35 (in addition to a hardware installation fee of\n$100 to $200). By 1996, competing companies DirecTV and the EchoStar Dish Network had entered the\nindustry, and Dish Network\u2019s cheaper prices were forcing its competitors to drop their fees. DirecTV\nacquired PrimeStar\u2019s assets in 1999 for around $1.82 billion, absorbing its rival\u2019s 2.3 million\nsubscribers. [3]\nFigure 9.17\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n419 Subscribers of DBS receive signals from geostationary satellites that are broadcast in digital\nformat at microwave frequency and intercepted by a satellite dish. A converter next to the\ntelevision produces output that can be viewed on the television receiver.\nThe Current Satellite Market: DirecTV versus Dish Network\nAs of 2010, the two biggest players in the satellite television industry are DirecTV and Dish Network.\nAssisted by the passing of the Satellite Television Home Viewers Act in 1999, which enabled satellite\nproviders to carry local television stations (putting them on equal footing with cable television), both\ncompanies have grown rapidly over the past decade. In the first quarter of 2010, DirecTV boasted 18.6\nmillion subscribers, placing it ahead of its rival, Dish Network, which reported a total of 14.3 million\nsubscribers. [4] Dish courts customers who have been hit by the economic downturn, aggressively cutting\nits prices and emphasizing its low rates. Conversely, DirecTV targets affluent consumers, emphasizing\nquality and choice in its advertising campaigns and investing in advanced services and products such as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n420 multiroom viewing (enabling a subscriber to watch a show in one room, pause it, and continue watching\nthe same show in another room) to differentiate itself from rival satellite and cable companies.\nSince the 1999 legislation put satellite television in direct competition with cable, the major satellite\ncompanies have increasingly pitted themselves against cable broadcasters, offering consumers numerous\nincentives to switch providers. One of these incentives is the addition of premium networks for satellite\nsubscribers in the same vein as premium cable channel HBO. In 2005, DirecTV expanded its 101 Network\nchannel to include original shows, becoming the first satellite station to air first episodes of a broadcast\ntelevision series with NBC daytime soap opera Passions in 2007. The station aired first-run episodes of\nfootball drama series Friday Night Lights in 2008 and set its sights on the male over-35 demographic by\nobtaining syndication rights to popular HBO series Oz and Deadwood a year later. Commenting on the\nsatellite company\u2019s programming plans, executive vice president for entertainment for DirecTV Eric\nShanks said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to become a pre-cable window for these premium channels.\u201d [5] In other words, the\ncompany hopes to purchase HBO shows such as Sex and the City before HBO sells the series to basic-\ncable channels like TBS.\nIn another overt bid to lure cable customers over to satellite television, both DirecTV and Dish Network\noffer a number of comprehensive movies and sports packages, benefiting from their additional channel\ncapacity (satellite television providers typically offer around 350 channels, compared with 180 channels\non cable) and their ability to receive international channels often unavailable on cable. In the mid-2000s,\nthe satellite companies also began encroaching on cable television\u2019s domination of bundled packages, by\noffering all-in-one phone, Internet, and television services. Despite being ideally suited to offering such\npackages with their single telecommunications pipe into the house, cable companies such as Comcast,\nCox, and Time Warner had developed a reputation for offering poor service at extortionate prices. In the\nfirst three quarters of 2004, the eight largest cable providers (with the exception of bankrupt Adelphia)\nlost 552,000 basic-cable subscribers. Between 2000 and 2004, cable\u2019s share of the television market fell\nfrom 66 percent to 62 percent, while the number of U.S. households with satellite television increased\nfrom 12 percent to 19 percent. [6] Despite reports that cash-strapped consumers are switching off pay-TV\nservices to save money during strained economic times, satellite industry revenues have risen steadily\nover the past decade.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n421 The Impact of DVRs and the Internet: Changing Content Delivery\nOver the past two decades, the viewing public has become increasingly fragmented as a result of growing\ncompetition between cable and satellite channels and traditional network television stations. Now,\ntelevision audiences are being presented with even more options. Digital video recorders (DVRs) like TiVo\nallow viewers to select and record shows they can watch at a later time. For example, viewers can set their\nDVRs to record all new (or old) episodes of the show Deadliest Catch and then watch the recorded\nepisodes whenever they have free time.\nDVRs can be used by advertisers to track which shows are being viewed. DVRs are even capable of\ntargeting viewers with specific ads when they decide to watch their recorded program. In 2008, consumer\ngroups battled with cable companies and lawmakers to protect the privacy of viewers who did not wish to\nbe tracked this way, causing Nielsen to make tracking optional.\nNon-television delivery systems such as the Internet allow viewers to download their favorite shows at any\ntime, on several different media. The Internet has typically been bad news for traditional forms of media;\nnewspapers, magazines, the music industry, video rental companies, and bookstores have all suffered\nfrom the introduction of the Internet. However, unlike other media, television has so far survived the\nInternet\u2019s effects. Television remains the dominant source of entertainment for most Americans, who are\nusing new media in conjunction with traditional television viewing, watching vast quantities of television\nin addition to streaming numerous YouTube videos and catching up on missed episodes via the networks\u2019\nweb pages. In the third quarter of 2008, the average American watched 142 hours of television per month,\nan increase of five hours per month from the same quarter the previous year. Internet use averaged 27\nhours per month, an increase of an hour and a half between 2007 and 2008. [7]\nNew Viewing Outlets: YouTube and Hulu\nOf the many recent Internet phenomenons, few have made as big an impact as video-sharing\nwebsite YouTube. Created by three PayPal engineers in 2005, the site enables users to upload personal\nvideos, television clips, music videos, and snippets of movies that can be watched by other users\nworldwide. Although it initially drew unfavorable comparisons with the original music-sharing site\nNapster (see Chapter 6 \"Music\"), which was buried under an avalanche of copyright infringement\nlawsuits, YouTube managed to survive the controversy by forming agreements with media corporations,\nsuch as NBC Universal Television, to legally broadcast video clips from shows such as The Office. In 2006,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n422 the company, which showed more than 100 million video clips per day, was purchased by Google for $1.65\nbillion. [8] Correctly predicting that the site was the \u201cnext step in the evolution of the Internet,\u201d Google\nCEO Eric Schmidt has watched YouTube\u2019s popularity explode since the takeover. As of 2010, YouTube\nshows more than 2 billion clips per day and allows people to upload 24 hours of video every single\nminute. [9] To secure its place as the go-to entertainment website, YouTube is expanding its boundaries by\ndeveloping a movie rental service and showing live music concerts and sporting events in real time. In\nJanuary 2010, Google signed a deal with the Indian Premier League, making 60 league cricket matches\navailable on YouTube\u2019s IPL channel and attracting 50 million viewers worldwide. [10]\nWhile YouTube remains focused on user-generated material, viewers looking for commercial videos of\nmovies and television shows are increasingly turning to Hulu. Established in 2007 following a deal\nbetween NBC Universal, News Corporation, and a number of leading Internet companies (including\nYahoo!, AOL, MSN, and MySpace), the site gives users access to an entire library of video clips without\ncharge and syndicates its material to partner distribution sites. The videos include full episodes of current\nhit shows such as House, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons, as well as older hits from the studios\u2019\ntelevision libraries. Supported through advertising, the venture, which is only available to viewers in the\nUnited States, became the premier video broadcast site on the web within 2 years. In July 2009, the site\nreceived more than 38 million viewers and delivered more videos than any site except\nYouTube. [11] Throughout the entire year, Hulu generated an estimated $120 million in revenue and\nincreased its advertiser base to 250 sponsors. [12] Its advertising model appeals to viewers, who need only\nto watch two minutes of promotion in 22 minutes of programming, compared with 8 minutes on\ntelevision. Limiting sponsorship to one advertiser per show has helped make recall rates twice as high as\nthose for the same advertisements on television, benefiting the sponsors as well as the viewers.\nSome critics and television executives claim that the Hulu model has been too successful for its own good,\nthreatening the financial underpinnings of cable television by reducing DVD sales and\navoiding carriage fees\u2014in 2009, Fox pulled most of the episodes of It\u2019s Always Sunny in\nPhiladelphia from Hulu\u2019s site. Per the networks\u2019 request, Hulu also shut off access to its programming\nfrom Boxee, a fledgling service that enabled viewers to stream online video to their television sets. \u201cWe\nhave to find ways to advance the business rather than cannibalize it,\u201d stated the distribution chief at TNT,\na network that refused to stream episodes of shows such as The Closer on Hulu\u2019s site. [13] However, many\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n423 television executives realize that if they do not cannibalize their own material, others will. When a viral\nvideo of Saturday Night Live short \u201cLazy Sunday\u201d hit the web in 2005, generating millions of hits on\nYouTube, NBC did not earn a dime. Broadcast networks\u2014the Big Four and the CW\u2014have also begun\nstreaming shows for free in an effort to stop viewers from watching episodes on other websites.\nHulu executives are considering introducing paid content on the site in an effort to subsidize advertising\nrevenue, a blow to consumers that would likely be softened by perks such as early access to content, ad-\nfree shows, and more comprehensive archives.\nVideo-on-Demand\nOriginally introduced in the early 1990s, the concept of video on demand (VOD)\u2014a pay-per-view system\nthat allows viewers to order or download a film via television or the Internet and watch it at their\nconvenience\u2014was not immediately successful because of the prohibitive cost of ordering a movie\ncompared to buying or renting it from a store. Another early complaint about the service was that studios\nwithheld movies until long after they were available on DVD, by which time most people who wanted to\nview the film had already seen it. Both of these disadvantages have since been remedied, with movies now\nreleased at the same time on VOD as they are on DVD at competitive rental prices. Currently, most cable\nand satellite television providers offer some form of on-demand service, either VOD, which provides\nmovies 24 hours a day and enables viewers all the functionality of a DVD player (such as the ability to\npause, rewind, or fast forward films), or NVOD (near video on demand), which broadcasts multiple copies\nof a film or program over short time intervals but does not allow viewers to control the video.\nAs an alternative to cable or satellite VOD, viewers can also readily obtain movies and television shows\nover the Internet, via free services such as YouTube and Hulu or through paid subscriptions to sites that\nstream movies to a computer. Online DVD rental service Netflix started giving subscribers instant access\nto its catalog of older television programs and films in 2007, while Internet giant Amazon.com set up a\nrival service resembling the pay-per-view model in 2008. Viewers can also stream free episodes of their\nfavorite shows via cable and broadcast networks\u2019 websites. With the increasing popularity of\nsmartphones\u2014cell phones that contain built-in applications and Internet access\u2014viewers are using VOD\nas a way of watching television while they are out of the house. Having discovered that consumers are\nwilling to watch entire television episodes or even films on their smartphones, industry executives are\nlooking for ways to capitalize on smartphone technology. In 2010, News Corporation\u2019s Fox Mobile Group\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n424 was planning to launch Bitbop, a service that will stream television episodes to smartphones for $9.99 a\nmonth. Discussing the project, Bitbop architect Joe Bilman said that \u201cthe marriage of on-demand content\nand mobility has the power to light a fire in the smartphone space.\u201d [14]The shift from traditional television\nviewing to online viewing is making a small but noticeable dent in the $84 billion cable and satellite\nindustry. Between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2009, an estimated 800,000 U.S. households cut\nthe cable cord in favor of web viewing. [15]\nInteractive Television\nMoving a step beyond VOD, cable and satellite television providers are combining aspects of traditional\ntelevision viewing with online content to create an entirely new way of watching shows\u2014\ninteractive television (iTV). Using an additional set-top box and their remote control, viewers can utilize\nseveral different features that go beyond simply watching a television show. For example, interactive\ntelevision enables users to take part in quiz shows, vote for a favorite contestant on a game show, view\nhighlights or look up statistics during sports matches, create a music playlist or photo slideshow, and view\nlocal information such as weather and traffic through a ticker under a current television program.\nSoftware such as Microsoft\u2019s UltimateTV, released in 2001, even brought interactivity to individual\ntelevision shows. For example, a viewer watching CBS crime series CSI can click on the interactive icon in\nthe corner of the screen and obtain instant information about forensic analysis techniques, along with an\nepisode guide, character biographies, and a map of the show\u2019s Las Vegas setting.\nInteractive television is beginning to take on the social format of the web, linking viewers with online\ncommunities who use communication tools such as Twitter and Skype IM to discuss what they just saw on\ntelevision in real time. When popular musical comedy show Glee hit the screens in 2009, marketing\nexperts at Fox pushed for a strong online presence, airing the pilot episode well in advance of the actual\nseason debut and generating buzz on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Once the show\ngained widespread popularity, Fox launched an interactive hypertrailer on its website, allowing viewers to\nclick on and \u201clike\u201d the show\u2019s cast members on Facebook. The Glee cast also participates in weekly \u201ctweet-\npeats,\u201d which feature live Twitter feeds that scroll across the bottom of the screen during reruns of the\nshow, providing behind-the-scenes details and answering fan questions. The CW network uses a similar\ntechnique with its \u201cTV to Talk About\u201d campaign, a tagline that changes from ad to ad to include iterations\nsuch as \u201cTV to text about,\u201d \u201cblog about,\u201d or \u201ctweet about.\u201d Its website offers forums where viewers can\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n425 discuss episodes and interact with video extras, photos, and background clips about various shows. Online\ntelevision forum Television Without Pity provides viewers with an alternative place for discussion that is\nnot affiliated with any one network.\nFigure 9.19\nA Nielsen report found that during the fourth quarter of 2009, 60 percent of Americans spent up to\n3.5 hours every month going online and watching television simultaneously.\nDespite the shift toward interactive television, one barrier that manufacturers seem to be unwilling to\ncross is the addition of Internet to people\u2019s television sets. Although Internet-enabled televisions began\ntrickling into the market in 2008 and 2009, many industry executives remained skeptical of their\npotential. In February 2009, Sony spokesman Greg Belloni said, \u201cSony\u2019s stance is that consumers don\u2019t\nwant an Internet-like experience with their TVs, and we\u2019re really not focused on bringing anything other\nthan Internet video or widgets to our sets right now.\u201d [16] Although some analysts predict that up to 20\npercent of televisions will be Internet-enabled by 2012, consulting firm Deloitte anticipates the continued\nconcurrent use of television sets with laptops, MP3 players, and other browser-enabled devices. [17]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The first satellite television signal was broadcast in 1962; however, the television industry did not begin\nutilizing satellites for broadcasting purposes until the late 1970s. Early problems with satellite television\nincluded the high cost of a satellite dish and the theft of satellite signals following the passing of the Cable\nAct in 1984. Once piracy was under control, satellite television companies began to emerge and become\nprofitable. The two biggest current satellite television providers are DirecTV, which targets its services\ntoward affluent consumers, and Dish Network, which targets lower-earning consumers. Since the 1999\nlegislation enabled satellite companies to broadcast local channels, satellite television has become a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n426 viable threat to cable. Satellite companies attempt to lure cable customers by offering premium channels,\nsports and movie packages, and competitive prices.\n\uf0b7 Unlike some other forms of media, television is so far surviving the impact of the Internet. However, the\nWorld Wide Web is changing content delivery methods and the way people conceive television and\nprogram scheduling. New viewing outlets such as YouTube and Hulu enable viewers to watch online video\nclips, entire episodes of television shows, and movies free of charge (although Hulu may soon offer paid\ncontent to offset the losses in network advertising revenue). Video-on-demand services, now available\nthrough most cable and satellite providers, allow viewers to order movies or television programs at their\nconvenience, rather than having to adhere to a fixed programming schedule. VOD is also available\nthrough Internet sites such as Amazon.com and Netflix, allowing people to stream shows and video clips\nto their smartphones and watch television while on the go. Thanks to the influence of the Internet,\ntelevision is becoming more interactive, with providers combining aspects of traditional viewing and\nonline content. This is manifested in two ways: new features that provide viewers with hundreds of\nadditional options while they watch their favorite shows (for example, the ability to look up a news story\nor get a weather update), and social television, which encourages viewers to combine television viewing\nwith social networking (for example, by blogging or joining an online chat forum about the show).\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

This is illustrated by a 2007 Southwest Airlines commercial in which two friends\nare playing a baseball video game on a Nintendo Wii\u2013like console. The batting friend tells the other to\nthrow his pitch\u2014and he does, excitedly firing his controller into the middle of the plasma television, which\nthen falls off the wall. Both friends stare in shock at the shattered flat screen as the narrator asks, \u201cWant\nto get away?\u201d\nSuch a scene is unlikely to have taken place in the early days of video games when Atari reigned supreme\nand the action of playing solely centered on hand-eye coordination. The learning curve was relatively\nnonexistent; players maneuvered a joystick to shoot lines of aliens in the sky, or they turned the wheel on\na paddle to play a virtual game of table tennis.\nBut as video games became increasingly popular, they also became increasingly complex. Consoles\nupgraded and evolved on a regular basis, and the games kept up. Players called each other with loopholes\nand tips on how to get Mario and Luigi onto the next level, and now they exchange their tricks on gaming\nblogs. Games like The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy created alternate worlds and intricate story\nlines, providing multiple-hour epic adventures.\nLong criticized for taking kids out of the backyard and into a sedentary spot in front of the television,\nmany video games have circled back to their simpler origins and, in doing so, have made players more\nactive. Casual gamers who could quickly figure out how to put together puzzle pieces in Tetris can now\njust as easily figure out how to \u201cswing\u201d a tennis racket with a Wiimote. Video games are no longer a\nconvenient scapegoat for America\u2019s obesity problems; Wii Fit offers everything from yoga to boxing,\nand Dance Dance Revolution estimates calories burned while players dance.\nThe logistics of video games continue to change, and as they do, gaming has begun to intersect with every\nother part of culture. Players can learn how to \u201cperform\u201d their favorite songs with Guitar Hero and Rock\nBand. Product placement akin to what is seen in movies and on television is equally prevalent in video\ngames such as the popular Forza Motorsport or FIFA series. As the Internet allows for players across the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n431 world to participate simultaneously, video games have the potential to one day look like competitive\nreality shows. [1]Arguably, video games even hold a place in the art world, with the increasing complexity\nof animation and story lines. [2]\nAnd now, with endless possibilities for the future, video games are attracting new and different\ndemographics. Avid players who grew up with video games may be the first ones to purchase 3-D\ntelevisions for the 3-D games of the future.[3] But casual players, perhaps of an older demographic, will be\ndrawn to the simplicity of a game like Wii Bowling. Video games have become more accessible than ever.\nSocial media websites like Facebook offer free video game applications, and smartphone users can\ndownload apps for as little as a dollar, literally putting video games in one\u2019s back pocket. Who needs a\ncumbersome Scrabble board when it\u2019s available on a touch screen anytime, anywhere?\nVideo games have become ubiquitous in modern culture. Understanding them as a medium allows a fuller\nunderstanding of their implications in the realms of entertainment, information, and communication.\nStudying their history reveals new perspectives on the ways video games have affected mainstream\nculture.\n[1] Michael Dolan, \u201cThe Video Game Revolution: The Future of Video Gaming,\u201d PBS,\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/future.html.\n[2] Jona Tres Kap, \u201cThe Video Game Revolution: But is it Art?\u201d PBS,\nhttp://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/art.html.\n[3] M.

Identify the major companies involved in video game production.\n2. Explain the important innovations that drove the acceptance of video games by mainstream culture.\n3. Determine major technological developments that influenced the evolution of video games.\nPong, the electronic table-tennis simulation game, was the first video game for many people who\ngrew up in the 1970s and is now a famous symbol of early video games. However, the precursors to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n432 modern video games were created as early as the 1950s. In 1952 a computer simulation of tic-tac-toe\nwas developed for EDSAC, one of the first stored-information computers, and in 1958 a game\ncalled Tennis for Two was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a way to entertain people\ncoming through the laboratory on tours. [1]\nFigure 10.2\nTennis for Two was a rudimentary game designed to entertain visitors to the Brookhaven National Laboratory.\nThese games would generate little interest among the modern game-playing public, but at the time\nthey enthralled their users and introduced the basic elements of the cultural video game experience.\nIn a time before personal computers, these games allowed the general public to access technology\nthat had been restricted to the realm of abstract science. Tennis for Two created an interface where\nanyone with basic motor skills could use a complex machine. The first video games functioned early\non as a form of media by essentially disseminating the experience of computer technology to those\nwho did not have access to it.\nAs video games evolved, their role as a form of media grew as well. Video games have grown from\nsimple tools that made computing technology understandable to forms of media that can\ncommunicate cultural values and human relationships.\nThe 1970s: The Rise of the Video Game\nThe 1970s saw the rise of video games as a cultural phenomenon. A 1972 article in Rolling Stone describes\nthe early days of computer gaming:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n433 Reliably, at any nighttime moment (i.e. non-business hours) in North America hundreds of\ncomputer technicians are effectively out of their bodies, locked in life-or-death space combat\ncomputer-projected onto cathode ray tube display screens, for hours at a time, ruining their eyes,\nnumbing their fingers in frenzied mashing of control buttons, joyously slaying their friend and\nwasting their employers\u2019 valuable computer time. Something basic is going on. [2]\nThis scene was describing Spacewar!, a game developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) that spread to other college campuses and computing centers. In the early 1970s, very\nfew people owned computers. Most computer users worked or studied at university, business, or\ngovernment facilities. Those with access to computers were quick to utilize them for gaming purposes.\nArcade Games\nThe first coin-operated arcade game was modeled on Spacewar! It was called Computer Space, and it\nfared poorly among the general public because of its difficult controls. In 1972, Pong, the table-tennis\nsimulator that has come to symbolize early computer games, was created by the fledgling company Atari,\nand it was immediately successful. Pong was initially placed in bars with pinball machines and other\ngames of chance, but as video games grew in popularity, they were placed in any establishment that would\ntake them. By the end of the 1970s, so many video arcades were being built that some towns passed\nzoning laws limiting them. [3]\nThe end of the 1970s ushered in a new era\u2014what some call the golden age of video games\u2014with the\ngame Space Invaders, an international phenomenon that exceeded all expectations. In Japan, the game\nwas so popular that it caused a national coin shortage. Games like Space Invaders illustrate both the\neffect of arcade games and their influence on international culture. In two different countries on opposite\nsides of the globe, Japanese and American teenagers, although they could not speak to one another, were\nhaving the same experiences thanks to a video game.\nVideo Game Consoles\nThe first video game console for the home began selling in 1972. It was the Magnavox Odyssey, and it was\nbased on prototypes built by Ralph Behr in the late 1960s. This system included a Pong-type game, and\nwhen the arcade version of Pong became popular, the Odyssey began to sell well. Atari, which was making\narcade games at the time, decided to produce a home version of Pong and released it in 1974. Although\nthis system could only play one game, its graphics and controls were superior to the Odyssey, and it was\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n434 sold through a major department store, Sears. Because of these advantages, the Atari home version\nof Pong sold well, and a host of other companies began producing and selling their own versions\nof Pong. [4]\nA major step forward in the evolution of video games was the development of game cartridges that stored\nthe games and could be interchanged in the console. With this technology, users were no longer limited to\na set number of games, leading many video game console makers to switch their emphasis to producing\ngames. Several groups, such as Magnavox, Coleco, and Fairchild, released versions of cartridge-type\nconsoles, but Atari\u2019s 2600 console had the upper hand because of the company\u2019s work on arcade games.\nAtari capitalized off of its arcade successes by releasing games that were well known to a public that was\nfrequenting arcades. The popularity of games such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man made the Atari 2600\na successful system. The late 1970s also saw the birth of companies such as Activision, which developed\nthird-party games for the Atari 2600. [5]\nHome Computers\nThe birth of the home computer market in the 1970s paralleled the emergence of video game consoles.\nThe first computer designed and sold for the home consumer was the Altair. It was first sold in 1975,\nseveral years after video game consoles had been selling, and it sold mainly to a hobbyist market. During\nthis period, people such as Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, were building computers by hand and selling\nthem to get their start-up businesses going. In 1977, three important computers\u2014Radio Shack\u2019s TRS-80,\nthe Commodore PET, and the Apple II\u2014were produced and began selling to the home market. [6]\nThe rise of personal computers allowed for the development of more complex games. Designers of games\nsuch as Mystery House, developed in 1979 for the Apple II, and Rogue, developed in 1980 and played on\nIBM PCs, used the processing power of early home computers to develop video games that had extended\nplots and story lines. In these games, players moved through landscapes composed of basic graphics,\nsolving problems and working through an involved narrative. The development of video games for the\npersonal computer platform expanded the ability of video games to act as media by allowing complex\nstories to be told and new forms of interaction to take place between players.\nThe 1980s: The Crash\nAtari\u2019s success in the home console market was due in large part to its ownership of already-popular\narcade games and the large number of game cartridges available for the system. These strengths, however,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n435 eventually proved detrimental to the company and led to what is now known as the\nvideo game crash of 1983. Atari bet heavily on its past successes with popular arcade games by\nreleasing Pac-Man for the Atari 2600. Pac-Man was a successful arcade game that did not translate well\nto the home console, leading to disappointed consumers and lower-than-expected sales. Additionally,\nAtari produced 10 million of the lackluster Pac-Man games on its first run, despite the fact that active\nconsoles were only estimated at 10 million. Similar mistakes were made with a game based on the\nmovie E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, which has gained notoriety as one of the worst games in Atari\u2019s\nhistory. It was not received well by consumers despite the success of the movie, and Atari had again bet\nheavily on its success. Piles of unsold E.T. game cartridges were reportedly buried in the New Mexico\ndesert under a veil of secrecy. [7]\nAs retail outlets became increasingly wary of home console failures, they began stocking fewer games on\nshelves. This action, combined with an increasing number of companies producing games, led to\noverproduction and a resulting fallout in the video game market in 1983. Many smaller game developers\ndid not have the capacity to withstand this downturn and went out of business. Although Coleco and Atari\nwere able to make it through the crash, neither company regained its former share of the video game\nmarket. It was 1985 when the video game market picked up again. [8]\nThe Rise of Nintendo\nNintendo, a Japanese card and novelty producer that had begun to produce electronic games in the 1970s,\nwas responsible for arcade games such as Donkey Kong in the early 1980s. Its first home console,\ndeveloped in 1984 for sale in Japan, tried to succeed where Atari had failed. The Nintendo system used\nnewer, better microchips, bought in large quantities, to ensure high-quality graphics at a price consumers\ncould afford. Keeping console prices low meant Nintendo had to rely on games for most of its profits and\nmaintain control of game production. This was something Atari had failed to do, and it led to a glut of\nlow-priced games that caused the crash of 1983. Nintendo got around this problem with proprietary\ncircuits that would not allow unlicensed games to be played on the console. This allowed Nintendo to\ndominate the home video game market through the end of the decade, when one-third of homes in the\nUnited States had a Nintendo system. [9]\nNintendo introduced its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the United States in 1985. The\ngame Super Mario Brothers, released with the system, was also a landmark in video game development.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n436 The game employed a narrative in the same manner as more complicated computer games, but its\ncontrols were accessible and its objectives simple. The game appealed to a younger demographic,\ngenerally boys in the 8\u201314 range, than the one targeted by Atari.[10] Its designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, tried\nto mimic the experiences of childhood adventures, creating a fantasy world not based on previous models\nof science fiction or other literary genres. [11] Super Mario Brothers also gave Nintendo an iconic character\nwho has been used in numerous other games, television shows, and even a movie. The development of\nthis type of character and fantasy world became the norm for video game makers. Games such as The\nLegend of Zelda became franchises with film and television possibilities rather than simply one-off games.\nAs video games developed as a form of media, the public struggled to come to grips with the kind of\nmessages this medium was passing on to children. These were no longer simple games of reflex that could\nbe compared to similar non-video games or sports; these were forms of media that included stories and\nmessages that concerned parents and children\u2019s advocates. Arguments about the larger meaning of the\ngames became common, with some seeing the games as driven by ideas of conquest and gender\nstereotypes, whereas others saw basic stories about traveling and exploration. [12]\nOther Home Console Systems\nOther software companies were still interested in the home console market in the mid-1980s. Atari\nreleased the 2600jr and the 7800 in 1986 after Nintendo\u2019s success, but the consoles could not compete\nwith Nintendo. The Sega Corporation, which had been involved with arcade video game production,\nreleased its Sega Master System in 1986. Although the system had more graphics possibilities than the\nNES, Sega failed to make a dent in Nintendo\u2019s market share until the early 1990s, with the release of Sega\nGenesis. [13]\nComputer Games Flourish and Innovate\nThe enormous number of games available for Atari consoles in the early 1980s took its toll on video\narcades. In 1983, arcade revenues had fallen to a 3-year low, leading game makers to turn to newer\ntechnologies that could not be replicated by home consoles. This included arcade games powered by laser\ndiscs, such as Dragon\u2019s Lair and Space Ace, but their novelty soon wore off, and laser-disc games became\nmuseum pieces. [14] In 1989, museums were already putting on exhibitions of early arcade games that\nincluded ones from the early 1980s. Although newer games continued to come out on arcade platforms,\nthey could not compete with the home console market and never achieved their previous successes from\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n437 the early 1980s. Increasingly, arcade gamers chose to stay at home to play games on computers and\nconsoles. Today, dedicated arcades are a dying breed. Most that remain, like the Dave & Buster\u2019s and\nChuck E. Cheese\u2019s chains, offer full-service restaurants and other entertainment attractions to draw in\nbusiness.\nHome games fared better than arcades because they could ride the wave of personal computer purchases\nthat occurred in the 1980s. Some important developments in video games occurred in the mid-1980s with\nthe development of online games. Multiuser dungeons, or MUDs, were role-playing games played online\nby multiple users at once. The games were generally text-based, describing the world of the MUD through\ntext rather than illustrating it through graphics. The games allowed users to create a character and move\nthrough different worlds, accomplishing goals that awarded them with new skills. If characters attained a\ncertain level of proficiency, they could then design their own area of the world. Habitat, a game developed\nin 1986 for the Commodore 64, was a graphic version of this type of game. Users dialed up on modems to\na central host server and then controlled characters on screen, interacting with other users. [15]\nDuring the mid-1980s, a demographic shift occurred. Between 1985 and 1987, games designed to run on\nbusiness computers rose from 15 percent to 40 percent of games sold. [16] This trend meant that game\nmakers could use the increased processing power of business computers to create more complex games. It\nalso meant adults were interested in computer games and could become a profitable market.\nThe 1990s: The Rapid Evolution of Video Games\nVideo games evolved at a rapid rate throughout the 1990s, moving from the first 16-bit systems (named\nfor the amount of data they could process and store) in the early \u201990s to the first Internet-enabled home\nconsole in 1999. As companies focused on new marketing strategies, wider audiences were targeted, and\nvideo games\u2019 influence on culture began to be felt.\nConsole Wars\nNintendo\u2019s dominance of the home console market throughout the late 1980s allowed it to build a large\nlibrary of games for use on the NES. This also proved to be a weakness, however, because Nintendo was\nreluctant to improve or change its system for fear of making its game library obsolete. Technology had\nchanged in the years since the introduction of the NES, and companies such as NEC and Sega were ready\nto challenge Nintendo with 16-bit systems. [17]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n438 The Sega Master System had failed to challenge the NES, but with the release of its 16-bit system, Sega\nGenesis, the company pursued a new marketing strategy. Whereas Nintendo targeted 8- to 14-year-olds,\nSega\u2019s marketing plan targeted 15- to 17-year olds, making games that were more mature and advertising\nduring programs such as the MTV Video Music Awards. The campaign successfully branded Sega as a\ncooler version of Nintendo and moved mainstream video games into a more mature arena. Nintendo\nresponded to the Sega Genesis with its own 16-bit system, the Super NES, and began creating more\nmature games as well. Games such as Sega\u2019s Mortal Kombat and Nintendo\u2019s Street Fighter competed to\nraise the level of violence possible in a video game. Sega\u2019s advertisements even suggested that its game\nwas better because of its more violent possibilities. [18]\nBy 1994, companies such as 3DO, with its 32-bit system, and Atari, with its allegedly 64-bit Jaguar,\nattempted to get in on the home console market but failed to use effective marketing strategies to back up\ntheir products. Both systems fell out of production before the end of the decade. Sega, fearing that its\nsystem would become obsolete, released the 32-bit Saturn system in 1995. The system was rushed into\nproduction and did not have enough games available to ensure its success. [19] Sony stepped in with its\nPlayStation console at a time when Sega\u2019s Saturn was floundering and before Nintendo\u2019s 64-bit system\nhad been released. This system targeted an even older demographic of 14- to 24-year-olds and made a\nlarge effect on the market; by March of 2007, Sony had sold 102 million PlayStations. [20]\nComputer Games Gain Mainstream Acceptance\nComputer games had avid players, but they were still a niche market in the early 1990s. An important step\nin the mainstream acceptance of personal computer games was the development of the first-\nperson shooter genre. First popularized by the 1992 game Wolfenstein 3D, these games put the player in\nthe character\u2019s perspective, making it seem as if the player were firing weapons and being attacked. Doom,\nreleased in 1993, and Quake, released in 1996, used the increased processing power of personal\ncomputers to create vivid three-dimensional worlds that were impossible to fully replicate on video game\nconsoles of the era. These games pushed realism to new heights and began attracting public attention for\ntheir graphic violence.\nAnother trend was reaching out to audiences outside of the video-game-playing community. Myst, an\nadventure game where the player walked around an island solving a mystery, drove sales of CD-ROM\ndrives for computers. Myst, its sequel Riven, and other nonviolent games such as SimCity actually\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n439 outsold Doom and Quake in the 1990s. [21] These nonviolent games appealed to people who did not\ngenerally play video games, increasing the form\u2019s audience and expanding the types of information that\nvideo games put across.\nOnline Gaming Gains Popularity\nA major advance in game technology came with the increase in Internet use by the general public in the\n1990s. A major feature of Doom was the ability to use multiplayer gaming through the Internet. Strategy\ngames such as Command and Conquer and Total Annihilation also included options where players could\nplay each other over the Internet. Other fantasy-inspired role-playing games, such as Ultima Online, used\nthe Internet to initiate the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) genre. [22] These\ngames used the Internet as their platform, much like the text-based MUDs, creating a space where\nindividuals could play the game while socially interacting with one another.\nPortable Game Systems\nThe development of portable game systems was another important aspect of video games during the\n1990s. Handheld games had been in use since the 1970s, and a system with interchangeable cartridges\nhad even been sold in the early 1980s. Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989, using the same principles\nthat made the NES dominate the handheld market throughout the 1990s. The Game Boy was released\nwith the game Tetris, using the game\u2019s popularity to drive purchases of the unit. The unit\u2019s simple design\nmeant users could get 20 hours of playing time on a set of batteries, and this basic design was left\nessentially unaltered for most of the decade. More advanced handheld systems, such as the Atari Lynx and\nSega Game Gear, could not compete with the Game Boy despite their superior graphics and color\ndisplays. [23]\nThe decade-long success of the Game Boy belies the conventional wisdom of the console wars that more\nadvanced technology makes for a more popular system. The Game Boy\u2019s static, simple design was readily\naccessible, and its stability allowed for a large library of games to be developed for it. Despite using\ntechnology almost a decade old, the Game Boy accounted for 30 percent of Nintendo of America\u2019s overall\nrevenues at the end of the 1990s. [24]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n440 The Early 2000s: 21st-Century Games\nThe Console Wars Continue\n1999 saw Sega\u2019s last effort in the console wars with its Sega Dreamcast. This console could connect to the\nInternet, emulating the sophisticated computer games of the 1990s. The new features of the Sega\nDreamcast were not enough to save the brand, however, and Sega discontinued production in 2001,\nleaving the console market entirely. [25]\nA major problem for Sega\u2019s Dreamcast was Sony\u2019s release of the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000. The PS2\ncould function as a DVD player, expanding the role of the console into an entertainment device that did\nmore than play video games. This console was incredibly successful, enjoying a long production run, with\nmore than 106 million units sold worldwide by the end of the decade. [26]\nIn 2001, two major consoles were released to compete with the PS2: the Xbox and the Nintendo\nGameCube. The Xbox was an attempt by Microsoft to enter the market with a console that expanded on\nthe functions of other game consoles. The unit had features similar to a PC, including a hard drive and an\nethernet port for online play through its service, Xbox Live. The popularity of the first-person shooter\ngame Halo, an Xbox exclusive release, boosted sales as well. Nintendo\u2019s GameCube did not offer DVD\nplayback capabilities, choosing instead to focus on gaming functions. Both of these consoles sold millions\nof units but did not come close to the sales of the PS2.\nComputer Gaming Becomes a Niche Market\nAs consoles developed to rival the capabilities of personal computers, game developers began to focus\nmore on games for consoles. From 2000 to the end of the decade, the popularity of personal computer\ngames has gradually declined. The computer gaming community, while still significant, is focused on\ngame players who are willing to pay a lot of money on personal computers that are designed specifically\nfor gaming, often including multiple monitors and user modifications that allow personal computers to\nplay newer games. This type of market, though profitable, is not large enough to compete with the\naudience for the much cheaper game consoles. [27]\nThe Evolution of Portable Gaming\nNintendo continued its control of the handheld game market into the 2000s with the 2001 release of the\nGame Boy Advance, a redesigned Game Boy that offered 32-bit processing and compatibility with older\nGame Boy games. In 2004, anticipating Sony\u2019s upcoming handheld console, Nintendo released the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n441 Nintendo DS, a handheld console that featured two screens and Wi-Fi capabilities for online gaming.\nSony\u2019s PlayStation Portable (PSP) was released the following year and featured Wi-Fi capabilities as well\nas a flexible platform that could be used to play other media such as MP3s. [28] These two consoles, along\nwith their newer versions, continue to dominate the handheld market.\nOne interesting innovation in mobile gaming occurred in 2003 with the release of the Nokia N-Gage. The\nN-Gage was a combination of a game console and mobile phone that, according to consumers, did not fill\neither role very well. The product line was discontinued in 2005, but the idea of playing games on phones\npersisted and has been developed on other platforms. [29] Apple currently dominates the industry of\nmobile phone games; in 2008 and 2009 alone, iPhone games generated $615 million in revenue. [30] As\nmobile phone gaming grows in popularity and as the supporting technology becomes increasingly more\nadvanced, traditional portable gaming platforms like the DS and the PSP will need to evolve to compete.\nNintendo is already planning a successor to the DS that features 3-D graphics without the use of 3-D\nglasses that it hopes will help the company retain and grow its share of the portable gaming market.\nVideo Games Today\nThe trends of the late 2000s have shown a steadily increasing market for video games. Newer control\nsystems and family-oriented games have made it common for many families to engage in video game play\nas a group. Online games have continued to develop, gaining unprecedented numbers of players. The\noverall effect of these innovations has been the increasing acceptance of video game culture by the\nmainstream.\nHome Consoles\nThe current state of the home console market still involves the three major companies of the past 10\nyears: Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft. The release of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 led this generation of consoles\nin 2005. The Xbox 360 featured expanded media capabilities and integrated access to Xbox Live, an\nonline gaming service. Sony\u2019s PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006. It also featured enhanced online\naccess as well as expanded multimedia functions, with the additional capacity to play Blu-ray discs.\nNintendo released the Wii at the same time. This console featured a motion-sensitive controller that\ndeparted from previous controllers and focused on accessible, often family-oriented games. This\ncombination successfully brought in large numbers of new game players, including many older adults. By\nJune 2010, in the United States, the Wii had sold 71.9 million units, the Xbox 360 had sold 40.3 million,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n442 and the PS3 trailed at 35.4 million. [31] In the wake of the Wii\u2019s success, Microsoft and Sony have\nintroduced their own motion-sensitive systems. [32]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 In a time before personal computers, early video games allowed the general public to access technology\nthat had been restricted to the realm of abstract science. Tennis for Two created an interface where\nanyone with basic motor skills could use a complex machine. The first video games functioned early on as\na form of media by essentially disseminating the experience of computer technology to those without\naccess to it.\n\uf0b7 Video games reached wider audiences in the 1990s with the advent of the first-person shooter genre and\npopular non-action games such as Myst. The games were marketed to older audiences, and their success\nincreased demand for similar games.\n\uf0b7 Online capabilities that developed in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s allowed players to compete in\nteams. This innovation attracted larger audiences to gaming and led to new means of social\ncommunication.\n\uf0b7 A new generation of accessible, family-oriented games in the late 2000s encouraged families to interact\nthrough video games. These games also brought in older demographics that had never used video games\nbefore.\nEXERCISES\nVideo game marketing has changed to bring in more and more people to the video game audience. Think\nabout the influence video games have had on you or people you know. If you have never played video\ngames, then think about the ways your conceptions of video games have changed. Sketch out a timeline\nindicating the different occurrences that marked your experiences related to video games. Now compare\nthis timeline to the history of video games from this section. Consider the following questions:\n1. How did your own experiences line up with the history of video games?\n2. Did you feel the effects of marketing campaigns directed at you or those around you?\n3. Were you introduced to video games during a surge in popularity? What games appealed to you?\n[1] Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen, Understanding Video Games: The Essential Introduction (New York: Taylor & Francis,\n2008), 50.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n443 [2] Stewart Brand, \u201cSpace War,\u201d Rolling Stone, December 7, 1972.\n[3] Steven Kent, \u201cSuper Mario Nation,\u201d American Heritage, September 1997,\nhttp://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1997/5/1997_5_65.shtml.\n[4] Leonard Herman, \u201cEarly Home Video Game Systems,\u201d in The Video Game Explosion: From Pong to PlayStation\nand Beyond, ed.

Identify the effect electronic games have on culture.\n2. Select the most influential and important games released to the general public within the last few years.\n3. Describe ways new games have changed the video game as a form of media.\nWith such a short history, the place of video games in culture is constantly changing and being\nredefined. Are video games entertainment or art? Should they focus on fostering real-life skills or\ndeveloping virtual realities? Certain games have come to prominence in recent years for their\ninnovations and genre-expanding attributes. These games are notable for not only great economic\nsuccess and popularity but also for having a visible influence on culture.\nGuitar Hero and Rock Band\nThe musical series Guitar Hero, based on a Japanese arcade game of the late 1990s, was first launched in\nNorth America in 2005. In the game, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to match the rhythms and\nnotes of famous rock songs. The closer the player approximates the song, the better the score. This game\nintroduced a new genre of games in which players simulate playing musical instruments. Rock Band,\nreleased in 2007, uses a similar format, including a microphone for singing, a drum set, and rhythm and\nbass guitars. These games are based on a similar premise as earlier rhythm-based games such as Dance\nDance Revolution, in which players keep the rhythm on a dance pad. Dance Dance Revolution, which was\nintroduced to North American audiences in 1999, was successful but not to the extent that the later band-\noriented games were. In 2008, music-based games brought in an estimated $1.9 billion.\nFigure 10.5\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n446 Rock Band includes a microphone and a drum set along with a guitar.\nGuitar Hero and Rock Band brought new means of marketing and a kind of cross-media stimulus with\nthem. The songs featured in the games experienced increased downloads and sales\u2014as much as an 840\npercent increase in some cases. [1] The potential of this type of game did not escape its developers or the\nmusic industry. Games dedicated solely to one band were developed, such as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith and\nThe Beatles: Rock Band. These games were a mix of music documentary, greatest hits album, and game.\nThey included footage from early concerts, interviews with band members, and, of course, songs that\nallowed users to play along. When Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was released, the band\u2019s catalog experienced a\n40 percent increase in sales. [2]\nThe rock band Metallica made its album Death Magnetic available for Guitar Hero III on the same day it\nwas released as an album. [3] Other innovations include Rock Band Network, a means for bands and\nindividuals to create versions of their own songs for Rock Band that can be downloaded for a fee. The\nsporadic history of the video game industry makes it unclear if this type of game will maintain market\nshare or even maintain its popularity, but it has clearly opened new avenues of expression as a form of\nmedia.\nThe Grand Theft Auto series\nThe first game in the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series was released in 1997 for the PC and Sony\nPlayStation. The game had players stealing cars\u2014not surprising given its title\u2014and committing a variety\nof crimes to achieve specific goals. The game\u2019s extreme violence made it popular with players of the late\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n447 1990s, but its true draw was the variety of options that players could employ in the game. Specific\nnarratives and goals could be pursued, but if players wanted to drive around and explore the city, they\ncould do that as well. A large variety of cars, from sports cars to tractor trailers, were available depending\non the player\u2019s goals. The violence could likewise be taken to any extreme the player wished, including\nstealing cars, killing pedestrians, and engaging the police in a shoot-out. This type of game is known as\na sandbox game, or open world, and it is defined by the ability of users to freely pursue their own\nobjectives. [4]\nThe GTA series has evolved over the past decade by increasing the realism, options, and explicit content of\nthe first game. GTA III and GTA IV, as well as a number of spin-off games, such as the recent addition The\nBallad of Gay Tony, have made the franchise more profitable and more controversial. These newer games\nhave expanded on the idea of an open video game world, allowing players to have their characters buy and\nmanage businesses, play unrelated mini-games (such as bowling and darts), and listen to a wide variety of\nin-game music, talk shows, and even television programs. However, increasing freedom also results in\nincreasing controversy, as players can choose to solicit prostitutes, visit strip clubs, perform murder\nsprees, and assault law enforcement agents. Lawsuits have attempted to tie the games to real-life\ninstances of violence, and GTA games are routinely the target of political investigations into video game\nviolence. [5]\nWorld of Warcraft\nWorld of Warcraft (WoW), released in 2004, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\n(MMORPG) loosely based on the Warcraft strategy franchise of the 1990s. The game is conducted\nentirely online, though it is accessed through purchased software, and players purchase playing time.\nEach player chooses an avatar, or character, that belongs to one of several races, such as orcs, elves, and\nhumans. These characters can spend their time on the game by completing quests, learning trades, or\nsimply interacting with other characters. As characters gain experience, they obtain skills and earn virtual\nmoney. Players also choose whether they can attack other players without prior agreement by choosing a\nPvP (player versus player) server. The normal server allows players to fight each other, but it can only be\ndone if both players consent. A third server is reserved for those players who want to role-play, or act in\ncharacter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n448 Various organizations have sprung up within the WoW universe. Guilds are groups that ascribe to specific\ncodes of conduct and work together to complete tasks that cannot be accomplished by a lone individual.\nThe guilds are organized by the players; they are not maintained by WoW developers. Each has its own\nunique identity and social rules, much like a college fraternity or social club. Voice communication\ntechnology allows players to speak to each other as they complete missions and increases the social\nbonding that holds such organizations together. [6]\nWoW has taken the medium of video games to unprecedented levels. Although series such as Grand Theft\nAuto allow players a great deal of freedom, everything done in the games was accounted for at some\npoint. WoW, which depends on the actions of millions of players to drive the game, allows people to\nliterally live their lives through a game. In the game, players can earn virtual gold by mining it, killing\nenemies, and killing other players. It takes a great deal of time to accumulate gold in this manner, so\nmany wealthy players choose to buy this gold with actual dollars. This is technically against the rules of\nthe game, but these rules are unenforceable. Entire real-world industries have developed from this trade\nin gold. Chinese companies employ workers, or \u201cgold farmers,\u201d who work 10-hour shifts finding gold\nin WoW so that the company can sell it to clients. Other players make money by finding deals on virtual\ngoods and then selling them for a profit. One WoW player even \u201ctraveled\u201d to Asian servers to take\nadvantage of cheap prices, conducting a virtual import\u2013export business. [7]\nThe unlimited possibilities in such a game expand the idea of what a game is. It is obvious that an\nindividual who buys a video game, takes it home, and plays it during his or her leisure is, in fact, playing a\ngame. But if that person is a \u201cgold farmer\u201d doing repetitious tasks in a virtual world to make a real-world\nliving, the situation is not as clear. WoW challenges conventional notions of what a game is by allowing\nthe players to create their own goals. To some players, the goal may be to gain a high level for their\ncharacter; others may be interested in role-playing, whereas others are focused on making a profit. This\nkind of flexibility leads to the development of scenarios never before encountered in game-play, such as\nthe development of economic classes.\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare\nThe Call of Duty series of first-person shooter games is notable for its record-breaking success in the\nvideo game market, generating more than $3 billion in retail sales through late 2009. [8] Call of Duty:\nModern Warfare 2 was released in 2009 to critical acclaim and a great deal of controversy. The game\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n449 included a 5-minute sequence in which the player, as a CIA agent infiltrating a terrorist cell, takes part in\na massacre of innocent civilians. The player was not required to shoot civilians and could skip the\nsequence if desired, but these options did not stop international attention and calls to ban the\ngame. [9] Proponents of the series argue that Call of Duty has a Mature rating and is not meant to be\nplayed by minors. They also point out that the games are less violent than many modern movies.\nHowever, the debate has continued, escalating as far as the United Kingdom\u2019s House of Commons. [10]\nWii Sports and Wii Fit\nThe Nintendo Wii, with its dedicated motion-sensitive controller, was sold starting in 2006. The company\nhad attempted to implement similar controllers in the past, including the Power Glove in 1989, but it had\nnever based an entire console around such a device. The Wii\u2019s simple design was combined with basic\ngames such as Wii Sports to appeal to previously untapped audiences. Wii Sports was included with\npurchase of the Wii console and served as a means to demonstrate the new technology. It included five\ngames: baseball, bowling, boxing, tennis, and golf. Wii Sports created a way for group play without the\nneed for familiarity with video games. It was closer to outdoor social games such as horseshoes or croquet\nthan it was to Doom. There was also nothing objectionable about it: no violence, no in-your-face\nintensity\u2014just a game that even older people could access and enjoy. Wii Bowling tournaments were\nsometimes organized by retirement communities, and many people found the game to be a new way to\nsocialize with their friends and families. [11]\nWii Fit combined the previously incompatible terms \u201cfitness\u201d and \u201cvideo games.\u201d Using a touch-sensitive\nplatform, players could do aerobics, strength training, and yoga. The game kept track of players\u2019 weights,\nacting as a kind of virtual trainer. [12] Wii Fit used the potential of video games to create an interactive\nversion of an exercise machine, replacing workout videos and other forms of fitness that had never before\nconsidered Nintendo a competitor. This kind of design used the inherent strengths of video games to\ncreate a new kind of experience.\nNintendo found most of its past success marketing to younger demographics with games that were less\ncontroversial than the 1990s first-person shooters. Wii Sports and Wii Fit saw Nintendo playing to its\nstrengths and expanding on them with family-friendly games that encouraged multiple generations to use\nvideo games as a social platform. This campaign was so successful that it is being imitated by rival\ncompanies Sony and Microsoft, which have released the Sony PlayStation Move and the Microsoft Kinect.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n450 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Guitar Hero and Rock Band created a new means of marketing for the music industry. Music featured on\nthe games experienced increased downloads and sales.\n\uf0b7 The Grand Theft Auto series was revolutionary and controversial for its open-ended field. Players could\nchoose from a number of different options, allowing them to set their own goals and create their own\nversion of the game.\n\uf0b7 World of Warcraft has brought the MMORPG genre to new heights of popularity. The large number of\nusers has made the game evolve to a level of complexity unheard of in video games.\n\uf0b7 Wii Sports and Wii Fit brought video games to audiences that had never been tapped by game makers.\nOlder adults and families used Wii Sports as a means of family bonding, and Wii Fit took advantage of\nmotion-controlled game playing to enter the fitness market.\nEXERCISES\nThink about the ways in which the games from Section 10.2 \"Influential Contemporary Games\" were\ninnovative and groundbreaking.

Describe gaming culture and how it has influenced mainstream culture.\n2. Analyze the ways video games have affected other forms of media.\n3. Describe how video games can be used for educational purposes.\n4. Identify the arguments for and against the depiction of video games as an art.\nAn NPD poll conducted in 2007 found that 72 percent of the U.S. population had played a video\ngame that year. [1] The increasing number of people playing video games means that video games are\nhaving an undeniable effect on culture. This effect is clearly visible in the increasing mainstream\nacceptance of aspects of gaming culture. Video games have also changed the way that many other\nforms of media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Education has also been changed\nby video games through the use of new technologies that help teachers and students communicate in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n452 new ways through educational games such as Brain Age. As video games have an increasing influence\non our culture, many have voiced their opinions on whether this form of media should be considered\nan art.\nGame Culture\nTo fully understand the effects of video games on mainstream culture, it is important to understand the\ndevelopment of gaming culture, or the culture surrounding video games. Video games, like books or\nmovies, have avid users who have made this form of media central to their lives. In the early 1970s,\nprogrammers got together in groups to play Spacewar!, spending a great deal of time competing in a\ngame that was rudimentary compared to modern games. [2]As video arcades and home video game\nconsoles gained in popularity, youth culture quickly adapted to this type of media, engaging in\ncompetitions to gain high scores and spending hours at the arcade or with the home console.\nIn the 1980s, an increasing number of kids were spending time on consoles playing games and, more\nimportantly, increasingly identifying with the characters and products associated with the games.\nSaturday morning cartoons were made out of the Pac-Man and Super Mario Bros. games, and an array of\nnongame merchandise was sold with video game logos and characters. The public recognition of some of\nthese characters has made them into cultural icons. A poll taken in 2007 found that more Canadians\nsurveyed could identify a photo of Mario, from Super Mario Bros., than a photo of the current Canadian\nprime minister. [3]\nAs the kids who first played Super Mario Bros. began to outgrow video games, companies such as Sega,\nand later Sony and Microsoft, began making games to appeal to older demographics. This has increased\nthe average age of video game players, which was 35 in 2009. [4] The Nintendo Wii has even found a new\ndemographic in retirement communites, where Wii Bowling has become a popular form of entertainment\nfor the residents. [5] The gradual increase in gaming age has led to an acceptance of video games as an\nacceptable form of mainstream entertainment.\nThe Subculture of Geeks\nThe acceptance of video games in mainstream culture has consequently changed the way that the culture\nviews certain people. \u201cGeek\u201d was the name given to people who were adept at technology but lacking in\nthe skills that tended to make one popular, like fashion sense or athletic ability. Many of these people,\nbecause they often did not fare well in society, favored imaginary worlds such as those found in the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n453 fantasy and science fiction genres. Video games were appealing because they were both a fantasy world\nand a means to excel at something. Jim Rossignol, in his 2008 book This Gaming Life: Travels in Three\nCities, explained part of the lure of playing Quake III online:\nCold mornings, adolescent disinterest, and a nagging hip injury had meant that I was banished from\nthe sports field for many years. I wasn\u2019t going to be able to indulge in the camaraderie that sports teams\nfelt or in the extended buzz of victory through dedication and cooperation. That entire swathe of\nexperience had been cut off from me by cruel circumstance and a good dose of self-defeating apathy.\nNow, however, there was a possibility for some kind of redemption: a sport for the quick-fingered and\nthe computer-bound; a space of possibility in which I could mold friends and strangers into a proficient\ngaming team. [6]\nVideo games gave a group of excluded people a way to gain proficiency in the social realm. As video games\nbecame more of a mainstream phenomenon and video game skills began to be desired by a large number\nof people, the popular idea of geeks changed. It is now common to see the term \u201cgeek\u201d used to mean a\nperson who understands computers and technology. This former slur is also prominent in the media, with\nheadlines in 2010 such as \u201cGeeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds.\u201d [7]\nMany media stories focusing on geeks examine the ways in which this subculture has been accepted by the\nmainstream. Geeks may have become \u201ccooler,\u201d but mainstream culture has also become \u201cgeekier.\u201d The\nacceptance of geek culture has led to acceptance of geek aesthetics. The mainstreaming of video games has\nled to acceptance of fantasy or virtual worlds. This is evident in the popularity of film/book series such as\nThe Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Comic book characters, emblems of geek culture, have become\nthe vehicles for blockbuster movies such as Spider-Man and The Dark Knight. The idea of a fantasy or\nvirtual world has come to appeal to greater numbers of people. Virtual worlds such as those represented\nin the Grand Theft Auto and Halo series and online games such as World of Warcraft have expanded the\nidea of virtual worlds so that they are not mere means of escape but new ways to interact. [8]\nThe Effects of Video Games on Other Types of Media\nVideo games during the 1970s and 1980s were often derivatives of other forms of media. E.T., Star Wars,\nand a number of other games took their cues from movies, television shows, and books. This began to\nchange in the 1980s with the development of cartoons based on video games, and in the 1990s and 2000s\nwith live-action feature films based on video games.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n454 Television\nTelevision programs based on video games were an early phenomenon. Pac-Man, Pole Position,\nand Q*bert were among the animated programs that aired in the early 1980s. In the later 1980s, shows\nsuch as The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! and The Legend of Zelda promoted Nintendo games. In the\n1990s,Pok\u00e9mon, originally a game developed for the Nintendo Game Boy, was turned into a television\nseries, a card game, several movies, and even a musical. [9]Recently, several programs have been developed\nthat revolve entirely around video games\u2014the web series The Guild, for instance, tells the story of a group\nof friends who interact through an unspecified MMORPG.\nNielsen, the company that tabulates television ratings, has begun rating video games in a similar fashion.\nIn 2010, this information showed that video games, as a whole, could be considered a kind\nof fifth network, along with the television networks NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox. [10] Advertisers use Nielsen\nratings to decide which programs to support. The use of this system is changing public perceptions to\ninclude video game playing as a habit similar to television watching.\nVideo games have also influenced the way that television is produced. The Rocket Racing League,\nscheduled to be launched in 2011, will feature a \u201cvirtual racetrack.\u201d Racing jets will travel along a virtual\ntrack that can only be seen by pilots and spectators with enabled equipment. Applications for mobile\ndevices are being developed that will allow spectators to race virtual jets alongside the ones flying in real\ntime. [11] This type of innovation is only possible with a public that has come to demand and rely on the\nkind of interactivity that video games provide.\nFilm\nThe rise in film adaptations of video games accompanies the increased age of video game users. In\n1995, Mortal Kombat, a live-action movie based on the video game, grossed over $70 million at the box\noffice, placing it 22nd in the rankings for that year. [12] Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, released in 2001, starred\nwell-known actress Angelina Jolie and ranked No. 1 at the box office when it was released, and 15th\noverall for the year. [13] Films based on video games are an increasingly common sight at the box office,\nsuch as producer Jerry Bruckheimer\u2019s Prince of Persia, or the recent sequel to Tron, based on the idea of a\nvirtual gaming arena.\nAnother aspect of video games\u2019 influence on films is how video game releases are marketed and perceived.\nThe release date for anticipated game Grand Theft Auto IV was announced and marketed to compete with\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n455 the release of the film Iron Man. Grand Theft Auto IV supposedly beat Iron Man by $300,000,000\nmillion in sales. This kind of comparison is, in some ways, misleading. Video games cost much more than\na ticket to a movie, so higher sales does not mean that more people bought the game than the movie. Also,\nthe distribution apparatus for the two media is totally different. Movies can only be released in theaters,\nwhereas video games can be sold at any retail outlet. [14] What this kind of news story proves, however, is\nthat the general public considers video games as something akin to a film. It is also important to realize\nthat the scale of production and profit for video games is similar to that of films. Video games include\nmusic scores, actors, and directors in addition to the game designers, and the budgets for major games\nreflect this. Grand Theft Auto IV cost an estimated $100 million to produce. [15]\nMusic\nVideo games have been accompanied by music ever since the days of the arcade. Video game music was\noriginally limited to computer beeps turned into theme songs. The design of the Nintendo 64, Sega\nSaturn, and Sony PlayStation made it possible to use sampled audio on new games, meaning songs played\non physical instruments could be recorded and used on video games. Beginning with the music of\nthe Final Fantasy series, scored by famed composer Nobuo Uematsu, video game music took on film\nscore quality, complete with full orchestral and vocal tracks. This innovation proved beneficial to the\nmusic industry. Well-known musicians such as Trent Reznor, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani\nwere able to create the soundtracks for popular games, giving these artists exposure to new generations of\npotential fans. [16] Composing music for video games has turned into a profitable means of employment for\nmany musicians. Schools such as Berklee College of Music, Yale, and New York University have programs\nthat focus on composing music for video games. The students are taught many of the same principles that\nare involved in film scoring. [17]\nMany rock bands have allowed their previously recorded songs to be used in video games, similar to a hit\nsong being used on a movie soundtrack. The bands are paid for the rights to use the song, and their music\nis exposed to an audience that otherwise might not hear it. As mentioned earlier, games like Rock Band\nand Guitar Hero have been used to promote bands. The release of The Beatles: Rock Band was timed to\ncoincide with the release of digitally remastered reissues of the Beatles\u2019 albums.\nAnother phenomenon relating to music and video games involves musicians covering video game music.\nA number of bands perform only video game covers in a variety of styles, such as the popular Japanese\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n456 group the Black Mages, which performs rock versions of Final Fantasy music. Playing video game themes\nis not limited to rock bands, however. An orchestra and chorus called Video Games Live started a tour in\n2005 dedicated to playing well-known video game music. Their performances are often accompanied by\ngraphics projected onto a screen showing relevant sequences from the video games. [18]\nMachinima\nRecently, the connection between video games and other media has increased with the popularity\nof machinima, animated films and series created by recording character actions inside video games.\nBeginning with the short film \u201cDiary of a Camper,\u201d filmed inside the game Quake in 1996, fans of video\ngames have adopted the technique of machinima to tell their own stories. Although these early movies\nwere released only online and targeted a select niche of gamers, professional filmmakers have since\nadopted the process, using machinima to storyboard scenes and to add a sense of individuality to\ncomputer-generated shots. This new form of media is increasingly becoming mainstream, as television\nshows such as South Park and channels such as MTV2 have introduced machinima to a larger\naudience. [19]\nVideo Games and Education\nFigure 10.7\nEducational video games have proven to be useful tools for educators.\nOne sign of the mainstreaming of video games is the increase of educational institutions that embrace\nthem. As early as the 1980s, games such as Number Munchers and Word Munchers were designed to help\nchildren develop basic math and grammar skills. In 2006, the Federation of American Scientists\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n457 completed a study that approved of video game use in education. The study cited the fact that video game\nsystems were present in most households, kids favored learning through video games, and games could be\nused to facilitate analytical skills. [20] Another study, published in the science journal Nature in 2002,\nfound that regular video game players had better developed visual-processing skills than people who did\nnot play video games. Participants in the test were asked to play a first-person shooter game for one hour\na day for 10 days, and were then tested for specific visual attention skills. The playing improved these\nskills in all participants, but the regular video game players had a greater skill level than the non\u2013game\nplayers. According to the study, \u201cAlthough video-game playing may seem to be rather mindless, it is\ncapable of radically altering visual attention processing.\u201d[21]\nOther educational institutions have begun to embrace video games as well. The Boy Scouts of America\nhave created a \u201cbelt loop,\u201d something akin to a merit badge, for tasks including learning to play a parent-\napproved game and developing a schedule to balance video game time with homework. [22] The federal\ngovernment has also seen the educational potential of video games. A commission on balancing the\nfederal budget suggested a video game that would educate Americans about the necessary costs of\nbalancing the federal budget.[23] The military has similarly embraced video games as training simulators\nfor new soldiers. These simulators, working off of newer game technologies, present several different\nrealistic options that soldiers could face on the field. The games have also been used as recruiting tools by\nthe U.S. Army and the Army National Guard. [24]\nThe ultimate effect of video game use for education, whether in schools or in the public arena, means that\nvideo games have been validated by established cultural authorities. Many individuals still resist the idea\nthat video games can be beneficial or have a positive cultural influence, but their embrace by educational\ninstitutions has given video games validation.\nVideo Games as Art\nWhile universally accepted as a form of media, a debate has recently arisen over whether video games can\nbe considered a form of art. Roger Ebert, the well-known film critic, has historically argued that \u201cvideo\ngames can never be art,\u201d citing the fact that video games are meant to be won, whereas art is meant to be\nexperienced. [25]\nHis remarks have generated an outcry from both video gamers and developers. Many point to games such\nas 2009\u2019s Flower, in which players control the flow of flower petals in the wind, as examples of video\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n458 games developing into art. Flower avoids specific plot and characters to allow the player to focus on\ninteraction with the landscape and the emotion of the game-play. [26] Likewise, more mainstream games\nsuch as the popular Katamari series, released in 2004, are built around the idea of creation, requiring\nplayers to pull together a massive clump of objects in order to create a star.\nVideo games, once viewed as a mindless source of entertainment, are now being featured in publications\nsuch as The New Yorker magazine and The New York Times. [27] With the development of increasingly\ncomplex musical scores and the advent of machinima, the boundaries between video games and other\nforms of media are slowly blurring. While they may not be considered art by everyone, video games have\ncontributed significantly to modern artistic culture.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The aesthetics and principles of gaming culture have had an increasing effect on mainstream culture. This\nhas led to the gradual acceptance of marginalized social groups and increased comfort with virtual worlds\nand the pursuit of new means of interaction.\n\uf0b7 Video games have gone from being a derivative medium that took its cues from other media, such as\nbooks, films, and music, to being a form of media that other types derive new ideas from. Video games\nhave also interacted with older forms of media to change them and create new means of entertainment\nand interaction.\n\uf0b7 Educational institutions have embraced the use of video games as valuable tools for teaching. These tools\ninclude simulated worlds in which important life skills can be learned and improved.\n\uf0b7 While video games may not be accepted by everyone as a form of art, there is no doubt that they\ncontribute greatly to artistic media such as music and film.\nEXERCISES\nThink about the ways in which video games have influenced and affected other forms of media. Then\nconsider the following questions:\n1. Are there things video games will never be able to offer?\n2.

Describe controversial issues related to modern video games.\n2. Analyze the issues and problems with rating electronic entertainment.\n3. Discuss the effects of video game addiction.\n4. Examine the gender issues surrounding video games.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n461 The increasing realism and expanded possibilities of video games has inspired a great deal of\ncontroversy. However, even early games, though rudimentary and seemingly laughable nowadays,\nraised controversy over their depiction of adult themes. Although increased realism and graphics\ncapabilities of contemporary video games have increased the shock value of in-game violence,\ninternational culture has been struggling to come to terms with video game violence since the dawn\nof video games.\nViolence\nViolence in video games has been controversial from their earliest days. Death Race, an arcade game\nreleased in 1976, encouraged drivers to run over stick figures, which then turned into Xs. Although the\nprogrammers claimed that the stick figures were not human, the game was controversial, making national\nnews on the television talk show Donahue and the television news magazine 60 Minutes. Video games,\nregardless of their realism or lack thereof, had added a new potential to the world of games and\nentertainment: the ability to simulate murder.\nThe enhanced realism of video games in the 1990s accompanied a rise in violent games as companies\nexpanded the market to target older demographics. A great deal of controversy exists over the influence of\nthis kind of violence on children, and also over the rating system that is applied to video games. There are\nmany stories of real-life violent acts involving video games. The\n1999Columbine High School massacre was quickly linked to the teenage perpetrators\u2019 enthusiasm for\nvideo games. The families of Columbine victims brought a lawsuit against 25 video game companies,\nclaiming that if the games had not existed, the massacre would not have happened. [1] In 2008, a 17-year-\nold boy shot his parents after they took away his video game system, killing his mother. [2] Also in 2008,\nwhen 6 teens were arrested for attempted carjacking and robbery, they stated that they were reenacting\nscenes from Grand Theft Auto. [3]\nThere is no shortage of news stories that involve young men committing crimes relating to an obsession\nwith video games. The controversy has not been resolved regarding the influences behind these crimes.\nMany studies have linked aggression to video games; however, critics take issue with using the results of\nthese studies to claim that the video games caused the aggression. They point out that people who enact\nvideo-game\u2013related crimes already have psychopathic tendencies, and that the results of such research\nstudies are correlational rather than causational\u2014a naturally violent person is drawn to play violent video\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n462 games. [4] Other critics point out that violent games are designed for adults, just as violent movies are, and\nthat parents should enforce stricter standards for their children.\nThe problem of children\u2019s access to violent games is a large and complex one. Video games present\ndifficult issues for those who create the ratings. One problem is the inconsistency that seems to exist in\nrating video games and movies. Movies with violence or sexual themes are rated either R or NC-17.\nFilmmakers prefer the R rating over the NC-17 rating because NC-17 ratings hurt box office sales, and they\nwill often heavily edit films to remove overly graphic content.\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), rates video games. The two most restrictive ratings the\nESRB has put forth are \u201cM\u201d (for Mature; 17 and older; \u201cmay contain mature sexual themes, more intense\nviolence, and/or strong language\u201d) and \u201cAO\u201d (for Adults Only; 18 and up; \u201cmay include graphic depictions\nof sex and/or violence\u201d). If this rating system were applied to movies, a great deal of movies now rated R\nwould be labeled AO. An AO label can have a devastating effect on game sales; in fact, many retail outlets\nwill not sell games with an AO rating. [5] This creates a situation where a video game with a sexual or\nviolent scene as graphic as the ones seen in R-rated movies is difficult to purchase, whereas a\npornographic magazine can be bought at many convenience stores. This issue reveals a unique aspect of\nvideo games. Although many of them are designed for adults, the distribution system and culture\nsurrounding video games is still largely youth-oriented.\nVideo Game Addiction\nAnother controversial issue is the problem of video game addiction. As of the print date, the American\nMedical Association (AMA) has not created an official diagnosis of video game addiction, citing the lack of\nlong-term research. However, the AMA uses the term \u201cvideo game overuse\u201d to describe video game use\nthat begins to affect other aspects of an individual\u2019s life, such as relationships and health. Studies have\nfound that socially marginalized people have more of a tendency to overuse games, especially online role-\nplaying games like World of Warcraft. Other studies have found that patterns of time usage and social\ndysfunction in players who overuse games are similar to those of other addictive disorders. [6]\nFigure 10.8\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n463 Video game use can become an obsession with some people.\nGroups such as Online Gamers Anonymous have developed a 12-step program similar to that of\nAlcoholics Anonymous to help gamers deal with problems relating to game overuse. This group is run by\nformer online gamers and family members of those affected by heavy game use. [7] This problem is not\nnew, but it has become more prevalent. In the early 1990s, many stories surfaced of individuals dropping\nout of college or getting divorced because of addiction to MUDs. [8] In addition, heavy video gaming, much\nlike heavy computer use in an office setting, can result in painful repetitive stress injuries. Even worse are\nthe rare, but serious, cases of death resulting from video game overuse. In the early 1980s, two deaths\nwere linked to the video game Berzerk. The players, both in their late teens, suffered fatal heart attacks\nwhile struggling to achieve top scores. [9] The issue of video game addiction has become a larger one\nbecause of the ubiquity of video games and Internet technology. In countries that have a heavily wired\ninfrastructure, such as South Korea, the problem is even bigger. In 2010, excessive game use was\nproblematic enough that the South Korean government imposed an online gaming curfew for people\nunder the age of 18 that would block certain sites after midnight. This decision followed the death of a 3-\nmonth-old baby from starvation while her parents played an online game at an Internet caf\u00e9. [10]\nAnother side of video game addiction is told well by Jim Rossignol in his book This Gaming Life: Travels\nin Three Cities. The book describes Rossignol\u2019s job as a journalist for a financial company and his\nincreasing involvement with Quake III. Rossignol trained a team of players to compete in virtual online\ntournaments, scheduling practices and spending the hours afterward analyzing strategies with his\nteammates. His intense involvement in the game led to poor performance at his job, and he was\neventually fired. After being fired, he spent even more time on the game, not caring about his lack of a job\nor shrinking savings. The story up to this point sounds like a testimonial about the dangers of game\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n464 addiction. However, because of his expertise in the game, he was hired by a games magazine and enjoyed\nfull-time employment writing about what he loved doing. Rossignol does not gloss over the fact that\ngames can have a negative influence, but his book speaks to the ways in which gaming\u2014often what would\nbe described as obsessive gaming\u2014can cause positive change in people\u2019s lives. [11]\nSexism\nIt is no secret that young adult men make up the majority of video gamers. A study in 2009 found that 60\npercent of gamers were male, and the average age of players was 35. [12] While the gender gap has certainly\nnarrowed in the past 30 years, video gaming is still in many ways a male-dominated medium.\nMale influence can be seen throughout the industry. Women make up less than 12 percent of game\ndesigners and programmers, and those who do enter the field often find themselves facing subtle\u2014and\nnot so subtle\u2014sexism. [13] When Game Developer magazine released its list of top 50 people in the video\ngame industry for 2010, bloggers were quick to note that no female developers appeared in the list. [14] In\n2007, scandal erupted over a pornographic comic featuring Jade Raymond, current managing director of\nthe French video game publisher Ubisoft, that surfaced on an online forum. The motivation behind the\ncomic was to allege that Raymond did not deserve her position at Ubisoft because she earned it based on\nher looks, rather than on her abilities and experience.\nSexism in video games has existed since the early days of the medium. The plot of the infamous Custer\u2019s\nRevenge, released for the Atari 2600 in 1982, centered on the rape of a Native American woman. Popular\nNES games such as Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda featured a male figure rescuing a damsel\nin distress. Both the protagonist and antagonist in the original Tomb Raider game had hourglass figures\nwith prominent busts and nonexistent waists, a trend that continues in the franchise today. In 2003, the\nfighting series Dead or Alive released a spin-off game titled Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball that\nexisted to showcase the well-endowed female characters in swim attire. [15] The spin-off was so popular\nthat two more similar games were released.\nSome note that video games are not unique in their demeaning portrayal of women. Like movies,\ntelevision, and other media forms, video games often fall back on gender stereotyping in order to engage\nconsumers. Defenders point out that many male video game characters are also depicted lewdly. Games\nsuch asGod of War and Mortal Kombat feature hypersexualized men with bulging muscles and aggressive\npersonalities who rely on their brawn rather than their brains. How are men affected by these\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n465 stereotypes? Laboratory studies have shown that violence and aggression in video games affect men more\nthan women, leading to higher levels of male aggression. [16] While sexism is certainly present in video\ngames, it seems sexual stereotyping affects both genders negatively.\nIn recent years, game designers have sought to move away from these clich\u00e9d representations of gender.\nThe popular game Portal, released in 2007, features a female protagonist clad in a simple orange\njumpsuit who relies on her wits to solve logic puzzles. Series such as Half-Life and Phoenix Wright: Ace\nAttorney star male heroes who are intellectuals instead of warriors. Other games, like the Mass\nEffect series and Halo: Reach, allow gamers to choose the gender of the main character without altering\nelements of the plot or game-play. However, despite recent strides forward, there is no doubt that as the\nvideo game industry continues to evolve, so too will the issue of gender.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Video game violence has been an issue since the 1976 game Death Race. The potential of video games to\nsimulate murder created a new issue in entertainment media.\n\uf0b7 A great number of news stories link video games with violent crimes. Studies have found a correlation\nbetween aggressive behavior and video games, but critics claim that these studies do not prove that video\ngames cause violent acts.\n\uf0b7 The video game rating system informs purchasers about the content of a game. The highest rating, Adults\nOnly, hurts video game sales, so companies try to make games that are rated Mature. Critics charge that\nvideo game ratings are inconsistent with other schemes, such as the movie rating system.\n\uf0b7 Video game addiction is associated more with online games, although many instances of single-player\nobsessions exist as well. It has become a high-profile issue with the rise in popularity of online gaming.\n\uf0b7 The American Medical Association has not developed a diagnosis for video game addiction. Instead, it\nuses the term \u201cvideo game overuse\u201d to describe a state where an individual\u2019s gaming habits have a\ndetrimental effect on his or her personal life.\n\uf0b7 Sexism and gender issues are hot topics in the video game industry, as female gamers and developers\noften struggle for equal footing. Controversy has arisen over character stereotypes; however, modern\ngames are beginning to break through conventional barriers of gender.\nEXERCISES\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n466 Choose video game violence or video game addiction and search for it on the Internet.

Identify how video games allow previously marginalized groups to enjoy new social experiences.\n2. Explain how virtual worlds can be used to facilitate learning.\n3. Describe the different ways video games have been used to communicate messages.\nEarly video games were easily identifiable as games. They had basic goals and set rules of play. As\ngames have developed in complexity, they have allowed for newer options and an expanded idea of\nwhat constitutes a game. At the same time, the aesthetics and design of game culture have been\napplied to tools and entertainment phenomena that are not technically games. The result is a\nblurring of the lines between games and other forms of communication, and the creation of new\nmeans of mixing information, entertainment, and communication.\nVideo Games and the Social World of Sports\nVideo games have developed in complexity and flexibility to the point that they are providing new kinds of\nsocial interactions. This is perhaps clearest when games are compared to physical sports. Most of the\nabstract reasons for involvement in sports\u2014things like teamwork, problem solving, and leadership\u2014are\nalso reasons to play video games that allow online team interaction. Sports are often portrayed as a social\nplatform where people can learn new skills. Amateur sports teams provide an important means of\nsocialization and communication for many people, allowing individuals from different gender, ethnic, and\nclass backgrounds to find a common forum for communication. Video games have similar capacities;\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n468 players who engage in online team battles must communicate with one another effectively and learn to\ncollectively solve problems. In fact, video games could arguably provide a more inclusive platform for\nsocializing because they do not exclude most socially or physically challenged individuals. The social\nplatform of online games is certainly no utopia, as competitive endeavors of any sort inevitably create\nopportunities for negative communication, but it allows people of different genders, races, and\nnationalities to play on equal footing, a feat that is difficult, if not impossible, in the physical realm.\nVirtual Worlds and Societal Interaction\nMassively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft, EverQuest,\nand EVE Online allow for an unprecedented variety of goals to be pursued. According to one study on\nonline communities,\n[t]hat means games are no longer meant to be a solitary activity played by a single individual.\nInstead, the player is expected to join a virtual community that is parallel with the physical\nworld, in which societal, cultural, and economical systems arise. [1]\nMMORPGs can function as a kind of hybrid of social media and video games in this respect. In some\ninstances, these games could function entirely as social media, and not as games. Consider a player who\nhas no desire to achieve any of the prescribed goals of a game, such as going on quests or accomplishing\ntasks. This individual could simply walk around in social areas and talk to new people. Is the player still\nplaying a game at this point, or has the game turned into a type of social media?\nVirtual worlds such as Second Life are good examples of the thin line between games and social media. In\nthis virtual world, users create avatars to represent themselves. They can then explore the world and take\npart in the culture that characterizes it. The Second Life website FAQ (frequently asked questions) tries to\nillustrate the differences between a virtual world and a video game:\nWhile the Second Life interface and display are similar to most popular massively multiplayer\nonline role playing games (or MMORPGs), there are two key, unique differences:\nCreativity: The Second Life virtual world provides almost unlimited freedom to its Residents.\nThis world really is whatever you make it. If you want to hang out with your friends in a garden\nor nightclub, you can. If you want to go shopping or fight dragons, you can. If you want to start a\nbusiness, create a game or build a skyscraper you can. It\u2019s up to you.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n469 Ownership: Instead of paying a monthly subscription fee, Residents can start a Basic account\nfor FREE. Additional Basic accounts cost a one-time flat fee of just $9.95. If you choose to get land\nto live, work and build on, you pay a monthly lease fee based on the amount of land you have.\nYou also own anything you create\u2014Residents retain intellectual property rights over their in-\nworld creations. [2]\nVirtual worlds may differ from traditional video games in key ways, but these differences will likely be\nfurther blurred as games develop. Regardless of the way these worlds are classified, they are based heavily\non the aesthetics and design of video games.\nVirtual worlds are societies in which communication can be expanded to relay information in ways that\ncannot be done with other forms of media. Universities have set up virtual classrooms in Second Life that\nemploy techniques for teaching that are otherwise impossible. Curriculum can be set up to take advantage\nof the virtual world\u2019s creative capacity. [3] For example, a class on architecture could lead students through\na three-dimensional recreation of a Gothic cathedral, a history class could rely on an interactive battlefield\nsimulation to explain the mechanics of a famous battle, or a physics class could use simulations to\ndemonstrate important principles.\nFigure 10.11\nVirtual classrooms have been used in Second Life as new teaching tools.\nVirtual worlds have been used to relay new kinds of information as well. In 2007, specialists developed\nvirtual-reality simulations to help patients with Asperger\u2019s syndrome navigate through social situations.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n470 Individuals with Asperger\u2019s syndrome have difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues and adapting to change.\nThe simulations allowed these patients to create avatars that then played out social situations such as job\ninterviews. The simulations could be adjusted to allow for more complicated interactions, and the users\ncould replay their own performances to better understand the simulation. [4] The creation of avatars and\nthe ability to replay scenes until the user improves performance is a direct influence of video games.\nSocial Media and Games\nFigure 10.12\nFarmVille is integrated with Facebook and lets players grow and harvest crops to expand their farms.\nSocial media outlets such as Facebook have also used video games to expand their communication\nplatforms. FarmVille, a game in which players plant, harvest, and sell crops and expand their farm plots\nwith the profits, is integrated with Facebook so that all users can connect with their real-life friends in the\ngame. The game adds another aspect of communication\u2014one centered on competition, strategy, and the\naesthetics of game-play\u2014to the Facebook platform. In 2010, FarmVille had 80 million users, an\nunprecedented number of people playing a single game. Other games for Facebook include Lexulous\n(formerly Scrabulous), a game that mimicked the board game Scrabble closely enough that it had to be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n471 changed, and Pet Society, a game that allows users to raise virtual animals as pets. These games are\nunique in their demographic scope; they seek to engage literally anyone. By coupling games with social\nmedia sites, game designers have pushed the influence of video games to unprecedented levels. [5]\nDue to the increasing popularity of video games, many social networking websites have emerged in recent\nyears that target hard-core gamers and casual gamers alike. The website GamingPassions.com describes\nitself as a \u201cfree online dating and social networking site for the Video Gaming community\u201d that \u201callows\nyou to meet other video game lovers who \u2018get it.\u2019\u201d [6] Others, such as DateCraft, target players who share a\nlove of specific games, such as World of Warcraft. These websites allow players to socialize outside of the\nconfines of a video game and provide a way for fans of any game to connect. [7]\nMobile Phones and Gaming\nThe maker of FarmVille, a company called Zynga, has released a number of social networking games that\ncan be played via Internet-enabled mobile phones. Mafia Wars, a simulated version of organized crime\nthat originated as an online game, lets users manage their money and complete jobs from their mobile\nphones. This innovation is only a change of platform from the computer to the phone, but it promises to\nmake gaming a common means of social interaction.\nPhones are used to communicate directly with another person, whether through text messages, Facebook\nposts, or phone calls. Adding games to phones creates a new language that people can use to communicate\nwith each other. One can imagine the ways in which a spat between friends or a couple hooking up could\nbe communicated through this medium. During the week of Valentine\u2019s Day in 2010, the creators\nof FarmVille reported that users sent more than 500 million copies of virtual gifts to each\nother. [8] Competition, aggression, hostility, as well as generosity and general friendliness are given new\nmeans of expression with the addition of video games to the mobile platform.\nVideo Games and Their Messages\nAn important genre of games is often overlooked when focusing on the overall history and effect of video\ngames. These games are created to get a specific point across to the player, and are generally low-budget\nefforts by individuals or small groups. The group Molleindustria puts out a host of these games, including\nOligarchy, a game in which the player is an oil-drilling business executive who pursues corruption to gain\nprofits, or Faith Fighter, in which religious icons fight each other. [9] Downing Street Fighter is a similar\ngame, designed as a satirical representation of the United Kingdom\u2019s 2010 elections. [10]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n472 Other games in this genre include a great deal of content that informs players about current events. One\nexample is Cutthroat Capitalism, where users play the part of Somali pirates who are carrying out\nkidnapping and piracy missions. The player must weigh the risks and rewards of their exploits given a\nvariety of economic factors. [11] This game allows players to understand the forces at work behind\ninternational phenomena such as piracy. Other games include the Redistricting Game, a game aimed at\nencouraging congressional redistricting reform, and Planet Green Game, in which players find ways to\nconserve energy.[12] These games\u2019 publishers have used their medium to transmit information in new\nways. Political satire in the medium of the video game allows the player to, in effect, play a satirical joke to\nits logical conclusion, exploring the entire scope of the joke. Advocacy games engage players with an\ninteractive political message, rather than sending out traditional media ads. Mainstream groups such as\nPETA have also turned to video games to convey messages. During the 2008 Thanksgiving season, the\nanimal-rights group released a parody of the popular Cooking Mama games to demonstrate the cruelty of\neating meat. [13]\nFigure 10.13\nThe unauthorized PETA edition of Cooking Mama tackles the issue of animal cruelty.\nAlthough games of this type are not in a league with game series like Halo\u2014either in design or in\npopularity\u2014they are pushing the boundaries of the video game as a form of media. Political pamphlets\nwere a major source of information and political discourse during the American Revolution. Video games\nmay well come to serve a similar informational function.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n473 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Team-oriented video games have allowed new groups to learn skills similar to those learned in physical\nsports. Team building, competition, and problem solving are all major components of playing on a virtual\nteam.\n\uf0b7 Virtual worlds, though not video games in themselves, use the design and principles of video games to\ncreate new social spaces. These spaces are being used to create new social platforms and new ways of\ncommunicating complex ideas.\n\uf0b7 Video games have been added to social networking sites to expand the ways in which people can\ncommunicate with each other. The medium of the game allows players to interact with their friends in\nnew ways.\nEXERCISES\nSeveral examples of the ways in which virtual worlds could be used for education were mentioned in this\nsection.\n1.

The hiring manager understands that this is a biased\nview, designed to make the applicant look good, but that is all forgivable. After all, everyone applying for a\nparticular job is going through this same process, and barring great disasters, the chances of something\nparticularly negative reaching the desk of a hiring manager are not that great.\nHowever, there is a new step that is now an integral part of this application process\u2014hiding (or at least\ncleaning up) the applicants\u2019 virtual selves. This could entail \u201cGoogling\u201d\u2014shorthand for searching on\nGoogle\u2014their own name to see the search results. If the first thing that comes up is a Flickr album (an\nonline photo album from the photo-sharing site Flickr) from last month\u2019s Olympian-themed cocktail\nparty, it may be a good idea to make that album private to ensure that only friends can view the album.\nThe ubiquity of Web 2.0 social media like Facebook and Twitter allows anyone to easily start developing\nan online persona from as early as birth (depending on the openness of one\u2019s parents)\u2014and although this\nonline persona may not accurately reflect the individual, it may be one of the first things a stranger sees.\nThose online photos may not look bad to friends and family, but one\u2019s online persona may be a hiring\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n478 manager\u2019s first impression of a prospective employee. Someone in charge of hiring could search the\nInternet for information on potential new hires even before calling references.\nFirst impressions are an important thing to keep in mind when making an online persona professionally\nacceptable. Your presence online can be the equivalent of your first words to a brand-new acquaintance.\nInstead of showing a complete stranger your pictures from a recent party, it might be a better idea to hide\nthose pictures and replace them with a well-written blog\u2014or a professional-looking website.\nThe content on social networking sites like Facebook, where people use the Internet to meet new people\nand maintain old friendships, is nearly indestructible and may not actually belong to the user. In 2008, as\nFacebook was quickly gaining momentum, The New York Times ran an article, \u201cHow Sticky Is\nMembership on Facebook? Just Try Breaking Free\u201d\u2014a title that seems at once like a warning and a big-\nbrother taunt. The website does allow the option of deactivating one\u2019s account, but \u201cFacebook servers\nkeep copies of the information in those accounts indefinitely.\u201d [1] It is a double-edged sword: On one hand,\nusers who become disillusioned and quit Facebook can come back at any time and resume their activity;\non the other, one\u2019s information is never fully deleted. If a job application might be compromised by the\npresence of a Facebook profile, clearing the slate is possible, albeit with some hard labor. The user must\ndelete, item by item, every individual wall post, every group membership, every photo, and everything\nelse.\nNot all social networks are like this\u2014MySpace and Friendster still require users who want to delete their\naccounts to confirm this several times, but they offer a clear-cut \u201cdelete\u201d option\u2014but the sticky nature of\nFacebook information is nothing new. [2] Google even keeps a cache of deleted web pages, and the Internet\nArchive keeps decades-old historical records. This transition from ephemeral media\u2014television and radio,\npractically over as quickly as they are broadcast\u2014to the enduring permanence of the Internet may seem\nstrange, but in some ways it is built into the very structure of the system. Understanding how the Internet\nwas conceived may help elucidate the ways in which the Internet functions today\u2014from the difficulties of\ndeleting an online persona to the speedy and near-universal access to the world\u2019s information.\n[1] Maria Aspan, \u201cHow Sticky Is Membership on Facebook?

Define protocol and decentralization as they relate to the early Internet.\n2. Identify technologies that made the Internet accessible.\n3. Explain the causes and effects of the dot-com boom and crash.\nFrom its early days as a military-only network to its current status as one of the developed world\u2019s\nprimary sources of information and communication, the Internet has come a long way in a short\nperiod of time. Yet there are a few elements that have stayed constant and that provide a coherent\nthread for examining the origins of the now-pervasive medium. The first is the persistence of the\nInternet\u2014its Cold War beginnings necessarily influencing its design as a decentralized, indestructible\ncommunication network.\nThe second element is the development of rules of communication for computers that enable the\nmachines to turn raw data into useful information. These rules, or protocols, have been developed\nthrough consensus by computer scientists to facilitate and control online communication and have\nshaped the way the Internet works. Facebook is a simple example of a protocol: Users can easily\ncommunicate with one another, but only through acceptance of protocols that include wall posts,\ncomments, and messages. Facebook\u2019s protocols make communication possible and control that\ncommunication.\nThese two elements connect the Internet\u2019s origins to its present-day incarnation. Keeping them in\nmind as you read will help you comprehend the history of the Internet, from the Cold War to the\nFacebook era.\nThe History of the Internet\nThe near indestructibility of information on the Internet derives from a military principle used in secure\nvoice transmission: decentralization. In the early 1970s, the RAND Corporation developed a technology\n(later called \u201cpacket switching\u201d) that allowed users to send secure voice messages. In contrast to a system\nknown as the hub-and-spoke model, where the telephone operator (the \u201chub\u201d) would patch two people\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n480 (the \u201cspokes\u201d) through directly, this new system allowed for a voice message to be sent through an entire\nnetwork, or web, of carrier lines, without the need to travel through a central hub, allowing for many\ndifferent possible paths to the destination.\nDuring the Cold War, the U.S. military was concerned about a nuclear attack destroying the hub in its\nhub-and-spoke model; with this new web-like model, a secure voice transmission would be more likely to\nendure a large-scale attack. A web of data pathways would still be able to transmit secure voice \u201cpackets,\u201d\neven if a few of the nodes\u2014places where the web of connections intersected\u2014were destroyed. Only\nthrough the destruction of all the nodes in the web could the data traveling along it be completely wiped\nout\u2014an unlikely event in the case of a highly decentralized network.\nThis decentralized network could only function through common communication protocols. Just as we\nuse certain protocols when communicating over a telephone\u2014\u201chello,\u201d \u201cgoodbye,\u201d and \u201chold on for a\nminute\u201d are three examples\u2014any sort of machine-to-machine communication must also use protocols.\nThese protocols constitute a shared language enabling computers to understand each other clearly and\neasily.\nThe Building Blocks of the Internet\nIn 1973, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began research on protocols to\nallow computers to communicate over a distributed network. This work paralleled work done by the\nRAND Corporation, particularly in the realm of a web-based network model of communication. Instead of\nusing electronic signals to send an unending stream of ones and zeros over a line (the equivalent of a\ndirect voice connection), DARPA used this new packet-switching technology to send small bundles of\ndata. This way, a message that would have been an unbroken stream of binary data\u2014extremely vulnerable\nto errors and corruption\u2014could be packaged as only a few hundred numbers.\nFigure 11.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n481 Centralized versus distributed communication networks\nImagine a telephone conversation in which any static in the signal would make the message\nincomprehensible. Whereas humans can infer meaning from \u201cMeet me [static] the restaurant at 8:30\u201d (we\nreplace the static with the word at), computers do not necessarily have that logical linguistic capability. To\na computer, this constant stream of data is incomplete\u2014or \u201ccorrupted,\u201d in technological terminology\u2014and\nconfusing. Considering the susceptibility of electronic communication to noise or other forms of\ndisruption, it would seem like computer-to-computer transmission would be nearly impossible.\nHowever, the packets in this packet-switching technology have something that allows the receiving\ncomputer to make sure the packet has arrived uncorrupted. Because of this new technology and the\nshared protocols that made computer-to-computer transmission possible, a single large message could be\nbroken into many pieces and sent through an entire web of connections, speeding up transmission and\nmaking that transmission more secure.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n482 One of the necessary parts of a network is a host. A host is a physical node that is directly connected to the\nInternet and \u201cdirects traffic\u201d by routing packets of data to and from other computers connected to it. In a\nnormal network, a specific computer is usually not directly connected to the Internet; it is connected\nthrough a host. A host in this case is identified by an Internet Protocol, or IP, address (a concept that is\nexplained in greater detail later). Each unique IP address refers to a single location on the global Internet,\nbut that IP address can serve as a gateway for many different computers. For example, a college campus\nmay have one global IP address for all of its students\u2019 computers, and each student\u2019s computer might then\nhave its own local IP address on the school\u2019s network. This nested structure allows billions of different\nglobal hosts, each with any number of computers connected within their internal networks. Think of a\ncampus postal system: All students share the same global address (1000 College Drive, Anywhere, VT\n08759, for example), but they each have an internal mailbox within that system.\nThe early Internet was called ARPANET, after the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency (which added\n\u201cDefense\u201d to its name and became DARPA in 1973), and consisted of just four hosts: UCLA, Stanford, UC\nSanta Barbara, and the University of Utah. Now there are over half a million hosts, and each of those\nhosts likely serves thousands of people. [1] Each host uses protocols to connect to an ever-growing network\nof computers. Because of this, the Internet does not exist in any one place in particular; rather, it is the\nname we give to the huge network of interconnected computers that collectively form the entity that we\nthink of as the Internet. The Internet is not a physical structure; it is the protocols that make this\ncommunication possible.\nFigure 11.3\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n483 A TCP gateway is like a post office because of the way that it directs information to the correct\nlocation.\nOne of the other core components of the Internet is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) gateway.\nProposed in a 1974 paper, the TCP gateway acts \u201clike a postal service.\u201d [2] Without knowing a specific\nphysical address, any computer on the network can ask for the owner of any IP address, and the TCP\ngateway will consult its directory of IP address listings to determine exactly which computer the requester\nis trying to contact. The development of this technology was an essential building block in the interlinking\nof networks, as computers could now communicate with each other without knowing the specific address\nof a recipient; the TCP gateway would figure it all out. In addition, the TCP gateway checks for errors and\nensures that data reaches its destination uncorrupted. Today, this combination of TCP gateways and IP\naddresses is called TCP/IP and is essentially a worldwide phone book for every host on the Internet.\nYou\u2019ve Got Mail: The Beginnings of the Electronic Mailbox\nEmail has, in one sense or another, been around for quite a while. Originally, electronic messages were\nrecorded within a single mainframe computer system. Each person working on the computer would have\na personal folder, so sending that person a message required nothing more than creating a new document\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n484 in that person\u2019s folder. It was just like leaving a note on someone\u2019s desk, [3] so that the person would see it\nwhen he or she logged onto the computer.\nHowever, once networks began to develop, things became slightly more complicated. Computer\nprogrammer Ray Tomlinson is credited with inventing the naming system we have today, using\nthe @ symbol to denote the server (or host, from the previous section). In other words, name@gmail.com\ntells the host \u201cgmail.com\u201d (Google\u2019s email server) to drop the message into the folder belonging to \u201cname.\u201d\nTomlinson is credited with writing the first network email using his program SNDMSG in 1971. This\ninvention of a simple standard for email is often cited as one of the most important factors in the rapid\nspread of the Internet, and is still one of the most widely used Internet services.\nThe use of email grew in large part because of later commercial developments, especially America Online,\nthat made connecting to email much easier than it had been at its inception. Internet service providers\n(ISPs) packaged email accounts with Internet access, and almost all web browsers (such as Netscape,\ndiscussed later in the section) included a form of email service. In addition to the ISPs, email services like\nHotmail and Yahoo! Mail provided free email addresses paid for by small text ads at the bottom of every\nemail message sent. These free \u201cwebmail\u201d services soon expanded to comprise a large part of the email\nservices that are available today. Far from the original maximum inbox sizes of a few megabytes, today\u2019s\nemail services, like Google\u2019s Gmail service, generally provide gigabytes of free storage space.\nEmail has revolutionized written communication. The speed and relatively inexpensive nature of email\nmakes it a prime competitor of postal services\u2014including FedEx and UPS\u2014that pride themselves on\nspeed. Communicating via email with someone on the other end of the world is just as quick and\ninexpensive as communicating with a next-door neighbor. However, the growth of Internet shopping and\nonline companies such as Amazon.com has in many ways made the postal service and shipping companies\nmore prominent\u2014not necessarily for communication, but for delivery and remote business operations.\nHypertext: Web 1.0\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a graduate of Oxford University and software engineer at CERN (the European\nparticle physics laboratory), had the idea of using a new kind of protocol to share documents and\ninformation throughout the local CERN network. Instead of transferring regular text-based documents,\nhe created a new language called hypertext markup language (HTML). Hypertext was a new word for text\nthat goes beyond the boundaries of a single document. Hypertext can include links to other documents\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n485 (hyperlinks), text-style formatting, images, and a wide variety of other components. The basic idea is that\ndocuments can be constructed out of a variety of links and can be viewed just as if they are on the user\u2019s\ncomputer.\nThis new language required a new communication protocol so that computers could interpret it, and\nBerners-Lee decided on the name hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Through HTTP, hypertext\ndocuments can be sent from computer to computer and can then be interpreted by a browser, which turns\nthe HTML files into readable web pages. The browser that Berners-Lee created, called World Wide Web,\nwas a combination browser-editor, allowing users to view other HTML documents and create their own. [4]\nFigure 11.4\nTim Berners-Lee\u2019s first web browser was also a web page editor.\nModern browsers, like Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox, only allow for the viewing of web\npages; other increasingly complicated tools are now marketed for creating web pages, although even the\nmost complicated page can be written entirely from a program like Windows Notepad. The reason web\npages can be created with the simplest tools is the adoption of certain protocols by the most common\nbrowsers. Because Internet Explorer, Firefox, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and other browsers all\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n486 interpret the same code in more or less the same way, creating web pages is as simple as learning how to\nspeak the language of these browsers.\nIn 1991, the same year that Berners-Lee created his web browser, the Internet connection service Q-Link\nwas renamed America Online, or AOL for short. This service would eventually grow to employ over\n20,000 people, on the basis of making Internet access available (and, critically, simple) for anyone with a\ntelephone line. Although the web in 1991 was not what it is today, AOL\u2019s software allowed its users to\ncreate communities based on just about any subject, and it only required a dial-up modem\u2014a device that\nconnects any computer to the Internet via a telephone line\u2014and the telephone line itself.\nIn addition, AOL incorporated two technologies\u2014chat rooms and Instant Messenger\u2014into a single\nprogram (along with a web browser). Chat rooms allowed many users to type live messages to a \u201croom\u201d\nfull of people, while Instant Messenger allowed two users to communicate privately via text-based\nmessages. The most important aspect of AOL was its encapsulation of all these once-disparate programs\ninto a single user-friendly bundle. Although AOL was later disparaged for customer service issues like its\nusers\u2019 inability to deactivate their service, its role in bringing the Internet to mainstream users was\ninstrumental. [5]\nIn contrast to AOL\u2019s proprietary services, the World Wide Web had to be viewed through a standalone\nweb browser. The first of these browsers to make its mark was the program Mosaic, released by the\nNational Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Mosaic was offered for free\nand grew very quickly in popularity due to features that now seem integral to the web. Things like\nbookmarks, which allow users to save the location of particular pages without having to remember them,\nand images, now an integral part of the web, were all inventions that made the web more usable for many\npeople. [6]\nAlthough the web browser Mosaic has not been updated since 1997, developers who worked on it went on\nto create Netscape Navigator, an extremely popular browser during the 1990s. AOL later bought the\nNetscape company, and the Navigator browser was discontinued in 2008, largely because Netscape\nNavigator had lost the market to Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer web browser, which came preloaded on\nMicrosoft\u2019s ubiquitous Windows operating system. However, Netscape had long been converting its\nNavigator software into an open-source program called Mozilla Firefox, which is now the second-most-\nused web browser on the Internet (detailed in Table 11.1 \"Browser Market Share (as of February\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n487 2010)\"). [7] Firefox represents about a quarter of the market\u2014not bad, considering its lack of advertising\nand Microsoft\u2019s natural advantage of packaging Internet Explorer with the majority of personal\ncomputers.\nTable 11.1 Browser Market Share (as of February 2010)\nBrowser Total Market Share\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer 62.12%\nFirefox 24.43%\nChrome 5.22%\nSafari 4.53%\nOpera 2.38%\nSource: Courtesy of Net Applications.com http://www.netapplications.com/\nFor Sale: The Web\nAs web browsers became more available as a less-moderated alternative to AOL\u2019s proprietary service, the\nweb became something like a free-for-all of startup companies. The web of this period, often referred to as\nWeb 1.0, featured many specialty sites that used the Internet\u2019s ability for global, instantaneous\ncommunication to create a new type of business. Another name for this free-for-all of the 1990s is the\n\u201cdot-com boom.\u201d During the boom, it seemed as if almost anyone could build a website and sell it for\nmillions of dollars. However, the \u201cdot-com crash\u201d that occurred later that decade seemed to say otherwise.\nQuite a few of these Internet startup companies went bankrupt, taking their shareholders down with\nthem. Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, called this phenomenon \u201cirrational\nexuberance,\u201d [8] in large part because investors did not necessarily know how to analyze these particular\nbusiness plans, and companies that had never turned a profit could be sold for millions. The new business\nmodels of the Internet may have done well in the stock market, but they were not necessarily sustainable.\nIn many ways, investors collectively failed to analyze the business prospects of these companies, and once\nthey realized their mistakes (and the companies went bankrupt), much of the recent market growth\nevaporated. The invention of new technologies can bring with it the belief that old business tenets no\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n488 longer apply, but this dangerous belief\u2014the \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d Greenspan spoke of\u2014is not\nnecessarily conducive to long-term growth.\nSome lucky dot-com businesses formed during the boom survived the crash and are still around today.\nFor example, eBay, with its online auctions, turned what seemed like a dangerous practice (sending\nmoney to a stranger you met over the Internet) into a daily occurrence. A less-fortunate\ncompany, eToys.com, got off to a promising start\u2014its stock quadrupled on the day it went public in 1999\u2014\nbut then filed for Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social Media\" bankruptcy in 2001. [9]\nOne of these startups, theGlobe.com, provided one of the earliest social networking services that exploded\nin popularity. When theGlobe.com went public, its stock shot from a target price of $9 to a close of $63.50\na share. [10]The site itself was started in 1995, building its business on advertising. As skepticism about the\ndot-com boom grew and advertisers became increasingly skittish about the value of online\nads, theGlobe.com ceased to be profitable and shut its doors as a social networking site. [11] Although\nadvertising is pervasive on the Internet today, the current model\u2014largely based on the highly targeted\nGoogle AdSense service\u2014did not come around until much later. In the earlier dot-com years, the same ad\nmight be shown on thousands of different web pages, whereas now advertising is often specifically\ntargeted to the content of an individual page.\nHowever, that did not spell the end of social networking on the Internet. Social networking had been\ngoing on since at least the invention of Usenet in 1979 (detailed later in the chapter), but the recurring\nproblem was always the same: profitability. This model of free access to user-generated content departed\nfrom almost anything previously seen in media, and revenue streams would have to be just as radical.\nThe Early Days of Social Media\nThe shared, generalized protocols of the Internet have allowed it to be easily adapted and extended into\nmany different facets of our lives. The Internet shapes everything, from our day-to-day routine\u2014the\nability to read newspapers from around the world, for example\u2014to the way research and collaboration are\nconducted. There are three important aspects of communication that the Internet has changed, and these\nhave instigated profound changes in the way we connect with one another socially: the speed of\ninformation, the volume of information, and the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of publishing, or the ability of anyone\nto publish ideas on the web.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n489 One of the Internet\u2019s largest and most revolutionary changes has come about through social networking.\nBecause of Twitter, we can now see what all our friends are doing in real time; because of blogs, we can\nconsider the opinions of complete strangers who may never write in traditional print; and because of\nFacebook, we can find people we haven\u2019t talked to for decades, all without making a single awkward\ntelephone call.\nRecent years have seen an explosion of new content and services; although the phrase \u201csocial media\u201d now\nseems to be synonymous with websites like Facebook and Twitter, it is worthwhile to consider all the ways\na social media platform affects the Internet experience.\nHow Did We Get Here? The Late 1970s, Early 1980s, and Usenet\nAlmost as soon as TCP stitched the various networks together, a former DARPA scientist named Larry\nRoberts founded the company Telnet, the first commercial packet-switching company. Two years later, in\n1977, the invention of the dial-up modem (in combination with the wider availability of personal\ncomputers like the Apple II) made it possible for anyone around the world to access the Internet. With\navailability extended beyond purely academic and military circles, the Internet quickly became a staple for\ncomputer hobbyists.\nOne of the consequences of the spread of the Internet to hobbyists was the founding of Usenet. In 1979,\nUniversity of North Carolina graduate students Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis connected three computers in\na small network and used a series of programming scripts to post and receive messages. In a very short\nspan of time, this system spread all over the burgeoning Internet. Much like an electronic version of\ncommunity bulletin boards, anyone with a computer could post a topic or reply on Usenet.\nThe group was fundamentally and explicitly anarchic, as outlined by the posting \u201cWhat is Usenet?\u201d This\ndocument says, \u201cUsenet is not a democracy \u2026 there is no person or group in charge of Usenet \u2026Usenet\ncannot be a democracy, autocracy, or any other kind of \u2018-acy.\u2019\u201d [12] Usenet was not used only for socializing,\nhowever, but also for collaboration. In some ways, the service allowed a new kind of collaboration that\nseemed like the start of a revolution: \u201cI was able to join rec.kites and collectively people in Australia and\nNew Zealand helped me solve a problem and get a circular two-line kite to fly,\u201d one user told the United\nKingdom\u2019s Guardian. [13]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n490 GeoCities: Yahoo! Pioneers\nFast-forward to 1995: The president and founder of Beverly Hills Internet, David Bohnett, announces that\nthe name of his company is now \u201cGeoCities.\u201d GeoCities built its business by allowing users\n(\u201chomesteaders\u201d) to create web pages in \u201ccommunities\u201d for free, with the stipulation that the company\nplaced a small advertising banner at the top of each page. Anyone could register a GeoCities site and\nsubsequently build a web page about a topic. Almost all of the community names, like Broadway (live\ntheater) and Athens (philosophy and education), were centered on specific topics. [14]\nThis idea of centering communities on specific topics may have come from Usenet. In Usenet, the domain\nalt.rec.kites refers to a specific topic (kites) within a category (recreation) within a larger community\n(alternative topics). This hierarchical model allowed users to organize themselves across the vastness of\nthe Internet, even on a large site like GeoCities. The difference with GeoCities was that it allowed users to\ndo much more than post only text (the limitation of Usenet), while constraining them to a relatively small\npool of resources. Although each GeoCities user had only a few megabytes of web space, standardized\npictures\u2014like mailbox icons and back buttons\u2014were hosted on GeoCities\u2019s main server. GeoCities was\nsuch a large part of the Internet, and these standard icons were so ubiquitous, that they have now become\na veritable part of the Internet\u2019s cultural history. The Web Elements category of the site Internet\nArchaeology is a good example of how pervasive GeoCities graphics became. [15]\nGeoCities built its business on a freemium model, where basic services are free but subscribers pay extra\nfor things like commercial pages or shopping carts. Other Internet businesses, like Skype and Flickr, use\nthe same model to keep a vast user base while still profiting from frequent users. Since loss of online\nadvertising revenue was seen as one of the main causes of the dot-com crash, many current web startups\nare turning toward this freemium model to diversify their income streams. [16]\nGeoCities\u2019s model was so successful that the company Yahoo! bought it for $3.6 billion at its peak in 1999.\nAt the time, GeoCities was the third-most-visited site on the web (behind Yahoo! and AOL), so it seemed\nlike a sure bet. A decade later, on October 26, 2009, Yahoo! closed GeoCities for good in every country\nexcept Japan.\nDiversification of revenue has become one of the most crucial elements of Internet businesses; from\nthe Wall Street Journal online to YouTube, almost every website is now looking for multiple income\nstreams to support its services.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n491 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The two primary characteristics of the original Internet were decentralization and free, open protocols\nthat anyone could use. As a result of its decentralized \u201cweb\u201d model of organization, the Internet can store\ndata in many different places at once. This makes it very useful for backing up data and very difficult to\ndestroy data that might be unwanted. Protocols play an important role in this, because they allow some\ndegree of control to exist without a central command structure.\n\uf0b7 Two of the most important technological developments were the personal computer (such as the Apple\nII) and the dial-up modem, which allowed anyone with a phone line to access the developing Internet.\nAmerica Online also played an important role, making it very easy for practically anyone with a computer\nto use the Internet. Another development, the web browser, allowed for access to and creation of web\npages all over the Internet.\n\uf0b7 With the advent of the web browser, it seemed as if anyone could make a website that people wanted to\nuse. The problem was that these sites were driven largely by venture capital and grossly inflated initial\npublic offerings of their stock. After failing to secure any real revenue stream, their stock plummeted, the\nmarket crashed, and many of these companies went out of business. In later years, companies tried to\ndiversify their investments, particularly by using a \u201cfreemium\u201d model of revenue, in which a company\nwould both sell premium services and advertise, while offering a free pared-down service to casual users.\nEXERCISES\nWebsites have many different ways of paying for themselves, and this can say a lot about both the site and\nits audience. The business models of today\u2019s websites may also directly reflect the lessons learned during\nthe early days of the Internet. Start this exercise by reviewing a list of common ways that websites pay for\nthemselves, how they arrived at these methods, and what it might say about them:\n\uf0b7 Advertising: The site probably has many casual viewers and may not necessarily be well established. If\nthere are targeted ads (such as ads directed toward stay-at-home parents with children), then it is\npossible the site is successful with a small audience.\n\uf0b7 Subscription option: The site may be a news site that prides itself on accuracy of information or lack of\nbias, whose regular readers are willing to pay a premium for the guarantee of quality material.\nAlternately, the site may cater to a small demographic of Internet users by providing them with\nexclusive, subscription-only content.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n492 \uf0b7 Selling services: Online services, such as file hosting, or offline services and products are probably the\nclearest way to determine a site\u2019s revenue stream. However, these commercial sites often are not\nprized for their unbiased information, and their bias can greatly affect the content on the site.\nChoose a website that you visit often, and list which of these revenue streams the site might have. How\nmight this affect the content on the site? Is there a visible effect, or does the site try to hide it? Consider\nhow events during the early history of the Internet may have affected the way the site operates now.\nWrite down a revenue stream that the site does not currently have and how the site designers might\nimplement such a revenue stream.\n[1] Central Intelligence Agency, \u201cCountry Comparison: Internet Hosts,\u201d World Factbook,\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2184rank.html.\n[2] Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, \u201cSpecification of Internet Transmission Control Program,\u201d\nDecember 1974, http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc675.\n[3] Ian Peter, \u201cThe History of Email,\u201d The Internet History Project, 2004,\nhttp://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/email.html.\n[4] Tim Berners-Lee, \u201cThe WorldWideWeb Browser,\u201d 2009, http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-\nLee/WorldWideWeb.\n[5] Tom Zeller, Jr., \u201cCanceling AOL?

Identify the major social networking sites, and give possible uses and demographics for each one.\n2. Show the positive and negative effects of blogs on the distribution and creation of information.\n3. Explain the ways privacy has been addressed on the Internet.\n4. Identify new information that marketers can use because of social networking.\nAlthough GeoCities lost market share, and although theGlobe.com never really made it to the 21st\ncentury, social networking has persisted. There are many different types of social media available\ntoday, from social networking sites like Facebook to blogging services like Blogger\nand WordPress.com. All these sites bring something different to the table, and a few of them even try\nto bring just about everything to the table at once.\nSocial Networking\nSocial networking services\u2014like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Buzz, and MySpace\u2014provide a\nlimited but public platform for users to create a \u201cprofile.\u201d This can range anywhere from the 140-character\n(that\u2019s letters and spaces, not words) \u201ctweets\u201d on Twitter, to the highly customizable MySpace, which\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n494 allows users to blog, customize color schemes, add background images, and play music. Each of these\nservices has its key demographic\u2014MySpace, for example, is particularly geared toward younger users. Its\nhuge array of features made it attractive to this demographic at first, but eventually it was overrun with\ncorporate marketing and solicitations for pornographic websites, leading many users to abandon the\nservice. In addition, competing social networking sites like Facebook offer superior interfaces that have\nlured away many of MySpace\u2019s users. MySpace has attempted to catch up by upgrading its own interface,\nbut it now faces the almost insurmountable obstacle of already-satisfied users of competing social\nnetworking services. As Internet technology evolves rapidly, most users have few qualms about moving to\nwhichever site offers the better experience; most users have profiles and accounts on many services at\nonce. But as relational networks become more and more established and concentrated on a few social\nmedia sites, it becomes increasingly difficult for newcomers and lagging challengers to offer the same rich\nnetworking experience. For a Facebook user with hundreds of friends in his or her social network,\nswitching to MySpace and bringing along his or her entire network of friends is a daunting and infeasible\nprospect. Google has attempted to circumvent the problem of luring users to create new social networks\nby building its Buzz service into its popular Gmail, ensuring that Buzz has a built-in user base and\nlowering the social costs of joining a new social network by leveraging users\u2019 Gmail contact lists. It\nremains to be seen if Google will be truly successful in establishing a vital new social networking service,\nbut its tactic of integrating Buzz into Gmail underscores how difficult it has become to compete with\nestablished social networks like Twitter and Facebook.\nWhereas MySpace initially catered to a younger demographic, LinkedIn caters to business professionals\nlooking for networking opportunities. LinkedIn is free to join and allows users to post resumes and job\nqualifications (rather than astrological signs and favorite television shows). Its tagline, \u201cRelationships\nmatter,\u201d emphasizes the role of an increasingly networked world in business; just as a musician might use\nMySpace to promote a new band, a LinkedIn user can use the site to promote professional services. While\nthese two sites have basically the same structure, they fulfill different purposes for different social groups;\nthe character of social networking is highly dependent on the type of social circle.\nTwitter offers a different approach to social networking, allowing users to \u201ctweet\u201d 140-character messages\nto their \u201cfollowers,\u201d making it something of a hybrid of instant messaging and blogging. Twitter is openly\nsearchable, meaning that anyone can visit the site and quickly find out what other Twitter users are saying\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n495 about any subject. Twitter has proved useful for journalists reporting on breaking news, as well as\nhighlighting the \u201cbest of\u201d the Internet. Twitter has also been useful for marketers looking for a free public\nforum to disseminate marketing messages. It became profitable in December 2009 through a $25 million\ndeal allowing Google and Microsoft to display its users\u2019 140-character messages in their search\nresults. [1] Facebook, originally deployed exclusively to Ivy League schools, has since opened its doors to\nanyone over 13 with an email account. With the explosion of the service and its huge growth among older\ndemographics, \u201cMy parents joined Facebook\u201d has become a common complaint. [2]\nAnother category of social media, blogs began as an online, public version of a diary or journal. Short for\n\u201cweb logs,\u201d these personal sites give anyone a platform to write about anything they want to. Posting\ntweets on the Twitter service is considered micro-blogging (because of the extremely short length of the\nposts). Some services, like LiveJournal, highlight their ability to provide up-to-date reports on personal\nfeelings, even going so far as to add a \u201cmood\u201d shorthand at the end of every post. The Blogger service (now\nowned by Google) allows users with Google accounts to follow friends\u2019 blogs and post\ncomments.WordPress.com, the company that created the open-source blogging platform WordPress.org,\nand LiveJournal both follow the freemium model by allowing a basic selection of settings for free, with the\noption to pay for things like custom styles and photo hosting space. What these all have in common,\nhowever, is their bundling of social networking (such as the ability to easily link to and comment on\nfriends\u2019 blogs) with an expanded platform for self-expression. At this point, most traditional media\ncompanies have incorporated blogs, Twitter, and other social media as a way to allow their reporters to\nupdate instantly and often. This form of media convergence, discussed in detail in Section 11.3 \"The\nEffects of the Internet and Globalization on Popular Culture and Interpersonal Communication\" of this\nchapter, is now a necessary part of doing business.\nThere are many other types of social media out there, many of which can be called to mind with a single\nname: YouTube (video sharing), Wikipedia (open-source encyclopedia composed of \u201cwikis\u201d editable by\nany user), Flickr (photo sharing), and Digg (content sharing). Traditional media outlets have begun\nreferring to these social media services and others like them as \u201cWeb 2.0.\u201d Web 2.0 is not a new version of\nthe web; rather, the term is a reference to the increased focus on user-generated content and social\ninteraction on the web, as well as the evolution of online tools to facilitate that focus. Instead of relying on\nprofessional reporters to get information about a protest in Iran, a person could just search for \u201cIran\u201d on\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n496 Twitter and likely end up with hundreds of tweets linking to everything from blogs to CNN.com to\nYouTube videos from Iranian citizens themselves. In addition, many of these tweets may actually be\ninstant updates from people using Twitter in Iran. This allows people to receive information straight from\nthe source, without being filtered through news organizations or censored by governments.\nGoing Viral\nIn 2009, Susan Boyle, an unemployed middle-aged Scottish woman, appeared on Britain\u2019s Got Talent and\nsang \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d from the musical Les Mis\u00e9rables, becoming an international star almost\novernight. It was not her performance itself that catapulted her to fame and sent her subsequently\nreleased album to the top of the UK Billboard charts and kept it there for 6 weeks. What did it was a\nYouTube video of her performance, viewed by 87,000,000 people and counting. [3]\nMedia that is spread from person to person when, for example, a friend sends you a link saying \u201cYou\u2019ve\ngot to see this!\u201d is said to have \u201cgone viral.\u201d Marketing and advertising agencies have deemed advertising\nthat makes use of this phenomenon as \u201cviral marketing.\u201d Yet many YouTube sensations have not come\nfrom large marketing firms. For instance, the four-piece pop-punk band OK Go filmed a music video on a\ntiny budget for their song \u201cHere It Goes Again\u201d and released it exclusively on YouTube in 2006. Featuring\na choreographed dance done on eight separate treadmills, the video quickly became a viral sensation and,\nas of May 2011, has over 7,265,825 views. The video helped OK Go attract millions of new fans and earned\nthem a Grammy award in 2007, making it one of the most notable successes of viral Internet marketing.\nViral marketing is, however, notoriously unpredictable and is liable to spawn remixes, spin-offs, and\nspoofs that can dilute or damage the messages that marketers intend to spread. Yet, when it is successful,\nviral marketing can reach millions of people for very little money and can even make it into the\nmainstream news.\nRecent successes and failures in viral marketing demonstrate how difficult it is for marketers to control\ntheir message as it is unleashed virally. In 2007, the band Radiohead released their album In\nRainbows online, allowing fans to download it for any amount of money they chose\u2014including for free.\nDespite practically giving the album away, the digital release of In Rainbows still pulled in more money\nthan Radiohead\u2019s previous album, Hail to the Thief, while the band simultaneously sold a huge number of\n$80 collector editions and still sold physical CDs months after the digital release became available. [4] In\ncontrast, the food giant Healthy Choice enlisted Classymommy.com blogger Colleen Padilla to write a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n497 sponsored review of its product, leading to a featured New York Times article on the blogger (not the\nproduct), which gave the product only a passing mention. [5] Often, a successfully marketed product will\nreach some people through the Internet and then break through into the mainstream media. Yet as the\narticle about Padilla shows, sometimes the person writing about the product overshadows the product\nitself.\nNot all viral media is marketing, however. In 2007, someone posted a link to a new trailer for Grand Theft\nAuto IV on the video games message board of the web forum 4chan.org. When users followed the link,\nthey were greeted not with a video game trailer but with Rick Astley singing his 1987 hit \u201cNever Gonna\nGive You Up.\u201d This technique\u2014redirecting someone to that particular music video\u2014became known as\nRickrolling and quickly became one of the most well-known Internet memes of all time. [6] An Internet\nmeme is a concept that quickly replicates itself throughout the Internet, and it is often nonsensical and\nabsurd. Another meme, \u201cLolcats,\u201d consists of misspelled captions\u2014\u201cI can has cheezburger?\u201d is a classic\nexample\u2014over pictures of cats. Often, these memes take on a metatextual quality, such as the meme\n\u201cMilhouse is not a meme,\u201d in which the character Milhouse (from the television show The Simpsons) is\ntold that he is not a meme. Chronicling memes is notoriously difficult, because they typically spring into\nexistence seemingly overnight, propagate rapidly, and disappear before ever making it onto the radar of\nmainstream media\u2014or even the mainstream Internet user.\nBenefits and Problems of Social Media\nSocial media allows an unprecedented volume of personal, informal communication in real time from\nanywhere in the world. It allows users to keep in touch with friends on other continents, yet keeps the\nconversation as casual as a Facebook wall post. In addition, blogs allow us to gauge a wide variety of\nopinions and have given \u201cbreaking news\u201d a whole new meaning. Now, news can be distributed through\nmany major outlets almost instantaneously, and different perspectives on any one event can be aired\nconcurrently. In addition, news organizations can harness bloggers as sources of real-time news, in effect\noutsourcing some of their news-gathering efforts to bystanders on the scene. This practice of harnessing\nthe efforts of several individuals online to solve a problem is known as crowdsourcing.\nThe downside of the seemingly infinite breadth of online information is that there is often not much depth\nto the coverage of any given topic. The superficiality of information on the Internet is a common gripe\namong many journalists who are now rushed to file news reports several times a day in an effort to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n498 complete with the \u201cblogosphere,\u201d or the crowd of bloggers who post both original news stories and\naggregate previously published news from other sources. Whereas traditional print organizations at least\nhad the \u201cluxury\u201d of the daily print deadline, now journalists are expected to blog or tweet every story and\nfile reports with little or no analysis, often without adequate time to confirm the reliability of their\nsources. [7]\nAdditionally, news aggregators like Google News profit from linking to journalists\u2019 stories at major\nnewspapers and selling advertising, but these profits are not shared with the news organizations and\njournalists who created the stories. It is often difficult for journalists to keep up with the immediacy of the\nnonstop news cycle, and with revenues for their efforts being diverted to news aggregators, journalists and\nnews organizations increasingly lack the resources to keep up this fast pace. Twitter presents a similar\nproblem: Instead of getting news from a specific newspaper, many people simply read the articles that are\nlinked from a Twitter feed. As a result, the news cycle leaves journalists no time for analysis or cross-\nexamination. Increasingly, they will simply report, for example, on what a politician or public relations\nrepresentative says without following up on these comments or fact-checking them. This further shortens\nthe news cycle and makes it much easier for journalists to be exploited as the mouthpieces of propaganda.\nConsequently, the very presence of blogs and their seeming importance even among mainstream media\nhas made some critics wary. Internet entrepreneur Andrew Keen is one of these people, and his book The\nCult of the Amateur follows up on the famous thought experiment suggesting that infinite monkeys, given\ninfinite typewriters, will one day randomly produce a great work of literature: [8] \u201cIn our Web 2.0 world,\nthe typewriters aren\u2019t quite typewriters, but rather networked personal computers, and the monkeys\naren\u2019t quite monkeys, but rather Internet users.\u201d [9] Keen also suggests that the Internet is really just a case\nof my-word-against-yours, where bloggers are not required to back up their arguments\nwith credible sources. \u201cThese days, kids can\u2019t tell the difference between credible news by objective\nprofessional journalists and what they read on [a random website].\u201d [10] Commentators like Keen worry\nthat this trend will lead to young people\u2019s inability to distinguish credible information from a mass of\nsources, eventually leading to a sharp decrease in credible sources of information.\nFor defenders of the Internet, this argument seems a bit overwrought: \u201cA legitimate interest in the\npossible effects of significant technological change in our daily lives can inadvertently dovetail seamlessly\ninto a \u2018kids these days\u2019 curmudgeonly sense of generational degeneration, which is hardly new.\u201d [11]Greg\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n499 Downey, who runs the collaborative blog Neuroanthropology, says that fear of kids on the Internet\u2014and\non social media in particular\u2014can slip into \u201ca \u2018one-paranoia-fits-all\u2019 approach to technological change.\u201d\nFor the argument that online experiences are \u201cdevoid of cohesive narrative and long-term significance,\u201d\nDowney offers that, on the contrary, \u201cfar from evacuating narrative, some social networking sites might be\nsaid to cause users to \u2018narrativize\u2019 their experience, engaging with everyday life already with an eye toward\nhow they will represent it on their personal pages.\u201d\nAnother argument in favor of social media defies the warning that time spent on social networking sites is\ndestroying the social skills of young people. \u201cThe debasement of the word \u2018friend\u2019 by [Facebook\u2019s] use of it\nshould not make us assume that users can\u2019t tell the difference between friends and Facebook \u2018friends,\u2019\u201d\nwrites Downey. On the contrary, social networks (like the Usenet of the past) can even provide a place for\npeople with more obscure interests to meet one another and share commonalities. In addition, marketing\nthrough social media is completely free\u2014making it a valuable tool for small businesses with tight\nmarketing budgets. A community theater can invite all of its \u201cfans\u201d to a new play for less money than\nputting an ad in the newspaper, and this direct invitation is far more personal and specific. Many people\nsee services like Twitter, with its \u201cfollowers,\u201d as more semantically appropriate than the \u201cfriends\u201d found\non Facebook and MySpace, and because of this Twitter has, in many ways, changed yet again the way\nsocial media is conceived. Rather than connecting with \u201cfriends,\u201d Twitter allows social media to be purely\na source of information, thereby making it far more appealing to adults. In addition, while 140 characters\nmay seem like a constraint to some, it can be remarkably useful to the time-strapped user looking to catch\nup on recent news.\nSocial media\u2019s detractors also point to the sheer banality of much of the conversation on the Internet.\nAgain, Downey keeps this in perspective: \u201cThe banality of most conversation is also pretty frustrating,\u201d he\nsays. Downey suggests that many of the young people using social networking tools see them as just\nanother aspect of communication. However, Downey warns that online bullying has the potential to\npervade larger social networks while shielding perpetrators through anonymity.\nAnother downside of many of the Internet\u2019s segmented communities is that users tend to be exposed only\nto information they are interested in and opinions they agree with. This lack of exposure to novel ideas\nand contrary opinions can create or reinforce a lack of understanding among people with different beliefs,\nand make political and social compromise more difficult to come by.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n500 While the situation may not be as dire as Keen suggests in his book, there are clearly some important\narguments to consider regarding the effects of the web and social media in particular. The main concerns\ncome down to two things: the possibility that the volume of amateur, user-generated content online is\novershadowing better-researched sources, and the questionable ability of users to tell the difference\nbetween the two.\nEducation, the Internet, and Social Media\nAlthough Facebook began at Harvard University and quickly became popular among the Ivy League\ncolleges, the social network has since been lambasted as a distraction for students. Instead of studying,\nthe argument claims, students will sit in the library and browse Facebook, messaging their friends and\ngetting nothing done. Two doctoral candidates, Aryn Karpinski (Ohio State University) and Adam\nDuberstein (Ohio Dominican University), studied the effects of Facebook use on college students and\nfound that students who use Facebook generally receive a full grade lower\u2014a half point on the GPA\nscale\u2014than students who do not. [12] Correlation does not imply causation, though, as Karpinski said that\nFacebook users may just be \u201cprone to distraction.\u201d\nOn the other hand, students\u2019 access to technology and the Internet may allow them to pursue their\neducation to a greater degree than they could otherwise. At a school in Arizona, students are issued\nlaptops instead of textbooks, and some of their school buses have Wi-Fi Internet access. As a result, bus\nrides, including the long trips that are often a requirement of high school sports, are spent studying. Of\ncourse, the students had laptops long before their bus rides were connected to the Internet, but the Wi-Fi\ntechnology has \u201ctransformed what was often a boisterous bus ride into a rolling study hall.\u201d [13] Even\nthough not all students studied all the time, enabling students to work on bus rides fulfilled the school\u2019s\ngoal of extending the educational hours beyond the usual 8 to 3.\nPrivacy Issues With Social Networking\nSocial networking provides unprecedented ways to keep in touch with friends, but that ability can\nsometimes be a double-edged sword. Users can update friends with every latest achievement\u2014\u201c[your\nname here] just won three straight games of solitaire!\u201d\u2014but may also unwittingly be updating bosses and\nothers from whom particular bits of information should be hidden.\nThe shrinking of privacy online has been rapidly exacerbated by social networks, and for a surprising\nreason: conscious decisions made by participants. Putting personal information online\u2014even if it is set to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n501 be viewed by only select friends\u2014has become fairly standard. Dr. Kieron O\u2019Hara studies privacy in social\nmedia and calls this era \u201cintimacy 2.0,\u201d [14] a riff on the buzzword \u201cWeb 2.0.\u201d One of O\u2019Hara\u2019s arguments is\nthat legal issues of privacy are based on what is called a \u201creasonable standard.\u201d According to O\u2019Hara, the\nexcessive sharing of personal information on the Internet by some constitutes an offense to the privacy\nof all, because it lowers the \u201creasonable standard\u201d that can be legally enforced. In other words, as cultural\ntendencies toward privacy degrade on the Internet, it affects not only the privacy of those who choose to\nshare their information, but also the privacy of those who do not.\nPrivacy Settings on Facebook\nWith over 500 million users, it is no surprise that Facebook is one of the upcoming battlegrounds for\nprivacy on the Internet. When Facebook updated its privacy settings in 2009 for these people, \u201cprivacy\ngroups including the American Civil Liberties Union \u2026 [called] the developments \u2018flawed\u2019 and\n\u2018worrisome,\u2019\u201d reported The Guardian in late 2009. [15]\nMark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, discusses privacy issues on a regular basis in forums ranging\nfrom his official Facebook blog to conferences. At the Crunchies Awards in San Francisco in early 2010,\nZuckerberg claimed that privacy was no longer a \u201csocial norm.\u201d [16] This statement follows from his\ncompany\u2019s late-2009 decision to make public information sharing the default setting on Facebook.\nWhereas users were previously able to restrict public access to basic profile information like their names\nand friends, the new settings make this information publicly available with no option to make it private.\nAlthough Facebook publicly announced the changes, many outraged users first learned of the updates to\nthe default privacy settings when they discovered\u2014too late\u2014that they had inadvertently broadcast private\ninformation. Facebook argues that the added complexity of the privacy settings gives users more control\nover their information. However, opponents counter that adding more complex privacy controls while\nsimultaneously making public sharing the default setting for those controls is a blatant ploy to push casual\nusers into sharing more of their information publicly\u2014information that Facebook will then use to offer\nmore targeted advertising. [17]\nIn response to the privacy policy, many users have formed their own grassroots protest groups within\nFacebook. In response to critiques, Facebook changed its privacy policy again in May 2010 with three\nprimary changes. First, privacy controls are simpler. Instead of various controls on multiple pages, there\nis now one main control users can use to determine who can see their information. Second, Facebook\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n502 made less information publicly available. Public information is now limited to basic information, such as a\nuser\u2019s name and profile picture. Finally, it is now easier to block applications and third-party websites\nfrom accessing user information. [18]\nSimilar to the Facebook controversy, Google\u2019s social networking Gmail add-on called Buzz automatically\nsigned up Gmail users to \u201cfollow\u201d the most emailed Gmail users in their address book. Because all of these\nlists were public by default, users\u2019 most emailed contacts were made available for anyone to see. This was\nespecially alarming for people like journalists who potentially had confidential sources exposed to a public\naudience. However, even though this mistake\u2014which Google quickly corrected\u2014created a lot of\ncontroversy around Buzz, it did not stop users from creating over 9 million posts in the first 2 days of the\nservice. [19] Google\u2019s integration of Buzz into its Gmail service may have been upsetting to users not\naccustomed to the pitfalls of social networking, but Google\u2019s misstep has not discouraged millions of\nothers from trying the service, perhaps due to their experience dealing with Facebook\u2019s ongoing issues\nwith privacy infringement.\nFor example, Facebook\u2019s old privacy settings integrated a collection of applications (written by third-party\ndevelopers) that included everything from \u201cWhich American Idol Contestant Are You?\u201d to an \u201cHonesty\nBox\u201d that allows friends to send anonymous criticism. \u201cAllowing Honesty Box access will let it pull your\nprofile information, photos, your friends\u2019 info, and other content that it requires to work,\u201d reads the\ndisclaimer on the application installation page. The ACLU drew particular attention to the \u201capp gap\u201d that\nallowed \u201cany quiz or application run by you to access information about you and your friends.\u201d [20] In other\nwords, merely using someone else\u2019s Honesty Box gave the program information about your \u201creligion,\nsexual orientation, political affiliation, pictures, and groups.\u201d [21] There are many reasons that unrelated\napplications may want to collect this information, but one of the most prominent is, by now, a very old\nstory: selling products. The more information a marketer has, the better he or she can target a message,\nand the more likely it is that the recipient will buy something.\nFigure 11.6\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n503 Zynga, one of the top social game developers on Facebook, created the game FarmVille.\nBecause FarmVille is ad-supported and gives users the option to purchase Farmville virtual\ncurrency with actual money, the game is free and accessible for everyone to play.\nSocial Media\u2019s Effect on Commerce\nSocial media on the Internet has been around for a while, and it has always been of some interest to\nmarketers. The ability to target advertising based on demographic information given willingly to the\nservice\u2014age, political preference, gender, and location\u2014allows marketers to target advertising extremely\nefficiently. However, by the time Facebook\u2019s population passed the 350-million mark, marketers were\nscrambling to harness social media. The increasingly difficult-to-reach younger demographic has been\nrejecting radios for Apple\u2019s iPod mobile digital devices and television for YouTube. Increasingly,\nmarketers are turning to social networks as a way to reach these consumers. Culturally, these\ndevelopments indicate a mistrust among consumers of traditional marketing techniques; marketers must\nnow use new and more personalized ways of reaching consumers if they are going to sell their products.\nThe attempts of marketers to harness the viral spread of media on the Internet have already been\ndiscussed earlier in the chapter. Marketers try to determine the trend of things \u201cgoing viral,\u201d with the goal\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n504 of getting millions of YouTube views; becoming a hot topic on Google Trends, a website that measures the\nmost frequently searched topics on the web; or even just being the subject of a post on a well-known blog.\nFor example, Procter & Gamble sent free samples of its Swiffer dust mop to stay-at-home-mom bloggers\nwith a large online audience. And in 2008, the movie College (or College: The Movie) used its tagline\n\u201cBest.Weekend.Ever.\u201d as the prompt for a YouTube video contest. Contestants were invited to submit\nvideos of their best college weekend ever, and the winner received a monetary prize. [22]\nWhat these two instances of marketing have in common is that they approach people who are already\ndoing something they enjoy doing\u2014blogging or making movies\u2014and give them a relatively small amount\nof compensation for providing advertising. This differs from methods of traditional advertising because\nmarketers seek to bridge a credibility gap with consumers. Marketers have been doing this for ages\u2014 long\nbefore breakfast cereal slogans like \u201cKid Tested, Mother Approved\u201d or \u201cMikey likes it\u201d ever hit the\nairwaves. The difference is that now the people pushing the products can be friends or family members,\nall via social networks.\nFor instance, in 2007, a program called Beacon was launched as part of Facebook. With Beacon, a\nFacebook user is confronted with the option to \u201cshare\u201d an online purchase from partnering sites. For\nexample, a user might buy a book from Amazon.com and check the corresponding \u201cshare\u201d box in the\ncheckout process, and all of his or her friends will receive a message notifying them that this person\npurchased and recommends this particular product. Explaining the reason for this shift in a New York\nTimes article, Mark Zuckerberg said, \u201cNothing influences a person more than a trusted\nfriend.\u201d [23]However, many Facebook users did not want their purchasing information shared with other\nFacebookers, and the service was shut down in 2009 and subsequently became the subject of a class\naction lawsuit. Facebook\u2019s troubles with Beacon illustrate the thin line between taking advantage of the\ntremendous marketing potential of social media and violating the privacy of users.\nFacebook\u2019s questionable alliance with marketers through Beacon was driven by a need to create reliable\nrevenue streams. One of the most crucial aspects of social media is the profitability factor. In the\n1990s, theGlobe.com was one of the promising new startups, but almost as quickly, it went under due to\nlack of funds. The lesson of theGlobe.com has not gone unheeded by today\u2019s social media services. For\nexample, Twitter has sold access to its content to Google and Microsoft to make users\u2019 tweets searchable\nfor $25 million.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n505 Google\u2019s Buzz is one of the most interesting services in this respect, because Google\u2019s main business is\nadvertising\u2014and it is a highly successful business. Google\u2019s search algorithms allow it to target advertising\nto a user\u2019s specific tastes. As Google enters the social media world, its advertising capabilities will only be\ncompounded as users reveal more information about themselves via Buzz. Although it does not seem that\nusers choose their social media services based on how the services generate their revenue streams, the\nissue of privacy in social media is in large part an issue of how much information users are willing to share\nwith advertisers. For example, using Google\u2019s search engine, Buzz, Gmail, and Blogger give that single\ncompany an immense amount of information and a historically unsurpassed ability to market to specific\ngroups. At this relatively early stage of the fledgling online social media business\u2014both Twitter and\nFacebook only very recently turned a profit, so commerce has only recently come into play\u2014it is\nimpossible to say whether the commerce side of things will transform the way people use the services. If\nthe uproar over Facebook\u2019s Beacon is any lesson, however, the relationship between social media and\nadvertising is ripe for controversy.\nSocial Media as a Tool for Social Change\nThe use of Facebook and Twitter in the recent political uprisings in the Middle East has brought to the\nfore the question whether social media can be an effective tool for social change.\nOn January 14, 2011, after month-long protests against fraud, economic crisis, and lack of political\nfreedom, the Tunisian public ousted President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Soon after the Tunisian rebellion,\nthe Egyptian public expelled President Hosni Mubarak, who had ruled the country for 30 years. Nearly\nimmediately, other Middle Eastern countries such as Algeria, Libya, Yemen, and Bahrain also erupted\nagainst their oppressive governments in the hopes of obtaining political freedom. [24]\nWhat is common among all these uprisings is the role played by social media. In nearly all of these\ncountries, restrictions were imposed on the media and government resistance was brutally\ndiscouraged. [25] This seems to have inspired the entire Middle East to organize online to rebel against\ntyrannical rule. [26] Protesters used social media not only to organize against their governments but also to\nshare their struggles with the rest of the world. [27]\nIn Tunisia, protesters filled the streets by sharing information on Twitter.[28] Egypt\u2019s protests were\norganized on Facebook pages. Details of the demonstrations were circulated by both Facebook and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n506 Twitter. email was used to distribute the activists\u2019 guide to challenging the regime. [29] Libyan dissenters\ntoo spread the word about their demonstrations similarly. [30]\nOwing to the role played by Twitter and Facebook in helping protesters organize and communicate with\neach other, many have termed these rebellions as \u201cTwitter Revolutions\u201d [31] or \u201cFacebook\nRevolutions\u201d [32] and have credited social media for helping to bring down these regimes. [33]\nDuring the unrest, social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter helped protesters share information\nby communicating ideas continuously and instantaneously. Users took advantage of these unrestricted\nvehicles to share the most graphic details and images of the attacks on protesters, and to rally\ndemonstrators. [34] In other words, use of social media was about the ability to communicate across\nborders and barriers. It gave common people a voice and an opportunity to express their opinions.\nCritics of social media, however, say that those calling the Middle East movements Facebook or Twitter\nrevolutions are not giving credit where it is due. [35] It is true that social media provided vital assistance\nduring the unrest in the Middle East. But technology alone could not have brought about the revolutions.\nThe resolve of the people to bring about change was most important, and this fact should be recognized,\nsay the critics. [36]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Social networking sites often encompass many aspects of other social media. For example, Facebook\nbegan as a collection of profile pictures with very little information, but soon expanded to include photo\nalbums (like Flickr) and micro-blogging (like Twitter). Other sites, like MySpace, emphasize connections to\nmusic and customizable pages, catering to a younger demographic. LinkedIn specifically caters to a\nprofessional demographic by allowing only certain kinds of information that is professionally relevant.\n\uf0b7 Blogs speed the flow of information around the Internet and provide a critical way for nonprofessionals\nwith adequate time to investigate sources and news stories without the necessary platform of a well-\nknown publication. On the other hand, they can lead to an \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect, where they simply\nrepeat one another and add nothing new. Often, the analysis is wide ranging, but it can also be shallow\nand lack the depth and knowledge of good critical journalism.\n\uf0b7 Facebook has been the leader in privacy-related controversy, with its seemingly constant issues with\nprivacy settings. One of the critical things to keep in mind is that as more people become comfortable\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n507 with more information out in the open, the \u201creasonable standard\u201d of privacy is lowered. This affects even\npeople who would rather keep more things private.\n\uf0b7 Social networking allows marketers to reach consumers directly and to know more about each specific\nconsumer than ever before. Search algorithms allow marketers to place advertisements in areas that get\nthe most traffic from targeted consumers. Whereas putting an ad on TV reaches all demographics, online\nadvertisements can now be targeted specifically to different groups.\nEXERCISES\n1.

Describe the effects of globalization on culture.\n2. Identify the possible effects of news migrating to the Internet.\n3. Define the Internet paradox.\nIt\u2019s in the name: World Wide Web. The Internet has broken down communication barriers between\ncultures in a way that could only be dreamed of in earlier generations. Now, almost any news service\nacross the globe can be accessed on the Internet and, with the various translation services available\n(like Babelfish and Google Translate), be relatively understandable. In addition to the spread of\nAmerican culture throughout the world, smaller countries are now able to cheaply export culture,\nnews, entertainment, and even propaganda.\nThe Internet has been a key factor in driving globalization in recent years. Many jobs can now be\noutsourced entirely via the Internet. Teams of software programmers in India can have a website up\nand running in very little time, for far less money than it would take to hire American counterparts.\nCommunicating with these teams is now as simple as sending emails and instant messages back and\nforth, and often the most difficult aspect of setting up an international video conference online is\nfiguring out the time difference. Especially for electronic services such as software, outsourcing over\nthe Internet has greatly reduced the cost to develop a professionally coded site.\nElectronic Media and the Globalization of Culture\nThe increase of globalization has been an economic force throughout the last century, but economic\ninterdependency is not its only by-product. At its core, globalization is the lowering of economic and\ncultural impediments to communication between countries all over the globe. Globalization in the sphere\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n511 of culture and communication can take the form of access to foreign newspapers (without the difficulty of\nprocuring a printed copy) or, conversely, the ability of people living in previously closed countries to\ncommunicate experiences to the outside world relatively cheaply.\nTelevision, especially satellite television, has been one of the primary ways for American entertainment to\nreach foreign shores. This trend has been going on for some time now, for example, with the launch of\nMTV Arabia. [1] American popular culture is, and has been, a crucial export.\nAt the Eisenhower Fellowship Conference in Singapore in 2005, U.S. ambassador Frank Lavin gave a\ndefense of American culture that differed somewhat from previous arguments. It would not be all\nStarbucks, MTV, or Baywatch, he said, because American culture is more diverse than that. Instead, he\nsaid that \u201cAmerica is a nation of immigrants,\u201d and asked, \u201cWhen Mel Gibson or Jackie Chan come to the\nUnited States to produce a movie, whose culture is being exported?\u201d [2] This idea of a truly globalized\nculture\u2014one in which content can be distributed as easily as it can be received\u2014now has the potential to\nbe realized through the Internet. While some political and social barriers still remain, from a\ntechnological standpoint there is nothing to stop the two-way flow of information and culture across the\nglobe.\nChina, Globalization, and the Internet\nThe scarcity of artistic resources, the time lag of transmission to a foreign country, and censorship by the\nhost government are a few of the possible impediments to transmission of entertainment and culture.\nChina provides a valuable example of the ways the Internet has helped to overcome (or highlight) all three\nof these hurdles.\nChina, as the world\u2019s most populous country and one of its leading economic powers, has considerable\nclout when it comes to the Internet. In addition, the country is ruled by a single political party that uses\ncensorship extensively in an effort to maintain control. Because the Internet is an open resource by\nnature, and because China is an extremely well-connected country\u2014with 22.5 percent (roughly 300\nmillion people, or the population of the entire United States) of the country online as of 2008 [3]\u2014China\nhas been a case study in how the Internet makes resistance to globalization increasingly difficult.\nFigure 11.7\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n512 China has more Internet users than any other country.\nOn January 21, 2010, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in front of the Newseum in Washington, DC, where\nshe said, \u201cWe stand for a single Internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and\nideas.\u201d [4] That same month, Google decided it would stop censoring search results on Google.cn, its\nChinese-language search engine, as a result of a serious cyber-attack on the company originating in China.\nIn addition, Google stated that if an agreement with the Chinese government could not be reached over\nthe censorship of search results, Google would pull out of China completely. Because Google has complied\n(albeit uneasily) with the Chinese government in the past, this change in policy was a major reversal.\nWithdrawing from one of the largest expanding markets in the world is shocking coming from a company\nthat has been aggressively expanding into foreign markets. This move highlights the fundamental tension\nbetween China\u2019s censorship policy and Google\u2019s core values. Google\u2019s company motto, \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d had\nlong been at odds with its decision to censor search results in China. Google\u2019s compliance with the\nChinese government did not help it make inroads into the Chinese Internet search market\u2014although\nGoogle held about a quarter of the market in China, most of the search traffic went to the tightly\ncontrolled Chinese search engine Baidu. However, Google\u2019s departure from China would be a blow to anti-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n513 government forces in the country. Since Baidu has a closer relationship with the Chinese government,\npolitical dissidents tend to use Google\u2019s Gmail, which uses encrypted servers based in the United States.\nGoogle\u2019s threat to withdraw from China raises the possibility that globalization could indeed hit\nroadblocks due to the ways that foreign governments may choose to censor the Internet.\nNew Media: Internet Convergence and American Society\nOne only needs to go to CNN\u2019s offical Twitter feed and begin to click random faces in the \u201cFollowing\u201d\ncolumn to see the effect of media convergence through the Internet. Hundreds of different options\nabound, many of them individual journalists\u2019 Twitter feeds, and many of those following other journalists.\nConsidering CNN\u2019s motto, \u201cThe most trusted name in network news,\u201d its presence on Twitter might seem\nat odds with providing in-depth, reliable coverage. After all, how in-depth can 140 characters get?\nThe truth is that many of these traditional media outlets use Twitter not as a communication tool in itself\nbut as a way to allow viewers to aggregate a large amount of information they may have missed. Instead of\nvisiting multiple home pages to see the day\u2019s top stories from multiple viewpoints, Twitter users only have\nto check their own Twitter pages to get updates from all the organizations they\n\u201cfollow.\u201d Media conglomerates then use Twitter as part of an overall integration of media outlets; the\nTwitter feed is there to support the news content, not to report the content itself.\nInternet-Only Sources\nThe threshold was crossed in 2008: The Internet overtook print media as a primary source of information\nfor national and international news in the United States. Television is still far in the lead, but especially\namong younger demographics, the Internet is quickly catching up as a way to learn about the day\u2019s news.\nWith 40 percent of the public receiving their news from the Internet (see Figure 11.8), [5] media outlets\nhave been scrambling to set up large presences on the web. Yet one of the most remarkable shifts has been\nin the establishment of online-only news sources.\nFigure 11.8\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n514 Americans now receive more national and international news from the Internet than they do from\nnewspapers.\nThe conventional argument claims that the anonymity and the echo chamber of the Internet undermine\nworthwhile news reporting, especially for topics that are expensive to report on. The ability of large news\norganizations to put reporters in the field is one of their most important contributions and (because of its\ncost) is often one of the first things to be cut back during times of budget problems. However, as the\nInternet has become a primary news source for more and more people, new media outlets\u2014publications\nexisting entirely online\u2014have begun to appear.\nIn 2006, two reporters for the Washington Post, John F. Harris and Jim VandeHei, left the newspaper to\nstart a politically centered website called Politico. Rather than simply repeating the day\u2019s news in a blog,\nthey were determined to start a journalistically viable news organization on the web. Four years later, the\nsite has over 6,000,000 unique monthly visitors and about a hundred staff members, and there is now a\nPolitico reporter on almost every White House trip. [6]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n515 Far from being a collection of amateurs trying to make it big on the Internet, Politico\u2019s senior White\nHouse correspondent is Mike Allen, who previously wrote for The New York Times, Washington Post,\nand Time. His daily Playbook column appears at around 7 a.m. each morning and is read by much of the\npolitically centered media. The different ways that Politico reaches out to its supporters\u2014blogs, Twitter\nfeeds, regular news articles, and now even a print edition\u2014show how media convergence has even\noccurred within the Internet itself. The interactive nature of its services and the active comment boards on\nthe site also show how the media have become a two-way street: more of a public forum than a straight\nnews service.\n\u201cLive\u201d From New York \u2026\nTop-notch political content is not the only medium moving to the Internet, however. Saturday Night\nLive (SNL) has built an entire entertainment model around its broadcast time slot. Every weekend,\naround 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, someone interrupts a skit, turns toward the camera, shouts \u201cLive from\nNew York, it\u2019s Saturday Night!\u201d and the band starts playing. Yet the show\u2019s sketch comedy style also\nseems to lend itself to the watch-anytime convenience of the Internet. In fact, the online television service\nHulu carries a full eight episodes of SNL at any given time, with regular 3.5-minute commercial breaks\nreplaced by Hulu-specific minute-long advertisements. The time listed for an SNL episode on Hulu is just\nover an hour\u2014a full half-hour less than the time it takes to watch it live on Saturday night.\nHulu calls its product \u201conline premium video,\u201d primarily because of its desire to attract not the YouTube\namateur but rather a partnership of large media organizations. Although many networks, like NBC and\nComedy Central, stream video on their websites, Hulu builds its business by offering a legal way to see all\nthese shows on the same site; a user can switch from South Park to SNL with a single click, rather than\nhaving to move to a different website.\nPremium Online Video Content\nHulu\u2019s success points to a high demand among Internet users for a wide variety of content collected and\npackaged in one easy-to-use interface. Hulu was rated the Website of the Year by the Associated\nPress [7] and even received an Emmy nomination for a commercial featuring Alec Baldwin and Tina Fey,\nthe stars of the NBC comedy 30 Rock. [8] Hulu\u2019s success has not been the product of the usual dot-com\nunderdog startup, however. Its two parent companies, News Corporation and NBC Universal, are two of\nthe world\u2019s media giants. In many ways, this was a logical step for these companies to take after fighting\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n516 online video for so long. In December 2005, the video \u201cLazy Sunday,\u201d an SNL digital short featuring Andy\nSamberg and Chris Parnell, went viral with over 5,000,000 views on YouTube before February 2006,\nwhen NBC demanded that YouTube take down the video. [9] NBC later posted the video on Hulu, where it\ncould sell advertising for it.\nHulu allows users to break out of programming models controlled by broadcast and cable television\nproviders and choose freely what shows to watch and when to watch them. This seems to work especially\nwell for cult programs that are no longer available on television. In 2008, the show Arrested\nDevelopment, which was canceled in 2006 after repeated time slot shifts, was Hulu\u2019s second-most-\npopular program.\nHulu certainly seems to have leveled the playing field for some shows that have had difficulty finding an\naudience through traditional means. 30 Rock, much like Arrested Development, suffered from a lack of\nviewers in its early years. In 2008, New York Magazine described the show as a \u201cfragile suckling that\ncritics coddle but that America never quite warms up to.\u201d [10] However, even as 30 Rock shifted time slots\nmid-season, its viewer base continued to grow through the NBC partner of Hulu. The nontraditional\nmedia approach of NBC\u2019s programming culminated in October 2008, when NBC decided to launch the\nnew season of 30 Rock on Hulu a full week before it was broadcast over the airwaves.[11] Hulu\u2019s strategy of\nproviding premium online content seems to have paid off: As of March 2011, Hulu provided 143,673,000\nviewing sessions to more than 27 million unique visitors, according to Nielsen. [12]\nUnlike other \u201cpremium\u201d services, Hulu does not charge for its content; rather, the word premium in its\nslogan seems to imply that it could charge for content if it wanted to. Other platforms, like Sony\u2019s\nPlayStation 3, block Hulu for this very reason\u2014Sony\u2019s online store sells the products that Hulu gives away\nfor free. However, Hulu has been considering moving to a paid subscription model that would allow users\nto access its entire back catalog of shows. Like many other fledgling web enterprises, Hulu seeks to create\nreliable revenue streams to avoid the fate of many of the companies that folded during the dot-com\ncrash. [13]\nLike Politico, Hulu has packaged professionally produced content into an on-demand web service that can\nbe used without the normal constraints of traditional media. Just as users can comment on Politico\narticles (and now, on most newspapers\u2019 articles), they can rate Hulu videos, and Hulu will take this into\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n517 account. Even when users do not produce the content themselves, they still want this same \u201ctwo-way\nstreet\u201d service.\nTable 11.2 Top 10 U.S. Online Video Brands, Home and Work\nRank Parent Total Streams (in millions) Unique Viewers (in millions)\n1 YouTube 6,622,374 112,642\n2 Hulu 635,546 15,256\n3 Yahoo! 221,355 26,081\n4 MSN 179,741 15,645\n5 Turner 137,311 5,343\n6 MTV Networks 131,077 5,949\n7 ABC TV 128,510 5,049\n8 Fox Interactive 124,513 11,450\n9 Nickelodeon 117,057 5,004\n10 Megavideo 115,089 3,654\nSource: The Nielsen Company\nThe Role of the Internet in Social Alienation\nIn the early years, the Internet was stigmatized as a tool for introverts to avoid \u201creal\u201d social interactions,\nthereby increasing their alienation from society. Yet the Internet was also seen as the potentially great\nconnecting force between cultures all over the world. The idea that something that allowed\ncommunication across the globe could breed social alienation seemed counterintuitive. The American\nPsychological Association (APA) coined this concept the \u201cInternet paradox.\u201d\nStudies like the APA\u2019s \u201cInternet paradox: A social technology that reduces social involvement and\npsychological well-being?\u201d [14] which came out in 1998, suggested that teens who spent lots of time on the\nInternet showed much greater rates of self-reported loneliness and other signs of psychological distress.\nEven though the Internet had been around for a while by 1998, the increasing concern among parents was\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n518 that teenagers were spending all their time in chat rooms and online. The fact was that teenagers spent\nmuch more time on the Internet than adults, due to their increased free time, curiosity, and familiarity\nwith technology.\nHowever, this did not necessarily mean that \u201ckids these days\u201d were antisocial or that the Internet caused\ndepression and loneliness. In his critical analysis \u201cDeconstructing the Internet Paradox,\u201d computer\nscientist, writer, and PhD recipient from Carnegie Mellon University Joseph M. Newcomer points out that\nthe APA study did not include a control group to adjust for what may be normal \u201clonely\u201d feelings in\nteenagers. Again, he suggests that \u201cinvolvement in any new, self-absorbing activity which has opportunity\nfor failure can increase depression,\u201d seeing Internet use as just another time-consuming hobby, much like\nlearning a musical instrument or playing chess. [15]\nThe general concept that teenagers were spending all their time in chat rooms and online forums instead\nof hanging out with flesh-and-blood friends was not especially new; the same thing had generally been\nthought of the computer hobbyists who pioneered the esoteric Usenet. However, the concerns were\namplified when a wider range of young people began using the Internet, and the trend was especially\nstrong in the younger demographics.\nThe \u201cInternet Paradox\u201d and Facebook\nAs they developed, it became quickly apparent that the Internet generation did not suffer from perpetual\nloneliness as a rule. After all, the generation that was raised on instant messaging invented Facebook and\nstill makes up most of Facebook\u2019s audience. As detailed earlier in the chapter, Facebook began as a service\nlimited to college students\u2014a requirement that practically excluded older participants. As a social tool and\nas a reflection of the way younger people now connect with each other over the Internet, Facebook has\nprovided a comprehensive model for the Internet\u2019s effect on social skills and especially on education.\nA study by the Michigan State University Department of Telecommunication, Information Studies, and\nMedia has shown that college-age Facebook users connect with offline friends twice as often as they\nconnect with purely online \u201cfriends.\u201d [16] In fact, 90 percent of the participants in the study reported that\nhigh school friends, classmates, and other friends were the top three groups that their Facebook profiles\nwere directed toward.\nIn 2007, when this study took place, one of Facebook\u2019s most remarkable tools for studying the ways that\nyoung people connect was its \u201cnetworks\u201d feature. Originally, a Facebook user\u2019s network consisted of all\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n519 the people at his or her college email domain: the \u201cmycollege\u201d portion of \u201cme@mycollege.edu.\u201d The MSU\nstudy, performed in April 2006, just 6 months after Facebook opened its doors to high school students,\nfound that first-year students met new people on Facebook 36 percent more often than seniors did. These\nfreshmen, in April 2006, were not as active on Facebook as high schoolers (Facebook began allowing high\nschoolers on its site during these students\u2019 first semester in school). [17] The study concluded that they\ncould \u201cdefinitively state that there is a positive relationship between certain kinds of Facebook use and the\nmaintenance and creation of social capital.\u201d [18] In other words, even though the study cannot show\nwhether Facebook use causes or results from social connections, it can say that Facebook plays both an\nimportant and a nondestructive role in the forming of social bonds.\nAlthough this study provides a complete and balanced picture of the role that Facebook played for college\nstudents in early 2006, there have been many changes in Facebook\u2019s design and in its popularity. In 2006,\nmany of a user\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d were from the same college, and the whole college network might be mapped as\na \u201cfriend-of-a-friend\u201d web. If users allowed all people within a single network access to their profiles, it\nwould create a voluntary school-wide directory of students. Since a university email address was required\nfor signup, there was a certain level of trust. The results of this Facebook study, still relatively current in\nterms of showing the Internet\u2019s effects on social capital, show that not only do social networking\ntools not lead to more isolation, but that they actually have become integral to some types of networking.\nHowever, as Facebook began to grow and as high school and regional networks (such as \u201cNew York City\u201d\nor \u201cIreland\u201d) were incorporated, users\u2019 networks of friends grew exponentially, and the networking\nfeature became increasingly unwieldy for privacy purposes. In 2009, Facebook discontinued regional\nnetworks over concerns that networks consisting of millions of people were \u201cno longer the best way for\nyou to control your privacy.\u201d [19] Where privacy controls once consisted of allowing everyone at one\u2019s\ncollege access to specific information, Facebook now allows only three levels: friends, friends of friends,\nand everyone.\nMeetup.com: Meeting Up \u201cIRL\u201d\nOf course, not everyone on teenagers\u2019 online friends lists are actually their friends outside of the virtual\nworld. In the parlance of the early days of the Internet, meeting up \u201cIRL\u201d (shorthand for \u201cin real life\u201d) was\none of the main reasons that many people got online. This practice was often looked at with suspicion by\nthose not familiar with it, especially because of the anonymity of the Internet. The fear among many was\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n520 that children would go into chat rooms and agree to meet up in person with a total stranger, and that\nstranger would turn out to have less-than-friendly motives. This fear led to law enforcement officers\nposing as underage girls in chat rooms, agreeing to meet for sex with older men (after the men brought up\nthe topic\u2014the other way around could be considered entrapment), and then arresting the men at the\nagreed-upon meeting spot.\nIn recent years, however, the Internet has become a hub of activity for all sorts of people. In 2002, Scott\nHeiferman started Meetup.com based on the \u201csimple idea of using the Internet to get people off the\nInternet.\u201d [20] The entire purpose of Meetup.com is not to foster global interaction and collaboration (as is\nthe purpose of something like Usenet) but rather to allow people to organize locally. There are Meetups\nfor politics (popular during Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign), for New Yorkers who own Boston\nterriers, [21] for vegan cooking, for board games, and for practically everything else. Essentially, the service\n(which charges a small fee to Meetup organizers) separates itself from other social networking sites by\nencouraging real-life interaction. Whereas a member of a Facebook group may never see or interact with\nfellow members, Meetup.com actually keeps track of the (self-reported) real-life activity of its groups\u2014\nideally, groups with more activity are more desirable to join. However much time these groups spend\ntogether on or off the Internet, one group of people undoubtedly has the upper hand when it comes to\nonline interaction: World of Warcraft players.\nWorld of Warcraft: Social Interaction Through Avatars\nA writer for Time states the reasons for the massive popularity of online role-playing games quite well:\n\u201c[My generation\u2019s] assumptions were based on the idea that video games would never grow up. But no\ngenre has worked harder to disprove that maxim than MMORPGs\u2014Massively Multiplayer Online\nGames.\u201d[22] World of Warcraft (WoW, for short) is the most popular MMORPG of all time, with over 12\nmillion subscriptions and counting. The game is inherently social; players must complete \u201cquests\u201d in\norder to advance in the game, and many of the quests are significantly easier with multiple people. Players\noften form small, four-to five-person groups in the beginning of the game, but by the end of the game\nthese larger groups (called \u201craiding parties\u201d) can reach up to 40 players.\nIn addition, WoW provides a highly developed social networking feature called \u201cguilds.\u201d Players create or\njoin a guild, which they can then use to band with other guilds in order to complete some of the toughest\nquests. \u201cBut once you\u2019ve got a posse, the social dynamic just makes the game more addictive and time-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n521 consuming,\u201d writes Clive Thompson for Slate. [23] Although these guilds do occasionally meet up in real\nlife, most of their time together is spent online for hours per day (which amounts to quite a bit of time\ntogether), and some of the guild leaders profess to seeing real-life improvements. Joi Ito, an Internet\nbusiness and investment guru, joined WoW long after he had worked with some of the most successful\nInternet companies; he says he \u201cdefinitely\u201d [24] learned new lessons about leadership from playing the\ngame. Writer Jane Pinckard, for video game blog 1UP, lists some of Ito\u2019s favorite activities as \u201clooking\nafter newbs [lower-level players] and pleasing the veterans,\u201d which he calls a \u201cdelicate balancing\nact,\u201d [25] even for an ex-CEO.\nWith over 12 million subscribers, WoW necessarily breaks the boundaries of previous MMORPGs. The\nsocial nature of the game has attracted unprecedented numbers of female players (although men still\nmake up the vast majority of players), and its players cannot easily be pegged as antisocial video game\naddicts. On the contrary, they may even be called social video game players, judging from the general\nresponses given by players as to why they enjoy the game. This type of play certainly points to a new way\nof online interaction that may continue to grow in coming years.\nSocial Interaction on the Internet Among Low-Income Groups\nIn 2006, the journal Developmental Psychologypublished a study looking at the educational benefits of\nthe Internet for teenagers in low-income households. It found that \u201cchildren who used the Internet more\nhad higher grade point averages (GPA) after one year and higher scores after standardized tests of reading\nachievement after six months than did children who used it less\u201d and that continuing to use the Internet\nmore as the study went on led to an even greater increase in GPA and standardized test scores in reading\n(there was no change in mathematics test scores). [26]\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the study\u2019s results is the suggestion that the academic benefits may\nexclude low-performing children in low-income households. The reason for this, the study suggests, is\nthat children in low-income households likely have a social circle consisting of other children from low-\nincome households who are also unlikely to be connected to the Internet. As a result, after 16 months of\nInternet usage, only 16 percent of the participants were using email and only 25 percent were using\ninstant messaging services. Another reason researchers suggested was that because \u201cAfrican-American\nculture is historically an \u2018oral culture,\u2019\u201d and 83 percent of the participants were African American, the\n\u201cimpersonal nature of the Internet\u2019s typical communication tools\u201d may have led participants to continue\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n522 to prefer face-to-face contact. In other words, social interaction on the Internet can only happen if your\nfriends are also on the Internet.\nThe Way Forward: Communication, Convergence, and Corporations\nOn February 15, 2010, the firm Compete, which analyzes Internet traffic, reported that Facebook\nsurpassed Google as the No. 1 site to drive traffic toward news and entertainment media on both Yahoo!\nand MSN. [27] This statistic is a strong indicator that social networks are quickly becoming one of the most\neffective ways for people to sift through the ever-increasing amount of information on the Internet. It also\nsuggests that people are content to get their news the way they did before the Internet or most other forms\nof mass media were invented\u2014by word of mouth.\nMany companies now use the Internet to leverage word-of-mouth social networking. The expansion of\ncorporations into Facebook has given the service a big publicity boost, which has no doubt contributed to\nthe growth of its user base, which in turn helps the corporations that put marketing efforts into the\nservice. Putting a corporation on Facebook is not without risk; any corporation posting on Facebook runs\nthe risk of being commented on by over 500 million users, and of course there is no way to ensure that\nthose users will say positive things about the corporation. Good or bad, communicating with corporations\nis now a two-way street.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The Internet has made pop culture transmission a two-way street. The power to influence popular culture\nno longer lies with the relative few with control over traditional forms of mass media; it is now available\nto the great mass of people with access to the Internet. As a result, the cross-fertilization of pop culture\nfrom around the world has become a commonplace occurrence.\n\uf0b7 The Internet\u2019s key difference from traditional media is that it does not operate on a set intervallic time\nschedule. It is not \u201cperiodical\u201d in the sense that it comes out in daily or weekly editions; it is always\nupdated. As a result, many journalists file both \u201cregular\u201d news stories and blog posts that may be updated\nand that can come at varied intervals as necessary. This allows them to stay up-to-date with breaking\nnews without necessarily sacrificing the next day\u2019s more in-depth story.\n\uf0b7 The \u201cInternet paradox\u201d is the hypothesis that although the Internet is a tool for communication, many\nteenagers who use the Internet lack social interaction and become antisocial and depressed. It has been\nlargely disproved, especially since the Internet has grown so drastically. Many sites, such\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n523 as Meetup.com or even Facebook, work to allow users to organize for offline events. Other services, like\nthe video game World of Warcraft, serve as an alternate social world.\nEXERCISES\n1. Make a list of ways you interact with friends, either in person or on the Internet. Are there particular\nmethods of communication that only exist in person?\n2. Are there methods that exist on the Internet that would be much more difficult to replicate in person?\n3. How do these disprove the \u201cInternet paradox\u201d and contribute to the globalization of culture?\n4. Pick a method of in-person communication and a method of Internet communication, and compare and\ncontrast these using a Venn diagram.\n[1] Tim Arango, \u201cWorld Falls for American Media, Even as It Sours on America,\u201d New York Times, November 30,\n2008, http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/business/media/01soft.html.\n[2] Frank Lavin, \u201c\u2018Globalization and Culture\u2019: Remarks by Ambassador Frank Lavin at the Eisenhower Fellowship\nConference in Singapore,\u201d U.S. Embassy in Singapore, June 28, 2005,\nhttp://singapore.usembassy.gov/062805.html.\n[3] Google, \u201cInternet users as percentage of population: China,\u201d February 19, 2010,\nhttp://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&met=it_net_user_p2&idim=country:CHN&dl=en&hl=en&q=\nchina+internet+users.\n[4] Johnny Ryan and Stefan Halper, \u201cGoogle vs China: Capitalist Model, Virtual Wall,\u201d OpenDemocracy, January 22,\n2010, http://www.opendemocracy.net/johnny-ryan-stefan-halper/google-vs-china-capitalist-model-virtual-wall.\n[5] Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, \u201cInternet Overtakes Newspapers as News Outlet,\u201d December\n23, 2008, http://people-press.org/report/479/internet-overtakes-newspapers-as-news-source.\n[6] Michael Wolff, \u201cPolitico\u2019s Washington Coup,\u201d Vanity Fair, August 2009,\nhttp://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2009/08/wolff200908.\n[7] Jake Coyle, \u201cOn the Net: Hulu Is Web Site of the Year,\u201d Seattle Times, December 19, 2008,\nhttp://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2008539776_aponthenetsiteoftheyear.html.\n[8] Dan Neil, \u201c\u201830 Rock\u2019 Gets a Wink and a Nod From Two Emmy-Nominated Spots,\u201d Los Angeles Times, July 21,\n2009, http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/21/business/fi-ct-neil21.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n524 [9] John Biggs, \u201cA Video Clip Goes Viral, and a TV Network Wants to Control It,\u201d New York Times, February 20,\n2006, http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/20/business/media/20youtube.html.\n[10] Adam Sternbergh, \u201c\u2018The Office\u2019 vs. \u201830 Rock\u2019: Comedy Goes Back to Work,\u201d New York Magazine, April 10,\n2008, http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/04/the_office_vs_30_rock_comedy_g.html.\n[11] Jenna Wortham, \u201cHulu Airs Season Premiere of 30 Rock a Week Early,\u201d Wired, October 23, 2008,\nhttp://www.wired.com/underwire/2008/10/hulu-airs-seaso/.\n[12] \u201cComScore release March 2011 US Online Video Rankings,\u201d April 12, 2011,\nhttp://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/4/comScore_Releases_March_2011_U.S._Online_\nVideo_Rankings.\n[13] Greg Sandoval, \u201cMore Signs Hulu Subscription Service Is Coming,\u201d CNET, October 22,\n2009 http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10381622-261.html.\n[14] Robert Kraut and others, \u201cInternet Paradox: A Social Technology That Reduces Social Involvement and\nPsychological Well-Being?\u201d American Psychologist, September 1998,\nhttp://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&id=1998-10886-001.\n[15] Joseph M.

Define information superhighway as it relates to the Internet.\n2. Identify ways to identify credible sources online.\n3. Define net neutrality.\n4. Describe some of the effects of the Internet and social media on traditional media.\nBy 1994, the promise of the \u201cinformation superhighway\u201d had become so potent that it was given its\nown summit on the University of California Los Angeles campus. The country was quickly realizing\nthat the spread of the web could be harnessed for educational purposes; more than just the diversion\nof computer hobbyists, this new vision of the web would be a constant learning resource that anyone\ncould use.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n526 The American video artist pioneer Nam June Paik takes credit for the term information\nsuperhighway, which he used during a study for the Rockefeller Foundation in 1974, long before the\nexistence of Usenet. In 2001, he said, \u201cIf you create a highway, then people are going to invent cars.\nThat\u2019s dialectics. If you create electronic highways, something has to happen.\u201d [1] Paik\u2019s prediction\nproved to be startlingly prescient.\nAl Gore\u2019s use of the term in the House of Representatives (and later as vice president) had a slightly\ndifferent meaning and context. To Gore, the promise of the Interstate Highway System during the\nEisenhower era was that the government would work to allow communication across natural\nbarriers, and that citizens could then utilize these channels to conduct business and communicate\nwith one another. Gore saw the government as playing an essential role in maintaining the pathways\nof electronic communication. Allowing business interests to get involved would compromise what he\nsaw as a necessarily neutral purpose; a freeway doesn\u2019t judge or demand tolls\u2014it is a public service\u2014\nand neither should the Internet. During his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore was wrongly ridiculed\nfor supposedly saying that he \u201cinvented the Internet,\u201d but in reality his work in the House of\nRepresentatives played a crucial part in developing the infrastructure required for Internet access.\nHowever, a certain amount of money was necessary to get connected to the web. In this respect, AOL\nwas like the Model T of the Internet\u2014it put access to the information superhighway within reach of\nthe average person. But despite the affordability of AOL and the services that succeeded it, certain\ndemographics continued to go without access to the Internet, a problem known as the \u201cdigital\ndivide,\u201d which you will learn more about in this section.\nFrom speed of transportation, to credibility of information (don\u2019t trust the stranger at the roadside\ndiner), to security of information (keep the car doors locked), to net neutrality (toll-free roads), to the\npossibility of piracy, the metaphor of the information superhighway has proved to be remarkably apt.\nAll of these issues have played out in different ways, both positive and negative, and they continue to\ndevelop to this day.\nInformation Access Like Never Before\nIn December 2002, a survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that 84 percent of\nAmericans believed that they could find information on health care, government, news, or shopping on\nthe Internet. [2] This belief in a decade-old system of interconnected web pages would in itself be\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n527 remarkable, but taking into account that 37 percent of respondents were not even connected to the\nInternet, it becomes even more fantastic. In other words, of the percentage of Americans without Internet\nconnections, 64 percent still believed that it could be a source of information about these crucial topics. In\naddition, of those who expect to find such information, at least 70 percent of them succeed; news and\nshopping were the most successful topics, government was the least. This survey shows that most\nAmericans believed that the Internet was indeed an effective source of information. Again, the role of the\nInternet in education was heralded as a new future, and technology was seen to level the playing field for\nall students.\nNowhere was this more apparent than in the Bush administration\u2019s 2004 report, \u201cToward a New Golden\nAge in Education: How the Internet, the Law, and Today\u2019s Students Are Revolutionizing Expectations.\u201d By\nthis time, the term digital divide was already widely used and the goal of \u201cbridging\u201d it took everything\nfrom putting computers in classrooms to giving personal computers to some high-need students to use at\nhome.\nThe report stated that an \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in sectors such as e-learning and virtual schools allowed each\nstudent \u201cindividual online instruction.\u201d [3] More than just being able to find information online, people\nexpected the Internet to provide virtually unlimited access to educational opportunities. To make this\nexpectation a reality, one of the main investments that the paper called for was increased broadband\nInternet access. As Nam June Paik predicted, stringing fiber optics around the world would allow for\nseamless video communication, a development that the Department of Education saw as integral to its\nvision of educating through technology. The report called for broadband access \u201c24 hours a day, seven\ndays a week, 365 days a year,\u201d saying that it could \u201chelp teachers and students realize the full potential of\nthis technology.\u201d [4]\nRural Areas and Access to Information\nOne of the founding principles of many public library systems is to allow for free and open access to\ninformation. Historically, one of the major roadblocks to achieving this goal has been a simple one:\nlocation. Those living in rural areas or those with limited access to transportation simply could not get to a\nlibrary. But with the spread of the Internet, the hope was that a global library would be created\u2014an\nessential prospect for rural areas.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n528 One of the most remarkable educational success stories in the Department of Education\u2019s study is that of\nthe Chugach School District in Alaska. In 1994, this district was the lowest performing in the state: over\n50 percent staff turnover, the lowest standardized test scores, and only one student in 26 years graduating\nfrom college. [5] The school board instituted drastic measures, amounting to a complete overhaul of the\nsystem. They abolished grade levels, focusing instead on achievement, and by 2001 had increased Internet\nusage from 5 percent to 93 percent.\nThe Department of Education study emphasizes these numbers, and with good reason: The standardized\ntest percentile scores rose from the 1920s to the 1970s in a period of 4 years, in both math and language\narts. Yet these advances were not exclusive to low-performing rural students. In Florida, the Florida\nVirtual School system allowed rural school districts to offer advanced-placement coursework. Students\nexcelling in rural areas could now study topics that were previously limited to districts that could fill (and\nfund) an entire classroom. Just as the Interstate Highway System commercially connected the most\nremote rural communities to large cities, the Internet has brought rural areas even further into the global\nworld, especially in regard to the sharing of information and knowledge.\nThe Cloud: Instant Updates, Instant Access\nAs technology has improved, it has become possible to provide software to users as a service that resides\nentirely online, rather than on a person\u2019s personal computer. Since people can now be connected to the\nInternet constantly, they can use online programs to do all of their computing. It is no longer absolutely\nnecessary to have, for example, a program like Microsoft Word to compose documents; this can be done\nthrough an online service like Google Docs or Zoho Writer.\n\u201cCloud computing\u201d is the process of outsourcing common computing tasks to a remote server. The actual\nwork is not done by the computer attached to the user\u2019s monitor, but by other (maybe many other)\ncomputers in the \u201ccloud.\u201d As a result, the computer itself does not actually need that much processing\npower; instead of calculating \u201c1 + 1 = 2,\u201d the user\u2019s computer asks the cloud, \u201cWhat does 1 + 1 equal?\u201d and\nreceives the answer. Meanwhile, the system resources that a computer would normally devote to\ncompleting these tasks are freed up to be used for other things. An additional advantage of cloud\ncomputing is that data can be stored in the cloud and retrieved from any computer, making a user\u2019s files\nmore conveniently portable and less vulnerable to hardware failures like a hard drive crash. Of course, it\ncan require quite a bit of bandwidth to send these messages back and forth to a remote server in the cloud,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n529 and in the absence of a reliable, always-on Internet connection, the usefulness of these services can be\nsomewhat limited.\nFigure 11.11\nCloud computing allows a computer to contain very little actual information. Many of the\nprograms used by the now-popular \u201cnetbooks\u201d are stored online.\nThe concept of the cloud takes into account all the applications that are hosted on external machines and\nviewed on a user\u2019s computer. Google Docs, which provides word processors, spreadsheets, and other\ntools, and Microsoft\u2019s Hotmail, which provides email access, both constitute aspects of the \u201ccloud.\u201d These\nservices are becoming even more popular with the onset of mobile applications and netbooks, which are\nsmall laptops with relatively little processing power and storage space that rely on cloud computing. A\nnetbook does not need the processing power required to run Microsoft Word; as long as it has a web\nbrowser, it can run the Google Docs word processor and leave (almost) all of the processing to the cloud.\nBecause of this evolution of the Internet, computers can be built less like stand-alone machines and more\nlike interfaces for interacting with the larger system in the cloud.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n530 One result of cloud computing has been the rise in web applications for mobile devices, such as the\niPhone, BlackBerry, and devices that use Google\u2019s Android operating system. 3G networks, which are cell\nphone networks capable of high-speed data transfer, can augment the computing power of phones just by\ngiving the phones the ability to send data somewhere else to be processed. For example, a Google Maps\napplication does not actually calculate the shortest route between two places (taking into account how\nhighways are quicker than side roads, and numerous other computational difficulties) but rather just asks\nGoogle to do the calculation and send over the result. 3G networks have made this possible in large part\nbecause the speed of data transfer has now surpassed the speed of cell phones\u2019 calculation abilities. As\ncellular transmission technology continues to improve with the rollout of the next-\ngeneration4G networks (the successors to 3G networks), connectivity speeds will further increase and\nallow for a focus on ever-more-comprehensive provisions for multimedia.\nCredibility Issues: (Dis)information Superhighway?\nThe Internet has undoubtedly been a boon for researchers and writers everywhere. Online services range\nfrom up-to-date news and media to vast archives of past writing and scholarship. However, since the\nInternet is open to any user, anyone with a few dollars can set up a credible-sounding website and begin\nto disseminate false information.\nThis is not necessarily a problem with the Internet specifically; any traditional medium can\u2014knowingly or\nunknowingly\u2014publish unreliable or outright false information. But the explosion of available sources on\nthe Internet has caused a bit of a dilemma for information seekers. The difference is that much of the\ninformation on the Internet is not the work of professional authors, but of amateurs who have\nquestionable expertise. On the Internet, anyone can self-publish, so the vetting that usually occurs in a\ntraditional medium\u2014for example, by a magazine\u2019s editorial department\u2014rarely happens online.\nThat said, if an author who is recognizable from elsewhere writes something online, it may point to more\nreliable information. [6] In addition, looking for a trusted name on the website could lead to more\nassurance of reliability. For example, the site krugmanonline.com, the official site of Princeton economist\nPaul Krugman, does not have any authorial data. Even statements like \u201cNobel Prize Winner and Op-Ed\nColumnist for The New York Times\u201d do not actually say anything about the author of the website. Much of\nthe content is aggregated from the web as well. However, the bottom-left corner of the page has the mark\n\u201c\u00a9 2009 W. W. Norton & Company, Inc.\u201d (Krugman\u2019s publisher). Therefore, a visitor might decide to pick\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n531 and choose which information to trust. The author is clearly concerned with selling Krugman\u2019s books, so\nthe glowing reviews may need to be verified elsewhere; on the other hand, the author biography is\nprobably fairly accurate, since the publishing company has direct access to Krugman, and Krugman\nhimself probably looked it over to make sure it was valid. Taking the authorship of a site into account is a\nnecessary step when judging information; more than just hunting down untrue statements, it can give\ninsight into subtle bias that may arise and point to further research that needs to be done.\nJust Trust Me: Bias on the Web\nOne noticeable thing on Paul Krugman\u2019s site is that all of his book reviews are positive. Although these are\nprobably real reviews, they may not be representative of his critical reception at large. Mainstream\njournalistic sources usually attempt to achieve some sort of balance in their reporting; given reasonable\naccess, they will interview opposing viewpoints and reserve judgment for the editorial page. Corporate\nsources, like on Krugman\u2019s site, will instead tilt the information toward their product.\nOften, the web is viewed as a source of entertainment, even in its informational capacity. Because of this,\nsites that rely on advertising may choose to publish something more inflammatory that will be linked to\nand forwarded more for its entertainment value than for its informational qualities.\nOn the other hand, a website might attempt to present itself as a credible source of information about a\nparticular product or topic, with the end goal of selling something. A website that gives advice on how to\nprotect against bedbugs that includes a direct link to its product may not be the best source of information\non the topic. While so much on the web is free, it is worthwhile looking into how websites actually\nmaintain their services. If a website is giving something away for free, the information might be biased,\nbecause it must be getting its money from somewhere. The online archive of Consumer Reports requires a\nsubscription to access it. Ostensibly, this subscription revenue allows the service to exist as an impartial\njudge, serving the users rather than the advertisers.\nOccasionally, corporations may set up \u201ccredible\u201d fronts to disseminate information. Because sources may\nlook reliable, it is always important to investigate further. Global warming is a contentious topic, and\nwebsites about the issue often represent the bias of their owners. For example, the Cato Institute\npublishes anti-global-warming theory columns in many newspapers, including well-respected ones such\nas the Washington Times. Patrick Basham, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, published the article\n\u201cLive Earth\u2019s Inconvenient Truths\u201d in the Washington Times on July 11, 2007. Basham writes, \u201cUsing\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n532 normal scientific standards, there is no proof we are causing the Earth to warm, let alone that such\nwarming will cause an environmental catastrophe.\u201d [7]\nHowever, the website ExxposeExxon.com states that the Cato Institute received $125,000 from the oil\ngiant ExxonMobil, possibly tainting its data with bias. [8]In addition, ExxposeExxon.com is run as a side\nproject of the international environmental nonprofit Greenpeace, which may have its own reasons for\nproducing this particular report. The document available on Greenpeace\u2019s site (a scanned version of\nExxon\u2019s printout) states that in 2006, the corporation gave $20,000 to the Cato Institute [9] (the other\n$105,000 was given over the previous decade).\nThis back-and-forth highlights the difficulty of finding credible information online, especially when\nmoney is at stake. In addition, it shows how conflicting sources may go to great lengths\u2014sorting through a\ncompany\u2019s corporate financial reports\u2014in order to expose what they see as falsehoods. What is the upside\nto all of this required fact-checking and cross-examination? Before the Internet, this probably would have\nrequired multiple telephone calls and plenty of time waiting on hold. While the Internet has made false\ninformation more widely available, it has also made checking that information incredibly easy.\nWikipedia: The Internet\u2019s Precocious Problem Child\nNowhere has this cross-examination and cross-listing of sources been more widespread than with\nWikipedia. Information free and available to all? That sounds like a dream come true\u2014a dream that\nWikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was ready to pursue. Since the site began in 2001, the Wikimedia\nFoundation (which hosts all of the Wikipedia pages) has become the sixth-most-visited site on the web,\nbarely behind eBay in terms of its unique page views.\nTable 11.3 Top 10 Global Web Parent Companies, Home and Work\nRank Parent Unique Audience (millions) Active Reach % Time\n1 Google 362,006 84.29 2:27:15\n2 Microsoft 322,352 75.06 2:53:48\n3 Yahoo! 238,035 55.43 1:57:26\n4 Facebook 218,861 50.96 6:22:24\n5 eBay 163,325 38.03 1:42:46\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n533 Rank Parent Unique Audience (millions) Active Reach % Time\n6 Wikimedia 154,905 36.07 0:15:14\n7 AOL LLC 128,147 29.84 2:08:32\n8 Amazon 128,071 29.82 0:23:24\n9 News Corp. 125,898 29.31 0:53:53\n10 InterActiveCorp 122,029 28.41 0:10:52\nSource: The Nielsen Company\nOrganizations had long been trying to develop factual content for the web but Wikipedia went for\nsomething else: verifiability. The guidelines for editing Wikipedia state, \u201cWhat counts is whether readers\ncan verify that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether\neditors think it is true.\u201d [10] The benchmark for inclusion on Wikipedia includes outside citations for any\ncontent \u201clikely to be challenged\u201d and for \u201call quotations.\u201d\nWhile this may seem like it\u2019s a step ahead of many other sources on the Internet, there is a catch: Anyone\ncan edit Wikipedia. This has a positive and negative side\u2014though anyone can vandalize the site, anyone\ncan also fix it. In addition, calling a particularly contentious page to attention can result in one of the site\u2019s\nadministrators placing a warning at the top of the page stating that the information is not necessarily\nverified. Other warnings include notices on articles about living persons, which are given special\nattention, and articles that may violate Wikipedia\u2019s neutrality policy. This neutrality policy is a way to\nmitigate the extreme views that may be posted on a page with open access, allowing the community to\ndecide what constitutes a \u201csignificant\u201d view that should be represented. [11]\nAs long as users do not take the facts on Wikipedia at face value and make sure to follow up on the\nrelevant sources linked in the articles they read, the site is an extremely useful reference tool that gives\nusers quick access to a wide range of subjects. However, articles on esoteric subjects can be especially\nprone to vandalism or poorly researched information. Since every reader is a potential editor, a lack of\nreaders can lead to a poorly edited page because errors, whether deliberate or not, go uncorrected. In\nshort, the lack of authorial credit can lead to problems with judging bias and relevance of information, so\nthe same precautions must be taken with Wikipedia as with any other online source, primarily in checking\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n534 references. The advantage of Wikipedia is its openness and freedom\u2014if you find a problem, you can either\nfix it (with your own verifiable sources) or flag it on the message boards. Culturally, there has been a shift\nfrom valuing a few reliable sources to valuing a multiplicity of competing sources. However, weighing\nthese sources against one another has become easier than ever before.\nSecurity of Information on the Internet\nAs the Internet has grown in scope and the amount of personal information online has proliferated,\nsecuring this information has become a major issue. The Internet now houses everything from online\nbanking systems to highly personal email messages, and even though security is constantly improving,\nthis information is not invulnerable.\nAn example of this vulnerability is the Climategate scandal in late 2009. A collection of private email\nmessages were hacked from a server at the University of East Anglia, where much of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change research takes place. These emails show internal debates\namong the scientists regarding which pieces of data should be released and which are not relevant (or\nhelpful) to their case. [12] In these emails, the scientists sometimes talk about colleagues\u2014especially those\nskeptical of climate change\u2014in a derisive way. Of course, these emails were never meant to become\npublic.\nThis scandal demonstrates how easy it can be to lose control of private information on the Internet. In\nprevious decades, hard copies of these letters would have to be found, and the theft could probably be\ntraced back to a specific culprit. With the Internet, it is much more difficult to tell who is doing the\nsnooping, especially if it is done on a public network. The same protocols that allow for open access and\ncommunication also allow for possible exploitation. Like the Interstate Highway System, the Internet is\nimpartial to its users. In other words: If you\u2019re going to ride, lock your doors.\nHacking email: From LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU to Google in China\nAnother explosive scandal involving email account hacking also occurred in late 2009, when Google\u2019s\nGmail service was hacked by IP addresses originating in China. Gmail was one of the primary services\nused by human rights activists due to its location in the United States and its extra encryption. To\nunderstand the magnitude of this, it is important to understand the history of email hacking and the\nimportance of physical server location and local laws.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n535 In 2000, a computer virus was unleashed by a student in the Philippines that simply sent a message with\nthe subject line \u201cI Love You.\u201d The email had a file attached, called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs.\nThe suffix \u201c.txt\u201d is generally used for text files and was meant, in this case, as a distraction; the file\u2019s real\nsuffix was \u201c.vbs,\u201d which means that the file is a script. When run, this script ran and emailed itself across\nthe user\u2019s entire address book, before sending any available passwords to an email address in the\nPhilippines. One of the key aspects of this case, however, was a matter of simple jurisdiction: the student\nwas not prosecuted, due to the lack of computer crime laws in the Philippines.[13]\nThe encryption that Gmail uses resulted in only two of the accounts being successfully hacked, and\nhackers were only able to see email subject lines and timestamps\u2014no message content was\navailable. [14] Since the chaos that ensued after the \u201cI Love You\u201d virus, email users and service providers\nhave become more vigilant in their defensive techniques. However, the increased reliance on email for\ndaily communication makes it an attractive target for hackers. The development of cloud computing will\nlikely lead to entirely new problems with Internet security; just as a highway brings two communities\ntogether, it can also cause these communities to share problems.\nCan\u2019t Wait: Denial of Service\nAlthough many people increasingly rely on the Internet for communication and access to information,\nthis reliance has come with a hefty price. Most critically, a simple exploit can cause massive roadblocks to\nInternet traffic, leading to disruptions in commerce, communication, and, as the military continues to rely\non the Internet, national security.\nDistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks work like cloud computing, but in reverse. Instead of a single\ncomputer going out to retrieve data from many different sources, DDoS is a coordinated effort by many\ndifferent computers to bring down (or overwhelm) a specific website. Essentially, any web server can only\nhandle a certain amount of information at once. While the largest and most stable web servers can talk to\na huge number of computers simultaneously, even these can be overwhelmed.\nDuring a DDoS attack on government servers belonging to both the United States and South Korea in July\n2009, many U.S. government sites were rendered unavailable to users in Asia for a short\ntime. [15] Although this did not have a major effect on U.S. cyber-security, the ease with which these\nservers could be exploited was troubling. In this case, the DDoS attacks were perpetuated by an email\nvirus known as MyDoom, which essentially turned users\u2019 computers into server-attacking \u201czombies.\u201d This\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n536 exploit\u2014coupling an email scam with a larger attack\u2014is difficult to trace, partly because the culprit is\nlikely not one of the original attackers, but rather the victim of a virus used to turn vulnerable computers\ninto an automated hacker army. Since the attack, President Barack Obama has committed to creating a\nnew post for a head of cyber-security in the government.\nNet Neutrality\nMost Internet users in the United States connect through a commercial Internet service provider (ISP).\nThe major players\u2014Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner Cable, AT&T, and others\u2014are portals to the larger\nInternet, serving as a way for anyone with a cable line or phone line to receive broadband Internet access\nthrough a dedicated data line.\nIdeally, ISPs treat all content impartially; any two websites will load at the same speed if they have\nadequate server capabilities. Service providers are not entirely happy with this arrangement. ISPs have\nproposed a new service model that would allow corporations to pay for a \u201chigher tier\u201d service. For\nexample, this would allow AOL Time Warner to deliver its Hulu service (which Time Warner co-owns\nwith NBC) faster than all other video services, leading to partnerships between Internet content providers\nand Internet service providers. The service providers also often foot the bill for expanding high-speed\nInternet access, and they see this new two-tiered service as a way to cash in on some of that investment\n(and, presumably, to reinvest the funds received).\nThe main fear\u2014and the reason the FCC introduced net neutrality rules\u2014is that such a service would\nhamper the ability of an Internet startup to grow its business. Defenders of net neutrality contend that\nsmall businesses (those without the ability to forge partnerships with the service providers) would be\nforced onto a \u201csecond-tier\u201d Internet service, and their content would naturally suffer, decreasing\ninventiveness and competition among Internet content providers.\nNet Neutrality Legislation: The FCC and AT&T\nOne of the key roadblocks to Internet legislation is the difficulty of describing the Internet and the\nInternet\u2019s place among communication bills of the past. First of all, it is important to realize that\nlegislation relating to the impartiality of service providers is not unheard-of. Before the 1960s, AT&T was\nallowed to restrict its customers to using only its own telephones on its networks. In the 1960s, the FCC\nlaunched a series of \u201cComputer Inquiries,\u201d stating, in effect, that any customer could use any device on the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n537 network, as long as it did not actually harm the network. This led to inventions such as the fax machine,\nwhich would not have been possible under AT&T\u2019s previous agreement.\nA key point today is that these proto\u2013net neutrality rules protected innovation even when they\n\u201cthreatened to be a substitute for regulated services.\u201d [16] This is directly relevant to a controversy\ninvolving Apple\u2019s iPhone that culminated in October 2009 when AT&T agreed to allow VoIP (voice over\nInternet Protocol) on its 3G data networks. VoIP services, like the program Skype, allow a user to place a\ntelephone call from an Internet data line to a traditional telephone line. In the case of the iPhone, AT&T\ndid not actually block the transmission of data\u2014it just had Apple block the app from its App Store. Since\nAT&T runs the phone service as well as the data lines, and since many users have plans with unlimited\ndata connections, AT&T could see its phone profits cut drastically if all its users suddenly switched to\nusing Skype to place all their telephone calls.\nMisleading Metaphors: It\u2019s Not a Big Truck\nSenator Ted Stevens, the former head of the committee in charge of regulating the Internet, said on the\nfloor of the Senate that the Internet is \u201cnot a big truck \u2026 it\u2019s a series of tubes.\u201d [17] According to this\nmetaphor, an email can get \u201cstuck in the tubes\u201d for days behind someone else\u2019s material, leading to poorer\nservice for the customer. In reality, service providers sell data-usage plans that only set a cap on the\namount of data that someone can send over the Internet (measured in bits per second, where a bit is the\nsmallest measurement of data). If a service is rated at 1.5 million bits per second (megabits per second, or\n1.5 Mbps), it may only reach this once in a while\u2014no one can \u201cclog the tubes\u201d without paying massive\namounts of money for the service. Theoretically, the company will then invest this service fee in building\nmore robust \u201ctubes.\u201d\nNet neutrality is difficult to legislate in part because it can be confusing: It relies on understanding how\nthe Internet works and how communications are regulated. Stevens\u2019s metaphor is misleading because it\nassumes that Internet capacity is not already regulated in some natural way. To use the superhighway\nanalogy, Stevens is suggesting that the highways are congested, and his solution is to allow companies to\ndedicate express lanes for high-paying customers (it should be noted that the revenue would go to the\nservice providers, even though the government has chipped in quite a bit for information superhighway\nconstruction). The danger of this is that it would be very difficult for a small business or personal site to\nafford express-lane access. Worse yet, the pro\u2013net neutrality organization Save the Internet says that a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n538 lack of legislation would allow companies to \u201cdiscriminate in favor of their own search engines\u201d and \u201cleave\nthe rest of us on a winding dirt road.\u201d [18] For areas that only have access to one Internet service, this\nwould amount to a lack of access to all the available content.\nDigital Technology and Electronic Media\nContent on the Internet competes with content from other media outlets. Unlimited and cheap digital\nduplication of content removes the concept of scarcity from the economic model of media; it is no longer\nnecessary to buy a physical CD fabricated by a company in order to play music, and digital words on a\nscreen convey the news just as well as words printed on physical newspaper. Media companies have been\nforced to reinvent themselves as listeners, readers, and watchers have divided into smaller and smaller\nsubcategories.\nTraditional media companies have had to evolve to adapt to the changes wrought by the Internet\nrevolution, but these media are far from obsolete in an online world. For example, social media can\nprovide a very inexpensive and reliable model for maintaining a band\u2019s following. A record company (or\nthe band itself) can start a Facebook page, through which it can notify all its fans about new albums and\ntour dates\u2014or even just remind fans that it still exists. MySpace has been (and still is, to an extent) one of\nthe main musical outlets on the Internet. This free service comes with a small web-based music player\nthat allows people interested in the band to listen to samples of its music. Coupling free samples with\nsocial networking allows anyone to discover a band from anywhere in the world, leading to the possibility\nof varying and eclectic tastes not bound by geography.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 On one hand, the information superhighway has opened up rural areas to global connections and made\ncommunication and trade much easier. One downside, however, is that illicit and unwanted information\ncan move just as quickly as positive information\u2014it is up to the recipient to decide.\n\uf0b7 The lack of authorial attribution on many online forums can make it difficult to find credible information.\nHowever, Wikipedia\u2019s concept of \u201cverifiability,\u201d or citing verified sources, has provided a good check to\nwhat can become a matter of mere my-word-against-yours. It is important to gauge possible bias in a\nsource and to judge whether the author has an economic interest in the information.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n539 \uf0b7 Net neutrality is a general category of laws that seek to make it illegal for service providers to discriminate\namong types of Internet content. One downside of content discrimination is that a service provider could\npotentially make competitors\u2019 sites load much more slowly than their own.\nEXERCISES\n1.

In only a year,\nmore than 13 million unique visitors came to the site just to see what the chicken would do. [1]\nGiven advertising\u2019s somewhat scandalous history, the phenomenon of viral advertising is nothing short of\nincredible. During the 1800s, public opinion ranked advertising as an immoral, lowbrow profession, full\nof liars and outlandish publicists. [2] Early magazines such as Harper\u2019s Weekly initially refused to carry\nads. Even after most forms of media had begun accepting advertisments, the spots annoyed hosts as well\nas readers, listeners, and viewers. In both its radio and television formats, the popular Jack Benny Show\nregularly mocked the sponsor mentions for Jell-O that announcers had to make during the show. During\nthe 1960s, advertisements actually capitalized on the American public\u2019s fatigue with traditional\nadvertising techniques. Nearly 40 years later, the arrival of digital video recorder (DVR) technology was\nheralded as a means for television watchers to eliminate obnoxious advertisements altogether. Then, in\n2005, more than 13 million people sought out a commercial of their own volition\u2014even repeatedly going\nback to it\u2014to see what it would do next.\nThe Subservient Chicken campaign was truly a mix of advertising and public relations. The website was\ncovered widely in the press, received commentary from bloggers, and was shared among millions of users\nwho had discovered new commands for the chicken. Advertisements for the associated chicken sandwich\non television and in print ads reinforced all this free publicity. This campaign demonstrates the ways that\nadvertising and public relations are related and even complement each other. Given the popularity of such\ncampaigns, it is not difficult to see the cultural effects of advertising and public relations.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n544 [1] Nat Ives, \u201cInteractive Viral Campaigns Ask Users to Spread the Word,\u201d New York Times, February 18, 2005,\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EEDF113AF93BA25751C0A9639C8B63.\n[2] William M.

Describe important eras in the history of American advertising.\n2. Analyze the overall effects of government regulation on advertising.\n3. Identify the types of advertising used today.\n4. Describe the impact of advertising on American consumerism and cultural values.\nAdvertising is defined as promoting a product or service through the use of paid\nannouncements. [1] These announcements have had an enormous effect on modern culture, and thus\ndeserve a great deal of attention in any treatment of the media\u2019s influence on culture.\nHistory of Advertising\nFigure 12.1\nHistory of Advertising\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n545 Advertising dates back to ancient Rome\u2019s public markets and forums and continues into the modern era\nin most homes around the world. Contemporary consumers relate to and identify with brands and\nproducts. Advertising has inspired an independent press and conspired to encourage carcinogenic\naddictions. An exceedingly human invention, advertising is an unavoidable aspect of the shared modern\nexperience.\nAncient and Medieval Advertising\nIn 79 CE, the eruption of Italy\u2019s Mount Vesuvius destroyed and, ultimately, preserved the ancient city of\nPompeii. Historians have used the city\u2019s archaeological evidence to piece together many aspects of ancient\nlife. Pompeii\u2019s ruins reveal a world in which the fundamental tenets of commerce and advertising were\nalready in place. Merchants offered different brands of fish sauces identified by various names such as\n\u201cScaurus\u2019 tunny jelly.\u201d Wines were branded as well, and their manufacturers sought to position them by\nmaking claims about their prestige and quality. Toys and other merchandise found in the city bear the\nnames of famous athletes, providing, perhaps, the first example of endorsement techniques. [2]\nThe invention of the printing press in 1440 made it possible to print advertisements that could be put up\non walls and handed out to individuals. By the 1600s, newspapers had begun to include advertisements\non their pages. Advertising revenue allowed newspapers to print independently of secular or clerical\nauthority, eventually achieving daily circulation. By the end of the 16th century, most newspapers\ncontained at least some advertisements. [3]\nSelling the New World\nEuropean colonization of the Americas during the 1600s brought about one of the first large-scale\nadvertising campaigns. When European trading companies realized that the Americas held economic\npotential as a source of natural resources such as timber, fur, and tobacco, they attempted to convince\nothers to cross the Atlantic Ocean and work to harvest this bounty. The advertisements for this venture\ndescribed a paradise without beggars and with plenty of land for those who made the trip. The\nadvertisements convinced many poor Europeans to become indentured servants to pay for the voyage. [4]\nNineteenth-Century Roots of Modern Advertising\nFigure 12.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n546 Early penny press papers such as the New York Sun took advantage of advertisements, which allowed them to sell their\nissues for a penny or two.\nThe rise of the penny press during the 1800s had a profound effect on advertising. The New York Sun\nembraced a novel advertising model in 1833 that allowed it to sell issues of the paper for a trifling amount\nof money, ensuring a higher circulation and a wider audience. This larger audience in turn justified\ngreater prices for advertisements, allowing the paper to make a profit from its ads rather than from direct\nsales. [5]\nP. T. Barnum and Advertising\nThe career of P. T. Barnum, cofounder of the famed Barnum & Bailey circus, gives a sense of the\nuncontrolled nature of advertising during the 1800s. He began his career in the 1840s writing ads for a\ntheater, and soon after, he began promoting his own shows. He advertised these shows any way he could,\nusing not only interesting newspaper ads but also bands of musicians, paintings on the outside of his\nbuildings, and street-spanning banners.\nBarnum also learned the effectiveness of using the media to gain attention. In an early publicity stunt,\nBarnum hired a man to wordlessly stack bricks at various corners near his museum during the hours\npreceding a show. When this activity drew a crowd, the man went to the museum and bought a ticket for\nthe show. This stunt drew such large crowds over the next two days, that the police made Barnum put a\nhalt to it, gaining it even wider media attention. Barnum was sued for fraud over a bearded woman\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n547 featured in one of his shows; the plaintiffs claimed that she was, in fact, a man. Rather than trying to keep\nthe trial quiet, Barnum drew attention to it by parading a crowd of witnesses attesting to the bearded\nwoman\u2019s gender, drawing more media attention\u2014and more customers.\nFigure 12.3\nP. T. Barnum used the press to spark interest in his shows.\nBarnum aimed to make his audience think about what they had seen for an extended time. His Feejee\nmermaid\u2014actually a mummified monkey and fish sewn together\u2014was not necessarily interesting because\nviewers thought the creation was really a mermaid, but because they weren\u2019t sure if it was or not. Such\nmarketing tactics brought Barnum\u2019s shows out of his establishments and into social conversations and\nnewspapers. [6] Although most companies today would eschew Barnum\u2019s outrageous style, many have\nused the media and a similar sense of mystery to promote their products. Apple, for example, famously\nkeeps its products such as the iPhone and iPad under wraps, building media anticipation and coverage.\nIn 1843, a salesman named Volney Palmer founded the first U.S. advertising agency in Philadelphia. The\nagency made money by linking potential advertisers with newspapers. By 1867, other agencies had\nformed, and advertisements were being marketed at the national level. During this time, George Rowell,\nwho made a living buying bulk advertising space in newspapers to subdivide and sell to advertisers, began\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n548 conducting market research in its modern recognizable form. He used surveys and circulation counts to\nestimate numbers of readers and anticipate effective advertising techniques. His agency gained an\nadvantage over other agencies by offering advertising space most suited for a particular product. This\ntrend quickly caught on with other agencies. In 1888, Rowell started the first advertising trade\nmagazine, Printers\u2019 Ink. [7]\nIn Chapter 5 \"Magazines\", you read about McClure\u2019s success in 1893 thanks to an advertising model:\nselling issues for nearly half the price of other magazines and depending on advertising revenues to make\nup the difference between cost and sales price. Magazines such as Ladies\u2019 Home Journal focused on\nspecific audiences, so they allowed advertisers to market products designed for a specific demographic. By\n1900, Harper\u2019s Weekly, once known for refusing advertising, featured ads on half of its pages. [8]\nThe Rise of Brand Names\nFigure 12.4\nIn the early 1900s, brand-name food items, such as this one, began making a household name for themselves.\nAnother ubiquitous aspect of advertising developed around this time: brands. During most of the 19th\ncentury, consumers purchased goods in bulk, weighing out scoops of flour or sugar from large store\nbarrels and paying for them by the pound. Innovations in industrial packaging allowed companies to mass\nproduce bags, tins, and cartons with brand names on them. Although brands existed before this time, they\nwere generally reserved for goods that were inherently recognizable, such as china or furniture.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n549 Advertising a particular kind of honey or flour made it possible for customers to ask for that product by\nname, giving it an edge over the unnamed competition. [9]\nFigure 12.5\nDepartment stores such as Sears, Roebuck and Co. reached consumers outside of the city through\nmail-order catalogs.\nThe rise of department stores during the late 1800s also gave brands a push. Nationwide outlets such as\nSears, Roebuck & Company and Montgomery Ward sold many of the same items to consumers all over the\ncountry. A particular item spotted in a big-city storefront could come to a small-town shopper\u2019s home\nthanks to mail-order catalogs. Customers made associations with the stores, trusting them to have a\nparticular kind of item and to provide quality wares. Essentially, consumers came to trust the store\u2019s\nname rather than its specific products. [10]\nAdvertising Gains Stature During the 20th Century\nAlthough advertising was becoming increasingly accepted as an element of mass media, many still\nregarded it as an unseemly occupation. This attitude began to change during the early 20th century. As\nmagazines\u2014widely considered a highbrow medium\u2014began using more advertising, the advertising\nprofession began attracting more artists and writers. Writers used verse and artists produced illustrations\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n550 to embellish advertisements. Not surprisingly, this era gave rise to commercial jingles and iconic brand\ncharacters such as the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy.\nThe household cleaner Sapolio produced advertisements that made the most of the artistic advertising\ntrend. Sapolio\u2019s ads featured various drawings of the residents of \u201cSpotless Town\u201d along with a rhymed\nverse celebrating the virtues of this fictional haven of cleanliness. The public anticipated each new ad in\nmuch the same way people today anticipate new television episodes. In fact, the ads became so popular\nthat citizens passed \u201cSpotless Town\u201d resolutions to clean up their own jurisdictions. Advertising trends\nlater moved away from flowery writing and artistry, but the lessons of those memorable campaigns\ncontinued to influence the advertising profession for years to come. [11]\nAdvertising Makes Itself Useful\nWorld War I fueled an advertising and propaganda boom. Corporations that had switched to\nmanufacturing wartime goods wanted to stay in the public eye by advertising their patriotism. Equally,\nthe government needed to encourage public support for the war, employing such techniques as the\nfamous Uncle Sam recruiting poster. President Woodrow Wilson established the advertiser-run\nCommittee on Public Information to make movies and posters, write speeches, and generally sell the war\nto the public. Advertising helped popularize World War I on the homefront, and the war in turn gave\nadvertising a much-needed boost in stature. The postwar return to regular manufacturing initiated the\n1920s as an era of unprecedented advertising. [12]\nNew Media\nThe rising film industry made celebrity testimonials, or product endorsements, an important aspect of\nadvertising during the 1920s. Film stars including Clara Bow and Joan Crawford endorsed products such\nas Lux toilet soap. In these early days of mass-media consumer culture, film actors and actresses gave the\npublic figures to emulate as they began participating in popular culture. [13]\nAs discussed in Chapter 7 \"Radio\", radio became an accepted commercial medium during the 1920s.\nAlthough many initially thought radio was too intrusive a medium to allow advertising, as it entered\npeople\u2019s homes by the end of the decade, advertising had become an integral aspect of programming.\nAdvertising agencies often created their own programs that networks then distributed. As advertisers\nconducted surveys and researched prime time slots, radio programming changed to appeal to their target\ndemographics. The famous Lux Radio Theater, for example, was named for and sponsored by a brand of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n551 soap. Product placement was an important part of these early radio programs. Ads for Jell-O appeared\nduring the course of the Jack Benny Show, [14] and Fibber McGee and Molly scripts often involved their\nsponsor\u2019s floor wax. [15]The relationship between a sponsor and a show\u2019s producers was not always\nharmonious; the producers of radio programs were constrained from broadcasting any content that might\nreflect badly on their sponsor.\nThe Great Depression and Backlash\nUnsurprisingly, the Great Depression, with its widespread decreases in levels of income and buying\npower, had a negative effect on advertising. Spending on ads dropped to a mere 38 percent of its previous\nlevel. Social reformers added to revenue woes by again questioning the moral standing of the advertising\nprofession. Books such as Through Many Windows and Our Master\u2019s Voice portrayed advertisers as\ndishonest and cynical, willing to say anything to make a profit and unconcerned about their influence on\nsociety. Humorists also questioned advertising\u2019s authority. The Depression-era magazine Ballyhoo\nregularly featured parodies of ads, similar to those seen later on Saturday Night Live or in The Onion.\nThese ads mocked the claims that had been made throughout the 1920s, further reducing advertising\u2019s\npublic standing. [16]\nThis advertising downturn lasted only as long as the Depression. As the United States entered World War\nII, advertising again returned to encourage public support and improve the image of\nbusinesses. [17] However, there was one lasting effect of the Depression. The rising consumer movement\nmade false and misleading advertising a major public policy issue. At the time, companies such as\nFleischmann\u2019s (which claimed its yeast could cure crooked teeth) were using advertisements to pitch\nmisleading assertions. Only business owners\u2019 personal morals stood in the way of such claims until 1938,\nwhen the federal government created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and gave it the authority to\nhalt false advertising.\nPostwar Television\nFigure 12.6\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n552 Shows such as Kraft Television Theatre were created by single sponsors\u2014 in this case, Kraft Foods Inc.\nIn 1955, television outpaced all other media for advertising. television provided advertisers with unique,\ngeographically oriented mass markets that could be targeted with regionally appropriate ads.[18] The 1950s\nsaw a 75 percent increase in advertising spending, faster than any other economic indicator at the time. [19]\nSingle sponsors created early television programs. These sponsors had total control over programs such\nas Goodyear TV Playhouse and Kraft Television Theatre. Some sponsors went as far as to manipulate\nvarious aspects of the programs. In one instance, a program run by the DeSoto car company asked a\ncontestant to use a false name rather than his given name, Ford. The present-day network model of\ntelevision advertising took hold during the 1950s as the costs of television production made sole\nsponsorship of a show prohibitive for most companies. Rather than having a single sponsor, the networks\nbegan producing their own shows, paying for them through ads sold to a number of different\nsponsors. [20] Under the new model of advertising, television producers had much more creative control\nthan they had under the sole-sponsorship model.\nThe quiz shows of the 1950s were the last of the single-sponsor\u2013produced programs. In 1958, when\nallegations of quiz show fraud became national news, advertisers moved out of programming entirely. The\nquiz show scandals also added to an increasing scepticism of ads and consumer culture. [21]\nAdvertising research during the 1950s had used scientifically driven techniques to attempt to influence\nconsumer opinion. Although the effectiveness of this type of advertising is questionable, the idea of\nconsumer manipulation through scientific methods became an issue for many Americans. Vance\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n553 Packard\u2019s best-selling 1957 book The Hidden Persuaders targeted this style of advertising. The Hidden\nPersuaders and other books like it were part of a growing critique of 1950s consumer culture. The U.S.\npublic was becoming increasingly wary of advertising claims\u2014 not to mention increasingly weary of ads\nthemselves. A few adventurous ad agencies used this consumer fatigue to usher in a new era of advertising\nand American culture. [22]\nThe Creative Revolution\nBurdened by association with Nazi Germany, where the company had originated, Volkswagen took a\ndaring risk during the 1950s. In 1959, the Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) agency initiated an ad campaign\nfor the company that targeted skeptics of contemporary culture. Using a frank personal tone with the\naudience and making fun of the planned obsolescence that was the hallmark of Detroit automakers, the\ncampaign stood apart from other advertisements of the time. It used many of the consumer icons of the\n1950s, such as suburbia and game shows, in a satirical way, pitting Volkswagen against mainstream\nconformity and placing it strongly on the side of the consumer. By the end of the 1960s, the campaign had\nbecome an icon of American anticonformity. In fact, it was such a success that other automakers quickly\nemulated it. Ads for the Dodge Fever, for example, mocked corporate values and championed rebellion. [23]\nThis era of advertising became known as the \u201ccreative revolution\u201d for its emphasis on creativity over\nstraight salesmanship. The creative revolution reflected the values of the growing anticonformist\nmovement that culminated in the countercultural revolution of the 1960s. The creativity and\nanticonformity of 1960s advertising quickly gave way to more product-oriented conventional ads during\nthe 1970s. Agency conglomeration, a recession, and cultural fallout were all factors in the recycling of\nolder ad techniques. Major television networks dropped their long-standing ban on comparative\nadvertising early in the decade, leading to a new trend in positioning ads that compared products.\nAdvertising wars such as Coke versus Pepsi and, later, Microsoft versus Apple were products of this\ntrend. [24]\nInnovations in the 1980s stemmed from a new television channel: MTV. Producers of youth-oriented\nproducts created ads featuring music and focusing on stylistic effects, mirroring the look and feel of music\nvideos. By the end of the decade, this style had extended to more mainstream products. Campaigns for the\npain reliever Nuprin featured black-and-white footage with bright yellow pills, whereas ads for Michelob\nused grainy atmospheric effects. [25]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n554 Advertising Stumbles\nDuring the late 1980s, studies showed that consumers were trending away from brands and brand loyalty.\nA recession coupled with general consumer fatigue led to an increase in generic brand purchases and a\ndecrease in advertising. In 1983, marketing budgets allocated 70 percent of their expenditures to ads and\nthe remaining 30 percent to other forms of promotion. By 1993, only 25 percent of marketing budgets\nwere dedicated to ads. [26]\nThese developments resulted in the rise of big-box stores such as Walmart that focused on low prices\nrather than expensive name brands. Large brands remade themselves during this period to focus less on\ntheir products and more on the ideas behind the brand. Nike\u2019s \u201cJust Do It\u201d campaign, endorsed by\nbasketball star Michael Jordan, gave the company a new direction and a new means of promotion. Nike\nrepresentatives have stated they have become more of a \u201cmarketing-oriented company\u201d as opposed to a\nproduct manufacturer. [27]\nAs large brands became more popular, they also attracted the attention of reformers. Companies such as\nStarbucks and Nike bore the brunt of late 1990s sweatshop and labor protests. As these brands attempted\nto incorporate ideas outside of the scope of their products, they also came to represent larger global\ncommerce forces. [28] This type of branding increasingly incorporated public relations techniques that will\nbe discussed later in this chapter.\nThe Rise of Digital Media\nTwenty-first-century advertising has adapted to new forms of digital media. Internet outlets such as blogs,\nsocial media forums, and other online spaces have created new possibilities for advertisers, and shifts in\nbroadcasting toward Internet formats have threatened older forms of advertising. Video games,\nsmartphones, and other technologies also present new possibilities. Specific new media advertising\ntechniques will be covered in the next section.\nTypes of Advertising\nDespite the rise of digital media, many types of traditional advertising have proven their enduring\neffectiveness. Local advertisers and large corporations continue to rely on billboards and direct-mail\nfliers. In 2009, Google initiated a billboard campaign for its Google Apps products that targeted business\ncommuters. The billboards featured a different message every day for an entire month, using simple\ncomputer text messages portraying a fictitious executive learning about the product. Although this\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n555 campaign was integrated with social media sites such as Twitter, its main thrust employed the basic\nbillboard. [29]\nNewspapers and Magazines\nAlthough print ads have been around for centuries, Internet growth has hit newspaper advertising hard. A\n45 percent drop in ad revenue between 2007 and 2010 signaled a catastrophic decline for the newspaper\nindustry. [30] Traditionally, newspapers have made money through commercial and classified advertising.\nCommercial advertisers, however, have moved to electronic media forms, and classified ad websites such\nas Craigslist offer greater geographic coverage for free. The future of newspaper advertising\u2014and of the\nnewspaper industry as a whole\u2014is up in the air.\nPrint magazines have suffered from many of the same difficulties as newspapers. Declining advertising\nrevenue has contributed to the end of popular magazines such as Gourmet and to the introduction of new\nmagazines that cross over into other media formats, such as Food Network Magazine. Until a new,\neffective model is developed, the future of magazine advertising will continue to be in doubt.\nRadio\nCompared to newspapers and magazines, radio\u2019s advertising revenue has done well. Radio\u2019s easy\nadaptation to new forms of communication has made it an easy sell to advertisers. Unlike newspapers,\nradio ads target specific consumers. Advertisers can also pay to have radio personalities read their ads live\nin the studio, adding a sense of personal endorsement to the business or product. Because newer forms of\nradio such as satellite and Internet stations have continued to use this model, the industry has not had as\nmuch trouble adapting as print media have.\nTelevision\nTelevision advertisement relies on verbal as well as visual cues to sell items. Promotional ad time is\npurchased by the advertiser, and a spot usually runs 15 to 30 seconds. Longer ads, known as infomercials,\nrun like a television show and usually aim for direct viewer response. New technologies such as DVR allow\ntelevision watchers to skip through commercials; however, studies have shown that these technologies do\nnot have a negative effect on advertising. [31] This is party due to product placement. Product placement is\nan important aspect of television advertising, because it incorporates products into the plots of shows.\nAlthough product placement has been around since the 1890s, when the Lumi\u00e8re brothers first placed\nLever soap in their movies, the big boom in product placement began with the reality television\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n556 show Survivor in 2000. [32]Since then, product placement has been a staple of prime-time entertainment.\nReality television shows such as Project Runway and American Idol are known for exhibiting products on\nscreen, and talk-show host Oprah Winfrey made news in 2004 when she gave away new Pontiacs to her\naudience members. [33] Even children\u2019s shows are known to hock products; a new cartoon series recently\nbegan on Nickelodeon featuring characters that represent different Sketchers sneakers. [34]\nDigital Media\nEmerging digital media platforms such as the Internet and mobile phones have created many new\nadvertising possibilities. The Internet, like television and radio, offers free services in exchange for\nadvertising exposure. However, unlike radio or television, the Internet is a highly personalized experience\nthat shares private information.\nViral Ads\nAs you read in Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social Media\", new advertising techniques have become\npopular on the Internet. Advertisers have tried to capitalize on the shared-media phenomenon by\ncreating viral ads that achieve spontaneous success online. Fewer than one in six ads that are intended to\ngo viral actually succeed, so marketers have developed strategies to encourage an advertisement\u2019s viral\npotential. Successful spots focus on creativity rather than a hard-selling strategy and generally target a\nspecific audience. [35] Recent Old Spice ads featured former NFL player Isaiah Mustafa in a set of\ncontinuous scenes, from a shower room to a yacht. The commercial ends with the actor on horseback, a\ntheatrical trick that left viewers wondering how the stunt was pulled off. As of July 2010, the ad was the\nmost popular video on YouTube with more than 94 million views, and Old Spice sales had risen 106\npercent. [36]\nSocial Media\nSocial media sites such as Facebook use the information users provide on their profiles to generate\ntargeted advertisements. For instance, if a person is a fan of Mariah Carey or joined a group associated\nwith the singer, he or she might see announcements advertising her new CD or a local concert. While this\nmay seem harmless, clicking on an ad sends user data to the advertising company, including name and\nuser ID. Many people have raised privacy concerns over this practice, yet it remains in use. Free email\nservices such as Gmail also depend on targeted advertising for their survival. Indeed, advertising is the\nonly way such services could continue. Given the ongoing privacy debates concerning targeted Internet\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n557 advertising, a balance between a user\u2019s privacy and accessibility of services will have to be settled in the\nnear future.\nMobile Phones\nMobile phones provide several different avenues for advertisers. The growing use of Internet radio\nthrough mobile-phone platforms has created a market for advertisements tapped by radio advertising\nnetworks such as TargetSpot. By using the radio advertising model for mobile phones, users receive\nincreased radio broadcast options and advertisers reach new targeted markets. [37]\nAnother development in the mobile-phone market is the use of advertising in smartphone apps. Free\nversions of mobile-phone applications often include advertising to pay for the service. Popular apps such\nas WeatherBug and Angry Birds offer free versions with ads in the margins; however, users can avoid\nthese ads by paying a few dollars to upgrade to \u201cPro\u201d versions. Other apps such as Foursquare access a\nuser\u2019s geographic location and offer ads for businesses within walking distance. [38]\nFigure 12.9\nFree smartphone apps often contain ads to help pay for the service.\nGovernment Regulation of Advertising\nAdvertising regulation has played an important role in of advertising\u2019s history and cultural influence. One\nof the earliest federal laws addressing advertising was the Pure Food and Drug Law of 1906. A reaction to\npublic outcry over the false claims of patent medicines, this law required informational labels to be placed\non these products. It did not, however, address the questionable aspects of the advertisements, so it did\nnot truly delve into the issue of false advertising. [39]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n558 The Formation of the FTC\nFounded in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission became responsible for regulating false advertising\nclaims. Although federal laws concerning these practices made plaintiffs prove that actual harm was done\nby the advertisement, state laws passed during the early 1920s allowed prosecution of misleading\nadvertisements regardless of harm done. [40] The National Association of Attorneys General has helped\nstates remain an important part of advertising regulation. In 1995, 13 states passed laws that required\nsweepstakes companies to provide full disclosure of rules and details of contests. [41]\nDuring the Great Depression, New Deal legislation threatened to outlaw any misleading advertising, a\nresult of the burgeoning consumer movement and the public outcry against advertising during the\nperiod. [42] The reformers did not fully achieve their goals, but they did make a permanent mark on\nadvertising history. The 1938 Wheeler-Lea Amendment expanded the FTC\u2019s role to protect consumers\nfrom deceptive advertising. Until this point, the FTC was responsible for addressing false advertising\ncomplaints from competitors. With this legislation, the agency also became an important resource for the\nconsumer movement.\nTruth in Advertising\nIn 1971, the FTC began the Advertising Substantiation Program to force advertisers to provide evidence\nfor the claims in their advertisements. Under this program, the FTC gained the power to issue cease-and-\ndesist orders to advertisers regarding specific ads in question and to order corrective advertising. Under\nthis provision, the FTC can force a company to issue an advertisement acknowledging and correcting an\nearlier misleading ad. Regulations under this program established that supposed experts used in\nadvertisements must be qualified experts in their field, and celebrities must actually use the products they\nendorse. [43] In 2006, Sunny Health Nutrition was brought to court for advertising height-enhancing pills\ncalled HeightMax. The FTC found the company had hired an actor to appear as an expert in its ads and\nthat the pills did not live up to their claim. Sunny Health Nutrition was forced to pay $375,000 to\nconsumers for misrepresenting its product. [44]\nIn 1992, the FTC introduced guidelines defining terms such as biodegradable and recyclable. The growth\nof the environmental movement in the early 1990s led to an upsurge in environmental claims by\nmanufacturers and advertisers. For example, Mobil Oil claimed their Hefty trash bags were\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n559 biodegradable. While technically this statement is true, a 500- to 1,000-year decomposition cycle does not\nmeet most people\u2019s definitions of the term. [45] The FTC guidelines made such claims false by law. [46]\nRegulation of the Internet\nThe FTC has also turned its attention to online advertising. The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Act of 1998 was\npassed to prohibit companies from obtaining the personal information of children who access websites or\nother online resources. Because of the youth orientation of the Internet, newer advertising techniques\nhave drawn increasing criticism. Alcohol companies in particular have come under scrutiny. Beer\nmanufacturer Heineken\u2019s online presence includes a virtual city in which users can own an apartment and\nuse services such as email. This practice mirrors that of children\u2019s advertising, in which companies often\ncreate virtual worlds to immerse children in their products. However, the age-verification requirements to\nparticipate in this type of environment are easily falsified and can lead to young children being exposed to\nmore mature content.[47]\nConsumer and privacy advocates who are concerned over privacy intrusions by advertisers have also\ncalled for Internet ad regulation. In 2009, the FTC acted on complaints against Sears that resulted in an\ninjunction against the company for not providing sufficient disclosure. Sears offered $10 to consumers to\ndownload a program that tracked their Internet browsing. The FTC came down on Sears because the\ndownloaded software tracked sensitive information that was not fully disclosed to the consumer. Similar\nconsumer complaints against Facebook and Google for their consumer tracking have, at present, not\nresulted in FTC actions; however, the growing outcry makes new regulation of Internet advertising\nlikely. [48]\nAdvertising\u2019s Influence on Culture\nDiscussing advertising\u2019s influence on culture raises a long-standing debate. One opinion states that\nadvertising simply reflects the trends inherent in a culture, the other claims advertising takes an active\nrole in shaping culture. Both ideas have merit and are most likely true to varying degrees.\nAdvertising and the Rise of Consumer Culture\nGeorge Babbitt, the protagonist of Sinclair Lewis\u2019s 1922 novel Babbitt, was a true believer in the growing\nAmerican consumer culture:\nJust as the priests of the Presbyterian Church determined his every religious belief \u2026 so did the\nnational advertisers fix the surface of his life, fix what he believed to be his individuality. These\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n560 standard advertised wares\u2014toothpastes, socks, tires, cameras, instantaneous hot-water\nheaters\u2014were his symbols and proofs of excellence; at first the signs, and then the substitutes, for\njoy and passion and wisdom. [49]\nAlthough Lewis\u2019s fictional representation of a 1920s-era consumer may not be an actual person, it\nindicates the national consumer culture that was taking shape at the time. As it had always done,\nadvertising sought to attach products to larger ideas and symbols of worth and cultural values. However,\nthe rise of mass media and of the advertising models that these media embraced made advertising take on\nan increasingly influential cultural role.\nAutomobile ads of the 1920s portrayed cars as a new, free way of life rather than simply a means of\ntransportation. Advertisers used new ideas about personal hygiene to sell products and ended up breaking\ntaboos about public discussion of the body. The newly acknowledged epidemics of halitosis and body odor\nbrought about products such as mouthwash and deodorant. A Listerine campaign of the era transformed\nbad breath from a nuisance into the mark of a sociopath. [50] Women\u2019s underwear and menstruation went\nfrom being topics unsuitable for most family conversations to being fodder for the pages of national\nmagazines. [51]\nFigure 12.10\nAdvertisements for deodorants and other hygiene products broke social taboos about public discussion of hygiene.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n561 Creating the Modern World\nWorld War I bond campaigns had made it clear that advertising could be used to influence public beliefs\nand values. Advertising focused on the new\u2014making new products and ideas seem better than older ones\nand ushering in a sense of the modernity. In an address to the American Association of Advertising\nAgencies in 1926, President Coolidge went as far as to hold advertisers responsible for the \u201cregeneration\nand redemption of mankind.\u201d [52]\nUp through the 1960s, most advertising agencies were owned and staffed by affluent white men, and\nadvertising\u2019s portrayals of typical American families reflected this status quo. Mainstream culture as\npropagated by magazine, radio, and newspaper advertising was that of middle- or upper-class white\nsuburban families. [53] This sanitized image of the suburban family, popularized in such TV programs\nas Leave It to Beaver, has been mercilessly satirized since the cultural backlash of the 1960s.\nA great deal of that era\u2019s cultural criticism targeted the image of the advertiser as a manipulator and\npromulgator of superficial consumerism. When advertisers for Volkswagen picked up on this criticism,\nturned it to their advantage, and created a new set of consumer symbols that would come to represent an\nage of rebellion, they neatly co-opted the arguments against advertising for their own purposes. In many\ninstances, advertising has functioned as a codifier of its own ideals by taking new cultural values and\nturning them into symbols of a new phase of consumerism. This is the goal of effective advertising.\nApple\u2019s 1984 campaign is one of the most well-known examples of defining a product in terms of new\ncultural trends. A fledgling company compared to computer giants IBM and Xerox, Apple spent nearly $2\nmillion on a commercial that would end up only being aired once. [54] During the third quarter of the 1984\nSuper Bowl, viewers across the United States watched in amazement as an ad unlike any other at the time\nappeared on their TV screens. The commercial showed a drab gray auditorium where identical individuals\nsat in front of a large screen. On the screen was a man, addressing the audience with an eerily captivating\nvoice. \u201cWe are one people, with one will,\u201d he droned. \u201cOur enemies shall talk themselves to death. And we\nwill bury them with their own confusion. We shall prevail!\u201d [55] While the audience sat motionlessly, one\nwoman ran forward with a sledgehammer and threw it at the screen, causing it to explode in a flash of\nlight and smoke. As the scene faded out, a narrator announced the product. \u201cOn January 24, Apple\nComputer will introduce the Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like 1984.\u201d [56] With this\ncommercial, Apple defined itself as a pioneer of the new generation. Instead of marketing its products as\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n562 utilitarian tools, it advertised them as devices for combating conformity. [57] Over the next few decades,\nother companies imitated this approach, presenting their products as symbols of cultural values.\nIn his study of advertising\u2019s cultural impact, The Conquest of Cool, Thomas Frank compares the\nadvertising of the 1960s with that of the early 1990s:\nHow [advertisers] must have rejoiced when the leading minds of the culture industry announced\nthe discovery of an all-new angry generation, the \u201cTwenty-Somethings,\u201d complete with a panoply\nof musical styles, hairdos, and verbal signifiers ready-made to rejuvenate advertising\u2019s sagging\ncredibility\u2026. The strangest aspect of what followed wasn\u2019t the immediate onslaught of even\nhipper advertising, but that the entire \u201cGeneration X\u201d discourse repeated \u2026 the discussions of\nyouth culture that had appeared in Advertising Age, Madison Avenue, and on all those youth-\nmarket panel discussions back in the sixties. [58]\nTo be clear, advertisers have not set out to consciously manipulate the public in the name of consumer\nculture. Rather, advertisers are simply doing their job\u2014one that has had an enormous influence on\nculture.\nAdvertising Stereotypes\nThe white, middle-class composition of ad agencies contributed to advertisements\u2019 rare depictions of\nminority populations. DDB\u2014the agency responsible for the Volkswagen ads of the 1960s\u2014was an\nanomaly in this regard. One of its more popular ads was for Levy\u2019s rye bread. Most conventional\nadvertisers would have ignored the ethnic aspects of this product and simply marketed it to a mainstream\nwhite audience. Instead, the innovative agency created an ad campaign that made ethnic diversity a\nselling point, with spots featuring individuals from a variety of racial backgrounds eating the bread with\nthe headline \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be Jewish to love Levy\u2019s.\u201d\nDuring the 1950s, stereotypical images of African Americans promulgated by advertisers began to draw\ncriticism from civil rights leaders. Icons such as Aunt Jemima, the Cream of Wheat chef, and the Hiram\nWalker butler were some of the most recognizable black figures in U.S. culture. Unlike the African\nAmericans who had gained fame through their artistry, scholarship, and athleticism, however, these\nadvertising characters were famous for being domestic servants.\nDuring the 1960s, meetings of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) hosted civil\nrights leaders, and agencies began to respond to the criticisms of bias. A New York survey in the mid-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n563 1960s discovered that blacks were underrepresented at advertising agencies. Many agencies responded by\nhiring new African American employees, and a number of black-owned agencies started in the 1970s. [59]\nEarly advertising frequently reached out to women because they made approximately 80 percent of all\nconsumer purchases. Thus, women were well represented in advertising. However, those depictions\npresented women in extremely narrow roles. Through the 1960s, ads targeting women generally showed\nthem performing domestic duties such as cooking or cleaning, whereas ads targeting men often placed\nwomen in a submissive sexual role even if the product lacked any overt sexual connotation. A National Car\nRental ad from the early 1970s featured a disheveled female employee in a chair with the headline \u201cGo\nAhead, Take Advantage of Us.\u201d Another ad from the 1970s pictured a man with new Dacron slacks\nstanding on top of a woman, proclaiming, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a girl around the house.\u201d [60]\nAn advertising profile printed in Advertising Age magazine gave a typical advertiser\u2019s understanding of\nthe housewife at the time:\nShe likes to watch TV and she does not enjoy reading a great deal. She is most easily reached\nthrough TV and the simple down-to-earth magazines\u2026. Mental activity is arduous for her\u2026. She\nis a person who wants to have things she can believe in rather than things she can think about. [61]\nThe National Organization for Women (NOW) created a campaign during the early 1970s targeting the\nrole of women in advertisements. Participants complained about the ads to networks and companies and\neven spray-painted slogans on offensive billboards in protest.\nRepresentation of minorities and women in advertising has improved since the 1960s and 1970s, but it\nstill remains a problem. The 2010 Super Bowl drew one of the most diverse audiences ever recorded for\nthe event, including a 45 percent female audience. Yet the commercials remained focused strictly on men.\nAnd of 67 ads shown during the game, only four showed minority actors in a lead role. Despite the\nobvious economic benefit of diversity in marketing, advertising practices have resisted change. [62]\nAdvertising to Children\nThe majority of advertisements that target children feature either toys or junk food. Children under the\nage of 8 typically lack the ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and many advertisers use this\nto their advantage. Studies have shown that most children-focused food advertisements feature high-\ncalorie, low-nutrition foods such as sugary cereals. Although the government regulates advertising to\nchildren to a degree, the Internet has introduced new means of marketing to youth that have not been\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n564 addressed. Online video games called advergames feature famous child-oriented products. The games\ndiffer from traditional advertising, however, because the children playing them will experience a much\nlonger period of product exposure than they do from the typical 30-second television commercial. Child\nadvocacy groups have been pushing for increased regulation of advertising to children, but it remains to\nbe seen whether this will take place. [63]\nPositive Effects of Advertising\nAlthough many people focus on advertising\u2019s negative outcomes, the medium has provided unique\nbenefits over time. Early newspaper advertising allowed newspapers to become independent of church\nand government control, encouraging the development of a free press with the ability to criticize powerful\ninterests. When newspapers and magazines moved to an advertising model, these publications became\naccessible to large groups of people who previously could not afford them. Advertising also contributed to\nradio\u2019s and television\u2019s most successful eras. Radio\u2019s golden age in the 1940s and television\u2019s golden age in\nthe 1950s both took place when advertisers were creating or heavily involved with the production of most\nof the programs.\nAdvertising also makes newer forms of media both useful and accessible. Many Internet services, such as\nemail and smartphone applications, are only free because they feature advertising. Advertising allows\npromoters and service providers to reduce and sometimes eliminate the upfront purchase price, making\nthese services available to a greater number of people and allowing lower economic classes to take part in\nmass culture.\nAdvertising has also been a longtime promoter of the arts. During the Renaissance, painters and\ncomposers often relied on wealthy patrons or governments to promote their work. Corporate advertising\nhas given artists new means to fund their creative efforts. In addition, many artists and writers have been\nable to support themselves by working for advertisers. The use of music in commercials, particularly in\nrecent years, has provided musicians with notoriety and income. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the cultural\nlandscape of the United States without advertising.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Advertising has existed since ancient times but began to take on its modern form during the Age of\nExploration. By the 19th century, newspapers and magazines had begun printing advertising to generate\nneeded revenues.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n565 \uf0b7 Although many considered advertising to be lowbrow or immoral up to the early 20th century, it saw\ngreater acceptance after its use during World War I to encourage support for the war.\n\uf0b7 Up to the mid-20th century, advertising featured stereotypical affluent white families and was sale driven.\nCriticism of advertiser manipulation became the basis of a new style of advertising during the creative\nrevolution of the 1960s.\n\uf0b7 The rise of the Internet has caused print advertising revenues to decline but allows for personally\ntargeted ads. Such tracking practices have aroused concern from privacy groups.\n\uf0b7 The Federal Trade Commission is charged with ensuring that advertisements make verifiable claims and\ndo not overtly mislead consumers.\n\uf0b7 Advertising has infused American culture with mass images and ideas, creating a nation of consumers and\nshaping how people view themselves and others.\nEXERCISES\nPlease answer the following short-answer questions.

Describe the four models of public relations and the four stages of a typical public relations campaign.\n2. Analyze the role of public relations in media and culture.\n3. Analyze the ways public relations is taking the place of traditional advertising.\n4. Explain the concept of branding.\n5. Describe the uses of public relations in politics, government, and news media.\nWhereas advertising is the paid use of media space to sell something, public relations (PR) is the\nattempt to establish and maintain good relations between an organization and its\nconstituents. [1] Practically, PR campaigns strive to use the free press to encourage favorable\ncoverage. In their book The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR, Al and Laura Ries make the point\nthat the public trusts the press far more than they trust advertisements. Because of this, PR efforts\nthat get products and brands into the press are far more valuable than a simple advertisement. Their\nbook details the ways in which modern companies use public relations to far greater benefit than\nthey use advertising. [2]Regardless of the fate of advertising, PR has clearly come to have an\nincreasing role in marketing and ad campaigns.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n570 The Four Models of PR\nTable 12.1 Grunig and Hunt\u2019s Four PR Models\nType of Model Description Example\nTraditional publicity model Professional agents seek media Thong-clad actor Sacha Baron Cohen\n(the press agentry model) coverage for a client, product, promotes Bruno by landing in Eminem\u2019s lap at\nor event. the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\nPublic information model Businesses communicate Colleges send informational brochures to\ninformation to gain desired potential students; a company includes an\nresults. \u201cabout\u201d section on its website.\nPersuasive communication Organizations attempt to Public service announcements like the one\nmodel (the two-way persuade an audience to take a that shows \u201cyour brain\u201d and \u201cyour brain on\nasymmetric model) certain point of view. drugs.\u201d\nTwo-way symmetric model Both parties make use of a A company sends out customer satisfaction\nback-and-forth discussion. surveys; company Facebook groups and\nmessage boards.\nSource: James E. Grunig and Todd Hunt, Managing Public Relations (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth\nPublishing, 1984).\nTodd Hunt and James Grunig developed a theory of four models of PR. This model has held up in the\nyears since its development and is a good introduction to PR concepts. [3]\nTraditional Publicity Model\nUnder the traditional publicity model, PR professionals seek to create media coverage for a client,\nproduct, or event. These efforts can range from wild publicity stunts to simple news conferences to\ncelebrity interviews in fashion magazines. P. T. Barnum was an early American practitioner of this kind of\nPR. His outrageous attempts at publicity worked because he was not worried about receiving negative\npress; instead, he believed that any coverage was a valuable asset. More recent examples of this style of\nextreme publicity include controversy-courting musicians such as Lady Gaga and Marilyn Manson. More\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n571 restrained examples of this type of PR include the modern phenomenon of faded celebrities appearing on\ntelevision shows, such as Paula Abdul\u2019s long-running appearances on American Idol.\nPublic Information Model\nThe goal of the public information model is to release information to a constituency. This model is less\nconcerned with obtaining dramatic, extensive media coverage than with disseminating information in a\nway that ensures adequate reception. For example, utility companies often include fliers about energy\nefficiency with customers\u2019 bills, and government agencies such as the IRS issue press releases to explain\nchanges to existing codes. In addition, public interest groups release the results of research studies for use\nby policy makers and the public.\nPersuasive Communication: Two-Way Asymmetric\nThe persuasive communication model, or the two-way asymmetric, works to persuade a specific audience\nto adopt a certain behavior or point of view. To be considered effective, this model requires a measured\nresponse from its intended audience.\nFigure 12.12\nEdward Bernays created campaigns using the persuasive communication model.\nGovernment propaganda is a good example of this model. Propaganda is the organized spreading of\ninformation to assist or weaken a cause. [4] Edward Bernays has been called the founder of modern PR for\nhis work during World War I promoting the sale of war bonds. One of the first professional PR experts,\nBernays made the two-way asymmetric model his early hallmark. In a famous campaign for Lucky Strike\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n572 cigarettes, he convinced a group of well-known celebrities to walk in the New York Easter parade smoking\nLucky Strikes. Most modern corporations employ the persuasive communication model.\nTwo-Way Symmetric Model\nThe two-way symmetric model requires true communication between the parties involved. By facilitating\na back-and-forth discussion that results in mutual understanding and an agreement that respects the\nwishes of both parties, this PR model is often practiced in town hall meetings and other public forums in\nwhich the public has a real effect on the results. In an ideal republic, Congressional representatives strictly\nemploy this model. Many nonprofit groups that are run by boards and have public service mandates use\nthis model to ensure continued public support.\nCommercial ventures also rely on this model. PR can generate media attention or attract costumers, and it\ncan also ease communication between a company and its investors, partners, and employees. The two-way\nsymmetric model is useful in communicating within an organization because it helps employees feel they\nare an important part of the company. Investor relations are also often carried out under this model.\nPR Functions\nEither private PR companies or in-house communications staffers carry out PR functions. A PR group\ngenerally handles all aspects of an organization\u2019s or individual\u2019s media presence, including company\npublications and press releases. Such a group can range from just one person to dozens of employees\ndepending on the size and scope of the organization.\nPR functions include the following:\n\uf0b7 Media relations: takes place with media outlets\n\uf0b7 Internal communications: occurs within a company between management and employees, and among\nsubsidiaries of the same company\n\uf0b7 Business-to-business: happens between businesses that are in partnership\n\uf0b7 Public affairs: takes place with community leaders, opinion formers, and those involved in public\nissues\n\uf0b7 Investor relations: occurs with investors and shareholders\n\uf0b7 Strategic communication: intended to accomplish a specific goal\n\uf0b7 Issues management: keeping tabs on public issues important to the organization\n\uf0b7 Crisis management: handling events that could damage an organization\u2019s image [5]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n573 Anatomy of a PR Campaign\nFigure 12.13\nAnatomy of a PR campaign\nPR campaigns occur for any number of reasons. They can be a quick response to a crisis or emerging\nissue, or they can stem from a long-term strategy tied in with other marketing efforts. Regardless of its\npurpose, a typical campaign often involves four phases.\nInitial Research Phase\nThe first step of many PR campaigns is the initial research phase. First, practitoners identify and qualify\nthe issue to be addressed. Then, they research the organization itself to clarify issues of public perception,\npositioning, and internal dynamics. Strategists can also research the potential audience of the campaign.\nThis audience may include media outlets, constituents, consumers, and competitors. Finally, the context\nof the campaign is often researched, including the possible consequences of the campaign and the\npotential effects on the organization. After considering all of these factors, practitioners are better\neducated to select the best type of campaign.\nStrategy Phase\nDuring the strategy phase, PR professionals usually determine objectives focused on the desired goal of\nthe campaign and formulate strategies to meet those objectives. Broad strategies such as deciding on the\noverall message of a campaign and the best way to communicate the message can be finalized at this time.\nTactics Phase\nDuring the tactics phase, the PR group decides on the means to implement the strategies they formulated\nduring the strategy phase. This process can involve devising specific communication techniques and\nselecting the forms of media that suit the message best. This phase may also address budgetary\nrestrictions and possibilities.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n574 Evaluation Phase\nAfter the overall campaign has been determined, PR practitoners enter the evaluation phase. The group\ncan review their campaign plan and evaluate its potential effectiveness. They may also conduct research\non the potential results to better understand the cost and benefits of the campaign. Specific criteria for\nevaluating the campaign when it is completed are also established at this time.[6]\nExamples of PR Campaigns\nSince its modern inception in the early 20th century, PR has turned out countless campaigns\u2014some\nhighly successful, others dismal failures. Some of these campaigns have become particularly significant\nfor their lasting influence or creative execution. This section describes a few notable PR campaigns over\nthe years.\nDiamonds for the Common Man\nDuring the 1930s, the De Beers company had an enormous amount of diamonds and a relatively small\nmarket of luxury buyers. They launched a PR campaign to change the image of diamonds from a luxury\ngood into an accessible and essential aspect of American life. The campaign began by giving diamonds to\nfamous movie stars, using their built-in publicity networks to promote De Beers. The company created\nstories about celebrity proposals and gifts between lovers that stressed the size of the diamonds given.\nThese stories were then given out to selected fashion magazines. The result of this campaign was the\npopularization of diamonds as one of the necessary aspects of a marriage proposal. [7]\nBig Tobacco Aids Researchers\nFigure 12.14\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n575 In response to the increasing number of health concerns surrounding smoking, tobacco companies\nbegan running ads that argued the benefits of smoking their brand.\nIn 1953, studies showing the detrimental health effects of smoking caused a drop in cigarette sales. An\nalliance of tobacco manufacturers hired the PR group Hill & Knowlton to develop a campaign to deal with\nthis problem. The first step of the campaign Hill & Knowlton devised was the creation of the Tobacco\nIndustry Research Committee (TIRC) to promote studies that questioned the health effects of tobacco use.\nThe TIRC ran advertisements featuring the results of these studies, giving journalists who were\naddressing the subject an easy source to quote. The groups working against smoking were not familiar\nwith media relations, making it harder for journalists to quote them and use their arguments.\nThe campaign was effective, however, not because it denied the harmful effects of smoking but because it\nstressed the disagreements between researchers. By providing the press with information favorable to the\ntobacco manufacturers and publicly promoting new filtered cigarettes, the campaign aimed to replace the\nidea that smoking was undeniably bad with the idea that there was disagreement over the effects of\nsmoking. This strategy served tobacco companies well up through the 1980s.\nTaco Bell Targets Mir\nWhen the Russian space station Mir was set to crash land in the Pacific Ocean in 2001, Taco Bell created a\nfloating vinyl target that the company placed in the Pacific. Taco Bell promised to give every American a\nfree taco if the space station hit the target. This simple PR stunt gave all the journalists covering the\nMir crash landing a few lines to add to their stories. Scientists even speculated on the chances of the\nstation hitting the target\u2014slim to none. Ultimately, the stunt gained Taco Bell global advertising. [8]\nPR as a Replacement for Advertising\nIn some cases, PR has begun overtaking advertising as the preferred way of promoting a particular\ncompany or product. For example, the tobacco industry offers a good case study of the migration from\nadvertising to PR. Regulations prohibiting radio and television cigarette advertisements had an enormous\neffect on sales. In response, the tobacco industry began using PR techniques to increase brand presence.\nTobacco company Philip Morris started underwriting cultural institutions and causes as diverse as the\nJoffrey Ballet, the Smithsonian, environmental awareness, and health concerns. Marlboro sponsored\nevents that brought a great deal of media attention to the brand. For example, during the 1980s, the\nMarlboro Country Music Tour took famous country stars to major coliseums throughout the country and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n576 featured talent contests that brought local bands up on stage, increasing the audience even further.\nFavorable reviews of the shows generated positive press for Marlboro. Later interviews with country\nartists and books on country music history have also mentioned this tour.\nOn the fifth anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1987, Marlboro\u2019s PR groups organized a\ncelebration hosted by comedian Bob Hope. Country music legends the Judds and Alabama headlined the\nshow, and Marlboro paid for new names inscribed on the memorial. By attaching the Marlboro brand to\nsuch an important cultural event, the company gained an enormous amount of publicity. Just as\nimportantly, these efforts at least partially restored the stature that the brand lost due to health\nconcerns. [9]\nBranding\nWhile advertising is an essential aspect of initial brand creation, PR campaigns are vital to developing the\nmore abstract aspects of a brand. These campaigns work to position a brand in the public arena in order\nto give it a sense of cultural importance.\nShift From Advertising to PR\nPioneered by such companies as Procter & Gamble during the 1930s, the older, advertising-centric model\nof branding focused on the product, using advertisements to associate a particular branded good with\nquality or some other positive cultural value. Yet, as consumers became exposed to ever-increasing\nnumbers of advertisements, traditional advertising\u2019s effectiveness dwindled. The ubiquity of modern\nadvertising means the public is sceptical of\u2014or even ignores\u2014claims advertisers make about their\nproducts. This credibility gap can be overcome, however, when PR professionals using good promotional\nstrategies step in.\nThe new PR-oriented model of branding focuses on the overall image of the company rather than on the\nspecific merits of the product. This branding model seeks to associate a company with specific personal\nand cultural values that hold meaning for consumers. In the early 1990s, for example, car company Saturn\nmarketed its automobiles not as a means of transportation but as a form of culture. PR campaigns\npromoted the image of the Saturn family, associating the company with powerful American values and\ngiving Saturn owners a sense of community. Events such as the 1994 Saturn homecoming sought to\nencourage this sense of belonging. Some 45,000 people turned out for this event; families gave up their\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n577 beach holidays simply to come to a Saturn manufacturing plant in Tennessee to socialize with other\nSaturn owners and tour the facility.\nRecently Toyota faced a marketing crisis when it instituted a massive recall based on safety issues. To\ncounter the bad press, the company launched a series of commercials featuring top Toyota executives,\nurging the public to keep their faith in the brand. [10] Much like the Volkswagen ads half a century before,\nToyota used a style of self-awareness to market its automobiles. The positive PR campaign presented\nToyotas as cars with a high standard of excellence, backed by a company striving to meet customers\u2019\nneeds.\nStudies in Success: Apple and Nike\nApple has also employed this type of branding with great effectiveness. By focusing on a consistent design\nstyle in which every product reinforces the Apple experience, the computer company has managed to\nposition itself as a mark of individuality. Despite the cynical outlook of many Americans regarding\ncommercial claims, the notion that Apple is a symbol of individualism has been adopted with very little\nirony. Douglas Atkin, who has written about brands as a form of cult, readily admits and embraces his\nown brand loyalty to Apple:\nI\u2019m a self-confessed Apple loyalist. I go to a cafe around the corner to do some thinking and\nwriting, away from the hurly-burly of the office, and everyone in that cafe has a Mac. We never\nmention the fact that we all have Macs. The other people in the cafe are writers and professors\nand in the media, and the feeling of cohesion and community in that cafe becomes very apparent\nif someone comes in with a PC. There\u2019s almost an observable shiver of consternation in the cafe,\nand it must be discernable to the person with the PC, because they never come back.\nBrand managers that once focused on the product now find themselves in the role of community leaders,\nresponsible for the well-being of a cultural image.[11]\nKevin Roberts, the current CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi Worldwide, a branding-focused creative\norganization, has used the term \u201clovemark\u201d as an alternative to trademark. This term encompasses brands\nthat have created \u201cloyalty beyond reason,\u201d meaning that consumers feel loyal to a brand in much the same\nway they would toward friends or family members. Creating a sense of mystery around a brand generates\nan aura that bypasses the usual cynical take on commercial icons. A great deal of Apple\u2019s success comes\nfrom the company\u2019s mystique. Apple has successfully developed PR campaigns surrounding product\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n578 releases that leak selected rumors to various press outlets but maintain secrecy over essential details,\nencouraging speculation by bloggers and mainstream journalists on the next product. All this combines to\ncreate a sense of mystery and an emotional anticipation for the product\u2019s release.\nEmotional connections are crucial to building a brand or lovemark. An early example of this kind of\nbranding was Nike\u2019s product endorsement deal with Michael Jordan during the 1990s. Jordan\u2019s amazing,\nseemingly magical performances on the basketball court created his immense popularity, which was then\nfurther built up by a host of press outlets and fans who developed an emotional attachment to Jordan. As\nthis connection spread throughout the country, Nike associated itself with Jordan and also with the\nemotional reaction he inspired in people. Essentially, the company inherited a PR machine that had been\nbuilt around Jordan and that continued to function until his retirement.[12]\nBranding Backlashes\nAn important part of maintaining a consistent brand is preserving the emotional attachment consumers\nhave to that brand. Just as PR campaigns build brands, PR crises can damage them. For example, the\nmassive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 became a PR nightmare for BP, an oil company that had been\nusing PR to rebrand itself as an environmentally friendly energy company.\nIn 2000, BP began a campaign presenting itself as \u201cBeyond Petroleum,\u201d rather than British Petroleum,\nthe company\u2019s original name. By acquiring a major solar company, BP became the world leader in solar\nproduction and in 2005 announced it would invest $8 billion in alternative energy over the following 10\nyears. BP\u2019s marketing firm developed a PR campaign that, at least on the surface, emulated the forward-\nlooking two-way symmetric PR model. The campaign conducted interviews with consumers, giving them\nan opportunity to air their grievances and publicize energy policy issues. BP\u2019s website featured a carbon\nfootprint calculator consumers could use to calculate the size of their environmental impact. [13] The single\nexplosion on BP\u2019s deep-water oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico essentially nullified the PR work of the previous\n10 years, immediately putting BP at the bottom of the list of environmentally concerned companies.\nA company\u2019s control over what its brand symbolizes can also lead to branding issues. The Body Shop, a\ncosmetics company that gained popularity during the 1980s and early 1990s, used PR to build its image as\na company that created natural products and took a stand on issues of corporate ethics. The company\nteamed up with Greenpeace and other environmental groups to promote green issues and increase its\nnatural image.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n579 By the mid-1990s, however, revelations about the unethical treatment of franchise owners called this\nimage into serious question. The Body Shop had spent a great deal of time and money creating its\nprogressive, spontaneous image. Stories of travels to exotic locations to research and develop cosmetics\nwere completely fabricated, as was the company\u2019s reputation for charitable contributions. Even the origins\nof the company had been made up as a PR tool: the idea, name, and even product list had been ripped off\nfrom a small California chain called the Body Shop that was later given a settlement to keep quiet. The PR\ncampaign of the Body Shop made it one of the great success stories of the early 1990s, but the unfounded\nnature of its PR claims undermined its image dramatically. Competitor L\u2019Or\u00e9al eventually bought the\nBody Shop for a fraction of its previous value. [14]\nOther branding backlashes have plagued companies such as Nike and Starbucks. By building their brands\ninto global symbols, both companies also came to represent unfettered capitalist greed to those who\nopposed them. During the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, activists targeted Starbucks\nand Nike stores for physical attacks such as window smashing. Labor activists have also condemned Nike\nover the company\u2019s use of sweatshops to manufacture shoes. Eventually, Nike created a vice president for\ncorporate responsibility to deal with sweatshop issues. [15]\nBlackspot: The Anti-Brand Brand\nAdbusters, a publication devoted to reducing advertising\u2019s influence on global culture, added action to its\ncriticisms of Nike by creating its own shoe. Manufactured in union shops, Blackspot shoes contain\nrecycled tire rubber and hemp fabric. The Blackspot logo is a simple round dot that looks like it has been\nscribbled with white paint, as if a typical logo had been covered over. The shoes also include a symbolic\nred dot on the toe with which to kick Nike. Blackspot shoes use the Nike brand to create their own anti-\nbrand, symbolizing progressive labor reform and environmentally sustainable business practices. [16]\nFigure 12.16\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n580 Blackspot shoes developed as an anti-brand alternative to regular sneakers.\nRelationship With Politics and Government\nPolitics and PR have gone hand in hand since the dawn of political activity. Politicians communicate with\ntheir constituents and make their message known using PR strategies. Benjamin Franklin\u2019s trip as\nambassador to France during the American Revolution stands as an early example of political PR that\nfollowed the publicity model. At the time of his trip, Franklin was an international celebrity, and the\nfashionable society of Paris celebrated his arrival; his choice of a symbolic American-style fur cap\nimmediately inspired a new style of women\u2019s wigs. Franklin also took a printing press with him to produce\nleaflets and publicity notices that circulated through Paris\u2019s intellectual and fashionable circles. Such PR\nefforts eventually led to a treaty with France that helped the colonists win their freedom from Great\nBritain. [17]\nFamous 20th-century PR campaigns include President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Fireside Chats, a series of\nradio addresses that explained aspects of the New Deal. Roosevelt\u2019s personal tone and his familiarity with\nthe medium of radio helped the Fireside Chats become an important promotional tool for his\nadministration and its programs. These chats aimed to justify many New Deal policies, and they helped\nthe president bypass the press and speak directly to the people. More recently, Blackwater Worldwide, a\nprivate military company, dealt with criticisms of its actions in Iraq by changing its name. The new name,\nXe Services, was the result of a large-scale PR campaign to distance the company from associations with\ncivilian violence. [18]\nThe proliferation of media outlets and the 24-hour news cycle have led to changes in the way politicians\nhandle PR. The gap between old PR methods and new ones became evident in 2006, when then\u2013Vice\nPresident Dick Cheney accidentally shot a friend during a hunting trip. Cheney, who had been criticized in\nthe past for being secretive, did not make a statement about the accident for three days. Republican\nconsultant Rich Galen explained Cheney\u2019s silence as an older PR tactic that tries to keep the discussion\nout of the media. However, the old trick is less effective in the modern digital world.\nThat entire doctrine has come and gone. Now the doctrine is you respond instantaneously, and\nwhere possible with a strong counterattack. A lot of that is because of the Internet, a lot of that is\nbecause of cable television news. [19]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n581 PR techniques have been used in propaganda efforts throughout the 20th century. During the 1990s, the\ncountry of Kuwait employed Hill & Knowlton to encourage U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf region.\nOne of the more infamous examples of their campaign was a heavily reported account by a Kuwaiti girl\ntestifying that Iraqi troops had dumped babies out of incubators in Kuwaiti hospitals. Outrage over this\ntestimony helped galvanize opinion in favor of U.S. involvement. As it turned out, the Kuwaiti girl was\nreally the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador and had not actually witnessed any of the alleged\natrocities. [20]\nLobbyists also attempt to influence public policy using PR campaigns. The Water Environment\nFederation, a lobbying group representing the sewage industry, initiated a campaign to promote the\napplication of sewage on farms during the early 1990s. The campaign came up with the word biosolids to\nreplace the term sludge. Then it worked to encourage the use of this term as a way to popularize sewage as\na fertilizer, providing information to public officials and representatives. In 1992, the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency adopted the new term and changed the classification of biosolids to a fertilizer from a\nhazardous waste. This renaming helped New York City eliminate tons of sewage by shipping it to states\nthat allowed biosolids. [21]\nPolitical Branding\nPolitics has also embraced branding. Former President Bill Clinton described his political battles in terms\nof a brand war:\n[The Republicans] were brilliant at branding. They said they were about values\u2026. Everybody is a\nvalues voter, but they got the brand \u2026 they said they were against the death tax \u2026 what a great\nbrand\u2026. I did a disservice to the American people not by putting forth a bad plan, but by not\nbeing a better brander, not being able to explain it better. [22]\nBranding has been used to great effect in recent elections. A consistently popular political brand is that of\nthe outsider, or reform-minded politician. Despite his many years of service in the U.S. Senate, John\nMcCain famously adopted this brand during the 2008 presidential election. McCain\u2019s competitor, Barack\nObama, also employed branding strategies. The Obama campaign featured several iconic portraits and\nslogans that made for a consistent brand and encouraged his victory in 2008. Before Obama\u2019s\ninauguration in January 2009, an unprecedented amount of merchandise was sold, a further testament to\nthe power of branding. [23]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n582 Branding as a New Form of Communication\nThat so many different groups have adopted branding as a means of communication is a testament to its\nubiquity. Even anti-commercial, anti-brand groups such as Adbusters have created brands to send\nmessages. Social media sites have also encouraged branding techniques by allowing users to create\nprofiles of themselves that they use to communicate their core values. This personal application is\nperhaps the greatest evidence of the impact of advertising and PR on modern culture. Branding, once a\ntechnique used by companies to sell their products, has become an everyday means of communication.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The four models of PR include traditional publicity, public information, persuasive communication, and\ntwo-way symmetrical models.\n\uf0b7 PR campaigns begin with a research phase, develop objectives during a strategy phase, formulate ways to\nmeet objectives during the tactics phase, and assess the proposed campaign during the evaluation phase.\n\uf0b7 Branding focuses on the lifestyles and values inherent in a brand\u2019s image as opposed to the products that\nare manufactured. It can be quickly undone by PR crises such as the BP oil spill.\n\uf0b7 PR has always been an important part of political campaigning and activity. In recent years, branding has\nbecome an important part of national political campaigns.\nEXERCISES\nPlease answer the following short-answer questions.

Instead of buying materials and\nmanufacturing steel, Carnegie bought up mines, railways, and all other aspects of the industry, pioneering\na business model that later became known as vertical integration, in which a company owns both its\nsuppliers and buyers. Gathering, manufacturing, and delivering raw materials and finished goods all\nunder the control of a single corporation allowed Carnegie\u2019s profits to soar by cutting out the middleman\nand allowing him to drive the competition out of certain markets. A century later, this same strategy still\nworks; it may not drive industrialization, but its effects are just as powerful.\nIn late 2009, cable company Comcast announced a plan to purchase a controlling ownership stake in NBC\nUniversal to allow Comcast to join with NBC.[1] This multibillion-dollar deal would give Comcast a 51\npercent stake in the company, with present owners General Electric (GE) retaining control of the other 49\npercent. The proposed venture brought together all NBC Universal content\u2014including Universal Pictures\nand Focus Features; Spanish-language network Telemundo and the cable networks USA, Bravo, CNBC,\nand MSNBC\u2014with Comcast\u2019s cable channels, which include E! Entertainment, the Golf Channel, and the\nsports network Versus. Already one of the nation\u2019s largest cable and broadband Internet providers,\nComcast would then conceivably have the power to restrict these hugely popular NBC-owned networks to\nits own cable service, thus forcing consumers to adopt Comcast in order to watch them, or to charge huge\npremiums to competitors\u2019 cable subscribers for the channels, thereby making their own cable service\nmore desirable.\nThe most concerning\u2014or beneficial, for Comcast\u2014aspect of this merger is how it may integrate online\ncontent with traditional cable media. NBC Universal cofounded Hulu, the second-largest online video\nchannel in the United States. If Comcast sees ad-driven sites such as Hulu as a threat to its cable business,\nthen ownership over the online video portal would allow Comcast to restrict the site and all of NBC\u2019s\nonline content to its own cable subscribers. In effect, Comcast would be allowed to create a subscription\nmodel for Internet content, just as it sells subscriptions for cable content. For years, viewers have been\nable to pick and choose from a wide variety of sources, selecting only the online content that they want;\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n587 now, some fear that Comcast could bring the problems of a cable subscription\u2014hundred of channels but\nonly some worth watching\u2014to the Internet. [2]\nThis merger has the potential to reshape the way that mass media is produced and distributed to\nconsumers. When most Internet users subscribed to America Online (AOL), the company set up its own\nsite simply as a portal to other companies\u2019 content. The proposed integration of content producers and\nservice providers, however, allows for unprecedented control of Internet content. Net neutrality poses\nanother problem; Comcast could potentially grant its own content channels\u2014 such as a subscription-only\nversion of Hulu\u2014 privileges over competing channels. While this does not necessarily pose a problem\nwhen there is healthy competition, in many regions Comcast is the only provider of broadband Internet,\nthus raising concerns of a potential monopoly. No matter what happens with this particular merger, it\nseems that the economics of mass media are becoming even more tangled as the rapid rise of new\ntechnology threatens to transform or replace traditional media outlets.\n[1] Tim Arango, \u201cG.E.

Identify the three basic media business models.\n2. Identify the business models of several media industries.\n3. Describe the differences between the two ways in which media receives revenue.\nThe merger of Comcast and NBC is just one example of the myriad ways media companies do\nbusiness. Television, print publishing, radio broadcasting, music, and film all have their own\neconomic nuances and distinct models. However, these business models fall into three general\ncategories: monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition.\nOf these three basic media business models, monopoly is probably the most familiar.\nA monopoly occurs when one controls a product or service\u2014for example, a small town with only one\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n588 major newspaper. Oligopoly, or the control of a product or service by just a few companies,\ncommonly occurs in publishing; a few major publishers put out most best-selling books, and\nrelatively few companies control many of the nation\u2019s highest-circulating magazines. Television is\nmuch the same way, as the major broadcast networks\u2014Comcast and GE\u2019s NBC, Disney\u2019s ABC,\nNational Amusements\u2019s CBS, and News Corporation\u2019s Fox\u2014own nearly all broadcast and cable\noutlets. Finally, monopolistic competition takes place when multiple companies offer essentially the\nsame product or service. For example, Ticketmaster and Live Nation were longtime competitors until\nthey merged in 2010, with both providing basically the same set of event-management services for\nmusic and other live entertainment industries.\nThe last few decades have seen increasing conglomeration of media ownership, allowing for\neconomies of scale that previously could not be achieved. Instead of individual local radio stations\ncompeting for advertising revenue among a range of local companies, for example, large\ncorporations can now buy wholesale advertising for any or all of their brands on a dozen different\nradio stations in a single media market all owned by a conglomerate such as Clear Channel. The\neconomics of mass media has become a matter of macroeconomic proportions: GE now makes\neverything from jet engines to cable news. The implications of this go beyond advertising. Because\nmajor corporations now own nearly every media outlet, ongoing fears of corporate control of media\nmessaging have intensified.\nHowever, these fears are often channeled into productive enterprises. In many media industries, an\nongoing countercurrent exists to provide diversity not found in many corporate-owned models.\nIndependent radio stations such as those affiliated with nonprofit organizations and colleges provide\nnews and in-depth analysis as well as a variety of musical and entertainment programs that are not\nfound on corporate stations. Likewise, small music labels have had recent success promoting and\ndistributing music through online CD sales or digital distribution services such as iTunes appliance\nprogram. YouTube makes it easier for videographers to reach a surprisingly large market, often\nsurpassing even professional sites such as Hulu.\nRaising Revenue\nCompanies employ many different ways to raise revenue for their services, but all boil down to two\nfundamental ideas: The money comes either from consumers or from advertising. In practice, many\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n589 outlets combine the two to give themselves a flexible stream of income. Equally, consumers may be willing\nto pay slightly more for fewer ads, or to sit through more advertising in exchange for free content.\nTraditional book publishers, which make practically all of their money by selling their products directly to\nconsumers, lie on one extreme end of the spectrum. In some respects, cable companies use a related\nmodel under which they directly sell consumers the delivery and subscription of a bundled package of\nprogramming channels. However, cable channels primarily rely on a mix of media revenue models,\nreceiving funding from advertising along with subscription fees. Magazines and newspapers may fall into\nthis middle-ground category as well, although online classified advertising has caused print publications\nto lose this important revenue stream in recent years. Broadcast television is the clearest example of\nadvertising-driven income, as there are no subscription fees for these channels. Because this lack of direct\nfees increases the potential audience for the network, networks can sell their advertising time at a\npremium, as opposed to a cable channel with a more limited and likely more narrow viewership.\nPrint Media\nPrint media fall into three basic categories: books, newspapers, and magazines. The book publishing\nindustry is basically an oligopoly; the top 10 trade publishers made up 72 percent of the total market in\n2009, with the top five alone comprising 58 percent of this. [1] Newspapers tend toward local monopolies\nand oligopolies, as there are generally few local news sources. In the past classified advertising made up a\nsubstantial portion of newspaper revenue. However, the advent of the Internet\u2014particularly free\nclassified services such as Craigslist\u2014has weakened the newspaper industry through dwindling classified\nadvertising revenues.\nNewspapers\nThe newspaper industry also entails a mix of initial, or first copy costs, and relatively low marginal costs.\nJournalistic and editorial costs are relatively high, whereas the costs of newsprint and distribution are\nfairly low. The transition from the labor-intensive process of mechanical typesetting to modern electronic\nprinting greatly reduced the marginal costs of producing newspapers. However, the price of newsprint\nstill goes through cyclical ups and downs, making it difficult to price a newspaper in the long run.\nThe highest costs of publishing a paper remain the editorial and administrative overheads. Back-office\nactivities such as administration and finance can often be combined if a company owns more than one\npaper. Unlike the historical restrictions on broadcast media that limited the number of stations owned by\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n590 a single network, print media has faced no such ownership limits. Because of this, a company such as\nGannett has come to own USA Today as well as mostly local newspapers in 33 states, Guam, and the\nUnited Kingdom. [2] Other companies, such as McClatchy, also run their own wire services, partly as a way\nof reducing the costs of providing national journalism to many local markets.\nMagazines\nLike newspapers, magazines are largely owned by just a few companies. However, unlike newspapers,\nmany magazine chains are themselves owned by much larger media conglomerates. Time Warner\u2014the\nhighest-ranking media company in 2003\u2014owns numerous magazines, including Time, Fortune, and\nSports Illustrated. Taking all of its publications into account, Time Warner controls a 20 percent share of\nall magazine advertising in the United States. However, many smaller publishers produce niche\npublications, many of which do not aspire to a wider market. In all, magazines seem to be undergoing a\nperiod of economic decline, with a net loss of some 120 publications in 2009 alone. [3]\nTelevision and Radio\nAs discussed in Chapter 9 \"Television\", large media conglomerates own nearly all television networks.\nBoth national networks and local affiliates are typically owned by conglomerates; however, stations such\nas Fox-owned WNYW in New York or CBS-owned KCNC in Denver are able to mix local content with\nnational reporting and programming, much as large newspaper companies do.\nIn a local market, one cable company usually dominates the cable service market. In many places, one\ncable company, such as Comcast\u2014the largest of the cable companies\u2014is the only option. Over the past\nseveral years, however, satellite companies such as Dish Network and DirecTV, which are able to reach\nany number of consumers with limited local infrastructure, have introduced increased, albeit limited,\nlevels of competition.\nEven as cable is expanding, radio has become heavily consolidated. Since the 1990s, massive radio\nnetworks such as Clear Channel Communications have bought up many local stations in an effort to\ncontrol every radio station in a given media market. However, the FCC has designated the lower part of\nthe FM radio band for noncommercial purposes, including nonprofit programming such as educational,\nreligious, or public radio stations\u2014and continues to hold public discussion on frequency allocations.\nThese practices help retain a certain level of programming diversity in the face of increased\nhomogenization, largely because such stations are not supported through advertising. Because they are\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n591 funded by donations or nonprofit institutions, these stations benefit economically from catering to a\nminority of listeners who may support the station directly, rather than a larger majority that has other\noptions for entertainment.\nMusic and Film\nBecause both the music and film industries face unique business opportunities and challenges, each\noperates on an economic model unlike either print or broadcast media. Just like those forms of media,\nhowever, music and film have undergone significant changes due to consolidation and technological and\nconsumer shifts in recent years.\nThe Big Four\nThe music industry is closely related to the radio industry, and the two have a high degree of\ncodependence. Without music, radio would not be quite as lively or nearly as popular; without radio,\nmusic would be more difficult for listeners to discover, and perhaps be limited to a local consumer base.\nAs radio companies have consolidated, so has the music industry. A total of four record companies,\npopularly called the \u201cBig Four\u201d within the industry, dominate the recorded music business and thus most\nmainstream radio airwaves. Because a conglomerate such as Clear Channel is ill-equipped to handle local\ntastes and musical acts\u2014and because it tends to be easier to manage programming across a large regional\narea than on a station-by-station basis\u2014the Big Four record companies tend to focus on national and\ninternational acts. After all, if a label can convince a single radio conglomerate to play a particular act\u2019s\nmusic, that performer instantly gains access to a broad national market.\nMusic is therefore widely considered an oligopoly, despite the presence of countless small, independent\ncompanies. A handful of major record labels dominate the market, and they are all basically structured\nthe same way. Universal is owned by NBC, which was in turn owned by GE and now Comcast; Sony Music\nis owned by the eponymous Japanese technology giant; Warner Music Group, although now its own\nentity, was previously under the umbrella of Time Warner; and the EMI Group is owned by a private\ninvestment firm.\nConsolidation and Ticketing\nAlthough the Big Four dominate the recorded music industry, they have surprisingly little to do with live\nperformances. Traditionally, musicians have toured to promote their albums\u2014and sell enough copies to\npay off their advances\u2014and the live show was a combination of self-promotion and income. An artist\u2019s\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n592 record company provided financial support, but a concert ticket generated significantly more income per\nsale than a CD. Since the merger of ticketing companies Ticketmaster and Live Nation, the ticketing\nservices for large venues have practically been monopolized. For example, Madison Square Garden, one of\nthe largest venues in New York City, does not handle its booking in-house, and with good reason; the\ntechnology to manage tens of thousands of fans trying to buy tickets to a soon-to-be-sold-out concert the\nday they go on sale would likely break the system. Instead, Ticketmaster handles all of the ticketing for\nMadison Square Garden, adding a 10 percent to 20 percent fee to the face value of the ticket for its\nexclusive service, depending on the venue and price of the show.\nFilm\nBecause of the nature of film, the economics of the medium are slightly different from those of music. The\nabsence of film in broadcasting, the lack of a live performance, and the exponentially higher budgets are\njust some of its unique facets. As with music, however, large companies tend to dominate the market.\nThese massive studios are now connected corporately with other media outlets. For example, Sony and\nUniversal both have partners in the music industry, while Fox and Disney control major television\nbroadcast and cable networks as well as film studios.\nJust as record labels do with radio conglomerates, film distribution companies tend to sell to large chains,\nsuch as the over 6,000-screens-strong Regal Entertainment Group and the over 4,000-screens-strong\nAMC Entertainment, which have national reach. [4] However, independent filmmakers still provide limited\ncompetition to these larger studios.\nFrom Miramax to the Weinstein Company\nBrothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein founded Miramax in 1979 with the intention of independence. Over\nthe ensuing years, they released films that were off-limits to major distributors, such as Quentin\nTarantino\u2019s violent Reservoir Dogs and Steven Soderbergh\u2019s controversial Sex, Lies, and Videotape. After\nDisney bought the smaller studio in 1993, Miramax gained access to even larger financial backing, albeit\nsomewhat begrudgingly. Miramax had cultivated relationships with the now-blockbuster directors\nTarantino and Kevin Smith\u2014the director of Clerks, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\u2014and\nwhen Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction made more than $100 million at the box office within 2 years of Disney\u2019s\npurchase of Miramax, it seemed like a good deal. As a result, Disney signed the Weinsteins to a new\ncontract, giving them an annual budget of $700 million, and in 2003 Disney gave the Weinsteins\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n593 permission to raise additional hundreds of millions of dollars from Goldman Sachs in order to make even\nmore expensive movies. [5]\nBy 2004, however, relations between Miramax and Disney were turning sour. In May of that year, Disney\nwould not allow Miramax to release Michael Moore\u2019s incendiary documentary Fahrenheit 9/11. In\nresponse, the Weinsteins sought outside funding and released it themselves to great success; the film\nbecame the highest-grossing documentary of all time, with revenue of $222 million on a mere $6 million\nbudget. [6] A year later, the Weinsteins dissolved their relationship with Disney. Disney, however, kept the\nMiramax brand and the entire Miramax library of films.\nYet this fissure did not end the Weinsteins\u2019 careers. In 2005, the brothers founded a new independent film\ncompany, the Weinstein Co., which has had some success with films including Vicky Cristina\nBarcelona and The Queen, as well as the Michael Moore documentaries Sicko and Capitalism: A Love\nStory. However, when even independent film legends such as the Weinsteins have only limited success,\nit\u2019s clear that success is hard to come by. The A.V. Club\u2014a companion to the satirical newspaper the The\nOnion\u2014asked in January 2010, just after Disney closed Miramax for good, \u201cHow much longer will the\nstudio \u2018indie\u2019 model be viable at all?\u201d [7] Today, there are few true \u201cindie\u201d studios left, and several major\nstudios have closed their boutique studios, such as Warner Independent and Paramount Vantage. But\neven if some are questioning the economics of the indie-studio models of the 1980s and 1990s, it seems\nthat there will always be an artistic drive for independent film\u2014and, eventually, someone\u2019s bound to make\nthe economics of it work again.\nNew Media, Old Models\nIn many ways, the Internet has been a game-changer throughout the media industry. However, a few\nthings have stayed the same; major media companies own popular media content sites such as Hulu and\nYouTube and control access to a great deal of online information. Even bloggers, who have found a new\nrole as drivers of the media cycle, are at a disadvantage when it comes to the ability to generate original\ncontent. They tend to drive much of their traffic by reposting and adding commentary to news stories\nfrom established media outlets. One large and relatively influential outlet, the Drudge Report, is mainly\ncomposed of links to outside news organizations rather than original journalism. It gained fame during\nthe late 1990s for breaking the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky scandal\u2014albeit by posting about\nhow Newsweek killed reporter Michael Isikoff\u2019s story on the matter. [8] Still, the economic complications\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n594 of the Internet have changed the calculus of media permanently, a status made clear by the drastic\nincrease in free content over the past decade.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The three main media business models are monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition.\n\uf0b7 The print, recorded music, and film industries are generally oligopolies; television is generally\nmonopolistic competition; and live event ticketing is essentially a monopoly.\n\uf0b7 Media companies employ two main methods of generating revenue. Advertising builds income by selling\ntime or space where a viewer will see it. Consumers may also provide a direct revenue stream by\npurchasing a good or service.\nEXERCISES\nChoose a media outlet such as the Washington Post or CNN and visit its website to determine its parent\ncompany. Often this will be in the \u201cCorporate\u201d or \u201cAbout Us\u201d sections. Then visit the Columbia Journalism\nReview\u2019s resource \u201cWho Owns What?\u201d at http://www.cjr.org/resources/index.php. Consider and respond\nto the following questions:\n1. Into which of the three basic media business models does this media outlet fall?\n2. How does this media outlet employ each of the two ways that media receives revenue? Does it\nexclusively use one way or does it use a blend of the two?\n3. How large is the parent company of this media outlet? Does it own any other outlets?\n4. How might the parent company be using vertical integration to its advantage?\n5. Were there any surprises to what you found? Were there any corporate connections that you did not\nexpect to see?

Recognize the ways synergy is used on the Internet.\n2. Summarize the purpose and impact of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nThe challenge to media economics is one of production. When print media was the only widely\navailable media, the concept was simple: Sell newspapers, magazines, and books. Sales of these\ngoods could be gauged like any other product, although in media\u2019s case, the good was intangible\u2014\ninformation\u2014rather than the physical paper and ink. The transition from physical media to\nbroadcast media presented a new challenge, because consumers did not pay money for radio and,\nlater, television programming; instead, the price was an interruption every so often by a \u201cword from\nour sponsors.\u201d However, even this practice hearkened back to the world of print media; just as\nnewspapers and magazines sell advertising space, radio and television networks sell space on their\nairwaves.\nThe fundamental shift in Internet economics has been the miniscule price of online space compared\nto that in print or broadcast media. Combined with the instantaneous proliferation of information,\nthe Internet seems to pose a grave threat to traditional media. Media outlets have responded by\nestablishing themselves online, and it is now practically unheard of for any media company to lack\nan Internet presence. Companies\u2019 archives have opened up, and aside from a few holdouts such as\nthe Wall Street Journal, nearly every newspaper allows free online access, although some papers,\nlike The New York Times, are going to experiment with a paid subscription model to solve the\nproblem of dwindling revenues. Newspapers now offer video content online, and radio and television\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n596 networks have published traditional text-and-photo stories. Through Internet portals, media\ncompanies have synergized their content; they are no longer merely television networks or local\nnewspapers but instead are quickly moving to become a little bit of everything.\nOnline Synergy\nAlthough the Internet has had many effects on media economics, ranging from media piracy to the\nlowered costs of distribution, arguably the greatest effect has been the synergy of different forms of media.\nFor example, the front page of The New York Times website contains multiple short video clips, and the\nfront page of Fox News\u2019 website contains clips from the cable television network along with relevant\narticles written by FoxNews.com staff. Media outlets offer many of these services for free to consumers, if\nfor no other reason than because consumers have become accustomed to getting this content for free\nelsewhere on the Internet.\nThe Internet has also drastically changed the way that companies\u2019 advertising models operate. During the\nearly years of the Internet, many web ads were geared toward sites such as Amazon and eBay, where\nconsumers purchased products or services. Today, however, many ads\u2014particularly on sites for high-\nprofile media outlets such as Fox News and The New York Times\u2014are for products that are not typically\nbought online, such as cars or major credit cards. However, another category of advertising that is tailored\ntoward individual web pages has also gained prominence on the Internet. In this form of advertising,\nmarketers match advertisers with particular keywords on particular web pages. For example, if the page is\na how-to guide for fixing a refrigerator, some of the targeted ads might be for local refrigerator repair\nshops.\nInternet by Google\nSearch-engine company Google has been working to perfect this type of targeted advertising search. Low-\ncost text ads may appear next to its search results, on various web pages, and in the sidebar of its free\nweb-based email service, Gmail. More than just using algorithms to sort through massive amounts of data\nand matching advertising to content, Google has lowered the cost barrier to advertising, as well as the\nvolume barrier to hosting advertising. Because Google automatically matches sites with advertisers, an\nindependent site can sign up for its advertising service and get paid for each person who follows the text\nlinks. Likewise, relatively small companies can buy advertising space in specialized niches without having\nto go through a large-volume ad buyer. This business has proven extremely productive; the bulk of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n597 Google\u2019s revenue comes from advertising even as it gives away services such as email and document\nsharing.\nProblems of Digital Delivery\nSearch engines like Google and video-sharing sites like YouTube (which is owned by Google) allow access\nto online information, but they do not actually produce that information themselves. Thus, the propensity\nof these sites to gather information and then make it available to consumers free of charge does not\nnecessarily sit well with those who financially depend on the sale of this information.\nGoogle News\nOne of Google\u2019s more controversial projects is Google News, a news aggregator that automatically collects\nnews stories from various sources on the Internet. This service allows users to view the latest news from\nmany different sources conveniently in one location. However, the project has been met with opposition\nfrom a number of those news sources, who contend that Google has infringed on their copyrights and cost\nthem revenue. The Wall Street Journal has been one of the more vocal critics of Google News. In April\n2009, editor Robert Thomson said that news aggregators are \u201cbest described as parasites.\u201d [1]In December\n2009, Google responded to these complaints by allowing publishers to set a limit on the number of\narticles per day a reader can view for free through Google.\nMusic and File Sharing\nThe recent confrontation between Google and the traditional news media is only one of many problems\nresulting from digital technology. Digital technology can create exact copies of data so that one copy\ncannot be distinguished from the other. In other words, although a printed book might be nicer than a\nphotocopy of that book, a digitization of the book is exactly the same as all other digitized copies and can\nbe transmitted almost instantly. Similarly, although cassette tape copies of recorded music offered lower\nsound fidelity than the originals, the emergence of writable CD technology during the 1990s allowed for\nthe creation of a copy of a digital audio CD that was identical to the original.\nAs data storage and transmission costs dropped, CDs no longer had to be physically copied to other CDs.\nWith the advent of MP3 digital encoding, the music information on a CD could be compressed into a\nrelatively small, portable format that could be transmitted easily over the Internet, and music file sharing\ntook off. Although these recordings were not exactly the same as their CD-quality counterparts, most\nlisteners could not tell the difference\u2014or they just didn\u2019t care, because they were now able to share music\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n598 files conveniently and for free. The practice of transmitting music over the Internet through services such\nas Napster quickly ballooned.\nVideo Streaming\nAs high-bandwidth Internet connections proliferated, video-sharing and streaming sites such as YouTube\nstarted up. Although these sites were supposedly intended for users to upload and share their own\namateur videos, one of the big draws of the site was the high quantity of television show episodes, music\nvideos, and other commercial content that has been posted illegally. The replication potential inherent in\ndigital technology combined with online transmission has caused a sea change in media industries that\nrely on income directly from consumers, such as books and recorded music. However, as the next section\nwill show, the shift of media and information to the Internet can pose the risk of a digital divide, where\nthose without Internet access are at an even greater disadvantage than they were before.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)\nProducers of content are not without protection under the law. In 1998, Congress enacted\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in an effort to stop the illegal copying and distribution of\ncopyrighted material. The legislation defined many digital gray areas that previously may not have been\nexplicitly covered, such as circumventing antipiracy measures in commercial software; requiring\nwebcasters to pay licensing fees to record companies; and exempting libraries, archives, and some other\nnonprofit institutions from some of these rules under certain circumstances. Since 1998, this legislation\nhas been the bedrock of a variety of claims against sites such as YouTube. Under the law, copyright\nholders may send letters to Internet hosts distributing their copyrighted material. Certifying that they\nhave a good-faith belief that the host does not have prior permission to distribute the content, copyright\nholders may request a removal of that material from the site. [2]\nAlthough much of the law has to do with the rights of copyright holders to request the removal of their\nworks from unlicensed sites, much of the DMCA also enacts protections for Internet service providers\n(ISPs). Although before there had been some question as to whether ISPs could be charged with copyright\ninfringement merely for allowing reproductions to use their bandwidth, the DMCA made it clear that ISPs\nare not expected to police their own bandwidth for illegal use and are therefore not liable. Although the\nDMCA is not necessarily to everyone\u2019s liking\u2014requiring individual takedown notices is time-consuming\nfor corporations, and the relative lack of safeguards can allow large companies to bully ISPs into shutting\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n599 down smaller sites, given a good-faith notice\u2014the protections and clarifications that it has created have\ncleared up some of the confusion surrounding digital media. [3] However, as the price of bandwidth\ndrastically drops and as more media goes digital, copyright laws will inevitably need to be amended again.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The Internet has allowed media companies to synergize their content, broadcasting the same ideas and\nproducts across multiple platforms. This significantly helps with reducing relative first copy costs because\nthe Internet\u2019s marginal costs are minimal.\n\uf0b7 The DMCA exempts Internet service providers from liability in policing their own services for illegal\ndownloads. However, it also enacts copyright protection for digital media, thereby allowing copyright\nholders to send takedown notices. As long as they profess a good-faith belief that the works were not\nused with permission, the recipient is generally required to take them down.\nEXERCISES\nNavigate to a traditional media outlet\u2019s online portal, such as NYTtimes.com orFoxNews.com. Print out a\nhard copy of the home page and write on it, or save it to your computer and open it in a document editor\nsuch as Microsoft Word to annotate it. Note items such as these:\n1. Are there any media formats on the page aside from the outlet\u2019s normal ones? Why might this\ntraditional media outlet choose to produce different media formats on the Internet?\n2. Does the media outlet promote its other products? If so, how? How does the Internet enable this type\nof synergy?\n3. What types of personalization options are there?

Identify ways that digital communication is changing international economics, particularly in developing\ncountries.\n2. Identify difficulties that face those without adequate Internet access in developed countries.\n3. Evaluate the relative success of various plans for closing the \u201cdigital divide.\u201d\nMore than just a tool for information transfer, the Internet has become a conduit for a globalized\nworkforce. A corporation in New York can outsource electronically based work to a highly connected\ndeveloping country like India without incurring the sort of shipping charges or communication\ndelays that previously impeded such efforts. Internet access, particularly for business, has made\ndevelopment possible in remote areas, allowing corporations access to less expensive labor and\nallowing money to flow into developing countries. However, as the Internet has become integrated\ninto daily business life, adigital divide has emerged: Some derive the benefits from Internet access,\nbut many others do not.\nMany U.S. and international leaders and nongovernmental organizations have identified the digital\ndivide as an area of concern. A globalized workforce does not separate the world into easily divisible\npolitical territories but rather into those that have useful access to technology to reach a wider\nmarket and those that do not. As the 21st century develops, worldwide communication has become\nincreasingly imperative for a healthy economy, creating a new challenge to make sure that rapid\ntechnological changes do not preclude economic success for less developed economies.\nHowever, the problem extends beyond simple access or even competency. The80/20 effect, under\nwhich 80 percent of profit is created for the most affluent 20 percent, exacerbates the digital divide.\nIn other words, the Internet\u2014created in large part by and for the rich\u2014is practically useless for the\npoor, particularly in developing countries. Thus, bridging the digital divide is about helping those\nwith little or no access to the digital world gain the ability to use technology in economically\nadvantageous ways.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n601 The Informational Shift\nAs information and media move online, those without ready access to the Internet are increasingly being\nleft behind. Even in developed countries such as the United States, the digital divide is readily apparent.\nOften, older and less educated workers do not have computer skills or home Internet access. In June\n2009, the Pew Research Center studied the demographic differences in broadband Internet adoption and\nfound that 45 percent of those without Internet access were age 65 and over. [1] Even more significantly, a\nquarter of the unconnected were between the ages of 50 and 64. These workers are at a distinct\ndisadvantage when it comes to finding and being hired for jobs.\nAs classified advertisements and job postings have left newspapers for the web, Internet access has\nbecome vital to even finding a job to apply for. In the previously mentioned Pew survey, 20 percent of\nrespondents had incomes of less than $20,000 per year. However, these 20 percent made up a\ndisproportionately high 48 percent of the survey\u2019s non-Internet users; a full 64 percent of low-income\nsurvey participants did not have access to the Internet. These numbers drastically dropped as wages\nincreased\u2014while those making under $40,000 per year made up 80 percent of non-Internet users, those\nmaking over $50,000 made up 50 percent of high-speed Internet users. As the Internet is becoming an\nintegral part of our daily lives, a lack of access among certain groups could severely hamper upward\neconomic mobility.\nComputer Skills and Older Workers\nAccess to the Internet is an essential aspect of many successful job hunts, but it is also important to\nconsider computer skills themselves. Many older adults who grew up without the Internet lack the\ncomputer and technology skills that contemporary jobs require. MSNBC reported in October 2009 that\nunemployment rates for older workers were at a 60-year high, having doubled in the period between late\n2007 and the fall of 2009. [2] While the overall unemployment rate at that time had reached a 26-year\nhigh, older workers who lacked the skills of younger, computer-savvy adults were suffering\ndisproportionately. Lack of computer skills can be a crippling impediment to job success, even if a person\ncan find a job in difficult economic times.\nIn response to these challenges, libraries and other nonprofit groups have taken on the task of training\nolder unemployed workers to effectively use the Internet for job-related needs. These training courses,\nbeginning with turning on a computer and using the mouse and ranging into advanced office program\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n602 use, seek to provide skills necessary to allow older workers to reenter the work force. These organizations\nalso aim to show users that they can increase their quality of life by setting up email for communication\nwith friends and family members.\nThe Digital Divide Abroad\nWhile the digital divide in the United States is largely a matter of education, cost barrier, and lack of\nadoption of new technology, the digital divide in economically underdeveloped countries adds the\ncomplication of infrastructure. Internet service requires the existence of widespread stable networks to\nhandle large computer centers, and electronic access to the outside world needs a constant data\nconnection. Therefore, in many developing countries, practically no residents have access to computers\nand the Internet; this cuts them off not only from information but from the entire global economy.\nTable 13.1 Internet Connectivity by Country\nCountry Population (millions) Internet users (millions) Percent connected\nChina 1,330 298 22\nIndia 1,173 81 7\nUnited States 310 231 75\nIndonesia 243 30 12\nBrazil 201 65 32\nJapan 127 91 72\nAfghanistan 29 0.5 2\nMongolia 3.1 0.3 10\nSource: CIA World Factbook, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ (accessed\nJuly 27, 2011).\nThe Digital Divide Institute has launched a campaign to integrate Indonesia into the global digital\nnetwork as a representative solution to this problem. Indonesia is the world\u2019s fourth-largest country in\nterms of population and already has wide cell-phone coverage\u2014a significant advantage when it comes to\nrural information access. [3] The organization claims that by expanding these wireless communication\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n603 networks to encompass 3G and high-speed Internet access, access to the Internet could rise so much that\nIndonesia could become a fully emerging market for global services. To put this in perspective, connecting\n20 percent of Indonesians to the Internet brings the total connected population of Indonesia to 48 million\nusers, equivalent to all of South Korea, one of the most connected countries in the world. [4] The economic\nand political benefits of widespread Internet connectivity to nations like Indonesia are huge. The Digital\nDivide Institute points to Ireland as an example of how increasingly high-tech jobs can accompany the\ndecline of terrorism\u2014evidence that bridging the digital divide can be an issue of international security as\nwell as global prosperity.\nThe Bottom Billion\nOne contentious issue in bridging the digital divide is which billion to focus on\u2014of the 6.8 billion people\nin the world, only an estimated 1.6 billion are connected to the Internet. [5] Therefore, the discussion of\nbridging the digital divide is quickly complicated by this question: To whom should we build the bridge?\nWhile some organizations such as the Digital Divide Institute suggest that the global \u201cpyramid\u201d should\nfocus on the next billion\u2014countries such as Indonesia with wide cell-phone coverage but little access to\nuseful, global digital technology. Other organizations see it differently.\nFigure 13.4\nThe One Laptop per Child project aims to put one of these XO computers in the hands of many children in\ndeveloping countries.\nMany believe that everyone in the world can benefit from technology if it is deployed properly. The\norganization One Laptop per Child (OLPC) seeks to achieve exactly what its name implies with a low-cost\ndesign that runs on free software and requires very little energy. [6] Central to OLPC\u2019s goal is the idea that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n604 learning to use technology needs to be recalibrated toward learning through technology. Another crucial\nidea is the organization\u2019s conception of networks as essentially localized with the potential to be\nexpanded. OLPC\u2019s XO laptop connects to its neighbors, creating many small networks through a fairly\nwide wireless range. In addition, its ability to access the Internet through this wide wireless range allows\nremote educational opportunities for children in developing countries. Although it may seem to leap\ndirectly from no communication access to wireless Internet video streaming, this program has shown that\nit may even be more cost effective than traditional connective technologies like phone lines.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Digital communication allows workers in developing countries with adequate infrastructure to perform\nremote computer tasks.\n\uf0b7 Those without Internet access are essentially left out of much of the new economy. A lack of computer\nskills or Internet access can make it very difficult to find jobs. Computer skills are required for many jobs,\nso a lack of those skills may restrict someone to low-paying work.\n\uf0b7 The plan to close the digital divide for the next billion people unconnected to the Internet effectively\ncapitalizes on existing resources; however, plans such as the One Laptop per Child project work to provide\na comprehensive hardware and software solution for everyone who lacks Internet access.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

Determine how switching costs influence the information economy.\n2. Summarize the tenets of the three major founding pieces of antitrust legislation.\n3. Determine how a company might use vertical integration.\nThe modern theory of the information economy was expressed in the 1998 publication of Information\nRules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy, written by Cal Shapiro, an economics professor at\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, and Hal Varian, now chief economist at Google. Their\nfundamental argument was simple: \u201cTechnology changes. Economic laws do not.\u201d [1]\nWhile economic laws may not change, the fundamentals of the business of information are far\ndifferent from the fundamentals of most traditional businesses. For example, the cost of producing a\nsingle sandwich is relatively consistent, per sandwich, with the cost of producing multiple\nsandwiches. As discussed in Section 13.1 \"Characteristics of Media Industries\", information works\ndifferently. With a newspaper, the first copy costs are far higher than the marginal costs of secondary\ncopies. The high first costs and low marginal costs of the information economy contribute very\nheavily to the potential for large corporations gaining dominance. The confluence of these two costs\ncreates a potential economy of scale, favoring the larger of the competitors.\nIn addition, information is what economists refer to as an experience good, meaning that consumers\nmust actually experience the good to judge its value. The problem with information is that the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n606 experience is the good; how do you know, for example, that a movie has high-quality acting and an\ninteresting plot before you\u2019ve watched it? The solution to this is branding, which was discussed\nin Chapter 12 \"Advertising and Public Relations\". Although it may be difficult to judge a movie before\nwatching, knowing that a given film was made by a certain director or stars an actor you like\nincreases its value. Marketers use movie trailers, press coverage, and other marketing tools to\ncommunicate this branding message in the hopes of convincing you to watch the films they are\npromoting.\nAnother important facet of information technology is the associated switching costs. When\neconomists consider switching costs, they take into account the difference between the cost of one\ntechnology and the cost of another. If this difference is less than the cost it would take to switch\u2014for\ninformation, the cost of moving all of the relevant data to the new technology\u2014then it is deemed\npossible to switch. A classic example is moving a music collection from vinyl LPs to CDs. For a\nconsumer to switch systems\u2014that is, to buy a CD player and stereo\u2014that person would also have to\nrebuild his or her entire music collection with the new format. Luckily for the CD player, the increase\nin convenience and quality was great enough that most consumers were inclined to switch\ntechnologies; however, as is apparent to anyone going to a thrift store or garage sale, old technologies\nare still being used because the information on the records was important enough for some people to\nkeep them around.\nRegulation of the Information Economy\nAlthough Chapter 15 \"Media and Government\" will discuss government regulation in greater depth, a\nbasic understanding of the interaction between government and media over time is essential to\nunderstanding the modern information economy. Public policy and governmental intervention exacerbate\nan already complicated system of information economics, but for good reason\u2014unlike typical goods and\nservices, the information economy has many significant side effects. The consequences of one hamburger\nchain outcompeting or buying up all other hamburger chains would surely be fairly drastic for the\nhamburger-loving world, but not altogether disastrous; there would be only one type of hamburger, but\nthere would still be many other types of fast food remaining. On the contrary, the consequences of\nmonopolization by one media company could be alarming. Because distributed information can influence\npublic policy and public opinion, those in charge of the government have an interest in ensuring fair\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n607 distribution of that information. The bias toward free markets has been mitigated\u2014even in the United\nStates\u2014when it comes to the information economy.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is largely responsible for this regulation. Established by\nthe Communications Act of 1934, the FCC is charged with \u201cregulating interstate and international\ncommunications\u201d for nearly every medium except for print. [2] The FCC also attempts to maintain a\nnonpartisan, or at least bipartisan, outlook, with a maximum of three of its five commissioners belonging\nto the same political party. Although the FCC controls many important things\u2014making sure that\nelectronic devices don\u2019t emit radio waves that interfere with other important tools, for example\u2014some of\nits most important and most contentious responsibilities relate to the media.\nAs the guardian of the public interest, the FCC has called for more competition among media companies;\nfor example, the ongoing litigation of the merger between Comcast and NBC is not concerned with\nwhether consumers will like streaming Hulu over the Internet, but rather whether one company should\nown both the content and the mode of distribution. The public good is not served if consumers\u2019 ability to\nchoose is taken away when a service provider like Comcast restricts access to only the content that the\nprovider owns, especially if that service provider is the consumers\u2019 only choice. In other words, the idea of\npublic good is concerned not with the end result of competition, but with its process. The FCC protects\nconsumers\u2019 ability to choose from a wide variety of media products, and the competition among media\nproducers hopefully results in better products for consumers. If the end result is that all customers choose\nHulu anyway, either because it has the shows they like or because it offers the best video-streaming\ncapability, then the process has worked to create the best possible model; there was a winner, and it was a\nfair fight.\nA Brief History of Antitrust Legislation\nThe main tool that the government employs to keep healthy competition in the information marketplace\nis antitrust legislation. The seminal Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 helped establish modern U.S. antitrust\nlegislation. Although originally intended to dissolve the monopolistic enterprises of late-19th-century\nindustrialists such as Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, the law\u2019s basic principles have applied to\nmedia companies as well. The antitrust office has also grown since the original Sherman Act; although the\noffice of the attorney general originally brought antitrust lawsuits after the act\u2019s passage, this\nresponsibility shifted to its own Antitrust Division in 1933 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n608 The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 outlined many propositions and goals that legislators deemed\nnecessary to foster a competitive marketplace. For example, Chapter 1, Section 2, of the act states that\n\u201cEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other\nperson or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States \u2026 shall be\ndeemed guilty of a felony.\u201d [3] This establishment of monopolization as a felony was remarkable; before,\nfree-market capitalism was the rule regardless of the public good, making the Sherman Antitrust Act an\nearly proponent of the welfare of people at large.\nTwo additional pieces of legislation, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1911 and the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950,\nrefined the Sherman Antitrust Act in order to make the system of antitrust suits work more effectively.\nFor instance, the Clayton Act makes it unlawful for one company to \u201cacquire \u2026 the whole or any part of\nthe stock\u201d of another company when the result would encourage the development of a monopoly. [4] More\nthan just busting trusts, the Clayton Act thus seeks to stop anticompetitive practices before they take hold.\nThe Celler-Kefauver Act made it more difficult for corporations to get around antitrust legislation; while\nthe Clayton Act allowed the government to regulate the purchase of a competitor\u2019s stock, the Celler-\nKefauver Act extended this to include the competitor\u2019s assets.\nDeregulation and the Telecommunications Act of 1996\nAlthough the early part of the 20th century seemed to be devoted to breaking up trusts and keeping\nmonopolies in check, the media\u2014particularly in the latter part of the century\u2014was still able to move\nsteadily toward conglomeration (companies joining together to form a larger, more diversified\ncorporations). Widespread deregulation (the removal of legal regulations on an industry) took place\nduring the 1980s, in large part through the efforts of free-market economists who argued that\nderegulation would foster more competition in the information marketplace. However, possibly due in\nlarge part to the media economy\u2019s focus on economies of scale, this was not the case in practice.\nCompanies became increasingly conglomerated, and corporations such as Comcast and Time Warner\ncame to dominate the marketplace. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 helped solidify this trend.\nAlthough touted as a way to let \u201cany communications business compete in any market against any other\u201d\nand to foster competition, this act in practice sped up the conglomeration of media. [5]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n609 Media Conglomerates and Vertical Integration\nThe extension of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 of corporate abilities to vertically integrate was a\nprimary driving factor behind this increased conglomeration. Vertical integration has proven particularly\nuseful for media companies due to their high first costs and low marginal costs. For example, a television\ncompany that both produces and distributes content can run the same program on two different channels\nfor nearly the same cost as only broadcasting it on one. Because of the localized nature of broadcast\nmedia, two broadcast television channels will likely reach different geographical areas. This results in cost\nsavings for the company, but also somewhat decreases local diversity in media broadcasting.\nIn fact, the Telecommunications Act made some changes in authority for these local markets. The concept\nof Section 253 is that no state may prohibit \u201cthe ability of any entity to provide any interstate or intrastate\ntelecommunications service.\u201d [6] Thus, since state and local governments cannot prohibit any company\nfrom entering into a marketplace, there are checks on the amount of a local market that any one company\ncan reach. In addition, the Telecommunications Act capped the share of U.S. television audience for any\none company at 35 percent. However, the passage of additional legislation in 1999 allowing any one\ncompany to own two television stations in a single market greatly diluted the effect of this initial ruling.\nAlthough CBS, NBC, and ABC may be declining in popularity, they \u201cstill offer the only means of reaching a\ngenuinely mass television audience\u201d in the country. [7]\nCorporate Advantages of Vertical Integration\nAlmost all of the major media players in today\u2019s market practice extensive vertical integration through\neither administrative management or content integration. Administrative management refers to the\npotential for divisions of a single company to share the same higher-level management structure, which\npresents opportunities for increased operational efficiency. For example, Disney manages theme parks\nand movie studios. Although these two industries are not very closely connected through content, both are\nlarge, multinational ventures. Placing both of these divisions under a single corporation allows them to\nshare certain structural similarities, accounting practices, and any other administrative resources that\nmay be helpful across multiple industries.\nContent integration\u2014an important practice for media industries\u2014is the ability of these companies to use\nthe same content across multiple platforms. Disney\u2019s theme parks would lose much of their charm and\nmeaning without Mickey Mouse and Cinderella\u2019s castle; the integration of these two industries\u2014Disney\u2019s\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n610 theme parks and Disney\u2019s animated characters\u2014proves profitable for both. Behind the scenes, Disney is\nalso able to reap some excellent benefits from their consolidation. For example, Disney could release a\nmovie through its studio, and then immediately book the stars on news programs that air on Disney-\nowned broadcast television network ABC. Beyond just the ABC broadcast network, Disney also has many\ncable channels that it can use to directly market its movies and products to the targeted demographics.\nUnlike a competitor that might be wary of promoting a Disney movie, Disney\u2019s ownership of many\ndifferent media outlets allows it to single-handedly reach a large audience.\nEthical Issues of Vertical Integration\nHowever, this high level of vertical integration raises several ethical concerns. In the above situation, for\nexample, Disney could entice reviewers on its television outlets to give positive reviews to a Disney studio\nmovie. Therefore, this potential for misused trust and erroneous information could be harmful.\nIn many ways, the conglomeration of media companies takes place behind the scenes, with only a\nminority of consumers aware of vertically integrated holdings. Media companies often try to foster a sense\nof independence from a larger corporation. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule; the NBC sitcom30\nRock often delves into the troubles of running a satirical sketch-comedy show (a parody of\nNBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live) under the ownership of GE, NBC\u2019s real-life owner.\nThe Issues of the Internet\nAlthough media companies are steadily turning into larger businesses than ever before, many of them\nhave nevertheless fallen on hard times. The instant, free content of the Internet is largely blamed for this\ndecline. From the shift of classified advertising from newspapers to free online services to the decline in\nphysical music sales in favor of digital downloads, the Internet has transformed traditional media\neconomics.\nOne of the main issues with an unregulated Internet is that it allows digital files to be replicated and sent\nanywhere else in the world. Large music companies, which traditionally made almost all of their money\nfrom selling physical music formats such as vinyl records or compact discs, find themselves at a\ndisadvantage. Consumers can share and distribute music files to anyone, and Internet service providers\nare exempted from liability under the DMCA. With providers freed of liability and media consumption a\ndriving factor in the rise of high-speed Internet services, ISPs have no incentive to deter illegal sharing\nalong with legal downloads.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n611 Digital Downloads and DRM\nAlthough music companies have had some success selling music through digital outlets, they have not\nbeen pioneers in online music sales. Rather, technology companies such as Apple and Amazon.com,\nsensing a large market for digital downloads coupled with a sleek delivery system, have led the way.\nAlready accustomed to downloading MP3s, consumers readily adopted the model. However, record\ncompanies believed that the lack of digital rights management (DRM) protection offered by MP3s\nrepresented a major downside.\nApple provided a way to strike a compromise between accessibility and rights control. Having already\ncaptured much of the personal digital audio player market with the iPodthat uses other Apple products,\nApple has also long prided itself on creating highly integrated systems of both software and hardware.\nBecause so many people were already using the iPod, Apple had a huge potential market for a music store\neven if it offered DRM-locked tracks that would only play on Apple devices. This inflexibility even offered\na small benefit for consumers; Apple succeeded in convincing companies to price their digital downloads\nlower than CDs.\nThis compromise may have sold a lot of iPods and MP3s, but it did not satisfy the record companies.\nWhen consumers started to download one hit single for 99 cents\u2014rather than buying the whole album for\n$15 on CD\u2014the music industry felt the pain. Still, huge monetary advances in digital music have taken\nplace. Between 2004 and 2008, digital music sales increased from $187 million to $1.8 billion.\nPiracy\nThe music industry has wasted no amount of firepower to blame piracy for the decline in album sales:\n\u201cThere\u2019s no minimizing the impact of illegal file-sharing. It robs songwriters and recording artists of their\nlivelihoods, and it ultimately undermines the future of music itself,\u201d said Cary Sherman, president of the\nRecording Industry Association of America. [8] However, economists see the truth of the matter as\nsignificantly more ambiguous. Analyzing over 10,000 weeks of data distributed over many albums, a pair\nof economists at the Harvard Business School and University of North Carolina found that \u201cDownloads\nhave an effect on sales which is statistically indistinguishable from zero.\u201d [9] Either way, two things are\nclear: Consumers are willing to pay for digital music, and digital downloads are on the market to stay for\nthe foreseeable future.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n612 \uf0b7 Switching costs and economies of scale play major roles in the information economy. The former helps\ndetermine whether a new technological format will take hold, and the latter encourages the growth of\nlarge media conglomerates.\n\uf0b7 The three founding pieces of antitrust legislation were the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), which laid the\nfoundation of antitrust legislation; the Clayton Antitrust Act (1911), which allowed the government to\nregulate purchase of a company\u2019s stock; and the Celler-Kefauver Act (1950), which allowed the\ngovernment to regulate the purchase of another company\u2019s assets.\n\uf0b7 Vertical integration occurs when a company controls all aspects of an industry: procuring raw materials,\nmanufacturing, and delivering. Media companies benefit from vertical integration, but the practice raises\nnumerous ethical issues.\nEXERCISES\nVisit the Columbia Journalism Review\u2019s \u201cWho Owns What?\u201d web page\nathttp://www.cjr.org/resources/index.php.

Identify three ways that technology has helped speed globalization.\n2. Explain how media outlets employ globalization to their advantage.\n3. Describe some advances that can be made in foreign markets.\nThe media industry is, in many ways, perfect for globalization, or the spread of global trade without\nregard for traditional political borders. As discussed earlier, the low marginal costs of media mean\nthat reaching a wider market creates much larger profit margins for media companies. Because\ninformation is not a physical good, shipping costs are generally inconsequential. Finally, the global\nreach of media allows it to be relevant in many different countries.\nHowever, some have argued that media is actually a partial cause of globalization, rather than just\nanother globalized industry. Media is largely a cultural product, and the transfer of such a product is\nlikely to have an influence on the recipient\u2019s culture. Increasingly, technology has also been\npropelling globalization. Technology allows for quick communication, fast and coordinated\ntransport, and efficient mass marketing, all of which have allowed globalization\u2014especially\nglobalized media\u2014to take hold.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n614 Globalized Culture, Globalized Markets\nMuch globalized media content comes from the West, particularly from the United States. Driven by\nadvertising, U.S. culture and media have a strong consumerist bent (meaning that the ever-increasing\nconsumption of goods is encouraged as a economic virtue), thereby possibly causing foreign cultures to\nincreasingly develop consumerist ideals. Therefore, the globalization of media could not only provide\ncontent to a foreign country but may also create demand for U.S. products. Some believe that this will\n\u201ccontribute to a one-way transmission of ideas and values that result in the displacement of indigenous\ncultures.\u201d [1]\nGlobalization as a world economic trend generally refers to the lowering of economic trade borders, but it\nhas much to do with culture as well. Just as transfer of industry and technology often encourages outside\ninfluence through the influx of foreign money into the economy, the transfer of culture opens up these\nsame markets. As globalization takes hold and a particular community becomes more like the United\nStates economically, this community may also come to adopt and personalize U.S. cultural values. The\noutcome of this spread can be homogenization (the local culture becomes more like the culture of the\nUnited States) or heterogenization (aspects of U.S. culture come to exist alongside local culture, causing\nthe culture to become more diverse), or even both, depending on the specific situation. [2]\nMaking sense of this range of possibilities can be difficult, but it helps to realize that a mix of many\ndifferent factors is involved. Because of cultural differences, globalization of media follows a model unlike\nthat of the globalization of other products. On the most basic level, much of media is language and culture\nbased and, as such, does not necessarily translate well to foreign countries. Thus, media globalization\noften occurs on a more structural level, following broader \u201cways of organizing and creating media.\u201d [3] In\nthis sense, a media company can have many different culturally specific brands and still maintain an\neconomically globalized corporate structure.\nVertical Integration and Globalization\nBecause globalization has as much to do with the corporate structure of a media company as with the\nproducts that a media company produces, vertical integration in multinational media companies becomes\na necessary aspect of studying globalized media. Many large media companies practice vertical\nintegration: Newspaper chains take care of their own reporting, printing, and distribution; television\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n615 companies control their own production and broadcasting; and even small film studios often have parent\ncompanies that handle international distribution.\nA media company often benefits greatly from vertical integration and globalization. Because of the\nproliferation of U.S. culture abroad, media outlets are able to use many of the same distribution structures\nwith few changes. Because media rely on the speedy ability to react to current events and trends, a\nvertically integrated company can do all of this in a globalized rather than a localized marketplace;\ndifferent branches of the company are readily able to handle different markets. Further, production values\nfor single-country distribution are basically the same as those for multiple countries, so vertical\nintegration allows, for example, a single film studio to make higher-budget movies than it may otherwise\nbe able to produce without a distribution company that has as a global reach.\nForeign Markets and Titanic\nWorth considering is the reciprocal influence of foreign culture on American culture. Certainly, American\nculture is increasingly exported around the world thanks to globalization, and many U.S. media outlets\ncount strongly on their ability to sell their product in foreign markets. But what Americans consider their\nown culture has in fact been tailored to the tastes not only of U.S. citizens but also to those of worldwide\naudiences. The profit potential of foreign markets is enormous: If a movie does well abroad, for example,\nit might make up for a weak stateside showing, and may even drive interest in the movie in the United\nStates.\nOne prime example of this phenomenon of global culture and marketing is James Cameron\u2019s 1997\nfilm Titanic. One of the most expensive movies ever produced up to that point, with an official budget of\naround $200 million, Titanic was not anticipated to perform particularly well at the U.S. box office.\nRather, predictions of foreign box-office receipts allowed the movie to be made. Of the total box-office\nreceipts of Titanic, only about one-third came from the domestic market. Although Titanic became the\nhighest-grossing film up to that point, it grossed just $140 million more domestically than Star Wars did\n20 years earlier. [4] The difference was in the foreign market. While Star Wars made about the same\namount\u2014$300 million\u2014in both the domestic and foreign markets, Titanic grossed $1.2 billion in foreign\nbox-office receipts. In all, the movie came close to hitting the $2 billion mark, and now sits in the No. 2\nposition behind Cameron\u2019s 2009 blockbuster, Avatar.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n616 One reason that U.S. studios can make these kinds of arrangements is their well-developed ties with the\nworldwide movie industry. Hollywood studios have agreements with theaters all over the world to show\ntheir films. By contrast, the foreign market for French films is not nearly as established, as the industry\ntends to be partially subsidized by the French government. Theaters showing Hollywood studio films in\nFrance funnel portions of their box-office receipts to fund French films. However, Hollywood has lobbied\nthe World Trade Organization\u2014a largely pro-globalization group that pushes for fewer market\nrestrictions\u2014to rule that this French subsidy is an unfair restriction on trade. [5]\nIn many ways, globalization presents legitimate concerns about the endangerment of indigenous culture.\nYet simple concerns over the transfer of culture are not the only or even the biggest worries caused by the\nspread of American culture and values.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Technology allows for quick communication, transport, and mass marketing, greatly contributing to a\nglobalized marketplace.\n\uf0b7 Media economies of scale achieve much larger profit margins by using digital technology to sell\ninformation instantly over a global market.\n\uf0b7 Foreign markets offer excellent profit potential as they contribute to media companies\u2019 economies of\nscale. The addition of new audiences and consumer markets may help a company build a global following\nin the long run.\nEXERCISES\nThink of a U.S. product that is available throughout the world, such as an athletic brand like Nike or a food\nproduct like Pepsi or Coca-Cola.

Describe how hegemony applies to different aspects of global culture.\n2. Identify the attributes of McDonaldization.\n3. Analyze the ways that local cultures respond to outside forces.\nCultural imperialism was around long before the United States became a world power. In its broadest\nstrokes, imperialism describes the ways that one nation asserts its power over another. Just as\nimperial Britain economically ruled the American colonists, so did Britain strongly influence the\nculture of the colonies. The culture was still a mix of nationalities\u2014many Dutch and Germans settled\nas well\u2014but the ruling majority of ex-Britons led British culture to generally take over.\nToday, cultural imperialism tends to describe the United States\u2019 role as a cultural superpower\nthroughout the world. American movie studios are generally much more successful than their foreign\ncounterparts not only because of their business models but also because the concept of Hollywood\nhas become one of the modern worldwide movie business\u2019s defining traits. Multinational,\nnongovernmental corporations can now drive global culture. This is neither entirely good nor\nentirely bad. On one hand, foreign cultural institutions can adopt successful American business\nmodels, and corporations are largely willing to do whatever makes them the most money in a\nparticular market\u2014whether that means giving local people a shot at making movies, or making\nmulticultural films such as 2008\u2019s Slumdog Millionaire. However, cultural imperialism has potential\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n618 negative effects as well. From a spread of Western ideals of beauty to the possible decline of local\ncultures around the world, cultural imperialism can have a quick and devastating effect.\nCultural Hegemony\nTo begin discussing the topic of cultural imperialism, it is important to look at the ideas of one of its\nfounding theorists, Antonio Gramsci. Strongly influenced by the theories and writings of Karl Marx,\nItalian philosopher and critic Gramsci originated the idea of cultural hegemony to describe the power of\none group over another. Unlike Marx, who believed that the workers of the world would eventually unite\nand overthrow capitalism, Gramsci instead argued that culture and the media exert such a powerful\ninfluence on society that they can actually influence workers to buy into a system that is not economically\nadvantageous to them. This argument that media can influence culture and politics is typified in the\nnotion of the American Dream. In this rags-to-riches tale, hard work and talent can lead to a successful\nlife no matter where one starts. Of course, there is some truth to this, but it is by far the exception rather\nthan the rule.\nMarx\u2019s ideas remained at the heart of Gramsci\u2019s beliefs. According to Gramsci\u2019s notion,\nthe hegemons of capitalism\u2014those who control the capital\u2014can assert economic power, while the\nhegemons of culture can assert cultural power. This concept of culture is rooted in Marxist class struggle,\nin which one group is dominated by another and conflict arises. Gramsci\u2019s concept of cultural hegemony is\npertinent in the modern day not because of the likelihood of a local property-owning class oppressing the\npoor, but because of concern that rising globalization will permit one culture to so completely assert its\npower that it drives out all competitors.\nSpreading American Tastes Through McDonaldization\nA key danger of cultural imperialism is the possibility that American tastes will crowd out local cultures\naround the globe. The McDonaldization of the globe applies not just to its namesake, McDonald\u2019s, with its\nfranchises in seemingly every country, but to any industry that applies the technique of McDonald\u2019s on a\nlarge scale. Coined by George Ritzer in his book The McDonaldization of Society(1993), the concept is\nrooted in the process of rationalization. With McDonaldization, four aspects of the business are taken to\nthe extreme: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. These four things are four of the main\naspects of free markets. Applying the concepts of an optimized financial market to cultural and human\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n619 items such as food, McDonaldization enforces general standards and consistency throughout a global\nindustry.\nFigure 13.6\nMcDonald\u2019s has opened up many culturally specific versions of its chain, all employing its famous Golden Arches.\nUnsurprisingly, McDonald\u2019s is the prime example of this concept. Although the fast-food restaurant is\nsomewhat different in every country\u2014for example, Indian restaurants offer a pork-free, beef-free menu to\naccommodate regional religious practices\u2014the same fundamental principles apply in a culturally specific\nway. The branding of the company is the same wherever it is; the \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it\u201d slogan is inescapable, and\nthe Golden Arches are, according to Eric Schlosser in Fast Food Nation, \u201cmore widely recognized than the\nChristian cross.\u201d [1] Yet, more importantly, the business model of McDonald\u2019s stays relatively the same\nfrom country to country. Although culturally specific variations exist, any McDonald\u2019s in a particular area\nhas basically the same menu as any other. In other words, wherever a consumer is likely to travel within a\nreasonable range, the menu options and the resulting product remain consistent.\nMcDonaldizing Media\nMedia works in an uncannily similar way to fast food. Just as the automation of fast food\u2014from freeze-\ndried french fries to prewrapped salads\u2014attempts to lower a product\u2019s marginal costs, thus increasing\nprofits, media outlets seek to achieve a certain degree of consistency that allows them to broadcast and\nsell the same product throughout the world with minimal changes. The idea that media actually spreads a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n620 culture, however, is controversial. In his book Cultural Imperialism, John Tomlinson argues that\nexported American culture is not necessarily imperialist because it does not push a cultural agenda; it\nseeks to make money from whatever cultural elements it can throughout the world. According to\nTomlinson, \u201cno one really disputes the dominant presence of Western multinational, and particularly\nAmerican, media in the world: what is doubted is the cultural implications of this presence.\u201d [2]\nThere are, of course, by-products of American cultural exports throughout the world. American cultural\nmores, such as the Western standard of beauty, have increasingly made it into global media. As early as\n1987, Nicholas Kristof wrote in The New York Times about a young Chinese woman who was planning to\nhave an operation to make her eyes look rounder, more like the eyes of Caucasian women. Western\nstyles\u2014\u201cnewfangled delights like nylon stockings, pierced ears and eye shadow\u201d\u2014also began to replace the\naustere blue tunics of Mao-era China. The pervasiveness of cultural influence is difficult to track, however,\nas the young Chinese woman says that she wanted to have the surgery not because of Western looks but\nbecause \u201cshe thinks they are pretty.\u201d [3]\nCultural Imperialism, Resentment, and Terrorism\nNot everyone views the spread of American tastes as a negative occurrence. During the early 21st century,\nmuch of the United States\u2019 foreign policy stemmed from the idea that spreading freedom, democracy, and\nfree-market capitalism through cultural influence around the world could cause hostile countries such as\nIraq to adopt American ways of living and join the United States in the fight against global terrorism and\ntyranny. Although this plan did not succeed as hoped, it raises the question of whether Americans should\ntruly be concerned about spreading their cultural system if they believe that it is an ideal one.\nSpeaking after the attacks of September 11, 2001, then-President George W. Bush presented two simple\nideas to the U.S. populace: \u201cThey [terrorists] hate our freedoms,\u201d and \u201cGo shopping.\u201d [4] These twin ideals\nof personal freedom and economic activity are often held up as the prime exports of American culture.\nHowever, the idea that other local beliefs need to change may threaten people of other cultures.\nFreedom, Democracy, and Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll\nThe spread of culture works in mysterious ways. Hollywood probably does not actually have a master plan\nto export the American way of life around the globe and displace local culture, just as American music\nmay not necessarily be a progenitor of democratic government and economic cooperation. Rather, local\ncultures respond to the outside culture of U.S. media and democracy in many different ways. First of all,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n621 media are often often much more flexible than believed; the successful exportation of the film Titanic was\nnot an accident in which everyone in the world suddenly wanted to experience movies like an American.\nRather, the film\u2019s producers had judged that it would succeed on a world stage just as on a domestic stage.\nTherefore, in some ways U.S. media have become more widespread, and also more worldwide in focus. It\ncould even be argued that American cultural exports promote intercultural understanding; after all, to sell\nto a culture, a business must first understand that culture.\nBy contrast, some local cultures around the world have taken to Western-style business models so greatly\nthat they have created their own hybrid cultures. One well-known example of this is India\u2019s Bollywood\nfilm industry. Combining traditional Indian music and dance with American-style filmmaking, Bollywood\nstudios release around 700 major films each year, three times the rate of the major Hollywood studios.\nIndia\u2019s largest film industry mixes melodrama with musical interludes, lip-synced by actors but sung by\npop stars. These pop songs are disseminated well before a movie\u2019s release, both to build up hype and to\nenter multiple media markets. Although similar marketing tactics have been employed in the United\nStates, Bollywood seems to have mastered the art of cross-media integration. The music and dance\nnumbers are essentially cinematic forms of music videos, both promoting the soundtrack and adding\nvariety to the film. The numbers also feature many different Indian national languages and a hybrid of\nWestern dance music and Indian classical singing, a certain departure from conventional Western\nmedia. [5]\nWhile cultural imperialism might cause resentment in many parts of the world, the idea that local cultures\nare helpless under the crushing power of American cultural imposition is clearly too simplistic to hold\nwater. Instead, local cultures seem to adopt American-style media models, changing their methods to fit\nthe corporate structures rather than just the aesthetics of U.S. media. These two economic and cultural\naspects are clearly intertwined, but the idea of a foreign power unilaterally crushing a native culture does\nnot seem to be entirely true.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Cultural hegemony refers to the power of the dominant culture to overshadow and even overtake local\ncultures.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n622 \uf0b7 McDonaldization is characterized by efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. These four\nattributes\u2014more than any specific cultural ideas\u2014are the primary features of globalized American\nbusinesses.\n\uf0b7 Local cultures can respond to outside forces in many ways. In some circumstances, there may be a\nbacklash against what can be seen as a hostile culture. However, cultures such as India have adopted\nAmerican cultural and economic ideas to create a hybrid of foreign business models and local cultures.\nEXERCISES\nPlease respond to the following short-answer writing prompts.

Because of this, one of the\nindustry\u2019s quickly expanding career fields employs people who manage the online outlets of a more\ntraditional media outlet such as radio or television. Although such jobs used to require extensive\ntechnological knowledge, modern online project managers, online media editors, and web producers\nspend much of their time determining how best to display the content online.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n624 In this activity, you will research a media outlet and then answer questions about the choices that the web\nproducer, editor, or manager made regarding its content.

Freedom from government\ncensorship allows the news media to keep citizens informed about the state of their society. But when does\nthe press take this freedom from censorship and restriction too far? The death of Princess Diana in 1997\nbrought fierce criticism against the paparazzi, and tabloid reporting in general, when it was found that the\nprincess\u2019s car had been pursued by paparazzi vehicles before the crash that caused her death. In June\n2011, Tori Spelling crashed after being chased by paparazzi. She was pregnant at the time and feared for\nher unborn child. In July 2011, paparazzi were detained for chasing Paris Jackson (Michael Jackson\u2019s\ndaughter). Despite these incidents, the public\u2019s interest in celebrity gossip has not diminished; rather, the\ngrowth of online news sources has led to a proliferation of celebrity gossip websites.\nA potential concern regarding this trend is that tabloid-style gossip is not confined to public figures in the\nentertainment industry; it can have far-reaching consequences. As noted in Chapter 2 \"Media Effects\", the\nfiring of General Stanley McChrystal from his post as commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in\nAfghanistan in June 2010 was nearly the direct result of an article in Rolling Stone, in which he made\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n626 less-than-flattering comments about Vice President Joe Biden. [1] McChrystal himself did not directly\ncriticize the president or the administration\u2019s policies; instead, his views were inferred from comments\nmade by his aides. [2] However, this was sufficient to cost him his job. In recent years, tabloid reporting\nhas become increasingly invasive and sometimes dangerous.\nShould the government begin placing stronger regulations on tabloid reporting as privacy advocates have\nargued? The Constitution, after all, while guaranteeing freedom of the press, also has been interpreted as\nguaranteeing individuals certain rights to privacy, and most journalists would agree that standards of\nethical journalism include efforts to protect these rights. However, some paparazzi photographers and\ncelebrity journalists disregard journalistic codes of ethics in their efforts to get a story. [3] Many argue that\nbecause celebrities are \u201cpublic figures,\u201d the same privacy rights that protect the general public don\u2019t\napply. Us Weekly\u2019s editor in chief, Janice Min, has argued, \u201cA celebrity is like an elected official. If you\u2019re\ngetting paid $20 million a movie, you have to rely on public goodwill to stay in office. You have to accept\nthe fact that you\u2019re a public commodity.\u201d [4] Harvey Levin, editor in chief for the popular celebrity gossip\nblog TMZ, would agree. When discussing invasions into the private lives of stars like Britney Spears, Levin\nproclaimed that \u201cBritney is gold; she is crack to our readers. Her life is a complete train-wreck and I thank\nGod for her every day.\u201d [5]\nOn the other side of the debate, many argue that the public-figure limitation should be balanced with the\nconsideration of a story\u2019s newsworthiness. As law professor Patrick J. Alack has argued, \u201cIf \u2018social value\u2019 is\nwhat constitutes newsworthiness, it is hard to imagine a more perverse concept of social value that\nincorporates \u2026 Paris Hilton\u2019s late-night dining preferences or Lindsay Lohan\u2019s driving habits.\u201d [6]\nTMZ, a website that publishes celebrity news in real time, was launched in 2005, and since its creation the\nsite has received numerous criticisms from more prestigious news sources like The Washington Post and\nABC News. Yet Thane Burnett, reporter for The Toronto Sun, admits that \u201cdespite the sideways glances,\nmainstream news services prowl TMZ\u2019s site for coverage.\u201d [7] With the immediacy of Internet news\ncoverage, mainstream media outlets face increasing pressure to release major news while it is still fresh.\nThat pressure is compounded by celebrity gossip sites like TMZ that may resort to unorthodox methods to\ngather information; the shelf life of breaking news is growing increasingly shorter.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n627 [1] Michael Hastings, \u201cThe Runaway General,\u201d Rolling Stone, June 25, 2010,\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236.\n[2] MSNBC, \u201cObama, McCain, Kerry Comment on McChrystal,\u201d June 22, 2010,\nhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37850711/ns/us_news-military/.\n[3] Patrick J.

Explain the importance of racial and gender diversity in mass media.\n2. Identify the ethical concerns associated with race and gender stereotypes.\n3. List some common concerns about sexual content in the media.\nIn the competitive and rapidly changing world of mass-media communications, media\nprofessionals\u2014overcome by deadlines, bottom-line imperatives, and corporate interests\u2014can easily\nlose sight of the ethical implications of their work. However, as entertainment law specialist Sherri\nBurr points out, \u201cBecause network television is an audiovisual medium that is piped free into ninety-\nnine percent of American homes, it is one of the most important vehicles for depicting cultural\nimages to our population.\u201d [1] Considering the profound influence mass media like television have on\ncultural perceptions and attitudes, it is important for the creators of media content to grapple with\nethical issues.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n628 Stereotypes, Prescribed Roles, and Public Perception\nThe U.S. population is becoming increasingly diverse. According to U.S. Census statistics from 2010, 27.6\npercent of the population identifies its race as non-white. [2] Yet in network television broadcasts, major\npublications, and other forms of mass media and entertainment, minorities are often either absent or\npresented as heavily stereotyped, two-dimensional characters. Rarely are minorities depicted as complex\ncharacters with the full range of human emotions, motivations, and behaviors. Meanwhile, the\nstereotyping of women, gays and lesbians, and individuals with disabilities in mass media has also been a\nsource of concern.\nThe word stereotype originated in the printing industry as a method of making identical copies, and the\npractice of stereotyping people is much the same: a system of identically replicating an image of an\n\u201cother.\u201d As related in Chapter 8 \"Movies\" about D. W. Griffith\u2019s The Birth of a Nation, a film that relied on\nracial stereotypes to portray Southern whites as victims in the American Civil War, stereotypes\u2014especially\nthose disseminated through mass media\u2014become a form of social control, shaping collective perceptions\nand individual identities. In American mass media, the white man is still shown as the standard: the\ncentral figure of television narratives and the dominant perspective on everything from trends, to current\nevents, to politics. White maleness becomes an invisible category because it gives the impression of being\nthe norm. [3]\nMinority Exclusion and Stereotypes\nIn the fall of 1999, when the major television networks released their schedules for the upcoming\nprogramming season, a startling trend became clear. Of the 26 newly released television programs, none\ndepicted an African American in a leading role, and even the secondary roles on these shows included\nalmost no racial minorities. In response to this omission, the National Association for the Advancement of\nColored People (NAACP) and the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), an advocacy group for Hispanic\nAmericans, organized protests and boycotts. Pressured\u2014and embarrassed\u2014into action, the executives\nfrom the major networks made a fast dash to add racial minorities to their prime-time shows, not only\namong actors, but also among producers, writers, and directors. Four of the networks\u2014ABC, CBS, NBC,\nand Fox\u2014added a vice president of diversity position to help oversee the networks\u2019 progress toward\ncreating more diverse programming. [4]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n629 Despite these changes and greater public attention regarding diversity issues, minority\nunderrepresentation is still an issue in all areas of mass media. In fact, the trend in recent years has been\nregressive. In a recent study, the NAACP reported that the number of minority actors on network\ntelevision has actually decreased, from 333 during the 2002\u20132003 season to 307 four years later. [5]Racial\nminorities are often absent, peripheral, or take on stereotyped roles in film, television, print media,\nadvertising, and even in video games. Additionally, according to a 2002 study by the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, the problem is not only a visible one, but also one that extends behind the scenes.\nThe study found that minorities are even more underrepresented in creative and decision-making\npositions than they are on screen. [6] This lack of representation among producers, writers, and directors\noften directly affects the way minorities are portrayed in film and television, leading to racial stereotypes.\nThough advocacy groups like the NCLR and the NAACP have often been at the forefront of protests\nagainst minority stereotypes in the media, experts are quick to point out that the issue is one everyone\nshould be concerned about. As media ethicist Leonard M. Baynes argues, \u201cSince we live in a relatively\nsegregated country\u2026broadcast television and its images and representations are very important because\ntelevision can be the common meeting ground for all Americans.\u201d [7] There are clear correlations between\nmass media portrayals of minority groups and public perceptions. In 1999, after hundreds of complaints\nby African Americans that they were unable to get taxis to pick them up, the city of New York launched a\ncrackdown, threatening to revoke the licenses of cab drivers who refused to stop for African American\ncustomers. When interviewed by reporters, many cab drivers blamed their actions on fears they would be\nrobbed or asked to drive to dangerous neighborhoods. [8]\nRacial stereotypes are not only an issue in entertainment media; they also find their way into news\nreporting, which is a form of storytelling. Journalists, editors, and reporters are still predominately white.\nAccording to a 2000 survey, only 11.6 percent of newsroom staff in the United States were racial and\nethnic minorities. [9] The situation has not improved dramatically during the past decade. According to a\n2008 newsroom census released by the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the percentage of\nminority journalists working at daily newspapers was a scant 13.52 percent. [10] Because of this\nunderrepresentation behind the scenes, the news media is led by those whose perspective is already\nprivileged, who create the narratives about those without privilege. In the news media, racial minorities\nare often cast in the role of villains or troublemakers, which in turn shapes public perceptions about these\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n630 groups. Media critics Robert Entman and Andrew Rojecki point out that images of African Americans on\nwelfare, African American violence, and urban crime in African American communities \u201cfacilitate the\nconstruction of menacing imagery.\u201d [11] Similarly, a study by the National Association of Hispanic\nJournalists found that only 1 percent of the evening news stories aired by the three major U.S. television\nnetworks cover Latinos or Latino issues, and that when Latinos are featured, they are portrayed negatively\n80 percent of the time.[12] Still others have criticized journalists and reporters for a tendency toward\nreductive presentations of complex issues involving minorities, such as the religious and racial tensions\nfueled by the September 11 attacks. By reducing these conflicts to \u201copposing frames\u201d\u2014that is, by\noversimplifying them as two-sided struggles so that they can be quickly and easily understood\u2014the news\nmedia helped create a greater sense of separation between Islamic Americans and the dominant culture\nafter September 11, 2001. [13]\nSince the late 1970s, the major professional journalism organizations in the United States\u2014Associated\nPress Managing Editors (APME), Newspaper Association of America (NAA), American Society of\nNewspaper Editors (ASNE), Society for Professional Journalists (SPJ), Radio and Television News\nDirectors Association (RTNDA), and others\u2014have included greater ethnic diversity as a primary goal or\nethic. However, progress has been slow. ASNE has set 2025 as a target date to have minority\nrepresentation in newsrooms match U.S. demographics. [14]\nBecause the programming about, by, and for ethnic minorities in the mainstream media is\ndisproportionately low, many turn to niche publications and channels such as BET, Univision,\nTelemundo, Essence, Jet, and others for sources of information and entertainment. In fact, 45 percent of\nethnic-minority adults prefer these niche media sources to mainstream television, radio programs, and\nnewspapers. [15] These sources cover stories about racial minorities that are generally ignored by the\nmainstream press and offer ethnic-minority perspectives on more widely covered issues in the\nnews. [16]Entertainment channels like BET (a 24-hour cable television station that offers music videos,\ndramas featuring predominately black casts, and other original programming created by African\nAmericans) provide the diverse programming that mainstream television networks often drop. [17] Print\nsources like Vista, a bilingual magazine targeting U.S. Hispanics, and Vivid, the most widely circulated\nAfrican American periodical, appeal to ethnic minority groups because they are controlled and created by\nindividuals within these groups. Though some criticize ethnic niche media, claiming that they erode\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n631 common ground or, in some instances, perpetuate stereotypes, the popularity of these media has only\ngrown in recent years and will likely continue in the absence of more diverse perspectives in mainstream\nmedia sources. [18]\nFemininity in Mass Media\nIn the ABC sitcom The Donna Reed Show (1958\u20131966), actress Donna Reed plays a stay-at-home mother\nwho fills her days with housework, cooking for her husband and children, decorating, and participating in\ncommunity organizations, all while wearing pearls, heels, and stylish dresses. Such a traditional portrayal\nof femininity no doubt sounds dated to modern audiences, but stereotyped gender roles continue to thrive\nin the mass media. Women are still often represented as subordinate to their male counterparts\u2014\nemotional, noncompetitive, domestic, and sweet natured. In contrast to these types, other women are\nrepresented as unattractively masculine, crazy, or cruel. In television dramas and sitcoms, women\ncontinue to fill traditional roles such as mothers, nurses, secretaries, and housewives. By contrast, men in\nfilm and television are less likely to be shown in the home, and male characters are generally\ncharacterized by dominance, aggression, action, physical strength, and ambition. [19] In the mainstream\nnews media, men are predominately featured as authorities on specialized issues like business, politics,\nand economics, while women are more likely to report on stories about natural disasters or domestic\nviolence\u2014coverage that does not require expertise. [20] In sports programming, men are the authoritative\nfigures in the broadcast booth while women are \u201csideline reporters.\u201c\nNot only is the white male perspective still presented as the standard, authoritative one, but also the\nmedia itself often comes to embody the male gaze. Media commentator Nancy Hass notes that \u201cshows\nthat don\u2019t focus on men have to feature the sort of women that guys might watch.\u201d [21] Feminist critics have\nlong been concerned by the way women in film, television, and print media are defined by their sexuality.\nFew female role models exist in the media who are valued primarily for qualities like intelligence or\nleadership. Inundated by images that conform to unrealistic beauty standards, women come to believe at\nan early age that their value depends on their physical attractiveness. According to one Newsweek article,\neating disorders in girls are now routinely being diagnosed at younger ages, sometimes as early as 8 or 9.\nThe models who appear in magazines and print advertising are unrealistically skinny (23 percent thinner\nthan the average woman), and their photographs are further enhanced to hide flaws and blemishes.\nMeanwhile, the majority of women appearing on television are under the age of 30, and many older\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n632 actresses, facing the pressure to embody the youthful ideal, undergo surgical enhancements to appear\nyounger.[22] One recent example is television news host Greta Van Susteren, a respected legal analyst who\nmoved from CNN to Fox in 2002. At the debut of her show, On the Record, Van Susteren, sitting behind a\ntable that allowed viewers to see her short skirt, had undergone not only a hair and wardrobe makeover,\nbut also surgical enhancement to make her appear younger and more attractive. [23]However, these\nenhancements are not restricted to the \u201cover 30\u201d crowd. Indeed, younger stars, such as Ashley Tisdale\n(High School Musical), singer Ashlee Simpson, and reality star Heidi Montag, have all availed themselves\nof plastic surgery.\nIn addition to the prevalence of gender stereotypes, the ratio of men to women in the mass media, in and\nbehind the scenes, is also disproportionate. Surprisingly, though women slightly outnumber men in the\ngeneral population, over two-thirds of television sitcoms feature men in the starring role. [24]Among\nwriters, producers, directors, and editors, the number of women lags far behind. In Hollywood, for\ninstance, only 17 percent of behind-the-scenes creative talent is represented by women. Communications\nresearcher Martha Lauzen argues that \u201cwhen women have more powerful roles in the making of a movie\nor television show, we know that we also get more powerful female characters on-screen, women who are\nmore real and more multi-dimensional.\u201d[25]\nSexual Content in Public Communication\nCreators of all forms of media know that sex\u2014named, innuendoed, or overtly displayed\u2014is a surefire way\nto grab an audience\u2019s attention. \u201cSex sells\u201d is an advertising clich\u00e9; the list of products that advertisers\nhave linked to erotic imagery or innuendo, from cosmetics and cars to vacation packages and beer, is\nnearly inexhaustible. Most often, sexualized advertising content is served up in the form of the female\nbody, in part or in whole, featured in provocative or suggestive poses beside a product that may have\nnothing to do with sexuality. However, by linking these two things, advertisers are marketing desire itself.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n633 Figure 14.2\nSex Sells: Commodifying Desire, Past\nSex is used to sell not just consumer goods; it sells media, too. Music videos on MTV and VH1, which\npromote artists and their music, capture audience attention with highly suggestive dance moves, often\nperformed by scantily clad women. Recent music videos by Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, and Lady\nGaga are just a few examples. Movie trailers may flash brief images of nudity or passionate kissing to\nsuggest more to come in the movie. Video games feature female characters like Lara Croft of Tomb\nRaider, whose tightly fitted clothes reveal all the curves of her Barbie-doll figure. And partially nude\nmodels grace the cover of men\u2019s and women\u2019s magazines like Maxim, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue where\ncover lines promise titillating tips, gossip, and advice on bedroom behavior. [26]\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, filmmakers attracted audiences to the silver screen with the promise of what was\nthen considered scandalous content. Prior to the 1934 Hays Code, which placed restrictions on \u201cindecent\u201d\ncontent in movies, films featured erotic dances, male and female nudity, references to homosexuality, and\nsexual violence (for more information on the Hays Code, see Chapter 8 \"Movies\" and Chapter 15 \"Media\nand Government\"). D. W. Griffith\u2019s Intolerance (1916) includes scenes with topless actresses, as does Ben\nHur (1925). In Warner Bros.\u2019 Female (1933), the leading lady, the head of a major car company, spends\nher evenings in sexual exploits with her male employees, a story line that would never have passed the\nHays Code a year later. [27] Trouble in Paradise, a 1932 romantic comedy, was withdrawn from circulation\nafter the institution of the Hays Code because of its frank discussion of sexuality. Similarly, Dr. Jekyll and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n634 Mr. Hyde (1931), which featured a prostitute as one of the main characters, was also banned under the\ncode. [28]\nIn the 1960s, when the sexual revolution led to increasingly permissive attitudes toward sexuality in\nAmerican culture, the Hays Code was replaced with the MPAA rating system, with ratings such as G, PG,\nand R. The rating system, designed to warn parents about potentially objectionable material in films,\nallowed filmmakers to include sexually explicit content without fear of public protest. Since the\nreplacement of the Hays Code, sexual content has been featured in movies with much greater frequency.\nThe problem, according to many media critics, is not that sex now appears more often, but that it is\nalmost always portrayed unrealistically in American mass media. [29] This can be harmful, they say,\nbecause the mass media are important socialization agents; that is, ways that people learn about the\nnorms, expectations, and values of their society. [30] Sex, as many films, television shows, music videos,\nand song lyrics present it, is frequent and casual. Rarely do these media point out the potential emotional\nand physical consequences of sexual behavior. According to one study, portrayals of sex that include\npossible risks like sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy only occur in 15 percent of the sexually\nexplicit material on television. [31] Additionally, actors and models depicted in sexual relationships in the\nmedia are thinner, younger, and more attractive than the average adult. This creates unrealistic\nexpectations about the necessary ingredients for a satisfying sexual relationship.\nSocial psychologists are particularly concerned with the negative effects these unrealistic portrayals have\non women, as women\u2019s bodies are the primary means of introducing sexual content into media targeted at\nboth men and women. Media activist Jean Kilbourne points out that \u201cwomen\u2019s bodies are often\ndismembered into legs, breasts or thighs, reinforcing the message that women are objects rather than\nwhole human beings.\u201d [32] Adbusters, a magazine that critiques mass media, particularly advertising,\npoints out the sexual objectification of women\u2019s bodies in a number of its spoof advertisements, such as\nthe one in Figure 14.3, bringing home the message that advertising often sends unrealistic and harmful\nmessages about women\u2019s bodies and sexuality. Additionally, many researchers note that in women\u2019s\nmagazines, advertising, and music videos, women are often implicitly\u2014and sometimes explicitly\u2014given\nthe message that a primary concern should be attracting and sexually satisfying men. [33] Furthermore, the\nrecent increase in entertainment featuring sexual violence may, according to some studies, negatively\naffect the way young men behave toward women. [34]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n635 Figure 14.3\nSexual objectification: Women\u2019s bodies are often headless or dismembered into legs, breasts, or\nthighs in media portrayals. [35]\nYoung women and men are especially vulnerable to the effects of media portrayals of sexuality.\nPsychologists have long noted that teens and children get much of their information and many of their\nopinions about sex through television, film, and online media. In fact, two-thirds of adolescents turn to\nthe media first when they want to learn about sexuality. [36] The media may help shape teenage and\nadolescent attitudes toward sex, but they can also lead young people to engage in sexual activity before\nthey are prepared to handle the consequences. According to one study, kids with high exposure to sex on\ntelevision were almost twice as likely to initiate sexual activity compared to kids without exposure. [37]\nCultural critics have noted that sexually explicit themes in mass media are generally more widely accepted\nin European nations than they are in the United States. However, the increased concern and debates over\ncensorship of sexual content in the United States may in fact be linked to the way sex is portrayed in\nAmerican media rather than to the presence of the sexual content in and of itself. Unrealistic portrayals\nthat fail to take into account the actual complexity of sexual relationships seem to be a primary concern.\nAs Jean Kilbourne has argued, sex in the American media \u201chas far more to do with trivializing sex than\nwith promoting it.

Explain\nwhy this kind of diversity is important in media.\n2. Are there any racial or gender stereotypes present in the show or movie you\u2019ve chosen? If so, identify\nthem and describe how they are stereotypical. If not, describe what elements would prevent the\nportrayal of a female or ethnic minority characters from being stereotypical.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n637 3. Does the show or movie you\u2019ve selected feature any sexual content? If so, do you think that the\ncontent is gratuitous or unrealistic, or does it serve the story? Explain your answer. Then explain why\nthe use of sexual content in media is a concern for many media critics.\n[1] Sherri Burr, \u201cTelevision and Societal Effects: An Analysis of Media Images of African-Americans in Historical\nContext,\u201d Journal of Gender, Race and Justice 4 (2001): 159.\n[2] U.S. Census Bureau, \u201c2010 Census Data,\u201d http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/.\n[3] Joanna Hearne, \u201cHollywood Whiteness and Stereotypes,\u201d Film Reference,\nhttp://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/Race-and-Ethnicity-HOLLYWOOD-\nWHITENESS-AND-STEREOTYPES.html.\n[4] Leonard M.

Describe the role of media in delivering news to the public.\n2. Identify the important characteristics of reliable journalism.\n3. Summarize the effects of bias in news presentations.\nNow more than ever, with the presence of online news sources, news delivery is expected to be\ninstantaneous, and journalists and news agencies face pressure to release stories rapidly to keep up\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n640 with competing media sources. With this added pressure, standards of accuracy and fairness become\nmore difficult to uphold. What wins when ethical responsibility and bottom-line concerns are at\nodds? Columnist Ellen Goodman notes that there has always been a tension in journalism between\nbeing first and being right. She argues, \u201cIn today\u2019s amphetamine world of news junkies, speed\ntrumps thoughtfulness too often.\u201d [1]As you read the following sections, decide if you agree with\nGoodman\u2019s assessment of the state of the news media today.\nImmediate News Delivery\nIn 1916, audiences across America tuned in to their radios to hear the first-ever breaking-news coverage of\nan event as the results of the presidential election between Woodrow Wilson and Charles Evans Hughes\nwere announced from the offices of The New York American. Until that broadcast, news was delivered to\nAmerican homes once per day in the form of a newspaper, and often this coverage lagged a day or more\nbehind the actual incidents it reported. Whereas much of radio news coverage even into the 1930s\ninvolved the reading of newspaper stories and news wires on the air, radio offered something that the\nnewspapers could not: live coverage of special events. [2]\nFor decades, the public turned to the family radio when they wanted to hear the most recent coverage of\nimportant news. All of that changed, however, in 1963 with the assassination of President John F.\nKennedy. CBS correspondent Dan Rather took television audiences live to \u201cthe corner window just below\nthe top floor, where the assassin stuck out his 30 caliber rifle,\u201d and for the first time, people were able to\nsee an event nearly as it occurred. This was the beginning of round-the-clock television news coverage,\nand the American public, while still relying on print news for detailed coverage, came to expect greater\nimmediacy of major event reporting through television and radio broadcasts. [3]\nToday, with the widespread availability of Internet news, instant coverage is the norm rather than the\nexception, and the Internet and cell phones have generally replaced television and radio as the source of\nimmediate information. Visitors toABCNews.com can watch an evening newscast three and a half hours\nbefore it airs on television. [4] RSS (which stands for really simple syndication, a standard for the easy\nsyndication of online content) feeds, home pages for major news-delivery sites like Yahoo! News\nand CNN.com, news tickers, live video streams, blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of other media\noutlets ensure that news\u2014and rumors of news\u2014circulates within minutes of its occurrence. Additionally,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n641 with smartphone applications like those for The New York Times and USA Today, people can access the\nlatest news coverage from almost anywhere.\nThe development of the Internet as a source of free and immediate access to information has forever\nchanged the structure of the news media. Newspaper, television, and radio news programs have all had to\nadapt and diversify to compete for a share of the market. As Jeffrey Cole, director of the Center for Digital\nCommunication put it, \u201cFor the first time in 60 years, newspapers are back in the breaking news\nbusiness.\u201d Online, newspapers can compete with broadcast media for immediate coverage, posting\narticles on their home pages as soon as the stories are written, and supplementing the articles on their\nwebsites with audiovisual content. Gone is the era of single-medium newsrooms with predictable\ndeadlines. [5]\nNot only are traditional news media restructuring, but news consumers are also changing the way they\naccess information. Increasingly, audiences want news on demand; they want to get news when they want\nit, and they want to be able to gather it from a variety of sources. This is having a significant effect on\nmedia revenues. News aggregators, websites like Yahoo! News and Google News that compile news\nheadlines from an array of legacy news organizations to display on their pages, have become popular\ninformation outlets. Although these websites don\u2019t hire reporters to produce news stories themselves, they\nget about the same amount of online traffic as websites for legacy news organizations like CNN and The\nWall Street Journal. Moreover, many subscribers to print newspapers and magazines are canceling their\nsubscriptions because they can get more current information online at no cost. [6] Print advertising is\ndown as well. In 2004, The San Francisco Chronicle reported losing $50 million in classified advertising\nto free online options like Craigslist. [7]\nThis loss of revenue has become a problem in recent years because while newspapers and magazines\ngenerate some income from advertisements on their websites, the money is not enough to compensate for\nlost readership and print ads. Subscriptions and advertising in traditional print media still account for 90\npercent of industry funds, which means with less revenue in these areas, the support base for news\norganizations is dwindling. Newspapers and magazines across the country have had to restructure and\nscale down. Newspapers now spend $1.6 billion less annually on reporting and editing than they did 10\nyears ago. [8]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n642 Additionally, reduced budgets combined with greater pressure for immediacy have changed the way\ninformation gets reported and disseminated. Newsrooms are asking their staffs to focus on producing first\naccounts more quickly to feed multiple platforms. This often means that more resources go into\ndistributing information than gathering it. Once news is released online by one source, it spreads rapidly,\nand other organizations scramble to release accounts, too, in order to keep up, often leaving staff less time\nfor fact-checking and editing. The initial story is then followed quickly by commentary from both\nprofessional news organizations and nonprofessional sources on blogs, Twitter, and other social networks.\nAs a result of this restructuring, certain stories may get distributed, replayed, and commented on almost\nexcessively, while other stories go unnoticed and in-depth coverage that would unearth more facts and\ncontext gets neglected. This has led a number of industry professionals to become anxious over the future\nof the news industry. The Center for Excellence in Journalism has called the news industry today \u201cmore\nreactive than proactive.\u201d [9] Journalist Patricia Sullivan complains, \u201cRight now, almost no online news sites\ninvest in original, in-depth and scrupulously edited news reporting.\u201d [10] While some may disagree with\nSullivan, in-depth journalism remains an expensive and time-consuming venture that many online news\nsites, faced with uncertain revenue streams and a growing consumer demand for real-time news updates,\nare reluctant to bankroll extensively.\nAlready strapped for funds, news organizations know they have to cater to public demands, and foremost\namong these demands is speed. When pop-music icon Michael Jackson died on June 26, 2009, at 2:26\np.m., news of his death hit cyberspace by 2:44 p.m. and soon spread nationwide via Twitter. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the initial report of Jackson\u2019s death was released by celebrity gossip website TMZ. Legacy\nnews sources were slower to publish accounts. The Los Angeles Times, wary of the sourcing of the story,\nwaited to confirm the news and didn\u2019t publish the story on its website until 3:15 p.m., by which time,\nthanks to the speed of social media, the star\u2019s death was already \u201cold news.\u201d [11]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n643 Figure 14.4\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n644 American news organizations are losing their audiences to online media and have lost billions in\nadvertising income.\nSocial Responsibility of News Media\nIn the preamble to its statement of purpose, the Committee of Concerned Journalists lists as the central\npurpose of journalism \u201cto provide citizens with accurate and reliable information they need to function in\na free society.\u201d [12]This theory of the social responsibility of the press is often referred to as the\nvital information premise. Though sometimes worded differently by different organizations, it is widely\naccepted in the journalism community as the foundation for any principles of media ethics. [13] What are\nthose specific principles? Here are some that are particularly important for journalists in the current\nmedia climate.\nPresent News Stories That Inform and Serve the Needs of Citizens\nIf the basis for the principles of ethical news reporting is giving citizens the information they need to\nfunction in a democratic society, then that information must be presented accurately. Journalists should\nbe careful to verify the facts before they report them. As the Committee of Concerned Journalists asserts,\n\u201cAccuracy is the foundation upon which everything else is built\u2014context, interpretation, comment,\ncriticism, analysis and debate,\u201d so reliable news sources are essential if citizens are to have a clear\nunderstanding of the society in which they live. [14] Furthermore, although news organizations have a\nprofessional responsibility toward advertisers and shareholders, their commitment is always to citizens\nfirst. This means that journalists must report the facts truthfully and without omission, even if they are\nnot in the best interest of advertisers, shareholders, or friends.\nPresent Issues Fairly\nReporting issues fairly requires not only factual accuracy, but also lack of favoritism toward any\norganization, political group, ideology, or other agenda. The Society of Professional Journalists stipulates\nthat journalists should refuse gifts and favors and avoid political involvement or public office if these\nthings compromise journalistic integrity. [15] Additionally, journalists should avoid inflating stories for\nsensation and be as transparent as possible about their sources of information so that the public can\ninvestigate the issues further on their own. [16]\nAll sides of an issue should be presented in a news story. Of course, all journalists have a perspective from\nwhich they write, but a clear distinction should be made between news reports and editorial content. [17]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n645 Present Stories in a Way That Addresses Their Complexity\nMany issues in the news are layered and highly complex. Developing a thorough understanding of issues\nrequires dedication and a sometimes lengthy investigation, and, especially in a world where rapid\nreporting is the norm, there can be a temptation to gloss over the finer points of an issue for the sake of\nefficiency. Additionally, most consumers of news, increasingly busy and overwhelmed by the amount of\ninformation available, want stories that can be quickly digested and easily comprehended. However, as\nthe Committee of Concerned Journalists points out, the media must balance what readers want with what\nthey need but cannot anticipate. [18] Oversimplifying issues, whether for the sake of a quick story or to\nsatisfy public tastes, becomes a violation of the vital information premise. [19]\nPresent Diverse Perspectives\nWhen discussing what he considers to be one of the key issues in professional journalism, media ethicist\nJeremy Iggers points out that because democracy means the widest possible participation of citizens in\npublic life, diversity in journalism is of fundamental importance. [20] Not only should newsroom staff\nrepresent a diversity of gender and races, but journalists should also speak for all groups in society\u2014\u201cnot\njust those with attractive demographics,\u201d as the Committee for Concerned Journalists puts it. Journalists\nshould represent the underrepresented because ignoring citizens is a form of disenfranchisement. [21]\nMonitor Government and Corporations\nWhen the framers of the U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press, one of the things they had in\nmind was the ability of the news media to serve as a watchdog over those in positions of power. [22] It is the\nduty of the press to ensure that business is conducted in the open and that government actions are public.\nOne famous example of the media fulfilling its watchdog role was The Washington Post\u2019s investigation of\nthe 1972 Watergate scandal. During Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency, journalists at the Post uncovered\ninformation linking government agencies and officials to the break-in at the Democratic National\nCommittee headquarters at the Watergate complex as part of an attempt to sabotage the Democratic\ncampaign and guarantee Nixon\u2019s reelection. [23] Media coverage of the scandal increased publicity and\nultimately put pressure on the government that led to an investigation and the prosecution of many who\nwere involved. [24] In the past decade, the media has uncovered incriminating information about various\nSenators and Congressmen, resulting in charges of corruption, tax evasion, conspiracy, and fraud.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n646 Characteristics of Reliable Journalism\nWhile CNN and other news networks took some criticism for their delay in reporting Michael Jackson\u2019s\ndeath in 2009, others commended the news organizations for waiting for official confirmation. For many\njournalists and members of the public, ensuring accuracy, even when it means delays, is a hallmark of\nresponsible journalism.\nMore than 400 journalistic codes of ethics have been produced by various unions and associations\nworldwide. [25] Where they may differ on specifics, these codes of ethics agree that the news media\u2019s top\nobligation is to report the truth. When journalists say this, of course, they don\u2019t mean truth in an absolute,\nphilosophical sense; they mean practical truth, the truth that involves reporting the facts as faithfully and\naccurately as possible. This notion of truth includes an accurate representation of information from\nreliable sources, but it also includes a complete representation, one that presents multiple perspectives on\nan issue and does not suppress vital information.\nMany codes of ethics stress that the press has a duty to continue its investigation of the facts, even after\ninitially reporting them, and to rectify any inaccuracies that may have occurred in the initial coverage of\nan issue. [26] One example is The Huffington Post, a news website that, with over 2,000 bloggers, has the\nworld\u2019s most linked-to blog. Blogging is sometimes criticized by more traditional journalists for the\ntendency, among some blogs, to include biases, unreliable information, and unfounded opinions\u2014in other\nwords, for instances of violating journalistic codes of ethics. However, The Huffington Post requires all of\nits pass-holding writers to fact-check and to correct any factual errors within 24 hours or lose their\nprivileges. [27]\nAlong with an emphasis on the truth, codes of ethics stress loyalty and duty to citizens as a standard of\nprimary importance. Of course, truth telling is an essential component of this loyalty, but additionally, the\nconcern here is in reminding journalists whom their work serves. Especially in the current environment,\nin which media outlets face increased financial pressure, there is a tension between responsible\njournalism and the demands for profit. Aiden White notes that corporate and political influences are of\nincreasing concern in this environment, but he reminds journalists that while they have duties to other\nconstituencies, \u201cmedia products are not just economic.\u201d Journalists must hold the larger public interest\nabove other interests. [28]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n647 Another challenge often posed by bottom-line concerns and the pressure for a good story is sensitivity\ntoward, and protection of, those involved in the news. Responsible journalists should strive to balance\ndisclosure of the news with a respect for individual privacy. Finding this balance can sometimes be a\nchallenge. On one hand, journalists should never expose private information that could be harmful to\nindividuals for the sake of sensationalizing a story. Issues like family life, sexual behavior, sexual\norientation, or medical conditions, for instance, are generally considered tabloid material that would\nviolate the privacy of those involved.\nOn the other hand, there are times when the private lives of individuals must be made public in the\ninterests of serving the common good. One example was the 2009 media scandal surrounding South\nCarolina Governor Mark Sanford, who, after media investigations over his weeklong disappearance in\nJune of that year, admitted to flying to Argentina to visit his mistress. After it was revealed that Sanford\nhad used public funds for his private travel, he resigned from his office as the chairman of the Republican\nGovernors\u2019 Association. [29] Although the publicity surrounding this private matter was clearly painful for\nthe governor and his family, releasing information about the incident, particularly regarding the misuse of\npublic funds, was in the best interest of the citizens. The International Federation of Journalists offers\nthree factors as a rough guideline in cases where privacy is in danger of being violated: the nature of the\nindividual\u2019s place in society, the individual\u2019s reputation, and his or her place in public life. Politicians,\njudges, and others in elected office often must forgo their expectations of privacy for reasons of democracy\nand accountability\u2014the public\u2019s right to know if their elected officials are engaged in unethical or criminal\nconduct generally trumps an individual\u2019s right to privacy. [30] These factors, in recent years, have resulted\nin public scandals surrounding other political leaders\u2014Representative Anthony Weiner, former Governor\nArnold Schwarzenegger, and presidential hopeful John Edwards, to name a few.\nBecause the press has a duty to serve the best interests of the citizens in a democracy, it is important that\njournalists act independently and that they remain neutral in their presentation of\ninformation. Objectivity was once the common term used to support this notion. More recently, however,\nthere has been wider acceptance of the fact that reporting always occurs through a lens of personal\nexperience, culture, beliefs, and background that ultimately all influence the way any individual\nsubjectively perceives a situation. [31] If this were not the case\u2014if there were only one standard way\neveryone perceived, investigated, and reported on a story\u2014what would be the value of including racial and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n648 gender diversity in the newsroom? Nevertheless, responsible journalism requires journalists to avoid\nfavoritism and to present news that is fair and offers a complete picture of the issue.\nThe principle of journalistic independence is an important component of the news media\u2019s watchdog role.\nJournalists should avoid conflicts of interest\u2014financial, political, or otherwise\u2014and, when conflicts of\ninterest are unavoidable, it is a journalist\u2019s ethical responsibility to disclose those. [32] One example\ninvolving conflict of interest centers on recent talk of government bailouts for the news media, similar to\nthe bailouts for the auto and banking industries. However, many journalists are concerned that\ngovernment support of this kind would present a conflict of interest and interfere with the media\u2019s\nwatchdog role. [33]\nIn addition to maintaining independence, the news media should allow for commentary and opposition.\nLeaving space for citizens to voice concerns about journalistic conduct is an important part of serving the\npublic interest and keeping the public\u2019s trust.\nThe Effects of Bias in News Presentations\nWhile principles of ethical journalism require journalists to remain neutral in their reporting, there is, as\npreviously mentioned, always a degree of bias that will be present in any news reporting due to the\nelement of personal perspective that any journalist will naturally bring to his or her work. A 2005 in-\ndepth study by political scientists at UCLA found that, of 20 media outlets, 18 had a perspective in their\nnews reporting that was left of the national average. Of those 20, only Fox News and The Washington\nTimes scored to the right of the average U.S. voter. [34]\nWhat, exactly, does political bias in the media look like? In the UCLA study, news sources were scored\nbased on their sources of information and expert opinion. The news outlets with the most liberal slant\u2014\nCBS News and The New York Times\u2014cited liberal think tanks and policy groups with a much greater\nfrequency than they cited conservative ones. [35] Political bias can also be observed by examining which\nstories a network or newspaper chooses to report. According to media analyst Seth Ackerman, the right-\nleaning Fox News network reports news stories that favor the Republican Party or show the Democratic\nParty in a negative light. Additionally, Fox\u2019s panels of pundits who offer commentary after the news tend\nto be politically conservative or moderate far more often than liberal. [36]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n649 Figure 14.6\nSome argue that there is a politically left bias in the news media.\nSuch biases in news media may have an effect on public opinion. However, while the picture a journalist\nor particular news outlet creates may not be entirely objective, journalists with integrity will strive to be\nfair and comprehensive, offering opposing views and citing their sources of information. Members of the\npublic should remember that they also have a responsibility to be active, rather than passive, consumers\nof information. Good media consumers use critical analysis skills while reading news reports. If a story is\npresented conscientiously in the news, a reader or viewer will have the resources he or she needs to\nresearch an issue further and draw his or her own conclusions. As you continue reading the chapter, keep\nin mind the ethical obligations of those who work in mass media and the potential consequences of their\nfailure to uphold them.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n650 KEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The Internet has brought about profound and rapid changes in the structuring, delivery, and\neconomics of news media.\no Immediate news delivery has become the norm.\no The pressure for immediate delivery increases the tension between factual accuracy and \u201cgetting there\nfirst\u201d in news reporting.\no Because people can get instant news for free online, subscriptions to print media are down, and so are\nadvertising revenues.\n\uf0b7 Most journalistic codes of ethics are based on the premise that the news media exists to provide\ncitizens with the information they need to function in a free and democratic society. Journalists should\nconform to several ethical obligations:\no Present news stories that inform and serve the needs of citizens.\no Present issues fairly.\no Present stories in a way that addresses their complexity.\no Present diverse perspectives.\no Monitor government and corporations.\n\uf0b7 Responsible journalism:\no Ensures accuracy (even if it means causing delays)\no Reports the truth\no Stays loyal to citizens by putting the public interest above all else\no Is protective and sensitive to those involved in the news\no Remains objective and presents information in a neutral way\no Allows for commentary and opposition\n\uf0b7 All news stories contain some bias because of the diversity of journalists\u2019 perspectives. While the news\nmedia is often criticized for representing a political bias in reporting, ethical journalists always strive to\npresent issues in a fair and comprehensive way.\nEXERCISES\nConduct your own survey of political bias in the news. Choose either a television network or newspaper\nknown for more liberal tendencies, such as CNN or The New York Times, and a network or newspaper\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n651 known for more conservative reporting, such as Fox News or The Washington Times. Examine both\nsources\u2019 coverage of the same news story (not a column or editorial). Then answer the following short-\nanswer questions. Each response should be one to two paragraphs.\n1. What differences do you notice between the two sources\u2019 news coverage?\n2. What evidence, if any, do you find of political bias? If it does exist, what effect do you think this bias\nhas on readers?\n3. Consider the role of the media in delivering news to the public. In your opinion, can both sources\u2019\ncoverage still be characterized as fair and accurate? Why or why not?\n[1] Ellen Goodman, \u201cTemper \u2018Instant\u2019 News Coverage,\u201d Gainesville (FL) Sun, February 7, 1993,\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19930207&id=vt4RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XuoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5028\n,1856837.\n[2] Gordon Govier, \u201cThe Living Room Fixture,\u201d The Evolution of Radio News, 2007,\nhttp://www.radioscribe.com/formats.html.\n[3] Jaime Holguin, \u201cRather Recalls JFK Assassination,\u201d CBS News, February 28, 2005,\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/28/eveningnews/main677096.shtml.\n[4] Patricia Sullivan, \u201cAs the Internet Grows Up, the News Industry Is Forever Changed,\u201dWashington Post, June 19,\n2006, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061300929.html.\n[5] USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, \u201cAnnual Internet Survey by Center for the Digital\nFuture Finds Large Increases in Use of Online Newspapers,\u201d news release, Center for Digital Future, April 2009,\nhttp://annenberg.usc.edu/News%20and%20Events/News/090429CDF.aspx.\n[6] Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, The State of the News Media 2010,\nhttp://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/overview_intro.php.\n[7] Patricia Sullivan, \u201cAs the Internet Grows Up, the News Industry Is Forever Changed,\u201dWashington Post, June 19,\n2006, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061300929.html.\n[8] Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, The State of the News Media 2010.\n[9] Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, The State of the News Media 2010.\n[10] Patricia Sullivan, \u201cAs the Internet Grows Up, the News Industry Is Forever Changed,\u201dWashington Post, June 19,\n2006, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/13/AR2006061300929.html.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n652 [11] Scott Collins and Greg Braxton, \u201cTV Misses Out as Gossip Website TMZ Reports Michael Jackson\u2019s Death\nFirst,\u201d Los Angeles Times, June 26, 2009, http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/26/local/me-jackson-media26.\n[12] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[13] Jeremy Iggers, Good News, Bad News: Journalism Ethics and the Public Interest (Boulder, CO: Westview Press,\n1999), 46.\n[14] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[15] Society of Professional Journalists, \u201cSPJ Code of Ethics,\u201d http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp.\n[16] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[17] American Society of News Editors, \u201cASNE\u2019s Statement of Principles,\u201d August 2009,\nhttp://asne.org/article_view/articleid/325/asnes-statement-of-principles.aspx.\n[18] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[19] Society of Professional Journalists, \u201cSPJ Code of Ethics,\u201d http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp.\n[20] Jeremy Iggers, Good News, Bad News: Journalism Ethics and the Public Interest (Boulder, CO: Westview Press,\n1999), 138.\n[21] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[22] Committee of Concerned Journalists, \u201cStatement of Shared Purpose,\u201d Pew Project for Excellence in\nJournalism, http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles.\n[23] Richard M.

Explain concerns related to surveillance and personal privacy rights introduced by the Internet.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n654 2. Differentiate between copyright infringement and fair use.\n3. Identify plagiarism and copyright concerns introduced by the Internet.\nOnline media has developed rapidly, with technology advancing at a rate that often surpasses the\nability of legislation and policy to keep up with it. As a result, issues like individuals\u2019 rights to privacy,\ncopyright protections, and fair use restrictions have become the subject of numerous court cases and\npublic debates as lawmakers, judges, and civil liberties organizations struggle to define the limits of\ntechnology and the access it provides to previously restricted information. In the following section\nyou will look at some of the most prominent issues in today\u2019s online media environment. We have\nalready considered some of the legal questions surrounding these issues. Here, you should reflect on\nthe ethical issues in mass media raised in the two preceding sections and how they are manifested in\nthe areas of personal privacy, copyright law, and plagiarism.\nPrivacy and Surveillance\nConcerns about online privacy issues in recent years have led some people to wonder whether the\ncollection of personal information on websites has begun to infringe on individuals\u2019 constitutional rights.\nWhile the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly guarantee a general right to privacy, the Bill of Rights\nestablishes privacy of beliefs, privacy of the home, and privacy of person and possessions from\nunreasonable searches. Additionally, in a number of court cases, the \u201cright to liberty\u201d clause has also been\nread as a guarantee of personal privacy. [1] What do these constitutional rights mean when it comes to\nstoring a person\u2019s credit card data online, or tracking his or her Internet searches, or using cookies to\ncollect information about his or her purchasing habits? Because online media is developing so rapidly,\nmany of these issues have not been settled by federal legislation and remain the source of numerous\ncourtroom battles. Consider the 2010 case in which the online services company Yahoo! entered into a\nlegal struggle with government officials who wanted to search the email account of a Yahoo! user for\nincriminating evidence. While Yahoo! claimed the government would need a search warrant to access a\nuser\u2019s email, the government investigators claimed the Fourth Amendment does not apply in the case of\nan email account. [2] Many college students reveal much about themselves on Facebook; they sometimes\nare chagrined to learn that future employers sometimes will view this information.\nIn defense of information collection and surveillance, many websites argue that, by using their services,\nindividuals are agreeing to make their personal information available. However, many people don\u2019t realize\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n655 the extent of surveillance capabilities or know how to protect certain personal information while using\nonline tools. The more people rely on the Internet for shopping, communication, social networking, and\nmedia consumption, the more their personal data is stored online. Every time a person subscribes to a\nmagazine, joins an organization, donates money to charity, gives to a political cause, or searches the pages\nof a government agency, that information is stored in a computer. [3] For example, cookies, text files that\nweb page servers embed in users\u2019 hard drives, help search engines like Google and Yahoo! track their\ncustomers\u2019 search histories, buying habits, and browsing patterns. Cookies stored by Google last for 30\nyears. [4] These search engine cookies are used to customize users\u2019 searches and to deliver customized\nthird-party ads based on a particular user\u2019s demographics and behavior. However, privacy advocates\nclaim this practice fosters predatory advertising. [5] Additionally, considering that search engines receive\nmultiple requests per day for specific information on their users (requests that are often tied to criminal\ninvestigations and lawsuits), there is a growing concern that unfair or even erroneous profiling may\nresult. [6]Much of this information is stored without users\u2019 knowledge or informed consent\u2014although\nagreements for most software inform users when their data is being collected, few people have the\npatience or time to read and understand the dense legalistic language of these agreements. And even\nwhen users invest the time and effort to understand the agreements, they are left with the difficult choice\nof either agreeing to have their data recorded or going without useful software.\nInternet users concerned about their privacy may also be unaware of another growing trend: the\ncombination of online data with offline information to build profiles of web surfers. Data providers like\nBlueKai, Datalogic, and Nielsen are now able to pool offline data and demographics to create \u201cdigital\ndossiers\u201d (detailed digital records of a particular subject or market) for online advertisers who want to\nreach a target market. [7] This combination of online and offline information provides a nearly complete\npicture of someone\u2019s life. If advertisers are looking for a 56-year-old retired female educator who is\ndivorced, owns a home and a dog, suffers from arthritis, and plays tennis at the local fitness club, they can\nnow find her. While advertisers have been careful to point out that people are identified by demographic\nsubgroup but never by name, many organizations that advocate for privacy, such as the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, believe that protections and greater transparency should be enforced. [8]\nFigure 14.7\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n656 Online ads like these target users based on pools of very specific information.\nUsers also supply a wide range of information about themselves through online social networks that is\nconnected with their names, contact information, and photographs. Creditors now look at individuals\u2019\nsocial networks to determine whether they would be good credit customers, and banks may access social\nnetwork information to make loan decisions. [9] If users aren\u2019t careful about their privacy settings on\nMySpace, Twitter, or Facebook, photographs and other private information may be easily accessible to\nanyone performing a Google search. Of even greater concern is the growing trend to publicize information\nthat was previously private as the networking sites evolve and change their interfaces.\nSurveillance can range from the monitoring of online activity by employers and other institutions that\nwant to make sure users are following guidelines, to high-level government investigations of terrorist\nactivity. The USA PATRIOT Act, passed just 6 weeks after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,\nexpanded the federal government\u2019s rights to access citizens\u2019 personal information. Under the Patriot Act,\nauthorities have access to personal records held by Internet service providers and other third parties, and\ngovernment officials can tap in to an individual\u2019s email communications and web searches if he or she is\nsuspected of terrorist activity or of having connections to terrorist activity. [10] One concern among civil\nliberties organizations is that the Patriot Act might become a back door for the government to conduct\nundisclosed surveillance that doesn\u2019t necessarily involve the threat of terrorism. For instance, under the\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n657 Patriot Act the government can wiretap Internet communications even if the primary purpose is a\ncriminal investigation, as long as intelligence gathering is a significant purpose of the investigation. [11]\nFair Use and Plagiarism\nNow that a large amount of research can easily be conducted online, and content can be copied and pasted\nfrom one platform to another with no more than the click of a button, concerns about plagiarism and\ncopyright infringement are more relevant than ever. The concepts of copyright infringement and\nplagiarism can easily be confused with each another. The following provides an overview of copyright, its\nissues and limitations, and its distinction from plagiarism.\nCopyright Infringement\nCopyright is a form of protection provided by U.S. law, under which the creator of an original artistic or\nintellectual work is automatically granted certain rights, including the right to distribute, copy, and\nmodify the work. [12]If someone rents a movie from Netflix, for example, and watches it with his friends, he\nhasn\u2019t violated any copyright laws because Netflix has paid for a license to loan the movie to its customers.\nHowever, if the same person rents a movie and burns himself a copy to watch later, he has violated\ncopyright law because he has not paid for nor obtained the film creators\u2019 permission to copy the movie.\nCopyright law applies to most books, songs, movies, art, essays, and other pieces of creative work.\nHowever, after a certain length of time (70 to 120 years depending on the publication circumstances),\ncreative and intellectual works enter the public domain; that is, they are free to be used and copied\nwithout permission.\nGoogle Books: Turning Copyright Law on Its Head?\nIn 2002, Google began scanning millions of books in academic libraries to make them available online in\ndigital format. Of the more than 12 million books Google has digitized since then\u2014and made searchable\nthrough Google Book Search\u20142 million are in the public domain. Those 2 million books are available in\n\u201cfull view\u201d and free for users to download, while books still under copyright are available as limited\npreviews, where users can access about 20 percent of the texts. According to Google, the project will pave\nthe way for greater democratization of knowledge, making texts available to readers who formerly\nwouldn\u2019t have had access to them. However, many authors, publishers, and legal authorities claim the\nproject represents a massive copyright violation. In 2005, the Authors Guild and the Association of\nAmerican Publishers filed class-action lawsuits against Google. [13]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n658 William Cavanaugh, a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice, claims that the Google Books\nSettlement, an agreement partially reached in 2008, \u201cturns copyright law on its head.\u201d According to the\nsettlement agreement, in exchange for $125 million, part of which would go to authors and publishers,\nGoogle was released from liability for copying the books and was granted the right to charge money for\nindividual and institutional subscriptions to its Google Books service (which gives subscribers full access\nto the copied books\u2014even those under copyright). Authors have the choice to opt out of the agreement,\nasking to have their books removed from Google\u2019s servers. However, more than 30,000 publishers have\nalready made deals with Google, which override the authors\u2019 rights to opt out. [14]\nSome works are in the public domain because the creator has chosen to make them available to anyone\nwithout requiring permission. However, most works are in the public domain because their copyright has\nexpired; in the United States, anything published before 1923 is automatically in the public domain.\nAdditionally, there have been changes to U.S. copyright law over the years that caused some works to\nenter the public domain earlier. Before 1964, for instance, any published work had to have its copyright\nrenewed during the 28th year after its publication. If no renewal was filed, the copyright was lost. Figure\n14.8 shows significant changes to U.S. copyright law since 1790. [15]\nWhile it is illegal to violate the rights granted by copyright law, the copyright holder\u2019s rights are not\nunlimited. One of the significant limitations is the policy of \u201cfair use,\u201d under which the public is entitled to\nfreely use copyrighted information for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching,\nscholarship, research, or parody. [16] If a critic were writing a book review for a magazine, for instance,\naccording to fair use, she would be allowed to summarize and quote from the book she wanted to review,\nwhether or not the author of the book agreed to this use. According to the U.S. government, there are four\nissues to consider when determining fair use:\n1. The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for\nnonprofit educational purposes\n2. The nature of the copyrighted work\n3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole\n4. The effect of the use on the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work [17]\nThe distinction between what is considered fair and what constitutes copyright infringement is not always\nclearly defined. For one thing, there are no guidelines that specify a number of words, lines, or notes that\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n659 can be taken without permission. Table 14.1 \"Cases Involving Fair Use\" provides some examples of\ndistinctions between fair use and copyright infringement.\nTable 14.1 Cases Involving Fair Use\nFair Use Not Fair Use\nWright v.

However, the two words are not\nsynonymous; while there can be some overlap between them, not every instance of plagiarism involves\ncopyright violation, and not every instance of copyright violation is an act of plagiarism. For one thing,\nwhile copyright violation can involve a wide range of acts, plagiarism is defined more narrowly as using\nsomeone else\u2019s information, writing, or speech without properly documenting or citing the source. In\nother words, plagiarism involves representing another person\u2019s work as one\u2019s own. This can happen in any\nfield\u2014for example, in the music industry. In 1990, Vanilla Ice sampled riffs from David Bowie\u2019s Under\nPressure for his hit song, Ice Ice Baby, without licensing or crediting Bowie\u2019s work. Hip hop music, which\nhas a long tradition of \u201csampling\u201d music, riffs, lyrics, and more from other songs, often raises questions of\ncopyright infringement. [18]\nAs the U.S. Copyright Office points out, it is possible to cite a copyrighted source of information without\nobtaining permission to reproduce that information. [19]In such a case, the user has violated copyright law\neven though she has not plagiarized the material. Similarly, a student writing a paper could copy sections\nof a document that is in the public domain without properly citing his sources, in which case he would not\nhave broken any copyright laws. However, representing the information as his own work would be an\ninstance of plagiarism.\nPlagiarism, a perennially serious problem at academic institutions, has recently become even more\nprevalent. The ease of copying and pasting online content into a word-processing document can make it\nhighly tempting for students to plagiarize material for research projects and critical papers. Additionally,\na number of online \u201cpaper mills\u201d contain archives where students can download papers for free or, in\nsome cases, purchase them. [20] Sloppy work habits can lead students to inadvertently plagiarize. In\n2003, The New York Times surveyed students at 23 college campuses and reported that 38 percent of\nstudents admitted to having committed copy-and-paste plagiarism within the previous year. [21]\nTo combat the rise in plagiarism, many schools and universities now subscribe to services that allow\ninstructors to check students\u2019 work for plagiarized material. Plagiarism.org, for instance, offers an\nanalytics tool that compares student writing against a database that includes work from online paper\nmills, academic databases, documents available through major search engines, and other student papers\nsubmitted to Plagiarism.org. [22] According to many researchers, part of the issue may be that students\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n661 don\u2019t understand what constitutes plagiarism. Some students, for instance, claim they think information\navailable online is in the public domain. [23] Figure 14.12 offers suggestions for ways to avoid plagiarism in\nyour own work.\nWays to Avoid Plagiarism\n\uf0b7 Don\u2019t procrastinate.\n\uf0b7 Avoid taking shortcuts.\n\uf0b7 Take thorough notes and keep accurate records.\n\uf0b7 Rephrase ideas in your own words.\n\uf0b7 Provide citations or attributions for all sources.\n\uf0b7 Ask your instructor when in doubt. [24]\nWhile plagiarism is an issue of concern in academia, it occurs in print media as well. Writers, whether\nthrough carelessness or laziness, may lift content from existing materials without properly citing or\nreinterpreting them. In an academic setting, plagiarism may lead to consequences as severe as failure or\neven expulsion from an institution. However, outside of academia the consequences may be even more\ndamaging. Writers have lost publishing contracts, permanently damaged their reputations, and even\nruined their careers over instances of plagiarism. For example, the late George Harrison, of the Beatles,\nwas successfully sued by Ronald Mack for copyright infringement of his song \u201cHe\u2019s So Fine.\u201d [25] It was\ndetermined by the court that Harrison unconsciously plagiarized the musical essence of Mack\u2019s song for\nhis composition \u201cMy Sweet Lord.\u201d\nYou should now have an understanding of the key issues in media ethics, particularly as they relate to\nprivacy rights, plagiarism, and copyright laws. Please ensure you understand the following listed key\nconcepts.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Concerns about the public\u2019s right to privacy have increased in recent years, as more personal\ninformation has become available online.\no Every time someone makes a purchase, performs a web search, accesses a web page, downloads files,\nsends an email, or engages in social networking, that information is stored in a computer and may be\naccessed by third parties under certain conditions.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n662 o The USA PATRIOT Act, passed after the September 11, 2001, attacks, has broadened the federal\ngovernment\u2019s rights to access individuals\u2019 personal records.\no Civil liberties organizations are concerned about clauses of the Patriot Act, such as the one that\nstipulates that the government can wiretap Internet communications as long as intelligence gathering\nis a significant purpose of the investigation.\n\uf0b7 Rules that distinguish copyright violation from fair use are not always entirely clear and have been the\nsubject of debate now that a greater amount of copyrighted work is easily accessible via the Internet.\no Works enter the public domain once their copyright has expired, at which point they can be altered,\ncopied, and distributed freely.\no Because of numerous changes in U.S. copyright laws, some works have entered the public domain\nearlier than others.\no According to the U.S. government, when distinguishing between fair use and copyright infringement,\nthere are four things to consider: whether or not the use is for profit, the nature of the copyrighted\nwork, the percentage of the copyrighted material being used, and the effect of that use on the value of\nthe copyrighted work.\n\uf0b7 Plagiarism is also a growing concern because of the ease of copying and pasting texts from online\nsources into computer documents. It is important to keep in mind that plagiarism and copyright\ninfringement are different issues: plagiarism involves not giving credit to a work\u2019s creator, whereas\ncopyright deals with the legality of using a created work.\nEXERCISES\nYou will now examine several cases in detail to further explore your understanding of the concepts and\nkey ideas covered in this chapter.

Supp. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 1976).\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n668 Chapter 15\nMedia and Government\nFacebook versus the FTC\nIn May 2010, the social networking website Facebook was thrown into the news when its chief executive\nofficer, Mark Zuckerberg, announced new changes to the site\u2019s privacy policy. Although the\nannouncement alone did not necessarily garner heavy attention from the news media, the involvement of\nthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ramped up public interest.\nThe previous month, several watchdog groups had sent letters to Congress and the FTC asking for an\ninvestigation of Facebook\u2019s privacy policy. The letters attacked the site\u2019s privacy policies, which dated\nfrom December 2009 and had been designed to provide users more control over privacy settings.\nHowever, PC Magazine noted, \u201cgiven Facebook\u2019s move toward a more open format as it integrates status\nupdates with search engines like Google and Bing, the site encouraged its users to make more of their data\npublic, and made some of the default settings more open.\u201d [1]\nEssentially, Facebook provides three default options for sharing information: with \u201ceveryone,\u201d \u201cfriends of\nfriends,\u201d or \u201cfriends only.\u201d Zuckerberg explained the privacy policy by saying:\nWe recommended that there be large pieces of information in each of these buckets. For friends\nonly, that\u2019s all of the really sensitive stuff. For friends of friends, it could be who can see the\nphotos and videos of you, which is actually the majority of the content people share on the site.\nAnd then for everyone, it\u2019s basic information and status updates and posts like that. [2]\nConcern grew that some of Facebook\u2019s default privacy settings allowed everyone, regardless of their level\nof connection to a user, to access some personal information. In their open letter to Congress, privacy\nwatchdog groups addressed these concerns by stating, \u201cFacebook continues to manipulate the privacy\nsettings of users and its own policy so that it can take personal information provided by users for a limited\npurpose and make it widely available for commercial purposes\u2026. The company has done this repeatedly\nand users are becoming increasingly angry and frustrated.\u201d [3] In light of users\u2019 outrage, the letter asked\nthe FTC to get involved.\nThe FTC is a congressional commission designed to oversee and enforce consumer protections. Despite\u2014\nor perhaps because of\u2014this stated goal, the FTC\u2019s lack of involvement in Facebook\u2019s privacy settings\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n669 frustrated many individuals; one letter to Congress \u201copenly worried that the FTC either lacked the power\nor the motivation to pursue questions of privacy at Facebook.\u201d [4] The FTC responded that the issue was of\n\u201cparticular interest\u201d to them, but as of this writing, no official action has been taken.\nThe issue has prompted a broader discussion of the government\u2019s role in regulating information\ndisseminated on the Internet. The New York Times articulated the discussion\u2019s central questions: \u201cWhat\ncan government do to ensure that users have control of their own information, which might live on\nindefinitely on the web? Would regulation work? Or should government stay out of this\narena?\u201d [5] Facebook stands by the rights of its users, arguing that \u201cadult users should be free to publish\ninformation about their lives if they choose to do so.\u201d [6] However, Facebook did respond to the open letter\nand modified its privacy settings to make it easier for individuals to control their online identities. Yet the\ndebate continues over online privacy and the government\u2019s role in maintaining this privacy. The recent\nbuzz over Facebook\u2019s privacy policies is just one of many examples of the debate over government\u2019s place\nin the world of media. How is copyright protected across different media outlets? What material is\nconsidered appropriate for broadcast? Does the U.S. government have the right to censor information?\nThis chapter explores these and other questions regarding the long and complex relationship between\nmedia and the government.\n[1] Chloe Albanesius, \u201cFacebook Prepping Changes to Privacy Policy,\u201d PC Magazine, May 21, 2010,\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2364063,00.asp.\n[2] Dan Fletcher, \u201cTime\u2019s Q&A With Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg,\u201d Time NewsFeed (blog),Time, May 27, 2010,\nhttp://newsfeed.time.com/2010/05/27/times-qa-with-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg/\n[3] Mark Hachman, \u201cFacebook Targeted by New FTC Privacy Complaint,\u201d PC Magazine, May 7, 2010,\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363518,00.asp.\n[4] Mark Hachman, \u201cFacebook Targeted by New FTC Privacy Complaint,\u201d PC Magazine, May 7, 2010,\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363518,00.asp.\n[5] New York Times, \u201cShould Government Take On Facebook?\u201d Room for Debate (blog), May 25, 2010,\nhttp://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/should-government-take-on-facebook/.\n[6] New York Times, \u201cShould Government Take On Facebook?\u201d Room for Debate (blog), May 25, 2010,\nhttp://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/should-government-take-on-facebook/.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n670 15.1\nGovernment Regulation of Media\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describe the role of the FTC.\n2. Explain the major duties of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n3. Describe deregulation and its effect on the media landscape.\nThe U.S. federal government has long had its hand in media regulation. Media in all their forms have\nbeen under governmental jurisdiction since the early 1900s. Since that time, regulatory efforts have\ntransformed as new forms of media have emerged and expanded their markets to larger audiences.\nMajor Regulatory Agencies\nThroughout the 20th century, three important U.S. regulatory agencies appeared. Under the auspices of\nthe federal government, these agencies\u2014the FTC, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), and the FCC\u2014\nhave shaped American media and their interactions with both the government and audiences.\nFederal Trade Commission\nThe first stirrings of the FTC date from 1903, when President Theodore Roosevelt created the Bureau of\nCorporations to investigate the practices of increasingly larger American businesses. In time, authorities\ndetermined that an agency with more sweeping powers was necessary. Founded on September 26, 1914,\nthe FTC came into being when President Woodrow Wilson signed the FTC Act into law, creating an\nagency designed to \u201cprevent unfair methods of competition in commerce.\u201d [1] From the beginning, the FTC\nabsorbed the work and staff of the Bureau of Corporations, operating in a similar manner, but with\nadditional regulatory authorization. In the words of the FTC,\nLike the Bureau of Corporations, the FTC could conduct investigations, gather information, and\npublish reports. The early Commission reported on export trade, resale price maintenance, and\nother general issues, as well as meat packing and other specific industries. Unlike the Bureau,\nthough, the Commission could \u2026 challenge \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d under Section 5 of the\nFTC Act, and it could enforce \u2026 more specific prohibitions against certain price discriminations,\nvertical arrangements, interlocking directorships, and stock acquisitions. [2]\nAlthough its primary focus was on the prevention of anticompetitive business practices, in its early years,\nthe FTC also provided oversight on wartime economic practices. During World War I, for example,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n671 President Wilson frequently turned to the FTC for advice on exports and trading with foreign nations,\nresulting in the Trading with the Enemy Act, which restricted trade with countries in conflict with the\nUnited States.\nFederal Radio Commission\nFirst established with the passage of the Radio Act of 1927, the FRC was intended to \u201cbring order to the\nchaotic situation that developed as a result of the breakdown of earlier wireless acts passed during the\nformative years of wireless radio communication.\u201d [3] The FRC comprised five employees who were\nauthorized to grant and deny broadcasting licenses and assign frequency ranges and power levels to each\nradio station.\nIn its early years, the FRC struggled to find its role and responsibility in regulating the radio airwaves.\nWith no clear breakdown of what could or could not be aired, nearly everything was allowed to play. As\nyou learned in Chapter 7 \"Radio\", the FRC lasted only until 1934, when it was engulfed by the FCC.\nFederal Communications Commission\nFigure 15.2\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Federal Communications Commission in 1934 as part of the New\nDeal.\nSince its creation by the Communications Act in 1934, the FCC has been \u201ccharged with regulating\ninterstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable.\u201d [4] Part of the\nNew Deal\u2014President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s Great Depression\u2013era suite of federal programs and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n672 agencies\u2014the commission worked to establish \u201ca rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and\nradio communication service.\u201d [5]\nThe responsibilities of the FCC are broad, and throughout its long history the agency has enforced several\nlaws that regulate media. A selection of these laws include the 1941 National TV Ownership Rule, which\nstates that a broadcaster cannot own television stations that reach more than 35 percent of the nation\u2019s\nhomes; the 1970 Radio/TV Cross-Ownership Restriction, which prohibits a broadcaster from owning a\nradio station and a TV station in the same market; and the 1975 Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership\nProhibition, which discourages ownership of a newspaper and a television station in the same\nmarket. [6] All of these acts and more have undergone changes in the modern media marketplace.\nRegulation Today\nToday, the FCC continues to hold the primary responsibility for regulating media outlets, with the FTC\ntaking on a smaller role. Although each commission holds different roles and duties, the overall purpose\nof governmental control remains to establish and bring order to the media industry while ensuring the\npromulgation of the public good. This section examines the modern duties of both commissions.\nThe Structure and Purposes of the FCC\nThe FCC contains three major divisions: broadcast, telegraph, and telephone. Within these branches,\nsubdivisions allow the agency to more efficiently carry out its tasks. Presently, the FCC houses seven\noperating bureaus and 10 staff offices. Although the bureaus and offices have varying specialties, the\nbureaus\u2019 general responsibilities include \u201cprocessing applications for licenses and other filings; analyzing\ncomplaints; conducting investigations; developing and implementing regulatory programs; and taking\npart in hearings.\u201d [7] Four key bureaus are the Media Bureau, the Wireline Competition Bureau, the\nWireless Telecommunications Bureau, and the International Bureau.\nThe Media Bureau oversees licensing and regulation of broadcasting services. Specifically, the Media\nBureau \u201cdevelops, recommends and administers the policy and licensing programs relating to electronic\nmedia, including cable television, broadcast television, and radio in the United States and its\nterritories.\u201d [8] Because it aids the FCC in its decisions to grant or withhold licenses from broadcast\nstations, the Media Bureau plays a particularly important role within the organization. Such decisions are\nbased on the \u201ccommission\u2019s own evaluation of whether the station has served in the public interest,\u201d and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n673 come primarily from the Media Bureau\u2019s recommendations. [9]The Media Bureau has been central to\nrulings on children\u2019s programming and mandatory closed captioning.\nThe Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB) is primarily responsible for \u201crules and policies concerning\ntelephone companies that provide interstate\u2014and, under certain circumstances, intrastate\u2014\ntelecommunications services to the public through the use of wire-based transmission facilities (i.e.\ncorded/cordless telephones).\u201d [10] Despite the increasing market for wireless-based communications in the\nUnited States, the WCB maintains its large presence in the FCC by \u201censuring choice, opportunity, and\nfairness in the development of wireline telecommunications services and markets.\u201d [11] In addition to this\nprimary goal, the bureau\u2019s objectives include \u201cdeveloping deregulatory initiatives; promoting\neconomically efficient investment in wireline telecommunications services; and fostering economic\ngrowth.\u201d [12] The WCB recently ruled against Comcast regarding blocked online content to the public,\ncausing many to question the amount of authority that the government has over the public and big\nbusinesses.\nAnother prominent bureau within the FCC is the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB). The rough\ncounterpart of the WCB, this bureau oversees mobile phones, pagers, and two-way radios, handling \u201call\nFCC domestic wireless telecommunications programs and policies, except those involving public safety,\nsatellite communications or broadcasting, including licensing, enforcement, and regulatory\nfunctions.\u201d [13] The WTB balances the expansion and limitation of wireless networks, registers antenna\nand broadband use, and manages the radio frequencies for airplane, ship, and land communication. As\nU.S. wireless communication continues to grow, this bureau seems likely to continue to increase in both\nscope and importance.\nFinally, the International Bureau is responsible for representing the FCC in all satellite and international\nmatters. A larger organization, the International Bureau\u2019s goal is to \u201cconnect the globe for the good of\nconsumers through prompt authorizations, innovative spectrum management and responsible global\nleadership.\u201d [14] In an effort to avoid international interference, the International Bureau coordinates with\npartners around the globe regarding frequency allocation and orbital assignments. It also concerns itself\nwith foreign investment in the United States, ruling that outside governments, individuals, or\ncorporations cannot own more than 20 percent of stock in a U.S. broadcast, telephone, or radio company.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n674 The Structure and Purposes of the FTC\nAlthough the FCC provides most of the nation\u2019s media regulations, the FTC also has a hand in the media\nindustry. As previously discussed, the FTC primarily dedicates itself to eliminating unfair business\npractices; however, in the course of those duties it has limited contact with media outlets.\nOne example of the FTC\u2019s media regulatory responsibility is the National Do Not Call Registry. In 2004,\nthe agency created this registry to prevent most telemarketing phone calls, exempting such groups as\nnonprofit charities and businesses with which a consumer has an existing relationship. Although\noriginally intended for landline phones, the Do Not Call Registry allows individuals to register wireless\ntelephones along with traditional wire-based numbers.\nRole of Antitrust Legislation\nAs discussed in Chapter 13 \"Economics of Mass Media\", the federal government has long regulated\ncompanies\u2019 business practices. Over the years, several antitrust acts (law discouraging the formation of\nmonopolies) have been passed into law.\nDuring the 1880s, Standard Oil was the first company to form a trust (a unit of business made up of a\nboard of trustees, formed to monopolize an industry), an \u201carrangement by which stockholders \u2026\ntransferred their shares to a single set of trustees.\u201d [15] With corporate trustees receiving profits from the\ncomponent companies, Standard Oil functioned as a monopoly (a business that economically controls a\nproduct or a service). The Sherman Antitrust Act was put into place in 1890 to dissolve trusts such as\nthese. The Act stated that any combination \u201cin the form of trust or otherwise that was in restraint of trade\nor commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations\u201d was illegal. [16]\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act served as a precedent for future antitrust regulation. As discussed in Chapter\n13 \"Economics of Mass Media\", the 1914 Clayton Antitrust Act and the 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act expanded\non the principles laid out in the Sherman Act. The Clayton Act helped establish the foundation for many of\ntoday\u2019s business and media competition regulatory practices. Although the Sherman Act established\nregulations in the United States, the Clayton Act further developed the rules surrounding antitrust, giving\nbusinesses a \u201cfair warning\u201d about the dangers of anticompetitive practice. [17] Specifically, the Clayton Act\nprohibits actions that may \u201csubstantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of\ncommerce.\u201d [18]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n675 The problem with the Clayton Act was that, while it prohibited mergers, it offered a loophole in that\ncompanies were allowed to buy individual assets of competitors (such as stocks or patents), which could\nstill lead to monopolies. Established in 1950 and often referred to as the Antimerger Act, the Cellar-\nKefauver Act closed that loophole by giving the government the power to stop vertical mergers. (Vertical\nmergers happen when two companies in the same business but on different levels\u2014such as a tire company\nand a car company\u2014combine.) The act also banned asset acquisitions that reduced competition. [19]\nThese laws reflected growing concerns in the early and mid-20th century that the trend toward\nmonopolization could lead to the extinction of competition, thus leading to less choice and potentially\nhigher prices. Government regulation of businesses increased until the 1980s, when the United States\nexperienced a shift in mind-set and citizens called for less governmental power. The U.S. government\nresponded as deregulation became the norm.\nMove Toward Deregulation\nMedia deregulation actually began during the 1970s as the FCC shifted its approach to radio and\ntelevision regulation. Begun as a way of clearing laws to make the FCC run more efficiently and cost\neffectively, deregulation truly took off with the arrival of the Reagan administration and its new FCC\nchairman, Mark Fowler, in 1981. The FCC began overturning existing rules and experienced \u201can overall\nreduction in FCC oversight of station and network operations.\u201d [20]Between 1981 and 1985, lawmakers\ndramatically altered laws and regulation to give more power to media licensees and to reduce that of the\nFCC. Television licenses were expanded from three years to five, and corporations were now allowed to\nown up to 12 separate television stations.\nThe shift in regulatory control had a powerful effect on the media landscape. Whereas initially laws had\nprohibited companies from owning media entities in more than one medium, consolidation created large\nmass-media companies that increasingly dominated the U.S. and global media system. Before the increase\nin deregulation, eight major companies controlled phone services to different regions of the United States.\nToday, however, there are four. [21] Companies such as Viacom and Disney own television stations, record\ncompanies, and magazines. Bertelsmann alone owns more than 30 radio stations, 280 publishing outlets,\nand 15 record companies. [22] Due to this rapid consolidation, Congress grew concerned about the costs of\nderegulation, and by the late 1980s, it began to slow the FCC\u2019s release of control.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n676 Today, deregulation remains a hotly debated topic. Some favor deregulation, believing that the public\nbenefits from less governmental control. Others, however, argue that excessive consolidation of media\nownership threatens the system of checks and balances. [23] Proponents on both sides of the argument are\nequally vocal, and it is likely that regulation of media will ebb and flow over the years, as it has since\nregulation first came into practice.\nInternet Censorship Around the World\nIs what you see on the Internet being censored? In Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social Media\", you read\nabout the debate between the search engine Google and China. However, Internet censorship is much\nmore widespread, affecting people from Germany to Thailand to the United States. And now, thanks to a\nnew online service, you can see for yourself.\nIn September 2010, Google launched its new web tool, Google Transparency. This program allows users to\nsee a map of online censorship around the world. With this tool, people can view the number of times a\ncountry requests data to be removed, what kind of data they request be removed, and the percentage of\nrequests that Google complies with. In some cases, the content is minor\u2014YouTube videos that violate\ncopyright, for example, are frequent offenders. In other cases, the requests are more formidable; Iran\nblocked all of YouTube after the disputed 2009 elections, and Pakistan blocked the site for more than a\nweek in response to a 2010 online protest. Perhaps most surprising is the amount of requests from\ncountries not normally associated with strict censorship. Germany, for example, has banned content it\ndeems to be affiliated with neo-Nazism, and Thailand refuses to allow videos of its king that it finds\noffensive. Between January and June 2010, the United States asked Google 4,287 times for information\nregarding its users, and sent 128 requests to the search engine to remove data. Eighty percent of the time,\nGoogle complied with the requests for data removal. [24]\nWhat is the general trend in Internet censorship? According to Google, it\u2019s becoming more and more\ncommonplace every year. However, the search engine hopes that its new tool will combat this trend. A\nspokesperson for the company said, \u201cThe openness and freedom that have shaped the internet as a\npowerful tool has come under threats from governments who want to control that technology.\u201d By giving\nusers access to censorship numbers, Google allows them to witness the amount of Internet censorship\nthat they are subject to in their everyday lives. As censorship increases, many predict that citizen outrage\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n677 will increase as well. The future of Internet censorship may be unsure, but for now, at least, the numbers\nare visible to all.

Identify important laws that relate to different aspects of the media.\n2. Explain the effects of important laws on media outlets and audiences.\nMedia law has been a much-debated topic ever since the first U.S. media industry laws appeared in\nthe early 1900s. The contention surrounding media law largely stems from the liberties guaranteed\nunder the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which includes the freedom of the press.\nGenerally speaking, media law comprises two areas: telecommunications law, which regulates radio\nand television broadcasts, and print law, which addresses publications such as books, newspapers,\nand magazines. Despite differences between the two areas, many media laws involve First\nAmendment protections. This section explores several areas of media law: privacy, libel and slander,\ncopyright and intellectual property, freedom of information, and equal time and coverage.\nPrivacy, as you have likely noticed, has been a theme in many chapters. The media and privacy\nintersect in many arenas, including the legal arena. In 1974, Congress passed the Privacy Act, which\n\u201cprotects records that can be retrieved by personal identifiers such as a name, social security\nnumber, or other identifying number or symbol.\u201d [1] This act also regulates how agencies can collect,\nstore, and use information and requires agencies to tell individuals when they are collecting\ninformation about them. Designed to ensure that all First Amendment guarantees remain honored,\nthe act requires all public and private agencies to function within its boundaries.\nUnder the Privacy Act, media personnel must be careful to avoid revealing certain information about\nan individual without his or her permission, even if that portrayal is factually accurate. Privacy laws,\nincluding the Privacy Act, \u201climit \u2026 your ability to publish private facts about someone and recognize\n\u2026 an individual\u2019s right to stop you from using his or her name, likeness, and other personal\nattributes for certain exploitative purposes.\u201d [2] Members of the media can avoid the pitfalls of privacy\nlaws by maintaining a professional relationship with the community upon which they report. To\navoid liability, journalists and other media professionals are encouraged to report or comment only\non \u201cmatters of legitimate public interest and only portray people who have a reasonable relationship\nto [their] topic.\u201d [3] In 2005, a legal dispute arose between congressional aides Robert Steinbuch and\nJessica Cutler. Steinbuch sued Cutler for publishing information about their intimate relationship;\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n680 however, the case was dismissed when the court decided that Cutler had only provided facts that\nwere already publically known. [4]\nLibel and Slander\nMedia outlets also must be wary of committing acts of defamation. These occur when false statements\nthat can harm a reputation are printed, broadcast, spoken, or otherwise communicated to others. Two\ndifferent types of legal protections, libel and slander laws, exist to prevent such defamation from taking\nplace and can extend to individuals, groups, and even companies. Although defamation encompasses both\ncategories, they are separate concepts. Libel refers to written statements or printed visual depictions,\nwhile slander refers to verbal statements and gestures. [5] State jurisdiction largely covers libel and slander\nlaws, but they are nearly identical throughout the United States.\nAs with privacy laws, print and broadcast journalists can protect themselves from defamation lawsuits by\ncarrying out responsible reporting. Media personnel are legally protected when communicating a report\noutweighs any potential damage to a person\u2019s reputation. However, when journalists do not report\nresponsibly, the legal and financial consequences can be devastating. In the 2007 case Murphy vs. Boston\nHerald, the Boston Herald newspaper was sued for misquoting Massachusetts Superior Court Judge\nErnest Murphy. The court ruled that the false quote was published with a malicious intent and awarded\nMurphy $2.1 million in damages. [6] In the more famous case of Linda Tripp in 1998, Tripp was charged\nwith secretly recording phone conversations between herself and Monica Lewinsky, who had a sexual\nrelationship with President Bill Clinton. Tripp faced a prison sentence of 10 years for slander and illegal\ndocumentation; however, the case was dropped in early 2000 due to witness bias. [7] More recently, David\nand Victoria Beckham sued their former nanny for telling the tabloids that their marriage is in trouble.\nThe nanny\u2019s contract contained an agreement not to talk about the celebrity couple\u2019s private lives. [8]\nCopyright and Intellectual Property\nCopyright laws fall under federal jurisdiction and are, therefore, identical across the country. As you\nlearned in Chapter 4 \"Newspapers\", Congress first established U.S. copyright and patent protections in\n1790 and, despite revisions and updates, has maintained some form of copyright law to this day. With\ncoverage of a wide range of materials, copyright law encompasses \u201calmost all creative work that can be\nwritten down or otherwise captured in a tangible medium.\u201d [9] This includes literary works; musical works;\ndramatic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works;\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n681 sound recordings; and even architectural works. Once a work has achieved copyright, the copyright owner\nmust grant permission for that work to be legally reproduced. After a certain number of years, a copyright\nexpires and the work enters the public domain.\nCopyright does not, however, protect facts. This is of particular importance for news media. Despite the\nlength of time it takes to uncover facts, no individual or company can own them. Anyone may repeat facts\nas long as that person does not copy the written story or broadcast in which those facts were\ncommunicated.\nIntellectual property law protects \u201cproducts of the mind,\u201d including copyrights, patents, open licenses,\ntrademarks, trade secrets, URLs, domain names, and even components of television programs (as David\nLetterman found out when he moved from NBC to CBS, and was forced to leave certain aspects of his\ntelevision show behind). Intellectual property law generally follows the same guidelines as copyright law,\nand the associated legislation seeks \u201cto encourage innovation and creativity, with an ultimate aim of\npromoting a general benefit to society.\u201d [10]The role of copyright and intellectual property in the mass\nmedia will be covered in greater detail later in this chapter.\nFreedom of Information Act\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson first signed the Freedom of Information Act(FOIA) into law in 1966. By\nrequiring full or partial disclosure of U.S. government information and documents, the act \u201chelps the\npublic keep track of its government\u2019s actions, from the campaign expenditures of city commission\ncandidates to federal agencies\u2019 management of billions of dollars in tax revenues.\u201d [11] Because it allows\neveryone access to federal documents and information that otherwise would go unreleased, FOIA is\nparticularly important for those working in the news media.\nAlthough the act covers a large range of agencies, some offices are exempt from FOIA. The act provides\naccess to the public records of the executive branch of the U.S. government but does not include\ndocuments from the current president, Congress, or the judicial branch. [12] Because FOIA pertains to\nindividuals and information in high levels of government, the process of accessing information can be\ncomplicated. Those who are interested must become skilled at navigating the complex set of procedures to\noffer citizens accurate information. Although FOIA allows any person for any reason access to the records,\njournalists who work for mainstream media organizations often receive perks such as the waiving of fees\nand expedited processing. [13]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n682 The Equal Time Rule\nFalling under broadcast regulations, the Communication Act\u2019s Section 315\u2014also known as the Equal Time\nRule\u2014requires radio and television stations to give equal opportunity for airtime to all candidates.\nEssentially, Section 315 ensures that television and radio stations cannot favor any one political candidate\nover another.\nPassed by Congress in 1927, the equal opportunity requirement was the first major federal broadcasting\nlaw. Legislators feared that broadcasters and stations would be able to manipulate elections by giving one\ncandidate ample air time. Although candidates cannot receive free airtime unless their opponents do as\nwell, the law doesn\u2019t take into consideration campaign funding. Well-funded candidates who can afford to\npay for airtime still have an advantage over their poorly funded peers. Controversies over campaign\nfinancing are directly tied to the high cost of political campaign advertising, especially over television.\nNews programs, interviews, and documentaries are exempt from the requirements of Section 315. This\nallows media outlets to report on the activities of a candidate without also having to cover the activities of\nhis or her opponent. Presidential debates fall under this exemption as well and are not required to include\nthird-party candidates.\nSection 315 also prohibits media from censoring what a candidate says or presents on air. Recently there\nhas been controversy over campaign ads picturing aborted fetuses. Citing Section 315, the FCC allowed\nthese television ads to continue to run. [14]\nThe Fairness Doctrine\nAs discussed in Chapter 7 \"Radio\", the Fairness Doctrine was enacted in 1949, when applications for radio\nbroadcast licenses outpaced the number of available frequencies. At the time, concerns that broadcasters\nmight use their stations to promote a particular perspective encouraged the creation of the radio-specific\nversion of Section 315. The FCC thus instituted the Fairness Doctrine to \u201censure that all coverage of\ncontroversial issues by a broadcast station be balanced and fair.\u201d [15]\nThe FCC took the view \u2026 that station licensees were \u201cpublic trustees,\u201d and as such had an\nobligation to afford reasonable opportunity for discussion of contrasting points of view on\ncontroversial issues. The commission later held that stations were also obligated to actively seek\nout issues of importance to their community and air programming that addressed those\nissues. [16]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n683 The Fairness Doctrine was considered controversial among journalists who felt that it infringed on the\nrights of free speech and freedom of press granted in the First Amendment. The doctrine was dissolved\nduring the 1980s with the Reagan administration\u2019s deregulatory efforts. We can see these effects today\nwith the popularity of political talk radio. Stations do not have to assure that all sides of an issue are\ndiscussed.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act\nIn 1998, Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to bring order to the then-\nlargely-unregulated online arena. As discussed in Chapter 13 \"Economics of Mass Media\", the DMCA\nprohibits individuals from either circumventing access-control measures or trafficking devices that may\nhelp others circumvent copyright measures. Under this act, it is illegal to use code-cracking devices to\nillegally copy software, and websites are required to take down material that infringes on copyrights.\n(You\u2019ve experienced this regulation yourself if you\u2019ve ever visited YouTube or Google Video and found\nthat a video has been removed due to copyright claims.)\nThe DMCA does allow webcasting (the broadcasting of media over the Internet) as long as webcasters pay\nlicensing fees to the companies that own the material. This allows sites such as Hulu to legally stream\nmovies and television shows to viewers. The DMCA also protects institutes of higher education, including\ndistance-learning programs, from certain copyright liabilities. [17]\nOne of the most controversial aspects of the DMCA is that, while it requires websites to remove\ncopyrighted material, it does not require websites to monitor their content. A 3-year-long court battle\nbetween media giant Viacom and the Google-owned website YouTube was recently waged over this factor.\nViacom argued that YouTube infringed on its rights by hosting copyrighted videos. Google responded that\nwhile YouTube may include copyrighted material, it is not required to scan every user-uploaded video for\ncopyright infringement. When a claim is brought against a YouTube video, the video is removed\u2014beyond\nthat, the website is not responsible for content. The judge ruled in favor of Google, stating that it was\nindeed protected under the DMCA. While many saw this as a victory for Internet freedom, others warned\nthat it would have future consequences for the protection of copyright holders. [18]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The Privacy Act works to guarantee privacy to individuals and controls how personal information is used.\nDefamation in the written form (libel) or the spoken form (slander) is illegal in the United States.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n684 \uf0b7 Questions for Section 315 (Equal Time Rule) ensures that broadcast media cannot favor any one\ncandidate over another by granting one more time than another. The Fairness Doctrine ensured that\nradio stations offered equal time to opposing viewpoints.\n\uf0b7 The Freedom of Information Act grants the public, including the news media, access to many government\ndocuments. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, established in 1998, extended existing copyright laws\nto encompass and protect information online.\nEXERCISES\nVisit the website of a major media outlet and examine the coverage of a recent local, state, or national\nelection.

Explain the FCC\u2019s process of classifying material as indecent, obscene, or profane.\n2. Describe how the Hay\u2019s Code affected 20th-century American mass media.\nFigure 15.3\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n686 Attempts to censor material, such as banning books, typically attract a great deal of\ncontroversy and debate.\nTo fully understand the issues of censorship and freedom of speech and how they apply to modern\nmedia, we must first explore the terms themselves. Censorship is defined as suppressing or removing\nanything deemed objectionable. A common, everyday example can be found on the radio or\ntelevision, where potentially offensive words are \u201cbleeped\u201d out. More controversial is censorship at a\npolitical or religious level. If you\u2019ve ever been banned from reading a book in school, or watched a\n\u201cclean\u201d version of a movie on an airplane, you\u2019ve experienced censorship.\nMuch as media legislation can be controversial due to First Amendment protections, censorship in\nand of the media is often hotly debated. The First Amendment states that \u201cCongress shall make no\nlaw\u2026abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d [1] Under this definition, the term \u201cspeech\u201d\nextends to a broader sense of \u201cexpression,\u201d meaning verbal, nonverbal, visual, or symbolic\nexpression. Historically, many individuals have cited the First Amendment when protesting FCC\ndecisions to censor certain media products or programs. However, what many people do not realize\nis that U.S. law establishes several exceptions to free speech, including defamation, hate speech,\nbreach of the peace, incitement to crime, sedition, and obscenity.\nClassifying Material as Indecent, Obscene, or Profane\nTo comply with U.S. law, the FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene programming. The FCC\ndecides whether or not material is obscene by using a three-prong test.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n687 Obscene material has the following characteristics:\n1. Causes the average person to have lustful or sexual thoughts\n2. Depicts lawfully offensive sexual conduct\n3. Lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\nMaterial meeting all of these criteria is officially considered obscene and usually applies to hard-core\npornography. [2] \u201cIndecent\u201d material, on the other hand, is protected by the First Amendment and cannot\nbe banned entirely.\nIndecent material has the following characteristics:\n1. Contains graphic sexual or excretory depictions\n2. Dwells at length on depictions of sexual or excretory organs\n3. Is used simply to shock or arouse an audience\nMaterial deemed indecent cannot be broadcast between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., to make it less\nlikely that children will be exposed to it. [3]\nThese classifications symbolize the media\u2019s long struggle with what is considered appropriate and\ninappropriate material. Despite the existence of the guidelines, however, the process of categorizing\nmaterials is a long and arduous one.\nThere is a formalized process for deciding what material falls into which category. First, the FCC relies on\ntelevision audiences to alert the agency of potentially controversial material that may require\nclassification. The commission asks the public to file a complaint via letter, email, fax, telephone, or the\nagency\u2019s website, including the station, the community, and the date and time of the broadcast. The\ncomplaint should \u201ccontain enough detail about the material broadcast that the FCC can understand the\nexact words and language used.\u201d [4] Citizens are also allowed to submit tapes or transcripts of the aired\nmaterial. Upon receiving a complaint, the FCC logs it in a database, which a staff member then accesses to\nperform an initial review. If necessary, the agency may contact either the station licensee or the individual\nwho filed the complaint for further information.\nOnce the FCC has conducted a thorough investigation, it determines a final classification for the material.\nIn the case of profane or indecent material, the agency may take further actions, including possibly fining\nthe network or station. [5] If the material is classified as obscene, the FCC will instead refer the matter to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n688 the U.S. Department of Justice, which has the authority to criminally prosecute the media outlet. If\nconvicted in court, violators can be subject to criminal fines and/or imprisonment. [6]\nEach year, the FCC receives thousands of complaints regarding obscene, indecent, or profane\nprogramming. While the agency ultimately defines most programs cited in the complaints as appropriate,\nmany complaints require in-depth investigation and may result in fines called notices of apparent liability\n(NAL) or federal investigation.\nTable 15.1 FCC Indecency Complaints and NALs: 2000\u20132005\nYear Total Radio Over-the-Air Cable Total Total Total\nComplaints Programs Television Programs Radio Television Cable\nReceived Complained Programs Complained NALs NALs NALs\nAbout Complained About\nAbout\n2000 111 85 25 1 7 0 0\n2001 346 113 33 6 6 1 0\n2002 13,922 185 166 38 7 0 0\n2003 166,683 122 217 36 3 0 0\n2004 1,405,419 145 140 29 9 3 0\n2005 233,531 488 707 355 0 0 0\nSource: http://fcc.gov/eb/oip/ComplStatChart.pdf\nViolence and Sex: Taboos in Entertainment\nAlthough popular memory thinks of old black-and-white movies as tame or sanitized, many early\nfilmmakers filled their movies with sexual or violent content. Edwin S. Porter\u2019s 1903 silent film The Great\nTrain Robbery, for example, is known for expressing \u201cthe appealing, deeply embedded nature of violence\nin the frontier experience and the American civilizing process,\u201d and showcases \u201cthe rather spontaneous\nway that the attendant violence appears in the earliest developments of cinema.\u201d [7] The film ends with an\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n689 image of a gunman firing a revolver directly at the camera, demonstrating that cinema\u2019s fascination with\nviolence was present even 100 years ago.\nPorter was not the only U.S. filmmaker working during the early years of cinema to employ graphic\nviolence. Films such as Intolerance (1916) and The Birth of a Nation (1915) are notorious for their overt\nportrayals of violent activities. The director of both films, D. W. Griffith, intentionally portrayed content\ngraphically because he \u201cbelieved that the portrayal of violence must be uncompromised to show its\nconsequences for humanity.\u201d [8]\nHays Code\nAlthough audiences responded eagerly to the new medium of film, some naysayers believed that\nHollywood films and their associated hedonistic culture was a negative moral influence. As you read\nin Chapter 8 \"Movies\", this changed during the 1930s with the implementation of the Hays Code.\nFormally termed the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, the code is popularly known by the name of\nits author, Will Hays, the chairman of the industry\u2019s self-regulatory Motion Picture Producers and\nDistributors Association (MPPDA), which was founded in 1922 to \u201cpolice all in-house\nproductions.\u201d [9] Created to forestall what was perceived to be looming governmental control over the\nindustry, the Hays Code was, essentially, Hollywood self-censorship. The code displayed the motion\npicture industry\u2019s commitment to the public, stating the following:\nMotion picture producers recognize the high trust and confidence which have been placed in them\nby the people of the world and which have made motion pictures a universal form of\nentertainment\u2026. Hence, though regarding motion pictures primarily as entertainment without\nany explicit purposes of teaching or propaganda, they know that the motion picture within its\nown field of entertainment may be directly responsible for spiritual or moral progress, for higher\ntypes of social life, and for much correct thinking. [10]\nAmong other requirements, the Hays Code enacted strict guidelines on the portrayal of violence. Crimes\nsuch as murder, theft, robbery, safecracking, and \u201cdynamiting of trains, mines, buildings, etc.\u201d could not\nbe presented in detail.[11] The code also addressed the portrayals of sex, saying that \u201cthe sanctity of the\ninstitution of marriage and the home shall be upheld. Pictures shall not infer that low forms of sex\nrelationship are the accepted or common thing.\u201d [12]\nFigure 15.4\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n690 As the chairman of the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association, Will Hays oversaw the creation of\nthe industry\u2019s self-censoring Hays Code.\nAs television grew in popularity during the mid-1900s, the strict code placed on the film industry spread\nto other forms of visual media. Many early sitcoms, for example, showed married couples sleeping in\nseparate twin beds to avoid suggesting sexual relations.\nBy the end of the 1940s, the MPPDA had begun to relax the rigid regulations of the Hays Code. Propelled\nby the changing moral standards of the 1950s and 1960s, this led to a gradual reintroduction of violence\nand sex into mass media.\nRatings Systems\nAs filmmakers began pushing the boundaries of acceptable visual content, the Hollywood studio industry\nscrambled to create a system to ensure appropriate audiences for films. In 1968, the successor of the\nMPDDA, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), established the familiar film ratings system\nto help alert potential audiences to the type of content they could expect from a production.\nFilm Ratings\nAlthough the ratings system changed slightly in its early years, by 1972 it seemed that the MPAA had\nsettled on its ratings. These ratings consisted of G (general audiences), PG (parental guidance suggested),\nR (restricted to age 17 or up unless accompanied by a parent), and X (completely restricted to age 17 and\nup). The system worked until 1984, when several major battles took place over controversial material.\nDuring that year, the highly popular films Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Gremlins both\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n691 premiered with a PG rating. Both films\u2014and subsequently the MPAA\u2014received criticism for the explicit\nviolence presented on screen, which many viewers considered too intense for the relatively mild PG\nrating. In response to the complaints, the MPAA introduced the PG-13 rating to indicate that some\nmaterial may be inappropriate for children under the age of 13. Examples of films with a PG-13 rating\ninclude Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011), Avatar (2009), The Dark Knight (2008),\nand Titanic (1999).\nAnother change came to the ratings system in 1990, with the introduction of the NC-17 rating. Carrying\nthe same restrictions as the existing X rating, the new designation came at the behest of the film industry\nto distinguish mature films from pornographic ones. Examples of films with an NC-17 rating include\nShowgirls (1995) and Crash (1996). Despite the arguably milder format of the rating\u2019s name, many\nfilmmakers find it too strict in practice; receiving an NC-17 rating often leads to a lack of promotion or\ndistribution because numerous movie theaters and rental outlets refuse to carry films with this rating.\nTelevision and Video Game Ratings\nRegardless of these criticisms, most audience members find the rating system helpful, particularly when\ndetermining what is appropriate for children. The adoption of industry ratings for television programs\nand video games reflects the success of the film ratings system. During the 1990s, for example, the\nbroadcasting industry introduced a voluntary rating system not unlike that used for films to accompany\nall television shows. These ratings are displayed on screen during the first 15 seconds of a program and\ninclude TV-Y (all children), TV-Y7 (children age 7 and above), TV-Y7-FV (older children\u2014fantasy\nviolence), TV-G (general audience), TV-PG (parental guidance suggested), TV-14 (parents strongly\ncautioned), and TV-MA (mature audiences only).\nTable 15.2 Television Ratings System\nRating Meaning Examples of Programs\nTV-Y Appropriate for all children Sesame Street, Barney & Friends, Dora the\nExplorer\nTV-Y7 Designed for children 7 and above SpongeBob SquarePants, Captain Planet\nTV-Y7- Directed toward older children; includes depictions of The Powerpuff Girls, Pok\u00e9mon, Avatar:\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n692 Rating Meaning Examples of Programs\nFV fantasy violence The Last Airbender\nTV-G Suitable for general audiences; contains little or no Hannah Montana, The Price Is\nviolence, no strong language, and little or no sexual Right, American Idol\nmaterial\nTV-PG Parental guidance suggested The Simpsons, Seinfeld, Tyler Perry\u2019s\nHouse of Payne\nTV-14 Parents strongly cautioned; contains suggestive dialogue, Saturday Night Live, Keeping Up With the\nstrong language, and sexual or violent situations Kardashians, Jersey Shore\nTV-MA Mature audiences only South Park, The Boondocks, The Shield\nSource: http://www.tvguidelines.org/ratings.htm\nAt about the same time that television ratings appeared, the Entertainment Software Rating Board was\nestablished to provide ratings on video games. Video game ratings include EC (early childhood), E\n(everyone), E 10+ (ages 10 and older), T (teen), M (mature), and AO (adults only).\nTable 15.3 Video Game Ratings System\nRating Meaning Examples of Games\nEC Designed for early childhood, children ages 3 and older Nickelodeon BINGO,Winnie the Pooh\nABC\u2019s, Elmo\u2019s World\nE Suitable for everyone over the age of 6; contains minimal Tiger Woods PGA Tour, Little Big\nfantasy violence and mild language Planet,Frogger, Myst\nE 10+ Appropriate for ages 10 and older; may contain more violence Dance Dance Revolution, Tales of\nand/or slightly suggestive themes Monkey Island, Rock\nBand, Scribblenauts\nT Content is appropriate for teens (ages 13 and older); may Final Fantasy XIV,The Sims 3, Super\ncontain violence, crude humor, sexually suggestive themes, Smash Bros.

One of the top-selling video game series in the world, Grand Theft Auto, is highly controversial\nbecause players have the option to solicit prostitutes or murder civilians. [13] In 2010, a report claimed that\n\u201c38 percent of the female characters in video games are scantily clad, 23 percent baring breasts or\ncleavage, 31 percent exposing thighs, another 31 percent exposing stomachs or midriffs, and 15 percent\nbaring their behinds.\u201d[14] Despite multiple lawsuits, some video game creators stand by their decisions to\nplace graphic displays of violence and sex in their games on the grounds of freedom of speech.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The U.S. Government devised the three-prong test to determine if material can be considered \u201cobscene.\u201d\nThe FCC applies these guidelines to determine whether broadcast content can be classified as profane,\nindecent, or obscene.\n\uf0b7 Established during the 1930s, the Hays Code placed strict regulations on film, requiring that filmmakers\navoid portraying violence and sex in films.\n\uf0b7 After the decline of the Hays Code during the 1960s, the MPAA introduced a self-policed film ratings\nsystem. This system later inspired similar ratings for television and video game content.\nEXERCISES\nLook over the MPAA\u2019s explanation of each film rating online athttp://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-\nrating-means.

Determine the importance of ethical and legal compliance in online interactions.\n2. Identify the role of copyright protection in cyberspace.\n3. Describe the RIAA\u2019s antipiracy efforts.\n4. Explain why complete privacy does not exist online.\nSince its inception, the Internet has posed problems of who owns the content. Over the years, the\ngovernment has struggled to find ways to introduce copyright protections into the online\nenvironment because, unlike other forms of media, the Internet enables users to make an unlimited\nnumber of copies of material and to transmit that information around the world. [1] In this section,\nwe explore the unique challenges presented in dealing with online copyright and intellectual\nproperty and the U.S. government\u2019s role in regulating those fields.\nOnline Creativity and Intellectual Property Rights\nCongress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 to establish a protocol for online copyright\nmatters. Yet the nature of the Internet causes very different copyright and intellectual property issues\nthan older forms of media do. Because of the ease of sharing information online, for example, the DMCA\nhas not worked as Congress expected. [2] Copying and sharing materials online is relatively simple and, as\nsuch, piracy and rights infringement run rampant. In fact, many have argued that despite the DMCA\u2019s\nattempt to stop piracy, in practice, it has done nothing. [3] Additionally, because information is\ndisseminated so rapidly online, piracy opponents struggle with determining the rightful owner of a\nparticular copyright.\nThe DMCA and its role in Internet policing have frustrated many online users and watchdog groups. The\nElectronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) claims that \u201cthe DMCA has become a serious threat that\njeopardizes fair use, impedes competition and innovation, chills free expression and scientific research,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n696 and interferes with computer intrusion laws.\u201d [4] In 2004, comic book company Marvel Entertainment\nsued game publishers NCsoft and Cryptic for copyright infringement in their online game City of Heroes.\nMarvel argued that players could use the character customization system in City of Heroes to make\ncharacters look almost identical to Marvel characters. [5] Situations like this led groups such as the EFF to\npublically call for DMCA reform. Such disputes serve as reminders of the challenges inherent in issuing\ncopyrights and intellectual property rights for the online industry.\nCopyright Protection in Cyberspace\nCertainly, the DMCA brought about major transformations by establishing copyright protection\nguidelines for the digital arena. However, in 1996\u2014prior to the passage of the DMCA\u2014the World\nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) established two treaties designed to \u201cupdate and supplement\nthe major existing WIPO treaties on copyright and related rights, primarily in order to respond to\ndevelopments in technology and in the marketplace.\u201d [6] The first of these, the WIPO Copyright Treaty\n(WCT), was created to protect authors of literary and artistic works, including computer programs,\noriginal databases, and fine art. [7]The second, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT),\ndeals with \u201crelated rights,\u201d or rights connected to copyright. This law was created to protect the rights of\nperformers and producers of sound recordings. [8] These treaties both ensure basic rights, such as\ncompensation and acknowledgement for those who create works, and extend further protections. [9]\nSupported by the WIPO and the DMCA, new forms of communication now enjoy copyright protections.\nCopyright laws cover blogs and website content, provided that these sites contain original\nwriting. [10] Despite these developments, however, the Internet still poses challenges for copyrighted\nmaterial. Because the web changes so quickly, maintaining copyright protection with the Copyright Office\ncan be difficult. Presently, a work must be fixed and in a tangible form to be protected under copyright.\nDifferent, altered versions of the same work might not be covered under an original filed copyright claim.\nAs such, authors publishing online must be careful to ensure that their work is protected.\nThe RIAA versus Piracy\nWidespread piracy problems arose during the late 1990s with the popularization of technology allowing\npeer-to-peer (P2P) music sharing. Suddenly, software such as Napster, Scour, Aimster, AudioGalaxy,\nMorpheus, Grokster, Kazaa, iMesh, and LimeWire popped up on computers everywhere, allowing access\nto free music around the world\u2014and fueling online piracy. However, in 2003, the Recording Industry\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n697 Association of America (RIAA) put the laws established by the DMCA into practice and began a campaign\nto stop music piracy. In response to the growing number of users, the organization announced that it had\nbeen gathering evidence against users sharing music on P2P networks. Rather than go after the software\nengineers, \u201cthe RIAA investigators targeted \u2018uploaders\u2019\u2014individuals who were allowing others to copy\nmusic files from their \u2018shared\u2019 folders.\u201d [11]\nThis data collection led to the RIAA filing more than 250 lawsuits against individuals in what has been\ncalled \u201can unprecedented legal campaign against its own customers.\u201d [12] Among the first of these lawsuits\nwas one against a 12-year-old girl who had to pay $2,000 and publicly apologize to settle her case. Since\nthen, the recording industry has filed, settled, or threatened legal actions against over 28,000\nindividuals. [13] Many college students have been targeted. Recently, the popular torrent site The Pirate\nBay found itself under attack for allowing users to search for pirated copies of material. This case mirrors\nthe case of Viacom versus YouTube, because the prosecution argued that The Pirate Bay was responsible\nfor the material its users posted and downloaded. These lawsuits raise the question of whether websites\nare responsible for the actions of their users, an issue that looks to be central to future Internet\nlegislation. [14]\nThe Law and Online Interactions\nThe Internet is a relatively new form of media, but it is not exempt from media laws. Terms of service\nagreements, as well as legislation such as the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, regulate Internet use.\nAs you will see in the following case studies, when it comes to criminal use, the Internet is not as\nanonymous as it seems.\nTOS Agreements\nAll software and most Internet sites have a terms of service agreement to which its users must comply.\nTerms of service (TOS) are legally binding rules that an individual must adhere to in order to use a\nparticular piece of software or service. iTunes, for instance, makes users agree to use their downloadable\nmaterial for noncommercial use only and states that Apple is not responsible for lost or corrupted files.\nAnyone who has installed a new piece of software or logged on to social networking sites has agreed to a\nTOS. Entrance into these sites or use of a program typically requires a user to read through legal\nguidelines and then click a box agreeing to abide by the stated rules. You likely have done so numerous\ntimes.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n698 Deterred by the length and legal jargon of the standard TOS, however, many people skip to the end and\nsimply accept the terms without reading them carefully. iTunes, for instance, has a clause that states the\nfollowing:\nYou may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application [iTunes] except as\nauthorized by United States law \u2026 the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported\n\u2026 into any U.S.-embargoed countries \u2026 You also agree that you will not use these products for\nany purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development,\ndesign, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons. [15]\nWhile not all Terms of Service are as extensive, an individual\u2019s breach of any TOS may result in\nsuspension, restriction, or cancellation of account privileges, depending on the severity of the offense. As\nindividuals become increasingly reliant on Internet services such as email, calendars, and social networks,\nthe potential for disruption is enormous.\nThe Case of Megan Meier\nIn 2008, a compelling court case arose regarding TOS violation. Lori Drew, a 49-year-old woman, was\naccused of using a fake MySpace account to convince 13-year-old Megan Meier to commit suicide. How\ndid it come about? After Drew\u2019s daughter had a confrontation with Meier, Drew created an account\npretending to be a teenage boy. At first she used the persona to flirt with Meier and uncover information\nabout the teenager\u2019s social life and relationship to her daughter. Later, when Drew decided she had\nenough information, she broke off her friendship, telling Meier that the world would be better off without\nher. Later that day, a distraught Megan Meier hanged herself. [16] After Lori Drew\u2019s identity was revealed,\nMeier\u2019s shocked parents filed charges against her. Despite the tragic events, whether Drew had actually\ncommitted a crime remained questionable. Eventually, prosecutors decided the following:\nSince there were no laws that applied in Missouri, the state where this tragedy occurred, [Drew]\nwill face trial in California (the home of MySpace) where she will be charged with\u2014of all things\u2014\nTOS violations. Creating a false identity goes against MySpace\u2019s terms of service and \u2026 as a\nresult she will be facing 1 count of conspiracy and 3 counts of accessing a computer without\nauthorization. [17]\nThe case is complicated and the charge unprecedented. As one author writes, \u201cThis raises the questions as\nto how much weight do online \u2018contracts\u2019 hold.\u201d [18]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n699 Prosecutors charged Drew under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), although that law is\ndesigned primarily to reduce hacking into computer systems. In August 2009, a jury found Drew guilty of\n\u201cmisdemeanor counts of unauthorized access,\u201d but commented that \u201cthe CFAA was not devised as a\nvehicle for criminalizing simple contractual violations on the Internet.\u201d [19]Although many believe that\nprosecutors pushed the charge too far, the Drew case brought TOS agreements to the attention of the\npublic, shedding light on the complicated laws associated with Internet use.\nCrimes on the Internet\nAlthough cases such as Drew\u2019s have brought about unexpected challenges, other online cases have had\nless ambiguous results. One newly clarified aspect of online law involves the use of the Internet to commit\na crime. Regardless of the supposed anonymity of online use, law enforcement agencies and courts can\nrequisition Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of suspected lawbreakers and trace their computers to\ndiscover their identities. This practice has brought many individuals to trial for criminal offenses\ncommitted over the Internet.\nOnline Hate Crimes and Anonymity\nIn 1998, a federal court found a 21-year-old Los Angeles man, Richard Machado, guilty of sending racist\ndeath threats to 59 Asian students. This case set a precedent because Machado was the first person to be\nconvicted of an online hate crime for sending the message via email. Machado had used a campus\ncomputer to send an email to a group of mostly Asian students at University of California, Irvine, saying,\n\u201cI personally will make it my life career to find and kill every one of [you].\u201d Machado, a former UC Irvine\nstudent, signed the email \u201cAsian Hater.\u201d Prosecutors charged Machado with sending the threat based on\nthe recipients\u2019 race or ethnicity and interfering with their right to attend a public university. [20]\nThe case signaled a new legal development because it was the first trial regarding hate crimes online.\nProsecutor Michael Gennaco said of Machado\u2019s sentencing, \u201cThe jury has spoken that a line needs to be\ndrawn in cyberspace. If you cross that line, you\u2019ll be subjected to the same criminal penalties you would be\nas if you use a telephone or post mail to do these kinds of acts.\u201d [21] Internet law specialists agree with\nGennaco that the Internet is not and should not be treated differently from other communication\nmethods; something posted online carries the same weight as a phone conversation or face-to-face\ninteraction. This means that online anonymity is, in fact, not anonymous.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n700 Despite the precedent of Machado\u2019s case, many people still mistakenly believe that the Internet will\nprotect them from prosecution. Such was the case of Walter Edward Bagdasarian, who discovered that the\ngovernment can trace supposedly anonymous posts using IP addresses. U.S. Secret Service agents\narrested Bagdasarian, a Southern California man, in 2009 for \u201cposting a racist note to a Yahoo message\nboard in October [2008] expressing displeasure over Barack Obama\u2019s candidacy, and predicting \u2018he will\nhave a 50 cal in the head soon.\u2019\u201d [22] The case exemplifies both the ease with which authorities can and do\ntrace criminal behavior online and their propensity to take such cases seriously.\nWhat does the future hold for Internet legislation? Many say that it will closely mirror that of other media\noutlets. Already there have been cases regarding Internet monopolies, defamation of users, and copyright\ninfringement on message boards and personal websites. [23] Others argue that Internet regulation should\ntake into account the differences between the use of the Internet and the use of other media; for example,\nan Arizona radio station that violates broadcasting laws is tried in Arizona, but where should an Internet\npodcaster be charged? If a user posts information on a community forum, is it protected under copyright?\nDoes email spam fall under the same regulations as telemarketing? What privacy rights should Internet\nusers have? As the Internet grows and more issues are taken to court, authorities must come to terms with\nmedia issues in a constantly changing digital landscape.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The DMCA and the WIPO provide basic legal guidelines for copyright and intellectual property protections\nonline. Nevertheless, regulating and enforcing such statutes remains a complicated, difficult process due\nto the rapid change and shared authorship inherent to online content.\n\uf0b7 In 2003, the RIAA began a campaign against illegal peer-to-peer sharing of music. Its actions resulted in\nhundreds of lawsuits and greater awareness of issues pertaining to digital copyrights.\n\uf0b7 Law enforcement agencies and courts can requisition IP addresses and trace computers to discover the\nidentity of online users suspected of committing crimes.

Explain how the Internet has changed citizens\u2019 role in the political process.\n2. Determine the differences between traditional campaigning and digital campaigning.\nIn an era when work, discourse, and play are increasingly experienced via the Internet, it is fitting\nthat politics have surged online as well in a recent phenomenon known as digital\ndemocracy. Digital democracy\u2014also known as e-democracy\u2014engages citizens in government and\ncivic action through online tools. This new form of democracy began as an effort to include larger\nnumbers of citizens in the democratic process. Recent evidence seems to confirm a rising popular\nbelief that the Internet is the most effective modern way to engage individuals in politics. \u201cOnline\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n703 political organizations\u2026have attracted millions of members, raised tens of millions of dollars, and\nbecome a key force in electoral politics. Even more important, the 2004 and 2008 election cycles\nshow that candidates themselves can use the Internet to great effect.\u201d [1]\nPresident Obama\u2019s Digital Campaign\nFigure 15.6\nPresident Barack Obama has been called \u201cthe digital candidate\u201d for his use of digital technology\nduring his 2008 presidential campaign.\nPerhaps the best example of a political candidate putting digital democracy to use is the successful 2008\npresidential campaign of Barack Obama. On June 8, 2008, following Obama\u2019s victory in the Democratic\npresidential primaries, The New York Times published an article discussing the candidate\u2019s use of the\nInternet in his nomination bid. Titled \u201cThe Wiki-Way to the Nomination,\u201d the article credits Obama\u2019s\nsuccess to his employment of digital technology: \u201cBarack Obama is the victor, and the Internet is taking\nthe bows.\u201d [2]\nObama\u2019s campaign certainly is not the first to rely on the Internet. Another Democratic presidential\nhopeful, Howard Dean, famously built his campaign online during the 2004 election cycle. But the Obama\ncampaign took full advantage of the possibilities of digital democracy and, ultimately, secured the Oval\nOffice partially on the strength of that strategy. As one writer puts it, \u201cWhat is interesting about the story\nof his digital campaign is the way in which digital was integrated fully into the Obama campaign, rather\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n704 than [being] seen as an additional extra.\u201d [3] President Obama\u2019s successful campaign serves as an excellent\nexample of the possibilities of digital democracy.\nTraditional Websites\nSeveral existing political websites proved beneficial to the Obama campaign. Founded in 1998, the liberal\nwebsite MoveOn.org has long used its popularity and supporter base to mobilize citizens to vote, lobby, or\ndonate funds to Democratic campaigns. With more than 4 million members, MoveOn.org plays a\nnoticeable role in U.S. politics and serves as inspiration for other like-minded digital efforts.\nThe Obama campaign gave a nod to the success of such sites by building a significant web presence.\nWebsites such as MyBarackObama.com formed the foundation of these online efforts. However, the\nsuccess of the Obama digital campaign came from its use of online media in all its forms. The campaign\nturned not only to traditional websites but also to social networking sites, email outreach, text messages,\nand viral videos.\nSocial Networking\nMore and more, digital democracy demands that its users rely on these alternative forms of Internet\noutreach. Social networking site Facebook was the hub of many digital outreach efforts during the 2008\ncampaign. As of 2010, Barack Obama\u2019s official Facebook page boasts more than 9 million fans, and the\nObama administration uses the page to send messages about the current political climate.\nIndividuals not part of the official campaign also established Facebook pages supporting the candidate.\nMamas for Obama emerged just prior to the election, as did Women for Obama and the Michelle Obama\nFan Club. The groups range in size, but all speak to a new wave of digital democracy. Other political\ncandidates, including 2008 Republican presidential contender John McCain, have also turned to\nFacebook, albeit in less comprehensive ways.\nEmail Outreach\nThe Obama campaign also relied on email. In 2009, an article was published titled \u201cThe Story Behind\nObama\u2019s Digital Campaign\u201d discussing the success of Obama\u2019s use of the Internet. According to the\narticle, 13.5 million people signed up for updates on Obama\u2019s progress via\nthe MyBarackObama.com website. The campaign regularly sent out emails to reach its audience.\nEmails were short\u2014never longer than 300 words\u2014and never anonymous, there was always a\nconsistency of voice and tone. Obama and other key figures in the campaign also contributed\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n705 emails to be sent\u2014\u201cMichelle wrote her own emails \u2026 and more people opened those than her\nhusband\u2019s\u201d\u2014giving the campaign a personal touch and authenticity, rather than the impression\nof being simply churned out by the PR machine. [4]\nA combination of message and financial appeal, the emails were successful not only in reaching target\naudiences but also in earning valuable campaign dollars.\nTwo billion emails were then sent out, although \u2026 this email content was carefully managed,\nwith individuals targeted with different \u201ctracks\u201d depending on their circumstances and whether\nthey had already donated to the campaign\u2026. By the end of the campaign the website had\nmobilized over 3 million people to contribute over $500 million online.[5]\nText Messaging\nAdditionally, Obama used text messaging to reach out to his supporters. During the campaign, supporters\ncould sign up to receive text messages, and attendees at rallies and other events were asked to send text\nmessages to friends or potential supporters to encourage them to participate in Obama\u2019s campaign.\nMembers of MyBarackObama.com were the first to discover his running mate selection via text\nmessage. [6] This tool proved helpful and demonstrated the Obama campaign\u2019s commitment to fully\nrelying on the digital world.\nE-Democracy\nPerhaps even more impressive than the campaign\u2019s commitment to digital democracy were the e-\ndemocracy efforts of Obama\u2019s supporters. Websites such as Barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com, a gently\nmocking site \u201clisting the many examples of Mr. Obama\u2019s magical compassion. (\u2018Barack Obama carries a\npicture of you in his wallet\u2019; \u2018Barack Obama thought you could use some chocolate\u2019),\u201d [7]emerged, but viral\nvideos offered even stronger examples of Obama\u2019s grassroots campaign.\nOne example of a supporter-created video was \u201cBarack Paper Scissors,\u201d an interactive game inspired by\nrock-paper-scissors. Posted on YouTube, the video logged some 600,000 views. The success of videos\nsuch as \u201cBarack Paper Scissors\u201d did not go unnoticed by the Obama campaign. The viral video \u201cYes We\nCan,\u201d in which Barack Obama\u2019s words were set to music by will.i.am (of the Black Eyed Peas), has been\nviewed more than 20 million times online. Capitalizing on the popularity of the clip, the campaign\nbrought it from YouTube to its main website, thus generating even more views and greater exposure for\nits message.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n706 Political Rumors Online\nAlthough the Internet is a powerful tool for candidates, it also propagates rumors that can derail\u2014or at\nleast hinder\u2014a politician\u2019s career. Blog posts and mass emails can be created within minutes and then\nreposted or forwarded in seconds. Thus, ideas spread like wildfire regardless of their relative\ntruth. Snopes.com, a website dedicated to verifying or debunking urban legends and Internet rumors, has\nan entire search section dedicated to political rumors, ranging from shooting down a list of books\nsupposedly banned by Sarah Palin to investigating whether actress Nancy Cartwright, best known as the\nvoice of Bart Simpson, was once elected mayor of Northridge, California. The pages dedicated to major\npolitical figures such as President Obama can be huge; Obama\u2019s page, for example, lists more than 60\ndebunked rumors. Some of these rumors include the questioning of his U.S. citizenship, his decision to\nban recreational fishing, and his refusal to sign Eagle Scout certificates.\nMany of these online rumors are accompanied by \u201cphotographic evidence,\u201d thanks to technology such as\nPhotoshop, which allows photographs to be manipulated with the click of a mouse. With such a spread of\nonline rumors, savvy media consumers must be wary of what they read and seek out legitimate sources of\ninformation to verify the news that they receive.\nDigital Democracy and the Digital Divide\nJust as digital technology access issues can create the kinds of problems discussed in Chapter 13\n\"Economics of Mass Media\", the digital divide can equally split the country\u2019s involvement with politics\nalong tech-savvy lines. Certainly, the Obama campaign\u2019s reliance on modern technology allowed it to\nreach a large population of young voters; but in doing so, the campaign focused much of its attention in an\narea out of reach to other voters. In The Myth of Digital Democracy, author Matthew Hindman wonders,\n\u201cIs the Internet making politics less exclusive?\u201d [8] The answer is likely both yes and no. While the Internet\ncertainly has the power to inform and mobilize many individuals, it also denies poorer citizens without\ndigital access an opportunity to be part of the new wave of e-democracy.\nNevertheless, digital democracy will continue to play a large role in politics, particularly after the\noverwhelming success of President Obama\u2019s largely digital campaign. But politicians and their supporters\nmust consider the digital divide and work to reach out to those who are not plugged in to the digital world.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n707 \uf0b7 The Internet has dramatically changed citizens\u2019 involvement in the political process by giving them greater\naccess to issues and candidates.\n\uf0b7 Candidates can now communicate with individuals via websites, email, text messages, and viral videos,\noffering citizens a more personal experience with the election process.\n\uf0b7 Savvy consumers question the truth of unverified online information such as that contained in emails or\nblog posts.\nEXERCISES\nVisit YouTube and search for a local or national candidate with whom you are familiar.

Describe how radio transformed the political process.\n2. Discuss the impact of the televised debates on presidential campaigns.\nFigure 15.8\nIn 2007, The Washington Post published a critical expos\u00e9 on the Walter Reed Army Medical\nCenter. In response to the public outcry, the U.S. Army launched an investigation and set\nabout improving the facility. As demonstrated in this case, media coverage can directly\ninfluence people\u2019s lives.\nMedia have long had a voice and a role in politics. As you have read in earlier chapters, even some of\nthe earliest newspapers and magazines used their pages as a forum for political discourse. When\nbroadcast media emerged during the 20th century, radio briefs and television reports entered the\nconversation, bringing political stories to the public\u2019s living rooms.\nIn addition to acting as a watchdog, media provide readers and viewers with news coverage of issues\nand events, and also offer public forums for debate. Thus, media support\u2014or lack thereof\u2014can have\na significant influence on public opinion and governmental action. In 2007, for example, The\nWashington Post conducted a four-month investigation of the substandard medical treatment of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n709 wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC. Because of the ensuing\ntwo-part feature, the Secretary of the Army and the two-star general in charge of the medical facility\nlost their jobs.\nHowever, an ongoing debate exists over media\u2019s role in politics. Many individuals wonder who is\nreally behind certain stories. William James Willis, author of The Media Effect: How the News\nInfluences Politics and Government discusses this debate:\nSometimes the media appear willing or unwitting participants in chasing stories the government\nwants them to chase; other times politicians find themselves chasing issues that the media has\nenlarged by its coverage. Over the decades, political scientists, journalists, politicians, and\npolitical pundits have put forth many arguments about the media\u2019s power in influencing the\ngovernment and politicians. [1]\nRegardless of who is encouraging whom, media coverage of politics certainly raises questions among\nthe public. Despite laws put in place to prevent unbalanced political coverage, such as Section 315, a\nlarge majority of the public is still wary of the media\u2019s role in swaying political opinion. In a January\n2010 survey, two-thirds of respondents said that the media has too much influence on the\ngovernment. Additionally, 72 percent of respondents agreed that \u201cmost reporters try to help the\ncandidate they want to win.\u201d [2] This statistic demonstrates the media\u2019s perceived political power\nalong with the road the media must carefully navigate when dealing with political issues.\nPolitics, Broadcast Media, and the Internet\nThroughout their respective histories, radio, television, and the Internet have played important roles in\npolitics. As technology developed, citizens began demanding greater levels of information and analysis of\nmedia outlets and, in turn, politicians. Here we explore the transformation of politics with the\ndevelopment of media.\nRadio\nAs discussed in Chapter 7 \"Radio\", radio was the first medium through which up-to-the-minute breaking\nnews could be broadcast, with its popularization during the 1920s. On November 2, 1920, KDKA in East\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, became the first station to broadcast election results from the Harding-Cox\npresidential race, \u201cbecoming a pioneer in a brand new technology.\u201d [3]Suddenly, information that would\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n710 previously have been available only later in the newspapers was transmitted directly into American living\nrooms. The public responded positively, wanting to be more involved in U.S. politics.\nAs radio technology developed, \u201cAmericans demanded participation in the political and cultural debates\nshaping their democratic republic.\u201d [4] Radio provided a way to hold these debates in a public forum; it\nalso provided a venue for politicians to speak directly to the public, a phenomenon that had not been\npossible on a large scale prior to the invention of the radio. This dynamic changed politics. Suddenly,\ncandidates and elected officials had to be able to effectively communicate their messages to a large\naudience. \u201cRadio brought politicians into people\u2019s homes, and many politicians went to learn effective\npublic-speaking for radio broadcasts.\u201d [5]\nTelevision\nToday, television remains Americans\u2019 chief source of political news, a relationship that dates back almost\nto the very beginning of the medium. Political candidates began using television commercials to speak\ndirectly to the public as early as 1952. These \u201cliving room candidates,\u201d as they are often called, understood\nthe power of the television screen and the importance of reaching viewers at home. In 1952, Dwight D.\nEisenhower became the first candidate to harness television\u2019s popularity. Eisenhower stepped onto the\ntelevision screen \u201cwhen Madison Avenue advertising executive Rosser Reeves convinced [him] that short\nads played during such popular television programs as I Love Lucy would reach more voters than any\nother form of advertising. This innovation had a permanent effect on the way presidential campaigns are\nrun.\u201d [6]\nNixon\u2013Kennedy Debates of 1960\nThe relationship between politics and television took a massive step forward in 1960 with a series of four\ntelevised \u201cGreat Debates\u201d between presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Seventy\nmillion U.S. viewers tuned into the first of these on September 26, 1960. The debates gave voters their\nfirst chance to see candidates debate, marking television\u2019s entry into politics.\nAs discussed earlier in the book, the visual difference between the two candidates was staggering;\nKennedy appeared much more presidential. A record number of viewers watched the debates, and many\nhistorians have attributed Kennedy\u2019s success at the polls that November to the public perception of the\ncandidates formed during these debates. [7]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n711 War and Television\nLater in the decade, rising U.S. involvement in Vietnam brought television and public affairs together\nagain in a significant way. The horrors of battle were broadcast directly into U.S. homes on a large scale\nfor the first time; although television had been invented prior to the Korean War, \u201cthe medium was in its\ninfancy\u2026[and] its audience and technology [were] still too limited to play a major role.\u201d [8] As such, in\n1965 the Vietnam War became the first \u201cliving-room war.\u201d\nEarly in the war, the coverage was mostly upbeat:\nIt typically began with a battlefield roundup, written from wire reports based on the daily press\nbriefing in Saigon \u2026 read by the anchor and illustrated with a battle map\u2026. The battlefield\nroundup would normally be followed by a policy story from Washington, and then a film report\nfrom the field\u2026. As with most television news, the emphasis was on the visual and above all the\npersonal: \u201cAmerican boys in action\u201d was the story, and reports emphasized their bravery and\ntheir skill in handling the technology of war. [9]\nIn 1969, however, television coverage began to change as journalists grew more and more skeptical of the\ngovernment\u2019s claims of progress, and there was more emphasis on the human costs of war. [10] Although\ngore typically remained off screen, a few major violent moments were caught on film and broadcast into\nhomes. In 1965, CBS aired footage of U.S. Marines setting village huts on fire, and in 1972, NBC audiences\nwitnessed Vietnamese civilians fall victim to a napalm strike. Such scenes altered America\u2019s perspective of\nthe war, generating antiwar sentiment. Over twenty years later, in 1991, the Persian Gulf War was brought\ninto homes across the country, as live video feed showed the impact of scud missiles striking their targets.\nThe media, in that conflict, were accused of shaping public sentiments toward acceptance of the U.S.\nmilitary involvement.\nPolitical News Programming\nThe way that news is televised has dramatically changed over the medium\u2019s history. For years, nightly\nnews broadcasts dominated the political news cycle; then, in the 1980s, round-the-clock cable news\nchannels appeared. Founded by Ted Turner in 1980, CNN (Cable News Network) was the first such\nnetwork. Upon the launch of CNN, Turner stated, \u201cWe won\u2019t be signing off until the world ends. We\u2019ll be\non, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event\u2026and when the end of the\nworld comes, we\u2019ll play \u2018Nearer, My God, to Thee\u2019 before we sign off.\u201d [11]\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n712 Twenty-four-hour news stations such as CNN have become more popular, and nightly news programs\nhave been forced to change their focus, now emphasizing more local stories that may not be covered by\nthe major news programs. Additionally, the 21st century has seen the rise of the popularity and influence\nof satirical news shows such as The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. The comedic news programs\nhave, in recent years, become major cultural arbiters and watchdogs of political issues thanks to the\noutspoken nature of their hosts and their frank coverage of political issues.\nOnline News and Politics\nFinally, the Internet has become an increasingly important force in how Americans receive political\ninformation. Websites such as the Huffington Post, Daily Beast, and the Drudge Report are known for\nbreaking news stories and political commentary. Additionally, political groups regularly use the Internet\nto organize supporters and influence political issues.

Tech-savvy consumers certainly seem to think\nso\u2014on the day Apple\u2019s much-hyped iPad hit the market in April 2010, the company sold more than\n300,000 devices. Described as \u201cGoldilocks\u201d gadgets\u2014not too big, not too small\u2014tablet computers are\ncreating what former Apple CEO Steve Jobs calls a \u201cthird segment\u201d of computing between handheld\nphones and laptop computers. [1] The iPad, which sports a 9.7-inch color LED touch screen, enables\nconsumers to surf the web, play games, email, and use many of the same applications available on the\ncompany\u2019s vastly popular smartphone, the iPhone. Its primary function upon release however, was to\ncorner the e-book market, putting it in competition with Amazon.com\u2019s black-and-white Kindle e-reader.\nSigning deals with five major publishers\u2014HarperCollins, Penguin, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan, and\nHachette\u2014Apple created a program called iBooks that enables customers to download e-books directly\nonto the iPad via the digital media application iTunes. The print media industry\u2014which was unable to\ncapitalize on the benefits of new media during the Internet age of free print and video content on the web,\nand saw its profits disintegrate as a result\u2014is hopeful that tablet computers such as the iPad will provide\nsome form of digital salvation. John Makinson, chairman of the Penguin Group, said the iPad would help\n\u201cattract millions of new readers to the world\u2019s best books.\u201d [2] More importantly for the future of\ntraditional media, the iPad may provide a way for publishers to generate a profit from these new readers.\nElectronic publishers who sell their products through iBooks receive a 70 percent share of any revenues,\nand are able to set their prices higher than Amazon\u2019s, a relief for publishers worried that e-books might\nundercut their sales.\nThe success of Apple\u2019s iPhone, which is expected to generate an estimated $1.4 billion in 2010 from its\nApp Store alone, may provide some indication of how well the iPad is likely to perform in the near future.\nTrip Hawkins, a founder of interactive entertainment software company Electronic Arts, commented,\n\u201cThe iPhone was a harbinger. When you have a device that is this convenient and fun for consumers to\nuse, you can get a lot more people interested in paying for and engaging with the content. Big media\ncompanies should be all over this like a cheap suit.\u201d [3] And they are. Several major newspapers and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n717 magazine companies have signed up with Apple\u2019s latest device, and their content is available via iPad\napplications. Some, such as The New York Times and USA Today, are initially offering their apps for free\nwith a paid app coming down the line, while others, such as The Wall Street Journal and Time, are\navailable for a download fee. Thomas J. Wallace, editorial director of Cond\u00e9 Nast, said, \u201c2010 is going to\nbe the year of the tablet, and we feel we are in a very good position for it.\u201d [4] The publishing company\nlaunched its first app for GQ, a men\u2019s magazine, at a cost of $2.99 in April 2010. To avoid losing paying\ncustomers, media companies are adjusting part of their digital strategy so that consumers are no longer\nable to access the same content for free on the web.\nDespite initial concerns that the iPad might prove to be an unnecessary gadget, performing functions that\ncan be performed on other devices, its sales have so far surpassed all expectations. As of 2010, the original\niPad sales had topped more than 15,000,000 units in the first 9 months, outpacing sales of Mac laptops.\nThe cheaper price and variety of functions made it a hit with consumers. With magazine and newspaper\npublishers able to provide a more interactive experience on the iPad through video, graphics, and creative\ndesign layouts, analysts are predicting the iPad will revolutionize the publishing industry the way the iPod\nand the iPhone shook up the digital music and smartphone industries, respectively. Whether the iPad will\nremain at the forefront of the digital revolution in the years to come remains to be seen, but it has the\npotential to eventually become an all-in-one television, newspaper, and bookshelf.\n[1] Bobbie Johnson and Charles Arthur, \u201cApple iPad: The Wait Is Over\u2014But Is It the Future of Technology or\nOversized Phone?\u201d Guardian (London), January 27, 2010,\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/27/apple-ipad-tablet-computer-kindle.\n[2] Bobbie Johnson and Charles Arthur, \u201cApple iPad: The Wait Is Over\u2014But Is It the Future of Technology or\nOversized Phone?\u201d Guardian (London), January 27, 2010,\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jan/27/apple-ipad-tablet-computer-kindle.\n[3] Brad Stone and Stephanie Clifford, \u201cWith Apple Tablet, Print Media Hope for a Payday,\u201d New York Times,\nJanuary 25, 2010, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/technology/26apple.html.\n[4] Brad Stone and Stephanie Clifford, \u201cWith Apple Tablet, Print Media Hope for a Payday,\u201d New York Times,\nJanuary 25, 2010, http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/technology/26apple.html.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n718 16.1\nChanges in Media Over the Last Century\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Describe the types of new media.\n2. Identify how the Internet has affected media delivery.\n3. Explain why new media are often more successful than traditional forms of media.\nLife has changed dramatically over the past century, and a major reason for this is the progression of\nmedia technology. Compare a day in the life of a modern student\u2014let\u2019s call her Katie\u2014with a day in\nthe life of someone from Katie\u2019s great-grandparents\u2019 generation. When Katie wakes up, she\nimmediately checks her smartphone for text messages and finds out that her friend will not be able\nto give her a ride to class. Katie flips on the television while she eats breakfast to check the news and\nlearns it is supposed to rain that day. Before she leaves her apartment, Katie goes online to make\nsure she remembered the train times correctly. She grabs an umbrella and heads to the train station,\nlistening to a music application on her smartphone on the way. After a busy day of classes, Katie\nheads home, occupying herself on the train ride by watching YouTube clips on her phone. That\nevening, she finishes her homework, emails the file to her instructor, and settles down to watch the\ntelevision show she digitally recorded the night before. While watching the show, Katie logs on to\nFacebook and chats with a few of her friends online to make plans for the weekend and then reads a\nbook on her e-reader.\nKatie\u2019s life today is vastly different from the life she would have led just a few generations ago. At the\nbeginning of the 20th century, neither television nor the Internet existed. There were no commercial\nradio stations, no roadside billboards, no feature films, and certainly no smartphones. People were\ndependent on newspapers and magazines for their knowledge of the outside world. An early-20th-\ncentury woman the same age as Katie\u2014let\u2019s call her Elizabeth\u2014wakes up to read the daily paper.\nYellow journalism is rife, and the papers are full of lurid stories and sensational headlines about\ngovernment corruption and the unfair treatment of factory workers. Full-color printing became\navailable in the 1890s, and Elizabeth enjoys reading the Sunday comics. She also subscribes to Good\nHousekeeping magazine. Occasionally, Elizabeth and her husband enjoy visiting the local\nnickelodeon theater, where they watch short silent films accompanied by accordion music. They\ncannot afford to purchase a phonograph, but Elizabeth and her family often gather around a piano in\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n719 the evening to sing songs to popular sheet music. Before she goes to sleep, Elizabeth reads a few\npages of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Separated by nearly a century of technology,\nElizabeth\u2019s and Katie\u2019s lives are vastly different.\nNew Media\nTraditional media encompasses all the means of communication that existed before the Internet and new\nmedia technology, including printed materials (books, magazines, and newspapers), broadcast\ncommunications (television and radio), film, and music. New media, on the other hand, includes\nelectronic video games and entertainment, and the Internet and social media. Although different forms of\nmass media rise and fall in popularity, it is worth noting that despite significant cultural and technological\nchanges, none of the media discussed throughout this text has fallen out of use completely.\nElectronic Games and Entertainment\nFirst popularized in the 1970s with Atari\u2019s simple table-tennis simulator Pong, video games have come a\nlong way over the past four decades. Early home game consoles could play only one game, a limitation\nsolved by the development of interchangeable game cartridges. The rise of the personal computer in the\n1980s enabled developers to create games with more complex story lines and to allow players to interact\nwith each other via the computer. In the mid-1980s, online role-playing games developed, allowing\nmultiple users to play at the same time. A dramatic increase in Internet use helped to popularize online\ngames during the 1990s and 2000s, both on personal computers and via Internet-enabled home console\nsystems such as the Microsoft Xbox and the Sony PlayStation. The Internet has added a social aspect to\nvideo gaming that has bridged the generation gap and opened up a whole new audience for video game\ncompanies. Senior citizens commonly gather in retirement communities to play Nintendo\u2019s Wii bowling\nand tennis games using a motion-sensitive controller, while young professionals and college students get\ntogether to play in virtual bands on games such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band. No longer associated with\nan isolated subculture, contemporary video games are bringing friends and families together via\nincreasingly advanced gaming technology.\nThe Internet and Social Media\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the influence the Internet has had on media over the past two decades.\nInitially conceived as an attack-proof military network in the 1960s, the Internet has since become an\nintegral part of daily life. With the development of the World Wide Web in the 1980s and the introduction\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n720 of commercial browsers in the 1990s, users gained the ability to transmit pictures, sound, and video over\nthe Internet. Companies quickly began to capitalize on the new technology, launching web browsers,\noffering free web-based email accounts, and providing web directories and search engines. Internet usage\ngrew rapidly, from 50 percent of American adults in 2000 to 75 percent of American adults in\n2008. [1] Now that most of the industrialized world is online, the way we receive our news, do business,\nconduct research, contact friends and relatives, apply for jobs, and even watch television has changed\ncompletely. To provide just one example, many jobs can now be performed entirely from home without\nthe need to travel to a central office. Meetings can be conducted via videoconference, written\ncommunication can take place via email, and employees can access company data via a server or file\ntransfer protocol (FTP) site. You very likely have had the opportunity to take an online college class.\nIn addition to increasing the speed with which we can access information and the volume of information\nat our fingertips, the Internet has added a whole new democratic dimension to communication. Becoming\nthe author of a printed book may take many years of frustrated effort, but becoming a publisher of online\nmaterial requires little more than the click of a button. Thanks to social media such as blogs, social\nnetworking sites, wikis, and video-sharing websites, anyone can contribute ideas on the web. Social media\nhas many advantages, including the instantaneous distribution of news, a variety of different perspectives\non a single event, and the ability to communicate with people all over the globe. Although some industry\nanalysts have long predicted that the Internet will render print media obsolete, mass-media executives\nbelieve newspapers will evolve with the times. Just as the radio industry had to rethink its commercial\nstrategy during the rise of television, newspaper professionals will need to rethink their methods of\ncontent delivery during the age of the Internet.\nNew Media versus Traditional Media\nNew technologies have developed so quickly that executives in traditional media companies often cannot\nretain control over their content. For example, as we saw, when music-sharing website Napster began\nenabling users to exchange free music files over the Internet, peer-to-peer file sharing cost the music\nindustry a fortune in lost CD sales. Rather than capitalize on the new technology, music industry\nexecutives sued Napster, ultimately shutting it down, but never quite managing to stamp out online music\npiracy. Even with legal digital music sales through online vendors such as Apple\u2019s iTunes Store, the music\nindustry is still trying to determine how to make a large enough profit to stay in business.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n721 The publishing industry has also suffered from the effects of new technology (although newspaper\nreadership has been in decline since the introduction of television and radio). When newspapers began\ndeveloping online versions in response to competition from cable television, they found themselves up\nagainst a new form of journalism: amateur blogging. Initially dismissed as unreliable and biased, blogs\nsuch as Daily Kos and The Huffington Post have gained credibility and large readerships over the past\ndecade, forcing traditional journalists to blog and tweet in order to keep pace (which allows less time to\ncheck that sources are reliable or add in-depth analysis to a story). Traditional newspapers are also losing\nout to news aggregators such as Google News, which profit from providing links to journalists\u2019 stories at\nmajor newspapers without offering financial compensation to either the journalists or the news\norganizations. Many newspapers have adapted to the Internet out of necessity, fighting falling circulation\nfigures and slumping advertising sales by offering websites, blogs, and podcasts and producing news\nstories in video form. Those that had the foresight to adapt to the new technology are breathing a sigh of\nrelief; a 2010 Pew Research Center report found that more Americans receive their news via the Internet\nthan from newspapers or radio sources, and that the Internet is the third most popular news source\nbehind national and local television news (see Section 6.3 \"Current Popular Trends in the Music\nIndustry\"). [2]\nPay-for-Content: Will It Work?\nCritics of the pay-for-content model point to the failure of Newsday, a Long Island, New York, daily that\nwas one of the first non-business publications to use the pay-for-content model. In October\n2009, Newsday began charging readers $5 a week ($260 a year) for unlimited access to its online\ncontent. Three months later, an analysis of the move indicated that it had been a total failure. Just 35\npeople had signed up to pay for access to the site. Having spent $4 million redesigning and relaunching\nthe Newsday website in preparation for the new model, the owners grossed just $9,000 from their initial\nreadership.\nHowever, the lack of paying consumers may be partly accounted for by the number of exceptions granted\nby the company. Subscribers to the print version of the paper can access the site for free, as can those with\nOptimum Cable. According to Newsday representatives, 75 percent of Long Island residents have either a\nnewspaper subscription or Optimum Cable. \u201cGiven the number of households in our market that have\naccess to Newsday\u2019s website as a result of other subscriptions, it is no surprise that a relatively modest\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n722 number have chosen the pay option,\u201d said a Cablevision spokeswoman. [3] Even though most Long Island\nresidents have access to the site, traffic has dropped considerably. A Nielsen Online survey revealed that\ntraffic fell from 2.2 million visits in October 2009 to 1.5 million visits in December 2009. Publishing\nexecutives will be watching closely to see whether The New York Times meets a similar fate with its pay-\nfor-content model.\nNew media have three major advantages over traditional media. First, it is immediate, enabling\nconsumers to find out the latest news, weather report, or stock prices at the touch of a button. Digital\nmusic can be downloaded instantly, movies can be ordered via cable or satellite on-demand services, and\nbooks can be read on e-readers. In an increasingly fast-paced world, there is little need to wait for\nanything. The second advantage is cost. Most online content is free, from blogs and social networking\nsites to news and entertainment sources. Whether readers are willing to pay for content once they are\nused to receiving it for free is something that the The New York Times set to find out in 2011, when it\nintroduces a metered fee model for its online paper. Finally, new media is able to reach the most remote\nparts of the globe. For example, if a student is looking for information about day-to-day life in Iran, there\nis a high probability that a personal web page about living in that country exists somewhere on the\nInternet. Around three-fourths of Americans, half of Europeans, and just over one-fourth of the world\u2019s\npopulation overall have Internet access. [4] This widespread reach makes the Internet an ideal target for\nadvertisers, who can communicate with their desired niche audiences via tracking devices such as profile\ninformation on social networking sites.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Traditional media include printed materials (books, magazines, and newspapers), broadcast\ncommunications (television and radio), film, and music. New media include all forms of communication in\nthe digital world, including electronic video games, the Internet, and social media. The Internet has added\na social aspect to video gaming that has bridged the generation gap and opened up a whole new audience\nfor video game companies, including senior citizens and families. The prevalence of the Internet in\nmodern daily life affects us in nearly every way, from how we receive our news, to the way we do\nbusiness, conduct research, contact friends and relatives, apply for jobs, and even how we watch\ntelevision.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n723 \uf0b7 New media frequently trump traditional media for three main reasons: They are more immediate, are\noften free, and can reach a wider number of people.\nEXERCISES\nReview the traditional and emerging forms of media. Then answer the following short-answer questions.\nEach response should be a minimum of one paragraph.\n1. Think of three examples of traditional or new media. What are the advantages of each type of\nmedium? What are the disadvantages?\n2. Which of these types of media has been around the longest? Which is the most modern?\n3. How has the Internet affected the delivery of other types of media?\n4. Do you believe that new media are more successful than traditional forms? Why or why not?\n[1] Pew Research Center, Internet User Profiles Reloaded, January 5, 2010,\nhttp://pewresearch.org/pubs/1454/demographic-profiles-internet-broadband-cell-phone-wireless-users.\n[2] Pew Research Center, \u201cThe New News Landscape: Rise of the Internet,\u201d March 1, 2010,\nhttp://pewresearch.org/pubs/1508/internet-cell-phone-users-news-social-experience?src=prc-\nlatest&proj=peoplepress.\n[3] John Koblin, \u201cAfter 3 Months, Only 35 Subscriptions for Newsday\u2019s Web Site,\u201d New York Observer, January 26,\n2010, http://www.observer.com/2010/media/after-three-months-only-35-subscriptions-newsdays-web-site.\n[4] Internet World Stats, \u201cInternet Usage Statistics,\u201d http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm.\n16.2\nInformation Delivery Methods\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n1. Explain why the Internet has become a primary source of news and information.\nAs we saw in Chapter 14 \"Ethics of Mass Media\", when superstar Michael Jackson died of a cardiac\narrest in June 2009, the news sent media outlets all over the world into a frenzy, providing\njournalists, bloggers, authors, and television news anchors with months of material. The pop singer\u2019s\ndeath is a good example of how information is disseminated through the various media channels.\nUnafraid to publish unconfirmed rumors that may have to be retracted later, blogs and gossip\nwebsites are often first to produce celebrity news stories. Digital sources also have the advantage of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n724 immediacy\u2014rather than waiting for a physical newspaper to be printed and delivered, a time-\nconsuming process that occurs just once a day, bloggers and online reporters can publish a story on\nthe Internet in the time it takes to type it out. Within 40 minutes after the Los Angeles Fire\nDepartment arrived at Jackson\u2019s home, a small entertainment website called X17online posted the\nnews that Jackson had suffered cardiac arrest. Twenty minutes later, larger entertainment site TMZ\npicked up the information and distributed it to hundreds of thousands of people via RSS\u2014a web\npublishing technology that enables users to automatically receive new digital content from the\nprovider. Multiple Wikipedia members updated Jackson\u2019s biographical entry to include the news of\nhis cardiac arrest before any major news networks or broadcasters had announced the news. By the\ntime the cardiac arrest was reported on CNN\u2019s official Twitter account two hours after the 911 call,\nTwitter users and TMZ reporters were already posting reports of the star\u2019s death. The story created\nsuch a surge in online traffic that microblogging site Twitter temporarily shut down and Google\nreturned an error message for searches of the singer\u2019s name because it assumed it was under attack.\nAn hour after the news of Jackson\u2019s death hit the Internet, mainstream news sources such as The Los\nAngeles Times, MSNBC, and CNN confirmed the information, and it was immediately disseminated\namong local and national television and radio stations.\nThe order in which the news broke among the major media outlets was a source of contention. Many\noutlets around the world were reluctant to rely on the TMZ report, because the website was primarily\nknown for its frivolous content, aggressive paparazzi tactics, and embarrassing celebrity\nphotographs. Many of the more reputable news sources, including CNN, waited until both the\ncoroner\u2019s office and The Los Angeles Times had confirmed Jackson\u2019s death before announcing it as a\nfact to viewers, preferring to release an accurate story rather than to gain an edge over other news\noutlets (even though both TMZ and CNN are owned by Time Warner). \u201cGiven the nature of the story\nwe exercised caution,\u201d said CNN spokesman Nigel Pritchard. [1] However, Harvey Levin, managing\neditor of TMZ, denied that his site was less credible than any other news source. \u201cTMZ is a news\noperation and we are fact based,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is always to take stories and factually source\nthem and present them. We\u2019re not a gossip site\u2026. We have things researched, we have things\nlawyered, we make lots of phone calls\u2026. I mean it\u2019s the same principle.\u201d [2] Despite Levin\u2019s protests, it\nappears that, for now at least, old media stalwarts such as the Associated Press and The LA\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n725 Times have the advantage of reliability over (sometimes) faster sources with less credibility. As Adam\nFendelman, founder of entertainment news site HollywoodChicago.com, noted, \u201cThe Web and TV\nphenomenon that TMZ is is very good at fast-breaking and late-breaking news, but there\u2019s an\ninherent problem with trust in the everyday consumer\u2019s mind\u201d [3] (see Section 6.4 \"Influence of New\nTechnology\" for more advantages and disadvantages of new media).\nOnce news of Michael Jackson\u2019s death had been reported through all the major international media\noutlets, a tabloid war broke out, with newspapers and magazines determined to get the \u201cstory behind\nthe story.\u201d Speculation about the cause of death and the role played by prescription drugs fed\nsalacious media reports in the tabloids and news and gossip magazines long after the initial news\nstory broke. Other newspapers and magazines, including Time and Entertainment Weekly, focused on\ntribute articles that reviewed Jackson\u2019s long list of accomplishments and reflected on his musical\nlegacy, and the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, Fox, and CBS) aired documentaries\ncovering the pop star\u2019s life. In the days and weeks following Jackson\u2019s death, radio stations\nabandoned their playlists in favor of back-to-back Michael Jackson hits, contributing to a huge\nupswing in record sales. Media coverage continued for many months, saturating newspapers,\nmagazines, and television and radio stations\u2014when the coroner\u2019s report ruled Jackson\u2019s death a\nhomicide in August 2009, during the funeral service a month later, and again in February 2010 when\nJackson\u2019s doctor was charged with involuntary manslaughter for administering a powerful sedative\nto help the star sleep.\nAlthough the book-publishing industry was at a disadvantage because of the time delay between\nreceiving news of Jackson\u2019s death and the ability to physically place books on shelves, many authors,\nagents, and publishers were able to capitalize on the star\u2019s tragic story. Numerous biographies were\npublished in the months following Jackson\u2019s death, along with several explosive \u201ctell-all\u201d books by\npeople close to the star that provided intimate details about his private life. To compensate for their\nlack of immediacy, books have several advantages over other print and web sources, primarily the\nability to include greater depth of information on a subject than any other form of media. Fans eager\nfor more information about their idol and his life eagerly purchased Jackson biographies, including\nhis 1988 autobiography Moonwalk, which was re-released in October 2009.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n726 Other, less immediate forms of media were also commercially successful, including a posthumous\nfilm titled This Is It, named after the much-anticipated comeback tour that was supposed to start just\n3 weeks after Jackson\u2019s death. Composed of rehearsal footage from the concerts, the documentary\nwas shown on more than 3,400 domestic screens during a sold-out 2-week run in October and\nNovember 2009. An accompanying two-disc soundtrack album, featuring classic Jackson hits along\nwith new track \u201cThis Is It,\u201d topped the Billboard 200 chart upon its release in November 2009,\nselling 373,000 copies in its first week of release. A spin-off DVD also topped the U.S. sales chart in\nFebruary 2010, selling more than 1.2 million copies the week of its release. Posthumous sales of\nJackson\u2019s earlier material also generated huge amounts of revenue. In the first 4 months after\nJackson\u2019s death, Forbes magazine estimated that his estate made $90 million in gross earnings.\nMusic industry consultant Barry Massarsky commented, \u201cNothing increases the value of an artist\u2019s\ncatalog [more] than death \u2026 an untimely death.\u201d [4] This cross-media approach is typical of every\nmajor news story, although the controversy surrounding Jackson throughout his life, the\ncircumstances of his death, and the sheer magnitude of his contribution to pop history meant that\nthe performer\u2019s demise had a particularly widespread effect.\nChanging Delivery Methods\nAs the Michael Jackson example shows, the number of people receiving news from the Internet is rapidly\ngrowing, although television remains the dominant source of information. Currently, most Americans use\nmultiple resources for news. In a 2010 survey, 92 percent of people said they obtained their daily news\nfrom a variety of sources, including online news sites, blogs, social networking sites such as Twitter and\nFacebook, television, newspapers, and radio. [5] On a typical day, 6 in 10 American adults get their news\nonline, placing the Internet third behind local television news and national or cable television news. [6] The\nuse of smartphone technology is contributing to the ease with which people can access online news; more\nthan a third of cell phone owners use their phones to check for weather, news, sports, and traffic\ninformation. [7]\nFor young people in particular, the rise in social networking use is transforming the news from a one-way\npassage of information into a social experience. People log on to their Facebook or Twitter accounts, post\nnews stories to their friends\u2019 web pages, comment on stories that interest them, and react to stories they\nhave recently read. During a survey of students at the University of Texas at Austin, senior Meg Scholz\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n727 told researchers that she scanned news websites and blogs every time she went online to check her email,\neliminating the need to pick up a newspaper or watch television news. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I have anything\nagainst a printed newspaper,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for my lifestyle the Internet is more accessible.\u201d [8] Other\nInternet users appreciate the ability to filter news and information that is relevant to them; 28 percent of\nthose surveyed said they customize their social networking home pages to include news from sources or\non topics that interest them. [9] Researchers at the Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life\nProject, the organization that conducted the survey, speculate that this personalization of news is a result\nof the constant stream of information in modern life. Pew Research Center Director Lee Rainie\ncommented, \u201cPeople feel more and more pressed about the volume of information flowing into their lives.\nSo, they customize the information flow in order to manage their lives well and in order to get the material\nthat they feel is most relevant to them.\u201d [10] Although television remains the primary source of news for\nmost Americans, Internet and mobile technology is changing the structure of information delivery\nmethods to audiences, making it more portable, more personalized, and more participatory.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Information delivery methods to audiences include print (newspapers, books, magazines), broadcast\n(radio, television), new media (Internet, social media, blogs), and documentary films. When a big news\nstory breaks, digital media sources have the advantage of speed over traditional media sources\u2014but are\nnot yet considered completely accurate or trustworthy. Established newspapers and magazines still have\nthe advantage of credibility. A big news story passes through every media outlet, starting with the\nInternet and online newspapers, moving to print newspapers, magazines, television, and radio, and finally\non to slower, more detailed types of media such as books and documentaries.\n\uf0b7 Information delivery methods are changing. Most people still get their news from local and national\ntelevision stations, but the Internet is the third most popular source of information, and its popularity is\nincreasing. Smartphone technology is making Internet news more portable, while social networking sites\nprovide a participatory aspect, enabling people to comment on or share news stories of interest. The\nability to customize social networking home pages to filter news topics and sources is making news more\npersonalized, allowing consumers to read only the information that interests them.\nEXERCISES\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n728 Conduct a survey among your friends, family, and classmates to find out where they get their news on a\nregular basis.

Describe the advantages of modern media delivery methods.\n2. Describe the disadvantages of modern media delivery methods.\nIn October 2009, 17-year-old child-care student Ashleigh Hall made friends with a handsome 19-\nyear-old man on Facebook. Ashleigh, from Darlington, England, and her new friend began chatting\nonline and exchanged mobile phone numbers so they could text each other. The excited teenager\nsoon told her friends that she was going on a date with her new boyfriend, Pete, and that his father\nwould be picking her up in his car. Unfortunately, Pete and his \u201cfather\u201d were one and the same\nperson\u2014convicted rapist Peter Chapman. The 33-year-old homeless sex offender used his Facebook\nalter ego (which included photographs of an unknown teenage boy) to lure Ashleigh to a secluded\nlocation, where he raped and murdered her. Chapman was arrested by chance shortly after the event,\nand in court he pleaded guilty to kidnap, rape, and murder.\nAshleigh\u2019s tragic story illustrates some disadvantages of modern media delivery: anonymity and\nunreliability. Although social networking sites such as Facebook are a convenient way to create new\nrelationships and reconnect with old friends, there is no way of knowing whether users are who they\nclaim to be, leaving people (particularly impressionable youths) vulnerable to online predators. Since\nmuch of the content on the Internet is unregulated, this lack of reliability spans the entire online\nspectrum, from news stories and Wikipedia articles to false advertising claims and unscrupulous con\nartists on websites such as Craigslist.\nHowever, modern media can also work to mobilize efforts to stop crime. The popular NBC television\nseries Dateline: To Catch a Predator followed police investigators who used Internet chat rooms to\nidentify potential child molestors. Posing as young teens, police officers entered chat rooms and\nparticipated in conversations with various users. If an adult user began a sexual dialogue and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n730 expressed interest in meeting the teen for sexual purposes, the police set up a sting operation,\ncatching the would-be pedophile in the act. In cases such as these, the rapid transmission of\ninformation and the global nature of the Internet made it possible for criminals to be apprehended.\nAdvantages of Modern Media Delivery\nIf Ashleigh\u2019s story highlights some of the most negative aspects of modern media, the quick dissemination\nof news and information are some of the most beneficial aspects of the World Wide Web. As we noted\nearlier in the chapter, speed can be a huge advantage of online media delivery. When a news story breaks,\nit can be delivered almost instantaneously through RSS feeds and via many major outlets, enabling people\nall over the world to learn about a breaking news story mere minutes after it happens.\nOnce an Internet user has paid for a monthly service provider, most of the content on the web is free,\nallowing people access to an unlimited wealth of information via news websites, search engines,\ndirectories, and home pages for numerous topics ranging from cooking tips to sports trivia. When all this\ninformation became readily available at the touch of a button, many journalists and technology experts\nwrote articles claiming the information overload was bad for people\u2019s health. Fears that the new\ntechnology would cause attention deficit disorder, stunt people\u2019s reasoning, and damage their ability to\nempathize were raised by some highly respected publications, including The Times of London and the The\nNew York Times. However, there is no consistent evidence that the Internet causes psychological\nproblems; in fact, statistics show that people who use social networking sites have better offline social\nlives, and people who play computer games are better at absorbing and reacting to information than those\nwho do not, and they experience no loss of accuracy or increased impulsiveness. [1] As Vaughan Bell points\nout in his article about the history of media scares, \u201cWorries about information overload are as old as\ninformation itself, with each generation reimagining the dangerous impacts of technology on mind and\nbrain.\u201d [2]\nIn addition to speed, reach, and cost, online media delivery enables a wider range of voices and\nperspectives on any subject. Through nontraditional media such as blogs and Twitter, people can put their\nown personal slant on current events, popular culture, and issues that are important to them without\nfeeling obliged to remain neutral. A study by the Pew Research Center found that nontraditional media\nsources report on a wider variety of stories than traditional media, enabling individual sites to develop\ntheir own personality and voice. The study also discovered that these online sources focus on highly\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n731 emotional subject matter that can be personalized by the writers and shared in the social forum. [3] By\nopening up blogs and social media sites to online discussion or debate, bloggers enable readers to\ngenerate their own content, turning audiences from passive consumers into active creators. In this way,\nknowledge becomes a social process rather than a one-way street\u2014the blogger posts an opinion, a reader\ncomments on the blogger\u2019s opinion, the blogger then evaluates the reader\u2019s comment and revises his or\nher perspective accordingly, and the process repeats itself until an issue has been thoroughly explored.\nMany bloggers also provide links to other blogs they support or enjoy reading, enabling ideas with merit\nto filter through various channels on the Internet.\nDisadvantages of Modern Media Delivery\nAlong with a growing number of online predators misrepresenting themselves on social networking sites,\nthe Internet is responsible for a lot of other types of misinformation circulating the web. Unless users are\nable to distinguish between reliable, unbiased sources and factual information, they may find themselves\nconsuming inaccurate news reports or false encyclopedia entries. Even so-called reliable news sources are\nsubject to occasional errors with their source material. When French composer Maurice Jarre died in\n2009 at the age of 84, Irish sociology and economics student Shane Fitzgerald decided to try an\nexperiment with Wikipedia. He added fictional quotes to Jarre\u2019s Wikipedia entry and then watched as\nnewspapers worldwide (including reputable sources such as the The Guardian) copied his quotes word for\nword and attributed them to the composer. Red-faced journalists were later forced to correct their errors\nby retracting the quotes. Writing a follow-up report for The Irish Times, Fitzgerald commented, \u201cIf I could\nso easily falsify the news across the globe, even to this small extent, then it is unnerving to think about\nwhat other false information may be reported in the press.\u201d [4]\nAlthough most traditional media strive for nonpartisanship, many newer online sources are fervently\nright wing or left wing. With websites such as the Huffington Post on the left of the political spectrum and\nthe Drudge Report on the right, consumers need to be aware when they are reading news with an\nideological slant. Critics fear the trend toward social media sources may lead to the restriction of the\nmovement of ideas. If consumers choose their media circle exclusively consistent with their own political\nbiases, they will be limited to a narrow political viewpoint.\nAlong with practical disadvantages, the Internet also has several economic disadvantages. An increasing\ngap between people who can afford personal computers and access to the web and people who cannot,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n732 known as the digital divide, separates the haves and the have-nots. Although about 75 percent of U.S.\nhouseholds are connected to the Internet, there are gaps in access in terms of age, income, and education.\nFor example, a recent study found that 93 percent of people age 18\u201329 have Internet access, compared\nwith 70 percent of people 50\u201364 and just 38 percent of people over 65. [5] Similar disparities occur with\nincome and education (see Figure 16.2).\nThese disparities mean that people with lower incomes and educational levels are at a disadvantage when\nit comes to accessing online job listings, information, news, and computer-related skills that might help\nthem in the workplace. The digital divide is even more prominent between developed and developing\ncountries. In nations such as Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, the government permits little or no access\nto the Internet. In other countries, such as Mexico, Brazil, and Columbia, poor telecommunications\ninfrastructure forces users to wait extremely inconvenient lengths of time to get online. And in many\ndeveloping countries that have poor public utilities and intermittent electrical service, the Internet is\nalmost unheard of. Despite its large population, the entire continent of Africa accounts for less than 5\npercent of Internet usage worldwide. [6]\nFigure 16.2\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n733 The digital divide places people with lower incomes and lower educational levels at a disadvantage\nwhen it comes to Internet access.\nTraditional media also face economic disadvantages when it comes to profiting from the Internet. Having\nfreely given away much of their online content, newspapers are struggling to transition to an entirely ad-\nbased business model. Although publishers initially envisioned a digital future supported entirely by\nadvertising, two years of plummeting ad revenue (the Newspaper Association of America reported that\nonline advertising revenues fell 11.8 percent in 2009) has caused some papers to consider introducing\nonline fees. Although modern media delivery is quick and efficient, companies are still trying to establish\na successful economic model to keep them afloat in the long term.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Modern media delivery has numerous advantages, including the speed at which content is delivered, the\nwidespread reach of the Internet, and the low cost\u2014most online content is free. The sheer amount of\ninformation available online has caused many critics to claim the information overload is bad for people\u2019s\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n734 health; however, studies have not substantiated this theory. Online media delivery enables a wide range\nof voices and perspectives to be heard via blogs and social networking sites. These sites are also changing\nthe way knowledge is consumed: from a one-way system (for example, through passively reading\nnewspaper articles) to a dynamic process that involves an entire online community.\n\uf0b7 Modern media delivery also has several disadvantages. Not all web pages are reliable sources of\ninformation; many are subject to user error (for example, on sites such as Wikipedia) or bias (for example,\non partisan political blogs). The Internet also has economic disadvantages; it widens the digital divide\nbetween those who have access to the technology and those who do not (usually older people, people of\nlower economic means or educational status, or people in developing countries with poor infrastructure),\nand causes problems for traditional media, which are finding it difficult to profit from digital technology.\nEXERCISES\nChoose two online newspaper articles or blogs on the same subject, one from a liberal website such as\nthe Huffington Post and one from a conservative website such as the Drudge Report. Read through both\narticles and underline examples of political bias or prejudice. Then answer the following short-answer\nquestions. Each response should be a minimum of one paragraph.\n1. How does each article use selective facts to support its argument?\n2. What information is missing from each article?\n3. How might reading just one of these articles unfairly sway someone looking for nonpartisan\ninformation on the topic you have chosen?\n4. What are the advantages of modern media delivery methods?

Determine popular trends in social networking.\n2. Describe the concept of membership-only websites that cater to specific audiences.\n3. Explain the use and appeal of electronic applications.\nWhat do your former high school classmates do for a living? What does your favorite celebrity think\nabout the current administration? What do other professionals in your field think about industry\ntrends? Which restaurant do your coworkers frequent? Five years ago, these questions would most\nlikely have been met with blank stares, but thanks to the exponential growth of electronic media\u2014\nsocial networking in particular\u2014it is now possible to keep track of past and present contacts via the\nInternet, sometimes in exhaustive detail. As social media use continues to grow in popularity,\nmarketers, advertisers, and businesses are looking for ways to use the new technology to increase\nrevenue and improve customer service. Meanwhile, social networking sites are expanding into\ncommerce, connecting businesses and consumers via third-party sites so that people can bring a\nnetwork of friends to partner websites. Facebook Connect, for example, enables a consumer to visit a\npartner site such as Forever 21, find a pair of jeans on sale, and broadcast the information to\neveryone on her Facebook network. If a few Facebook friends do the same thing, the information can\ncreate an effective viral marketing campaign for the partner site. A more secure version of the ill-\nfated Beacon (see Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social Media\"), Facebook Connect extends the\nFacebook platform out of the social network\u2019s walls, creating one giant network on the web.\nThe current trend toward immediacy (instant Twitter updates, instant Google searches, instant\ndriving directions from Google Maps) is compounded by the development of smartphone\napplications, which allow users to access or post information wherever they happen to be located.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n736 For example, a person shopping for a particular product can instantly compare the price of that\nproduct across an entire range of stores using the Android ShopSavvy app, while someone new to an\narea can immediately locate a gas station, park, or supermarket using iPhone\u2019s AroundMe app.\nIndustry insiders have coined the term nowism to describe the instant gratification that can be\nachieved by real-time content on the web. Sparked by social networking sites such as Facebook and\nTwitter, the real-time trend looks set to continue, with companies from all types of industries\njumping on the immediacy bandwagon.\nSocial Networking Continues to Grow\nThe growth of social media over the past few years has been exponential; according to Nielsen, Twitter\nalone grew 1,382 percent in February 2009, registering 7,000,000 unique visitors in the United States for\nthe month. By February 2010, Twitter had 75,000,000 registered users and between 10,000,000 and\n15,000,000 active tweeters. [1] Meanwhile, Facebook has more than 400 million active users worldwide,\naccording to its website, with each user averaging 130 Facebook friends. In February 2010, Facebook was\ndeclared the web\u2019s most popular site, with users spending an average of more than 7 hours a month on the\nsite; more than the amount of time spent on Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, Amazon.com, Wikipedia, and\nMSN combined. [2]\nFigure 16.3\nThe average U.S. user spends more than 7 hours a month on social networking site Facebook.\nInitially conceived in 2004 as a website for students to keep in touch over the Internet and get to know\neach other better, Facebook has since developed into the world\u2019s largest social networking site. In addition\nto connecting friends and acquaintances and enabling users to share photos, links, and multimedia, the\nsite (along with other social networking sites such as MySpace) has branched out into social gaming, a\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n737 rapidly growing industry that allows users to download free games through the site and play online with\nfriends and family members. Appealing to a wide demographic\u2014including people who rarely play video\ngames\u2014social games such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars are free to play, but generate revenue for\ndevelopers by offering additional bonuses or virtual goods for paying players. A recent survey found that\nmost of the revenue generated by the social gaming audience comes from a small percentage of players\n(around 10 percent) who are willing to actually spend money on social networking games. Out of that 10\npercent, just 2 percent of people, described as the \u201cwhales\u201d of the social gaming industry, spend more\nthan $25 a month on social games. Inside Network founder Justin Smith, who coauthored the survey,\nsaid, \u201cIt is clear that people either spend a lot of money or spend nothing.\u201d [3] The games, which primarily\nappeal to the female over-40 demographic, are designed so that Facebook users can spend a few minutes\nplaying several times a day. In the United States, 55 percent of social network game players are women,\nand the average age is 48. [4]\nOther continuing trends in social networking include microblogging on sites such as Twitter, which is\nrapidly becoming the fastest source of news on the Internet. The site acts as a personal newswire, passing\non information about shared world events as they affect people in real time. For example, when an\nearthquake shook Los Angeles in 2008, people began tweeting personal accounts from their homes 9\nminutes before the Associated Press picked up the story. In 2009, citizens of Iran bypassed government\ncensorship by tweeting news of the election results across the world. Organizations such as the Associated\nPress communicated with Twitter users to receive information about the resulting protests and\ndemonstrations. [5]\nBusiness owners are also beginning to realize the power of Twitter; online shoe\nmerchant Zappos.com provides more than 500 of its employees with Twitter accounts to humanize the\npeople behind the sales and help them connect with their customers. Feedback from Twitter users\nprovides companies with valuable information about how they can improve their products and services.\nCelebrities have also attached themselves to Twitter as a means of publicizing forthcoming projects and\nkeeping in touch with fans. Actor Ashton Kutcher is particularly media savvy; beating news outlet CNN to\nbecome the first Twitter user with more than 1,000,000 followers in 2009, the star used his popularity to\nraise awareness for medical charity Malaria No More, donating 10,000 mosquito nets to the organization\nfollowing his success as Twitter\u2019s first \u201cmillionaire.\u201d Kutcher\u2019s social media consultancy, Katalyst Films,\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n738 maximizes the use of social networking technology by working with entertainment content, advertising,\nand online conversation in an effort to generate money from the web. \u201cEntertainment, really, is a dying\nindustry,\u201d Kutcher said in a 2009 interview. \u201cWe\u2019re a balanced social-media studio, with revenue streams\nfrom multiple sources\u2014film, TV, and now digital. For the brand stuff, we\u2019re not replacing ad agencies but\nworking with everyone to provide content and the monetization strategies to succeed on the Web.\u201d [6]\nIn addition to brand marketing and cross-promotions infiltrating social networking sites, digital experts\npredict social media will become more exclusive, with people filtering out clutter from unwanted sources.\nDavid Armano, senior vice president of Edelman Digital, said, \u201cNot everyone can fit on someone\u2019s newly\ncreated Twitter list and as networks begin to fill with noise, it\u2019s likely that user behavior such as \u2018hiding\u2019\nthe hyperactive updaters that appear in your Facebook news feed may become more common.\u201d [7]\nExclusivity on the Web\nArmano\u2019s prediction for social networking sites may filter across other areas of the web. Membership-only\nsites that cater to a specific audience are becoming increasingly popular. Based on e-commerce models\nsuch as Gilt and Rue La La, which sell luxury brand clothing at below-retail prices by invitation only,\nwebsites such as Thrillist offer exclusive clothing deals in addition to providing information on food,\ndrink, entertainment, nightlife, and gadgets by subscription newsletter. Aimed at young, affluent male\nprofessionals, Thrillist reaches more than 2,200,000 subscriptions across the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom, and has reached over $10,000,000 in revenue in 2010. Cofounder and CEO Ben Lerer\nbelieves that Thrillist represents the future of media. \u201cIt\u2019s what modern media looks like,\u201d he said.\n\u201cContent plus commerce.\u201d[8] In 2010, Thrillist acquired members-only online retailer JackThreads.com,\nenabling the company to offer its user base exclusive access to JackThreads\u2019 private shopping community\nas a benefit to subscribing.\nAnother highly targeted web trend is the emergence of micro magazines\u2014digital publications aimed at a\nspecific audience that attract advertisers wanting to reach a particular group of people. For example, the\nmagazine Fearless is an online magazine entirely dedicated to stories of overcoming fear. Marketing\nexpert Seth Godin believes that whereas publications such as Newsweek and Time are \u201cslow and general,\nthe world is fast and specific,\u201d which creates a need for online subscription magazines that can provide\ntargeted material to interested individuals. [9] \u201cThe big difference is that instead of paying for an office\nbuilding and paper and overhead, the money for an ad in a micro-magazine can go directly to the people\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n739 who write and promote it and the ad itself will be seen by exactly the right audience,\u201d Godin writes. [10] The\npossibilities for micro magazines are endless, with focus topics covering every travel destination, interest\ngroup, and profession. Operating in a similar way to traditional subscription magazine models, micro\nmagazines are distributed via email or RSS and are supported by a forum or blog. This interactive aspect\nprovides readers with a sense of community\u2014rather than passive consumers of general-interest news,\nthey are part of a network of readers who can communicate with others who have a shared interest.\nFigure 16.4\nThe website Thrillist provides subscribers with a chic urban guide.\nAn Excess of Apps\nIn April 2009, Apple celebrated the 1 billionth download from its App Store. Launched in July 2008, the\nonline venue for third-party iPhone and iPod Touch applications initially offered consumers 500 apps,\nranging from shortcuts to websites such as Facebook and eBay to games and useful online services.\nAlthough competing smartphones such as the Treo and BlackBerry offered similar application facilities,\nApple\u2019s App Store quickly became the most successful platform for mobile software, averaging around\n$1,000,000 a day in iPhone application sales during the first month of its existence. [11] Under a revenue-\nsharing agreement, the company keeps 30 percent of any income generated and gives the other 70 percent\nto third-party app developers. By April 2011, the App Store offered around 350,000 applications, aiding\niPhone and iPad users with numerous daily activities, ranging from identifying an unknown song, to\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n740 finding a nearby gas station, to matching the color of a photograph taken by the iPhone with a database of\npaint colors. Unlike many commercials that exaggerate a products\u2019 abilities, Apple\u2019s tagline \u201cThere\u2019s an\napp for that\u201d is usually on the mark.\nOne recent trend in smartphone applications is the use of location-sharing services such as Foursquare,\nGowalla, Brightkite, and Google Latitude. Utilizing the GPS function in modern smartphones, these apps\nenable users to \u201ccheck in\u201d to a venue so that friends can locate each other easily. The apps also encourage\nusers to explore new places in their area by following other users\u2019 suggestions on places to go. Users have\nthe option of automatically updating their Facebook and Twitter accounts when they check in, and are\nable to earn points or badges according to how many times they check into a location, adding a\ncompetitive element to the service. Users with the most check-ins at a location become the \u201cmayor\u201d of that\nplace, and some businesses offer rewards to users who achieve this status.\nAlthough many apps stand alone, some are tied to other forms of media. For example, popular musical-\ncomedy television show Glee has its own application that enables users to sing their favorite musical\nnumbers from the show, upload their efforts to Facebook or MySpace, and invite friends to sing with\nthem. The application also provides a voice-enhancing feature to correct users\u2019 pitch and harmonize their\nvoices while they sing. Other cross-media applications include game versions of television quiz shows Are\nYou Smarter Than a 5th Grader? and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, apps for individual celebrities\nsuch as country singer Reba McEntire, and apps for television news channels, including CNN and\nMSNBC. Making life easier for users while providing them with endless entertainment options, apps have\nbecome a huge part of everyday life for many people; by June 2010, Apple\u2019s App Store had generated total\nrevenue of $1.4 billion. [12]\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Social networking sites continue to grow in popularity; Facebook is the largest social networking site on\nthe web with more than 400 million users worldwide. Social gaming is a popular trend on networking\nsites, and many users are not typical video game players; instead, they fit the female over-40\ndemographic. Developers generate revenue from social networking sites by charging gamers real money\nfor bonuses or virtual goods. Microblogging is another popular social networking trend. Key events\naround the world are often reported on microblog Twitter first by users who experience the events\nfirsthand. Business owners use Twitter to connect with their customers more effectively. Celebrities such\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n741 as Ashton Kutcher are media savvy and use Twitter to promote worthy causes. Digital experts predict\nsocial networking will become more exclusive in the future, with people filtering out clutter from\nunwanted sources.\n\uf0b7 The Internet is moving in a more exclusive direction through membership-only sites such as Thrillist,\nwhich cater to specific audiences via subscription newsletters. Micro magazines such as Fearless, which\ntarget very specific audiences and are distributed via email or RSS feed, are also becoming more popular.\n\uf0b7 Applications for smartphones and tablet computers such as the iPad are hugely popular, offering\nconsumers numerous shortcuts to their favorite websites in addition to games and services. Two current\ntrends are location-sharing applications, facilitated by the GPS functionality on modern smartphones, and\ncross-media applications such as those that tie in with particular television shows, celebrities, or music\nradio stations.\nEXERCISE\nPoll a group of friends or colleagues about the amount of time they spend on social networking sites, and\nwrite a one- to two-page report on the answers to the following questions.\n1. How often do most people spend on each site at one time?\n2. For what purpose do they primarily use social networking sites? Does this differ from the popular\ntrends in social networking that you read about in this section?\n3. How many people play social networking games, and are they willing to spend money on them?\n4. How many people use smartphone apps to connect to social networking sites? What is the appeal of\nsuch electronic applications?\n5. Describe the concept of membership-only websites.

Describe the impact of the USA PATRIOT Act on privacy.\n2. Explain the consequences of social networking in terms of privacy and employment.\n3. Describe current attempts to restore privacy at home and in the workplace.\nWhen a young waitress named Ashley was having a tough time at work, she decided to vent about\nher job on Facebook. The 22-year-old was working an overtime shift at a North Carolina pizza parlor\nand a demanding customer who had stayed late left a meager tip. Feeling frustrated, Ashley posted a\nshort status update on her Facebook profile, calling the anonymous customer an unflattering name.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n743 Unfortunately for Ashley, her coworkers saw her post on the social networking site. Two days after\nher angry post, Ashley\u2019s manager called her in to show her a copy of her comments and promptly\nfired her. [1] Ashley\u2019s story is one of many examples of employers terminating their employees\nbecause of inappropriate comments or photographs on social networking sites; a study by Internet\nsecurity firm Proofpoint found that 8 percent of companies have dismissed an employee for his or\nher behavior on social networking sites. [2]These cases highlight a blurring of personal and\nprofessional life in the Internet age, leaving many people uncomfortable with the notion that their\nemployer can monitor what they say or do in their free time and use it as a reason for dismissal.\nSince the passing of the USA PATRIOT Act, which as we have seen extended the government\u2019s\nsurveillance powers over communication devices, privacy has become a fiercely controversial issue in\nthe United States, with supporters arguing the legal measures are necessary to prevent terrorist\nattacks, and opponents claiming that the act infringes on civil liberties. Privacy issues raised by the\nUSA PATRIOT Act, combined with the growing problem of identity theft and increased monitoring\nin the workplace, make privacy a greater concern now than ever before.\nThe USA PATROIT Act: Weakening Privacy Laws or Protecting Citizens?\nFigure 16.5\nPresident George W. Bush signs the USA PATRIOT Act.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n744 As we saw in Chapter 14 \"Ethics of Mass Media\", the USA PATRIOT Act has generated a huge amount of\ndebate and controversy since its approval by President George W. Bush in October 2001. Signed into law\nwith little debate or congressional review just 43 days after the September 11 attacks, the act\u2019s provisions\nenable the government, with permission from a special court, to obtain roving wiretaps over multiple\ncommunication devices, seize suspects\u2019 records without their knowledge, monitor an individual\u2019s web\nsurfing and library records, and conduct surveillance on a person deemed to be suspicious but without\nknown ties to a terrorist group. Approving the House of Representatives\u2019 decision to renew 16 of the act\u2019s\nprovisions in 2005, President Bush said, \u201cThe [USA] PATRIOT Act is essential to fighting the war on\nterror and preventing our enemies from striking America again. In the war on terror, we cannot afford to\nbe without this law for a single moment.\u201d [3]\nHowever, not everyone agrees with the former president\u2019s opinion. While proponents of the act cite the\nneed to disrupt or prevent terrorist attacks, New York City Council member Bill Perkins, who sponsored a\n2004 resolution condemning the law, says, \u201cThe [USA] PATRIOT Act is really unpatriotic, it undermines\nour civil rights and civil liberties. We never give up our rights, that\u2019s what makes us\nAmericans.\u201d [4] Opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act sparked a wave of protest across the United States.\nMore than 330 communities in 41 states passed resolutions condemning the act. [5] Librarians in Detroit\nreported that Muslim children had stopped checking out books on Islam out of fear they were being\nmonitored, while librarians in New Jersey and California shredded records and computer sign-up sheets\nin an attempt to thwart the legislation. While citizens can protect against invasions of privacy on the\nInternet by limiting personal information and being careful about the information they share, the\ninvasion of privacy through other lines of communication is more difficult to prevent. Despite fierce\nobjections to the act, President Barack Obama signed an unamended 1-year extension of several key\nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act (including the use of roving wire taps) in 2010. In the near future,\npoliticians will have to decide whether citizen protection is worth the loss of liberties in the United States.\nSocial Networking: The Blurring of Personal and Professional\nThe privacy issue has strayed well beyond government legislation; it affects anyone who is currently\nemployed or even just looking for a job. When employers consider whether or not to hire an individual,\nthey no longer need to rely on just a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to obtain pertinent information. A simple Google search often\nreveals that a potential employee has a social networking site on the Internet, and unless privacy settings\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n745 have been put in place, the employer can access everything the candidate has posted online. A 2010\nsurvey byCareerBuilder.com revealed that 53 percent of companies check out candidates\u2019 profiles on\nsocial networking sites such as MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook before deciding to employ\nthem, and a further 12 percent of companies intend to review social networking sites of potential\nemployees in the future. [6] Factors that affect an employer\u2019s decision whether or not to hire candidates\nbased on their social networking page include the use of drugs or drinking, the posting of discriminatory\ncomments, or the posting of photographs deemed to be inappropriate or provocative. The survey also\nrevealed that some candidates posted information on their social networking page that proved they had\nlied on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9. [7]\nAs we have seen, once employees are hired, they still need to be careful about what they post on social\nnetworking sites, particularly in relation to their jobs. Cheryl James, a hospital worker from Michigan,\nwas fired in 2010 after she posted a message on Facebook describing a patient as a \u201ccop killer\u201d and hoping\nthat he would \u201crot in hell.\u201d [8] A few years earlier, Virgin Atlantic Airlines terminated 13 crew members for\ndescribing passengers as \u201cchavs\u201d (a derogatory British term similar to \u201cwhite trash\u201d). A Virgin spokesman\ncommented, \u201cThere is a time and a place for Facebook. But there is no justification for it to be used as a\nsounding board for staff of any company to criticize the very passengers who pay their salaries.\u201d [9]\nAlthough employees might reasonably expect to be disciplined for using social networking sites on\ncompany time\u2014a 2009 study discovered that 54 percent of U.S. companies have banned workers from\nusing social networks during work hours\u2014the issue of whether companies can influence how their\nemployees behave in their private lives is a little trickier. [10] The outcome of a 2009 federal court case in\nNew Jersey may have some bearing on whether companies have the right to spy on their employees while\nthe employees are on password-protected sites using non\u2013work computers. The case, between restaurant\nemployees Brian Pietrylo and Doreen Marino and managers at Houston\u2019s in Hackensack, New Jersey,\ncentered on a forum set up by Pietrylo on MySpace. The forum, which was password-protected and\nrequired an email invitation to join, made fun of the restaurant d\u00e9cor and patrons and included sexual\njokes and negative comments about restaurant supervisors. Restaurant hostess Karen St. Jean, who had\nreceived an invitation to the forum, showed the supervisors the site and believed they found it amusing;\nhowever, the information was passed further up the management chain, and Pietrylo and Marino were\nfired. The restaurant claimed that the pair\u2019s online posts violated policies set out in the employee\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n746 handbook, including professionalism and a positive attitude. Marino and Pietrylo filed for unfair\ndismissal, claiming that the restaurant managers had violated their privacy under New Jersey law.\nFollowing a trial in June 2009, a federal jury agreed that the restaurant had violated state and federal\nlaws that protect the privacy of web communications. The jury awarded Pietrylo and Marino a total of\n$3,400 in back pay and $13,600 in punitive damages. [11]\nAlthough the outcome of the New Jersey case may have some bearing on the use of social networking sites\noutside of work, employees should still exercise caution in the office. Companies are increasingly using\ntechnological advances to monitor Internet usage, track employees\u2019 whereabouts through GPS-enabled\ncell phones, and even film employees\u2019 movements via webcam or miniature video cameras. Lewis Maltby,\nauthor of workplace rights book Can They Do That?, says, \u201cThere are two trends driving the increase in\nmonitoring. One is financial pressure. Everyone is trying to get leaner and meaner, and monitoring is one\nway to do it. The other reason is that it\u2019s easier than ever. It used to be difficult and expensive to monitor\nemployees, and now, it\u2019s easy and cheap.\u201d [12]Whereas employees using their own equipment outside of\nwork hours might have a reasonable expectation of privacy, the situation changes when using company\nproperty. Nancy Flynn, founder of training and consulting firm ePolicy Institute, said, \u201cFederal law gives\nemployers the legal right to monitor all computer activity. The computer system is the property of the\nemployer, and the employee has absolutely no reasonable expectations of privacy when using that\nsystem.\u201d [13] Because this lack of privacy covers everything from instant messages sent to coworkers to\nemails sent from personal accounts when employees are logged onto the company network, the prudent\naction for employees to take is to separate their work life from their personal life as much as possible.\nRestoration of Privacy\nSocial networking sites have come under fire in recent years for violating users\u2019 privacy. In 2009,\nFacebook simplified its settings to keep up with the popularity of microblogging sites such as Twitter. One\nconsequence of this action was that the default setting enabled status updates and photos to be seen\nacross the entire Internet (see Chapter 11 \"The Internet and Social Media\" for more information about\nFacebook privacy settings). The social networking site has also come under criticism for a temporary\nglitch that gave users unintended access to their friends\u2019 private instant messages, and for a new feature in\n2010 that enabled the company to share private information with third-party websites. Although\nFacebook simplified its controls for sharing information by consolidating them on a single page and\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n747 making it easier for users to opt out of sharing information with third-party applications, public concern\nprompted 14 privacy groups to file an unfair-trade complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in\nMay 2010. [14] Congress is currently investigating whether more government regulation of social\nnetworking sites is necessary to protect people\u2019s privacy.\nOther companies, including Google, are actively attempting to restore users\u2019 privacy. In response to\nrevelations that the company had accidentally captured and archived wireless data with its Google Street\nView cars (which are equipped with cameras to provide panoramic views along many streets around the\nworld), Google announced in 2010 that it was launching an encrypted search facility. The technology\nuses SSL (secure sockets layer) to protect Internet searches from being intercepted while traveling across\nthe web. Users can activate the secure search facility by typing \u201chttps\u201d at the beginning of the URL instead\nof \u201chttp.\u201d Although the technology provides a measure of security\u2014the search will not be archived in the\ncomputer\u2019s history or appear in the AutoFill during a subsequent search\u2014it is not entirely private. Google\nmaintains a record of what people search for, and Internet users will still need to rely on the company\u2019s\npromise not to abuse the data. However, if the encrypted search facility proves successful, it may become\na role model for social networking sites, which could offer encryption for more than just log-ins.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 Privacy issues have become increasingly important in recent years with the rise of identity theft,\nworkplace monitoring, and the passing of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001. The PATRIOT Act was signed in\nthe wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It gave the federal government extended\nsurveillance rights, including the ability to obtain roving wiretaps over multiple communication devices,\nseize suspects\u2019 records without their knowledge, monitor an individual\u2019s web-surfing and library records,\nand conduct surveillance of a person deemed to be suspicious but without known ties to a terrorist\ngroup. Supporters of the act claimed the provisions were essential in the efforts to prevent further\nterrorist attacks; however, opponents claimed that the act breached civil liberties and unfairly infringed\non people\u2019s privacy.\n\uf0b7 Monitoring employees in the workplace has begun to stray outside of office hours, and employees are\nnow finding their social networking sites being scanned by employers for offensive material.\nInappropriate comments or photos on a social networking site may negatively affect a person\u2019s chance of\nfinding a job if employers use sites such as Facebook and Twitter as a means of screening applicants. The\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n748 issue of whether employers are allowed to discriminate against employees based on their out-of-work\nactivities has not been fully decided; however, in general, anything that takes place on company property\nor on company time may be scrutinized and used as a reason for dismissal.\n\uf0b7 Some websites are attempting to restore privacy settings in light of recent scandals in which personal\ninformation was divulged on the Internet. Google has established an encrypted search facility that\nenables users to browse the web without running the risk of sensitive information being intercepted. The\nencryption also prevents websites from being stored on the computer\u2019s history and stops them from\nappearing on the AutoFill function during future searches. However, the encryption is not entirely private\nbecause Google still retains a record of search information.\nEXERCISES\nVisit the website located at http://www.eff.org/wp/effs-top-12-ways-protect-your-online-privacy.

Explain the technology diffusion model.\n2. Identify technological failures over the past decade.\n3. Describe the relationship between mass media and new technology.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n750 When the iPad went on sale in the United States in April 2010, 36-year-old graphic designer Josh\nKlenert described the device as \u201cridiculously expensive [and] way overpriced.\u201d [1] The cost of the new\ntechnology, however, did not deter Klenert from purchasing an iPad; he preordered the tablet\ncomputer as soon as it was available and ventured down to Apple\u2019s SoHo store in New York on\nopening weekend to be one of the first to buy it. Klenert, and everyone else who stood in line at the\nApple store during the initial launch of the iPad, is described by sociologists as an early adopter: a\ntech-loving pioneer who is among the first to embrace new technology as soon as it arrives on the\nmarket. What causes a person to be an early adopter or a late adopter? What are the benefits of each?\nIn this section you will read about the cycle of technology and how it is diffused in a society. The\nprocess and factors influencing the diffusion of new technology is often discussed in the context of a\ndiffusion model known as the technology adoption life cycle.\nDiffusion of Technology: The Technology Adoption Life Cycle\nFigure 16.7\nLike other cultural shifts, technological advances follow a fairly standard diffusion model.\nThe technology adoption life cycle was originally observed during the technology diffusion studies of rural\nsociologists during the 1950s. University researchers George Beal, Joe Bohlen, and Everett Rogers were\nlooking at the adoption rate of hybrid seed among Iowa farmers in an attempt to draw conclusions about\nhow farmers accept new ideas. They discovered that the process of adoption over time fit a normal growth\ncurve pattern\u2014there was a slow gradual rate of adoption, then quite a rapid rate of adoption, followed by\na leveling off of the adoption rate. Personal and social characteristics influenced when farmers adopted\nthe use of hybrid seed corn; younger, better-educated farmers tended to adapt to the new technology\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n751 almost as soon as it became available, whereas older, less-educated farmers waited until most other farms\nwere using hybrid seed before they adopted the process, or they resisted change altogether.\nIn 1962, Rogers generalized the technology diffusion model in his book Diffusion of Innovations, using\nthe farming research to draw conclusions about the spread of new ideas and technology. Like his fellow\nfarming model researchers, Rogers recognizes five categories of participants: innovators, who tend to be\nexperimentalists and are interested in the technology itself; early adopters such as Josh Klenert, who are\ntechnically sophisticated and are interested in using the technology for solving professional and academic\nproblems; early majority, who constitute the first part of the mainstream, bringing the new technology\ninto common use; late majority, who are less comfortable with the technology and may be skeptical about\nits benefits; and laggards, who are resistant to the new technology and may be critical of its use by\nothers. [2]\nWhen new technology is successfully released in the market, it follows the technology adoption life cycle\nshown in Figure 16.7. Innovators and early adopters, attracted by something new, want to be the first to\npossess the innovation, sometimes even before discovering potential uses for it, and are unconcerned with\nthe price. When the iPad hit stores in April 2010, 120,000 units were sold on the first day, primarily as a\nresult of presales. [3] Sales dropped on days 2 and 3, suggesting that demand for the device dipped slightly\nafter the initial first-day excitement. Within the first month, Apple had sold 1,000,000 iPads, exceeding\nindustry expectations. [4] However, many mainstream consumers (the early majority) are waiting to find\nout just how popular the device will become before making a purchase. Research carried out in the United\nKingdom suggests that many consumers are uncertain how the iPad will fit into their lives\u2014the survey\ndrew comments such as \u201cEverything it does I can do on my PC or my phone right now\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s just a big\niPod Touch\u2026a big iPhone without the phone.\u201d [5] The report, by research group Simpson Carpenter,\nconcludes that most consumers are \u201cunable to find enough rational argument to justify taking the\nplunge.\u201d [6]\nHowever, as with previous technological advances, the early adopters who have jumped on the iPad\nbandwagon may ultimately validate its potential, helping mainstream users make sense of the device and\nits uses. Forrester Research notes that much of the equipment acquired by early adopters\u2014laptops, MP3\nplayers, digital cameras, broadband Internet access at home, and mobile phones\u2014is shifting into the\nmainstream. Analyst Jacqueline Anderson, who works for Forrester, said, \u201cThere\u2019s really no group out of\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n752 the tech loop. America is becoming a digital nation. Technology adoption continues to roll along, picking\nup more and more mainstream consumers every year.\u201d [7] To cite just one example, in 2008 nearly 10\nmillion American households added HDTV, an increase of 27 percent over the previous year. [8] By the\ntime most technology reaches mainstream consumers, it is more established, more user-friendly, and\ncheaper than earlier versions or prototypes. In June 2010, Amazon.com slashed the price of its Kindle e-\nreader from $259 to $189 and in 2012 to $79 in response to competition from Barnes & Noble\u2019s\nNook. [9] Companies frequently reduce the price of technological devices once the initial novelty wears off,\nas a result of competition from other manufacturers or as a strategy to retain market share.\nAlthough many people ultimately adapt to new technology, some are extremely resistant or unwilling to\nchange at all. When Netscape web browser user John Uribe was repeatedly urged by a message from\nparent company AOL to switch to one of Netscape\u2019s successors, Firefox or Flock, he ignored the\nsuggestions. Despite being informed that AOL would stop providing support for the web browser service\nin March 2008, Uribe continued to use it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of irrational,\u201d Mr. Uribe said. \u201cIt worked for me, so I\nstuck with it. Until there is really some reason to totally abandon it, I won\u2019t.\u201d [10] Uribe is a self-confessed\nlate adopter\u2014he still uses dial-up Internet service and is happy to carry on using his aging Dell computer\nwith its small amount of memory. Members of the late majority make up a large percentage of the U.S.\npopulation\u2014a 2010 survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau found that despite the technology\u2019s\nwidespread availability, 40 percent of households across the United States have no high-speed or\nbroadband Internet connection, while 30 percent have no Internet at all. [11] Of 32.1 million households in\nurban areas, the most common reason for not having high-speed Internet was a lack of interest or a lack\nof need for the technology. [12]\nFigure 16.8\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n753 The most common reason that people in both rural and urban areas do not have high-speed\nInternet is a lack of interest in the technology.\nExperts claim that, rather than slowing down the progression of new technological developments,\nlaggards in the technology adoption life cycle may help to control the development of new technology.\nPaul Saffo, a technology forecaster, said, \u201cLaggards have a bad rap, but they are crucial in pacing the\nnature of change. Innovation requires the push of early adopters and the pull of laypeople asking whether\nsomething really works. If this was a world in which only early adopters got to choose, we\u2019d all be using\nCB radios and quadraphonic stereo.\u201d [13] He added that aspects of the laggard and early adopter coexist in\nmost people. For example, many consumers buy the latest digital camera and end up using just a fraction\nof its functions. Technological laggards may be the reason that not every new technology becomes a\nmainstream trend (see sidebar).\nNot Consumer-Approved: Technological Flops\nHave you ever heard of the Apple Newton? How about Microsoft Bob? Or DIVX? For most people, the\nnames probably mean very little because these were all flash-in-the-pan technologies that never caught on\nwith mainstream consumers.\nThe Apple Newton was an early PDA, officially known as the MessagePad. Introduced by Apple in 1993,\nthe Newton contained many of the features now popularized by modern smartphones, including personal\ninformation management and add-on storage slots. Despite clever advertising and relentless word-of-\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n754 mouth campaigns, the Newton failed to achieve anything like the popularity enjoyed by most Apple\nproducts. Hampered by its large size compared to more recent equivalents (such as the PalmPilot) and its\ncost\u2014basic models cost around $700, with more advanced models costing up to $1,000\u2014the Newton was\nalso ridiculed by talk show comedians and cartoonists because of the supposed inaccuracy of its\nhandwriting-recognition function. By 1998, the Newton was no more. A prime example of an idea that\nwas ahead of its time, the Newton was the forerunner to the smaller, cheaper, and more successful\nPalmPilot, which in turn paved the way for every successive mobile Internet device.\nEven less successful in the late 1990s was DIVX, an attempt by electronics retailer Circuit City to create an\nalternative to video rental. Customers could rent movies on disposable DIVX discs that they could keep\nand watch for 2 days. They then had the choice of throwing away or recycling the disc or paying a\ncontinuation fee to keep watching it. Viewers who wanted to watch a disc an unlimited amount of times\ncould pay to convert it into a \u201cDIVX silver\u201d disc for an additional fee. Launched in 1998, the DIVX system\nwas promoted as an alternative to traditional rental systems with the promise of no returns and no late\nfees. However, its introduction coincided with the release of DVD technology, which was gaining traction\nover the DIVX format. Consumers feared that the choice between DIVX and DVD might turn into another\nBetamax versus VHS debacle, and by 1999 the technology was all but obsolete. The failure of DIVX cost\nCircuit City a reported $114,000,000 and left early enthusiasts of the scheme with worthless DIVX\nequipment (although vendors offered a $100 refund for people who bought a DIVX player). [14]\nAnother catastrophic failure in the world of technology was Microsoft Bob, a mid-1990s attempt to\nprovide a new, nontechnical interface to desktop computing operations. Bob, represented by a logo with a\nyellow smiley face that filled the o in its name, was supposed to make Windows more palatable to\nnontechnical users. With a cartoon-like interface that was meant to resemble the inside of a house, Bob\nhelped users navigate their way around the desktop by having them click on objects in each room.\nMicrosoft expected sales of Bob to skyrocket and held a big advertising campaign to celebrate its 1995\nlaunch. Instead, the product failed dismally because of its high initial sale price, demanding hardware\nrequirements, and tendency to patronize users. When Windows 95 was launched the same year, its new\nWindows Explorer interface required far less dumbing down than previous versions, and Microsoft Bob\nbecame irrelevant.\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n755 Technological failures such as the Apple Newton, DIVX, and Microsoft Bob prove that sometimes it is\nbetter to be a mainstream adopter than to jump on the new-product bandwagon before the technology has\nbeen fully tried and tested.\nMass Media Outlets and New Technology\nAs new technology reaches the shelves and the number of early majority consumers rushing to purchase it\nincreases, mass media outlets are forced to adapt to the new medium. When the iPad\u2019s popularity\ncontinued to grow throughout 2010 (selling 3,000,000 units within 3 months of its launch date),\ntraditional newspapers, magazines, and television networks rushed to form partnerships with Apple,\nlaunching applications for the tablet so that consumers could directly access their content. Unconstrained\nby the limited amount of space available in a physical newspaper or magazine, publications such as The\nNew York Times and USA Today are able to include more detailed reporting than they can fit in their\ntraditional paper, as well as interactive features such as crossword puzzles and the use of video and sound.\n\u201cOur iPad App is designed to take full advantage of the evolving capabilities offered by the Internet,\u201d said\nArthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The New York Times. \u201cWe see our role on the iPad as being similar to\nour traditional print role\u2014to act as a thoughtful, unbiased filter and to provide our customers with\ninformation they need and can trust.\u201d [15]\nBecause of Apple\u2019s decision to ban Flash (the dominant software for online video viewing) from the iPad,\nsome traditional television networks have been converting their video files to HTML5 in order to enable\nfull television episodes to be screened on the device. CBS and Disney were among the first networks to\noffer free television content on the iPad in 2010 through the iPad\u2019s built-in web browser, while ABC\nstreamed its shows via an iPad application. The iPad has even managed to revive forms of traditional\nmedia that had been discontinued; in June 2010, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced the restoration\nof Gourmet magazine as an iPad application called Gourmet Live. As more media content becomes\navailable on new technology such as the iPad, the iPod, and the various e-readers available on the market,\nit appeals to a broader range of consumers, becoming a self-perpetuating model.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\uf0b7 The technology adoption life cycle offers a diffusion model of how people accept new ideas and new\ntechnology. The model recognizes five categories of participants: innovators, who tend to be\nexperimentalists and are interested in the technology itself; early adopters, who are technically\nSaylor URL: http://www.saylor.org/books Saylor.org\n756 sophisticated and are interested in using the technology for solving professional and academic problems;\nearly majority, who constitute the first part of the mainstream, bringing the new technology into common\nuse; late majority, who are less comfortable with the technology and may be skeptical about its benefits;\nand laggards, who are resistant to the new technology and may be critical of its use by others.\n\uf0b7 When new technology is released in the market, it follows the technology adoption life cycle. Innovators\nand early adopters want to be the first to own the technology and are unconcerned about the cost,\nwhereas mainstream consumers wait to find out how popular or successful the technology will become\nbefore buying it. As the technology filters into the mainstream, it becomes cheaper and more user-\nfriendly. Some people remain resistant to new technology, however, which helps to control its\ndevelopment. Technological flops such as Microsoft Bob and DIVX result from skeptical late adopters or\nlaggards refusing to purchase innovations that appear unlikely to become commercially successful.\n\uf0b7 As new technology transitions into the mainstream, traditional media outlets have to adapt to the new\ntechnology to reach consumers. Recent examples include the development of traditional media\napplications for the iPad, such as newspaper, magazine, and television network apps.\nEXERCISES\nChoose a technological innovation from the past 50 years and research its diffusion into the mass market.\nThen respond to the following short-answer questions. Each response should be a minimum of one\nparagraph.\n1. Does it fit the technology diffusion model?\n2. How quickly did the technology reach the mass market? In what ways did mass media aid the spread\nof this technology?\n3. Research similar inventions that never caught on. Why do you think this technology succeeded when\nso many others failed?\nEND-OF-CHAPTER ASSESSMENT\nReview Questions\n1) Questions for Section 16.1 \"Changes in Media Over the Last Century\"\n1.

One of the disadvantages of modern media delivery is the lack of reliability of information on the\nInternet. Do you think online journalism (including blogging) will ultimately become a respected source of\ninformation, or will people continue to rely on traditional news media?\n5. Will a pay-for-content model work for online newspapers and magazines, or have consumers become too\nused to receiving their news for free?\nCAREER CONNECTION\nAs a result of rapid change in the digital age, careers in media are constantly shifting, and many people\nwho work in the industry face an uncertain future.
