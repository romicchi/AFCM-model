{"text":"Language Acquisition\n\u2022 Language is extremely complex, yet children\nalready know most of the grammar of their native\nlanguage(s) before they are five years old\n\u2022 Children acquire language without being taught\nthe rules of grammar by their parents\n\u2013 In part because parents don\u2019t consciously know the\nmany of the rules of grammar \u2019 \u2019\nWhat s Learned, What s Not?\n\u2022 The innateness hypothesis asserts that\nchildren do not need to learn universal principles\nlike structure dependency because that is part of\nUG\n\u2013 They only have to learn the language-specific aspects\nof grammar\n\u2022 The innateness hypothesis provides an answer\nto Chomsky\u2019s question:\n\u2013 What accounts for the ease, rapidity, and uniformity of\nlanguage acquisition in the face of impoverished\ndata? \u2019 \u2019\nWhat s Learned, What s Not?\n\u2022 An argument for the innateness hypothesis is\nthe observation that we end up knowing more\nabout language than we hear around us\n\u2013 This argument is known as the poverty of the\nstimulus\n\u2013 Children are exposed to slips of the tongue, false\nstarts, ungrammatical and incomplete sentences\n\u2013 Also, children learn aspects of language about which\nthey receive no information\n\u2022 Such as structure dependent rules\n\u2022 The data the children is exposed to is impoverished \u2019 \u2019\nWhat s Learned, What s Not?\n\u2022 For example, children somehow know to invert\nthe auxiliary of the main clause when forming a\nquestion like:\n\u2022 Is the boy who is sleeping __ dreaming of a new car?\nRather than\n\u2022 *Is the boy __ sleeping is dreaming of a new car?\n\u2022 To do this, the child must somehow understand\nstructure dependency and constituent structure,\nsomething that adults do not consciously know Stages in Language Acquisition\n\u2022 Children acquire language in similar stages\nacross the world\n\u2022 When children are acquiring language, they do\nnot speak a degenerate form of adult language\n\u2013 Rather, they speak a version of the language that\nconforms to the set of grammatical rules they have\ndeveloped at that stage of acquisition The Perception and Production of\nSpeech Sounds\n\u2022 Infants display an ability to discriminate\nand recognize speech sounds\n\u2013 They will even respond to linguistic contrasts when\nthose contrasts are not present in the language(s)\nspoken around them\n\u2013 They can perceive differences in voicing, place of\narticulation, manner of articulation\n\u2013 But they do not react to nonlinguistic aspects of\nspeech (loudness, gender-based pitch differences,\netc.) The Perception and Production of\nSpeech Sounds\n\u2022 Infants appear to be born with the ability to\nperceive and focus on the sounds that are\nimportant for language, so they can learn\nany human language\n\u2013 But by 6 months babies begin to lose to ability\nto discriminate between sounds that are not\nphonemic in the language(s) they are\nacquiring Babbling\n\u2022 Babbling begins at about 6 months and is considered the\nearliest stage of language acquisition\n\u2013 Babies may babble phonemes that do not occur in the\nlanguage(s) they are acquiring\n\u2013 95% of babble is composed of the 12 most common consonants\naround the world\n\u2022 Early babbles mostly consist of CV sequences but become more\nvaried later on\n\u2022 By 1 year babbles are composed only of the phonemes used in the\nlanguage(s) they hear\n\u2013 Deaf babies babble with their hands like hearing babies babble\nusing sounds First Words\n\u2022 After the age of one, children figure out that\nsounds are related to meanings and start to\nproduce their first words\n\u2022 Usually children go through a holophrastic\nstage, where their one-word utterances may\nconvey more meaning\n\u2013 up used to indicate something in the sky or to mean\n\u201cpick me up\u201d\n\u2022 This suggests that children know more language\nthan they can express Segmenting the Speech Stream\n\u2022 A major obstacle that babies must overcome is to be\nable to identify where word boundaries are\n\u2022 English-speaking children may be able to use stress as a\ncue for word boundaries (prosodic bootstrapping)\n\u2013 Every content word in English has stress\n\u2022 If a word has two syllables, the stress either falls on the first syllable\n(trochaic stress) or the second syllable (iambic stress), but the\nvast majority of English words have trochaic stress\n\u2013 Experiments have shown that children do use stress as a cue for\nword boundaries since most English words have stress on the\nfirst syllable Segmenting the Speech Stream\n\u2022 But how do children know the stress pattern of the\nlanguage they are acquiring?\n\u2013 Babies may use statistical frequency of syllable sequences to\ndetermine word boundaries\n\u2022 In one experiment, babies were able to recognize the nonsense\nwords pabiku, tutibu, golabu, and babupu out of strings of nonsense\nsyllables because those strings of syllables in the \u2018words\u2019 occurred\nmore frequently than the random strings of syllables\n\u2022 Children may use statistical strategies to determine a few words,\nand from there may be able to determine the rhythmic, allophonic,\nand phonotactic properties of the language and then can determine\neven more words from this knowledge The Acquisition of Phonology\n\u2022 Children tend to acquire the sounds common to all\nlanguages first, followed by the less common sounds of\ntheir own language\n\u2022 Vowels tend to be acquired first, and consonants are\nordered:\n\u2013 Manner of articulation: nasals, glides, stops, liquids, fricatives,\naffricates\n\u2013 Place of articulation: labials, velars, alveolars, palatals\n\u2022 Uncommon but high frequency sounds may be acquired\nearlier than expected The Acquisition of Phonology\n\u2022 Children can perceive more sound contrasts than they\ncan make in early stages\n\u2013 Thus they know more about phonology than we can tell by\nlistening to them speak\n\u2022 When they cannot yet produce a sound, they may\nsubstitute an easier sound\n\u2013 These substitutions are rule-governed\n\u2013 Children tend to reduce consonant clusters ([pun] for spoon),\nreduplicate syllables ([wawa] for water), and drop final\nconsonants ([ke] for cake) The Acquisition of Word Meaning\n\u2022 When children learn the meanings of words they must learn the\nrelevant features of the class of things that are referred to by that\nword\n\u2013 They must learn that dog refers to pugs and Great Danes, but not cats\n\u2022 When learning words, children often overextend a word\u2019s meaning\n\u2013 For example, using the word dog to refer to any furry, four-legged\nanimal (overextensions tend to be based on shape, size, or texture, but\nnever color)\n\u2022 They may also underextend a word\u2019s meaning\n\u2013 For example, using the word dog to refer only to the family pet, as if dog\nwere a proper noun The Acquisition of Word Meaning\n\u2022 The whole object principle: when a child learns a\nnew word, (s)he is likely to interpret the word to\nrefer to a whole object rather than one of its\nparts\n\u2013 This principle and others may help the child learn\n5,000 words per year\n\u2022 It has also been put forth that children can learn\nthe meaning of verbs based on the syntactic\nenvironments of the verbs\n\u2013 This is known as syntactic bootstrapping The Acquisition of Morphology\n\u2022 The acquisition of morphology clearly demonstrates the\nrule-governed nature of language acquisition\n\u2013 Children typically learn a morphological rule and then\novergeneralize\n\u2013 Children go through three stages in the acquisition of an irregular\nform:\n\u2022 In phase 1 they use the standard irregular past tense forms\nbecause they have learned these irregulars as separate lexical\nitems (broke, brought)\n\u2022 In phase 2 the child has learned the rule for past tense and\ntherefore attaches the regular past tense morpheme to the irregular\nverb (breaked, bringed)\n\u2022 In phase 3 the child realizes that there are exceptions to the\nmorphological rule and bring the standard irregular forms back into\ntheir vocabulary (broke, brought) The Acquisition of Morphology\n\u2022 The \u201cwug test\u201d demonstrates that children apply the\ncorrect plural allomorph to nouns they have never heard\nbefore\n\u2013 Which shows they have an understanding of natural classes of\nphonemes and are not just imitating words they have heard\nbefore\n\u2022 Children acquiring languages other than English learn\nsubject-verb agreement very early\n\u2022 Children also demonstrate their knowledge of\nderivational rules and can create new words\n\u2013 E.g. broomed (\u201cswept\u201d) The Acquisition of Syntax\n\u2022 At about two years of age, children start to put\nwords together to form two-word utterances\n\u2013 The intonation contour extends over the two words as\na unit, and the two-word utterances can convey a\nrange of meanings:\n\u2022 mommy sock = subject + object or possessive\n\u2022 Chronological age is not a good measure of\nlinguistic development due to individual\ndifferences, so instead linguists use the child\u2019s\nmean length of utterance (MLU) to measure\ndevelopment The Acquisition of Syntax\n\u2022 The telegraphic stage describes a phase when\nchildren tend to omit function morphemes such\nas articles, subject pronouns, auxiliaries, and\nverbal inflection\n\u2013 For example: He play little tune or Andrew want that\n\u2022 However, while function morphemes are absent,\nthese sentences have hierarchical constituent\nstructure like adult sentences\n\u2013 Telegraphic utterances are not just words strung\ntogether and reveal the child\u2019s knowledge of syntactic\nrules The Acquisition of Syntax The Acquisition of Syntax\n\u2022 A child must know the syntactic categories of words\nin order to apply syntactic rules\n\u2013 Semantic bootstrapping: the notion that children first use\nthe meaning of a word to figure out its syntactic category\n\u2013 Word frames may also help children determine the\nsyntactic categories for words\n\u2022 Some frames such as you__it and the___one occur frequently\nenough that kids may be able to identify which words can occur\nin each frame (verbs for the former and adjectives for the latter) The Acquisition of Syntax\n\u2022 Between 2;6 and 3;6 a language explosion occurs and\nchildren undergo rapid development\n\u2013 By the age of 3, most children consistently use function\nmorphemes and can produce complex syntactic structures:\n\u2022 He was stuck and I got him out\n\u2022 It\u2019s too early for us to eat\n\u2022 After 3;6 children can produce wh-questions, and relative\npronouns\n\u2022 Sometime after 4;0 children have acquired most of the\nadult syntactic competence Acquisi\u2019on of movement What do you think what is in that\nbox The Acquisition of Pragmatics\n\u2022 Deixis:\n\u2013 Children often have problems with the shifting\nreference of pronouns\n\u2022 Children may refer to themselves as \u2018you\u2019\n\u2013 Problems with the context-dependent nature\nof deictic words\n\u2022 Children often assume the hearer knows who she\nis talking about The Development of Auxiliaries:\nA Case Study\n\u2022 In the telegraphic stage children often omit\nauxiliaries from their speech but can form\nquestions (with rising intonation) and negative\nsentences\n\u2013 I ride train? I not like this book\n\u2022 As children acquire auxiliaries in questions and\nnegative sentences, they generally use them\ncorrectly\n\u2013 The child always places the negation in the correct\nposition in relation to the auxiliary Setting Parameters\n\u2022 Children acquire the parameters of UG very\nearly\n\u2013 The child listens to the language around her and then\nchooses between the options provided to her by UG\n\u2022 Does this language have the head or the complement come\nfirst?\n\u2022 Are VPs in this language ordered VO or OV?\n\u2022 Does this language allow verb movement?\n\u2013 Parameters greatly reduce the difficulty of acquiring a\nlanguage because, rather than starting from scratch,\na child only needs to choose between a small set of\nlinguistic options based on what she hears Parameters\n\u2022 X\u02b9\u2032 theory says structures are all built hierarchically\nlike this\u2014but different languages can choose\ndifferent orders.\nXP\nSpecifier X\u02b9\u2032\nX Complement\nHead The Acquisition of Signed Languages\n\u2022 Deaf babies acquire sign language in the same\nway that hearing babies acquire spoken\nlanguage:\n\u2013 babbling, holophrastic stage, telegraphic stage\n\u2022 When deaf babies are not exposed to sign\nlanguage, they will create their own signs,\ncomplete with systematic rules\n\u2013 This demonstrates the drive humans have to\ncommunicate, and also the innate basis for language\nsince these children create a rudimentary language\nwithout any input The Role of Imitation, Reinforcement,\nand Analogy\n\u2022 Children do imitate the speech heard around them to a\ncertain extent, but language acquisition goes beyond\nimitation\n\u2013 Children produce utterances that they never hear from adults\naround them, such as holded or tooths\n\u2013 Children cannot imitate adults fully while acquiring grammar\n\u2022 Adult: Where can I put them?\n\u2022 Child: Where I can put them?\n\u2013 Children who develop the ability to speak later in their childhood\ncan understand the language spoken around them even if they\ncannot imitate it The Role of Imitation, Reinforcement,\nand Analogy\n\u2022 Another theory posits that children learn through\npositive and negative reinforcement\n\u2013 But, parents rarely correct their children\u2019s speech,\nand when they do they correct based on\npronunciation and factual accuracy rather than\ngrammatical accuracy\n\u2013 Parents do sometimes recast children\u2019s utterances,\nbut not consistently, and they also tend to recast\ngrammatical sentences to reinforce correct content Children resist correc\u2019on\nCazden (1972) (observa\u2019on aIributed to Jean Berko Gleason)\n\u2013 My teacher holded the baby rabbits and we paIed them.\n\u2013 Did you say your teacher held the baby rabbits?\n\u2013 Yes.\n\u2013 What did you say she did?\n\u2013 She holded the baby rabbits and we paIed them.\n\u2013 Did you say she held them \u2019ghtly?\n\u2013 No, she holded them loosely. The Role of Imitation, Reinforcement,\nand Analogy\n\u2022 Another theory asserts that children hear a sentence and\nthen use it as a model to form other sentences by analogy\n\u2013 But while analogy may work in some situations, but certainly not in\nall situations:\n\u2022 I painted a red barn.\n\u2022 I painted a barn red.\n\u2022 I saw a red barn.\n\u2022 *I saw a barn red.\n\u2013 Children never make mistakes of this kind based on analogy\nwhich shows that they understand structure dependency at a very\nyoung age The Role of Structured Input\n\u2022 It has also been suggested that children are able\nto learn language because adults speak to them\nin a simplified version of language known as\nmotherese, child-directed speech (CDS), or\nbaby talk\n\u2013 But, motherese is not syntactically simple and does\nnot drop verb inflections or omit function words\n\u2013 In many cultures adults do not engage in motherese,\nyet children in those cultures acquire language in the\nsame way as children who are exposed to motherese Childhood Bilingualism\n\u2022 Bilingual language acquisition, or\nsimultaneous bilingualism refers to the\nacquisition of two languages\nsimultaneously from infancy\n\u2013 About half the people in the world are bilingual\nor multilingual\n\u2013 In many parts of the world, bilingualism (or\nmultilingualism) is the norm Theories of Bilingual Development\n\u2022 Unitary system hypothesis: the idea that the\nchild initially constructs only one lexicon and one\ngrammar\n\u2022 Evidence for: language mixing similar to codeswitching;\nlexical items existing in only one language\n\u2022 Evidence against: there is a lot of overlap in the lexicon for\neach language, and children may have gaps because each\nlanguage is used in different contexts and they can only learn\nso many words each day Theories of Bilingual Development\n\u2022 Separate systems hypothesis: the idea that\nthe child builds a distinct lexicon and grammar\nfor each language\n\u2013 Evidence for:\n\u2022 where the two languages diverge grammatically, the child will\nacquire two different sets of rules\n\u2022 bilingual children select which language to use based on the\ncontext\n\u2022 children bilingual in sign language and a spoken language\nmay say a word in one language and sign it in the other\nsimultaneously The Role of Input & Cognitive Effects of\nBilingualism\n\u2022 It\u2019s unclear how much input in each language a\nchild needs to become bilingual\n\u2013 Une personne-une langue (one person, one\nlanguage) is the strategy where one parent speaks\nonly language A to the child and the other speaks only\nlanguage B\n\u2022 Bilingual children tend to have better\nmetalinguistic awareness than monolingual\nspeakers, meaning they have more conscious\nknowledge about language Second Language Acquisition\n\u2022 Most adult language learners never become fully\nproficient in their second language\n\u2013 They make errors unlike children\u2019s errors and these\nerrors may become fossilized\n\u2022 Fundamental difference hypothesis: learning\na second language is a different process than\nlearning a first language\n\u2013 Different principles are drawn upon in L2 learning\nthan L1 acquisition\n\u2013 However, L2 learners do demonstrate rule-governed\ninterlanguage grammars Second Language Acquisition\n\u2022 One obvious difference between L1 and L2\nacquisition is that in L2 acquisition a speaker\nalready knows a language\n\u2013 Learners often transfer phonological, syntactic, and\nmorphological rules from their first language to their\nsecond language\n\u2022 French speakers learning English may substitute [z] for [\ue000\ue001\ue002\ue003\ue004\ue005\ue006\ue007\ue008\ue009\ue00a\ue00b\ue00c\ue00d\ue00e\ue00f\ue010\ue011\ue012\ue013\ue014\ue015\ue016\ue017\ue018\ue019\ue01a\ue01b\ue01c\ue01d\ue01e\ue01f\ue020\ue021\ue022\ue023\ue024\ue025\ue026\ue027\ue028\ue029\ue02a\ue02b\ue02c\ue02d\ue02e\ue02f\ue030\ue031\ue032\ue033\ue034\ue035\ue036\ue037\ue038\ue039\ue03a\ue03b\ue03c\ue03d\ue03e\ue03f\ue040\ue041\ue042\ue043\ue044\ue045\ue046\ue047\ue048\ue049\ue04a\ue04b\ue04c\ue04d\ue04e\ue04f\ue050\ue051\ue052\ue053\ue054\ue055\ue056\ue057\ue058\ue059\ue05a\ue05b\ue05c\ue05d\ue05e\ue05f\ue060\ue061\ue062\ue063\ue064\ue065\ue066\ue067\ue068\ue069\ue06a\ue06b\ue06c\ue06d\ue06e\ue06f\ue070\ue071\ue072\ue073\ue074\ue075\ue076\ue077\ue078\ue079\ue07a\ue07b\ue07c\ue07d\ue07e\ue07f\ue080\ue081\ue082\ue083\ue084\ue085\ue086\ue087\ue088\ue089\ue08a\ue08b\ue08c\ue08d\ue08e\ue08f\ue090\ue091\ue092\ue093\ue094\ue095\ue096\ue097\ue098\ue099\ue09a\ue09b\ue09c\ue09d\ue09e\ue09f\ue0a0\ue0a1\ue0a2\ue0a3\ue0a4\ue0a5\ue0a6\ue0a7\ue0a8\ue0a9\ue0aa\ue0ab\ue0ac\ue0ad\ue0ae\ue0af\ue0b0\ue0b1\ue0b2\ue0b3\ue0b4\ue0b5\ue0b6\ue0b7\ue0b8\ue0b9\ue0ba\ue0bb\ue0bc\ue0bd\ue0be\ue0bf\ue0c0\ue0c1\ue0c2\ue0c3\ue0c4\ue0c5\ue0c6\ue0c7\ue0c8\ue0c9\ue0ca\ue0cb\ue0cc\ue0cd\ue0ce\ue0cf\ue0d0\ue0d1\ue0d2\ue0d3\ue0d4\ue0d5\ue0d6\ue0d7\ue0d8\ue0d9\ue0da\ue0db\ue0dc\ue0dd\ue0de\ue0df\ue0e0\ue0e1\ue0e2\ue0e3\ue0e4\ue0e5\ue0e6\ue0e7\ue0e8\ue0e9\ue0ea\ue0eb\ue0ec\ue0ed\ue0ee\ue0ef\ue0f0\ue0f1\ue0f2\ue0f3\ue0f4\ue0f5\ue0f6\ue0f7\ue0f8\ue0f9\ue0fa\ue0fb\ue0fc\ue0fd\ue0fe\ue0ff]\n\u2022 Spanish speakers learning English may insert a schwa to\nbreak up word-initial consonant clusters Second Language Acquisition\n\u2022 But, not everything transfers from the L1 to the\nL2, and many errors made by learners are not\nfound in their L1\n\u2022 Speakers with different L1s go through similar\nstages when learning their L2s\n\u2013 Which points to some possibly universal\ndevelopmental principles like those in L1 acquisition Heritage Language Learners\n\u2022 Heritage language learners constitute a\nunique type of adult language learner\n\u2013 Someone who was raised with a strong\ncultural connection to a language and who\nthen chooses to study that language more\nformally\n\u2022 May have no prior linguistic knowledge of the\nlanguage\n\u2022 May be bilingual Is There a Critical Period for L2\nAcquisition?\n\u2022 Most researchers would not claim that it is\nimpossible to acquire a new language after a\ncertain age\n\u2013 But it does get harder as one gets older\n\u2013 There may be \u201csensitive\u201d (rather than critical) periods\nfor acquiring certain aspects of an L2\n\u2022 The sensitive period for phonology is the smallest\u2014it is very\ndifficult to acquire an L2 without an accent after the childhood\nyears; other aspects of language have a larger window "}
