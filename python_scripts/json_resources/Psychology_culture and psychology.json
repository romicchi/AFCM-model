This situation prompted us to begin\ndrafting this textbook and other open source course materials.\nThis textbook reflects the disciplinary expertise of the three\nmain authors, who are all counselors and psychologists. We\nrecognize this as both a strength and weakness of the text, as\nit provides a strong psychological approach but does not cover\nthe entire range of work in the field. The guiding perspective\nof this work is an awareness that social and cultural factors\ninfluence our thinking and behavior but individual differences\noften direct our decision making and choices.\nWe hope this resource will be useful to anyone who is\ninterested in the role that culture plays in shaping who we are\nand how we as individuals in turn shape our culture.\nSenior Contributing Authors\nLisa Worthy\nTrisha Lavigne\nFernando Romero\nAcknowledgements | 1 About This Book\nCopyright 2020 Lisa Worthy, Trisha Lavigne, and Fernando\nRomero; this book was updated July 2022 to include learning\nobjectives, additional images, some sections were rearranged\nand combined to improve flow and organization.\nGlendale Community College part of Maricopa County\nCommunity College District (MCCCD) Maricopa Millions,\nPhoenix AZ\nAttributions\nThis work is licensed under CC BY SA NC ND 4.0\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nLicense\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nCover Art\nCover Art Mural in Rio de Janiero by Stefano Ravalli CC BY SA\nNC 2.0 https://www.flickr.com/photos/stefano60/30290762124\n2 | About This Book PART I\nCULTURE AND\nPSYCHOLOGY\nCulture goes beyond the way people dress and the food they eat.

Broadly speaking, psychology is the science of\nbehavior and mind, including conscious and unconscious\nphenomena, as well as feeling and thought. Psychologists,\npractitioners or researchers in the field, explore the role that\ncognitive processes (thinking) has on individual and social\nbehavior. Psychologists also explore the physiological and\nbiological processes (e.g., neurotransmitters, brain, and\nnervous system) that underlie the thinking and behavior of\nindividuals.\nThere are four main goals of psychology:\nDescribe\nPsychologists describe the behavior of humans and other\nanimals in order to improve our understanding of the behavior\nand get a sense of what can be considered normal and\nIntroduction to Psychology | 5 abnormal. Psychological researchers use many different\nmethods to help describe behavior including naturalistic\nobservation, case studies, and surveys. After describing\nbehavior, it is easier for psychologists to understand and\nexplain the behavior.\nExplain\nThis goal involves determining the causes of behavior.\nPsychologists try to understand why a person acts or reacts in\na certain way and then they try to identify if there are other\nfactors that may produce the behavior (e.g., something that\nhappens before or after a behavior). Using experimental\ndesigns, psychologists establish theories which will help\nexplain the same behavior in different situations and contexts.\nPredict\nThe third goal of psychology is to predict what behavior will\ncome next, how a person will behave or when will the behavior\nhappen in the future. Predicting behavior is hard, unless the\nbehavior has already been studied which is why describing and\nexplaining behavior must happen first. A psychologist may be\nable to predict a behavior by looking for a pattern using past\ninstances or examples of that behavior. Predicting behaviors\nis essential for psychologists if they want to change or modify\nharmful or dysfunctional behaviors or to promote or encourage\npositive or prosocial behaviors among individuals.\nControl\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, psychology strives to\n6 | Introduction to Psychology change, influence, or control behavior to make positive and\nlasting changes in people\u2019s lives. It is important to note that\nif a psychologist tries to influence, shape, modify or control\nsomeone\u2019s behavior without asking permission or getting\nconsent it is considered unethical. As noted earlier, the\nultimate goal of psychology is to benefit individuals and society\nbut we do this by respecting the rights of others.\nPsychology is a hub science which means it is a\ndiscipline that uses scientific research and is cited by\nscientists in many other fields. [Image by Alex Vlasenko\nShape of Science CC BY-SA 4.0 from Wikimedia\nCommons]\nPsychology has been described as a \u201chub science\u201d which\nmeans that medicine tends to draw upon psychological\nresearch mainly through the fields of neurology and psychiatry.\nSocial sciences commonly draw directly from sub-disciplines\nwithin psychology like social psychology and developmental\npsychology. The field of psychology is about understanding\nIntroduction to Psychology | 7 and solving problems in several areas of human activity and as\na discipline psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.\n8 | Introduction to Psychology Cultural WEIRDos\nDespite its ultimate aim to benefit society, the psychological\naspects of culture have historically been overlooked because\nmany elements of culture cannot be observed. For example,\nthe way that gender roles are learned is a cultural process, as\nis the way that people think about their own sense of duty\ntoward their family members. Also, there has been an\noverrepresentation of research conducted using human\nsubjects from Western, educated, industrialized, rich and\ndemocratic nations (WEIRD). Findings from psychology\nresearch utilizing primarily W.E.I.R.D. populations are often\nlabeled as universal theories that explain psychological\nphenomena but are inaccurately, and inappropriately, applied\nto other cultures.\nCultural WEIRDos | 9 How confident can we be that the results of social\npsychology studies generalize to the wider population if\nstudy participants are largely of the WEIRD variety?\n[Image: Mike Miley, http://goo.gl/NtvlU8, CC BY-SA 2.0]\nRecent research findings revealing that cultures differ in many\nareas, such as logical reasoning and social values has become\nincreasingly difficult to ignore. For example, many studies have\nshown that Americans, Canadians and western Europeans rely\non analytical reasoning strategies, which separate objects from\ntheir contexts to explain and predict behavior. Social\npsychologists refer to the fundamental attribution error or the\ntendency to explain people\u2019s behavior in terms of internal,\ninherent personality traits rather than external, situational\nconsiderations (e.g. attributing an instance of angry behavior\nto an angry personality). Outside W.E.I.R.D. cultures, however,\nthis phenomenon is less prominent, as many non-W.E.I.R.D.\npopulations tend to pay more attention to the context in which\n10 | Cultural WEIRDos behavior occurs. Asians tend to reason holistically, for example\nby considering people\u2019s behavior in terms of their situation;\nsomeone\u2019s anger might be viewed as simply a result of an\nirritating day (Jones, 2010; Nisbet et al., 2005). Yet many long-\nstanding theories of how humans think rely on the prominence\nof analytical thought (Heinrich, 2010).\nBy studying only W.E.I.R.D. populations, psychologists fail to\naccount for a substantial amount of diversity of the global\npopulation. Applying the findings from W.E.I.R.D. populations\nto other populations can lead to a miscalculation of\npsychological theories and may hinder psychologists\u2019 abilities\nto isolate fundamental cultural characteristics.\nA major goal of cultural psychology is to have many and\nvaried cultures contribute to basic psychological theories in\norder to correct these theories so that they become more\nrelevant to the predictions, descriptions, and explanations of\nall human behaviors, not just Western ones (Shweder & Levine,\n1984).\nCultural WEIRDos | 11 Introduction to\nCultural Psychology\nCultural psychology is an interdisciplinary study of how culture\nreflects and shapes the mind and behavior of its members\n(Heine, 2011). The main position of cultural psychology is that\nmind and culture are inseparable, meaning that people are\nshaped by their culture and their culture is also shaped by\nthem (Fiske, Kitayama, Markus, & Nisbett, 1998). Shweder (1991)\nexpanded, \u201cCultural psychology is the study of the way cultural\ntraditions and social practices regulate, express, and transform\nthe human psyche, resulting less in psychic unity for\nhumankind than in ethnic divergences in mind, self, and\nemotion.\u201d Incorporating a cultural perspective in psychological\nresearch helps to ensure that the knowledge we learn is more\naccurate and descriptive of all people.\nThe four goals of psychology can also be effectively applied to\nstudy cultural psychology by describing, explaining, predicting,\nand controlling (influencing) behavior across cultures. Cultural\npsychology research informs several fields within psychology,\nincluding social psychology, developmental psychology, and\ncognitive psychology.\nCultural psychology is often confused with cross-cultural\npsychology but they are not the same thing. Cross-cultural\npsychology uses culture to test the universality of\npsychological processes rather than for determining how\ncultural practices shape psychological processes. For example,\na cross-cultural psychologist would ask whether Jean Piaget\u2019s\nstages of development (e.g., sensorimotor, preoperational,\nconcrete operational, and formal operational) are universal\n(the same) across all cultures. A cultural psychologist would ask\nhow the social practices of a particular set of cultures shape the\n12 | Introduction to Cultural\nPsychology development of cognitive processes in different ways (Markus\n& Kitayama, 2003).\nDespite its contributions to the field of psychology, there\nhave been criticisms of cultural psychology including cultural\nstereotyping and methodological issues. There has been an\nabundance of research that explores the cultural differences\nbetween East Asians and North Americans in areas of cognitive\npsychology (e.g., attention, perception, cognition) and social\npsychology (e.g., self and identity). Some psychologists have\nargued that this research is based on cultural stereotyping\n(Turiel, 2002) and minimizes the role of the individual (McNulty,\n2004).\nAdditionally, self-report data is one of the easiest, least\nexpensive and most accessible methods for mass data\ncollection, especially when conducting research in cultural\npsychology (Kitayama, et al., 2002; Masuda & Nisbett, 2001).\nRelying on self-report data for cross-cultural comparisons of\nattitudes and values can lead to relatively unstable and\nultimately misleading data and interpretations. We discuss this\nin greater detail in Chapter 3.\nIntroduction to Cultural Psychology | 13 Defining Culture\nWe have spent a lot of time talking about culture without really\ndefining it and to complicate matters more, there are many\ndefinitions of culture and it is used in different ways by different\npeople. When someone says, \u201cMy company has a competitive\nculture,\u201d does it mean the same thing as when another person\nsays, \u201cI\u2019m taking my children to the museum so they can get\nsome culture\u201d? For purposes of this module we are going to\ndefine culture as patterns of learned and shared behavior that\nare cumulative and transmitted across generations.\nPatterns: There are systematic and predictable ways of\nbehavior or thinking across members of a culture. Patterns\nemerge from adapting, sharing, and storing cultural\ninformation. Patterns can be both similar and different across\ncultures. For example, in both Canada and India it is considered\npolite to bring a small gift to a host\u2019s home. In Canada, it is more\ncommon to bring a bottle of wine and for the gift to be opened\nright away. In India, by contrast, it is more common to bring\nsweets, and often the gift is set aside to be opened later.\nSharing: Culture is the product of people sharing with one\nanother. Humans cooperate and share knowledge and skills\nwith other members of their networks. The ways they share,\nand the content of what they share, helps make up culture.\nOlder adults, for instance, remember a time when long-\ndistance friendships were maintained through letters that\narrived in the mail every few months. Contemporary youth\nculture accomplishes the same goal through the use of instant\ntext messages on smartphones.\nLearned: Behaviors, values, norms are acquired through a\nprocess known as enculturation that begins with parents and\ncaregivers, because they are the primary influence on young\nchildren. Caregivers teach kids, both directly and by example,\n14 | Defining Culture about how to behave and how the world works. They\nencourage children to be polite, reminding them, for instance,\nto say \u201cThank you.\u201d They teach kids how to dress in a way that is\nappropriate for the culture.\nCulture teaches us what behaviors and emotions are\nappropriate or expected in different situations. In some\nsocieties, it is considered appropriate to conceal anger. Instead\nof expressing their feelings outright, people purse their lips,\nfurrow their brows, and say little. In other cultures, however, it is\nappropriate to express anger. In these places, people are more\nlikely to bare their teeth, furrow their brows, point or gesture,\nand yell (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Chung, 2010).\nCulture teaches us what behaviors and emotions are\nappropriate or expected in different situations. [Image:\nPortal de Copa, https://goo.gl/iEoW6X, CC BY 3.0]\nMembers of a culture also engage in rituals which are used\nto teach people what is important. For example, young people\nwho are interested in becoming Buddhist monks often have\nto endure rituals that help them shed feelings of specialness\nor superiority\u2014feelings that run counter to Buddhist doctrine.\nDefining Culture | 15 To do this, they might be required to wash their teacher\u2019s feet,\nscrub toilets, or perform other menial tasks. Similarly, many\nJewish adolescents go through the process of bar and bat\nmitzvah. This is a ceremonial reading from scripture that\nrequires the study of Hebrew and, when completed, signals\nthat the youth is ready for full participation in public worship.\nThese examples help to illustrate the concept of enculturation.\nCumulative: Cultural knowledge is information that is\n\u201cstored\u201d and then the learning grows across generations. We\nunderstand more about the world today than we did 200 years\nago, but that doesn\u2019t mean the culture from long ago has\nbeen erased. For instance, members of the Haida culture, a\nFirst Nations people in British Columbia, Canada are able to\nprofit from both ancient and modern experiences. They might\nemploy traditional fishing practices and wisdom stories while\nalso using modern technologies and services.\nTransmission: Passing of new knowledge and traditions of\nculture from one generation to the next, as well as across other\ncultures is cultural transmission. In everyday life, the most\ncommon way cultural norms are transmitted is within each\nindividuals\u2019 home life. Each family has its own, distinct culture\nunder the big picture of each given society and/or nation. With\nevery family, there are traditions that are kept alive. The way\neach family acts and communicates with others and an overall\nview of life are passed down. Parents teach their kids every day\nhow to behave and act by their actions alone. Outside of the\nfamily, culture can be transmitted at various social institutions\nlike places of worship, schools, even shopping centers are\nplaces where enculturation happens and is transmitted.\nUnderstanding culture as a learned pattern of thoughts and\nbehaviors is interesting for several reasons. First, it highlights\nthe ways groups can come into conflict with one another.\nMembers of different cultures simply learn different ways of\nbehaving. Teenagers today interact with technologies, like a\nsmartphone, using a different set of rules than people who\n16 | Defining Culture are in their 40s, 50s, or 60s. Older adults might find texting in\nthe middle of a face-to-face conversation rude while younger\npeople often do not.\nThese differences can sometimes become politicized and a\nsource of tension between groups. One example of this is\nMuslim women who wear a hijab, or headscarf. Non-Muslims\ndo not follow this practice, so occasional misunderstandings\narise about the appropriateness of the tradition. Second,\nunderstanding that culture is learned is important because\nit means that people can adopt an appreciation of patterns\nof behavior that are different than their own. Finally,\nunderstanding that culture is learned can be helpful in\ndeveloping self-awareness. For instance, people from the\nUnited States might not even be aware of the fact that their\nattitudes about public nudity are influenced by their cultural\nlearning. While women often go topless on beaches in Europe\nand women living a traditional tribal existence in places like the\nSouth Pacific also go topless, it is illegal for women in some of\nthe United States to do so.\nDefining Culture | 17 Australian swimmer Annette\nKellermann was arrested in the\nUnited States for indecency in 1907\nfor wearing a one piece swimsuit in\npublic. [Image in the Public\nDomain https://en.wikipedia.org/\nwiki/Annette_Kellermann]\nThese cultural norms for modesty that are reflected in\ngovernment laws and policies also enter the discourse on social\nissues such as the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public.\nUnderstanding that your preferences are, in many cases, the\nproducts of cultural learning might empower you to revise\nthem if doing so will lead to a better life for you or others.\nHumans use culture to adapt and transform the world they\nlive in and you should think of the word culture as a conceptual\ntool rather than as a uniform, static definition. Culture changes\nthrough interactions with individuals, media, and technology,\njust to name a few. Culture generally changes for one of two\n18 | Defining Culture reasons: selective transmission or to meet changing needs. This\nmeans that when a village or culture is met with new\nchallenges, for example, a loss of a food source, they must\nchange the way they live. It could also include forced relocation\nfrom ancestral domains due to external or internal forces. For\nexample, in the United States tens of thousands Native\nAmericans were forced to migrate from their ancestral lands to\nreservations established by the United States government so\nit could acquire lands rich with natural resources. The forced\nmigration resulted in death, disease and many cultural\nchanges for the Native Americans as they adjusted to new\necology and way of life.\nDefining Culture | 19 1. Two Views of Culture\nAn etic perspective refers to a psychological construct or\nprocess that is universal, or true across all cultures. An etic\nperspective is closely associated with cross-cultural psychology.\nRemember our earlier example of child development and\nPiaget, an etic perspective seeks to compare development\nstages across cultures for similarities.\nThere are two main perspectives about culture; global\nor universal (etic) or seen as culturally specific (etic).\n[Image https://flic.kr/p/p4fJ26]\nCultural universals are psychological processes that exist in\nevery human culture and includes attributes such as values\nand modes of behavior. These are often the areas of focus and\nstudy in psychology. Some examples of cultural universals in\npsychology are:\n\u2022 Language and cognition\n\u2022 Group membership\n\u2022 Ritual\n\u2022 Emotions\nThe idea that specific aspects of culture are common to all\nhuman cultures is contrary to the emic perspective which\n20 | Two Views of Culture focuses on cultural differences and culturally specific processes\nthat shape thinking and behavior. Research using an emic\nperspective is often considered to be an \u2018insider\u2019s\u2019 perspective\nbut can be biased if the participant or researcher is a member\nof the culture they are studying. A participant-researcher may\nfail to consider how the culture and cultural practices might be\nperceived by others and valuable information might be left out.\nProducts of Culture\nIn cultural psychology, material culture refers to the objects\nor belongings of a group including food, fashion, architecture\nor physical structures. These objects reflect the historical,\ngeographic, and social conditions of the culture. For instance,\nthe clothes that you are wearing right now might tell\nresearchers of the future about the fashions of today.\nArchitecture and physical structures are types of material culture.\nThese Nubian pyramids in Meroe are reconstructed but the original\npyramids can be seen in the background [Image by Wufei07 from\nWikimedia Commons https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_pyramids]\nPublic Domain\nTwo Views of Culture | 21 Nonmaterial culture (subjective), by contrast, consists of the\nideas, attitudes, and beliefs of a society.\nNorms are things that are considered normal, appropriate, or\nordinary for a particular group of people and guide members\non how they should behave in a given context. In Western\ncultures wearing dark clothing and appearing solemn are\nnormative behaviors at a funeral. In certain cultures, they\nreflect the values of respect and support of friends and family.\nValues are related to the norms of a culture, but they are\nmore global and abstract than norms. Norms are rules for\nbehavior in specific situations, while values identify what\nshould be judged as good or evil. Flying the national flag on a\nholiday is a norm, but it exhibits patriotism, which is a value.\nBeliefs are the way people think the universe operates.\nBeliefs can be religious or secular, and they can refer to any\naspect of life. For instance, many people in the United States\nbelieve that hard work is the key to success, while in other\ncountries your success is determined by fate.\nNorms, values, and beliefs are all deeply interconnected.\nTogether, they provide a way to understand culture.\n22 | Two Views of Culture Hofstede's Cultural\nDimensions\nHofstede\u2019s cultural values provide a framework that describes\nthe effects of culture on the values of its members, and how\nthese values relate to behavior. Hofstede\u2019s work is a major\nresource in fields like cross-cultural psychology, international\nmanagement, and cross-cultural communication.\nHofstede conducted a large survey (1967-1973) that examined\nvalue differences across the divisions of IBM, a multinational\ncorporation. Data were collected from 117,000 employees from\n50 countries across 3 regions. Using factor analysis, a statistical\nmethod, Hofstede initially identified four value dimensions\n(Individualist/Collectivist, Power Distance, Uncertainty\nAvoidance, and Masculinity/Femininity). Additional research\nthat used a Chinese developed tool identified a fifth\ndimension: Long Term/Short Term orientation (Bond, 1991) and\na replication, conducted across 93 separate countries,\nconfirmed the existence of the five dimensions and identified\na sixth known as Indulgence/Restraint (Minkov, 2010). The five\nvalues are discussed in detail below.\nMasculinity and Femininity (task orientation/person\norientation) refers to the distribution of emotional roles\nbetween the genders. Masculine cultures value\ncompetitiveness, assertiveness, material success, ambition, and\npower. Female cultures place more value on relationships,\nquality of life and greater concern for marginalized groups (e.g.,\nhomeless, persons with disabilities, refugees). In masculine\ncultures differences in gender roles are very dramatic and\nmuch less fluid than those in feminine cultures where women\nand men have the same values that emphasize modesty and\ncaring. Masculine cultures are also more likely to have strong\nHofstede's Cultural\nDimensions | 23 opinions about what constitutes men\u2019s work versus women\u2019s\nwork, while societies low in masculinity permit much greater\noverlap in social and work roles of men and women.\nFigure 1. Countries that score high on masculinity are task oriented,\nwhereas countries that score higher on femininity are person\noriented.\nUncertainty Avoidance (UA) addresses a society\u2019s tolerance\nfor uncertainty and ambiguity. It reflects the extent to which\nmembers of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by\nminimizing uncertainty. Another, more simplified, way to think\nabout UA is how threatening change is to a culture. People\nin cultures with high UA tend to be more emotional, try to\nminimize the unknown and unusual circumstances and\nproceed with carefully planned steps and rules, laws and\nregulations. Low UA cultures accept and feel comfortable in\nunstructured situations or changeable environments and try\nto have as few rules as possible. People in these cultures tend\nto be more tolerant of change. Students from countries with\nlow uncertainty avoidance don\u2019t mind it when a teacher says, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d\n24 | Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Figure 2. The Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) scale reflects the extent to\nwhich members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety and fear by\nminimizing uncertainty.\nPower Distance (strength of social hierarchy) refers to the\nextent to which the less powerful members of organizations\nand institutions (like a family) accept and expect that power is\ndistributed unequally. There is a certain degree of inequality in\nall societies, notes Hofstede; however, there is relatively more\nequality in some societies than in others. Individuals in\nsocieties that exhibit a high degree of power distance accept\nhierarchies to which everyone has a place without the need for\njustification. Societies with low power distance seek to have an\nequal distribution of power. Cultures that endorse low power\ndistance expect and accept relations that are more\nconsultative or democratic \u2013 we call this egalitarian.\nCountries with lower PDI values tend to be more egalitarian.\nFor instance, there is more equality between parents and\nchildren with parents more likely to accept it if children argue\nwith them, or \u201ctalk back\u201d to use a common expression. In the\nworkplace, bosses are more likely to ask employees for input,\nHofstede's Cultural Dimensions | 25 and in fact, subordinates expect to be consulted. On the other\nhand, in countries with high power distance, parents expect\nchildren to obey without questioning. People of higher status\nmay expect obvious displays of respect from subordinates. In\nthe workplace, superiors and subordinates are not likely to see\neach other as equals, and it is assumed that bosses will make\ndecisions without consulting employees. In general, status is\nmore important in high power distance countries.\nFigure 3. Power Distance (PW) refers to the strength of a country\u2019s\nsocial hierarchy and the distribution of power and wealth.\nIndividualist and Collectivism refers to the degree to which\nindividuals are integrated into groups. Individualistic societies\nstress personal achievement and individual rights, focus on\npersonal needs and those of immediate family. In\nindividualistic societies, people choose their own affiliations\nand groups and move between different groups. On the other\nhand, collectivistic societies put more emphasis on the\nimportance of relationships and loyalty. Individuals in\ncollectivist societies belong to fewer groups and they are\ndefined more by their membership in particular groups.\n26 | Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Communication is more direct in individualistic societies but\nmore indirect in collectivistic societies.\nFigure 4. The Individualist and Collectivist (IC) scale measures the\ndegree to which individuals are integrated into groups and\nemphasize their relationship within the group.\nLong Term (LT) and Short Term (ST) describes a society\u2019s time\nhorizon; the degree to which cultures encourage delaying\ngratification or material, social, emotional needs of the\nmembers: LT places more importance on the future, pragmatic\nvalues, oriented toward rewards like persistence, thrift, saving,\nand capacity for adaptation. Short term values are related to\nthe past and the present (not future) with emphasis on\nimmediate needs, quick results, and unrestrained spending\noften in response to social or ecological pressure.\nHofstede's Cultural Dimensions | 27 Figure 5. The Long Term/Short Term Orientation scale is not original\nto Hofstede\u2019s work. It reflects a country\u2019s time horizon and sense of\ngratification.\nConsiderations and Criticisms\nThe cultural value dimensions identified by Hofstede are useful\nways to think about culture and to study cultural psychology;\nhowever, Hofstede\u2019s theory has also been seriously questioned.\nMost of the criticism has been directed at the methodology\nof the study beginning with the original instrument. The\nquestionnaire was not originally designed to measure culture\nbut rather workplace satisfaction (Orr & Hauser, 2008) and\nmany of the conclusions are based on a small number of\nresponses (McSweeney, 2002). Although 117,000 questionnaires\nwere administered, the results from 40 countries were used\nand only six countries had more than 1000 respondents. Critics\nalso question the representativeness of the original sample.\nThe study was conducted using employees of a multinational\ncorporation (IBM) who were highly educated, mostly male, who\nperformed what we call \u2018white collar\u2019 work (McSweeney, 2002).\n28 | Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Hofstede\u2019s theory has also been criticized for promoting a\nlargely static view of culture (Hamden-Turner & Trompenaars,\n1997; Orr and Hauser, 2008) that does not respond to changes\nor influences of other cultures. It is hard to deny that the world\nhas changed in dramatic ways since Hofstede\u2019s research\nbegan.\nMaterial and nonmaterial aspects of culture can vary subtly\nfrom region to region. As people travel, moving from different\nregions to entirely different parts of the world, certain material\nand nonmaterial aspects of culture become dramatically\nunfamiliar. As we interact with cultures other than our own,\nwe become more aware of our own culture, which might\notherwise be invisible to us, and to the differences and\ncommonalities between our culture and others.\nHofstede's Cultural Dimensions | 29 Ethnocentrism and\nCultural Relativism\nEthnocentrism is the tendency to look at the world primarily\nfrom the perspective of one\u2019s own culture. Part of\nethnocentrism is the belief that one\u2019s own race, ethnic or\ncultural group is the most important or that some or all aspects\nof its culture are superior to those of other groups. Some\npeople will simply call it cultural ignorance.\nEthnocentrism often leads to incorrect assumptions about\nothers\u2019 behavior based on your own norms, values, and beliefs.\nIn extreme cases, a group of individuals may see another\nculture as wrong or immoral and because of this may try to\nconvert, sometimes forcibly, the group to their own ways of\nliving. War and genocide could be the devastating result if a\ngroup is unwilling to change their ways of living or cultural\npractices.\nEthnocentrism may not, in some circumstances, be\navoidable. We often have involuntary reactions toward another\nperson or culture\u2019s practices or beliefs but these reactions do\nnot have to result in horrible events such as genocide or war.\nIn order to avoid conflict over culture practices and beliefs, we\nmust all try to be more culturally relative.\n30 | Ethnocentrism and Cultural\nRelativism In some cultures, it\u2019s perfectly normal for same-sex friends to hold\nhands while in others, hand holding is restricted to romantically\ninvolved individuals only. [Image: Subharnab Majumdar, http://goo.gl/\n0Ghfof, CC BY-2.0]\nCultural relativism is the principle of regarding and valuing the\npractices of a culture from the point of view of that culture\nand to avoid making hasty judgments. Cultural relativism tries\nto counter ethnocentrism by promoting the understanding of\ncultural practices that are unfamiliar to other cultures such as\neating insects, genocides or genital cutting. Take for example,\nthe common practice of same-sex friends in India walking in\npublic while holding hands. This is a common behavior and\na sign of connectedness between two people. In England, by\ncontrast, holding hands is largely limited to romantically\ninvolved couples, and often suggests a sexual relationship.\nThese are simply two different ways of understanding the\nmeaning of holding hands. Someone who does not take a\nrelativistic view might be tempted to see their own\nunderstanding of this behavior as superior and, perhaps, the\nforeign practice as being immoral.\nEthnocentrism and Cultural Relativism | 31 Despite the fact that cultural relativism promotes the\nappreciation for cultural differences, it can also be problematic.\nAt its most extreme, cultural relativism leaves no room for\ncriticism of other cultures, even if certain cultural practices are\nhorrific or harmful. Many practices have drawn criticism over\nthe years. In Madagascar, for example, the famahidana funeral\ntradition includes bringing bodies out from tombs once every\nseven years, wrapping them in cloth, and dancing with them.\nSome people view this practice disrespectful to the body of\nthe deceased person. Today, a debate rages about the ritual\ncutting of genitals of girls in several Middle Eastern and African\ncultures. To a lesser extent, this same debate arises around\nthe circumcision of baby boys in Western hospitals. When\nconsidering harmful cultural traditions, it can be patronizing\nto use cultural relativism as an excuse for avoiding debate. To\nassume that people from other cultures are neither mature\nenough nor responsible enough to consider criticism from the\noutside is demeaning.\nThe concept of cross-cultural relationship is the idea that\npeople from different cultures can have relationships that\nacknowledge, respect and begin to understand each other\u2019s\ndiverse lives. People with different backgrounds can help each\nother see possibilities that they never thought were there\nbecause of limitations, or cultural proscriptions, posed by their\nown traditions. Becoming aware of these new possibilities will\nultimately change the people who are exposed to the new\nideas. This cross-cultural relationship provides hope that new\nopportunities will be discovered, but at the same time it is\nthreatening. The threat is that once the relationship occurs,\none can no longer claim that any single culture is the absolute\ntruth.\n32 | Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism Chapter Review\nCulture refers to patterns of learned and shared behavior that\nare cumulative and transmitted across generations.\nHistorically, the role of culture has been overlooked in the field\nof psychology and a majority of psychological research has\nfocused on Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich and Democratic\n(WEIRD) cultures. Cultural psychology has emerged as a\nspecialty within the field of psychology to increase awareness\nof culture in shaping thinking and behavior. Etic and emic are\ncultural perspectives through which we can view psychological\nphenomena that include non-material culture like values,\nattitudes and beliefs.

Humans use culture to adapt and transform the\nworld we live in but many scientists have provided examples\nof animals who learn, share and transmit adaptations across\ngenerations. This raises important questions about whether\nhuman culture.\nCultural Learning | 37 Learning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1.

Distinguish between the three main mechanisms for\ncultural transmission in humans.\n38 | Cultural Learning Animal Culture\nAristotle was the first to provide evidence of social learning in\nbird songs and Charles Darwin was the first to suggest what\nbecame known as social learning in explaining the\ntransmission of an adaptive behavior pattern seen in a\npopulation of honey bees. Social learning happens when\nbehaviors are acquired through observation or are taught by\nother members of a social group (e.g., caregivers, siblings) or\nsocial institutions (e.g., schools, places of worship). Social\nlearning among humans is important because it means that\nwe can avoid costly and time-consuming trial and error and\nat the same time multiply the power of individual learning\n(Boyd & Richardson, 2005). Our collective brain power makes\nit possible for certain behaviors to become more adaptive and\nspread among groups.\nAnimal Culture | 39 Animals demonstrate many of the same behaviors as humans like\ncaregiving; and learn important social norms from the group. [Image\nby Bob Peterson: Honey Bee on Willow Catkin https://www.flickr.com/\nphotos/pondapple/5419305106 CC \u2013 BY 2.0]\nThe actual phrase animal culture was first proposed by\nJapanese primatologists who discovered socially transmitted\nfood behaviors on Koshima Island in the 1940s among\nJapanese monkeys. The scientists observed a female monkey\ndunk a piece of potato in the ocean. Basically, she washed\nher food before she ate it and this innovation spread to a few\nother monkeys in the troop (the term for a group of monkeys).\nOver time, the scientists observed gender (female) and age\n(younger) differences in the monkeys\u2019 abilities to imitate and\n40 | Animal Culture learn the behavior but potato washing persists on the island\ntoday, over 60 years later (Hirata, Watanabe, Kawa, 2001). Social\nlearning and transmission has also been documented in\nwhales, dolphins and chimpanzees, as well as other animals.\nWhale songs. Male humpback whales produce various songs\nover their lifetime, which are learned from other males in the\npopulation. Males in a population conform to produce the\nsame mating song, consisting of a highly stereotyped vocal\ndisplay involved in mate attraction. Researchers were able to\nrecord a series of songs and identified the cultural transmission\nof these songs across geographic distances (Western and\nCentral South Pacific Ocean) over 11 years (Garland et al., 2013;\nGarland, Rendell, Lamoni, Poole and Noad, 2017).\nDolphin Sponges. A community of bottlenose dolphins in\nWestern Australia use conical sponges as tools to find food\n(foraging). During \u201csponging,\u201d dolphins break off a sponge and\nwear it over the rostrum (snout) while foraging on the seafloor\n(Smolker, et al., 1997; Mann et al., 2008). Scientists think that\nthe dolphins use the sponges for protection while foraging.\nResearchers, using genetic analyses, found that all \u2018spongers\u2019\nare descendants of a single matriline (mother to daughter)\nwhich suggests cultural transmission of the use of sponges, as\ntools, within a specific population (Mann and Sargeant, 2003).\nChimpanzee Tools. Chimpanzees also use tools for foraging\nbut different types of tools are associated with specific\npopulations. This means that not all chimpanzees make or use\nthe same tools for the same purpose (see Whiten articles for\nsummary). For example, one troop of chimpanzees plunges\nsticks into termite nests to gather food and another troupe\nuses bark or leaves as a kind of scoop to forage for termites.\nThere is a documented instance of chimpanzees in the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo creating a tool that is like a\npaint brush or bottle washer that results in more successful\nforaging.\nAnimal Culture | 41 Different chimpanzee groups use different tool methods to find food.\n[Image by Nigel Swales Chester Zoo CC BY-SA-NC 2.0\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/28946988@N07/8087616862]\n42 | Animal Culture Uniquely Human\nAlthough we humans are not the only species to exhibit\nculture, we depend on it in a way that no other species does\nand no other species demonstrates the cultural virtuosity and\nflexibility of human beings. In the animal world, transmitting\ninnovations (combining of two or more separate elements into\nentirely new tools or practices) among peers and between\ngenerations of the same group occurs frequently but not\nnecessarily between separate groups of the same species.\nMoreover, cultural innovation does not seem to occur among\nnon-human species but it is a hallmark of human cultural\ndevelopment.\nThe first thing to emphasize is that humans are not born\nwith culture like we are born with brown eyes, black hair or\nfreckles. We are born into culture, and we learn it by living\nin human social groups. In this way culture is something that\nis transmitted from one generation to the next. This is how\nwe become \u2018enculturated. Using archaeological data, is has\nbeen estimated that the human capacity for cultural learning\nemerged somewhere between 500, 000 \u2013 170 000 years ago\n(Lind et al., 2003) , although some researchers have argued\nthat the predisposition for social cognition, which facilitates\nsocial learning, extends farther back in time when we split from\nan ancient ancestor (Heinrich, 2016; Tomasello, 1999). Other\nscientists argue that convincing evidence for human culture\nonly appears within the last 100, 000 years (Tattersall, 2015).\nRegardless of the time period or mechanism, most\nresearchers, across disciplines, accept that changes, namely\nin the area of cognition and cooperation led to cultural\nadaptations and cultural learning among humans.\nDescribing and explaining which elements of culture are\nuniquely human is complex, cross-disciplinary and\nUniquely Human | 43 controversial. As this is an introductory text we will limit our\ndiscussion to three areas where there is broad agreement on\nthe uniqueness of human culture as it relates to psychology:\ncognition, cooperation and cumulative learning.\nCognition\nIt has been argued that cognitive abilities like learning,\nattending and memory underlie human and cultural evolution\n(Heine, 2016; Henrich, 2016, Tomasello, 1999) because these\nabilities make humans better at social learning which, as an\nadaptation, led to cultural learning. Social learning is best\ndescribed as learning that occurs in the presence of another\nperson and there are two main forms of social learning:\nemulative and imitative learning (Heine, 2016; Tomasello &\nRakoczy, 2003). Emulative learning focuses on the\nenvironment, process and outcomes related to a specific event\nthat is observed. It is an individual style of learning even though\nthere is another person who has modelled the behavior.\nHumans and nonhuman primates engage in emulative\nlearning. Imitative learning is considered to be uniquely\nhuman (Tomasello & Rakoczy, 2003) and occurs through the\nprocess of modeling and demonstrating behavior with an\nunderstanding of the goal of the behavior. Imitative learning\nincludes intention and reflection of the behaviors, as well as\nan understanding of the perspective of the person who is\nperforming the behavior. Humans also imitate behavior to fit\nin and not just to learn, which has not been observed in other\nnonhuman primates (Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007).\nTo illustrate the difference between these these two types of\nsocial learning, Nagell, Olguin and Tomasello (1993) designed\nan experiment that required toddlers and chimpanzees to use\na tool (rake) to retrieve an object that they really wanted (a\ntoy for the children and food for the chimpanzees) that was\n44 | Uniquely Human out of their reach. Each group was shown how to use the tool\nto retrieve the object \u2013 but there was a slight variation to the\nexperiment. One group was shown how to use the rake teeth\ndown which was effective but not efficient. The other group\nwas shown how to use the rake teeth up which was both\neffective and efficient. The toddlers used imitative learning and\ncopied the behavior they had observed, either teeth up or teeth\ndown. The chimpanzees used the teeth up situation, regardless\nof what they observed and were more successful in reaching\nthe food. The chimpanzees used emulative learning which was\nthe most effective and efficient way to learn and solve\nproblems. Additional cognitive research has confirmed that on\nsome measures of thinking, apes were smarter than human\nadults (Martin, Bhui, Bossarts, Matsuzawa, & Camerer, 2014) and\nchildren (Herrmann et al., 2007).\nIn a series of cognitive experiments chimpanzees,\norangutans and 2-year old toddlers were compared on\nmeasures of physical problem solving and social problem\nsolving. Toddlers were used in the experiment because human\nadults would have performed significantly better than the apes\nacross all cognitive measures (we call this the ceiling effect).\nResults revealed that on measures of physical problem solving,\napes and toddlers performed about the same.\nUniquely Human | 45 Figure 1. Results showed no significant differences between ape and\ntoddler performance on a physical problem solving task.\nOn social problem-solving tasks that required the participants\nto engage in social learning, toddlers outperformed the apes.\nThere was really no competition. Results from comparative\nstudies like these suggest that humans are not intellectually\nsuperior (at least when compared to apes) except in the area\nof social learning that included elements of imitative learning.\nAttending to events, modeling the behaviors of others, learning\nfrom others and storing the knowledge for later use and\nproblem solving is central to imitative learning and essential for\ncultural learning and cumulative culture.\n46 | Uniquely Human Figure 2. Results showed big differences on social problem solving\namong toddlers, chimpanzees and orangutans (Tomasello, Kruger, &\nRatner, 1993)\nMuch of the research examined so far has compared human\ntoddlers to nonhuman primates; however, there is a growing\nbody of developmental literature that confirms the importance\nof social learning. Cross-cultural research in the area of\ndevelopmental psychology has demonstrated that human\ninfants selectively attend to several important cues like\nprestige (who does it best), sex and ethnicity (sound and look\nlike me) and familiarity (similarity in background). The research\nhas also demonstrated that learning these cues seems to\nhappen at about the same time in human development and in\nabout the same order across cultures. Cues and social learning\nare not just for infants. Researchers examined undergraduate\nstudent performance and cues related to sex and ethnicity.\nAfter controlling for other variables, results showed students\nwho receive instruction from faculty of the same sex, ethnicity\nor race were less likely to drop out and had better grades\n(Hoffman & Oreopoulous, 2009; Fairlie, Hoffman &\nOreopoulous, 2011). These studies suggest that interpretation,\nUniquely Human | 47 motivation and understanding cues appear to have significant\nimplications for early childhood development, as well as later\nadoption of adult roles.\nRelatively recent autism research has provided an\nopportunity to explore the role of cues and attending even\nfurther. Autism research suggests that children with autism\nwho miss out on these stages of attending have significant\ndifficulty with social cues (Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993).\nAdditionally, children with autism have great difficulty sharing\nemotional states or understanding the intentions of others\n(Tomasello et al., 2004). By sharing intentions humans are able\nto experience events and perspectives together at a level not\nseen among our closest animal relatives (Tomasello, et al.,\n2004). Shared intentionality is a cognitive process by which\nwe see others as intentional agents. Shared intentionality\nencompasses interactions, commitment to a goal, and\ncooperation with others to achieve the goal, which are\nnecessary elements for cultural learning and cultural\nadaptations (Heine, 2016; Tomasello et al., 2004).\n48 | Uniquely Human Children seem to have an innate ability to look for cues from adults\nfor learning. [Image by: US Coast Guard.\nhttp://heartland.coastguard.dodlive.mil/2013/08/one-life-jacket-away/]\nCooperation\nThe ability to work together toward common goals is required\nfor the survival of any group. There is strong evidence that\nnonhuman primates (our genetic cousins) cooperate but that\nit is limited to kin or partners with few documented cases of\ncooperation with intergroup members (e.g., strangers) (Melis\nand Semmann, 2010). Cooperating with strangers to complete\ncomplex goals appears to be a uniquely human behavior and\nthere are several explanations for these phenomena, including\ncognitive skills, protection from conflict and the development\nof social norms.\nUniquely Human | 49 Cognition\nAs discussed earlier in the previous section that humans have\na unique ability to engage in social learning (Boyd, Richerson\n& Henrich, 2011; Hermann et al., 2007; Tomasello, 1999), as well\nas other psychological advantages including memory which\nhelps us to track who helped us and who we have helped\n(Hauser et al., 2009; Melis and Semmann, 2010). Perhaps most\nimportantly, we are able to transfer all this information to\nothers in our group, which means that as an individual you\nmight gain a reputation for being a helper or gain a reputation\nfor being a loafer (more about this in Chapter 11).\nProtection\nCooperation may also have emerged as a result of external\npressures (e.g.,intergroup conflict, climate change,\ncompetition) which facilitated the formation of large groups.\nBowles and colleagues (2013) suggest that competition with\nother groups brought about social changes and groups who\nwere better at cooperating were more likely to survive.\nAdditionally, our ancient ancestors were more likely to be prey\nthan predator and being part of a large group offered some\nprotection from predators (Hart & Sussman, 2009; Henrich,\n2016). Dunbar (1993) has proposed that because early humans\nbegan living in large communities, language (a cognitive\nproduct) was developed. He suggests that humans required\nthe use of complex communication to maintain social\ncohesion and unity among group members.\n50 | Uniquely Human Norms\nAs groups became larger, humans established social rules or\nnorms (Richerson & Boyd, 2008). Henrich (2016) argues that\nsocial norms within groups emerged because of our unique\ncognitive abilities for social learning (e.g., to learn from\nsomeone else). By observing a model of appropriate behavior,\nhumans learn what behavior is unacceptable and those\nindividuals who do not follow these social rules are often\nsanctioned (punished). Cooperation has spread across\npopulations because of social norms that sanction intergroup\nconflict and promote fair treatment of group members.\nResearch with infants less than a year old appears to support\nthis argument.\nHamlin and colleagues used a puppet morality play in an\nexperiment with infants and toddlers that found children\npreferred people who help others reach a goal (prosocial\nbehaviors) and avoided people who were harmful, or who get\nin the way of others reaching a goal. As early as 3 months old,\nhumans are evaluating the behaviors of others and assigning\na positive value to helpful, cooperative behaviors (Hamlin et al.,\nUniquely Human | 51 2007; Hamlin & Wynn, 2011) and negative values to harmful or\nselfish behaviors.\nChildren use social referencing to learn from others, mainly\ncaregivers about appropriate social norms and as a result prefer\nothers who are helpful and avoid those who do not help others.\n[Image by Senior Airman Marcy Copeland; Child daycare\nhttps://www.luke.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/640868/\ncdc-mission-includes-playtime/]\nProsocial behaviors and social norms that reward cooperation\nand helping become automatic overtime and are reflected in\neveryday choices that we make as adults. For example, Rand\nand colleagues used the Public Goods Game, an economic\nexperiment, to examine cooperation and competition (Rand,\n2016). In the game, participants decide how much to contribute\nto the public good and if all participants contribute then the\npayoff is greater for the entire group.\nEarly findings revealed that participants who made their\ncontributions faster gave more to the public good (greater\ncooperation). These results were consistent in several\n52 | Uniquely Human replications (Cone & Rand 2014); when forced to make a quick\ndecision, participants cooperated more than when asked to\nreflect on their decision. It seems that under certain\ncircumstances, social contexts and social norms, \u2018going with\nyour gut\u2019 leads to increased cooperation (Henrich, 2016).\nCumulative Learning\nWe read earlier in the chapter that animals have cultural\ntransmissions but only humans seem to have the ability for\ncumulative cultural changes that result in behaviors that no\none single person could have learned individually through a\nlifetime of trial and error. We call this cumulative cultural\nlearning which refers to human collective brain power\n(Tomasello & Moll, 2010) or a set of sophisticated skills that\nwe possess (Henrich, 2016) which allow us to create practices,\nbehaviors, norms, artifacts (things) and institutions that are\nretained by group members and transmitted across\ngenerations and to other groups.\nHumans can use this collective brain power for novel\nproblem solving in order to adapt to changing environments\nand social conditions. Boyd, Richerson and Henrich (2011a) go\neven farther and suggest that culture is part of our human\nbiology because our brains and our bodies have been shaped\nand influenced across thousands of years in ways that promote\nthe accumulation and transmission of knowledge.\nUniquely Human | 53 Some anthropologists believe that culture is part of our human\nbiology because our brains and bodies have been shaped in ways\nthat promote the accumulation of knowledge. [Image by Tkgd2007\n[CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)]\nMany researchers suggest that cumulative cultural evolution\nresults from a ratchet effect that began when humans\ndeveloped the cognitive infrastructure and processes to\nunderstand that others have intentions so people can engage\nin coordinated efforts to achieve complex and specialized tasks\n(Tennie, Call, & Tomasello 2009). The ratchet effect suggests\nthat cultural adaptations and innovations are accumulated\n(become part of a larger library of knowledge) and then are\nexpanded upon and refined across generations.\nThere are historical examples of cultures who have lost\naccumulated culture. Henrich (2004) details the experiences of\nTasmanian islanders and explains using a mathematical model\nhow cultural learning can be lost. History and social context are\nimportant here \u2013 humans arrived on Tasmania, from Australia\n(conceivably), about 34,000 years ago by crossing a land bridge\nthat was later covered by rising ocean levels. Using\n54 | Uniquely Human archeological evidence, it seems that the early Tasmanians\n(roughly 70,000 inhabitants) had a sophisticated toolkit with\nhundreds of tools and a set of skills for hunting different\nanimals. When eighteenth century explorers arrived in\nTasmania the population had declined, the toolkit had only\n24 tools and the diet had significantly less variety than the\nearly Tasmanians. Henrich argues that the loss of knowledge\nhappened because Tasmanians did not attend to the best\nmodels or teachers (or there were fewer skilled people) and the\nproducts that were created were imperfect. Over time, skills\nwere lost and knowledge was lost which resulted in a loss of\naccumulated knowledge. There are examples of cultural loss\nin North America among native populations; however, these\nexamples are not the result of natural selection or ecological\npressures. In most cases, cultural loss was brought about\nthrough external forces including colonization, subjugation\nand the enforcement of policies to limit transmission of cultural\nvalues, practices, rituals and language (UNESCO) of most\nnative populations.\nIt is generally accepted that innovations and the\naccumulation of cultural learning occurs at a faster rate with\nlarger groups that have greater interconnection. These ideas\nwere tested in a laboratory experiment that used college\nstudents and a computer game (Derex, Beugin, Godelle &\nRaymond, 2013). Students were shown a complicated fishing\nnet and then asked to design the same net using a computer.\nStudents were assigned to groups that range from 2 to 16\nmembers and each player had 15 attempts to design the net.\nStudents earned points based on the quality of their work. To\nmimic social learning, students were able to select a model\ncreated by other group members. Researchers found that\nmembers of a larger group were more likely to complete the\nfishing net accurately with fewer trials. The researchers assert\nin larger groups there were more models to learn from. This lab\nexperiment along with scientific observations reveal that in a\nUniquely Human | 55 large group it is more likely that someone will come up with a\ngreat idea that can be maintained and improved by the group\n(Heine, 2016) and the learning process moves quicker.\nSummary\nComparative animal studies and developmental research are\ngenerally seen as support that human brains come\npreprogrammed with a host of cognitive abilities that have\nhelped us to adapt and survive (Henrich, 2016). Some\nresearchers also believe that human cognitive ability evolved\ngenetically so that we would become better learners,\nindividually, as well as better at learning from others by\nfiguring out what people (e.g., teacher, expert or model\nexample) want us to do or know (Henrich, 2016). This has\nimportant implications or consequences for our interactions\nwith others, including cooperative behaviors. Prosocial\nbehaviors are learned through the cognitive processes we\ndiscussed earlier, like attending, imitating, as well as through\nsocial learning. Social norms that reward cooperation and\nhelping become automatic overtime and contribute to large\ngroup cohesion and unity. Large groups with high\ninterconnection are less likely to experience loss of\naccumulated knowledge and more likely to innovate and\nadapt to ecological stress and other selective pressures.\n56 | Uniquely Human Ecological and\nGeographic Cultural\nVariation\nModern humans are genetically very similar (genotype) but\nexhibit very different physical characteristics (phenotype). It is\ngenerally accepted that genetic and cultural diversity is\ngeographically and ecologically structured, which means that\npeople from particular regions resemble each other more than\nthey resemble people from other regions. As modern humans\nmigrated to geographic and climatic regions that differed from\nthe lands of their ancestors, they met new environmental\nchallenges. Group variation arose because different groups\nencountered different environments and conditions (Boyd and\nRicherson, 2011b). These new environments led to genetic\nchanges that enhanced survival for group members, which\nEcological and Geographic\nCultural Variation | 57 were then transmitted to offspring across generations.\nMoreover, these new, often harsh environments forced humans\nto create new ways of coping, learning, living and raising their\noffspring that also enhanced survival.\nEnvironmental variance refers to differences among groups\nbecause the environment is different. Stressors can be abiotic\n(e.g., climate, UV radiation or high altitude), biotic (e.g., disease),\nor social (e.g., war and psychological stress). Evidence is\ngrowing that environmental stressors (or pressures) can cause\ngenetic variations (i.e., changes in genes). You are probably\nfamiliar with at least a couple of genetic adaptations brought\nabout by environmental pressures.\nPopulation migration to high altitude has altered red blood\ncells to accommodate the reduced oxygen levels at high\naltitude (Beall, 2004). Malaria is a biotic example of an\nenvironmental variant. Malaria is a disease carried by\nmosquitoes and affects thousands of people each year. A\nchange in red blood cell shape (sickle or semicircle) is a genetic\nadaptation present in tropical climates to protect individuals\nfrom malaria but in other environments the adaptation can\nbe quite harmful to a person. Sickle cell anemia is a disease\nthat has emerged because the once advantageous adaptation\ncauses joint inflammation and pain in people when expressed\nin other environments.\n58 | Ecological and Geographic Cultural Variation Sherpa is one of the major ethnic groups native to the most\nmountainous regions of Nepal and it is believed that their superior\nclimbing ability at high altitude is the result of a genetic adaptation.\nImage by Lance Trumbull \u2013 EverestPeaceProject.org [CC BY-SA 3.0\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/us/deed.en]\nAs mentioned earlier, groups living in new environments\ninvented new tools and new ways of doing things to adapt to\necological conditions and pressures. Cultural variance refers\nto different behaviors among groups as a result of different\nlearning, coping and living. Cultural adaptations can occur at\nany time and may be as simple as putting on a coat when it is\ncold or as complicated as engineering, building, and installing\na heating system in a building. Consider contemporary hunter-\ngatherer societies in the Arctic and Kalahari. These groups\ninhabit hostile environments that are separated by thousands\nof miles but they have not developed massive distinct genetic\nadaptations to these environments. They are successful\nbecause of cultural adaptations to their unique habitations.\nEcological and Geographic Cultural Variation | 59 In addition to environmental variations and ecological\npressures, cultural adaptations may be shaped by access to\narable land, sustainable strategies (e.g., fishing, hunting,\nagriculture) and sources of food. In other words, resources\navailable to the population. For example, the people of India\nrevere cows and believe that eating a cow is a terrible act,\nwhich might seem strange to people in other countries. Cows\nin India are considered sacred. Cows are viewed as more than\njust an animal because they provide milk which is a precious\nresource. In order to ensure the milk is always available cows\nmust be kept alive and well cared for. The cow is a food source,\neven if not in the way that, say, an American or European would\nview it. The sacredness of the cow was a cultural adaptive\nmeasure by the Indian people to keep an important, renewable\nresource protected.\nAnother example of a cultural adaptation, and the use of\nlocal resources, is building a shelter or a home. In the\nsouthwest United States, before air conditioning (and even\nwith air conditioning) homes were built to survive the hot, dry\nclimate. The bricks were made from abundant dirt and used\nfew windows, which kept heat in during the winter and out\nduring the summer. The flat roof construction catches the\nrainfall that is precious and scarce in the southwest. To those in\nother parts of the world it is just a structure, but to the people\nof the southwest it meant survival.\n60 | Ecological and Geographic Cultural Variation Cultural adaptations include building structures to protect people\nfrom environmental elements.\n[Image in Public Domain]\nAdaptations may be environmental or cultural and are likely\nthe result of differences in ecology, resources and people\n(Crezana, Kolodny, & Feldman, 2017). Van de Vliert (2011)\nexamined these components and their impact on ingroup\nfavoritism (preferences for people who are similar to us that\nresults in disproportionate shares of resources). Using data\nfrom almost 180 countries, ingroup favoritism was highest in\ncultures with the lowest income and harshest, most\ndemanding climates (e.g., extreme heat or cold) and lowest in\ncultures with high national income and demanding climates.\nEcological stress and scarce resources created social norms\nthat favor some people over others. By examining ecology,\nnational wealth and behaviors collectively, we can see the\nrelationship between these factors and cultural adaptations.\nEcological and Geographic Cultural Variation | 61 Ingroup favoritism is shaped by ecological factors like climate,\nnational wealth (resources) and connections to family and members\nof the ingroup. [Image by Ken Kistler, Lifeless Desert Tree\nhttps://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/\nview-image.php?image=88246&picture=lifeless-desert-tree]\nCultural similarities can be explained by adaptations of\ndifferent groups to similar environmental conditions and\ncultural variations can also be explained by changing\nenvironmental conditions. Since environmental changes were\nnot predictable, cultures changed in many different directions.\nCultures that were once similar could become dissimilar with\nselective pressures and ecological distress and the opposite\ncould also happen, cultures that were once different could\nbecome similar. The continual development of culturally\ntransmitted knowledge and skills enables people to thrive in\nnew environments.\n62 | Ecological and Geographic Cultural Variation Cultural Transmission\nEnvironmental pressure, things like natural disasters, flooding,\nlimited land to farm, is only one of many potential ways that\ncan lead to cultural adaptations. Others include technological\ninnovation (e.g., printing press, electricity) and contact with\nother cultures (immigration or colonization), which may\npromote or inhibit changes in cultural practices. Through\ncultural transmission, goods and services may be exchanged\nby two cultures, as well as values, languages, and behavior\npatterns. This section will review three main methods for\ncultural transmission.\nInnovation\nEarlier in the chapter we learned that large groups with a high\ndegree of interconnectivity are more innovative and less likely\nCultural Transmission | 63 to lose knowledge. Innovation includes combining existing\ninformation to create something new. In a large group or\npopulation, it is highly likely that one person will make a new\ndiscovery that will be adopted or shared with the group but\nonly if the innovation is useful (Heine, 2016). Consider the\ntransitions from foraging to agriculture or more recent\ntransitions from email to text messages \u2013 innovations that have\nbeen adopted, shared and transmitted across the globe.\nDiffusion\nDiffusion is the spread of material and nonmaterial culture and\nrelates to the integration between cultures and within cultures.\nWe learned earlier that material culture refers to tangible\nobjects or belongings of a group. For example, Middle-class\nAmericans can fly overseas and return with a new appreciation\nof Thai noodles or Italian gelato. The diffusion of nonmaterial\nculture (norms, values and beliefs) has accelerated as access to\ntelevision and the Internet has brought the lifestyles and values\nportrayed in sitcoms into homes around the globe. Twitter\nfeeds from public demonstrations in one nation have\nencouraged political protesters in other countries. When this\nkind of diffusion occurs, material objects and ideas from one\nculture are introduced into another. Ideas that are easy to\ncommunicate are more likely to spread and emotional\nmessages will spread more quickly. If an idea or a message\nchallenges our assumptions or expectations but seems\nreasonable it is also more likely to be shared and\ncommunicated (known as the minimally counterintuitive idea).\nAcculturation\nAcculturation is the process of social, psychological, and\n64 | Cultural Transmission cultural change that happens when cultures come into contact\nwith one another and blend through positive or negative\ninteractions. Acculturation can be experienced at the level of a\ngroup (e.g., war, political domination, colonization) and at the\nlevel of the individual (e.g., dating after divorce). The process\nof acculturation may be brutal, very distressing or only mildly\nuncomfortable but it is a normal part of our adaptation to\nthings that are new to us. Some of the most noticeable effects\nof acculturation often include changes in food, clothing, and\nlanguage. We discuss acculturation and culture shock more\nfully in Chapter 13.\nCultural Transmission | 65 Chapter Review\nHumans have a unique set of skills that enable us to more\nreadily innovate, adopt, adapt and improve. Underlying these\nskills seems to be a cognitive infrastructure that promotes\nlearning, teaching and perspective taking. These cognitive\nabilities seem to predispose humans to sociality, cooperation\nand collaboration with individuals who are outside of our kin\nnetwork. A trait that makes us very unique among other\nanimals and separates us from our nearest genetic cousins, the\nnon-human primates\nVocabulary\nAcculturation is the process of social, psychological, and\ncultural change that happens when cultures blend.\nAdaptation refers to a feature or a behavior that helps a\nliving thing survive and function better in its environment and\na genetic adaptation refers to changes physiological processes\nand genetics as a result of environmental or cultural variance.\nCooperation is the ability to work together toward common\ngoals; animals cooperate with kin or other group members, but\nhumans appear to be the only species that cooperates with\nstrangers.\nCultural learning requires elements of social learning and\nencompasses other unique cognitive abilities like shared\nintentionality and perspective taking; collective learning of a\nculture that facilitate innovation, improvements and\ntransmission across groups.\nCultural variance refers to different behaviors among groups\nas a result of different learning.\nCumulative learning refers to human collective brain power\n66 | Chapter Review or a set of sophisticated skills that allows humans to create\npractices, behaviors, norms, artifacts (things) and institutions\nthat are retained by group members and transmitted across\ngenerations and to other groups.\nDiffusion is the spread of material and nonmaterial culture\nand relates to the integration between cultures and within\ncultures.\nEmulative learning focuses on the environment, process and\noutcomes related to a specific event that is observed.\nEnvironmental variance refers to differences among groups\nbecause the environment is different.\nImitative learning occurs through the process of modeling\nand demonstrating behavior with an understanding of the\ngoal of the behavior.\nInnovation is a new idea, method, behavior or tool\nRatchet effect suggests that cultural adaptations and\ninnovations are accumulated (become part of a larger library\nof knowledge) and then expanded upon and refined across\ngenerations.\nSocial learning occurs when behaviors are acquired through\nobservation or are taught by other members of a social group\n(e.g., caregivers, siblings) or social institutions (e.g., schools,\nplaces of worship).\nShared intentionality is a cognitive process by which we see\nothers as intentional agents; encompasses interactions,\ncommitment to a goal, and cooperation with others to achieve\nthe goal.\nChapter Review | 67  PART III\nRESEARCH METHODS\nAND CULTURE\nMargaret Mead focused her indigenous studies in Samoa on\nproblems of child rearing, personality, and culture. Though her work is\ncontroversial and has been criticized she was an early pioneer in\nindigenous cultural research. [Image in Public Domain Margaret\nMead in Samoa]\nPsychologists are interested in the ways that cultural forces\ninfluence psychological processes. They study culture as a\nmeans of better understanding the ways it affects our\nemotions, identity, relationships, and decisions. Psychologists\ngenerally ask different types of questions and use different\nmethods than do anthropologists. Anthropologists are more\nlikely to conduct indigenous (ethnographic) studies. In this\ntype of research, the scientist spends time observing a culture\nand conducting interviews. In this way, anthropologists often\nattempt to understand and appreciate culture from the point\nof view of the people within it. Psychologists who adopt this\nResearch Methods and\nCulture | 69 approach are often thought to be studying cultural\npsychology. They are likely to use interviews as a primary\nresearch methodology.\nIndigenous Cross \u2013 cultural\nCulturally\nAble to make\nsensitive, studies\ncomparisons\npeople in their\nbetween groups;\nAdvantages natural\ncomparisons\nenvironment;\nacross different\ncontext is\ncultures.\nimportant.\nDifficult to make\nVulnerable to\nDisadvantages comparisons\nethnocentric bias.\nbetween cultures.\nCultural psychology is distinct from cross-cultural psychology,\nand this can be confusing. Cross-cultural studies are those that\nuse standard forms of measurement, such as Likert scales, to\ncompare people from different cultures and identify their\ndifferences. Cross-cultural studies serve as the backbone of\ncross-cultural research in psychology but methodological\nissues can have an impact on research quality.\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1. Distinguish between cultural psychological and cross-\ncultural psychological research methods.\n2. Identify advantages and disadvantages between\nindigenous and cross-cultural studies.\n3. Identify methodological issues that are magnified when\nstudying other cultures.\n4. Distinguish between ethnocentric bias and cultural\nattribution theory.\n70 | Research Methods and Culture 5. Identify key ethical principles when conducting cross \u2013\ncultural research.\n6. Identify key ethical challenges when conducting cross \u2013\ncultural research.\n7. Explain why some topics are considered sensitive in some\ncultures.\nResearch Methods and Culture | 71  Advantages and\nDisadvantages\nBoth cultural and cross-cultural studies have their own\nadvantages and disadvantages. Interestingly, researchers can\nlearn a lot from cultural similarities and cultural differences;\nboth require comparisons across cultures. For example, Diener\nand Oishi (2000) were interested in exploring the relationship\nbetween money and happiness. They were specifically\ninterested in cross-cultural differences in levels of life\nsatisfaction between people from different cultures. To\nexamine this question, they used international surveys that\nasked all participants the exact same question, such as \u201cAll\nthings considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a\nwhole these days?\u201d and used a standard scale for answers; in\nthis case one that asked people to use a 1-10 scale to respond.\nThey also collected data on average income levels in each\nnation, and adjusted these for local differences in how many\ngoods and services that money can buy.\nThe Diener research team (2000) discovered that, across\nmore than 40 nations, there was a tendency for money to be\nassociated with higher life satisfaction. People from richer\ncountries such as Denmark, Switzerland and Canada had\nrelatively high satisfaction while their counterparts from poorer\ncountries such as India and Belarus had lower levels. There\nwere some interesting exceptions, however. People from\nJapan\u2014a wealthy nation\u2014reported lower satisfaction than did\ntheir peers in nations with similar wealth. In addition, people\nfrom Brazil\u2014a poorer nation\u2014had unusually high scores\ncompared to their income counterparts. The researchers tried\nto explain these differences and one proposed explanation was\nculture.\nAdvantages and\nDisadvantages | 73 Cross-cultural (method) validation is another type of cross-\ncultural study that establishes whether assessments (e.g.,\nsurveys, tests, standard scales) are valid and reliable when used\nacross cultures. Cross-cultural validation studies evaluate the\nequivalence of psychological measures across cultures.\nInstruments used across cultures should be equivalent.\nMeasurement equivalence refers to similarity in conceptual\nmeaning and empirical method between cultures. Bias on the\nother hand refers to differences that do not have exactly the\nsame meaning within and across cultures.\nTwo essential features of any instrument or standard scale\nare validity and reliability.\n\u2022 Validity of an instrument is another way of saying\naccuracy. Validity asks whether the instrument (or test)\nmeasures what it is supposed to measure\n\u2022 Reliability of an instrument is another way of saying\nconsistency of the results or consistency of the instrument.\n74 | Advantages and Disadvantages Think of a psychological construct as the circle and rings. A survey\nshould accurately sample the construct (evenly cover the circles) and\nconsistently measure the construct (attempts are clustered closely\ntogether) [Image by Nevit Dilman Reliability and Validity CC-BY-SA\n3.0 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Reliability_and_validity.svg\nOften instruments, surveys and interview questionnaires that\nare created in the United States, show strong reliability and\nvalidity when tested in the United States (i.e., have been\nvalidated) but often these measures do not perform well in\nother cultures. Common validation issues include problems\nwith language (i.e., translation issues) and assumptions that\nAdvantages and Disadvantages | 75 the topic area is the same across cultures (i.e., is anxiety the\nsame everywhere?).\n76 | Advantages and Disadvantages Research Issues in\nCultural Psychology\nResearch methods are the elements used in a psychological\ninvestigation (experiment) to describe and explain\npsychological phenomena and constructs. Research methods\ncan also be used to predict and control for methodological\nissues through the use of objective and systematic analysis.\nInformation, sometimes called data, for psychological research\ncan be collected from different sources like human\nparticipants (e.g., surveys, interviews), animal studies (e.g.,\nlearning and behavior) and archival sources (e.g, tweets, and\nsocial media posts). Research is done with the help of an\nexperiment, through observation, analysis and comparison.\nWhen conducting research within a culture (indigenous\nResearch Issues in Cultural\nPsychology | 77 study) or across cultures (cross-cultural study) many things can\ngo wrong that will make conducting, analyzing and\ninterpreting data difficult. This section will review four\ncommon methodological issues in cultural research (He, 2010).\n\u2022 Sampling Bias\n\u2022 Procedural Bias\n\u2022 Instrument Bias\n\u2022 Interpretation Issues\n78 | Research Issues in Cultural Psychology Sampling Bias\nIn the United States, and other Western countries, it is common\nto recruit university undergraduate students to participate in\npsychological research studies. Using samples of convenience\nfrom this very thin slice of humanity presents a problem when\ntrying to generalize to the larger public and across cultures.\nAside from being an over-representation of young, middle-\nclass Caucasians, college students may also be more compliant\nand more susceptible to attitude change, have less stable\npersonality traits and interpersonal relationships, and possess\nstronger cognitive skills than samples reflecting a wider range\nof age and experience (Peterson & Merunka, 2014; Visser,\nKrosnick, & Lavrakas, 2000).\nPut simply, these traditional samples (college students) may\nnot be sufficiently representative of the broader population.\nFurthermore, considering that 96% of participants in\npsychology studies come from western, educated,\nindustrialized, rich, and democratic countries (so-called WEIRD\ncultures; Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010), and that the\nmajority of these are also psychology students, the question of\nnon-representativeness becomes even more serious.\nSampling Bias | 79 How confident can we be that the results of social psychology studies\ngeneralize to the wider population if study participants are largely of\nthe WEIRD variety? [Image: Mike Miley, http://goo.gl/NtvlU8, CC BY-SA\n2.0]\nWhen studying a basic cognitive process (e.g., working\nmemory) or an aspect of social behavior that appears to be\nfairly universal (e.g., cooperation), a non-representative sample\nmay not be a big deal but over time research has repeatedly\ndemonstrated the important role that individual differences\n(e.g., personality traits and cognitive abilities) and culture (e.g.,\nindividualism vs. collectivism) play in shaping social behavior.\nFor instance, even if we only consider a tiny sample of\nresearch on aggression, we know that narcissists are more\n80 | Sampling Bias likely to respond to criticism with aggression (Bushman &\nBaumeister, 1998); conservatives, who have a low tolerance for\nuncertainty, are more likely to prefer aggressive actions against\nthose considered to be \u201coutsiders\u201d (de Zavala et al., 2010);\ncountries where men hold the bulk of power in society have\nhigher rates of physical aggression directed against female\npartners (Archer, 2006); and males from the southern part of\nthe United States are more likely to react with aggression\nfollowing an insult (Cohen et al., 1996).\nMadonna and Child that reflect unique cultural differences and\npractices.

Asking middle-school students in the United States\nabout their online shopping experiences may not be a\nrepresentative sample for middle school students in Kenya,\nAfrica. Even when trying to control for demographic\ndifferences there are some experiences that cannot be\nseparated from culture (Matsumoto and Luang, 2013). For\nexample, being Catholic in the United States does not have\nthe same meaning as being Catholic in Japan or Brazil.\nResearchers must consider the experiences of the sample in\naddition to basic demographic information.\n82 | Sampling Bias Procedural Bias\nAnother type of methodological bias is procedural bias, which\nis sometimes referred to as administration bias. This type of\nbias is related to the study conditions including the setting\nand how the instruments are administered across cultures (He,\n2010). The interaction between the research participant and\ninterviewer is another type of procedural bias that can interfere\nwith cultural comparisons.\nSetting\nWhere the study is conducted can have a major influence on\nhow the data is collected, analyzed and later interpreted.\nSettings can be small (e.g., home or community center) or\nsettings can be large (e.g., countries or regions) and can\ninfluence how a survey is administered or how participants\nmight respond. In a large cross-cultural health study Steels and\ncolleagues (2014) found that the postal system in Vietnam was\nunreliable and demanded a major, and unexpected, change in\nsurvey methodology. The researchers were forced to use more\nparticipants from urban areas than rural areas as a result of\nthese challenges. Harzing and Reiche (2013) found that their\nonline survey was blocked in China due to internet censoring\npractices of the Chinese government but with minor changes\nit was later made available for administering.\nProcedural Bias | 83 Problems with infrastructure and services may limit research\nparticipation. [Image By tomcatgeorge (Mail Delivery Taiwan) [CC BY\n2.0 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Taiwan_Mail_Delivery.jpg]\nInstrument Administration\nIn addition to the setting, how the data is collected (e.g., paper-\nand-pencil mode versus online survey) may influence different\nlevels of social desirability and response rates. Dwight and\nFeigelson (2000) completed a meta-analysis of computerized\ntesting on socially desirable responding and found that\nimpression management (one dimension of social desirability)\nwas lower in online assessment. The impact was small but it\ndoes have broad implications for how results are interpreted\nand compared across cultural groups when testing occurs\nonline.\n84 | Procedural Bias How you take a survey or test may influence how you respond to\ncertain types of questions. [Image by Mr Stein Open Cheat CC-NC-SA\n2.0 https://www.flickr.com/photos/5tein/2348649408]\nHarzing and Reiche (2013) found that paper/pencil surveys\nwere overwhelmingly preferred by their participants, a sample\nof international human resource managers, and had much\nhigher response rates when compared to the online survey. It\nis important to note that online survey response rates were\nlikely higher in Japan and Korea largely because of difficulties\nin photocopying and mailing paper versions of the survey.\nInterviewer and Interviewee Issues\nThe interviewer effect can easily occur when there are\ncommunication problems between interviewers and\ninterviewees, especially, when they have different first\nlanguages and cultural backgrounds (van de Vijver and Tanzer,\n2003). Interviewers, not familiar with cultural norms and values\nProcedural Bias | 85 may unintentionally offend participants or colleagues or\ncompromise the integrity of the study.\nAn example of the interviewer effect was summarized by\nDavis and Silver (2003). The researchers found that when\nanswering questions regarding political knowledge, African\nAmerican respondents got fewer answers right when\ninterviewed by a European American interviewer than by an\nAfrican American interviewer. Administration conditions that\ncan lead to bias should be taken into consideration before\nbeginning the research and researchers should exercise\ncaution when interpreting and generalizing results.\nA translator or interpreter can unintentionally change a question that\nmay change how a participant responds [Image by daveynin CC-BY\n2.0]\nUsing a translator is not a guarantee that interviewer bias will\nbe reduced. Translators may unintentionally change the intent\nof a question or item by omitting, revising or reducing content.\nThese language changes can alter the intent or nuance of a\n86 | Procedural Bias survey item (Berman, 2011), which will alter the answer provided\nby the participant.\nProcedural Bias | 87 Instrument Bias\nA final type of method bias is called instrument bias but it does\nnot have anything to do with the instrument, survey or test but\nrather refers to the experience and familiarity of the participant\nwith test taking. There are two main types of instrument bias\ndiscussed in cross-cultural research (He, 2012), familiarity with\nthe type of test (e.g., cognitive versus educational) and\nfamiliarity with response methods (e.g., multiple choice or\nrating scales).\nDemetriou and colleagues describe an example of familiarity\nwith test type (2005) when they compared Chinese and Greek\nchildren on visual-spatial tasks. The researchers found that\nChinese children outperformed Greek children on the task but\nnot because of cultural differences in visual spatial\nperformance but because writing Chinese is a visual spatial\ntask. Chinese children performed better because learning to\nwrite (in all cultures) requires practice and writing in Chinese\nlanguage is a highly visual spatial task.\n88 | Instrument Bias Using a scantron assumes participants use the same letter system\n[Image by By lecroitg [CC0, via Wikimedia Commons\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Test-986769_640.jpg]\nAn example of how instrument bias can be reduced comes\nfrom a study that included Zambian and British children\n(Serpell, 1979). The children were asked to reproduce a pattern\nusing several different types of response method including\npaper-and-pencil, plasticine, configurations of hand positions,\nand iron wire. The British children scored significantly higher\non the paper-and-pencil method while the Zambians scored\nhigher when iron wires were utilized (Serpell, 1979). These\nresults make sense within cultural contexts. Paper pencil\ntesting is a common experience in formal, Western education\nsystems and making models with iron wire was a popular\npastime among Zambian children. By using different response\nmethods (i.e., paper/pencil, iron wire) the researchers were able\nInstrument Bias | 89 to separate performance from bias related to response\nmethods.\nAnother issue related to instrument bias is response bias,\nwhich is the systematic tendency to respond in a certain way\nto items or questions. There are many things that may lead to\nresponse bias including how survey questions are phrased, the\ndemeanor of the researcher, or the desire of the participant to\nbe a good participant and provide \u201cthe right\u2019 answers. There are\nthree common types of response bias:\nSocially desirable responding (SDR) is the tendency to\nrespond in a way that makes you look good. Studies that\nexamine sensitive topics (e.g., sexuality, sexual behaviors, and\nmental health) or behaviors that violate social norms (e.g.,\nfetishes, binge drinking, smoking and drug use) are particularly\nsusceptible to SDR.\nAcquiescence bias is the tendency to agree rather than\ndisagree with items on a questionnaire. It can also mean\nagreeing with statements when you are unsure or in doubt.\nStudies have consistently shown that acquiescence response\nbias occurs more frequently among participants from low\nsocioeconomic status and from collectivistic cultures (Harzing,\n2006; Smith & Fischer, 2008). Additionally, work by Ross and\nMirowsky (1984) found that Mexicans were more likely to\nengage in acquiescence and socially desirable responding\nthan European Americans on a survey about mental health.\n90 | Instrument Bias Understanding the response method [Image by sthenstudio:\nStar ratings CC0 https://pixabay.com/en/\nratings-stars-quality-best-ranking-1482011/]\nExtreme response bias is the tendency to use the ends of the\nscale (all high or all low values) regardless of what the item\nis asking or measuring. A demonstration of extreme response\nbias can be found in the work of Hui and Triandis (1989). These\nauthors found that Hispanics tended to choose extremes on\na five-point rating scale more often than did European\nAmericans although no significant cross-cultural differences\nwere found for 10-point scales.\nInstrument Bias | 91 Interpretation Bias\nOne problem with cross-cultural studies is that they are\nvulnerable to ethnocentric bias. This means that the\nresearcher who designs the study might be influenced by\npersonal biases that could affect research outcomes, without\neven being aware of it. For example, a study on happiness\nacross cultures might investigate the ways that personal\nfreedom is associated with feeling a sense of purpose in life.\nThe researcher might assume that when people are free to\nchoose their own work and leisure, they are more likely to pick\noptions they care deeply about. Unfortunately, this researcher\nmight overlook the fact that in much of the world it is\nconsidered important to sacrifice some personal freedom in\norder to fulfill one\u2019s duty to the group (Triandis, 1995). Because\nof the danger of this type of bias, cultural psychologists must\ncontinue to improve their methodology.\nAnother problem with cross-cultural studies is that they are\nsusceptible to cultural attribution fallacy. This happens when\nthe researcher concludes that there are real cultural\ndifferences between groups without any actual support for this\nconclusion. Yoo (2013) explains that, if a researcher concludes\nthat two countries are different based on a psychological\nconstruct because one country is an individualistic (I) culture\nand the other is a collectivistic (C) culture, without connecting\ndifferences to IC, then the researcher has made a cultural\nattribution fallacy.\n92 | Interpretation Bias Ethics in Cultural\nPsychological Research\nResearch, whether indigenous or cross-cultural, must be\nconducted ethically. The American Psychological Association\n(APA) has created a set of common ethical principles and\nshared standards to guide the professional and scientific\nresponsibilities of psychologists. A major goal of the principles\nand code of conduct is to educate professionals in psychology,\nstudents, colleagues, patients and members of the public\nabout the ethical standards of the field. The ethical principles\ninclude:\n\u2022 Beneficience and non-maleficence\n\u2022 Fidelity & responsibility\n\u2022 Integrity\n\u2022 Justice\n\u2022 Respect for people\u2019s\nPsychological researchers agree that good research is ethical\nand is guided by a basic respect for human dignity and safety.\nUnfortunately, this has not always been the case. One notable\nexample of unethical research in the United States was the\nTuskegee syphilis study conducted by the US Public Health\nService from 1932 to 1972 (Reverby, 2009).\nEthics in Cultural Psychological\nResearch | 93 Unethical medical research conducted by the United States\ngovernment on African American men has left lasting distrust of\nmedical research and contributes to lower participation rates of\nmembers in the African American community. [Image courtesy of\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention/Released Public Domain:\nhttps://www.jble.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2000114936/]\nThe participants in this study were poor African American men\nin the vicinity of Tuskegee, Alabama, who were told that they\nwere being treated for \u201cbad blood.\u201d Although they were given\nsome free medical care, they were not told they had syphilis\nand were not treated for the disease. Instead, they were\nobserved to see how the disease would develop and progress\nin untreated patients. Even after the use of penicillin became\nthe standard treatment for syphilis in the 1940s, these men\ncontinued to be denied treatment and were not given an\nopportunity to leave the study. It was eventually discontinued\nafter details were shared with the general public but negative\nconsequences of the study persist. Shaver et al (2000) found\nthat African-Americans had less trust in researchers and were\n94 | Ethics in Cultural Psychological Research less likely to participate in research as a result of the Tuskegee\nexperiment.\nToday, any experiment that involves human subjects is\ngoverned by extensive, strict guidelines designed to ensure\nthat the experiment does not result in harm to the participants.\nAny research institution in the United States that receives\nfederal support for research involving human participants\nmust have access to an institutional review board (IRB). The\nIRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members\nof the institution\u2019s administration, scientists, and community\nmembers.\nThe purpose of the IRB is to review research proposals that\ninvolve human participants. Psychologists must receive prior\napproval from an institutional research board (IRB) before\nbeginning any experiment. Among the most important\nprinciples protecting human subjects are:\nInformed consent states that people should know when\nthey are involved in research, and understand what will happen\nto them during the study (at least in general terms that do\nnot give away the hypothesis). Researchers conducting cultural\nor cross-cultural research should consider the possibility that\ninformed consent may not be a custom of the culture and the\nconcept may not be understood by the participants.\nVoluntary participation is the choice to participate, along\nwith the freedom to withdraw from the study at any time.\nCertain kinds of methods\u2014such as naturalistic observation in\npublic spaces, or archival research based on public records\u2014do\nnot require obtaining informed consent. Some cultures may\nnot recognize individual and autonomous choice to participate\nand involvement may be mandatory. Researchers should be\naware of how participation, voluntary or mandatory, may\ninfluence participant self-disclosure and responding.\nPrivacy encompasses two broad concepts, anonymity and\nconfidentiality. Researchers also may not identify individual\nparticipants in their research reports. Typically, psychologists\nEthics in Cultural Psychological Research | 95 and researchers report only group means and other statistics.\nWith online data collection becoming increasingly popular,\nresearchers also have to be mindful that they follow local data\nprivacy laws, collect only the data that they really need (e.g.,\navoiding including unnecessary questions in surveys), strictly\nrestrict access to the raw data, and have a plan to securely\ndestroy the data after it is no longer needed. Researchers\nshould not assume that the same protections of data privacy\nextend across cultures.\nRisks and Benefits are key elements of ethics in research\nand people who agree to participate in psychological studies\nshould be exposed to risk only if they fully understand the\nrisks and only if the likely benefits clearly outweigh those risks.\nResearchers wishing to investigate implicit prejudice using the\nIAT, need to be considerate of the consequences of providing\nfeedback to participants about their unconscious biases.\nSimilarly, any manipulations that could potentially provoke\nserious emotional reactions (culture of honor study described\nearlier) or relatively permanent changes in people\u2019s beliefs or\nbehaviors (e.g., attitudes towards vaccination) need to be\ncarefully reviewed by the IRB.\nDeception refers to the need for some research to deceive\nparticipants (e.g., using a cover story) to prevent participants\nfrom modifying their behavior in unnatural ways, especially in\nlaboratory or field experiments. In these instances, researchers\nmay hide the true nature of the study.\n96 | Ethics in Cultural Psychological Research The Asch conformity experiment, which investigated individual\nconformity, remains a classic example of a deception used in a\npsychological experiment. [Image: D-janous, http://goo.gl/KwuGGM,\nCC BY-SA 4.0, http://goo.gl/etijyD]\nFor example, when Asch recruited participants for his\nexperiments on conformity, he described it as being a study\nof visual spatial skills. Deception is typically only permitted (a)\nwhen the benefits of the study outweigh the risks, (b)\nparticipants are not reasonably expected to be harmed, (c) the\nresearch question cannot be answered without the use of\ndeception, and (d) participants are informed about the\ndeception as soon as possible, usually through debriefing.\nDeception studies may be approved in one culture or country\nbut researchers should not assume that deception studies are\npermissible or will be approved in all cultures.\nDebriefing is the process of informing research participants\nas soon as possible of the purpose of the study, revealing any\ndeceptions, and correcting any misconceptions they might\nEthics in Cultural Psychological Research | 97 have as a result of participating. Debriefing also involves\nminimizing harm that might have occurred. For example, an\nexperiment examining the effects of sad moods on charitable\nbehavior might involve inducing a sad mood in participants by\nhaving them think sad thoughts, watch a sad video, or listen\nto sad music. Debriefing would therefore be the time to return\nparticipants\u2019 moods to normal by having them think happy\nthoughts, watch a happy video, or listen to happy music.\n98 | Ethics in Cultural Psychological Research Other Issues in\nResearch\nThere are many psychological processes that are considered\nsensitive topics within specific cultural, social and political\ncontexts. Sensitive topics are anything considered private,\nstigmatizing or sacred to the participants or culture (McCosker,\nBarnard and Gerber, 2001). Western cultures tend to be more\nopen about discussing sensitive areas and researchers should\nbe aware of potential methodological issues and possible\nconsequences for participants who agree to the study.\nParticipating in research about sensitive topics may result in severe\nconsequences for research participants and may keep many people\nfrom participating. [Image by World Bank Photo Collection CC\nBY-NC-ND-2.0 https://www.flickr.com/photos/worldbank/1128198005]\nOther Issues in Research | 99 Sex, sexuality, sexual orientation and HIV/AIDS status are topics\nthat may limit participation but more importantly participants\nmay face imprisonment, sanctions (formal and informal) for\nacknowledging thoughts or behaviors that run contrary to\ncultural norms. Researchers must be aware of the cultural,\nsocial and political contexts of the cultures under study to\nmaintain the safety of participants all the while maintaining\nethical research practices. Additionally, researchers should not\nassume that data privacy and data protections extend to all\nindividuals across all cultures.\n100 | Other Issues in Research Chapter Review\nAs an immensely social species, we affect and influence each\nother in many ways, particularly through our interactions and\ncultural expectations, both conscious and unconscious.

At first glance, this behavior is\npuzzling: why would Pilar hide in exactly the same location\nwhere someone else was just found? Older children and adults\nrealize that it is best to hide in locations that have not been\nsearched before but young children do not have the same\ncognitive sophistication. But why not\u2026 and when do these\nabilities first develop?\nWe have learned in previous chapters what it means to study\nboth psychology and culture. Lifespan development examines\nthe factors that influence growth and change over the course\nof an individual\u2019s life, from conception to death. Human\ndevelopment is the interaction between our biology (nature)\nand our environment (nurture). For this chapter, we will add\nto previously discussed concepts to examine the role that\nenculturation plays in developing the human mind and\nfostering a unique sense of self.\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1. Define universal concepts of neuroplasticity and sensitive\nperiods of development and discuss how these concepts\nimpact lifespan growth.\n2. Define and contrast how the concepts of culture,\nsocialization and enculturation differ.\n3. Identify and describe how parents/caregivers serve as\nenculturation agents during development.\n4.

People\naren\u2019t born using chopsticks or being good at soccer simply\nbecause they have a genetic predisposition for it. They learn\nto excel at these activities because they are born in countries\nlike Argentina, where playing soccer is an important part of\ndaily life, or in countries like Taiwan, where chopsticks are the\nprimary eating utensils.\nEnculturation is our early learning about culture that we receive from\nour caregivers. [Culture is where we are from Image by David P\nHoward CC \u2013 SA \u2013 BY]\nSo, how are such cultural behaviors learned? It turns out that\ncultural skills and knowledge are learned in much the same\nway a person might learn to do algebra or knit. They are\nacquired through a combination of explicit teaching and\nimplicit learning\u2014 by observing and copying.\nDefining Enculturation | 109 Cultural teaching can take many forms. As discussed in\nChapter 2, social learning occurs when behavior is taught or\nmodeled to another. In child development, cultural shaping\nbegins with caretakers and their young. Caregivers teach kids,\nboth directly and by example, about how to behave and how\nthe world works. They encourage children to be polite,\nreminding them, for instance, to say \u201cThank you.\u201d They teach\nkids how to dress in a way that is appropriate for the culture.\nThey introduce children to religious beliefs and the rituals that\ngo with them. They even teach children how to think and feel!\nThis uniquely human form of learning, where the cultural tools\nfor success are passed from one generation to another, is what\nis known as enculturation.\nEnculturation and the Brain\nThe topic of genetic influences versus environmental\ninfluences on human development is often referred to as the,\n\u201cnature-nurture debate.\u201d It would be satisfying to be able to\nsay that nature\u2013nurture studies have given us conclusive and\ncomplete evidence about where traits come from, with some\ntraits clearly resulting from genetics and others almost entirely\nfrom environmental factors, such as childrearing practices and\npersonal will; but that is not the case. Instead, everything has\nturned out to have some footing in genetics. The message is\nclear: You can\u2019t leave genes out of the equation. Keep in mind\nthat no behavioral traits are completely inherited, so you can\u2019t\nleave the environment out altogether.\nCultural neuroscience is a field of research that focuses on\nthe interrelation between a human\u2019s cultural environment and\nneurobiological systems. Our brain works to interact and, in\nessence, learn from our environment beginning from the\nmoment of conception. Neural patterns form, are shaped and\nreshaped, continually through a process of feedback and\n110 | Defining Enculturation interaction with our world. Each person has periods of brain\ndevelopment (typically in early childhood) where this\nneurological wiring is acquired smoother and faster than at any\nother point of time in development.\nCultural neuroscience studies how culture, mind, and the brain\ninteract. [Public Domain Brain Neuron Nerve Cell\nhttps://www.maxpixel.net/Neuron-Brain-Nervous-System-\nNeurons-Nerve-Cell-2213009rain]\nResearch by Kitayama and Uskul (2011), along with others, has\nfound evidence to support that windows for pathway wiring in\nthe brain also occur for enculturation. In other words, cultural\nneuroscience investigates the way our brain is wired for\ncultural practices, values, and traditions through our early\nchildhood experiences. These pathways form naturally in the\nbrain and are then reinforced through feedback and repetition.\nKitayama and Salvador (2017) write that, \u201cculture is embrained.\u201d\nDefining Enculturation | 111 2. Enculturation\nAgents\nThink back to an emotional event you experienced as a child.\nHow did your parents react to you? Did your parents get\nfrustrated or criticize you? Did they act patiently and provide\nsupport and guidance? Did your parents provide lots of rules\nfor you or let you make decisions on your own? Why do you\nthink your parents behaved the way they did? Enculturation\nagents are individuals and institutions that serve a role in\nshaping individual adaptations to a specific culture to better\nensure growth and effectiveness.\nParents and caretakers are a primary enculturation agent\nfor their young. Psychologists have attempted to answer\nquestions about the influences on parents and understand\nwhy parents behave the way they do. Because parents are\ncritical to a child\u2019s development, a great deal of research has\nbeen focused on the impact that parents have on children.\nParenting is a complex process in which parents and children\ninfluence one another. There are many reasons that parents\nbehave the way they do.\nThe multiple influences on parenting are still being explored.\nBoth caretakers and their children bring unique personality\ntraits, characteristics, and habits to the parent-child dynamic\nthat ultimately impacts the child\u2019s development. Culture also\ninfluences parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although\npromoting the development of skills necessary to function\neffectively in one\u2019s community is a universal goal of parenting,\nthe specific skills necessary vary widely from culture to culture.\nParents have different goals for their children that partially\ndepend on their culture (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2008).\n112 | Enculturation Agents Figure 1. Influences on Parenting. [Image from Noba Project]\nDifferences in caretaking reflect differences in parenting goals,\nvalues, resources, and experiences. As previously stated, culture\nis learned. Regardless of the specific choices parents make, it\ncan be said that caretakers play a pivotal role in exposing a\nchild to early cultural learning. In fact, many researchers believe\nthat parents/caretakers serve as the single, most important\nenculturation agent in any child\u2019s life.\nWhile some parenting priorities are culturally universal\n(parents are expected to play a role in nurturing and raising\ntheir young), many more childrearing values and habits are\nculture-specific. Culture-specific influences on caretaking\nchoices can be subtle or overt, and promote a narrative of what\nparents \u201cought\u201d to do in order to successfully raise their\nchildren. For example, American parents are encouraged to\nenculturate a sense of independence and assertiveness in\nchildren, while Japanese parents prioritize self-control,\nemotional maturity, and interdependence (Bornstein, 2012).\nUndoubtedly, every society places expectations on caretakers\nas enculturation agents to raise their young in ways that\nEnculturation Agents | 113 promote culture-specific goals and expectations. This chapter\nwill focus on four areas of child development:\n\u2022 Temperament\n\u2022 Attachment\n\u2022 Parenting Styles\n\u2022 Cognition\n114 | Enculturation Agents Temperament\nIn psychology, temperament broadly refers to consistent\nindividual differences in behavior that are biologically based\nand are relatively independent of learning, system of values\nand attitudes. Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn began\nthe classic New York Longitudinal study in the early 1950s\nregarding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess & Birch, 1968).\nThe study focused on how temperamental qualities influence\nadjustment throughout life. Behaviors for each one of these\ntraits are on a continuum. If a child leans towards the high\nor low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The\nspecific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of sleeping and\neating patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of\nemotion, mood, distractibility, persistence and attention span,\nand sensory sensitivity.\nRedundancies between the categories have been found and\na reduced list is normally used by psychologists today. Thomas,\nChess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn (Thomas & Chess 1977) found\nthat many babies could be categorized into one of three\ngroups:\n\u2022 Easy\n\u2022 Difficult\n\u2022 Slow-to-warm-up\nTheir research showed that easy babies readily adapt to new\nexperiences, generally display positive moods and emotions\nand also have normal eating and sleeping patterns. Difficult\nbabies tend to be very emotional, irritable and fussy, and cry\na lot. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping\npatterns. Slow-to-warm-up babies have a low activity level, and\ntend to withdraw from new situations and people. They are\nTemperament | 115 slow to adapt to new experiences, but accept them after\nrepeated exposure.\nNot all children can be placed in one of these groups.\nApproximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the\n65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern,\nand 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its own\nstrength and weakness and one is not superior to another. An\nimportant aspect of the research of Thomas & Chess (1977)\nrelates to the interaction of child temperament with caretaker\npersonality and parenting style. They proposed that a \u201cmatch\u201d\nbetween the needs of child temperament with parental care\nwould enhance healthy development of self-regulation and the\nchild\u2019s sense of self. This important balance is known as\ngoodness-of-fit.\nTemperament and Culture\nThomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that these broad\npatterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable\nthrough childhood. These traits are also found in children\nacross all cultures. Thomas and Chess also studied\ntemperament and environment. One sample consisted of\nwhite middle-class families with high educational status and\nthe other was of Puerto Rican working-class families. They\nfound several differences. Parents of middle-class children\nwere more likely to report behavior problems before the age\nof nine and the children had sleep problems. This may be\nbecause children start preschool between the ages of three\nand four.\nDe Vries (1974) followed Masai (tribe in East Africa) infants\nand mothers for a number of years during a period of famine.\nThe researcher found that Masai infants who were more\ndemanding were more likely to survive during periods of\necological stress than infants who were more docile. The\n116 | Temperament researcher suggested that infants who were more aggressive\nand demanding \u2013 or in temperament terms more difficult \u2013\nwere more likely to be fed and to have their needs met than\ndocile infants who might have been easier to ignore. The\nfindings from these cross-cultural studies of temperament\ndemonstrate the interaction between ecology, temperament\nand culture can impact an individual.\nTemperament | 117 Attachment\nSome of the most rewarding experiences in people\u2019s lives\ninvolve the development and maintenance of close\nrelationships. Attachment refers to a deep and enduring\nemotional bond that connects one person to another across\ntime and space. For example, some of the greatest sources\nof joy involve falling in love, starting a family, being reunited\nwith distant loved ones, and sharing experiences with close\nothers. Not surprisingly, some of the most painful experiences\nin people\u2019s lives involve the disruption of important social\nbonds, such as separation from a spouse, losing a parent, or\nbeing abandoned by a loved one. Why do close relationships\nplay such a profound role in human experience? Attachment\ntheory is one approach to understanding the nature of close\nrelationships.\n118 | Attachment Close relationships are the fabric of society, and are integral to the\nmaintenance of our species. [Image by Rajesh Balouria Family\nParents Kids CC-0 https://pixabay.com/photos/\nfamily-parents-kid-child-mother-3641227/\nAttachment theory was originally developed in the 1940s by\nJohn Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst who was attempting to\nunderstand the intense distress experienced by infants who\nhad been separated from their parents. Bowlby (1969) observed\nthat infants would go to extraordinary lengths to prevent\nseparation from their parents or to reestablish proximity to\na missing parent. For example, he noted that children who\nhad been separated from their parents would often cry, call\nfor their parents, refuse to eat or play, and stand at the door\nin desperate anticipation of their parents\u2019 return. Drawing on\nevolutionary theory, Bowlby (1969) argued that these behaviors\nare adaptive responses to separation from a primary\nattachment figure\u2014a caregiver who provides support,\nprotection, and care.\nIt was not until his colleague, Mary Ainsworth, began to\nsystematically study infant\u2013 parent separations that a formal\nAttachment | 119 understanding of these individual differences emerged.\nAinsworth and her students developed a technique called the\nstrange situation, a laboratory task for studying infant, parent\nattachment (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). In the\nstrange situation, 12-month-old infants and their parents are\nbrought to the laboratory and, over a period of approximately\n20 minutes, were systematically separated from and reunited\nwith one another. In the strange situation, most children\n(about 60%) behave in the way implied by Bowlby\u2019s theory.\nSpecifically, they become upset when the parent leaves the\nroom, but, when he or she returns, they actively seek the parent\nand are easily comforted by him or her. Children who exhibit\nthis pattern of behavior are often called secure.\nOther children (about 20% or less) are ill at ease initially and,\nupon separation, become extremely distressed. Importantly,\nwhen reunited with their parents, these children have a\ndifficult time being soothed and often exhibit conflicting\nbehaviors that suggest they want to be comforted, but that\nthey also want to \u201cpunish\u201d the parent for leaving. These\nchildren are often called anxious-resistant. The third pattern of\nattachment that Ainsworth and her colleagues documented is\noften labeled avoidant. Avoidant children (about 20%) do not\nconsistently behave as if they are stressed by the separation\nbut, upon reunion, actively avoid seeking contact with their\nparent, sometimes turning their attention to play objects on\nthe laboratory floor.\nAinsworth\u2019s work was important for at least three reasons.\nFirst, she provided one of the first empirical demonstrations of\nhow attachment behavior is organized in unfamiliar contexts.\nSecond, she provided the first empirical taxonomy of individual\ndifferences in infant attachment patterns. According to her\nresearch, at least three types of children exist: those who are\nsecure in their relationship with their parents, those who are\nanxious-resistant, and those who are anxious-avoidant. Finally,\nshe demonstrated that these individual differences were\n120 | Attachment correlated with infant\u2013parent interactions in the home during\nthe first year of life. Children who appear secure in the strange\nsituation, for example, tend to have parents who are responsive\nto their needs. Children who appear insecure in the strange\nsituation (i.e., anxious-resistant or avoidant) often have parents\nwho are insensitive to their needs, or inconsistent or rejecting\nin the care they provide.\nAttachment and Culture\nIn the years that have followed Ainsworth\u2019s ground-breaking\nresearch, researchers have investigated a variety of factors that\nmay help determine whether children develop secure or\ninsecure relationships with their primary attachment figures.\nAs mentioned above, one of the key determinants of\nattachment patterns is the history of sensitive and responsive\ninteractions between the caregiver and the child. In short,\nwhen the child is uncertain or stressed, the ability of the\ncaregiver to provide support to the child is critical for his or her\npsychological development. It is assumed that such supportive\ninteractions help the child learn to regulate his or her emotions,\ngive the child the confidence to explore the environment, and\nprovide the child with a safe haven during stressful\ncircumstances.\nA number of longitudinal studies are emerging that\ndemonstrate prospective associations between early\nattachment experiences and adult attachment styles and/or\ninterpersonal functioning in adulthood. For example, Fraley,\nRoisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013) found in\na sample of more than 700 individuals studied from infancy\nto adulthood that maternal sensitivity across development\nprospectively predicted security at age 18.\nSimpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon (2007) found that\nattachment security, assessed in infancy in the strange\nAttachment | 121 situation, predicted peer competence in grades 1 to 3, which,\nin turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at age\n16,which, in turn, predicted the expression of positive and\nnegative emotions in their adult romantic relationships at ages\n20 to 23.\nIt is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken\nassumption that early experiences \u201cdetermine\u201d later outcomes.\nTo be clear, attachment theorists assume that the relationship\nbetween early experiences and subsequent outcomes is\nprobabilistic, not deterministic. What this means is that having\nsupportive and responsive experiences with caregivers early in\nlife may set the stage for positive social development, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that attachment patterns are set in stone. Even\nif an individual has far from optimal caretaker experiences in\nearly life, attachment theory suggests that it is possible for\nthat individual to develop well-functioning adult relationships\nthrough a number of corrective experiences, including\nrelationships with siblings, other family members, teachers,\nand close friends.\nSecurity is best viewed as a culmination of a person\u2019s\nattachment history rather than a reflection of his or her early\nexperiences alone. Those early experiences are considered\nimportant not because they determine a person\u2019s fate, but\nbecause they provide the foundation for later experiences.\nIt is essential to note that the attachment theory work of\nBowlby and Ainsworth focused on Westernized caretaking\nideals in their determination of healthy, secure attachment. As\npreviously discussed, what is considered \u201cideal\u201d in Westernized\nculture is not necessarily prioritized in other cultures. Sensitivity\nand caution is required in determining if observed attachment\npatterns are adaptive within the context of the child\u2019s\nenvironment.\n122 | Attachment Parenting Styles\nAs children mature, parent-child relationships naturally\nchange. Preschool and grade-school children are more\ncapable, have their own preferences, and sometimes refuse or\nseek to compromise with parental expectations. This can lead\nto greater parent-child conflict, and how conflict is managed by\nparents further shapes the quality of parent-child relationships.\nSo, what can parents do to nurture a healthy self-concept?\nThe quality of our relationship with early caregivers has an effect on\nlater psychological and social development. Mothers Love [Image by\nPremnath Thirumalaisamy CC BY \u2013 NC https://www.flickr.com/photos/\npremnath/22998680924]\nDiana Baumrind (1971, 1991) thinks parenting style may be a\nfactor. The way we parent is an important factor in a child\u2019s\nsocioemotional growth. Baumrind developed and refined a\nParenting Styles | 123 theory describing parenting styles based on two aspects of\nparenting that are found to be extremely important:\n\u2022 Parental responsiveness, which refers to the degree the\nparent responds to the child\u2019s needs.\n\u2022 Parental demandingness, is the extent to which the\nparent expects more mature and responsible behavior\nfrom a child.\nUsing these two dimensions, she recognized three different\nparenting styles:\nAuthoritarian (Too Hard): the authoritarian parenting style\nis characterized by high demandingness with low\nresponsiveness. The authoritarian parent is rigid, harsh, and\ndemanding. Abusive parents usually fall in this category\n(although Baumrind is careful to emphasize that not all\nauthoritarian parents are abusive).\nPermissive (Too Soft): this parenting style is characterized by\nlow demandingness with high responsiveness. The permissive\nparent is overly responsive to the child\u2019s demands, seldom\nenforcing consistent rules. The \u201cspoiled\u201d child often has\npermissive parents.\nAuthoritative (Just Right): this parenting style is\ncharacterized by high demandingness with huge\nresponsiveness. The authoritative parent is firm but not rigid,\nwilling to make an exception when the situation warrants. The\nauthoritative parent is responsive to the child\u2019s needs but not\nindulgent. Baumrind makes it clear that she favors the\nauthoritative style.\n124 | Parenting Styles Table 1. Comparison of four parenting styles.\nParenting Styles and Culture\nOf the four parenting styles, the authoritative style is the one\nthat is most encouraged in modern American society.\nAmerican children raised by authoritative parents tend to have\nhigh self-esteem and social skills; however, effective parenting\nstyles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points\nout, the authoritative style is not necessarily preferred or\nappropriate in all cultures. In contrast to the authoritative style,\nauthoritarian parents probably would not relax bedtime rules\nduring a vacation because they consider the rules to be set,\nand they expect obedience. This style can create anxious,\nwithdrawn, and unhappy kids. It is important to point out that\nauthoritarian parenting is as beneficial as the authoritative\nstyle in some ethnic groups (Russell, Crockett, & Chao, 2010).\nFor instance, first-generation Chinese American children raised\nby authoritarian parents did just as well in school as their peers\nwho were raised by authoritative parents (Russell et al., 2010).\nNot surprisingly, children raised by permissive parents tend\nParenting Styles | 125 to lack self-discipline, and the permissive parenting style is\nnegatively associated with grades (Dornbusch, Ritter,\nLeiderman, Roberts, & Fraleigh, 1987).\nThe permissive style may also contribute to other risky\nbehaviors such as alcohol abuse (Bahr & Hoffman, 2010), risky\nsexual behavior especially among female children (Donenberg,\nWilson, Emerson, & Bryant, 2002), and increased display of\ndisruptive behaviors by male children (Parent et al., 2011). There\nare some positive outcomes associated with children raised\nby permissive parents. They tend to have higher self- esteem,\nbetter social skills, and report lower levels of depression\n(Darling, 1999).\n126 | Parenting Styles Cognitive\nDevelopment\nBy the time you reach adulthood you have learned a few things\nabout how the world works. You know, for instance, that you\ncan\u2019t walk through walls or leap into the tops of trees. You know\nthat although you cannot see your car keys they\u2019ve got to be\naround here someplace. What\u2019s more, you know that if you\nwant to communicate complex ideas like ordering a triple-shot\nsoy vanilla latte with chocolate sprinkles it\u2019s better to use words\nwith meanings attached to them rather than simply gesturing\nand grunting. People accumulate all this useful knowledge\nthrough the process of cognitive development, which involves\na multitude of factors, both inherent and learned.\nStage theories of development, such as Piaget\u2019s stage theory,\nfocus on whether children progress through qualitatively\ndifferent stages of development. Sociocultural theories, such\nas that of Lev Vygotsky, emphasize how other people and the\nattitudes, values, and beliefs of the surrounding culture,\ninfluence children\u2019s development.\nSwiss psychologist Jean Piaget proposed that children\u2019s\nthinking progresses through a series of four discrete stages.\nBy stages he meant periods during which children reasoned\nin the same way about many superficially different problems,\nwith the stages occurring in a fixed order and the thinking\nwithin different stages differing in fundamental ways. The four\nstages that Piaget hypothesized were the sensorimotor stage\n(birth to 2 years), the preoperational reasoning stage (2 to 6 or\n7 years), the concrete operational reasoning stage (6 or 7 to 11\nor 12 years), and the formal operational reasoning stage (11 or 12\nyears and throughout the rest of life).\nCognitive Development | 127 Figure 1. Stages of Cognitive Development Courtesy of Noba Project\nDuring the sensorimotor stage, children\u2019s thinking is largely\nrealized through their perceptions of the world and their\nphysical interactions with it. Their mental representations are\nvery limited. Consider Piaget\u2019s object permanence task, which\nis one of his most famous problems. If an infant younger than 9\nmonths of age is playing with a favorite toy, and another person\nremoves the toy from view, for example by putting it under an\nopaque cover and not letting the infant immediately reach for\nit, the infant is very likely to make no effort to retrieve it and\nto show no emotional distress (Piaget, 1954). This is not due to\ntheir being uninterested in the toy or unable to reach for it; if\nthe same toy is put under a clear cover, infants below 9 months\nreadily retrieve it (Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, & Siegler,\n1997). Instead, Piaget claimed that infants less than 9 months\ndo not understand that objects continue to exist. This is called\nobject permanence.\nDuring the preoperational stage, according to Piaget,\nchildren can solve not only this simple problem (which they\nactually can solve after 9 months) but show a wide variety\nof other symbolic-representation capabilities, such as those\ninvolved in drawing and using language. However, such 2- to\n7-year-olds tend to focus on a single dimension, even when\n128 | Cognitive Development solving problems would require them to consider multiple\ndimensions. This is evident in Piaget\u2019s (1952) conservation\nproblems. For example, if a glass of water is poured into a\ntaller, thinner glass, children below age 7 generally say that\nthere now is more water than before. Similarly, if a clay ball\nis reshaped into a long, thin sausage, they claim that there\nis now more clay, and if a row of coins is spread out, they\nclaim that there are now more coins. In all cases, the children\nare focusing on one dimension, while ignoring the changes in\nother dimensions (for example, the greater width of the glass\nand the clay ball).\nChildren overcome this tendency to focus on a single\ndimension during the concrete operations stage, and think\nlogically in most situations. However, according to Piaget, they\nstill cannot think in systematic scientific ways, even when such\nthinking would be useful. Thus, if asked to find out which\nvariables influence the period that a pendulum takes to\ncomplete its arc, and given weights that they can attach to\nstrings in order to do experiments with the pendulum to find\nout, most children younger than age 12, perform biased\nexperiments from which no conclusion can be drawn, and then\nconclude that whatever they originally believed is correct. For\nexample, if a boy believed that weight was the only variable\nthat mattered, he might put the heaviest weight on the\nshortest string and push it the hardest, and then conclude that\njust as he thought, weight is the only variable that matters\n(Inhelder & Piaget, 1958).\nFinally, in the formal operations period, children attain the\nreasoning power of mature adults, which allows them to solve\nthe pendulum problem and a wide range of other problems.\nThe formal operations stage tends not to occur without\nexposure to formal education in scientific reasoning, and\nappears to be largely or completely absent from some societies\nthat do not provide this type of education.\nCognitive Development | 129 Cognitive Development and Culture\nAlthough Piaget\u2019s theory has been very influential, it has not\ngone unchallenged. Recent research indicates that cognitive\ndevelopment is considerably more continuous than Piaget\nclaimed. For example, Diamond (1985) found that on the object\npermanence task described above, infants show earlier\nknowledge if the waiting period is shorter. At age 6 months,\nthey retrieve the hidden object if the wait is no longer than 2\nseconds; at 7 months, they retrieve it if the wait is no longer\nthan 4 seconds; and so on. Even earlier, at 3 or 4 months, infants\nshow surprise in the form of longer looking times if objects\nsuddenly appear to vanish with no obvious cause (Baillargeon,\n1987).\nSimilarly, children\u2019s specific experiences can greatly influence\nwhen developmental changes occur. Children of pottery\nmakers in Mexican villages, for example, know that reshaping\nclay does not change the amount of clay at much younger\nages than children who do not have similar experiences (Price-\nWilliams, Gordon, & Ramirez, 1969). In a study of tribal children\n(Inuit of Canada, Baoul of Africa and Aranda of Australia)\nresearchers found differences in the ages at which children\nreached certain stages and acquired certain skills (Dasen, 1975).\nAbout 50% of the Inuit children solved a visual spatial test by\nthe age of 7, 50% of the Aranda children solved the same task\nby the age of 9; however the Baoul children did not solve the\ntask until the age of 12. On a conservation task the ages of\nskill acquisition reversed. The differences seem related to the\nliving environment of the children \u2013 the Baoul children lived\nin permanent settlements while the Inuit and Aranda tribes\nare nomadic. Demands of daily life shape the cognitive\ndevelopment and different societies\u2019 value and reward\ndifferent skills and behaviors.\nA main figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget\u2019s ideas was\nthe Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky stressed the\n130 | Cognitive Development importance of a child\u2019s cultural background as an effect on\nthe stages of development. Because different cultures stress\ndifferent social interactions, this challenged Piaget\u2019s theory\nthat the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in\nsuccession. Vygotsky introduced the term Zone of Proximal\nDevelopment as an overall task a child would have to develop\nthat would be too difficult to develop alone.\nOverall, Piaget\u2019s theories are widely recognized as making\nkey contributions to the field of child development and helped\npave the way for further empirical study. Cross-cultural testing\nhas challenged many of his ideas, but the overall hierarchy of\nstages and sub-stages in cognitive development appears to\nbe universal. Timing, ages, and capabilities during each stage\nappear to vary according to cultural context and enculturation\npatterns.\nCognitive Development | 131 Other Enculturation\nAgents\nEcological Systems Theory\nContextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood, school,\nand social networks, also affect enculturation, even though\nthese settings don\u2019t always include both the child and the\nparent (Brofenbrenner, 1989). For example, Latina mothers who\nperceived the neighborhood as more dangerous showed less\nwarmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater\nstress associated with living in a threatening environment\n(Gonzales et al., 2011). Urie Bronfenbrenner was a Russian-born\nAmerican developmental psychologist who is known for his\necological systems theory of child development. His scientific\nwork and his assistance to the United States government\nhelped in the formation of the Head Start program in 1965.\n132 | Other Enculturation Agents Figure 1. Contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood,\nschool, and social networks, also affect enculturation. [Image by\nHchokr https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Bronfenbrenner%27s_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(E\nnglish).jpg].\nBronfenbrenner\u2019s research and his theory was key in changing\nthe perspective of developmental psychology by calling\nattention to the large number of environmental and societal\ninfluences on child development. Bronfenbrenner saw the\nprocess of human development as being shaped by the\ninteraction between an individual and his or her environment.\nThe specific path of development was a result of the influences\nof a person\u2019s surroundings, such as their parents, friends,\nschool, work, culture, and so on.\nAccording to Melvin L. Kohn, a sociologist from Johns\nOther Enculturation Agents | 133 Hopkins University, Bronfenbrenner was critical in making\nsocial scientists realize that, \u201c\u2026interpersonal relationships, even\n[at] the smallest level of the parent-child relationship, did not\nexist in a social vacuum but were embedded in the larger social\nstructures of community, society, economics and politics.\u201d\nPeer and Sibling Relationships\nParent-child relationships are not the only significant\nrelationships in a child\u2019s life. Peer relationships are also\nimportant. Social interaction with another child who is similar\nin age, skills, and knowledge provokes the development of\nmany social skills that are valuable for the rest of life (Bukowski,\nBuhrmester, & Underwood, 2011). In peer relationships, children\nlearn how to initiate and maintain social interactions with other\nchildren. They learn skills for managing conflict, such as turn-\ntaking, compromise, and bargaining. Play also involves the\nmutual, sometimes complex, coordination of goals, actions,\nand understanding. For example, as infants, children get their\nfirst encounter with sharing (of each other\u2019s toys); during\npretend play as preschoolers they create narratives together,\nchoose roles, and collaborate to act out their stories; and in\nprimary school, they may join a sports team, learning to work\ntogether and support each other emotionally and strategically\ntoward a common goal. Through these experiences, children\ndevelop friendships that provide additional sources of security\nand support to those provided by their parents.\nPeer relationships can be challenging as well as supportive\n(Rubin, Coplan, Chen, Bowker, & McDonald, 2011). Being\naccepted by other children is an important source of\naffirmation and self-esteem, but peer rejection can foreshadow\nlater behavior problems (especially when children are rejected\ndue to aggressive behavior). With increasing age, children\nconfront the challenges of bullying, peer victimization, and\n134 | Other Enculturation Agents managing conformity pressures. Social comparison with peers\nis an important means by which children evaluate their skills,\nknowledge, and personal qualities, but it may cause them to\nfeel that they do not measure up well against others. Also,\nwith the approach of adolescence, peer relationships become\nfocused on psychological intimacy, involving personal\ndisclosure, vulnerability, and loyalty (or its betrayal)\u2014which\nsignificantly affects a child\u2019s outlook on the world. Each of\nthese aspects of peer relationships requires developing very\ndifferent social and emotional skills than those that emerge in\nparent- child relationships. They also illustrate the many ways\nthat peer relationships influence the growth of personality and\nself-concept.\nEducation\nAs previously stated, caretakers serve the role of being primary\nenculturation agents of their young in any given society. If\nparents serve as the #1 enculturation agent, education would\nlikely be the second most important source of enculturation for\nany child.\nEducation is the process of facilitating learning, or the\nacquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.\nEducational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching,\ntraining, and directed research. Education frequently takes\nplace under the guidance of educators, but learners may also\neducate themselves. Education can take place in formal or\ninformal settings and any experience that has a formative\neffect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered\neducational.\nCulture, education, and society are all interconnected\nconcepts that work to enculturate a child. Education models\nare based on the ideals and principles of society, and then its\neducated citizens go on to become influencers of that society\u2019s\nOther Enculturation Agents | 135 culture. Researchers Markus and Kitayama (2010) refer to the\nsystemic influence of culture and self as mutual constitution,\nand point out that individuals are simultaneously being shaped\nby culture while also influencing it. Regardless of the method\nof education, schooling serves as both a reflection of the\npriorities and values of that society, while also enculturating\nits young to contribute to that culture. For example, core\nAmerican values of competition, choice, and independence\ncan be seen in the way we structure our formal education\nsystem. Parents and students often expect to play a role in\nchoosing curriculum, classes and competition for academic\nand athletic status is expected within schools. Similarly, in the\nUnited States the government dictates larger educational\ngoals and resources, while state and local districts pass\nmandates based on the democratic wishes of larger society. In\ncontrast to Westernized systems of education, many East Asian\neducation models are based on uniform standards of academic\nrigor, student conformity, and respect for authority.\n136 | Other Enculturation Agents Chapter Review\nThe process of human development and enculturation is\ncomplex. Our caretakers and method of schooling serve as two\nof the most important enculturation agents during childhood.\nDifferences in childrearing choices, traditions, and expectations\nreflect differences in values and priorities. Developmental\nfactors of goodness-of-fit, attachment, parenting styles, and\ncognition work to shape a child\u2019s physical and psychological\nhealth in culturally diverse ways. There are universal and\nbiological factors (temperament and intelligence), as well as\nculturally-specific factors that influence our relationships in\nadulthood.

The key\nword re-presentation implies that the world is first presented\nto us, and we then organize the information into new or already\n140 | Culture and Cognition existing representations or schemas. We never experience the\nworld that exists outside of our brain in a perfect, objective,\nor pure way. Instead, our representation of the world relies on\nsubjective and imperfect processes including sensation,\nperception, attention, memory, thinking, judging and problem\nsolving. We will cover many of these concepts in the chapter.\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1. Compare and contrast sensation, attention and\nperception\n2.

Sensation happens when you eat noodles or\nfeel the wind on your face or hear a car horn honking in the\ndistance. During sensation, our sense organs are engaging\nin transduction, the conversion of one form of energy into\nanother. For example, physical energy such as light or a sound\nwave is converted into a form of electrical energy that the brain\ncan understand.\nPerception\nAfter our brain receives the electrical signals we make sense\nof all this stimulation and begin to appreciate the complex\nworld around us. This psychological process, making sense of\nthe stimuli, is called perception. It is during this process that\nyou are able to identify a gas leak in your home, recognize the\ncolor orange, or connect a song that reminds you of a specific\nafternoon spent with friends. Perception is the process of\nSensation and Perception | 143 interpreting and organizing the information that we received\nfrom our senses.\nOur experience influences how our brain processes\ninformation. You have tasted food that you like and food that\nyou don\u2019t like. There are some bands you enjoy and others you\ncan\u2019t stand. When eat something new or hear a new band,\nyou process those stimuli using bottom-up processing. This is\nwhen we build up to perception from the individual pieces.\nSometimes stimuli we\u2019ve experienced in our past will\ninfluence how we process new ones. This is called top-down\nprocessing. The best way to illustrate these two concepts is\nwith our ability to read.\nRead the following quote out loud:\nFigure 1. Read the following quote for an example of top \u2013 down\nprocessing.\nNotice anything odd while you were reading the text in the\n144 | Sensation and Perception triangle? Did you notice the second \u201cthe\u201d? If not, it\u2019s likely\nbecause you were reading this from a top-down approach.\nHaving a second \u201cthe\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. We know this and\nour brain knows this and doesn\u2019t expect there to be a second\none, so we tend to skip right over it. In other words, your past\nexperience has changed the way you perceive the writing in\nthe triangle. Someone who is just learning to read is using a\nbottom-up approach by carefully attending to each piece and\nwould be less likely to make this error.\nSensation and Perception | 145 Attention\nAttention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively\nconcentrating on one thing in our environment while ignoring\nother distractions. Attention is a limited resource. This means\nthat your brain can only devote attention to a limited number\nof stimuli (things in the environment). Despite what you may\nbelieve, we are terrible multi-taskers. Research shows that\nwhen multitasking, people make more mistakes or perform\ntheir tasks more slowly. Each task increases cognitive load (the\namount of information our brain has to process) and our\nattention must be divided among all of the tasks to perform\nthem. This is why it takes more time to finish something when\nwe are multitasking.\nMany aspects of attention have been studied in the field\nof psychology. In some respects, we define different types of\nattention by the nature of the task used to study it. For\nexample, a crucial issue in World War II was how long an\nindividual could remain highly alert and accurate while\nwatching a radar screen for enemy planes, and this problem\nled psychologists to study how attention works under such\nconditions. Research results found that when watching for a\nrare event, it is easy to allow concentration to lag. This\ncontinues to be a challenge today for TSA agents, charged with\nlooking at images of the contents of your carry-on luggage in\nsearch of knives, guns, or shampoo bottles larger than 3 oz.\nCulture can also influence and shape how we attend to the\nworld around us. Masuda and Nisbett (2001) asked American\nand Japanese students to describe what they saw in images\nlike the one shown below. They found that while both groups\ntalked about the most salient objects (the fish, which were\nbrightly colored and swimming around), the Japanese\nstudents also tended to talk and remember more about the\n146 | Attention images in the background (they remembered the frog and the\nplants as well as the fish).\nThis image was used to identify cultural differences in perception and\nhow different cultures attend holistically versus analytically to the\nenvironment and surroundings.\nNorth Americans and Western Europeans in these types of\nstudies were more likely to pay attention to salient and central\nparts of the pictures, while Japanese, Chinese, and South\nKoreans were more likely to consider the context as a whole.\nThe researchers described this as holistic perception and\nanalytic perception.\nHolistic Perception: A pattern or perception characterized by\nprocessing information as a whole. This pattern makes it more\nlikely to pay attention to relationships among all elements.\nHolistic perception promotes holistic cognition: a tendency to\nunderstand the gist, the big idea, or the general meaning.\nAttention | 147 Eastern medicine is traditionally holistic; it emphasizes health\nin general terms as the result of the connection and balance\nbetween mind, body, and spirit.\nAnalytic Perception: A pattern of perception characterized\nby processing information as a sum of the parts. Analytic\nperception promotes analytic thinking: a tendency to\nunderstand the parts and details of a system. This pattern\nmakes it more likely to pay attention and remember salient,\ncentral, and individual elements. Western medicine is\ntraditionally analytic; it emphasizes specialized subdisciplines\nand it focuses on individual symptoms and body parts.\nFrom birth to adolescence a young person\u2019s mind changes\ndramatically in many important ways.

We will talk more about this concept,\nknown as attributions, later in the chapter.\nAttention | 149 Social Cognitions\nThe culture that we live in has a significant impact on the\nway we think about and perceive our social worlds, so it is not\nsurprising that people in different cultures would think about\npeople and things somewhat differently. Social cognitions are\nthe way we think about others, pay attention to social\ninformation, and use the information in our lives (consciously\nor unconsciously). In this section we will review several types of\nsocial cognitions including schemas, attributions, confirmation\nbias and the fundamental attribution error. We will also revisit\nanalytic perception and holistic perception that we learned\nearlier in this chapter.\nSchema\nThrough the process of cognitive development, we accumulate\na lot of knowledge and this knowledge is stored in the form\nof schemas, which are knowledge representations that include\ninformation about a person, group, or situation. Because they\nrepresent our past experience, and because past experience is\nuseful for prediction, our schemas influence our expectations\nabout future events and people.\nWhen a schema is activated it brings to mind other related\ninformation. This process is usually unconscious, or happens\noutside of our awareness. Through schema activation,\njudgments are formed based on internal assumptions (bias) in\naddition to information actually available in the environment.\nWhen a schema is more accessible it can be activated more\nquickly and used in a particular situation. For example, if there\nis one female in a group of seven males, female gender\nschemas may be more accessible and influence the group\u2019s\n150 | Social Cognitions thinking and behavior toward the female group member.\nWatching a scary movie late at night might increase the\naccessibility of frightening schemas, increasing the likelihood\nthat a person will perceive shadows and background noises as\npotential threats.\nA Caucasian man in a group of African tribesmen may activate\nschema related to tourists. You would not immediately consider him\na local of the area. [Group of Man on Desert Image by Follow Alice CC\n0]\nOnce they have developed, schemas influence our subsequent\nlearning, such that the new people and situations we\nencounter are interpreted and understood in terms of our\nexisting knowledge (Piaget & Inhelder, 1962; Taylor & Crocker,\n1981). When existing schemas change on the basis of new\ninformation, we call the process accommodation. In other\ncases, however, we engage in assimilation, a process in which\nSocial Cognitions | 151 our existing knowledge influences new conflicting information\nto better fit with our existing knowledge, thus reducing the\nlikelihood of schema change. You may remember these\nconcepts from Chapter 4 when we learned about Piaget\u2019s\ntheory of cognitive development.\nPsychologists have become increasingly interested in the\ninfluence of culture on social cognition and schemas. Although\npeople of all cultures use schemas to understand the world, the\ncontent of our schemas has been found to differ for individuals\nbased on their cultural upbringing. For example, one study\ninterviewed a Scottish settler and a Bantu herdsman from\nSwaziland and compared their schemas about cattle. Because\ncattle are essential to the lifestyle of the Bantu people, the\nBantu herdsman\u2019s schemas for cattle were far more extensive\nthan the schemas of the Scottish settler. The Bantu herdsmen\nwere able to distinguish his cattle from dozens of others, while\nthe Scottish settler was not.\n152 | Social Cognitions Bantu herdsmen\u2019s schema for cattle were more extensive when\ncompared to Scottish settlers, culture shapes our schema and\ncognitions. [Ankole Cattle Image by sarahemcc CC BY 2.0]\nOne outcome of assimilation that shapes our schema is\nconfirmation bias, the tendency for people to seek out and\nfavor information that confirms their expectations and beliefs,\nwhich in turn can further help to explain the often, self-fulfilling\nnature of our schemas. The confirmation bias has been shown\nto occur in many contexts and groups, although there is some\nevidence of cultural differences in its extent and prevalence.\nKastenmuller and colleagues (2010), for instance, found that\nthe bias was stronger among people with individualist (e.g., the\nUnited States, Canada, and Australia) versus collectivist (e.g.,\nJapan, China, Taiwan, Korea, India among others) cultural\nbackgrounds. The researchers argued that this partly stemmed\nfrom collectivist cultures putting greater importance in being\nself-critical, which is less compatible with seeking out\nconfirming as opposed to disconfirming evidence.\nSocial Cognitions | 153 Attributions\nPsychologists who study social cognition believe that behavior\nis the product of the situation (e.g., role, culture, other people\naround) and the person (e.g., temperament, personality, health,\nmotivation). Attributions are beliefs that a person develops to\nexplain human behaviors, characteristics and situations. This\nmeans that we try to explain or make conclusions about the\ncauses of our own behavior and others\u2019 behavior. Internal\nattributions are dispositional (e.g., traits, abilities, feelings), and\nexternal attributions are situational (e.g., things in the\nenvironment). Our attributions are frequently biased. One way\nthat our attributions may be biased is that we are often too\nquick to attribute the behavior of other people to something\npersonal about them rather than to something about their\nsituation. This is a classic example of the general human\ntendency of underestimating how important the social\nsituation really is in determining behavior. Fundamental\nattribution error (FAE) is the tendency to overestimate the\ndegree to which the characteristics of an individual are the\ncause of an event, and to underestimate the involvement of\nsituational factors. FAE is considered to be universal but that\ncultural differences may explain how and when FAE occurs.\nAttributions and Culture\nOn average, people from individualistic cultures tend to focus\ntheir internal attributions more on the individual person,\nwhereas, people from collectivistic cultures tend to focus more\non the situation (Ji, Peng, & Nisbett, 2000; Lewis, Goto, & Kong,\n2008; Maddux & Yuki, 2006). Miller (1984) asked children and\nadults in both India (a collectivistic culture) and the United\nStates (an individualist culture) to indicate the causes of\nnegative actions by other people. Although the younger\n154 | Social Cognitions children (ages 8 and 11) did not differ, the older children (age\n15) and the adults did. Americans made more dispositional\nattributions, whereas Indians made more situational\nattributions for the same behavior.\nMorris and his colleagues (Hong, Morris, Chiu, & Benet-\nMart\u00ednez, 2000) investigated the role of culture on person\nperception in a different way, by focusing on people who are\nbicultural (i.e., who have knowledge about two different\ncultures). In their research, they used high school students\nliving in Hong Kong. Although traditional Chinese values are\nemphasized in Hong Kong, because Hong Kong was a British-\nadministrated territory for more than a century, the students\nthere are also enculturated with Western social beliefs and\nvalues.\nMorris and his colleagues first randomly assigned the\nstudents to one of three priming conditions. Participants in the\nAmerican culture priming condition saw pictures of American\nicons (such as the U.S. Capitol building and the American flag)\nand then wrote 10 sentences about American culture.\nParticipants in the Chinese culture priming condition saw\neight Chinese icons (such as a Chinese dragon and the Great\nWall of China) and then wrote 10 sentences about Chinese\nculture. Finally, participants in the control condition saw\npictures of natural landscapes and wrote 10 sentences about\nthe landscapes.\nThen participants in all conditions read a story about an\noverweight boy who was advised by a physician not to eat food\nwith high sugar content. One day, he and his friends went\nto a buffet dinner where a delicious-looking cake was offered.\nDespite its high sugar content, he ate it. After reading the story,\nthe participants were asked to indicate the extent to which the\nboy\u2019s weight problem was caused by his personality (personal\nattribution) or by the situation (situational attribution). The\nstudents who had been primed with symbols about American\nculture gave relatively less weight to situational (rather than\nSocial Cognitions | 155 personal) factors in comparison with students who had been\nprimed with symbols of Chinese culture.\nIn still another test of cultural differences in person\nperception, Kim and Markus (1999) analyzed the statements\nmade by athletes and by the news media regarding the\nwinners of medals in the 2000 and 2002 Olympic Games. They\nfound that athletes in China described themselves more in\nterms of the situation (they talked about the importance of\ntheir coaches, their managers, and the spectators in helping\nthem to do well), whereas American athletes (can you guess?)\nfocused on themselves, emphasizing their own strength,\ndetermination, and focus.\nMost people tend to use the same basic perception\nprocesses, but given the cultural differences in group\ninterconnectedness (individualistic versus collectivist), as well\nas differences in attending (analytic versus holistic), it should\ncome as no surprise that people who live in collectivistic\ncultures tend to show the fundamental attribution error less\noften than those from individualistic cultures, particularly\nwhen the situational causes of behavior are made salient (Choi,\nNisbett, & Norenzayan, 1999). Bias attributions can lead to\nnegative stereotyping and discrimination but being more\naware of these cross-cultural differences in attribution may\nreduce cultural misunderstandings and misinterpreting\nbehavior.\n156 | Social Cognitions Thinking\nThe way we represent the world influences the degree of\nsuccess we experience in our lives. For example, if we represent\nyellow traffic lights as the time to hit the accelerator, then the\nworld might give us tickets, scares, or accidents. If we represent\nour diet as a way to maximize refined sugar intake, then we\nmight wind up experiencing heart disease. Mental\nrepresentations and intelligence go hand in hand. Some\nmental representations are more intelligent, because they are\nmore adaptive and support outcomes such as well-being,\nsafety, and success. In this section we are going to cover other\nelements of thinking like categorization, memory, and\nintelligence and how culture shapes these processes.\nCategories and Concepts\nThe information we sense and perceive is continuously\norganized and reorganized into concepts that belong to\ncategories. Most concepts cannot be strictly defined but are\norganized around the best examples or prototypes, which have\nthe properties most common in the category or might be\nconsidered the ideal example of a category.\nConcepts are at the core of intelligent behavior. We expect\npeople to be able to know what to do in new situations and\nwhen confronting new objects. If you go into a new classroom\nand see chairs, a blackboard, a projector, and a screen, you\nknow what these things are and how they will be used. You\u2019ll\nsit on one of the chairs and expect the instructor to write on\nthe blackboard or project something onto the screen. You\u2019ll do\nthis even if you have never seen any of these particular objects\nbefore, because you have concepts of classrooms, chairs,\nThinking | 157 projectors, and so forth that tell you what they are and what\nyou\u2019re supposed to do with them.\nObjects fall into many different categories, but there is\nusually a hierarchy to help us organize our mental\nrepresentations.\n\u2022 A concept at the superordinate level of categories is at the\ntop of a taxonomy and it has a high degree of generality\n(e.g., animal, fruit).\n\u2022 A concept at the basic level categories is found at the\ngeneric level which contains the most salient differences\n(e.g., dog, apple).\n\u2022 A concept at the subordinate level of categories is specific\nand has little generality (e.g., Labrador retriever, Gala).\nFigure 1. We use category hierarchies to help us organized and group\ndifferent concepts. [Image provided by Noba Project]\nBrown (1958) noted that children use basic level categories\nwhen first learning language and superordinates are especially\n158 | Thinking difficult for children to fully acquire. People are faster at\nidentifying objects as members of basic-level categories (Rosch\net al., 1976). Recent research suggests that there are different\nways to learn and represent concepts and that they are\naccomplished by different neural systems. Using our earlier\nexample of a classroom, if someone tells you a new fact about\nthe projector, like it uses a halogen bulb, you are likely to extend\nthis fact to other projectors you encounter. In short, concepts\nallow you to extend what you have learned about a limited\nnumber of objects to a potentially infinite set of events and\npossibilities.\nCategorization and Culture\nThere are some universal categories like emotions, facial\nexpressions, shape and color but culture can shape how we\norganize information. Chiu (1972) was the first to examine\ncultural differences in categorization using Chinese and\nAmerican children. Participants were presented with three\npictures (e.g., a tire, a car, and a bus), and were asked to group\nthe two pictures they thought best belonged together.\nParticipants were also asked to explain their choices (e.g.,\n\u201cBecause they are both large\u201d). Results showed that the\nChinese children have a greater tendency to categorize by\nidentifying relationships among the pictures but American\nchildren were more likely to categorize by identifying\nsimilarities among pictures.\nLater research reported no cultural differences in\ncategorization between Western and East Asian participants;\nhowever, among similarity categorizations the East Asian\nparticipants were more likely to make decisions on holistic\naspects of the images and Western participants were more\nlike to make decisions based on individual components of the\nimages (Norenzayan, Smith, Jun Kim, and Nisbett, 2002).\nThinking | 159 Cultural differences in categorizing were also found by\nUnworth, Sears and Pexman (2005) across three experiments;\nhowever, when the experiment task was timed there were\ndifferences in category selection. These results suggest that\nthe nature (timed or untimed) of the categorization task\ndetermines the extent to which cultural differences are\nobserved.\nThe results of these categorization studies seem to support\nthe differences in thinking between individualist and\ncollectivist cultures. Western cultures are more individualist\nand engage in more analytic thinking and East Asian cultures\nengage in more holistic thinking (Choi, Nisbett, & Smith, 1997;\nMasuda & Nisbett, 2001; Nisbett et al., 2001; Peng & Nisbett,\n1999). You might remember from the earlier section that\nholistic thought is characterized by a focus on context and\nenvironmental factors so categorizing by relationships can be\nexplained with referencing how objects relate to their\nenvironment. Analytic thought is characterized by the\nseparation of an object from its context so categorizing by\nsimilarity means that objects can be separated into different\ngroups. A major limitation with these studies is the emphasis\non East Asian, specifically the use of Chinese participants and\nWestern cultures. There have been no within culture\nreplications using participants from other non-Asian\ncollectivist cultures.\n160 | Thinking Memory\nMemory is a single term that reflects a number of different\nabilities: holding information briefly while working with it\n(working memory), remembering episodes of one\u2019s life and our\ngeneral knowledge of facts of the world among other types.\nMemory involves three processes:\n\u2022 Encoding information \u2013 attending to information and\nrelating it to past learning\n\u2022 Storing \u2013 maintaining information over time\n\u2022 Retrieving \u2013 accessing the information when you need it\nThe information processing model of memory is a useful way\nto represent how information from the world is integrated with\nthe knowledge networks of information that already exist in\nour minds.\nSensory Memory is the part of the memory system in which\ninformation is translated from physical energy into neural\nsignals. This is part of the encoding process. We receive\ninformation from our environment and we must perceive it\nand attend to it before it can move to our working memory.\nShort-Term Memory (working memory) is the part of the\nmemory system in which information can be temporarily\nstored in the present state of awareness. This type of memory\nis limited to 7 items of capacity and 7 to 30 seconds of duration\non average.\nLong-Term Memory is the part of the memory system in\nwhich information can be permanently stored for an extended\nperiod of time. It has a large to unlimited capacity and a\nduration that may last from minutes to a lifetime.\nSemantic Memory is the type of long-term memory about\nMemory | 161 general facts, ideas, or concepts that are not associated with\nemotions and personal experience.\nEpisodic Memory is a type of long-term memory about\nevents taking place at a specific time and place in a person\u2019s\nlife. This memory is contextualized (i.e., where, who, when, why)\nin relation to events and what they mean emotionally to an\nindividual.\nFigure 1. Diagram of the information processing model of memory\n[Image by Educ320, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:The_modal_model.png CC BY-SA]\nMemory failures can occur at any stage, leading to forgetting or\nto having false memories. The key to improving one\u2019s memory\nis to improve processes of encoding and to use techniques\nthat guarantee effective retrieval. Good encoding techniques\ninclude relating new information to what one already knows,\nforming mental images, and creating associations among\ninformation that needs to be remembered. The key to good\nretrieval is developing effective cues that will lead the person\nback to the encoded information. Classic mnemonic systems\ncan greatly improve one\u2019s memory abilities.\n162 | Memory Memory and Culture\nIt should be obvious, after learning about episodic memory\nthat many of our memories are personal and unique to us\nbut cultural psychologists and researchers have found that the\naverage age of first memories varies up to two years between\ndifferent cultures. Researchers believe that enculturation and\ncultural values influence childhood memories. For example,\nthe way parents and other adults discuss, or don\u2019t discuss, the\nevents in children\u2019s lives influences the way the children will\nlater remember those events.\nMullen (1994) found that Asian and Asian-American\nundergraduates\u2019 memories, on average, happened six months\nlater than the Caucasian students\u2019 memories. These results\nwere repeated in a sample of native Korean participants, only\nthis time the differences were even larger. The difference\nbetween Caucasian participants and native Korean\nparticipants was almost 16 months. Hayne (2000) also found\nthat Asian adults\u2019 first memories were later than Caucasians\u2019\nbut Maori adults\u2019 (native population from New Zealand)\nmemories reached even further back to around age three.\nThese results do not mean that Caucasians or Maoris have\nbetter memories than Asians but rather people have the types\nof memories that they need to get along well in the world they\ninhabit \u2013 memories exist within cultural context. For example,\nMaori culture is focused on personal history and stories to a\ngreater degree than American culture and Asian culture.\nDifferences in memory could also be explained by the values of\nindividualistic and collectivist cultures. Individualistic cultures\ntend to be independently oriented with an emphasis on\nstanding out and being unique. Interpersonal harmony and\nmaking the group work is the emphasis of collectivist cultures\nand the way in which people connect to each other is less\noften through sharing memories of personal events. In some\nMemory | 163 cultures, personal memory isn\u2019t nearly as important as it is to\npeople from individualistic cultures.\n164 | Memory Intelligence\nPsychologists have long debated how to best conceptualize\nand measure intelligence (Sternberg, 2003). These questions\ninclude how many types of intelligence there are, the role of\nnature versus nurture in intelligence, how intelligence is\nrepresented in the brain, and the meaning of group differences\nin intelligence. The concept of intelligence relates to abstract\nthinking and that includes our abilities to acquire knowledge,\nto reason abstractly, to adapt to novel situations, and to benefit\nfrom instruction and experience (Gottfredson, 1997; Sternberg,\n2003). The brain processes underlying intelligence are not\ncompletely understood, but current research has focused on\nfour potential factors:\n\u2022 Brain size\n\u2022 Sensory ability\n\u2022 Speed and efficiency of neural transmission\n\u2022 Working memory capacity\nThere is some truth to the idea that smarter people have bigger\nbrains. Studies that have measured brain volume using\nneuroimaging techniques find that larger brain size is\ncorrelated with intelligence (McDaniel, 2005), and intelligence\nhas also been found to be correlated with the number of\nneurons in the brain and with the thickness of the cortex (Haier,\n2004; Shaw et al., 2006). It is important to remember that these\ncorrelational findings do not mean that having more brain\nvolume causes higher intelligence. It is possible that growing\nup in a stimulating environment that rewards thinking and\nlearning may lead to greater brain growth (Garlick, 2003), and\nit is also possible that a third variable, such as better nutrition,\ncauses both brain volume and intelligence.\nIntelligence | 165 There is some evidence that brains of more intelligent people\noperate more efficiently than the brains of people with less\nintelligence. Haier, Siegel, Tang, and Abel (1992) analyzed data\nshowing that people who were more intelligent showed less\nbrain activity than those with lower intelligence when they\nworked on a task. Researchers suggested that more intelligent\nbrains need to use less capacity. Brains of more intelligent\npeople also seem to operate faster than the brains of those\nwho are less intelligent. Research has found that the speed\nwith which people can perform simple tasks, like determining\nwhich of two lines is longer or quickly pressing one of eight\nbuttons that is lighted, was predictive of intelligence (Deary,\nDer, & Ford, 2001). Intelligence scores also correlate at about r =\n.5 with measures of working memory (Ackerman, Beier, &\nBoyle, 2005), and working memory is now used as a measure of\nintelligence on many tests.\nResearch using twin and adoption studies found that\nintelligence has both genetic and environmental causes\n(Neisser et al., 1996; Plomin, DeFries, Craig, & McGuffin, 2003).\nIt appears that 40% \u2013 80% of the variability (difference) in\nintelligence is due to genetics (Plomin & Spinath, 2004). The\nintelligence of identical twins correlates very highly at r = .86,\nwhich is much higher than the scores of fraternal twins who\nare less genetically similar (r = .60). Correlations between the\nintelligence of parents and their biological children (r = .42)\nis significantly higher than the correlation between parents\nand adopted children (r = .19). The intelligence of very young\nchildren (less than 3 years old) does not predict adult\nintelligence but by age 7 intelligence scores (as measured by\na standard test) remain very stable in adulthood (Deary,\nWhiteman, Starr, Whalley, & Fox, 2004).\n166 | Intelligence Figure 1. The correlations of intelligence scores of unrelated versus\nrelated persons reared apart or together suggest a genetic\ncomponent to intelligence [Image provided by OpenStax Psychology]\nThere is also strong evidence for the role of nurture, which\nindicates that individuals are not born with fixed,\nunchangeable levels of intelligence. Twins raised together in\nthe same home have more similar intelligence scores than do\ntwins who are raised in different homes, and fraternal twins\nhave more similar intelligence scores than do non-twin\nsiblings, which is likely due to the fact that they are treated\nmore similarly than are siblings. Additionally, intelligence\nbecomes more stable as we get older which provides evidence\nthat early environmental experiences matter more than later\nones.\nEnvironmental factors also explain a greater proportion of\nthe variance in intelligence and social and economic\ndeprivation can adversely affect intelligence. Children from\nhouseholds in poverty have lower intelligence scores than\nchildren from households with more resources even when\nother factors such as education, race, and parenting are\nIntelligence | 167 controlled (Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997). Poverty may\ncontribute to diets that undernourished the brain or lack\nappropriate vitamins. Poor children are more likely to be\nexposed to toxins such as lead in drinking water, dust, or paint\nchips (Bellinger & Needleman, 2003). Both of these factors can\nslow brain development and reduce intelligence.\nIntelligence is improved by education and the number of\nyears a person has spent in school correlates about r = .6 with\nintelligence (Ceci, 1991). There is a word of caution when\ninterpreting this result. The correlation may be due to the fact\nthat people with higher intelligence scores enjoy taking classes\nmore than people with low intelligence scores, and may be\nmore likely to stay in school. Children\u2019s intelligence scores tend\nto drop significantly during summer vacations (Huttenlocher,\nLevine, & Vevea, 1998), a finding that suggests a causal effect\nof intelligence and education. A longer school year, as is used\nin Europe and East Asia, may be beneficial for maintaining\nintelligence scores for school-aged children.\nOne or Many\nAs learned earlier, intelligence is associated with the brain,\nincludes abstract thinking, adapting to new situations, ability\nto benefit from instruction and experience (Gottfredson, 1997;\nSternberg, 2003) and is largely determined by genetics.\nPsychologist Charles Spearman (1863\u20131945) hypothesized that\nthere must be a single underlying construct that links these\nconcepts, abilities and skills together. He called this construct\nthe general intelligence factor (g) and there is strong empirical\nsupport for a single dimension to intelligence. Others\npsychologists believe that instead of a single factor, intelligence\nis a collection of distinct abilities. Raymond Cattell proposed\na theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into\n168 | Intelligence two components: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence\n(Cattell, 1963).\nCrystallized intelligence is characterized as acquired\nknowledge and the ability to retrieve it. When you learn,\nremember, and recall information, you are using crystallized\nintelligence. You use crystallized intelligence all the time in\nyour coursework by demonstrating that you have mastered the\ninformation covered in the course.\nFluid intelligence encompasses the ability to see complex\nrelationships and solve problems. Navigating your way home\nafter being detoured onto an unfamiliar route because of road\nconstruction would draw upon your fluid intelligence. Fluid\nintelligence helps you tackle complex, abstract challenges in\nyour daily life, whereas crystallized intelligence helps you\novercome concrete, straightforward problems (Cattell, 1963).\nRobert Sternberg developed another theory of intelligence,\nwhich he titled the triarchic theory of intelligence because\nhe proposed that intelligence is comprised of three parts\n(Sternberg, 1988): creative, analytical, and practical intelligence.\n(CAP).\n\u2022 Creative intelligence is marked by inventing or imagining\na solution to a problem or situation. Creativity in this realm\ncan include finding a novel solution to an unexpected\nproblem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well-\ndeveloped short story.\n\u2022 Analytical intelligence is closely aligned with academic\nproblem solving and computations. Sternberg says that\nanalytical intelligence is demonstrated by an ability to\nanalyze, evaluate, judge, compare, and contrast. For\nexample, in a science course such as anatomy, you must\nstudy the processes by which the body uses various\nminerals in different human systems. In developing an\nunderstanding of this topic, you are using analytical\nintelligence.\nIntelligence | 169 \u2022 Practical intelligence is sometimes compared to \u201cstreet\nsmarts.\u201d Being practical means you find solutions that\nwork in your everyday life by applying knowledge based\non your experiences.\nFigure 2. Sternberg\u2019s theory identifies three types of intelligence:\npractical, creative, and analytical [image from OpenStax Psychology]\nMultiple Intelligences Theory was developed by Howard\nGardner and asserts that everybody possesses at least eight\ndistinct types of intelligence. Among these eight intelligences,\na person typically excels in some and falters in others (Gardner,\n1983). Gardner\u2019s theory is relatively new and needs additional\nresearch to establish empirical support. At the same time, his\nideas challenge the traditional idea of intelligence to include\na wider variety of abilities but creating a test to measure all of\nGardner\u2019s intelligences has been extremely difficult (Furnham,\n2009; Gardner & Moran, 2006; Klein, 1997).\n170 | Intelligence Intelligence and Culture\nIntelligence can also have different meanings and values in\ndifferent cultures. If you live on a small island, where most\npeople get their food by fishing from boats, it would be\nimportant to know how to fish and how to repair a boat. If\nyou were an exceptional angler, your peers would probably\nconsider you intelligent. If you were also skilled at repairing\nboats, your intelligence might be known across the whole\nisland. In Irish families, hospitality and telling an entertaining\nstory are marks of the culture. If you are a skilled storyteller,\nother members of Irish culture are likely to consider you\nintelligent. Some cultures place a high value on working\ntogether as a collective. In these cultures, the importance of\nthe group supersedes the importance of individual\nachievement. When you visit such a culture, how well you\nrelate to the values of that culture exemplifies your cultural\nintelligence, sometimes referred to as cultural competence.\nIntelligence Tests\nReliable intelligence testing began in the early 1900s with\nresearchers named Alfred Binet and Henri Simon. They were\ninstructed by the French government to develop an\nintelligence test to use on children in order to determine which\nones might have difficulty in school. The test included many\nverbally based tasks. American researchers soon realized the\nvalue of such testing and Louis (Lewis) Terman, a Stanford\nprofessor, modified Binet\u2019s work by standardizing the\nadministration of the test, which was standardized by testing\nthousands of different-aged children in the United States to\nestablish an average score for each age group. The Stanford-\nBinet, is a measure of general intelligence made up of a wide\nIntelligence | 171 variety of tasks including vocabulary, memory for pictures, and\nnaming of familiar objects and is primarily used with children.\nLater, David Wechsler created an adult intelligence test\nnamed the Wechsler Adult intelligence Scale (WAIS),\nwhich is the most widely used intelligence test for\nadults (Watkins, Campbell, Nieberding, & Hallmark, 1995). The\ncurrent version of the WAIS, consists of 15 different tasks\nincluding working memory, arithmetic ability, spatial ability,\nand general knowledge about the world. These 15 tasks\nmeasure a dimension of intelligence and provide psychologists\nwith four domains scores: verbal, perceptual, working memory,\nand processing speed. The WAIS is highly correlated with the\nStanford-Binet, as well as with criteria of academic and life\nsuccess, including college grades, measures of work\nperformance, and occupational level. It also shows significant\ncorrelations with measures of everyday functioning among\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities.\n172 | Intelligence Chapter Review\nWe learned earlier in the chapter that the brain is central to\nsensing and perceiving our world but culture is at the heart\nof thinking. Culture shapes how we perceive information,\nevaluate the information and use the information in our daily\nlife.\nWe organize the world into networks of information that are\nstored and used to interpret new experiences. This knowledge\ncan be represented into hierarchical concepts with\nsuperordinate, basic, and subordinate categories. We hold\ninformation in short-term memory and process it using\nnetworks of information in long term memory; some from\nepisodic experiences and some from more formal semantic\nknowledge. Intelligence is among the oldest and longest\nstudied topics in all of psychology.

She significantly improved her time and scored a\npersonal best. The improvement caused officials from the\nInternational Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) to\nquestion whether her win was legitimate. The allegations and\neventual testing were based on allegations that Caster\nSemenya, no matter her gender identity, was biologically a\nmale.\nYou may be thinking that testing would be a simple matter of\nDNA, hormone testing or a physical examination but as we will\nlearn it is not that simple. There are chromosomal variations\nand both biologically males and biologically females produce\na certain amount of testosterone. Different laboratories have\ndifferent testing methods, which makes it difficult to set a\nspecific standard for male hormones produced by a female\nthat renders her sex male. The International Olympic\nCommittee (IOC) criteria for determining eligibility for sex-\nspecific events are not intended to determine biological sex.\nTo provide further context, during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,\neight female athletes with XY chromosomes underwent\ntesting and were ultimately confirmed as eligible to compete\nas women (Maugh, 2009). To date, no males have undergone\nthis sort of testing. This raises interesting issues \u2013 women who\nperform better than expected are \u201ctoo masculine,\u201d but when\nmen perform well they are simply superior athletes. Do you\nthink this level of biological scrutiny would happen to a male\nbased solely on his appearance and athletic ability?\nWe live in an era when sex, gender, and sexual orientation are\ncontroversial religious and political issues. Some nations have\nlaws against homosexuality, while others have laws protecting\nsame-sex marriages. At a time when there seems to be little\nagreement among religious and political groups, it makes\nsense to wonder about what is considered normal and who\ndecides.\n178 | Culture and Sexuality The international scientific and medical communities (e.g.,\nAmerican Psychological Association, World Health\nOrganization, World Medical Association, World Psychiatric\nAssociation, and the Association for Psychological Science)\nview variations of sex, gender, and sexual orientation as normal.\nFurthermore, variations of sex, gender, and sexual orientation\noccur naturally throughout the animal kingdom.

Male sexual and\nreproductive organs include the penis and testes. Female\nsexual and reproductive organs include clitoris, vagina and\novaries. Biological males have XY chromosome and biological\nfemales have XX chromosome but biological sex is not as easily\ndefined or determined as you might expect. For example, does\nthe presence of more than one X mean that the XXY person is\nfemale or does the presence of a Y mean that the XXY person is\nmale? The existence of sex variations fundamentally challenges\nthe notion of a binary biological sex.\nIn humans, intersex individuals make up about two percent,\nmore than 150 million people, of the world\u2019s population\n(Blackless et al., 2000). Intersex describes variation in sex\ncharacteristics, such as chromosomes, gonads (testes and\novaries), sex hormones, or genitals (penis, clitoris, vulva). The\nterm is misleading because it suggests that people have\ncomplete sets male or female reproductive systems but this is\nnot always the case. There are dozens of intersex conditions,\nsuch as Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and Turner\u2019s\nsyndrome (Lee et al., 2006).\nIn our example, having one Y and more than one X\nchromosome is called Kleinfelter Syndrome. Some people have\ngenitalia considered ambiguous, meaning that they cannot\neasily be identified as either male (penis) or female (clitoris).\nFausto-Sterling (2000) argues that the decision to label\nsomeone male or female is a social decision and that a\nbiological sex is too complex to fit within a binary sex system.\nSex and Gender | 181 Nevertheless, because assigning a sex identity is a\nfundamental cultural priority, doctors will typically decide, with\nrespect to intersex babies, within 24 hours of a birth.\nSometimes this decision involves surgery, which can have long\nterm psychological consequences (Fausto-Sterling, 2000).\nGender\nGender is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions\nand roles associated with being male or female. Gender is not\ndetermined by biology in any simple way. At an early age, we\nbegin learning cultural norms for what is considered masculine\n(trait of a male) and feminine (trait of a female). Gender is\nconveyed and signaled to others through clothing and\nhairstyle, or mannerisms like tone of voice, physical bearing,\nand facial expression. For example, children in the United\nStates may associate long hair, fingernail polish or dresses with\nfemininity. Later in life, as adults, we often conform to these\nnorms by behaving in gender specific ways: men build houses\nand women bake cookies (Marshall, 1989; Money et al., 1955;\nWeinraub et al., 1984). It is important to remember that\nbehaviors and traits associated with masculinity and femininity\nare culturally defined. For example, in American culture, it is\nconsidered feminine to wear a dress or skirt; however, in many\nMiddle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts\n(often referred to as sarongs, robes, or gowns) are worn by\nmales and are considered masculine. The kilt worn by a\nScottish male does not make him appear feminine in his\nculture.\n182 | Sex and Gender Definitions of masculine and feminine are culturally\ndefined and can change over time. [Image by Scottish\nKilt Shop CC BY-SA]\nOur understanding of gender begins very early in life \u2013 often\nbefore we are born. Western cultures, expecting parents are\nasked whether they are having a girl or a boy and immediately\njudgments are made about the child. Boys will be active and\npresents will be blue while girls will be delicate and presents\nwill be pink. In some Asian and Muslim cultures a male child\nis valued more favorably than a female child (Matsumoto &\nJuang, 2013) and female fetuses may be aborted or female\ninfants abandoned.\nChildren, by their first birthday, already distinguish faces by\nSex and Gender | 183 gender and between 3 and 6 years of age, children develop\nstrong and rigid gender stereotypes. Gender stereotyping\ninvolves overgeneralizing about the attitudes, traits, or\nbehavior patterns of women or men. Stereotypes can refer to\nplay (e.g., boys play with trucks, and girls play with dolls), traits\n(e.g., boys are strong, and girls like to cry), and occupations (e.g.,\nmen are doctors and women are nurses). These stereotypes\nstay rigid until children reach about age 8 or 9. Then they\ndevelop cognitive abilities that allow them to be more flexible\nin their thinking about others.\nFigure 1: Children develop the ability to classify gender very early in\nlife. [Image provided by Noba Project]\n184 | Sex and Gender Stereotypes and\nGender Roles\nMany of our gender stereotypes are strong because we\nemphasize gender so much in culture (Bigler & Liben, 2007).\nFor example, children learn at a young age that there are\ndistinct expectations for boys and girls. Gender roles refer to\nthe role or behaviors learned by a person as appropriate to their\ngender and are determined by the dominant cultural norms.\nCross-cultural studies reveal that children are aware of gender\nroles by age two or three and can label others\u2019 gender and sort\nobjects into gender categories. At four or five, most children\nare firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles\n(Kane, 1996). When children do not conform to the appropriate\ngender role for their culture, they may face negative sanctions\nsuch as being criticized, bullied, marginalized or rejected by\ntheir peers. A girl who wishes to take karate class instead of\ndance lessons may be called a \u201ctomboy\u201d and face difficulty\ngaining acceptance from both male and female peer groups\n(Ready, 2001). Boys, especially, are subject to intense ridicule\nfor gender nonconformity (Coltrane and Adams, 2008; Kimmel,\n2000)\nBy the time we are adults, our gender roles are a stable part\nof our personalities, and we usually hold many gender\nstereotypes. Men tend to outnumber women in professions\nsuch as law enforcement, the military, and politics. Women\ntend to outnumber men in care-related occupations such as\nchild care, health care, and social work. These occupational\nroles are examples of typical Western male and female\nbehavior, derived from our culture\u2019s traditions. Adherence to\nthese occupational gender roles demonstrates fulfillment of\nStereotypes and Gender\nRoles | 185 social expectations but may not necessarily reflect personal\npreference (Diamond, 2002).\nWomen and men tend to conform to cultural gender occupational\nroles but there are individuals who seek employment that reflects\npersonal preference and not cultural norms..\n[Image Blood Pressure Public Domain\nhttp://www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/15411; Image by Tubetroll\nNothing to See Here CC GY NC ND https://www.flickr.com/photos/\ntubetroll/2804006666/\\]\nGender stereotypes are not unique to American culture.\nWilliams and Best (1982) conducted several cross-cultural\nexplorations of gender stereotypes using data collected from\n30 cultures. There was a high degree of agreement on\nstereotypes across all cultures which led the researchers to\nconclude that gender stereotypes may be universal. Additional\nresearch found that males tend to be associated with stronger\nand more active characteristics than females (Best, 2001);\nhowever recent research argues that culture shapes how some\ngender stereotypes are perceived. Researchers found that\n186 | Stereotypes and Gender Roles across cultures, individualistic traits were viewed as more\nmasculine; however, collectivist cultures rated masculine traits\nas collectivist and not individualist (Cuddy et al., 2015). These\nfindings provide support that gender stereotypes may be\nmoderated by cultural values.\nThere are two major psychological theories that partially\nexplain how children form their own gender roles after they\nlearn to differentiate based on gender. Gender schema theory\nargues that children are active learners who essentially\nsocialize themselves and actively organize others\u2019 behavior,\nactivities, and attributes into gender categories, which are\nknown as schemas. These schemas then affect what children\nnotice and remember later. People of all ages are more likely\nto remember schema-consistent behaviors and attributes than\nschema-inconsistent behaviors and attributes. So, people are\nmore likely to remember men, and forget women, who are\nfirefighters. They also misremember schema-inconsistent\ninformation. If research participants are shown pictures of\nsomeone standing at the stove, they are more likely to\nremember the person to be cooking if depicted as a woman,\nand the person to be repairing the stove if depicted as a man.\nBy only remembering schema-consistent information, gender\nschemas strengthen more and more over time.\nStereotypes and Gender Roles | 187 People are less likely to remember schema-inconsistent behaviors\nand attributes. For example, people are more likely to remember\nmen, and forget women, who are firefighters. [Image provided by\nNoba Project].\nA second theory that attempts to explain the formation of\ngender roles in children is social learning theory which argues\nthat gender roles are learned through reinforcement,\npunishment, and modeling. Children are rewarded and\nreinforced for behaving in concordance with gender roles and\npunished for breaking gender roles. In addition, social learning\ntheory argues that children learn many of their gender roles\nby modeling the behavior of adults and older children and, in\ndoing so, develop ideas about what behaviors are appropriate\n188 | Stereotypes and Gender Roles for each gender. Social learning theory has less support than\ngender schema theory but research shows that parents do\nreinforce gender-appropriate play and often reinforce cultural\ngender norms.\nGender Roles and Culture\nHofstede\u2019s (2001) research revealed that on the Masculinity and\nFemininity dimension (MAS), cultures with high masculinity\nreported distinct gender roles, moralistic views of sexuality and\nencouraged passive roles for women. Additionally, these\ncultures discourage premarital sex for women but have no\nsuch restrictions for men. The cultures with the highest\nmasculinity scores were: Japan, Italy, Austria and Venezuela.\nCultures low in masculinity (high femininity) had gender roles\nthat were more likely to overlap and encouraged more active\nroles for women. Sex before marriage was seen as acceptable\nfor both women and men in these cultures. Four countries\nscoring lowest in masculinity were Norway, Denmark,\nNetherlands and Sweden. The United States is slightly more\nmasculine than feminine on this dimension; however, these\naspects of high masculinity are balanced by a need for\nindividuality.\nStereotypes and Gender Roles | 189 Gender Enculturation\nAgents\nRegardless of theory, observing, organization and learning\nabout gender occurs through four major agents of\nsocialization: family, education, peers and media. Each agent\nreinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative\nexpectations for gender-specific behavior. Exposure also\noccurs through secondary agents such as religion and the\nworkplace.\nFigure 1. Learning about gender occurs through four major agents of\nsocialization: family, education, peers and media.\nFamily\nFamily is the first agent of socialization and enculturation.\nThere is considerable evidence that parents socialize sons and\ndaughters differently. A meta-analysis of research from the\n190 | Gender Enculturation\nAgents United States and Canada found that parents most frequently\ntreated sons and daughters differently by encouraging gender-\nstereotypical activities (Lytton & Romney, 1991). Fathers, more\nthan mothers, are particularly likely to encourage gender-\nstereotypical play, especially in sons. Parents also talk to their\nchildren differently based on stereotypes. For example, parents\ntalk about numbers and counting twice as often with sons than\ndaughters (Chang, Sandhofer, & Brown, 2011) and talk to sons\nin more detail about science than with daughters. Parents are\nalso much more likely to discuss emotions with their daughters\nthan their sons.\nGirls may be asked to fold laundry, cook meals or perform\nduties that require neatness and care. It has been found that\nfathers are firmer in their expectations for gender conformity\nthan are mothers, and their expectations are stronger for sons\nthan they are for daughters (Kimmel, 2000). This is true in many\ntypes of activities, including preference of toys, play styles,\ndiscipline, chores, and personal achievements. As a result, boys\ntend to be particularly attuned to their father\u2019s disapproval\nwhen engaging in an activity that might be considered\nfeminine, like dancing or singing (Coltrane and Adams, 2008).\nIt should be noted that parental socialization and normative\nexpectations vary along lines of social class, race, and ethnicity.\nResearch in the United States has shown that African American\nfamilies, for instance, are more likely than Caucasians to model\nan egalitarian role structure for their children (Staples and\nBoulin Johnson, 2004). Even when parents set gender equality\nas a goal, there may be underlying indications of inequality.\nFor example, when dividing up household chores, boys may be\nasked to take out the garbage, take care of the yard or perform\nother tasks that require strength or toughness.\nGender Enculturation Agents | 191 Peers\nAs noted earlier, peer socializations can also serve to reinforce\ngender norms of a culture. Children learn at a very young age\nthat there are different expectations for boys and girls. When\nchildren do not conform to the appropriate gender role, they\nmay experience negative consequences like criticism, bullying\nor rejection by their peers. Boys and young men are more likely\nto experience intense, negative peer responses when they do\nnot follow traditional gender norms (Coltrane and Adams,\n2008; Kimmel, 2000).\nChildren learn gender roles through play and peer socializations.\n[Image by Sgt. Laurissa Hodges, CC 0 Public Domain\nhttps://www.army.mil/article/211797/\ncys_sports_helps_develop_minds_bodies]\nEducation\nThe reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes continues\nonce a child reaches school age. Studies suggest that gender\n192 | Gender Enculturation Agents socialization still occurs in schools today, perhaps in less\nobvious forms (Lips, 2004). Teachers may not even realize that\nthey are acting in ways that reproduce gender-differentiated\nbehavior patterns but any time students are asked to arrange\ntheir seats or line up according to gender, teachers are\nreinforcing that boys and girls should be treated differently\n(Thorne, 1993). Even in levels as low as kindergarten, schools\nsubtly convey messages to girls indicating that they are less\nintelligent or less important than boys.\nFor example, in a study involving teacher responses to male\nand female students, data indicated that teachers praised male\nstudents far more than they praised female students.\nAdditionally, teachers interrupted girls more and provided boys\nwith more opportunities to expand on their ideas (Sadker &\nSadker, 1994). Schools often reinforce the polarization of gender\nby positioning girls and boys in competitive arrangements \u2013\nlike a \u201cbattle of the sexes\u201d competition.\nMedia\nIn television and movies, women tend to have less significant\nroles and are often portrayed as wives or mothers. When\nwomen are given a lead role, they are often one of two\nextremes: a wholesome, saint-like figure or a malevolent,\nhypersexual figure (Etaugh and Bridges, 2003). Weisbuch and\nAmbady (2009) demonstrated that nonverbal behavior on\ntelevision can communicate culturally shared attitudes and\nbiases about women and ideal body images. Television\ncommercials and other forms of advertising also reinforce\ninequality and gender-based stereotypes. Women are almost\nexclusively present in ads promoting cooking, cleaning, or child\ncare-related products (Davis, 1993). Think about the last time\nyou saw a man star in a dishwasher or laundry detergent\ncommercial. In general, women are underrepresented in roles\nGender Enculturation Agents | 193 that involve leadership, intelligence, or emotional stability. In\nmainstream advertising, however, themes intermingling\nviolence and sexuality are quite common (Kilbourne, 2000).\nGender inequality is pervasive in children\u2019s movies (Smith,\n2008). Research indicates that of the 101 top-grossing children\u2019s\nmovies released between 1990 and 2005, three out of four (75%)\ncharacters were male, only seven (7%) were near being gender\nbalanced.\n194 | Gender Enculturation Agents Gender Differences\nDifferences between males and females can be based on (a)\nactual gender differences (i.e., men and women are actually\ndifferent in some abilities), (b) gender roles (i.e., differences in\nhow men and women are supposed to act), or (c) gender\nstereotypes (i.e., differences in how we think men and women\nare). Sometimes gender stereotypes and gender roles reflect\nactual gender differences, but sometimes they do not.\nIn terms of language and language skills, girls develop\nlanguage skills earlier and know more words than boys;\nhowever this does not translate into long-term differences. Girls\nare also more likely than boys to offer praise, to agree with the\nperson they\u2019re talking to, and to elaborate on the other person\u2019s\ncomments. Boys, in contrast, are more likely than girls to assert\ntheir opinion and offer criticisms (Leaper & Smith, 2004). In\nterms of temperament, boys are slightly less able to suppress\ninappropriate responses and slightly more likely to blurt things\nout than girls (Else-Quest, Hyde, Goldsmith, & Van Hulle, 2006).\nGender Differences | 195 Boys exhibit higher rates of unprovoked physical aggression than girls\nand are more likely to play organized rough-and-tumble games.\n[Image by Aislinn Ritchie and provided by Noba Project]\nWith respect to aggression, boys exhibit higher rates of\nunprovoked physical aggression than girls, but no difference\nin provoked aggression (Hyde, 2005). Some of the biggest\ndifferences involve the play styles of children. Boys frequently\nplay organized rough-and-tumble games in large groups,\nwhile girls often play fewer physical activities in much smaller\ngroups (Maccoby, 1998). There are also differences in the rates\nof depression, with girls much more likely than boys to be\n196 | Gender Differences depressed after puberty. After puberty, girls are also more likely\nto be unhappy with their bodies than boys.\nThere is considerable variability between individual males\nand females. Also, even when there are average group\ndifferences, the actual size of most of these differences is quite\nsmall. This means, knowing someone\u2019s gender does not help\nmuch in predicting his or her actual traits.\nGender Differences | 197 Gender Identity\nGenerally, our psychological sense of being male and female,\ngender identity corresponds to our biological sex. This is\nknown as cisgender. This is not true for everyone. Transgender\nindividuals\u2019 gender identities do not correspond with their\nbirth sexes. Transgendered males assigned the sex female at\nbirth have a strong emotional and psychological connection to\nthe forms of masculinity in their society that they identify their\ngender as male. A parallel connection to femininity exists for\ntransgendered females.\nHijra dancer in Nepal. [Image: Adam Jones and\nprovided by Noba Project]\nA binary or dichotomous view of gender (masculine or\n198 | Gender Identity feminine) is specific to some cultures, like the United States,\nbut it is not universal. In some cultures there are additional\ngender variations resulting in more than two gender\ncategories. For example, Samoan culture accepts what they\nrefer to as a third gender. Fa\u2019afafine, which translates as \u201cthe\nway of the woman,\u201d is a term used to describe individuals who\nare born biologically male but embody both masculine and\nfeminine traits. Fa\u2019afafines are considered an important part\nof Samoan culture. In Thailand, you can be male, female, or\nkathoey (Tangmunkongvorakul, Banwell, Carmichael, Utomo,\n& Sleigh, 2010) and in Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh\ntransgender females are referred to as hijras, recognized by\ntheir governments as a third gender (Pasquesoone, 2014).\nBecause gender is so deeply ingrained culturally, it is difficult\nto determine the prevalence of transgenderism in society.\nRates of transgender individuals vary widely around the world\n(see Table 1) and are shaped by social norms and cultural\nvalues. Transgendered individuals, who wish to alter their\nbodies through medical interventions such as surgery and\nhormonal therapy, so that their physical being is better aligned\nwith their gender identity, are called transsexuals. Not all\ntransgendered individuals choose to alter their bodies. Many\nwill maintain their original anatomy but may present\nthemselves to society as the opposite gender.\nGender Identity | 199 Transgender\nNation People per\n100, 000\nSweden .17\nPoland .26\nIreland 1.4\nJapan 1.4\nIndia 167\nThailand 333\nUnited States 476\nMalaysia 1, 333\nThere is no single, conclusive explanation for why people are\ntransgendered. Some hypotheses suggest biological factors\nsuch as genetics, or prenatal hormone levels, as well as social\nand cultural factors, such as childhood and adulthood\nexperiences. Most experts believe that all of these factors\ncontribute to a person\u2019s gender identity (American\nPsychological Association, 2008). Unfortunately, transgendered\nand transsexual individuals frequently experience\ndiscrimination based on their gender identity and are twice\nas likely to experience assault or discrimination as non-\ntransgendered individuals. Transgendered individuals are also\none and a half times more likely to experience intimidation\n(National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 2010) and be the\nvictim of violent crime.\n200 | Gender Identity Chaz Bono, a transgender male, is a well-known person who\ntransitioned from female to male.

Sexuality refers to the way\npeople experience and express sexual feelings. Sexual\nattraction is part of human sexuality and sexual orientation\nrefers to enduring patterns of sexual attraction and is typically\ndivided into four categories:\n\u2022 Heterosexuality is the attraction to individuals of the\nopposite sex;\n\u2022 Homosexuality is the attraction to individuals of one\u2019s own\nsex;\n\u2022 Bisexuality is the attraction to individuals of either sex; and\n\u2022 Asexuality is no attraction to either sex.\nHeterosexuals and homosexuals are informally referred to as\n\u201cstraight\u201d and \u201cgay,\u201d respectively. North America is a\nheteronormative society, meaning it supports heterosexuality\nas the norm. While the majority of people identify as\nheterosexual, there is a sizable population of people North\nAmerica who identify as either homosexual or bisexual.\nResearch suggests that somewhere between 3% and 10% of\nthe population identifies as homosexual (Kinsey, Pomeroy, &\nMartin, 1948; LeVay, 1996; Pillard & Bailey, 1995) and has\ndetermined that sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather\nit is a relatively stable characteristic of a person that cannot be\nchanged.\n202 | Sexual Orientation Figure 1. The Kinsey scale indicates that sexuality can be measured by\nmore than just heterosexuality and homosexuality [Image in Public\nDomain https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kinsey_Scale.svg]\nResearch has consistently demonstrated that there are no\ndifferences in the family backgrounds and experiences of\nheterosexuals and homosexuals (Bell, Weinberg, &\nHammersmith, 1981; Ross & Arrindell, 1988). Genetic and\nbiological mechanisms have also been proposed, and the\nbalance of evidence suggests that sexual orientation has an\nunderlying biological component. Over the past 25 years,\nresearch has identified genetics (Bailey & Pillard, 1991; Hamer,\nHu, Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993; Rodriguez-Larralde &\nParadisi, 2009) and brain structure and function (Allen & Gorski,\n1992; Byne et al., 2001; Hu et al., 2008; LeVay, 1991; Ponseti et\nal., 2006; Rahman & Wilson, 2003a; Swaab & Hofman, 1990) as\nbiological explanations for sexual orientation.\nAccording to current scientific understanding, individuals\nare usually aware of their sexual orientation between middle\nchildhood and early adolescence (American Psychological\nSexual Orientation | 203 Association, 2008). They do not have to participate in sexual\nactivity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and physical\nattractions; people can be celibate and still recognize their\nsexual orientation. Alfred Kinsey was among the first to\nconceptualize sexuality as a continuum rather than a strict\ndichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this continuum of\nheterosexuality and homosexuality, Kinsey created a six-point\nrating scale that ranges from exclusively heterosexual to\nexclusively homosexual.\n204 | Sexual Orientation Sexuality and Culture\nThere are three major cultural and social factors that influence\nviews on gender and sexuality: laws, religion and social norms.\nLaws\nIn the United States and other Western countries cisgender\nwomen have greater legal protections than in other parts of\nthe world. Globally, inequality is still enforced through laws in\nmany parts of the world. For example, laws and policies\nprohibit women from equal access and ownership to land,\nproperty, and housing. Economic and social discrimination\nresults in fewer life choices for women, rendering them\nvulnerable to poverty and human trafficking. Gender-based\nviolence affects at least 30% of women globally. Some women\nwho are victims of violence often have few legal protections\nor have limited legal recourse (United Nations Office of High\nCommissioner, 2018). For example, in some cultures, a woman\nmay not be able to have her attacker arrested or prosecuted.\nWithin the United States there has been greater acceptance\nof homosexuality and gender questioning that has resulted in\na rapid push for legal change. Laws such as \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t\nTell\u201d and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), both of which\nwere enacted in the 1990s, have been met severe resistance\nand legal challenges on the grounds of being discriminatory\ntoward sexual minority groups. Globally, a significant number\nof governments have recognized and legalized same-sex\nmarriages. As of 2017, over 24 countries have enacted national\nlaws allowing gays and lesbians to marry. These laws have\nmostly been enacted and enforced in Europe and North\nSexuality and Culture | 205 America. In Mexico, some jurisdictions allow same-sex couples\nto wed, while others do not (Pew, 2013).\nReligion\nMost religions have addressed the role for sexuality in human\ninteractions. Different religions have different views of sexual\nmorality. Most religions regulate sexual activity or assign\nnormative values to certain sexual behaviors or thoughts\nthrough moral codes of conduct. Some religions distinguish\nbetween sexual activities that are practiced for biological\nreproduction (only allowed between males and females who\nare married) as moral and other activities practiced for sexual\npleasure, as immoral. Sexual restriction is a universal of culture\nand typically defines incest and sex with animals as taboo or\nunacceptable behavior.\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that\ninvolve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia\nfor non-medical reasons. According to the World Health\nOrganization (2018), FGM is recognized internationally as a\nviolation of the human rights of girls and women and reflects\nstrongly held beliefs about inequality between the sexes.\nFemale genital mutilation has no health benefits for girls or\nwomen. The practice predates religion and there are no\nreligious texts that prescribe the practice; however, there are\nsome religious leaders who believe the practice has religious\nsupport and encourage its continued practice.\n206 | Sexuality and Culture A Ugandan campaign sign against female genital mutilation. [Image\nby Amnon Shavit CC BY-SA]\nFemale genital mutilation is mostly concentrated in Africa, the\nMiddle East and Asia, as well as locations with migrants from\nthese areas including the United States. Female Genital\nMutilation and is almost exclusively conducted on minors and\nis used as a way to regulate female sexuality and promote\nchastity. In cultures where FGM is practiced, a female who does\nnot conform or submit to the procedure may be rejected by her\ncommunity or find it difficult to find a mate and marry. Despite\nlong held tradition and cultural norms ideas and beliefs about\nFGM are changing.\nNorms\nCross-national research on sexual attitudes in industrialized\nnations reveals that normative standards differ across the\nworld. For example, several studies have shown that\nSexuality and Culture | 207 Scandinavian students are more tolerant of premarital sex than\nare North American students (Grose, 2007). A study of 37\ncountries reported that non-Western societies like China, Iran,\nand India valued chastity highly in a potential mate, while\nWestern European countries such as France, the Netherlands,\nand Sweden placed little value on prior sexual experiences\n(Buss, 1989).\nFor cultures that score high on Hofstede\u2019s Masculinity/\nFemininity dimension there exists a sexual double standard\nwhich prohibits premarital sexual intercourse for women but\npromotes it for men (Hofstede, 2001; Reiss, 1960). This standard\nhas evolved into allowing women to engage in premarital sex\nonly within committed love relationships, but allowing men\nto engage in sexual relationships with as many partners as\nthey wish without condition (Milhausen and Herold, 1999). As\na result, a woman is likely to have fewer sexual partners in\nher lifetime than a man. According to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC) the average 35-year-old woman\nhas had three opposite-sex sexual partners while the average\n35-year-old man has had twice as many (Centers for Disease\nControl, 2011).\nAttitudes about sexuality can differ widely, even among\nWestern cultures. For example, according to a 33,590-person\nsurvey across 24 countries, 89% of Swedes responded that\nthere is nothing wrong with premarital sex, while only 42% of\nIrish responded this way. From the same study, 93% of Filipinos\nresponded that sex before age 16 is always wrong or almost\nalways wrong, while only 75% of Russians responded this way\n(Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb, 1998). Sexual attitudes can also\nvary within a country. For instance, 45% of Spaniards\nresponded that homosexuality is always wrong, while 42%\nresponded that it is never wrong; only 13% responded\nsomewhere in the middle (Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb,\n1998).\nOf industrialized nations, Sweden is thought to be the most\n208 | Sexuality and Culture liberal when it comes to attitudes about sex, including sexual\npractices and sexual openness. The country has very few\nregulations on sexual images in the media, and sex education,\nwhich starts around age six and is a compulsory part of\nSwedish school curricula. Sweden\u2019s permissive approach to sex\nhas helped the country avoid some of the major social\nproblems associated with sex. For example, rates of teen\npregnancy and sexually transmitted disease are among the\nworld\u2019s lowest (Grose, 2007). It would appear that Sweden, a\nculture low on the masculinity dimension, may be a model\nfor the benefits of sexual freedom and frankness. However,\nimplementing Swedish ideals and policies regarding sexuality\nin other, more politically conservative, nations would likely be\nmet with resistance.\nWhile in most Western, industrialized cultures like the United\nStates exclusive heterosexuality is viewed as the sexual norm,\nthere are cultures with different attitudes regarding\nhomosexual behavior. In some instances, periods of exclusively\nhomosexual behavior are socially prescribed as a part of normal\ndevelopment and maturation. For example, in parts of New\nGuinea, young boys are expected to engage in sexual behavior\nwith other boys for a given period of time because it is believed\nthat doing so is necessary for these boys to become men\n(Baldwin & Baldwin, 1989).\nKosofsky Sedgwick (1985) described nonsexual same-sex\nrelationships along a continuum which she termed\nhomosocial. Women enjoy more fluidity along the continuum\nthan males in Western cultures, specifically North America. For\nexample, females can express homosocial feelings through\nhugging, hand-holding, and physical closeness. In contrast,\nmales refrain from these behaviors since they violate\nheterosexual norms for males. Women have more flexibility\nand can express more behavior variations along the\nheterosocial-homosocial spectrum but male behavior is\nSexuality and Culture | 209 subject to strong social sanction if it veers into what is\nconsidered homosocial.\n210 | Sexuality and Culture Discrimination\nGender stereotypes and cultural norms maintain gender and\nsexual inequalities in society. Differential treatment on the\nbasis of gender is also referred to gender discrimination or\nsexism and is an inevitable consequence of gender\nstereotypes. Sexism varies in its level of severity. In parts of the\nworld where women are strongly undervalued, young girls may\nnot be given the same access to nutrition, health care, and\neducation as boys. Further, they will grow up believing that\nthey deserve to be treated differently from boys (Thorne, 1993;\nUNICEF, 2007). Gender stereotypes typically maintain gender\ninequalities in society. The concept of ambivalent sexism\nrecognizes the complex nature of gender attitudes, in which\nwomen are often associated with positive and negative\nqualities (Glick & Fiske, 2001). It has two components. First,\nhostile sexism refers to the negative attitudes of women as\ninferior and incompetent relative to men. Second, benevolent\nsexism refers to the perception that women need to be\nprotected, supported, and adored by men. There has been\nconsiderable empirical support for benevolent sexism, possibly\nbecause it is seen as more socially acceptable than hostile\nsexism.\nWith regard to sexuality, there is a substantial body of\nevidence showing that homosexuals and bisexuals are treated\ndifferently than heterosexuals in schools, the workplace, and\nthe military. Much of this discrimination is based on\nstereotypes, misinformation, and homophobia \u2014 an extreme\nor irrational aversion to homosexuals. In the United States,\nmajor policies to prevent discrimination based on sexual\norientation have not been enacted until recently and are\nlargely the result of local changes rather than national or\nfederal policy.\nDiscrimination | 211 Reducing Gender Bias and Inequality\nAs we learned in earlier chapters, biased attributions lead to\nnegative stereotyping and discrimination but being aware of\nyour personal biases, as well as situations or contexts where\nyou experience bias helps reduce cultural. It is important to\nremember that biases are not permanent and can be shaped\nand changed to limit their impact on our thoughts and\nbehaviors (Dasgupta, 2013). In addition to self-awareness,\ndemonstrating empathy (understanding and sharing the\nfeelings of someone else) and taking a culturally relativist\nperspective is another way to reduce gender bias. When we\nconsider the experiences of people who are different from us,\nwe are less likely to make negative and hasty judgments.\nChallenging and correcting gender stereotypes in everyday\nactivities is another way that we can reduce gender bias as\nindividuals.\nTo further reduce gender inequality at a systemic or global\nlevel cultures should work to reduce infant and mother\nmortality, close gaps in health care and education among girls\nand increase employment opportunities and living wages for\nmen and women (World Economic Forum, 2019). Increased\nenforcement of existing laws against gender-based\nemployment discrimination and against sexual harassment\nwill also reduce gender and sexuality-based inequality in the\nworkplace. Globalization and cultural transmission has\nfacilitated improvements in gender inequality but more can\nbe done to challenge traditional possibilities and increase the\nopportunities for both females and males.\n212 | Discrimination Chapter Review\nGender roles are well-established social constructions that may\nchange from culture to culture and over time. For example,\nthere has been an increase in children\u2019s toys attempting to\ncater to both genders (such as Legos marketed to girls), rather\nthan catering to traditional stereotypes. As society\u2019s gender\nroles and gender restrictions continue to fluctuate, the legal\nsystem and the structure of American society, as well as other\ncultures, will continue to change and adjust.\nWe often make assumptions about how others should think\nand behave based on external appearance that represent\nbiological characteristics but the process of defining gender\nand sexuality is complex and includes variations. There are\nsome cultural universals but also culturally specific ways of\ndefining masculinity, femininity, and sexuality. Furthermore,\nvariations of sex, gender, and sexual orientation occur naturally\nthroughout the animal kingdom. More than 500 animal\nspecies have homosexual or bisexual orientations (Lehrer,\n2006). Gender inequality and discrimination are reinforced\nacross cultures and within cultures through stereotypes and\nmisunderstandings, as well as social norms and legal statutes.\nThe traditional binary ways of understanding human\ndifferences are insufficient for understanding the complexities\nof human culture. As gender roles fluctuate, societies will\ncontinue to change and adjust.\nVocabulary\nAmbivalent sexism is the concept of gender stereotypical\nattitudes that encompasses both positive and negative\nqualities.\nChapter Review | 213 Benevolent sexism is the \u201cpositive\u201d element of ambivalent\nsexism, which recognizes that women are perceived as\nneeding to be protected, supported, and adored by men\nCisgender is a term for when a person\u2019s birth sex\ncorresponds with his/her gender identity and gender role\nGender refers to the cultural, social, and psychological\nmeanings that are associated with masculinity and femininity.\nGender constancy refers to the awareness that gender is\nconstant and does not change simply by changing external\nattributes; develops between 3 and 6 years of age\nGender discrimination or sexism refers to differential\ntreatment on the basis of gender\nGender identity is a person\u2019s psychological sense of being\nmale or female.\nGender roles are the behaviors, attitudes, and personality\ntraits that are designated as either masculine or feminine in a\ngiven culture.\nGender schema theory is a theory of how children form their\nown gender roles argues that children actively organize others\u2019\nbehavior, activities, and attributes into gender categories or\nschemas.\nGender stereotypes are the beliefs and expectations people\nhold about the typical characteristics, preferences, and\nbehaviors of men and women.\nHostile sexism refers to the negative element of ambivalent\nsexism, which includes the attitudes that women are inferior\nand incompetent relative to men.\nSex refers to the biological category of male or female as\ndefined by physical differences in genetic composition and in\nreproductive anatomy and function.\nSexual orientation refers to the direction of emotional and\nerotic attraction toward members of the opposite sex, the\nsame sex, or both sexes.\nHeterosexual refers to opposite-sex attraction.\nHomosexual refers to same-sex attraction.\n214 | Chapter Review Intersex is a term for an individual born with either an\nabsence or some combination of male and female\nreproductive organs, sex hormones, or sex chromosomes.\nTransgender is a term for a person whose gender identity or\ngender role does not correspond with his/her birth sex.\nChapter Review | 215  PART VII\nCULTURE AND\nEMOTION\nEmotions help us navigate the complex social landscape of our lives.\n[Image by Gwenael Piase and provided by Noba Project]\nIt is impossible to imagine life without emotion. We treasure\nour feelings\u2014the joy at a soccer game, the pleasure of the\ntouch of a loved one, or the fun with friends on a night out.\nCulture and Emotion | 217 Even negative emotions are important, such as the sadness\nwhen a loved one dies, the anger when violated, fear that\novercomes us in a scary or unknown situation, or the guilt or\nshame when our mistakes are made public. Emotions color life\nexperiences and give those experiences meaning and flavor. In\norder to communicate and function effectively as employees,\nstudents, parents and citizens in a global community, we must\nunderstand the function of emotions and the ways culture\nshapes our emotions.\nThe words emotion and mood are sometimes used\ninterchangeably, but psychologists use these words to refer\nto two different things. An emotion refers to a transient,\nautomatic, neurophysiological event that is relatively intense\nand that occurs in response to something we experience. Mood\nrefers to a prolonged, less intense, affective state that does not\noccur in response to something we experience. Mood states\ndo not carry the intentionality that is associated with emotion\n(Beedie, Terry, Lane, & Devonport, 2011). There are three\ncomponents associated with emotion:\n\u2022 Physiological arousal (involuntary)\n\u2022 Behavioral\n\u2022 Cognitive\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1. Define the concept of emotions and describe the degree\nto which emotions are universal.\n2. Compare and contrast basic emotions with self \u2013\nconscious emotions.\n3. Identify and explain at least one research study or theory\nthat supports the universality of emotions.\n218 | Culture and Emotion 4. Identify the ways in which culture shapes our emotions.\n5. Define the term display rules of emotions.\n6. Differentiate between amplification and qualifying display\nrules\n7. Identify at least one cultural difference in display rules.\n8. Explain the ingroup advantage when interpreting\nemotions.\nCulture and Emotion | 219  Components of\nEmotions\nEmotions are rapid information-processing systems that help\nus act with minimal thinking (Tooby & Cosmides, 2008).\nProblems associated with birth, battle, death, and seduction\nhave occurred throughout evolutionary history and emotions\nevolved to aid humans in adapting to those problems rapidly\nand with minimal conscious cognitive intervention. If we did\nnot have emotions, we could not make rapid decisions\nconcerning whether to attack, defend, flee, care for others,\nreject food, or approach something useful, all of which were\nfunctionally adaptive in our evolutionary history and helped us\nto survive. For instance, drinking spoiled milk or eating rotten\neggs has negative consequences for our welfare. The emotion\nof disgust, however, helps us immediately act by not ingesting\nthem in the first place or by vomiting them out. This response\nis adaptive because it aids, ultimately, in our survival and allows\nus to act immediately without much thinking. In some\ninstances, taking the time to sit and rationally think about what\nto do, calculating cost\u2013benefit ratios in one\u2019s mind, is a luxury\nthat might cost one one\u2019s life. Emotions evolved so that we can\nact without that depth of thinking.\nComponents of Emotions | 221 The emotion of disgust serves to protect us from toxins\nand contamination, of the physical and moral variety.\n[Image: Runs with Scissors and provided by Noba\nProject]\nPhysiological Component of Emotion\nEmotions prepare the body for action by simultaneously\nactivating certain systems and deactivating others in order to\nprevent the chaos of competing systems operating at the\nsame time, allowing for coordinated responses to\nenvironmental stimuli (Levenson, 1999). For instance, when we\nare afraid, our bodies shut down temporarily unneeded\ndigestive processes, resulting in saliva reduction (a dry mouth);\nblood flows disproportionately to the lower half of the body;\nthe visual field expands; and air is breathed in, all preparing\nthe body to flee. One common misunderstanding many people\nhave when thinking about emotions, however, is the belief that\nemotions must always directly produce action. This is not true.\n222 | Components of Emotions Emotion certainly prepares the body for action; but whether\npeople actually engage in action is dependent on many\nfactors, such as the context within which the emotion has\noccurred, the perceived consequences of one\u2019s actions and\nprevious experiences (Baumeister, Vohs, DeWall, & Zhang,\n2007; Matsumoto & Wilson, 2008).\nEmotions can act as signals to our friends and partners, conveying\ninformation about the quality of the relationship. [Image:\nmynameisharsha and is provided by Noba Project]\nComponents of Emotions | 223 Behavioral Component of Emotion\nEmotions prepare us for behavior and they are important\nmotivators of future behavior. Many of us strive to experience\nthe feelings of satisfaction, joy, pride, or triumph in our\naccomplishments and achievements. At the same time, we\nalso work very hard to avoid strong negative feelings. For\nexample, once we have felt the emotion of disgust when\ndrinking the spoiled milk, we generally work very hard to avoid\nhaving those feelings again (e.g., checking the expiration date\non the label before buying the milk, smelling the milk before\ndrinking it, watching if the milk curdles in one\u2019s coffee before\ndrinking it). Emotions, therefore, not only influence immediate\nactions but also serve as an important motivational basis for\nfuture behaviors.\nEmotions are expressed both verbally through words and\nnonverbally through facial expressions, voices, gestures, body\npostures, and movements. Research suggests that we are quite\nsensitive to the emotional information communicated through\nbody language, even if we\u2019re not consciously aware of it (de\nGelder, 2006; Tamietto et al., 2009). The fact is that humans are\nconstantly expressing emotions when interacting with others.\nEmotions and their expressions communicate information to\nothers about our feelings and intentions.\nCognitive Component of Emotion\nEmotions are also connected to thoughts and memories.\nCognitive processes (thinking) play an important role in\ninterpreting the events that triggered the emotional response\nin the first place. Imagine you are walking down a trail and\nyou think you see a snake. Chances are physiological responses\nare happening automatically (rapid heartbeat and breathing,\n224 | Components of Emotions sweating, muscle tension) as your body prepares for action.\nSuddenly, you realize that it is not a snake on the trail but\njust a piece of climbing rope left behind. Your appraisal of the\nsituation as non-threatening signals to your body that it can\ndeactivate the arousal system. These appraisals are informed\nby our experiences, backgrounds, and culture. This means that\ndifferent people may have different emotional experiences\neven when faced with similar circumstances.\nCognitive appraisals (evaluation) play a key role in interpreting\nemotional responses to situations. [Image by Mohamad Hassan, CC \u2013\nBY, https://pxhere.com/en/photo/1439803]\nMemories are not just facts that are encoded in our brains,\nthey are colored with the emotions felt at those times the\nfacts occurred (Wang & Ross, 2007). In this way emotions serve\nas the neural glue that connects those disparate facts in our\nminds. That is why it is easier to remember happy thoughts\nComponents of Emotions | 225 when happy, and angry times when angry. Emotions serve as\nthe affective basis of many attitudes, values, and beliefs that\nwe have about the world and the people around us. Without\nemotions those attitudes, values, and beliefs would be just\nstatements without meaning, and emotions give those\nstatements meaning. Emotions influence our thinking\nprocesses, sometimes in constructive ways, sometimes in\nunconstructive ways. It is difficult to think critically and clearly\nwhen we feel intense emotions, but easier when we are not\noverwhelmed with emotions (Matsumoto, Hirayama, & LeRoux,\n2006).\n226 | Components of Emotions Emotions and Culture\nAs you might expect (after reading about the components of\nemotion), people tend to respond similarly in terms of\nphysiological (or bodily) expression. Also, our ability to\nrecognize and produce facial expressions of emotion appears\nto be universal. Research conducted with individuals born blind\nat birth found that the same facial expression of emotions were\nproduced (smiling when happy, frowning when sad), despite\nthese individuals never having the opportunity to observe\nthese facial displays of emotion in other people. This suggests\nthat facial muscles movements involved in generating\nemotional expressions is universal and not the result of learned\nbehavior. Charles Darwin\u2019s book The Expression of Emotions in\nMan and Animals (1872) very similar morphology in the facial\nexpressions of non-human primates like chimpanzees and\norangutans to human facial expressions. In fact, there is\nsubstantial evidence for seven universal emotions that are each\nassociated with distinct facial expressions. These include:\nhappiness, surprise, sadness, fright, disgust, contempt, and\nanger (Ekman & Keltner, 1997).\nEkman and Friesen (1972) conducted one of the first\nscientific studies of emotion which raised important questions\nabout the role of culture in shaping universal components of\nemotion. Ekman and Friesen then took photos of people\nposing with these different expressions (Figure 1). With the help\nof colleagues at different universities around the world, Ekman\nand Friesen showed these pictures to members of vastly\ndifferent cultures, gave them a list of emotion words\n(translated into the relevant languages) and asked them to\nmatch the facial expressions in the photos with their\ncorresponding emotion words on the list (Ekman & Friesen,\n1971; Ekman et al., 1987).\nEmotions and Culture | 227 Early research on emotions found seven facial expressions that are\nconsidered universal. [Image by Icerko L\u00fddia, CC BY,\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Universal_emotions7.JPG]\nAcross cultures, participants matched each picture to the same\nemotion word at levels greater than chance. This led Ekman\nand his colleagues to conclude that there are universally\nrecognized emotional facial expressions.\n\u2022 Happiness\n\u2022 Surprise\n\u2022 Sadness\n\u2022 Fright\n\u2022 Disgust\n\u2022 Contempt\n\u2022 Anger (Ekman & Keltner, 1997).\nAt the same time, Ekman and Friesen found considerable\nvariability across cultures in recognition rates. For instance, 95%\nof participants in the United States associated a smile with\nhappiness, only 69% of Sumatran participants made the same\n228 | Emotions and Culture association. Similarly, 86% of participants in the United States\nassociated wrinkling of the nose with disgust, but only 60%\nof Japanese made the same association with a wrinkled nose\n(Ekman et al., 1987). Ekman and colleagues interpreted this\nvariation as demonstrating cultural differences in the way that\npeople show or display emotion (Ekman, 1972).\nCultural display rules teach us how to manage our emotions. For\nexample, in many Asian countries children are taught to mute their\nemotions, especially negative emotions like anger. [Image by\njohn.gillespie and provide by Noba Project]\nCultural display rules are a collection of culturally specific\nstandards that govern the type and frequency of emotional\nEmotions and Culture | 229 displays that are socially acceptable (Malatesta & Haviland,\n1982). In the United States we are taught that \u201cbig boys don\u2019t\ncry\u201d or we laugh at our boss\u2019s jokes even though we don\u2019t think\nthey are funny.\nA more recent study simultaneously studied physiological\nresponses and facial expressions and found that regardless of\nculture, people tend to respond similarly in terms of\nphysiological (or bodily) expression. European American and\nHmong (pronounced \u201cmuhng\u201d) American participants were\nasked to relive various emotional episodes in their lives (e.g.,\nwhen they lost something or someone they loved; when\nsomething good happened) (Tsai, Chentsova-Dutton, Freire-\nBebeau, & Przymus, 2002). At the level of physiological arousal\n(e.g., heart rate), there were no differences in how the\nparticipants responded but their facial expressive behavior told\na different story.\nWhen reliving events that elicited happiness, pride, and love,\nEuropean Americans smiled more frequently and more\nintensely than did their Hmong counterparts\u2014though all\nparticipants reported feeling happy, proud, and in love at\nsimilar levels of intensity. And similar patterns have emerged\nin studies comparing European Americans with Chinese\nAmericans during different emotion-eliciting tasks (Tsai et al.,\n2002; Tsai, Levenson, & McCoy, 2006; Tsai, Levenson, &\nCarstensen, 2000). While the physiological aspects of\nemotional responses appear to be similar across cultures, their\naccompanying facial expressions are more culturally\ndistinctive.\nBy affecting how individuals express their emotions, culture\nalso influences how people experience them as well. In the\nUnited States it is acceptable to express negative emotions\nlike fear, anger, and disgust both alone and in the presence\nof others, while Japanese individuals only do so while alone\n(Matsumoto, 1990). Matsumoto, Yoo and Nakagawa (2008)\nfound that individuals from collectivist cultures were more\n230 | Emotions and Culture likely to engage in suppression of emotional reaction so they\ncan evaluate which response is most appropriate in a given\ncontext (Matsumoto, Yoo, & Nakagawa, 2008).\nIncreasing research has demonstrated cultural differences\nnot only in display rules, but also the degree to which people\nfocus on the face rather than other aspects of the social context\n(Masuda, Ellsworth, Mesquita, Leu, Tanida, & Van de Veerdonk,\n2008), and on different features of the face (Yuki, Maddux, &\nMatsuda, 2007) when perceiving others\u2019 emotions. For\nexample, people from the United States tend to focus on the\nmouth when interpreting others\u2019 emotions, whereas people\nfrom Japan tend to focus on the eyes. Cultural differences exist\nwhen evaluating and interpreting emotional experiences that\nunderlie facial expressions of emotion but there is a distinct\nin-group advantage. Individuals from the same culture to will\nrecognize the emotions of others of the same culture\nsomewhat better than those from a different culture.\nOur culturally moderated emotions can help us engage in\nsocially appropriate behaviors, as defined by our cultures, and\navoid cultural miscommunication. Matsumoto argues (2018)\nthat without display rules it would be very difficult for groups\nand societies to function effectively, and even for humans to\nsurvive as a species, if emotions were not regulated in culturally\ndefined ways for the common, social good.\nEmotions and Culture | 231 Motivation\nMotivation describes the wants or needs that direct behavior\ntoward a goal. Motivations can be intrinsic (arising from\ninternal factors) or extrinsic (arising from external factors).\nIntrinsically motivated behaviors are performed because of the\nsense of personal satisfaction that they bring, while extrinsically\nmotivated behaviors are performed in order to receive\nsomething from others.\nThink about why you are currently in college. Are you here\nbecause you enjoy learning and want to pursue an education\nto make yourself a more well-rounded individual? If so, then\nyou are intrinsically motivated. However, if you are here\nbecause you want to get a college degree to make yourself\nmore marketable for a high-paying career or to satisfy the\ndemands of your parents, then your motivation is more\nextrinsic in nature. In reality, our motivations are often a mix of\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the nature of the mix of\nthese factors might change over time (often in ways that seem\ncounter-intuitive). Physical reinforcement (such as money) and\nverbal reinforcement (such as praise) may affect an individual\nin very different ways. Tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to\nhave more negative effects on intrinsic motivation than do\nintangible rewards (i.e., praise). The expectation of the extrinsic\nmotivator by an individual is crucial: If the person expects to\nreceive an extrinsic reward (money) then intrinsic motivation\nfor the task tends to be reduced. If there is no such expectation\n(no money), and then extrinsic motivation is presented as a\nsurprise, then intrinsic motivation (personal desire) for the task\ntends to persist (Deci et al., 1999).\n232 | Motivation Figure 1. Intrinsic motivation comes from within a person and\nextrinsic motivation come from outside the person. [Image provided\nby Open Stax Psychology]\nOur thoughts, behaviors and motivations are strongly\ninfluenced by affective experiences known as drive states.\nThese drive states motivate us to fulfill goals that are beneficial\nto our survival and reproduction. Drive states differ from other\naffective or emotional states in terms of the biological\nfunctions they accomplish. All affective states are positive or\nnegative and serve to motivate approach or avoidance\nbehaviors (Zajonc, 1998) but drive states are unique. Drive\nstates generate behaviors that result in specific benefits for\nthe body. For example, hunger directs individuals to eat foods\nthat increase blood sugar levels in the body, while thirst causes\nindividuals to drink fluids that increase water levels in the body.\nSleep and sexual arousal are also drive states that generally\nfunction to promote our survival and reproduction.\nAccording to the drive theory of motivation, deviations from\nour stable state creates physiological needs. These needs result\nin psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the\nneed and, ultimately, bring the system back to homeostasis \u2013\nback to balance. For example, if it\u2019s been a while since you ate,\nMotivation | 233 your blood sugar levels will drop below normal. This low blood\nsugar will induce a physiological need and a corresponding\ndrive state (i.e., hunger) that will direct you to seek out and\nconsume food. Many homeostatic mechanisms, such as blood\ncirculation and immune responses, are automatic and\nnonconscious. Some may require direction action.\nDifferent drive states have different triggers. Most drive states\nrespond to both internal and external cues, but the\ncombinations of internal and external cues, and the specific\ntypes of cues, differ between drives. Hunger, for example,\ndepends on internal, visceral signals as well as sensory signals,\nsuch as the sight or smell of tasty food. Once we have engaged\nin a behavior that successfully reduces a drive, we are more\nlikely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that\ndrive in the future (Graham & Weiner, 1996). Drive states affect\nmany psychological processes, such as perception, attention,\nemotion, and motivation, and influences the behaviors that\nthese processes generate.\n234 | Motivation Chapter Review\nRecognizing cultural similarities and differences in emotion\nmay provide insights into other psychological health and well-\nbeing, as well as preventing potentially harmful\nmiscommunication.

Some\npeople seem to worry a lot while others never seem to get\nanxious. Each time we use words like social, outgoing, reserved\nor anxious to describe people around us, we are talking about a\nperson\u2019s personality. Personality is one of the things that make\nus unique from one another. Our personalities are thought to\nbe long term, stable, and not easily changed (Caspi, Roberts,\n& Shiner, 2005) leading some psychologists argue that\npersonality is heritable and biological.\nPersonality is not the same thing as character, which refers to\nqualities that a culture considers good and bad. Temperament,\nas we learned earlier, is hereditary and includes sensitivity,\nmoods, irritability, and distractibility. In this way, temperament\ncan be seen as part of our personality and offers support for\nbiological and universal aspects of personality.\nOnce we understand someone\u2019s personality, we can predict\nhow that person will behave in a variety of situations. Think\nabout what it takes to be successful in college. You might say\nthat intelligence is factor in college success and you would\nbe correct but personality researchers have also found that\ntraits like Conscientiousness play an important role in college\nsuccess. Highly conscientious individuals study hard, get their\nwork done on time, and are less distracted by nonessential\nactivities that take time away from school work. Over the long\nterm, this consistent pattern of behaviors can add up to\nmeaningful differences in academic and professional\ndevelopment. Personality traits are not just a useful way to\ndescribe people; they actually help psychologists predict if\nIntroduction to Personality | 239 someone is going to be a good worker, how long he or she will\nlive, and the types of jobs and activities the person will enjoy.\nThere are many psychological perspectives that try to explain\npersonality including behaviorist, humanist and sociocultural\nperspectives. This chapter will focus solely on the trait theory\nof personality and how combinations of traits create unique\npersonality profiles. This chapter will also review how\npersonality traits are identified and measured across cultures.\n240 | Introduction to Personality Trait Theory\nPersonality traits reflect people\u2019s characteristic patterns of\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Trait theory in psychology\nrests on the idea that people differ from one another based on\nthe strength and intensity of basic trait dimensions. There are\nthree criteria that characterize personality traits: (1) consistency,\n(2) stability, and (3) individual differences.\n\u2022 Individuals must be somewhat consistent across\nsituations in their behaviors related to the trait. For\nexample, if they are talkative at home, they tend also to be\ntalkative at work.\nFigure 1. Personality traits should be consistent across settings.\n\u2022 A trait must also be somewhat stable over time as\ndemonstrated behaviors related to the trait. For example,\nat age 30 if someone is talkative they will also tend to be\ntalkative at age 40.\nTrait Theory | 241 Figure 2. Personality traits should be stable over time.\n\u2022 People differ from one another on behaviors related to the\ntrait. People differ on how frequently they talk and so\npersonality traits such as talkative exist.\nFigure 3. Personality traits will be different from person to person.\n242 | Trait Theory A major challenge for trait theorists was how to identify traits.\nThey started by generating a list of English adjectives (after\nreading about bias in Chapter 3 I bet you can see a problem\nhere). Early trait theorists Allport and Odbert identified about\n18, 000 words in the English language that could describe\npeople (Allport & Odbert, 1936). The list was later reduced to\n4,500 by Allport but even this was far too many traits. In an\neffort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond\nCattell (1946, 1957) narrowed the list to 16 factors and developed\na personality assessment called the 16PF. Later, psychologists\nHans and Sybil Eysenck focused on temperament (Eysenck,\n1990, 1992; Eysenck and Eysenck, 1963) and hypothesized two\nspecific personality dimensions: extroversion/introversion and\nneuroticism/stability.\nTrait Theory | 243 Hans and Sybil Eysenck believed that our personality traits\nare influenced by our genetic inheritance. [Image provided\nby penStax College]\nWhile Cattell\u2019s 16 factors may be too broad, the 2-factor system\nproposed by the Eysenck\u2019s has been criticized for being too\nnarrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor\nModel (FFM), effectively hits a middle ground. The five factors\nare commonly referred to as the Big Five personality traits\n(McCrae & Costa, 1987). It is the most popular theory in\n244 | Trait Theory personality psychology today and the most accurate\napproximation of the basic trait dimensions (Funder, 2010).\nTraits are scored along a continuum, from high to low rather\nthan present or absent (all or none). This means that when\npsychologists talk about Introverts (e.g., quiet, withdrawn,\nreserved) and Extroverts (e.g., outgoing, social, talkative), they\nare not really talking about two distinct types of people but\nrather they are talking about people who score relatively low or\nrelatively high along a continuous dimension.\nThe five traits are openness to experience, conscientiousness,\nextroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. A helpful way to\nremember the traits is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.\nScores on the Big Five traits are mostly independent which\nmeans that a person\u2019s position on the continuum for one trait\ntells very little about their standing on the other traits. For\nexample, a person can be extremely high in Extraversion and\nbe either high or low on Neuroticism. Similarly, a person can\nbe low in Agreeableness and be either high or low in\nConscientiousness. In the FFM you need five scores to describe\nmost of an individual\u2019s personality.\nTrait Theory | 245 Five Factor Model and\nCross-Cultural\nResearch\nWe have learned that culture is transmitted to people through\nlanguage, as well as through social norms which establish\nacceptable and unacceptable behaviors which are then\nrewarded or punished (Henrich, 2016; Triandis & Suh, 2002).\nWith an increased understanding of cultural learning,\npsychologists have become interested in the role of culture in\nunderstanding personality.\n246 | Five Factor Model and\nCross-Cultural Research Figure 1. Five Factor Model explains traits using dimensions where\nindividuals have more or less of a trait. [Image provided by OpenStax\nPsychology]\nThe idea that personality can be described and explained by\nfive traits has important implications, as does the fact that\nmost personality tests were constructed and initially tested in\nWestern countries (e.g., method validation from Chapter 3).\nWestern ideas about personality may not apply to other\ncultures (Benet-Martinez & Oishi, 2008).\nThere are two main cultural approaches for researching\npersonality.\nFive Factor Model and Cross-Cultural Research | 247 \u2022 Etic traits are considered universal constructs that are\nevident across cultures and represent a biological bases of\nhuman personality. If the Big Five are universal then they\nshould appear across all cultures (McCrae and Allik, 2002).\n\u2022 Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture and are\ndetermined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and\ncharacteristics. If personality traits are unique to individual\ncultures then different traits should appear in different\ncultures.\nCross cultural research of personality uses an etic framework\nand researchers must ensure equivalence of the personality\ntest through validation testing. The instrument must include\nequivalence in meaning, as well as demonstrate validity and\nreliability (Matsumoto & Luang, 2013). For example, the phrase\nfeeling blue is used to describe sadness in Westernized\ncultures but does not translate to other languages. Differences\nin personality across cultures could be due to real cultural\ndifferences, but they could also be consequences of poor\ntranslations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles\nacross cultures (Schmitt, Allik, McCrae, & Benet-Mart\u00ednez, 2007).\nMost of the cross-cultural research on FFM and Big Five has\nbeen done using the NEO-PI (and its subsequent revisions)\nwhich has demonstrated equivalence, reliability and validity\nacross several cross-cultural studies (Costa & McCrae, 1987;\nMcCrae, Costa & Martin, 2005). Research using the NEO-PI\nfound support for the entire Five-Factor Model in Chinese,\nDutch, Italian, Hungarian, German, Australian, South African,\nCanadian, Finnish, Polish, Portuguese, Israeli, Korean, Japanese,\nand Filipino samples, in addition to other samples (McCrae,\nCosta, Del Pilar, Rolland, & Parker, 1998).\nRentfrow, Kosinski, Stillwell, Gosling, Jokela and Potter (2013)\nidentified regional personality differences within the United\nStates using the Big Five personality dimensions. The\nresearchers analyzed responses from over 1.5 million\n248 | Five Factor Model and Cross-Cultural Research individuals found that there are three distinct regional\npersonality clusters:\nResearchers found three distinct regional personality clusters in the\nUnited States that are consistent with the FFM [Image provided by\nLumen Learning, https://courses.lumenlearning.com/\nsuny-hccc-ss-151-1/chapter/cultural-understandings-of-personality/]\nCluster 1 is in the Upper Midwest and Deep South and is\ndominated by people who fall into the friendly and\nconventional personality which is defined by moderately high\nlevels of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness,\nmoderately low Neuroticism, and very low Openness. The\ncluster has predominantly White residents with comparatively\nlow levels of education, wealth, economic innovation, and\nsocial tolerance but are civically engaged in their communities.\nCluster 2 includes the West and is dominated by people who\nare more relaxed, emotionally stable, calm, and creative which\nFive Factor Model and Cross-Cultural Research | 249 is defined as low Extraversion and Agreeableness, very low\nNeuroticism, and very high Openness. There are\ndisproportionate numbers of non-White residents in this\nregion, in addition to people who are wealthy, educated, and\neconomically innovative.\nCluster 3 includes the Northeast which has more people who\nare stressed, irritable, and depressed. The personality profile\nshows low Extraversion, very low Agreeableness and\nConscientiousness, very high Neuroticism, and moderately\nhigh Openness. There are disproportionate numbers of older\nadults and women in this region, in addition to affluent and\ncollege-educated individuals.\nOne explanation for the regional differences is selective\nmigration (Rentfrow et al., 2013). Selective migration is the\nconcept that people choose to move to places that are\ncompatible with their personalities and needs. For example, a\nperson high on the agreeable scale would likely want to live\nnear family and friends, and would choose to settle or remain\nin such an area. In contrast, someone high on openness would\nprefer to settle in a place that is recognized as diverse and\ninnovative (such as California).\nPersonality tests rely on self-report which is susceptible to\nresponse bias like socially desirability responding. To evaluate\nthis possibility, McCrae and colleagues (2005) recruited\nstudents from 50 cultural groups and modified the NEO-PI\nto be in the third person (i.e., he, she, his, her). The research\nparticipants were asked to complete the form on someone else\nthat they knew very well (McCrae et al., 2005). The same five\nfactors emerged in this study. These results provided empirical\nsupport for the FFM and for the use of self-report instruments\nwhen conducting cross-cultural personality research. Think\nabout it \u2013 there was no reason for the students to respond in\na desirable way because they were answering questions about\nsomeone else.\n250 | Five Factor Model and Cross-Cultural Research Big Five as Universals\nFinding similar factors across many cultures has provided\nsupport for the universality of of the FFM personality trait\nstructure. The five dimensions (Big Five) also seem to emerge\nin similar developmental stages (McCrae & Costa, 1997; McCrae\net al., 1999) which provides additional support for universal\ntraits. Longitudinal studies have found consistency in\npersonality changes that occur across the lifetime, in both\nadults and adolescents (McCrae, et al., 1999; McCrae et al.,\n2000). Big Five research conducted with American and Flemish\nteens showed similar changes in personality from ages 12 to\n18 (McCrae, et al., 2000) In addition, the period from young\nadulthood to middle adulthood is associated with increases\nin Conscientiousness and Agreeableness (Donnellan & Lucas,\n2008) and decreases in Neuroticism, Openness, and\nExtraversion in several countries, including the United States,\nGermany, Italy, Portugal, Croatia, and South Korea (McCrae, et\nal.,1999; Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, & Costa, 2005).\nBig Five or More\nAlthough support for the Big Five across cultures is strong, it\nis unclear whether or not the Big Five personality traits are\nthe best possible measure of personality for all cultures. Some\nresearchers suggest that important aspects of some cultures\nare not captured by the Five Factor Model (Funder, 2010;\nAshton, et al., 2004; Ashton & Lee, 2007). Results from several\nEuropean and Asian studies have found overlapping\ndimensions with the Five Factor Model, as well as additional,\nculturally unique dimensions (Church, 2002). Several cross-\ncultural studies have identified other dimensions of personality\nBig Five as Universals | 251 not captured by the Big Five including traits unique to China,\nDenmark, Bolivia and the Philippines.\nChinese psychologists created an indigenous personality test\nnamed the Chinese Personality Assessment Inventory (CPAI)\nwhich identified several traits that were not part of the Big Five\nthat have been labelled Interpersonal Relatedness (Cheung,\nLeung, Fan, Song, Zhang, & Zhang, 1996; Cheung, et al., 2001).\nSupport for this model was originally developed in studies\nconducted in mainland China and Hong Kong, China, but the\nexistence of the Interpersonal Relatedness dimension of\npersonality has also been found in samples from Singapore,\nHawaii, and the Midwestern United States.\nA sixth dimension, Interpersonal Relatedness was identified using the\nChinese Personality Assessment Inventory (CPAI) [Image By Daderot,\nPublic domain, from Wikimedia Commons]\nA distinct Filipino personality structure was also identified\n252 | Big Five as Universals when an indigenous personality test was used in conjunction\nwith a Western developed personality test. Church and\ncolleagues (1998, 2002) used indigenous Filipino personality\nscales and the revised NEO-PI and found that there was\noverlap between the Filipino scales and the Five Factor Model.\nResearchers also found several unique indigenous factors such\nas Pagkamadaldal (Social Curiosity) and\nPagkamapagsapalaran (Risk-Taking) that had predictive\npower greater than the Five Factor Model alone (Katigbak,\nChurch, Guanzon-Lape\u00f1a, Carlota, & del Pilar, 2002). These new\nindigenous factors are highly predictive of smoking, gambling,\npraying and tolerance of behaviors outside of social norms\n(Matsumoto & Luang, 2013).\nPersonality researchers several unique indigenous factors such as\nPagkamadaldal (Social Curiosity) and Pagkamapagsapalaran\n(Risk-Taking). [Image By Ed_Davad, CC0, https://pixabay.com/\np-597473/?no_redirect]\nBig Five as Universals | 253 Studies conducted in Denmark and the Netherlands found an\nauthoritarian personality structure. Hofstede and colleagues\n(1993) analyzed data from 1,300 Danes and found a sixth\ndimension not related to the five-factor model which they\nlabelled Authoritarianism. This is an interesting finding\nbecause dominance and authoritarianism is connected to\nanimal studies and animal personality (Hofstede, Bond & Luk,\n1993).\nTsimane, a horticultural group living in the Bolivian Amazon\nwere administered a modified version of the FFM and there\nwas little support for the five factors \u2013 two factors emerged that\nwere not part of the Big Five. This is an example of research\nthat used a non-industrial, non- WEIRDO sample and raises\nquestions about whether FFM can generalize to non-industrial\ncultures (Gurven et al., 2013).\nAshton and Lee (2007) identified Honesty-Humility as a sixth\ndimension of personality when using English and Asian based\nadjectives to describe traits. People high in this trait are sincere,\nfair, and modest; whereas those low in the trait are\nmanipulative, narcissistic, and self-centered. The HEXACO\nmodel is often used when traits of agreeableness or emotions\nare of particular interest in research. It should be clear that\nalthough there is strong support for the Big Five across\ncultures, some research suggests the existence of other traits\nbesides simply the Big Five, which may ultimately improve our\nunderstanding of personality across different cultures.\n254 | Big Five as Universals Cultural Considerations\nand Indigenous\nPersonality\nWhen measuring personality, we need to remember that when\ncomparing traits across cultures we are using group averages.\nThere are certainly differences in personality traits between\ncultural groups but there is still a lot variability that exists within\na specific culture (McCrae et al., 2005). Individualist cultures\nand collectivist cultures place emphasis on different basic\nvalues. People who live in individualist cultures tend to believe\nthat independence, competition, and personal achievement\nare important. Individuals in Western nations such as the\nUnited States, England, and Australia score high on\nindividualism (Oyserman, Coon, & Kemmelmier, 2002). People\nwho live in collectivist cultures value social harmony,\nrespectfulness, and group needs over individual needs.\nIndividuals who live in countries in Asia, Africa, and South\nAmerica score high on collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; Triandis,\n1995). These values influence personality. For example, Yang\n(2006) found that people in individualist cultures displayed\nmore personally oriented personality traits, whereas people in\ncollectivist cultures displayed more socially oriented\npersonality traits.\nWe also need to remember that people do not act\nconsistently from one situation to the next and people are\ninfluenced by situational forces and culture. For example,\nindividuals who score high on the Extraversion scale are likely\nto be outgoing and enjoy socializing but where, when and how\nthey socialize will be influenced by culture (McCrae et al., 1998).\nCultural Considerations and\nIndigenous Personality | 255 Indigenous Personality\nMuch of this chapter has been dedicated to the etic approach\nfor understanding personality which posits that personality is\ninnate, biological and universal but still acknowledges that\nculture plays an important in shaping personality by way of\ngeography (environment), resources, and social supports.\nIndigenous Personality is a perspective that suggests\npersonality can only be understood and interpreted within the\ncontext of the culture. In this way personality is considered\nemic, meaning that it is culturally specific and can only\nunderstood within the culture from which it originates. This\nmeans that personality is not something that can be measured\nby a universal test.\nThe indigenous approach came about in reaction to the\ndominance of Western approaches to the study of personality\nin non-Western settings (Cheung et al., 2011). Because Western-\nbased personality assessments cannot fully capture the\npersonality constructs of other cultures, the indigenous model\nhas led to the development of personality assessment\ninstruments that are based on constructs relevant to the\nculture being studied (Cheung et al., 2011). Although there is\ndebate within the indigenous psychology movement about\nwhether indigenous psychology represents a more\nuniversalistic or a more relativistic approach (Chakkarath, 2012),\nmost of these 10 characteristics are advocated by the majority\nof those in the indigenous psychology movement.\n256 | Cultural Considerations and Indigenous Personality Self and Culture\nAt the foundation of all human behavior is the self\u2014our sense\nof personal identity and of who we are as individuals. Because\nan understanding of the self is so important, it has been\nstudied for many years by psychologists (James, 1890; Mead,\n1934) and is still one of the most important and most\nresearched topics in psychology (Dweck & Grant, 2008; Taylor &\nSherman, 2008).\nIdentity\nIdentity refers to the way individuals understand themselves as\npart of a social group. It is a universal construct and depends on\nhow we view ourselves and how we are recognized by others.\nIdentity may be acquired indirectly from parents, peers, and\nother community members or more directly through\nenculturation. A person may hold multiple identities such as\nteacher, father, or friend. Each position has its own meanings\nand expectations that are internalized as identity. In this way,\nthe specific content of any individual\u2019s or group\u2019s identity is\nculturally determined. Also, forming a connection with your\nidentity is influenced by your culture. For example, in the\nUnited States it is common to link identity with a particular\nethnic or racial group (e.g., Hispanic, African American, Asian\nAmerican, and Jewish American among others) but we should\nremember that these categories are products of immigration\nand history. The history is unique to the United States so\nindividuals from other cultures do not identify with the same\ncultural groups (Matsumoto & Luang, 2013).\nWe should also think of identity as dynamic and fluid. It can\nchange depending on the context and the culture. Think about\nSelf and Culture | 257 it \u2013 when someone asks you where you are from, if you are in a\nforeign country you might say the United States. In a different\nsituation you might say that you are from California even\nthough you were actually born in Kansas and in a very small\nstate like Hawaii you might identify by your high school\n(Matsumoto & Luang, 2013).\nOur personal identity is the way that we understand\nourselves and is closely related to our concept of self. Social\nidentity reflects our understanding that we are part of social\ngroups. Our sense of self is linked to how we see the world\naround us and how we see our relationships.\nSelf\nSome nonhuman animals, including chimpanzees,\norangutans, and perhaps dolphins, have at least a primitive\nsense of self (Boysen & Himes, 1999). We know this because\nof some interesting experiments that have been done with\nanimals. In one study (Gallup, 1970), researchers painted a red\ndot on the forehead of anesthetized chimpanzees and then\nplaced the animals in a cage with a mirror. When the chimps\nwoke up and looked in the mirror, they touched the dot on\ntheir faces, not the dot on the faces in the mirror. This action\nsuggests that the chimps understood that they were looking at\nthemselves and not at other animals, and thus we can assume\nthat they are able to realize that they exist as individuals. Most\nother animals, including dogs, cats, and monkeys, never realize\nthat it is themselves they see in a mirror.\n258 | Self and Culture Chimpanzees seem to understand a sense of self but this in unique\namong animals. [Image By a_m_o_u_n_t, Monkey Staring in Mirror\nThinking, CC 0, https://pixabay.com/en/\nmonkey-mirror-stare-thinking-3512996/]\nInfants who have similar red dots painted on their foreheads\nrecognize themselves in a mirror in the same way that chimps\ndo, and they do this by about 18 months of age (Asendorpf,\nWarkentin, & Baudonni\u00e8re, 1996; Povinelli, Landau, & Perilloux,\n1996). The child\u2019s knowledge about the self continues to\ndevelop as the child grows. By two years of age, the infant\nbecomes aware of his or her gender as a boy or a girl. At age\nfour, the child\u2019s self-descriptions are likely to be based on\nphysical features, such as hair color, and by about age six, the\nchild is able to understand basic emotions and the concepts\nof traits, being able to make statements such as \u201cI am a nice\nperson\u201d (Harter, 1998).\nBy the time children are in grade school, they have learned\nthat they are unique individuals, and they can think about and\nanalyze their own behavior. They also begin to show awareness\nSelf and Culture | 259 of the social situation\u2014they understand that other people are\nlooking at and judging them the same way that they are\nlooking at and judging others (Doherty, 2009).\nInfants recognize themselves in a mirror by about 18 months of age\n[Image By roseoftimothywoods Baby Kissing the Mirror CC-BY 2.0\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/madfox/29367611/]\n260 | Self and Culture Characteristics of the\nSelf-Concept\nPart of what is developing in children as they grow is the\nfundamental cognitive part of the self, known as the self-\nconcept. The self-concept is a knowledge representation that\ncontains knowledge about us, including our beliefs about our\npersonality traits, physical characteristics, abilities, values,\ngoals, and roles, as well as the knowledge that we exist as\nindividuals.\nThe specific content of our self-concept powerfully affects\nthe way that we process information relating to ourselves. But\nhow can we measure that specific content? One way is by\nusing self-report tests. One of these is a deceptively simple\nfill-in-the-blank measure that has been widely used by many\nscientists to get a picture of the self-concept (Rees & Nicholson,\n1994). All of the 20 items in the measure are exactly the same,\nbut the person is asked to fill in a different response for each\nstatement. This self-report measure, known as the Twenty\nStatements Test (TST), can reveal a lot about a person because\nit is designed to measure the most accessible\u2014and thus the\nmost important\u2014parts of a person\u2019s self-concept.\nTwenty Statements Test\nTry it for yourself (at least 5 times)\nI am (fill in the blank) _______________________________\nCharacteristics of the\nSelf-Concept | 261 I am (fill in the blank) _______________________________\nI am (fill in the blank) _______________________________\nI am (fill in the blank) _______________________________\nI am (fill in the blank) _______________________________\nAlthough each person has a unique self-concept, we can\nidentify some characteristics that are common across the\nresponses given by different people on the measure.\n\u2022 Physical characteristics\n\u2022 Personality\n\u2022 Social identity\nPhysical characteristics are an important component of the\nself-concept, and they are mentioned by many people when\nthey describe themselves. If you\u2019ve been concerned lately that\nyou\u2019ve been gaining weight, you might write, \u201cI am\noverweight.\u201d If you think you\u2019re particularly good looking (\u201cI am\nattractive\u201d), or if you think you\u2019re too short (\u201cI am too short\u201d).\nThose things might have been reflected in your responses. Our\nphysical characteristics are important to our self-concept\nbecause we realize that other people use them to judge us.\nPeople often list the physical characteristics that make them\ndifferent from others in either positive or negative ways (\u201cI am\nblond,\u201d \u201cI am short\u201d), in part because they understand that\nthese characteristics are salient and thus likely to be used by\nothers when judging them (McGuire, McGuire, Child, & Fujioka,\n1978).\nA second aspect of the self-concept relating to personal\ncharacteristics is made up of personality traits\u2014the specific\nand stable personality characteristics that describe an\n262 | Characteristics of the Self-Concept individual (\u201cI am friendly,\u201d \u201cI am shy,\u201d \u201cI am persistent\u201d). These\nindividual differences are important determinants of behavior,\nand this aspect of the self-concept varies among people.\nInfants do not have a self-concept but they do have an identity. ]No\nAttribution Baby Sleeping, CC0, https://www.maxpixel.net/\nCute-Infant-Baby-Sleeping-Baby-Sleeping-Rest-2582305]\nThe remainder of the self-concept reflects its more external,\nsocial components; for example, memberships in the social\ngroups that we belong to and care about. Common responses\nfor this component may include \u201cI am an artist,\u201d \u201cI am Jewish,\u201d\nand \u201cI am a mother, sister, daughter.\u201d As we will see later in this\nchapter, group memberships form an important part of the\nself-concept because they provide us with our social identity\n\u2014the sense of our self that involves our memberships in social\ngroups.\nCharacteristics of the Self-Concept | 263 Self and Culture\nAlthough we all define ourselves in relation to these three\nbroad categories of characteristics\u2014physical, personality, and\nsocial \u2013 some interesting cultural differences in the relative\nimportance of these categories have been shown in people\u2019s\nresponses to the TST. For example, Ip and Bond (1995) found\nthat the responses from Asian participants included\nsignificantly more references to themselves as occupants of\nsocial roles (e.g., \u201cI am Joyce\u2019s friend\u201d) or social groups (e.g., \u201cI\nam a member of the Cheng family\u201d) than those of American\nparticipants. Similarly, Markus and Kitayama (1991) reported\nthat Asian participants were more than twice as likely to\ninclude references about other people in their self-concept as\ndid their Western counterparts. This greater emphasis on\neither external or social aspects of the self-concept reflects the\nrelative importance that collectivistic and individualistic\ncultures place on an interdependence versus independence\n(Nisbett, 2003).\nInterestingly, bicultural individuals who report acculturation\nto both collectivist and individualist cultures show shifts in their\nself-concept depending on which culture they are primed to\nthink about when completing the TST. For example, Ross, Xun,\nand Wilson (2002) found that students born in China but living\nin Canada reported more interdependent aspects of\nthemselves on the TST when asked to write their responses\nin Chinese, as opposed to English. These culturally different\nresponses to the TST are also related to a broader distinction\nin self-concept, with people from individualistic cultures often\ndescribing themselves using internal characteristics that\nemphasize their uniqueness, compared with those from\ncollectivistic backgrounds who tend to stress shared social\n264 | Self and Culture group memberships and roles. In turn, this distinction can lead\nto important differences in social behavior.\nOne simple yet powerful demonstration of cultural\ndifferences in self-concept affecting social behavior is shown in\na study that was conducted by Kim and Markus (1999). In this\nstudy, participants were contacted in the waiting area of the\nSan Francisco airport and asked to fill out a short questionnaire\nfor the researcher. The participants were selected according to\ntheir cultural background: about one-half of them indicated\nthey were European Americans whose parents were born in\nthe United States, and the other half indicated they were Asian\nAmericans whose parents were born in China and who spoke\nChinese at home.\nFigure 1. European Americans preferred to take a pen with the more\nunusual color, whereas the Asian American participants preferred\none with the more common color. [Image provided by Opentextbc.ca,\nhttps://opentextbc.ca/socialpsychology/chapter/\nthe-cognitive-self-the-self-concept/]\nAfter completing the questionnaires (which were not used in\nthe data analysis except to determine the cultural\nbackgrounds), participants were asked if they would like to\ntake a pen with them as a token of appreciation. The\nexperimenter extended his or her hand, which contained five\npens. The pens offered to the participants were either three or\nSelf and Culture | 265 four of one color and one or two of another color (the ink in\nthe pens was always black). As shown in Figure 1 and consistent\nwith the hypothesized preference for uniqueness in Western,\nbut not Eastern cultures, the European Americans preferred\nto take a pen with the more unusual color, whereas the Asian\nAmerican participants preferred one with the more common\ncolor.\nThrough these and other experiments two dimensions of\nself-concept emerged, the independent construal (concept)\nand the interdependent concept. Western, or more\nindividualist cultures, view the self as separate and focus on\nself, independence, autonomy and self-expression are\nreinforced through social and cultural norms. This is the\nindependent self-concept. Non-western or collectivistic\ncultures view the self as interdependent and inseparable from\nsocial context and individuals socialized to value\ninterconnectedness consider the thoughts and behaviors of\nothers. Fitting in is valued over standing out.\nResults from the TST studies described earlier provide\nadditional support for the role of culture in shaping self-\nconcept. Different demands that cultures place on individual\n266 | Self and Culture members means that individuals integrate, synthesize, and\ncoordinate worlds differently, producing differences in self-\nconcept. Variations in self-concepts occur because different\ncultures have different rules of living and exist within different\nenvironments (natural habitat).\nIntra-cultural Differences in Self-Concept\nCultural differences in self-concept have even been found in\npeople\u2019s self-descriptions on social networking sites. DeAndrea,\nShaw, and Levine (2010) examined individuals\u2019 free-text self-\ndescriptions in the About Me section in their Facebook profiles.\nConsistent with the researchers\u2019 hypothesis, and with previous\nresearch using the TST, African American participants had the\nmost the most independently (internally) described self-\nconcepts, and Asian Americans had the most interdependent\n(external) self-descriptions, with European Americans in the\nmiddle.\nSelf and Culture | 267 Social Media self-descriptions provide insight into interdependent\nand independent concepts of self and the role of culture. [Image By\nFreeGraphicToday Social Media 3D CC0 https://pixabay.com/en/\nsocial-media-3d-render-bubble-2636256/]\nAs well as indications of cultural diversity in the content of the\nself-concept, there is also evidence of parallel gender diversity\nbetween males and females from various cultures, with\nfemales, on average, giving more external and social responses\nto the TST than males (Kashima et al., 1995). Interestingly, these\ngender differences have been found to be more apparent in\nindividualistic nations than in collectivistic nations (Watkins et\nal., 1998).\n268 | Self and Culture Neural Basis for Self\nThere is neuro-cultural evidence supporting the two\ndefinitions of self-construals first proposed by Markus and\nKitayama (e.g., independent and interdependent, 1991). Neuro-\ncultural research of self uses neuroscience and imaging\ntechniques to describe and understand the biological\nprocesses that underlie our understanding of self (Chiao,\nHarada, Komeda, Li, Mano, Saito\u2026.2009; Zhu, Zhang, Fan, &\nHana, 2007). One of the more common methods of\ndetermining brain areas that pertain to different cognitive\nprocesses is by using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) which measures blood flow in the brain. Areas with\nhigher blood flow on fMRI scans are said to be activated. Chiao,\net al., (2009) using fMRI results identified individualistic and\ncollectivistic views of self in samples of Japanese and American\nstudents.\nNeural Basis for Self | 269 Neurons that fire together wire together which helps explain\ncultures role in shaping the brain. [Image found Human Brain\nMapping]\nChiao and colleagues (2009) found that participants who\nviewed themselves collectivistically showed greater fMRI\nactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) than those\nwho viewed themselves individualistically. The reverse is true\nwhen people describe themselves individualistically but these\nresults were not clearly associated with specific cultures (e.g.,\nJapan and United States). As described by the researchers,\n\u201ccultural values and not necessarily their cultural affiliation\u201d\nmodulated the neural responses in their brains.\n270 | Neural Basis for Self Beyond East and West\nDifferences\nThe work by Markus and Kitayama (1991) has had a major effect\non social, personality and developmental psychology and\nraised awareness for cultural considerations in psychology.\nDespite the positive impact, there has been limited empirical\nsupport for independent and interdependent self-construals\n(Matsumoto, 1999) with some studies reporting contradictory\nfindings. Recent research conducted by 71 researchers, across\n33 countries and encompassing 55 cultural groups challenged\nthe dichotomous view first proposed by Markus and Kitayama.\nThe researchers conducted a series of studies (Vignoles\u2026. 2016)\nthat examined a single dimension of Independent/\nInterdependent, Western cultures as wholly independent, the\nrelationship between individualist and collectivist cultures and\nIndependent/Interdependent self-construals, as well as the role\nof religious heritage and socioeconomic development of\ncultures. Using data from over 7,000 adults, the authors\nidentified seven dimensions that encompass both\nindependent and interdependent self-construals:\n\u2022 Difference\n\u2022 Connection\n\u2022 Self-Direction\n\u2022 Self-Reliance\n\u2022 Consistency\n\u2022 Self-Expression\n\u2022 Self-Interest\nAt the level of the individual these seven dimensions represent\nthe different ways that we see ourselves and our relationships\nBeyond East and West\nDifferences | 271 with other people. The dimensions can also represent cultural\nnorms about self that are reinforced and maintained by\ncultural practices and social structures.\nWhen the researchers tested the 7-dimension model, their\nresults contradicted many long-held beliefs about\nindependent, individualistic, interdependent and collectivist\ncultures. First, Western cultures scored above average on five\nof the dimensions but were below average on the dimensions\nself-reliance and consistency. Thus, the common view that\nWestern cultures are wholly independent was not supported.\nLatin American cultures had scores very similar to Western\ncultures on the difference and self-expression dimensions but\nscored higher on consistency and self-interest which also\nchallenged the common view of Latin America as wholly\ninterdependent. The economically poorest samples in the\nstudy scored highest on self-interest and were negatively\nassociated with individualism, whereas Western cultures\nscored high on commitment to others which challenges the\nview that rich Western cultures are selfish.\nReligious heritage was also an important variable in the\n272 | Beyond East and West Differences study. Muslim and Catholic samples had very distinct\ndimension profiles that showed high scores for consistency.\nThis may be related to the tenets of both faiths that salvation is\nrelated to behaviors so behaving consistently \u2013 across different\nsituations and settings would be important.\nThe results of Vignoles and colleagues demonstrated that\nself, whether measured at the individual level or cultural level,\nis not binary. Independence and interdependence is a complex\ninteraction of heritage, socioeconomic development,\nsettlement patterns, and ecological contexts. By moving away\nfrom a dichotomous view of self, psychologists have an\nopportunity to expand our understanding of self and its\nrelationship to culture.\nBeyond East and West Differences | 273 Self-Enhancement and\nSelf-Effacement\nRelated to self-concept is self-enhancement, the processes\nthat we use to bolster self-esteem. Early research linked\nenhancement with individualistic cultures (Kitayama et al.,\n1999; Heine et al., 1999) however evidence for the culturally\nspecific model has been mixed. The more commonly accepted\nview, pancultural perspective, argues that all cultures engage\nin enhancement but how, when and to what extent differs by\nculture (Brown, 2010; Becker et al., 2014; Sedikides et al., 2015).\nCai and colleagues (2016) explored a pancultural theory of self-\nenhancement in Western (US) and Eastern (China) samples.\nResults revealed that participants endorsed more positive traits\nwhen describing themselves and also endorsed more negative\ntraits as non-self-descriptive. The degree of this effect was\nhigher in the Western than Eastern sample confirming that\nself-enhancement is positive in both cultures but it is higher\namong the Western sample.\nImagine you are the lead on a major work project\nand have been asked to provide a status update on\nthe project to the executive board. You and your\nteam spend hours preparing the presentation. At\nthe end of the presentation, one of the board\nmembers congratulates you on the project and the\npresentation. In reply you say, \u201cI am dedicated to\nthis project and work really hard to meet the\n274 | Self-Enhancement and\nSelf-Effacement expectations.\u201d This could be considered an example\nof self-enhancement because you emphasize your\ndedication and role to the project.\nSelf-effacement is the tendency to downplay one\u2019s virtues or\ncharacteristic. In general Asians tend to be more self-effacing\n(although most studies only use samples from Japan and\nChina) (Kurman, 2003). Under normal conditions, self-\neffacement is a facet of modesty and is not a lack of confidence\nor of self-esteem. Self-effacement reflects cultural norms and in\nsome collectivist cultures, such as in China and Japan, consider\nmodesty a virtue. Self-effacing tactics are used to reduce the\nsocial risk of offending others so in this way self-effacement is\nnot linked to self-esteem.\nLet\u2019s consider our earlier scenario and the congratulations\noffered by a board member. If this time you say, \u201cIt had nothing\nto do with me, it is my team.\u201d This could be considered an\nexample of self-effacement because you understate your role\nand emphasize the team members.\nMost of the research in this area has focused on cross-cultural\nresearch between Western and Eastern cultures. Suzuki and\ncolleagues (2008) examined the role of self-enhancement and\nself-effacement and reactions to criticism among multicultural,\nfemale youth in the United States. Results revealed that\nEuropean American and African American youth had more\nself-enhancing reactions to praise. Asian American and\nHispanic youth were less self-enhancing and more self-effacing\nthan the other two groups. The differences in reactions to\npraise were explained by differences in generational histories\nin the United States and cultural exposure. The youth with the\nSelf-Enhancement and Self-Effacement | 275 highest self-enhancing reactions (European Americans and\nAfrican Americans) were all born in the United States with\ngreater exposure to individualist norms.\nMost people think that they are above average when rating\nthemselves. [Image By johnhain https://pixabay.com/\np-656439/?no_redirect]\nAsian American and Hispanic study participants reported that\nat least one person in their household were born abroad in less\nindividualist and more collectivist cultures. These differences\nexplain why the Asian American and Hispanic youths might\nhave had more self-effacing reactions.\nBetter than average effect (BTAE; Wylie, 1979) is considered\na form of bias or inaccuracy in self-assessment because while\nmost people are average, only a minority of people recognize\nthis reality. Research using the direct method asks participants\n276 | Self-Enhancement and Self-Effacement to evaluate themselves in comparison to an average person\non a single test (scale). Using the indirect method participates\nrate themselves and the average person on separate scales and\naverage evaluation is subtracted from the ratings. Research on\nthe BTAE that in the United States adults typically consider\nthemselves to be more intelligent and more attractive than\naverage and this effect was stronger for male than females.\nEarly studies found that BTAE was associated with\nindividualistic and not collectivist cultures; one researcher even\nasserted that it was not found in Japan but this research was\nnot conclusive. It is possible that BTAE is correlated with age.\nZell (2016) found that older adults rated themselves worse than\naverage on some age-related measures. One study that\nexamined prisoners and BTAE found that a significant number\nconsidered themselves to be more prosocial than other\nprisoners (Sedikides, Meek, Alicke & Taylor, 2013).\nSelf-Enhancement and Self-Effacement | 277 Chapter Review\nPersonality traits are not just a useful way to describe people;\nthey actually help psychologists predict if someone is going\nto be a good worker, how long he or she will live, and the\ntypes of jobs and activities the person will enjoy. The culture in\nwhich you live is one of the most important factors that shapes\nyour personality and Western ideas about personality may not\nbe applicable to other cultures. In fact, there is evidence that\nthe strength of personality traits varies across cultures. It may\nbe most productive to think of the Five Factor Model as a\nframework for beginning to explore systematically individual\ndifferences in behavior within a particular culture.\nIdentity and self are linked concepts that encompasses what\nwe think and feel about ourselves, as well as our relationships\nwith others. Neuro-cultural research confirms self as a universal\nbut culture contexts define the conditions that self will be\nexpressed. For example, certain values are emphasized or\nsanctioned within culture (e.g., modesty, independence,\ncooperation, empathy). Independent and interdependent self-\nconcepts coexist simultaneously within individuals and culture\nprovides the framework for self-expression.\nVocabulary\nBetter than average effect (BTAE] is considered a form of bias\nor inaccuracy in self-assessment because while most people\nare average, only a minority of people recognize this reality\nCharacteristic refers qualities of culture and what is\nconsidered good and bad within a specific culture.\nCultural identity (sometimes called collective identity) is\n278 | Chapter Review similar to social identity and refers to our group members and\nthe recognition that we are members of a group.\nIdentity is a psychological term used to explain the way\nindividuals understand themselves as part of a social group\nand are recognized by others as members of the social group\nIndependent self refers to a sense of self that views the self\nas a bounded entity (separate) from others that are seen as\nimportant\nInterdependent self refers to a sense of self that views the\nself as integrate, flexible and depends on the context or the\nsituation; fundamental connectedness to others\nPersonal identity is the way that we understand ourselves\n(e.g., personality, traits, and preferences) and is closely related\nto our concept of self.\nPersonality is one of the things that make us unique from\none another and are long term, stable, and not easily changed.\nConsidered heritable and biological.\nPersonality traits reflect patterns of thoughts, feelings, and\nbehaviors that are relatively consistency and stable but are\ninfluenced by situational determinants\nSocial identity reflects our understanding that we are\nmembers of groups.\nSelf is a psychological construct that unconsciously and\nautomatically influences our thoughts, actions, and feelings.\nSelf-concept refers to cognitive representations of one\u2019s own\nself or images one has about oneself; our sense of self is linked\nto how we see the world around us and is also linked to how we\nsee our relationships.\nSelf-effacement is the tendency to downplay one\u2019s virtues or\ncharacteristics\nSelf-enhancement is the name given to psychological\nprocesses that we use to bolster self-esteem\nTemperament is a hereditary aspect of personality, including\nsensitivity, moods, irritability, and distractibility.

The busy life of a college student doesn\u2019t\nalways allow you to maintain and balance all three areas of your\nlife, especially around midterm and finals. Researchers found\nthat students taking exams were more stressed, smoked more,\ndrank more caffeine, had less physical activity, and had worse\nsleep habits (Oaten & Chang, 2005), all of which could have\nCulture and Physical Health | 281 detrimental effects on their health. Positive health practices\nare especially important during times of stress, but how have\nhabits you have been enculturated into shaped those\npractices? What are the similarities and differences in staying\nhealthy as a college student in the United States compared to\nother countries?\nGlobally, human beings are living longer than ever but living\na longer life does not necessarily mean we are living healthier.\nResearchers in the field of health want to improve our\nunderstanding of how social and technological advances in\nmedicine and lifestyle are being undermined by increasing\nrates of obesity, unhealthy behaviors and widening gaps in\naccess to health care. For centuries of human history, life\nexpectancy has slowly and steadily risen for each generation;\nhowever, current unhealthy habits (smoking, substance abuse,\nobesity) may potentially threaten this trend. The New England\nJournal of Medicine reported that the average youth of today\nmay live less healthy, and even shorter, lives than their parents\n(Olshansky, et. al., 2005). If that is the case, today\u2019s youth would\nbe the first generation in modern, recorded history to NOT\nautomatically be expected to outlive the generation that raised\nthem.\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1.

Describe the (WHO) Sustainable Development Goals.\nCulture and Physical Health | 283  What Does it Mean to\nbe Healthy?\nThe meaning of health has evolved over time but early\ndefinitions of health focused on the theme of the body\u2019s ability\nto function. Originally health was seen as a state of normal\nfunction that could be disrupted from time to time by disease.\nDisease is a broad reference to any condition that impairs\nnormal functioning of the body. Most Western countries focus\non the physical processes \u2013 pathology, biochemistry and\nphysiology of a disease \u2013 as primary contributors to health.\nThis is known as the biomedical model. According to the\nbiomedical model, health means freedom from disease, pain,\nor defect but not does consider the role of social factors or\nindividual subjectivity. There is a contrasting model of health\nthat takes a more holistic approach, often referred to as\ntraditional medicine.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional\nmedicine as \u201cthe sum total of the knowledge, skills, and\npractices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences\nindigenous to different cultures\u201d (WHO, 2019). In 1977, American\npsychiatrist George Engel developed an interdisciplinary\nmodel that looked at the interconnection between biology,\npsychology, and socio-environmental factors. With his\nbiopsychosocial approach, Engel strived for a more holistic\napproach to health by recognizing that each patient has his or\nher own thoughts, feelings, and history.\nEngel\u2019s biopsychosocial model views the development of\nillness through the complex interaction of biological factors\n(genetic, biochemical), psychological factors (mood,\npersonality, behavior) and social factors (cultural, familial,\nsocioeconomic, medical). For example, a person may have a\nWhat Does it Mean to be\nHealthy? | 285 genetic predisposition for depression, but he or she may have\nsocial factors such as extreme stress at work and family life, and\npsychological factors such as a perfectionistic tendency, which\nwhen combined can trigger this genetic code for depression.\n286 | What Does it Mean to be Healthy? Global Definition of\nHealth\nHealth, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO),\nis a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being\nand not merely the absence of disease or infirmity (WHO, 2019).\nThis definition has been subject to controversy, as it may have\nlimited value for implementation. Generally, the context in\nwhich we live our lives is critical for our health and quality of\nlife. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and\nimproved not only through the advancement and application\nof health science, but also through intelligent lifestyle choices\nand efforts of the individual, as well as larger society.\nAccording to the World Health Organization the main\ndeterminants of health include:\n\u2022 Social environment\n\u2022 Economic environment\n\u2022 Physical environment\n\u2022 Individual characteristics and behavior\n\u2022 Global Indicators of Health\nHealth indicators are quantifiable characteristics of a\npopulation which researchers use for describing the health of a\npopulation. Adopting a standard system with reliable measures\nfor defining health is important for global monitoring of\nchanges in health (see Chapter 3 for more about reliability).\nResearchers using data collected from around the world look\nfor patterns in identifying, preventing, and treating disease.\nThere are three common global health indicators identified\nby The World Health Organization (WHO) that directly and\nindirectly measure and monitor global health:\nGlobal Definition of Health | 287 1. Life expectancy\n2. Infant mortality\n3. Subjective well-being\nThese three indicators serve as standard measures to assist\nhealth professionals working in both developed and\ndeveloping countries. Each indicator is discussed in greater\ndetail.\n288 | Global Definition of Health Life Expectancy\nLife expectancy (LE) is a statistical measure of the average\ntime an organism (in our case human) is expected to live, based\non the year of its birth, its current age and other demographic\nfactors including gender. There are great variations in life\nexpectancy between different parts of the world, mostly\ncaused by differences in public health, medical care, and diet.\nComparing life expectancies from birth across countries can be\nproblematic. There are differing definitions of live birth versus\nstillbirth even among more developed countries, and less\ndeveloped countries often have poor reporting.\nWorldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 71.5\nyears, 68.4 years for males and 72.8 years for females over the\nperiod 2010\u20132015 according to United Nations World\nPopulation Prospects (UN Population Prospects, Revised 2015).\nIn the United States, African-American people have shorter\nlife expectancies than their European-American counterparts.\nFor example, white Americans born in 2010 are expected to\nlive until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. In\ncontrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic\ngroups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.\nThe life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years (Center\nfor Disease Control, CDC, 2019).\nOverall, the United States ranks 49 globally in LE. The highest\nlife expectancy is found in Monaco (Europe) and the lowest\nlife expectancy is found in Angola (Africa) (\u201cLife Expectancy\u201d,\n2019). Ranking 49 in the world in life expectancy doesn\u2019t sound\nso bad when you consider over 200 countries contribute data\nbut it is problematic and concerning given the comparative\nabundance of resources of the United States. Some argue that\nthe United States, with access to health sciences, technology,\nLife Expectancy | 289 and supported innovation should be a global leader in life\nexpectancy rates with a much higher global ranking.\n290 | Life Expectancy Infant Mortality\nInfant mortality is the death of young children under the age\nof 1 and infant mortality rate (IMR) is the number of deaths\nof children under one year of age per 1000 live births. Infant\nmortality rate is used to standardize infant deaths for global\ncomparisons (WHO, 2019). Premature birth is the largest\ncontributor to the IMR. Other leading causes of infant mortality\nare birth asphyxia, pneumonia, congenital malformations,\ndiseases and malnutrition. Many factors contribute to infant\nmortality, such as the mother\u2019s level of education,\nenvironmental conditions, and political and medical\ninfrastructure. Improving sanitation, access to clean drinking\nwater, immunization against infectious diseases, and other\npublic health measures can help reduce high rates of infant\nmortality.\nThe reported IMR provides one statistic which reflects the\nstandard of living in each nation. However, the method of\ncalculating IMR often varies widely between countries, based\non how they define a live birth and how many premature\ninfants are born in the country. For these reasons, reporting\ninfant mortality rate can be inconsistent and may be\nunderstated. Of the 27 most developed countries, the United\nStates has the highest IMR, despite spending much more on\nhealth care per capita. In particular, IMR varies greatly by race\nand socio-economic status (\u201cInfant Mortality\u201d, 2019). These\nnumbers are disconcerting given the resources available and\ntechnological advances available for health care in the United\nStates. The relatively high IMR raises questions about culture\nand the impact this racial and socio-economic disparity has on\ninfant health.\nInfant Mortality | 291 Subjective Well-Being\nSubjective well-being (SWB) is the scientific term for\nhappiness and life satisfaction \u2014thinking and feeling that your\nlife is going well, rather than badly. Levels of subjective well-\nbeing are influenced by both internal factors, such as\npersonality and outlook, and external factors, such as the\nsociety in which they live. Some of the major determinants of\nSWB are a person\u2019s inborn temperament, the quality of their\nsocial relationships, the societies they live in, and their ability\nto meet their basic needs. Although there are additional forms\nof SWB, the three in the table below have been studied\nextensively. The table also shows that the causes of the\ndifferent types of happiness can be somewhat different.\nThere are different causes of happiness, and that these\ncauses are not identical for the various types of SWB and high\nSWB is achieved by combining several different important\nelements (Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2008). People who promise\nto know the key to happiness are oversimplifying.\nSome people experience all three elements of happiness and\nare very satisfied, enjoy life, and have only a few worries or other\nunpleasant emotions. Other unfortunate people are missing\nall three. For example, imagine an elderly person who is\ncompletely satisfied with her life\u2014she has done most\neverything she ever wanted\u2014but is not currently enjoying life\nthat much because of the infirmities of age. There are others\nwho show a different pattern who are having fun, but who are\ndissatisfied and believe they are wasting their lives.\nImportantly, researchers have also studied the outcomes of\nSWB and have found that people you report being happier are\nmore likely to be healthier and live longer, to have better social\nrelationships, and to be more productive at work (Diener & Tay,\n2012; Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005). In other words, people\n292 | Subjective Well-Being high in SWB seem to be healthier and function more effectively\ncompared to people who are chronically stressed, depressed,\nor angry. Happiness does not just feel good in the moment, but\nit is good for people over time and for those around them.\nMoney and Happiness\nA certain level of income is needed to meet our needs, and\nvery poor people are frequently dissatisfied with life (Diener\n& Seligman, 2004); however, having more and more money\nhas diminishing returns. This means that higher and higher\nincomes make less and less difference to happiness. Wealthy\nnations tend to have higher average life satisfaction than poor\nnations, but the United States has not experienced a rise in\nlife satisfaction over the past decades, even as income has\ndoubled. The goal is to find a level of income that you can live\nwith and earn.\nYou should not let your aspirations continue to rise so that\nyou always feel poor, no matter how much money you have.\nResearch shows that materialistic people often tend to be less\nhappy, and putting your emphasis on relationships and other\nareas of life besides just money is a wise strategy. Money can\nhelp life satisfaction, but when too many other valuable things\nare sacrificed to earn a lot of money\u2014such as relationships or\ntaking a less enjoyable job\u2014the pursuit of money can harm\nhappiness.\nSelf \u2013 Examination\nAlthough it is beneficial generally to be happy and satisfied,\nthis does not mean that people should be in a constant state\nof euphoria. In fact, it is appropriate and helpful sometimes to\nbe sad or to worry. At times a bit of worry mixed with positive\nSubjective Well-Being | 293 feelings makes people more creative. Most successful people in\nthe workplace seem to be those who are mostly positive but\nsometimes a bit negative. You do not need to be happiness\nsuperstar in order to be a superstar in life. What is not helpful\nis to be chronically unhappy. If you feel mostly positive and\nsatisfied, and yet occasionally worry and feel stressed, this is\nprobably fine as long as you feel comfortable with this level\nof happiness. If you are a person who is chronically unhappy\nmuch of the time, changes are needed, which may include\nsome professional support.\n294 | Subjective Well-Being Health in American\nCulture\nGiven that the United States spends more on health care than\nmost (if not all) industrialized nations in the world, one could\nreasonably expect the American people to be some of the\nhealthiest citizens in the world. How is it then that modern\nAmericans are significantly less healthy than other societies\nand, may even be expected to live shorter lives than previous\ngenerations? In previous chapters, westernized ideals of\ncontrol, choice, short-term time orientation, and capitalism\nwere explored as influencing how young people are\nenculturated in the United States.\nIn this chapter, aspects of western culture will be viewed\nthrough the lens of their impact on our physical health\nincluding our perceptions of health, desire to be health and\naccess to health education and resources. In this chapter we\nwill explore the impact of American culture on four aspects of\nhealth in United States society:\n\u2022 American diet\n\u2022 Sleep hygiene\n\u2022 Socio-economic status\n\u2022 Ethnic and racial disparity\nHealth in American Culture | 295 Diet\nThe history of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\nnutrition guides includes over 100 years of American nutrition\nadvice. The guides have been updated over time to adopt new\nscientific findings and new public health marketing\ntechniques. The current guidelines are the Dietary Guidelines\nfor Americans 2015 \u2013 2020. What the government promotes\nas a healthy diet has not only changed over the course of\ngenerations but is often heavily influenced be societal values at\nthat time.\nThese guidelines have been criticized over time as not\naccurately representing scientific information about optimal\nnutrition, and as being overly influenced by profit, personal\ninterest, and the agricultural industries the USDA promotes.\nThe introduction of the USDA\u2019s food guide pyramid in 1992\nattempted to express the recommended servings of each food\ngroup into the American diet.\nMyPlate is the current nutrition guide published by the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, consisting of a\ndiagram of a plate and glass divided into five food groups.\nIt replaced the USDA\u2019s MyPyramid diagram in 2011, ending 19\nyears of food pyramid iconography (USDA, 2019).\nDiet is the sum of food consumed by an organism or group,\nand should not be confused with dieting, which refers to food\nrestriction with the goal of weight control. Numerous studies\nhave attempted to identify contributing factors for poor health\nhabits in the United States that have contributed to rising rates\nof obesity and diseases related to obesity. These studies have\nresulted in numerous hypotheses as to what those key factors\nare. A common theme is that of too much food, too little\nexercise, and a sedentary schedule; however, these themes are\nincreasingly viewed as overly simplistic and lacking in\n296 | Diet awareness to the complex approaches that are needed to\nimprove healthy living for all Americans. For example, while\ndieting, people tend to consume more low-fat or fat-free\nproducts, even though those items can be just as damaging\nto the body as the items with fat. Currently, less than 20%\nof all Americans meet the recommended minimum dietary\nguidelines for optimal health (\u201cHealth Diet\u201d, n.d).\nOther factors not directly related to caloric intake and activity\nlevels are also believed to contribute to lowered physical fitness\nand higher body-mass index (BMI) rates. These include careers\nthat involve long hours of sitting, decreased ability to delay\ngratification, and heavy marketing to promote unhealthy\nfoods. Genetics are also believed to be a factor that contributes\nto higher BMI. In a 2018 study, researchers stated that the\npresence of the human gene APOA2 could result in a higher\nBMI in individuals. Also, the probability of obesity can even\nstart before birth due to things that the mother does such as\nsmoking and gaining a lot of weight.\nAmong the complex factors impacting eating habits in\nAmerican culture are two key enculturated trends:\n\u2022 Consumer culture\n\u2022 Mixed media messaging\nConsumer culture focuses on the spending of the customer\u2019s\nmoney on material goods to attain a lifestyle in a capitalist\neconomy. Over the years, people of different age groups are\nemployed by marketing companies to help understand the\nbeliefs, attitudes, values, and past behaviors of the targeted\nconsumers. As consumers grow increasingly removed from\nfood production, the role of product creation, advertising, and\npublicity become the primary vehicles for information about\nfood. With processed food as the dominant category,\nmarketers have almost infinite possibilities in developing their\nproducts for mass appeal.\nDiet | 297 Today\u2019s American citizens are inundated with marketed\nmessages that food choices should be fast, bring us pleasure,\nand meet our emotional needs over physiological needs. Of\nthe food advertised to children on television, 73% is fast or\nconvenience foods (\u201cConsumer Culture\u201d, 2019). Additionally,\nAmericans are often enculturated to pursue personal\nsatisfaction while also adhering to unrealistic standards of\nfitness and attractiveness. Our consumer culture promotes\nthese conflicting standards with mixed messaging in various\nmedia formats.\nMixed messaging can refer to any communication that is\ncontradictory, inconsistent, or unclear, especially in its motive\nor intent. Media advertisements, athletic and entertainer role-\nmodels, and character storylines are often embedded (subtly,\nor at times, overtly) with the message that Americans \u201cdeserve\u201d\nto feel good but must also look good in the process.\nWith 1 out of 3 adults and 1 out of 6 children in the United\nStates categorized as excessively overweight by the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC) it is imperative to examine the factors\naffecting this damaging trend (Obesity, 2019). We will talk in\nChapter 10 about the cultural relationship Americans have with\ndiet and appearance, which contributes to the formation of\neating disorders, further damaging overall health and well-\nbeing.\n298 | Diet Sleep Hygiene\nSleep hygiene is the recommended behavioral and\nenvironmental practice that is intended to promote better\nquality sleep. Sleep hygiene recommendations include\nestablishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps (with care),\navoiding physical or mental exercise too close to bedtime,\nlimiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before\nsleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using\nbed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol, nicotine,\ncaffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and\nhaving a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.\nOne set of recommendations relates to the timing of sleep.\nFor adults, getting less than 7\u20138 hours of sleep is associated\nwith a number of physical and mental health deficits. A top\nsleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for\nsleep. There is also focus on the importance of waking up each\naround the same time every morning and generally having a\nregular sleep schedule\nHuman sleep needs vary by age and among individuals.\nSleep is considered to be adequate when there is no daytime\nsleepiness or dysfunction. Researchers have found that\nsleeping 7\u20138 hours each night correlates with longevity and\ncardiac health in humans, though many underlying factors\nmay be involved in the causality behind this relationship.\nResearch also suggests that sleep patterns vary significantly\nacross cultures (\u201cSleep\u201d, 2019). Sleep deprivation, also known\nas insufficient sleep or sleeplessness, is the condition of not\nhaving enough sleep. According to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC), 79% of Americans are currently\ngetting less than the recommended 7-hour minimum of\nquality sleep per night. The United States experiences some of\nthe highest rates of sleep deprivation and sleep disorder rates\nSleep Hygiene | 299 in the industrialized world; it is worth examining aspects of\nAmerican culture that contribute to this trend.\nResearchers examining health trends in the United States\nhave highlighted our time-sensitive culture, emphasis on\ntechnology, and general attitudes toward sleep as contributing\nfactors to our sleep hygiene. In 2000, the average American\nworked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average\nGerman but 100 hours less than the average Czechoslovakian\n(\u201cSleep\u201d, 2019). Overall the United States labor force is one of\nthe most productive in the world, largely due to its workers\nworking more than those in any other post-industrial country\n(excluding South Korea). Americans generally hold working\nand being productive in high regard. Being busy and working\nextensively is a source of pride for many and, as they say in\nAmerica, \u201ctime is money.\u201d Additionally, while there is little\ndispute that technology has enhanced our daily lives, studies\nshow it is also negatively impacting our sleep habits. The\nincreased stimulation of our devices can make it more difficult\nto unwind at the end of the night, while the unique light put off\nby these devices also block key sleep hormones. According to\nthe National Sleep Foundation (2019), children (ages 6-17) who\nslept in the same room as an electronic device reduced the\namount of quality sleep by one-hour each night.\nOverall health is correlated with the quantity and quality of\nour sleep. Studies have shown that those who engaged in\nprotective habits (e.g., getting 7\u20138 hours of sleep regularly, not\nsmoking or drinking excessively, exercising) had fewer illnesses,\nfelt better, and were less likely to die over a 9\u201312-year follow-\nup period (Belloc & Breslow 1972; Breslow & Enstrom 1980).\nFor college students, health behaviors can even influence\nacademic performance. Poor sleep quality and quantity are\nrelated to weaker learning capacity and academic\nperformance (Curcio, Ferrara, & De Gennaro, 2006). Overall,\npeople with sleep less are more likely to be obese, report higher\nlevels of stress, and/or report symptoms of a mood disorder\n300 | Sleep Hygiene than those who obtain optimal levels of sleep each night (CDC,\n2014).\nSleep Hygiene | 301 Socioeconomic Status\n(SES)\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is an economic and social\ncombined total measure of a person\u2019s economic and social\nposition in relation to others, based on income, education, and\noccupation; however, SES is more commonly used to depict\nan economic difference in society as a whole. Socioeconomic\nstatus is typically broken into three levels (high, middle, and\nlow) to describe the three places a family or an individual may\nfall in relation to others. Recently, there has been increasing\ninterest from researchers on the subject of economic\ninequality and its relation to the health of populations.\nSocioeconomic status is an important source of health\ninequity, as there is a very robust positive correlation between\nsocioeconomic status and health. Socioeconomic status in the\nUnited States is related to health outcomes. Individuals higher\nin the social hierarchy, typically, enjoy better health than do\nthose lower in the hierarchy. Low income and education levels\nhave been shown to be strong predictors of a range of physical\nand mental health problems. These health problems may be\ndue to environmental conditions in living and workspaces,\nincreased levels of stress, lack of access to healthcare, food\nscarcity or poor nutrition. This correlation suggests that it is\nnot only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is\nhealthy, but that there is a continual gradient, from the top\nto the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, relating status to\nhealth.\nEducation in higher socioeconomic families is typically\nstressed as more important, both within the household, as well\nas the local community. In poorer areas, where food, shelter\nand safety are priority, education often takes a backseat \u2013\n302 | Socioeconomic Status (SES) becomes less of a priority. American youth are particularly at\nrisk for many health and social problems in the United States.\nOverall, lower socioeconomic status has been linked to chronic\nstress, heart disease, ulcers, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid\narthritis, certain types of cancer, and premature aging.\nSocial class in the United States is a controversial issue,\nhaving many competing definitions, models, and even\ndisagreements over its very existence. Many Americans believe\nthat in the country there are just three classes: the American\nrich; the American middle class; the American poor. Most\ndefinitions of the social classes in the United States entirely\nignore the existence of parallel Black, Hispanic and minorities\ncommunities. SES differences in health have long been\nassociated by many Americans as related to poor impulse\ncontrol, unhealthy habits, and an overall lack of motivation\n(Braveman, et al, 2010). One difficulty with this\noversimplification is that these attitudes reduce poverty (and\nrelated problems associated with lower SES) as a problem with\nthe individual rather than a reflection of complex societal\ncomponents that contribute to poor health and lower life\nexpectancy. The assumption that individual choices and\ninternal control are enough to overcome the impact of poverty\nfurther adds to the difficulty impoverished people have in\novercoming economic hardships. Educational, economic, and\nhealth care inequity within lower SES groups have each been\nshown to correlate with poor health must be addressed in\norder to create meaningful change in the health of Americans\n(Braveman, et al, 2010). Given the ranking of the United States\nacross global indicators, we might do well to address poor\nhealth of Americans as a social problem and not a personal\nproblem.\nSocioeconomic Status (SES) | 303 Race and Ethnicity\nThe United States is a racially diverse country. Race and\nethnicity in the United States is a complex topic both because\nthe United States has a racially and ethnically diverse\npopulation and because of a history of racism involving slavery\nand segregation that persists to present day. At the federal\nlevel, race and ethnicity have been categorized separately.\nRace refers to a classification of humans into groups based\non physical traits, ancestry, genetics or social relations, while\nethnicity refers to a category of people who identify with each\nother based on similarities such as common ancestry,\nlanguage, history, society, culture or nation. Race and health\nrefers to how being identified with a specific race influences\nhealth.\nRace and ethnicity often remain undifferentiated in health\nresearch. Differences in health status, health outcomes, life\nexpectancy, and many other indicators of health in different\nracial and ethnic groups are well documented. Some\nindividuals in certain racial groups receive less care, have less\naccess to resources, and live shorter lives in general.\nEpidemiological data indicates that racial groups are unequally\naffected by diseases, in terms or morbidity and mortality. These\nhealth differences between racial groups create racial health\ndisparities.\nHealth disparities are defined as preventable differences in\nthe burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to\nachieve optimal health that are experienced by socially\ndisadvantaged populations. Health disparities are intrinsically\nrelated to the historical and current unequal distribution of\nsocial, political, economic and environmental resources\n(\u201cHealth Equity\u201d, 2019). The relation between race and health\nhas been studied from a multidisciplinary perspective, paying\n304 | Race and Ethnicity attention to how racism influences health disparities and how\nenvironmental factors and physiological factors respond to\neach other and to genetics.\nCurrent evidence supports the notion that these racially\ncentered disparities continue to exist and are a significant\nsocial health issue. A current report from the Centers for\nDisease Control (CDC, 2019) found that 700 women died from\npreventable complications of pregnancy in the United States, a\nrate higher than any other developed country, but the rate of\ndeath was higher for Black and Native American women. The\ndeath rate for Black mothers was over 3 times higher than for\nwhite mothers and the rate for Native American mothers was\nover 2 times higher than for white mothers. A majority of these\ndeaths are largely preventable and some relate to implicit racial\nbias that is unrelated to social status, income or education.\nMinority populations have increased exposure to\nenvironmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood\nresources, structural and community factors as well as\nresidential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and\nstress (Gee, 2004). Racial segregation is another environmental\nfactor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those\norganizations and working individuals within the real estate\nindustry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even\nthough residential segregation is noted in all minority groups,\nblacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when\ncompared to Latinos and Asians. Thus, segregation results in\nminorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited\nemployment, medical care, and educational resources, which\nis associated with high rates of criminal behavior (Williams,\n2005). In addition, segregation affects the health of individual\nresidents because the environment is not conducive to\nphysical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack\nrecreational facilities and have nonexistent recreational space.\nRacial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element\nto the environment that individuals have to interact with daily.\nRace and Ethnicity | 305 Individuals that report discrimination have been shown to have\nan increased risk of hypertension in addition to other\nphysiological stress-related affects (Mujahid, 2011). The high\nmagnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic\nstressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and\nphysical being, which leads to poor health and disease (Gee,\n2004).\n306 | Race and Ethnicity Global Health\nCross-Cultural\nComparisons\nMany of the factors explored in American health also relate to\nglobal health such as:\n\u2022 Access to health education and care\n\u2022 Socioeconomic and racial disparities\n\u2022 Food or housing scarcity\nHealth disparities are also due in part to cultural factors that\ninvolve practices based not only on sex, but also gender status.\nFor example, in China, health disparities have distinguished\nmedical treatment for men and women due to the cultural\nphenomenon of preference for male children. Additionally, a\ngirl\u2019s chances of survival are impacted by the presence of a\nmale sibling. Girls do have the same chance of survival as boys\nif they are the oldest girl \u2013 they have a higher probability of\nbeing aborted or dying young if they have an older sister.\nIn India, SES and gender-based health inequities are\napparent in early childhood. Many families provide better\nnutrition for boys in the interest of maximizing future\nproductivity given that boys are generally seen as\nbreadwinners. In addition, boys receive better care than girls\nand are hospitalized at a greater rate. The magnitude of these\ndisparities increases with the severity of poverty in a given\npopulation.\nAdditionally, the cultural practice of female genital\nmutilation (FGM) is known to impact women\u2019s health, though\nis difficult to know the worldwide extent of this practice.\nGlobal Health Cross-Cultural\nComparisons | 307 Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital\ncutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or\nremoval of some or all of the external female genitalia. While\ngenerally thought of as a Sub-Saharan African practice, it may\nhave roots in the Middle East as well. The estimated 3 million\ngirls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer\nboth immediate and lifelong negative effects. Long-term\nconsequences include urinary tract infections, bacterial\nvaginosis, pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth\nthat include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive\nbleeding (\u201cFemale Genital Mutilation\u201d, 2019).\nGlobally, the poorest countries in the world remain the least\nhealthy (CDC, 2018). In 2015, the World Health Organization\n(WHO) identified the need for multiple countries to unify in\ntargeting health disparity and basic rights/needs. The\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of 17\nglobal goals set by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly\nin 2015 for the year 2030. According to the United Nations, the\nlong-term target is to reach the communities farthest behind\nand most in need.\nThere are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has\nbetween 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward\nreaching the targets. There are many obstacles to realizing this\nglobal call to end human suffering, improve the environment,\nand ensure access to basic needs. Critics of SDG\u2019s highlight the\nhigh cost of achieving even the initial target goals and suggest\nthe plan is overly complex. Currently, world leaders continue to\nwork with the United Nations in pursuit of global peace and\nprosperity to improve human health and well-being.\n308 | Global Health Cross-Cultural Comparisons Summary\nThere is considerable cultural variation in what it means to be\nhealthy. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed\na widely adopted definition of health to include a\nbiopsychosocial approach to well-being. For many, the\nidentification of health versus illness often depends on\nsubjective labeling of how a person feels in the moment, but\nin reality, overall health is determined by a complex set of\nvariables. There is a great deal of intracultural variability in the\nUnited States when it comes to health and well-being. In\nparticular, disparity exists in groups based on socioeconomic\nstatus and race/ethnicity when it comes to access to health\nresources and care. Additionally, enculturated experiences,\nperceptions, and values further influence American health in\nregard to diet and sleep hygiene. The future of health in the\nUnited States and globally will be shaped by the ability of\nfuture generations to tackle the complex challenges faced\nwithin each culture.\nSummary | 309 Vocabulary\nBiopsychosocial model views human health as the result of\nreciprocal influences of bodily, psychological, interpersonal,\nand cultural influences over time and situations.\nDiet is the sum of food consumed by an organism or group.\nDisparity results when there is a difference, imbalance, or\ninconsistency where one should not otherwise exist.\nDrive States are affective experiences that motivate us to\nfulfill goals that benefit our survival.\nFood scarcity is the result of having limited access to\nadequate food and nutrition due to cost, proximity and/or\nother resources.\nDisease is a broad reference to any condition that impairs\nnormal functioning of the body.\nIllness refers to the individual\u2019s own experience with his/her\ndisease.\nInfant mortality is the death of young children under the age\nof 1.\nLife expectancy (LE) is a statistical measure of the average\ntime an organism is expected to live, based on the year of its\nbirth, its current age and other demographic factors including\ngender.\nSubjective well-being (SWB) is a self-reported measure of\noverall health and wellness. It encompasses general and\nsubjective areas of one\u2019s own life.\nSleep hygiene is a variety of different practices and habits\nthat are necessary to have good nighttime sleep quality and\nfull daytime alertness.\nSocial determinants are complex social structures and\neconomic systems that can drive most health inequalities such\nas access to health care or education.\nSocioeconomic status (SES) is an economic and social\n310 | Vocabulary combined total measure of a person\u2019s economic and social\nposition in relation to others, based on income, education, and\noccupation.\nVocabulary | 311  PART X\nCULTURE AND MENTAL\nHEALTH\nA wreath is laid in memoriam to victims of the Washington Navy Yard\nshooting.\nOn Monday, September 16, 2013, a gunman killed 12 people\nas the workday began at the Washington Navy Yard in\nWashington, DC. Aaron Alexis, 34, had a troubled history: he\nthought that he was being controlled by radio waves. He called\nthe police to complain about voices in his head and being\nunder surveillance by \u201cshadowy forces\u201d (Thomas, Levine, Date,\n& Cloherty, 2013). While Alexis\u2019s actions cannot be excused, it is\nclear that he had some form of mental illness. Mental illness is\nnot necessarily a cause of violence, in fact it is far more likely\nthat individuals with mental illness will be victims rather than\nperpetrators of violence (Stuart, 2003). If, however, Alexis had\nreceived the help he needed, this tragedy might have been\naverted.\nCulture and Mental Health | 313 When we hear about violent events it is common to ask\nyourself whether YOU are currently in \u201cgood\u201d health? What are\nyou thinking of to make that determination? Research shows\nthat many (if not most) Americans automatically consider\nphysical symptoms or the absence of illness to answer this\nquestion. Although many Americans acknowledge the\nimportance of stress management and mental wellness to\nbeing productive and healthy, there remains to a tendency to\nhighlight the physical in well-being and avoid acknowledging\nmental distress. In this chapter we will explore common\nconditions of mental illness and discuss the influence of culture\nin making a diagnosis and dispelling common misconceptions.\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1. Define the concept of mental illness.\n2. Distinguish between the presence of symptoms versus\nhaving a diagnosable disorder.\n3. Identify the two most widely used methods to classify\nmental illness in the world.\n4. Identify ways in which the history of classifying mental\nillness has changed over time.\n5. Define what is means for a disorder to be \u201cculture-specific,\nor culture \u2013 bound.\n6. Explain contemporary understanding of culture \u2013 bound\ndisorders.\n7. Name and describe examples of culture-bound\nsyndromes still recognized in the DSM-5.\n8. Define the concept of universal mental illnesses\n9. Distinguish between the most common categories of\nmental illness seen worldwide.\n10. Compare and contrast between symptoms for these\n314 | Culture and Mental Health disorder categories.\n11. Identify and discuss common barriers to receiving mental\nhealth treatment in the United States.\n12. Identify and discuss common barriers to receiving mental\nhealth treatment world-wide.\nCulture and Mental Health | 315  What is Mental Illness?\nA psychological disorder is a condition characterized by\nabnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychopathology\nis the study of psychological disorders, including their\nsymptoms, etiology (i.e., their causes), and treatment. The term\npsychopathology can also refer to the manifestation of a\npsychological disorder. Although consensus can be difficult,\nit is extremely important for mental health professionals to\nagree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are\ntruly abnormal in the sense that they genuinely indicate the\npresence of psychopathology. Certain patterns of behavior and\ninner experience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly\nsignify some kind of psychological disturbance. The person\nwho washes his hands 40 times per day and the person who\nclaims to hear the voices of demons exhibit behaviors and\ninner experiences that most would regard as abnormal.\nAbnormal refers to beliefs and behaviors that suggest the\nexistence of a psychological disorder.\nOn the other hand, consider the nervousness a young man\nfeels when talking to attractive women or the loneliness and\nlonging for home a freshman experiences during her first\nsemester of college\u2014these feelings may not be regularly\npresent, but they fall in the range of normal. So, what kinds\nof thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true\npsychological disorder? Psychologists work to distinguish\npsychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors\nthat are merely situational, idiosyncratic, or unconventional.\nWhat is Mental Illness? | 317 The most recent edition of the DSM [Image: Rene Walter,\nhttps://goo.gl/CcJAA1, CC BY-NC-SA 2.0, https://goo.gl/Toc0ZF] Most\nrecent edition of the ICD [Image WHO CC Public Domain]\nProgress in the treatment of mental illness necessarily implies\nimprovements in the diagnosis of mental illness. A\nstandardized diagnostic classification system with agreed-\nupon definitions of psychological disorders creates a shared\nlanguage among mental health providers and aids in clinical\nresearch. While disorders have been recognized as far back\nas the ancient Greeks, it was not until 1883 that German\npsychiatrist Emil Kr\u00e4pelin (1856\u20131926) published a\ncomprehensive system of psychological disorders that\ncentered on a pattern of symptoms (i.e., syndrome) suggestive\nof an underlying physiological cause. Other clinicians also\nsuggested classification systems that became popular but the\nneed for a single, shared system paved the way for the\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\u2019s 1952 publication of the first\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). The most recent\nversion is the DSM-5 (2013). Each revision reflects an attempt to\n318 | What is Mental Illness? help clinicians streamline diagnosis and work better with other\ndiagnostic systems such as health diagnoses outlined by the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO).\nSummary\nPsychological disorders are conditions characterized by\nabnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Although\nchallenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health\nprofessionals to agree on what kinds of inner experiences and\nbehaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder.\nInner experiences and behaviors that are atypical or violate\nsocial norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however,\neach of these criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction\ndescribes the view that psychological disorders result from the\ninability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural\nfunction. Many of the features of harmful dysfunction\nconceptualization have been incorporated in the American\nPsychological Association (APA) formal definition of\npsychological disorders. According to this definition, the\npresence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significant\ndisturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these\ndisturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction (biological,\npsychological, or developmental), must cause significant\nimpairment in one\u2019s life, and must not reflect culturally\nexpected reactions to certain life events.\nWhat is Mental Illness? | 319 Making a Diagnosis\n(The 3 D\u2019s)\nWhile the concept of mental or psychological disorders is\ndifficult to define, and no definition will ever be perfect, it is\nrecognized as an extremely important concept and therefore\npsychological disorders (aka mental disorders) have been\ndefined as a psychological dysfunction which causes distress\nor impaired functioning and deviates from typical or expected\nbehavior according to societal or cultural standards. This\ndefinition includes three components (3 Ds)\n\u2022 Dysfunction\n\u2022 Distress\n\u2022 Deviance\nDysfunction includes disturbances in a person\u2019s thinking,\nemotional regulation, or behavior that reflects significant\ndysfunction in psychological, biological, or developmental\nprocesses underlying mental functioning. In other words,\ndysfunction refers to a breakdown in cognition, emotion, and/\nor behavior. For instance, an individual experiencing the\ndelusion that he is an omnipotent deity has a breakdown in\ncognition because his thought processes are not consistent\nwith reality. An individual who is unable to experience pleasure\nhas a breakdown in emotion. Finally, an individual who is\nunable to leave her home and attend work due to fear of having\na panic attack is exhibiting a breakdown in behavior.\nDistress can take the form of psychological or physical pain,\nor both at the same time. Simply put, distress refers to\nsuffering. Alone though, distress is not sufficient enough to\ndescribe behavior as abnormal. Think about it \u2013 the loss of\n320 | Making a Diagnosis (The 3\nD\u2019s) a loved one causes even the most \u201cnormally\u201d functioning\nindividual pain and suffering. An athlete who experiences a\ncareer ending injury would display distress as well. Suffering\nis part of life and cannot be avoided. Impairment refers to\nwhen the person experiences a disabling condition that limits\nthe ability to engage in activities of daily living (e.g., can no\nlonger maintain minimum standards of hygiene, pay bills) or\nparticipate in social events (e.g., attending social events), work\nor school. Impairment can also interfere with the ability to\nperform important life roles (e.g., student, caregiver or parent).\nA closer examination of the word abnormal shows that it\nindicates a move away from what is normal, typical, or average.\nDeviance refers to behavior that violates social norms or\ncultural expectations because culture determines what is\nnormal. When a person is said to be deviant when he or she\nfails to follow the stated and unstated rules of society, called\nsocial norms. As you might expect there is a lot of cultural\nvariation in acceptable behavior.\nEarlier we learned about cultural relativism and what is\nconsidered normal by a culture can change over time due to\nshifts in accepted values and expectations. For instance, just a\nfew decades ago homosexuality was considered taboo in the\nUnited States and it was included as a mental disorder in the\nfirst edition of the DSM; but today, it is generally accepted.\nLikewise, public displays of affection do not cause a second\nlook by most people unlike the past when these outward\nexpressions of love were restricted to the privacy of one\u2019s own\nhouse or bedroom. In the United States, crying is generally\nseen as a weakness for males but if the behavior occurs in the\ncontext of a tragedy then it is appropriate and understandable.\nFinally, consider that statistically deviant behavior is not\nnecessarily negative. Cognitive genius is an example of\nbehavior that is not the norm. Abnormality alone is not an\nindication of a disorder or problem.\nThough not part of the DSM -5 conceptualization of what\nMaking a Diagnosis (The 3 D\u2019s) | 321 abnormal behavior is, many clinicians add a fourth D \u2013\ndangerousness to this list. Dangerousness refers to when\nbehavior represents a threat to the safety of the person or the\nsafety of others. Individuals expressing suicidal intent, those\nexperiencing acute paranoid ideation combined with\naggressive impulses (e.g., wanting to harm people who are\nperceived as being out to get them), and many individuals with\nantisocial personality disorder may be considered dangerous.\nMental health professionals (and many other professionals\nincluding researchers) have a duty to report to law\nenforcement when an individual expresses an intent to harm\nthemselves or others. Individuals with depression, anxiety, and\nobsessive-compulsive disorder are typically no more a threat\nto others than individuals without these disorders. It is very\nimportant to remember that having a mental disorder does\nnot automatically mean that a person is dangerous and most\ndangerous individuals are not mentally ill.\n322 | Making a Diagnosis (The 3 D\u2019s) History of Mental\nIllness\nReferences to mental illness can be found throughout history.\nThe evolution of mental illness, however, has not been linear\nor progressive but rather cyclical. Whether a behavior is\nconsidered normal or abnormal depends on the context\nsurrounding the behavior and thus changes as a function of a\nparticular time and culture. In the past, uncommon behavior\nor behavior that deviated from the sociocultural norms and\nexpectations of a specific culture and period has been used as\na way to silence or control certain individuals or groups.\nHistory of Mental Illness | 323 Engravings from 1525 showing trephination. It was believed that\ndrilling holes in the skull could cure mental disorders. [Image: Peter\nTreveris. Image provided by Noba Project]\nAs a result, a less cultural relativist view of abnormal behavior\nhas focused on whether behavior poses a threat to oneself or\nothers or causes so much distress that it interferes with one\u2019s\nresponsibilities or relationships with family and friends.\nHistorical Explanations\nThroughout history there have been three general theories of\n324 | History of Mental Illness the etiology (causes) of mental illness: supernatural,\nsomatogenic, and psychogenic.\n\u2022 Supernatural theories attribute mental illness to\npossession by evil or demonic spirits, displeasure of gods,\neclipses, planetary gravitation, curses, and sin.\n\u2022 Somatogenic theories identify disturbances in physical\nfunctioning resulting from either illness, genetic\ninheritance, or brain damage or imbalance.\n\u2022 Psychogenic theories focus on traumatic or stressful\nexperiences, maladaptive learned associations and\ncognitions, or distorted perceptions.\nEtiological theories of mental illness determine the care and\ntreatment mentally ill individuals receive. Modern treatments\nof mental illness are mostly associated with the establishment\nof hospitals and asylums, beginning in the sixteenth century, to\nhouse and confine the poor, homeless, unemployed, criminals\nand those with mental illness. While inhumane by today\u2019s\nstandards, the view of insanity at the time likened individuals\nwith mental illness to animals (i.e., animalism) who did not\nhave the capacity to reason, could not control themselves, were\ncapable of violence without provocation, did not have the same\nphysical sensitivity to pain or temperature, and could live in\nmiserable conditions without complaint.\nEtiological theories coexist today in what the psychological\ndiscipline holds as the biopsychosocial model of explaining\nhuman behavior. While individuals may be born with a genetic\npredisposition for a certain disorder, certain psychological\nstressors need to be present for the development of the\ndisorder. Sociocultural factors such as sociopolitical or\neconomic unrest, poor living conditions, trauma or problematic\ninterpersonal relationships are also viewed as contributing\nfactors. As much as we want to believe that in present day we\nare above the historical treatments now considered inhumane,\nHistory of Mental Illness | 325 or that the present is always the most enlightened time, we\nshould not forget that our thinking today continues to reflect\nthe same underlying somatogenic and psychogenic theories of\nmental illness discussed throughout this superficial and brief\nhistory of mental illness.\n326 | History of Mental Illness Culture-Bound\nDisorders\nIn medicine and medical anthropology, a culture-bound\nsyndrome, culture-specific syndrome, or folk illness is a\ncombination of psychiatric (brain) and somatic (body)\nsymptoms that are considered to be a recognizable disease\nonly within a specific society or culture. There are no objective\nbiochemical or structural alterations of body organs or\nfunctions and the disease is not recognized in other cultures.\nThe term culture-bound syndrome was included in the fourth\nversion of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nDisorders (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) which also\nincludes a list of the most common culture-bound conditions.\nWithin the ICD-10 (Chapter V) framework culture-specific\ndisorders are characterized by:\n\u2022 Categorization as a disease in the culture.\n\u2022 Widespread familiarity in the culture.\n\u2022 Complete lack of familiarity or misunderstanding of the\ncondition to people in other cultures.\n\u2022 No objectively demonstrable biochemical or tissue\nabnormalities.\n\u2022 The condition is usually recognized and treated by the folk\nmedicine of the culture.\nSome culture-specific syndromes involve somatic symptoms\n(pain or disturbed function of a body part), while others are\npurely behavioral. Some culture-bound syndromes appear\nwith similar features in several cultures, but with locally specific\ntraits. The term culture-bound syndrome is controversial since\nit reflects the different opinions of anthropologists and\nCulture-Bound Disorders | 327 psychiatrists. Some examples of culture-bound syndromes\ncurrently identified in the global community include Dhat\nsyndrome, Zar, and Susto.\n\u2022 Dhat syndrome is a condition found in the cultures of the\nIndian subcontinent in which male patients report that\nthey suffer from premature ejaculation or impotence, and\nbelieve that they are passing semen in their urine.\n\u2022 Zar is the term for a demon or spirit assumed to possess\nindividuals, mostly women, and to cause discomfort or\nillness. This condition is found in the cultures of the Horn\nof Africa and adjacent regions of the Middle East.\n\u2022 Susto is a cultural illness primarily among Latin American\ncultures. It is described as a condition of being frightened\nand \u201cchronic somatic suffering stemming from emotional\ntrauma or from witnessing traumatic experiences lived by\nothers.\u201d\nTraditional medicine in a market in Antananarivo, Madagascar.\n[Image by Marco Schmidt, CC-BY-SA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\nTraditional_medicine#/media/\nFile:Market_Pharmacy_Tana_MS5179.jpg]\n328 | Culture-Bound Disorders Changes to society in the last decade, including technological\nadvancements and increased globalization, has broadened\ncross-cultural influences and reduced cultural isolation. Recent\nchanges to DSM-5 (reduced from 25 to 9 disorders) and the\nICD-11 suggest a trend toward better understanding cultural\ninfluences rather than culturally specific disorders. Some\nresearchers (Ventriglio, Ayonrinde, and Bhugra, 2016) argue\nthat this interconnection calls into question our perception of\ntruly culturally specific conditions. Idioms and culture-specific\ndescriptions of disorders often overlap with symptoms seen\nin another culture (just called something else). Rather than\ndisorders being confined to specific cultures, the emphasis has\nchanged to better recognition of the expression of symptoms\nand sources of distress within each culture in order to improve\nhealthcare and treatment.\nCulture-Bound Disorders | 329 Universal Disorders\nI am sure you have realized that it can be difficult to get a\nprofessional consensus on the definition of a disorder and\nwhether it exists outside of a cultural context. Universal\ndisorder refers to the incidence of a particular set of symptoms\nas occurring across various cultures and circumstances and\nincludes mental illnesses. Universal disorders focus on the\ngenetic and biological factors contributing to the condition, in\naddition to cultural and contextual factors.\nWhile the debate about culturally specific versus universal\nconditions continues in regard to clinical diagnosis, most\nexperts agree that viewing illness through the lens of culture\nis imperative when addressing symptoms, societal stigma, and\ntreatment options. In this chapter, we will explore the\nsymptoms and diagnostic criteria of four mental health\ncategories seen across the globe:\n\u2022 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)\n\u2022 Anxiety Disorders\n\u2022 Eating Disorders\n\u2022 Psychosis\n330 | Universal Disorders Major Depressive\nDisorder (MDD)\nEveryone experiences brief periods of sadness, irritability, or\neuphoria. This is different than having a mood disorder, such\nas MDD or Bipolar Disorder (BD), which are characterized by\na constellation of symptoms that causes people significant\ndistress or impairs their everyday functioning.\nA major depressive episode (MDE) refers to symptoms that\nco-occur for at least two weeks and cause significant distress\nor impairment in functioning, such as interfering with work,\nschool, or relationships. Core symptoms include feeling down\nor depressed or experiencing anhedonia\u2014loss of interest or\npleasure in things that one typically enjoys. According to the\nDSM-5 (APA, 2013) the criteria for an MDE require five or more\nof the following nine symptoms, including one or both of the\nfirst two symptoms, for most of the day:\n\u2022 depressed mood\n\u2022 diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities\n\u2022 significant weight loss or gain or an increase or decrease\nin appetite\n\u2022 insomnia or hypersomnia\n\u2022 psychomotor agitation or retardation\n\u2022 fatigue or loss of energy\n\u2022 feeling worthless or excessive or inappropriate guilt\n\u2022 diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness\n\u2022 recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or a suicide\nattempt\nThese symptoms cannot be caused by physiological effects\nMajor Depressive Disorder\n(MDD) | 331 of a substance or a general medical condition (e.g.,\nhypothyroidism).\nPerinatal depression following child birth afflicts about 5% of all\nmothers. An unfortunate social stigma regarding this form of\ndepression compounds the problem for the women who suffer its\neffects. [Image: CC0 Public Domain, provided by Noba Project]\nCross-Cultural Considerations\nIn a nationally representative sample, the lifetime prevalence\nrate for MDD is 16.6% (Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Jin,\n332 | Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Merikangas, & Walters, 2005). This means that nearly one in five\nAmericans will meet the criteria for MDD during their lifetime.\nAlthough the onset of MDD can occur at any time\nthroughout the lifespan, the average age of onset is mid-20s,\nwith the age of onset decreasing with people born more\nrecently (APA, 2000). Prevalence of MDD among older adults is\nmuch lower than it is for younger cohorts (Kessler, Birnbaum,\nBromet, Hwang, Sampson, & Shahly, 2010). The duration of\nMDEs varies widely but MDD tends to be a recurrent disorder\nwith about 40%\u201350% of those who experience one MDE\nexperiencing a second MDE (Monroe & Harkness, 2011). An\nearlier age of onset predicts a worse course.\nWomen experience two to three times higher rates of MDD\nthan do men (Nolen-Hoeksema & Hilt, 2009). This gender\ndifference emerges during puberty (Conley & Rudolph, 2009).\nBefore puberty, boys exhibit similar or higher prevalence rates\nof MDD than do girls (Twenge & Nolen-Hoeksema, 2002). Major\nDepressive Disorder (MDD) is inversely correlated with\nsocioeconomic status (SES), a person\u2019s economic and social\nposition based on income, education, and occupation. Higher\nprevalence rates of MDD are associated with lower SES (Lorant,\nDeliege, Eaton, Robert, Philippot, & Ansseau, 2003), particularly\nfor adults over 65 years old (Kessler et al., 2010). Independent\nof SES, results from a nationally representative sample found\nthat European Americans had a higher prevalence rate of MDD\nthan did African Americans and Hispanic Americans, whose\nrates were similar (Breslau, Aguilar-Gaxiola, Kendler, Su,\nWilliams, & Kessler, 2006). The course of MDD for African\nAmericans is often more severe and less often treated than it is\nfor European Americans, however (Williams et al., 2007) Native\nAmericans have a higher prevalence rate than do European\nAmericans, African Americans, or Hispanic Americans (Hasin,\nGoodwin, Stinson & Grant, 2005). Depression is not limited to\nindustrialized or western cultures; it is found in all countries\nthat have been examined, although the symptom presentation\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) | 333 as well as prevalence rates vary across cultures (Chentsova-\nDutton & Tsai, 2009).\nSuicide\nSuicide is the act of intentionally causing one\u2019s own death.\nWhile not everyone who is clinically depressed has suicidal\nideation, it is important to recognize that depression, bipolar\ndisorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance\nabuse \u2014 including alcoholism and the use of benzodiazepines\n\u2014 are risk factors for suicide. Those who have previously\nattempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.\nThere are a number of treatments that may reduce the risk of\nsuicide for individuals struggling with mental illness.\nThere are many resources available for individuals who may be at risk\nfor suicide. {Image by United States: Department of Defense, Public\ndomain, via Wikimedia Commons; https://commons.wikimedia.org/\nwiki/File:Suicide_prevention-DOD.jpg]\nResources are also commonly in place at local colleges.\n334 | Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Consider searching your school website and/or talking with a\ntrusted faculty/staff member to learn more about resources\navailable to students.\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) | 335 Anxiety Disorders\nAnxiety is a natural part of life and, at normal levels, helps us to\nfunction at our best. For people with anxiety disorders, anxiety\nis overwhelming and hard to control. Anxiety disorders develop\nout of a blend of biological (genetic) and psychological factors\nthat, when combined with stress, may lead to the development\nof impairment. Primary anxiety-related diagnoses include\ngeneralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, specific phobia,\nsocial anxiety disorder (social phobia), post-traumatic stress\ndisorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Anxiety can be\ndefined as a negative mood state that is accompanied by\nbodily symptoms such as increased heart rate, muscle tension,\na sense of unease, and apprehension about the future (APA,\n2013; Barlow, 2002).\n336 | Anxiety Disorders The experience of anger and other related emotions can be an\noften-overlooked symptom in both depression and anxiety. [Image:\nPublic Domain, https://svgsilh.com/image/1337383.html]\nWhile many individuals experience some levels of worry\nthroughout the day, individuals with anxiety disorders\nexperience symptoms of a greater intensity and for longer\nperiods of times than the average person. Additionally, they are\noften unable to control their worry, tension, and/or predictive\ndread through various coping strategies, which directly\ninterferes with their ability to engage in daily social and\noccupational tasks.\nCharacteristic symptoms of anxiety:\n\u2022 Negative mood state characterized by unease, worry,\ntension, and/or dread.\n\u2022 Frequent doubts regarding self-worth and/or ability to\nAnxiety Disorders | 337 handle problems.\n\u2022 Future-based, \u201cpredicative\u201d fears for events.\n\u2022 Difficulty with cognitive rumination, racing thoughts, and\ninability to calm the mind.\n\u2022 Physiological cues (racing heart, sweat, bodily tension,\namong others) often accompanying cognitive symptoms,\nresulting in changing sleep/eating patterns.\nAnxiety disorders often occur along with other mental\ndisorders, in particular depression, which may occur in as many\nas 60% of people with anxiety disorders. The fact that there\nis considerable overlap between symptoms of anxiety and\ndepression and that the same environmental triggers can\nprovoke symptoms in either condition. These factors may help\nto explain this high rate of comorbidity.\nCross-Cultural Considerations\nAbout 12% of people are affected by an anxiety disorder in a\ngiven year, and between 5% and 30% are affected at some point\nin their life. They occur about twice as often in females as males\nand generally begin before the age of 25. The most common\nare specific phobia which affects nearly 12% and social anxiety\ndisorder which affects 10% of individuals at some point in their\nlife. Rates of anxiety appear to be higher in the United States\nand Europe than other parts of the world.\n338 | Anxiety Disorders Eating Disorders\nWhile nearly two out of three adults in the United States\nstruggle with issues related to being overweight, a smaller, but\nsignificant, portion of the population has eating disorders that\nresult in being normal weight or underweight.\nAnorexia Nervosa\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the\nmaintenance of a body weight well below average through\nstarvation and/or excessive exercise. Individuals suffering from\nanorexia nervosa often have a distorted body image. A\ndistorted body image is referred to as body dysmorphia in\nthe research literature and it means that people with anorexia\nnervosa view themselves as overweight even though they are\nnot. Anorexia nervosa is associated with a number of\nsignificant negative health outcomes including bone loss,\nheart failure, kidney failure, amenorrhea (cessation of the\nmenstrual period), reduced function of the gonads, and in\nextreme cases, death. Furthermore, there is an increased risk\nfor a number of psychological problems, which include anxiety\ndisorders, mood disorders, and substance abuse (Mayo Clinic,\n2012a).\nEstimates of the prevalence of anorexia nervosa vary from\nacross different studies but generally range from less than 1%\nto just over 4% in women. Generally, prevalence rates are\nconsiderably lower for men (Smink et al., 2012).\nEating Disorders | 339 Images of extremely thin models, sometimes accurately\ndepicted and sometimes digitally altered to make them\nlook even thinner, may contribute to eating\ndisorders.[Image by Peter Duhon: https://cnx.org/contents/\nSr8Ev5Og@9.2:7y4p-I4a@8/Hunger-and-Eating]\nBulimia Nervosa\nPeople with bulimia nervosa engage in binge eating behavior\n(consuming large amounts of food) that is followed by an\nattempt to compensate for the large amount of food\n340 | Eating Disorders consumed. Purging the food by inducing vomiting or through\nthe use of laxatives are two common compensatory behaviors.\nSome affected individuals engage in excessive amounts of\nexercise to compensate for their binges. Bulimia is associated\nwith many adverse health consequences that can include\nkidney failure, heart failure, and tooth decay. In addition, these\nindividuals often suffer from anxiety and depression, and they\nare at an increased risk for substance abuse (Mayo Clinic,\n2012b). The lifetime prevalence rate for bulimia nervosa is\nestimated at around 1% for women and less than 0.5% for men\n(Smink, van Hoeken, & Hoek, 2012).\nEating Disorders and Cross-Cultural\nConsiderations\nWhile both anorexia and bulimia nervosa occur in men and\nwomen of many different cultures, Caucasian females from\nWestern societies tend to be the most at-risk population.\nRecent research indicates that females between the ages of\n15 and 19 are most at risk, and it has long been suspected\nthat these eating disorders are culturally-bound phenomena\nthat are related to messages of a thin ideal often portrayed\nin popular media and the fashion world (Smink et al., 2012).\nWhile social factors play an important role in the development\nof eating disorders, there is also evidence that genetic factors\nmay predispose people to these disorders (Collier & Treasure,\n2004)..\nEating Disorders | 341 Psychosis\nMost of you have probably had the experience of walking down\nthe street in a city and seeing a person you thought was acting\noddly. They may have been dressed in an unusual way, perhaps\ndisheveled or wearing an unusual collection of clothes,\nmakeup, or jewelry that did not seem to fit any particular group\nor subculture. They may have been talking to themselves or\nyelling at someone you could not see. If you tried to speak to\nthem, they may have been difficult to follow or understand,\nor they may have acted paranoid or started telling a bizarre\nstory about the people who were plotting against them. If so,\nchances are that you have encountered an individual with\nschizophrenia or another type of psychotic disorder.\n342 | Psychosis A painting by Craig Finn, who suffers from schizophrenia, depicting\nhallucinations. The painting is titled \u201cArtistic view of how the world\nfeels like with schizophrenia\u201d. [Image: Craig Finn and provided by\nNoba Project]\nSchizophrenia is a devastating psychological disorder that is\ncharacterized by major disturbances in thought, perception,\nemotion, and behavior. About 1% of the population experiences\nschizophrenia in their lifetime, and usually the disorder is first\ndiagnosed during early adulthood (early to mid-20s).\nSchizophrenia and the other psychotic disorders are some of\nthe most impairing forms of psychopathology, frequently\nassociated with a profound negative effect on the individual\u2019s\neducational, occupational, and social function. Sadly, these\nPsychosis | 343 disorders often manifest right at time of the transition from\nadolescence to adulthood, just as young people should be\nevolving into independent young adults.\nThe spectrum of psychotic disorders includes schizophrenia,\nschizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, schizotypal\npersonality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic\ndisorder, as well as psychosis associated with substance use\nor medical conditions. Even when they receive the best\ntreatments available, many with schizophrenia will continue\nto experience serious social and occupational impairment\nthroughout their lives. In the United States, the cost of\nschizophrenia, including direct costs (e.g., outpatient, inpatient,\ndrugs, and long-term care) and non-health care costs (e.g., law\nenforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and\nunemployment) was estimated to be $62.7 billion in 2002.\nThe main symptoms of schizophrenia include hallucinations,\ndelusions, disorganized thinking, disorganized or abnormal\nmotor behavior, and negative symptoms (APA, 2013). A\nhallucination is a perceptual experience that occurs in the\nabsence of external stimulation. Auditory hallucinations\n(hearing voices) occur in roughly two-thirds of patients with\nschizophrenia and are by far the most common form of\nhallucination (Andreasen, 1987). The voices may be familiar or\nunfamiliar, they may have a conversation or argue, or the voices\nmay provide a running commentary on the person\u2019s behavior\n(Tsuang, Farone, & Green, 1999).\nDelusions are false beliefs that are often fixed, hard to\nchange even when the person is presented with conflicting\ninformation, and are often culturally influenced in their content\n(e.g., delusions involving Jesus in Judeo-Christian cultures,\ndelusions involving Allah in Muslim cultures). They can be\nterrifying for the person, who may remain convinced that they\nare true even when loved ones and friends present them with\nclear information that they cannot be true. There are many\ndifferent types or themes to delusions.\n344 | Psychosis Positive Symptoms\nTalking to someone with schizophrenia is sometimes difficult,\nas their speech may be difficult to follow, either because their\nanswers do not clearly flow from your questions, or because\none sentence does not logically follow from another. This is\nreferred to as disorganized speech, and it can be present even\nwhen the person is writing. Disorganized behavior can include\nodd dress, odd makeup (e.g., lipstick outlining a mouth for 1\ninch), or unusual rituals (e.g., repetitive hand gestures).\nNegative Symptoms\nSome of the most debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia are\ndifficult for others to see. These include what people refer to\nas negative symptoms or the absence of certain things we\ntypically expect most people to have. For example, anhedonia\nor amotivation reflect a lack of apparent interest in or drive\nto engage in social or recreational activities. These symptoms\ncan manifest as a great amount of time spent in physical\nimmobility. Importantly, anhedonia and amotivation do not\nseem to reflect a lack of enjoyment in pleasurable activities\nor events (Cohen & Minor, 2010; Kring & Moran, 2008; Llerena,\nStrauss, & Cohen, 2012) but rather a reduced drive or ability\nto take the steps necessary to obtain the potentially positive\noutcomes (Barch & Dowd, 2010). Flat affect and reduced\nspeech (alogia) reflect a lack of showing emotions through\nfacial expressions, gestures, and speech intonation, as well as\na reduced amount of speech and increased pause frequency\nand duration.\nPsychosis | 345 Cross-Cultural Considerations\nIt is clear that there are important genetic contributions to\nthe likelihood that someone will develop schizophrenia, with\nconsistent evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies.\n(Sullivan, Kendler, & Neale, 2003) but there is no such thing as\nthe schizophrenia gene. It is more likely that the genetic risk for\nschizophrenia reflects the summation of many different genes\nthat each contribute something to the likelihood of developing\npsychosis (Gottesman & Shields, 1967; Owen, Craddock, &\nO\u2019Donovan, 2010). Further, schizophrenia is a very\nheterogeneous disorder, which means that two different\npeople with schizophrenia may each have very different\nsymptoms (e.g., one has hallucinations and delusions, the other\nhas disorganized speech and negative symptoms).\nAbout 0.3% to 0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia\nduring their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6\nmillion cases globally. Males are more often affected, and on\naverage experience more severe symptoms. About 20% of\npeople eventually do well and a few recover completely, while\nabout 50% have lifelong impairment. Social problems, such as\nlong-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness, are\ncommon. The average life expectancy of people with the\ndisorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general\npopulation. This is the result of increased physical health\nproblems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an\nestimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related\nto, or caused by, schizophrenia. There is also a higher than\naverage suicide rate associated with schizophrenia.\nThe term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from\n\u201cmind-split disease\u201d to \u201cintegration disorder,\u201d to reduce stigma.\nThe new name was inspired by the biopsychosocial model and\nas a result the percentage of people who were informed of\nthe diagnosis increased from 37 to 70% over three years.

In the United States, 46% qualify for a mental\nillness within their lifetime, with less than 1 out of 5 receiving\na diagnosis. An ongoing survey indicates that anxiety disorders\nare the most common in all but one country, followed by mood\ndisorders in all but two countries, while substance disorders\nand impulse-control disorders were consistently less prevalent.\nEstimates suggest that less than half of people with mental\nillnesses in industrialized societies will receive treatment.\nThe World Health\nOrganization (WHO,\nMental Illness and\n2004) stated that\nthe Cost to Society\n\u201cPrevention of these\ndisorders is obviously\nThis leads us to consider the one of the most\ncost of mental illness to effective ways to\nsociety.

Although\nchallenging, it is essential for psychologists and mental health\nprofessionals to agree on what kinds of inner experiences and\nbehaviors constitute the presence of a psychological disorder.\nInner experiences and behaviors that are atypical or violate\nsocial norms could signify the presence of a disorder; however,\neach of these criteria alone is inadequate. Harmful dysfunction\ndescribes the view that psychological disorders result from the\ninability of an internal mechanism to perform its natural\nfunction. Many of the features of harmful dysfunction\nconceptualization have been incorporated in the American\nPsychological Association (APA) formal definition of\npsychological disorders. According to this definition, the\npresence of a psychological disorder is signaled by significant\ndisturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors; these\ndisturbances must reflect some kind of dysfunction (biological,\npsychological, or developmental), must cause significant\nimpairment in one\u2019s life, and must not reflect culturally\nexpected reactions to certain life events.\nVocabulary\nBiopsychosocial Model is a perspective that attributes\ndisturbance(s) to the complex interaction of bodily,\npsychological, and sociocultural factors\nCultural relativism is the idea that cultural norms and values\nof a society can only be understood on their own terms or in\ntheir own context.\nMaladaptive is a term referring to behaviors that cause\n354 | Chapter Review people who have them physical or emotional harm, prevent\nthem from functioning in daily life, and/or indicate that they\nhave lost touch with reality and/or cannot control their\nthoughts and behavior (also called dysfunctional).\nMental Illness is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes\nsignificant distress or impairment of personal functioning.\nPsychogenic refers to a disorder effect that originates from\nthe brain instead of other physical organs (i.e. the cause is\npsychological rather than physiological).\nSomatogenic refers to a disorder developing from physical/\nbodily origins\nStigma happens when a personal with mental illness is\nviewed in a negative way because of their symptoms or\nbehaviors associated with the condition\nUniversal disorder refers to the incidence of a particular set\nof symptoms that occur across various cultures and\ncircumstances.\nChapter Review | 355  PART XI\nCULTURE AND SOCIAL\nBEHAVIOR\nHumans have a desire to make friends, start families and spend time\ntogether.

By\njoining a group we satisfy our need to belong, gain information\nthrough social comparison, define our sense of self, and\nachieve goals that we couldn\u2019t if we worked alone.

Some\nresearchers believe that groups may be humans\u2019 most useful\ninnovation that facilitated social norms and language\ndevelopment (Boyd & Richerson, 2005; Henrich, 2016; Aiello &\nDunbar, 1993). Groups provide us with the means to reach goals\nthat we otherwise wouldn\u2019t if we remained alone. The\nadvantages of group life may be so great that humans are\nbiologically prepared to seek membership and avoid isolation.\nNeed to Belong\nHumans have a powerful need to belong. Baumeister and\nLeary (1995) describe this need as \u201ca pervasive drive to form and\nmaintain at least a minimum quantity of lasting, positive, and\nimpactful interpersonal relationships (p. 497)\u201d and most of us\nsatisfy this need by joining groups. It doesn\u2019t matter if a person\nis from Israel, Mexico, or the Philippines, we all have a strong\nneed to make friends, start families, and spend time together.\nAcross individuals, societies, and generations, we consistently\nseek inclusion over exclusion, membership over isolation, and\nacceptance over rejection. People who are accepted members\nof a group tend to feel happier and more satisfied.\nWhen people are deliberate excluded from groups the\nexperience is highly stressful leading to depression, confused\nGroup Interactions | 359 thinking, and even aggression (Williams, 2007). When\nresearchers used an fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance\nImaging) scanner to track neural responses to exclusion, they\nfound that people who were left out of a group activity\ndisplayed heightened cortical activity in two specific areas of\nthe brain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the anterior\ninsula. These areas were associated with the experience of\nphysical pain sensations (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams,\n2003). It hurts literally, to be left out of a group.\nIdentity and Membership\nGroups not only satisfy the need to belong, they also provide\nmembers with a sense of identity, the universal construct that\nis shaped by our view of ourselves and how we are recognized\nby others (Chapter 8). Demographic qualities such as sex or\nage can influence us if we categorize ourselves based on these\nqualities. Social identity theory asserts that we categorize\nourselves and form a social identity based on the degree to\nwhich we identify as a member of a particular social group\n(e.g., man, woman, Anglo, elderly, or college student) (Tajfel\n& Turner, 1979/1986). We don\u2019t just classify ourselves, we also\ncategorize other people into social categories. Social identity\ntheory explains our tendency to favor an in-group (people we\nperceive to be like us) over an out\u2013group (people we perceive\nto be different from us).\nWhen we strongly identify with an in-group, our own well-\nbeing becomes bound to the welfare of that group which\nincreases our willingness to make personal sacrifices for its\nbenefit. We see this with sports fans who heavily identify with\na favorite team. These fans become elated when the team wins\nand sad when the team loses. Heavily committed fans often\nmake personal sacrifices to support their team, such as braving\n360 | Group Interactions terrible weather, paying high prices for tickets, and standing\nand chanting during games.\nWhen we strongly identify with our favorite sports team we are\nwilling to make personal sacrifices and experience strong emotions\nrelated to wins and losses. [Image by KeithJJ on Pixabay, CC0, via\nWikimedia Commons]\nPeople also take credit for the successes of other in-group\nmembers, remember more positive than negative information\nabout in-groups, are more critical of the performance of out-\ngroup than of in-group members, and believe that their own\ngroups are less prejudiced than are out-groups (Shelton &\nRicheson, 2005). Attitudes and beliefs about out-groups are\noften associated with infrahumanization which is the\ntendency to see out-groups as less human, or as having less\nhumanity than in-groups (Vaes, Paladino, Castelli, Leyens, &\nGiovanazzi, 2004). We have seen this in history as a justification\nfor genocide or ethnic cleansing (Castano & Giner-Sorolla,\n2006). Though a strong group identity can bind individuals\nGroup Interactions | 361 together, it can also drive divisions between different groups,\nreducing overall trust and cooperation on a larger scale. People\nare generally less likely to cooperate with members of an out-\ngroup (Allport, 1954; Van Vugt, Biel, Snyder, & Tyler, 2000).\n362 | Group Interactions Group Interactions and\nCulture\nTriandis and colleagues (1988) found that in/out-group\nrelationships were highly correlated with individualistic and\ncollectivistic values of cultures. Members of individualistic\ncultures belong to multiple in-groups and move easily from\nin-group to in-group. People from individualistic cultures were\nnot attached to any one single in-group because they belong\nto many different groups. Additionally, members were more\nlikely to treat out-group persons more equally, with less\ndistinction between in-groups and out-group. Individuals from\ncollectivistic cultures tended to belong to fewer in-groups than\nindividualistic cultures but had much greater commitment to\nthe groups they belong to.\nConsider, if a group leader (e.g., politician, chief, religious\nfigure) has to decide between providing financial support for\none program or another. She may be more likely to give\nresources to the group that more closely represents her own in-\ngroup. This psychological process, of being more comfortable\nwith people like yourself, can have important and lasting\nconsequences for the out-group members. In-group favoritism\n(preferences for the in-group) is found for many different types\nof social groups, in many different settings, on many different\ndimensions, and in many different cultures (Bennett et al.,\n2004; Pinter & Greenwald, 2011). In-group favoritism also occurs\non trait ratings, such that in-group members are rated as\nhaving more positive characteristics than are out-group\nmembers (Hewstone, 1990).\nGroup Interactions and\nCulture | 363 Ingroup favoritism is shaped by ecological factors like climate,\nnational wealth (resources) and connections to family and members\nof the ingroup. [Image by Suvodeb Banerjee CC \u2013 BY,\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/suvodeb/5415854024]\nVan de Vliert (2011) examined in-group favoritism using three\nmajor components that shape culture: ecology, resources and\npeople (Chapter 2). Using data from almost 180 countries, in-\ngroup favoritism was highest in cultures with the lowest\nincome and harshest most demanding climates (e.g., extreme\nheat or cold) and lowest in cultures with high national income\nand demanding climates. By examining ecology, national\nwealth and group preferences collectively, rather than\nindividually, a picture begins to emerge that suggests in-group\nfavoritism likely co-evolved with culture, as groups adapted to\nsurvive ecological challenges with limited resources.\n364 | Group Interactions and Culture Cooperation\nCooperation refers to the ability of humans to work together\ntoward common goals and is required for survival. Groups with\nbetter member cooperation were more likely to survive\n(Bowles et al., 2012). As we learned earlier (see Chapter 2)\ncooperation occurs in non-human primates (e.g., chimpanzees,\nbonobos) but it is almost exclusively limited to kin and is almost\nnever extended to strangers (Melis & Semmann, 2010). Some\npsychologists believe that complex cooperation among\nhumans is related to psychological processes like empathy,\ntrust, group identity, memory, shared intentionality and culture\n(Matsumoto & Juang, 2013; Moskowitz & Piff, 2018).\nCooperation | 365 Animals are known to cooperate with members of their group\nbut humans are also known to cooperate with strangers [Image\nby no attribution CC0]\nOur ability to understand someone\u2019s emotional experience,\nempathy, occurs when we take on perspective of the person\n366 | Cooperation and try to understand his or her point of view. When\nempathizing with a person in distress, the natural desire to\nhelp is often expressed as a desire to cooperate. Trust is the\nbelief that another person\u2019s actions will be beneficial to one\u2019s\nown interests (Kramer, 1999) which enables us to work together\nas a single unit. When it comes to cooperation, trust is\nnecessary and critical (Pruitt & Kimmel, 1977; Parks, Henager, &\nScamahorn, 1996; Chaudhuri, Sopher, & Strand, 2002); however,\nour willingness to trust others depends on their actions and\nreputation. One common example of the difficulties in trusting\nothers that you might be familiar with is a group project for a\nclass. Many students dislike group projects because they worry\nabout social loafing, the way that one person expends less\neffort but still benefits from the efforts of the group.\nOver time, individuals develop a reputation for helping or for\nloafing. Willingness to cooperate with others depends on their\nprior actions and reputation and our memory of the events.\nNowak and Sigmund (1998) demonstrated with a\nmathematical model that a person with a reputation for\nhelping gets help later on, regardless of whether they provided\nhelp to you directly in the past. In a study that used an\neconomic game, found that as the game progressed donations\n(help) were more frequently given to individuals who had been\ngenerous in earlier rounds of the game (Wedekind & Milinski,\n2000). Individuals who were perceived as cooperative gained a\nreputational advantage, earning them more partners willing to\ncooperate and a larger overall monetary reward.\nThere are cultural differences in the belief about the\ngoodness of people, which can be seen as a measure of trust.\nHigh trust refers to positive expectations about the behaviors\nof others (returning a lost wallet) and low trust refers to\nnegative expectations about the behaviors of others (keeping\na lost wallet). High trust societies are more likely to cooperate\nwithout sanctions (punishment); however, there is a lot of\nvariation in cooperation across cultures (Gatcher et al., 2010)\nCooperation | 367 and willingness to sanction group members is moderated by\nfactors like social norms, country gross domestic product (GDP)\nand individual reputation (whether someone has helped in the\npast) (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013).\nPrisoners Dilemma if you and the other participant cooperate you\neach get $5; if you both defect (do not cooperate) you each get $2\nand if one person cooperates and one defects the defector gets $8.\n[Image provided by Noba Project]\nEconomists and psychologists often use the Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma to examine cooperation and competition\nexperimental studies. In the prisoner\u2019s dilemma, the\nparticipants are shown a payoff matrix in which numbers are\nused to express the potential outcomes for the each of the\nplayers in the game, given the decisions made by each player.\n368 | Cooperation The payoffs are chosen beforehand by the experimenter in\norder to create a situation that is similar to a real-world\noutcome and are normally arranged so that each individual\nis better off acting in his or her immediate self-interest. If all\nindividuals act according to their self-interest, then everyone\nwill be worse off. Yamagishi (1986, 1988) categorized Japanese\nand American participants into low trust and high trust\ncategories and then asked them to take part in an experiment\nwhere they could give other participants money (a variation\nof the prisoner\u2019s dilemma). High trusters provided more\ncooperation without the presence of sanctions and low trusters\nprovided more cooperation with sanctions. Culture variation in\nlevels of trust (high/low) is present within and across cultures.\nIt appears that across cultures punishment promotes\ncooperation of social loafers in societies with high trust more\nthan low trust societies (Balliet & Van Lange, 2013). High trust\ncultures are more willing to punish social loafers. Low trust\ncultures may not share the social norm of \u2018no free rides\u2019 so\npunishment isn\u2019t going to work in those situations.\nSocial norms determine whether social loafing is punished or\nsanctioned which also helps determine cultural levels of cooperation\n[Image By EDCU320RHTCC BY-SA 4.0 from Wikimedia Commons]\nCooperation | 369 Group identification can strongly influence cooperation and\npeople are generally reluctant to cooperate with members of\nan out-group, or those outside the boundaries of one\u2019s own\nsocial group (Allport, 1954). Matsumoto and Hwang (2011) used\nthe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma to examine whether cultural\ndifferences were related to intercultural (between cultures)\ncompetition and cooperation. Researchers used the prisoner\u2019s\ndilemma to test their hypothesis. Students were paired as\nsame-sex and same ethnicity or same sex but different\nethnicity. The pairs with different ethnicities had fewer\ncooperative behaviors and more competitive behaviors.\nUsing a variation of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma among small-\nscale subsistence societies revealed that the interdependence\nof a group (i.e., relying on one another for survival) predicted\nthe likelihood of cooperation. For example, among the people\nof the Lamelara in Indonesia, who survive by hunting whales\nin groups of a dozen or more individuals, donations in the\nultimatum game were extremely high, approximately 58% of\nthe total sum. In contrast, the Machiguenga people of Peru,\nwho are generally economically independent at the family\nlevel, donated much less on average, about 26% of the total\nsum. The interdependence of people for survival, therefore,\nseems to be a key component of why people decide to\ncooperate with others (Henrich et al., 2001).\nCooperation is an important part of our everyday lives and\neven though cooperation can sometimes be difficult to\nachieve, certain practices, such as emphasizing shared goals\nand engaging in open communication, can promote\nteamwork and even break down rivalries. Though choosing not\nto cooperate can sometimes achieve a larger reward for an\nindividual in the short term, cooperation is often necessary to\nensure that the group as a whole is successful.\n370 | Cooperation Stereotypes, Prejudice\nand Discrimination\nAs discussed earlier, the social groups we belong to, help form\nour identities (Tajfel, 1974) and people are often biased against\nothers outside of their own social group (out-groups), showing\nprejudice (emotional bias), stereotypes (cognitive bias), and\ndiscrimination (behavioral bias). These three aspects of bias are\nrelated, but they each can occur separately from the others\n(Dovidio & Gaertner, 2010; Fiske, 1998).\n[Image provided by Noba Project]\nStereotypes, Prejudice and\nDiscrimination | 371 Stereotypes\nA stereotype is a specific belief or assumption (thoughts)\nabout individuals based solely on their membership in a group,\nregardless of their individual characteristics. Stereotypes can\nbe positive or negative and when overgeneralized are applied\nto all members of a group. For example, the model minority\nstereotype of Asian Americans as highly intelligent, diligent\nand good at math can be damaging professionally,\nacademically (Trytten et al., 2012). These beliefs are\novergeneralized to all members of the group, even though\nmany of the individual group members may in fact be struggle\nacademically and professionally.\nAnother example of a well-known stereotype involves beliefs\nabout racial differences among athletes. As Hodge, Burden,\nRobinson, and Bennett (2008) point out, black male athletes\nare often believed to be more athletic, yet less intelligent, than\ntheir white male counterparts. These beliefs persist despite a\nnumber of high profile examples to the contrary. Sadly, such\nbeliefs often influence how these athletes are treated by others\nand how they view themselves and their own capabilities.\nStereotypes are universal. Whether or not you agree with a\nstereotype the content of stereotypes is generally well-known\nwithin in a given culture (Devine, 1989).\n372 | Stereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination Stereotypes are universal and the content of stereotypes is generally\nwell known in a given culture. [Image by: Stereotype Keira McPhee\nand provided by Noba Project].\nPrejudice\nPrejudice is a negative attitude and feeling toward an\nindividual based solely on one\u2019s membership in a particular\nsocial group (Allport, 1954; Brown, 2010). Prejudice is common\nagainst people who are members of an unfamiliar cultural\ngroup. An example of prejudice is having a negative attitude\ntoward people who are not born in the United States. Although\npeople holding this prejudiced attitude do not know all people\nwho were not born in the United States, they dislike them due\nto their status as foreigners.\nExplicit prejudice, negative feelings about an out-group that\nare openly admitted, is very difficult to measure because this\nis generally not socially acceptable. This means that tests and\nStereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination | 373 instruments measuring prejudice may be susceptible to\nsocially desirable responding (Chapter 2). To address this\nresearch bias, psychologists have developed several ways to\nmeasure implicit prejudice, which is the relatively automatic\nand unconscious in-group preference. The most famous\ninstrument used is the Implicit Association Test (IAT;Greenwald,\nBanaji, Rudman, Farnham, Nosek, & Mellott, 2002; Greenwald,\nMcGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). The IAT is done on the computer\nand measures how quickly you can sort words or pictures into\ndifferent categories. People may explicitly deny prejudice but\nwhen they\u2019re given this computer task to categorize people\nfrom these out-groups that automatic or unconscious\nhesitation (a result of having mixed evaluations about the out-\ngroup) will show up in the test. Numerous studies have\nrevealed, people tend to be faster at pairing their own group\nwith good categories as compared to pairing others\u2019 groups.\nIn fact, this finding generally holds regardless if one\u2019s group is\nmeasured according race, age, religion, nationality, and even\ntemporary, insignificant memberships. Automatic associations\nand unconscious responses are often driven by society\u2019s\nstereotypes and can result in discrimination like allocating\nfewer resources to disliked out-groups (Rudman & Ashmore,\n2009).\nDiscrimination\nWhen someone acts on prejudiced attitudes toward a group\nof people this is known as discrimination. Discrimination is\nnegative action toward an individual as a result of one\u2019s\nmembership in a particular group (Allport, 1954; Dovidio &\nGaertner, 2004). As a result of holding negative beliefs\n(stereotypes) and negative attitudes (prejudice) about a\nparticular group, people often treat the target of prejudice\n374 | Stereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination poorly. Discrimination can extend to institutions or social and\npolitical systems.\nInstitutional discrimination refers to practices (at the social\nlevel) which serve to reinforce social norms for preference,\nprivilege and limited access to services and resources. In the\nUnited States, African Americans have lower life expectancy,\nexperience higher risk for a cardiac events and higher rates of\nanxiety and depression than others racial and ethnic groups\nin the United States (Williams, 1999; Williams & Mohammed,\n2009). Native American populations experience higher rates\nof injury than other ethnic and racial groups (Williams, 1999).\nThese disparities are not simply the result of lifestyle choices\nbut represent systemic practices in healthcare that treat racial\nand ethnic minorities differently, as well as the effect of chronic\nprejudice and racism (Gee & Ford, 2011; Williams, 1999; Williams\n& Mohammed, 2009).\nSuicide rates among lesbians and gays are substantially\nhigher than rates for the general population, and it has been\nargued that this in part due to the negative outcomes of\nprejudice, including negative attitudes and social isolation\n(Halpert, 2002). Stigmatized individuals who report\nexperiencing more exposure to discrimination or other forms\nof unfair treatment also report more depression, anger, and\nanxiety and lower levels of life satisfaction and happiness\n(Swim, Hyers, Cohen, & Ferguson, 2001). Exposure to chronic\nand persistent discrimination is harmful to our health.\nStereotypes, Prejudice and Discrimination | 375 Conformity\nYou have probably noticed that we often adopt the\npreferences, actions and attitudes of the people around us like\nfashion, music, foods, and entertainment. Our views on political\nissues, religious questions, and lifestyles also reflect, to some\ndegree, the attitudes of the people we interact with. Decisions\nabout risk-taking behaviors such as smoking and drinking are\nalso influenced by whether the people we spend time with\nengage in these activities. Psychologists refer to this tendency\nto act and think like the people around us as conformity.\nConsider a classic study conducted many years ago by\nSolomon Asch (1956). Male college students gave wrong\nanswers to a simple visual judgment task rather than go\nagainst the group (Asch, 1956). Variations of Asch\u2019s procedures\nhave been conducted numerous times across many cultures\n(Bond, 2005; Bond & Smith, 1996) and conformity appears to\nbe a universal construct. Bond and Smith (1996) analyzed the\nresults of 133 studies that used Asch\u2019s line-judging task in 17\ndifferent countries that were categorized as collectivist or\nindividualist in orientation. Results were significant, conformity\nwas greater in more collectivist countries than in individualistic\ncountries. Compared with individualistic cultures, people who\nlive in collectivist cultures place a higher value on the goals of\nthe group than on individual preferences. They also are more\nmotivated to maintain harmony in their interpersonal relations.\nConformity and Culture\nKim and Markus (1999) examined conformity using\nadvertisements from popular magazines in the United States\nand in Korea to see if they emphasized conformity and\n376 | Conformity uniqueness differently. As you can see Figure 1, the researchers\nfound that while magazines ad from the United States tended\nto focus on uniqueness (e.g., \u201cChoose your own view!\u201d;\n\u201cIndividualize\u201d) Korean ads tended to focus more on themes of\nconformity (e.g., \u201cSeven out of 10 people use this product\u201d; \u201cOur\ncompany is working toward building a harmonious society\u201d).\nFigure 1. Ads from United States magazines emphasized ways to be\nunique while Korean magazine ads emphasized themes of\nconformity. [Image provided by bccampus.ca]\nAlthough the effects of individual differences on conformity\ntend to be smaller than those of the social context, they do\nmatter. And gender and cultural differences can also be\nimportant. Conformity, like most other psychological processes\nrepresents an interaction between culture and the individual.\nConformity | 377 Obedience\nAlthough we may be influenced by the people around us more\nthan we recognize, whether we conform to the norm is up\nto us but sometimes decisions about how to act are not so\neasy. Sometimes we are directed by a more powerful person\nto do things we may not want to do. Psychologists who study\nobedience are interested in how people react when given an\norder or command from someone perceived to be in a position\nof authority. In many situations, obedience is a good thing like\nobeying parents, teachers, and police officers but there is a\ndark side to obedience. When \u201cfollowing orders\u201d or \u201cjust doing\nmy job,\u201d people can violate ethical principles, break laws or\nharm other people. It was this unsettling side of obedience\nthat led to some of the most famous and most controversial\nresearch in the history of psychology.\n378 | Obedience Migram explored the willingness of study\nparticipants to obey an authority figure who\ninstructed them to perform acts conflicting\nwith their personal conscience. [Image\nprovided by Noba Project]\nMilgram (1963, 1965, 1974) wanted to know why so many\notherwise decent German citizens went along with the\nbrutality of the Nazi leaders during the Holocaust so he\nconducted a series of laboratory investigations. In his now\nfamous deception study, Milgram found that 65% of research\nparticipants were willing to administer, what they believed\nwere, 330-volt electric shocks to a fellow research participant\ndespite hearing cries and protests. No one was hurt or injured\nduring this study, the research participant receiving the electric\nshocks was a confederate \u2013 part of the study \u2013 but the actual\nresearch participants did not know this. They were willing to\nObedience | 379 administer electric shocks because the experimenter told\nthem to continue. These were not cruel people but they\nfollowed the experimenter\u2019s instructions to administer what\nthey believed to be excruciating if not dangerous electric\nshocks to an innocent person.\nObedience and Culture\nThe initial research was conducted using male participants but\nMilgram found that women participants followed the\nexperimenter\u2019s instructions at exactly the same rate that the\nmen had. Some people have argued that today we are more\naware of the dangers of blind obedience than we were when\nthe research was conducted in the 1960s; however, findings\nfrom partial and modified replications of Milgram\u2019s procedures\nrecently conducted suggest that people respond to the\nsituation today much like they did a half a century ago (Burger,\n2009). Cross cultural studies of obedience found rates of\nobedience similar to those of Milgram. The United States had\nan obedience rate of 61% and the mean across other cultures\nwas about 66%. Some countries had much lower rates of\nobedience (India reported 42% and Spain reported about 50%)\nwhile some countries had much higher rates of obedience\n(Germany and Austria reported about 80%) (Blass, 2011). Culture\nand social norms shape perspectives of authority, obedience\nand interact with individual decision making.\nDecades of research on social influence, including conformity\nand obedience make it clear that we live in a social world and\nthat, for better or worse, much of what we do reflects the\npeople we encounter and the groups we belong to. Disturbing\nimplications from the research are that, under the right\ncircumstances, each of us may be capable of acting in some\nvery uncharacteristic and perhaps some very unsettling ways.\n380 | Obedience Chapter Review\nFor humans, group membership promotes survival,\nmotivation, and a sense of self.\nThrough the process of enculturation, we learn who belongs\nin our group (in-group) and who does not belong (out-group).\nCommitment to our groups can be positive and enriching or\ndestructive which results in infrahumanization, negative\nstereotypes and discrimination.

How do we learn right and wrong? These are just two\nof the many questions that psychologists consider when\nexploring the concept of morality.\nAs humans, our behaviors are guided in part by a set of social\nnorms about morality that forms a basic and important part of\nour culture. Morality refers to a system of beliefs about what\nis right and good compared to what is wrong or bad. Morals\nvary dramatically across time, place and across cultures. There\nis a great deal of cultural variation in morality, and social norms\nrelate to a wide variety of behaviors. Some cultures approve of\npolygamy and homosexuality, whereas others do not. In some\ncultures, it is appropriate for men and women to be held to\ndifferent standards, whereas in other cultures, this is seen as\nwrong. Even things that seem completely normal to us in the\nWest, such as dancing, eating beef, and allowing men to cook\nmeals for women, are seen in some other cultures as immoral.\nMorals are held and agreed to by all members of the culture.\nIn most cases, morals are upheld through rules, laws, and other\ntypes of sanctions for their transgression. We give rewards to\npeople who express our preferred morality, for instance, in the\nform of prizes, honors, and awards, and we punish those who\nviolate our moral standards. We generally attribute positive\nevaluations to people we consider moral (e.g., trustworthy,\nempathetic, friendly) and negative evaluations of people we\nconsider to be immoral (Bastian, Laham, Wilson, Haslam, &\nKoval, 2010).\nLearning Objectives\nAt the end of the chapter, you should be able to:\n1.

Describe how dehumanization can influence moral\nreasoning.\nCulture and Morality | 385  Universal Morality\nSome of the most important and fundamental moral principles\nseem to be universally held by all people in all cultures and\ndo not change over time. It has been found that starting at\nabout age 10, children in most cultures come to a belief about\nharm-based morality\u2014that harming others, either physically or\nby violating their rights, is wrong (Helwig & Turiel, 2002). Some\nresearch suggests that morality development begins much\nearlier in human development. Hamlin and colleagues used\na puppet morality play in an experiment with infants and\ntoddlers that found children preferred people who help others\nreach a goal (prosocial behaviors) and avoided people who\nwere harmful, or who get in the way of others reaching a goal.\nAs early as 3 months age, humans are evaluating the behaviors\nof others and assigning a positive value to helpful, cooperative\nbehaviors (Hamlin et al., 2007; Hamlin & Wynn, 2011) and\nnegative values to harmful or selfish behaviors. These\nfundamental and universal principles of morality include\nindividual rights, freedom, equality, autonomy and\ncooperation.\nThe theory that has the most cross-cultural empirical\nsupport is Kohlberg\u2019s Stages of Moral Development, a cognitive\ndevelopment theory inspired by the work of Piaget. Moral\ndevelopment refers to the changes in moral beliefs as a person\ngrows older and gains maturity.\nAccording to Kohlberg\u2019s theory, morality is based on the\nconcept of equality and reciprocity of helping that can be\npredicted at certain ages. To develop this theory, Kohlberg\nposed moral dilemmas to people of all ages; however, they\nwere all White, males from the United States. One of Kohlberg\u2019s\nbest-known moral dilemmas is commonly known as the Heinz\nUniversal Morality | 387 dilemma and participants were asked to decide what Heinz\nshould do.\nIn Europe, a woman was near death from a special\nkind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctor\u2019s\nthought might save her. It was a form of radium\nthat a druggist in the same town had recently\ndiscovered. The drug was expensive to make, but\nthe druggist was charging ten times what the drug\ncost to make. He paid $200 for the radium and\ncharged $2000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick\nwoman\u2019s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew\nto borrow the money, but he could only get\ntogether about $1000, which is half of what it cost.\nHe told the druggist that his wife was dying and\nasked him to see it cheaper or let him pay later. The\ndruggist said, \u201cNo, I discovered the drug and I\u2019m\ngoing to make money from it.\u201d So, Heinz got\ndesperate and broke into the man\u2019s store to steal\nthe drug for his wife. Should the husband have done\nthat? (Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379).\nAfter presenting this and other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg\nreviewed people\u2019s responses. Kohlberg was not interested in\nwhether participants answered yes or no to the dilemma but\nrather he was interested in the reasoning behind their answer.\nDepending on the rationale, Kohlberg placed people into\ndifferent stages of moral reasoning. Kohlberg identified three\nmain levels of moral reasoning:\n\u2022 Pre-conventional\n388 | Universal Morality \u2022 Conventional\n\u2022 Post-conventional\nEach level is associated with increasingly complex stages of\nmoral and cognitive development. According to Kohlberg, an\nindividual progresses from the capacity for pre-conventional\nmorality (before age 9) to the capacity for conventional morality\n(early adolescence), and toward attaining post-conventional\nmorality (once formal operational thought is attained), which\nonly a few fully achieve. Kohlberg placed responses that\nreflected the reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug\nbecause his wife\u2019s life is more important than the pharmacist\nmaking money in the highest stage. The value of a human\nlife overrides the pharmacist\u2019s greed. It is important to realize\nthat even those people who have the most sophisticated, post-\nconventional reasons for some choices may make other\nchoices to avoid getting into trouble (e.g., pre-conventional\nreasons).\nUniversal Morality | 389 [Image provided by Noba Project]\n390 | Universal Morality Cultural Considerations\nof Kohlberg\u2019s Theory\nThere is cross-cultural support for Kohlberg\u2019s theory of moral\ndevelopment (Gibbs, et al., 2007; Snarey, 1985). It appears that\npeople progress through the stages in the same order;\nhowever, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at\ndifferent rates. Some researchers question the universality of\nall stages in all cultures. For example, the highest level of\nKohlberg\u2019s theory posits that individual principles should\noverride social or cultural tradition and laws. Inherent in this\nview is a hierarchy which is inconsistent with collectivist\ncultural values. Additionally, Kohlberg\u2019s theory does not\nconsider relationships, affiliation or justice. As you might\nexpect, his work has been criticized for using only White, males\nfrom the Midwestern United States and for his assertion that\nwomen seem to be deficient in their moral reasoning abilities\nwhen compared to men.\nCultural Considerations of\nKohlberg\u2019s Theory | 391 By 10 children in most cultures believe that harming others, either\nphysically or by violating their rights, is wrong [Image by No\nAttribution https://pixabay.com/en/\njamaica-boys-children-outside-80749/]\nCarol Gilligan (1982) criticized Kohlberg\u2019s theory and instead\nproposed that males and females reason differently about\nmorality. She argued that girls and women focus more on\nstaying connected and maintaining interpersonal\nrelationships, whereas boys and men emphasize justice and\nindividual rights. She labelled these the Morality of Caring and\nthe Morality of Justice. Additionally, Shaffer and colleagues\n(2002) argued that Kohlberg\u2019s theory neglects to consider the\ncentral role that emotion plays in morality. Given that emotions\nplay a critical role in influencing our thoughts and motivating\nour actions, it seems critical that emotion be part of the model.\nOther models of morality have emerged to address these\nlimitations and the most widely discussed within cultural\npsychology is the Three Ethic Model of Morality.\n392 | Cultural Considerations of Kohlberg\u2019s Theory Cultural Alternatives to\nMoral Development\nShweder and colleagues (1984; 1987) proposed a new model of\nethics that address concepts consistent with the moral belief\nsystems of many cultures and not restricted to Western values\nof autonomy and individual rights. Cultural anthropologists\nand some cultural psychologists argue that morality is not\nalways universal but rather unique cultural experiences shape\nviews of fairness, morality and justice. Using fieldwork in India\nwith adults and children of the Brahman class (sometimes\nreferred to as the untouchables), Shweder and colleagues\nfound that Western morality of harm avoidance and individual\nrights was insufficient and neglected other cultural definitions\nof morality and so created the Three Ethic Model of Morality:\n\u2022 Ethic of Autonomy most closely aligns with Kohlberg\u2019s\ntheory of morality with an emphasis on harm, rights,\njustice and personal autonomy. Principles of fairness\nemerge very early in development, prior to socialization\ninfluences (Wainryb, 2006; Sunbar, 2018). Children in\ndiverse cultures such as the United States, India, China,\nTurkey, and Brazil share a pervasive view about upholding\nfairness and the wrongfulness of inflicting harm on others\n(Wainryb, 2006).\n\u2022 Ethic of Community refers to being part of an organized\ncommunity and recognizing that you have a social role\nwithin that community. This ethnic encompasses\nrelationships, social obligations, duty, hierarchy and\ninterdependence on community members.\n\u2022 Ethic of Divinity addresses our relationship with a higher\npower, divinity, the sacred, godliness and the order of the\nCultural Alternatives to Moral\nDevelopment | 393 natural world.\nCross-cultural research has found support for the Three Ethic\nModel of Morality and the role of culture and moral judgment\nacross different populations (Haidt, Koller & Dias, 1993). Haidt\nand colleagues found that children and adults in the United\nStates and individuals with high socioeconomic status (SES)\nprovided responses more consistent with ethics of autonomy\nthan community or divinity. Samples of children and adults\nfrom Brazil had broader definitions of morality that extended\nbeyond harm and autonomy.\nIntracultural research within the United States has found\nthat political liberals and conservatives emphasize different\nmoral foundations with regard to harm and fairness (Graham,\nHaidt, & Nosek, 2009). The moral foundations of the groups\nwere the same (no real moral differences between the political\ngroups) but the degree of endorsement for some morals was\nsignificantly different for political conservatives and liberals.\n394 | Cultural Alternatives to Moral Development Social Fairness\nAn essential part of morality involves determining what is\nconsidered \u201cright\u201d or \u201cfair\u201d in social interactions. As humans, we\nwant things to be fair, we try to be fair ourselves, and we react\nnegatively when we see things that are unfair. There is cultural\nvariation regarding fairness because we determine what is or\nis not fair by relying on another set of social norms; the beliefs\nabout how people should be treated fairly (Tyler & Lind, 2001;\nTyler & Smith, 1998).\nMost of us are familiar with the concept of equality, which\nsuggests that everyone is treated the same and provided the\nsame resources to succeed. For example, a health clinic in a\nsmall village can be open to everyone, but some villagers may\nlack the means to get to the village, or may not be able to\nafford medication. In this scenario, equality of health services\nhas created a disparity of care \u2013 is that fair?\nAnother example that most of you are familiar with is\napplying for a job online. Most organizations, regardless of size\nalmost exclusively use online recruitment and application\nprocesses which provides one system that everyone can use to\napply for a job. One system and one platform that is the same\nfor everyone \u2013 that\u2019s equality, right? Except that the online\napplication process may not be compatible with screen readers\nfor the visually impaired and blind or the hiring algorithm may\nexclude you because of that D you earned in math. An\nunderlying assumption of equality is that everyone starts in\nthe same place and equally benefits from the same supports,\nwhich may or may not be the case.\nSocial Fairness | 395 Health disparity can sometimes be the result of health equally rather\nthan health equity with regard to access, resources, and allocation.\nFemale Doctor with Medical Corp [Image by DFID CC BY 2.0]\nEquity means ensuring that resources are equally distributed\nbased on needs (Omrani-Khoo et al., 2013). Equity requires\naccounting for historical and current inequalities among\ngroups of people who have been marginalized, excluded or\nexperienced institutional discrimination. In this way, the\nconcept of fairness is then based on the social and historical\ncontext. In our example about the clinic, health care workers\nmight provide mobile care to reach villagers who cannot come\nto the clinic. They might also dispense medication on a sliding\nscale of payment so poor patients can get the treatment they\nneed. When applying for a job, alternative applications and\nformats can be available for persons with disabilities when\napplying for jobs. The underlying assumption of equity is that\neveryone starts from a different place and receives the specific\nsupport and accommodations needed to produce fairness.\nEquality and equity are separate constructs and sameness\n396 | Social Fairness does not always translate into fairness, particularly across\ncultures. Justice, refers to the legal or philosophical perspective\nthrough which fairness is administered for the distribution of\nwealth, opportunities for personal activity, and social privileges.\nCurrent social justice efforts emphasize removing obstacles\nand underlying systemic barriers so that inequity is addressed\nand everyone receives equal access and resources. In the online\napplication example, employers could ensure that their online\nplatform is compatible with screen readers, videos have closed\ncaptions, fonts, colors and contrast can be adjusted to facilitate\nthe process for individuals of all abilities.\nOne type of social fairness, known as distributive justice,\nrefers to our judgments and perceptions about whether and\nhow available rewards (resources) and costs are shared by\n(distributed across) group members. For example, if two people\nwork equally hard on a project, they should get the same grade\non it but if one works harder than the other, then the more\nhardworking partner should get a better grade. Distributive\nfairness is based on our perceptions of equity and is shaped by\ncultural norms.\nBerman and colleagues (1984) presented American and\nIndian participants with a scenario about how to distribute\na company bonus to employees. Findings revealed that\nAmerican workers distributed the bonus based on equity\nnorms (individual contributions to the company); whereas, the\nIndian workers distributed the bonus along need-based norms.\nSocial Fairness | 397 Inequality aversion among children is shaped by culture\nand is not universal.\n[Image by krzyboy2o Children Sharing a Milkshake CC BY\n2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Children_sharing_a_milkshake.jpg]\nRecent research found that when presented with an uneven\nnumber of items, children tend to throw one item away rather\nthan share the item unequally between two people they did\nnot know. Paulus (2015) conducted a cross-cultural study to\ndetermine whether inequality aversion (e.g., throwing away\nrather than unequally sharing) is a universal concept. Results\nrevealed that 6-7-year-old children in South Africa and the\n398 | Social Fairness United States were more likely to throw out a resource rather\nthan distribute it unequally. We might think of this as \u2018better\nto be fair\u2019. Ugandan children were more likely to distribute the\nresource even if it was unequally distributed. We might think\nof this as \u2018wrong to waste\u2019. These results challenge inequality\naversion as a universal and suggests that there are cross-\ncultural differences in how children\u2019s fairness-related decision\nmaking develops.\nSocial Fairness | 399 Psychological\nReactions to Unfair\nBehavior\nThings seem fair and just when we see that balances in rewards\nand costs are occurring, but things seem unfair and unjust\nwhen rewards and costs are not balanced. The preference for\nfairness has been proposed to be a basic human impulse (Tyler\n& Blader, 2000), and when we perceive unfairness, we also\nexperience negative emotional responses in brain regions\nassociated with reward and punishment (Tabibnia, Satpute, &\nLieberman, 2008). The experience of unfairness is associated\nwith negative emotions, including anger and contempt,\nwhereas fairness is associated with positive emotions.\nHumans believe in the importance of fairness in part because\nif we did not, then we would be forced to accept the fact that\nlife is unpredictable and that negative things can occur to us at\nany time. Believing in fairness allows us to feel better because\nwe can believe that we get what we deserve and deserve what\nwe get (e.g., just world hypothesis). These beliefs allow us to\nmaintain control over our worlds. To believe that those who\nwork hard are not rewarded and that accidents happen to\ngood people forces us to concede that we too are vulnerable.\nOne way to create a \u201cjust world\u201d is to reinterpret behaviors\nand outcomes so that the events seem to be fair and one way\nthat people do this is by blaming the victim (Lerner, 1980).\nBlaming the victim means interpreting the negative outcomes\nthat occur to others internally so that it seems that they\ndeserved them. When we see that bad things have happened\nto other people, we tend to blame the people for them, even if\nthey are not at fault. We may believe that poor people deserve\n400 | Psychological Reactions to\nUnfair Behavior to be poor because they are lazy, that crime victims deserve to\nbe victims because they were careless, and that people with\nAIDS deserve their illness. In fact, the more threatened we feel\nby an apparent unfairness, the greater is our need to protect\nourselves from the dreadful implication that it could happen to\nus, and the more we disparage the victim.\nThe just world hypothesis is a way of coping with unfairness. [Image:\nSascha Kohlmann, CC BY-SA 2.0, provided by Noba Project]\nWe learned earlier about infrahumanization, which is the\ntendency to see outgroups as less human or as having less\nhumanity. Infrahumaziation refers to attitudes and beliefs and\nPsychological Reactions to Unfair Behavior | 401 dehumanization refers to behaviors that undermine the\nindividuality, humanness and rights of others. Denying\nhumanity in others can lead to moral judgements and\ndehumanization may be a consequence, as well as a cause\nof harmful behavior against individuals deemed as immoral\n(Bastian, Laham, Wilson, Haslam, & Koval, 2010; Bastian et al.,\n2011). For example, someone who violates social, cultural,\nreligious norms can be viewed as immoral, which can initiate\nsanctions (formal and informal) as well as violence. Once an\nindividual or group is found less human or immoral, treating\nthem differently is seen as justified, ethical and natural. For this\nreason, dehumanization is viewed as a central component to\nintergroup violence because frequently groups or individuals\nwho are considered immoral are treated unfairly.\nThe Jewish Holocaust provides an example of dehumanization in its\nextreme but dehumanization is not limited to war. [Image by\nNational Archives and Records Administration Public domain\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Stroop_Report_-_Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising_06b.jpg]\n402 | Psychological Reactions to Unfair Behavior Members of a minority group or other marginalized individuals\nand groups (e.g., sexual orientation, gender, disability, class,\nheritage, race) are susceptible and vulnerable to various forms\nof dehumanization. The Jewish Holocaust during World War\nII and slavery in the United States are infamous examples of\ndehumanization at its extreme.\nPsychological Reactions to Unfair Behavior | 403 Chapter Review\nMorality is a universal construct that is tied to the essence\nof what it means to be human and avoiding things harmful\nto ourselves and to others. Our moral development is\nenculturated \u2013 we learn our morality \u2013 which means that\nmorality, fairness and justice will be shaped by the unique\nexperiences of our culture. As humans we believe in fairness\nand when things are not fair we must change our perception\nto protect ourselves from the reality that we are vulnerable\nand not in control of the events that happen to us.\nInfrahumanization can result from these changes in our\nthinking which can lead to making judgments about others as\nimmoral. Dehumanization can seem justified and ethical when\nwe fail to see the humanity in others, particularly members\nof marginalized and minority groups. When deciding what is\nright, wrong and fair, it is important that we recognize within\nourselves the capacity to moralize and make judgements\nabout others.\nAcross human history, our humanity has often been tied to\nour morals and values. Morals vary from person-to-person but\ncultures create codes of conduct based on shared values and\nexpectations. Theories of morality have developed to explain\nthe distribution of resources and justice. Equality, equity, and\njustice are independent constructs that are prioritized\ndifferently across cultural interpretation of what is fair. The\necology and resources of a culture shape the development of\nbelief systems and sanctions. Dehumanization can be used by\nthose who look to justify discrimination while preserving moral\nidentity.\n404 | Chapter Review Vocabulary\nEthics are a set of concepts and principles that guide us in\ndetermining what behavior constitutes right and wrong\nconduct.\nIdeals are the principals or values that one actively pursues\nas a goal.\nJustice refers to the legal or philosophical theory by which\nfairness is administered.\nMorality refers to intentions, decisions, and actions that are\nconsidered \u201cproper\u201d based on standards/principals.\nValues are broad preferences concerning appropriate course\nof action or outcome.

In this way our identities cannot be\nsomething that we achieve and are our identities are never\ncomplete.\nIdentity is fluid, shaped by our experiences and defined by our\nmembership in groups.

[Image by Min An CC 0 https://www.pexels.com/photo/\nman-looking-at-mirror-1134184/]\nYou might remember that personal identities include the\ncomponents of self that are primarily intrapersonal and\nconnected to our life experiences. For example, you may be\nMulticultural Identities | 409 outgoing, love puzzles, hip-hop music or have a beautiful\nsinging voice. Our social identities are the components of self\nthat are derived from involvement in social groups with which\nwe are interpersonally committed. For example, we derive\naspects of our social identity from our family, from a\ncommunity of fans for a sports team or membership in a choir.\nWhile our personal identity choices express who we are, our\nsocial identities align us with particular groups. Through our\nsocial identities, we make statements about who we are and\nwho we are not (Spreckels, & Kotthoff, 2009).\nCultural identities and multicultural identities are based on\nsocially constructed categories that teach us a way of being\nand include expectations for social behavior or ways of acting\n(Yep, 2002). The ways of being and the social expectations for\nbehavior within cultural identities can change over time, but\nwhat separates them from most social identities is their\nhistorical roots (Collier, 1996). For example, think of how ways\nof being and acting have changed for African Americans since\nthe civil rights movement or for persons with disabilities since\nthe independent living movement and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act was passed in the United States.\nAlthough some identities are essentially permanent, the\ndegree to which we are aware of them, known as salience, can\nchange. We learned earlier that identity is fluid and changes\nbased on context. This means that the intensity with which\nwe identify with an identity can be different depending on\nthe situation. For example, an African American female may\nnot have difficulty deciding which box to check on the\ndemographic section of a survey but she may more intensely\nrelated to her African American identity if she becomes the\npresident of her college\u2019s Black Student Union. In the second\ncontext, being African American has become more salient. If\nshe studies abroad in Africa her junior year, she may be\nascribed an identity of American by African students rather\nthan African American. For the Africans, the visitor\u2019s identity\n410 | Multicultural Identities as American is probably more salient than her identity as\nsomeone of African descent.\nSomeone who identifies as biracial or multiracial may\nchange their racial identification as they engage in their\nidentity search. One intercultural communication scholar\nwrites of his experiences as an \u201cAsianlatinoamerican\u201d (Yep,\n2002). He notes repressing his Chinese identity as an\nadolescent living in Peru and then later embracing his Chinese\nidentity and learning about his family history while in college in\nthe United States.\nDominant cultural identities historically and currently have\nmore resources and influence, while non-dominant identities\nhistorically and currently have fewer resources and influence.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that these distinctions are being\nmade at the societal level, not the individual level. There are\nobviously exceptions, with people from non-dominant groups\nobtaining more resources and power than a person in a\ndominant group; however, the overall trend is that differences\nbased on cultural group membership has been\ninstitutionalized, and exceptions do not change this fact.\nAs a result of this uneven distribution of resources and power,\nmembers of dominant groups are granted privileges while\nnon-dominant groups which are at a disadvantage encounter\ninstitutionalized discrimination, including racism, sexism,\nheterosexism, and ableism (Chapter 11), limited access to\nresources, support, and social capital. As you read, think about\nhow circumstances may be different for an individual with\nmultiple non-dominant and/or dominant identities. Individuals\nwith dominant identities may not validate the experiences of\nthose in non-dominant groups because they do not experience\nthe oppression directed at those with non-dominant identities.\nFurther, they may find it difficult to acknowledge that not\nbeing aware of this oppression is due to privilege associated\nwith their dominant identities. For example, a white person\nin the United States may notice that a person of color was\nMulticultural Identities | 411 elected to a prominent political office; however, he may not\nsee the underlying reason that it is noticeable. The reason it\nis noticeable is because the overwhelming majority of political\nleaders are white in the United States.\noticeable but not the underlying reason that it is noticeable \u2013 the\noverwhelming majority of US leaders are white. [Image CC BY\nhttps://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov]\nBecause the experiences of non-dominant groups often goes\nunexamined by members of the dominant group, there is often\na lack of recognition of oppression and privilege which can\nmanifest in culturally biased language. For example, culturally\nbiased language can reference one or more multicultural\nidentities, including race, gender, age, sexual orientation, and\nability. Use of offensive or culturally biased language is usually\nnot intended to hurt or to harm others but is often\nunintentional and the product of ignorance. Showing an\nawareness of and addressing cultural bias in language is not\n412 | Multicultural Identities the same thing as engaging in political correctness, which\ntakes awareness to the extreme but does not do much to\naddress the bias aside from make people feel awkward or\nresentful. Using inclusive language reflects an understanding\nof an individual\u2019s unique circumstances, as well as\nacknowledges and validates the experiences of others.\nMembers of dominant groups may minimize, dismiss, or\nquestion the experiences of non-dominant groups or even\nview them as \u201ccomplainers\u201d or \u201cwhiners.\u201d People with\ndominant cultural identities who fail to examine privilege may\nfind it difficult to value cultural or social differences.\nRecognizing the existence of multiple cultural identities within\nnational and regional boundaries, and adopting actions and\npolicies to address them, are necessary to eliminate prejudice,\nstereotypes and conflicts, in order to ensure a healthy, inclusive\ncommunity.\nMulticultural Identities | 413 Acculturation\nAcculturation is the process of social, psychological, and\ncultural change that occurs as a result of blending between\ncultures (see Chapter 2). Immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers,\nand sojourners are typically the people we think of having to\nadapt to a new culture (Schwartz et al., 2010) but can happen\nto anyone who enters a new culture and must adjust to new\nnorms, values and systems. We learned earlier that\nenculturation is the process through which we first learn about\na culture and we can think of acculturation as the process for\nlearning about a second culture.\nEnculturation is the process through which we first learn about a\nculture and can think of acculturation as the process for learning\nabout a second culture. [Ellis Island Circa 1905 Public Domain; Image\nby Chris Immigrant Arriving At Ellis Island CC BY 2.0\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/83508181@N00/245963958]\nThe effects of acculturation can be seen at multiple levels in\nboth the original (native) and newly adopted (host) cultures.\nAt the group level, acculturation often results in changes to\nculture, customs, religious practices, diet, healthcare, and other\nsocial institutions. Some of the most noticeable group level\n414 | Acculturation effects of acculturation include changes in food, clothing, and\nlanguage. At the individual level, the process of acculturation\nrefers to the socialization process by which people adopt the\nvalues, customs, norms, attitudes, and behaviors of a host\nculture. This process has been linked to changes in daily\nbehavior, as well as numerous changes in psychological and\nphysical well-being.\nAcculturation | 415 Culture Shock\nAs part of the acculturation process individuals may experience\nculture shock, which occurs when individuals move to a\ncultural environment which is different from their own. It can\nalso describe the disorientation we feel when exposed to an\nunfamiliar way of life due to immigration to a new country, a\nvisit to a new country, move between social environments (e.g.,\nmoving away for college), or transitioning to another type of life\n(e.g, dating after divorce). Common issues associated culture\nshock include: loss of status (e.g., provider to unemployed),\nunfamiliar social systems and social norms (e.g., agencies\nrather than extended kin networks), distance from family and\nfriends, information overload, language barriers, generation\ngap, and possible technology gap. There is no way to prevent\nculture shock because everyone experiences and reacts to the\ncontrasts between cultures differently.\nCulture shock consists of at least one of four distinct phases:\n416 | Culture Shock \u2022 Honeymoon\n\u2022 Negotiation\n\u2022 Adjustment\n\u2022 Adaptation\nHoneymoon\nDuring this period, the differences between the old and new\nculture are seen in a romantic light. For example, after moving\nto a new country, an individual might love the new food, the\npace of life, and the locals\u2019 habits. During the first few weeks,\nmost people are fascinated by the new culture. They associate\nwith individuals who speak their language and who are polite\nto the foreigners. Like most honeymoon periods, this stage\neventually ends.\nNegotiation\nAfter some time (usually around three months depending on\nthe individual), differences between the old and new culture\nbecome more apparent and may create anxiety or distress.\nExcitement may eventually give way to irritation, frustration\nand anger as one continues to experience unpleasant events\nthat are strange and offensive to one\u2019s own cultural attitude.\nLanguage barriers, stark differences in public hygiene, traffic\nsafety, food accessibility and quality may heighten the feelings\nof disconnection from the surroundings.\nLiving in a different environment can have a negative,\nalthough usually short term, effect on our health. While\nnegotiating culture shock we may have insomnia because of\ncircadian rhythm disruption, problems with digestion because\nof gut flora due to different bacteria levels and concentrations\nin food and water, and difficulty in accessing healthcare or\nCulture Shock | 417 treatment (e.g., medicines with different names or active\ningredients).\nDuring the negotiation phase, people adjusting to a new\nculture often feel lonely and homesick because they are not\nyet used to the new environment and encounter unfamiliar\npeople, customs and norms every day. The language barrier\nmay become a major obstacle in creating new relationships.\nSome individuals find that they must pay special attention to\nculturally specific body language (e.g., arms crossed, smiling),\nconversation tone, and linguistic nuances and customs (e.g,\nhandshake, turn taking, ending a conversation). International\nstudents often feel anxious and feel more pressure while\nadjusting to new cultures because there is special emphasis on\ntheir reading and writing skills.\nAdjustment\nAs more time passes (usually 6 to 12 months) individuals\ngenerally grow accustomed to the new culture and develop\nroutines. The host country no longer feels new and life\nbecomes \u201cnormal\u201d. Problem-solving skills for dealing with the\nculture have developed and most individuals accept the new\nculture with a positive attitude. The culture begins to make\nsense, and negative reactions and responses to the culture\nhave decreased.\nAdaption\nIn the adaptation stage individuals are able to participate fully\nand comfortably in the host culture but this does not mean\ntotal conversion or assimilation. People often keep many traits\nfrom their native culture, such as accents, language and values.\nThis stage is often referred to as the bicultural stage.\n418 | Culture Shock Berry\u2019s Model of\nAcculturation\nCulture shock and the stages of culture shock are part of the\nacculturation process. Scholars in different disciplines have\ndeveloped more than 100 different theories of acculturation\n(Rudiman, 2003); however contemporary research has\nprimarily focused on different strategies and how acculturation\naffects individuals, as well as interventions to make the process\neasier (Berry, 1992).\nBerry proposed a model of acculturation that categorizes\nindividual adaptation strategies along two dimensions (Berry,\n1992). The first dimension concerns the retention or rejection of\nan individual\u2019s native culture (i.e. \u201cIs it considered to be of value\nto maintain one\u2019s identity and characteristics?\u201d). The second\ndimension concerns the adoption or rejection of the host\nculture. (\u201cIs it considered to be of value to maintain\nrelationships with the larger society?\u201d) From these two\nquestions four acculturation strategies emerge:\n\u2022 Assimilation occurs when individuals adopt the cultural\nnorms of a dominant or host culture, over their original\nculture.\n\u2022 Separation occurs when individuals reject the dominant\nor host culture in favor of preserving their culture of origin.\nSeparation is often facilitated by immigration to ethnic\nenclaves.\n\u2022 Integration occurs when individuals are able to adopt the\ncultural norms of the dominant or host culture while\nmaintaining their culture of origin. Integration leads to,\nand is often synonymous with biculturalism.\n\u2022 Marginalization occurs when individuals reject both their\nBerry\u2019s Model of\nAcculturation | 419 culture of origin and the dominant host culture.\nStudies suggest that the acculturation strategy people use can\ndiffer between their private and public areas of life (Arends-\nT\u00f3th, & van de Vijver, 2004). For instance, an individual may\nreject the values and norms of the host culture in his private life\n(separation) but he might adapt to the host culture in public\nparts of his life (i.e., integration or assimilation). Moreover,\nattitudes towards acculturation and the different acculturation\nstrategies available have not been consistent over time. For\nexample, for most of American history, policies and attitudes\nhave been based around established ethnic hierarchies with an\nexpectation of one-way assimilation for predominantly white\nEuropean immigrants (Fredrickson, 1999).\nThe metaphor of the melting pot has been used to describe\nthe immigration history of the United States but it doesn\u2019t\ncapture the experiences of many immigrant groups (Allen,\n2011). Generally, immigrant groups who were white, or light\nskinned, and spoke English were better able to assimilate but\n420 | Berry\u2019s Model of Acculturation immigrant groups that we might think of as white today were\nnot always considered white enough. For example, Irish and\nItalian immigrants were discriminated against and even\nportrayed as black in cartoons that appeared in newspapers\nand it wasn\u2019t until 1952 that Asian immigrants were allowed to\nbecome citizens of the United States (Allen, 2011).\nWithin the United States, separation as an acculturation\nstrategy can still be seen today in some religious communities\nsuch as the Amish and the Hutterites. An integration strategy\nfor acculturation can be observed within Deaf culture.\nIndividuals who are deaf use a different language to\ncommunicate, learn about their culture and language from\ninstitutions and not their family (most deaf children have\nhearing parents) and are united by shared experiences as\npersons with disabilities. Deaf individuals in the United States\nlive within the dominant culture and share the same cultural\nvalues but are separated by language and disability (Maxwell-\nMcCaw, et al., 2000). Members of the Deaf culture have created\ntheir own unique cultural and social norms for communicating,\ninteracting and experiencing the world around them.\nBerry\u2019s Model of Acculturation | 421 Immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers, and sojourners are typically\nthe individuals we think of as having to adapt to a new culture but\nindividuals with the United States may also acculturate. [Amish\nFamily on Morning Stroll Image by Johnny_Appleseed_1774 CC BY 2.0,\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/8959381@N04/552496564]\nSome acculturation research suggests that the integrated\nacculturation strategy has the most favorable psychological\noutcomes (Nguyuen, et al., 2007; Okasaki, et al., 2009) for\nindividuals adjusting to a host culture and marginalization has\nthe least favorable outcomes (Berry, et al., 2006). Additionally,\nmarginalization has been described as a maladaptive\nacculturation and coping strategy (Knust et al., 2013). Other\nresearchers have argued that the four strategies have very little\npredictive validity because people do not always fall neatly into\nthe four categories (Kunst et al., 2013; Schwartz et al., 2010).\nSituational determinants (e.g., traveling with family, familiarity\nwith language) and environment factors also impact the\navailability, advantage, and selection of different acculturation\nstrategies (Zhou, 1997).\n422 | Berry\u2019s Model of Acculturation Bilingualism and\nCulture\nAs noted in the earlier section, language can play a large role\nin the intensity of culture shock and an individual\u2019s adaptation\nto a new culture. A bilingual or multilingual person can\ntraditionally be defined as an individual who uses (understands\nand produces) two (or more) languages on a regular basis\n(Grosjean, 2013). Globally, the majority of individuals who speak\nEnglish also speak at least one other language fluently.\n\u2022 56% of Europeans speak more than one language (2018\nEurostat Yearbook)\n\u2022 20% of Americans speak more than one language (2016 US\nCensus Report)\n\u2022 19% of Canadians speak more than one language (2018\nGovernment of Canada)\nIt is not uncommon for individuals in China and Africa to speak\nmany languages. There are 7 major languages in China and\nmore in India and Africa when including specific regional and\ntribal dialects. Around the global monolingual speakers are the\nminority (Grosjean, 2013).\nA bilingual person\u2019s initial exposure to both languages may\nhave started in early childhood (e.g. before age 3) (Baker, 2006)\nbut exposure may also begin later in life. It is often assumed\nthat bilinguals must be equally proficient in their languages\nbut proficiency typically varies by domain. For example, a\nbilingual person may have greater proficiency for work-related\nterms in one language, and family-related terms in another\nlanguage (Grosjean, 2013).\nBilingualism and Culture | 423 Language proficiency varies by domain; this means that a person\nmay have greater proficiency for work-related terms in one language\nand family-related terms in another language Trilingual Sign Ontario\n[Image by Taprobanus CC0]\nTakano and Nado (1993) describe the foreign language effect\n(FLE) which refers to a temporary decline in thinking by those\nwho use a second language rather than their native language.\nThey explain that when an individual is spoken to, in the second\nlanguage, linguistic processing (not cognitive processing) is\nnecessary for an appropriate response and to accommodate\nthe processing thinking declines. With practice and increased\nproficiency, the decline diminishes (i.e., interpreters). Using\nGerman, Korean and English speakers, the researchers found\nthat the FLE was larger when the discrepancy between the\nnative and foreign languages was greater (e.g., German and\nKorean) and smaller when the differences between the native\nand foreign languages were smaller (e.g., German and English)\n(Takano & Nado, 1995).\n424 | Bilingualism and Culture Research examining the interaction between bilingual\nindividuals\u2019 first language and second language has shown\nthat both languages have an influence on one another, and\non cognitive functioning outside of language. For example,\nresearch on executive functions such as working memory,\nperception, and attentional and inhibitory control, has\nsuggested that bilinguals have cognitive advantages over their\nmonolingual peers (Marian & Shook, 2012).\nAround the global, monolingual speakers are the minority [Public\nDomain https://www.maxpixel.net/\nForeign-Dictionary-Learning-Languages-Translation-2317654]\nPsychological and cultural research has identified differences\namong multilingual and bilingual speakers when speaking the\nforeign language. For example, Ervin (1964) found that English/\nFrench bilinguals demonstrated different characteristics and\nemotions when telling stories (based on Thematic\nApperception Test) in English versus in French. Matsumoto and\ncolleague (2008) found that Spanish and English-speaking\nMexican bilinguals were more accurate in judging emotions in\nBilingualism and Culture | 425 English but inferred greater intensity of subjective experience\nin the expresser in Spanish.\nAdditionally, there appear to be age-related benefits for\nbilinguals. Speaking more than one language appears to help\nolder adults reduce cognitive decline and some research has\nsuggested that bilingual ability can delay the onset of\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Marian & Shook, 2012). It should be noted\nthat there is strong disagreement over how findings on\ncognitive benefits should be interpreted. Systematic reviews\nand meta-analyses of studies have found mixed evidence for\ncognitive advantages in healthy adults. Some have suggested\nthat publication bias (only publishing studies that show\npositive cognitive benefits) has provided a distorted view of\nthe evidence (Lenhonten, 2013). Though mixed, research results\nhave found support for cognitive, psychological and cultural\ndifferences in the experiences of bilingual and multilingual\nindividuals.\n426 | Bilingualism and Culture Cultural Switching\nAs we learned earlier, individuals who are fully immersed in\nmore than one culture likely have a bicultural or multicultural\nidentity, which may or may not be associated with language\nability or proficiency. Bicultural individuals may experience\ndifficulty balancing identities because of the influence of both\ncultures. Bicultural identity may also have positive effects on\nindividuals, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire\nfrom belonging to more than one culture. Using knowledge\nfrom more than one culture, individuals are able to make\ncognitive, behavioral and linguistic switches to negotiate\ndifferent social interactions and situations. We are going to\nlearn about two types of cultural switching:\n\u2022 Cultural frame switching\n\u2022 Code switching\nCultural Frame Switching\nCultural frame switching refers to the process of bicultural\nor multicultural individuals accessing different culture-specific\nmental modules or changing their perspective of the world,\ndepending on the language that is used (Hong, Chiu, & Kung,\n1997). Research with bicultural individuals has shown that the\npresence of culture-specific cues can elicit culture-specific,\nattributions values and personality differences. Benet-Martinez\nand colleagues (2002) found that Chinese American biculturals\ndisplayed more internal attributions when primed with\nAmerican icons (e.g., Superman), and more external\nattributions when primed with Chinese icons (e.g., Great Wall)\nSimilarly, Hong Kong Chinese and Chinese Americans\nCultural Switching | 427 generated more collective self-descriptions when their Chinese\nidentity was activated, than did North Americans. In a different\nstudy, North Americans and Chinese Americans generated\nmore individual self-descriptions, when their American identity\nwas activated, than did Hong Kong Chinese (Hong, Ip, Chiu,\nMorris, & Menon, 2001).\nDifferent personality traits were activated among Spanish \u2013\nEnglish bilinguals when completing a personality\nquestionnaire in English (Ram\u00edrez-Esparzaa, Goslinga, Benet-\nMart\u00ednez, Potter & Pennebaker, 2004). Spanish-English\nspeakers scored higher on measures on Extraversion,\nAgreeableness and Conscientiousness when completing the\nquestionnaire in English.\nCultural differences in language and meaning\ncan lead to some interesting encounters. Got\nMilk literally translated into Spanish means\n\u2018Are You Lactating?\u2019 [Image Public Domain]\nFrom a practical standpoint, culturally influenced differences\nin language and meaning can lead to some interesting\nencounters, ranging from awkward to informative to\ndisastrous. Words in two different languages that may seem to\nbe exact translations of each other are likely to have different\nsets of culture-specific conceptual associations. For example,\nin Taiwan, Pepsi used the slogan \u201cCome Alive with Pepsi\u201d only\nto later find out that when translated it meant, \u201cPepsi brings\nyour ancestors back from the dead\u201d (Kwintessential Limited,\n428 | Cultural Switching 2012). Another example is the \u2018Got Milk? campaign which was\nvery successful in the United States. When this phrase was\ntranslated literally into Spanish as \u201cTienes (Do you have) Leche\n(milk)?\u201d for use in its Hispanic media debut there were some\nserious problems. That particular phrase is taken literally in\nthe Hispanic culture to mean, \u201cAre you lactating?\u201d This was\ndefinitely not what the advertisers had in mind but\nunderscores the importance of cultural frame switching when\nengaging bicultural or multicultural individuals.\nCode Switching\nCode-switching involves changing from one way of speaking\nto another between or within interactions and includes\nchanges in accent, dialect, language (Martin & Nakayama,\n2010). Code-switching can also refer to the process of\nmulticultural individuals using more than one language in\nconversation or other communicative acts (e.g., gestures, body\nlanguage, and understood contexts). By using different\nlanguages at the same time the brain switches back and forth\nbetween transmitting and receiving messages. Code-\nswitching among multicultural individuals creates a dual\ncommunication system in which people are able to maintain\ntheir identities with their in-group but can still acquire tools\nand gain access needed to function in larger dominant society\n(Yancy, 2011).\nThere are many reasons that people might code-switch.\nThere has been cross-cultural research indicating that an\naccent can activate stereotypes and change perceptions\n(Bourhis, Giles & Lambert, 1975; Dixon & Mahoney, 2004). In\nthe United States, people who have a Southern accent are\nperceived as being less intelligent and having a lower\nsocioeconomic status when compared to individuals with a\nstandard American accent (Phillips, 2010). If an individual\nCultural Switching | 429 believes that their accent is leading others to form unfavorable\nimpressions, they can consciously change their accent with\nmuch practice and effort. Once their ability to speak without\ntheir Southern accent is honed, they may be able to switch\nvery quickly between their native accent when speaking with\nfriends and family and their modified accent when speaking in\nprofessional settings.\nSome Indian call center workers complete intense training to so they\ncan code-switch and accommodate the speaking style of their\ncustomers [Call Centre Operators Image by ILO CC BY- NC-ND 3.0]\nIncreased outsourcing and globalization have produced\nheightened pressures for code-switching among call center\nworkers in India. Although many Indians learn English in school\nas a result of British colonization, their accents often active\nnegative stereotypes and reactions among Western customers\ncalling for help or customer service support. Some Indian call\ncenter workers completed intense training to be able to code-\nswitch and accommodate the speaking style of their\n430 | Cultural Switching customers (Pal, 2004) and there has been a growing trend\ntoward accent neutralization as a response to racist verbal\nabuse call center workers receive from customers (Nadeem,\n2012).\nPeople who work or live in multilingual settings may code-\nswitch many times throughout the day, or even within a single\nconversation. Some cultural linguists have argued that as a\nresult of social media, the majority of Americans engage in\ncode-switching regularly. Words like text, tweet, liked, googled\nand communicating with symbols (e.g., emojis) are used every\nday, across technological platforms and by individuals of all\nages. Also, within the United States, some people of color may\nengage in code-switching when communicating with\ndominant group members because they fear they may be\nnegatively judged and switching may minimize perceived\ndifferences. Code-switching may also signal a shift from formal\ninteractions to more informal interactions and individuals may\ncode-switching to reinforce their ingroup identity (Heller, 1992).\nAs our interactions continue to occur in more multinational\ncontexts, the expectations for code-switching and\naccommodation are sure to increase. It is important for us to\nconsider the intersection of culture and power to think critically\nabout the ways in which expectations for code-switching may\nbe based on cultural biases and how we can avoid ethnocentric\nbias and misinterpretations.\nCultural Switching | 431 Challenges to Living in\na Multicultural World\nUp to this point we have largely focused on many benefits\nof living in a multicultural world including the cognitive and\npsychological benefits of bilingualism, cultural frame\nswitching and the regular use of code-switching in the age\nof social media. This section will focus on many some of the\nchallenges that persist when living in a multicultural world.\nCultural Reaffirmation\nCultural reaffirmation is a phenomenon that occurs when\nmulticultural individuals living in multicultural societies\nendorse even more traditional values than persons from the\nnative country or monoculture individuals. There have been\nseveral instances observed in Western and Eastern cultures.\nFor example, Kosmitzki (1996) examined monocultural and\nbicultural Germans and Americans who rated themselves, their\ncultural group and adopted cultural group. The bicultural\nindividuals endorsed even more traits and values of the native\nculture than the monoculture individuals. Matsumoto,\nWeissman, Preston, Brown and Kupperbusch (1997) compared\nJapanese and Japanese Americans on ratings of interpersonal\ninteractions and found that the Japanese Americans rated\nthemselves higher in areas of collectivism than the Japanese\nnationals. Cultural reaffirmation has been explained by the\nstresses of immigrating or becoming part of a multicultural\nsociety. In other words, the immigrant group hangs tightly to\nthe native culture even as the native culture changes, in this\nway the immigrant culture begins to conform to stereotypes.\n432 | Challenges to Living in a\nMulticultural World Identity Denial\nIdentity denial occurs when individuals are not accepted as\na member of the group that they identify with. To be clear,\nindividuals are not denying their heritage, culture or\nexperience but others who share their identity are rejecting\nthem. Cheryan and Monin (2005) revealed that Asian\nAmericans experience more identity denial than other ethnic\ngroups in the United States. As a reaction to the denial,\nindividuals will often over identify with American culture (e.g.,\nfootball, music, television).\nIndividuals who experience identity denial tend to over identify with\nsymbols of American culture.

On the other hand, sometimes these beliefs are\nnegative, and they have the effect of making us perform more\npoorly just because of our knowledge about the stereotypes.\nOne of the long-standing puzzles in the area of academic\nperformance concerns why African American students in the\nUnited States perform more poorly on standardized tests,\nreceive lower grades, and are less likely to remain in school\nin comparison with White students, even when other factors\nsuch as family income, parents\u2019 education, and other relevant\nvariables are controlled. Steele and Aronson (1995) tested the\nhypothesis that these differences might be due to the\nactivation of negative stereotypes. They hypothesized that\nAfrican American students are aware of the inaccurate\nstereotype that \u2018African American students are intellectually\ninferior to White students,\u2019 and this stereotype creates a\nnegative expectation. This negative expectation then interferes\nwith students\u2019 performance on intellectual and academic tests\nthrough fear of confirming that stereotype.\nResults confirmed that African American college students\nperformed worse, in comparison with their prior test scores, on\nmath questions taken from the Graduate Record Examination\n(GRE) when the test was described to them as a diagnostic\nmeasure of their mathematical abilities (and thus when the\nstereotype was relevant) but performance was not influenced\nwhen the same questions were framed as a problem-solving\nactivity.\n434 | Challenges to Living in a Multicultural World Stereotype Threat is a situational threat in which individuals are\naware of others\u2019 negative expectations, which leads to their fear that\nthey will be judged and/or treated as inferior. [Image By Futurebird\nCC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/\nFile:Stereotype_threat_bw.jpg]\nIn another study, Steele and Aronson found that when African\nAmerican students were asked to indicate their race before\nthey took a math test (a way to activating the stereotype), they\nperformed more poorly than they had on prior exams, whereas\nthe scores of White students were not affected by first\nindicating their race. Steele and Aronson argued that thinking\nabout negative stereotypes that are relevant to the task that\nyou are performing creates stereotype threat, which leads to\ndecreased performance. That is, the negative impact of race\non standardized tests may be caused, at least in part, by the\nChallenges to Living in a Multicultural World | 435 performance situation itself. When the threat was present,\nAfrican American students were negatively influenced by it.\nResearch has found that the experience of stereotype threat\ncan help explain a wide variety of performance declines among\nthose who are targeted by negative stereotypes. For instance,\nwhen a math task is described as diagnostic of intelligence,\nLatinos and particularly Latinas perform more poorly than do\nWhites (Gonzales, Blanton, & Williams, 2002). Similarly, when\nstereotypes are activated, children with low socioeconomic\nstatus perform more poorly in math than do those with high\nsocioeconomic status, and psychology students perform more\npoorly than do natural science students (Brown, Croizet,\nBohner, Fournet, & Payne, 2003). Even groups who typically\nenjoy advantaged social status can be made to experience\nstereotype threat. White men performed more poorly on a\nmath test when they were told that their performance would\nbe compared with that of Asian men (Aronson, Lustina, Good,\nKeough, & Steele, 1999), and Whites students performed more\npoorly than African American students on a sport-related task\nwhen it was described to them as measuring their natural\nathletic ability (Stone, 2002).\nStereotype threat is created in situations that pose a\nsignificant threat to self-concern, such that our perceptions of\nourselves as important, valuable, and capable individuals are\nthreatened. In these situations, there is a discrepancy between\nour positive concept of our skills and abilities and the negative\nstereotypes suggesting poor performance. When our\nstereotypes lead us to be believe that we are likely to perform\npoorly on a task, we experience a feeling of unease and status\nthreat. Stereotype threat is not, however, absolute and\nmanipulations that affirm positive characteristics about\noneself or one\u2019s group are successful at reducing stereotype\nthreat (Alter, Aronson, Darley, Rodriguez, & Ruble, 2010;\nGreenberg et al., 2003; McIntyre, Paulson, & Lord, 2003). In fact,\njust knowing that stereotype threat exists may influence\n436 | Challenges to Living in a Multicultural World performance and possibly alleviate its negative impact (Johns,\nSchmader, & Martens, 2005).\nContact Hypothesis\nWe learned earlier that one of the reasons that people may\nhold stereotypes and prejudices is that they view the members\nof outgroups as different from them. Sometime we fear that\nour interactions with people from different racial groups will\nbe unpleasant, and these anxieties may lead us to avoid\ninteracting with people from those groups (Mallett, Wilson,\n& Gilbert, 2008). This suggests that a good way to reduce\nprejudice is to help people create closer connections with\nmembers of different groups. People will behave more\nfavorable toward others when they learn to see other people\nas more similar to them, as closer to the self, and to be more\nconcerned about them. This idea is known as the contact\nhypothesis.\nPettigrew and Tropp (2006) conducted a meta-analysis in\nwhich they reviewed over 500 studies that had investigated the\neffects of intergroup contact on group attitudes. They found\nthat attitudes toward groups that were in contact became\nmore positive over time. Furthermore, positive effects of\ncontact were found on both stereotypes and prejudice and for\nmany different types of contacted groups. The positive effects\nof intergroup contact may be due in part to increases in\nconcern for others. Galinsky and Moskowitz (2000) found that\nleading students to take the perspective of another group\nmember, which increased empathy and closeness to the\nperson, also reduced prejudice.\nChallenges to Living in a Multicultural World | 437 When we get to know individuals, contact is effective because we can\nget past our perceptions of others as group members and to see\nthem as people. Students at International School in Mozambique\n[Image by US State Department https://www.state.gov/m/a/os/]\nStudent behavior on campuses demonstrates the importance\nof connecting with others and the dangers of not doing so.\nSidanius, Van Laar, Levin, and Sinclair (2004) found that\nstudents who joined exclusive campus groups, including\nfraternities, sororities, and minority ethnic organizations, were\nmore prejudiced to begin with and became even less\nconnected and more intolerant of members of other social\ngroups over the time that they remained in the organizations.\nOne explanation is that memberships in these groups focused\nthe students on themselves and other people who were very\nsimilar to them, leading them to become less tolerant of others\nwho were different.\nOne large scale intergroup contact example came about as\na result of the United States (U.S.) Supreme Court case Brown\nv. Board of Education in 1954 which overturned an earlier court\nruling and declared state laws establishing separate public\nschools for African American and White students to be\nunconstitutional. As a result, schools had to be integrated,\nwhich caused severe political unrest in many states, but\n438 | Challenges to Living in a Multicultural World particularly in the Southern United States. Integrating schools\nhad a profound impact on the racial composition of\nclassrooms, improved educational and occupational\nachievement of African American students and increased the\ndesire of African American students to interact with Whites\nby forming cross-race friendships (Stephan, 1999). Overall,\ndesegregating schools in the United States supports the\nexpectation that intergroup contact, at least in the long run,\ncan be successful in changing attitudes. There is substantial\nsupport for the effectiveness of intergroup contact in\nimproving group attitudes in a wide variety of situations,\nincluding schools, work organizations, military forces, and\npublic housing.\nAlthough intergroup contact does work, it is not always a\ncure because the conditions necessary for it to be successful\nare frequently not met. Contact can be expected to work only\nin situations that create the appropriate opportunities for\nchange. For one, contact will only be effective if it provides\ninformation demonstrating that the existing stereotypes held\nby the individuals are incorrect. When we learn more about\ngroups that we didn\u2019t know much about before, we learn more\nof the truth about them, leading us to be less biased in our\nbeliefs; however, if our interactions with the group members do\nnot allow us to learn new beliefs, then contact cannot work.\nWhen we first meet someone from another category, we\nare likely to rely almost exclusively on our stereotypes (Brodt &\nRoss, 1998) but when we get to know the individual well (e.g.,\nas a student in a classroom gets to know other students over\na school year), we may get to the point where we ignore that\nindividual\u2019s group membership almost completely, responding\nto him or her entirely at the individual level (Madon et al., 1998).\nIn this way contact is effective in part because it leads us to get\npast our perceptions of others as group members and to see\nthem as people.\nChallenges to Living in a Multicultural World | 439 Chapter Review\nCulture is one of the most powerful forces in the world. It\nshapes how we make sense of our world, how we express\nourselves and how we understand and relate to others\n(ingroups and outgroups). Most ethnocentric bias and\nprejudice come from a difference in heritage, thinking and\nexperiences. We tend to examine a situation from our own\npoint of view and are often unable to apply principles of\ncultural relativism to individuals with whom we have\ndifferences. It is important to remember that we do not need to\nact on our biases and can override our automatic responses. By\nidentifying our implicit and ethnocentric bias through personal\nreflection and cultural awareness we are more creative, better\ncommunicators, and more likely to engage in critical thinking\nand evaluating information. Cultural awareness does not mean\nthat you must accept or condone behaviors; awareness is\nrecognition that cultures and individuals within those cultures\nhave been shaped through enculturation, ecology, resources\nand social norms that are appropriate, moral and just within\ntheir culture.\nVocabulary\nAcculturation is the process of social, psychological, and\ncultural change that occurs as a result of blending between\ncultures\nBilingualism refers to the ability to understand and produce\ntwo or more languages on a regular basis\nContact hypothesis is a method used to reduce prejudice\nand help people create closer connections with members of\ndifferent groups\n440 | Chapter Review Cultural frame switching refers to the process of bicultural\nor multicultural individuals accessing different culture-specific\nmental modules\nCultural code switching involves changing from one way\nof speaking to another between or within interactions and\nincludes changes verbal and non-verbal communication\nCulture shock is a common experience describing feelings of\nconfusion, stress and disorientation that occur when entering\nan unfamiliar culture\nCultural reaffirmation is a phenomenon that occurs when\nmulticultural individuals living in multicultural societies\nendorse even more traditional values than persons from the\nnative country or monoculture individuals\nIdentity denial occurs when individuals are NOT accepted as\na member of the group that he/she identifies with\nStereotype threat is a \u201csituational threat\u201d in which individuals\nare aware of others\u2019 negative expectations, which leads to their\nfear that they will be judged and/or treated as inferior\nChapter Review | 441  Aiello, L.
